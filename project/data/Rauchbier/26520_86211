3.62,-4.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This specialty brew is a cloudy golden hue with a respectable white cover and very little to show for lacing. The aroma offers a clear perfume of hickory smoke with a subtle ham and wheat idea to inspire the palate. And the flavor follows but my first impression is that it's a bit watered down from what the aroma suggested. In fact this brew seems to be aiming for a lighter, sessionable appeal with a decidedly frisky feel from pin point carbonation and a generally medium-light body. This is solid stuff that will translate very well into the summer months or to accompany an appropriate meal, but the flavor hits up front and then seems to quickly dissipate into the heavy carbonation. Likeable enough, one I'd definitely drink again, but not a show stopper creation as some of these Abby beers are. However, I don't think they were aiming for that anyway.","Durge","Jan 18, 2014"

I could sniff this all day. Pours light amber color, about a 1 inch head with very little retention. Taste is also awesome. The smoke is actually lighter than it is on the nose, but there is definitely a pork/bacon taste here. This is insanely drinkable for a rauchbier. If you like smoked beer at all, try this. It's a step below the best schlenkerla beers, but its still great, and like all JA beers, great value.","DonFrap","Aug 17, 2013"

The first thing I get when I smell is the smoke, nice sweet smoke almost like mesquite wood. Taste is surprisingly light and fruity at first sip, and the smoke follows afterward, not overpowering at all. It starts crisp and clean, slides into a smooth smokiness and then finishes amazingly crisp and clean again. It’s almost like a campfire, but the smokiness is sweeter and less astringent. This beer goes down easy and it refreshing at the same time, which can be hard to say about some smoked beers. All in all, this is a pretty stellar concoction.","greenmtn1111","Aug 13, 2013"

4.05,6.6,4,4,4.25,3.5,4,"The beer pours a surprisingly golden yellow color, with a lager clean body that has a nice murky haze and tons of little carbonation bubbles racing to the surface. The head is huge and white, full of a gradually growing size of bubbles, which top out around medium sized. The beer’s lacing is fat and foamy on the sides of the glass, leaving long strings and fangs on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells terrifically meaty with smoke and a nice underlying caramel malt. This is not the most overpowering rauchbier, but it has a nice big nose that brings bacon and a tender malty beer into one’s mind. On the tongue, the beer tastes dry and salty and is terrifically complex with bacony smoked malts, light hay hops and a touch of salt. The beer begins with light hayish hops and a touch of caramel malts, which quickly open into big smoked malts with a salty bacon flavor that really just lingers in the mouth, moving into smoked duck flavors and then mellowing into meaty salt. The aftertaste rings with meaty salt and a touch of hayish hops. On the mouth, the beer feels light and almost watery on the finish, leaving the mouth dry yet slightly sticky. Overall, this is a nice rauchbier that I could slug back a lot of. Terrific meaty flavors and wonderful drinkability, though I do wish the mouthfeel was a little thicker, if only because my mind sees that as matching the flavors better. Another great beer from Jack’s Abby! Try this beer!","Maxwell","Feb 11, 2013"

4.62,21.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Taste starts smoky and sweet, soft and fluffy in the middle, and comes back with the smoke and a bit of hops bitter at the close. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is superb. I always think there's room for more smoke, but this one puts it together well, balanced, yet doesn't leave the bacon in the pan. Cheers!","ppoitras","Nov 24, 2012"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"O- This was another great beer from Jack's Abby. There was a nice smokiness that paired well with a nice juicy lager taste. Everything was nicely balanced and overall it was very easy to drink. I haven't had too many smoked beers, but this is definitely one of the better one's I've had of the style. If you like smokey flavors then I definitely recommend trying this .","jaasen64","Nov 24, 2012"

4.35,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O: Seems to be going for a smoked Helles lager, and it hits its mark. Intensely smokey and very authentic. Tastes like it could have come from Bamberg. It's right up there with the Schlenkerla stuff.","ryan1788a5","Nov 14, 2012"
3.9,2.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall decent beer, nice smoked flavors, nice smoked meat and bacon like flavors esp, a decent malt base but seems a bit too light overall for the smoked character, and the lager portion gets mostly drowned out, but seeing as they only make lagers it's hard to make a lager that wouldn't get drowned out by the smoke, unless its a big dark malty beer and then not much of a lager anyways.","jlindros","Nov 13, 2012"

3.92,3.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a wisp of a white head that never really materializes, but never really leaves either. Yup that is a smokey aroma. It smells like a cross between a day old campfire and old bacon with a hint of melanoid and pilsner malt. The flavor is a hint of sweet up front with some grainy and sweet pilsner malt able to come forward before an onslaught of smokey meaty goodness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick smokey sweet mouthfeel. This is a bit over the top for my taste, but I can appreciate the greatness here. This is a really nice smoked beer with a lot of complexity even if this is not my favorite style.","johnnnniee","Nov 07, 2012"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"O: a very good rauch bier, there is pleanty of smoke going on here but it somehow keeps from being overbearing in a way... Some beers of this style infin to be far to much campfire smoke going on, but this is nicley done....","PeterIngemi","Nov 04, 2012"
3.65,-3.9,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Mildly sour with a dry, nearly astringent flavor. The smoke is in the background--I applaud this as most rauchbiers have too much smoke. Starts like a pale ale, with a touch of sweetness. Thin bodied and highly carbonated.","smcolw","Nov 03, 2012"

Well crafted, but not my style. I like their Smoke & Dagger considerably more. It tastes like it should be a beer that is pitch black in color. This brew is a great example of the abundance of talent at Jack's Abby; but this one really isn't for me.","VelvetExtract","Oct 19, 2012"

Smoked malt left home alone to run a muck, in the best possible way. though I liked Blabber & Smoke more, this is a close 2nd in the rauchbier category in my opinion/according to my palate. I will definitely be drinking this one again.","irishevans","0"
