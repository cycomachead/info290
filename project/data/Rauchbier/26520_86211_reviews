"Too smokey for me.  I've had other rauchbiers and this was just over the top smokey.  It overpowered the beer and made it seem like I was drinking a bottle of liquid smoke."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strange all around.  Really liked Smoke and Dagger, but this is another level of smoke, with it being in the forefront.  I did not care for it - OK."
""
""
""
"WOW! Tastes like smoked ham wrapped in smoked bacon. That's really all there is to say about this beer. Very unique, never had anything like it. Smoke flavor is not overpowering like other smokey beers I've had. Not something I could drink that often, but something I would definitely encourage everyone to try at least once."

"O-  Way more balanced than I expected after reading reviews.   The smoke is intense and unique, but not as intense as advertised in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is usually one of my least favorite styles as it can easily become overly meaty, but this one balances out quite nicely. the smokiness is delicate as it should be and the malts provide just enough sweetness to balance everything out."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice beer but .5 of a Liter was way too much for me; I'd have to cap it at 4-6 oz. personally. If you love super smokey beers check it out but a bit too much for me to want a full glass of again."
""
""
"A grilled McCadam cheddar, horseradish dill havarti on multi grain bread with tomato cheddar bisque, definitely helped bring out the earthiness of this beer."
""
""
"They are not kidding about the Ham taste. My god.  Deeply unpleasant to my palate, but kudos to JA for trying new things."
"You have to like this style, if you don't, this beer won't be for you.  It is extremely smoky, almost meat like.  Excellent accompaniment to food."
"It's a little bit too meaty for its lighter body, beef up the malts a bit and this would be better."

"Nice smoke balance and not fake tasting but the ham flavor doesn't work for me"

"This specialty brew is a cloudy golden hue with a respectable white cover and very little to show for lacing. The aroma offers a clear perfume of hickory smoke with a subtle ham and wheat idea to inspire the palate. And the flavor follows but my first impression is that it's a bit watered down from what the aroma suggested. In fact this brew seems to be aiming for a lighter, sessionable appeal with a decidedly frisky feel from pin point carbonation and a generally medium-light body. This is solid stuff that will translate very well into the summer months or to accompany an appropriate meal, but the flavor hits up front and then seems to quickly dissipate into the heavy carbonation. Likeable enough, one I'd definitely drink again, but not a show stopper creation as some of these Abby beers are. However, I don't think they were aiming for that anyway."

"This beer was, as I have finished, a real treat for me. Thanks again, Kevin!"

"This is a medium bodied bree with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall an interesting mix and enjoyable. This is easy to approach and really easy drinking. I would not mind having this again. Thanks Heath."
""
"Overall - Fits the name. A pilsner with a great meaty smoke flavor."
""
""
""
"O - very nice take on a rauchbier. Much lighter than expected and quite the easy drink. Good show jacks!"

"Overall- I'm surprised by this one. Not really into Smoked beers that much, but this is solid."

"O: A nicely executed American-brewed rauchbier that provides plenty of smoke in the nose while not being completely one-dimensional in the taste. Easy to quaff and drink lots of. Track some down if you're a fan of smoked beers"

"O: Really well balance and easy to drink. Smoke dominates and is deliciously flavored. Thanks again, Kevin."

"Overall this is a very, very good beer with a nicely balanced flavor. Winner."

"Poured from bottle into a Tree House snifter. I am a rauchhead, so this may be a biased review. Smell is amazing. Campfire mixed with a little ham and bacon. I could sniff this all day. Pours light amber color, about a 1 inch head with very little retention. Taste is also awesome. The smoke is actually lighter than it is on the nose, but there is definitely a pork/bacon taste here. This is insanely drinkable for a rauchbier. If you like smoked beer at all, try this. It's a step below the best schlenkerla beers, but its still great, and like all JA beers, great value."

"Pale orange, very light amber in color with a decent head, but not too big. The first thing I get when I smell is the smoke, nice sweet smoke almost like mesquite wood. Taste is surprisingly light and fruity at first sip, and the smoke follows afterward, not overpowering at all. It starts crisp and clean, slides into a smooth smokiness and then finishes amazingly crisp and clean again. It’s almost like a campfire, but the smokiness is sweeter and less astringent. This beer goes down easy and it refreshing at the same time, which can be hard to say about some smoked beers. All in all, this is a pretty stellar concoction."

"I definitely dig the unabashed bacon flavors, the sweet malts blend nicely as well making this feel especially breakfast-y. I would prefer some more complexities and lager qualities however."

"O-a decent smoked beer with intense flavor and a backbone to support it"
""

"The beer pours a surprisingly golden yellow color, with a lager clean body that has a nice murky haze and tons of little carbonation bubbles racing to the surface. The head is huge and white, full of a gradually growing size of bubbles, which top out around medium sized. The beer’s lacing is fat and foamy on the sides of the glass, leaving long strings and fangs on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells terrifically meaty with smoke and a nice underlying caramel malt. This is not the most overpowering rauchbier, but it has a nice big nose that brings bacon and a tender malty beer into one’s mind. On the tongue, the beer tastes dry and salty and is terrifically complex with bacony smoked malts, light hay hops and a touch of salt. The beer begins with light hayish hops and a touch of caramel malts, which quickly open into big smoked malts with a salty bacon flavor that really just lingers in the mouth, moving into smoked duck flavors and then mellowing into meaty salt. The aftertaste rings with meaty salt and a touch of hayish hops. On the mouth, the beer feels light and almost watery on the finish, leaving the mouth dry yet slightly sticky. Overall, this is a nice rauchbier that I could slug back a lot of. Terrific meaty flavors and wonderful drinkability, though I do wish the mouthfeel was a little thicker, if only because my mind sees that as matching the flavors better. Another great beer from Jack’s Abby! Try this beer!"

"Eric hooked me up in a great trade.... Well recommended."
""
"O – This is a very tasty beer. I wish I could appreciate some more aromas or flavors, but the aromas and flavors that are here are very well done. This is an extremely drinkable beer, especially for something that tastes like smoked ham."

"I'm completely sold on Jack's Abbey. I had a 5 minute love fest with the clerk at the beer store today about how everything JA makes is good and reasonably priced."
"M&D&O - you have to love it when a beer exemplifies a particular style this well without losing its soul of a beer, and this beer is one of those beers. If you are a fan of Rauchbiers try to get this one!"
""
"M: It's a light-medium bodied brew. Without the smoked meatiness, it would be crisp and light I believe."
""
"Notes: Wow this one is quite and experience and a dam amazing one. It's bacon, pork and wood in a bottle and would make an incredible breakfast. I will definitely pick this one up again. Cheers."

"Taste starts smoky and sweet, soft and fluffy in the middle, and comes back with the smoke and a bit of hops bitter at the close. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is superb. I always think there's room for more smoke, but this one puts it together well, balanced, yet doesn't leave the bacon in the pan. Cheers!"
"O- This was another great beer from Jack's Abby. There was a nice smokiness that paired well with a nice juicy lager taste. Everything was nicely balanced and overall it was very easy to drink. I haven't had too many smoked beers, but this is definitely one of the better one's I've had of the style. If you like smokey flavors then I definitely recommend trying this ."
""
""
"O: Smoke doesn't overpower as it does in most rauchbiers. Overall a decent, albeit simple and interesting beer."
""
""
"O: Seems to be going for a smoked Helles lager, and it hits its mark. Intensely smokey and very authentic. Tastes like it could have come from Bamberg. It's right up there with the Schlenkerla stuff."
"Overall decent beer, nice smoked flavors, nice smoked meat and bacon like flavors esp, a decent malt base but seems a bit too light overall for the smoked character, and the lager portion gets mostly drowned out, but seeing as they only make lagers it's hard to make a lager that wouldn't get drowned out by the smoke, unless its a big dark malty beer and then not much of a lager anyways."
""
"Overall: One of the better domestic rauchbiers, and except for a bit of an off taste at the end, this one is very good. I do like this better than Smoke and Dagger. I will be picking this up again. Great value rauchbier."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a wisp of a white head that never really materializes, but never really leaves either. Yup that is a smokey aroma. It smells like a cross between a day old campfire and old bacon with a hint of melanoid and pilsner malt. The flavor is a hint of sweet up front with some grainy and sweet pilsner malt able to come forward before an onslaught of smokey meaty goodness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick smokey sweet mouthfeel. This is a bit over the top for my taste, but I can appreciate the greatness here. This is a really nice smoked beer with a lot of complexity even if this is not my favorite style."
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Light bodied, crisp, and a good carbonation level. Digging the balance overall and it's really drinkable. Overally a great smoked beer. A must try if you're into the style."
"O: a very good rauch bier, there is pleanty of smoke going on here but it somehow keeps from being overbearing in a way... Some beers of this style infin to be far to much campfire smoke going on, but this is nicley done...."
"Mildly sour with a dry, nearly astringent flavor. The smoke is in the background--I applaud this as most rauchbiers have too much smoke. Starts like a pale ale, with a touch of sweetness. Thin bodied and highly carbonated."
""
"Has alot of hits, and a few big whiffs at the plate."
"Yet again (I'm starting to sound like a broken record) another great beer by Jack's Abby. If you're a fan of Aecht Schlenkerla beers, you'll love having a local American version. A real winner here. I'm glad I picked up 2 growlers. :-)"
""
""
"This was definitely one of the most ""meaty"" beer I have ever tried. Quite an interesting take on the style and worth a shot if you can get your hands on a bottle."
""
""
"O: Excellent brew. I prefer this over the Smoke and Dagger. Almost tastes like a super smoky Hoponius Union in its smootheness. Try this when you get a chance! Its vegan-friendly as well."
""
"Balance of smoke and base beer, not an easy thing to do for some brewers. The smoked malts lends some great flavors while not killing the rest of this beer."
""
"This is a highly quaffable winner for smoked beer fans. Nice work!"
""
"O/D-I am very limited in my Rauch experience. I am limited because I don't really like the style. This is quite cool and super-unique. I did not love it. Well crafted, but not my style. I like their Smoke & Dagger considerably more. It tastes like it should be a beer that is pitch black in color. This brew is a great example of the abundance of talent at Jack's Abby; but this one really isn't for me."
""
""
"Overall- This is a pretty simple beer. Super smoke flavors on top of a solid lager base. I bumped up the overall score because the taste was a 4.25."
""
""
"O: This is a very well-crafted Rauchbier. Almost near the level that Schlenkerla is on. A smoky, tasty, fresh lager that is wonderful for the season. Jack's Abby knows how to make a lager!"
"O- I dig this brew. Smoked malt left home alone to run a muck, in the best possible way. though I liked Blabber & Smoke more, this is a close 2nd in the rauchbier category in my opinion/according to my palate. I will definitely be drinking this one again."
