3.58,-7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts and smoke. Taste is roasted malts, meaty, a good bit of smokiness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall, although I am not a huge fan of this style, this was an enjoyable beer.","tone77","Apr 01, 2012"
3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall â€“ A nice easy to drink brew. One that is well worth trying.","Darkmagus82","Mar 29, 2012"
4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Color is very dark brown, almost black. Thinnish head goes down fairly quickly. Nose is very mild, a little sweet, not especially indicative of the taste. I couldn't really perceive any smoke in the nose immediately after it was drawn, and not much after it had stood a bit either. Taste is nicely balanced between sweet malt, lightly bitter coffee and smokey with some meaty/savory character. Very nice Rauch. I will certainly look forward to trying more offerings from Roy Pitz Brewing if this is an indication of their beers.","nightowl66","Feb 27, 2012"

3.8,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This is probably my favorite brew from Roy Pitz. I've had their Fat Daddy Sacks and Blonde on tap back in November and wasn't very impressed. I was convinced to take a visit to their brewery after visiting my local homebrew show. I wasn't disappointed. They gave free samples of every beer they had on tap. There Quad was delicious as well.","y2jrock60","Dec 14, 2011"

3.25,-15.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This beer poured out as a brownish tone with a white fizzy head on top. The smell of the beer gives off a malty aroma with a light smoked aroma in there too. The taste of the beer has elements of smoke and lagered malts in there. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it's got a lighter body that remains drinkable. Overall this beer was decent, it's not something I'd need to have again but it's not bad.","Knapp85","Nov 26, 2011"

3.7,-3.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Had this at $1 draft night at the Shippen Place Hotel. Pours what appears to be black in color. Hard to tell for me as I was outside on the patio as the sun went down. Didn't retain much head however. Smelled mostly roasty with otherwise a clean smelling aroma. Maybe a little coffee from the roasts, but I thought it was mostly subdued. Didn't get much smokiness from the malts; I think maybe just enough was added to this beer to add a little complexity but that's about it. Tasted roasty with a light mouthfeel. Would have liked to see better head retention but a nice beer nonetheless.","jwhancher","Mar 17, 2011"
3.77,-2.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"M: The mouthfeel is clean, chewy with a dark undertone. I'm impressed with how well the flavors combine.","akorsak","Feb 20, 2011"
3.4,-11.7,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Poured dark brown with some deep chestnut highlights; minimal head retention. Very smoky in the aroma - sort of a sweet hickory scent. Roasted and perfume notes as well as a hint of cocoa and honey sweetness. Smoke very present on the palate, followed by slight tartness and a mildly bitter finish. Body is light/medium and very creamy. Average drinkability; smokiness is a bit overpowering.","turnstile","Aug 09, 2010"

4.05,5.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"D - Probably the best offering I've had from Roy Pitz to date, Ludwig's Revenge boasts a well-rounded mouthfeel and pleasant smoked flavor that left me wanting more.","ffejherb","Jan 15, 2009"

4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D-Not quite a traditional rauchbier, and not hefty enough to be a smoked porter...falls in between the two....maybe a smoked brown. Regardless of what it really is it is a winner. I love smoked beers and when done right I become a fan quickly.","Deuane","Beers"
4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5," D/O - A great Rauchbier that follows the guidelines of the style to a tee. The smokiness is kept in check by the malts and hints of hops. If you enjoy Rauchbiers like I do, the drinkability of this brew if very high. Well done RP. Cheers!","pvsob","0"
