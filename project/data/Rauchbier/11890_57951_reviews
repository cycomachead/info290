"Pretty good - a solid take on the style. Perhaps not quite as balanced as Schlenkerla but well-crafted nonetheless. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are intensely smoky and woody. Hints of smoked meat/fish and fruitiness can be discerned. Decent body. Lingers long on the palate. Tasty; if you're a fan of rauchbiers then this is certainly worth sampling."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body with medium-low levels of carbonation intensity, resulting in a smooth, lightly foamy and well-flowing mouthfeel. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness on the palate and lips."

"O: A fairly average beer. Personally, I felt as if the smoke was underdone (and I am not even a fan of smoked beers), but it's not as if this beer had the body to balance off any more smoke. It's almost as if this beer is something akin to a Rauchbier Light."

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours dark caramel brown with a thin off-white head and some yeast sediment. The head lingers for a long time. The beer is wonderfully smoky with hints of caramel and chocolate. There's some of that breadiness from the smoked malt as well. The flavor is malty, slightly sweet, and smoky. The smokiness lingers in the mouth along with some mild back end bitterness. I get some of those chocolate notes as well, but they're faint. The body is medium to full with low carbonation. The beer coats the mouth, allowing for a smoky aftertaste to linger. The beer is pretty easy to drink. This is an excellent beer. It's not quite up there with the German rauchbiers, but it's not far off."

"This was a nice take on the rauchbier style. It offers a complex encapsulation of the style, it has a few rough edges toward the end, and the dry smokiness can be a bit overshadowing but its a quality beer and I would have it again."
"Overall: Oftentimes smoked beers take on a band-aid character but in this case the smoke and the caramel blend perfectly, bringing complexity and balance"
"Feel is a bit thin. Taste is a bit more subdued. Light ash, sweet char, mellow whiskey. Lingering bark-like bitterness. Odd, twangy fruit finish. Paired with the thin, beaded body, & the overeager start, I'm guessing that this one will start turning sooner rather then later."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of smoked malt, campfire, and smoked meats and cheeses. Taste is much the same with a slight adhesive bandage flavor and a very smokey aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors for the style."

"I get used to the smoke after half the glass, but the beer reains interesting."
""
"O: The review looks worse than it really is. I do enjoy this beer and would give it a much better score if it had a more luxurious mouthfeel."
"Beer is brown in color with a pretty dense and nice looking head. The aroma is smoky with bacon. Medium intensity. On the taste, the beer is strongly smoked, quite intense. Some woody notes in there too, mainly on the finish. Not very bitter. Medium body. Quite effervescent. The head sticks well to the glass. A nice rauchbier."

"Bottle: Poured a dark amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of smoke and light sweet caramel malt base is quite nice. Taste is also a good mix between some smoke notes with some medium sweet caramelized malt backbone. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Nice balance between smoke notes and caramelized sugar with provides a great drinking experience."
" Drinks very easily."

"Poured into an Ommegang flute. Pours a slightly cloudy medium to dark garnet orange amber. Half finger off-white head dissipates slowly to a ring with nice lacing. Aroma of smoked meat and mild malt. Flavor is a very pleasant, rich malt and smoke with light fruit flavors fleetingly present. Finish is smooth smoke and sweet malt. Creamy medium to heavy bodied, nice. This is a very distinctive and flavorful rauchbier. Very well integrated with a very interesting flavor progression. I'm very impressed and will buy this again."

"Poured a chestnut color, with a cream colored finger and a half of frothy head. Aroma was nice, with a not overpowering, but assertive smokey malt aroma, with some hints of caramel, toffee and meatiness. The charred smokiness is super assertive! There's some nuttiness and caramel with hints of toffee on the finish. Much more intense than the aroma. The feel has a quite creamy feel, medium bodied. Overall, this is quite nice. It's an assertive Rauchbier, but I like em that way."
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It just goes down really easy, add it has a really nice flavor to it. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, and a good example of the style. I really enjoyed this beer, and I would be happy to drink it again. I recommend checking it out."

"Dots of white lace stick to the glass of this amber brown colored beer. The nose brings out a modest smoke note and cured meat, also some sweet malt. For those afraid of a really smokey beer, you don't need to be afraid this Dutch brew. The smoke is modest, but a sweet smoke. It's almost like candied bacon. More commonly found is the marzen-like maltiness and sweetness. Fairly smooth and light medium bodied, which helps make this a pleasant beer for anytime."
"Poured an almost brown amber body w/ one finger offwhite head that died slow on top of a strong, roasted malt aroma w/ some smokiness but a rather mild smokey aroma; not overpowering or ""beef jerkyish"". For a rauchbier this brew tones down the dry, roasted malts in favor of a slightly smoother, creamier version. Don't get me wrong, the smoke is there and it is good and I like the sweet notes and a touch of minor grassy hops on the finish for a slight prick on the tongue, but when I think of rauchbiers I tend to think of real dry and smokey."
"Average bodied, bitter aftertaste, rhubarb, smokiness, full, with a long and pleasant bitterness."
"This went great with some smoked almonds, dutch cheese, an prosciutto ."
"Light carbonation, light mouthfeel, overall pretty good stuff. Extremely well balanced."
"O: if you love a beer that is HUGE in smoke this beer is awesome but missing on carbonation"
"O: A good rauchbier, you get what you pay for, but nothing wowing here."
"A little one sided, but a good Rauch."
"Massive thanks goes out to Jeff and Charles at Appalachian Vintner in Asheville for giving me this one on my most recent visit! Thanks guys! Served from bottle into a Mother Earth strange. Poured red-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, smoke, and ham. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, ham, and pulled pork. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. Massive amounts of smoked meat flavors going on in this one. Honestly tasted like I was at a BBQ and has made me one to plan one for this summer now! Reason being is that I wish I had some to go with this brew. It will definitely be present when I have a BBQ next time. Great aroma and flavor going on in this one. A very nice example of the style and a must try in my opinion!"
"Overall: This is a good but not great rauchbier. It has a good smokey flavor to it, but it isn't quite as bold as I would like it to be. I would drink this again, but I might not buy it."
"For the price and taste, I probably won't get it again, but it was certainly interesting. I don't find it super-drinkable, but this could be well paired with food (duck?)."
"Nice to try, but I will not buy it again, mostly because of the price."
"It is a nice one, but have a Bamberger Rauch for less money rather than this."
"pours a hazy, thick mud brown with clear shades of a nut-brown, too. Smells of sweet, bock-like malt with some kind of smokish notes. Pleasant and pretty clean, but too much like a doppel bock. The smoked malt comes through a lot more in the flavor. It does come through as strong as Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier, but perhaps the difference is what makes this one nice, but not as good. I'd say this one tastes more like 'smoke' that meat that has been smoked. It's not a strong bacon or smoked salmon flavor that makes the other classic examples good, but not extremely drinkable in high frequency."
"I picked this up at a store in Brooklyn, New York. Pours a murky brown colour with very thin head. Lots of smoke, almost bacony. I find the flavour to have almost a salty aftertaste, with the lingering bacon flavour as an aftertaste. Medium bodied carbonation."
"Ken's bottle. A decent enough smoked beer though not exceptional it is worth trying."
"Not my favorite style or one I am too familiar with, but ordered this up at Vaandag in NYC. It had a dark amber color and a faily unremarkable aroma. The taste and mouthfeel was on the money. A nice amount fo smokiness, which means a subtle amount. It was there and noticable, but mostly towards the end of the palate. A perfect amount to compliment a smokey food, or to contrast with something less robust. Very creamy motuhfeel. Excellent."
"a rather exceptional beer when it comes to food accompaniment with a excellenct balance of smoked malt, and dark fruit qualities. pour is cloudy dark orange/amber with about two fingers of nearly white head. nose is plum, black berry and smokey camp fire. palate is first off smokey as expected. but a dryness that is equal to the citrus notes of the hops... palate has a meaty black currant to it, plum and blackberries like in the nose but with a quality of subtle cherry yogurt. this beer has not in any way gone bad. its very subtle and it may be because i have it with liver, shallots and kale in balsamic vinegar but it brought out some fantastic potential in the range."
"Pours a slightly hazy, amber color. Suspended sediment is present. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, smoke, slight roasted malt, hint of alcohol, and an odd bacon grease aroma that is amazing. Fits the style of a Rauchbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smoke, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hops, hint of citrus, and a hint of yeast. Overall, great aroma, great body, and great blend."
"Pours a cloudy chestnut brown with a big thick frothy head that is still around at the very last sip. I got subdued aromas of woody smoke, bbq pork and a bit of dark fruit. Flavors are much of the same, not as smokey as I like it but I really like the smoke flavor. Thought that I got more wood and well seasoned meat, salty Chinese bbq pork ribs is what I am thinking. In fairness I should mention that I am drinking this with a nicely seasoned Rib Eye for dinner. Extremely smooth and really perfect on the palette, Excellent! I would drink this all night but honestly not as flavorful as the Schlenkerla Urbier or Marzen, but very nice still and it is it's own beer. Over all very nice and would get again."
"VDubb hearkens back to his family's roots with his selection, a continuation of the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender. This conspirator pours a clear russet topped by a finger or so of creamy ecru foam. The nose is definitely dominated by charred smoke, though some honey-drizzled ham sits savoringly in the clear-aired background. There's a vague sweetness in there as well. The taste focuses more on the ham to begin with, a slice of pineapple laying on top; the smoke comes in near the end, diminished in strength since the smell. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda crisp finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent rauch, though a bit light on the smoke for me. Still, it is very smooth and seems to go down insanely easily."
"M&D: well bottle-conditioned, the mouthfeel is consistently mildly effervescent and smooth, against a medium body. All in all, I find this Belgian take on smoked beer a very successful and succulent one, coming with a bit different complexity than the original Bamberg stuff. Highly enjoyable!"
" D- The smoke has some nice complexity to it and the band-aid note is in the background and not the offensive plastic taste but a good cloth band-aid note. Malt is a bit buried but plays a good supporting role."
"Tasted from 10.14oz bottle. Pours clear amber with a decent off-white but quickly receding head. The nose has a hint of sweetness with hickory smoke, salty brine, and some lightly roasted malt. Flavor is smoked hickory with smoky roasted almonds and some malt. The body is fairly light with average carbonation and a medium-length smoked finish."
"D: This beer was relatively easy to drink, although the smoked smell and flavor wasn't quite as intense as some of the other rauchbiers out there."
