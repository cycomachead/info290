"Maybe the one I got was bad, but it tasted like sour cigarette smoke. I like sour beers and I like smoked beers. The problem is this taste like it shouldn't be sour."
"Decent levels of smoke, more like cigarettes than smoked food. Chili is surprisingly dominant with some whiskey coming through. Interesting mix, but overly sweet for my taste."
"Pretty sure it's liquid smoke added. I hate that."

"Black with low mocha head, Low to average lacing. The aroma is wood smoke, also meaty aroma, leather. I don’t feel chilli at all. The taste is also smokey, leather, soy sauce and sweet. Palate it thin, low carbonation. The beer is lighter than you could expect, due to sweet character very drinkable. Really nothing special."

"Not the smokiest of beers, rather light, same goes for the chili part. Easier to drink, but probably many people will find it lacking."

"O: First off, I don't know that I'd call this a rauchbier. I'd call it a stout with peated malt. Second, if you like Scotch smoke with roasty notes, I'd definitely recommend it. I liked it a lot."

"Honestly my expecations are never that high for De Molen, the half Belgian half other style brews they do are always just a bit of a miss for me. This one however, is a strong representation for the style. If they could just get that carbonation under control."
""
"Overall - After drinking a bit of this, I lost interest in it quickly. Not rich enough and the chocolate flavor dropped off."

"O: wow. this is an interesting beer to say the least. good malt, great smoke, alot of earthy flavors. I couldn't drink alot of this but it is very enjoyable and would go so well with a nice robust steak or cigar. /88"

"This one pours a light bodied milk chocolate brown with a billowing three finger, very carbonated and active mocha head. Like most of their 12oz bottles, this one appears to be a little too carbonated. The nose is full of chile pepper, leather, and peat. It's very intriguing. I'm glad it holds its own on the pepper front. The flavors are smoky, dry, leathery, has some bark to it, and earthy musty pepper. It's interesting. It's peaty. The peaty characteristic is it's greatest strength. It drinks lighter in body than you'd think, because of the carbonation. It's effervescent. Overall this was a nice smoked beer. It was pretty well balanced between the peat, earth, and pepper. Solid beer from De Molen."

"Fresh bottle at Volo release day. Outstanding smoked. Aromas of rich smoked malt and wine. Very rich malt, chocolate, peat, whisky, really tasty, with chiles in the finish.Good amount of retained head. One of the best beers I have had in last few months."

"Smoked beer with chili peppers...what could go wrong? Dark brown in color with an off-white head. Intensely smokey with lots of roasted malt, mild char, and maybe a bit of dark chocolate. Interesting, the chili peppers aren’t all that strong. The smoke is just as strong on the palate is on the aroma. A touch of peat to go along with all the char and ash. Maybe even a bit of glue, a moderate spiciness, and some burnt nuts. Not very pleasant."
"All in all, it kinda feels gimmicky and ends up being somewhat muddy and confusing (to my palate atleast). It does surprisingly well as a refreshing beer in the summer, though."

"Neat, but lots of smoke and not as much body."
"330ml bottle. ½ pint shaker glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Pours dark amber in color, headed by dark beige, copious & rocky foam. Crown is lasting, creamy & flavorful. Shows aromas of roasted malts, burnt chocolate & peat smoked malts as well as roasted bacon & peppery hues. Subtle underlying floral notes. Sweet/sour flavor at first sip with intense burnt bread & smoky touch. Flavor seems to be smooth by roasted malts but spicy/smoky hues win the match. Suntuous bitter & kind oily palate. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Dry sour fruit/bitter finish. Odd beer!"

"A fine example of the style with great flavor, however a bit too phenolic in the aroma. Certainly a beer I am glad I tried and a worthy adversary to other in the style."

"To drink at cellar t° with smoked meat."

"Looking at the ingredients list, chilies? whiskey malts? umm where is this bouquet and flavor? This is a novocaine dentist office trip mess. I am craving a Schlenkerla now, this is not good and just makes me think what the heck where they thinking? Terrible, you've done better. I am scoring this overall REAL low, this is no fun at all and this is one of my favorite styles.. really dropped the ball here. Ok I admit using a snifter on this was a bit overkill, but the taste on this is a real disaster."
"O: Of course, a beer like this won't please everyone, but it is worth a shot if you like rauchbiers."

"Overall: I could not drink more than a bottle of this but I must say it definitely achieves it's goal"

"Looks-wise this gives the overall impression of a malted milk ball; dark, thick, chocolatey brown with a big, sandy, beige head. The aroma is mostly a hickory-like smoke, molasses, Band-Aids, a drop of honey, and unfortunately little else. However, the flavor is nice, and has a fair amount of nuance, although it's too try and thin to really savor. Lots of chocolate, some whisky-like smoke, dates, walnuts, and oak – rich and savory. As for the chilli? It's there, but it's very, very subtle – at first you just get its flavor, which integraes well with the smoke, but over time it steadily builds to a satisfying heat that warms the whole mouth. Pretty good, but imbalanced and just a little uninteresting – there are similar and much better beers available from Mikkeller, Black Isle, and Rogue."
"O: I must say I am impressed. Chili heat is dialed in, the balance of sweet and smoke is on point, and the mouthfeel is excellent. Top notch Rauchbier!"
"Overall: This beer is way too medicinal. I'm really not a fan and wouldn't have another."
"As an aside, I enjoyed half the bottle with chicken molé, and the combination was fabulous."
"It's funny: I came to the Local Option looking to try a different De Molen smoked beer, only to find it kicked and this one freshly tapped. Fair trade to me. It pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises campfire, smoked honey-baked ham, caramel and toffee. This is what I'm talkin' 'bout right here! Tasty. The taste brings in more of the same, with a lighter bit of toffee and more of a beech-leaning smoke, as opposed to the woodsier campfire of the smell. Still pretty tasty. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a damn fine bit o' smoky goodness. Good times."

"O: Considering everything this is a pretty nice Rauchbier - complex."
"O - Not particularly good or memorable. Taste is too bland and mouthfeel is kind of a wreck on this beer."
"O - Drains were invented for times like this."
"D - It's a nice smoked beer that is hampered by a weak mouthfeel. I'd try this again on-tap if I saw it at Local Option or one of the few other bars that have De Molen kegs."
"D : alcohol is very well hidden , very drinkable !"
"I had it in a side by side tasting with Schlenkerla Rauch Märzen. It's the same quality but the Rook & Vuur is so more intense in many ways. More smoke, better smoke if you'd ask me as in the side by side Schlenkerla tasted more like an ashtray and the Rook & Vuur like smoked sausage. It has way more body, but of course a higher ABV as well. Looked great, when down easy."
