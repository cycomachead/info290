"I love Rauchbier it's one of my favorite styles and this is just really not good. Screwy mix of flavors through a wet palate. This is almost as if someone took flat homebrew and mixed it with Nestle Quick and served it."

"This I would buy again and would recommend to folks that appreciate the style."

"O: True to style. Carbonation was a bit much. Other than that, good beer."

"Drink- Not for me. I tried it. Probably the worst Rauchbier I have had."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts and smoke. Taste is roasted malts, meaty, a good bit of smokiness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall, although I am not a huge fan of this style, this was an enjoyable beer."
"Overall â€“ A nice easy to drink brew. One that is well worth trying."
"Color is very dark brown, almost black. Thinnish head goes down fairly quickly. Nose is very mild, a little sweet, not especially indicative of the taste. I couldn't really perceive any smoke in the nose immediately after it was drawn, and not much after it had stood a bit either. Taste is nicely balanced between sweet malt, lightly bitter coffee and smokey with some meaty/savory character. Very nice Rauch. I will certainly look forward to trying more offerings from Roy Pitz Brewing if this is an indication of their beers."
"Cheers!"
"This is probably my favorite brew from Roy Pitz. I've had their Fat Daddy Sacks and Blonde on tap back in November and wasn't very impressed. I was convinced to take a visit to their brewery after visiting my local homebrew show. I wasn't disappointed. They gave free samples of every beer they had on tap. There Quad was delicious as well."
"Overall, nicel done brew, clean dunkel, flavor light smokiness to come through and linger nIcely"
"This beer poured out as a brownish tone with a white fizzy head on top. The smell of the beer gives off a malty aroma with a light smoked aroma in there too. The taste of the beer has elements of smoke and lagered malts in there. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it's got a lighter body that remains drinkable. Overall this beer was decent, it's not something I'd need to have again but it's not bad."

"Had this at $1 draft night at the Shippen Place Hotel. Pours what appears to be black in color. Hard to tell for me as I was outside on the patio as the sun went down. Didn't retain much head however. Smelled mostly roasty with otherwise a clean smelling aroma. Maybe a little coffee from the roasts, but I thought it was mostly subdued. Didn't get much smokiness from the malts; I think maybe just enough was added to this beer to add a little complexity but that's about it. Tasted roasty with a light mouthfeel. Would have liked to see better head retention but a nice beer nonetheless."
"M: The mouthfeel is clean, chewy with a dark undertone. I'm impressed with how well the flavors combine."
"Poured dark brown with some deep chestnut highlights; minimal head retention. Very smoky in the aroma - sort of a sweet hickory scent. Roasted and perfume notes as well as a hint of cocoa and honey sweetness. Smoke very present on the palate, followed by slight tartness and a mildly bitter finish. Body is light/medium and very creamy. Average drinkability; smokiness is a bit overpowering."
"d: I haven't tried many, but this is one of the better rauchbiers I've tried. Very nicely done."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"D- The taste lasts a little too long on the tongue. Almost a bothersome effect that detracts from an overall pretty good beer."
"Excellent drinkability. Very enjoyable."
"D - I've never had a Rauchbier beer before but I was expecting more smoke flavor...overall a solid offering...I look to try more from the local Roy Pitz"
"D - Probably the best offering I've had from Roy Pitz to date, Ludwig's Revenge boasts a well-rounded mouthfeel and pleasant smoked flavor that left me wanting more."
"My first RP brew and hopefully not the last."
"D-This was quite a drinkable beer. Goes down easy and smooth."
"D-Not quite a traditional rauchbier, and not hefty enough to be a smoked porter...falls in between the two....maybe a smoked brown. Regardless of what it really is it is a winner. I love smoked beers and when done right I become a fan quickly."
" D/O - A great Rauchbier that follows the guidelines of the style to a tee. The smokiness is kept in check by the malts and hints of hops. If you enjoy Rauchbiers like I do, the drinkability of this brew if very high. Well done RP. Cheers!"
