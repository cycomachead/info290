"Thanks Phillip, from Quebec buying club."
"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light smoked malt with some dry caramel malt with light and subtle notes of residual sugar. Taste is also dominated by great caramel malt with light smoked malt notes and some light residual sugar notes. Body is lighter then expected with good carbonation. Easily drinkable without too much complexity and really not as much smoked malt as expected."

"It finishes light dry but still slightly sweet, malty and slight syrupy sticky, lots of lingering smoke and toasty Munich malt."
"Far from a rich, deep or creamy body, it does however have a presence. The alcohol is just about evident and it warms the mouth as the flavours begin to die away."
"NOTE: abv for this one is 6.9%"

"D- I would have this again, when I'm in a mood for rauchbier, but want something lighter."
"Cheers"
"Overall: Ordinarily it seems like if you take something great and make it bigger, you'll make it even better. However, I actually liked the Maerzen better than this Bock version. To their credit, the brewers at Spezial jacked up the bitterness to keep this Bock balanced, but while I didn't feel overwhelmed, I just felt like some of the nuances were lost. Definitely try this if you get a chance, but don't feel bad if you're there at a time other than late October through Christmas and you have to settle for the Maerzen."
"This bockbier poured a dark, coffee-brown color with light brown, sudsy foam that settled. The smell was malty and slightly tangy, but mild. The taste was malty with some caramel but not very sweet. There was a tanginess and a hint of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and malty with medium light body. There was a lingering tangy and hoppy aftertaste. The drinkability was good. This was a somewhat dry and easy to drink bock."
