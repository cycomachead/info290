"When I first heard about this beer, I went crazy with excitement. I love the fall and the smell of bonfires. I drank this beer out of a pint glass: it has a deep amber color with a strong head but when put against the light you can see the lightness to it. A very cool color. The smell was amazing: i felt like I was sitting next to a bonfire! However, after finishing half my glass, I was about done. The after taste of burning wood overwhelmed the overal positive taste of the beer, which was moderate at first but then got way too strong. A huge fan of Samuel Adams and their autumn harvest beers, I was disappinted by this. Will be sticking to Octoberfest and Harvest Pumpkin for the fall season from SA."

"3.9/5.00"
""
""

"This beer is smokey and taste like you are drinking a campfire I had it in a Octoberfest Collection from Sam Adams and drinking more one of these the taste might get bad but one is excellent."
""
""
""
"A style I'm trying to familiarize myself with and really can't drink a whole bottle quite yet. I do enjoy the first half and then after that it is too overwhelming for me. Dark orange almost brown pour, nice head. Aroma of smoke is dominant. Flavor is smokey with a bit of sweetness to round it out."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability - the style could wear me out after a bottle. I could drink a few of these, though, nice balance given the sometimes overbearing nature of the smoke for this style. A fine way to end the night as the smoke clears on the men's college hoops. Congrats to both Kentucky and Kansas for an excellent game."

"A nice amount of malts that don't overpower with a big smoky taste that is slightly sweet with caramel, toffee and a hint of coffee. Very easy to drink too."
"From memory. This was was rather smokey and pleasant, very much resembling the Bonfire name. Flavor was heavy heavy smoke, relatively light and easy to drink, and an interestingly smoky crisp finish. Not fantastic, but on of the more memorable from SA I had back in college. I imagine this is an awesome camping beer."

"I think this one is pretty tasty and may be a great beer to introduce folks to the style."

"O: Not as strong as other rauchbier's I've enjoyed. A solid intro to the style for those who might be put off by a more typical rauchbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium to full. It is pretty creamy and smooth. This is a rauchbier for Sam Adams lovers. Smokiness stands out without overwhelming the palate."

"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has a nice rich brown, reddish color body with a nice 1""foamy white head. The smell is smokey and with some malts. The taste is very smoke flavored up front with some carmel malts. A little bit of hops comes through. The mouth feel is really good. Overall this beer is really good."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are better smoked beers available."
""
"Serving: Bottle poured into Sam Adams Lager Pint"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice winter seasonal beer. Very pleasant yet bold, almost comparable to a fine cigar. Very similar with the strong smoky aftertaste."
"O - This beer was near its best by date and therefor leads me to believe it lost a little bit of its fresh smokiness and began to mellow out. Nevertheless the beer was complex enough in flavor and surprisingly refreshing."
""
"I'm not sure if they repitch the yeast to effect the smoke nature but this is overall a touch thinner than I anticipated for a rauchbier. I didn't sample the Sam's retired rauch bier so I have no basis to compare there. Rauchbier is a marzen or March beer and can be a bit higher in alcohol content."
"This poured out as a brown color with a fizzy cream colored head on top that had a pretty good retention. The lacing was very minimal. The smell of the beer was lightly smoked with I liked. There was enough smoke in there to tell you it's a Rauch but not too much that it makes me wanna gag. The taste was good too I though. Nicely balanced flavors of the malts and the smoke. The flavors weren't salty like some beers in this style. The mouthfeel was pretty typical of Sam Adams, it's a drinkable brew for sure. Overall I liked it, I thought it was a pretty good attempt at what they set out to do and I can see myself drinking this one again."

"It is rather smooth with light carbonation. Medium body. It's an okay beer, not particularly my favorite style though."
"Drinkability is very low. THe taste is so overpowering I can't taste anything else. I couldn't even finish this beer, and that does not happen very often with me."
"This is One of the better Sam Adams seasonals I've had. Sure beats the pants off the pupkin and the octoberfest."
"Overall: This is a pretty good Rauchbier. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. I would like to see this one more mass produced."
"Bonfire Rauchbier is pretty good beer. It’s a rather mild-mannered Rauchbier that would be a nice introduction to the style. The smoky aspect isn’t overly strong and complements the other elements well. It’s not very complex, but it is pretty good. Definitely worth checking out."

"O - Above average rauchbier that I would recommend but do not go out of the way to get it."
"D&Overall: Funny enough, I have met plenty of people who say they cannot stand this beer. Again, this is one of those styles you don't just sit down and try and immediately start to like. In fact, I remember trying one that was a Helles with smoked malts added, and not liking it at all. In this case, I think this brew with it's darker malts work very well with the moderate amount of smoked malt. Good work Sam Adams."
"D- One of the few American rauchbiers I've ever tried, and it was better than I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good, almost great rauchbier. Could use a bit of a cleanup on some of the rogue flavors. Glad to see them tackle the style though."
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma was classic for the style. Rich notes of smoke and peat were dominating the aroma. Lots of roasted malts and a slight touch of caramel as well as a bit of a green bitterness mixed in throughout. The flavor was much more of the same. Rich notes of peat and smoked tones were riddled throughout. Nice malted grain, with a roasted flavor in the middle as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown w/ amber highlights. Off white head disappeared pretty quick. Smells nice in a bacon-ey way. Some malt sweetness in the smell with no hop presence. Taste is quite smokey with some breadiness. Mouthfeel is a little watery which keeps it from getting to rich or heavy. Fantastic with some salty crackers topped with pepper-jack and dijon mustard. Looking forward to the second one in the fall pack and again next year."
"Got this one out of the fall sampler. Looks nice and smells like your typical rauchbier however the taste was way too smokey and artificial. Too much for me. I think sam adams went over the top with this beer. Almost like they used that fake liquid smoke stuff as an additive to the beer. I wont be drinking this one again."
"D- I was quite impressed for a Sam Adams Rauchbier. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. I would have liked a bit more smokiness."
"O: however I guess this still fits the style, but I'm not a fan of this whatsoever"
"Overall: Its a decent enough brew, but this is a really tough style to pull off and it demands some bravado. Sam Adams, with its tendency to make 'safe' beers, couldn't quite pull it off with this one."
"Rauchbier is an odd style for BBC to do, while not unwelcome it's just not a style I particular care for. With that said, this is probably one of the better ones to break a person into trying it.;"
"O - Not bad, I would drink it again for sure but I don't think I'd buy it again. I like that it's extremely easy to drink, and that it's well balanced. I don't like how thin the mouthfeel is, and I would like a stronger smoke flavor. Worth a try though. Cheers!"
"A surprisingly tasty offering from Sam Adams."
"My first go at a smoked beer, enjoyable but not sure if I'm digging the style to much."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, best before February. This pours a cola brown color with a decent tan head which quickly dissipates. The smell is mostly light, a little smoke. The feel is medium or light, smoke coats the mouth. The taste is very much of smoke, a mouth coating campfire smoke, pretty good."
"overall this is a pretty nice rauchbier. it doesn't have the intensity of some of the classic german offerings, but is approachable and drinkable. i'd drink more of this if it were available outside of the seasonal mixed twelve packs."
"Overall it's a nice Rauchbier. Exceeded my expectations. I recommend a try."
"This won't make you forget a good German version of this beer, and won't even give you a reasonable idea of how they taste, but it is much less expensive, so I would buy it again."
"Overall- It is a pretty good beer, it just doesn't go near far enough to even really be called a rauchbier. There are better rauchbiers out there definitely, but I guess for the curious drinker it would be an okay introduction to the style."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at Jan. Pours a translucent burnt orange color with a thin layer of head. Some lacing. Not much of a nose. Aroma is smokey with some spice and malts. Taste is a watered down smokiness with some oak and spice. Some sweet malt flavor as well with a bit of smoke at the end. Bit of an odd earthy aftertaste. Thin mouthfeel. Subdued, watery flavor overall. This was disappointing. Rauchbier is a style I really enjoy but there isn't a whole lot of it out there. While I am glad Sam Adams tried, this beer doesn't have that in your face taste and aroma you expect from the style. Just a subdued version for the average consumer."
"O-This is a solid offering from the fall mix pack. Just like with every mix pack there is a stand out and I think this is the one from this particular mix pack. It definitely feels like a nice fall night in front of the fire."
"o - a decent beer, but certainly not the best rauchbier i have tried. try one if you're feeling adventurous, otherwise keep looking."
"This one really needs to warm a little bit. The smoke flavor is consistent, and works surprisingly well with the lively, juicy mouthfeel. This is a mellow, but pleasant rauchbier. There is a nice, flavorful brown ale beneath the smoke that is quenching and very easy to quaff. Obviously plenty of smoked beers have a deeper, richer smoke flavor but this one s more drinkable in quanity than most that I have sampled."
"O- This is a good brew overall. As with most of the Sam Adams lineup this is a good, affordable representation of the Rauchbier style if you want to know what a rauchbier is. Is it the best? No. But its very well done."
"As with any rauchbier, if you know what to expect and are in the mood for it this is a decent example of the style. The smokey character is well balanced with the sweet malts."
"Overall: A pretty good take on a smoked beer from Sam Adams. Smoke forward but very well balanced."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and has somewhat of an interesting character. This would make for a good beer to have while sitting by a fire. It has a good drinkable feel and goes down easy."
"Overall: This beer does have a purpose besides making your face squirm, I would definitely use it in a marinade which it probably would excel in. I have had worse beers in my life but with the label of Sam Adams this is by far at the bottom of the list. If I had a slogan it would be ""looks good taste morbid"""
"Overall it is an okay beer. This is the only rauchbier I have ever tasted so it is hard to know if this is a good representation of the style or not."
"Overall: Bought the Samuel Adams' sampler pack, and this was one of the beers in it. It's a good beer, though personally I am not the biggest fan of the smokier flavors."
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a balance of smoke and sweet malt notes. Spicy and sweet up front with the smokiness lingering in the finish. Hints of sweet rye, caramel and hazelnut followed by some smokey character. Some BBQ, charcoal and bacon but the rauchbier characteristics are weaker than I prefer. They just kind of linger in the finish instead of dominating the beer."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice smoky flavor and fairly bold for Sam Adams. Not quite a traditional rauchbier, but a solid beer from BBC."
"I can't say I truly enjoy the beer, but it's much more a function of the style than the beer itself, which serves as a proper representation of the style."
"If you like the style this is a solid brew. A nice addition to their autumn sampler."
"I liked it in the beginning but it just didn’t go down well toward the end. Maybe it’s the style, but I don’t know."
"Overall - This came in a mixed pack i bought on a whim and is the only one i cared to rate, the only one that stuck out really. A pretty in the middle of the road rauchbier that is pretty enjoyable and of course great to crak on an october night. cheers!"
"Solid Rauchbier, especially for someone who is green to this beer style like myself. Worth the $$$ in my opinion."
"Overall, a really good beer; cheers!"
"Pours a dark, cloudy brown color with a thin head that disolves quickly. Smokey malts are the most noticable scent. You don't have to search for the tastes as the smoked malts hit the taste buds right away. Has a great body and texture to go along with its unique taste. For whatever reason it's pretty hard to find a smoked beer as I've only ever had 2 out of trying over 200+ beers. This one is delicous and probably one of my favorite Sam Adams products."
"Overall: This beer is a bit over the top for most beer drinkers. As for Rauchbier drinkers, it is pretty decent. I am not a huge fan of the style, but I wouldnt turn this beer down in the future."
"O - I am glad to have tried a beer like this, very interesting style. Smokey without being completely overpowering. Certainly not a regular drinker for me, but good nonetheless."
"Overall one of best smoked beers I ever had."
"I find this to be a generally tasty rauchbier, fairly middle of the road as it's a bit on the sweet and not-so-smoky side, but still very drinkable and a representation I'd visit again should it be available apart from others beers in the SA portfolio."
"O- not a bad sam adams brew bu then again Sam doesnt have too many bad brews. The aftertaste can linger a lil too much but other than that good brew."
"Overall, this is a slightly above offering from BBC. It was interesting to taste, but I think I'd reach for a Schlenkerla if I wanted a rauchbier."
"Samuel Adams Bonfire Rauchbier is a clear, sparkling, amber beer with a soft, pillowy, lumpy white head that has excellent retention and lacing. The first thing that comes to mind from the aroma is... apple? It smells smokey, like burnt pine, but the fruity smell is really strong. It's medium bodied and pretty smooth. The finish is dry and clean. It tastes smokey and resiny, but it's not over the top. There's a tart flavor that's fruity and malty. The smoke comes later in the taste and lingers through the finish. This is pretty tasty and pretty manly. I approve."
"Overall: A very genuine interpretation of the rauch style. I got this out of a Sam Adams' Fall sampler. Definitely worth the price because of this."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Overall, I am impressed."
"Smooth mouthfeel. Pretty good, but the smoke is a touch too string and eventually becomes offputting."
"poured in to a pint beer glass. Small head and copperish color. Smells of malts and smokey flavor to it. It taste just as the lable says malts and smokiness. mouthful is exceptional, the smokiness says it all!!! Overall an excellent beer to drink for all occasions"
"Overall, this is an unusual beer for me. And, although I don't absolutely love it, I'm not completely turned off of smoked beers. I'm glad I tried it."
"O - I haven't tried too many smoked beers, most have actually been homebrews, but this one isn't bad. I'm not sure how well it fits the style because of my limited tastes of the style, but it seems good to me."
"O: Overall a very nice beer. Something that would be great with some cheese, or sitting around a campfire."
"Relatively smooth, tail end of a campfire taste, relatively easy to drink for the style. No off tastes, hops or big challenges with this one, stays away from any meaty flavors. Mildly enjoyable, this is my kind of rauchbier."
"O: This one's not too bad, definitely not one of my favorite styles of beer. I'd be interested to find out what kind of wood they use, and to try different rauchbiers that use different kinds of wood. It's strange to me that I haven't found a rauchbier that I really like yet, because smoked foods and beer are two things I really like. Right now I'm wishing the combination of the two worked better for me."
"I liked this but not my favorite for the style. Falls well short of German counterparts."
"This is a good brew. It grew on me. The smokiness dominates the flavor at first, but other flavors creep in as this beer warms up. It tasted good on an autumn evening. It looks pretty decent, dark brown with a little head. The nose is all smoked malt. The taste s a little more crisp than I suspected. The mouthfeel is good. The fullness of the beer is matched with crispness . I would not seek it out again, but I would drink it if it were around."
"O: 3.5"
"Overall, this is pretty nice rauchbier here. Very pleasant to drink. I enjoy it."
"Overall: Like with most of Sam Adams' beers, this is an accessible, faithful example of a style. Not the best out there but still damn good for the price."
"I was really excited to taste this beer, but was somewhat dissapointed when I did. I poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured an amber color with a little giant white head that clung to the edges of the glass. I was expecting a very dark beer. The nose was sweet and malty, faint hops and smokeiness came through as the beer warmed. This was a medium bodied dry and drinkable beer. I just felt it did not remain true to the style. Rauchbier I have sampled in the past were very unique unsessionable beers."
"O- Too many weird meat flavors for me."
"Clear, deep brown with ruby highlights and a fluffy beige cap. Some clumpy lacing, decent head retention. Sweet and smoky aroma, caramel and a hint of fruit. Moderate bitterness, more smoke, caramel and chocolate, slight roast and bread. Medium to light bodied, moderate carbonation, decent texture. Overall, a smoked beer that I enjoyed and isn't over the top with smoky character."
"Nice with grilled strip steak and homemade steak sauce -- something to bring out the smoke!"
"Overall - I wasn't a big fan of this one. I see where they were going with this rauchbier, but the balance is a bit out of whack. I'd pass on this in the future."
"TGIF....first beer to celebrate the weekend is Sammy As Bonfire Rauchbier. I think Samuel Adams did another fine creation with this beer. Definitely has a great smoke aroma and flavor. The appearance is a nice clear amber with good carbonation that is giving a 1/2 finger thick head ...slightly off-white....and is lacing. The aroma has sweet malt and smoke. The taste start fairly mild almost seemingly light bodied. Then the sweet malt and smoke take over to finish the beer. Bonfire is easy on the pallet and does not linger. Thelower ABV helps to make the beer enjoyable and session worthy. Overall a decent beer."
"It has a pretty big and bold body with medium carbonation and has a great mouthfeel. Good drinkability as well. A nice brew included in the Harvest Collection."
"O: I like smokey beers, but this tasted like liquid smoke. It was almost too much. I know some people said they didn't get anything, but as soon as you opened the bottle it smelled like a campfire. If it was a little more balanced, and the smokey notes were so harsh, it would be better in my opinion. I don't see myself drinking this again."
"It's a good looking beer, a red-orange color with a good head. Smell is almost like a smoky Boston Lager. Taste? It, again, reminds me of a Boston Lager at first sip. That quickly goes away as a huge roasted and smoky aspect comes in. Delicious and bacony, it leaves a nice roasty feel on the tongue after it goes down. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but otherwise spot-on. It's also about average drinkability for the style. Overall, a good Rauchbier and a great slot-in on the seasonal mix. Not sure if I'd want a sixer of this, but two is great."
"CHEERS"
"O - What a solid Rauchbier! It's a little more tame that it's German counterparts, but it is actually more sessionable because of that. This would be a great ""into to the style"" beer. Tasty, savory, and complete. No complaints from me at all. Great Job BBC!"
"My first rauchbier, overall I like it on this cool fall evening. I'm sure it's a more tame brew than your typical German version, but it gives me the desire to definitely try the real thing to compare with!"
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of smoke, sweet malt, pale malt, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Rauchbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smoke, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, good feel and blend. Appearance is lacking and the body could be stronger and more complex, but still a decent rauchbier."
"Overall, a very enjoyable brew, and one I hope Sam Adams brings out more often."
"Copper amber color with a light beige head that settles out quickly. Low aroma of phenolic smokiness, a hint of a floral note, and a low biscuity maltiness. Even flavor of smoked malt, a bit of bacon and band aid, but subtle and well-balanced. Mild offsetting bitterness, but nearly no hop flavors or aromas. Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Very enjoyable beer, not over the top."
"O- Its too bad they don't sell this in 6-packs, defintely worthy of it for me since i enjoy unique smokiness to my beer. not too alcoholic and the flavors aren't too strong that they fatigue the palate."
"O: A nice smoked beer. Obviously not the type of beer that I would drink every day, but it's well balanced and it's different and it literally tastes like fall. I wouldn't mind having a few of these around to drink throughout the fall."
"T: This is definitely very smooth. I wanted a bit more smoke here, though. Brown sugar, roasted malts and a slight bit of faded hops with a hint of smoke in the background. Not a bad beer by any means but nothing that stands out in the category."
"overall, just not enough smoke to satisfy, if you want a rauchbier, stick to schlenkerla, straight intense smoke, which is what i like my rauchbiers to taste like. this is more of a beginer smoke beer. i would definatly drink this more on the warmer side."
"poured an amber color. smell was of a smokey malt sweetness. at first taste, the malt sweetness come to mind. after the malt flavor goes away, the smokey flavor of the malt comes in. leaves the mouthfeel with a hint smokeyness. not alot of a noticeable hops present, but still well balanced between hop, malt, smokeyness. overall, i thought this was a good beer."
"O - A truly delicious and perfectly Autumnal beer."
"Mouthfeel is rather light but plenty smooth. Overall, it would be hard to say this beer really compares with the best from Deutschland but certainly it's an enjoyable smoked beed. Would love to see more stuff like this on the shelves."
"Pours a light mud brown with a foamy head that fades fast. The smell is mostly a nice and smoky with malt and sweet notes. The smoke dominates the flavor but is not overbearing or annoying. The malt comes through, the mouthfeel is somewhat harsh, almost medium feel. The smoke fades after the first few sips as your palette gets used to the flavors and the malt comes through a bit bigger. Overall this beer is good, not as big of flavor as others in this style, but still good."
"Pours out a dark brown hue with a thin tan head that leaves some retention and good lacing. The nose has a pleasant hickory and mesquite smoked meaty flavor along with some dark fruits. The taste starts out with some caramel notes followed by the smoked flavors with some dark fruits and toffee in the back and finishing off with a hint of hops and more smoke flavor. It is a nice smooth and creamy light to medium bodied beer that is easy to drink leaving a little stickiness on the tongue. A very good beer from Sam Adams. This beer along with the black lager, pumpkin and Octoberfest makes the Harvest Collection a must buy for any beer lover."
"O: I have to ding this one a bit because I wanted more smoke flavor out of this. It's essentially a Boston Lager with lightly smoked barley. A welcome addition to their fall sampler, however, and hopefully this gives rise to more examples of this style in the U.S."
"Aftertaste: Marmalade on burnt toast"
"Overall I thought that this a good beer and pretty drinkable and balanced Rauchbier. I haven't had a lot of this style but this seems to be the most user friendly Rauchbier I have had and it would make a good introduction to the style, if this is too smokey for you, then Rauchbier's might not be your style. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it was smokey, but not overly so, and the aftertaste was full of caramel malts instead of having that smoke linger in your mouth like I find with most Rauchbiers. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, it needed more smoke to it, just by a aroma alone it would be hard to pin point that this is a Rauchbier, most Rauchbier let you know what your in for just by the aroma, this one didn't. I will be buying this beer again, I wish I could get it in six packs, but I guess I will have to deal with only being able to get two at a time in the fall mixed pack. I recommend this beer to anyone who wants to give this style a shot, the Rachbier veterans may want a more robust and smokey beer, but if you are just starting off then this is the beer for you. I had no clue what Samuel Adams could do with this style of beer, but I have to say that I am pretty impressed with their effort and I think that this beer will open a lot of people eyes to the wonderful world of Rauchbiers, it would be awesome if they make this available in six packs next year, I know I would keep some in the fridge all fall if I could."
"Really drinkable for the style, good depth, smoke doesn't overpower...I dig it. I'd love to see this become a regular in the mix pack."
"Part of the recent fall 12 pack. Poured a nice dark red color, with a bit of creamy white head. Pretty standard all around, both on the nose and on the palate. Some smokiness, sweet malt, a little caramel and an easy drinking medium body. Not bad but not much more."
"Dr: A lackluster attempt at a specific style that fails to embody its best aspects. Avoid this one if you're a true fan of rauchbiers. It doesn't even serve as a good introduction to the style for people who haven't ever had it."
"Pours a clear, dark copper with a creamy white head that settles to a nice ring and fluffy haze. Certainly smoky, with that signature SA toasted caramel malt backbone. Smoke is nice, slightly ""bacony"". Taste is similar to the nose, mostly that typical Sam Adams toasted caramel malt profile with a decent little addition of smoke. Imagine Boston Lager with a touch of bacon and you have this. Mouthfeel is moderately crisp, with a medium body and good carbonation. Overall an excellent addition to the Fall pack, and one of my new favorite SA beers. Bring this back next year!"
"I am glad I tried it, because I never had the rauchbier style of beer before. It is not bad, but it something that I just would not want to drink very often."
"Beautiful dark amber body with orange highlights. The aroma immediately brings to mind a nice smoky campfire. Very inviting. The body is a bit thin, but very smooth and quite drinkable. There’s a punch of bitterness up front that leads to a very light smoky, smooth flavor. The Rauchbier's I have been drinking have way more smoke to them, But this light level makes it way more easy to drink. Pretty good in the Fall Sampler."
"Clear amber-brown with a small off-white head. Fairly mild woody smoke over a typical Sammy lager yeast aroma. Slight toffee and maple. Smoky, toasty malt richness in the mouth. Again, a certain ""Sam Adams-ish-ness"" shines through in an appropriately clean, lagery way. Caramel and some light dried fruit round it out. Medium bodied with some fine, tingly carbonation, finishing dry. It's not going to unseat any of the Schlenkerla biers, but it's a welcome addition to the fall seasonal pack."
"The color is a very dark red color. It had a two finger off white head upon pouring into a pint class. It has a very smokey and caramel like smell. Upon tasting the smokey flavor was very evident. If you do not like smoked things this beer is not for you. There is also the subtle flavor of malts if you can get past the smokey flavor. The hops and other grains they claim to be in the beer are not readily apparent. Overall, it is an ok beer provided you are ok with the smoked flavor."
"Smoky malts are the main character of this beer, but that medicinal flavor distracts from some very nice caramel flavors. I can taste some of the toffee flavors noted on the bottle, but there is a cloying quality to the beer that throws the balance off. I see what they were going for with the smoked malts and they nearly succeeded and would have if not for the off flavors. They did create a very rich, malty beverage though, and for that its not all that bad. Overall, this isn't my favorite from BBC, but its good to see them doing interpretations of different styles regardless."
"Overall ok. Not a bad smoked beer. The bottle talks about caramel and toffee and I didn't find much of either. Although roasty and smoked, kind of watered down."
"Some herbal hops and smoked wood dominate the palate with caramel provide good balance. Long, dry finish. I liked this brew after a second time."
"I like this. It's a decent example and perfect for the beginner to this style. Worth it."
"O: Meh. Another mediocre offering in this seasonal variety pack. Perhaps I am just not keen to these styles. I'll pass next time."
"O- Not too bad of a beer but is kind of 1 dimensional but cant complain for 2 in a great 12 pack"
"O = good drinking beer to add to a fall collection. Can drink 1 or 2 by a fire. Could also drink 5 when tailgating."
"O-An interesting beer to say the least, my first Rauchbier, the smokiness was nice but there didn't seem to be anything to balance it out."
"O - Another out of the fall mix pack. Not too familiar with the style, but seems to be a pretty solid offering."
"Poured into a pint glass, the beer was a copper color with a tinted head. The beer gave a mildly smokey aroma that was more malt than smoke. With a smoke beer, I anticipate a potent smokey flavor. Why else would you call it a smoke beer? Bonfire Rauchbier produces a watery fruity taste with disguised hints of the smoke flavor. The mild aftertaste produces the greatest sense of the smokey flavor, but still fails to live up to the standards of other smoke beers. There is a greatest sense of tart fruits than anything else in the flavor. For a rather robust beer style, this is far too mild."
"D: Needs more smoke! I can understand why Sam Adams might pull back a bit on this style as they probably want to avoid scaring Gomers from trying any more of their mixed seasonal pack. But they are probably going to hate it anyways so why not just go whole hog on this?"
"Pours a brown amber with a slightly off-white head which bubbles down quickly, leaving a ring clinging to the edge of glass. I wasn't so sure about including ""bonfire"" in the name but after a wiff and a taste I think it fits. Smells like wood smoke, on second wiff it smells more like cheap smoked meat, not off putting but not super appetizing. The smoke smell is found in the taste as well, it dominates a mild hop and medium malt body. Drinks well. Mild carbonation boils finely off of back of tongue, some of the smoke taste makes its way through my nose. Overall an interesting because I am not familiar in the style. As I find with Sam's this brew is OK but not full, it lacks robustness. Glad to have it as part of Sam's fall variety pack."
"O-I like to use my smoker so whats not to love with smoked beer I wish this came in 6 packs and not just in the fall sampler"
"Overall certainly not my favorite beer, and not all I cracked it up to be. I think maybe if I had gone into it without the presumption that this would be great, I would actually be a bit more impressed. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either."
"Overall: They were putting themselves out there with this one, and unfortunately it falls flat. I wanted to like it too."
"Overall: Again, I'm neither accustomed to nor apparently a fan of this style. The bottle was difficult for me to finish, and I'm glad there are only two in the sampler. If you're a fan of smokey beers, though, give it a try."
"Possibly the best US made traditional rauchbier I've had?"
"Overall: A good, very drinkable rauchbier. No overpowering elements, smoked element is not overly assertive."
"Cheers!"
"This pours a nice, smoky auburn. A shade lighter than the bottle it came in, a tinge of ruddy reddish-brown. There’s a muted whiff of smoke on the nose, very subtle. Not anywhere as dominant or overpowering as some of the other, bolder smoked beers I’ve tried. But don’t be fooled, on the first sip you’ll definitely catch the smoked presence. This one finishes dry—and sharp. Very enjoyable. Pleasing. Even as it warms. I’d buy a sixer of this, especially for the price that SA beers go for. Overall another solid brew from these guys. I’d love to see Sam Adams introduce the masses to rauchbiers by promoting this guy."
"Overall it was kind of what I expected from a Rauchbier, a strong smoke characteristic which basically took over in the flavor department at the finish."
"Overall, again, not the biggest fan of this style, but this is really good for the style in my opinion. My wife is usually the smoked beer person in the house, but she's had to fight me over these."
"New in the variety pack, let's give it a try. Pours out a dark, copperish color with a tan head. The smell is mighty smokey, with some faintly detectable spicey hops in the background. The taste is a very smokey, then slightly sweet, malty, with a slight dry aftertaste. I have to admit this is my first Rauchbier. This beer would go great at a an autumn campfire, or with some good hickory smoked BBQ brisket or pork sausage. The mouthfeel is adequate and full, slightly prickly and carbonated, but still smooth. Overall I like this beer as it is a nice change of pace but I could never imagine drinking very many of these. But I am glad they packaged a few for the variety pack."
"O-i've had a few rauchbiers at this point, and this is by far the best that i've had...and that is saying a lot because i happen to be a fan of the style. i don't know why, but i love the smokey taste of bonfire, and this beer captures it very well, while adding a bit more to the table. i'm down right impressed with Samuel Adams on this one, it might be one of my favorites from them!"
"Overall this was enjoyable. It's malty goodness, yet not as smokey as other rauchbiers. It's consistent in being a solid-yet-not-astounding brew from Sam Adams. Just like they always make. I wouldn't turn down another."
"O: If forced to pick one of this style.,...this gets the nod. That said. Not a style I enjoy. Part of the Fall pack. I respect the effort."
"O: Not overly smoked, nice flavor, balanced and light. Pretty good beer."
"A bit on the lighter body side, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is hidden. Enjoyable."
"O- I think you either like or hate smoked beer. So if you like them you will probably like this. Otherwise you'll hate it."
"O: I haven't had many rauchbiers in my day because there just aren't enough people out there making them or distributing to CT anyway. Sam has managed to homogenize a unique style with its typically bland yeast but all told, its not a bad idea as a niche fall beer."
"Pours a very nice coppery-brown color with good head and decent lacing. Wonderful thick and hearty scent with some nice sweetness and a wonderful smokiness in the nose. Great flavor, a nice malty thickness with some nutty attributes and a wonderful hearty smoky flavor that goes great on a cool and rainy night on the back porch. Went down quite well, given the smokiness."
"Dry, salty finish, medium body but feels thinner than a porter. I guess it is a black ale. Better than expected, but I couldn't do a lot."
"Overall: Not great, but a suitable, approachable smoked beer."
"Overall this brew was average to decent for me. I couldn't see myself drinking more than one of these at a sitting, but if it were all that were available I probably wouldn't turn it down."
"This is my first rauchbier (other than half of one a few years ago) so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it's pretty good. After a few sips it really starts to grow on me. I like it, and I'm definitely going to seek out other rauchbiers soon."
"Overall, a nicely easily drinkable smokey brew, i like a bit more smoke and less sweetness is my smoked brews."
"SkÅL!"
"Not bad, and likely a great starter for someone exploring the style for the first time."
"O: not as seriously smoky as some other rauchbiers I have had, but tasty in its own crowd-pleasing way."
"Overall, this is a pretty tame Rauchbier. I'm glad Boston made this, but it doesn't stand up to the best of the breed."
"Not awful, but could be much better with a few tweaks."
"Pours a dark amber brown with a two finger dirty white head that has good retention, no lacing left on the glass as the head resides. The aroma is full of roasted malts, clove and a nice smokiness. The taste puts the initial smoke in your mouth that fades quickly with a rich molasses and malty notes. A lighter mouthfeel then I would hope for but the carbonation feels good. This is a good beer, I wish there was a tad more smoke but it would be a very good way to introduce people to smoked beers."
"O - This has good drinkability. I could easily drink a sixer of this stuff. Overall, I think this is a solid rauchbier. It's certainly no Aecht Shlenkerla, but I would say a great introduction into this style that is probably off-puttiing to non-craft drinkers out there. I am glad that BBC is doing styles like this and I think it really is helping people drink what they normally would not, since more likely than not this will the first rauchbier most people ever try. Anyways, I think it is a nice beer, and I would buy it again."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a chestnut brown coloring that carries a big, puffy, fluffy, chunky yellow-ish head that weighs in around an inch and a half. The nose is sweet and rich, with meat like characters, and a hint of charcoal. The beer has a very unique flavor, and it can best be described (by me, at least) as an all beef hotdog freshly cooked over fire. Wow, very unique. The meaty flavor also coincides with a slightly greasy and slick feel in mouth, which completes the palate picture in my mind. The aftertaste is semisweet and slightly smokey, and the beer finishes quickly, with a slight tangy sweet linger at the back of the tongue. Interesting."
" O - I can't say I have had many beers of this style, but based on this, it is not high on the list. This beer is worth trying ( what beer isn't?) but I won't be seeking it out any time soon."
"This thin, insubstantial, fake-tasting Rauchbier isn't exactly terrible. It is quite drinkable and serves as a sort of entry-level Rauchbier. A sessionable Rauchbier, if you will. I won't seek it out again, but it isn't thoroughly bad."
"Overall this is an above-average Rauchbier. It's smokier than others I've tried while not being overwhelming."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of the Fall mixed 12pk at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a crystal-clear amber body with nearly an inch of light tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Smoke and wood dominate the aroma with some malt, nut, and vanilla notes. Wood and smoke dominate the flavor too, with vanilla, nut, and caramel notes in the background. Medium to light in body with moderate carbonation. A fairly easy drinker. I will admit that I am not a huge fan of the style, but this one is balanced and nuanced and doesn't clobber you over the head with the smokiness. An interesting addition to the fall lineup."
"Eh, a letdown, but I probably expected too much from it."
"Excited to try another new fall seasonal from Sam Adams. This one pours clear mahogany colored with fizzy, bubbly, tan head that dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a solid layer atop the beer. The aroma is malty, lots of bread and caramel. As it opens up the smokiness comes out. It's neither too subtle nor too bold. I've certainly enjoyed smokier offerings but this is a pretty good balance. The flavor is a bit more up front with the smoke. Meaty and earthy, with a touch of malty sweetness. Full bodied, a bit flat as far as carbonation goes though. Something different but tasty for Sam Adams and a good beer for a rich hearty, meal."
"Overall, this fits in perfectly with the rest of the fall pack, a pretty toned down version of a traditional style. Faint hints without really blowing your hair pack, simplistic, but good. Cheers!"
"Ok, I admit – this is my very first Rauchbier ever. My palate was certainly not prepared for this one. But hey, I guess that would make this a totally unbiased review then."
"A nice fall offering and overall a tasty and easy to drink beer. Great addition to the fall variety pack."
"Nice to see SA make a foray into the style,to bad the results were not better.Poured into a becker a clear bronze with almost no head at all to speak of,very uninspiring pour here.Aromas mainly of caramel malt with faint smoke,sweet on the palate with caramel flavors and a tinge of fruit,the smoke is subdued and relegated to a minor role.Eh just very average and uninspired in my opinion."
"O: Horrible. I would rather not drink beer than ever drink this again."
"O: a decent representation of the style, good taste, weak appearance, ok overall"
"Part of the new Sam Adams mixed 12 pack. An odd style, but one I actually really like so looking forward to this one. Pours a nice deep brown, small tannish-brown head to it. Nice toasted smell to it. Taste is medium bodied, the smokiness really shines through. Reminds me of drinking a nice beer by a campfire and feeling the ashiness (in a good way) of being near the open flame. Good use a tad more flavor, but the mouthfeel and creaminess of it are perfect. Spot on Sam Adams, another solid stab at a rare style, too bad there's only 2 in the pack."
"As a campfire beer, I think this one would rock pretty well. Labeled as a rauchbier, however, it is lackluster."
"Overall- Decent beer. Not very complex, but not one dimensional either. I wouldn't buy a whole six pack, but nice to have once in a while. 3.5/5"
"O - Overall I like this one, kinda different and reminds me of a barrel aged brew. If you like flavor you will like this one, kinda complex but not too much for the average drinker. Not bad! Came in the 2011 ""Harvest Pack""."
"O- Not too bad. Not my top pick of the Sam Adams beers but I think this one would be a great one to drink on a night when the air gets that first chill of fall in it. Since that time is almost here I look forward to trying this one again."
"Pretty good stuff if you are in the mood. The smokiness is in-your-face from the get-go. Looking forward to trying more beers of this style."
"Pours amber orange with a fluffy head. Decent retention and really nice lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is sweet and malty.Nice and crisp,with somke through out,but espically in the finish. Very good stuff."
"O- Not a bad rauchbier. This isn't a style that I would go back to often, but this is pretty good."
"Overall this is a nicely balanced smoked beer; honestly this is really a tasty Scottish ale."
"I've been waiting for the Harvest Pack to come out, just so I could try this one. Let's do it: It pours a clear copper topped by a finger of relatively short-lived dirty tan foam. The nose comprises mild hickory-smoked ham, caramel, and a touch of maple syrup and molasses. The taste amps up the smokiness of the ham, whilst still keeping the sweetness of the caramel and maple syrup around in good measures. The smoke becomes darker, more pronounced the further you indulge in this liquid. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a nice little rauchbier, not up to the levels of the Germans, but still a generally enjoyable experience."
"Overall - Not bad. This is my first rauchbier so I don't know how it compares with others in this style. One or two of these are enjoyable but I think more than that would be too much."
"Pours an almost-clear, amber color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is smokey, like smoked ham...with a bit of toasty malt aromas. Taste initially tastes like a slab of delicious smoke breakfast ham. Once you get used to the smokiness, the malt flavors really kick in. Finishes fairly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very tasty. Overall, this is a very tasty Rauchbier. Love the smokiness and drinkability."
"O- I really enjoy this beer. It's the only rauchbier I've tried, and honestly I'm looking for more smoke. Now I grew up in Southeast Texas and have eaten heavily smoked barbecue all my life, so maybe that's why. I enjoy the smoke, love the style and look for to expanding my rauchbier experience. Cheers!"
"Overall: While something of an Americanized take on the style (slightly different smoke character, less malt depth/intensity) this is actually a pretty ballsy little number from BBC. Definitely a nice addition to the fall variety pack!"
"This was kind of a shock for me, I didn't expect Sam to take a chance at a relatively limited style like this. Definitely a solid offering - I'd definitely keep an eye out for this on tap!"
"12oz bottle. Pours an amber brown in color with a large yellowish head that soon disappears. Fairly strong aroma of smoked malts, birch wood, and a little caramel. In the flavor, a meaty smoke taste, undertones of caramelized malt and brown sugar. Even balance, mild tea like hops are on the outskirts of flavor town. Not intense, but for those not used to the style I can see it being so. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and thin. Overall, a nice little Rauchbier and a testament to the Samuel Adams brewery's prowess."
"D: Not bad, the smoke is really ""in your face"" but not off putting. Wouldn't be able to drink more than 1 or 2 of these in a sitting though."
"O - A very nice Rauchbier. Probably the most approachable and sessionable of the style that I've had. It has that Sam Adams character but is complemented well by a prominent but not overpowering smokiness. A good seasonal outing for a company who has some less than stellar brews they throw in to these seasonal mixpacks."
"O: Not awful, but the smoke is really overpowering and it's hard to drink more than a half glass of this stuff. The brats turned out great though."
"O - This is surprisingly a good beer to style. I'm quite impressed. I think there is a blend of cherry and beechwood smoked malts here, which makes for an interesting combination. It retains the authentic Bamburg taste with a bit of the American edge. Very well done - cheers!"
"O: This beer lets the smoke be well known for sure. Like I said though, it gets a tad too much after one beer so the drinkability isn't very high at all. Definitely enjoyable, though. And, as the name suggests, this would probably be best around a campfire or something with s'mores to help balance out that smoky sweetness/saltiness a little bit more"
"Overall it was a very enjoyable beer. Not one I would have more then one of at a time, but I enjoyed this beer a great deal."
"T- I enjoy the beer. The beer is very drinkable. At the same time though, the taste disappears very quickly."
"This is a very easy-drinking Rauchbier, and one I'm sure will bring more brewers into the mix. Coming soon, Imperial Rauch!"
"O - An enjoyable beer that I will definitely enjoy the next time I see it. It does well for the style, if maybe a little too moderate for such an out-there style of beer. This is a great rauchbier to give people who have never had rauchbier before. I'm glad that despite their size and profile that Sam Adams is still doing interesting things with their beers and making styles that may not appeal to a mass market."
"overall - Not overly complex, but carries a relatively unique flavor when it comes to beer. Very reminicent of hanging out by a bonfire and walking away and still smelling/feeling the smokeyness on you."
"O - Not really buying this as a rauchbier. The intense smoky flavors & aroma's that are normally present in a rauchbier are just not there. I get a little bit of smokyness, but not a lot. It's kind of a mainstream, toned down, version of a rauchbier. Not sure if I would buy this one again."
"Cheers!"
"Mouth feel and overall - Tingles and simmers on the tongue. The smokiness is tasty and one of a kind, but can get a little strong and repetitive since it lingers strongly on your tongue between sips. I reccomene sipping this to get the most out of the flavor. Drinking it too quickly turned me off for a bit. A bit carbonated."
"Had this beer for the first time while camping around a fire. It poured a nice copper color with a solid head. The smell is mostly od of roasted malt, you can tell they roasted it. The taste is very very smokey and pleasant. Mostly of roasted malt and caramel. the mouthfeel is very creamy. This beer is good, perfect for fall or around a fire."
"OVERALL - not one of my favorite styles but brings to mind sitting around a campfire which is always a good thing"
"Id say the smoke level is right at about medium, maybe a little under. Toast and caramel make up a healthy malt backbone...Im guessing it would be an Amber Ale if the smoke was removed. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but not too much to complain about. Its fairly pleasant, I wouldnt mind a heavier smoke flavor but it is a pretty solid effort from BBC."
"O: A quite good example of the style. This will not give you the sheer intensity and power of Schlenkerla, but it's clearly well made."
"Overall I am quite impressed with this offering and even though I haven't had many of the style I can say this one is the best so far."
"Pours a brown color with dark red hues and a filmy tan head. The smell is mostly smoky wood with some sweet malt and a hint of bacon. It tastes of burnt bacon, there is a slight tang to it and it has a bitter smoky finish. This beer is very smooth with a medium body, moderate carbonation and a dry finish. I thought this was a good beer, the smoke isn't too powerful and it has a nice balance between sweet and bitter."
"I tend to like beer with smoked hops a lot and this bonfire from sam adams is another good one. The color is a rich brown. The smell almost reminds me of a smokey cheese (but in a good way). The flavor is a miriad of malt and smokey hops all swirled together.there is also a rich sweetness on the rear end. This rauchbier is also very smooth and drinkable. I got this beer is avariety pack- I've never seen it on it's own- but if I did I'd def. Buy it."
"I really enjoyed this beer, I really enjoyed the sampler from Sam Adams the fall sampler is bringing their A game. Black Lager, Pumpkin, Boston Lager, Irish Red, Bonfire, Oktoberfest. Not a bad beer in the variety pack, this just happens to be the new release, pours a deep mahogany ruby tinted brown color with light beige head forming thick and leaving behind intricate lacing. Aroma has a nice air of smoked malts, a bit of charred wood, smoked meat but really compared to some of the German Rauchbiers out their this comes of mild with the smokiness the other elements that come to play included a nice caramel roasted toffee darker malt profile and light herbal hops. Flavor wise this beer is nice especially with smoked meats enough sweetness to balance but rich with smoked malts to add another level of complexity to whatever you're eating. Medium bodied big fall seasonal definitely wouldn't mind pairing this with a bonfire, perfect cooler weather beer too bad it's still August and balmy. I have a feeling we will be seeing this around until late fall, again great drinkable version of a classic German style."
"Overall, I want MORE MORE MORE!!!! I really want a Imp version of this, cranked up to 7% and loaded with smoke! Do yourself a favor, if your reading this and you haven't tried it, go get it immediately! If you like smoked beers and foods, you'll be glad you did! Cheers!"
"Overall: Pretty impressive. It doesn't match the best from Bamberg, but it'll do."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid caramel and roasted malt scent along with a powerful smoked malt aroma. It's dry with significant smoke character. The taste is decent. It has an aggressive smoked malt flavor with a touch of roasted and caramel balance. It lacks adequate malt complexity and is a bit one sided. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty beer that isn't afraid to showcase the rauchbier smokiness, however it's lacking the caramel malt sweetness to round out the taste."
"The smokiness takes away from the drinkability here, but this is still a drinkable beer, and a welcomed addition to the fall mixed pack."
"The beer is burnt orange with a small, off white head. The aroma is of smoke, malt, light peat, sweetness. Decent flavor. Smoke is there, but sweet malt overtakes it. This is a decent brew, but not on the same level as Aecht Schlenkerla's masterpieces. Worth a try."
"fantastic rauchbier. certainly the greatest mass-produced rauchbier on the market. i would still take an aecht schlenkerla or a rogue smoke ale over this any day, but this definitely fixes my smoke craving."
"Overall, it's ok but it's rauchbier light. Or perhaps lite (wink)."
"An amber/caramel color with a nice head that quickly dissapates. The flavor is indeed smoky but not overwhelming. A little like beef jerky or smoked turkey made liquid! (Nice) This would be better in the colder months, since it leaves a nice warming feel."
"M/O: Very bubbley but overall an interesting interpretation of the style. Very rich flavors but i was slightly surprised to see it included in the mix pack."
"Overall a decent effort, but I could use more of everything. More smoke, more spiciness and a bit more bitterness from the hops, more real malt character instead of the subdued sweetness that poses in its place."
"This is the shortest review I've written. This beer completely rubbed me the wrong way. The fact that it probably won't rate as the worst beer I've reviewed is a testament to how bad some other beers can be, but this is in no way good. It tastes like campfire hotdogs. Good for hotdogs, bad for beer."
"O - a good example of the style."
"A good drinkable introduction smoke brew. Enough smoke to enjoy but not enough to blow you away. Not sure if this will be a keeper."
"Let me start by saying Sam Adam's Rauchbier is a smoked ale. That being said, it should turn a few people off right away. I'm generally not a fan, but it was in the Fall Harvest pack, and I won't turn away new beer. It's a darker color, not anywhere near porter, but still darker than your usual ale. The first sip tastes of smoked wood immediately followed by heavy malt. The mouthfeel reflects this flavor; very heavy and coats your entire mouth. If you are a fan of the smoke variety, I do expect you will like this, but if you're like me you should let this one ride."
"Available as part of Samuel Adams Seasonal 12 pack."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. While this is my first Rauchbier, I must say this beer is really good. I'd be pleasantly surprised if they get much better than this. I'd say it would be worth getting the Sam Adam's Fall Mix Pack just for this one."
"D - as a huge fan of rauchbiers, my review is a bit biased. This is definitely one of the better Sam Adams brews in my opinion. They really nailed the traditional rauchbier profile! Considering that we don't get very many smoked beers in my area, I easily welcome this brew!"
"I like it."
"Can't wait to pair this with various foods."
"A style often underrepresented, this beer is an absolute home run. This smokey meaty Rauchebier has all bases covered. Smokey enough to make your eyes water."
