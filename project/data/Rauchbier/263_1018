There's really no reason to feel intimidated here as the singed, rough-hewn wood notes are even more deeply entwined with sweet malt, fruity esters, and spicy/savory phenolics. It's one that'll certainly change peoples' impressions of beer.","biegaman","Mar 31, 2015"

Didn't know what to expect with Weizen (other than a recent newfound appreciation for weizens), but this one jumped the tracks pretty quickly. Totally could be an old bottle issue, and I'd happily revisit it again to make sure, but for now I have to score it low. Best way to describe it would be BBQ-flavored potato chips. Literally smelled salty, the weisse bier notes just couldn't be found, too muddled in with the salty, BBQ smoked malt. I choked down as much as I could before waving the white flag. Again, hope to find it on tap someday to verify these findings.","breadwinner","Mar 09, 2015"

4.43,13.3,4,4.75,4.5,4,4.25,"Pours a hazy medium amber from the yeast.  Exceptional massive head, lacing and retention.  An almost perfect nose of meaty bacon like smoke balanced against a fruit like sweetness with a slight spicy note.  The smoke aroma is not as intense as their Marzen and Urbock variants and is expertly balanced with sweetness.  Light medium body that is somewhat slick in texture, but also has a grainy wheat aspect as well.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish and middle.  The outstanding flavor profile is not as intense as their other variants. It is more balanced with malt sweetness and a bit more complex.  The delicious smoke character is always present, but never overpowering. It begins with a moderate campfire bacon like smoke over a sweet background that has both biscuit and caramel characteristics. The middle allows the hops to impart a rather low level bitterness that has a clove like note as it effervesces and a banana quality as it fades. The finish is dryer than the others, somewhat crisp, sweeter and leaves you with a touch of clove and a lingering smokiness as if you've sitting around a campfire. Outstanding and an excellent introduction into the Rauchbier style that is not quite as intense as their Marzen and Urbock variants.","tillmac62","Nov 05, 2014"

After having a couple sips, sweet malts with bubblegum can be tasted. Later through the beer some banana comes up. The aftertaste is dry and mildly smoky. At first there's nothing but smoke in the taste, more weizen-like towards the end. Medium-light body, medium mouthfeel, a bit watery mouthfeel.

Pours very hazy deep reddish brown color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of banana, clove, toast, brown bread, wood smoke, wheat, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with well balanced fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and wood smoke notes; with good strength. Taste of banana, clove, toast, brown bread, wheat, wood smoke, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, clove, toast, brown bread, wheat, wood smoke, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and wood smoke flavors; with a great smoke/yeast/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately crisp/creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice smoked weizen. All around well balanced fruity/spicy yeast ester, dark/bready malt, and wood smoke flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

Smell is wonderful aroma of warm smoked meat & leather. Taste follows the smell as smoked malt followed by the tart cloves and a touch of sweetness. Mouthfeel is unexpectedly light and carbonation is weak and this is where this beer comes up short. It's a nice change of pace from a weissbier or dunkles weissbier but I'd think twice before paying $5/bottle for another one.","Bayern1971","Dec 31, 2013"

3.3,-15.6,3,3.5,3.25,2.75,3.5,"It's a pretty straightforward beer. It smells like burnt birch branches and it tastes like beef jerky encrusted with barbecue flavoured potato chips. This a beer style all its own. So unique, in fact, that the characteristic flavour profiles dominate to the extent that it's really difficult for anything to come through that reminds us this is beer. It could just be some sort of beef jerky flavoured soda or maybe fermented, diluted barbecue sauce. That said, it's not bad, really. It's probably an acquired taste for most. My chief complaint is that it's not thicker. For something this robust, my palette demands that it be thicker. If it tastes like I'm eating wood-smoked meat, I don't want it to feel like I'm drinking water. You know? I crave the consistency of a stout or at least a doppelbock when I'm drinking this. I also wish some maltiness could come through to complement the smoked meat flavour. It's got a really basic flavour to how dominant that smokiness is. I know that's just the way this style is meant to be, though, so I shouldn't really be applying that to my criticism of this specific example. I really do hope I come across a version of this that's got a thicker mouthfeel one day, though. That'd be pretty great.","ElCommodoro","Sep 18, 2013"

Head is one inch, dense, fluffy and off-white. Nose expresses a hint of smoke and some dark fruits (similar to a weizebbock in character) with a trace of clove and banana esters towards the back. Taste is quite mild on all accounts - smoke is very subdued but masks a lot of the character of a typical weizen. There is a bit of fruitiness, but it's really a bit muddled, There's also a slight herbal/peppery quality to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to light, with a carbonation that is not quite crisp, but does have a bit of a bite. Definitely an interesting take on the style, but not really something I would look for in a wheat beer.","Jwale73","Apr 27, 2013"

Flavor is light wheat with complex smoky wood elements, finishes somewhat dry and smokey. The smoke dominates the light wheat and malt flavors, but is still pleasant; the maltier styles seem to blend their character with the smoke a little better than this and I miss the weizen flavors.

The aroma is a robust combination of smoked meat, earth, crusty bread, and only a whisper of a wheaty tang. The flavor similarly features a rich, smokey complexity, and yet rather than being overpowering, it provides more of a soft, comforting woodiness. With the smoke largely dominating the flavor, the wheat is not featured, but merely provides a light, dry cereal sweetness. The texture is light on the tongue without being watery, and a fine, prickly carbonation cuts through the meaty substance. Overall, the smoked characteristic is apparent up front, but it is well controlled, making this a beer that I would be happy to have again.","devilben02","Jun 08, 2012"

Oily, spicy, and wonderfully meaty, this is a great smelling Rauchbier! Weizen flavors of banana and clove come through in the flavor, only to be swallowed up by more of that fishy smoke. I gotta admit, the Weizen backbone isn't as appealing to me as the more traditional Marzen, I just feel the caramel/malt flavors stand up to (and compliment) the smoke better. Still good, though. My qualms with the Weizen backbone carry through to the mouthfeel, I could definitely go for something a bit more substantial. As is, we're looking at a touch-under medium-bodied, slightly creamy, with moderately crisp carbonation. Overall a very solid addition to Schlenkerla's wonderful Rauchbier lineup, but certainly not my favorite.","jsanford","Oct 28, 2011"

Tan head, with some floaties in the body (maybe I shouldn't have poured the yeast in?). Big sticky lacing, great retention and good amounts of carbonation stream up from the bottom of the glass. Nose has some smoked bananas, wheat and a touch of spice that the smoke has overtaken. Beautiful smoked wood/meats in true Schlenkerla fashion. Taste has a faint sourness at the beginning (although this disappears with warmth), with a creamy and chewy mouthfeel initially revealing some bananas and smoked wood/malts. Thins out as it moves over the palate, leaving behind more smoke. Mouthfeel starts off fuller than it finishes; residual smoke on the palate and a faint sense of the weizen.

There's also some aromas of burnt wood - kind of like after a bonfire finally goes out. Reminds me of a summer campfire BBQ. Tastes similar to taste with some bitterness towards the end after some sweet, crystal malt character. Light in mouthfeel but bitterness is rather even balanced with the smoked malts.

The smoke and weizen yeast work together masterfully and the malt character softens everything to the point that it is perfectly drinkable.

It is incredibly murky and really doesn't let any light pass through it. There is also a moderate amount of sediment on the bottom. It certainly wasn't what I expected. The aroma is really only of smoked malt but it isn't nearly as smoky as their other beers. And when smoke is the main aroma, you can't really pick up anything else. The flavor, interestingly enough is of both mild yeast and lightly smoked malt. It's interesting because you get a slight, watered down ham flavor paired with the flavor of bread after it's been dipped in pea soup. It's interesting to say the least. And the more I think about it, the more I get that pea soup flavor. It drinks alright but it's nothing overly appealing. It's just kind of an odd pairing. I just can't like this one as much as their others but it's an interesting try.","aasher","Jun 02, 2011"

Pours muddy chestnut brown body with mahogany highlits topped by thick, moussy, extremely stable beige crown that clings to the walls and although slowly shrinks never dies.The aroma is bacon-like smokiness masking the qualities of the underlying beer although bananaish notes emerge together with bready, doughy wheat-malt. The flavor is dominated by bacon-like smokiness with greasy notes and burnt wood touch rolled in wheat perceived as bread, followed by low hoppy bitterness towards the finish which is quite dry due to the moderate carbonation and smoke. The wheaty texture imparts creamy fullness to the body. Unfortunately the bananaish sweetness combined with bacon is quite odd and reduces the the drinkability. Although the color is dark the flavor/aroma profile reminds me more of a classic Weizen than Dunkelweizen. There was no caramel or toasty-melanoidin qualities typical of Wienna and/or Munich malt used in Dunkelweizens. Besides, the color of the Rauchbier is usually darker than the color of the non-smoked base style, explaining the dim appearance.","crnipeter","Jan 17, 2011"

I just feel that the rauchbier tendencies, roasted malts, smokiness and woodiness dominate the beer. There is some mild sweetness in this that I haven't had from other rauchbiers along with minor hop notes that balance it a little and make it quaffable, it's just not even.

While that bre was all massive ham nd bacon, the smoke aroma here immediately recalled smoked fish...not n a bad way. Perhaps the sour wheatiness conveys smoked trout rather than bacon. The smoke is huge on the nose, but doesn't overwhelm the palate as much as the Marzen. The smoke is intense, unique, delicious, but the tart character of a good German wheat beer is identifiable: lighter, a hint of clove and even banana if you concentrate. Long long somky finish.

No real malt flavors there, though there is almost a citric, acidic tartness to it that lets you know you're drinking a weizen. Slightly bitter finish.

3.89,-0.5,3,4,4,3.5,4,"An interesting beer for those who like both wheat beer and rauchbier, although it might be too much of two good things at once. As with other Aecht Schlenkerla smoke beers, the smoke is front, front, front and center, and it dominates everything. I happen to like this, but I found that the wheat added a thickness that took a bit of time to get used to. And by then I had finished the beer! The color is a not-very attractive cloudy beef-broth brown, and the aroma is all leather and smoke-- not quite so hammy as the Urbock, but still unmistakable. Regular wheat characteristics are muted but present, although I'm not sure that smoke and bananas are a good combination. Still, I enjoyed this beer and would of course have another. Start with a Schlenkerla Urbock before trying this one, however.","gfreed","Jul 11, 2008"

Velvet body with a bit of zip and lasting flavor that coats your lips and mouth. I wasn't to sure if I would like the beer by the sent, but surprisingly like Schnider in esters.

Taste-wise, the wheat creeps through, but isn't as noticeable as the strong smoked flavor that captures the essence of this unique beer... Never tasted anything like this and I was quite impressed by the fact that although apparent, the smoked flavor is not quite as overwhelming and dominating as compared to the Marzen version, which in my opinion, is a bit too aggressive...

The spicing, honey-ish sweetness, and smoke is all there. Very interesting, but I'm not too convinced that a weissbier is the best vehicle for smoked malts.

I would say the level of smoke is more like a smoked gouda rather than a smoked meat. The flavor is actually nicely balanced, with a fairly strong smoke hit up front that mellows followed by a very slight sourness from the grain and then a light graininess. The mouthfeelis alittle light, but there is a nice creaminess there as well.

The mouthfeel is almost light and fluffy, and there is a hint of lactic twang. While the smoke flavor/aroma is strong I would have to say this is a balanced beer.

Despite the smoke, it is not overpwering as it could be. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium-bodied, but goes down rather smooth. Carbonation doesn't come through so much on this one, seems a little flat despite all the carbonation. My first real rauchbier, and I'm not sure what to think.

Intense aroma of smoked pork / uncooked bacon, which nearly overpowers the normal hefe elements (cloves and banana) that are faintly present in the background. Flavour has some uncooked bacon notes too, but they are not as overpowering as in the aroma. Fairly smooth to drink, but letÂs face it: smoked pork is not what I want to smell nor taste in a beer.

There's a weizen yeasty base in the smell that really evens the smoke out. Taste begins with lots of weizen like esters. Fruity and almost acidic. Finish is where the smoke really comes out with its woody, smoked cheese characteristic. This was a bit more balanced of a beer and quite drinkable.

The marriage is seamless, and through the finish it's really one fully coalesced flavor with some light supporting bitterness. Some very slight banana can be picked out, but the integration is impressive. Carbonation is medium with a medium low, weizen style body. Very drinkable, but this is one I like to take my time with. This is done very well, but I think I prefer either an all out rauchbier or allout weizen, but this is a very nice change of pace.

The wheat goes mostly undetected, but does add in the viscocity and consistency of the beer. Creamy without thickening. In fact, the thinnest of the three Acht Rauchbiers.

Speaking of head, it was massive like a typical Weizen, this is always a lovely sight, it was not as rocky as a Hefe and the head retention was not as good as most good Weizens. It quickly faded to a bubbly cap that was about a Â¼Â in height. This cap lasted the entire consumption, impressive. There was no subsequent lacing however, disappointing. The nose has good potency. I wanted it louder but IÂm greedy. The smoky aromas launch the nose in a direction far from a typical Weizen, as expected. I have grown to love the bouquet of Rauchbier, oh the sausages, campfires, smoked bacon or is that ham? I just love the smoky, fatty, meaty smell. Maybe I am being susceptible but I think I got a whiff of banana. No, I do smell banana. The bouquet is quite inviting and well-rounded. Maybe it is just a little too soft but it is a wheat beer after all. Regardless, it is drinking time! The nose is a bloody liar! Bastard. Okay, that is a bit harsh. The palate is more indicative of what I was expecting with a Rauchbier-Weizen. Indeed the palate has the beechwood, smoky flavors but they are just lighter in flavor (especially in comparison to the smell), I detected the sausages and ham cooking on a smoldering campfire. Lovely. But the Weizen aspects are also detectable, mainly at the finish. This is when the cloves and bananas kick in. Yummy! The aftertaste opens up even more, lemons and wheat flavors really elevate this beer but the charred wood is never far behind. The palate is far less powerful than I as expecting and in this case that is a good thing. This is beautifully crafted; it is very flavorful but amazingly refreshing. The mouthfeel is also seduced by the wheat influences, it is smooth and a bit silky on the tongue, the carbonation is tickle too small, and the bulk is around medium/medium-light. The mouthfeel is very satisfying, it is much smaller than I was expecting but, yet again, I was pleasantly surprised! It is also amazingly drinkable. This might be my new go-to Weizen!

When poured into a lager glass, the wonderful smoke aroma hits you at an arm's length. Underneath it there are faint notes of bananas and cloves, and a bit of orange peel. It is a very handsome beer with a burnt amber cloudy appearance, topped off with a tall white lasting head and generous lacing worthy of its weizen heritage. The taste is a balance of fruity esters (bananas, lemons, orange peel) and herbs (cloves, coriander) mixed with a smoky dryness. The smoked malt is a bit harsh on the palette, and the beer lacks enough body to temper the rough edges in this department. A very nice smoky detour from the ordinary beers, and a nostalgic look at what beers might have tasted like prior to the industrial revolution taking over the malting process.","rajendra82","May 22, 2004"

3.9,-0.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The smoke is intense, though noticeably less than the marzen or urbock. It is a ruby brown with a big head. It has a sweet, smokey aroma with some fruit in the nose. The body is crisp and relatively light and then the smoke hits you. It finishes fairly clean with some lingering smokiness. I love this with ham.","ark57","Mar 17, 2004"
3.85,-1.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"16.9oz. bottle poured into a weizen glass. It pours a murky dark brown color with three fingers of head. There is quite a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly smoky, but also has hints of wheat malt and fruit. Maybe a hint of cloves in there as well. The taste is also very smoky, but not overly strong. Very malty and like smoked gouda going across the tongue. A little bit of esters and a slight clove flavor from the yeast as well. Almost no trace of hops. The body is fairly thick and heavy, good for a weizen. The drinkability also fairs well. A very very unique wheat beer.","SheepNutz","Mar 02, 2004"

3.65,-6.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My spouse, who does like wheats, was less impressed, saying that it made her crave smoked fish - which Russians like to eat with beer anyway. She's right, though - this would go very well with some smoked trout.","Globetrotter","Nov 05, 2003"
4.12,5.4,4,4.5,4,4,4," Starts a bit tingly, and it then quickly smoothes out. The body is a medium plus. Delicious flavor of smoked ham. It reminds me of holidays at my grandparents. There are some noticable tastes of wheat in there, but the smokiness really dominates. This is a very interesting style. It is not quite as smoky as other Rauchbiere, but it definitely has plenty of flavor. The drinkability is also great. I just wanted to take my next sip time after time.","ElGuapo","Nov 02, 2003"
3.56,-9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Appearance: The body is a cloudy unfiltered amber brown with jets of carbonation running up from the bottom, forming a large creamy textured tan head beautiful as for lacing is perfect thick and spaced evenly. Aroma: It's just about brunch here and I figured why not sample a beer that taste liked smoked bacon, this is liquified Canadian bacon as weird as that sounds its kind of smells good underneath the layers of smoke are mild clove and fruit esters, and a sharp scent of malted wheat. Taste: Sharp sweetness of a wheat the fizzy high carbonation and the neverending barrage of smokiness, that shouldn't even be drinkable but somehow you get used to it after your second sip. Mouthfeel: Spritzy medium bodied smoked wheat wow, this beer is different. Drinkability: Just can't imagine drinking multiple offerings of this in one sitting that would be a bit much.","WVbeergeek","Oct 25, 2003"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"But the taste is shocking. Unexpected for me at any level for me, the smoked meat-like taste, not a bad one at all and worth repeating, is unlike any other beer ive ever tried and it pleases me to have been introduced into this new rauchbier style. The mouthfeel is thick but nice et all. The drinkability is good as long as your budget allows this rare specimen here in Paris.","Andreji","Oct 13, 2003"
4.54,16.1,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall just another outstanding beer from this brewery. The wheat touch throws me off a little, but it is a weizen after all. Not the beer for everyone, but if you like smokey beers this is a must try.","taez555","Sep 30, 2003"
3.68,-5.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The Weizen has a hint of smoke to it(which may have been stronger, but I just drank their MÃ¤rzen). The beer was quite dark, in fact much darker than even your standard Dunkel Weiss. The beer had a good deal of a caramel taste to it, with not as much of the clovey/ banana flavor one associates with a weizen.","Gueuzedude","Sep 04, 2003"

2.73,-30.2,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Muddy colour, typical of a dunkel weizen, with foam not very compact and persistent, for a weizen beer. The smell is smoke, smoke and smoke. The smoked flavour of a ""scamorza"" (italian smoked cheese). Smoke of green wood. The typical flavour of a weizen is still present, even if a little difficult to feel in the abundancy of the smoke. At the taste the smoke is less predominant, and the weizen feeling is more perceptible, with a little of citric (lime). Aftertaste of smoke (ma va?)Unbalanced.","stcules","May 29, 2003"
3.8,-2.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nice dark colored wheat beer with thick head. Head looked like a sponge through the side of the glass with it's large bubbles. Nice beachwood smoked malt flavor with emphasis on wheat and smoke flavor. Overall a great smoked wheat but I think I like the Rauchenfelser slightly better with the addition of hop extract which gives it a little more character.","BierReise","May 04, 2003"
3.23,-17.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This is a quality beer, but just not to my liking. I really enjoy how the smoke flavor accents Alaskan Smoked Porter and Stone Smoked Porter, but I got a whole different vibe from this beer. I'm obviously not as into the smoke flavor as some BA's.","PhantomVodoo","Mar 25, 2003"
1.83,-53.2,3,2.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Rauchbier Weiss Beer: A weiss smoke beer, brown in color and definitely smoky in the aroma. Very little head, what there was dissipated quickly. WOW, I do NOT get this whole smoke beer concept. It tastes like an arson investigation. Consequently, I swirled the yeast at the bottom and added it to the glass. Thatâs better, it went from a felony to an aggravated misdemeanor. Really bad.","jackndan","Mar 19, 2003"
3.45,-11.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Pour is a cloudy medium brown, with a huge white head that leaves sheets of lace. Aroma is smoked meat (bacon, ham, salami) with some banana mixed in.

4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beers pours a hazy copper color with a creamy head that last for a little while. The smell of smoked is very very strong and tastes the same. Beef jerky lovers beer. The smoked flavor does not last very long as an after taste which is good. This by far is the best rauchbier I have ever had. I plan on brewing it my self.","kunzbrew","Dec 25, 2002"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a murky light brown with a thick white head. Smells Like a smoky wheat beer with clove dominating the wheat. I have to admit that at first the smell seemed intense,this has been a totally different beer experience for me. I have never tasted a beer quite like this. Truly an enjoyable beer. Strong flavors, and intense smokiness. One hearty beer.","jtw5877","Dec 13, 2002"
3.98,1.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Notes & Drinkability: I just love a good rauchbier, and this is one of the best. It combines the pleasantries of a tasty wheat beer with old school flavours to create one helluva an exceptional brew!","Todd","Dec 02, 2002"

4.89,25.1,4,5,5,4.5,5,"This beauty pours with a nice healthy beige colored head that settles atop effervescent reddish-brown liquid, turning a bit murky once the residual yeast sediment is swirled/poured into the glass. Nose..ahh the nose, light wheat malts enrobed in a blanket of wonderful smokiness...very appetizing to all the senses! Tasting reveals the light body from the proportion of malted wheat used, then wave upon wave of wonderful smoke flavors coat the palate. A very subtle hop presence is tasted after swallowing. Finishes smoky, then the ""traditional"" weizenbier flavors, (Banana & Clove) make a brief apperance, but the finish is not as intense or as long as in the Marzen & Urbock, but is still a wonder to behold. A nice, less in-your-face introduction to the style...truly one of the world's most distinctive beers, a must-try!","beerluvr","Oct 07, 2002"
4.77,22,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Brown in color with a dull mahogany glow when held to the light. You can see the effervescence that's present as billows of tiny bubbles rise to the surface supporting a thick, creamy ivory head. The head holds extremely well throughout the glass but leaves little lace. The body is medium with a very fine and effervescent carbonation that gives a creamy mouthfeel. The aroma is outstanding with a very rich, deep, Beechwood smokiness. The flavor starts with a lightly sweet, fruity, and gently tangy maltiness that reveals some soft caramel notes as it warms in the mouth, and then a burst of soft smokiness immediately following the swallow. The smokiness lingers for a few moments and then receeds (at least partially) from the palate. At this point much of the yeast character is noticeable with a gentle clove that works extremely well with the residual smoke character, as well as some vanilla, very light banana, and soft phenolic (plastic). Very nice! The smoke character is extremely well done - never overwhelming the palate, but with enough presence to be continually noticeable throughout the entire serving. Absolutely worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Oct 03, 2002"
4.3,10,3.5,3.5,5,4.5,4,"Brownish orange and hazy, this beer sported a fluffy offwhite head. With of whiff of this, nobdy could ever mistake this beer for a non-smoke one. Bigtime smoke aroma as well as a little malt. There was still immense smoke taste, but it wasn't as big as in the nose. I tasted the hearty wood smoke first, followed by mild wheat characteristics, mainly the body and mouthfeel, and the beer departed with a slight hop bitterness. It tasted a little like hickory smoke, but I've been told otherwise. It was much more balanced beer than one would expect from smell alone. A great beer for for when you're in the mood for something a little differnet. It's also fun to introduce others to a world beyond Bud with this one!","yen157","Sep 27, 2002"

Similar to a campfire. What a conglomeration of various tastes on the buds. Very interesting indeed. This beer may not be right for everybody, but it is growing on me. First, there is of course the smoke flavor. Fairly heavy but also rounded. Then there are the weizen characteristics: banana, cloves, vanilla, phenolic character and pepper. Body is about medium. And the carbonation is just about right. Nice mouthfeel. Unique beer worth a try.","Bighuge","Sep 10, 2002"
3.87,-1,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Interesting experience. I've has peat-smoked beers before, but using wood to smoke the malt makes for such a higher quality flavor and aroma. It's got a good estery dunkel weizen flavor going on underneath the smoke too. The way the smoke and ester flavors combine is's like it almost creates a feel of creamed smoke more than a new flavor. It went well with my wife's first attempt at a pot roast and I can only imagine how much better it would go with grilled or smoked pork or beef.","aracauna","Aug 21, 2002"
4.21,7.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The turbid dark bronze hued brew is topped by a dense, very well retained, ivory white head with stiff, rocky peaks. It's akin to a dunkelweizen in appearance. Beechwood rauchmalt dominates the aroma, with only a hint of banana ester eeking in.  Signature weizen esters are more assertive in the flavor profile, which is a melange of mild banana and mellow clove, lightly toasty Munich malt notes and slightly fruity melanoidins.  Hop bitterness is a bit above the norm for a weizen, but provides contrast to the caramel sweetness and persistant rauchmalt smokiness.  Moderate in body, w/ wheat proteins and dextrins lending a slick, smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes with wheat tartness quickly fading and smokiness lingering.  Flavorful to say the least.  Although the rauchmalt overpowered many basemalt and wheat notes, esters were still discernible.  The combination of smoke and typical weizen characteristics result in a very unique and highly drinkable rauchbier (provided that you're accustomed to rauchmalt).","marc77","Aug 18, 2002"
