"I do not know if this proposal is even, but found no body, and so the smoky, artificial; I'd rather be wrong. Foam almost absent and elusive, the smoked only felt in the aftertaste."

"A sessionable Rauchbier, maybe worth it as an entrance for beginners, but far from the usual smoked intense for the style."

"O: Good drinkability. Great Rauchbier made in Brazil"

"A single I picked up since I liked the weizenbock I tried from this brewery and smoked beers are interesting. This is a pretty decent smoked beer/rauch. Not overpowering in the smokiness, but gives a nice smoked sausage flavor. Worth a shot."
"O: I bought this in a mix-a-six because my daughter liked the picture of the train on the label. Glad she did. I didn't pay attention to the cost of the bottle or of a six-pack, so I don't know if it was worth what I spent, but I think so. I think this is going to be the Thanksgiving-dinner six-pack this year."
"The Eisenbahn Rauchbier was available a Figiera Restaurant in Sao Paulo. I tried this beer after the Pale Ale. The Rauch or smoke beer was ok. The appearance was a rich clear amber and a decent white head was present. The scent was somewhat smokey, but not dominate. The taste was decent, malt and grain present with tinges of roast/smoke. The mouthfeel was slightly downgraded because Alcohol was definitely present. Overall a decent beer and worth a try."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A nice, solid, surprisingly clean offering, with more of a tendency towards a visceral, subtle meatiness, than sinus (or palate) searing smoke."
"A nice beer, would surely try again."
"Pours a clear, rust color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of smoke, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and a hint of grain. Fits the style of rauchbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smoke, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight earthy malt, hint of grain, and a hint of hops. Overall, a lot better then the Dourada. Good mouth feel and blend."
"Overall: Sweet, rich malts and caramel very nicely balance the moderate smoke in this which creates decent complexity and interest. For a smoke beer, especially one as sweet as this one, this is highly drinkable and enjoyable."
"Fairly unimpressed with this but will happily give this a second chance with a fresh bottle if anyone from Oz wants to import another batch."
"Gets slightly cloying after a while, with the sweetness raising its head once too often. It doesn't strike me as a particularly good rauch, but it has its moments."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a nice one to have when you'd like a little smoke, but not too much."
"It is a pretty good rauchbier."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is good, malts and smokes meat, some notes of hops. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall a pretty interesting and not bad beer."
"Pours a clear amber-brown with about a finger of light head that leaves little lacing on the glass. The smell is of mesquite BBQ, with hints of green apple, cocoa, and plums. The taste begins with a subtly sweet maltiness, allowing the smokiness to build up behind. That maltiness is what lingers in the aftertaste, though, rather than the smoke, as would be expected. The medium body, coupled with the overall sweetness, makes for a more drinkable rauch than usual."
"Quite drinkable for a rauchbier though I find myself preferring the boldness of the richer, smokier versions."
"D-Damn solid. Certainly not the best rauchbier I have ever had but considering this is made in Brazil---well, color me impressed. A pleasant, well made and easy drinking brew. I think Xingu will have to take a back seat to my new favorite beer from Brazil!"
"This is an excellent lager."
"Taste is smokey but again not too much so, quite malty in the smokeiness with light stewed plum-apple fruitiness, hint of caramel, mineral quality. It's lightly sweet before a more dry, zesty minerally-leafy herb finish. It has light grain elements throughout, too, and is very easy to drink. It is perhaps on the thin side and sweet side and is not too complex, but has good character that hold up well."
"Don't know if anyone would want to polish off a full 6 of these all in one sitting, but I sure wouldn't mind another one."
"Overall: a fine beer. The smoked flavor is interesting, and though not my personal favorite, I give this beer a good rating because it is different from the usual import lager."
"Overall this was a pretty good rauchbier. The flavors certainly improve as the beer warms so be sure to let this one get to a good temperature. Worth a shot."
"A: A rusty brown color, thin layer of densely packed head, crystal clear - 3.50, S: Smokiness is the first thing that I notice on the nose - it is quite strong though not overpowering, there is also the unmistakable crisp lager aromas, some grain smells also make a showing - 4.00, T: Smokiness is present but like the nose it does not overwhelm, crisp and refreshing, quite distinct sweet caramel malt, very pleasing palate - 4.00, M: Silky mouth feel - 4.00, D: Very drinkable and a beer I would unquestionably drink again, having called Brazil home for a little over a year and considering it a beer wasteland, it is nice to see craft beer taking hold - 4.25"
"I like this style and while this is no great beer it's pretty good. I wonder if the Brazilian restaurant in the city serves this, they should."
"Well brewed. If I could be guaranteed to get ahold of this fresh, I'd love to try some more from this brewer."
"M&D--Both are fine, with higher marks to drinkability just because the subtlety of the smoke doesn't overpower your palate. Better for a more offbeat session than for something that's gonna knock your socks off with novelty--for those expecting a sock of smoke you'll be disappointed, and probably even bored. Could have been more flavorful for the ABV."
"Very drinkable, as it is smoky but not overly so, allowing other characteristics to come through that complement the smokiness well. Alcohol is well-masked. Solid choice for a smoky, but not overpowering, brew with a balanced maltiness. A very nice one here!"
"Picked up a single bottle at Nikki's Liquors in RI. Poured into my nonic pint glass a clear golden amber color with a quickly vanishing off-white head. Smells mildly of smoked malts and burnt caramel with a unique taffy like sweetness. Tastes of sweet, brown sugar coated smoked ribs. The smoke is mild and not overpowering. A bit thin in body with medium carbonation. It did not take long for my glass to become empty. Worth a try if you see it."
"But where this shines like I mentioned before is its drinkability. It is so balanced and actually really feminine for a beer of this style. I could easily but back a sixer of this. I guess I was dreaming of a bit more smoke."
"Its great that so many delicious micros are coming from Latin America. This is one I'll seek out down in Brazil this summer for sure."
"Amber brown color, with pretty hues of orange and yellow found at the bottom edge of the glass. It has a sweet aroma, a mix of smoked meat and sweet pale malt. It's mellow. The taste is a surprise to my expectations. Not very smoky, but not very intense, a surprise given its 6.5% listed on the bottle. There's some juicy meat flavor found, but it's leans more towards a helles lager. No odd flavors either. A good rauchbier to be had, and one that paired well with homemade churrasco."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgian globe. This beer pours a dark caramel with just a slight off white head that completely disappeared leaving no remnants left behind in my glass. The aroma is distinctly smoked barley. Not that fake liquid smoke aroma that you find in so many rauchbiers. Its not overpowering but it is definitely the most distinctive aroma in it. A nice meaty smoke. The flavor is just a really subtle smoke complement very well by a sweet caramel malty backbone. The mouthfeel is a very light and smooth but just a little to dry for me. I can honestly say that this is the first Rauchbier I have truly enjoyed."
"Strong copper color with some light ruby and hay colored highlights. Very light tan, two finger head after a zealous pour. Pretty good retention and some sticking after each sip. Smokey bread and old world candy aroma, the hops and yeast combine to add a touch of spicy fruit to the nose. Starts with soesoft, campfire toasted malt that give a note of fruity coffee cakeRoasted plums mix with a faint peppermint hop lingering in the back of the tongue. Medium, smokey smooth body. Maybe not sessionable in my book, but still a drinkable beer."
"This beer pours a murky ruby color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and toffee malt with a smoke undercurrent. The taste is a bit smokier than the aroma, and there is still a solid malt presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation which seems to slightly get in the way of the taste. Overall, this is a decent rauchbier that I could drink again, but there are better examples out to be had."
"Overall I would not get it again, but it was interesting. Whatever style you want to call it, it was interesting."
"D- This is a nice stab at a Rauchbier. It wasn't quite a schlenkerla, but it's unfair to judge everyone against that. If you like rauchbier, try this. It won't disappoint. Huge thanks to schellsbeer!"
"Overall, impressed with my first Brazilian beer. Will I search this one out....probably not since it is $2.50 per bottle before taxes and I can have a Three Feet Down for much less than that. However, great experience. If you have the chance, I say try one...I have 2 that I am going to enjoy."
"Poured into a seidel. Clear copper color with an ecru head that fizzes out pretty quick. No lacing. Aroma is salted meat with a mild phenolic plastic note. Some sweet caramel tempers the smoke, making this beer less intense than the Schlenkerla rauchbiers. Flavor is pretty much identical. Nice light smokiness, not like drinking a Christmas ham. Light body and pretty clean. Drinkable and even kinda refreshing."
"Good overall rauchbier but lacks the guts of a good Schlenkerla."
"...pours a dark amber with a darker-white head... the nose is oaky... slightly sweet...i dig it... the taste is smoky, wood, delightful, sweet malts... medium bodied... medium carbo... uh-very niyees! (borat)..."
"Drinks alright, more malt depth would help. A nice starter Rauch"
"D: Not bad for a smoked beer. Did not think I would like it, but I did. Would buy again."
"shared with friends at the first Stumelagram Tasting ... some intresting things happening here, oak, syrup, mild bbq aromas ... nice complex yet light flavours ... pretty full in the mouth .. goes well with cubed ham... sweet and smoke kissed...til next time"
"This beer holds together beautifully, with neither the sweetness nor the smoke coming across as heavy-handed. An absolute charmer of a rauchbier which could satisfy a fan of the style without putting off the curious novice who has never tasted one before."
"Drinkability is good."
"This is by no means a style I seek out, but this offering is very impressive. An oily malt sweetness cuts the smoke perfectly, making this an extremely drinkable example for the style. Thanks to this I'm now craving a big plate o' ribs."
"Quite a tasty and satisfying smoke, with the medium lager mouthfeel backdropping the right amount of smoked malt flavour, with some long finish and some complexity. Sweetish but not too sweet. Drinkable this one. Tiny white head but appropriate though significant carbonation."
"Pours an interesting red amber color with ok white head. Nose is slight smoke and good pilsnery malt. Taste follows with rich lager, almost schwarzbier taste, some roast and noticeable smoke flavor. A good crisp finish. Adequate carbonation in the mouthfeel, and pretty good drinkability. An interesting style done fairly well. I love rauchbier, but I'm not sure I like it in a lager form. It would be good for an introduction to the style for those unfamiliar. It is good, but it is nothing particularly special or flavorful. Good beer, just not amazing."
"I wasn't crazy in love with it, but it had its place, and seemed to me to be a clean, smoky interpretation of the style that could serve both as entry-point and reference point for Rauchbiers."
"Pours a nice clear and darker copper with a thinner creme head. Nose is only slightly smoked. Flavor is actually pretty good. Nice smooth smokiness. Nice malty edge. It's nice. Smooth feel, with a slightly biting carbonation to it. Like I said, it's nice. A smooth and unobtrusive rauch that's quite easy to drink."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Mouthfeel is medium light, the smoked malt lingers in the mouth, very pleasing. This is drinkable, for sure, but is actually a bit filling (or maybe i was full from dinner). If you happen to see it somewhere, pick it up and give it a try. Definately recommended."
"I bought this bottle at Stimmel's Market in Bowling Green, Ohio. The label says ""Defumada Eisenbahm Smoked Lager, batch 06"". I chose the Sam Adams Uber-glass for the occasion of my 1st Brazilian craft beer. Everything about this beer was spot-on, it's as if they re-bottled something from Bamburg. The beer was copper colored and crystal clear (like a sun tea). The smell was smoked malts with a hint of sweetness. The flavor was definitive rauchbier, smoky after-taste but not so much as to seem like a campfire. Delicious, easy to pound, and completely recommended."
"A good amount of carbonation, very refreshing. Aftertaste is of caramelized sugar, dark fruits and a little dry."
"Prost!!"
"An interesting beer. A nice introduction to the style."
"Highly recommended. A very good smoked beer, from Brazil no less. Wish I had bought more than 2 bottles."
"D - This is an excellent rauchbier. I'm very pleasantly surprised by this brewery from Brasil. I guess I didn't expect that much and they keep surprising me with wonderful beers - this one being a great example!"
"Drinkability: A restrained, even sensible smokiness for an altogether balanced beer. I never thought I'd use the word ""sensible"" when describing a rauchbier, but there it is."
"Appears a ruby amber tone nice velvety light tan head dwindles slowly leaves behind fine even lacing looking good. Smelling even better smoked rauchbier at it's finest smoked meats and peated malt accents burnt wood with sweet fruit malt undertones not getting much hops but that's okay I never have from a true rauchbier. Flavors like camp fire roasted caramel covered nuts, and smoked meats combine to form a slight woody flavor with enough malts coming through to really forms a tasty balanced smoked lager. A touch of alcohol and sweet ripened plums combine but the lingering smokiness is killer really great brew. Texture wise I get fine even carbonation even a bit bubbly medium bodied ale with lingering presence on the palate due to the dry smokiness. Drinkability is nice I could see myself indulging on a couple bottles of this stuff smoked beer grows on you especially after a couple in a session this would be addictive for me especially with some assorted meats and cheeses."
"crystal-clear brown with candy corn coloration around the edges. thin wisp of resilient foam. aroma gives off even parts honey and beechwoody smoke.. medium smoke nose. smells rich and multi-dimensional. first sip is a tad sweet immediately, lots of that uber malty german pils character. once my mouth is coated with that sensation, further sips contain more and more of this wonderfully subversive smokiness. definite balanced mix between the bamberg-style which is all smoke and no wood, and a smoky flavor one would associate with a bourbon barrel-aged beer. the latter might be perceived, as the beer leans toward the heavier, richer side of lagers. but who the fuck cares. this beer goes down easy like a hooker on hunts point. next to the rauchator dopplebock from fort collins, this is my second favorite smoked beer of all time. beats the piss out of schlenkerla helles. why didn't i buy a sixer of this?!?! next time."
"Drinkability: I like my smoked beers to be subtle but discernable and this is one of the best examples I have found; a masterful achievement"
"D- This beer has some nice malt flavors but the smoke is a bit odd. That being said most breweries can’t get the smoke correct for stouts and porters so I’m very impressed that they attempted a lager with smoke. They really made a smoked lager better than I could ever expect."
"Quite a refreshing beer on a hot day."
"This is an unbelievable Rauchbier. Perfectly integrated, big and chewy complexity. Rich coating thick mouthfeel and very easily drinkable. Melted heath bar with milk duds on the side. Big chewy fresh caramel, smoke isn't overpowering at all and lends a great compliment to the thick malts. A slight hop bitterness on the 2 minute finish. Easily one of the best Lagers I've tasted."
"Reasonably good beer, a nice surprise from my country, not exactly known from great beers, but a little below what I expect from rauchbiers. Perhaps a good introduction for non-rauchbier lovers, but I prefer the wicked smoked flavors of the german counterparts."
"D: Admittedly, I didn't have much hope for a rauch coming from Brazilian brewery. Fortunately, I was quite wrong. This beer is very drinkable and is pleasant in all areas. The subtlty of the smoked malt makes this a great introduction to rauchbiers before jumping into the Schenkerlas."
"Finish is clean, a nice caramel malt driven lager. The smoky aftertaste hangs around long enough to be effective, but is also whisked nicely off the palate by scrubbing hops. All around a very nice brew."
"This is a style I am warming up to a bit and I have read and heard some really good stuff about this Brazilian brewer so it was a no brainer for me to pick this up today.Poured into a .5 liter stein a deep rich amber with a swirling tight 1 one finger off white head very nice clarity to the pour,the smoke is prominent but there is a big brown sugar and taostiness to compliment the hardwood smoke.Starts off sweet before the smoke cuts thru it a nice mix of brown sugar sweetness and smoke like a brown sugar cured smoked ham.A very well made rauchbier better than alot of Bamburg ones I have had Eisenbahn impresses in my first encounter with them."
"Hooked up with this beer thanks to msubulldog25. Much respect flyin' out to B to tha G."
"The beer fills the glass with a deep copper hue. the finger of very bubbly head falls quickly to a quarter inch over top, though a constant stream of bubbles helps to keep it stationary there. The color is very brilliany and clarity is fantastic. Even before getting near, I get excellent sweet smokey notes wafting towards me. Taking a closer smell, I find a nice and delicate smokey character, with a more mild sweetness playing below that. The sweetness from the smoke and the malt play well together and are hard to tease apart. The first sip brings a reserved smoke character with a solid bready and slightly grainy malt base that hits directly after the smoke. The smoke then kicks again before fading to a very bready finish. There is excellent balance between smoke and malt here. There is even just a hint of a hop bitterness on the finish. I definitely get a lot of the base beer without feeling I lost any of the rauchbier character that I love. This is excellent. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. A little more carbonation would be nice, but that is just my personal opinion. Overall, this beer is impressive from start to finish. I'm used to smoked beers with a very dominant smoke. I think I may like the balance of this more than others I have had. I will be having this one again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and maybe a touch sticky from the sweet malts, with a pretty darn good drinkability."
"Drinkability - this is an ideal candidate for an introduction to the style. Not over the top smoked like a Schlenkerla rauchbier but definitely enough to get a feel for the style. Beer tasting candidate for certain. Perhaps the most sessionable smoker I've had."
"The mouthfeel is moderately heavy for a lager (which I like) and somewhat creamy. Unlike a lot of Rauch beers, I could drink a few of these in a row, but more because of its great balance and not because it lacks a notable smokiness."
"If blindfolded, I believe I'd most closely compare it to a Scotch Ale in flavor. It is a subtly smoky beer which might make it a good introduction to the style."
"Thank you to Todd the beer guy at McKean and Charles in Waldoboro for getting me to try this. I never would have tried it without his suggestion, and then I would have really missed out. This is a great, almost phenomenal, beer. A 12oz bottle, Batch 06, poured into a pint glass. Dark amber color, small head. Faint campfire smoke aroma, with a some fruit. Very pleasant. Fruit, malt taste, with the faint smoke flavor coming in afterwards. Very subtle, very comfortable. Truly a beer to enjoy. I need to see if Tully's carries this, because I don't get up to Waldoboro that often."
"In spite of the fact that my bottle says Defumada Smoked Lager, I'm pretty confident that we're talking about the same beer. And what a beer it is! This Brazilian offering can hold its head high among the world's best rauchbiers. I love being surprised like this."
"I feel pretty confident that, once word gets out about this and its more available, it will become one of the best of its style/genre. Just a fantastic beer, truly a barreled spirit in 11oz form, complete with the smoke. If you like single malts, bourbon or whiskey with a little charcoal in the background, some caramel up front, stone fruits here and there, and a big chewy finish I cannot recommend this enough. A new member of my personal Top 10, perhaps Top 5. Seek this out & enjoy!"
"Overall, a better session candidate than bigger Rauchbiers like Schlenkerla, Spezial, and Rauchenfelser. Very clean and inviting."
"DR - As said before, its impossible to drink only one."
"Another excelent beer from Eisenbahn, the small brewerie from Blumenau, SC."
"Not a bad beer, it just doesn't fit my personal taste."
"No too drinkable, a couple are enough to appreciate. Goes very well with pork meat, roast beef, and barbecue."
