"This is a very nice smoke beer. The smoke is not over bearing like some smoke beers I've had. It is nice and smooth."

"Poured from tap into pint glass at Bulldog Midcity. Pours a slight brown color with slight foamy head. Some smokey/bacon aromas, with sweet malts. Taste is really nice smokey and bacon, mixed with great sweet malts. It super well balanced and not so harsh. Maybe my fav smoked brew I ever had...and I usually dont like smoked brews. Overall, nice brew and great Rauch brew..."

"This beer is smooth and easy to drink; it's not much of a rauchbier, but it's ok for what it is."

"I am not a fan of Rauchbiers but this is excellent. Plenty of smoke, but incredible balance. Well done and highly recommended."

"Smoky Mary isn't a terribly complicated brew, but is definitely a solid offering from NOLA."
"Overall: So far, my favorite from the NOLA folks. Very sessionable. Perfect for a fall weekend when da Saints and dem Tigers chug down victories."
"Had a pint a NY Pizza on Magazine St. in New Orleans. I had the odd urge to eat this beer, the mix of spice and smoke with toasty malt and caramel reminds me of food. Or at least it'd make a great pairing with anything spicy. This is surprisingly complex for an amber, or smoked ale, with a great balance between the smoke and malt. Find this beer."
"Outstanding with a burger."
"Nice, but too subtle to call it smoked."
"Overall: Once again NOLA Brewing continues to amaze with their specialty beers. Would love to see this one in 22oz bottles!"
