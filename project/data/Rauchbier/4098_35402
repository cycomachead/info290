4.12,0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Drank out of a 1L MaB, but only poured a half liter. The nose is also overwhelming, though the scent itself is mild. HICKORY, HICKORY, HICKORY! Large amounts of lace after a moderate head of off white gobs. Attractive beer. Big white bubbles hang around after the head thins out. Smoked flavor is subdued and mellowed out with a maltiness reminscent of a watered down Old Chub malt profile. Carbonation is light to moderate, but with the smokiness and malt background, its fitting. I don't think my 5L will last until tomorrow...no work, no worries.","allboutbierge","May 27, 2008"
