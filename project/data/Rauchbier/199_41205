Clean, spicy, smoky flavorâ€¦rich German malt sweetness and a touch of salted caramel. Medium, crisp, and clean, with some finishing lager yeast.

You will of course have to really like smoked beers to like this, and I really like that they stayed away from the alternate smoked malts; so many of the newer (and peat too) smoked malts get harsh and weird tasting.","Gueuzedude","Aug 23, 2013"

Smell is of malt, caramel, and some slight smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with a light smoke flavor that lingers on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smoke is very mild in the aroma and taste.","UCLABrewN84","May 20, 2012"

Nice balanced of smoke and sweet malt notes with hints of charcoal, ash and smokes meat followed by caramel and toffee. Smokiness nicely integrated throughout but never becomes a smoke bomb. I generally like more smoke but this I see is well balanced, easy to drink and flavorful.","corby112","Feb 17, 2012"

3.92,6.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall: I really enjoyed this. The smoke isn't nearly as intense as other Rauchbiers I've had (Aecht Schlenkerlas, for example), but the balance of complex malt and beechwood smoke makes for an enjoyable and very drinkable beer. Recommended.","HopHead84","Jun 18, 2011"

3.62,-1.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This smoked lager is actually not too bad. The smokiness actually give off some kind of sweetness instead of a saltiness like some smoked beers do. The smoke is Light enough that it's doesn't over power the beer either. The color is a copper with a pretty nice head on it. The taste doesn't scream bacon which is pretty nice for a change. The beer has a medium mouthfeel that allows the drinkability to increase. Not a bad brew but it could be a little stronger.","Knapp85","Oct 25, 2010"

4.32,17.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured brown with maroon highlights that had a finger of head and left good sticky lacing. I really enjoy smoke beers like this which had a great smokey aroma with roasty malts, faint caramel, and crazy barbeque notes that were like throwing meat on the grill; very intresting. Upfront the smokiness also dominated the taste that had roasted malts, caramel, and barbequed meat accents. There was also very faint hop characters which popped up in the background. The beer was medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a real big smokey meaty and chewy finish. Overall the brew drank quite well for me and was really enjoyable. I do like smoke beers and this one was no exception. Great offering from ballast point that was out of the ordinary; good job.","Gobzilla","Apr 19, 2010"

3.53,-4.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a standard pint glass a deep reddish brown with a minmal head,aromas were very light,faint caramel and even more faint smoke are all I really picked up.Flavors are still light on the smoke but there is some good maltly sweetnes to it,brown sugar and some modest roast flavors,a light drying almost earthy finish.Not bad but not one of the higher end of the style in my modest opinion.","oberon","Mar 27, 2010"
3.48,-5.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Clear, clean dark brown color, with some reddish tinges along the sides, and a good white head. On the nose, I get mostly peat smoke, along with some roasted nuts, but mostly smoke. Intense peat smoke dominates on the palate as well, hiding a nice caramel malt sweetness that lies beneath the surface. A noble, interesting and ultimately nice effort, but I know one was more than enough.","emmasdad","Mar 04, 2010"
3.75,1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Quite drinkable, pairs well with food, on the other hand I would prefer something more potent. A "smoked lager" maybe, but a Rauchbier? I'm not so sure...","augustgarage","Jan 02, 2010"

4.32,17.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"If there is a style secondary to American IPAs and Czech Pilseners for me, it is rauchbier. This was presented to me with a finger of tawny head erupting with CO2 bubbles and evincing good retention. Nose had a slightly smoky sweetness, like a mild BBQ sauce. Color was a deep reddish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a good deal of smoke on the tongue. Warming, the malt became a bit more forward, making it taste like hickory or maple wood-smoke cured bacon. The finish filled my sinuses with that bacon-like flavor. I found it pleasant, but it may not be for everyone. This would be outstanding with BBQ ribs, no doubt.","woodychandler","Beers"
2.61,-29.3,4,3,2,3.5,2.5,"On tap at Hamilton's and looked like an amber color but it was so dark in there I could not be sure. The smell was a little odd but the taste was something else. It smelled a little smoky which was fine but then the flavor was like wet dog and smoke. It was like somebody soaked a dog in lager and then squeezed it into my glass, yuck. I drank it anyway.","ArrogantB","0"
3.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"On-tap at Tap and Table in Emmaus PA for $6/pint. I thought this was a wonderfully balanced smoked beer. It appeared a slightly hazy brown with no head. The aroma was a bit simple with liquid smoke, but the flavor was a tasty mix of molasses, milk chocolate, bacon (yum), caramel, and toffee. The aftertaste is a bit thin, but the basic profile is delicious. Definitely worth a try if you a smokey, but not all-smoke beer.","tempest","Jun 28, 2009"
3.77,2.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - Nice smoked beer that's not too meaty or overwhelming at all. I found this to be quite drinkable overall, as I've slowly been getting more into this style lately.","ffejherb","Apr 12, 2009"

3.94,6.8,3,4,4,4,4,"It's a dark lager with a brown-orange hue and very little head that somehow fades to less head. No matter, if it's a good beer it will taste good, right? Smell is smokey. Like smoked ham and charred toffee or caramel. Taste is crisp caramel that fades to toasty toffee finally finishing with a strong, deep smoke malt. Quite a lot of taste- it finally finishes in a long, barley-smoke aftertaste. Warms to even more smoke. Great smoked lager!","jgap","Oct 08, 2008"
3.1,-16,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours clear copper with a small ring of off-white bubbles. Light aroma of smoked corn. Taste is weak until the beer warms. Once it does, it is a pleasant smoked malt with some meat/bacon flavors. A little iron. Good, but I just want more smoke in my smoked beer.","magictrokini","Oct 05, 2008"
3.82,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Toronado San Diego. Not exactly what I expected with a name like "Abandon Ship". I thought it would be richer and fuller, but I guess I should never judge a beer by its name. It's a dark amber-red-chestnut in color beneath an off-white head. Head retention and lacing are limited. The aroma is clearly smoky, but it doesn't beat you over the head. It's bacon/wood/BBQ over a moderately caramelish malt base. The smokiness is probably from Beechwood but I can't be certain. The flavor is pretty much as the nose suggests, with the addition of a hint of roastiness, and some mild grassy hops. The bitterness is balancing, and the smokiness does the rest. It's medium-light in body and moderately carbonated. Overall, it's a fairly drinkable pint but I don't think that there's enough malt there to sustain the smokiness for more than one or two. It's interesting though, in that it's fairly restrained, and that makes it pretty unique.","NeroFiddled","Sep 13, 2008"

3.7,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability is moderate, low alcohol presence, this is an effervescent smokey beer that is a lighter version of heavier rauchbiers, good balance but I wouldn't drink a large amount of this one","Stoneman78","Beers"
