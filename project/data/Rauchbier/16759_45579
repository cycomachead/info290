3.46,-0.6,3.25,4,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours pale yellow and fizzy with a delicate off-white froth.  Smells peaty and smoky with light fruits in the background.  Sweet and fruity up front with an herbal hop bitterness sneaking in quickly before subtle smoked malts present themselves.  After a few pulls the smokiness starts to linger and excite the senses, but never never really kicks off.  Light bodied and easy going all the way.  Really digging the fact that Southern Star tackled this oh too rare style, but this one needs to grow some balls.","stephens101","Aug 01, 2014"

Take a clean pilsner and throw in 10% beechwood smoke malt...A good one to introduce others to the world of smoke. Thanks for the style want kojevergas!","Duff27","Dec 14, 2013"

Probably the lightest raunchbier I've seen in awhile. 2 finger head dissipated real quick. Not digging the taste. Missing the campfire or pork/bacon taste I love. There's just a weird acidic smoke flavor. Disappointing, as its hard to find this style.","DonFrap","Jul 07, 2013"

3.69,6,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Pours an orange color, some clarity, somewhat hazy. Soapy finger of tan color, dissipated quickly. The aroma was meaty, with more of a ham note and a bit of backing malt sweetness. Not very complex, but pleasant. Smoky notes on the taste, but ample malt sweetness up front that sort of take away from the smoke, making the smoke a bit muddled. Body was on the medium side at best, with a slight prickly bit of carbonation.. High drinkability, but could really use a more smoky smell and flavor to make this a real Rauch treat. Worth trying though as its not a style that is typically inundated and its more that decent.","EgadBananas","Apr 17, 2013"
3.73,7.2,2.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Smoke is a little lighter on the flavor than Id hoped, but it still has some terrific smokiness and meaty flavors. The grain is maybe a little too light, the mouthfeel suffers a bit because of it, I fear. This is definitely not quite up to the standards set by my homies in Bamburg. There is not a whole lot of complexity here, but the smoke flavors are nice and the beer maintains a clean, graininess all the way through. I could drink a lot of this, but not at the price point it is at currently - can this shit and sell it for $8 a four-pack….fine, but don’t charge $6 a pint for it.","twiggamortis420","Apr 14, 2013"

4.09,17.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours hazy dull golden with a fizzy white head that doesn't dissipate very quickly. The beer has the campfire smell with wood smoke and there is some nice caramel malt sweetness in the nose as well. It reminds me of a nice smoked ham. The flavor of this beer takes me back to Aecht Schlenkerla Lagerbier, but it isn't as clean and it's smokier. Those smoky notes come through strongly in the flavor and there's some nice malt sweetness too. There's some hop bitterness in the back end playing with the smokiness. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry and the smokiness lingers in the mouth. The drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Feb 08, 2013"

3.5,0.6,3,3,3.5,4,4,"this brew pours up a clear golden color with a small white head. the nose is straight smoked pork sausage. the taste is very smokey, smoked meat, subtle sweet malts, faint hops. medium bodied, low carbo, very smoothe. A very sessionable Rauchbier. But that raises the question: Is it possible to buy a sixer of a Rauchbier and sit and enjoy? Can one person really enjoy drinking a light, easy smoked pork-flavored beer as a session? I dunno...","stumac","Nov 03, 2008"
2.25,-35.3,4.5,2,2,3,2,"This has to be the most odd beer that I have ever tasted. I passed it around the table just to see what others thought. I got various descriptions. Smoked salmon, bacon, and salami were the words that they used. It smells like smoked meat it tastes like smoked meat. This may be the Rauchbier style. So if you are looking for that in your beer, this is the one. If not, I would look for something else to sip on.","fostwal","Nov 01, 2008"
