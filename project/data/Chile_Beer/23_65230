Wowzers. You get a lot of the dark and roasted notes of the Serrano and Anaheim peppers, but also the nose-blistering sheer heat from the ghost face and habanero. It smells hot as shit, but I like that kind of thing, which explains my mouth watering right now. Flavors are kind of mild initially, with a warming and pepper spice on the backbone, but that is immediately followed up with a blast of hot, both in spice and actual temperature. There is a golden-style type flavor somewhere in there, but it gets absolutely pummeled by the cascade of pepper spice and heat. The body is light and smooth, and the aftertaste is...wait for it...peppers. Again, more spice than anything, but the heat remains throughout, as well, only starting to subside in the finish. The finish is fairly quick, and somewhat unremarkable based on the fact that your taste buds are shot at this point. This was a fun one to try.","GarthDanielson","Feb 23, 2014"

Faster sips are more tolearable for the not so daring. Most of the heat comes after the swallow with a sting of on the tongue. Probably the hottest chili beer ive consumed. The malt base is more respectable then daves. You tongue does eventually become numb mid drink and the beer becomes much easier to consume. This is flat out scorchville assault of chili peppers, its hard to judge this, it follows the guidelines with a light malt base so it would be unfair to judge this against smoked chipotle stout styles, where a stout chili beer has more chocolate/roast malt attributes.

You get hit with a little lager sweetness before the flavor profile instantly bursts into flame. Luckily this is the kinda heat that simmers down quickly, but you WILL feel this beer on your lips and tongue for ahile. Mouthfeel is like a medium lager, almost a high ABV pilsner, mouth-wise.

This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose is a blast of soaked peppers, with both the heat and the chlorophyll-laden skins coming through rather clearly. A theme that continues throughout, there is very little in the way of beer present here. The taste echoes the smell, and, as expected, the heat is there from the start in gratuitous amounts. It isn't, though, unbearable by any stretch of the imagination, but it is definitely strong and overpowering. Beyond that, no real beer character is present. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this is a fine example of peppers' innate heat being well-mobilized by a brewer, but it is unfortunately to the detriment of any other sense of beer. It'd be one thing if the peppers complemented a beer's other flavors, but here it's just pepper heat through and through. I'd still probably have another, though...","TMoney2591","Dec 12, 2012"

The head retention and lacing don't exist on this beer at all, too many pepper oils kill off the bubbles I'm assuming. The smell of the beer is loaded with pepper aromas, not much else really. The taste of the beer has a very quick malt sweetness up front that is quickly torn to shreds by the pepper flavors. The beer is spicy, it is something that needs to be sipped unless you can tolerate this type of thing. The mouthfeel it light bodied and moderately carbonated.

If you like hot salsa or anything with peppers, try this. Hurts to drink, so that's a negative.","Sean9689","Oct 09, 2011"

Aroma of peppers abounds, taste is a bit sweet at first, corny, then gives way to the peppers. Not to hot, but defanatly has some heat to it. Swish it around in you mouth for a bit. A lot of jalapeño and ancho flavor is strong to me. Good for a pepper beer, would like to try a freshie.","baconsausage","Jul 17, 2011"
2.45,-18.1,3.5,3.5,2,3,1.5,"O- Pretty cool since it has the ghost chili in it and seeing the guy from Man vs Food almost kill himself eating them. I drink just a bit of this one and my stomach felt it. I'd say this one would be really hard to drink.","nrbw23","Jul 16, 2011"

3.09,3.3,4,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"nice light amber pour gave way to There was a slight bit of pepper way in the back but it was not dominating by any means. The initial sip was a work of art. Sweet milk chocolate and sugar roll across the tongue with a lively and well carbonated feel that really lets the flavor pop. Moving through you start to feel a tingle on the tongue, a warming in the throat and a fire in the belly. Subtly the chili comes through, warming you as it goes, but by no means is this too big. This is perfectly blended in the flavor, rising subtly to a crescendo that then backs down as easy as it came up. Really very well done here. After taste of peppery notes, hints of chocolate as well coming through and leaving a long lasting tingling feeling that was hard to ignore. Awesome feel on this one, about as good as you can get and the drinkability was more then decent, given the style at hand. One of the first, and actually the only of its kind that I was able to put down with some form of regularity.","mikesgroove","Jun 26, 2011"
3.04,1.7,3,4,3,3,2,"O: A very good gimmick beverage. This really doesn't taste like beer, though. I'm glad I tried it, but i wouldn't have it again or recommend it to others unless they're interested in the gimmick itself.","Arbitrator","Jun 24, 2011"
2.4,-19.7,3,3,2,3,2,"Pours clear gold with white head. Smells of pretty much nothing but fresh chili peppers. And the taste is also dominated by chili peppers. No other flavor components to speak of. This beer does not burn your tongue, but builds up quite a burn in the back of the throat after a couple sips. Really not sure what the point of making this beer is. Not worth seeking out unless you're attracted to the gimmick factor.","waltonc","Jun 23, 2011"

Very similiar to Twisted Pine's other chiliy beer, just a more intense and longer lasting heat.","tripelhops","Beers"
3.32,11,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"O - Pretty good for what it is. I believe the hype and build-up is a little over the top for the actual payoff. There is some additional heat from the ghost pepper, but not so much as to warrant seeking this out over their Billy's Chilies.","bigaltemple","0"

2.89,-3.3,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Golden yellow beer that is moderately clear, small carbonation bubbles noticeable but nothing for head retention. Aroma is Chile and green bell peppers with onions. Flavor is initially a crisp lager but is immediately decimated by heat. While the heat is pleasantly strong it is all in the back of my mouth and very monotone. Not the best Chile beer out there, but there are many worse ones.","neorunner","May 31, 2011"

4.17,39.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a light straw color with a very smallish white head. This beer is essentially Billies Chiles, ""dry-hopped"" with ghost chiles. Nice smokey aromas, roasted hatch chiles and light straw. On the palate, this one is very light and drinkable, with flavors of smoke, fresh chiles and roasted hatch chiles, with some slowly building heat on the back of the throat. Not nearly as hot as I was led to believe, but a very well balanced and drinkable chili beer.","emmasdad","Beers"
