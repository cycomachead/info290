4.5,27.8,,,,,,"Strawberry Jalapeno Brown Ale, sounds weird right? It tastes so much better than it sounds. It's got a perfect balance of strawberry and jalapeno, and the jalapeno is mostly flavor instead of heat, which compliments the beer very well. It was one of the best beers I've ever had. I got their flight of 8 beers, and I decided it was the one I really wanted some more of the most. I will definitely be back soon.","ShaneHarris","Nov 06, 2014"

3.58,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Had a glass at the Trapp Door in Emmaus PA. It might be more accurate to call this a chili beer, since the jalapenos dominate the flavor. Of course, strawberries are also used, but they only add a mild fruit sweetness. I actually have trouble pulling brown malt notes out of this. There's the clean, fresh pepper upfront, then a touch of subtle fruit esters, but no clean toasted or roasted maltsâ€”just a slight caramel hit. An interesting beer, but it could be cleaner.","tempest","Mar 22, 2012"
