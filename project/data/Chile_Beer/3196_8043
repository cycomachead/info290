3.93,21.3,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"A good, respectable chili beer. The pepper heat starts somewhat slowly then builds in intensity. Nice combination and blending of pepper heat and gentle malt flavors. Pairs nicely with their bayou chicken/sausage pasta dish.","beergoot","Feb 13, 2014"

3.23,-0.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"On draft at the source. The beer is light orange and mildly hazy with a thin white collar. The aroma does indeed offer a healthy dose of green chilies. The flavor is one dimensional, with a light body and ample green chilies throughout. No heat or burn in the finish, which I was expecting. A fun beer to sample, and well done for what it is. I like green chilies, so it's likely that I enjoyed this more than the average consumer. Worth a try.","Huhzubendah","Apr 03, 2012"

3.1,-4.3,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"On-tap at the brewpub. This appears clear and blonde. To keep this simple, which is easy for this brew, this tastes like crisp green bell peppers in a glass. It doesn't taste like hot peppers like other chile beers, just greenhouse bell peppers. There isn't enough malt to balance out the pepper and the pepper isn't terribly tasty. It's worth a try, but not a good session beer.","tempest","Jul 11, 2009"

4,23.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Growler at PPRBSG09. This was actually one of my favorite beers of the whole gathering! Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma of salsa and tortilla chips. Flavor is largely tortilla chips with a slightly spicy finish. Not really spicy at all (and I'm very sensitive to spices). This is a great beer! If you like tortillas and salsa (like I do), then you'll enjoy this beer! So drinkable too.","LilBeerDoctor","Nov 09, 2008"
2.95,-9,3,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear golden color. !/5 inch head with decent retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of pepper and not much else. Fits the style of a Chile Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with noticeable spiciness. High carbonation level is present. Tastes strongly of peppers and not much else. There is a slightly sweet malt background, but that's it. Overall, it is noticeably peppery, but lacks other beer subtleties.","Tone","Aug 21, 2008"

2,-38.3,2,2,2,2,2,"This is one strange brew, I only had one sip and thats all I could handle, I guess I don't like peppers in my beer. Deep amber in color with an average white head, all I could smell are peppers in the aroma, strange warm spicy peppery flavors, they are light but really noticable, yuch....","maxpower","0"
