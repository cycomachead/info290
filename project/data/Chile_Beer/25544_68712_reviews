"Pretty enjoyable with moderate amount of heat at the back of the palate."

"O: good brew worth trying, you drink a few of these in a row, not over powering chili flavor"

"O: surprised so chocolatey the chili sticks to your tongue I will drink occasionally for a change up"

"Pours a clear, brown color.  1/3 inch head of an off-white color.  Good retention and decent lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of hop, hint of alcohol, and yeast.  Does not fit  the style of a Chile Beer.  Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of hop, caramel malt, yeast, hint of alcohol, and a hint of biscuit.  Overall, average appearance, aroma, and body, the chili is non-existent."

"In a word: complex. In greater detail: brown ale, but not brown ale; ancho-ie and roasted. Try it and judge for yourself."

"An interesting beer. But probably only because it happens, by chance, to taste like a Flemish ale."

"The cool, damp night was a welcome relief. The scorching sun had roasted everything within reach. The buzzards that flew overhead all afternoon had nested with their bellies empty. If it was a tavern, it was long abandoned. The barkeep had a dressing wrapped around his head at least three times, covering one eye and creating enough padding to keep his Stetson firmly in place. With his one eye and one nod, he welcomed the company. Two towns west he used to be a farmhand; one town west he was a road merchant; here, he sat in the dark. It was warmer inside but dryer than the night air because the doors and window shutters were always closed. When asked if it was to keep others out or keep him in, he grew angry and thundered incomprehensibly. Rather than face isolation, he deliberately calmed and feigned interest sparged with dry humor. Every wrinkle on his filthy visage was an evaporating river threatening to finally reveal the countless skeletons of every drowning. He was perhaps gregarious as an expectation, but never a preference. It’s as if we place ourselves amidst anguish and tease a fury ready to manifest as an assault on what is expected of us rather than what we want. Facing the shelves of empty bottles, he rubbed the back of his neck hoping to wipe away perspiration but only shook off flaking skin he had been shedding for years. Proprietors and squatters know the tales but money only tells one story. The buzzards tell the rest."

"Overall, this is only the second 5 rabbit beer I've had and I was hesitant if trying this after the disappointing golden ale I had. I was more pleased with this brew, although I don't think this is great but it's decent. I would probably drink it again."

"Overall nothing I would buy again. Quite a strange beer I was kind of turned off by the fact I bought a chili beer but roasted chilies is quite different. No heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a unique and complex brew that is both flavorful and easy to drink. As it is widely available locally, it's a beer I'm more than comfortable falling back on when more stellar offerings aren't available."

"O: This was my first chili beer and I hope to God it's my last chili beer."

"this is brutally underrated on here. a very fine chili beer, one of the more drinkable ones out there, and with a remarkable depth and complexity in front of the pepper, not behind it. its got a dark amber color, closer to brown but still glowing red, and about an inch of tan head that becomes a thin film in a few warm minutes. the nose on this is way out, honey sweetness from the red malt, fire roasted long chilies, and semisweet chocolate, as well as a slight overdose of ale yeast which is abundant on the front of the tongue at the first sip. hard to tell if its chili hotness or burn from the alcohol, the pepper gives that kind of taste and mouthfeel, and ends up both in the back of the throat and on the tip of my tongue. I love the depth here, vanilla and spice, maybe cinnamon, like something from the age of exploration, this goes seemingly beyond the ales of mexico to a much more global, albeit it primitive, time period. it takes me there, and I like that. quite a bit of body, but plenty drinkable. chili feel and taste, but not too much heat, well refined and far better than its scores indicate. my brother was right about this one, and I now am in search of other beers from 5 rabbit. this is a clever and well executed concoction."

"That said, this was an interesting, malt-forward dark ale that would work well as a night-cap or as an accompaniment to dessert."

"I'd try this one again now that the brewery itself is up and running, but trust not the Minhas contract-brewed version."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, a bit of peppers. Taste is spicy, malty, good pepper flavor without to much heat. Well done. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a different beer I wouldn't want a steady diet of, but worth a shot."

"Not something I'd seek out again, but something I'm glad I tried. A very interesting beer."
"Overall: The more I drink, the warmer my belly gets…it’s a different take on an amber ale, but nothing that I hope catches on…I definitely couldn’t drink more than one of these in a sitting as my gut would ulcer I think…I’m not even sure I’m gonna finish the one I have now…it’s interesting but not worth your precious drinking time…(2/5)"

"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a dark, rich reddish almost brown color body with a nice thick foamy head that hangs out for a bit then lays down to a nice thin lace, leaving some nice stickyness on the side of the glass. The smell has a hint of ancho chili but has a balsamic vinegar taste to it. The taste is the same as the smell, vinegar and the chili flavor comes through also. The mouth feel is ok and overall thsi is a ok beer, ihave had better. Just let this one warm up a bit then drink it, the flavors are much better."
"Overall Drinkability: This beer gets better as you drink it and as it warms a bit."
"This beer isn't too exciting for me. I wouldn't seek it out again. But if you're a brown ale fan, give it a shot. I still appreciate a brewery that tries different things."

"Amber colored with a thin white head and pretty respectable lacing. Smell is a sort of cocoa/caramel and very light chile. The taste is caramel, a strong sugar, some peppery clove, and a wonderful slow-simmer chile which never overwhelms but never really goes away. This is probably the best chile beer I've ever had."
""
""
""
"D/O- Well implemented chile heat. Not overpowering in the least as it is with most beers label ""chile"". Pleasantly surprised with this one from 5 Rabbit."
"12oz bottle, pours mahogany in color with a thin tan head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are sweet with caramel, toffee, and some spice. Tastes are sweet also, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toffee, spicy, and finishes with a bit of a kick that builds as you drink more. Mouth-feel is lighter bodied and smooth. Overall, well spiced, well balanced, not too much heat, but enough to enjoy it. Well done for the style."
""
""
"Not really sure why this beer has a lower rating. I thought this beer was tasty. Pours a dark red-brown. Has a really nice after-taste from the chilis it is brewed with. Provides a nice little bite on the way down. Nothing really bad to say about this beer. I would not drink more than a few at a time, but overall....not too bad!"
""
""
"O: While this isn't a great beer, it's a good one and the blend of a dark lager and some restrained chiles just seems to work. Bought this to pair with quesadillas and tacos and it worked just fine."
""

"I'm a little surprised there's not more body considering the substance of the head. This beer is too light for what it is; in fact, it's downright thin. There needs to be more to support what should be happening. There's a crisp nip and no liveliness otherwise. It should be smooth but isn't, and is a little slick if anything."
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, caramel, mildly spicy, faintly warming finish. Flavors a bit muddled and unbalanced, but interesting and subtle. A better match with food than on its own. Maybe a plate of tacos or a burrito."
""
"Deep ruby caramel colored ale with a big khaki tan head, fine even layered lacing, I'm scared because of the diacetyle notes already detected. Again as I popped the cap the beer comes gushing out so you better pour quickly. Aroma has dark fruit and band aid notes with hints of dark chocolate roasted malt qualities. Flavor is a cluster fuck of diacetyl, dark caramel roasted malts and supposed chili additions. Either way it's a cluster fuck of a beer that I do not enjoy and will not find a place for in my DBF. Flavor hits me so hard with diacetyl off flavors that I want to retire from beer. The actual flavor is a muddled mess of bitter chemical astringency band aids and alcohol even though it's only 6.4% abv. Look I don't have all the answers but I know beer and this is not a good variation of something I love. Mouthfeel is unbearable pretty much the most horrific beer I've come across in recent times, band aid/chemical bitterness simply kills the beer and I'm not getting any heat from a supposed chili beer. Overall staty the fuck away from this brewer."
""
"O: Pretty average overall but not terrible. THe main problem being that for a chile beer the chilly characteristics of this beer are not pronounced enough."
"O- Really glad I got to try this. I really like trying chili beers and this is another chili tick"
""
""
""
"O: A delicious chile beer. Not hot but the flavor is wonderfully mixed in to a perfectly balanced beer. At 6.4% this is an easy drinker and one that I'm glad to have had the privilege of trying."
""
"This is a good chili beer, i have drank 3 tonight, i just keep wanting to drink it, and i never open repeat beers(except maybe hopslam). I will pick up this often, happy with this purchase."
""
"Overall: I was very happy to get to try a chili beer from a brewery I hadn't heard of before. While I wasn't hugely impressed, it wasn't a bad beer, just a tad boring."
""
""
"O: For a commercial example of a chile beer, this might be worth it in a mix-six. Otherwise, I'd pass."
"Palateis smooth and a little oily. This is a chili beer I could drink one after the other."
""
""
"A nice effort - interesting flavor profile, going in it's own direction. This has the makings of being a good signature beer for this brewery. Flavorful and drinkable, but complex and unusual. Just wish it had a bit more depth."
""
""
"0 - an interesting beer...not sure if i could drink a 6 pack, but one I could share out and try.."
""
"Been waiting a long time to try this. Hope it was worth it. It pours a clear sunset garnet-topaz-amber topped by maybe a half-finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, chile flesh, dank dark greens, and a half-pinch of cinnamon. The taste brings in much of the same, though the caramel comes off much more dull, and the chiles are greener and express a decent (though still pretty small) amount of of heat. Things don't mesh entirely well, unfortunately. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly syrupy feel. Overall, not my choice when it comes to chile beers, but it's not all bad and does go down easily enough."
""
"O- This is a nice blend of chiles and softer malt support and some nice English yeast esters start to show up as the beer warms. Underneath the chiles is a great easy drinking brown ale that has lots of nice depth and character."
"O: Very nice. I actually would've preferred some more heat and possibly more of a fire roasted pepper flavor to compliment the caramel and chocolate. Overall though, quite enjoyable."
"D - I think I gave up on the last few ounces as the heat became unpleasant and the beer didn't taste good enough to warrant consuming more under those conditions. There's too much heat and not enough chili flavor - you could probably trick someone with this beer actually. Definitely interesting, but not something I'll be rushing to try again any time soon."
"If the beer matched the description it would have been a great beer, but I felt I was left out to dry. All in all not bad, but nothing I would go out of my way for again."
"D-Not a bad beer by any means, but I wish the chile was a little more pronounced in this beer; nothing really stood out while drinking this one."
"Caramel malt, some toastiness, fruity yeast and peppery spice. Ancho gives it a nice lingering spicy sweet heat in the aftertaste, subtle and nuanced. Successfully balanced without numbing heat, which can be rare in a Chile Beer. Definitely a little bit smoky, pretty malt forward. Medium carbonation, easy to drink. Paired well with food. An interesting first effort from this fledgling brewing company. Expectations are high since Mr. Mosher is involved, and this is a unique beer... a dark ale with ancho chiles added."
"This is probably the best chile beer I've ever had. I do hope they put it on the market in six packs--I cook a lot of Mexican food and it would become a dinner party staple for me."
"D: An excellent chile beer. A very distinctive taste that does not have overpowered chili presence. Surprisingly refreshing. After about 10 minutes it began to leave a warm, tingling sensation on my throat. Chili residue?"
