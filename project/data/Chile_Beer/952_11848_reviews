"Tri Pepper Pils pours a golden color with no head. There is a strong hot pepper aroma, a mixture of many different peppers. Taste has a mellow but noticeable malty backbone, with lots of pepper spices. Full flavors, especially with the pepper flavors. Overall a very nice and rich pepper infused beer."

"Enjoyed on tap at the downtown brewpub. I expected to enjoy this chile beer, and I did. One of thei best. Lacey thpugh light coloured. 30 IBU and 5.4% abv but the story is the hot peppers and its freshness was enjoyable. Fuller mouthfeel, I drank this down and it was refreshing and spicy."

"D - I refilled my glasses a few times, but I think I liked this one far more than most. I suspect a third of the growler will be used for cooking, but I imagine the results will be quite delicious. If you like peppers and chili beer this is a must-try."
"Sampled on draught at the downtown Madison, Wisconsin brewpub. Pours a clear golden copper brew with a creamy off white head that has some excellent retention and lacing. Aroma of green and red bell peppers, a touch of golden grain malt and more herbal spices. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with distinct green bell peppers, golden grain malt and black pepper. Finish starts mildly spicy and then a lingering spice burn that slowly goes away. Woo, this beer doesn't cut it for me! This beer is perfect for someone looking for an interesting challenge for his/her taste buds."
"Cloudy, light color. The smell attacks your nose with a strong pepper aroma (in a good way), and the taste of pepper is as strong. It burns your mouth a little, tingles down your throat as you drink it, and warms your insides. The pepper taste is not overwhelming though, there is still a nice pilsner taste. It is definitely for sipping, but is very drinkable despite the pepper. It is by far the beer I miss the most since moving away from Madison."
"Pours a pale yellow color - it actually starts to look a little darker in the middle, very clear, with kind of a thin head. It leaves a little lacing, but not a whole lot. The smell of dried peppers rises up to my nose, like red pepper flakes - that's the first bit that I smell. Then you get the flesh, like a fresh cut bell or jalapeno. I can also smell a bit of earthy, kind of herbal hops. There's a hint of powdery malts, but still smells very dry. The peppers smell a bit scary...I'm afraid of the burn a little, but this has to be the best chile beer I've ever smelled. The taste starts and finishes with pepper...pepper...pepper. It's not all spice though, to be honest. There's a good taste of the pepper's flesh, which I really love. There's a nice crispness to the heat. It sort of comes up, suggests to you that it's there, then fades a bit in the finish. The malt flavor is a bit powdery, like freshly crushed pale and pilsenser malts, but I'll be goddamned if the peppers don't get there first. The spice is really incredible, not bad incredible, but the kind of spice I love. This one again, stand up higher than most of the competition, while still not being the most enjoyable style. The head really adds to the feel of this beer, whether in your mouth or your stomach. Makes it feel a bit full, though I imagine that the beer itself is a bit on the thin side of medium. Either way, it kind of feels like a pilsenser, but with a bit of fire. This one is definitely a sipper. I actually really enjoy it though. Worth a show if you go to the brewpub and are looking to cross a style off the list. Or if you're a fan of a bit of spice. A good beer."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong pepper! Fits the style of a Chile Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Wow, what a spicy burn. Tastes of great fresh peppers (used to other chile beers with nothing close to this flavor of freshness) and some very slight yeast cleanliness. Overall, easily the best chile beer I've ever had."
"came a very thick malty beer with a clear body. low carbonation, pretty damn good tasting. it starts like a solid Czech pils, though much fuller in flavor and complicated. good maltiness and deliciousness all around, then the light peppery character kicks in. very lightly spicy. lingering spiciness gives a solid drinkability and very flavorful all around. a pretty decent pils, if heavy in its own right, and a great chile beer"
"Overall, very unique, and kudos to the brewing staff for brewing outside the box. I had a 4oz sample, and that is pretty much all I would want."
"Update: 2007 version, when fresh is insanely spicy. It is also clear this year. Made from Poblano, Habanero, and one other pepper, Cayenne I think... Really, this beer is hot. It causes bumps to form on the roof of my mouth."
"Thanks for my finest ""chile beer"" experience yet cokes."
"Back to the beer at hand, I honestly doubt a pepper beer can be done any better, and because of that, this might stand as Great Dane's greatest acheivement."
"Light and crisp in the mouth with solid carbonation. Take the pepper out of the picture and you've got a solid pils. Keep it in, and you've got one of the best tasting chile/pepper beers out there. Not as soft spoken as many seem to be, you know what you're drinking when you lay into this and the flavor is delightful. Suitable for A/Ced drinking, not for the hot sun."
