3.85,0,3.5,4,4,3.25,3.75,"Poured out as a clear looking golden color with a thin white head on top. The retention just leaves behind a thin film over the beer. The lacing in very minimal. The smell of the beer definitely has pepper on the nose, good amount of them. It also has a slight smokiness to it along with sweet malts. The taste is sweet for a few seconds right off the first sip then the peppers come in. There is a good amount of heat for a minute or two then it fades. The finish is kind of on the sweeter side. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice carbonation to it. Overall it's actually a pretty good chile beer, the heat comes in strong but doesn't make you wanna die, it tingles and then fades nicely allowing you to go back for another sip. It's not a beer I would drink a lot of, but having a single glass of it was enjoyable.","Knapp85","Sep 08, 2012"

4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours a clear golden yellow with a razor thin white head that fades quickly, yet provides streaky lacing. The beer was tap-served cold, but still has a sweet jalapeño spiciness in the nose. It's exactly the nose I was looking for which is a relief in comparison to the intense chilies in ghostface...The taste is outstanding and does its part highlighting the chili while also continuing to be smooth and drinkable. There is a light burn on the back of my palate, but it doesn't prevent you from taking your next sip. I think they nailed this beer and I would definitely try it again. My advice would be to use some smoked chilies to bring out even more smoothness; frankly the jalapeño beer is a little overdone and could stand a facelift!","ThePorterSorter","Apr 22, 2012"
3.85,0,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Smells a bit spicy, nothing too crazy though. Taste is medium bodied, a nice balanced ale upfront with some slight pepper flavors. Once you swallow the spiciness kicks in and is actually much hotter than I would have expected. That being said, it's a good spiciness and actually rounds out the beer pretty well. Might be tough to have more than one of these in a sitting, but definitely worth a try and one of the more unique beers I've had.","oriolesfan4","Apr 17, 2012"

2.73,-29.1,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"slight bit of pepper way in the back but it was not dominating by any means. The initial sip was a work of art. Sweet milk chocolate and sugar roll across the tongue with a lively and well carbonated feel that really lets the flavor pop. Moving through you start to feel a tingle on the tongue, a warming in the throat and a fire in the belly. Subtly the chili comes through, warming you as it goes, but by no means is this too big. This is perfectly blended in the flavor, rising subtly to a crescendo that then backs down as easy as it came up.","mikesgroove","Nov 17, 2011"

3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Not sure I understand the name, but those dogs on the bottle do look pretty fierce. The brew pours a clear golden copper topped by a finger of steadfast white foam. The nose is rather heavy on the pepper, showcasing both its inherent heat and even deeper chlorophyll levels. Some vague wheat and extremely light citrus notes lie submissive in the background (I fear for their safety). The taste immediately begins as a normal light lager-ish brew, but quickly a decent amount of peppers comes in, washing o'er all and staying through the finish, when a bit more of that lager comes in, vague floral hops, light wheat and corn, and whatnot. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying feel and finish. Overall, a nice chile beer, a hulluva lot better than most of its competitors (though I think that may go without saying...).","TMoney2591","Beers"
4.37,13.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Tastes bright pepper flavor with mild but dancing pepper sting. Malt sweet is well balanced to the pepper flavor and heat. Not much flavor in the way of malt and no hop flavor or bitter than I can detect. As far as pepper beers go, this is quality stuff.

Chocolate is detected. There's a nice twang and spice from the peppers. It's a little corny. This is more complex than I expected. It's kind of like drinking a burrito.

Appears a hazed golden yellow color with about an inch of off white foam. No lacing to speak of here. Nose is of green pepper skins, toasted malt, slightly sweet. Flavors consist of fresh green peppers, jalapeno peppers, nice amount of heat but by no means overpowering. The heat comes at your mouth, tongue and throat gradually after each sip and lingers until you take another pull from the glass. Amply carbonated with a medium body. A pretty decent chile beer with an emphasis on fresh, raw peppers.","ClockworkOrange","Oct 31, 2009"

It has a solid golden ale base, which is light and full of pale malts, but it also has a semi-aggressive pepper aroma. Jalapeno peppers are quite noticeable. The taste is good. It has a light, pale malt flavor with little to no hop character, along with a ""hot"" peppery finish. It says that it's made with jalapeno and anaheim peppers. It's mildly spicey at first then it bites you good in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a beer inspired by a recent trip to the GABF. Chili beers rock the Colorado area and now thanks to these guys they rock NY as well.","WesWes","0"
