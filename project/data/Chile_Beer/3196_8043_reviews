"Note: This is my only tasting of a chili beer. Please take note, that it could be an entire dislike for the style, rather than the merits of this style of beer."
"A good, respectable chili beer. The pepper heat starts somewhat slowly then builds in intensity. Nice combination and blending of pepper heat and gentle malt flavors. Pairs nicely with their bayou chicken/sausage pasta dish."

"On draft at the source. The beer is light orange and mildly hazy with a thin white collar. The aroma does indeed offer a healthy dose of green chilies. The flavor is one dimensional, with a light body and ample green chilies throughout. No heat or burn in the finish, which I was expecting. A fun beer to sample, and well done for what it is. I like green chilies, so it's likely that I enjoyed this more than the average consumer. Worth a try."

"Overall this is a big miss. I would not, could not, drink this beer again."
"D. Good for what it is, but not my cup of tea. It is not offensive in any way."
"On-tap at the brewpub. This appears clear and blonde. To keep this simple, which is easy for this brew, this tastes like crisp green bell peppers in a glass. It doesn't taste like hot peppers like other chile beers, just greenhouse bell peppers. There isn't enough malt to balance out the pepper and the pepper isn't terribly tasty. It's worth a try, but not a good session beer."
"Lots of fun. :)"
"Growler at PPRBSG09. This was actually one of my favorite beers of the whole gathering! Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma of salsa and tortilla chips. Flavor is largely tortilla chips with a slightly spicy finish. Not really spicy at all (and I'm very sensitive to spices). This is a great beer! If you like tortillas and salsa (like I do), then you'll enjoy this beer! So drinkable too."
"Pours a clear golden color. !/5 inch head with decent retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of pepper and not much else. Fits the style of a Chile Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with noticeable spiciness. High carbonation level is present. Tastes strongly of peppers and not much else. There is a slightly sweet malt background, but that's it. Overall, it is noticeably peppery, but lacks other beer subtleties."
"Drinkability: I guess it would be more drinkable if paired with the right food but tha maybe this beers only savior."
"D - I like Flat Branch and most of their beers so there won't be a chance that I spend my money on this beer again, when I have others that I like around."
"D - I could (and did) only have one. I probably won't ever have another one, but it was worth a try."
"This is one strange brew, I only had one sip and thats all I could handle, I guess I don't like peppers in my beer. Deep amber in color with an average white head, all I could smell are peppers in the aroma, strange warm spicy peppery flavors, they are light but really noticable, yuch...."
