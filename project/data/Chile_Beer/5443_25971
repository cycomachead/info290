3.35,1.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.25,"Brew pours a hazy 'ice tea' in color with a good 2-finger foamy off-white head that settles down quickly to nothing at all. Some minor spotty lacing is seen when sipped but really not much to mention even. The aroma is actually very light of the jalapeño peppers and not much else. Boy, when you take a sip it is really there! LOL! Warms your throat down to your stomach all the way down! Even got the top of my head a little sweaty. Actually isn't that bad as the burn doesn't last long. Lighter bodied with lots of carbonation! When I opened the bottle it just kept coming out!  Overall, it was OK if you like this style of brew. Would pair well with some Mexican or other similar food or a plate of loaded nachos. Overall it was OK if you like this style of brew.","BeerWithMike","Feb 19, 2015"

Color is hazy, no lacing, no carbonation. The taste is what hit me - a definite bite and doesn't leave a hoppy aftertaste. I think it's great paired with spicey casual foods.","Chel_in_IL","Dec 21, 2014"

3.75,13.6,,,,,,"As advertised, label is exactly what it  taste like.  If you like spicy hot food this is the beer to try out as well.  If anything the jalapeno should accelerate the alcohol to sweat out of your skin faster, to drink more....lol   After pouring you can immediately smell the jalapeno within the beer.  It's like drinking beer and eating jalapeno bread , and the aftertaste gives you a natural beer effect which makes you want to drink more.  It would be an interesting beer to cook with as well. Perhaps brats?","beechrturbo","Beers"

2.83,-14.2,3,3,2.75,2.25,3,"If you love spicy food you'll probably enjoy this beer. But the peppers here overwhelm any sense of flavor the beer has. It's like a sip of light beer with a spoonful of hot salsa at the same time. My bottle was ice-cold, yet the spicy taste almost made it seem like it had been sitting in a hot car all afternoon. A unique beer experience, just not one I care to repeat anytime soon. On a side note, Bent River Brewery does have very good food and beer on the menu....if you're in the Quad Cities area along the IA/IL border it's well worth checking out.","DaneBramage","May 18, 2014"
3.99,20.9,4,5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is quite nice. I really enjoy the pleasant, medium heat to this one. It balances the malt well, too. The Rio Grande Pancho Chile is still my favorite chile brew, but this one is a close second, and beats it in the use of heat.","TheSSG","May 10, 2014"

Some bready malt and tea leaf notes in the middle, leaving a slight tingle of heat in the back of the palate after a few sips. Overall very drinkable, I felt the craving for another glass after the first. Definitely for those who enjoy hot pepper heat, thought in the scheme of things it was relatively mild. If you don't like peppers, why would you drink this? Bunch of masochists apparently.","emerge077","Nov 27, 2011"

4.32,30.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I love this beer. It has the Bent River American Wheat beer base with a bright,fresh jalapeno taste. I really don't care for any other ""flavored"" beers like strawberry or raspberry, but this is wonderful. There is a slight burn, so people who don't like the burn of hot salsa probably won't like it. The only drawback is that sometimes it can be a little flat. I don't know why it happens with this beer at Bent, but I haven't seen it with the others they serve.","Kimber234","Mar 07, 2006"

3.43,3.9,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Well, this is my style of beer. In fact, it tastes pleasantly like a chile beer Ive made. Appears to be a golden American Ale base, but lighter on the hops. Chile burn is there, but bright and fruity, like fresh jalape?nos. Actually finishes clean, with no afterburn. This is, to this chile-head, the equal of Eskes in Taos.","DrunkMcDermott","0"
