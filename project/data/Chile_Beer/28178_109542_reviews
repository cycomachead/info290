"Overall: a very good and unique beer. Lots of strong flavors, I wish I got to taste it fresher though. Definitely worth a try for pepper lovers and hop lovers."

"i am not drinking this as i write, i had it last night and today wanted to just add a small note about it. i live in chicago and for the last month i have been buying almost exclusively bombers from pipeworks to try. at this point i am actively trying to find a beer from them i don't like. i was pretty sure this would be it. and ... it isn't. this beer is great. bizarre but great. just the intense smell of peppers and heat along with the tropical sweetness makes you think that this will be a scorcher but somehow it isn't. you do get all the flavor of the hot peppers but an almost complete absence of heat, just a small tickle in the back of your throat. and it blends perfectly with the tropical fruit, both from the hops and the passionfruit. i am at the point that i can say if it's from pipeworks, buy it."

"Pours a hazy golden with heavy amber accents capped by a one and half slightly off-white head. Above average retention, some splotchy lacing. Chiles, passionfruit, and mixed citrus on the nose. Passionfruit, papaya, mango, mandarin orange upfront, sweet citrus-tinged malt midpalate. Finishes with chilies with little to no heat complemented by more mixed citrus. Heavier side of medium bodied, moderate carbonation, slick and somewhat silky with hint of creaminess. A very unique and enjoyable beer. I've never had anything like this. The chile pepper essence and signature ""zing"" is there, but little to no heat. Recommended."

"o - I'll just come out and say that I love peppers, I eat them in every which way- hot, sweet, raw, cooked, pickled--you name it. I can't say that I am a big fan of how they work with beer though. I would say this was worth trying, but not sure I'd pick this up again."

"O: I was worried with the smell that it would have a bite of heat but ended up being really nice and fruity with the flavor of the pepper. I'm a big fan of heat and all and quite sensitive of heat but love the flavor of peppers, which I got in this beer. Love this beer."

"Overall: I'm not really sure what to make of this brew. I love the pepper presence but was surprised by the lack of heat on the flavor. After the peppers there isn't much here. Is this a pale ale with peppers added or a chile beer? Either way it is very tasty but is off balanced."

"Strange brew, indeed. I love all the components of this beer individually, like the concept of how they can compliment each other, but felt it was a competition vs. collaboration of the ingredients."
"Fuck it, this beer should have been hit with a dose of Brett Lambicus on the back end to add a note of complexity. Get to it Garrett."

"O- Pipeworks did it again with this amazing beer. It has so many flavors going on but yet they are so balanced and you get to have them all in one sip. Too many times you buy something like this and you get something different on every sip but never all in one."

"Overall: Really an impressive beer, the kind of thing where I would go back to the store and by 10 bottles so I can just have a store of it because who knows when they'll brew it again. If you like wheat beers, chile's, and fruit, this is the beer you have been waiting for. Although Pipeworks is known for powerful pale ales and stouts, I'm a wheat beer fan and this is as good as anything else they've done including the amazing Pineapple Bling and Peppercorn Saison. Way more flavorful than the saizon and way more body and mouthfeel than the pineapple bling."

"overall by far my favorite chile beer. so impressed."

"I was really impressed with this beer. What the Aviary helped them do (I assume because this kind of thing is more in their wheelhouse) with the chiles makes for a really unique and enjoyable experience. It allows for the chilies to dominant the aromatics but get out of the way of the hops in the taste while still adding complexity to the mouthfeel. It's one of those beers that is almost as fun to sniff as it is to drink but not for the usual reasons. It seems to be a nod to the Aviary's philosophy of creating unique/unexpected sensory experiences with their drinks. I think they do this here in a non-gimmicky way. The discripency between the expectation of how it will taste on the tongue based on the aromatics to how it actually tastes is momentarily shocking…in the best possible way. The passionfruit puree is well integrated and, combined with a nice level of carbonation, makes for a really refreshing drink. It's a complex and well executed beer…maybe the most ""refined"" thing I've seen from Pipeworks and I've always been a fan."

"Mouthfeel is good. Moderate carbonation a balances the big body and bold flavors."
