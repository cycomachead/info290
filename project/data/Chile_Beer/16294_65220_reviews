"Malt sweetness dominates things, a little too much. What's really missing is any significant chili pepper heat or flavor. What does appear is so faint and so far into the background as to be nearly invisible. The beer comes across rather one-dimensional and lacks balance, depth, and complexity."

"My initial impression to this beer was ""a chili tripel? What? Really? Why?"". After having tried it a couple of times, that continues to be my opinion on it. Interesting idea - and one that could work provided the right food pairing - but overall it's simply a regrettable offering. The departure from stylistic guidelines doesn't bother me; fact is this recipe just plain isn't very good."

"O: I like the idea, but I found that this tasted like a poorly made DIPA infused with chile, rather than a Tripel infused with chile."

"Overall - a delicious and dangerously drinkable big chile beer. Highly recommended for some innovation, and good flavor profiles with the striking contrast between a spicy tripel and the raw heat of chiles."

"Overall: Interesting idea, and I do like the chile combination with some beer styles but the Tripel isn't one of them"
"This beer poured out as a golden color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer wasn't very strong with pepper at all. The smell was mostly like any other Tripel out there really. The taste of this was rather mild. I wasn't really picking but much spice at all in this beer. The flavors of grains and bready Belgian yeast were prominent in this one. The mouthfeel was decent but I felt like it was a little on the flat side. Overall this beer wasn't overly impressive to me, I felt as though it needed something a little more to put it at a better level for me. It was decent but wouldn't buy it again."
"Upon hearing of this beer's existence, I had to track it down and try it. A chile tripel? Let's dance: It pours a partly cloudy sunrise amber topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises black pepper, light white bread, light clove, and the lightest possible kiss of mild caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, but now the peppers come in, close to the finish, providing some spice and a decently small bit of heat. Honestly, the peppers really bring this thing together, rescuing it from general mediocrity. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, an interesting beer, one that doesn't necessarily win on all accounts, but it does generally satisfy."
"O: Quite special taste to it but still very drinkable, nice one to open an evening with. I havenÂ´t really tasted anything like this one before."
"The chilis in this beer show up late to the game, only in the dry finish do I get them, the spice is real though, the forward of the beer is a little boring, not great, just OK. I don't hate it I just don't understand it or care enough to drink it again."
"Reveal: Wow. Midtfyns Bryghus Chili Tripel. So far off. I guess chili is what I thought the booze was. Don't get anything remotely resembling a tripel in this one."
"O: Not the worst beer I've ever tried, but it's certainly forgettable."
"I let this warm a bit out of the fridge. Poured with a smallish, off white head that quickly settled down to a small island and no lace. Color is an orange honey medium dark amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, malt, bandages, toffee, astringent, minerals. Flavor is similar to nose, yet doesn't yield the chili straight up; the bandages are prominant along with sweetness. Chili heat comes in quite mild later. Body is ok and ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor and even with the heat, not that good. Don't want any more. Cook with it???"
"O: This beer is quite enjoyable. The chile works quite well to complement the style-- somebody really thought the taste combination through, and it shows. Well done."
"Overall: Very special brew, nice!"
"M - Barely less than medium bodied, smooth."
"Chilies and Tripels, two of our favorites. Score! Crackling lace; cloudy amber color. Peppery aroma from the alcohol and chili pepper, also with kiwi and taffy. Crisp and slick medium body, the caramel maltiness fades. The chili heat grows to an even warmth. A little chewy malt, taffy and dried grass. Light hop bitterness. Alcohol is strong but not reckless. Finishes with the chili warmth, alcohol vapor and some malt remnants. At first, the taste buds ask where the chili is, but sip after sip it becomes more prevalent--a darker Tripel that's more refined than extreme. An exciting ride."
