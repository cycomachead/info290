"Poured a brass color with a thinner white head atop.Light chili notes along with some leafy hops and caramel.Flavors of the chili hit in the throat but they are not overly big,just a nice subtle burn with a smattering of hops.More tame than many other chili beers wich sometimes can be a good thing."

"Ive had each batch, and it varies. This was the first batch. The second batch was sweet and peppery (no heat), the third was less hot than the first but the head built on you the same way."
"Pours a golden yellow with very little head. The nose offers very mild hops and a hint of habanero. First sip is a little disappointing, there's not really much to offer. At first it seems like just a lackluster pale ale. A few more sips begin to reveal the subtleties. The peppers begin to come through on the finish, and after a few sips one can really begin to enjoy some spice. This beer is well carbonated and crisp. This is nice change of pace from your usual pale ale if you enjoy spicy food."
"A unique, interesting beer. I enjoy beers with a complex hint of spices, especially in the winter time. However, this is the first beer that I can recall trying that blended peppers into the mix. I was pleased by the careful balance Triangle Brewing achieved. A nice smoky hop aroma with subtle habanero pepper, but also hints of some other spices. The heat of the habanero was just enough to enjoy, creeping in as you swallowed the drink, giving you a pleasant warming sensation. If you like spicy food then there is a good chance you will enjoy this beer."
