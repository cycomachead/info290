"Ale and a chili pepper is really the only description you need. By itself the taste was horrid, however it had a really cool look with the clear glass and the light colored beer with a chili pepper floating in the bottom.  Used the second bottle in a beer cheese dip recipe, that was great."
"This one has to go as one of the top novelty beers out there for the simple fact that they include a whole serrano chili pepper in every 11.2 oz. bottle. Coupled with a clear glass bottle and the transparent yellow liquid, the highlight of the show is on full display. I split this with a friend at Cafe Craft in North Charleston, SC, but insisted that I got to keep the pepper (rock-paper-scissors for the win!).  After pouring half in to a pint glass, it appears a little cloudier than I originally thought. Not even a hint of any foam on top. It looks like an extremely cheap macro-lager with an army green pepper ominously floating in the depths. Canned green beans, spicy pepper and a touch of vinegar in the nose. The flavor is pretty much what I expected. A watery adjunct with a slight corn flavor and pronounced pepper heat. The pepper starts out fairly strong and builds on your palate to create a burning sensation. In fact, the spiciness elicited a few sneezes in quick succession, then left a pleasant burn in my mouth and throat. This is as advertised. Mexican corn swill with a fantastic pepper punch. I just wish I would have let my friend eat the serrano pepper. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT eat that. I can't even describe the taste. It gives no appreciable added heat and fills your mouth with a disgusting flavor. Overall, this  one is great if you like palate scorchers. I can appreciate this after sampling many purported pepper beers that give little to no spicy heat. I may be in the minority on this one, but I'd happily have it again."

"A respectable chili beer that lacks looks yet does a great job of presenting the heat. Fair enough for the style."

"Proving once again that I will try anything once, I Pop!ped the cap and began the pour, albeit more gently than usual as I wanted to decant the “chili pepper added”.  I also queued up RHCP, Grateful Dead’s “Friend of the Devil” and the Rolling’s Stone’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on YouTube as musical accompaniment. Between my gentle pour and the beer’s inherent carbonation, it was as fizzy as soda pop and quickly fell to wisps. Nose was astounding in the sense that I was taken aback by its heat. This was not going to be like the previous Tommyknocker Chile Beer and no one was going to have any sympathy for me. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, "

"Poured from a clear 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with no head whatsoever. Smell is of spicy peppers. Taste is awful. Pure heat, a light pepper aftertaste, spiciness is overpowering rendering this beer undrinkable. Feels light and hot in the mouth and overall this beer would is on the list of worst 10 beers I ever drank."

"O: This beer is all about the chili. There's no balance and all you get is peppers, but maybe this isn't a bad thing for the style, if all you want is peppers. If you are looking for balance, you need to pair this one with some nachos and guacamole."

"Picked up a bottle because the store I stopped by was selling them as singles. Figured, should be interesting anyway. And that is about the most I can say. Not a great beer, but certainly not bad. A nice light beer. The pepper is an interesting twist. If you like spice it might work for you but not much more than a interesting try."
"Don't get burned by this devil. Keep looking."

"I picked this beer up in a rushed frenzy with a handful of other chili beers not knowing this actually had a pepper in the bottle until I took it home, was initially disappointed but after giving this beer a try, I can actually say it wasn't bad.. I actually enjoyed it, it was interesting and rather refreshing."
