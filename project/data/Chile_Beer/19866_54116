Taste is lemony and yeasty at first with light fruity notes, but when the peppers are in there and take all over the place. Light body. Good carbonation. Hot mouthfeel, too hot for my liking in fact.

4.35,5.1,4,4.5,4.75,3.25,4,"holy sour chili beer! the perplexity of this beer starts with aroma and ends about 5 minutes after you finish your last drink. the appearance is a golden hue with minimum white head. the head settles out to a weird flocculation partially due to the bret n chili. the aroma is mostly brett and strong super citrus. the taste is a whole new ballgame. its initially like a traditional wheat/saison hybrid (session-able/ coriander/ peach) then it its touches on the side palette with bret and spunk. it hits the back of the throat with huge chili flavor. the worst. the worst part about this beer is when it gets room temp... its better with more enticing flavor. this is one i look forward to having this around during the summer time to grill with.","KriegerNco","Apr 09, 2014"

It poured very crisp, clean and clear and the aroma eminating out of the tulip glass was a blast of citrus goodness that made my mouth start watering. The taste was right in line with the citrus but slowly evolved with heat and the mouthfeel was so effervescent and finished clean with the lingering slight burn of the peppers.

4.2,1.4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"one of the most unique beers ever. a low alcohol sour beer, blonde in color with a splotchy white head, with african chili peppers as hot as habanero. the nose on this is just amazing, bright citrus notes after the intense tartness and lactic sourness back off. mouth watering fruits, pears and peaches, and very little clue of the peppers at all. the flavor starts like a neat blonde sour, maybe sour mashed, acidic but not caustic, soft in feel and very light on the grain front. next comes a strong wave of citrus fruit, followed immediately by an slowly escalating heat that warms the throat and tongue after the swallow but never gets too hot. its a brilliant showcase of this peppers flavors without detracting from the beer with a stomach wrenching heat. finish is long and warm without being too much at all. i can hold the beer in my mouth and taste it for 30 seconds if i want to, but the peppery heat doesn't come on until i swallow it. very light body on this, and plenty of sour. my first chili sour beer i think, and its a major success. some of the best upright beer I've had for sure, and something that demands food pairings of the most interesting sort. so cool.","StonedTrippin","Feb 04, 2014"

4.2,1.4,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"This was my first beer from Upright Brewing (Portland, OR). I drank this beer during Super Bowl XLVIII, as the Broncos' championship hopes were being crushed. However, this Fatali Four was a bright spot in an otherwise forgettable Super Bowl experience. The beer poured a hazy golden color with a medium white head. The smell had notes of lemon, wheat, and Brett funk. The taste was quite exceptional. The flavor reminded me of a fresh squeezed summer honey lemonade with big floral notes, Brett funk, and cayenne peppers on the finish. I say ""summer honey"" because this beer had huge floral notes throughout, which are associated with honey harvested in the summertime. I was amazed by the complex balance of the lemon tartness, the floral honey sweetness, and the spicy kick of cayenne-like pepper on the finish. I thought the flavors really played beautifully with each other. This may have been my favorite chile beer of all-time, as I really liked how the Fatali peppers played a complimentary role to add another element of flavor dimension rather than having the entire beer be dominated by chile heat. I was really impressed with Upright and am looking forward to trying more of their beers.","lmperialChad","Jan 19, 2014"

4.81,16.2,4.5,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,"Fatali Four pours a light bodied, mildly cloudy and bright yellow gold in color with a two finger bright white head. It's surprising how light in color it is. The nose is bright and citrusy with a good amount of lemon with a touch of citrusy sweet followed by a moderate amount of pepper. For a pepper beer, the nose is overly complex. The flavors are all saison up front. It's light and really citrusy with a good amount of lemon and a night, almost Berliner Weiss esque tartness. The beer then goes into the pepper, leaving your mouth with a light tingle from the heat for the next five minutes. It then leaves your mouth watering. God I love this. It drinks light and crisp and the tartness is perfect. This is by far the best pepper beer I've had, and I've searched them out. This beer is definitely worth a try. It's some of Upright's finest work.","aasher","Jan 16, 2013"

Citrusy and tart character were noticeable on the first whiff with a little malty sweetness, some yeasty notes and slight chile notes coming through. Very nice tart spicey flavors upfront on the palate but the chile spice is well balanced and not over done. I did get a little grain, mild bretty funk and citrusy accents. The brew was medium to light in body with moderate amount of carbonation which had a mild funky, citrusy, slightly spicey tart and subtle dry finish. Very well done beer and enjoyed it for sure.","Gobzilla","Jan 11, 2013"

The aroma doesn't really prepare you for what's to come, it smells more like a typical Upright saison with a hint of spice/pepper in there. The flavor, however, is a whole different story. I typically think of chile beers as a bit of a gimmick, but this beer is the first of its kind I've had that really did a fantastic job of incorporating the peppers into the flavor of the beer without having it overwhelm it. The light, slightly spicy, more typical-saison Four's flavors just meld perfectly with the spicy peppers, and you get a nice, mildly spicy kick at the end. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this beer.
