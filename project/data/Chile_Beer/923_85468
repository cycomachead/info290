The pleasant aroma tickles the nose is spicy hatch chiles and cocoa. It's delicious to say the least, not overspiced nor weak. In fact, it reminds me of a lighter Xocoveza, and those cinnamon, chile, and brown sugar notes really turn me on. It's in between light and medium bodied, and despite fuzzy carbonation, this is a beer that I will be looking forward to meeting again.","DoubleJ","Nov 29, 2014"

3.86,7.8,3.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. This beer is deep black, only slightly brighter around the edges. A frothy mocha head forms and then completely disappears almost immediately. I caught a ton of varied aroma on the pour, all of which were confirmed in the still glass: nice milk/dark chocolate balance, vanilla, cinnamon, and a hint of vegetal spiciness. The taste isn't as nice as the nose, but still contains some decent cocoa and a hint of the cinnamon. It's all corralled by the pepper spiciness, which feels higher in the balance than it should be. Everything tastes decent together, but I wish that more of the wonderful sweet spices contained in the nose were present in the taste. Body is light and slick, the pepper spiciness again keeps any of the sweetness from becoming overbearing. IMO, beers like this should lay the sweet flavors (milk chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon) on thick, balance them with dark chocolate/slight hop bitterness, and then use the spice as a tool to keep the finish dry and leave the imbiber wanting more. Mole stout seems a bit out of whack (compared to the Hunas/Abraxis's of the world, which really isn't fair), but for 9-12 per sixer and at an ABV that makes it sessionable within it's style, it's definitely worth checking out if you (like me) can't get enough of the Mexican hot chocolate stout trend.","Thepleasantimbiber","Nov 02, 2014"

Like many chili pepper beers, the presence of a head is problematic as far as visual appeal goes, and the aroma is rather tame, but these minor quibbles shouldn't stop someone who wishes give their taste buds a treat.","beergoot","Sep 28, 2014"

I am glad I picked it up, and am enjoying the experience, but it's not one that I'd want to make my go to every day: I'm just not interested in drinking mole all the time.

The aroma was of sweet caramel malt and cocoa that did not fully encapsulate the flavors to come. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with less cocoa on than the aroma, but what the aroma did not represent was the spice. There were flavors of cinnamon and cardamom with a slight hint of clove which was all very autumn appropriate. While I didn’t detect much heat from the chile peppers I did detect a bit of their bittery presence. The flavor did leave the lingering presence of Mole on my palate which is an obvious target. Definitely an interesting brew and probably with more heat fresh.","brurevu","Sep 08, 2013"

An inverted Glug began a nice bit of pseudo-cascading action, but I finally had to back off to avoid overflow. I had a brief, fizzy finger of deep-tan head with low retention as the result of my efforts. Color was a deep, dark-brown which allowed ZERO light penetration. The melange of scents emanating on the nose was fabulous! Chile pepper? Check. Cocoa chocolatiness? Check. Other unidentifiable spices? You bet. No lacing, but an oily film laid atop the beer. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and I was worshipful of the idea that they did not go overboard on the Scoville units. Just as IBUs measure a beer's hoppiness, SUs measures a pepper's heat and I am not terribly tolerant of heat. This tasted like my buddy, Ernie's, mom's mole and that is saying something! She was a great cook and knew how much I appreciated her culinary works. The three main ingredients really worked well together to create a spicy, peppery, chocolaty taste that I find hard to describe otherwise. The finish held a heat that lingered well after the swallow and I am again glad that they did not go overboard. This could be a scorching beer if they allowed it to be as such. Phew. This is what I would describe as an acquired taste.","woodychandler","Jun 08, 2013"

Head is non existent, as is any form of lacing. As I take a long deep smell, the first thing that comes to mind is Red Hots candy. This candy cinnamon quality remains at the forefront and basically dominates other notes. There's some mild dry cocoa in the background. The taste is similar. Candy cinnamon a la Big Red gum or Red Hot candy, plus dry cocoa, and a touch of roasty malt profile. The finish features more cinnamon and chocolate with the chili leaving almost zero heat. The mouth feel is a bit prickly with a medium body. Overall, this beer is enjoyable, but not amazing like I was hoping. New Belgium's Cocoa Mole pulled this off in a much better way.

3.97,10.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This can is an Austin Powers joke waiting to happen...(but, then again, I never liked those movies...) It pours a deep, murky black-brown topped by a half-finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, earthy peppers (complete with mild heat), roasted malts, light molasses, and brown sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, with the peppers and cinnamon combining for a unique flavor combination, all whilst the roast dances fancily behind it all. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a very nice peppered stout, one that could probably stand to be year-round... Good times.","TMoney2591","Oct 05, 2012"
3.92,9.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"liked this way better than the new belgium one. poured blackish brown, super dark, with almost no head. looks almost flat, but there is some depth to the color. smell is bitter bakers chocolate and cocoa powder, with just a hint of pepper. the flavor is that dusty cocoa up front, with a lot of smokey malt to balance it out. i feel no chili heat in this at all, which i like. the peppers provide just a subtle bit of flavor, nothing too drastic. the chocolate in the finish is also very nice, a little sweeter than on the front end. feel isnt as good as it could be. it needs some more carbonation to pep up its big body. that said though, this is a cool new beer from ska. i would like to make a pot of chili with it at some point. those flavors would be outstanding in there.","StonedTrippin","Oct 05, 2012"

It's really tasty at first, but after about 1/2 can (once it warms up), they grind on the palate a bit. I haven't had that with other beers like this.","Domingo","Oct 02, 2012"

3.5,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours black with a nice dark brown head. Head retention is not a strength for this one. Aroma is dominated by the cinnamon, underneath there is a touch of some roastiness, chocolate, and heat from the peppers. Flavor again started strong on the cinnamon, perhaps a touch too strong, but then in the rear there is some cocoa, something offering a little sweetness, some roastiness, and a hit of some bitterness in the finish.This isn't hot in any uncomfortable way, but there is definitely heat to it. I thought the mouthfeel on this was nice, medium bodied, a little creamy. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. Not on par with Cocoa Mole (only other chile stout/porter I have tried) but I am glad to have been able grab a sixer of this.","denver10","Sep 29, 2012"

3.44,-3.9,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Had to ding the appearance because while this beer started out with a huge head it was almost immediately gone. Dark black with a few bubbles at the surface. Aroma is cinnamon, cocoa, peppers, pretty good. Flavor follows suit but is really not robust enough and feels like it has a watery aftertaste. Both Cocoa Mole from New Belgium and Mexican Chocolate Stout from Copper Kettle are better beers, probably due to the body being thicker.","ArrogantB","Sep 28, 2012"

I also get a hint of chocolate and some roasted malt. The flavor is very nice. What really comes through early is some cinnamon and chocolate, as well as a hint of heat from the peppers. I also get some of the earthiness from the chilies as well as some nice chili flavor. The chocolate and chili notes meld very well together, with just the right amount of heat and sweetness.
