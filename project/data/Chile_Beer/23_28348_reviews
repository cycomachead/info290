"Good beer with nice spice."
""
"This is a fine beer for making chili, and that's about it. I can't drink this. It's just too harsh on the peppers. It's like drinking straight pepper juice."
"vomitous, rancid, my first straight chili beer and probably the last."
"Mouthfeel and carbonation is similar to that of a traditional unfiltered,  lager."
"Yuck yuck yuck yuck and more yuck!"

"Great nose - like green cactus salsa!   Definitely recommend."
""
"I really enjoy this beer! With fresh chiles, you really get a full mouth of spice and refreshing lager. I love pairing this with cheeses and/or a nice bowl of chili on a cold evening."
""

"I was excited to try this beer, good chile aroma and taste at first, but it had that wheatty finish which tastes like something rotten to me. The head was light, fluffy and effervescenty and quickly dissipated.  Birdsong Jalapeno pale ale and Ballast Point Habanero Sculpin are way better.  Those are the only other two peppery beers I have tried so far."
""
"Serving type: bottle."
""
"T: A little cardboard flavor to start out. Slight metallic. Wet hay, chili and pepper spice. Little ascorbic lemon on the follow. Keeps palate warm. Slight nasal drip from spice, but not crazy. It's one of the beers you think chile of first, not a beer that happens to have chiles."

"O: While it's pretty insipid, I think this would make a fantastic chili adjunct - it's not over the top like Ghost Face Killah, yet still brings a wonderful pepper character. Too bad that's its only real note to speak of. Try it once, if you want."
""
"O: This beer is very hot and spicy, but if you can handle very spicy food like atomic wings it is manageable. This reminds me a lot like the brewery's Ghost Face Killah, except that that beer has little drinkability whereas this isn't nearly as hot because it doesn't have the intense heat of the ghost face chiles."

"O - A really good chili beer that delivers some spice."
"D: Of the other chili beers I've tried this is the best one... It is what it is a chili beer.... As for my chili I made with the other 1/2 of the beer... If was fantastic, the best chili I've ever made... I will look for this beer for my next chili."
"Overall: Authentic and hot with heat. But nothing I'd want to session."
" Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a large white fizzy head that settles down to just a thin line. Spotty lacing was seen with each sip. Lots of bubbles from the carbonation. The aroma of various peppers (actually Anaheim, Fresno, Serrano, Jalapeno & Habenero peppers) hits your nose right up front with some grain. The taste at first starts out sweet then the heat of the peppers hits your tongue with some heat BUT doesn't last long after, then the taste of malt. Not overpowering at all. Stronger than ""Dave's Chili Beer"" with the single pepper at the bottom of the bottle. Overall, this is pretty good and is different."
" The taste is good, peppery and dry with a subtstantial heat in the pepper flavor with a very light grain flavor in the background almost chalky with a lightly vegetal pepper taste that lingers after the swallow. The drinkability is very good - nicely spiced and pretty nice when paired with food I wouldn't really want to try to have a session with Billy's Chillies though"

"O: Overall drinkable, nice blend of peppers, a little sting on the backend, warming glow of peppers that make you aware but not uncomfortable. Its a chili pepper beer, plain and simple, it brings a modest display of heat range, limited range of complexity beyond the peppers and a novel approach that is somewhat decent but may fall a bit short of good."
""
"This is one of the oddest flavor medleys I've had for a beer. It is spicy and unique. It is also like salsa -without the chunks of course. Did I mention the burning?"

"O: Definitely one of the better chili lagers that I have had - there are better chili beers available but they are almost always much more intensely flavored styles of beer that can more easily support the chilies. I didn't find this one too hot or too intense but not sure that I would want to have more than one of these in a session."
"Wow what a beer....I don't think I have ever had a beer that was so interesting. The beer poured a nice clear golden color with white head that laced somewhat. The scent and taste was absolutely....PEPPER!!!! The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall I am not sure I could drink alot of this....but boy o boy its tasty."

"Billy's Chilies pours a dark golden color, with no head. There is a fresh chilly pepper aroma. The taste has a strong and fresh chilly pepper taste, and finishes with a kick of spice in the back of your mouth. The only flavors present are those of chilies, and the spice may make it hard to drink, hard to drink even one. Overall a good beer if you enjoy hot chilly peppers."
""
""
"The main attraction here is not the spiciness, which I'm a glutton for, but the vegetable replication (or, should I say, representation). It's a beer for beer-lovers who love peppers. I love peppers. So does my girlfriend. This beer is, indeed, for us. And, we both really enjoy drinking it."

"Drinking this at the brewery!!! This beer has five peppers in it! So it pours up a nice clear golden color with as mall white head. Aroma of Serrano and jalape√±os. The peppers dominate the nose. Taste of pale malts and peppers!!! I love it. Just a kiss of spice. Light bodied, very smooth. Great pepper beer!!"
""

""

""

"The aroma consisted of smoked chilies. Medium bodied, a foundation of cereal grains- much like a simple lager- spicy hot chili peppers come through right away and dominate the brew. Not a lot of balance or complexity."
""
"Recommended, for style."
""
""
""
""
"As you can imagine, there was a very distinct aroma and taste to this beer. It was infused with 5 different peppers and they spicy after taste lets you know they're there. Interesting, but not a favorite by any means."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent chili beer. It's a bit simple though. It has a great pepper flavor which I think could be utilized in a more flavorful beer to make something a bit more intriguing. I probably won't buy this again, but I did enjoy it for what it was this time around."

"Light head, solid lacing; ""where's the breakfast burrito?""; Indeed, the breweries site recommends this beer with a breakfast burrito; felt like some hot pepper jack cheese and a butter cracker would be a great compliment as well; distinct almost burning nose; very noticeable, although not intense, chili flavor all down the throat; full flavor, fun; great accessible experimental beer; four days after we tried it, I still find myself craving this beer."
""
""
"i should start by saying this is not my favorite genre of beer. however, this is a well made pepper beer, as they go. 5 types of peppers are used here, and you can feel the heat. it pours an unassuming pale color with an average white head. the nose is chili hot, with some pale malt backing. the flavor is in my opinion overpoweringly hot, not as brutal as the ghostface, but its intese capsaicin right off the bat. fortunately it doesnt last that long in its most intense form, and mellows with the malts until the finish, where it leaves a powerful heat on the throat and lips. i know some people get off on these, but this just isnt for me. the mouthfeel would be fine if it werent for all that residual heat. overall a cool beer for those interested, but it was just too hot for me."
""
""
"I poured this into a perfect pint glass. It has a straw color body with a small very fizzy head. The smell is crazy of green chilies and serrano chilies but nothing else cuz the chili smell is very powering. The taste is strictly chili pepper taste up front but not extreme heat though. The mouth feel is very nice and leave a nice peppery/burning sensation in your mouth, Overall i like this beer and would recomend it to somebody who want to try something different and out of the ordinary."
"O - a good chilie beer... Not too overwhelming which is nice and makes it still drinkable"
""
""
""

"O- fairly good pepper beer. Overall taste is a little lacking but has a nice pepper flavor to it."
""
""
"Surprisingly powerful pepper smell. Color is a bit cloudy, nothing remarkable. First taste is a light, smooth beer, but then a strong pepper after taste that actually packs a punch of heat. I had never ever heard of a Chile Beer until I tried this one. I definitely want to try another."
""
"D - If you like the pepper flavored ones, yes. If you were hopeful to find some more beer favor, not so much."
""
""
"OVERALL: Good take on the style. I'm impressed with this one from Twisted Pine."
"M: moderate carbonation and medium body."
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is very similar to the juice you get in canned jalapenos, with some sweet biscuit malt also thrown in. The flavor is a mix of bread and jalapeno notes that burns the throat as it goes down. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not one of the better hot and spicy beers I have tried."
""
""
"It's a decent looking beer, a fairly carbonated golden color with plenty of floaties that are prevalent enough to cloud it. Decent sized head that doesn't last long. Aroma of chilis and light malts. The taste is just about what I'd expect from the style, light pale malts and a touch of caramel at first, followed by a firm chili pepper heat that lingers through the finish. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the drinkability is about what you'd expect. A very good chili beer that delivers what I want from the style. Chilis and beer! That said, I didn't really find this one hot, maybe that's what it's big brother Ghost Face Killah is for. And, go figure, I have one in the fridge! But that's a tale for another day."
"O - This is a nice chilie beer. Not too hot and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great chili beer, perfect to have with some hot wings, a bowl of chili (surprise!), or as a compliment to any other spicy food you might like."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: As my first chili beer, it's not bad. That said, it's too simple and boring. I do like the spice on the finish, however. Really only worth a try if you're a big fan of the style."
""
""
"D - I'd drink this one again, though it's not sessionable by any stretch. I compliment the brewers for attempting to build a chili beer around a decent foundation. Certainly the best attempt at the style I've come across."
"Conclusion: My first chilie beer, and I like it quite a bit. I love hot food and almost any type of chilie I have ever tasted, and of course I love beer so the two together is very tasty. For this particular beer however, I could go for more chilie flavor and heat, but the way it is works well too."
""
""

""
"Overall interesting for sure, but I think it could use some work."
"I picked up a bottle of this one at a liquor store recently (to drink next to Ghost Face). Light golden color with a decent white head. Aromas of biscuit, light chiles and sweet malt. Crisp and refreshing, with a little heat and flavors of chiles, biscuit and sweet malt."
"Overall, this is pretty good for what it is."
"This is like a good (or at least better) version of Cave Creek Chili Beer. The brew is a pale straw-gold, translucent, and generally projects an Adjunct Lager look; aside from the pepper addition, it is like an AAL in all respects. The nose is quite akin to the spicy nacho cheese cup that you get with the chips at the movie theater; it is not bad, however, it is more like a guilty pleasure, or a harkening to days past. The flavor reiterates the theme with equal parts corn-chip and spicy serrano-jalapeno flavor. It is admittedly just a hair's breadth away from being a debacle, and yet it retains that hair's distance above. It is in that precise nailing of flavor that Billy's Chilies makes its mark; it is not just gimmicky, it is a paradigm of frill-added merchandise."
"Ah yes, a chili beer. I love unconventional ingredients in beers and nothing says unorthodox than five different hot pepper tastes crammed into one 12 ounce bottle! Pours a rich auburn color with a tight head. The smell is spicey with caspian and light pineness. Taste was what I hoped for. I could almost feel the flame roasted pepper skins on my tongue. Nice heat but not overpowering with some light hopping in the background. It was a little hard to distinguish the different peppers but I still loved it. Great beer Twisted Pine!"
"Overall - I really enjoy this beer, not more than one and not every day, but every week or so with mexican or other spicy food, it's a nice change of pace, but if you don't like spicy food or hot peppers, than this isn't going to change your mind."
"As someone who loves spicy food, this is a true delight. Sure, the taste isn't that great and the beer itself feels a bit on the slimy side. But none of that matters when that Scoville rush hits. So far this is the finest example of a chili beer I've ever had."
"Afternote: The first beer was ok, but two of the subsequent beers of the six pack were real gushers when opened. It might be a good idea for people to open this over a sink to prevent sadness."
"A very interesting beer. The name gives away the chili aspect. Pretty spicy, I love spicy food but I am not sure about my beer. With the right meal this could be a fabulous beer. I would be happy to have a few in my fridge for mexican food night. Otherwise, its a bit intense on my stomach for my beer likes. I'm not sure I'd like the next morning on a john after six of these guys."
"T - Lightly sweet malt up front with a little bit of herbal hop character. The chili pepper flavors come on strong in the middle with lots of roasted pepper flavor and some subtle spiciness. The beer finishes with dry, bre"
"D- Overall, I enjoyed this beer for what it is. It is not a beer that you are going to sit down and want to drink all night but it is a nice change of pace from the regular beer. I'd be interested to see how this beer pairs with food."
"A weird beer but not bad."
"The 5 chile peppers, laggerish. Lighter mouthfeel, lighter colour, and a little too carbonated. Still some pepper aroma and taste.Would be greater with food.Must try but one dimensional, a germ killer.Can pour onto food.Drink lots of water afterwards."
"D - Easy drinking - seems like the ABV is low. Can be a little bit filling. Flavors are certainly potent and dominating, but surprisingly the chilies don't create a residual hotness. Goes well with pizza."
"Generic mild ""beer taste"" (as the description on the bottle so accurately suggests) on the front end of the palate, quickly turning bold and spicy. I'm quite impressed by the sheer true spicy peppery character. A slight lingering burn reminds me of what I just drank. A pretty decent beer. Paired well with fajitas."
"D - This would go great with chili... or IN chili. I found this beer to be quite refreshing, actually."
"The taste is spicy from start to finish, though it never overwhelmed me. I like the body of it, it's got a decent amount for what it is. I can't say it tastes ""beery"" as the the label suggests, but I don't need it to. I'm not rushing to the fridge for another, but I finished this one rather quickly. You probably want to be acclamated to spice before diving in nose and tongue first. Yum."
"The flavor starts out sweet with some pale malts and light hoppiness. The peppers taste crisp and initially fresh, as in the aroma, and remind me of biting into a cold pepper seed. The finish is where this beer shines, as the heat kicks in with a spicy warmth that reminds me of a good, fresh salsa. Mouthfeel is crisp and light in both body and carbonation, which allows the delicateness of the peppers to do their thang. All in all, a very well-done Chile beer from an otherwise unimpressive Twisted Pine BrewCo."
"D-no thanks I'll be lucky to finish the glass"
"This beer is anything but savory and I can't ever say that one sip has convinced me whether I wish to finish. But I don't think I'm going to take another sip. You accomplished your goal, but Id rather stick to beer that tastes like beer."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/6 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of strong chili, but not fresh chili, and yeast. Fits the style of a Chile Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong chili, slight yeast, and slight pale malt. The chili does not seem to be fresh, and is so strong as to throw off any hope of a good blend."
"This beer poured a golden color with a small white head that quickly dissipated into a small white film on top of the beer. The aroma was of jalapenos. The flavor was also of jalapenos with just a little bit of heat with it. I didnt think it was that hot, but I have a pretty high tolerance for hot and spicy food or drink. I liked it, but definitely not a beer for everybody. Probably would not drink more than 2 consecutive."
"This is like a typical but spicy lager, but the spicy flavors add enough to pull it above a typical beer and make it interesting. If you like spicy things, give this a go with out question. I am in no way a parishioner of spicy anything, but I find this to be a welcomed oddity to my usually fair. May not be heaven, may lean toward hell in essence, but its worth a try no matter where your faith lies."
"As expected, a chile taste. Green serrano pepper taste with some green vine. Some flower enters just as the end comes in with a good chile spice. On the hot side as it finishes, but tame."
"Let me preface this by saying I am a pretty big fan of chile beers, I have even brewed them a time or two myself. This one has got quite a bit of heat, not surprised if they did indeed use any amount of habanero and/or serrano. There is some mild, sweet grainy malts up front coupled with a nice earthy pepper flavor. The finish does have a little bitterness to it, but quickly followed up by some heat...and not just a bit. The heat really does not stay in the mouth, but rather migrates to the back of the throat and lingers there for quite some time. I like it, and feel it ranks above average for the style. Might be a tad too hot though, as just as much pepper flavor can be achieved without the fire."
"In almost every aspect - smell, taste, mouthfeel - this is merely an underhopped clone of bud light, but one that has been doused in fiery vegetable flavors that completely destroy any reminants of a drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: A well done beer is a well done beer and this is the new standard bearer for the style for me. I love the heat this one brings and I can feel the burn well after I have tasted my last sip. That being said this is a sipper. This has a more complex pepper taste to it than most pepper beers. I would have this one again."
"D=drinkable, but not something I would choose to have a bunch of in one sitting."
"If it were a little more consistent this could potentially be the best chili beer around. As it is, it's still a contender. Considering the other really good ones have been tap-only (like Sigda's from Coopersmith's), this is the best bottled version I've had."
"Overall, I found this to be a great example of a chili beer. If your only experience with chilis in beer is that Ed's Cave Creek abomination, give this one a shot. It'll make you forget that Ed's even exists, which is a good thing. Well balanced, well made. A remarkable, albeit somewhat gimmicky beer from Twisted Pine."
"Wow, they aren't kidding when they say Chilies. This is by far the spiciest chili beer I have had. The other reviewers have it covered - about the only thing I taste is hot peppers and cigarettes. Interesting for a couple sips, but now I need a new beer. Maybe this would be good to cook with though. Perhaps in some chili, or in the water pan of a meat smoker, or any other bbq scenario where adding beer is desired."
"Drinkability: Interesting concept that perhaps goes better with spicy food or, then again, perhaps not"
"The appearance was good with the head that came off and then reduced to thin lacing. The smell had some hops to it but then the chilies came to power. The taste was just pure chili. If you want nothing else to taste but chilies this would create a dream beer for you. But as I enjoy the combination of all the different aspects of a beer, this one lacked everything that in my mind makes a beer."
"Overall impression: I've had some decent chili beers in the paste, but this one isn't something I'll be getting again. It is lacking in flavor, and only has some chili aroma and burn going for it."
"Mouthfeel is hot...spicy, that is. Pretty gross. Sorry, I just don't have that much to add. It's peppers, it's hot, it's a spicy salsa beer. Hmmmm."
"Drank easy. This & Amicas chilles beer are the 2 best I've had. Would go great with Tex/Mex or BBQ"
"The flavor was, in a word, awful. I can't say I've had other chile beers, and this example will make me think twice before I do. After this beer, the fact that I have a bottle of Rogue Chipotle in the fridge is terrifying."
"If you like chile peppers, you owe it to yourself to try this beer."
