"If your not a pepper head, you can not appreciate this beer. The day after last st Patrick's day I went out and bought the last 2 bottles my local place in Eugene had. Now with a year of age I'm going to follow up the tradition and totally enjoy my second bottle. Cheers to you Greg. And thank you for my favorite pepper beer of all time!"
"Be prepared for this one. I think it's one of the great unique beers. It's something special, but it's not easy to drink."
""
"Not drinkable.  Too spicy to take a second sip of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Look it's still a terrible beer.  Maybe a mixer for something but crazy expensive.  There is no way bourbon barrels were needed for this but hey.  It's a million times better than crime."

"Quite hot but not overbearing.  I quickly grew accustomed the heat but that made the flavor of the base beer more apparent which wasn't necessarily a good thing.  This level of heat in a sour ale, like Upright's Fatali Four, would be great."
""
"This beer is like drinking liquid Capsaicin - really there is not much else to say.  There is so much spice heat in this beer that there really isn't much else that you notice.  Awful, awful, terrible beer and I'm severely disappointed I bought it.  Should have checked Beer Advocate's rating before plopping down $35 on this guy!"
"This is actually not as bad as many score it.  It is work to get through, but it has a place.  I think that matching it with either spicy or to contrast non-spicy food may actually be okay to give a try."

"(O)- Simply nuclear. While I simply adore hot and spicy food, I think I draw the line when it comes to having it in my beer. It tasted fine starting out, but quickly changes to just start tasting like burning."

"Overall: I am telling you with the utmost confidence, this beer is a waste of money. It's punishment enough how much they charge for a bottle. I split this amongst friends and everyone agreed it just too spicy to even be called a beer. Best use for the beer is to use it for marinade. Which I ended up doing anyway. No beer wasted in this family."
""
""
""
"EDIT: I had no heartburn while drinking these, nor any stomach problems the next day. It didn't even burn coming out. Win."

"One of the worst ever. I couldn't finish it. The name punishment says it all. Do people really like this? I like hot peppers and a little Beer kick is cool but this is just silly. I hate pouring out beer but I couldn't take another burning punishing sip of pain and tongue torture. I couldn't even describe the mouthfeel or taste or other senses. The did a good job if the wanted to ruin the beer with this one. Not sure what the goal was or if this is a joke. I see it around and it's expensive so people must like it but it nots for me"

"Confession: I'm not big on hot peppers,but in recent years I've gotten a bit more into spicier foods. I'm a bit intimidated by this one. Deep brown hued with a bit of light haziness. A quarter inch of khaki colored head rests on top. Odd aroma from the chilies and peppers almost gives it a cinnamon sweet aroma. Not inviting. Whoa! That first taste tells me all I need to know. I'm way out of my league. All I get is a burning sensation and a scorched palate. My tongue and especially my lips are burned. I think my chances of finishing this are zero. I can't recall the last time that happened. I honestly poured the rest out without another sip. FAIL!"

"I'm not one to drain pour a full bottle, especially one this expensive, but wow, short of using it to marinate some steaks, I can't see any other way I'm going to get through this bottle."
""

"ok, it's a spicy beer, i get that . . . but it's just too hot to enjoy. i love hot food, but this is, sadly, about 10-15% too hot to enjoy. too bad, because it looks wonderful. someone else said ""I can't understand how someone who would spend the money to buy this would rank it low!"". wth? so, the logic here is if it costs a lot (and $20 for a bomber is a lot to me), i have to rank it well? ummm . . . no, i don't. i'm glad i tried it, but i won't be back."
""
""
""
"Overall - by far the most expensive drainpour ever. Actually, no, I'm still too damn cheap for that. I poured what I could back in the bottle, maybe an ounce less than full. It is headed for a brutal entry into the next beer tasting. I love Stone but this is one of the 5 worst beers I've ever had. Yikes, I'm feeling a little nauseous after that."
""
"O - Punishment takes Crime and ups the ante slightly. To be quite frank, from their description, after enjoying Crime I was pretty nervous for the heat level of Punishment but, it's damn similar. Both beers convey a hear-burn inducing heat level that tugs at facial sweat glands while maintain a good flavor profile of chilies. While chilies are the focus, this beer keeps a clear ""beer"" base but it's futile time in bourbon barrels is identical to that of Crime; non-existent in aroma or flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Punishment didn't seem to bother me as much as crime. It is still too sweet and vegetal for my liking."
""
"Overall... it is a winters night. This beer made sense... Maybe I was biased by the abrasively cold, below zero weather and high winds. But this is a devastatingly good chile beer. I won't be hurt to see this beer sit on the shelves awhile so that I can indulge again in it. If you are a true lover of big beers and really hot peppers, this is the ticket."
""
""
"Overall: Try it if your like me and are always looking for something new and different, and like rich complex beer with good food, I ate this with some chicken wings and fresh veggies. also share this with 3 or more people, I shared mine with 4 other people and still didn't finish the bottle, very spicy, filling, rich and delish but only able to have 2 to 4 oz. I look forward to trying the crime."

"Stone Punishment ---3/5."
""
""
"Update: I couldn't drink this. I enjoy spicy foods that literally make my eyes water and my nose run. But this crossed some kind of line. A line that I didn't even know I had. But I did save it, and I added it to some rice and beans. The result was stellar. I thought about upgrading my score, but this is a beer, not a hot sauce..."
"Spicier and a bit more complex than Crime and that works in it's favor. Spicy and pushes the limits but never crosses. If you have to pick, choose this one."
""
"Wow! This is one inventive and impressive brew. Much like Crime, this one has completely transformed my view of what beer can be. Very intense yet pleasing in a way. This beer has immediately induced a cholinergic response manifested as a watering mouth and runny nose. I also feel that Punishment has induced an endorphin release not to mention the pleasing effects of the disguised alcohol. Put it all together: the flavor, the intensity, the feeling, and you have one incredible and addictive beer drinking experience. This dose of Punishment was an absolute pleasure!"
"O: I put 3 tablespoons in my chili. I save what was left in the bottle for a friend to try and his response was the same as mine. All the rest went down the drain. Which is really sad because I love Stone's brews. But this was undrinkable. Not sure what I will do with Crime."
""
""
"overall: not a great beer and a novelty to be sure, but Punishment pulls this off better than Crime imo."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth, light. I like this beer, but I have to sip it slowly."
""
"A excellent beer with a great showcase of peppers. Aroma fresh chili peppers hard to single out any in particular. Taste upfront is wave of chili; garden green jalapeno, and smoke leading to caramel / butterscotch middle and fiery finish. Very intriguing at first; somewhat one-sided and painful as the capsaicin burns its path initially. Through out sipping malt sweetness and caramel becomes more prevalent and burning dulls to where becomes more complex and bourbon shines thru. Personally set out to only have a glass; then wife waived the white flag after first sip and was stuck finishing the bottle which towards the end felt like punishment with senses saying ""NO more PEPPERS!"". A great experience but bring friends to help endure the ride to really appreciate this beer and ""Stone"" approach of a chili brew!"
""
"Bottom Line: Would I buy it again? Yeah, definitely. I also love Chile Beers, brew them, and find them immensely interesting. For the price point though, it's still a bit hard to justify, and I would definitely recommend sampling this before buying if you have any fears of the press about it."
""

"I can't say this beer was bad, its AMAZING if what your going for was a mega-heat-pepper-experiamental-nuclear-hot beer."

"O: Long story short: between two people who LOVE spicy food, we had to drainpour this. I don't drainpour often. And I sure as shit don't drainpour $20 bottles, either. Stone is such a frustrating brewery - their main line is rock-solid, and some of their beers are fantastic (their 15th Anny and RuinTen are among my favorite beers ever), but then you get mediocrity like the 16th Anny...and even worse, unmitigated crap like this. I don't even feel like making a cute pun about this being Punishment to drink, this just plain sucks."

"I WOULD suggest this to a pepper fiend but I would let them know that (my opinion) this did NOT have any beer aspects aside from alcohol."
""
""
"Habanero 100% to the max, like fumy fruity greatness extracted from chiles. The base beer is gone but this re-invents chili beer and 12% ABV is a joke in this case. If you have ever sliced habaneros, try this beer. Took off some overall points because this could have been a GEM if there was any Bourbon Double Bastard left to be found. IF YOU LIKE HABANEROS TRY THESE BEERS!"
""
""
""
"Overall: I could have handled jalapenos, but when you get into nagas, Caribbean red hots, Moruga scorpions and fatilis, I am overwhelmed; I don't know anything about any of them but they are in the habanero category to me, if not hotter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Whew. Seriously, seriously hot beer. I doubt more than 5% of the population could even make it through this bottle. This is one step away from drinking from a bottle of hot sauce. I gave it a good score because it does what it came to do. Hell, it's CALLED Punishment. They were not kidding. I didn't score the taste that great because it can hardly be regarded as a beer. It's just alcoholic hot sauce. But who cares."
""
""
"Listen Guy, this is the worst beer I have ever had besides Crime. Do not waste your money, sobriety or time. The smell made me want to throw up. My 3 friends and I could not drink more than a sip each. We poured ours out and drank a Founders Backwoods Bastard to bring our palates back."

"If you want a firebomb beer-drinking experience, or you like extreme beers with high abv, give it a try. If your budget doesn't allow for a very pricey purchase, you needn't worry to pass it over.."
"O: about the only positive aspect would be to use this in chili or some other dish that can utilize both the beer and spice."
"There's really no reason for a beer to be this hot..., this abrasive..., this defiant. Yet it does. As I have never had a beer that rivals the heat that was expressed here, it has support, balance and resonance. As abrasive as it may seem, this beer simply works!"
""

""

"Okay, as a chili pepper beer, this is the best of the best! It already starts with a great Stone base, and the bottle design just entices/intimidates you before you drink it. Then, once you uncork it, this overwhelming, amazing chili pepper smell comes creeping out of the bottle letting you know what you're getting yourself into. Your pour it out, and you can see little chili pepper residue in the brew, and the smell really intensifies. The moment you drink it, those peppers just kick your ass, but in a really delicious way! I recommend the sip, not the gulp! Overall, I can't understand how someone who would spend the money to buy this would rank it low! You're upset a spicy beer is spicy?! Deal with it! It's delicious and definitely worth a try (if you share with friends!)"
""

"Overall - Good god. I don't hate this but I must say, why ruin barrel aged double bastard with all these peppers? And also, this was ridiculously priced at 24$!!! I love, stone, didn't think twice about buying this but, I feel really ripped off, this isn't even a 22oz bottle! there's no balance, just the crushing pepper kick. Its worth a sip, make sure you share this bottle with friends cause there's no way you can finish the whole bottle."

"500 ml bottle poured into small snifter. No head. Very little clear lacing. Cloudy copper body. Aroma includes notes of cucumber, fresh peppers, cayenne, sriracha. Taste is all heat, tongue tingling, lip numbing. Hard to pick up other flavors beyond the heat but I feel like my taste buds are stimulated and now I will probably enjoy my dinner even more. Pairs well with chicken wings. Unique experience. Share with friends because I don't think you should drink more than a few ounces. This beer delivers on its promises and after all, isn't that all you can ask for in a beer or any other consumer good?"
"Smells hot, brewed with habeneros and ghost chilies. Tastes sweet, hoppy, and has a definite chili flavor Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied, with a very spicy kick in the back of the throat Looks dark, golden brown. Happy to tried both Crime and Punishment but happier that I won't be trying them again."
"O- I really wanted to like this beer. I love double bastard, bourbon and spicy beers. But this is overkill. I wanted to enjoy the beer's flavors but my mouth was too burnt up to enjoy any of this 20$ drain pour."
"O: A rather enjoyable, if somewhat masochistic, brew from Stone. You will NOT want to finish a bottle on your own. I had about 4 ounces and was done. I could feel the capsaicin burn from my mouth all the way down into my stomach, and every burp tasted like jalapeño pizza afterwards. I'd honestly recommend anyone try this beer, just don't focus too much on the heat and it's pretty damn good."
"Unless you are really into punishment, take a pass on on this one."
""
"Overall: Its not undrinkable but this is about a 3 or 4 ounce maximum per serving. The double bastard accents get lost which holds this brew back for me, comes off as a barrel aged pepper brew. Burns the palate and through, but is no doubt a unique brew."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. This is about the most fitting name possible for a beer...ever. It is pungent and spicy to the point where its nearly imposdible to enjoy. An absolute endorphin rush. I am afraid of how bad this is going to feel tomorrow. Sidebar item: ive had this on tap 2 or so yeard ago so I knew just how bad this was going to be. Dont try to drink a whole bottle by yourself, its a dumb idea. This beer is highly recommended as a gag gift and nothing more. What a waste of barrel aged double bastard."
"This was the most difficult beer drinking experience of my life. The first sip was ok for a second and then the intense pepper flavor destroys your taste buds. Why would you barrel age and pepper load a good beer in its own right? I paid $21 for this bottle and my best friend in the world paid $21 for the second worst beer of my life Crime. We drank them in one sitting together and they were almost impossible to finish. If I wasn't a border line alcoholic I would have poured them down the drain. I sucked it up and drank both my portion and my friend John/Jay's. Thanks a lot Stone Brewing. This one will haunt me."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, pepper jack cheese, and chile pepper aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, chile pepper, and chile pepper juice flavors on the finish. There is a high amount of chile heat that lingers in the throat long after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is interesting with what exactly is in it, but pretty much a novelty in my opinion."

"ultra high marks for the peppers, if it weren't muddled with all the other stuff that makes Bastard beer what it is... what this turned into was an ULTRA-EXPENSIVE NOVELTY...."

"If given the choice, I'd drink Crime before drinking Punishment."
"This really is punishment if not different from the mold. It's both a fun and horrifying experience. This could be great used in cooking, but really pushing it when it comes towards human consumption."
"Drinkability: If you're coming in expecting brandy barrel-aged Double Bastard with a hint of serrano, you'll be disappointed. I had no idea the serranos would play such a huge role, but as a hot sauce junkie I couldn't help but love this one. Greg, if you're having trouble selling this stuff, shoot me a BM! This is the best chile beer I've ever had!"
"D: This was pretty tough to drink. I would say even if you're a big chile beer fan this would be painful."
"Overall: I appreciate two new Stone beers, but the name of this one is fitting."
