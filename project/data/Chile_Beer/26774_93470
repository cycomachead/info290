3.7,2.8,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.75,"Final Grade: 3.7, a respectable B grade. This can of Red Rocket Coffee Spiced Stout may be a little past its prime, but I am still liking what I am tasting. The base stout is not particularly interesting in-and-of itself, but the combination of cinnamon and cayenne results in a beautifully spicy blend. This one is actually hot enough that I could see it being a turn-off to some consumers - but if you are at all a fan of chile beer, this neat little niche brew is well worth the risk. Thumbs up; I'll keep an eye out for this one in the future.","thehyperduck","Feb 15, 2015"

3.81,5.8,3.5,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Very interesting. I enjoyed it and the cayenne worked but I would like it toned down a bit with more coffee stout taste. This beer needs to be renamed with "cayenne" to be fair to consumers.","ssmack","Jan 26, 2015"

4.17,15.8,3.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Overall - this beer has chased off some of the "mouthful of pine-cones" blues I've been getting with a lot of local beers. From "lightly" hopped lagers to the double IPAs, it seems that "balance" isn't in the ontario brewer's vocabulary at the moment. It's great to load hops into IPAs and DIPAs, but IMO a sessionable beer needs a bit less sometimes, just enough to kiss the back end of the beer, and there needs to be more than just the resiny and citrusy hops being represented in local beers it seems, but I digress. This beer is darn good, and promises a unique combination (at least as has been available to me) that has certainly left me satisfied. At 5.3 abv, I'd say it's pretty sessionable. The only things I think that need improvement are the presence of cinnamon and vanilla in the finished product - it doesn't need it, but if it's advertised, it should be there, and also that the head could last a bit longer. Otherwise, and all things considered, a great pint.","pieman25","Jan 10, 2015"

4.1,13.9,4,4,4.25,4,4,"This is a strange brew. Dark with a dark tan head. The scent of coffee but dark chocolate is also there in the background.  But the taste... the chile pepper come in surprisingly strong. Not a chile pepper beer fan but it is such a strange blend that it works.","JMBSH","Jan 03, 2015"

And I recall earlier draught samples of Red Rocket being far more explosive. Still, I've bought numerous cans of it since being made available in retail and, though nowhere as impressed, have enjoyed each and every one. I'll bet you'll do the same - provided you can take the heat!","biegaman","Dec 11, 2014"

3.22,-10.6,3.25,3,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall  - Even as someone who loves spicy foods and spicy beers (and I mean ghost pepper hot), this just doesn’t quite work for me, a coffee stout laced with spice and brewed with cayenne peppers the connection between the two just doesn’t quite work for me. So while it’s something I’m glad I tried, I probably won’t be repeating this purchase.","DenisKolkin","Nov 26, 2014"

4.2,16.7,,,,,,"On tap at Brothers Beer Bistro. Near black with a light mocha head. Aromas of roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee. Creamy mouthfeel. Tastes echo the aromas but with the addition of a spicey cayenne pepper finish that puts a beautiful pleasant tingle in the back of the throat on the swallow. I would buy bottles of this if it hit the LCBO.","BeerWatcher","Nov 08, 2014"

2.93,-18.6,3.5,3.5,2.75,2.25,2.75,"Tap: Poured a black color stout with a small brown foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with cinnamon is quite pleasant. Taste is at first a mix of cinnamon and roasted malt with light bitterness but then the cayenne notes kicks in way too strongly which makes the aftertaste really hot. Body is average with good carbonation. The cayenne adds an interesting edge tot his beer but is just too dominant at the end of the day.","Phyl21ca","Jul 27, 2013"
