2.75,-22.1,,,,,,"Not much heat or flavor from the jalapenos and the base pilsener is mediocre too.  Taste is too sweet for a pilsner and a bit doughy, with a little heat and flavor from the jalapenos in the finish.  Head retention is good, but the carbonation is too low for the style.  I really wanted to like this, but like most times I found myself underwhelmed and disapointed by a chili beer.","Gagnonsux","Aug 18, 2014"
