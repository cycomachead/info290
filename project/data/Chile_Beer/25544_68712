4.23,21.9,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The cool, damp night was a welcome relief. The scorching sun had roasted everything within reach. The buzzards that flew overhead all afternoon had nested with their bellies empty. If it was a tavern, it was long abandoned. The barkeep had a dressing wrapped around his head at least three times, covering one eye and creating enough padding to keep his Stetson firmly in place. With his one eye and one nod, he welcomed the company. Two towns west he used to be a farmhand; one town west he was a road merchant; here, he sat in the dark. It was warmer inside but dryer than the night air because the doors and window shutters were always closed. When asked if it was to keep others out or keep him in, he grew angry and thundered incomprehensibly. Rather than face isolation, he deliberately calmed and feigned interest sparged with dry humor. Every wrinkle on his filthy visage was an evaporating river threatening to finally reveal the countless skeletons of every drowning. He was perhaps gregarious as an expectation, but never a preference. It’s as if we place ourselves amidst anguish and tease a fury ready to manifest as an assault on what is expected of us rather than what we want. Facing the shelves of empty bottles, he rubbed the back of his neck hoping to wipe away perspiration but only shook off flaking skin he had been shedding for years. Proprietors and squatters know the tales but money only tells one story. The buzzards tell the rest.","JuniperJesus","May 18, 2014"

3.83,10.4,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,4,"this is brutally underrated on here. a very fine chili beer, one of the more drinkable ones out there, and with a remarkable depth and complexity in front of the pepper, not behind it. its got a dark amber color, closer to brown but still glowing red, and about an inch of tan head that becomes a thin film in a few warm minutes. the nose on this is way out, honey sweetness from the red malt, fire roasted long chilies, and semisweet chocolate, as well as a slight overdose of ale yeast which is abundant on the front of the tongue at the first sip. hard to tell if its chili hotness or burn from the alcohol, the pepper gives that kind of taste and mouthfeel, and ends up both in the back of the throat and on the tip of my tongue. I love the depth here, vanilla and spice, maybe cinnamon, like something from the age of exploration, this goes seemingly beyond the ales of mexico to a much more global, albeit it primitive, time period. it takes me there, and I like that. quite a bit of body, but plenty drinkable. chili feel and taste, but not too much heat, well refined and far better than its scores indicate. my brother was right about this one, and I now am in search of other beers from 5 rabbit. this is a clever and well executed concoction.","StonedTrippin","Jul 05, 2013"

There needs to be more to support what should be happening. There's a crisp nip and no liveliness otherwise. It should be smooth but isn't, and is a little slick if anything.","Brenden","Apr 24, 2012"

1.91,-45,4,3,1,1.5,2,"Deep ruby caramel colored ale with a big khaki tan head, fine even layered lacing, I'm scared because of the diacetyle notes already detected. Again as I popped the cap the beer comes gushing out so you better pour quickly. Aroma has dark fruit and band aid notes with hints of dark chocolate roasted malt qualities. Flavor is a cluster fuck of diacetyl, dark caramel roasted malts and supposed chili additions. Either way it's a cluster fuck of a beer that I do not enjoy and will not find a place for in my DBF. Flavor hits me so hard with diacetyl off flavors that I want to retire from beer. The actual flavor is a muddled mess of bitter chemical astringency band aids and alcohol even though it's only 6.4% abv. Look I don't have all the answers but I know beer and this is not a good variation of something I love. Mouthfeel is unbearable pretty much the most horrific beer I've come across in recent times, band aid/chemical bitterness simply kills the beer and I'm not getting any heat from a supposed chili beer. Overall staty the fuck away from this brewer.","WVbeergeek","Beers"

3.3,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Been waiting a long time to try this. Hope it was worth it. It pours a clear sunset garnet-topaz-amber topped by maybe a half-finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, chile flesh, dank dark greens, and a half-pinch of cinnamon. The taste brings in much of the same, though the caramel comes off much more dull, and the chiles are greener and express a decent (though still pretty small) amount of of heat. Things don't mesh entirely well, unfortunately. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly syrupy feel. Overall, not my choice when it comes to chile beers, but it's not all bad and does go down easily enough.","TMoney2591","Dec 01, 2011"

4.09,17.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O- This is a nice blend of chiles and softer malt support and some nice English yeast esters start to show up as the beer warms. Underneath the chiles is a great easy drinking brown ale that has lots of nice depth and character.","rhoadsrage","Beers"

3.3,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"D - I think I gave up on the last few ounces as the heat became unpleasant and the beer didn't taste good enough to warrant consuming more under those conditions. There's too much heat and not enough chili flavor - you could probably trick someone with this beer actually. Definitely interesting, but not something I'll be rushing to try again any time soon.","MasterSki","Jun 18, 2011"

4.05,16.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Caramel malt, some toastiness, fruity yeast and peppery spice. Ancho gives it a nice lingering spicy sweet heat in the aftertaste, subtle and nuanced. Successfully balanced without numbing heat, which can be rare in a Chile Beer. Definitely a little bit smoky, pretty malt forward. Medium carbonation, easy to drink. Paired well with food. An interesting first effort from this fledgling brewing company. Expectations are high since Mr. Mosher is involved, and this is a unique beer... a dark ale with ancho chiles added.","emerge077","May 27, 2011"
