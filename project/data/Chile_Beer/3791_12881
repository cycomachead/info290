3.75,1.4,,,,,,"Came back several times for this one! Got a growler and 2 bottles to go, as well. It's addictive and refreshing. Not too spicy, it's more infused with bright chile flavor than anything with a nice malty hoppy base.","yarnbomb","Apr 20, 2014"

4.24,14.6,5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Probably one of the finest chili beers I've ever had. I don't know how Eske's get's the lingering head (nearly every chili beer I've encountered has virtually no head after the initial pour), but this beer would be notable if only for this characteristic. But the overall chili beer character is there -- bold and proud. A very, very delicious example of the style with the added bonus of an exceptional appearance. Actually better than the tap version I had the other month...","beergoot","Mar 08, 2012"
4.24,14.6,4,5,4,3,4.5,"Giving this a high overall score because I found it very satisfying. Likely a pilsner, but as previously noted, perhaps a touch of wheat. Chilis OBVIOUS on the nose-this was very strong. Chili flavor was surprisingly restrained. I didn't drink more than a sampler size, but was really glad I tried it. Perhaps the best chili beer I have had.","oxguru","Nov 14, 2011"

3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"It's pretty good, worth it even if you don't love chili and pretty drinkable. Would go well with milder Tex-Mex food (cheese, beans, etc.).","zaphodchak","Aug 10, 2009"
3.62,-2.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"You have to order a glass of this at this brewpub as it is their signature beer. Now, this style is one that has been ruined by Eds Crazy Creek and chances are most people have only had the Rogue Chipotle as a good example. This is a pretty good chile beer using a lightish pale ale base with New Mexico Green Chiles. The beer is not too hot but once you get a quarter way down the glass you feel a slight burn. Drink with a mexican style entree from their kitchen and the beer works well and seems less hot. Couldn't really drink more than a glass of this beer but I did enjoy that glass","canucklehead","Sep 10, 2008"
3.69,-0.3,3,4,4,2.5,3.5,"All in all, I'd say this is mostly a novelty -- I wouldn't go far afield to sample this brew, but I would gladly quaff another if offered the chance, especially if I was about to enjoy some hearty fare. Mexican food may seem an obvious choice, but I'd prefer something a bit less zesty to compliment the assertiveness of this ale.","kylesobrien","Jul 21, 2008"
3.94,6.5,3,4,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at Eske's. It was a nice golden color with not much head. It had a peppery and hops aroma with a little bit of malts. The flavor was really good. Just enough pepper to know it was there but mainly a pale ale flavor. A lot better than I was expecting. It had a light body with a nice crispness to it. Pretty drinkable and one that I could order if I go back.","mhewes","Jun 30, 2005"
3.87,4.6,3,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D-One of the best all around chili beers I have had and unique in that it is in the form of a "light" beer. This one is actually drinkable in multiple pints. Most chili beers I have had use a darker malt base...like Rogue Chipotle. Very nicely done and went VERY well with our Nuevo Mexican food. If you have had Ed's Cave Creek Chili and now shy away from chili beers break your boycott and give this one a try.","Deuane","Sep 23, 2003"
3.9,5.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Not a great fan of anything hot but was looking forward to trying this unusual beer style, well in the UK anyway. A challenging golden coloured pale ale with a strong taste of green peppers. Great if you like this type of beer. Suggest you drink it midway through a session and wash it down with the Seco Stout. ABV 4.5","SidSales","Beers"
3.69,-0.3,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"And yes, I realize this style just isn't for everyone. But if you got burned by a wretched Cave Creek, give this one a try!","DrunkMcDermott","0"
