"Lager with a jalepeno burn."
"Nice change of pace. Subtle jalapeño after taste makes for a spicy reprieve from your usual beer."
"Medium body, quite spicy mouth feel but not over powering. Pretty amber, with notes of honey and citrus. Refreshing."
"Looks good, but no real smell. Flavor is mostly spice, but it delivers what it promises."
"A little too smokey flavored, not much jalapeño flavor."

"I think they did a fine job on this one.  Next time I'll try another variety from Twisted X"

"Not much heat or flavor from the jalapenos and the base pilsener is mediocre too.  Taste is too sweet for a pilsner and a bit doughy, with a little heat and flavor from the jalapenos in the finish.  Head retention is good, but the carbonation is too low for the style.  I really wanted to like this, but like most times I found myself underwhelmed and disapointed by a chili beer."

"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D Surprisingly good, like a somewhat sweet estery hoppy blond ale, and the jalapeño adds burn in the finish is good, but gets a bit too intense and distracting by the end of a pint, but I'd definitely have one in a night's line up at a pub."
