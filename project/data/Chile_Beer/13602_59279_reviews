"Pours a hazy orange-amber in color with about a 1-finger white foamy head. A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped, in rings actually, that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of course peppers and grains. Pretty much the taste follows the nose with a bite of the peppers (Serrano & Jalapeno) with the ale afterwards. Goes down and warms the tummy for sure, but drinkable. The pepper taste doesn't last or burn your mouth but does hang around in your stomach for a bit. Lighter to medium bodied with perfect carbonation for this style of brew. I had some other chili brews before and this one was OK but nothing really special. I wouldn't go buy a 6-pack of it but maybe a single one every now and then."

"Altogether, better than I expected. Not really great, but could go well some decent Mexican snacks."

"Overall- A better selection of peppers would have contributed to a much better balance of heat to flavor. Was disappointed in this beer. Being a big fan of the Chili Style this could have been better."
"Would not drink again."

"Overall, I can't say I'm a chile beer aficionado, but this one seems to style. I can't help but feel like this beer is rated unfairly low and that people are docking it because of a distaste for the style. Chile beer is certainly an odd style, but this one seems to have all the characteristics that I would expect--the only area in which I feel some improvement could be made is in the appearance, but I imagine it's hard to get a nice rocky head when dealing with the oils from the chile peppers."

"O - This is a pretty nice chile beer. One of the better brews that Weston makes."

"O- This is my first Chile beer, so I have nothing to base it on, but I do think they did a fine job with this one."

"Overall:	I would say that I liked this one better than their other pepper beer. It was alright and went well with nachos. I have founded it with two different labels so that can be confusing."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong chile, slight pale malt, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Chile Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is a noticeable heat from the pepper. Tastes of strong hot pepper (not distinctly fresh), hint of hop, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, the pepper dominates the aroma, body, and feel."
"This beer reminded me a lot of the infamous Cave Creek Chili Beer, which is not a good thing."
"Not the most drinkable beer because as with hot peppers, too much of a good thing is not a good idea. The heat does start to build up in your gut as you finish the first bottle. But I really, really enjoyed this one despite its underwhelming appearance."
"Drinks okay, not a beer to seek out for a first time pepper beer experience IMO..."
"Drink this with cheese and crackers as an alternative to paring with an IPA. For pepper people or just the adventurous."
"O- This beer has a strong pepper flavor and would go well with a mexican dish, if you like spice that is. Very good and pretty much what I was expecting!"
"That being said it goes down like water for me. A spicy pleasure to drink although a bit thin. I could put down a couple of bombers without thinking twice."
"Pours a golden straw color with a small creamy head. Lots of carbonation in this one. Nose is all pepper. It's Seerrano, one of my favorite peppers. There's beer in here? If so, you can't discern it from the smell. If you don't like peppers, then I'm not sure why you're drinking this. If you do, then you know what you're in for. Light mouthfeel, if it wasn't for the pepper heat it would be quite refreshing. Taste is somewhat vegetable, there's little hops and some malt but this one is clearly balanced towards the pepper side of the equation. The beer is a huckster, it draws you in with a light fruity hop note and some candy corn sweetness before that's quickly aborted with a blast of Serrano chilis that finishes the whole thing. Interesting as a diversion. Would make a unique counterpoint to something rich and creamy - maybe a clam chowder or something, but it's not necessarily something that you would reach for after a long day."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a crystal clear copper with just a inkling of a head. Like all true pepper beers, no head sticks around and no lacing occurs. The nose is fresh cut Jalapenos. Green jalapenos straight off the plant, diced up and vaporized and there you go. That's the nose. Very little malty sweetness to muddle it all up. The taste is exactly the same, fresh cut pepper. I've never gotten so much heat out of a beer. This beer is hot, but not boozy. Fantastic. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, perfect for the style. Weston, I don't know what your doing, but your doing something right. I was shocked by #1, and you followed it up with a fantastic beer, albeit a beer that 50% of people won't like. I do have to say, I'm drinking it while eating a spicy pepperoni and sharp cheddar pizza and it works spiffily."
"Overall, HOT! Halfway through the bottle and I've already broke a sweat. Probably will not buy this again, unless I plan on making a bet with a friend."
"Okay, I must admit--I'll probably get another bottle so my girlfriend can try it. I don't think she could handle it."
"The mouthfeel is thin and a little oily. It was a chore to drink this beer, and I just couldn't finish the last 4 ounces. It had to go down the drain. This is one lab experiment that was a failure."
"This is amber beer is spicy from start to finish. The aroma kicks in with spicy jalapeno right away. The taste has an immediate kick of spicy roasted peppers that linger well into the aftertaste. In case I've been unclear: This one is SPICY! Nearing harshness, but fun regardless. Should pair well with milder foods that need that extra zing."
