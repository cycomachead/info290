"I generally don't give a good note to such beer, but in that case, if you understand what this beer is all about, you'll probably change your mind. Many people see this beer as a serious beer which is supposed to taste like beer. It's quite the opposite. It's pretty much the beer you challenge someone to drink because it's so spicy. Imagine what it would be like to drink a bottle of tabasco, but as a beer. Now, try this beer again. It's really perfect in this context. Otherwise, don't drink it."

"Also, once again I ate the pepper. Why do I do this to myself!? This pepper actually still had some heat left to it. A lot was gone and replaced with a huge earthy note. Do not eat the pepper. Trust me."

"Final thoughts - Avoid this beer! All the reviews say it and it's true. I don't even know why they still sell this one but one thing's for sure, I'm never buying this one again."
"Man. This is terrible. Kudos for doing it. But they could've made it drinkable."
"Overall: Have a good dose of courage to finish this beer. if you're a kind of drinker that likes to experiment, then go for it, otherwise, avoid."
"Bottle from HogtownHarry! Thanks Harry! This one is a deep gold beer, with a fizzy tiny bubbled head with decent length. Smells of a jelapeo peppers, cayenne even, with some malts. SHIT, this is spicy! Harry, what are you trying to do to me? Undrinlably spicy and prppery flavours mixed in with corn water. FInishes poorly, spicing up my mouth. I sipped this for an hour, and still had 3/4 of a bottle left, then two other people tried it, and there was still half a bottle left.Argh."
"D - Well... It is what it is. IF you happen to like mixing pepper and bland beer this is your ticket. I couldn't drink a lot of this, nor would I want to. The morning after would be hell..."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure I will get through one."
"D: no interest, we were 5 on the same bottle and we didn't finished it"
"D - None. I had to throw it out after a few sips. I was getting indigestion."
"Poured out an orangey gold color, with no head whatsoever, looks like decent carbonation though. The nose was like pure pepper juice or pepper oil. Every time I go in for a whiff, I scream like a little girl. I split a bottle with a friend, we're having a hard time getting past the nose. neither of us wants to dirnk it. It's become a double dog dare. Damn, ok, here I go. The first words out of my mouth were: wow, this is some horrendous horseshit. I can't ever fully describe this beer. I had half a sip and almost induced vommiting. this is punishment beer. Make people pay for their mistakes by drinking this. Someone sleeps with your sister, make them drink this."
"Bottle: Poured an orangey/yellowish ale with absolutely no carbonation. Aroma of hot jalapeno is completely dominant. Taste is way too hot for my taste bud with what can only be describe as liquid hot jalapenos. Complete drain pour and again I see no point in drinking this again."
"I had a very hard time finishing this beer. It really doesn't have a whole lot going for it. I even tasted the brownish chile pepper floating in it and it was slimy and nauseating. Definitely a novelty beer. Not recommended. Actually, I don't think it could be much worse."
