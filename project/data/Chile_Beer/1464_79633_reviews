"You can feel it going down your intestines."
"Gimic beer... only worth a sip, if that"

"I don't even know how to rate this. Reminds me of home infused habanero vodka.  Which I think is what they were going for."

"If i could give less than 1 star, I would. Excessively hot. I like spicy things. But, I could barely get down a sip before a wave of heat completely coated my mouth. I understand trying this for a novelty, but other than that, avoid this at all costs. Your intestines will never forgive you otherwise."

"O) Fuck that."
"O - Smells and tastes pretty decent, but damn it is hot!"

"So for the review - poured a weak amber color with no head. Aroma is worthless, just some juice and pepper heat. No flavor, just an okay spicy, thin lager. Go get some Ghost Face Killah if you want a serously flaming brew...that one sticks to the tongue like a cattle brand...."

"Very intense beer and I look forward to the other bottle. If you are a true chile fanatic, this beer is an absolute must-try. It delivers precisely what it is I'm looking for. It's not even remotely as over-the-top as some have said... it's exactly what it claims to be."

"O - What the hell was I thinking? I tried this at a bar last year. I thought I could drink a bottle. If I do it will take all day. It may just end up in the chili I am making. This is a bottle to share and punish your friends. It is not as hot as last year's version. It was made with pepper purée. This batch was just steeped with peppers, so I was told. I like spicy food, but I think I am done with this beer."

"D - Drinks like a hot sauce. Great for parties, although we ended up with 8oz left out of a 12oz bottle. Curious if this was hotter when it was fresh. I also discovered this was equally as hot coming out as it was going in."
"IT SHOULD. This beer is shared one ounce at a time. and even then it will be hard to finish."

"Overall - This was a great novelty and a terrible beer. It could not be finished and if it were solely up to me I would have poured 11 of the 12 ounces. I can't recommend this to anyone seriously, but if you know someone who can't get enough heat this may be right up their alley. This was the hottest thing I have ever consumed - food or drink."

"O - Overall this was a a very unique and challenging beer. I really enjoyed it. As a huge chili head yah...this was awesome. I know its not for everyone but yah, me personally I enjoyed the experience."
"Ghost Scorpion is brewed with supposedly the two hottest chiles in the world (Ghost and Scorpion). From where I’m sitting, I’ll buy that. It makes for awful beer, but it’s damn hot! I guess if that’s your thing, knock yourself out. I’d suggest steering clear of this one though. Seriously….heed those words!"
"Seriously though. My stomach is literally boiling and curdling itself. It is very unhappy with me. The heat on the mouth and throat was good, mostly tolerable, but once in the stomach my body seems to be rejecting my stomach. It's not like I want to throw up, more like my body wants to shovel my entire stomach out of itself. Am I going to die!!!"
"O- I'd like to see someone try to drink a whole bottle of this. Way too painful to drink."
"O- I had a great time drinking this beer. One of my buddies gargled with it, so then the rest of had to follow suit so we wouldn't look like bitches. It's hot, way hot. If you're looking for the hottest beer in the world this is probably it. It's definitely an interesting experience and, for what it is, it's great. High marks for this one, because seriously, if you're drinking this, you know what you're getting into, don't act all surprised when it burns the hell out of you."

"Really this beer should be a 0-1 since it has no beer quality sans a few bubbles and its golden amber color."
"Give Ghost Scorpion a try if you're brave enough. I guarantee that it will be memorable."
"I bought 2 bottles and opened one to drink. This is not a beer, this is an event. The hottest thing in the world. I agree with the numbing effect on the lips. Two sips in, I had to do a shot of milk to get to the third sip. Poured the rest down the drain and two days later made chili with the second bottle. 2 quarts of chili with one bottle of this beer and my coworkers thought I was Texas Red. This beer is a pretty good idea, but a better ingredient. Maybe even better as a party toughman contest...need another bottle."

"Edit: I was unable to finish this beer. I was working on it slowly, doing chores, when suddenly my stomach cramped up. As I do have acid and stomach issues, trying this beer was ill-advised anyway, so I decided to stop after consuming a third of it rather than continue the punishment."
