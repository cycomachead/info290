"Drinker beware: This beer is freakin HOT! Smells hot, tastes even hotter. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
""
"This was punishing to drink.  Two sips and then down the drain.  I suspect that the brewer had some VERY bad beer, and decided to cover the flavor with peppers.  I hope they didn't waste good beer when making this."
""
"Pepper heat renders this beer undrinkable for normal humans."
"Overall a Powerful chile beer but you had damn well be able to tolerate hot peppers!"
""
"Way too hot!"

"Probably great for a beer batter, simmering sausages or brats, and marinades."
"Pours a hazy orange with a huge head that dies down very very quickly....no lacing left on the glass. The smell is of very hot peppers and kind of has a mexican salsa type of feel to it....I've had pepper beers before but this one smells hardcore. I took a sip and before even swallowing the beer the heat started kicking in, wow!!!!!! HOLY SHIT!...if you don't like spicy.....definitely stay away from this brew. spice lingers on the throat.....this is a beer you would want to deglaze maybe a mexican pasta dish in the pan with, it would provide killer flavor....this should be considered a cooking ingredient...not very palate friendly in my opinion just drinking it straight like this. ....The thing about this beer is that there is no balance...no sweetness...no hop presence...just straight heat.if it had some sweetness to even some of this heat out...it would be a better beer, hands down. mouthfeel is of a lager."

"Overall, just not a good beer.  Great for a uniqueness and interesting factor, just not enjoyable.  I would recommend adding some type of food that is savory to go with it."
"Cost: $3.99 for a 12 oz bottle."
""

"Stay the hell away from this. Don't even think about it. You've been warned."

"The poor was a nice amber with a bit of lace that quickly disappeared. The aroma was sharp and overwhelming, and I could not discern any hops or malt over the roasted pepper. While I enjoy spicy food, I would have to say that I find spicy beer less than tolerable. I saw this as more of a novelty, but I digress, if a pepper beer is what you are looking for, you may enjoy this, but I personally found it to be just an unpleasant assault on the senses."

""
""
"Not too bad flavor, first half of taste time. The second half of the flavor time is a burnt pepper flavor, kinda different. nice color, the head disappeared as soon as I was done pouring it in the glass. Not too hot to drink, a jalapeno has a similar heat. (those who say it is hotter are stretching the truth a little.) Website for twistedpinebrewing.com was taken down today, it listed Minnesota as selling it, Minnesota does not. you can order it thru Algona Iowa and make a road-trip like I did, but at $76/case I will not make this a weekly habit. you don't want more than 2 at a time though."

"im getting this beer a high rating because it completely advertises that you're drinking a hot pepper. Other than that you really have no expectations going into this beer so if you want to drink a pepper. This is the great beer for you so I will rate it highly based on that!"
"I poured this out after several sips. It is somewhat tasty, but it's impossible to enjoy due to the immense heat. Good luck, if you dare attempt to drink it."

"How could I not try a beer called Ghost Face Killah? I have been craving a chile beer and this one promised to be spicy. I like spicy but just could not finish 12 oz of this based on the heat alone. Not bad, but way too hot to be a go-to beer for me. I might use it as a novelty or give it to my enemies. This beer is simply hot. as. fuck. That is all."

"This 'Chile' Beer' style contains 6 different peppers including Anaheim, Fresno, Jalapeño, Serrano, Habenero, and Ghost chiles! Pours a coppery amber in color with no head to speak of with no lacing really to speak of as well. A bit heavy on the carbonation. Aroma is of various hot peppers with some sweet malt. The taste is would be excepted, spicy with heat that makes you want to drink it fast. A tad on the vinegary side. It was different of course and made the top of my head sweat some. LOL! If hot pepper is your style of beer, then here you go!"
"Was pre-gaming whilst waiting for guests to arrive for what turned out to be an epic rager. My brother dared me to chug this, so I transferred the liquid from bottle to nonic style glass and proceeded to slam this beer, hard. It set my insides ablaze. Loved it."

"Pours a nice gold with a white head that dissipates super quick. First whiff will cause you to cough. Initial sip is pretty good and you can taste some pepper. It takes a secon or two but then you feel the burn. Has a nice body to it and I really liked this beer. I would not drink it every day but I can enjoy this once or twice a year. If you like hit and spicy this beer is for you. My nose is still running as I write this!"
"Overall, this beer is a novelty. I'm glad I found it and got to try it, but I wouldn't pick it up again. There's no malt backbone at all, so as beer quality goes it's pretty poor. However, I don't think it's meant to be anything but a super-spicy novelty beer, and it achieves that very well. But it's worth picking up once to try, if only to say you did. Don't fear the ""ghost pepper;"" it's nowhere near as spicy as anything else I've had with ghost chiles."
"M: carbonation is fine, but the whole thing is way too thin. I feel like this'd level of spice would be better suited to something more oily our creamy."
""
"I admire what they have pulled off and it's one I will never forget. I will probably remember it very clearly tomorrow as well. It's clear, yellowish gold with no head and a maddening and confusing slam of heat and sting."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, golden coloring with a ton of carbonation and no head. Aromas of peppers forward and bold. Wowzers. You get a lot of the dark and roasted notes of the Serrano and Anaheim peppers, but also the nose-blistering sheer heat from the ghost face and habanero. It smells hot as shit, but I like that kind of thing, which explains my mouth watering right now. Flavors are kind of mild initially, with a warming and pepper spice on the backbone, but that is immediately followed up with a blast of hot, both in spice and actual temperature. There is a golden-style type flavor somewhere in there, but it gets absolutely pummeled by the cascade of pepper spice and heat. The body is light and smooth, and the aftertaste is...wait for it...peppers. Again, more spice than anything, but the heat remains throughout, as well, only starting to subside in the finish. The finish is fairly quick, and somewhat unremarkable based on the fact that your taste buds are shot at this point. This was a fun one to try."
"I wouldn't have more than one, and I'm sure I'll regret it tomorrow, but I would recommended you try it."

"O - this is not a beer for drinking, but maybe it would be good as a base for chili -or- just forget it, it sucks"

"O: Overall the beer is just way too hot, although I suppose that that is kinda the point. Interesting to experience, but make sure you have at least 4 other people with you to split this with, or dump the whole thing into a pot of beans, and beef and make some damn spicy chili. Overall score is low, simply because you can't finish the damn thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer actually has nice complexity in the smell and taste for a chili beer as you can detect sever of the different types of peppers; however I would consider this to be undrinkable unless you are a person that can easily handle buffalo wings with suicidal hot sauce."

"I wish this had some body, or even a pinch of sweetness. There is nothing beer tasting about this not even any malt presence to back it up. For novelty or chili heads only, not for beer fans."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is definitely a novelty beer and not exactly a beer that is meant to be ""enjoyed", they designed this beers or sole purpose to be as hot as possible. This is one of the beers we did at a big chili beer tasting and it was definitely the hottest one there although others had ""ghost"" and ""scorpion"" peppers. This isn't something you want a full glass of, they probably should have bottled it in 4-6oz nip bottles as those would have been more then plenty. An interesting beer to try especially if you are into hot stuff, but not something I'd be itching to try again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I had to give this beer that is billed as ""the hottest beer in the world"" a try when I saw it on the shelf of my local store. And hot it most certainly is! There were about 6 of us that sampled it- some said moderately hot, but others like myself thought it was flaming hot. The flavor wasn't all that bad before the incredible heat set in. But it is what it is...a novelty, yet interesting, beer to be shared with friends to see who can handle the heat."
"O: I think this beer could have been much better with the presence of a strong citrus hop flavor/aromas (possibly lemon or lime). There is some heat to this beer and drinking the entire bottle on your own is a chore - the first few sips are interesting but then it is just tedious. Glad I tried this one (test of one's enjoyment of hot peppers) but I do not think I will be getting another of these - on a side note, I was a little worried that I was becoming immune to pepper heat but this established I can still taste it."
""
"Overall, I know it's a gimmick beer but its really bad. I guess if you are someone that likes atomic wings then you would maybe like the novelty of this but it's a really bad beer otherwise. But basically they hit there goal of making the hottest beer ever, but they forgot about taste. Actually, I came back to this review cause hours later I was still thinking how bad this beer tastes. By far the worst beer I ever had."
""
"Beyond proving to myself that I could handle it, I am not sure what purpose was served by my finishing this beer. At best, this is a novelty that should be tried once. Possibly, the only props that I can give this beer is that there is truth in advertising - they claim that it is hot and it certainly is hot."

"O: Sip this slowly, i actually waited to this warmed up a bit to make the chili presence more pronounced and get the most heat out of the peppers. Faster sips are more tolearable for the not so daring. Most of the heat comes after the swallow with a sting of on the tongue. Probably the hottest chili beer ive consumed. The malt base is more respectable then daves. You tongue does eventually become numb mid drink and the beer becomes much easier to consume. This is flat out scorchville assault of chili peppers, its hard to judge this, it follows the guidelines with a light malt base so it would be unfair to judge this against smoked chipotle stout styles, where a stout chili beer has more chocolate/roast malt attributes. This is what it is, a dare, an intriquing try, and one to experience for the chili fan or looking to spring on those unsuspecting friends."
"Atmosphere is okay I guess. Deep golden hue, slight rising effervescence, no head, no lacing. Nose is peppers and vinegar. Flavor.... peppers... hot... very hot... nothing else. Mouth and lips burn after a sip for about an hour after. Overall, this is... a beer I guess."
""

"One thing that I might consider, however, is cooking with this beer, especially making a pot of chili with it. Now that might be a keeper!"
"One & done, too damn spicy to have more than one. I like Chile beers, but this is all blowtorch, no finesse. Worth a try, but better suited for Tex-Mex cooking"
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was exactly what it claims to be - hot beer. Really hot. If the scent didn't warn you off, the taste certainly should. Fitting body, but tough to handle the finish. Definitely not easy to drink. Fun to try once, but not for much more than a few sips, unless you're really into spicy drinks."

"T: Opens on the mild side- sweet and smooth with mostly honey and grain coming through. Then there's a gradual build of smoky hot fire that kind of just keeps building and building. I've had ghost pepper hot sauce before, and this never comes close to that kind of heat. But as far as beers go, this is by far the hottest I've had. Not a lot of flavor in this beer, but if hot is what you're looking for, pull up a chair."
"Overall the blend is very hot, somewhat sweet and incredibly unique -- even by chile beer standards. Rating it by traditional means is almost unfair, as this is less of a beer than a face-singeing culinary experience."
""

"Poured into a pint glass. Pale straw color and hazy with little head. The carbonation is almost non-existent. The nose is hot peppers. The taste is a creeping asault of HOT peppers. With a 6 peeper blend and habanero being one of them it is not for the faint of heart. The heat is too intense for me to finish a bottle. The malt and hops just even be tasted after the first sip; they just vanish. If you split the bottle up between 4 or more people then it might get finished."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for me - a drain pour. For someone that likes this sort of thing, it is worthy of finishing. Not a poorly crafted drink, just not something I would want to experience beyond about a 2-3 oz sample."
""
"Drinking this at the brewery! This brew pours up a clear golden color. Small white head. Aroma is straight ghost pepper, which is an empty spice spice spice smell. You can feel the tingle on your nose. Now for the taste. Pale malts with a nice hop balance. Then BAM!! Spice takes over your mouth! I think this might be the same recipe as Billy's Chilies but they just add the ghost pepper. Smooth carbo, light bodied. If you can take the heat, it's a good brew"
"O: The first truly hot chile beer I've ever had. It's not unbearable but I doubt I could drink much more than the 12 ounces by myself. Palate gets fatigued and the lips just don't like the burning for so long. Still, nice simple beer with an impressive amount of chile pepper flavor and especially heat."
""
""
"It bordered on painful to drink but I could still finish the 12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Would not try again, but worth a try if you love hot foods. If you do not like hot foods, keep away."
""
"Overall, this is a gimmick beer, and it tastes like it. The only part of the beer I liked was the heat, maybe you could cook with this to kick up the spice in some chili. Unfortunate that the taste was so bad, I love almost anything that can bring the heat, and this beer can. If the taste were better I would seek this out regularly."
""
""
"This was pretty fun. For what it is, this is done pretty well.I definitely recommend splitting the bottle several ways."
""
""
""
""
"Color is muddy golden orange, with active carbonation if you look close enough. Smells like a wild Belgian yeast that eats way too much Kung Pao. If there were a such thing as a Chile Lambic, that's how it'd smell. You get hints of that funky yeast, smothered in sweet pepper jelly. The taste is... hot. You get hit with a little lager sweetness before the flavor profile instantly bursts into flame. Luckily this is the kinda heat that simmers down quickly, but you WILL feel this beer on your lips and tongue for ahile. Mouthfeel is like a medium lager, almost a high ABV pilsner, mouth-wise. Overall this beer carries it's gimmick with pride, and in all honesty, I am enjoying it, but unfortunately the only thing it really has enough of is heat, and that's not enough to bring me back to a beer over and over."
""
"Enjoy"

""
"O: This is a novelty beer, for sure, but it's not without it's merits."
"Not what I look for in a beer but this was a novel and enjoyable experience. Most likely too hot for most folks but I like it."
""
""
"O: It's actually not the hottest thing I've ever had before - but it's one of the hottest things I've ever drank (only a couple of bloody marys or micheladas that I overspiced really challenge it). It gets a 4.5 just for the experience; it's certainly not pleasant, but it's somehow fun to drink. I reckon this would make an awesome adjunct to chili, as well."
""
"Overall I did enjoy this beer for what it was. I think best enjoyed when paired with food of the same nature."
""
""
""
"Overall this is the best chili beer probably ever, second only to the mis-categorized Budweiser Chelada (original, not light)."
""
"I can’t say I wasn’t warned and I am happy to say I have drunk this. It is definitely not for mainstream beer people. Isn’t craft beer fun!"
"[O] I bought this bottle for the novelty of it, honestly. But I will say this: Ghostface Killah is actually a very good beer - and even better when considering the style. Sure, it's for those with an affinity for heat, but those who crave a little fire will not find it to be over the top. I finished the bottle no problem."
""
"It's different than I was expecting but definitely a fun experience, it's worth trying if you like spicy things."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, this beer packs the heat unlike any other beer I have tried. As someone who enjoys spicy foods, I enjoyed the uniqueness of this beer. I wouldn't be able to drink more that one bottle of this in a sitting, actually it is pretty difficult to just finish one bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"C"
"D - None, unless eating whole habaneros is your thing. It's definitely not overly spicy, but really doesn't taste very good. Not drinkable at all."
""
"Having eaten a bare ghost pepper already (a perk from working at a liquor store), I had to try it in beer form. This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose is a blast of soaked peppers, with both the heat and the chlorophyll-laden skins coming through rather clearly. A theme that continues throughout, there is very little in the way of beer present here. The taste echoes the smell, and, as expected, the heat is there from the start in gratuitous amounts. It isn't, though, unbearable by any stretch of the imagination, but it is definitely strong and overpowering. Beyond that, no real beer character is present. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this is a fine example of peppers' innate heat being well-mobilized by a brewer, but it is unfortunately to the detriment of any other sense of beer. It'd be one thing if the peppers complemented a beer's other flavors, but here it's just pepper heat through and through. I'd still probably have another, though..."
""
""
"Overall. Well, it was an experience to say the least. Really glad to have tried it. My cheeks are sweating, and that's the level of heat that I like in any Indian, and various other ethnic foods. Extra full overall point for doing a chille beer that definitely showcases the chilles. Thanks again, willandperry!"
"O: This is a novelty beer, that's it. Just copp it for the label I guess. I could never drink 12oz and couldn't even manage much more than an oz before we decided to drain poor. I suppose if your really into to spicy peppers than this could be your thing but at this point, it's not even beer! Put it on your arroz con pollo. Never re-visiting this one."
""
""
"Well, this wasn't nearly as bad as some reviewers had led me to believe it would be. I certainly wouldn't enjoy this beyond the 6 oz sample that I had, but I did enjoy it for what it was. If I were to buy this again, I would buy it as an ingredient. I think this would be great in a batch of chili or even in a marinade."
""
"Pours golden with very quickly. Smells like a great hot sauce, but not a beer. Very crisp refreshing brew behind the pepper. Crazy hot pepper here and it is just too much. Good grief. I think it is worth trying as a novelty, but I would be impressed with anyone that could put this whole bottle down themselves. I am curious if this would be a good beer for cooking as a marinade. But as is it just burns."
""
"This was definitely a novelty among beers but was worth the try... I would not pay over $3 for it though. I would probably not do it again. Their Billy's Chillies ale on the other hand is a beer I revisit but it is much less aggressive. Ska's Mole Stout which has a nice pepper burn is wonderful. This again, is a shocking novelty. But well achieved."
""
"You aren't drinking more than a few sips; I saw a $4.50 12oz bottle at Bubbles last week and almost pulled the trigger; made with a blend of Ghost Chili; almost a metallic pepper smell on the nose; burns my throat immediately; my good lord that burns; this is the hottest beer (or drink!) I've ever or will ever taste; I almost can't type as I'm taking notes; instantly feel like I'm breathing fire; NOT for the faint of heart, fun experimental beer to share with friends."
""
""
""
"WARNING: If tobasco gets you hot and bothered, don't try this beer."
""
"This beer poured out as a very clear looking yellowish orange color. The head was white for the moment that it lasted. The clarity of the beer was much different than I expects since I had seen pictures of this beer before and it was a hazy looking orange color that reminded me of volcanic lava. The head retention and lacing don't exist on this beer at all, too many pepper oils kill off the bubbles I'm assuming. The smell of the beer is loaded with pepper aromas, not much else really. The taste of the beer has a very quick malt sweetness up front that is quickly torn to shreds by the pepper flavors. The beer is spicy, it is something that needs to be sipped unless you can tolerate this type of thing. The mouthfeel it light bodied and moderately carbonated. Overall it's not something I would ever need a full bottle of. I drank only 6 oz. and it took me a while to get through it. This beer was an adventure for sure, but not one that I need to go on again."
"The body sits a golden yellow with a faint hint of orange. A small, white cap rises and falls quickly. No lacing whatsoever. The nose is straight pepper juice/cayenne pepper powder. The pepper flavor/aromas are overly dominant. I can't seem to detect anything else. At first sip, some pale malt hits and then a rush of liquid pepper juice. The heat slowly fills the palate and retreats slowly. Light body, dry and crisp finish. Heat lingers. My stomach actually started to hurt a little bit. I honestly didn't think this was a bad attempt at a beer, just overly bold. Tough to drink, that's for sure. Best to split a bottle three ways."

"As a novelty beer, it's quite an excellent one. I love the taste of hot peppers so I found it quite tasty. It they tuned down the hotness on this, it may have even been enjoyable. I split the 12 ounce bottle between me and a friend and neither of us could finish it. Although I said I would never purchase this beer again...I can already tell that I will."
"Bought a single bottle as an impulse buy at my local Fancy Beer Store (FBS). Pepper water. If you're used to decent Tex-Mex, nothing scary here. I really expected a bigger burn from the ghost pepper, but I've had tomatillo sauces that presented hotter. No notable beer attributes. Not tasty enough to buy as a beer; not hot enough to buy as a prank. Pick it up only if you're interested in saving the label before Wu-Tang sends a cease and desist."
"I fear for the morning. Just once in my life I would love to down a six pack of this stuff just to be an idiot."

"O: As positive as I can be...this could be a nice flavor for salsa, or marinade. But there's no way it belongs in a beer. I like spicy food, and would consider using it for my next batch of beer brats. After reading about it, I didn't go into this beer with high expectations, to say the least. And it disappointed. Drain pour."
"Double Edit...I drank 12 oz of this concoction, my stomach is making some really wierd noises and burping hurts pretty bad. Not for the faint of heart, but if you are a glutton for punishment this beer is right up your alley."
"O: a fun novelty beer, glad to have tried it once but will not seek out again. This is pretty much pepper water, no discernible beer qualities here besides appearance"
"fresh hop 15? some beers are so much better than the rest."
"O - Hot! I love it! Good flavors, but the heat is just crazy!"
"This is the hottest chili beer I've tasted to date. Since I like the heat (and would love to have this while eating some hot buffalo wings!), it gets an decent overall score. Too bad there is no real head per se. I've had some tasty chili beers that manage to get a semblance of a beer head, but my take on the style is chili beer should have some heat and kick. In this case, this beer definitely has it."
""
""
"Pours amber in color with a white head. Nose is rather ominous. Intense pepper aroma which is very fresh and green. It smells quite spicy and actually stings the nose a little bit. The flavor is certainly hot and spicy, with some lingering heat, but not as bad as I was anticipating. Tons of pepper and really not much else that you can taste. Maybe some toasted malt if you’re lucky. Not awful, but about an ounce is plenty."
""
""
"The body is medium light and the carbonation is moderately high; the mouthfeel is fine, but does it really matter? I could enjoy 2 ounces of this every now and then; finishing an entire bottle on one's own seems unecessarily punitive. A novelty to be sure but not really an enjoyable one."
""
""
""
"I regret drinking this beer but was informed by other chile heads that this was the pinnacle of that style... whatever, I'll stick to my girly imperial IPAs!!!"
""
"O- no. No. No. God no."

"O - This was a great chili beer, just delicious. I love ghost chili's and this did the pepper justice. Job well done."
"If you like chiles, this is a must-try."
""
"Lovin it. Although beer wise I'd set it back a half step from Great Danes Tri-Pepper Pilsner. Thanks kawilliams81."
"its hard to enjoy this beer, but im super glad that i got a chance to try it. i was looking forward to it for awhile, and i definatly wasnt expecting it to be quite as hot as it was, despite what people have told me."
"O: I get it. Hot ass beer. And it delivers, but I completely underestimated this beer. It's terribly great."
""
""
""
"i know what they say about this one, but i can get behind it. it pours an unassuming lazy light amber color with a small white head. nothinig special right? wrong. ""hey benny, try this brew"" okay, ill try it. BOOM whoa, this is straight fire. nothing but a deep habanero burn all the way down the throat. reports from my housemates indicate that its hot on both ends as well, oh jeez. cant taste much but the heat at first, but underneath it i can tell lies a beer that is actually pretty good, some malt to it, and even some hops (i can just tell). the peppers basically ruin your night of beer drinking, better save the russian river sours for another day because you wont taste them. feel of this beer is brutal, because it destroys all sensation in the mouth and throat, and actually hurts a little. overall i respect it for what it is, but i will never touch this to my lips again. my roomate however drank a whole one, and claimed to like it, so to each his own i guess..."
"3, 4, 4, 3, 4"
"Overall pretty nice, good heat that doesn't overpower, quite hot, nice pepper flavor too."
""
"O- Probably the best chili beer I have had, that said, I don't dig chili beers, if you are into them its surely worth a shot, I would probably try it again."

"It's hard for me to even comment on this beer. It's tasty. I would love to use this at a hot sauce. And by that, I mean I would love to sprinkle A FEW DROPS on some meals. This is liquid sadomasochism. It's good for what it is, but I will have nightmares."
"Overall: Hiccups I can feel the molten gold pour down my insides. It's coating my organs, turning me in to some sort of magma beast. I will be reborn of the inferno. Infused with the righteous fires of determination. I perservere and dominate. I am the molten god."
""
""
"It lived up to the hype about it being the most intense chili beer available, but it's almost completely undrinkable."
"The mouthfeel is this with carbonation being on the lower side. Overall, they definitely succeeded at making a hot as hell beer. As a chili beer, it was a cool novelty to share with friends and get some laughs from. As a beer though, it's about as drinkable as hot pepper juice is."
"And if nothing else, I haven't had such fun cracking a beer in a long, long time. Sharing this insane concoction and the hearty laughs that came with it with my tasting group won't soon be forgotten."
"This beer was exactly what I was hoping it would be: intensely spicy, yet actually enjoyable. I split the bottle between 6 or so brave beer drinkers, but I happily finished my 2+ oz. pour."
""
"Overall, it really isn't enjoyable because of how hot it is. I love peppers, but there was too much in this beer to make the beer drinkable. Definitely a novelty beer."
""

"Overall not bad with a great smell but the flavor could be better."
""

"Overall: Like drinking pepper juice. I detect no beer aspects in the aroma or taste. It was cool to try it for the novelty. That is really about it. Cheers."

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy tan head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is all about the different peppers used but overall the aromas are pretty tame and quite nice actually. Taste is nothing but incredibly hot pepper flavors with an intense heat that burns the lips, mouth, and throat with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is definitely a novelty beer and I am pretty sure nobody would realistically go for an entire bottle themselves. Quite interesting but a grueling experience to sample."

"Overall: a must try and a must share. Perhaps 4 oz bottles would be better."
"Overall, I struggled with rating this beer. But it's exactly what it intends to be. This is the logical conclusion of the chili beer. As a pal said, it's ""like giving Satan a rimjob."" Brutality. Would have again for sure. We drew short pretzels to see who had to kill the 6 oz left in the bottle and overall drinking this beer was probably the most fun single beer at a tasting. That has to count for something."
""
""
"Overall: For a novelty beer it did what it promised. Burned. I can't really knock it because it didn't really promise anything other than that. My expectations were met. I personally didn't enjoy it but for the novelty aspect it was great! For the beer flavor aspect? Not so much."
""
"O: I like this beer; the pepper variety adds complexity and though this isn't a normal, go-to beer, it's fun and I will definitely be back; I'm not sure why some say it was difficult to get through; yes, it's spicy but I slowed down and am happy to say I made it through the entire bottle; let's do this again, GFK, let's do this again"

"OK. I sought out this beer so I can only blame myself for this. Pours with no head at all. Zero lacing. Zero retention. Aroma is likelike chili oil. Smells like fresh hot peppers just cut. Tastes like chili sauce. The heat sort of creeps up on you. It is just on the pleasant side of hot sauce. Could go very nicely with some Mexican or Thai food. Mouthfeel is heat. Light dry and hot. It is exactly what I would want from a hot pepper beer. I am using overall as drinkability. Holy crap. More than 2 oz is too much. Its a cool experience and a very unique beer."
"O- It's pretty much exactly what it says it is, an insanely hot beer, the chilies are actually really tasty though, it's more drinkable than I expected, an awesome chili beer."
"O: More of a wow factor. Not balanced at all but takes the cake for chile beers. Highly recommended for one time, grab a buddy to share."
""
""
""
"O: Impressive, but damn, how could anyone drink an entire bottle of this?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure why anyone would drink this beer unless it is on some sort of a dare. I could not make it through a bottle and would only use it for cooking. The beer is just too spicy to to drink and you can not taste anything in the beer other than fire."
""
"i dug it, its not meant to be this big flavorful beer, its meant to be hot as shit, and it is."
"O - I drank it for the experience with a friend. He may not ever drink any beer I ever pour for him. So more for me!"
""
""
"Overall Impression- If you are planning on going to a beer tasting or party, I would recommend picked up ONLY 1- 12oz Bottle of this! I shared with over half the bar @ a Blue Grass Event and no one could go back for seconds after their less than 2oz pour. I definitely suggest buying this just to find out how hot a ""Chili"" Beer can really be! Unreal, and many faces turned asking ""this is a beer?", including myself."
""
"D/O - Drinkability is low. This is a beer in which a little goes a long, long way. I've had this glass in front of me for almost 30 minutes and I probably drank maybe 3oz. The heat is intense, but after letting it mellow on the mouth, it gradually fades into a dull heat throb which isn't so bad actually. Honestly, split this because I couldn't imagine drinking a whole bottle of this solo. I am probably going to put the rest back into the glass and cook with it or something."
"Liquid heat. Yellow body with rapidly dissipating white foamy head. Don't get me wrong, I like my chile beers, but this is something burning pain. I am writing this 5 hours later and still feeling it. Its absolutely not too drinkable, so the rest of it is going into my slow cooking stew for later in the week."
""
"O - Interesting beer to try once. I split this 12oz. beer three ways with two buddies and not one of us could finish it. Was not even a bit pleasurable drinking it. Had to chase it with another beer. Just crazy hot and I enjoy my share of spice and kick. This beer was fun but...C'mon man!"
"Off top this is a novelty beer. Golden color, looks like a beer. The smell gives a very good indicator of what you can expect, smoky peppers, just foreboding in every sense of the word. the flavor is smoky pepper, maybe that is the serrano? It then quickly morphs into heat that is not a joke. I love hot foods so this did not phase me but make no mistake this beer is hot and you will feel it in your tongue. I had to try this beer because I have had good chile beers from Coopersmith's and Stone 11.11.11 but I won't revisit this."
""
""
"A crazy feat of a beer that I respect the hell out of of, but I don't think this will be anything I stock up on. I have another bottle I'll certainly drink, but I'm still more intrigued about the possibility of using it in cooking more than drinking it."
"O - As far as ""chile beers"" go, this has got to be one of the best. A fun tick at the very least."

"When poured this looks like your average beer. But then you smell it and it is all peppers. No hops, no malt, just hot, hot peppers. Taste is more of the same. I appreciated how the peppers retained their own character, there was definite complexity within the pepper flavor but that was all I tasted and it was extremely spicy. It flooded my entire mouth and throat with hot spicy tingling. The mouthfeel just shot hot hot heat all around and the carbonation just made the spiciness explode. Overall I am glad I tried it. I am not big on spicy foods but I was surprised by how well they captured the complexities of the chile's used. If you like chile's and hot foods you should definitely seek this out."
"O: Cool beer to try, wouldn't seek it out again in the future."
"All these pansies talking about acid reflux and indigestion? :) -wasn't caused by this beer. A buddy and I finished a half bottle each with no problems and no seering pain or anything. It is definitely hot with what I call a ""pleasant"" tingle in the mouth. Base beer is solid and the peppers take the frontstage. I traded for more after I picked up the first couple bottles."
"Thanks goes to who ever killed the bottle in my glass."
"On a post note, I eat a ton of spicey food and have a very high tolerance. The sheer acidity of this beer though caused me massive heartburn (an unusual thing) that forced me to go out at 4:30 am for Zantac. If you feel the need to tick this, beware."
"O - Well, the name is cool and it's f'n hot. So, I think they pretty much captured what they went out to do here. I couldn't drink much, but it's def as-advertisted. Hot a shit. If you like hot salsa or anything with peppers, try this. Hurts to drink, so that's a negative."
"D - 12oz bottle was split 5 ways, an no one was successful in finishing his or her pour. Ended up making a wonderful cuvée when blended with infected Shorts PB & J. I had horrendous reflux for the rest of the night and into the early morning. Avoid unless you are a masochist."
"This is punishment. No enjoyment can really be had here, especially not being a hot head. Glad to have tried it...I think..."
"O: I hope to I never cross paths with this thing again, but I'm glad I got to tick this."
"Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is a hard beer to rate since it is so unlike most other beers, but I did like it."
"Overall: Yes, sir, it's a Chile Beer alright and an expected undertaking to finish off my helping."
"Pour looks like you would expect a macro lager to look like, yellow and fizzy. Aroma of peppers abounds, taste is a bit sweet at first, corny, then gives way to the peppers. Not to hot, but defanatly has some heat to it. Swish it around in you mouth for a bit. A lot of jalapeño and ancho flavor is strong to me. Good for a pepper beer, would like to try a freshie."
"O- Pretty cool since it has the ghost chili in it and seeing the guy from Man vs Food almost kill himself eating them. I drink just a bit of this one and my stomach felt it. I'd say this one would be really hard to drink."
"I'm a huge fan of chile beers, but only if they're beers flavored with peppers, not just liquid heat. This is one of the stupidest beers ever deliberately made."
"Overall: This is a one and done beer for me. I am glad I got the opportunity to try this beer. Its best pepper beer I have ever had. Too hot for my liking, but that was this beers purpose. Pepper beers are just not my thing!"
"nice light amber pour gave way to There was a slight bit of pepper way in the back but it was not dominating by any means. The initial sip was a work of art. Sweet milk chocolate and sugar roll across the tongue with a lively and well carbonated feel that really lets the flavor pop. Moving through you start to feel a tingle on the tongue, a warming in the throat and a fire in the belly. Subtly the chili comes through, warming you as it goes, but by no means is this too big. This is perfectly blended in the flavor, rising subtly to a crescendo that then backs down as easy as it came up. Really very well done here. After taste of peppery notes, hints of chocolate as well coming through and leaving a long lasting tingling feeling that was hard to ignore. Awesome feel on this one, about as good as you can get and the drinkability was more then decent, given the style at hand. One of the first, and actually the only of its kind that I was able to put down with some form of regularity."
"O: A very good gimmick beverage. This really doesn't taste like beer, though. I'm glad I tried it, but i wouldn't have it again or recommend it to others unless they're interested in the gimmick itself."
"Pours clear gold with white head. Smells of pretty much nothing but fresh chili peppers. And the taste is also dominated by chili peppers. No other flavor components to speak of. This beer does not burn your tongue, but builds up quite a burn in the back of the throat after a couple sips. Really not sure what the point of making this beer is. Not worth seeking out unless you're attracted to the gimmick factor."
"#666"
"Overall, I very much enjoyed it. It goes without saying that I won't be drinking a half dozen of these on a hot day, but as far as the style goes, I think they nailed it."
"Overall -- While I feel that this is a great showcase for the chiles, I still would not want to drink this on a regular basis, or possibly ever again. Still, I'm glad I tried it."
"At least the name and label is cool"
"Overall - I'll say what I said about Billy's Chili's, I enjoyed this beer, but not more than one at a time and not every day, but goes well with mexican or other spicy food, it's a nice change of pace, but if you don't like spicy food or hot peppers, than this isn't going to change your mind. Very similiar to Twisted Pine's other chiliy beer, just a more intense and longer lasting heat."
"O - Pretty good for what it is. I believe the hype and build-up is a little over the top for the actual payoff. There is some additional heat from the ghost pepper, but not so much as to warrant seeking this out over their Billy's Chilies."
"Melted my mind."
"Overall, it's a completely one dimensional beer - it's all about the heat and the chilis. But it's definitely the hottest beer I've had. It's not as bad a ghost pepper sauces I've had though."
"Golden yellow beer that is moderately clear, small carbonation bubbles noticeable but nothing for head retention. Aroma is Chile and green bell peppers with onions. Flavor is initially a crisp lager but is immediately decimated by heat. While the heat is pleasantly strong it is all in the back of my mouth and very monotone. Not the best Chile beer out there, but there are many worse ones."
"O: a fun novelty beer, i've had hotter homebrewed stuff. glad to have tried it once but will not seek out again. this is pretty much pepper water, no discernible beer qualities here besides appearance"
"mouthfeel - sort of obvious from the taste"
"EDIT/UPDATE: Tried another bottle....was still not impressed."
"Amazing. I have very little experience with the Ghost Chili, but this actually has me even more scared of it. If Jolokia can transfer this much pepper heat into a beer, the real thing must be deadly."
"Good beer for those who like spice, or for a good red-beer."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a light straw color with a very smallish white head. This beer is essentially Billies Chiles, ""dry-hopped"" with ghost chiles. Nice smokey aromas, roasted hatch chiles and light straw. On the palate, this one is very light and drinkable, with flavors of smoke, fresh chiles and roasted hatch chiles, with some slowly building heat on the back of the throat. Not nearly as hot as I was led to believe, but a very well balanced and drinkable chili beer."
"EDIT: After having a full bottle last night, I'd have to say that this is a tasty brew and have changed my rating a bit."
