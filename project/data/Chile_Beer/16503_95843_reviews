"Holy cow - spicy peanuts galore. Not something I could hang with, but they do a great job of capturing the flavor."

"Sweet peanuts on the nose.  Initial taste is exactly that- sweet peanut sauce.  Then the spice hits you.  Fairly hot, but you won't be on the ground crying 30 minutes later.  Very bizarre flavor for a beer, but they certainly nailed it."

"Different, and not the best peanut butter beer I've had, but not that bad, either. I like the attempt at something different, and I never thought I'd say this, but I wish the peppers were kicked up a notch or two. Solid, but something I'd probably pass up if I saw it again."
