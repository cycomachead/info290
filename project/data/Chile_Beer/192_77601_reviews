"When you first drink if you get the cocoa but in the following you start getting more spice to the taste.  Pretty good beer."
""
""
"Has a very nice hint of coconut at the beginning followed by a spicy aftertaste. The spice is a bit too much and takes away from the beer."
"Overall: I am big into large Chile stouts now, though I will not purchase this again. It is too thin and lacks flavor. The Chile and chocolate are there, as is a caramel sweetness in first sip. There is nothing to compliment these flavors, which bodes I'll for a larger (8% or so, and above) beer. It is too thin and their is no bold roasted dark grain flavor. Tasted more like a low IBU amber with chocolate and Chile flavors, which I would not of purchased."
"4.0 D:  I really love chile beers.  This is a market that needs expanded.  This is a good one."
"Greatly enjoyed this.  Enjoyed the subtle heat.  It's a little too cinnamony as it warms up."

"Mole in a bottle.  The heat sneaks up on you"
""
""
"Really captures the spirit of a good mole sweet and spicy"
"Overall, a pretty decent chili beer with no regrets. I recommend sharing it with someone though because the cinnamon might get a little boring."

"Good stuff. Between the two more widely available chile/chocolate/cinnamon brews, I give the advantage to Xocoveza, but I enjoy this plenty."

"Another Lips of Faith winner!! Beautiful dark color with a cinnamon pepper smell smell. Lots of south of the border chocolate taste up front that lingers and eventually turns into a slow burn of pepper. Absolutely amazing!!"
""
""
"This is an excellent spiced stout. It leans a little too heavily toward sweetness and cinnamon; I would like more of a strong base stout. Roasted malt is overwhelmed by sugar and spice. Tastes a little artificial in doses."

"Amazing take on a chili beer...  Loaded with interesting flavors and aromas...  Cinnamon and chilis dominate in both departments...  No booze at all... Scary drinkable...  32 oz growler fill is perfect...  Delicious and different..."
"O-  Great Chile beer!  Balanced spice."
"An interesting beer, but not something I would pick up again.  The nose is cinnamon, nothing subtle about it, and quite nice.  Taste is a letdown in that whatever cocoa is there (and it's not much) is quickly overcome by the chile.  It starts with the flavor found in the skin if dried chile and finishes with spice, again not subtle.  It actually packs some heat.  Body is a bit thin, and the alcohol too is covered up by pepper.  Not too much enjoyable here for me."
"Overall: Not sure about this one, I'm not the biggest chili beer fan. It's OK, but not up on a par with my all time favorite chile beer, Stone Xocoveza. Not sure if I'd seek this out again."
"This grew in me as I sipped it, but overall wasn't my cup of tea.  I appreciated it and it intrigued me, though.  My girlfriend liked it, so I can see having another glass at another time for a change of pace."

"This beer has a lot going on and I will do my best to review it to the best of my ability. Pours a deep brown color with minimal head and spotty lacing. Aroma hits you hard with scents of cinnamon, roses, and some weird, yet intriguing other aroma that I just cant figure out. Taste is very bold like the nose. Touches of wet cinnamon and allspice are definitely present and their is a slight burn that I would guess is a combination of the alcohol and the ancho, guajillo and chipotle peppers. The heat is not overbearing, but you tend to get more of it on the front end than the back. I am getting very little cocoa out of this. This beer is full of all kinds of mild to moderate spice and the mouthfeel is a little less than I would have expected after the first taste. Hard to tell how the balance is because of everything that is going on, but overall, this is the most unique beer I have had. A sipper, slow and steady, lol."
""
""
""
"What a great flavor!! Definitely feel a little heat after.  Would highly recommend."
""
""
""
"Dark with thin brown head. Subtle spice and chocolate aroma. Taste is subtle too, cocoa, malt, and hint of spice. Very nice."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – An interesting one to try, but a little too peppery and spiced for my tastes.  If you like chili spice and chocolate porters this may be for you, but if not you may not want to take this on."
"Overall I really liked this beer as a great example of a molé-style beer. Not something I would want"
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Cinnamon,chocolate malt, subtle chili pepper warmth, caramel. Subtle but complex lineup of flavors, easy drinking for the strength."
"Overall: A darned good pepper porter. Would repeat."
"Enjoyed from the bomber in a snifter during a bottle share. A truly unique porter.  Poured a deep dark red brown with a creamy white head that dissipated after a couple of minutes.  Nice lacing. Aromas of cinnamon, cocoa powder with hints of pepper spices.  A little worried at the first sip that it might be awful.  However, I am glad the aromas were misleading.  Tastes of cocoa with a slight hint of roasted chilies.  Cinnamon and vanilla. Rich dark roasted malts as well.  The back end is mainly dark roasted malts with cocoa with the roasted chilies.  Finishes both sweet and spicy.  Great chile beer."
""
""
"Interesting beer to try once, a bit too sweet for me."
"Too hot, not enough chocolate, too thin, no aroma, just not good. Another drain pour from NB."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"This is a unique brew. They nailed the spicy aspects. The spices aren't overwhelming, but they're clearly the star of the show. The flavors shine. I just wish it had a better nose. It's much better than my numeric score might indicate."
""
""
"I've had ""mole"" themed beers before and loved them.  I've had stouts brewed on cocoa nibs and chiles, and several of them are among my favorites.  Unfortunately, there is nothing nuanced about this one, and it's probably the final nail in the coffin for me when it comes to New Belgium."
"Pours a reddish dark brown. Smells of cinnamon, malty, capsaicin and hot chocolate. Tastes peppery, light heat in the throat, malty, milk chocolate and astringence. Medium light body. Chocolate malt and chili heat in the aftertaste."
""

""

""

"O:  I intend to get a bomber of this superb brew.  A great dessert beer and one to share with friends."
"Spicyness of peppers plays nicely into the warming 9% ABV of the beer. The beer is a bit thin for the variety of flavors presented. The nose reminisent of a spicy cinnamon cupcake. Overall the beer is on the sweet side. Cinnamon takes over the beer and the sweetness of the Ceylon (Mexican) cinnamon also plays into the sweetness of the beer."
"Aftertaste killed this beer for me. I could taste the cinnamon/chili blend several hours and two meals later"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A well executed chili beer. The roasted malts and cocoa nibs act as a nice supporting cast to the bold smokiness and heat from the peppers. Worth a go if your seeking some heat in your brew."
""
""
"I am a beautiful person. I am trying to get a chance to win the game"
"Nice smooth stout. Not real heavy. Has a cinnamon flavor with some heat."
""
"I got this as a gift. It was spicy on the backside and definitely a beer you sip on."
""
""
"The pepper is overwhelming, not as good as stones version"
""
""
""
""
"Excellent mouth feel. The chilies don't over the layers of flavor. Toffee, slight coffee, and mild chocolate comes in.  The chilies give the perfect kick."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pretty outstanding balance of heat (via peppers) and cocoa. Just a perfect snowy weather beer."
"O: I'm happy to see this one back again. Well done spice, very cool (I would say unique but this seems to be the trend now) but well done none the less."
"I may be biased in this review. I had this brew GABF week in 2012 in NB's private tasting room. They served it with fresh, locally made Belgian waffles. (yes, the perfect pairing!) I got to meet many of their Brewers and spent most of a Friday sampling oddities along with Felix and Oscar from their oak foeders. The new release is still great! It pours a dark brown with red highlights. Great medium brown lacing. The aroma is chocolate, cinnamon, smoke and malt. The taste is very balanced and dry with a hint of vanilla. Very little heat. The chipotle peppers contribute smoke and the cinnamon punches up the round maltiness. Mouth feel is perfect, between a dry and oatmeal stout. There is a bread-like character to this beer. However, it doesn't scream Fat Tire yeast like some of their other brews like Ranger ect. Very little hop character. Bitterness seems to come more from the cinnamon than the hops. But my guess is it's hopped with low alpha english hops. The beer was out of production for several years. It tastes as good as I remember. I highly recommend it. I've attempted to recreate it on a home brew scale, but I always miss it slightly! Thank you, New Belgium, for bringing it back!"

"O:  A little disappointing aromas, but tasty brew.  Easy drinking."
""
"I'm sure I've had molé at some point in my south of the border (again, the one along the 49th parallel) Mexican restaurant forays over the years, but my impression of it is more academic than anything.  Anyways, Cocoa Molé does well by the textbook, and the tastebuds - spicy, but not too much, y'know, the heat deftly countered by a cocoa-driven malt sweetness.  The only real question is that of the whereabouts of the 18-proof booze - I'll have to get back to y'all on that one."

"22 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, bottled on 1/29/2015. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, cherry, plum, fig, date, caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, toast, cinnamon, chile pepper, and herbal/spice earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark fruit, dark/bready malt and chili/spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, toast, cinnamon, chile pepper, and herbal/spice earthiness. Some light roast/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown sugar, cinnamon, chile pepper, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a while. Chile pepper heat builds up as you finish the glass, but doesn’t get overbearing. Fantastic complexity and robustness of dark fruit, dark/bready malt, and chile/spice flavors; with a great dark fruit/malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic chile spiced beer. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark fruit, dark/bready malt, and chile/spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the the ABV with the moderate heat from the peppers. A highly enjoyable offering."

"2015 release drank in Feb 2015. Sweet then spicy. I'm a sucker for peppery or smoky porters, Mexican food and spicy foods, so that is part of my affinity. Very smooth and as good as I remember it from the last release a few years ago."
""
""
""
"Having had other ""hot spiced"" beer, this one stands out in my opinion.  Pours a very dark brown, wtih the spices coming to the forefront of the smell.  The taste brings some warming heat, but there is also a sweetness that is present.  The heat of the spice lasts well into the next sip.  Overall a nice beer."
""
""
""
"taste is almost ""adjunct-like"" but the level of flavor competes with that profile. definitely can taste some chile and it adds to the flavor profile. kind of chocolate-y. carbonation appears although there are no bubbles- could it be the heat from the chile? great beer but thin."
""
""
""
"If you are like me, and have a weakness for authentic Mexican cuisine as well as a finely-crafted beer, this porter is a love letter to you."
"Want more of everything except cinnamon. Especially more chilies. Would also like it with more body, as a stout perhaps?"
"Really enjoyed this complex beer.  The spice is mild but stands out.  Would go out of my way to get this beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: An excellent beer, not quite as good as Victory at Sea Mole, but still excellent.  A little sweeter than I think it should have been but otherwise great"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit odd; nice notes throughout but if there was a sense of it being a perfect example of a style that would be nice. It's a little bit off-kilter stylistically: too sweet for some things and too spicy for others. Still, I quite enjoy it."

"A dark brown/blackish body (bad lighting where I had it) with one finger head that goes quick on top of a spicy, chili esque aroma though not too dominant as the chocolate is real strong in the aroma as well. Taste is mostly chocolate and chili but I found a good balance as the beer is a sweet heat, in other words the chilis don't just add a little spice to the chocolate and the chocolate isn't overpowered and letting the beer get too ""hot"". Chewey, bready, fuller bodied, some minor fruit notes that I can't really placed. Overall, just a really good beer."
"I really liked this beer as it combined some heat with some cocoa and cinnamon. Everything works in this experiment as the heat backed the stout like beer and the spices added some sweetness. The Mexican flavour aspect is unique and very cool. I would love to get a bottle and pair it with some Mexican food."
""
""
""
""
"This is a lovely brew, well rounded with a perfect balance of chili to cocoa to spice and still stays a beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was really impressed by this beer. It was one that was sitting in my cellar looking at me for a while but I was never in the mood to try it. Finally broke it out and happy I did. Very complex, very unique."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Above average to solid. Seems right for the style. I would suggest you try it if you're into chile beers but it might not be hot enough for you. Weaklings like myself should probably give it a pass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - i was not impressed the first few sips but it grew on me as it warmed. i've had better beers in this style."
""
""
"O: A great beer. I'll definitely be going back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll say it again, this is a slightly spicy bottled churro. Loses something on the taste as it warms. Solid though."
"This is quite an interesting chile-chocolate beer. It has some nice chile and chocolate flavors, but neither are extreme. I could probably drink a lot of this. I hope New Belgium makes more of this, especially when the East Coast brewery is up and running..."

"O-it's a pretty decent chili beer. I've had few beers that can make a good cocoa/chili blend, but this is pretty close! i think they could've had a strong cocoa flavor while keeping some aspect of pepper flavor, though i'm glad the pepper was in the nose."
""
"o: a very interesting concept that i’d say was executed successfully, I’ve had decent pepper beers before, but in this case the play between pepper and chocolate adds an extra dimension of interest"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: considering this is a brown ale and not a stout with peppers like huna or abraxas. This is an awesome beer. still has a few years on it if you want. who knows where it will go."
"O: Appreciate what it's trying to be, but not my cup of tea."
""
"O: Much enjoyed and recommended. I hope to have this again, but would be hesitant to tackle a 22oz bomber by myself."

"Overall pretty good, I like the pepper heat, it's a nice level that you def know it's there but doesn't destroy the beer, and even a light pepper flavor which is nice. The malts are nice as well, caramel mocha molasses, toasty bread crumbs, coffee cake, etc. I wasn't a huge fan of the cocoa as it tasted more like Swiss Miss hot cocoa powder rather than cocoa nibs and dark chocolate kinda taste. The cinnamon and other spices are interesting and a nice addition but I wish the cinnamon in particular was a little toned down. The lack of carbonation is probably the only real gripe I have. However, those are nit picking as this was a pretty good beer all around."

"If you like Mole this is an obvious choice. Not an everyday drinker, obviously, but like Indra Kunindra, a good time if this kind of thing is up your alley."

"If you really like Molé, you should really enjoy this beer."
""
"O- It's a weird beer. Not sure I would order it again."
""

"Nice dark Carmel flavors with a slight hop taste,the chilli blends nice with the other spices, Looks good in the glass. Went well with with spice food. Many beers at 9 o/o have an alcohol after taste, this was not evident in this brew. The nice thing about the brew is the chilli is not over powering just a light after taste."
""
""
""
"Overall a unique beer, worth the try."
""
"I normally like all of New Belgiums creations but do not recommend this unless you wanna play a joke on someone,"
""
""
""
""
""

""
"All things considered, Cocoa Mole would be better as an imperial stout. Pretty good nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Quickly diminishing head. Translucent brown in appearance. Strong cinnamon and baking spice flavor with a little pumpkin and a hint of salt on the finish. I feel like it needs more of a bittering hop presence. decent beer if you split three ways, a half pint is all i need. should be released in the fall. it would make for a nice after dinner drink. Not my thing, but an unusual beer that i am glad to have tried."
""
"O - This beer is a unique one with an odd combination that works. Something tells me I'll have all hell to pay tomorrow after it works through my system. (!!!) Looks like a glass of dead beer that's been sitting out all night, which is a downer, but not a deal killer. As the beer sat in the glass the chile burn faded somewhat."
"I like this. Finding a good spicy beer on the open market is not something you come across everyday, so pick it up if you're into something new."
"O: This is one hell of a chile beer. Great combination of chile heat, bitter cocoa and caramel to sweeten it all up. Very drinkable and well balanced. Easily the best crafted chile beer I've had. By a long shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Light body. Moderate to high carbonation."
""
""

"Carbonated like a stout, feels sorta milky with a dry finish."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - extremely unique. spicy, cinnamon and chocolate. the peppers and heat really is a wild combo. for a chile beer, this one works!"
""
""
"O: Great stuff here. A lot going on and so much to savor. A fun one-off beer that is a great representation of this style."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a brownish head. A sweet, cinnamon aroma paired with somecocoa, roasted malt and some pepper. First flavor to hit is a huge bomb of sweet cinnamon that teases of being too much but ends up being just right as it pairs with the cocoa, roasted malt and the heat of the peppers in the finish. A nice creamy medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice brew."
"i haven't ventured much into this style... i believe this is my third chile beer, though it is also the best one i've had. i hope my experimental chipotle stout comes out this good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OK, I had this beer twice. The first time i tried it, The bartenter (whom I wont name) said it tastes like licking an ash tray... So I tried it, and lo and behold, it... tasted like an awkward beer. (I've never had an ashtray before) The second time I tried it was to try and confirm the previous statement. I thought of green chilies and spices and... even tacos. It worked, and I liked it. This is a creative brew that I'll buy again."
"Off tap at the Frisco in Columbia, MD, this beer was a dark brown color like stained walnut wood. The one finger of khaki-colored head was only so-so but it did leave lacing in scattered streaks. The aroma was rather faint for what ended up being a highly flavorful brew. I smelled mostly caramel, chocolate and candi sugar. The flavors were outstanding. I tasted chocolate, fruity esters, toffee, Belgian candi sugar, light red pepper and spicy capsicum notes as well as a touch of bubblegum. Well balanced and not overly spicy while still managing to hide the 9% ALC very well. The mouthfeel was frothy, the body medium and the carbonation delicate. Delicious and complex, this one is well worth ones time."
"Overall, solid stuff. It's very interesting, and does a pretty good job of hitting its targets. Is it successful as a beer? There's very little to compare it to. I'm personally impressed at its style and experimentation, but I can't see this becoming a more widely accepted genre."
""
""
"Overall: This is a really good beer. It promised mole and it keeps that promise. I would definitely have more given the chance."
""
""
"Overall, it's interesting. Definitely a specialty beer, and it makes you crave a glass of water every few sips. But as your palate gets used to it, it's easier to drink. Very good, if also very unique (in my experiences)."
""
""
"Very well done."
"While I like different types of beers I don't think I would buy this again. Just not my cup of tea."
"O - This beer really isn't for me. This is just plain odd. The fruit punch aspect is disturbing, the cinnamon is overpowering and the peppers don't add much flavor, just heat/burn in the throat on the swallow. Maybe this is a bad bottle (I can only hope it is)...it was odd looking, smelling and tasting. Drainpour."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very tasty experiment. I really enjoyed this beer and will look for it again."
""
""
""
"D - Really interesting, this is unbalanced and weirdly milk chocolate like, but not undrinkable. It would best be described as similar to Mexican hot chocolate."
"Overall: this beer is very interesting and complex. It is actually really nicely balanced and unique in a good way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Wow, really impressed with this one. New Belgium has made a chile beer right. The whole sweet / heat flavor profile is done well. Would buy this again."

"Dark clear amber with lovely head retention. Complex nose with nicely balanced cocoa, cinnamon spice, and dried chili. Sweet and smooth and full bodied but drinkable. Good platform for the interplay between chocolate and spice. Love the chili, I'm not usually a fan of chili beers but this is fantastic. I think they used dried chili which gives it a sort of sweet, grassy, almost herbal flavor up front and a slightly harsh heat in the back. Not too hot though, and the caramel and chocolate malts even it out. Obscenely drinkable for the style and for the ABV."
"Drinkability – This is quite drinkable, in spite of the chili bite. The chili does an amazing job of covering the 9% abv; I never would have guessed it to be that high."
"A good beer. Not for everyone and those with an aversion to spice may want to pass, but it's relatively drinkable for being so high in ABV and so spicy."
""
""
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear reddish/brown color with about a half inch light tan head that didn't stay around for too long. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is mostly sweet, it smells like chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, and some chile peppers. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like chocolate, chile peppers, cinnamon, caramel, and a little bit of coffee. There's a good lingering spicy finish, and the pepper flavor is much stronger in this brew than I expected it to be considering the aroma isn't very spicy. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and coating, but it also seems somewhat thin at times. Moderate carbonation. Overall I think it's a good, tasty brew that I would like to try again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer started okay but ended up completely falling flat for me. The spices overwhelm the flavor profile of the beer leaving it too cinnamon forward in the end (which says a lot because I love it, I put a crap-ton in in my oatmeal everyday). LOF series beers are quite hit or miss, you can guess where I feel this one falls."
""
""
"Pair it with something Mexican...mole (duh) burrito, peppered flank steak, churros."
""
""
"Overall this was pretty darn good. Chile beers aren't usually my kind of thing, but this one stands out above most to me. Would recommend to any chile beer fans or anyone who likes Mexican hot chocolate."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is slightly thick. Overall, this is pretty good. I don't get much in the way of chili, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn, this is interesting. Better than any chili pepper beer I've ever had, and better than most chocolate beers I've known. An interesting drinking experience that doesn't over-do it in any way, just keeps everything together, balanced, and drinkable. Mmm, chocolate comes back, keeping pace with pepper heat. Yum. Another hit from the Lips of Faith."
"Interesting offer from New Belgium. I enjoyed it for it's uniqueness and complexity but I think the cinnamon is a little too strong and that makes a bomber hard to finish. It's definitely the dominate flavor. Perhaps best suited sharing this one."
"The beer pours a brownish-red color with a tan head. The aroma is full of chocolate and cocoa, with some light chili notes and some roasted malt. The flavor is a little more complex. There is a ton of milk chocolate and roasted green pepper notes, as well as some cream and some roasted malt. There is also a little bit of heat from the peppers. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice chocolate-chili beer, a style that has become more popular and I am always excited to try."
"O-Stoked. Well rounded. Very drinkable considering how high the abv is. Looking forward to seeing this age"
""
"D - This was pretty enjoyable. There are probably a bazillion calories in here, but it tastes great and the alcohol is quite well-hidden. I imagine it'd be tough to drink a whole bomber by myself, but it's a nice beer for sharing. Delivers exactly as promised - would drink again."
"O: An enjoyable experience, chock full of chocolate and peppery spices. Still, unremarkable and unrecommended."
"D: This was a very nicely balanced beer with great scent and taste. Decent body and smooth finish, so very easy to drink and enjoy. I loved the kick at the end - just enough to be serious but not overpowering. Probably best fresh. Recommended."
""
""
""
"O - This was a very tasty and unique beer. New Belgium follows through on exactly what they advertised: an ale with cocoa and spices. I was a little skeptical from the appearance, as this basically had no head, but the rest of beer delivered. I’ll definitely be on the lookout for more Lips of Faith beers and some different chile beers."
""
"O - Truly enjoyed this one. Another interesting offer in the Lips of Faith Series. I hope to see this one again."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. The Lips of Faith series in my experience has been great. I recommend this."
"Poured a nice copper into my pint. I found a somewhat metallic nose with a hint of cinnamon and malt. Hints of cocoa and vanilla immediately hit my mouth with a sharp bite of cinnamon to follow. After a few brief seconds, the spice from the peppers hits my throat. I was very surprised at how awesome this beer was as New Belgium just always seems to be so mainstream and ordinary. This beer is a sipper and I found that the cocoa and vanilla come out even more as the beer warms."
"I would enjoy this again, especially if paired with chocolate and fruit."
""
""
""
"I'm giving it a 4.5 overall for its' uniqueness. I hope they make it a year or two from now, preferably at Christmas."

"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this beer. The fact that its so unique and interesting makes it easy to like for me, and I can get past the touch of heartburn the peppers are causing me. The drinkability is limited since the flavors are so unique but rich, but a perfect beer for sharing and examining its different attributes. Certainly not a beer for timid palates, but for those with a taste for the extreme and different, this is a perfect example. Definitely a conversation starter."
""
"This beer is completely wicked. There's a light pepper spice with a minimal warming sensation along with light chocolate and more prenounced cinnamon notes. An excellent sipper beer to be enjoyed slowly. The smell is wonderful too. I really hope this beer comes back one day."
""
"Overall, just a celebration beer. Not something I will have often, but a nice sipper."
"O- I was very satisfied with this beer and could easily see it becoming one of my favorites. Sweet, but not too sweet, and a nice spicy tingly finish. Oh, it's 9% ABV? who knew!"
"O- There's a lot of promise in this beer. If it would have done what I anticipated it doing, namely had some head retention and developed more than a duopoly of flavors, it could have been very good. As it is, average to below average brew. Will not try again and I'll try to restrain myself the next time a LoF beer looks interesting."

"650 ml bottle. Pours a dark cola brown with a small tan head that settles to a ring and leaves very little lacing. Aroma is rocoa, smoked chiles, vanilla, a bit of cinnamon, and a mineral note. The taste is sweet cocoa, cinnamon, some smoked pepper, and a bit of a mineral note. It finishes with some smoky pepper heat and a light bitterness. Light body. Low carbonation. This reminds me a little bit of Hunahpu's, but without the roastiness to balance the other flavors and without the amazing full, creamy mouthfeel."
""
"Notes: Nice and pleasing brew. It does not deserve the praise it gets in some quarters but it is well worth the try."
""
"Overall: Disappointing. I was excited an curious about this beer, but it fails to deliver. It's only the second beer from the Lips of Faith series that I've tried, but they've both been below average (the other one was Biere de Mars). Surprising, as I really like New Belgium's other beers. Anyway, this beer just doesn't taste like beer. It seems like an experiment gone wrong. The spices are nice, but given the strong spices, you'd need an equally robust beer to support them."

"I had this on a recent visit to Todd English Pub in Las Vegas. I wasn't a huge fan of it. I found the atypical to beer elements to be too overpowering for the beer itself. I'm probably not the best person so listen to, as I see lots of good reviews but I could barely finish mine."
"A smooth medium body, likewise for the carbonation, this is quite tasty and would have been even better to sip on in the middle of Winter. Good stuff."
"O: The chile beer style is not easy to get right, but I think New Belgium has done a good job with this beer."
"(Overall) One of the best LOF creations I have had yet. Seek it out! 4"

"This was shared with a few mates at a tasting party. We all came to the same conclusion...it wasn't worth finishing our glasses. The remainder of the beer was poured down the sink. I rarely dispose of mediocre beer. But, I couldn't bring myself to finishing this one. Very disappointed."
"B-"
"Overall: digging the lightly spiced kick finish, would drink again!"
""
"My experience with chile beers is quite minimal, and I did not know New Belgium was producing this one until I saw it at a local pub last night and had it first thing. The beer poured nice and dark and had a nice head that dissipated soon. The aroma was fantastic, lots of roasted chocolate and spice came through as well as some cinnamon. The mouth feel was good, a little thin but not in a watery way, more of a pleasant lightness. The taste was absolutely excellent. Lots of roasted chocolate malt comes through (and I emphasize the roasted), as well as lots of chili. The flavor sticks around and some more hints of chilies come out in the aftertaste. And to top it all, the beer improved as it warmed a little. Definitely captures the mole character without any single element overpowering any other. An excellent surprise for a Tuesday evening."
"Overall, I really like this. It's a nice blend of chocolate, cinnamon and chili spice. It has good heat, but is not the standard chili beer."
"O: This is a nice, complex beer; it captures mole sauce but doesn't overpower or overwhelm, making it quite drinkable and the fact that the alcohol is well masked helps"
""

"This may not be the most amazing beer by any stretch but it's quite fun and enjoyable, that I must say."

"This beer poured a medium bodied chestnut brown with amber highlights and a one finger soapy off white head. The nose features slightly sweet dark malts, toffee, light chocolate, cinnamon, and finishes with a slight pepper spice. I would prefer more pepper in the nose but it's decent. The flavors consist of a lot of dark malty sweetness, cinnamon, nutmeg, light cocoa, with ever so slight peppery spice. It's a little sweet and because of the spice profile with chocolate, kind of reminds me of the Midnight Sun's chocolate pumpkin porter, yet with a peppery spice. It's ok, I just wish there was more pepper, like a lot more. It drinks lighter than it poured and lighter than it looked. It's ok, I expected more, especially with high reviews."
""
""
""
"I love spicy foods. This beer is lovable for that reason. What I did NOT expect, however, was the baked goodies savory flavor. A guilty dessert without the multiple spoons of sugar. Probably the best chile beer I've had to date. 4.0"
"Much lighter than expected; hardly any booze detected. Could have used a little more rich chocolate malt to balance the spice, although the cocoa really emerged as this beer warmed. Very nice!"
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very unique combination of flavors but everything really comes together nicely. I really like the head level on this one."
"Overall: An okay beer, definitely interesting, but I wouldn't drink more than four ounces of it."
""
"Sweetness fades to spices which fade to light bitterness which becomes chile spice. Very complex and fairly well-balanced trip of a beer. Never had anything like this. It's rather approachable, and the residual heat makes me want to cool my mouth down with another sip! Would never drink this on a regular basis but it's a fun spiced beer that is decently well put together."
"Overall, a great brew and in par with the LOF series. Best chile beer I ever had."

"A unique take on chilies and chocolate. I've had many chocolate chili stouts but this is an entirely different approach. It's a well done chili beer that's worth a try. I think I'll be buying another soon. "
"O: Overall I think it is a fairly interesting brew. I like the cocoa nibs, but the chillies seem a little one note. Something new, but not something I would buy again. It would be interesting to cook with."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Was thinking more of a Chocolate Stout when I approached this, but this is very much a Chile beer. Hot peppers with a little cocoa powder to add depth, but no sweetness to cut the burn. Very spice driven, unusual flavor profile, thin; but glad to have a little diversity."
"I will probably try this once more to see if the other bottle is fresher. Interesting taste and aroma, but weak mouthfeel and appearance put me off."
""
"I was surprised to find that chili beers are a great change of pace. My favorite Mexican dish is chicken mole enchiladas so I really enjoyed this one. Hotter than Samual Adams chili bock but not nearly as hot as Sigda's from Coopersmiths. New Belgium concocted a recipe that incorporates a traditional Mexican flavor into an awesome ale. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is like no other beer I've had before. The sweet and spicy work really well together. But if you are not a fan of spicy beers, then you should skip this one. I'm really enjoying it. I wish I had a few more bottles."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting beer, no doubt, but I would greatly prefer the smoked chile flavors to be handled with greater subtlety"
""
"Taste is more chile forward, providing a tingle and mild heat that lingers on the palate into the aftertaste, balancing the front end chocolate sweetness. Medium bodied and creamy, well suited to the spicy chocolate flavors. Overall a pleasant and balanced beer that was easily shared. The chile heat is a little tame, especially in recent comparison to a similar local chile beer, End of Days from Pipeworks."
"Very interesting beer. I'd definitely order this again."
"Overall - I might have gotten a bad bottle, but this beer didn't live up to expectations. Not even close. Surprised given all of the other high ratings here. I might try on another occasion, but doubtful."
"o- glad i tried this one. unique beer at a great price."
""
"O - fantastic and unique take on the chili beer. balanced between sweet/dry with obvious spice notes that are bright, without overpowering the beer. i am curious if the squash flavors that i am tasting comes from one of the peppers or if it is just the combination of all the ingredients. check this one out fo sho!"
""
"Darker color with mocha head. Minimal lacing. Very aromatic beer, with bitter chocolate, and some spice that I could not place. Had a decent alcohol bite, but the chocolate flavor was very apparent. I did not realize it was a chile beer until I started this reveiw. The gals I was with enjoyed this more than I did. I like the chocolate, but the alcohols at the back end were a little excessive- might have been the chile kick."
""
""
"Cocoa Mole is one of the most unique beers I’ve tried in a while. Very interesting, and pretty tasty."

"Despite my inclination to dislike this beer, I kinda like it. This is a salsa beer, but in the best way. I actually like heat in a beer! It's not overpowering, but it's there. Take a hint Ballast Point, be more subtle! Not something I'd like more than a couple times a year, this is definitely a good beer and worth trying. Now if we can get New Belgium to make horchata..."
""
"D ~ Well Done! This really is one of the best Chile beers I have ever had. The expression of Chiles melds so well with the Cocoa & parallels the light cinnamon notes. Highly recommend. This outshined Chocolate Sombrero, & Clown Shoes is one of my favorite breweries."
"alcohol is well hidden"
"O - I couldn't resist trying this beer when I saw it on draft because I love spice and this is the number one beer of the style on this site. The flavors and aroma are powerful, but never out of hand. The spices really come out as it warms. If I see this beer again, I will definitely get it. Very different from other beers, but suits my tastes well and the high ABV is hidden."
"O: Really enjoyable and drinkable (surprisingly), the alcohol stays underneath and the adjuncts are really flavorful and not overwhelming. The base beer seems to be an lighter in body (though still 9% abv) and that makes this beer unique and drinkable."
"A super-dark, creamy beer with a moderate amount of dark foam. The aroma had bits of cocoa and toffee mixing in with a small amount of chille. The taste is where the spice comes out. The dark malty flavors appear first, them the chille starts to come out and gradually build as you drink to the point it is the dominant flavor. It's below jalapino for heat intensity. While it's good in small doses it was somewhat difficult to go through a whole bomber. Along with the cost it would be nice to have these available in regualr of half bottles."
""
"Pours a strange dark brown but see through like soda. Had a strange carbonation fizz that went away instantly leaving no head at all and no carbonation bubbles at all. The smell is of cinnamon and all spice, reminds me of an apple pie a lot. No cocoa smell at all. After a minor spillage incident we will get to the tasting. Very harsh on the tongue, and by that I mean the carbonation bubbles are very intense and unpleasant. Like the smell the taste is a lot like cinnamon and other spices but in an unflattering way. This might be my least favorite of the lips of faith series and may not be finishable. The mouthfeel is very light and unpleasant. I apologize for giving this beer such a bad review but I think there was a lot to be desired after drinking this beer."
"A very nice beer, definitely brings some heat from the peppers but doesn't become too hot and maintains a nice balance with the cocoa."
""
"O: I love beer, and I love hot food, but I'm not so sure about combining the two. Still, it's a complex, interesting experiment that's well worth a shot. Good stuff."

""
""
"O: An amazing beer. Great cold straight out of the tap or warm after some time sitting. The hype is real on this one. Easily the best Chile Beer I've had although it seems to fall into another style. New Belgium really knows how to brew these ""Lips of Faith"" beers. I would without hesitation order this again."
""
"I’ll have another."
"O – This beer truly delivers what’s advertised; a mole infused beer. Milder chocolate and more chile heat than other “chocolate chili beers” that seem all the rage lately. For those not familiar with mole, this one may be a little brash and “hot”. For those who enjoy mole like myself, I would say you might find this beer a treat. I’m getting this again."
"O: It's kind of like drinking a chocolate covered chili pepper with some cinnamon on the top. I'm not too into chile beers but this one is pretty tasty"
""
""
""
"Note: Guajillo and ancho chiles used, no cayenne. I wasn’t entirely off."
"I enjoyed this, one of the better chile beers I've tried & one of the better Lips offerings I had as well"
"Very interesting beer. I'm a fan of this trend with chocolate beers that aren't stouts. You taste the actual chocolate more as opposed to roasted malts. The peppers don't seem to add much flavor, just heat, which isn't so exciting...still good though."
"Overall, I enjoyed this more as it warmed up and the chiles really came through. Goes perfectly with green chile burgers."
""
""
"If anything, I would re-brew this one with even more chile flavor, and I would make sure that bouquet was really seeping out of the glass. The cinnamon and cocoa are just right in my opinion, now just make it even more fun with a bigger impression of chilies. Enjoy!"
"O - Overall this is exceptional for the style. The ABV is masterfully hidden and one cannot dismiss the controlled complexity in this beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good for such a beer. I really like the sneakiness of the heat. The flavor is robust but not overwhelming. Dig it."
"As the beer warmed, the cocoa notes became a bit more evident as did the heat from the chiles used. I picked up on more of the maltiness and less of the subtlies like the smoke flavors."
"Pours a clear but ugly dark amber color topped with a somewhat frothy tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of chalky chocolate and cinnamon dominate the nose. First sip is just what the aroma predicted except with a tad less chocolate. There is a splash of some dark fruits present too but let there be no mistake the cinnamon and spice dominate the flavor. Mouthfeel is quite good as carbonation is spot on though the body falls easily on the thin side. The 9% ABV is super well hidden. Not bad…not great either."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a deep garnet brown amber. One finger light brown head that slowly dissipates into a film and ring around the glas. Slight lacing. Aroma of Mexican chocolate, spicy and aromatic and very faint malt. Flavor is excellent, a blend of chocolate, cinnamon, and dark malt with the chili hotness slowly building up to a hot, spicy, roasty, sweet malt and chocolate finish. Wow. Medium bodied with constant carbonation. The flavor progression and balance of flavor element is very well done. The Mexican chocolate flavor is spot-on. This is the best chili beer I've tasted."
"Despite the heavy flavor constituents and high ABV, this is a pretty light, easy drinking brew -- it actually leaves me wishing it drank a bit more like thick Mexican hot chocolate, but it's still delicious and enjoyable."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a very good beer, they really managed to bring all the flavors together in it. I don't typically think peppers work that well in beer, but in this one they did. A lot of bold flavors and ingredients in it, but they came together very well. I really liked the uniqueness to it as well. Very well done beer overall."
"This is awesome and would pair well with pork, barbecue, etc. I may have to pick up some more of this..."
""
"Pours a cherry hued brown with little foam formation and no lace. The nose on this beer is insane, probably in my top five noses. cinnamon, cocoa, chili, sugar, coffee (just the slightest), grain, malt; these come together and honestly remind me of cinnamon toast crunch cereal - fucking awesome. Great cinnamon and cereal flavor with a good sharp burn at the rear of the palate. Really dig this beer. I'm worried about it's aging potential, so I'm drinking the shit out of it while I can. Medium bodied with prickly carb and an off dry finish. Really hope this becomes an annual release, they really hit it out of the park here."

"D: this is a very unique brew, however this one isnt for me. chilies and chocolate make for a lot of flavor that is a too much for me. glad i tried, but on to the next LOF for this guy."
"O: Not a bad beer by any means, but I think this would have been much better as a chocolate and spice beer with a bit of chile pepper rather than a beer that ends up focusing far too heavily on the chile."
"O - This is a very good chilie beer. I really like the roastiness to balance the chilies."
""
""
"O: The creativity works for this one. This is what I had expected from Dogfish Head's Theobroma. Where Dogfish Head approximated a recipe analyzed from clay pots, New Belgium instead delivered what may have been the common ideal of a beer brewed with cocoa, chillies, and other assorted spices. Nicely done; certainly worth revisiting."
"O: The best beer from the Lips of Faith collection I've had. Maybe some added spiciness would improve it a little and cut down on the sweetness."
""
""
"A - Dark brown with some reddish highlights. Minimal head quickly fades leaving sparse lacing. S - Strong aromas of cinnamon and chiles with some dark fruit and a hint of chocolate. T - Flavors of cinnamon and other spices. Nice chile flavor throughout which lingers. Minimal hops presence. M - A little thin with a generous carbonation. A nice smelling and tasting beer. Perhaps more body and less carbonation. Definitely recommend."

"Well done NB, and 1st beer back since the crash!"

"The pour is almost mahogany in color with a khaki colored head. A really enjoyable spice aroma. Lots of cinnamon and peppers (though to a lesser degree). The chocolate is pronounced and gives a nice sweetness. Some serious raisin and plum character, too. Pleasantly sweet in terms of the flavor. Lots of chocolate and fruit notes with a sweet bready quality. Good spice and pepper flavor with a subtle earthiness. Really well done all around."
"I have to say, this is one of the best of the Lips of Faith series. Complex, spicy, drinkable and, most of all, extremely tasty. Fantastic beer."
""
""
"It basically does everything right. I'd put this one up there with Eric's Ale and Le Terroir as a healthy and fun surprise from New Belgium in their Lips of Faith series of releases. I'll be picking up more before they're gone!"
"M + D: This is a delicious beer, with a very fine-tuned balance that makes it a pleasure to drink. The body has a smooth creaminess that complements the flavours quite nicely, and the spicy finish rounds that out very well. This is certainly a beer I will be returning to."
""
"A really wonderful beer. I'm not a huge fan of chile beers since so many of them are unbalanced, with heat and not much else. This one is dubbed as a mole, and I have to say, it truly does taste like a mole. You get a nicely balanced melange of flavors, with some nice ancho chile, cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, and some black pepper, along with some moderate malty sweetness. The nose is more cinnamon and chile with a hint of sweetness. The spice level is just right- to start with, it's a warming roasty heat, rather than a sharp, biting spice. Using the right kind of chiles helps. Here there are ancho, guajillo, and chipotle, so you get a warm, fruity, smokiness with moderate heat, not the sort of bright fruity heat of habaneros or the sharp herbalness and spice if jalapenos or birds eyes. The rounded fruitiness and roasty notes here blend very well with the other flavors and presents a lovely, integrated whole with the heat slowly building to a pleasant tingling, and the spice and vanilla notes echoing in the background after the base has been built by the chocolate and malt. The best Lips of Faith offering I've had in a while. Very nice indeed."
""
"Mouthfeel on this one is nice, carbonation is right there at a moderate level and the body is right on the boarder of medium/full, leaning more towards medium. All in all this is a great beer! The alcohol is WELL hidden within the mixture of chocolate and chile. Drinkability would seem high because the alcohol isn't present, but the flavor is so potent that I can't imagine anyone wanting to slam these down. Excellent beer."
""
"O: This was one of the most memorable beers I've tasted in the last year or so. No flaws and not a trace of booze detected. I WILL try this beer again in the future... many more times."
"Strong aroma has an overtone of cinnamon, plus fruity and cocoa notes and hints of malt and cloves. It pours a dark, warm, slightly hazy brown with a decent light tan head that leaves some good lacing. Flavor has a malty core and cinnamon, earthy, chocolate and - whoa! - hot spice notes. Smooth texture is a little creamy and fairly fizzy with needle-like stabs from the hot pepper and a powdery hint. A distinctive and unique brew that is most worthy if you like variety in your beers!"
"O- This is a great beer that I find easy to drink, but I could see how the pepper heat could be a turn-off for some. I would compare this to something like a chocolate covered jalapeno, but not as hot. This has a great kick from the peppers but the taste is not driven by the peppers. Definitely will stock up on this."
""
""
""
"O - New Belgium has created one of the most unique and memorable beers I've had in quite a while. Cocoa Molé captures the essence of ""chili beer"" almost perfectly. There isn't much, if anything at all, I'd change about this beer. From it's adorable sugar skulls through the completely hidden alcohol punch and sneaky spice heat to the smooth, supple chocolaty body, Cocoa Molé is a dangerously drinkable beer capable of incapacitating the burliest of men."
""
"This beer may very well ruin whatever meal you're eating it with, but it's an odd delicacy on its own. Sweet, spicy and smooth enough that you'll forget it's 9% ABV."
"Quite enjoyable - esp as a after dinner valentines treat. Wouldn't drink it every day. Unique, better than other spiced beers that I've had."
"Overall: Cocoa Mole is fairly good for a chile beer which can, if particularly one-note-ish (or even vaguely reminiscent of the nightmare-inducing Cave Creek Chili Beer), have a very limited appeal for me. So, again, good job, NB."
"Wondering what to drink for Day of the Dead? 22 oz bottle from Olive Tree in Ocean Beach."

""
""

"T: A bit sweet and smooth upfront with some dark chocolate and a bit of earthiness. Then the peppers hit, but the taste never gets overwhelmingly hot. Leaves a lingering warmth on the tongue and a bit of a dryness on the finish. Biggest complaint is the thin mouthfeel. A great experiment and a pretty awesome result."
"I was actually a little bit disappointed with this beer from all the hype that I herd surrounding it. Brown and not as dark as I would have liked or expected with a tan head that quickly disappears. Smell gives off a lot of spice and some cocoa, mainly chile peppers actually quite pungent. The taste starts off full and a bit of a chocolaty malt but quickly is overshadowed by the spices. The spices are too overpowering and the balance between spices and chocolate are not very complementing, finished with a bit of cinnamon. Usually like spicy food but this beer was not for me. I guess I am more of a hop head in the making but I think that this beer is certainly different and worth trying. Others who I shared it with really liked it."
"Beer is light in body, dry on the finish, all of the chili flavor comes in the finish, it is mildly hot, the forward of the beer almost tastes like chai with a little clove and a lot of cinnamon flavors, it was fine but I won't have it again."
"Pours a dark brownish-purple with hints of ruby red. Medium-small, off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is immediately packed with chile and bell-pepper. Sweet chocolate and dark malts as well. Taste is VERY interesting. A lot of different spices...cinnamon, cumin, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Very nice chile flavor with a good amount of spicy heat. As the beer warms and the more sips I take, the more heat I get. Finishes with sweet cinnamon and cocoa. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and spicy. Drinkability is fairly high if you can handle the heat. Overall, this is a very good chile beer."
""
"Overall, this is pretty damn delicious and the pepper integration is lovely. Great non pepper spices are used to evenly match the spicy pepper attributes. Nice."
"Found this a bit overwhelming. A snifter pour is a good serving size, anything else is masochism!"
""
"Outside of the pepper heat, the body is light, and it feels like a brown ale plus peppers."
"22oz bottle $8.49. Dark brown color with a minimal head, looks red up against the light. Smells pretty good like cinnamon mostly and a hint of cocoa. Tastes like cocoa, cinnamon, and has the slightest bit of heat from the peppers, spicy. The alcohol was pretty well hidden but maybe that is the peppers masking it. This was a pretty nice beer overall."
"sensational and different! pours a brown ale color with some good bubbling. smells outrageous. tons of cocoa powder in the nose, bits of cinnamon, and some smoked pepper vibe, pablano maybe. flavor is so balanced. cocoa powder up front, not sweet at all. then comes a little heat, but not in your face, ancho the bottle says would account for that smokey thing. good caramel and chocolate malt sweetness and richness. pleasant mouthfeel, works with this beer. medium bodied to fuller bodied, and a mildly spicy booze laced finish, especially as it warms up here. the cocoa is what is memorable for me here, i like this one a whole lot. way above my expectations!"
"Overall - Interesting beer! I would love to grab another few of these for Cinco de Mayo."
""
"The Lips Of Faith series rarely disappoints, and this is another wonderful addition to their canon."

"O: A good beer overall, that definitely reminds me of a mole sauce. It has a good amount of heat, though I could wish for more cocoa presence. Still, it's unique and tasty."
"O: for what it is, this is an extremely well executed beer. It captures the Mexican culture, not only in the cool label art, but also in the balance of flavors. I am a big fan of mole and have tried other mole inspired beers and have been disappointed (see New Holland Mole Ocho)... this one has great balance and really works with that sweet and spicy combo. Well done New Belgium."
"overall it was a very well made chile beer. the spice was there but didnt steal the show and didnt make it unenjoyable"
""
""
"This is definitely a unique beer and, whereas I wouldn't be opposed to having another some time in the future, I wouldn't seek it out ever again. This is for sharing and sipping as the lingering spice can be quite unappealing at times. Different but not necessarily in a good way..."
"This is the most interesting of the Lips of Faith beers I have had.Poured a deep mahogany brown with a thin tannish colored head atop.Smells of chocolate,vanilla bean,and cinnamon,to me like Mexican hot chocolate,really cool.A bunch of stuff going on on the palate with chocolate being predominant as well vanilla,cinnamon and chili comes into play at the back end providing a slow burn.A little light in the mouth but thats the only small drawback to the beer,it's the most interesting take on a chile beer I have had."
"IMO, this beer tastes exactly how it smells. It's a beautiful change to my everyday choices. I highly recommend Cocoa Mole for anyone that is up for something ""different"". I kinda don't want to finish this beer, i just want to keep smelling the beautiful aroma."
"Overall I though this was a very good chili beer, but not as good as some other chocolate chili beers I've had such as the Reunion and Vixen."

"(additionally, just for the sake of information, i followed this up with a terrapin 2010 gamma ray, also on tap at the busy bee, and it was probably the best/most unique 1-2 punch i've had in some time, if not ever.)"

"O - A wonderfully unique beer that certainly evokes it's namesake. I'd love to see this become a yearly release, it's that good."
"A unique, interesting, awesome chile beer. I'd recommend drinking this one fresh, as the chiles are vibrant and flavorful, though not overpowering or truly spicy in a classic sense."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Random streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of cinnamon and other spices and Mexican hot chocolate. Absolutely fantastic smelling. Taste is of cinnamon and other spices, cocoa powder, and some slight chile flavors. There is a slight warming in the back of the throat from the chili after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer taste wise but exceptional in the smell."

"3.5/4/4.5/4/3.5"
"O: I bought one to lay down for a while and see what happens. For me to enjoy this beer more the sweetness and cinnamon character need to tone down a bit. I'm hoping some age will accomplish this. I would say this is a sweeter, less refined and sloppier Vertical Epic. I didn't hate this beer and I didn't love it...it just kind of lands in the middle somewhere for me. For $9 a bomber it's not terribly expensive and I am curious to see what 6 months to a year will do for the one in my cellar. An interesting brew...."
"This is an intricate, complex beer. The flavors are unique and enjoyable. The ABV is big but it's still drinkable. If you enjoy cocoa and spices, you'll love this."
"Definitely worth a try."
"D- good drinkability if your a fan of peppers. If not it might not be for you. This would be one hell of a food beer."
"Easily my favorite chili beer so far. Most that I've tasted had serious issues balancing the elements- too much spice, not enough bitterness, other adjuncts that clash with the chili flavor, etc. This one seems to hit all the marks, though, with its complexity and harmony."
""
"Dark ruby color with a fine, filmy head and a slim, creamy ring around the edges. Spotty lace. Warm cinnamon is prominent in the aroma…very much like apple crisp with increasing chocolate as it warms and only a faint hint of chilies. Cocoa, caramel, and spice are brought together in a smooth blend of flavors. Sweet, but not too sweet, vanilla and peppers providing some heat in the finish. Pretty damn tasty! Medium bodied and warming with fine carbonation. Very nice…"
"Flavor is a bit one-dimensional up front with brown, sweet malts leading the way alongside a hint of cinnamon. However, the finish more than makes up for it as a lingering pepper heat sinks in and delivers a capsaicin ""pop"" that simmers on the back of the palate long after each sip. The heat isn't over-powering, though, as it balances out nicely the initial sweet/spicy flavors. Alcohol presence becomes more notable as Cocoa Mole warms. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and not too heavy, making this beer quite drinkable considering all that's going on inside it. Another solid Lips of Faith release from New Belgium--this one is worth seeking out."

"Poured from updated bomber to NBB globe glass. The beer pours a thick amber brown with orange amber highlights when held to the light. A thick 1.5 finger cream color head with decent retention. Some lacing throughout. The aroma is very unique: cinnamon mixed with hints of chocolate and some pepper. Smells like my grandmother's cinnamon sugar cookies actually with some cocoa sprinkled in. The flavor is very much the same with an initial rush of sharp cinnamon immediately followed by the cocoa and caramel flavors. Mild bitterness. The peppers are most noticeable on the finish as you feel a little heat and a slight burn. Suddenly the heat fades and the cinnamon again mixes in. Quite complex and yet fairly smooth. Full bodied. Hides the alcohol well, I think most of the heat character is from the peppers. Overall, very happy to have tried it. Not a beer you'd want to pound all day but I enjoyed it. Would purchase again. It's nice that the chili isn't overwhelming as is often the case with so many brews made with chili, it settles in nicely with the cocoa, cinnamon, and caramel malts."
