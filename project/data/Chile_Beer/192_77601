2.92,-26.6,3,2.75,3,2.75,3,"Overall: I am big into large Chile stouts now, though I will not purchase this again. It is too thin and lacks flavor. The Chile and chocolate are there, as is a caramel sweetness in first sip. There is nothing to compliment these flavors, which bodes I'll for a larger (8% or so, and above) beer. It is too thin and their is no bold roasted dark grain flavor. Tasted more like a low IBU amber with chocolate and Chile flavors, which I would not of purchased.","johnnybgood1999","Friday at 07:50 PM"

Taste is a letdown in that whatever cocoa is there (and it's not much) is quickly overcome by the chile.  It starts with the flavor found in the skin if dried chile and finishes with spice, again not subtle.  It actually packs some heat.  Body is a bit thin, and the alcohol too is covered up by pepper.

Aroma hits you hard with scents of cinnamon, roses, and some weird, yet intriguing other aroma that I just cant figure out. Taste is very bold like the nose. Touches of wet cinnamon and allspice are definitely present and their is a slight burn that I would guess is a combination of the alcohol and the ancho, guajillo and chipotle peppers. The heat is not overbearing, but you tend to get more of it on the front end than the back. I am getting very little cocoa out of this. This beer is full of all kinds of mild to moderate spice and the mouthfeel is a little less than I would have expected after the first taste. Hard to tell how the balance is because of everything that is going on, but overall, this is the most unique beer I have had. A sipper, slow and steady, lol.","hophugger","Mar 15, 2015"

Nice lacing. Aromas of cinnamon, cocoa powder with hints of pepper spices.  A little worried at the first sip that it might be awful.  However, I am glad the aromas were misleading.  Tastes of cocoa with a slight hint of roasted chilies.  Cinnamon and vanilla. Rich dark roasted malts as well.  The back end is mainly dark roasted malts with cocoa with the roasted chilies.  Finishes both sweet and spicy.  Great chile beer.","uvachief","Mar 09, 2015"

(yes, the perfect pairing!) I got to meet many of their Brewers and spent most of a Friday sampling oddities along with Felix and Oscar from their oak foeders. The new release is still great! It pours a dark brown with red highlights. Great medium brown lacing. The aroma is chocolate, cinnamon, smoke and malt. The taste is very balanced and dry with a hint of vanilla. Very little heat. The chipotle peppers contribute smoke and the cinnamon punches up the round maltiness. Mouth feel is perfect, between a dry and oatmeal stout. There is a bread-like character to this beer. However, it doesn't scream Fat Tire yeast like some of their other brews like Ranger ect. Very little hop character. Bitterness seems to come more from the cinnamon than the hops. But my guess is it's hopped with low alpha english hops. The beer was out of production for several years. It tastes as good as I remember. I highly recommend it. I've attempted to recreate it on a home brew scale, but I always miss it slightly! Thank you, New Belgium, for bringing it back!","sb3000","Feb 25, 2015"

4.32,8.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, bottled on 1/29/2015. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, cherry, plum, fig, date, caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, toast, cinnamon, chile pepper, and herbal/spice earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark fruit, dark/bready malt and chili/spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, toast, cinnamon, chile pepper, and herbal/spice earthiness. Some light roast/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown sugar, cinnamon, chile pepper, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a while. Chile pepper heat builds up as you finish the glass, but doesn’t get overbearing. Fantastic complexity and robustness of dark fruit, dark/bready malt, and chile/spice flavors; with a great dark fruit/malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic chile spiced beer. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark fruit, dark/bready malt, and chile/spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the the ABV with the moderate heat from the peppers. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 21, 2015"

The malts are nice as well, caramel mocha molasses, toasty bread crumbs, coffee cake, etc. I wasn't a huge fan of the cocoa as it tasted more like Swiss Miss hot cocoa powder rather than cocoa nibs and dark chocolate kinda taste. The cinnamon and other spices are interesting and a nice addition but I wish the cinnamon in particular was a little toned down. The lack of carbonation is probably the only real gripe I have. However, those are nit picking as this was a pretty good beer all around.","jlindros","Jan 12, 2013"

The one finger of khaki-colored head was only so-so but it did leave lacing in scattered streaks. The aroma was rather faint for what ended up being a highly flavorful brew. I smelled mostly caramel, chocolate and candi sugar. The flavors were outstanding. I tasted chocolate, fruity esters, toffee, Belgian candi sugar, light red pepper and spicy capsicum notes as well as a touch of bubblegum. Well balanced and not overly spicy while still managing to hide the 9% ALC very well. The mouthfeel was frothy, the body medium and the carbonation delicate.

Good platform for the interplay between chocolate and spice. Love the chili, I'm not usually a fan of chili beers but this is fantastic. I think they used dried chili which gives it a sort of sweet, grassy, almost herbal flavor up front and a slightly harsh heat in the back. Not too hot though, and the caramel and chocolate malts even it out. Obscenely drinkable for the style and for the ABV.","dirtyskunk","Jun 11, 2012"

There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is mostly sweet, it smells like chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, and some chile peppers. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like chocolate, chile peppers, cinnamon, caramel, and a little bit of coffee. There's a good lingering spicy finish, and the pepper flavor is much stronger in this brew than I expected it to be considering the aroma isn't very spicy. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and coating, but it also seems somewhat thin at times. Moderate carbonation.

It's a little sweet and because of the spice profile with chocolate, kind of reminds me of the Midnight Sun's chocolate pumpkin porter, yet with a peppery spice.

This one is dubbed as a mole, and I have to say, it truly does taste like a mole. You get a nicely balanced melange of flavors, with some nice ancho chile, cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, and some black pepper, along with some moderate malty sweetness. The nose is more cinnamon and chile with a hint of sweetness. The spice level is just right- to start with, it's a warming roasty heat, rather than a sharp, biting spice. Using the right kind of chiles helps. Here there are ancho, guajillo, and chipotle, so you get a warm, fruity, smokiness with moderate heat, not the sort of bright fruity heat of habaneros or the sharp herbalness and spice if jalapenos or birds eyes. The rounded fruitiness and roasty notes here blend very well with the other flavors and presents a lovely, integrated whole with the heat slowly building to a pleasant tingling, and the spice and vanilla notes echoing in the background after the base has been built by the chocolate and malt. The best Lips of Faith offering I've had in a while. Very nice indeed.","Georgiabeer","Feb 19, 2012"

3.42,-14.1,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"I was actually a little bit disappointed with this beer from all the hype that I herd surrounding it. Brown and not as dark as I would have liked or expected with a tan head that quickly disappears. Smell gives off a lot of spice and some cocoa, mainly chile peppers actually quite pungent. The taste starts off full and a bit of a chocolaty malt but quickly is overshadowed by the spices. The spices are too overpowering and the balance between spices and chocolate are not very complementing, finished with a bit of cinnamon. Usually like spicy food but this beer was not for me. I guess I am more of a hop head in the making but I think that this beer is certainly different and worth trying. Others who I shared it with really liked it.","TeHStalker","Feb 09, 2012"

3.97,-0.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark brownish-purple with hints of ruby red. Medium-small, off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is immediately packed with chile and bell-pepper. Sweet chocolate and dark malts as well. Taste is VERY interesting. A lot of different spices...cinnamon, cumin, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Very nice chile flavor with a good amount of spicy heat. As the beer warms and the more sips I take, the more heat I get. Finishes with sweet cinnamon and cocoa. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and spicy. Drinkability is fairly high if you can handle the heat. Overall, this is a very good chile beer.","DovaliHops","Feb 08, 2012"

Smell is of cinnamon and other spices and Mexican hot chocolate. Absolutely fantastic smelling. Taste is of cinnamon and other spices, cocoa powder, and some slight chile flavors. There is a slight warming in the back of the throat from the chili after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel.

I didn't hate this beer and I didn't love it...it just kind of lands in the middle somewhere for me.

4.14,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Dark ruby color with a fine, filmy head and a slim, creamy ring around the edges. Spotty lace. Warm cinnamon is prominent in the aroma…very much like apple crisp with increasing chocolate as it warms and only a faint hint of chilies. Cocoa, caramel, and spice are brought together in a smooth blend of flavors. Sweet, but not too sweet, vanilla and peppers providing some heat in the finish. Pretty damn tasty! Medium bodied and warming with fine carbonation. Very nice…","wedge","Jan 25, 2012"
4.14,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Flavor is a bit one-dimensional up front with brown, sweet malts leading the way alongside a hint of cinnamon. However, the finish more than makes up for it as a lingering pepper heat sinks in and delivers a capsaicin "pop" that simmers on the back of the palate long after each sip. The heat isn't over-powering, though, as it balances out nicely the initial sweet/spicy flavors. Alcohol presence becomes more notable as Cocoa Mole warms. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and not too heavy, making this beer quite drinkable considering all that's going on inside it. Another solid Lips of Faith release from New Belgium--this one is worth seeking out.","wagenvolks","Jan 25, 2012"

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from updated bomber to NBB globe glass. The beer pours a thick amber brown with orange amber highlights when held to the light. A thick 1.5 finger cream color head with decent retention. Some lacing throughout. The aroma is very unique: cinnamon mixed with hints of chocolate and some pepper. Smells like my grandmother's cinnamon sugar cookies actually with some cocoa sprinkled in. The flavor is very much the same with an initial rush of sharp cinnamon immediately followed by the cocoa and caramel flavors. Mild bitterness. The peppers are most noticeable on the finish as you feel a little heat and a slight burn. Suddenly the heat fades and the cinnamon again mixes in. Quite complex and yet fairly smooth. Full bodied. Hides the alcohol well, I think most of the heat character is from the peppers. Overall, very happy to have tried it. Not a beer you'd want to pound all day but I enjoyed it. Would purchase again. It's nice that the chili isn't overwhelming as is often the case with so many brews made with chili, it settles in nicely with the cocoa, cinnamon, and caramel malts.","hopfacebrew","Jan 20, 2012"
