4.5,16.6,,,,,,"	It's not how it looks, it's how it drives... An analogy I often apply to to choosing a bomber, but sometimes something is just too aesthetically intriguing to pass up, which is the case in point, and I ended up with the DFH's "Theobroma..." When I popped the cap, it seemed there was a fair amount of carbonation built up as the "pop" was mighty loud, but there was no foaming of any sort... It poured fairly light, with healthily active 2.5 inch head that's assisted by a decent amount of carbonation... It's a deep gold, almost orange, with quite a bit of sediment hanging about in there, but the beer itself isn't extremely hazy... The cocoa is the first aroma, but much lighter in presence than I had expected, as well as honey mixed amongst it also... A very light earthy, spicy bitterness hits the palate as the beer first enters your mouth, trailed by tastes that match the aromas... The cocoa isn't overbearing, and the beer is much more savory than I had assumed after pouring it... The finish is dry, but still very smooth as the ancho chilies give an amazing and extremely approachable amount of heat to the cocoa elements... The mouthfeel is great and acts as a fantastic platform to allow this beer to shine and accompanies each facet of the beer nicely... Overall this beer is surpassing my expectations on many levels, and I'm impressed at the amount of complexity this beer offers while still remaining extremely approachable to a variety of craft brew seekers... It's not how it looks, it's how it drives - and she drives quite nicely... Another great brew - Cheers!!","NSXAG","Nov 19, 2014"

3.5,-9.3,,,,,,"Theobroma pours a dazzling copper hue, but with very little head, indicating a minimal amount of carbonation. As other reviewers pointed out, the aroma is faint, however there is a bit of cocoa powder detectable in a whiff of it. The high malt flavor pairs well with the cocoa, and the chilies blend in a similar way with the sharpness of the finish and the alcohol heat. With a medium mouth feel, this can sneak up on you however. Overall, worth a try and best shared.","Neorebel","Sep 10, 2014"

The mouth is light and smooth, very sippable and enjoyable. The flavor is light and slightly European. There is a pleasant sweetness on the front and ancho heat on the tail. Still nothing present that I'd call chocolate. This is very good but nothing like id expect from the label. Dfh always keeps em good and interesting.","lochef81","Apr 22, 2014"

Theobroma is no exception and is my hands-down favorite offering from their Ancient Ales series (with Sah'Tea ranking as a close second). Furthermore, this also ranks highly on my list of all-time favorite beers. Even with almost 9 months of age, I absolutely love this beer. However, I will be anticipating its release in 2014 to experience this one fresh. 4.75","threeviews","Jan 25, 2014"

Taste was excellent really picked up the honey and the slight heat at the end. Didn't really pick up the cocoa but I think this is what was helping to give it a great balance in the flavor. Alcohol was very well hidden. Was very refreshing beer. And another example of the excellence of Dogfish Head.","JerUrbans","Jan 23, 2014"

The flavor was of sweetened fruits, annatto and a subtle chili flavor. The chilies did not come through in the taste as they did in the nose but what did was very tasty. Cocoa flavors did not come through but the end result is a blend that makes a world class beer. I wish there was a bit more "heat" but even without it is well balanced a wonderfully brewed beer. Drinks well now and should age well over the next couple of years. Overall outstanding. I will be putting some in the cellar.","Cervezaconcalor","Jan 20, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden amber color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of honey, toast, bread, cracker, orange, pear, apple, grape, nuttiness, herbal, floral, chile pepper, light cocoa, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and spice flavors; with good strength. Taste of honey, bread, cracker, orange, pear, apple, grape, toast, nuttiness, herbal, floral, light cocoa/chile pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light chile pepper heat on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, bread, cracker, pear, apple, grape, orange, herbal, floral, light nuttiness, light cocoa/chile pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick/creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice ancient ale style. All around nice balance of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV, A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 20, 2014"

It had a distinct chocolate flavor as you would expect with a subtle chili burn on the finish. The beer avoided being an overpowering bomb of chocolate although slightly sweet and malty the flavors were well balanced and hid the high alcohol content.

My favorite part is there is non-stop rapid moving bubbles from every inch of surface of the glass that rapidly ascend and push up on the descending sediment making a rolling, turbulent effect in the glass as the two interact. Very enticing and fun to watch. Nice fluffy white head too. Smell is mostly bread, honey and chiles for me. Taste has lots of yeast and sweet honey. Faint flavor of cocoa that lends itself well to the texture. Leaves some lingering chile heat. Mouthfeel is moderate, carbonation milder than expected. It has a silky quality that compliments the chocolate flavors. Overall, a superb easy-drinker, some new flavor combinations here that are worth checking out!","Samuel906","Dec 05, 2013"

It is a bronzed orange color; which was very unexpected and it had a nice 1/2-3/4" head with nice lacing. I loved the smell. It had a very spicy smell. I could smell the chilies. The chilies were also very apparent on first taste. At first I wasn't sure I liked the chili flavor but the subtle chocolate on the back end made it very nice. The spiciness also added to the mouthfeel of the beer. The tight carbonation with the spice of the chilies gave it a very zingy feel on the tongue which was surprising. Overall I think this beer was a big surprise from the pour to the finish, but it was a surprise I enjoyed.","general_staal","Aug 01, 2013"

It coulda made one helluva stout, but, hey, whatever. Somehow, this all worked together, and I think Calagione probably wants people to divide this thing as a digestif or something similar. This impressed me far more than Midas Touch, and I really hope to try others from this series. Pushes the boundaries of fermented barley beverages, as always.

For a beer with a lot of chocolate elements, I was not expecting a golden colored beer with a slight white head. Honey notes were the most prominent in the aroma, with noting else really jumping out. In the initial taste, one detects mild chocolate, grape, and a slight sweetness. After a few sips, the heat becomes a little more noticeable at the back of the throat. Ancho chilies hold a little more promise for me, but the heat was very mild. In the aftertaste, one detects a grapey taste almost like grape soda. With all of the elements of this beer, I was expecting something quite different.","JohnnyHopps","Feb 18, 2013"

Liquor is medium amber, a bit hazy (maybe the bottle had been a bit disturbed), with a fairly small head that falls apart quickly. No lacing at all. Lots of very small bubbles racing to the top. The nose is a complex yet balanced amalgam of chiles, earth, and bitter chocolate, which follows through to the palate. A slight honey character comes through midway through, with a nutty roastiness showing up as well. The finish is dry, with a cocoa and dried chile note. Although this seems like it should be muddled, it somehow manages to achieve a nearly perfect balance. The chile flavor is obvious, but there is only the subtlest hint of heat. This is an outstanding, if very difficult to categorize, beer. Surprisingly drinkable.","MCDuhamel","Feb 01, 2013"

Smell is rather flat; some of the sour yeast smell present in its sister brew, Sah'tea, is noticeable. Bitter cocoa over the malts, and perhaps a hint of twang from the peppers. Taste is sweet malts, cocoa and the taste pinches to a close at the back of the tongue where the chilies make their muted appearance. Not sure I'd notice them if I didn't know they were there.

I seem to remember it as much more pronounced but this was really pleasant. The chocolate seemed to get lost in the mix as I really did not perceive it until the extreme finish.

It's almost inspiring. The mesoamerican nobility must have been running around like crazy fools if they were gettin high on this stuff. It belongs in a snifter or narrow-mouthed tulip to concentrate the nuanced aroma and hell, quite frankly next time I'll treat it like scotch.

3.53,-8.5,3.5,3,3.5,5,3.5,"Overall: Dogfish is easily one of my personal favorite breweries, and the Ancient Ales series is a really interesting idea, so as a result I was very disappointed in this beer. I expected a lot and had been putting off trying it for some time while it wallowed in my fridge. Perhaps I built it up too much. Be that as it may, it is an above average beer. The chili aspect is superbly done, and the chocolate is not cloying by any means. All of the flavors and aromas are just too muted. Subtlety is nice when dealing with strong flavors such as chili and chocolate, but it can be taken too far. This beer is an example of where a little more bravado would have been welcomed. Perhaps a “crazy” brewer like Three Floyds, Brew Dog, Cigar City, or Mikkeller could have taken this idea further by putting everything over the top. Perhaps Southern Tier could have emulated this ancient style better with their impossibly accurate imitations. Whatever the case, this is a beer to try if you are into the style (chocolate-chili beer) or into Dogfish Head or into, more specifically, their Ancient Ales series. Otherwise, do not waste the money on this one. 14.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","Aug 31, 2012"

Spicy light fruit aroma. Nice medium bodied light fruits and spices, similar to a tripel. Nutty and semi-sweet. Reminiscent of a tripel in the middle and finish with the chiles lightly making themselves noticed. I tasted more pleasant malty tones as it warmed up. I liked the flavor and spicing.

4.15,7.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Medium sweet malt in the nose, along with earthy hops, light cocoa, a sweet eastern smelling spice (annatto?), and a light toastiness. Cocoa is very subtle in the taste and reminds me more of the powder than the nibs, and I find it best after I take a sip and breathe out very quickly. Also in the taste is some belgian yeastiness and a dry, medium-hot alcohol that I associate with brewing with honey since it ferments so completely. Speaking of dry, a little dry on the palate, but overall a fine experimental brew, though I can see why it may be too subtle for some (especially at $9-$15 / bottle depending where you shop/availablity)","tapman","Nov 23, 2011"

A slight malt presence at the front with a nice honey finish. Pretty disappointed in this one just based on the description from the bottle.

That said, it is stated on the bottle that this is a replication of a derived historical recipe. If the historical elements were reserved, it may be better to state that in the verbiage so that you expect it to be subtle. I am being nit-picky here, but from the text on the bottle to the taste in my mouth is a disconnect. Kinda like what Obama SAID he would do and what he is actually doing...but it isn't quite THAT extreme. This beer has some of the elements it professes to have, but they are subtle.","SkeeterHawk","Sep 20, 2011"

It's pretty full bodied, quite smooth and slick. The finish is a little slippery. It's not really sweet at all. It's pretty warming and a little resiny. There is something kind of malt liquorish going on early in the taste. There may be a little DMS in there as well. Bitterness comes at the end in the form of raw chocolate. It's pretty unusual.

I got a definite kick from the peppers, adding a slight heat to the beer. The cocoa was not sweet at all, but instead had a bittering effect, especially combined with some light hop tastes. A faint honey sweetness rounded the taste out evenly for a nice balance all the way through. Boozy in the aftertaste and feel, with a slight kick that combines nicely with the peppers. All told, its an interesting beer, very complex and tasty. Great to analyze and try to identify the flavors, but also nice to just sip on and enjoy.","chodinheaven","Sep 01, 2011"

Warming though brings out all the subtleties and richness that I would have come to expect. Cinnamon and vanilla and fighting it out to provide a hint of sweetness and character. Each sip seemingly more complex then the one before. It is literally just a bath in warm, malty flavors","mikesgroove","Aug 27, 2011"
3.03,-21.5,3.5,3,3,3,3,"This beer pours a dark, very cloudy and syrupy looking orange in color with a slight white head that quickly dissipated to lace my snifter. It features aromas of sweet malts, oranges, honey, sweet flowers, spices, herbs, mango?, and wit characteristics. It's pretty sweet on the nose. The chile and chocolate are non-existant. The flavors are very sweet and more on the fruited, imperial wit side of things. It is very fruity and malty. It has light floral, spice, and honey characteristics. It doesn't feature any chile or chocolate. It drinks thick and syrupy which is an odd fit. This beer at this point is misleading. I had fond memories of this one but I don't remember it being like this. Perhaps this one fades too much with age. Regardless, the artwork is still one of my all-time favorites.","aasher","Aug 26, 2011"

Alcohol is completely absent in the taste. Overall, this beer surprised me. I wasn't expecting to like it after reading the reviews, but it's unique, and fairly tasty. Almost reminds me of a braggot.

Turns out I was completely wrong and it poured out as a really vibrant orange color. I can only assume that this beer has more surprises in store for me. The smell of the beer had some earthy chocolate aromas coming off of it. I wasn't able to pick up much Chili pepper on the nose though. The taste of the beer gives off that same bitter earth chocolate note with just a hint of the pepper in the background. It's a very subtle chili beer, not one of those that is undrinkable because it's like drinking fire. The mouthfeel of this brew has a good thickness to it much like DfH's big bottles.

Instead I feel like I got pranked by having such good ingredients tossed into what to me is basically a lager. Really terrible match, really difficult to drink and enjoy.

Rather like Midas Touch in overall character with an every-so-faint hint of cacao in the nose and on the palate, Theobroma stands as an excellent brew and (assumedly) a nice re-creation of an ancient style, but could perhaps use some tweaking to bring out more of the cacao flavor and to differentiate it a bit from the brewery's more widely-available and sadly overly-similar offering, Midas Touch.","superdedooperboy","Jul 14, 2011"

Flavors of chili peppers, coco, honey, nutmeg, cinnamon, malt, coffee, and lime. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and crisp. It leaves a little drying on the back of my soft palate, maybe more like numbness. This beer is nothing like I have tasted before, and it really grows on you.

The nose is strange but fairly pleasant, showing mostly notes of honey, with faint traces of white chocolate and a spiciness similar to green cardamom. The taste delivers more cocoa flavor, again in the white chocolate spectrum. Honey flavor is appreciated, though the brew is not tremendously sweet. The pepper is not discernible in either aroma or flavor. As to the feel, it is just a tad under medium in heft and somewhat refreshing. Overall, this is an interesting brew and is easy enough to drink, but it is not some radical creation, nor a Chile Beer as far as I can taste; it is more like a Cream Ale with frills.","ktrillionaire","Jun 25, 2011"

Starts with the chili up front with a strong mix of flavor in the middle with some sweetness and a long chili finish. The mouthfeel is lighter, high carbonation, very smooth.

Light-bodied, not watery but goes down easy and smooth although there's a sharpness to the beer from strong carbonation. The honey balances the beer as there is a strong pepper, spicy taste, little smokey, as the chili peppers assert themselves. Touch of cocoa as well in the taste but not real noticeable; overall a good beer that pulls off a balancing act between dry and sweet so it's not too roasted/grainy or just a honey/chocolate beer...crisp finish and the ABV lends a dry touch on the finish.","clayrock81","Feb 21, 2011"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into snifter glass. Orange-amber hues stare at me from beneath a pithy blanket lined with lacy frills and shadowed by a soft haze. I am immediately enraptured by a massively aromatic nose of cacao, ginger, apricots, sugar syrup (the kind used in canned fruits), mangos, green bananas, ginger bread snaps, brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice, lavender and lilies. Woah. Green chilies tickle the back of my nose while all of her sugar, spice, and everything nice blends together in thirst-inducing harmony. I haven't supped yet, and somehow I just know that once more Sam and Dogfish Head have done it again. There is a steady undercurrent of honey sweetness throughout our session together which leaves bitter fruit skins in the back. My lips are sticky with apricot and mango juices while spice permeates the entirety of her palate. Each iota of flavor stands on her own, but each iota of flavor also shares a bed with allspice, cinnamon, and ginger. Heat and spice tickle the back of my throat for which I give thanks to the great and powerful ancho chilies. I was most leery of the addition of ancho chilies in this beer because chilies and beer are not usually the most harmonious of marriages. But in Theobroma she is a gentle whisper with just enough spicy heat in the recesses to remind me of her presence. Never once does she overwhelm and make my supping experience a painful one. Caramel mingles with honey sweetness while gingerbread cookies and ginger snaps pepper my breath. I am intrigued by the lack of apparent ABV heat; I get more warmth from the ancho chilies than I do the 9% ABV within. The chocolate is very subtle and seems to be quite happy weaving in and out of her tropical fruits, green apples, honey and caramel sweetness than she could be as the center of attention.

Flavours mix to represent exactly what the style would have you think; Chile Beer. Sparse bitterness in the finish. Good medium bodied, chewy mouthfeel. Interesting style, not one I think I'll find myself revisiting often, so drinkability isnt too high. Theres a certain spicy taste that will prohibit me from drinking too much of this beer.

3.78,-2.1,3.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,"From the bottle to a pint glass. Pours a slightly burnt orange/amber color with a small white head that quickly dissolves (even with a vigorous pour). The smell wasn't all that impressive to me, mainly spices, chilies, some kind of fruity smell, maybe a bit earthy, and a bit of cocoa. As it warmed it got slightly better but there wasn't much there for me. By smell alone I didn't think I would enjoy this one. Then I moved on to the taste which totally changed my mind of this beer. At first it was bitter but then got really sweet and finished smoothly. It's probably sweet because of the honey. Other taste include chilies, spices, fruits, kind of earthy, and more cocoa/chocolate in the taste which wasn't really apparent until it warmed up more. Slightly above average mouthfeel, kind of medium bodied. At 9% ABV it's a bit high but I couldn't even notice the alcohol in the smell or taste. Pretty drinkable overall but I'd probably only do one of these in a night. Overall I wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but I ended up liking it. I will probably try and pick up one more bottle of it.","dismal","Nov 22, 2010"

I walked away for a minute and low and behold, there it was! A rich chocolatey feel and taste in my mouth. After that it became much more prominent and together with the mead and vinous characteristics made for a pleasant drinking experience. As for the chilis, I could only taste the faintest whispers occasionally which was unfortunate because I was looking forward to a little spiciness. Not exactly the bewitching elixir I was hoping for to accompany Jonah Hex however the movie sucked anyway and at least the beer was interesting.

The amber color had turned a beautiful orange and upon tasting was hit with awsome honey and coco flavor. I was dissapointed with the chile which didnt come through.

This beer is a golden, mostly clear liquid. There's some carbonation, but no head. Actually, from a distance it looks like a mead. It certainly doesn't smell like one. It has a strange aroma that's not at all beer-like. It has the scent of grape juice (not sure where that comes from), spice, background honey, and alcohol. Earthy and spicy. The intent seems to be to showcase cocoa, but I didn't initially get it. However, after trying some unsweetened baking cocoa for reference, the cocoa character is completely obvious. It's present in every sip, and is really very pleasant. Well done. The chilies seem to take the place of hops, and give the beer slightly warm finish and an apparent dryness. Still, it's a strange set of flavors, and although it's good, I can't call it incredibly drinkable. A great experiment, though.","Suds","Nov 14, 2010"

The flavor is thick and malty with honey sweetness coating the tongue to begin and just a touch of chili in the finish for a little after burn that is only enough to really know that it is there.

But overall, there's just too much going on in this beer. The chili & cocoa are overcome by a hefty, green booze note and mineral graininess in the finish. Mouthfeel is overly carbonated, making the thick body schizophrenic in its consistency. Theobroma is certainly unique, but in the end it drinks like a poorly-crafted, cloyingly sweet Belgian strong ale whose spices aren't derived from the yeast.

It also is extremely smooth and has a nice burning in the back of the tongue and throat from the ancho chilies which by the way makes the beer in my opinion.

Starts with some honey sweetness and finishes with the ancho chilies; lingers with some spicy heat on the back of the tongue. For a cocoa-centric beer, the chocolate notes are hard to detect which is the largest disappointment about this brew. It's moderate in terms of body and carbonation, but strong in the booze. In rating the drinkability, I think it's important to take into account that this brew is a take on an ancient recipe.

I'm wondering what style of yeast they used. I really enjoy the taste. It displays a diversified spectrum of flavors. Figs come to my head, but I can also see some chocolate influence and I believe the pepper is really helping the taste balance. I enjoy spicy foods, but this style of spice is much more flavorful and mellow. It's a great balance. the aftertaste is nice and I don't taste a lot of alcohol.

It smelled like honey, smokey malts, chili and a hint of cocoa. It tasted light bodied, which was very unexpected. The cocoa was more pronounced in flavor than the chilis- the chili flavor really came out on the end of your tongue. Overall, it was like a flavorful light and crispy malt.

There's a light chili pepper note and an extremely faint shade of cocoa that I might be projecting given expectations. The flavor is unapologetically sweet. There's a blandly sweet honey note, a bit of chili pepper in the finish and not much else besides so-so malt. Mouthfeel is unfortunately oily and thick. There isn't much alcohol, for what it's worth.

Perhaps it was due to time in the bottle. There was no chocolate or cocoa taste. It was sweet but more like the sweetness similar belgian golden ales. the mouthfeel was highly carbonated but when served at the chilled state it was smooth and pleasant. I really like this beer.

This is followed by a noticable chili flavor that adds a very slight amount of heat. Kind of an odd flavoring but not terrible. The feel is moderate with prickly carbonation, sweet with a touch of heat from the anchos. The brew is interesting indeed.

The cocoa and chilis are evident in the flavor and aroma, but their effect is subtle. The chilis give it a spicy kick and a slight fruitiness that turns to a more vegetable-ly pepper-like note as it warms. The beer is a light color with a reddish hue from annato seeds.

I like extreme and big but between this and a beer like Sah'tea, wtf is Sam and company thinking. I do think outside the box when it comes to booze and flavor, recently Bocktown in the Burgh had Woodchuck cider on tap with chai tea that worked so well even after multiple beer heads hated on the creation. I was able to enjoy it, I love chai tea but this tastes like a continuous burn of chili powder cloying honey with bittering spices that should induce a coma. The other ingredients named on the label include honey, cocoa nibs, cocoa powder, ancho chilies and ground annatto. I've drank Midas Touch since the days of clear 750ml bottles, I love chateau however the fuck you pronounce that beer along with a tolerable admiration for Black and Blue and Red and White, but this is an abomination and I've heard to steer clear of the Sah'tea along with the recent big bottled Squall IPA. Pretty bad when your ex brewer who works at Otter Creek is brewing better Mud Bock than your current specialties. I must say I never thought I would taste a beer this bad from DFH, I loved the initial bottling of 90 Min with the guy hammering a nail into one of his nares. This brew opened up my eyes like never before, I can't believe it this beer sucks I can't put it into beautiful or poetic words, please never brew this rainforest creation ever again. BTW, is your palate dead how has this beer remained up in the ratings as a better brew from DFH. Believe me I vacationed at Rehoboth when I graduated school just to get closer to the source this is not the typical brew, but I don't feel I should water down their shortcomings. A cloying mess of a beer with sweet honey and burning chilies fuck that, I want good beer. I like Crazy Ed's Cave Creek Chili beer more than this pure shite.

In bottle its not too different but does have some noticeable difference. Pours a hazy copper-orange with white head that foams a bit then settles quickly. Aroma has some hints of the cocoa and is a bit fruity. The chile heat is in there too, seeming spicey especially when sniffed with on open mouth (as opposed to smelling with your mouth closed, look for the difference if you've never done it before). Flavor is quite complex with spice and a little bit of heat from the chilies, a small chocolate essence, some honey sweetness and a fruity body. All of the flavors are reserved, which allows all of them to be present though I can't help wonder what it would be like if any one were a bit stronger. This is, in a way, respectable as DFH often maintains an organic feel to their flavors. The mouthfeel is quite interesting as the slightest bit of heat lingers after each sip. Other than that its got what is sort of a typical dogfish body, mouthfeel, and drinkability. Certainly complex and interesting, though I think some (SOME) may be a bit disappointed to find that with all the crazy anticipation one may build upon reading the ingredient list and the beer's background, it doesn't taste THAT crazy or out there.

This brew is overly sessionable, very easy to get down and has the right stuff to keep me wondering throughout the whole beer. If this wasn't $12.99 I would make this a regular in my rotation of brews to pick up, but either or, I was very happy I tried this and it confirms my conclusion that Dogfish Head is definetley my favorite brewery.

It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mild aftertaste. Overall this beer definitely tasted like it was brewed from an ancient recipe. It was very interesting to try once, with nice cocoa subtleties. It had solid body and hid the alcohol well.

Aroma consists of pepper, cinnamon-like quality, with chocolate, bubblegum, nut, and banana. Hot pepper, coming off as a cinnamon like quality, with a fair bit of bubblegum, nut, banana, with come cocoa in the undertones, with some notes of fruitiness. Surprisingly light-bodied with ample carbonation. No alcohol flavor or hotness to speak of, but the alcohol effects definitely make themselves known... Dangerously drinkable, unique, and complex - unlike any beer I've had. I definitely am impressed - if only this had been approved for NH! Really really good stuff - another slam-dunk for DFH!","MrHurmateeowish","Jul 26, 2009"

Nose has tones of rhubarb, honey, marmalade and faint spices. On first sip the honey sweetness is quite noticeable as it is thick and syrupy. A raw veggie feel is long on the palate in the middle of this beer. A very slight spicy feel that resembles good fresh garden grown peppers. The veggie meets spice feel really builds on the mouthfeel as you continue to drink and actually makes the mouthfeel very pleasant. This beer really grows on you as you drink and makes it very nicely drinkable.","SPLITGRIN","Jul 24, 2009"

The chocolate is prominent in the taste and the chilies are there in a post quaffing burn. There is a bit of sweetness from the honey, but IMO too much going on.

Given that this is such a novelty, I don't really have any constructive criticism for it. I'll just take it for what it is. I doubt we'll see a host of chocolate/chile beers coming down the pipe.

Tastes of slightly sour grapes, grape skins, cocoa powder, honeyed pears, a sourness akin to grape lemonade that's lacking most of it's sugar.

The retention was so-so and the lacing no better. The aroma was of pale malt, honey, lots of spices, a hint of chocolate, some fruity esters and floral hops in the background. The flavors were unusual indeed. I tasted the ancho chilies and cocoa powder quite clearly along with the spices and some doughy pale malt. The finish did have enough leafy hops in it to be crisp and a touch bitter. None of the flavors really seemed well-defined however and they all seemed to be competing with rather than complimenting each other. Semi-sweet and rather acidic. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation good. Interesting, but not one I'd quickly recommend.","thekevlarkid","Mar 16, 2009"

Powdered bakers chocolate, with biscuity yeast, and a bit of honey. No really noticeable aroma of ancho chilies. The flavor is quite chocolaty. Not sweet chocolate, but more like a 85% pure cocoa bar. Just a hint of delectable sweetness from the honey comes through. A bit of clove. The tail is pure Ancho, with just a slight burn as it turns down your throat and warms your belly. This is some of the best chile presence I've found in a beer. The mouthfeel leaves great chile burn on the inside of your lips but unfortunately is a little less then carbonated and finishes just a bit to dry. I really wish there was a bit more carbonation to this beer.

Pours a perfect , rich Amber color, lighter than expected (although not sure how I could have expected much given the style). Apparent carbonization led to a medium head, only slightly off-white. The smell is very faint, I can detect the cocoa, but nto nearly as much as you might expect reading the label, and considering DFH history of some overwhelmingly, sweet brews. The taste is solid, but once again, not too strong. The cocoa and honey hints are there, but do not take over the flavor of the ale. For the last time, I was surprised by the lack of overwhelming sweetness and chocolate. Pleasantly surprised though, as it led to a slightly more drinkable style that usual, in my opinion, for DFH. The relatively light carbonization also led to the muted mouthfeel. An interesting beer to try, but certainly not going into the rotation.","bhalter8","Nov 28, 2008"

It tastes like chocolate, mild chilies, honey and a fruity taste that I'm not exactly sure what it is. Overall it's a unique flavor, that's about the only way I can describe it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit dry in the finish and has soft carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and not hard to drink. This isn't what I expected at all, I thought the chocolate and chilies flavor would be stronger. But with that being said, I liked it a lot.

A strange combination, for sure, but truthfully, I struggle to find those aroma profiles, and really, there isn't much here in the way of smell. There is certainly some sweet malt present, but this is unlike anything I have ever had before. As far as the smell is concerned. The taste is rather strange, too. I can't really discern any of the honey, cocoa, chile peppers, or any other flavours. It's pretty sweet up front, but I don't really think it's from the honey. Then the finish kinda reminds me of Midas Touch, but with the slightest hint of smoke. I really don't know what to make of this beer. It doesn't taste bad. I can drink it, and will have no trouble killing a 750mL by myself as the alcohol is wonderfully concealed. However, it isn't really something I would seek out. Again, Midas Touch comes to mind.

Taste is very sweet and very fruity, honey, corny, honey and caramel, grapes, chile, more peppery heat than spice, lingers on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth from alcohol, very peppery spice finish. Not sure where the cocoa comes into play as I don't get any in either the aroma or flavour.

The chili gives some spiciness in flavor and feel (the feel of dry powder on the tongue...impossible feel to describe but its hinted at in this beer..), the cocoa gives some dy character and some perceived bitterness as it sits along the back of the tongue and roof of the mouth, and the honey provides sweetness. Finish is semi-dry. Body is medium, some weight added by the honey, carbonation is perfect playing off the honey so well. This is one that is dangerously drinkable.

No chili pepper presence. Sadly, this is true in the taste as well. Another overly sweet, high alcohol DFH beer. Taste is fine. Sweet. Killing this bottle will not be a problem, but tastes are nothing like what I was anticipating. Little to no cocoa presence, and absolutely no chili. Thankfully, the auslese tastes and aromas predominent in their other archeological creations do not register here. Mouthfeel is fairly watery and smooth with little to no carbonation. Drinkability is good with no noticeable heat for its ABV. All in all, a nice enough experience, but a letdown and not a repeat purchase.

The smell was more of what I'd call a mid-grade lager smell... kind of wet-hay, barn smell. I could not detect the chilis or the chocolate in the smell. Early tastes were more of the lager-barn variety, which disappointed me. I thought of all the malt/backbone flavors to pair exotic chocolate and chili with, this didn't seem to be the one. As I worked through more it began to open up and be more balanced - the maltiness holding the chili/chocolate in check. I began appreciating the uniqueness of the beer, but still not really enjoying it. The mouthfeel was not great - kind of a heavy lager feel to it. The drinkability was not great due to many of the factors above. It was easy enough to drink (not too hot, bitter, or stringent), but still the overall viscosity and heavy lager-like (I know it's not a lager) flavor, just made it more of a chore to work through it.

This one is vaery interesting and quite succesful from a beer point of view as well. Pours a lighter shade of orange with a short head that fades to a thin swirl. The smell is fairly light, but I smell the ancho chilis, and perhaps a slight herbal, mineral bitterness from the annato. The chocolate is rather light, and smells faintly creamy. The taste is very nice, much more pronounced in flavors, but balanced and still somewhat subtle. Creamy chocolate that tastes almost like cacao pulp, somewhat herbal, soft and lightly chocolatey. There is also an underlying lightly fruity, roasty chili flavor that segues into a final nutty creaminess. Although I think this is rather lightly spiced, I find that the chili definitely is present and adds a distinct element. Very smooth and creamy and doesn't at all seem like a 9% beer.","Georgiabeer","Nov 02, 2008"

4.22,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy rustic wheat tinted amber color with a HUGE off-white foamy head that resists fading. Gotta love that head...takes it better than a 4.0 but the hang time makes it less than a 4.5. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing in it's wake. The smell is really interesting, but timid. At first nose i'm flushed with an earthy Belgian yeasty character that leads me to a harvest fruit like aroma... saison / farmhouse-like at first. If i let my imagination run wild i sense that earthy yeast thing breaking down to a malty NECCO chocolate and that ever so light tangy texture may actually be the chili... i'm sooo not familiar with. The nose is scoring points for complexity as it warms up. Again, I'd go something slightly more than a 4.0 because of the complexity, but less than a 4.5 because the characteristics are subtle. The mouth is adequately carbonated, medium bodied, fundamentally creamy with a nice tangy note. The texture complements the flavors nicely. Again similar to a farmhouse but with a mild chocolaty aftertaste that lingers in the aft-roof of the mouth. The 9% ABV is integrated well...enhancing its drinkability...beware, that's real alcohol content they're advertising!!! This one is another pure pleasure to consider!!

4.22,9.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"This is more like a 'kitchen sink' beer than a chili beer. It's got all the crap that the ancients could think of, including a little bit of malt. The beer has a bright copper-amber hue at first, but poured a hazy rusty hue toward the end of the bomber. Head formation was fair, as well as retention and lacing. Rich aromas of honey, chocolate, toffee, and molassas fills the nose along with herbal and perfumy notes. Flavors strongly favor the honey and mask a lot of the malt base. Very sweet to taste with a powerful underlying taste of cocoa, almonds, pecans, and cashews. Again, hints of corriander, orange peel, cherries, cumin, and a flowery note give the beer a lot of complexity. Flavors of the chilis gain intensity and are noticed going into the finish. The beer's weight favors the honey as well, but allowing a soft malt blend to substantiate the beer. Quite warming from mid-palate on from a blend of the chilis and alcohol. The heat never offends but does give the beer a little something extra. The chilis also seem to balance the sweetness with the low hop (if any) additions. A very nice experimental beer. I'll have to see how this one ages out.","BEERchitect","Oct 29, 2008"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"this beer is WEIRD! that doesnt mean its bad. I was expecting to have all these different flavors. I couldnt put my finger on what it smelled/tasted like. The color was an orangey copper. I drank it out of a snifter but i couldnt decide what the aroma was. It was interesting and delicious. I am glad the apv was on the lower side for DFH. I dont know what this beer is, but it is a good effort. drinkability good and so is the mouthfeel. try it if you can.","NoahSYGG","Oct 12, 2008"
4.37,13.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,"One of the most different and unique beers Ive had. Id expect nothing less from these guys, at the end of the beer I grew to love it. Would have guessed the alcohol to be under 5%.","marcpal","Oct 12, 2008"
4.2,8.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"So, it's another landmark brew from history, resurrected by Dogfish Head, and I am, once again, amazed. Theobroma is excellent, if in an odd, 'traditional' way. Never confined by any semblance of in-the-box thinking, the folks at DFH could probably make beer out of briars and bathwater that would taste good, sell like mad, and otherwise earn the respect of discerning drinkers everywhere.","cvstrickland","Oct 12, 2008"
3.85,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drink ability- not what I was expecting at all but a very good beer overall by dfh. Overall a easy beer to drink.","seanpachefddfa","Oct 10, 2008"
3.7,-4.1,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"I've been waiting for this ever since hearing about it. Not as good as I'd hoped, but a very interesting beer and a must try. I've got another bottle to age - perhaps a little time will do it some good.","Lupe","Oct 10, 2008"

3.65,-5.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D- keep drinking, it only gets better. Highly drinkable except for the availability. You can only get 4 bottles at the Rehoboth and Milton locations so feel free to horde whatever you can buy!!","Keith238","Oct 08, 2008"
3.53,-8.5,4,3.5,4,2.5,3,"Drinkability: Interesting beer, I might like to drink one every now and then, but I don't think I'm drawn to consume it regularly.","unclejedi","Oct 08, 2008"
3.11,-19.4,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability- Well the first glass was nice. The second was a little hard to get down and the third was easy again (had a buzz). It can be sort of cloying at times and the dry finish seems to escalate it. I highly doubt the first beer tasted anything like this but it's a cool concept and a decent beer to share with a friend.","younger35","Oct 08, 2008"
3.97,2.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Alcohol's up there, but this is one hell of a complex and interesting beer. I split the bottle with my father, which may have helped (he was quite taken aback by it, by the way). It's not one I could have every night, or every week, or even every month. However, it was very reasonably priced for a 1 pint 9.4 oz. beer of this complexity, and could definitely be a good special-occasion beer (as many of DFHs are). It was definitely a conversation starter at my table (even my mom liked it, which is rare).","CrellMoset","Oct 07, 2008"
3.95,2.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I am surprised I liked this beer as much as I did, as I have been repulsed by Chile beers in the past. A well balanced beer with a good flavor, even with the chilies.","paco1029384756","Oct 07, 2008"
4.23,9.6,4.5,4,4,4,5,"Not a miss for DFH by far, but I think I will need to try some further aged bottles in a few months to see the full potential.","guild337","Oct 06, 2008"
3.82,-1,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: The alcohol content is pretty high and it becomes more and more apparent as the beer warms a little. Certainly an intriguing beer, as DFH will be. The scent stands out in particular, though the 'buttered popcorn' smell starts to go away as it warms.","Proteus93","Oct 04, 2008"
3.28,-15,4,3.5,3,4,3,"Pours a bold orange/red with a full ½ inch white head. Smells of cloves, spices, vanilla, and honey. First sip is both spicy and mellow - very complex . A creamy milkshake like smoothness adds to great mouthfeel. Unfortunately, there is simply too much going on here with no one flavor taking charge. It is just a mess.","ATLbeerDog","Oct 04, 2008"

4.12,6.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Without question, and regardless of anything else, I'd have to say that this is one of the most unique beers on earth at this point in time!!! That's not too unusual for DFH, however, as I think they did that years ago with Immort Ale. And there have been quite a few more in between. That said, it's a bit of a 'must-try'. Beyond that, it's actually pretty drinkable. At 9 or 10% abv, it's small glass fare, meant to be savored not quaffed, and a bottle can be split between 2 - 4 people easily. Not to be missed!","NeroFiddled","Oct 02, 2008"

3.22,-16.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Drinkability: moderate. The flavors are not off-putting, but the combination is strange. It certainly doesn't taste like a 9% beer, which is dangerous, but there's something about it that makes me content to just leave the glass on the table a bit longer than usual.","jsled","Sep 27, 2008"
3.68,-4.7,4,3.5,4,4,3,"Unlike any other beer Ive ever had. There is really no cocoa nibs or cocoa powder taster, I Thought it would pour dark but ended up pouring light/ a tint of orange. I waited for this beer since I heard about it, I was impressed because it was so different. I could not pinpoint one flavor except maybe the honey on the finish and a little cinnamonesqe smell on the nose. Really great effort by DFH. try it if you see it, my review will make a little more sense","lbkornlb14","Sep 27, 2008"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Considering the beer has chili in it, it's a very sweet and flowery beer, not much spiciness at all. Makes for a good dessert beer.","BeerSox","Sep 27, 2008"
4.03,4.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Nice chewy, yet smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of honey and grapes, reminiscent of Midas Touch are then cut with a blast of subdued spicyness that builds in intensity.	A subtle chocolate presence appears in the finish, with notes of hot cocoa. Alcohol is nicely masked. All in all a nicely balanced beer and a return to historical fashion in the vein of Midas (I didn't care for Jihua).","cbl2","Sep 27, 2008"
3.62,-6.2,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Very interesting and tasty enough. 9% is a bit limiting but it's nearly undetectable and drinks pretty easy. Glad I got to try it but I'll probably trade mine.","pwoods","Sep 25, 2008"

3.9,1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"served on-tap at the rehoboth brewpub, this was a very interesting experiment and something i'd get again. billed by the server as a chili and chocolate beer, i expected something dark, roasty, and spicy. what arrived, however, was a clear gold, viscous-looking beer with a nice creamy white head and thick lacing. pale malty dough, honey, and floral notes in the bouqet with a hint of cocoa butter preceded a taste of prominent fresh sweet malt that led to a semi-drying finish. nice bit of cocoa butter on the back end along with some vague spice. rich, full mouthfeel with just the right level of carbonation. this surely doesn't seem like the 10% we were told it was.","MrMcGibblets","Mar 23, 2008"
