"O:  really cool beer ... I'm surprised by the smoke/peat/rauchbier taste, but it works really well here; the fact that you can taste the jalapenos is perfect -- if this is a gimmick, at least you can taste the gimmick.  and for me it's NOT a gimmick ... this brew is just begging to be paired with some food, tacos or cheese or something."
"With a name like Don Jalapeno, though, I guess I don't get what everyone else expected. I love it."

"Pours a orange amber with a nice head. Smell is definitely jalapeno and the taste is definitely jalapeno with a decent burn. Not too much body or other flavor but for those who like a spicy beer, this beer delivers. A true jalapeno beer that they really nailed in terms of delivering jalapeno."

"D - I thought this was great. It had the right level of spice, without going into gimmick territory; you can still taste the base beer and it integrates nicely with the peppery flavors. Would happily drink this again, although it'd be hard to have more than a bottle in an evening."

"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a large white head. The aroma is a mix of biscuit malt and fresh green jalapeno peppers. The flavor is more of the same and about what I expected. The biscuit malt is overpowered by the peppers, which are also accompanied by a little bit of grass. Unlike some other pepper beers, the chilis add more flavor than they do heat, which in this case is a good thing. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
