"I enjoy the peppers/spice in this beer, but it is overpowering enough to completely crush any other flavors. The multiple types of peppers give it a little complexity which is definitely appreciated. It's hot, but not to the point of undrinkabilitiy. Overall, it's a decent chili beer, but it falls just a little short. It's worth a shot if you're a fan of the style or have adventurous tastes, but a lot of beer drinkers would probably be turned off."
"had my favorite chili mixed with my favorite drink heck yes best combo ever"

"Had this while camping in Yosemite for my honeymoon. Bottle to camp mug, pours a light gold, smells like fresh sliced peppers. The thin head dissipates into nice lace around the top. Flavor is straight up chilies, but not overly spicy, in fact, its just perfect for my taste. I have had many pepper beers seeing as how i live so close to BP in San Diego. I have had a Habanero Sculpin that had almost no pepper taste and was disappointing, and had a habanero piper down that i couldn't get down! But this beer has a small amount of heat and full pepper flavor. If you like peppers and spice, grab this beer. If you cant handle even a little heat, be warned."
"O: If you like heat in your beverage then this is the beer for you. Not as drinkable or as complex as other chili beers I've had, but a good example of a spicy lager."

"Overall: This beer was a bit more spicy than other beers I have had of the same style. I didnt like it. Some spice is good, but this one was overpowering in my opinion. I will not drink it again."

"Spiced with Fresno Chiles. HOLY COW! Pours a clear, golden color with a large white head that disappears quickly. Scent is out of this world! Smalls like habanero chile/jalapeno right away! The most chile I've ever gotten out of the aroma in a beer. Some light grain and light malt aroma, but STRAIGHT UP CHILE PEPPER! Taste is the same! I have thought that I have become a custom to chile beers considering the recent fad in the craft scene, but this takes it to a whole other level. VERY SPICY! Not for the faint of heart. Definitely the spiciest beer I've ever had when it comes to heat. A ton of heat from the Fresno chile peppers. I could only imagine what it would be like if they made a Michelada outta this. Mouthfeel is light, but it burns as it goes down the throat because of the chile heat. Drinkability is somewhat high once you get used to the heat. Overall, the best bee that Tioga-Sequoia has ever put out...only because it pushes the limits. I haven't ever been too impressed with my local brewery, but this one knocked my socks off!"
