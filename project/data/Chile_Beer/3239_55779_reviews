"Thanks, sunkistxsudafed, for the opportunity"

"Overall, this beer is quite drinkable and enjoyable. It's not amazing (wish it had quite a bit more kick to it!) but still a solid beer. If you aren't a huge fan of hot food this might be a good example of a milder chile beer to try. Perhaps if I have multiple in one sitting the hot pepper flavor will slowly build like it does when eating spicy food over the course of a meal. Guess I'll have to get multiple bottles next time to find out."

"From the 12 oz bottle bought at Jubilation Fine Wines in Albuquerque."
"O: Gotta give it a try, it is not too hot. a unique beer for sure. I would definitely drink again."

"A pretty basic and faceless chili beer. Underwhelming is my assessment, but I gave it a 3.5 rating for taste because you do get a light chili presence. I'm not sure, but it strikes me as being a lager as opposed to an ale. That might explain some of its smooth character. Perhaps a good 'starter' chili beer if someone is new to the style (and is afraid of too much heat) due to its mild nature. There are better examples out there."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, didn't see if there was a freshness date on it. This pours a light golden or a straw colored beer with a small head which quickly dissipates. The feel is light and crisp. The smell is with an obvious green chili aroma followed by a crisp lager smell. The taste is much of the same, you get a nice smooth bit of green chilies, not hot at all but very pronounced."

"Interesting, but I really wish more of the roasted chile character was here, and in general this could use a whole lot more chile in the flavor and aroma. I wouldn’t mind a bit more of a characterful base beer either, though this wouldn’t be nearly as noticeable if this had been more of a prominent green chile gimmick beer. Said another way, the current base beer needs a whole lot more green chile flavor to be a good attempt at a gimmick beer, to actually be a good beer though both the chile flavor needs to be boosted and the base beer needs to completely change to something with a whole lot more character (even a porter would work if the roasted green chile was done properly)."
"Very interesting flavors. This would go great with chips and salsa."
"I am a fan."
"Tastes better than it smells. Medium to light in body, mildly dry finish. Mild pepper on the back and some mild smoke. It is a little tough to drink. Interesting experience but I don't think I'd have it again."
"The ninth entry in SwillFest 2011. It pours a clear sallow topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises nothing more than jalapeno skin and seeds. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some greens, and the lightest possible touch of peppery heat. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a kinda sad chile beer, but, to its credit, it doesn't try to overpower with crappy pepper heat, which definitely makes this easier to drink than most chile beers."
"Overall - I've had other ""chile"" beers before, and although this is probably the best that I've tasted, I'm still not at all in love with the taste. Still, kudos to them for it not being horrible either."
"Started out with promise, the promise of Chile heat, but delivers far too little in the end, sigh..."
"I really have no idea what I’m getting into with this beer. Tomorrow is Cinco De Mayo and I picked up what I initially thought would be your basic Mexican Lager (Cerveza is Spansih, after all). But a closer inspection of the label informs me that this is a berr with green chili flavor. No other pertinent information is available, which means no ABV, etc. Let me just say that I’ve had my share of chili beers that I’ve liked (Rogue Chipotle, Weston Labs #2, Flat Branch Green Chili, etc.), but more often than not they’re revolting (Cave Creek Chili Beer). Let’s see what this guy has to say. Pours a light straw that’s crystal clear, with a big foamy head that dies as quickly as it begins. So far so good. It looks like beer. First aroma is stale green chili and not much else. First taste is weird. There’s this very metallic and mineral aftertaste and not much else, except maybe a little bit of chili heat (nothing overwhelming) at the end. Second taste yields a bit more flavor, as both the beer character and the green chile flavor are finessed. I’m glad this thing isn’t the palate destroyer that I had feared when first opening the bottle, but I’m also a bit disappointed that it’s not a bit more substantial. This beer would be killer with some nice pork tacos or other spicy Mexican food. On it’s own it’s a little bit of a let down."
"Pours a light gold with no head to speak of, only a rim. Aroma is like a freshly opened can of green chile. The taste is green chile dip on tortilla chips - cool! This is a absolutely great chile beer. Not hot at all but with big green chile flavor. New Mexicans (like me who love green chile) should flock to this. I'm going to have to try this with all sorts of New Mexican foods such as chile rellenos or chicken enchiladas ... will update. Should be beautiful."
"O-My first chile style cerveza. As stated in another review, this is a superb ""lunchtime"" beer. Which is exactly when I drank it....with my lunch at a Mexican restaurant. Not bad at all :)"
"With the pop of the cap, the nose is invaded by an even green-chili flavor. Crystal-clear golden color and fine bubbles keep the lacing alive. Fluffy crispness in this lighter-bodied beer. Green chili flavor is very prevalent from start to finish, very even, while still letting other flavors through. Beery flavors ensue, with fermented grain and a quick kiss of hops. Clean dry finish with a very mild chili warmth. It screams ""lunchtime beer""--what a great way to wake up the palate. Without a doubt this is a very well put together chili beer."
"Having experienced so many disgusting attempts at chili beer, this one was a pleasant surprise. It's definitely not my favorite style, but I wouldn't turn away another bottle of Rio Grande -- which is saying a lot."
"MOUTHFEEL was medium with nice carbonation--not too much and not flat. Pretty smooth considering the pepper."
"Tastes like the base of this beer is a pretty bland lager, there is a light graininess from the malt and that is balanced by a faint hop bitterness. The chiles are great, not overly powerful or hot, but the roasted flavor has the faintest reminder of cardboard. This is far from the abomination that is Cave Creek, it's a pretty drinkable beer. There is a very slight heat in the back of the throat, but nothing dramatic. I probably will like this beer more than most, as I absolutely love green chiles in beer. This one is a pretty decent attempt, I like it."
"P.S. If a green chile could take a piss, this is what would be in the toilet."
"The smell reminds me of my brother's chili. I've had chili beers that taste like peppers, but this one actually smells and tastes exactly like chili. It is intriguing, but the novelty wears off quick and you realize you are drinking a beer that tastes like chili. I like beer, and I like chili, and I like using beer to make my chili... but I realize I don't need a beer that tastes like chili. All I'm thinking now is that I also have a Crazy Ed's Cave Creek Chili Beer in my fridge as well... I can only imagine how bad that one will be."
"Notes: So much for the beer I bought AKSP in Seattle. After this, he doesn't deserve it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, and what head did form (not much) was gone in a flash, leaving a few stray bubbles aroud the rim of the surface of the light golden brew. Absolutely no lacing. Aroma is dominated by green peppers, which one would expect. Taste is dominated by the pepperness in all facets, but some pale malt sweetness does poke its nose out here and there. Mouthfeel is limp, with little carbonation, and drinkability is so-so. Not one for pepper-haters, but seemingly not as bad as that other crazy pepper beer."
"Scores from my review are judged to style, not to super-ultimate-greatest-incredible-beer-in-the-world."
"12 ounce bottle. No freshness dating. Purchased for $3.06 per six pack at Green's in Atlanta. This is a great beer for adding to chillie which is exactly what I plan to do with most of the rest of them."
"Ok, this was for me an oddly dichotomous beer. On the one hand, I could tell there was some quality here. The actual beer underneath the chile would have been boring. Not much body or flavor, but the chile flavor is legit and actually meshes well with the beer. Still something about it doesn't sit well with me and I couldn't finish it."
"Being from Arizona, where ""Everything is available with ""Salsa", ""Chilies"" are a mainstay of many meals, this should be a ""Hoot"". The beer pours a translucent gold color on the pour, the head minimal in size, the lace sparse, both off white in color. Nose, the ""archetypal green chili"" aroma with a start that is slightly sweet, the top waterish in feel. Finish is dry, sparingly acidic, middling on the hops, dry and a pepper like twang, quite malt dry aftertaste. Spicy to be sure, different Thats a fact Jack, actually drinkable, unlike the Arizona version Ed's Chili Beer which I will rate at a later time."
"Let it warm up a bit to get the green chile smell and flavor."
