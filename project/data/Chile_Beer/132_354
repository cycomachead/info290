There is a definite smoky chipotle nose - just enough to let you know what you are getting into. The flavour is very pleasant, a solid caramel malt base with just enough smoke and pepper heat. It is far from overpowering and in my books, very well done. I don't drink many beers like this, but I could certainly acquire a taste for them!","Bunman3","Feb 11, 2015"

My friend couldn't do that with his allotment so I ended up drinking his share as well as what was left in the bottle. While not a drain pour, this is not a beer for most people and should only be tried to satisfy a curiosity. Probably something I wouldn't try again but nevertheless glad that I had once, and one of the few beers that cries out for a meal to go along with it. Clearly not one of Rogue's better offerings.","JerzDevl2000","Oct 16, 2014"

The appearance of the poor was a dark amber hue with a light head. The smell was smokey with a little bit of pepper mixed in with the hops and malt smells. The taste and mouthfeel are what I love the most about the beer. The taste is deeply smokey with just a little bit of spice on the back of the throat. It makes the beer an easy pairing with Spanish and Indian food. The mouthfeel as well coats your cheeks so that there's a light tingle from the spice. Overall was very nice and for the price I found it at (7.99) not a bad buy.","WhiteHillsStore","Mar 05, 2014"

3.88,9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, bread, chipotle pepper, light smoke, light citrus, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and chipotle pepper notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, chipotle pepper, light smoke, herbal, floral, grass, light citrus, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Slight herbal bitterness/pepper spice on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, chipotle pepper, light smoke, herbal, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt, pepper, and light hop flavors; with minimal pepper heat and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice chile beer! All around good balance and robustness of malt, pepper, and light hop flavors; and very smooth to drink with the minimal heat from the peppers. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 20, 2014"

Smooth and mildly hoppy nose, moderate carbonation, with warming chipotle finish. I would argue that the spicier beers are more of a novelty, whereas this one is more genuinely tasty and drinkable. If you like that kind of thing, of course, it's not for everyone.","recoveringmormon","Aug 16, 2013"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of smoked malt, band-aid, chipotle pepper, and slight fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with smoke, chipotle, and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a smoke and chipotle presence that comes across better in the flavor, but it lacks any sort of heat for a chile beer.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 19, 2013"

The right amount of peppers is key and the Rogue crew nailed it here. I'm still getting a little heat and numbing of the gums as I write.

You get a nice and very distinct chipotle flavor. That said it doesn't overpower the nice clean underlying ale. This would be a great beer to mix in to a tasting due to its distinctness. I had it paired with some local cheeses and it was fantastic. This isn't an every night beer but a great one to mix it up a bit.","EvanJohnson","Apr 19, 2013"

4.02,12.9,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Didn't really know what to expect from this beer. After trying it, I can say I definitely like the style and find it right up my alley. I do like spicy things overall, and having this makes me realize it can work fairly well in beer when done right. Appearance looks like a normal type of amber ale. Not to much head or lacing, looks nondescript. You can definitely smell some of the pepper, and it gives the beer a slightly smokey scent. The smell is interesting. I can't say it's necessarily appetizing, but definitely interesting. Taste wise is where this beer shines. As it warms, the pepper and spice becomes slightly more pronounced, and gives this beer a bit of a bite that I find to be really satisfying. The more you have of it, the better it is. It takes a little getting used to at first. Mouthfeel is a little on the watery side, but the same time the carbonation goes great with the spice, and the heat of it makes it feel quite full. Any fuller body would probably make this feel too heavy. Overall I quite liked this... not a beer I would drink everyday, but certainly good.","ely2000k","Jan 31, 2012"

3.62,1.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on December 29, 2011. The pour is amber-copper with a short-lasting head that boils down to a ring and a slightly cloudy appearance. For the title, the aroma is actually rather straight forward with a nuice sweet maltiness and a clean hoppiness on the nose. The body is medium. Compared to the aroma the taste is entirely unique with a very spicy bite of pepper that pretty mucn drowns out the malts and hops. Unique for certain but not really something I would have regularly.","puboflyons","Dec 29, 2011"

4.12,15.7,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler, the beer is a vibrant, slightly hazed copper coloring with no head. The nose is caramel malty in the background, with a pepper spice and smokiness in the forefront. Flavors are heavily ladened with the peppery flavors, both sweet and spicy, and a heavy dose of roasted smokiness. Very well balanced, and a good background of malt sweetness to keep everything held together and smooth. The beer is mid-bodied, and remains on the light side for the flavor profile. The aftertaste is mostly the smokiness, with bits of the pepper vegetable on the palate. Mid-linger finish, again mostly the smoke. Very unique and interesting brew. Great flavors, and not overpowering. Can't wait to have it with some enchiladas, or other Mexican fare.","GarthDanielson","Oct 08, 2011"

I didn't really get any chipotle until a few second after swallowing the first swig, but after that, the slight tingle was with my for the rest of the session.

Smell deeper, though, and just a strong caramel dominates. Taste definitely is dominated by smoky peppers but not nearly as intrusively as I imagined. It leaves a lingering slight sting around the mouth & the back of the throat. Very balanced, actually, and it reminds me of the rauchbiers from Bamburg a bit. Grassy, bready.

The color poured out as a really nice amber color with a nice creamy looking head on it. The aroma doesn't really have much of a pepper quality to it. Instead it's got some sweet malts and a touch of hops. The taste is a little on the weak side, the spice is in there but it's very minimal. The mouthfeel is drinkable and pretty smooth.

I'm quite disappointed they played it safe with the chipotle, there is only a little smoke and almost no spice to be found in this beer. It doesn't taste bad, but it fails to meet expectations.

Average body and carbonation, nothing to write home about but not disappointing. This has been my first foray into this fringe style, but I was expecting a bit more heat.

It came as part of a flight and the head/lacing may have lessened before it arrived at my table. Smoky smell, with just that subtle hint of jalapeno. Consistent taste.

It has light smokiness and has a malt aroma similar to that of malt liquor. Strange. Luckily, the pepper heat becomes more prominent as it warms. The flavor is very smokey. I don't get a lot of pepper but I do get a light spice to it. It reminds me of the Shiner Smokhaus for some reason. It's very malty and there are no hops to be found. It's just malt and spice. Some sweetness arises on the back end of the beer. It drinks light and is drinkable enough. This style is an acquired taste.

Chipotle Ale is just that, it's a slightly malty beer with a smokey taste and a chipotle pepper kick to the finish. Not hot, in the food sense, but there is a notable kick after swallowing this beer that provides for a very fresh and less than common experience. Chipotle Ale is not as complex and subtle as the chile beers I've tried since, best served by itself, and an excellent choice for a first time chile-beer consumer.","msmezher","Sep 24, 2010"

I've always had a soft spot for that beer, though it's admittedly gross now that I've moved on to bigger and badder beers. Pours a red bordering on copper. Nice balooning head with some pretty impressive amount of lacing. Moderate carbonation levels. Aroma is all smokey chipotle pepper and not much else. If you're not a fan of the chipotle favor it'll be pretty overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, with low carbonation. Flavor is smoked chili powder mixed into a red ale. Medium caramel sweetness in the finish with some temperate pepper. This beer would go great with barbecue, like burnt ends or spare ribs. Standing alone it's merely an interesting execution on the pepper beer style, heads and shoulders above Cave Creek but lacking something.

Where is the chipotle you might ask? Good question. After taking a sip you have to be patient and let it develop a little bit in your mouth. It is very subtle and comes to the back of the mouth and tongue well after the liquid has gone down your throat. This beer rewards the patient beer drinker.

It smelled a lot like beer, but it smelled almost like something had gone wrong in the process. It didn't smell bad, it just smelled different. I will attribute that to the chipotle peppers. The taste is great though, with nice caramel overtones and not a whole lot of smokiness or stiff spicy flavor. It's in the finish where the chipotle peppers shine... instead of an alcohol burn on the way down you get a really nice warming sensation from the presence of the peppers.

There are green, grassy notes in the nose, but I'm not picking up any pepper. It has a medium-light body that's smooth and creamy with a clean, dry finish. There's a roasted malt flavor up front and then the taste of smoky chipotle kicks in. There's not much spice, but plenty of flavor. It's well balanced and very drinkable.","yesyouam","May 31, 2009"

Taste - smooth mild and smoky chipotle pepper taste that is very genuine. The chipotle is the main taste in the beer, but is not in-your-face. There is a very thin malt sweetness at first that comes and then goes, accompanied by a carbonic bite and finally a bone dry semi-bitter finish, but no real hop flavor.

Odd to say the least. The peppery sensation sits in the nose, but isn't strong enough to make me sneeze or anything. The Chipotle taste isn't as powerful as I would have originally thought. Instead, it sits in the mouth long after all of the other flavors have passed, burning slightly...more like pepper than anything else.

The taste is as unique as the smell, with some good peppery notes that linger in the aftertaste and keep things fairly hot throughout. The hops and malts mix in right underneath the peppers and are a bit overshadowed. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied, and it's light on the carbonation.

3.82,7.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Taste is really complicated. You don't notice any heat until a couple seconds after the sip. It's followed up by a lot of burnt smokyness.. like charring a marshmallow at a campfire a little too much. It's very faint though. Good balance between the sweet and some of the darker/more acrid crystal malts. Hops have a definite consistent presence throughout the experience, lending a nice floral, juicyness to the beer that rounds out some of the more extreme flavors. I keep getting little pangs of heat in my mouth but it's completely unnoticeable when you're actually drinking the beer. I think if you bumped the alcohol up on this a bit and took out the peppers it'd just be a good British barleywine. But.. it's not. It's got peppers and it's doing its own thing. Good enough for me. Not totally irresistable, but it's got a lot gong on there and they did it right without making me feel like I'm drinking alcoholic fireball water. Mouthfeel is if anything a little undercarbonated. You sort of have to draw a fine line because much more and you'd be interfering with the rest of the beer but I think it could use a little bit more for the mouthfeel and also to improve some of the head's performance. Pretty easy drinking too. The hops really pull through as the saving factor for both drinkability and the spicy flavor. If they weren't there I probably wouldn't like the beer at all.

Very subtle aroma which is nice. Taste begins lightly smokey with some dusty grains and pale malts. The pepper flavor doesn't really emerge until midway with a slight kick that lingers into the aftertaste. What pepper flavor is there though, isn't much. I was expecting more, and to be honest was hoping for more. A noticable citrus hop is detected here and there throughout which reminds me that this is still a beer. As you progress drinking this, it definitely gets warmer in the mouth. Light to medium body with a prickly feel to it.

I wouldn't say dry or crisp for the mouthfeel, but just heat. This was like a good ale with a noticeable hop presence and some malts in there. Then it was like I did a shot of hot sauce. OK, it is a little bit more complicated than that, but I am trying to get a point across. My mouth actually heated up from this beer.

The aroma starts out as the sweet spiciness that comes from a fresh green jalapeno. There is a subtle sweetness that balances the spiciness very well. The taste is mildly oily and leaves a nice spiciness on the lips and tongue. For someone that really enjoys spicy food, this beer is really good. The mouthfeel is a bit thick honestly.

While I can taste a touch of the chipotle peppers in the aftertaste, it was never the focus nor an integral part of the ale. What was striking is the warmth of flavor and I don't mean temperature. The mouthfeel is exhilarating as the flavor is consistent while the liquid is on the palate, finishing nicely with a hint of pepper.

When I heard ""chipotle", I was expecting a strong spice flavor, but I didn't find that here... instead, I found a strong amber, red, taste... I wasn't dissapointed by the flavor at all... this is a classic Rogue brew with the distinct quality flavor and taste usually associated with the brewery...

Taste is surprisingly smooth, hoppy, faintly sweet, a decent bit bitter, and perhaps the faintest bite of spice, but it might also just be flavor from the hops. There is a touch of sweetness in the aftertaste which is nice. It does have a warming effect in the chest area after it goes down also, but its definitely not a chipotle smell or smoked taste on the palate. Subtle but still nice, and even though I was expecting a touch more hearty spicy smokiness from the chipotle, It may have made for an overly spicy, unenjoyable beer. This may be the right spice level, but I wish it had a hint of smokiness still. Overall pretty well balanced, but maybe not what you'd expect from looking at the bottle.

Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing, but what I'm tasting now is sweet and smoky rather than smoky and hot. The appearance of this beer is where it shines with its nice cloudy deep brown color and quickly dissipating head.

3.29,-7.6,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Amber color with a crusty, rocky, off-white head that lasts a while and clings to the sides. Not much aroma, faint caramel and slightly fruity malt notes, and just hint of some bitter hop esters. Dry grains and dry bitter hops up front and earthy, woody notes in the back. Chipotle heat is perceived in the back of the throat and esophagus, and minimally on the palate. I dont know how they achieved this but its nice that the chipotle heat doesnt wreck the palate. Midway through a slight sweetness develops along with some organic soily smoky notes. The finish is pretty much clean at first but then chipotle flavor arrives way late. Light to medium body and mouthfeel is about average, could have done with something thinner. Chipotle flavor becomes more noticeable as it warms but still much lighter than I remember it the previous couple of times Ive had this beer.","cabsandking","Nov 02, 2007"

3.72,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into my Hennepin glass. Pours a reddish brown with a healthy inch head that settles slowly into a lacy 1/2 inch or so. The beer is cloudy and I don't see much carbonation. The smell starts out with a nice, fruity, gummi bear like hop aroma backed immediately with a smooth and sticky malt character. The taste is interesting. The taste is much like an APA with a malt undertone topped with a smooth, mild-to-moderate hop bitterness. The chile peppers are faint but noticeable right in the middle of the drink. The pepper taste isn't there but the oil and waxy pepper effect is present. A slightly metallic spice and a bitterness that is separate from the bitterness given by any hop I've had gives it away. It sits more at the front of the tongue and has a residual, consistent effect. After you rest a few minutes from drinking it the pepper taste opens up a bit more with an acidic green chile resemblance.","Rudgers73","Sep 25, 2007"
3.6,1.1,3,3,4,3,4,"Taste: Not as spicy or different than I expected. Comes across at first as lightly to moderately hoppy then getting stronger in the hop department going down.

This beer has a very malty flavor, with only a hint of chili pepper which mostly is noticeable as a mild heat toward the end of the sip rather than as a flavor (although there is some flavor from the chili peppers, it is quite muted). Not bad, the only other chili flavored beer I've had is that abomination made by Cave Creek. Thankfully, this fares quite a bit better.

Aroma is first and foremost chipotle chili pepper, with some lightly sweet malt providing a little balance. Palate is mellow, lightly sweet malt up front, with the chipotle pepper building towards the back of the mouth. Finish is a good blend of sweet malt and pepper, but without a particularly high level of heat. Mouthfeel is akin to an English pub ale - smooth and velvety, without much in the way of carbonation. A great pairing with my spicy black bean chili, although it's not exactly a beer for everyday drinking.","ElGordo","Jul 29, 2007"

Not anything you would want to burp repetitively I can assure you. I think the adjuncts of chiles added to me feeling terrible the next day.

It poured a pale amber/medium orange color into my pint glass. Smells of sweet sweet malts, and hints of smoky chipotle peppers. Taste is more of the same, a rush of sweet malts, followed by a smoky chipotle pepper taste at the end. Not really spicy, but hints of spicyness. On a 1-10 scale on spicyness i'd rate this a 0.5. Drinkability actually isnt too bad on this, a nice addition for a mexican meal, or equally a decent pre-dinner beer. Quite enjoyable and recommended to all for at the very least a try of something new and different. I probably would have ranked it higher if they had used regular habanero or serrano peppers instead of chipotle peppers.

The taste was what kind of let me down but not in a horrible way. It ended being so average to me, I was expecting to either be wowed or just grossed out by something that tasted too much like peppers. I don't know maybe I'm crazy but it just tasted like a very average thin ale with just a tiny hint of smokiness in the background. The immediate aftertaste is just the smokiness but after a while if you let it sit on your tongue I get a hint of burnt chili seeds. It was not too bad for me getting through the one bomber but I gave it a 2.5 on drinkability because I could definately imagine it turning off alot of people and just left me pretty unimpressed either way.

3.84,7.9,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3,"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I picked it up out of the curiosity of possibly using chipotle in my own homebrew and wanted to see how the pros at Rogue managed. I was immediately struck by the sweet hot smokey smell of chipotle chiles. It was a carbon copy of opening a bag of actual chipotle chiles. Having heard horror stories of other chile beers, I was a little worried. I poured the beer, a burnt umber, into a pint glass with no head. Carbonation was there, just not in the form of any amount of head. In fact, it tickled my tonge with the carbonation and the lack of head did not help the mouthfeel. The real surprise came in the first sip. Absolutely a chipotle beer. I could taste smoky jalapenos, complete with spicy aftertaste. I even noted a bit of a hop presence. But the more notable offsetting flavor was a carmel sweetness in the malts. It balanced the spicy-smoky chipotle nicely. I had a hard time drinking a lot of this at once due to the spiciness--I felt like too much of it would give me heartburn. Therefore, I spaced it out over a period of grilling veggies, eating dinner, and cleaning up. It actually went fantastically with my grilled veggie sandwich. I marinated some portabellos, zuccini, and red pepper in olive oil and balsamic vinegar and grilled them. I toasted the bread and spread hummos on both sides. The result matched the chipotle ale perfectly. Meaty portabellos worked with the smoky beer. Tangy hummos offset the spiciness. The sweet red peppers picked up the sweetness in the malts. The zuccini... well fortunatly there was not a vegetable taste in the beer, so that was just extra. I probably would not buy another one of these unless matching it with food. Chipotle beer with veggies, who would have thought?","dnrobert24","Jul 12, 2006"

It's probably because, being from an Atlantic province, it's a smell and taste indelibly associated with fish for me. At any rate, other flavours include breads and plum, and the finish is dominated by the heat of the peppers, which try valiantly to save this beer for me, but ultimately come up short.

3.73,4.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Like the other Rogue beers I have sampled, this looks very good in the glass, with a rich amber/maple syrup colour and a cream-coloured head that is tight and left good lacing. Really lovely colour, straddling that wonderful hue between ruby red and rosewood brown. The chipotle peppers are definitely there as I first smell above the glass, which almost seem to emulate hops in their aroma. This smells almost tequila-like at times. Definitely spicy, with good full authentic chipotle notes, along with nice caramel malt and fairly assertive hopping. Actually very balanced with just enough of the Chipotle. Even without the peppers, this would be a fine pale ale. It really does remind me of some Chipotle dishes I have had, dry and a little astringent. Malting adds some caramel and light raisins and cream and bread. Taste showcases the peppers very expertly, with a very good balance here: it starts with dark malts and then in the middle really lets the pepper shine through, and by the finish you get that spicy tang that burns the lips and tongue a bit, as if you have just eaten a Chipotle pepper. Everything just...works somehow. The taste on the middle of the tongue is fantastic, and the aftertaste leaves a dry peppery feeling. I have to rate it high, not so much because I find it overly tasty, but because of the way they mixed the peppers with the beer. Fantastic execution. It seems to warm the throat and belly in a that way only peppers do. The taste is not extremely complex beyond the light roasty malting and the peppers, but the finish does leave some nice hoppy bitterness as well. Wow, this was pulled off very well. Good moderaly carbonated mouthfeel, and full bodied. A piquant beer, but also relatively drinkable. The pepper is never over-the-top, but neither is this a case of searching for some hidden flavour that leaves you wondering if this was just a misnamed pale ale. An admirable beer, and I was rather impressed. Would be fun to pair with Mexican or Indian dishes.

This was balanced well by the sweet fruitiness of the caramel malt and some well chosen citric hops from the Pacific Northwest. Pretty similar in flavor to chasing Mexican food down with an American Pale Ale which happens to be a pretty good beer and food pairing combination in my opinion. The flavors worked well together and the aftertaste was densely smoky. Quite juicy and medium thick on the palette, this would work splendidly well as an aperitif.

This is close to a smoked beer, but it has more of the chipotle flavor to it, not a smoked malt flavor. A little spiciness lingers in the mouth, this would be perfect with chocolate.

Poured like standard ale, a clear golden amber with a little bit of quickly disappearing head. The smell is of beer and yep chipotle sauce! Smells pleasant like a backyard BBQ. The mouthfeel was a little flat. The taste was OK, mildly hoppy ale with a heavy chipotle finish. It grew on me a bit as I drank it but cant say I would have another. Its a novelty though.

This beer would be absolutely perfect with a steak, or sitting around the campfire. I really like this and will buy again. Price was a little steep though. It tastes like beer and chipotle should but it's missing the spice, it shows up just as I'm finishing the bottle, and I don't even drink fast. You've got to take into acount that alcohol numbs your taste buds to capsacian, and that I like Thai food.

Tastes is similar as well; throw in sweet barley malt, earthy hops, smoked vegetables, and clean ale yeast. Mild barley sweetness and celery-like vegetables up front, then chile and hop spiciness hit in the body. Chile heat is assertive, but not over kill. The beer tapers into a dry chile vegetable flavor.

First taste is full of smokey chipotle flavor, very tasty, not at all burning, and integrating well with the malty backbone of the beer. After a few sips a spicey heat can be felt on the tongue between sips, and this spiciness builds throughout. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. I had this beer with some nachos, cheese, and salsa, and it really provided an excellent match to the food.

A sip starts with a standard mild malt flavor, but is soon joined by spiciness and mild smokiness. Moderately citrusy hops provide a nice bite. You can definently tastes the peppers, but the flavor isn't overwelmingly spicy. The highlight of this brew is the interplay between the malts and the chipotle towards the middle of a sip. A crisp mouthfeel is also welcomed. Despite enjoying the interesting flavor of this beer, I did get a little tired of the chili flavor by the end of my 22 oz. bottle.

The taste was sweetish and malty at the front, with some hops at the finish and only a faint showing of smoked peppers, very disappointing. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth and medium bodied, nothing to write home about. I would have to say that 22oz. was a bit too much of this.

The nose is slightly chile spicey, with a slight grainey sweet background. The chile is not all that strong, but it is well in the front of the brew. The flavor is not all that bad. There is a smokeyness that hits initially. The chile kicks in but not all that bed. No burning at all. Just nice roasted chile character. I would like to have this beer with some Mexican food. No real heat, just a slight spice in my stomach. I like it. The feel is moderate with a nice healthy carb. Overall, this is drinkable for a chile brew. The flavors are nicely balanced, the feel is good, the nose is nice. I think if you review this to style, it should be top dog. I take my hat off to Rogue for this brew. Very nice.","kmpitz2","May 11, 2005"

A pretty standard amber ale, with caramel malt flavors and spicy hops. A bit papery in the middle; oxidized perhaps, or maybe just the effect of adding chiles to the beer. With a fairly bitter finish. Just a touch of Chipotle flavor and a just a hint of heat in the finish. I expected a little more heat and a little more smokiness.

The smokiness was assertive but, again, not as strong as in the Smoke Ale. Mouthfeel is medium with the smokiness and heat providing the body. There are some hops noted in the end.

For some reason I was excepting a strong chile smell, but it is quite mild as it that of brown ale. With the mouthfeel you have a nice sense of carbonation and is smooth. The taste is similar to a brown ale, but has hint of another flavor I just can't pinpoint. Even for people that don't like the idea of chile in beer should give this at try, I was pleasantly surprised and can easily drink several of these.

There is no mistaking this for a rauchbier. Slight spicy tingle builds after a few sips. Smokey aftertaste with lingering bitterness. Tasty brew.

It has a deep amber color with golden highlights. A perfectly composed and sized white head that eventually recedes to a ring. The smell picks up a bit on the smoked chipotle peppers on top of the slightly roasted malts. The taste is dominated by the smokey flavor from the chipotle, but it is not disgustingly strong like I find many smoked beers to be (such as the Rogue Smoke Ale). I was a little bit disappointed that there wasn't more of a sweet BBQ type of flavor in the back or even the spiciness. Perhaps one day, if I am ever feeling adventurous (and if it is available) I will have to try the Cave Creek if it is the flavor and spiciness of the peppers that I crave.

Deep and malty, burnt toast. Bit of lingering caramelly sweetness. There is just a touch of a tingle to your tongue, but no heat at all. I was hoping to get a bit of it- I knew not to expect a CaveCreek or anything, but still thought I would catch more than there is. And since this was still freshly tapped, I assume this is what the heat is supposed to be at. A lot of flavor is left in your mouth.

And I loved it. There also seemed to be a slight cream edge, like bakers chocolate. The spice didnt really catch fire until five or six seconds after each swallow. I was happy that the only other thing I was eating at Redbones on this visit was water, and not their barbecue, because I think that would have been sheer overkill. Overall, this is a medium-bodied offering and one that I would choose to have more than one of if my tongue would allow it.

Pepper is certainly apparent in the flavor profile, and early -- generates heat by the third sip. Hops play in tune with the spiciness, there's an onion skin bittering in the aftertaste. Chile beers are one of the few that I rarely have a favorite in, but there is a better sense of sweet malt balance here than in many.

This brew is very malty and almost sweet up front, than the middle is smoky, and the finish is spicy/hot. The mouthfeel is good, but hot, and the drinkability would be better with some mexian food.

Mouthfeel was actively carbonated with some mild hop bite and a slight twang of pepper bite. Taste featured the caramel malt sweetness, with a balance provided by sparing use of the westcoast hops. I could detect a mild, smoky chili flavor of the chipotle peppers, but they're in the background. Very well balanced, overall, and very drinkable.

Body has a deep golden color and the head retains well for a short while, then disappears. The peppers are not at all noticeable in the nose. However, the flavor and aroma of this beer are quite well balanced, though I really detect very little pepperage going on here. Nose is sweet and malty; this follows through in the flavor as well. A hint of signature Rogue hoppiness comes through towards the finish. Only a few seconds after I swallow can I feel a bit of spiciness on my tongue. I wouldn't say I can taste the peppers, but I can feel the heat, if only slightly. Oh, and I didn't expect a perfectly smooth, creamy mouthfeel, but that's what I got.

Some very slight fig fruitiness at first, which gives way to bitter hops & some spiciness. Nothing really jumps out. Clean mouthfeel & aftertaste, very drinkable but nothing to write home about.

The pepper tones are kind of appealing. Other than the pepper, there is a nice mix of malt and hops. A little caramely. A little spicy hop bite as well. Overall, this one is pretty good.","Bighuge","Jan 03, 2003"
3.61,1.4,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Mexicali pours with a modest finely-carbonated white head, over deep golden, slightly hazy liquid. Nose is a bit of lightweight malt with a light note of sulphur. Tastes malty at first, with a very slight smokiness from the Chipotle peppers, then a nice although quite subtle heat is felt in the throat, subsiding quickly. Finishes a bit weaker than I remember (it's been a year or two since I last tasted it) it used to have a bigger flavor to it, but still is a unique departure in the Light Ale catagory.","beerluvr","Oct 06, 2002"
3.43,-3.7,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"very interesting....deep copper color, medium head and some lace.  almost a neutral smell with just a hint of smoke and rogue hops.  nice full mouthfeel gives way to some malt, a bit of hops and smoke and then a slightly warm chipotle finish.  the amount of heat is just right and then leaves a smoked aftertaste.  very tasty...would go great with some cheese and crackers and some smoked meat.  a slightly lower score for drinkability because this beer will not agree with everyone...but i loved it!","budgood1","Aug 07, 2002"
4.1,15.2,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"First pour: light golden with lager-like clarity and full head. Second pour: darker orange, hazy and no head at all. Musty odor with traces of smokiness and vague hops. Gentle malts are quite subdued and make room for the bold finish which is actually more smoky than spicy. Still the peppers linger in the finish, long beyond the beer, and build up strength in a way that is completely atypical for any beer I have tried, but right in line with the properties of hot peppers. The beer itself is quite nice and refreshing, smooth, and the smokiness is closer to a Bamberger Rauch. I could go either way with this beer; it woud be equally good - and much less intrusive - without the lingering burn, but it does make the beer interesting, even unique.","Thrasher","Jul 23, 2002"
4.3,20.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: Seriously one of the best spiced/herbal ales we have ever had ... some complex yet very well balanced and oh so drinkable all at the same time. A generous addition of smoked chipotle peppers give this brew the heat and smoke.","Jason","Mar 09, 2002"
