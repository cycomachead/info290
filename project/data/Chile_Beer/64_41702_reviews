"O: The beer is good at refrigerator temperature but it improvessignificant in the 50s F. this is unusual, very well done, balanced and enjoyable."

"Interesting beer subtle cocao taste with a Lil spice. Very different tasting than most beers I used to"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a one finger head that disapated fairly quickly. This medium amber unfiltered ale first hits you with a sour smell, but eventually fades. The taste of honey and cacao are present with little heat from the chilies. I found this to be very drinkable beer and look forward to having another one soon."

"Nice golden color with a quickly disappearing head.  Has a pleasant honey/fruity aromoa and taste. Not much chili or cacao taste, but a slight spicy bite on the end.  Slightly on the sour/wild side.   A bit too much sediment, but could have been my pour."
""
""
""
""
"Unfiltered craft goodness. Heavy and light simultaneously.  Cacao enhances the beer and leaves a clean finish. Most pepper or other flavor additives leave an unpleasant and overpowering aftertaste. But DFH has avoided this and provided us with a true nectar of the gods."

"Much thinner than I expected. No lacing at all, pretty flat. Color makes it look like unfiltered apple cider. Nose is fruitier than expected with a very slight hint of the chilies it is infused with. I thought the cocoa would be more forward (expected bitter chocolate flavor that wasn't there). Very different than what I thought I would get. I definitely enjoyed it but I'm not sure if I would get it again."
"Theobroma pours a darker golden color with a nice size head.  There is a big chili aroma, with just hints of sweetness from the chocolate.  Nice chili flavors, just hints of chocolate, nice warm from the spice.  Good blend of flavors, nice body.  Overall its very nice, easy to drink, good beer."
"Wouldnt mind a little more heat from the chilis. Amazingly balanced and unique."
""
""
"This is definitely not what I was expecting.  It was like a very watery Budweiser."
""
""
"Had this one at the DFH Alehouse on tap in Gaithersburg MD.  Very solid brew.  Don't really pick up the chile spices at all (no hotness).  This was a good thing as most chili spiced beers have been a deterent to me so far.  Recommend."

"	It's not how it looks, it's how it drives... An analogy I often apply to to choosing a bomber, but sometimes something is just too aesthetically intriguing to pass up, which is the case in point, and I ended up with the DFH's ""Theobroma..."" When I popped the cap, it seemed there was a fair amount of carbonation built up as the ""pop"" was mighty loud, but there was no foaming of any sort... It poured fairly light, with healthily active 2.5 inch head that's assisted by a decent amount of carbonation... It's a deep gold, almost orange, with quite a bit of sediment hanging about in there, but the beer itself isn't extremely hazy... The cocoa is the first aroma, but much lighter in presence than I had expected, as well as honey mixed amongst it also... A very light earthy, spicy bitterness hits the palate as the beer first enters your mouth, trailed by tastes that match the aromas... The cocoa isn't overbearing, and the beer is much more savory than I had assumed after pouring it... The finish is dry, but still very smooth as the ancho chilies give an amazing and extremely approachable amount of heat to the cocoa elements... The mouthfeel is great and acts as a fantastic platform to allow this beer to shine and accompanies each facet of the beer nicely... Overall this beer is surpassing my expectations on many levels, and I'm impressed at the amount of complexity this beer offers while still remaining extremely approachable to a variety of craft brew seekers... It's not how it looks, it's how it drives - and she drives quite nicely... Another great brew - Cheers!!"

"O: I expected the usual stylized Dogfish Head brew, rife with flavor and only subtle beer hints. What I got was the opposite, a chalky beer with only subtle hints of what was advertised. On the verge of being a bad beer. Don't know what happened here."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall- this reminds me most of a wheatwine or braggot.  The nose and palate are somewhat soft- but wow the palate is so softly complex.  I am a big fan of brews that use chilies peppers-espicially porters/stouts- but this one takes the complexity to a whole new level."
"Weighting: Appearance 15%, Smell 15%, Taste 35%, Mouthfeel 15%, Overall 20%"

"Wow, what an interesting beer. If you are in a beer store and need something that doesn't fit into any of the other styles this is it. A beer this color (blonde) has no right to taste like this. The is chocolate, peppers, yet smoothness. The cocoa hits first, but the finish is this hard to describe soft heat. Dogfish doing what it does best, making you rejudge every sip."
""
""
""
""
"Light chocolatey brown pour decent clarity, large  white head that dissipates relatively quickly. Very complex flavor, none of the individual components take the lead but they all work well together. Chili peppers provide sharpness but no burn and the beer has a boozy finish.  I expected a chocolate flavor which I didn't detect but overall I liked it!"

"A bit steep of a price, but I'm glad I tried it."

"Tap. Pours clear amber with a white head. Aroma of wheat and chocolate. Tastes of wheat, a hint of chocolate and chilies. Sweet aftertaste. Very unique beer. I liked it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Theobroma pours a dazzling copper hue, but with very little head, indicating a minimal amount of carbonation. As other reviewers pointed out, the aroma is faint, however there is a bit of cocoa powder detectable in a whiff of it. The high malt flavor pairs well with the cocoa, and the chilies blend in a similar way with the sharpness of the finish and the alcohol heat. With a medium mouth feel, this can sneak up on you however. Overall, worth a try and best shared."

"An extremely well balanced and well made beer. Pours a light amber with a clean crisp head. Smells of chilies faintly along with some notes of malt. The taste is well balanced with an excellent mouthfeel. It is creamy on the on the palate with a medium body. Excellent beer."

"Terrible- no chile or cocoa/chocolate. Tasted like a cross between a hefeweizen and Budweiser. Save your money for something else. Every Dogfish beer I continue to try I get more disappointed each time."

"This unexpected dfh ale is one of the most interesting that I have had the pleasure to taste. The appearance is a hazy golden color with a lasting white head and lacing. The nose is a subtle blend of sweetness, chile heat, and alcohol. I get nearly no chocolate or cocoa at all. The mouth is light and smooth, very sippable and enjoyable. The flavor is light and slightly European. There is a pleasant sweetness on the front and ancho heat on the tail. Still nothing present that I'd call chocolate. This is very good but nothing like id expect from the label. Dfh always keeps em good and interesting."

"O-not at all what I was expecting, but that turned out to be a good thing. I really enjoyed the chocolaty taste without the weight of a stout. And again one of the best smelling beers I've had. drinks very easy for a 9% beer. This beer is a perfect example of why I love Dogfish Head."

"Overall, not a bad beer, but I think I prefer my chocolate beers in stout form."
""
""
"Overall: A well disguised pepper beer! Not a lot of chocolate flavor which I came in expecting, just a pleasant tasty amber with a surprising finish. A fun, if expensive sipper."
"O - Theobroma keeps in line with Dogfish's unusual ancient beers but this high alcohol, sweet beer teeters on the edge of being cloying, thankfully balanced with a little pinch of chili heat on the finish. The chocolate aspect seems a little lost in the fray, only appearing as dusty, dried cocoa in small amounts."

"O- Say what you want, but DFH is one (if not the most) innovative large-scale American craft breweries and continues to deliver time and again. Theobroma is no exception and is my hands-down favorite offering from their Ancient Ales series (with Sah'Tea ranking as a close second). Furthermore, this also ranks highly on my list of all-time favorite beers. Even with almost 9 months of age, I absolutely love this beer. However, I will be anticipating its release in 2014 to experience this one fresh. 4.75"

"From the description I expected a dark beer and since I was sharing this with a friend, we were both surprised by the cloudy yellowish orange color. Taste was excellent really picked up the honey and the slight heat at the end. Didn't really pick up the cocoa but I think this is what was helping to give it a great balance in the flavor. Alcohol was very well hidden. Was very refreshing beer. And another example of the excellence of Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
"Pours clean with a light head that dissipates quickly. The nose gives notes of fruit and chilies. The flavor was of sweetened fruits, annatto and a subtle chili flavor. The chilies did not come through in the taste as they did in the nose but what did was very tasty. Cocoa flavors did not come through but the end result is a blend that makes a world class beer. I wish there was a bit more ""heat"" but even without it is well balanced a wonderfully brewed beer. Drinks well now and should age well over the next couple of years. Overall outstanding. I will be putting some in the cellar."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 4/29/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden amber color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of honey, toast, bread, cracker, orange, pear, apple, grape, nuttiness, herbal, floral, chile pepper, light cocoa, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and spice flavors; with good strength. Taste of honey, bread, cracker, orange, pear, apple, grape, toast, nuttiness, herbal, floral, light cocoa/chile pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light chile pepper heat on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, bread, cracker, pear, apple, grape, orange, herbal, floral, light nuttiness, light cocoa/chile pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick/creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice ancient ale style. All around nice balance of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV, A very enjoyable offering."

"From my tasting notes: It was light golden in color which was unexpected considering their use of cocoa powder and cocoa nibs. It had a distinct chocolate flavor as you would expect with a subtle chili burn on the finish. The beer avoided being an overpowering bomb of chocolate although slightly sweet and malty the flavors were well balanced and hid the high alcohol content. Dogfish Head managed to create a very original beer that was unlike anything I had tried before. It was definitely a sweet surprise!"

"This beer looks really cool when poured. It is a bright golden amber, slightly hazy with lots of sediment. My favorite part is there is non-stop rapid moving bubbles from every inch of surface of the glass that rapidly ascend and push up on the descending sediment making a rolling, turbulent effect in the glass as the two interact. Very enticing and fun to watch. Nice fluffy white head too. Smell is mostly bread, honey and chiles for me. Taste has lots of yeast and sweet honey. Faint flavor of cocoa that lends itself well to the texture. Leaves some lingering chile heat. Mouthfeel is moderate, carbonation milder than expected. It has a silky quality that compliments the chocolate flavors. Overall, a superb easy-drinker, some new flavor combinations here that are worth checking out!"
""
""
""
"Overall, Theobroma is a unique and heavy-duty drink, and one I'm glad to have experienced. Would I get another bottle? Likely not, unless I knew it was very fresh."
""
""
""
"I consider chile beers to be a novelty...and this beer to be very novel. It's not a beer to drink every day...but it's an amazing beer to try."

"O: An enjoyable beer that is different from the standard fare. Would have liked a bit more body and more of the chocolate/chile, but even then it was still well-crafted."

"Again, glad to try this experimental beer, but not a keeper in my mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting combination. The chocolate is so subtle it is hard to detect. The hot peppers are certainly obvious, but they are not too harsh. To me it lacks in malt backbone to support these diverse flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: I see in the description on the bottle and this site that they seem to be aiming for a chocolate-esque brew. Not really getting that, but that's not a bad thing to me. That's what chocolate stouts are for!"
""
"O: Overall I feel let down on this beer. I was expecting more complexity, to taste some cocoa, some chilies...and in the end I was left with an ordinary beer. To the regular beer lover I could probably recommend it if they could get past the price, but to the DFH eccentric I would say look elsewhere in their portfolio. I rated it as an ""okay"" beer because I felt it was good enough to drink and enjoy, but it wasn't anything past that."
"Excellent, complexed-flavored beer, not my personal style, but surprisingly addicting as the beer warms"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is spectacular. It has a medium body but drinks so lightly. It has every food that brings comfort, warmth and joy. It's full and earthy but retains an almost divine lightness. You could sip it all day and be warmed by it. The peppers are so well done as to be authentic but carefully presented so as not be like fire. Leave it to dogfish head to bring back a beer from 1200 BC and celebrate the culture and history of great people and great beer."

"Poured from tap into snifter at dfh in Fairfax VA. I don't know why but I thought this would be dark like a stout. Pours an orange color with very thin white lacing. Aromas of tart stonefruit, sweet belgian type yeast, and a hint of chocolate. Taste is really unique. ..like expected...sweet malty belgian type yeast with a nice tart chocolate backbone. The chile is subtle but it finishes with a tad bit of heat. Its a very well balanced unique brew. Very rarely do you find an experimental brew with such a balance. Really nice and well worth the price tag I see it going for in the store..but superb on tap."
""
"Fun! I liked this a lot. As always thanks Dogfish Head!"
"In the end, it's not bad, but not really interesting either. Not really spicy, but well crafted and decent drinking."

""

""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not really my style, but it's definitely worth a try. The 9% alcohol is well hidden."
""
""
""
"O - I was surprised by how light this beer was. I read that it had cocoa nibs and was expecting a darker brew. The pepper was also not as pronounced as I expected. The honey and floral aspects were nice. I guess I was more caught off guard by characteristics of this beer. I expected a dark, cocoa, pepper beer and got a light honey, floral, pepper beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very unique beer that is as complex as i have ever tried. Cocoa nibs and malt and spice lend itself to a very smooth drinkable liquid. Effervescence leaves early on but is necessary to bring out the true flavor profile. Especially good with a Padron Londres Natural cigar"

"O: It comes across a bit more mead-like than I was expecting, and it's perhaps a little too mild for its own good. However, it grew on me as I drank through the bottle. Seamless marriage of flavors and over the top smoothness are the shining points. Would be a nice change of pace as a digestif."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured from a bomber into a pint glass. The appearance was very nice. It is a bronzed orange color; which was very unexpected and it had a nice 1/2-3/4"" head with nice lacing. I loved the smell. It had a very spicy smell. I could smell the chilies. The chilies were also very apparent on first taste. At first I wasn't sure I liked the chili flavor but the subtle chocolate on the back end made it very nice. The spiciness also added to the mouthfeel of the beer. The tight carbonation with the spice of the chilies gave it a very zingy feel on the tongue which was surprising. Overall I think this beer was a big surprise from the pour to the finish, but it was a surprise I enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is another wacky beer-like creation from this brewer that assembles the elements of a distinct foodstuff to stuff in a glass and float a head on it. The ingredients are there, and it's a creative effort, but the blend just doesn't produce a good brew; I feel like I've been given some variety of Aztec medicine, instead."
""
""
""
""
"This is a unique beer. Lots of levels. Sweet and spicy. A nice dessert beer"
""

"Really quite tasty and one of the better of the strange range of Dogfish brews. I was happy to try it on tap."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"doing a joint review, not much time to do a proper review. very chili forward and baking cocoa powder. lots of spice. real interesting. the color is much lighter than expected. sweet caramel syrup, i taste something like pears in here. very chili forward - if you like some spice most definitely worth a shot. leaves the mouth coated. a sipper in my opinion, something to enjoy with good food."

"However, it does, especially in small portions, work well as a dessert beer, which is exactly what we used this for to great success. I actually admit that I was won over by this beer as I am a fan of spicy choco delicacies, but I would have NEVER been able to even finish half of a bottle by myself. It coulda made one helluva stout, but, hey, whatever. Somehow, this all worked together, and I think Calagione probably wants people to divide this thing as a digestif or something similar. This impressed me far more than Midas Touch, and I really hope to try others from this series. Pushes the boundaries of fermented barley beverages, as always. Very interesting stuff."

"O- not an everyday drinker, but a terrific beer for special afternoons. The chili peppers create a warming of the face and head while the subtle 9% alcohol warms the chest. Something in this ancient recipe still delivers the magic the Maya knew about 3000 years ago. An afternoon fades into laughter and relaxation. ""Theobroma"" means ""food of the gods""... I can see why the Maya thought this recipe should be reserved for their kings."

"O: Reading the label, I had expected a darker brew. To my surprise, it had a lighter malt which ended up playing in very well. There is a real nice complexity here and the chile is at a perfect level. Present, but not overkill. This is definitely one of the better chile beers I've had."

"Overall thoughts: From the way the beer is described on the label, having been brewed with cocoa powder and nibs, Askinosie Chocolate, honey, ancho chilies and annatto, I was expecting a dark beer, like a Mexican mole sauce, and the dark golden honey color totally surprised me and the surprises kept coming. I found this beer extremely complex and exceptionally good."

"Awesome story aside, this beer poured a hazy golden color, produced a thin white head and, featured average retention and it left some lacing behind. The aroma consisted of cocoa, spicy pepper and honey. Medium bodied, there is a foundation of cereal grains, sweet honey and dark fruit. Spicy pepper, nutmeg- smooth choclate and subtle hints of chilies. Beer warms at the finish-dry- Overall, awesome beer- I was expecting a bit more heat from the chili peppers but still highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a very interesting beer that begs you to ask where is the chilies in this beer? Then as the beer warms you go from a balance of sweet honey and chocolate to nice spicy chilies. An enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Complex flavors combine for a fun, chocolatey experience that makes this beer fun to drink. Different tastes come out with each sip. will definitely enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting brew with a story to tell, both in it's formation and on the palate. I'm trying this brew several months old and I wonder if the chocolate would be more apparent if I had the chance to drink this super fresh. This is definitely the best Dogfish's Ancient Ale series I have had the chance to try. Highly recommend for the adventurous beer enthusiast."

"3.5O: A very curious beer and one I'd be interested to have again.Lightly recommended for experimental drinkers, but not everyday fare or objectively great."
"O: Mild smell and flavor overall, but just the right amount of spice. Nice mouthfeel."
""
"i was kind of shocked when i poured this theobroma from dogfish head- because it has cocoa powder in it i assumed it would be a dark beer, it is actually light and a cloudy gold color. the smell is unassuming and milder thank you would think- its a lot more flavorful than the taste would lead you to believe. you can chocolate which isnt sweet at all and goes really goes really good with the bitterness of the beer. there is also some honey in here which doesnt over power the flavor, just makes it a little milder, that with the light carbonation actually makes this beer very drinkable."
""
""
"I'd been forewarned by bartender that this was not a dark beer. That was okay with me; I've enjoyed Sonora's White Chocolate Ale and it's also straw colored. My 4-ounce taster of Theobroma had that straw look with a bit of haze. I got no chocolate on the nose and no chocolate in the taste. But I got plenty of chile on the end in the back of my throat; I liked that part. Overall, though, it was not the most interesting thing I've had from DFH."
""
""
""
"I had been waiting an extended time to try Theobroma. Did I set my expectations too high? For a beer with a lot of chocolate elements, I was not expecting a golden colored beer with a slight white head. Honey notes were the most prominent in the aroma, with noting else really jumping out. In the initial taste, one detects mild chocolate, grape, and a slight sweetness. After a few sips, the heat becomes a little more noticeable at the back of the throat. Ancho chilies hold a little more promise for me, but the heat was very mild. In the aftertaste, one detects a grapey taste almost like grape soda. With all of the elements of this beer, I was expecting something quite different."

"750ml bottle: This one pours an almost clear, darker golden color. There was a small white head that didn’t linger long. Nice nose. A little musty to start. Some notes of honey and the cocoa. The taste is good. A bit of the cocoa on top, but not overdone. A faint amount of the peppers, but no heat or any real bite from them. A touch dry in the finish, and very smooth. Very nice."

"Poured from a crown capped large format bottle, a bit north of fridge temp, into a tulip. Liquor is medium amber, a bit hazy (maybe the bottle had been a bit disturbed), with a fairly small head that falls apart quickly. No lacing at all. Lots of very small bubbles racing to the top. The nose is a complex yet balanced amalgam of chiles, earth, and bitter chocolate, which follows through to the palate. A slight honey character comes through midway through, with a nutty roastiness showing up as well. The finish is dry, with a cocoa and dried chile note. Although this seems like it should be muddled, it somehow manages to achieve a nearly perfect balance. The chile flavor is obvious, but there is only the subtlest hint of heat. This is an outstanding, if very difficult to categorize, beer. Surprisingly drinkable."

"O: So much going on with this beer. It needs to be experienced, not consumed with a meal or as part of a tasting flight; this beer demands individual attention. That being said, it is an experience like no other. Leave your preconceived notions at the door."
""
""
""
"Poured entire bottle into 34oz mug. Clear gold with fizzy carbonation and a thick white head that dissipates very quickly leaving no lacing. Smell is rather flat; some of the sour yeast smell present in its sister brew, Sah'tea, is noticeable. Bitter cocoa over the malts, and perhaps a hint of twang from the peppers. Taste is sweet malts, cocoa and the taste pinches to a close at the back of the tongue where the chilies make their muted appearance. Not sure I'd notice them if I didn't know they were there. Still an enjoyable beer; hides the alcohol well for 9%, which is a bit insidious considering it comes in a 22oz bottle."
"O -This is a very unique beer for me and it took a few sips for me to truly appreciate it. I really love the spice of this beer and it is truly enjoyable to sip from a snifter."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. It has a golden color body with a 2"" white head that stays in tact for a while. The smell is strictly honey to my nose. The taste has a nice sweetntess from the honey up front then a little bit from the anchos comes along to finish it off. I don't really get any chocolate from it. The mouth feel is really nice, rolls off the tongue nice with just a little bit of the pepers on the back of the tonuge. Overall i really enjoyed this beer by DFH."

"I had been wanting to try this beer for a while, when i received it from a client at xmas. This beer pour beautiful, bright amber with a creamy off white head. the beer entered smooth with good carbonation. citrus nose with a soft chocolate taste. I waited for the heat from the chilies, after the third taste a mild tingle filled my mouth while the sweetness of honey rendered it helpless. We will have this one again Abv. 9.0"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, This was definitely something different. It wasn't particularly great, But it was good. Only complaint is that this beer actually seems to go flat pretty fast and I really wish the flavors would have exploded instead of staying predominantly subdued."
""
""
""
""
"O - My first thought was that a beer with peppers, cocoa, and ""ground annato"" might be potentially disturbing. I was wrong. The cocoa is not overpowering, and with the honey, balances out the chilies and spices really well. An interesting and well done offering from Dogfish."
""
""
""
""
"I treated myself to this for New Years Eve. Unfortunately I didn't make it due to the 3- 750ml strong ales I started with. So it's my New Years Day Ale. It has a nice chocolatey, citrus nose with a perfect balance of cocoa, chilies, and honey on the pallet. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is an interesting brew. Like a lot of DFH beers that I’ve had, it’s somewhat underwhelming after reading the explanation on the bottle. The cocoa is only subtly noticeable while the chilies seem to take the forefront. Even after looking at this as a chile beer, I’ve had better examples of the style. Nevertheless, it’s a tasty and drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My initial pour netted two fingers of foamy, fizzy French Vanilla-colored head with moderate retention. Color was a deep golden-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a spicy pepperiness that seemed to tickle the back of my throat. Mouthfeel was medium and the way that the spice was muted yet present and discernible was quite unexpected. I seem to remember it as much more pronounced but this was really pleasant. The chocolate seemed to get lost in the mix as I really did not perceive it until the extreme finish. The finish itself was dry, but not gaspingly so, as one might expect from the presence of chile. Good stuff!"
""
"Bottle is a 2010 vintage from my cellar. I drank it tonight to celebrate the world not ending and the Mayans being wrong after all. Poured into my DFH snifter. Carbonation definitely has diminished over the two years. Bright orange colored body, which was not what I expected from a beer brewed with chocolate. Smell was sweet. Taste was very interesting. The honey was really up front, followed by the hint of chili at the end. This beer is what would happen if DFH made a mead. Mouthfeel was smooth and dry. I give this beer extra points because it surprised me but I still liked it."
""
""
"Overall, a lot going on but I love it. The taste is all over the place, but I really enjoy it. I normally like to enjoy beer with a meal or snack, but I took this none by itself - it's like a savory dessert in a bottle! Will definitely try again and recommend to anyone looking for something new and exciting. Cheers!"

"one of the more interesting archeological dogfish brews. the pour is a really bright bronze color, with a lot of suspended spent yeast, looks like a snow globe. short white lace rests on top. the nose is sweet and floral from the honey, with a touch of smoke and spice from the ancho peppers, and some unique earthy character, which i can only imagine comes from those annatto tree seeds. the flavor really features the honey, theres a mild sweetness throughout, with some undertones of raw cacao, but no decadent chocolate to this at all, more of an organic bitterness like cocoa powder. the chili pepper flavor is very mild, and really only comes into play in the finish, providing just a touch of warmth, which combined with the alcohol actually produces a beautiful conclusion to this beer. the mouthfeel works, it could stand a little more carbonation i think, but the body is soft and round, plenty drinkable. definitely one of the better beers in this series of old world recreations."

"O- Nice beer, but nothing stands out. Definitely not chile-forward."
""
"Overall - I very much enjoyed this beer and look forward to having it again!"
""
""
""
"Full review here: http://bit.ly/UJV5gP"
""
"The aroma contains notes of chocolate chilies, grass, and some light pale lager aromas. It pours a slightly hazy amber with lots of fine sediment and a large yellow-tinged creamy head. The flavor starts with some light chocolate and sweet lager flavors. The chilies are noticeable in the background that slightly increases in the finish and mixes with some faint grassiness. Medium-bodied with light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm liking the idea of dogfish head ancient brew series, and I'm going to give this beer a nod of approval mostly because it tastes like nothing I've ever had before, the only down side is this beer was quite expensive in my neck of the woods, I don't know how it was priced elsewhere but here I was looking at over 15 for a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Disappointed overall...for a 'chile' beer brewed with herbs, spices and cocoa, I sure didn't get any chocolate character out of this. There is a nice sweetness that plays with the spiciness ever so slightly, but its almost too faint to mention."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not my style. Too much going on and not a fan of chiles in brew. Hot finish and I can't dectect the cocoa."
"I'm going to briefly describe this. Overall, the appearance is light and gold with little head. It smells very sweet but finishes with spice. I get sweetness and honey in the beginning with spice at the end. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated. Overall, it may be because I didn't know what to expect, but I feel like this beer isn't what I was expecting in a beer that came recommended. Average for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I tend to like the DFH experimental beers, but this one I'll pass on. It just seemed a bit of a mix-match that didn't do any one thing really good."
"Poured from a 25.4oz bottle into a large snifter. Nice amber, honey hue, with some cloudiness from the yeast. Modest amount of lace on the side of glass. Aroma is strong malt and almost winey. Strong alcohol overtones. Chile pepper becomes apparent in the flavor. Very sweet, not a highly hopped or floral beer. Some bitterness from chocolate nibs. Very robust mouth feel with some heat due to alcohol and peppers. Overall a very unusual and interesting beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: It's not everyday you see a light colored chocolate beer, so that's unique in itself. This is an all around interesting and likable beer. Would I drink it again? Maybe, if it was shared among friends or in otherwise small doses."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a really good beer and pleasantly sweet. A nice diversity of flavors, the cocoa wasn't very prominent in the taste but was more present in the nose. Nice beer I would buy it again. I'd say with a few exceptions I like Dogfish head's ""experiments."""
"Overall – This was a very tasty beer with nice flavor transitions a great flavor profile and a good easy drinking feel. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not knowing what the hell the name meant, I was stunned when the chocolatey taste hit my mouth, especially after the orange pour. It's a tasty beer and goes down smoothly at 9% ABV. Definitely grows on you as you dink it. Just finished the bottle and I am yearning for another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor wise it has more spicy pepper than chocolate going on, its on the medium level viscosity wise with a balanced amount of carbonation. Its spicyness stacks in between sips kind of like bitter hops and eventually overpowers all that was cocoa in the flavor."
""
""
""
"Overall this unusual beer is well worth trying, even going a little out of your way for. Sip it, ponder it and enjoy this food of the gods."
""
""
""
"O: Just an all around amazing beer. I was expecting for this to have a chocolate style flavor, but I really dont get any of that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was excited to try this beer since I love chocolate and spice, but it ended up being a little dissapointing. All I got initially was honey. A sweet, subtle beer, but the chile only came through as the beer got warmer. The chocolate never materialized. Glad I tried it once, but won't be getting it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall... A nice enjoyable beer, but it gets a bit overwhelming in its flavors after the first few sips. Although the individual components of the beer are great, they don't really come together to form a beer that you will relish. Sometimes simplcity is better than the highly complex nature of this beer. I think this beer needs more time and effort to be perfected or at least improved upon."
""
""
""
""
"D- for a brew of such strength and odd nature, this is solidly drinkable. Between the alcohol, chile, and cocoa I'm feeling an absolute sense of euphoria right now. It's almost inspiring. The mesoamerican nobility must have been running around like crazy fools if they were gettin high on this stuff. It belongs in a snifter or narrow-mouthed tulip to concentrate the nuanced aroma and hell, quite frankly next time I'll treat it like scotch. I'm usually not a fan of DFH's recreation of ancient brews but this one is a straight banger."
""
""
""
"Overall a confusing brew. Nice taste but can think of so many other better strong ales/and or chocolate/cocoa brews I prefer. Won't buy again..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Dogfish is easily one of my personal favorite breweries, and the Ancient Ales series is a really interesting idea, so as a result I was very disappointed in this beer. I expected a lot and had been putting off trying it for some time while it wallowed in my fridge. Perhaps I built it up too much. Be that as it may, it is an above average beer. The chili aspect is superbly done, and the chocolate is not cloying by any means. All of the flavors and aromas are just too muted. Subtlety is nice when dealing with strong flavors such as chili and chocolate, but it can be taken too far. This beer is an example of where a little more bravado would have been welcomed. Perhaps a “crazy” brewer like Three Floyds, Brew Dog, Cigar City, or Mikkeller could have taken this idea further by putting everything over the top. Perhaps Southern Tier could have emulated this ancient style better with their impossibly accurate imitations. Whatever the case, this is a beer to try if you are into the style (chocolate-chili beer) or into Dogfish Head or into, more specifically, their Ancient Ales series. Otherwise, do not waste the money on this one. 14.5/20"
""
""
""
"Overall: these ancient ales are hit or miss but I think Dogfish pulled it off on this one. It's a grower though; don't expect Theobroma to blow you away. Let it appreciate."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Recommend sharing unless you like heat, because this brings it more than a Stone offering, for example. Always like to try out whatever new idea Dogfish Head is offering."
""
""
""
"Tastes like straight Natural cacao. Sweet, Chcoloate but not roasty. Thick and luscious. Great beer. Really enjoyed this."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas. Not quite what I expected from a Chile beer but it's my first time trying it, plus it's Dogfish so you know it wasn't brewed to standards."
"Good beer but something ya gotta share, it's a stomach ache waiting to happen."
""
"Overall, this is a nice beer. It's a different flavor and so it's interesting, but I don't love it. It's worth drinking, and I'd drink it again,"
""
""
""
"O: This beer is pretty much exactly as described. Pretty much pure chocolate and chile heat with a hint of honey and perhaps that annatto in the finish. Don't be expecting a big roasty chocolately porter or stout. The chocolate isn't that big, it's some nice cocoa that's balanced with the chile. No real vegetal pepper flavors either, just the spicy flavor and heat. Definitely a must try if you like chocolate/chili beers. This is one of the best."
""
""
"O- Nice treat. Very balanced, much like a mole sauce, though its components are a little more discernable. While I drank it on its own, it would probably be a nice accompaniment to a full/bold cheese, BBQ, or spicy dish. I would love to drink this with regularity if not for a hefty price tag (13.49) for the big bottle."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter, bottled 2012. This pours a hazy orange copper color with a large off white head. The smell is a little sweet, with some chilies. The feel is medium decent carbonation. The taste is different but good, I definitely get the chili, a little sweetness."
""
""
""

"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a bright orange amber with a nice thick, long lasting head that leaves light lacing. Spicy light fruit aroma. Nice medium bodied light fruits and spices, similar to a tripel. Nutty and semi-sweet. Reminiscent of a tripel in the middle and finish with the chiles lightly making themselves noticed. I tasted more pleasant malty tones as it warmed up. I liked the flavor and spicing. Must have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very interesting beer which changes quite a bit as it is enjoyed. One of the better ones of the series."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the best chile beer I've had to date. It is complex, interesting, and profoundly delicious."
""
""
"As I'm not real familiar with this particular style, my rating is mainly based on my personal experience with the brew during my visit at the brewpub last night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love beers like this, and DFH seems to be the master: their ancient ales line is brilliant, and this beer is excellent; really interesting to get such a distinct cocoa taste in a pale ale. Categorized as a ""chile beer""? Weird, but what else are you gonna do with a brew as wonderfully unique as this, other than buy it and drink it?"
""
"Another fascinating little brew from Dogfish Head. I love how blatant the chilies become in the mouth and throat. Still too leaning on fruity Belgian yeast strains. Works just fine for me, the spice-lover."
""
""
""
""
"O-Not a heavy hitter like other DFH beers. Surprised how subtle the flavors are considering how the main ingredients have such strong flavors on their own."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-overall an interesting blend of flavors, but would have like to see more of a chile presence here to balance the cocoa and honey more"
""
""
""
""

"I tried this on my porch one august with a friend,drank it swig for swig out of the bottle, medium carbonation, nice mouthfeel, the chocolate is definetly apparent, along with the spice.I loved it , I got it in a growler some time later, and it was cold, I wouldn't reccomend drinking it cold, due to the fact that the taste went from sweet and complex, to sweet & tasty ,yet the flavor did not come through as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer surprised me most and to me had the best concept of any of the chili beers that night. The combination of honey and heat is very complimentary and makes for a pretty unique beer."
""
"O: I'll bet this is better fresh. It'd have to be, as it's just ok now - about eighteen months or so in the bottle. Not enough heat, yet not easy drinking enough to put back more then a few ounces at a time. Decent, yet underwhelming."

"The quality and the craftsmanship in all the DFH beers are evident and they remain true here. I did not particularly enjoy the aroma but the beer promised everything that was on the label and highlights honey without just being a plain mead. Chiles and cocoa are a nice match, really had to concentrate to get all the complexities out of this one but well worth it."
""
"Overall: Aside for lack of aroma this beer is on the border of greatness. Has almost everything, granted when you think about who gives a F'ck when it comes to smelling taste alone beer wins it all. Salud!"

"Overall: I'm not one to exclaim exaggerations about beer. I usually tell it like it is, and I've got to say, this is one of the best beers I've ever encountered! It's just so seamless and exciting, while retaining a historical blueprint. It's like discovering the past but in a tactile way. DFH you've really outdid yourself this time! I applaud you on this off-centered, but wholly grounded beer. Thank you."

"Medium sweet malt in the nose, along with earthy hops, light cocoa, a sweet eastern smelling spice (annatto?), and a light toastiness. Cocoa is very subtle in the taste and reminds me more of the powder than the nibs, and I find it best after I take a sip and breathe out very quickly. Also in the taste is some belgian yeastiness and a dry, medium-hot alcohol that I associate with brewing with honey since it ferments so completely. Speaking of dry, a little dry on the palate, but overall a fine experimental brew, though I can see why it may be too subtle for some (especially at $9-$15 / bottle depending where you shop/availablity)"

"Verdict: This is definitely an enjoyable brew, but a bit lacking when it comes to the special ingredients. Interestingly enough I found the grain elements to most enjoyable. Certainly an enjoyable brew, but probably not one I’d buy again."
"I recommend having something to drink for your throat every so often. Without that, my throat got a little itchy."
" This beer pours a deep golden hue with a slight head that disappears rather quickly. I might be a little stuffed up but there is almost no smell to this beverage. A slight malt presence at the front with a nice honey finish. Pretty disappointed in this one just based on the description from the bottle. You would never know that there was any form of cocoa (let alone 2!) or chilies. Glad these guys continue to push the boundaries, but kind of missed on this one."
"Overall I found this to be my least favorite of the ancient ales so far. It kind of seems like DFH was trying to either play this one safe, or make it different than people would expect, but it just turned out to be pretty boring."
"Like most of the ancient ales, Theobroma has a cool origin story. Unlike the others, this one carries a consistently mediocre rating. I don’t think it’s as bad as some, but it’s definitely not as complex as the myriad ingredients would suggest."
"D: Unique, that's for sure. The mix of the darker chocolate flavors and peppers are interesting, and something I might wanna try in a more full-bodied malt based beer. Worth a shot, but may not be something you want to visit often."
"Very crisp beer, really enjoyed it, looking forward to tasting more of these ""rare"" or ""ancient"" beers from the good people at Dogfish Head"
"Overall: Sometimes, with all the funky ingredients, all Sam's ""ancient ales"" begin to taste alike. I think of it more as a series of variations on one beer i.e. Chateau is ""Ancient Ale - Rice"" and Immort Ale is ""Ancient Ale - Honey"". This is ""Ancient Ale - Hot Pepper", but its actually a nicely complex and remarkable original beer."
"I like this.. but I think I will need to drink it again maybe out of a bottle next time to get more out of the flavors I was expecting.. Still a great session"
"I dunno... tough call on this one because it's really quite different than most beers I try. I will say that I like it and I'd definitely drink it again."
"Opinion: It is hard to say that I was disappointed in this beer, but I was a little disappointed in this beer. I expected the noted elements to be a bit more bold. That said, it is stated on the bottle that this is a replication of a derived historical recipe. If the historical elements were reserved, it may be better to state that in the verbiage so that you expect it to be subtle. I am being nit-picky here, but from the text on the bottle to the taste in my mouth is a disconnect. Kinda like what Obama SAID he would do and what he is actually doing...but it isn't quite THAT extreme. This beer has some of the elements it professes to have, but they are subtle."
"On tap at Mr. Goodbar's. Golden body. Expected hotter peppers but it was muted, more cinammon and cloves. Little head. More like a roobis tea with flavouring addd to a beer. So-so drinkability. Not for everyone. Average mouthfeel. Might be better on cask."
"D: I don't understand this beer. Do not want to be too harsh since I'm not an avid chile beer drinker but c'mon. DFH beers always explode with flavor and this one simply comes up short. Not for me and as a bartender, I would sadly not recommend this one."
"Theobroma is a crystal clear, deep golden brew with a head that vanishes instantly. It smells a little sweet, floral and wooden with notes of honey and herbal tea. It's pretty full bodied, quite smooth and slick. The finish is a little slippery. It's not really sweet at all. It's pretty warming and a little resiny. There is something kind of malt liquorish going on early in the taste. There may be a little DMS in there as well. Bitterness comes at the end in the form of raw chocolate. It's pretty unusual. Yeah, it tastes pretty strange. This is a very bizarre beverage and I'm not really into it... but it was worth a try."
"I thought I liked this beer more last year, maybe this years batch is different? Not sure."
"Spicy in the mouthfeel and the taste. Lots of flavors swirling around the palate, some were hard to identify. I got a definite kick from the peppers, adding a slight heat to the beer. The cocoa was not sweet at all, but instead had a bittering effect, especially combined with some light hop tastes. A faint honey sweetness rounded the taste out evenly for a nice balance all the way through. Boozy in the aftertaste and feel, with a slight kick that combines nicely with the peppers. All told, its an interesting beer, very complex and tasty. Great to analyze and try to identify the flavors, but also nice to just sip on and enjoy."
"I am a huge fan of this beer and I plan on picking up more at every opportunity. Dogfish head is a fun brewery and experiments with a lot of recipes, often with mixed results, but this is one they got right!"
"An oddity overall, at times it tastes something like the clay pots the recipe was found on. Had Dogfish Head dialed down some of the annatto that might have helped, but as it is I can't say I'm a fan."
"overall: very easy to drink because it is neither offensive nor alcoholic, but it just isn't all that memorable so why buy another?"
"The aroma was heavenly. Rich cocoa layered upon warm roasted coffee with touches of chili and sice are what comes across at first. Warming though brings out all the subtleties and richness that I would have come to expect. Cinnamon and vanilla and fighting it out to provide a hint of sweetness and character. Each sip seemingly more complex then the one before. It is literally just a bath in warm, malty flavors"
"This beer pours a dark, very cloudy and syrupy looking orange in color with a slight white head that quickly dissipated to lace my snifter. It features aromas of sweet malts, oranges, honey, sweet flowers, spices, herbs, mango?, and wit characteristics. It's pretty sweet on the nose. The chile and chocolate are non-existant. The flavors are very sweet and more on the fruited, imperial wit side of things. It is very fruity and malty. It has light floral, spice, and honey characteristics. It doesn't feature any chile or chocolate. It drinks thick and syrupy which is an odd fit. This beer at this point is misleading. I had fond memories of this one but I don't remember it being like this. Perhaps this one fades too much with age. Regardless, the artwork is still one of my all-time favorites."
"Nose is Honey, cocoa, some chili, some malt. Very sweet smelling- improves and opens up greatly when it warms up to room temperature. Interesting... I actually dig the taste of this beer. Honey is in there, with cocoa and chili, hops, and some malt, w/ spices in the background. Nice sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full, and sweet. Not dry at all. Alcohol is completely absent in the taste. Overall, this beer surprised me. I wasn't expecting to like it after reading the reviews, but it's unique, and fairly tasty. Almost reminds me of a braggot. Recommended if you're looking for something different, and open to trying new brews. Cheers!"
"I had this on tap at the Hop Leaf. The description looked interesting and it fulfilled expectations in that regard. The color is a deep, almost lager-like gold. The aroma is spicy and complex. The taste is very complex; honey and fruit but bitterness from something; finishes with a wonderful cocoa taste. The mouth-feel is smooth and nearly creamy. This is a very good beer; its originality earns it extra points."
"Sip this one slowly and don't be afraid to let it warm up and breath just a bit before you drink. I know I'll be coming back for more, this is on damn good beer."
"O: Interesting. Worth a try. Not the best drinkability, split the 750ml bottle three ways and a third was about good enough for me. The abv is pretty well hidden."
"O: I optimistically judged this book by it's cover and ended up a bit disappointed. While I understand and applaud the effort behind recreating this ancient ale, I think the story behind it would have been better left as a ""Did You Know?"" segway just before a commercial break of a Discovery Channel special. I do very much appreciate that no other brewery than DogfishHead would have the balls to produce and release this into distribution."
"O: Glad I tried it. This is a decent beer. I doubt I will order it again, but I may give it another try next year if they release it again."
"When I first picked up this beer and read the description of it on the label I assumed it was going to be a dark beer. Turns out I was completely wrong and it poured out as a really vibrant orange color. I can only assume that this beer has more surprises in store for me. The smell of the beer had some earthy chocolate aromas coming off of it. I wasn't able to pick up much Chili pepper on the nose though. The taste of the beer gives off that same bitter earth chocolate note with just a hint of the pepper in the background. It's a very subtle chili beer, not one of those that is undrinkable because it's like drinking fire. The mouthfeel of this brew has a good thickness to it much like DfH's big bottles. Overall I really enjoy this beer quite a bit, I don;t buy it too often but I feel like I want to have it again sometime soon."
"This was a fantastic beer, and Dogfish Head has impressed me once again."
"T: Apricot with some honey, a slight bit of dark chocolate, caramel and a touch of malt. Pretty nice. I was hoping for a bit more out of the chiles and chocolate."
"Several reviewers have likened this creation to chili-infused chocolates. While some of the basic characteristics are indeed similar, this brew elevates the combination to an entirely new level. I highly recommend this brew - and that's not the hobby anthropologist in me being duly enthralled with the basis for the creation of this brew talking either."
"Glasswear: 750ml bottle poured straight into Goblet"
"O: I have never had a beer that compares to this one. It is one of a kind and will set the bar for those who wish to recreate it. I am absolutely in love with this brew. Thank you dogfish for yet another amazing beer."
"Total scores averaged as my final review score."
"Another experimental ancient ale from Dogfish, and again, I think this one is probably more interesting to read about than actually drink. That being said, I'm glad I tried it and it's definitely enjoyable enough, though I doubt I'll be trying it again anytime soon."
"Price = $11.99 at Whole Foods (NYC)"
"Well worth a try - part of what makes craft brews so amazing. Taking risks, willingness to experiment and just treating a brew like it is a food - is something that I truly appreciate. This one is another success from DFH. Not an everyday brew, but absolutely something I will be looking forward to - especially as my single bottle empties into my glass."
"Overall: This beer isnt at all what I was expecting. It is pretty good. I guess I was expecting a little more spicy chile flavor."
"Never would have guessed this for a chile beer! I found it refreshing after a longish walk on a sunny afternoon."
"O - Hard to place, but good. I liked this one."
"overall: very unique, like their Midas Touch, Dogfish has succeeded again experimenting with a style that is very complex yet complemented, good abv and very drinkable."
"Overall- Not at all what I was expecting, but I can’t complain about the flavor. I’ll probably end up picking up another bottle if it’s still around."
"Overall- Great beer. This is something I picked that would have shocked me if if I didn't enjoy it. I've seen ratings all over the place for this beer. Give it a shot and decide for yourself. "
"Overall: Based on what the label says this beer is an absolute failure the flavor does not coincide with the ingredients total waste of money"
"I enjoyed this beer, and would seek it out again. Quite unique!"
"Overall, a very satisfying beer. DFH does a great job blending the unique flavors to create a well-balanced, intriguing beer."
"This is a nice brew from DFH, I love that they try everything and I have yet to be disappointed. Another winner from DFH."
"I was expecting this to be a darker chocolaty color, pours a light honey amber with a decent foamy big bubbled head. No lacing, leaves the glass clean. The nose is powdery cocoa & honey. Very dry chocolate flavor, with earthy honey comb soaked in. I'm guessing its the chiles providing a bit of spiciness in the back of the throat. Finishes very dry. Think I'll let my next pour warm considerably. Quite interesting."
"Taste the honey and spices and a bit of spiciness, along with a touch of alcohol on the way down in the back of the palet. Very complex and well balanced although I did not pick up any cocoa at all from the beer. A very tasty and balanced beer that is very drinkable."
"Complicated flavor here. I enjoyed it and now I'd love to have a picked up a bottle when I had a chance a few weeks ago."
"This is a pretty interesting brew. The spices are all well balanced. The only disappointment for me is the lightness. The lightness of flavor is fairly consistent among all of the Dogfish Head brews."
"overall, i'd try this again. as i mentioned there was nothing spectacular here, no wow factor, but it was pleasing."
"O: Cold, this beer is not terribly unlike Midas Touch. A lot of similarities are present between the two initially, but this beer is much better overall. Wish I didn't wait so long to finally go for this one."
"**The novelty of the beer was very cool, but the taste experience was not. I'm sure I will still find this beer intriguing when passing it on the shelves but I hope I resist the temptation to try what's inside again...just not worth it"
"Another interesting offering by DFH. This had hints of cocoa, chiles, and other spices. I had this prior to a bottle of Sah'Tea the other evening and it definitely makes you arch an eyebrow. I'm thinking this would be a better suited beer for the cold weather months, but it's good anytime. Nice thick mouthfeel. I wouldn't seek this out regularly, but I'll definitely drink it again."
"This beer has a very complex taste and is justtt delicious! Try it if you get it a chance!"
"Overall, this beer is very good. It looks nothing like I would expect it to given the nose and flavor. It is another great beer from Dogfish Head."
"O--This is a tasty brew. I was hesitant based on the description, but this was a really strong ancient ale from Sam and the guys at DFH. I would revisit, but not often."
"-Cheers"
"The mouthfeel is fairly full, yet highly carbonated. The drinkability is very good, especially considering the ABV. I'd honestly peg this as a 6% brew as opposed to a 9% one. Overall, this is an interesting beer. I'm glad I bought this one bottle to try, but doubt I'll be a repeat customer."
"O: The ingredients used in this are some of the best I've heard of for a beer. I was expecting something dark, creamy, spicy with a paired cocoa kick that mellowed into a honey finish. Instead I feel like I got pranked by having such good ingredients tossed into what to me is basically a lager. Really terrible match, really difficult to drink and enjoy. This was very close to a drainpour but I managed to finish my glass. I gave this a small score bump because of the originality."
"It’s a complex and strange brew, not bad tasting but not something I’d order normally."
"mouthfeel - nice and smooth, quite refreshing, not getting 9 percent at all here. very drinkable. a bit light in body for what i was hoping for"
"Not a typical in your face Dogfish Head product, but another enjoyable one nonetheless."
"The 9% alcohol is well-hidden on the palate, though it doesn't hide itself in the head. Rather like Midas Touch in overall character with an every-so-faint hint of cacao in the nose and on the palate, Theobroma stands as an excellent brew and (assumedly) a nice re-creation of an ancient style, but could perhaps use some tweaking to bring out more of the cacao flavor and to differentiate it a bit from the brewery's more widely-available and sadly overly-similar offering, Midas Touch."
"O - Overall, interesting. This pulls in alot of different directions and I think it was close to pulling it off. The sweet of the honey, along with some backing from the cocoa and chile, created quite a complex flavor. However, I would have liked to have that spice just one tick higher."
"I drank the whole 750ml bottle to myself - not recommended. Find another person to split with. Unfortunately my girlfriend wasnt too fond of this one."
"O-the chile and cocoa seems to down played on this. i feel like this is just a really boring beer. i feel sorta upset with DFH on this one. they present it as such a special beer, but more than anything, this is just a large disappointment."
"Overall hands down this would be the best representation of a chile beer as it is fairly spicy but not so much to ruin session ability. A great one off beer, too bad it's around 10-12 dollars a bottle. If you can get it cheap pick it up!"
"O: This is an excellent beer that should be truly appreciated. Unlike some of the other higher ABV Dogfish has this is very well flavored to hide the strong alcohol. This might also be perfect for someone who doesn't care for the DFH hoppier beers. Would purchase again with no reservations."
"I was expecting to not like this beer. I was halfway intending to hate it. But actually, I like it. It's the strangest thing. It's pleasant. Maybe not worth the dollar value (though I may have overpaid), but it's certainly good enough to drink."
"Salud!"
"O - Certainly an interesting beer, this one is savory, complex and does impart thoughts of ancient times."
"I think people are tough on this one because of what they want it to be, and not what it is. Would I have liked more cocoa? Maybe, but I didn't brew this. Great balance and subtleties, but subtle is the word. The marketing of this pisses people off, as they expect deeper ingredient flavors. Try this with an open mind. I'd have this again. And again."
"O: This is a good chile beer that doesn't try to make itself any more than that. The cocoa adds a nice complexity but it is definitely in the background, and the honey adds some nice sweetness. Not quite sure what the annatto adds to the beer, but it doesn't really matter"
"O: Not the beer I was expecting -- but in a good way. I've been swayed to pick up a few bottles, and I'll be curious to see what 6 months on the shelf will do to one of them."
"I was excited to try this one and to be honest, really wanted to like it. I just found it too sweet for my taste. I did enjoy the back and forth between the honey sweetness and the pepper/spice but it was just a bit too heavy on the sweetness. The low amount of carbonation didn't help. So there were elements I enjoyed but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again."
"Overall: It's an interesting beer, to say the least, and I would be happy to try it again. I wonder how it would do with a bit of age on it, considering the slightly higher ABV of 9%, but I'm also not sure how the other flavors would hold up over time."
"I would def. drink this beer again."
"Overall, this is great. As I said, very similar to Midas, and the drinkability is unfairly (dangerously) high, given the price point, rare availability, and ABV. Pretty universal as far as food pairings go, incredibly versatile."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Overall. I feel like this is a complex beer but feels slightly watered down.  I like the chocolate and chile flavors but could have used more. it was a bit sweet though. It is a decent beer though and nice to try a different style"
"Not more than a one finger head from this pour, with little lace, and less cling. Color is a 9 on the SRM beer color chart, with lots of carbonation action. Smell is very complex, with aromas of honey, coco, peppers, nutmeg, cinnamon, malt, and lemon peel. Taste is a bit of a shock, but very good after a couple of samples. Flavors of chili peppers, coco, honey, nutmeg, cinnamon, malt, coffee, and lime. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and crisp. It leaves a little drying on the back of my soft palate, maybe more like numbness. This beer is nothing like I have tasted before, and it really grows on you. It is quite pricey, but I am glad I bought this one."
"Upon seeing the beer in the glass: ""Are you sure this is the Theobroma?"" Pours a straw-yellow hue, crystal-clear, and is capped with a bit of creamy white head. The nose is strange but fairly pleasant, showing mostly notes of honey, with faint traces of white chocolate and a spiciness similar to green cardamom. The taste delivers more cocoa flavor, again in the white chocolate spectrum. Honey flavor is appreciated, though the brew is not tremendously sweet. The pepper is not discernible in either aroma or flavor. As to the feel, it is just a tad under medium in heft and somewhat refreshing. Overall, this is an interesting brew and is easy enough to drink, but it is not some radical creation, nor a Chile Beer as far as I can taste; it is more like a Cream Ale with frills."
"Overall again worth trying no going to be a regular though."
"Overall: This is probably my favorite of their ancient ale series. There is a nice complexity and it is not overly sweet like their other beers in the series."
"overall this is ok its no sah'tea though"
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. The flavor profile is very complex and unique. I can honestly say that I have never had a beer that tasting at all similar to this Dogfish Head offering. It is a good brew for it's uniqueness, but not sure it is something I would pick up very often."
"Pours a light orange with yellow tints and a frothy white head. A very bubbly and inviting beer. The smell is weird, but great very inviting with many different things: the chili, sweetness, honey, cocoa and a hint of malt. Starts with the chili up front with a strong mix of flavor in the middle with some sweetness and a long chili finish. The mouthfeel is lighter, high carbonation, very smooth. This is a beer that exemplifies pushing the limits of flavor but still staying good. Not a beer I could drink a ton of in one sitting, but still tasty and interesting. A good breakout from the norm, worth trying."
"Another beer from DFH that I can't imagine drinking a whole lot of, but an interesting, impressive beer nonetheless."
"Overall: a very interesting beer that is best as a one glass per session beer."
"Overall: This beer was a treat I shared with a good friend. I think it was a very interesting beer that I was super excited to try and share. I would definitely purchase this offering again. Great, interesting taste, nice color, and great exotic spice, chocolate, and sweet tones."
"O: Another interesting beer from dogfish head. It had a nice spice to it for a chile beer. One of their better ones that I have tried."
"O - Like a history lesson in a bottle. They brewed based on what was available. Good because I'm reading a book about Pre-Columbian civilizations right now. I'd recommend reading the book while drinking this. I think it's so cool that they can detect the items that go into this ancient brew. I'd expected a rich wallop of flavors, but this was more subtle and sophisticated. Just a little thin for my liking."
"Drinkability is solid. Definitely could have been better. Not as interesting as I had hoped, but it's nice to drink a part of history."
"O- Still trying to wrap my head around this one. One thing I love about Dogfish head is their willingness to push the envelope. I respect the ambition. While this is absolutely one of the most unique beers I've tried. It's one i might not go right back to."
"Well like my flavor review states, very off-putting. I can see the value in this beer, it's kind of cool, just not working with my tastebuds too much."
" Almost to say, this beer drinks as if it is programmed."
"O - Overall the this is an okay beer. I think I drank it past its prime though as the chili has definately mellowed out, perhaps too much."
"Overall: I love Dogfish Head's creativity. This one is nice and complex. I love the deep cocoa taste that mixes with peppers. This is the most cocoa taste I have had in a beer in a while and the best beer I have had in a bit. I would like a bit more pepper taste for a chili beer, but overall the taste is amazing. Worth the money, I would drink it more if it were a bit cheaper."
"Got a goblet at Liberty St. Tavern for $6. The beer was smooth for the strength, but not the complexity of a big beer. It comes off like a thicker take on a chocolate amber ale, a bit like the Kelso chocolate lager. There's a little more peppery spice to it, but the earthy cocoa and smooth caramel malt dominate. Worth a try."
"Overall a quality brew from DFH that I now want to try fresh to see if the chili flavor comes through. Different, but good beer."
"O: I wish the aroma/flavors were a bit stronger, the cocoa was almost non-existent. Its good, just not my favorite."
"O - I personally did not like this one. An interesting beer to say the least, but just not my cup of tea."
"Taste has some cocoa, corn graininess, syrupy honey and a touch of heat from the peppers...really not much of a chile flavor though. I am really surprised at how much I like this beer, one of the best DFH beers I have had. Subtle, complex flavors really challenge the palate...a thinking man's beer!"
"Drink- I have wanted to try this one for a while. My wife got it for my birthday and I am glad she did. Split with a buddy who I am trying to get to enjoy all types of beer. I would have this one again."
"D-Overall this was an interesting beer. Was expecting more heat and chili flavor. It was more like a honey beer. After having 3 or 4 glasses your lips do begin to fell slighty and i mean slighty on fire so i get the chili towards the end of the beer. but its mostly honey at the top and middle of the beer. A drinkable and good beer. was not dissapointed"
"Pours a slightly cloudy reddish amber with a fleeting head that leaves very little lacing. Smell is almost sour/chemically with nutty notes and slight caramel aroma. Taste is better with more hints of notes, light mexican chocolate, caramel malts and finishes with the slightest of mild chile heat. Tastes somewhat sweet and honeyed like jiahu but the abv is completely unnoticable. Very disappointed as this beer is about a year old and seemed off with with the sour/chemical aroma and taste."
"Poured unexpectedly light, as a hazy amber-brown with a white head. Malty nose with some spice and just a touch of coffee and cocoa. Taste is pretty mild, good hop/malt balance, but unfortunately, I detected very little of cocoa and chili, which are supposed to be the signature ingredients. Chocolate was just barely present in the background. Medium mouthfeel with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Not too impressed with this beer, but it was somewhat drinkable, and I'd like to sample it again."
"D-An interesting beer that I give DFH credit for making. However I'll pass on this next time and go with something new."
"O: Did not enjoy this one. Felt like I needed to drink it with a straw to get it done and over with. Husband drank mine and he enjoyed it, but the honey flavor was way too strong for me. I would never get this again. It did not taste like it said on the label."
"O: Didn't think I liked this one but it quickly grew on me. Not something I would go out of my way to find but I have another bottle in the cooler so if I saw it I would probably grab another bottle or two."
"o: very good beer. I don't think i can drink the whole one on my own as it is quite rich. It's like eating a cake on your own. very good, but 25 oz is too much of a good thing. would buy again...wish it sold in smaller bottles."
"D: meh. Not one i will be revisiting on my own accord."
"Overall, a unique and interesting but not particularly enjoyable beer. Not something that I would have again."
"O (D) - Interesting and complex, good drinkability, especially considering the alcohol"
"Overall: This beer is fine nothing objectionable, but does not stand out either."
"Overall, not exactly what I was expecting, but a very unique and enjoyable beer."
"D. Not bad, not my favorite, worth trying, but not the end of the world. Interesting, guess I was expecting bigger, bolder flavor and aroma from this experimental brew."
"Into a DFH pint glass this settles a clear orange rust/light amber color with no head but a noticeable carbonation. The aroma yields a mild and interesting exotic mix of earthy sweet fruit, cocoa, and light peppery spices. The mouthfeel, for the most part, is a sweet malt one with noticeable notes of honey, annatto spice, and cocoa (all as proclaimed on the bottle). Finish is dry, lightly spicy and pure cocoa accented. And of course, cheers to a wondrously hidden abv..."
"D - Glad I split the bottle. Not that it's bad, it just wasn't impressive or memorable. Ehh."
"Drinkability is good, 9% ABV?! could have fooled me. I would have never guessed, this is a nice and interesting beer, I just wish there was more chili flavors."
"The CPJ"
"Pours an orangish almost golden with a good amount of white head. Smells very strongly of honey and sweet malts. There is no real chili on the nose. Tastes very sweet and honey strong. Some subtle chili initially but as I drink more the chili comes out a bit. The mouthfeel is pretty thin and not that nice on the palette. Very drinkable but its a bit lacking for the mouthfeel I think. Pretty tasty though. The more you drink the more the chili hits"
"D. Drinkable, but not super exciting."
"Sharp feel, but necessary due to the complexity."
"Well an interesting brew to say the least. I'm personally not a big fan of hot foods so I may struggle to finish this bottle...wish there was more chocolate as that would be a saving grace for my palate."
"I have to say Theobroma is interesting and tasty but I was expecting more from it. I'm not exactly sure of what I want from it. I guess it would be more flavor. Theobroma is another beer from Dogfish Head that is experimental, and that is something I respect about the brewer, but I feel like Theobroma could be ""more"" in some way."
"Tasting the beer I was pleasantly surprised! A very fresh feel, probably due to the pretty high carbonation. But what really got me was the mild sting of chili, balanced perfectly with honey flavors. In the middle some malty taste with hints of cacao. At the end some hops will keep the abundance of taste in check and round the brew up. At the second glass you will feel the alcohol kicking in. A very interesting approach of brewing. Great job!"
"Pours a transparent gold with good head and minor lacing. A mild aroma of leafy spices, somewhat smokey and peppery smell as well as some minimal sweetness (honey basically). Light-bodied, not watery but goes down easy and smooth although there's a sharpness to the beer from strong carbonation. The honey balances the beer as there is a strong pepper, spicy taste, little smokey, as the chili peppers assert themselves. Touch of cocoa as well in the taste but not real noticeable; overall a good beer that pulls off a balancing act between dry and sweet so it's not too roasted/grainy or just a honey/chocolate beer...crisp finish and the ABV lends a dry touch on the finish."
"Pours a hazy cider like color with a slight of white head which gives way to minimal lacing. The aroma is at first of big cocco and then settles down to honey and chile. Taste has a chile burn backbone with a nice honey flavor and at the back end hits of dark chocolate bitterness. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. The drinkability is good, you can easily drink a bomber, the taste and aroma change making you want more of this beer."
"pours a cloudy orange color with a very average head. some lacing, but nothing particular impressive. smells of fruits (like the apricot smell of #9). slightest hint of caramel as well. The taste is less fruity, although somewhat apparent. Some earthiness comes through as well. sort of bitter, not only slightly. Can't pick up any chile either in flavor or heat. Mouthfeel is thicker. drinkability is decent. Decent beer. Was expecting something ""more"" as it seems like a regular beer, not the ""extreme"" i was expecting from an old recipe such as this one."
"D- No bueno"
"Overall, I was a little dissappointed. I really wanted more bold flavors here. The lack of chocolate was the most grevious offender. I enjoyed what I did have, but I guess my expectations were a bit bolder. That being said, it was a nice honey and chili infused that I would have again, although not for the price they charge for a 750 mL bottle."
"D - For a unique brew, I thought this concoction really excelled; I love it when the team at Dogfish head put their heads together and come up with something new; keep them coming!; no matter how diverse or eccentric the beer ingredients are, I'll keep trying them"
"Yeah, not a bad drop as a beer, but I find myself very uninspired by this."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into snifter glass. Orange-amber hues stare at me from beneath a pithy blanket lined with lacy frills and shadowed by a soft haze. I am immediately enraptured by a massively aromatic nose of cacao, ginger, apricots, sugar syrup (the kind used in canned fruits), mangos, green bananas, ginger bread snaps, brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice, lavender and lilies. Woah. Green chilies tickle the back of my nose while all of her sugar, spice, and everything nice blends together in thirst-inducing harmony. I haven't supped yet, and somehow I just know that once more Sam and Dogfish Head have done it again. There is a steady undercurrent of honey sweetness throughout our session together which leaves bitter fruit skins in the back. My lips are sticky with apricot and mango juices while spice permeates the entirety of her palate. Each iota of flavor stands on her own, but each iota of flavor also shares a bed with allspice, cinnamon, and ginger. Heat and spice tickle the back of my throat for which I give thanks to the great and powerful ancho chilies. I was most leery of the addition of ancho chilies in this beer because chilies and beer are not usually the most harmonious of marriages. But in Theobroma she is a gentle whisper with just enough spicy heat in the recesses to remind me of her presence. Never once does she overwhelm and make my supping experience a painful one. Caramel mingles with honey sweetness while gingerbread cookies and ginger snaps pepper my breath. I am intrigued by the lack of apparent ABV heat; I get more warmth from the ancho chilies than I do the 9% ABV within. The chocolate is very subtle and seems to be quite happy weaving in and out of her tropical fruits, green apples, honey and caramel sweetness than she could be as the center of attention. Medium bodied and good carbonation throughout. Overall a good beer."
"Medium body, smooth mouthfeel. This is an interesting beer. Overall not something I would drink more of beyond this glass, but glad to have tried it."
"Wow, it's not even that interesting, when I expected it to be challenging and perhaps a little disturbing. It ends up tasting more like malt liquor than anything else. Minimal character from the chilli, the cocoa nibs, or anything, leaves it coming out rather thin and insipid, with just a big alcohol burn for your troubles."
"Notes - I was totally surprised by this one, it didn't taste anything like what I was expecting. Ultimately, this is a good thing, as I would love to come back and give it another go."
"the beer coats the mouth, but not too thick. tingly carbonation. no hint of alcohol. balanced well so no problem drinking all myself."
"This beer poured much lighter than I expected- a transparent golden straw color. It did have strong carbonation and maintained a thin layer of foam on top. The smell was a little surprising to be mostly malty with some honey sweetness. The taste alone was surprisingly dominated by fruity sweetness. However after letting it sit for a while and pairing with spicy Indian food, the finish became extremely chocolaty. A very neat twist."
"NOTES: The beer is a rich, flavorful, a light to medium carbonated 9.0% ABV beer that I would drink, more likely than not, as a desert beer. This would be a great end to any meal. Thomas looked at me and said, ""noticeable heat from the alcohol."" My response was, are you sure it's alcohol?"" I knew right away that this was more special than that... A heat from chili peppers!"
"A very good beer. I found it more balanced than the pangea or midas touch, with a larger range of tastes and subtleties."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation is a bit below average. The lower carbonation works pretty well for it. Drinkability is decent, the honey and cocoa were pretty good overall. I was actually glad the peppers were a little more reserved in it. It was definitely on the sweeter side, but it kind of worked with the cocoa flavors. Not a bad beer overall."
"Pours a clear, crisp light golden amber with a thin fizzy head which dissipates quickly but not totally as the carbonation is persistent bringing forth more. Nose has a spicyness to it, good malt base, sweet cocoa, light fruits. All kinds of auromas happening here! Taste is big upfront; certainly not hot but there is a spice note taking over. Flavours mix to represent exactly what the style would have you think; Chile Beer. Sparse bitterness in the finish. Good medium bodied, chewy mouthfeel. Interesting style, not one I think I'll find myself revisiting often, so drinkability isnt too high. Theres a certain spicy taste that will prohibit me from drinking too much of this beer. Fun to try and kudos to Dogfish Head for trying something like this. Part of their Ancient Ales lineup. Wonderful bottle label, not that it affects score but a good looking label never hurts."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Certainly worth a try. As a pepper-head, anything with chili peaks my interest. Another weird beer from a brewery that can actually pull it off."
"After many brews I've had from Dog fish, I enjoyed this one, but I don't know that I would be quick to pick up another bottle. Its a very aggressive beer. However, that is what I've come to express from Dogfish."
"Comments- Two different beers at different temperatures. Allow to warm above cellar temp for the full experience."
"Drinkability - For me always a ""good night in"" turn-to beer. Impress your friends and conversation starter beer. wonderful!"
"This one is a repeater. Perfect for a chilly evening"
"Pours an orangish amber with a thin white head which fades rapidly. Smell is interesting - sweet flowers/fruity, malt, with a little cocoa. As it warms there is an increasing honey presence. Taste is just strange - sweet and mildly peppery with a faint cocoa and chili spice. Some yeasty dryness to the finish. Just generally odd to me and not sure what to make of it. Expecting more chili and chocolate here. Probably one and done for this."
"D/O- Drinkability isn't bad but the way I feel this beer is marketed, who would want to drink one to themselves. This was a different beer than what I've had lately and I'm starting to enjoy what Dogfish tries and sometimes accomplish."
"D: Very interesting beer that has a high degree of drinkability. I was a bit worried at first when reading the label and seeing things like chocolate, honey and chilies combined with 9% abv. After the first sip I was sold, this is a very unique beer. Great for something to have from time to time to mix things up."
"Overall a very interesting and flavorful beer. I an intrigued with the sweet grainy malt and herbal hop, balanced with the musty, spicy yeast."
"Easy to drink, but very strange and I'm glad I tried it, but can't imagine drinking it often."
"Drinkability: I applaud Dogfish Head for making this beer, though I wouldn't want it more than once or twice a year."
"Extremely drinkable and well balanced."
"D-I tried this beer all sorts of ways. Cool, warm, cold and none of them gave me much in the area of flavors advertised. Maybe the annatto more than any of the advertised additions. It doesn't taste bad, just not as advertised."
"I've said before, I hate it when people call world-class lower-abv beers like pale ales, milds, bitters, etc. boring just because they aren't huge and ""extreme"". This is the other end of that spectrum: a giant beer incorporating a ton of crazy ingredients that is so dull and lifeless it ends up being, you guessed it, boring. I've had my share of big, crazy beers that worked, but this is not one of them."
"This was just like honey and alcohol."
"D- I kind of like the use of the chilies in this, not overpowering and noticeable just enough to let you know that they're there. I think if the chocolate was more pronounced this could of been a very good beer."
"O - Worth trying. An interestingly drinkable brew."
"Overall: The flavors never really come together for me, though paired well with some food from the grill that accompanied this beer at one point. I've been wanting to try this beer for years and while I'm a huge DFH fan this one misses the mark. But, matching this beer to the taste buds of modern drinkers isn't so much what this beer is about and I do appreciate the intent of it. But for $13/bottle I'll look elsewhere in the future."
"Would pair with fruit and mild cheese, or some sort of southwestern cheese dip app."
"D - first the alcohol is so well hidden it's dangerous, the flavours are individually subtle but there is so much going on that the result is very tasty, a well constructed beer that will surprise"
"Overall, the Theobrama exists an interesting beer certainly worth a try if you can justify the steep price (or find a better deal). I'd liken it to something worth the experience alone and to share with friends but not much more. For a chili beer, the chili and the noted cocoa were just something I did not find playing a major role in the beer experience."
"I was really excited to try this based on the describtion. By far the least flavorful beer from DFH I've had. Unless the recipe changes to add a lot more flavor, I would never drop $12 on this again."
"D - This stuff was awesome and what a privilege it was to get an opportunity to drink. Some very unique flavours and a tasty treat indeed! One could easily toss back a few of these bottles, if it weren't for the price! If you can get your hands on a bottle, it's well worth the purchase."
"D: This could be a very dangerous beer, there is not a hint of alcohol noticed and it goes down smooth. If you like to try different beers, give this one a try, it's interesting to drink what people hundreds of years drank all the time."
"Like everything they do, this is an extremely well made beer and while it's not necessarily my taste it is very enjoyable."
"This beer is medium-full boddied with not much carbonation. This was my second ancient ale from DFH and Midas Touch was better. So now I'll have to snatch a Chateau Jiahu and see how that compares."
"The cocoa is a bit overwhelming and makes it very filling; as such, it is a bit of a chore for me to finish the bottle by myself (which usually isn't a problem). The taste is extremely chaotic, a mish-mash of seemingly random stuff that doesn't go well together... but, nonetheless, given the historical and scientific relevance of this brew, I am glad I've tried it. Thanks to DFH for putting this together."
"D: Very drinkable and interesting. Despite the ingredients it was lighter than expected. Initially I was expecting more Chile, but after tasting thought it was exceptionally well balanced."
"D - Not drinkable. Couldn't drink a whole bomber myself. Wouldn't get this again unless I was introducing someone to chili beer."
"Overall an interesting and unique brew that though has different flavors is smooth and easy to drink."
"D: if it wasn't so hot it would be more drinkable."
"From the bottle to a pint glass. Pours a slightly burnt orange/amber color with a small white head that quickly dissolves (even with a vigorous pour). The smell wasn't all that impressive to me, mainly spices, chilies, some kind of fruity smell, maybe a bit earthy, and a bit of cocoa. As it warmed it got slightly better but there wasn't much there for me. By smell alone I didn't think I would enjoy this one. Then I moved on to the taste which totally changed my mind of this beer. At first it was bitter but then got really sweet and finished smoothly. It's probably sweet because of the honey. Other taste include chilies, spices, fruits, kind of earthy, and more cocoa/chocolate in the taste which wasn't really apparent until it warmed up more. Slightly above average mouthfeel, kind of medium bodied. At 9% ABV it's a bit high but I couldn't even notice the alcohol in the smell or taste. Pretty drinkable overall but I'd probably only do one of these in a night. Overall I wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but I ended up liking it. I will probably try and pick up one more bottle of it."
"D: A curiosity that delivers an array of dark yet clean flavors without really compromising for the sake of its concept. Sensory qualities remind of a bier de garde or, forgiving the color, even a dubbel--surprisingly versatile for a beer brewed with cocoa and chiles."
"There's not much more to describe this other than an interesting, sweet, and easy drinking mead. After several sips I had a hard time detecting any chocolate. I walked away for a minute and low and behold, there it was! A rich chocolatey feel and taste in my mouth. After that it became much more prominent and together with the mead and vinous characteristics made for a pleasant drinking experience. As for the chilis, I could only taste the faintest whispers occasionally which was unfortunate because I was looking forward to a little spiciness. Not exactly the bewitching elixir I was hoping for to accompany Jonah Hex however the movie sucked anyway and at least the beer was interesting. As always, DFH makes an interesting beer that must be experienced."
"Am trying to give this beer time and realized that I do really like it yet think that for a chile beer, they don't come that much into play and that might be a good thing."
"Overall, we found this to be an interesting brew. While it lacked any burn that one might expect from a ""chile beer", it certainly put forth some extraordinary flavor pairings. What we liked most about this brew was the distinct presence of the cocoa throughout both the aroma and taste profiles."
"Like their Midas Touch, the wine aspect of this beer is hard to ignore, especially in this case, where we were overtly promised chocolate and chilies. A tasty affair, to be sure, but the chili spice is just a little too reserved, and the 'poor man's saffron' probably just gets lost in the fray."
"D- This is a different breed for me. I had never had a chile beer, but I was expecting something so much different I wonder if it alter my perception of it. I want to try it again, but it is expensive at $18.99/bottle when it can be found around my parts."
"Had bomber dated from 2009 that i had cellaring in the wine cooler for 1 yr. opened and was hit with an awsome aroma of honey and spice! While pouring could see some hints of sediment from age and the color had changed from fresher batches that i've had throughout the year. The amber color had turned a beautiful orange and upon tasting was hit with awsome honey and coco flavor. I was dissapointed with the chile which didnt come through. I just seemed to want more and more and it was not dry @ all! Overall, and awsome expirience with age! Well worth the wait!"
"First, I have to admit that I always enjoy trying an historic or archeological beer. I really like the experience and unique flavors. This beer is a golden, mostly clear liquid. There's some carbonation, but no head. Actually, from a distance it looks like a mead. It certainly doesn't smell like one. It has a strange aroma that's not at all beer-like. It has the scent of grape juice (not sure where that comes from), spice, background honey, and alcohol. Earthy and spicy. The intent seems to be to showcase cocoa, but I didn't initially get it. However, after trying some unsweetened baking cocoa for reference, the cocoa character is completely obvious. It's present in every sip, and is really very pleasant. Well done. The chilies seem to take the place of hops, and give the beer slightly warm finish and an apparent dryness. Still, it's a strange set of flavors, and although it's good, I can't call it incredibly drinkable. A great experiment, though."
"D: Well this is a long leap from what I expected. Oddly, it shared more qualities with D.H. Midas Touch and Orange Blossom Pilsner than anything else. It is mead-like in sweetness and the chillies don't really leave a big impression."
"Let me end this on a good note: The more you drink it, the more noticeable the cocoa becomes. Though it is quite subtle."
"D: This is a really beautifully crafted beer. All flavors are subtle but appreciable."
"Gold with a fizzy pour and a light tan head that quickly disappears. Smells of slightly soured fruits and honey with a mild malty base. Tastes sweet, sour and spicy with a good hit of alcohol at the end and an undercurrent of chiles. A light fruitiness exists. Mouth-feel is medium and somewhat creamy. Goes down fairly smooth despite the lingering alcohol heat. Good beer that I would rather have had in a 12 oz. pour. Not for sure I'm so stoked on it that I can appreciate an entire bomber."
"D: Interesting, but not one of my favorites. Impressive, but i probably wouldn't get it again. Simply not my style."
"I respect that DFH stretches and does this ancient recreations but this one didn't do much for me. Worth trying just to see what it was like long ago but would rather do it from a sample instead of a whole bottle. Avail here in TX. Rotation - good but one is enough [N;N]"
"Poured this into a tulip. The body is a deep hazy golden straw color with little floaty things kicking around and just a thin layer of white head on top. The aroma releases a big whiff of honey right away. Underneath I smell sweet fruit and just a little bit of cocoa. I'm really not detecting any chili at all which seems a bit off. The flavor is thick and malty with honey sweetness coating the tongue to begin and just a touch of chili in the finish for a little after burn that is only enough to really know that it is there. Ever so slight hints of dry cocoa are present as well. The mouthfeel is very thick, bordering syrupy with really nice carbonation. Enjoyable drinkability, even at a pretty well hidden nine percent."
"Overall it's very unique, but doesn't quite hit the mark."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. However, as with most DFH beers, it was nice to try but I probably won't be revisiting on a regular basis."
"I have had this many times, and it is not something I would recommend at all. Very bland and generic. Dogfish Head does some interesting stuff from time to time. Sometimes it is really good, sometimes it is average, and sometimes it is just bad. This is just bad IMO."
"thanks Matt for hooking me up"
"D- Very drinkable, balanced, and the chili element is not threatening at all. Wish I was enjoying this with a nice meal because I think I would enjoy this even more."
"The first chile beer I've ever had, and the spiciness is certainly interesting. Overall, a nice beer to try, but not something I will go out of my way to drink. Also, despite the fact that its 9 % abv, it doesn't taste like it, and thus could easily sneak up on you."
"The flavor is a 180-degree turn from the aroma as a syrupy, stinging, spicy sweetness greets the palate. ""Tangy"" is a good descriptor. But overall, there's just too much going on in this beer. The chili & cocoa are overcome by a hefty, green booze note and mineral graininess in the finish. Mouthfeel is overly carbonated, making the thick body schizophrenic in its consistency. Theobroma is certainly unique, but in the end it drinks like a poorly-crafted, cloyingly sweet Belgian strong ale whose spices aren't derived from the yeast. Not worth the price tag, and not worth a re-visit from yours truly."
"Drinkability: Good, I agree with the previous reviewer, I think this would pair perfectly with a good Pad Thai! Really a must try just for the unique nature of the brew."
"While it's obvious this is a high quality and well crafted brew, it simply didn't do much for my palate. It was a lot of fun to try, but I don't see myself having it again."
"Drinkability: Very good! If it weren't nearly $15 per fifth, I'd drink it on a regular basis, especially with real Thai or Mexican food. Pretty awesome beer!"
"Drinkability- exceedingly easy to drink and overall very enjoyable experiance, hard to explain and hard for me to describe but at no point did i feel like i was drink at 9 percent beer at all, worth seeking out to see what you think, this is one that surely grew on me as i went more and more"
"Initially I was really excited to try this historic brew it was a major letdown nothing really unique about the taste, complete waste of time and money in my opinion."
"Drinkability.750 is just about enough for me its a good beer and all but more than a bottle and it will most likely knock you on your ass."
"It's a drinkable archeological recreation for sure, but reminds me a lot of a Tripel or Belgian Golden Strong with a few twists. In fact it reminds me more of a stronger spiced version of Midas Touch. Interesting to try once, but not enough there to bring me back for more."
"Verdict: Theobroma is an interesting, solid and highly drinkable little experiment. Of the Dogfish Head historical recreations, this was the one I was looking forward to the most, but it ended up being my least favorite. Funny how things work out like that."
"It's fairly drinkable. Very unique flavor. It's worth checking it out."
"I suppose it wasn't bad, per se, but for all the ingredients and expense, it's really no more exciting or rewarding than a supermarket witbier. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm one and done with this."
"Pretty cool beer. I love their experimental beers like this! Throughly enjoyed!"
"I do not recommend this beer at all, and I am a HUGE fan of this brewery so take that in to consideration, but as someone mentioned and I may have to agree with them... This is the WORST product they have ever made that I have ever had by DF."
"Taste was complex. First noticed sour fruit finnishing with bitter spice. Then the chocolate notes came through covering the palate with a silky savory feeling, backed by spice from the chiles and finnishing with a sweet and sour fruit taste reminiscent of starfruit. A good, interesting beer."
"I had long awaited the arrival of this beer in my neck of the woods. The concept of Chili Peppers and Chocolate (not to mention the reviews I had seen of it) sounded AMAZING. I am sad to say that I was not impressed by the balance of the flavors at all. I didn't find that there was any flavor of the Chili Peppers in the beer at all (ideally I would have liked a little spice or something to be there) I wasn't expecting much from the chocolate going in, but I got nothing. Although I am glad to have tried it and learned from the experience, I felt a bit let down by it."
"D- not a fan of this one. Seems like it doesn't know what the hell it wants to be"
"The feel of this beer is has a smooth texture to it. It is very complex but goes down easy with a nice sweet aftertaste. Like most Dogfish Head beers this is really a great experience."
"D-Uh good I guess? Once again dogfish head has made a good beer, but what kind of beer I have no clue."
"All in all, this is a an ok brew. Nothing special. Don't make this your first try."
"D: Hmmmm... I'm not sure how to feel about this one. It's not bad, but I'm not sure I'd ever need to drink it again. Above average as a beer, but it's hard for me to rate this one to style."
"Personally, we would like to see a bit more heat from those chilies, but this is without a doubt one of the more interesting, tasty and experimental brews from Dogfish Head. The balance of flavors from so many distinct sources is pretty much perfect. Sam, please make more."
"It has a nice smell to it of unsweetened chocolate and earth like smells which are probably the annatto seeds they put in. Taste is very much the same with that nice unsweetened chocolate taste with that pleasing annatto seed taste. It also is extremely smooth and has a nice burning in the back of the tongue and throat from the ancho chilies which by the way makes the beer in my opinion. Doesn't even taste like 9 percent either although you can feel it. I liked this one a little bit better than their Sahtea that I've tried only a month or two earlier not even. Dogfish Head does it again though. Thanks guys!"
"not quite stellar, but this is much better than the consensus B it has at this point..."
"Overall, interesting but not something I would want todrink often."
"When I try a beer that it brewed with honey, cacoa and chiles, I expect it to taste like honey, cacoa and chiles. All three of these elements were hardly noticeable in this beer. I appreciate the efforts of Dogfish Head in recreating an authentic Mayan/Aztec drink. Unfortunately, this recipe did not translate well into a modern day brew."
"Good beer, and once again I am extremely excited by Dogfish Heads ancient ales."
"A good bottle to split, especially if you wanted to try something pretty out of the ordinary with a lot of South and Central American flavors."
"Mayan royal ""drink of the gods""? I doubt it. But it certainly is a very nice end-of-the-week relaxer for a hard-working lower-middle-class peon."
"My Theobroma poured with a orange colour, a 1 cm head and decent lacing. Nice earthy, chocolate smell with a hint of spiciness. The cocoa is immediately apparent and tastes good then it fades into a slightly muddy aftertaste. Still a really nice, and unusual, beer. Very drinkable."
"Overall a good beer, but there are many better choices from DFH (120 min, 90 min, Santo, WWS, Bithces Brew, Fort, etc...)"
"D: Decent drinkability, but starts to wear on me towards the end of the bomber. This is a beer that is better than I thought it would be. Far from my favorite DFH offering, I'm glad I've tried it, though, and recommend the unique experience to anyone."
"D: it drank very good but I have to say its not one of my favorites coming fron DFH. I honestly think it was better the first time around."
"Dogfish Head is still my favourite brewery for now, but I hope this is not the direction new brews from DFH take."
"Good mouthfeel, just the right amount of carbonation but I think this could stand to be a bit thicker. A nice sipper, even at 9%"
"D - Hands down this is a great beer, not my personal favorite but a damn you good beer that really grows on you. It has such a strange and wonderful combination of flavors that you can not help but like it. This is a perfect beer to have on a cold stormy day to give you a warm cozy feeling inside. Everyone needs to try this beer and taste a piece of history with some ""food for the gods""!"
"Pours an almost-clear amber-golden color with some sediment floating around in it. The head is medium sized and dissolves quickly. Smell is very sweet with some very noticeable alcohol. Sweet fruits along with some zesty spices. I also get a slight ""medicine-like"" smell which is kinda a turn-off. Taste is very interesting. Immediately I get a boozy taste once sipping it. At 9%, I wasn't expecting this much heat. I also pick up some fruits (apple, pear, grapes). I get quite a bit of roasted malt as well. The alcohol flavor is a bit overwhelming (takes away from the other flavors). This is my first ""Chile"" beer, but I'm not tasting any chilies...so I'm a bit confused. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, but drinkability isn't so high."
"- Overall it's very interesting. Can't say it's fantastic... but it has its highs and lows all in one bottle... wouldn't buy again though."
"Drinkability- I thought it was very good. I didn't even realize it was a chile beer until I looked for it tonight. I didn't even think of a chile beer when I tried it."
"Drinkability - Despite everything else this is pretty tasty and I will have no problems getting through the 750. The flavors mix well to make something that isn't incredible but is enjoyable."
"This is not an every day beer, but yet another for special occasions. I should note that my girlfriend (who loves spicy food) had a glass of this and spent the rest of the evening complaining of a stomach ache because the combination of the peppers, chocolate and alcohol didn't mix well in her system, but I felt fine. I wouldn't drink this on an empty stomach if you're sensitive to peppers."
"D: I suppose I'm glad this beer wasn't horrendously bad like it certainly could have been. But, it wasn't really any good either."
"D - Although it is very drinkable, I can't say that I would rush for another. Glad to have tried this one and appreciate the attempt, but honestly not all that impressed."
"This beer lets you know there is a lot going on. Light malt and biscuit flavors with a good honey presence. A dark, alkaline chocolate flavor comes through from the cocoa nibs along with the same chocolate bitterness. The chile heat sneaks in the back, but warms rather than burns. The light carbonation and body kept this easy drinking throughout, and it was a very refreshing session that got more complex as it warmed up. I'd like this again and was glad to have had it."
"A final note: I respect and embrace the philosophy behind this entire series of recreating ancient recipes. Therefore, I try each one well knowing that it is not a modern day version of beer, and so, anything might happen. It is in that spirit that I will continue to try the next in the series when it comes out."
"This is in my opinion the best offering i've sampled from DFH. though, i have yet to enjoy the pleasure of the midas touch and based on the concept of it i wonder how the two would stack up against one another."
"I really appreciate it, being an interesting brew, and I'd like to adjust my ratings but then it'd skew it against current, modern offerings. I don't think it's a chile beer, but I guess there isn't really a category for it. It's cool like Midas Touch but not something I'd normally have."
"D: Only 1 per sitting for me, not a session beer :)"
"I'd say that the untraditional aspects of this beer will be hard to take for most. I understand brewer intention and innovation, but I still think this is too focused on one ingredient to truly reflect the original nature of this beer. It would be much easier to take in a 12 oz. bottle, but, at 750 ml., it's hard to choke down."
"750 mL bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. This is a clear golden amber color, very fizzy with a light to moderate head. Smell includes chocolate, cinnamon, maple, and chili peppers. Taste is a mix of caramel and chocolate with a slight peppery kick at the end. Fairly tasty, but not nearly as complex as the description suggested. Drinkability is excellent for nearing 10% ABV."
"I was expecting another typical Dogfish Head novelty beer, but this one holds up very well with its own unique style. I would recommend this to any serious beerologist."
"D: Decent, yet it seems like this is missing something. Good to try once, but repeat attempts aren't really necessary since it's kind of one dimensional."
"D: Although the alcohol is masked rather well from the taste, this beer still tastes strong and is one that needs to be sipped given its amount of cloying sweetness."
"D- fairly easy to put down but this is more of a beer you would want to try once, this one isn't really worth purchasing again in my opinion"
"""Honey Moon", but it was better than just that. There were some light spicy elements, and I appreciated how well hidden the ABV was in the medium body."
"A great offering from DFH, very enjoyable."
"Currently my favorite brew, but only for special occasions. Highly recommended for any person who likes experiencing new beer and enjoying somewhat more sophisticated brews."
"I have been wanting to try this beer for awhile,I picked it up today and well...I wish I hadnt spent the money I did for it.Poured a clear golden with no head what so ever,it looked flat.Aromas are fruity with a light shot of spice,not like ancho's though,more heat than expected.Very light chocolate on the palate with the alcohol showing thru,the chile comes thru in the aftertaste.Eh not what I thought it would be,the spicey burbs are the best thing about this beer in my mind."
"I'll try it again and I was pleased to see it on draft but not one of my favorites."
"Theobroma poured a shade of red away from amber; the head and lacing are nearly absent, however. The smell is outright boozy with a strong note of alcohol, with citrus and florals in the background. I was quite impressed by the taste of this one; given the concept of the brew, I was expecting something overly heavy. Instead this definitely is a lighter ale, with a front-forward taste of chile, resting on a base of bitter cocoa, tangy hops, and honey. Given the ingredients this is surprisingly easy drinking and refreshing, stopping just short of crisp, and a brew I'd always welcome more of."
"Drinkability-Just finished a bottle without a problem. 'Nuff said. The description of this beer would not hint at easy drinkability, but this stuff goes down smooth!"
"Please note: I had this on tap subsequently at Church Key in San Francisco, at the suggestion of the barmaid. Well, I have to concede that, while the aromas were basically the same, the taste was far superior to the example I had in the bottle. So I would revise to a c+, except the bottle really did suck, and BA does not provide a way to do 2 reviews of the same beer with different delivery methods. Until they do that, I leave it as is."
"D-Not too high. Might cellar one and try it in a year."
"D: Good after-dinner drink."
"Very interesting beer. Though probably not for beer lovers. For the more casual beer drinker."
"D - Drank the whole bottle by myself, so I suppose that speaks for itself. Fairly complex flavors that balance fairly well. Chiles dominate by the end but I felt it was just enough. Would go very well with some barbeque or almost any kind of beef."
"Notes: I guess I was expecting a little more obvious flavor or smell from the cocoa and chili ingredients. But maybe that would not be a good thing."
"I like the beer and waited awhile to try it. I have few reservations, but would not say it's the best beer I've ever had."
"D - well worth the try as is any DFH, you do not taste the alcohol in this beer but it tends to catch up to you. The chilies are an interesting change of pace, the aroma's a pleasure - taste is a tad on the sweet side but broken up well with chilies and carbonation. Overall I look forward to another bottle."
"In the end, this is an interesting and drinkable beer. I think it would be better if the chocolate and spiciness were a bit more pronounced though."
"I'll give this one another try to make my final verdict, but unless I'm at the Brewery in DE I'll restrict my next tasting to a bottle."
"D- I knew there would be some point I don't hoot and holla about a dfh brew. There is no question that this brew is geared to capture a historic style. Nevertheless, it does not transition to my most favorite brew. BUT!!! I can really enjoy drinking this, as it goes down quite smooth. I'll grabe a couple of these before they move on to the next brew"
"D: Honestly, I thought they'd do more with this. It tastes a bit like a more pallid Pangaea with a bit of chocolate and chile thrown in. Just wanted more, this is the 2nd time I've had this and was underwhelmed both times, but still I give props to DFH for their experimentation."
"This is a nice seasonal from a fantastic brewery. Very complex and engages all of the senses."
"Drinkability - Very good beer that finishes well, and has a lot of great flavor too it. It's overall appearance throws me off because it doesn't pour or smell the way you would think it would. I guess that's just how the ancients did it."
"I picked up 3 bottles after purchasing as it makes for both an interesting novelty and it is incredibly drinkable for the alcohol content. I would recommend this if you're feeling adventurous or are an archaeologist looking to spend your Per Diem ;) In my opinion, this beer fills in just fine as a yearly curiosity and is probably something you could have once and then move on from."
"Nothing that I would drink every day, every week or even every month. I'm not certain that I'd try it every year even. Midas Touch continues to be my favorite in the Ancient Ales series from DFH."
"D: OK drinkability, lots of stuff going on here but not bad for sure."
"t: chocolate and honey are apparent upfront. If held in the mouth, chili heat appears, and appears again on the back of the throat later. Nice evening beer to sip while unwinding."
"D-Another ""glad I tried it"" brew from DFH, but this seems to have missed the mark. What should be incredibly complex is simply lackluser. A few years ago at Hershey we saw a lecture on Mayan chocolate beverages, then tasted some chocolate laced with chile and pepper. It was delicious, and that experience is what I was hoping for in this beer but it does not seem to translate well. Don't get me wrong...this is not horrible or undrinkable, it just isn't that great."
"I wouldn't decline this if somebody offered me a glass but it's definitely not something I would seek out."
"D: I can't say that I like this, the flavors that the bottle advertises are not there and are insanely subtle, or non-existent. I had pretty high hopes for this beer, like i do the other ""historic"" beers, but once again, I'm a bit disappointed. Price tag is steep, and this just is disappointing."
"d - A decent beer.I thought the chile has faded but it was still good none the less. Would try again."
"This one drinks nice with a year of age on it..."
"D: Ah, not for me. Definitely will be a one and done here for this one."
"Medium bodied with an unpleasant peppery spice characteristic which is not balanced particularly well by a silky chocolate maltiness. There's also hints of nuttiness, earthy hops, cloying alcohol sweetness, which creates a strong warmth in the finish. Tastes and flavors do not improve as the beer warms. I wish the chocolate and chilies flavors were stronger and that the beer overall was better balanced. Not worth the inflated price tag, if someone allows you to sample theirs, its worth tasting but no need to seek out on your own."
"Pours an amber color with a fizzy white head. I would have expected a thin stout color, so the lighter color is very interesting. First sip brings a strong chocolate flavor, very sweet. As the beer travels across the tongue, the beer turns more hot from the peppers. Also, there is an alcohol burn at the end. The smell is oaky, it seems. There is a hint of unsweetened chocolate in it. I'm a big fan of this. An excellent beer, I look forward to picking up another bottle."
"The scent is boozy with a strong candied cherry and chili aroma in addition to notes of raw cocoa and honey. Sweet malt finishes out the nose. Some smokiness develops as it warms. Overall, the aromas are faint but complex. The alcohol his the palate up front. Starts with some honey sweetness and finishes with the ancho chilies; lingers with some spicy heat on the back of the tongue. For a cocoa-centric beer, the chocolate notes are hard to detect which is the largest disappointment about this brew. It's moderate in terms of body and carbonation, but strong in the booze. In rating the drinkability, I think it's important to take into account that this brew is a take on an ancient recipe. This is the first year I've had this brew, so I'm interested to see how it changes next year if at all."
"D- I would rate this as decently drinkable if not for the ABV. This one could sneak up on you. The alcohol is almost undetectable. This one ended up making me sick to my stomach by the end of the bottle. I'm sure that isn't everyone's experience but I didn't like it."
"D: Drinkable, but be warned, like a lot of DFH's beers, this one isn't for everyone."
"Drinkability: This beer is extremely drinkable given its ABV and the alcohol is nearly undetectable. A very, very interesting beer- one which I would be willing to have again, though not necessarily often. The interesting character of, and story behind, this brew make it worth at least one tasting."
"Different and interesting, I like it. Worth trying."
"Drinkability: This is an ok beer for drinkability and I'm pleased to have tried it. It is something I'll have again in the future as a change of pace beer or as a special treat for company with dinner."
"Food of the gods, indeed. It pours a clear copper topped by a few piles of large tan-green bubbles. It's not really foam, just several rows of tangential bubbles. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, chile peppers, greens, wet hay, and a dash of cayenne. The taste is much the same, though with more citrus notes and a touch of that cocoa they put in there. A nice tiny flash o' heat comes creeping up from the bottom, but serves only as a tease. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation and a humid finish. Overall, possibly the best chile beer on the market (though that ain't sayin' too much)."
"Interesting beer, but not one I'd seek out again."
"Not impressed, and won't be back for another one."
"A deep yellow infused golden color with bubbles rising creating an off white cap, squiggly lines going down, clinging to the glass. Smell is weird with cocco powder, a vegetative scent along with pale malts and some diaper. Spices are present. Not too pungent. Taste include light chocolate and chili flavor with spices that resemble curry and other indian cuisines. The chilli aint all that big. Malt presence is light, not very sweet if at all. This one is all about the spice, a weird mix, mimiking indian food. This fares better off tap than in the bottle, the bottle was ass. This has a lively carb that brings out the flavor a bit more and im not sure if that's a good thing. Medium bodied with low drinkability. Interesting beer, not memorable."
"Future outlook: Was a very interesting, pleasant sampling, though probably not spectacular enough to warrant a revisit at it's price point."
"The body is medium with a lower level of carbonation than I like to see. As for drinkability-- this is worth trying, but arguably, not one I'd pick up again."
"the beer was amazing and i suggested it to all further more if you are going to want to eat w it i suggest some sort of red meat or perhaps a chocolate covered chicken"
"D- it drinks easy at first but the sweetness would keep me from wanting to have more than a couple."
"D-a great beer to try. imagining you are about to go sacrifice some one to the gods!"
"D-Very easy drinking and an interesting brew."
"D: I like this beer. I could see some interesting food pairings with it. It's not overwhelming, nor underwhelming. Has enough going on to keep you interested."
"D: On the stronger side at 9%, and although the alcohol is well hidden, the cloying sweetness makes this brew difficult to finish."
"Nice golden color. Just read a review about KBS with the reviewer saying it was better than anticpated and I feel the same way about htis beer. I am a Dogfishhead Fan, but I do think some of their beers are better than their others. This is definitely one of the better ones. The smell sort of reminds me of a belgian triple. I'm wondering what style of yeast they used. I really enjoy the taste. It displays a diversified spectrum of flavors. Figs come to my head, but I can also see some chocolate influence and I believe the pepper is really helping the taste balance. I enjoy spicy foods, but this style of spice is much more flavorful and mellow. It's a great balance. the aftertaste is nice and I don't taste a lot of alcohol. Despite the full flavor, this beer is light enough to drink a fair amount of."
"This sounds like a good idea but is just another excuse for DFH to make an ""off centered ale""."
"D: Call me out for not rating to style, but I simply did not enjoy this one. It's cool that DFH is brewing these ancient beer recipes, but if ""craft"" beer tasted like this back then I may have never stopped drinking Budweiser."
"I like what DFH has been doing with these ancient ales. While they're not always the best tasting, they're fun and give you an idea of what beer may have been like, and bring it back full circle to how beers are today."
"D - a sipper for sure, a glass or two is just fine."
"D= 9% ABV is the first challenge, $11.99 for a 22 ounce bomber isn't cheap, and I think I would treat this more as a novelty one-glass brew to be shared with a few others."
"Definitely try it if you haven't."
"This beer is brewed with Aztec cocoa powder, cocoa nibs from Askinosie chocolate, honey, ancho chillies and annato. The recipe is based on a chemical analyssis of pottery fragments found in Honduras. It's the earliest known alcoholic chocolate drink. It poured a clear bright orange with some lace. It smelled like honey, smokey malts, chili and a hint of cocoa. It tasted light bodied, which was very unexpected. The cocoa was more pronounced in flavor than the chilis- the chili flavor really came out on the end of your tongue. Overall, it was like a flavorful light and crispy malt. It was definitely fun and interesting to try but I am not sure I would want to drink a whole bunch of it. It was good for the holidays though- and I wonder how well this will age."
"D - I wasn't sure what to expect with this interesting DFH concoction, but I was pleasantly surprised with the result. Theobroma artfully combines the sweetness of honey, the decadence of chocolate and the bite of spicy peppers to create a very subtle yet complex brew that pushes the boundaries of what a beer can be. Yum!"
"This is another in the long line of experimental, historical incredible beers that only Dogfish Head seems to be interested in, but it's not what I'm into right now. I'm wishing it was a 120 Minutes or even a WWS...but it's a damned fine beverage, and will suit me well through the night."
"drinkability - definitely not a beer that everyone will like. I think this is one that you either like or don't. I rather think it's an interesting beer but then I tend to like these experimental beers like this that combine unorthodox ingredients."
"D - This starts out good, but gets harder as we go. A very unique experience which was good for a bit, but not really one I'd want to repeat."
"While this is a fine beer, and probably more enjoyable for others, I was looking for it to be much more exotic. Still, I was happy to have tried this, and consumed the entire bottle without complaint. And what is the point of 9% ABV, if there is no noticeable addition to the experience? No matter, DFH has so many exceptional offerings, this will merely be a blip on the screen."
"D - only average drinkability.. I wouldn't want to drink more than this large 1pint9oz bottle... but ill reiterate that I don't think it was made to be chugged-- it needs to be sipped to appreciate the complexity...plus I don't think many people would chug a 13$ bottle very often."
"Draft, City Beer Store. The second of a pair of way too sweet DFH beers from tonight's stop at CBS. The beer looks thick and odd, mustily golden in color with no head to speak of. The aroma is oddly light and off. The malt smells musty with, maybe, an aluminum touch. There's a light chili pepper note and an extremely faint shade of cocoa that I might be projecting given expectations. The flavor is unapologetically sweet. There's a blandly sweet honey note, a bit of chili pepper in the finish and not much else besides so-so malt. Mouthfeel is unfortunately oily and thick. There isn't much alcohol, for what it's worth. I had trouble getting through a 5 ounce pour and can only imagine that a solo attempt on a full bottle would have ended with a trip to the sink. Sorry, Dogfish. I really wanted to like this one."
"D: First of the style...I enjoy it very much. It is unique, the spice matches well with the pepper. Alcohol isn't noticeable. The chocolate and cocoa adds a complex flavor that doesn't weigh on one's palette."
"D - This is like the ying and yang for me. I really like the taste however I was expecting much more due to the label. For the record, I do not have a cold and my sinuses are clear, so I should be able to pick up more nuances with this beer, but I'm not. So I'm torn."
"Drinkability is very high however. Overall this is decent, but not as good as I expected it to be overall."
"Poured a hazy light amber with a scant head that left no trace. Not much in the aroma, even with swirling. More pronounced in the taste, which offered some light maltiness, orange peel, subtle cocoa, and finishes with a good spicy kick. The chocolate flavor is too subdued, could definitely use a bit more in that area. Thin and well carbonated. I think it's not bad at all!"
"The beer looks like a normal cloudy orangish ale with a white frothy head. Smelled it immediately after removing bottle cap. The cocoa is light but the most obvious scent. Smelled in glass after poor and with the head the cocoa is a bit stronger. After first sip, very sweet taste with a hint of spice from the chilles. However it is not a strong as others state. Perhaps it was due to time in the bottle. There was no chocolate or cocoa taste. It was sweet but more like the sweetness similar belgian golden ales. the mouthfeel was highly carbonated but when served at the chilled state it was smooth and pleasant. I really like this beer. Too bad it is served in such a large bottle. I wonder what it is that makes others not like it. The booziness of the beer is totally hidden in the flavor. I really think that Sam @ DFH did a great job with this. I would get this at least once. There is no beer like this."
"D: very intriguing and exciting beer from DFH. The flavors don't translate as well as I expected, but I do like how the heat builds up on the finish"
"O: Drinkable, but I didn't really enjoy it all that much. It almost has a liquor quality as it warms that I'm not wild about. I didn't get much in the way of cocoa. I applaud DFH for creativity. You can't get anywhere if you don't take risks. With some tweaking, this might be a killer brew."
"I had a bottle of this in September of 2009. The colour was a golden orange with about a 1/4"" head. The aroma was like... well... crushed cane berries with a smidgen of Chimayo chile mixed in. On the palate, loads of cocoa mass, some chile around the edges of my palate and a rather quick finish."
"After having finished the bomber, the chili's begin, in earnest, to make their presence known."
"""Food of the Gods"" for sure!!! I split a bottle with a friend and we both enjoyed the sweetness of the honey and cocoa nibs at the front and the zestiness of the chilies on the back end they are a wonderful compliment to one another. Def one great beer to seek out and enjoy.Love the artwork on the bottle as well. From the cork finish to the final drop... yum"
"Bottle: Poured a light golden color ale with a medium pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of Chiles and staled grain is not as interesting as I had expected. Taste is more geared toward Chiles then anything else and chocolate notes are very hard to distinguish. Body is about average with OK carbonation and no sign of alcohol. I kind of understand the experience but I am not sure why someone would want to drink this more then once."
"Drinkability: Not bad considering the strength."
"The cocoa is tough to find, and the chiles just don't fill the void. Oh well, I still love DFH, but I won't be seeking this out again."
" A bit hot on the palate, but it's complexity elps. Go exlpore!"
"D: Drinks like a whimsical Fantome Saison (which of course is a very good thing). The abv of 9.0% is incredibly well hidden and will keep you sipping trying to decipher exactly what you are tasting. An unique experience and one that should not be missed. A bomber is the perfect serving and chances are you will seek out more with every sip and drink bringing on a new experience."
"This beer was a pleasant surprise for me. After reading the description, I was expecting (or at least hoping) for an extremely bold, bitter, complex, spicy beer. What surprised me was the rather muted colors and smells, and the taste was also more forgiving than I expected. However, it is still extremely complex. One of the better tasting beers I've had for sure; it's great to find something that is just a completely new experience."
"This beer is luxurious, unique and amazingly well crafted. It is for slow sipping but the sparkling, sweet nature of it also makes it highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: this is a wonderful creation like all of Dogfish Head's ancient beer creations. This needs to be drank with a traditional spicy Latin American meal."
"D- Interesting take on some old world alcoholic drnk. Dogfish Head is always pushing the envelope with these styles. Not saying that it is a altogether good thing but also it's not a bad thing at the same time."
"I expected Theobroma to be a creamy chocolate beer; however it was rather light, fruity, and crisp. The high alcohol content provided a nice warmth--this is a great winter warmer and would make a great seasonal brew. I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Thanks to thirdeye11 for sharing this bottle. Pours golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is lots of fruit, but not the chocolate I was expecting. The taste is also mainly fruit with mango and pear. Maybe a little cocoa, but not very much if any at all. Finishes very dry."
"D - This beer was a huge letdown for me, maybe because I had a predetermined idea of this beer in my head, but it was nothing like what I imagined, especially for a beer whose label has a woman pouring chocolate down her breasts"
"my bro-in-law summed it up nicely...the equivalent to mole` in a bottle."
"D: Awesome blend of interesting flavours."
"Drinkability: At 9% ABV I don't feel right rating it highest, but man it's tasty and goes down smooth and quickly. Really an enjoyable experience, and indeed, the beer is an experience because it is so unusual. However I know that I really love spicy food so I suspect that is clouding my judgment a little bit on this one. Still, I think it's worth trying and savoring and I could see myself trying it again sometime, but not in the same night."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Cloudy straw amber color with a nice thick head that quickly goes away. No real lacing. The aroma of this tells you that you are holding something freaky (which is not a bad thing). First sip felt like popping a Jolly Rancher in your mouth but then your taste buds discover cocca and soon your tongue is tingling with the soft heat of the chillies. Drinking this was an experiance, an enjoyable one at that. This isn't a brew you can drink a lot of but I am thankful for the experiance. Sipping history."
"Pricey drainpour."
"Drinkability: Interesting how the hotness of the chile takes on the role of the bitterness of the hops in modern beers; worth a try but not sure I would want to re-visit very often"
"D: not a sit down and have ""a few"" beer."
"D - One of the best 'experiments'w/ honey, cocoa and chile to me. The taste has great interplay yet still is a drinkable beer I could enjoy this frequently and think anyone who likes honey and chile together would enjoy it. I find the mix of sweet/spicy in flavor/feel/aroma interesting-highly drinkable!"
"Could probably have more than one. High abv is probably the only thing that keeps it form being a session brew. Definitely different, but overall a good chile beer."
" D- This beer has a light flavor with a soft chili heat at the finish. There is a smooth quality with not much alcohol heat and a faint fruity quality that is interesting in the mix. Interesting experiment not necessarily a good drink."
"Had it at Redlight Redlight"
"Perhaps I got a bad bottle. If I ever try this again, and it turned out that this bottle was bad, then I will revise my scores here. But I don't see a scenario in which I try this beer again. Absolutely horrid."
"Lost review from 10.24.09. Pours a slightly hazy golden brown color with a very small tan head that dissipates into nothingness. The aroma is sweet, a bit grainy, light honey and a touch of copper. The taste is a dusting of cocoa, metal and a heavy honey malt. This is followed by a noticable chili flavor that adds a very slight amount of heat. Kind of an odd flavoring but not terrible. The feel is moderate with prickly carbonation, sweet with a touch of heat from the anchos. The brew is interesting indeed. It could use a bigger malt and cocoa presense to offset the honey and chilies. The overriding penny flavor needs to go."
"A surprizingly light beer considering the ingredients. I expected a beer made with cocoa powder and ancho chilis to be heavy, but light malt and honey combine to create a beer with low residual sugars that is quite drinkable. The cocoa and chilis are evident in the flavor and aroma, but their effect is subtle. The chilis give it a spicy kick and a slight fruitiness that turns to a more vegetable-ly pepper-like note as it warms. The beer is a light color with a reddish hue from annato seeds. Very drinkable and quite nice, though I'd have liked more cocoa presence."
"Drinkability - I will certainly enjoy the other bottle I have of this, and maybe sooner rather than later as this one is dated and I just bought a fresh one. It would make for a worthy comparison."
"I hope I just got a bad one since everything else I've had from Dogfish is kick ass. I know it is unlikely I'll ever get another chance to taste this a second time as I'd never make the mistake of buying it again."
"It was a good drinking beer but I would draw the line on one glass with a meal or the flavors would kill your taste buds"
"D: Pretty good, but I wouldn't buy again, maybe I'd order a second pint."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I was glad to be able to share this bottle. I think drinking a whole one on your own would be a challenge. I would buy this again, from time to time, just to have a little something different."
"I drank this beer with my brother-in-law who liked the label and is himself a premium beer drinker. I was intrigued and skeptical since the list of ingredients include chilies and cocoa among others. It poured an orange amber. Nice coffee colored frothy head with nice lacing on the side. The ingredients were noticable yet not overwhelming. The mouthfeel was perfect reminiscent of a Belgian dark ale. this beer seemed autumn appropriate with the ample spicing. I was very impressed with this one and am looking forward to the next. I recommend that you buy a few and share with some people who can appreciate it's complexity."
"A nice beer. I'd call it a strong ale or barley wine. Not sure what the need is for the subcategory ""Chile Beer"" here. The beer packs a punch and is a nice smooth drink. That said, I was expecting more."
"I guess ""old"" beers just aren't my style. I was expecting a chocolate chili explosion of flavor, but got a lightly bitter beer with minimal flavor and a slightly spicy finish. I could pick up the chocolate in the nose, but no cocoa flavor whatsoever. There was some bitterness that must have been from the nibs, but it was far from pronounced. Alcohol was well hidden, went down pretty smooth, but just not very interesting...odd considering."
"Not a bad beer but not one I'd buy again."
"Pours a hazy tangering with a white head. Lots of sweetness in the aroma--sweet malt, some breads, honey, spices, and a bit of chocolate. The taste is very similar with a lot of sweetness balanced out by quite a bit of spiciness. Both the flavors are fairly extreme but balance well. Some cocoa in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium and quite carbonated; the spices linger on the tongue and create a dryness after the swallow. Fairly complex."
"Mouthfeel was okay I suppose. It didn't detract from the beer at all, but I didn't feel that the viscosity or carbonation were hallmark assets of the brew. This weird-ass beer is not the most drinkable. You wouldn't want very much at one time. But the amount that you do have is exciting and fresh."
"Pours a pretty clear, bright amber color with a strong copper twinge to it. Not much of a head and no foam with very sparse bubbling. The aroma is honey and an earthy yeast. Don't really gt any cocoa aromas at all. Maybe just a little spice from the chiles though. The taste starts with some banana likeyeast and a some chili heat on my lower lip. But no chile flavo. The taste overall si fruity, light with some heat from both the chiles and the abv. Still uniqu i flavor, but this bew underwhelmed me. Lots of fruit notes and a soft yet abv. warm palate. This beer is a conversation starter and a nice intro to craft beer for newbies."
"4.5 D: Turned out to be a very tasty and unique beer. Not boring at all and smooth."
"The head crests at about one finger then settles into a slight layer of cream white foam, the lacing about average. Has a dusky orange hue, depending on the angle either more brown or more yellow, great deal of bubbles percolating throughout. The cocoa and honey evident in the nose, flaky dough comes close to cookie dough, also has a noticeable peat moss, lichen foresty element, moves into allspice and something close to cumin, muttering of peach and apricot scents. Full-bodied, not as dense as it is sluggish, rolls into the mouth as a boulder would. The cocoa, chocolate powder and caramel soften the orange, tangerine citrus. The carbonation feels like an expanding balloon before it pops from the pressure. Hoppy bitterness breaks through at the end, some corn and cereal nuances. Repeats itself throughout."
"(D)- Definitely an interesting beer that I am glad I tried, but its not very enjoyable, at least for my palate. The spicy chiles really overpower and create a one dimensional beer that is really not to my liking. All the power to you if you really like this, but its simply not for me. I would have rated it lower, but since it is a great example of the style, I had to give it the respect it deserved for that."
"D - Interesting to try but I probably wouldn't drink it on a regular basis."
"Feels light in the mouth, and I can easily drink this bottle without realizing it (luckily someone is splitting it with me). The carbonation makes this quite refreshing, and it pairs well with spicy food or bbq."
"Kudos to Dogfish Head for re-creating another ancient beer recipe and keeping it off-centered. I don't think I'll drink this beer too often, but it's definitely different than anything I've had before and was fun to try."
"Drinkability is as good as any smooth-bodied ale and it certainly goes down easily. Overall, it's an experience. DFH never completely fits any of the categories their beers wind up in, but I'm glad to have tried this one!"
"Notes: Most common misconception might be expecting an assertive radical brew from this experimentation. The beer is actually nicely balanced with all those flavors present, but in the form of subtle hints, and touches as one goes along. It is not a favorite of mine, but guests often find it very drinkable and approachable, so it becomes a great social brew to share on the table and engage the conversation around a nicely crafted brew with a stimulating story behind it."
"A nice mellow going brew that speaks to quite a bit of malty things in it and drinks down preety smooth given it shows its 9% with just enough give."
"Not bad for an resurrected beer. Not going to make IPA obsolete but this is a different take on the Chile Beer concept. I can certainly see buying this again sometime."
"So, for the intangible ambiguity that is the drinkability rating, I have to admit that it's one of the neatest beers I've ever encountered. All this neat stuff, replicating some ancient recipe--it's like a melodramatic beer. It's fun to share and to talk about, and the label is awesome. Though DFH obviously makes great beverages, they are as undeniably great marketers. For both reasons, I like having this beer around."
"The beer poured a clear, light bronze into a chalice - very thin white head - couldn't really detect anything in the aroma. There were hints of chocolate and hop bitterness in the initial mouthful, with a slight chile ""hotness"" blended with the hop bitterness at the finish. A fairly thin and oily mouthfeel, but not unpleasant. Good carbonation and lacing. A different brew, to be sure. The beer was not unpleasant, and the chile presence was fairly subdued, but not something I would drink a lot of."
"Poured from a bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. Yellowish / orange in color, low carbonation and no head. A smallish head to begin with but it falls away quickly and stays away. The smell is sweet and has a character that i cannot identify. The flavor is simple, almost wheaty, but the brightness of the chili is there, easily. The spice builds on you but does not overwhelm. From all the weird beers from DFH, this has not been my favorite, but it is one of the better chile beers i've had. Good effort."
"Pours a pretty orange (like honey), quite translucent. Not very carbonated, head dissipates rather quickly. No lacing. Chocolates and chiles are prevalent in the nose. Bitter chocolates are quickly followed by hints of chile in the taste. Finishes with an almost whiskey quality. An interesting beer."
"Had this on draught at Pazzo's in Lexington. Pours a light amber color with a tall head that falls quickly and leaves some nice lacing. The aroma has a grassy thing going on with a hint of chocolate and some floral notes. The flavor is strange and complex at the same time. Some sweetness comes through first, but then the spice from the peppers hits and is followed by some chocolate and biscuit flavors. Weird, but nice. The body is on the low end of medium and the drinkability is pretty good."
"Mouthfeel is actually on the lighter side with big prickly carbonation on the way down making it aerate on your palate. None of the flavors are overpowering and it was interesting to drink, although not something I see myself regularly purchasing."
"D: Not very drinkable, the flavors just don't work well in my opinion, don't get me wrong, I love what DFH is doing, this beer is defiantly off centered, just not to my liking."
"CHEERS!!"
"An interesting beer that is pretty balanced considering the ingredients. It will definately be a bottle to drink over two nights after recapping and refridgerating though."
"I wasn't sure what to expect, and was slightly let down, but by no means is this a bad beer. Considering the originality of this beer, I would recommend it."
"Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, slight warming finish. Tasty beer, historically interesting, decent drinkability."
"This really is a good beer, and for concept alone warrants a try. While it's hard to identify each aspect of the brew, together it is pretty tasty and unlike anything else I have sampled. Give it a try."
"Complex and interesting, nicely drinkable, but I doubt I'll look for it again."
"The beer was good but for the ingredients listed and the brewery it came from I expected more."
"An amazingly disappointing beer. Poured a clear yellow-gold with a flat white head that disappeared as rapidly as it appeared. No lacing. Nose was full of honey with hints of cocoa and earthy spice. Very, very faint chile aroma in the nose. Flat, kind of sticky mouthfeel with a long finish. Taste was lackluster. Lots of honey, as in I questioned whether this was a mead. The honey nearly drowned out the cocoa and earthy spice. No chile to speak of. No anchos, no spice. I want to say I could feel some ""warmth"" but think that was more wishful thinking that I could actually taste the chile."
"Theobroma is not one of Dogfish Head's better efforts. I appreciate that Sam likes to push the envelope (and I applaud him for it), but good beer has to be the end result or nothing else matters. For my money, Chateau Jiahu is the much better 'ancient civilization pottery fragment residue recreation' beer."
"Delicious and drinkable, though. I'm torn on this one -- if I didn't know what it was supposed to taste like, I'd like it a lot regardless. But I do wish the ancient ingredients were more prominent."
"drinkability is good. quite unique, this brew is one of the better offerings from Dogfish Head. no alcohol is present other than on the label, and the chilies impart a steady spicy note on the back end that imparts a great character to it overall. cheers!"
"D: An enjoyable beer that is of a very unique style. I'm not quite sure how to rate drinkability here because I've never had anything else like it. But I'd definitely try Theobroma again."
"I still don't understand the controversy around DFH. They are, to my mind, deservedly praised for branching out and making interesting/unusual offerings. This is one of their best."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink brew in my opinion. Again not exactly the beer I was expecting, but I applaud DFH for a beer that isn't over the top."
"Horrible beer experience, why would this beer bring the hype I thought I was excited about this but little did I realize that most of the new DFH beers in recent past besides Palo Santo Marron have sucked balls. I like extreme and big but between this and a beer like Sah'tea, wtf is Sam and company thinking. I do think outside the box when it comes to booze and flavor, recently Bocktown in the Burgh had Woodchuck cider on tap with chai tea that worked so well even after multiple beer heads hated on the creation. I was able to enjoy it, I love chai tea but this tastes like a continuous burn of chili powder cloying honey with bittering spices that should induce a coma. The other ingredients named on the label include honey, cocoa nibs, cocoa powder, ancho chilies and ground annatto. I've drank Midas Touch since the days of clear 750ml bottles, I love chateau however the fuck you pronounce that beer along with a tolerable admiration for Black and Blue and Red and White, but this is an abomination and I've heard to steer clear of the Sah'tea along with the recent big bottled Squall IPA. Pretty bad when your ex brewer who works at Otter Creek is brewing better Mud Bock than your current specialties. I must say I never thought I would taste a beer this bad from DFH, I loved the initial bottling of 90 Min with the guy hammering a nail into one of his nares. This brew opened up my eyes like never before, I can't believe it this beer sucks I can't put it into beautiful or poetic words, please never brew this rainforest creation ever again. BTW, is your palate dead how has this beer remained up in the ratings as a better brew from DFH. Believe me I vacationed at Rehoboth when I graduated school just to get closer to the source this is not the typical brew, but I don't feel I should water down their shortcomings. A cloying mess of a beer with sweet honey and burning chilies fuck that, I want good beer. I like Crazy Ed's Cave Creek Chili beer more than this pure shite. Not overly spicy just a powdered offness from all of the spice additions coming to the party. Hand me a Natty Ice to wipe this flavor out of my mouth!!!"
"Drinks alright for the ABV, I appreciate what DFH was shooting for here, but this isn't a great chile beer by today's standards. Got better it warmed way up, but still not great...I'm sure this would've been in my top 3 beers list 3000+ years ago..."
"d- This was another unique offering from Dogfish Head. I found it to be a sipper. Liked it, but probably would not immediately seek it out again."
"It can't really even be called a chile beer. Theobroma is...Theobroma. I would think any progressive beer drinker who appreciates wild creativity that deftly balances craft and respect for beer would thoroughly enjoy this. And that pretty much describes the whole Dogfish Head ethic, too. Long may they stretch and redefine beer paradigms."
"I found this one highly drinkable, especially for a Chile Beer. Unique and definately worth trying."
"Pours with a golden amber color and very little head. Not a very strong aroma, with a tiny bit of sweetness to it. The taste, however, is very complex and strongly spiced. First comes a sweetness of honey with a strong hint of the cocoa flavor near the end of the drink. The chile hotness lingers a bit in the throat after each drink and confuses the alcohol bite. The beer has a full, solid body that is easy to drink with just the right amount of carbonation: excellent mouthfeel and great drinkability. A very different brew and quite tasty as well."
"D - Just the once was good with me. I split this 3 ways and that was just about right."
"A very good sipping beer that I have had before but am glad I tried again."
"Overall, one of the more interesting spicy/chile beers I've had. I really love the background on these Dogfish beers - it brings out the geek in me."
"I was really excited to try this beer as the promise of a mix of cocoa, ancho chiles and ground annatto sounds really exciting, unfortunately both the aroma and flavor are almost devoid of these. The flavor does have the cocoa, and there is a touch of spice in the finish, but both are pretty tame. My expectations of this beer were a bit too much I think, I still think these ingredients could come up with a much more interesting beer. Unfortunately I didn't really enjoy this beer all that much."
"Pours a pretty orange gold with a medium head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is sweet honey with undertones of dark chocolate. Subtle chile and fruit notes. Taste is slightly sweet at first. Honey again. Chiles in the middle add just a slight amount of heat. Dark chocolate in the finish. Finishes dry with a bit of noticeable alcohol. Very tasty. Complex but everything blends together nicely and no single flavor dominates. Full bodied and pretty drinkable especially considering its strength and uniqueness. A very good and very interesting beer."
"The beer is medium bodied, with thin but very present carbonation. Very easy to drink, I want to buy another bottle for the winter however."
"Keep making these windows into history DFH. They are weird but a lot of fun."
"I couldnt reallly taste much of the pepper however my wife could right away. She didnt drink it straight from the bottle though. The more I had the more I could taste the heat of the pepper & the chocolate.But neither were overpowering. Honestly it reminded me of the Midas Touch only a little stronger. I enjoyed it & would buy it again."
"I guess this is simply a case of ""one mans trash is..."" I'm a big DFH fan but this one won't be passing my lips again anytime soon."
"The chili leaves a warm burn in the back of the throat that I like--a nice kick since, at 9%ABV it's got alcohol but not enough to be reaaaallly warming. Overall, I like it! But I don't love it. For the price, would not buy again--but it's definitely interesting enough that I'd recommend picking it up at least once."
"Drinkability- Could be good in small doses. I don't recommend drinking the whole think on your own. I found the honey to be a bit too much."
"Truly ""off-centered"" - I am happy I got to try this, but do not feel the need to go out of my way to try it again."
"Avoid this beer."
"head retention. The nose had fresh coco and a spicy note. The taste was very well balanced the hops and coco work well together and the malt backbone was there as a perfect suppporting actor. The finish creeps up on you the spicy pepper hits slowly then get hotter the longer you wait for the next sip!! This brew would match well with spicy Asian food."
"Mouthfeel is very light and pleasant, making for a very drinkable brew."
"Others may like this, but for me, DFH missed the boat on this one."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure what to think of this beer. It is adventurous and probably adheres to the age-old recipe. It lacks in complexity and reminds me of a dull Belgian Strong Ale. I think the mouthfeel needs work to make it a more lively brew."
"On-tap at The Pit served in a Chimay chalice a crisp pale orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is an interesting blend of caramel malts, cocoa, and slight chili peppers. The taste is a nice balance of chilies and cocoa that shows the cocoa more as it warms. The beer is on the heavy side of medium and is certainly a sipper. This is a very enjoyable beer on-tap!"
"Drinkability: Overall I'd have another, but just another."
"This is a sippin brew that hit me much harder than the 9% ABV advertised. The pour was rich thick and dark. The head was soapy in appearance but left quickly. The fragrance of malts and fruit abound along with the alcohol. The brew is very nice with fruit overtones and just a lining of chile. The mouthfeel is rich and decadent. I liked the brew a lot with bread and mild asiago. All in all I would suggest that this brew is most positivelly experienced with food but I could definately see my self sippin' on an eight ouncer solo."
"Overall, the chilies in this beer make it enjoyable to me. It may be my current taste, but I could drinkone after another. It's not too rich and not too spicy to make it very enjoyable. Perfect for fall evenings or a compliment to Mexican food."
"I have to say, it's a rare thing for me to say I like a Dogfish Head beer, but this one is certainly an exception. From the moment I poured it, my pre-conceived notions were thrown out the window. I think one of the best elements of this beer is that it challenges the consumer to think differently. A veteran beer snob, knowing nothing about this beer except what the label says, an ""ale brewed with honey, cocoa nibs, cocoa powder, ancho chiles, and ground annatto"" might think as I did: this is a dark beer, a stout or a porter, with crystal and dark roasted malts. To then pour it and see that it is as light as a pale ale makes you stop and think."
"Notes: Ambitious DFH have went for it with this beer and I love that enthusiasm but this was a difficult beer for me to drink. The craft beer community is richer for DFH, though."
"Good carbonation, nice head retention. A golden amber in color. Tasted a little yeasty at first, then a tang spicy, then followed with a mellowing smoothness of chocolate. Smells of a slight hint of honey, then the abruptness of the 9% ABV. Medium-bodied and a bit sweet to the palate. Leaves a pleasant aftertaste from the lingering cacao flavor. Overall, a very smooth beer to drink with a nice mellow flavor. I like this much better than Dogfish's Sahtea. I give an A+ for effort and B/B+ for drinkability (was expecting to have my socks blown off with the buildup of cocoa & chocolate flavors)."
"Pours with a one inch head that doesn't last too long. Smells very good. I get a lot of cocoa and interesting spice notes. The taste is okay. If I forget what I'm drinking I can kind of pretend it's a golden ale but the cocoa bitterness lingers a little too long for my liking. About two-thirds through the bottle though, I was interested in the spiciness brought out by the ancho chilies. That was a high point if only for it's uniqueness. If not for the strange cocoa aftertaste this would be much more drinkable. Definitely very different."
"The taste is as bad as any beer as i have had, and that include triple bock. Horrible disjointed mess of a beer. Way too much dry cocoa powder flavor, and cloying honey. and the chili makes it worse. I really don't like this beer, in any shape or form. I managed to finish my glass, but the rest of the bottle was a drain pour."
"D - This is one of the most interesting beers I have had from DFH, if not in general. I could easily drink more. It is kind of expensive, but well worth the price of admission."
"Birreria Paradiso/10 oz/$4.25 (HH)"
"Overall, this beer is definitely unique. It isn't one that is incredibly drinkable, but, for the experience, and just to sample something experimental like this, it's a good one-timer."
"D - Fine. Interesting enough and regular beer enough to drink more than a glass."
"I had Theobroma once before this. It was on tap at the DFH brewpub in Rehoboth and the keg was over a year old, from what the barkeep told me. In bottle its not too different but does have some noticeable difference. Pours a hazy copper-orange with white head that foams a bit then settles quickly. Aroma has some hints of the cocoa and is a bit fruity. The chile heat is in there too, seeming spicey especially when sniffed with on open mouth (as opposed to smelling with your mouth closed, look for the difference if you've never done it before). Flavor is quite complex with spice and a little bit of heat from the chilies, a small chocolate essence, some honey sweetness and a fruity body. All of the flavors are reserved, which allows all of them to be present though I can't help wonder what it would be like if any one were a bit stronger. This is, in a way, respectable as DFH often maintains an organic feel to their flavors. The mouthfeel is quite interesting as the slightest bit of heat lingers after each sip. Other than that its got what is sort of a typical dogfish body, mouthfeel, and drinkability. Certainly complex and interesting, though I think some (SOME) may be a bit disappointed to find that with all the crazy anticipation one may build upon reading the ingredient list and the beer's background, it doesn't taste THAT crazy or out there. Its still a beer, not chocolate milk or pepper drink."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, nice representation of style without over-powering you with the chili pepper heat, it's not a beer I could drink consistently but it's a good diversion from your typical beer."
"Cheers!"
"A very interesting beer. Where the aroma and taste seem to lack, they more than make up for in uniqueness. You get something new nearly every sip (which may or may not be a good thing at that particular sip), but will be intriguing none the less."
"Drinkability: I can see this as being one of DFH's stabs at a Hefe, as it has alot of light, banana like properties infused here, more so then I get any cocoa or chile properties (although the chiles really hit the palete hard after a couple good gulps). This brew is overly sessionable, very easy to get down and has the right stuff to keep me wondering throughout the whole beer. If this wasn't $12.99 I would make this a regular in my rotation of brews to pick up, but either or, I was very happy I tried this and it confirms my conclusion that Dogfish Head is definetley my favorite brewery. If you see this one the shelf this summer, pick it up and try it. This one will go excellent with some spicy seafood (crab meat with Old Bay seasoning) or even a light pasta dish. Overall another weird, yet perfect effort from Sam and the Dogfish boys."
"I always find it interesting that Dogfish comes up with these wacky extreme beers that always (for good or bad) seem to end up tasting just the way they were shooting for. This is no different, with honey, cocoa, and chile all prominently being on display. Tasty stuff!"
"This poured a clear dark gold with lots of quickly dying off-white head. It smelled like mild copper hops and dirty barley malt, with a bit of earthy chile peppers. It tasted like earthy caramel malt with rusty copper hops and sweet creamy yeast and cocoa powder, with a bit of chile peppers and must. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mild aftertaste. Overall this beer definitely tasted like it was brewed from an ancient recipe. It was very interesting to try once, with nice cocoa subtleties. It had solid body and hid the alcohol well. But the flavor wasn't the cleanest or as succulent as I hoped, instead becoming pretty dull after about half the glass. So finishing the bottle was actually somewhat tedious. Novelty more than quality or drinkability."
"I was so intrigued by this supposedly ancient recipe that I had to try it out. I'm not sure I would buy it again. Between the high price tag, and the extremity of its flavors, it definitely strikes me as a novelty brew as opposed to something one would regularly drink."
"Cheers!"
"750ml bottle obtained at the Liquor Shoppe in Tygsboro, MA. Pours a hazy dark golden-amber body with a half inch of off-white head. Aroma consists of pepper, cinnamon-like quality, with chocolate, bubblegum, nut, and banana. Hot pepper, coming off as a cinnamon like quality, with a fair bit of bubblegum, nut, banana, with come cocoa in the undertones, with some notes of fruitiness. Surprisingly light-bodied with ample carbonation. No alcohol flavor or hotness to speak of, but the alcohol effects definitely make themselves known... Dangerously drinkable, unique, and complex - unlike any beer I've had. I definitely am impressed - if only this had been approved for NH! Really really good stuff - another slam-dunk for DFH!"
"Note: This beer has the greatest label art I've ever seen."
"This is nothing as I had imagined it would be, it is better."
"Three fingers of quick fading straw tan head shrinks to just a skim in about a minute. Body is a light amber orange tone that is almost syrupy. Nose has tones of rhubarb, honey, marmalade and faint spices. On first sip the honey sweetness is quite noticeable as it is thick and syrupy. A raw veggie feel is long on the palate in the middle of this beer. A very slight spicy feel that resembles good fresh garden grown peppers. The veggie meets spice feel really builds on the mouthfeel as you continue to drink and actually makes the mouthfeel very pleasant. This beer really grows on you as you drink and makes it very nicely drinkable."
"D - Like all of DFH's ancient ales, this is a weird one. The spices are muddled and really don't come off very well, but the chocolate is very nice and, oddly, adds a lot to the mouthfeel. This is almost like a spiced holiday version of Midas Touch. Worth trying... once."
"I bought this along with the Sah'tea which I had a few days ago. I expected to like the Sha'tea better than this, but Im very pleasantly surprised with Theobroma. The Sah'tea was a drain pour for me but I have no qualms with this beer."
"D = This is not difficult to get down, but I find myself losing interest pretty quickly,"
"I was not at all impressed with this one."
"overall- like it or hate it, you have to give dogfish head credit for this one. it's not a bad beer, it's just wasn't really what I was expecting. This is also one of my first chili beers, so it's difficult to say if it's really better than others. In short, this one is worth picking up if you like DFH or something different."
"The drinkability was OK but given the burn that I began to develop on my tongue, I am not sure if a second pint would have tasted as good as the first."
"My 100th beer and I'd be darned if it wasn't a chocolate one Not what I expected for chile beer though. Color i orangish gold with a thin white head Has dogfish over the top smoothness. Taste is pepper following sweeter tn I thought it would be cocoa. It was a bottle my brother split with me but I think I could do a whole botlle its hust that smooth and a fairly good taste."
"D- I could drink several glasses of this stuff, it's just too unique!"
"Overall, DFH you are a crazy bunch. This beer was full of surprises. As a big fan of peppers, this beer was something I needed to try. I expected it to be much darker, which is wasn't. Also, the pepper as an accent to the beer rather than the focus was very pleasing. I liked more as it warmed up and the creativity."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Wouldn't have guessed 9% ABV."
"This paired very well with the andouille sausage I had for dinner tonight!"
"drinkability: different from what I expected but this is a beer is different and a solid selection. This will not be a everyday beer."
"Overall, for being a chile beer I was pretty impressed. I have had the opportunity to have several offerings of various chile beers from other breweries and this was easily the best one."
"Drinkability... well, it was OK, but overall, I wouldn't seek it out again. It wasn't the most pleasant experience to finish the bottle. Better than Steel Reserve, but still I had to drink it rather quickly."
"Hope to see this come around every summer, Sam. Please?"
"750 from Whole Foods, Vienna, VA, 2008 bottling"
"We both prefer more full-bodied ales such as DIPAs and stouts, and Theobroma probably won't get a lot of high marks from fans of beers like DFH's 90 Min or Southern Tier's Unearthly IPA (one of my all time fav beers), but it's definitely an interesting beer that I'm glad we sampled. It's one of those beers that beer geeks will enjoy sipping and discussing -- to be quickly followed up by an imperial IPA!"
"I'm glad DFH continued this in '09, and hope it hangs on for the long haul. World class? Yeah, I think so, but that's up for debate. One of my favs. Gotta add that I get that there is a lot going on in this beer, with no real standout of flavor. But that's what impresses me the most: the balance of the brew. No small feat, and Theo shouldn't be penalized for balance as seems to be the case in many reviews."
"I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into a snifter. The beer pours a light orange with a minimal head. The aroma is a bit faint, yet complex, alot going on and it all cancels each other out so I can not pick up much. A bit grassy a bit of chillies but not much. The chocolate is prominent in the taste and the chilies are there in a post quaffing burn. There is a bit of sweetness from the honey, but IMO too much going on. The beer is a medium bodied sipper, that is interesting. But for this BA, one Theobroma is enough for a lifetime."
"A good beer, but to be honest, after months of trying to try this beer, I am a little disappointed - maybe the first time I ever have been with a Dogfish Head brew. In the end, I think it tries to incorporate too many flavors, and the sum of its parts don't contribute to the end product."
"D: Very good taste, smooth and drinkable feel."
"I didn't really know what to expect from this. Except honey, chocolate and chiles. 2 outta 3 ain't bad. That perfumy thing slows it up and mixes with the carbonation. Interesting stuff. Odd stuff. Not bad...not what I expected...but who cares what I expected? It's OK stuff. Kinda interesting. OK, very interesting to say the least."
"The taste is really complex. The best of this style I've ever had. Sweet honey up front, which really intertwines with the cocoa wonderfully. The chocolate takes center stage in this one. The finish is composed of spiciness, and some alc heat. Wonderfully put together. Who wudda guessed choc and chilis would go so well together? Great offering!"
"While higher in ABV, the alcohol was well hidden and I'd rate drinkability quite good for this brew."
"D: A nice, mouthfeel and taste combination. The control of the alcohol made the beer pretty drinkable and warming as well. A nice drinking beer."
"Drinkabililty- This is surprisingly good and drinkable. It's a crazy idea, but I think that DFH once again has pulled it off."
"Wow. I wasn't expecting much from Theobroma. A chocolate/chile beer just didn't sound very enticing at all. I should've known that if anyone could pull it off and make it a success, it'd be DFH. Those folks do extreme beer as well as anyone and often succeed with experiments that have ""fail"" written all over them. Given that this is such a novelty, I don't really have any constructive criticism for it. I'll just take it for what it is. I doubt we'll see a host of chocolate/chile beers coming down the pipe. Overall, this is a success. It's not a world class beer by any means, but it is a surprisingly good novelty. Well worth checking out if you have the opportunity."
"D: Pretty refreshing. I'm pairing this with some Mexican meatballs for dinner."
"A 750ml capped bottle - Brewed in 2008 on the neck. Poured into my trusty Duvel tulip, this ale appears the color of a ripe nectarine with at least two fingers of pillowy bone white foam. The nose is filled with notes of honey, bakers chocolate, and fall fruits. Tastes of slightly sour grapes, grape skins, cocoa powder, honeyed pears, a sourness akin to grape lemonade that's lacking most of it's sugar. The ancho really comes through in the finish and aftertaste leaving the tongue tingling and a gentle burn in the back of the throat. Ample carbonation to match the flavors and aromas. Quite a unique ale, thanks to DFH for taking a chance on this one."
"Notes: I was looking for a bigger, bolder chocolate flavor with spicy kick of chili. I was surprised to find a very subtle mellow brew that still a pleasure to drink."
"Overall this is a very nuanced beer as far as the chilies and cocoa are concerned. I could see this benefiting from a few more months on the shelf. Worth a shot."
"Thanks again, Ryan, for sending and thanks to Barry for encouraging me to find one of these."
"Beer really changes character when it warms up. Let this one sit out for awhile, or just keep at room temp's. Avoid serving cold as the lower temperatures really seem to really mutes the flavors. Serve at room temp for the most desirable experience."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle from Knightly Spirits in Orlando, FL. Beautiful translucent shimmering orange. Thin off white head. I was looking for stronger aromas. Not much. Chiles, fruit. Good amount of malt flavor. Some cocoa and chile. Medium bodied, a bit zesty. Overall, very good. I would say a must try, different. Not sure if I would invest in another entire bottle, but a good experience. I am glad I was able to try it."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/4/3.5"
"This is an interesting beer to try and it is well-made, but the flavors are not as intense as I would like for a $17 beer. Although I won't purchase this beer again, it is worth a shot if you're interested in the concept and don't mind a semi-sweet beer. It was good with barbecued chicken."
"D= Eh. Worth a try and I'm actually really happy I did but this one is just not for me. Won't be having it again I imagine."
"glad i tried it, but this is really only a novelty brew. that said, despite the slight booziness and the strange flavors, it was drinkable enough."
"All and all, I am very impressed by Dogfish on this one. An odd beer done very very well."
"Out of a magnum bottle this beer was a slightly hazy amber color with good rising carbonation and one finger of beige head. The retention was so-so and the lacing no better. The aroma was of pale malt, honey, lots of spices, a hint of chocolate, some fruity esters and floral hops in the background. The flavors were unusual indeed. I tasted the ancho chilies and cocoa powder quite clearly along with the spices and some doughy pale malt. The finish did have enough leafy hops in it to be crisp and a touch bitter. None of the flavors really seemed well-defined however and they all seemed to be competing with rather than complimenting each other. Semi-sweet and rather acidic. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation good. Interesting, but not one I'd quickly recommend."
"Poured a 750ml into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a fairly still hazy amber with just an inkling of a white fish-eyed head. The aroma is odd. Powdered bakers chocolate, with biscuity yeast, and a bit of honey. No really noticeable aroma of ancho chilies. The flavor is quite chocolaty. Not sweet chocolate, but more like a 85% pure cocoa bar. Just a hint of delectable sweetness from the honey comes through. A bit of clove. The tail is pure Ancho, with just a slight burn as it turns down your throat and warms your belly. This is some of the best chile presence I've found in a beer. The mouthfeel leaves great chile burn on the inside of your lips but unfortunately is a little less then carbonated and finishes just a bit to dry. I really wish there was a bit more carbonation to this beer. I give DFH huge props for attempting this recipe and hope the give it a couple more tweaks and turn this into the best Chile beer on the market."
"Overall: A little expensive, but worth a try. I love how creative Dogfish Head is, and this is a prime example of their innovation."
"A very solid beer, that is worth seeking out."
"Interesting complex good brew."
"Drinkability: I found it boring, the chilies are not that present and otherwise there is not much too it. A little expensive for what it is. I basically had to chug it to get the chili flavor out, and then poured the rest. Never picked up any cocoa."
"This beer was, lets just say, different. The aroma was very strange to me. I'm not sure if it was the spicing, or the chilies, but I did not find it very appealing. The flavor was much better than the aroma, but it was overly sweet, like many of the Dogfish beers. The aftertaste did have a very pleasant, grainy, almost cream ale flavor to it. I'm glad I tried it, but I will not be buying it again if it makes a return."
"At 9% alcohol this beer has some definate kick so watch out. I would not, under any circumstances, open more than one of these at a time. It's tasty but I feel like I've been there and done that. I won't seach this out again but if it's on the menu at a beer bar down the road who knows - I might feel like one."
"Overall I was very happy with this choice. I would purchase it again if the price would go down a little."
"D: Drinkability is OK, as the spice hides the alcohol well though I'd be hard pressed to do more than split a bottle with someone."
"Trader's Note: Thanks goes out to CrellMoset for the opportunity!"
"In a word, bestbeerever."
"Don't drink and review."
"D - Expected more chocolate. Interesting but not sure I would buy it again"
"D: Good, the flavor is so different it's a refreshing change."
"Cheers to DFH on this one..."
"I can't see myself drinking too much of this beer. It's not bad, but it's very different than I'm used to. Maybe that's not such a bad thing, but only time will tell. Original, and that counts for quite a bit in my book. Dogfish Head isn't scared of taking chances. You can't say that about many breweries, can you?"
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp and clean. Goes down very easy and alcohol is well masked. A very interesting brew once again from DFH. Certianl worth a try at least once."
"Very unusual, and with the power of suggestion and a little warming, each of the disparate ingredients can definitely be tasted. I don't love it, but I'm always glad to try what Dogfish Head has up its sleeve."
"I was a little disappointed with this one. If you're expecting a unique Dogfish beer, different from anything you've had, you'll probably be so too. It's a very tasty beer, but given the buzz around it, I was expecting more."
"Special occasion beer, here. Would be a great dessert beer. Too sweet and cloying to drink in quantity or frequency."
"Drinkability: These droll historical renditions peak my interest every time and always make for a ripping good time. Chateau Jiahu was mighty fun. Didn't we have one hell of a time with Midas Touch? Though, it is true I was ready to behave like a petulant child for want of more chocolate."
"-Gordon"
" I suppose that for this very unusual style of beer that the flavor is close to the mark. But for a brewer like Dogfish Head (of whose beers I usually really enjoy) this offering seemed to fall short of my expectations of their normally big, bold-flavored brews. But hey, keep makin' 'em and I'll keep tryin' 'em!"
"D: Well for such a big beer, I have to give it props for going down so easily. The taste and aroma leave a little to be desired but not bad, just not that complex. Still has some decent flavor and is enjoyable. I will have zero problem finishing this 750 and that was a worry of mine. Not bad, and solid as most DFH usually is."
"D- A very unique beer that is worth a try. But find a friend to share this with, it is just a bit on the odd side."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Pours a crystal clear deep golden amber color with a minimal head that dissipates quickly. Smells of chocolate and sweet malts. A bit of honey and the chile peppers come through as it warms. Tastes a bit vinous. I pick up chocolate and caramel, honey, a weird spice that I assume is annatto. The peppers come through a bit as it warms but they are really faint. Thick syrupy body and mouthfeel. Light carbonation. Very interesting brew that is quite complex. I expected more chocolate and peppers. This is a beer I'm glad I tried, but probably wouldn't seek out again."
"Pours flat. A dark mead, crystal clear. Minimal carbonation accompanied by light scent. Aroma of honey covered apples. Initially hits honey, dry mead. A space is reserved for flowers with white petals. Then the chilies go, reminiscent of Mexican food, followed by a touch of cocoa. A special offering to be admired and a worthy contribution to the illumination of the sacred ales of the past. Can simplicity be confused for complexity? Of course, and in the simplicity a window of exceptional ale is revealed."
"Pours a dark honey hue with small fleeting white head. A very distinct aroma of honey, lemon zest, pomegranate and chilies. Light in body and flavorful until the end. Notes of spiced honey, floral, lemon zest, chilies toward the finish and a splash of chocolate syrup that hides behind the other ingredients like a shy child behind a parent. A great drink for any season and could accompany many desserts like a flan or even an apple pie. There's a great balance of sweets and sour in this brew that could confuse your head for a while but after indulging in this decadence it becomes clear that there is no beer like this in the world."
"A very good experiment from dogfish head and one I wouldn't mind having regularly. Not nearly as outlandish as it's ingredients would have you believe with only a light hint of the chili peppers and chocolate. Tastes a little boozy a first but goes down easier as you go along. I only wish they had smaller bottles."
"Bottle: Pours golden with small floaties suspended in the brew. The head dissipates fast and there is a little lacing left. Aroma is sweet, spice and a little fruity. Fairly dull on the palate, the carbonation is non existant, but still thick enough to not be watery. Flavor is different. I can taste chilis, honey, and spice. Not really hot but the flavor of chili is there. Not getting any cocoa though. I can drink this beer but I have no desire to get it again."
"The drinkability of this one is excellent. I could have easily and gladly finished a whole 750 by myself, which isn't something I would normally say about such a big beer. It shows both courage and restraint. A real work of genius from Sam and DFH brewery."
"Overall: For Dogfish Head standards, and standards that Sam himself has set with other incredible beers, this ranks in the ""probably wont buy again"" category and one you wouldnt be bragging about to your buddies. If you are thinking about buying it and are in love with Sams other beauties like Indian Brown Ale, Palo Santo Marron, 90 Minute IPA, Punkin Ale, Midas Touch or Raison D'Extra, this might not be your brew. This doesnt explode, not to say explosion is always good, but doesnt even meet the silent killer category."
"overall i dont get the chili at all, but the cocoa is present in small quantities, the flavors do go well together one not overpowering the other."
"Poured a deep brown with very small. Smell was sweet with raison and maple syrup overtones. Taste was sweet and the hney flavor is most dominant did not detect any chile at all. After it warmed up a bit the spice came thru somewhat. OVerall a good brew and nice for sipping on a cold night"
"Drinkability - I could easily drink this all night. I had one then switched to another beer but found myself craving another and quickly switched back. Ended up having four by the end of the night. With the high abv I obviously was feeling good after four."
"DFH seems to have found a very unique style and I look forward to the next batch this summer."
"I didn't want to share this, and you won't, either....at least not your first bottle. More than likely, you'll want to pay attention and savor every drop of the unique contents within this 750ml bottle. In the sense that it has kept me interested, making me write this lengthy review, drinkability is good. In the sense that it is more expensive than most top-shelf Belgians, drinkability stinks. However, this ""beer"" is good enough that I will be buying another bottle, price be damned. You simply have to appreciate the quality ingredients, research, and execution that went into a drink like this."
"This is one of the most interesting brews I've had in a long time. I like it. It's very different, and a really cool idea by DFH. This is definitely something that every beer geek should try. Pick it up."
"Drinkability - Alcohol is well hidden in the taste, but one glass lends a healthy buzz. Flavorful, but a bit taxing to finish off a full bottle. (Having subsequently shared two other bottles, I can say that this is much better enjoyed one glass in a sitting.)"
"Overall, a very interesting beer. It tastes different from anything I've ever had. It's definitely worth a try, but it is a bit expensive (~$13 for 750ml)."
"Clear light brown pour. White head with a minimal amount of lacing. Interesting aroma, sweet cocoa and honey. Rather lively in the mouth, but not over carbonated. Not as sweet as the nose would suggest, more like accents to standard roast malt and piney/citrus hops. Some roast nutty like spice in the finish. Reminds me a bit of a nut brown ale with some cocolate mixed in. Definetely very interesting and worth a try."
"750 ml bottle bought at Toco Giant here in Atlanta, poured into a goblet. Pours a perfect , rich Amber color, lighter than expected (although not sure how I could have expected much given the style). Apparent carbonization led to a medium head, only slightly off-white. The smell is very faint, I can detect the cocoa, but nto nearly as much as you might expect reading the label, and considering DFH history of some overwhelmingly, sweet brews. The taste is solid, but once again, not too strong. The cocoa and honey hints are there, but do not take over the flavor of the ale. For the last time, I was surprised by the lack of overwhelming sweetness and chocolate. Pleasantly surprised though, as it led to a slightly more drinkable style that usual, in my opinion, for DFH. The relatively light carbonization also led to the muted mouthfeel. An interesting beer to try, but certainly not going into the rotation."
"Overall, the concept of this beer is very interesting and it does get some points for being original. It is definitely a beer that is worth trying for it's uniqueness."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a golden orange color with an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is pretty light, it smells like chocolate and honey, not much else from what I can tell. Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma. It tastes like chocolate, mild chilies, honey and a fruity taste that I'm not exactly sure what it is. Overall it's a unique flavor, that's about the only way I can describe it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit dry in the finish and has soft carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and not hard to drink. This isn't what I expected at all, I thought the chocolate and chilies flavor would be stronger. But with that being said, I liked it a lot. It's quite an interesting brew, definitely worth a try."
"Of the historical brews from DFH, this one's by far my favorite."
"The same friend that brought me this bottle described it as ""like drinking a bowl of halloween candy", and I would have to agree. The cocoa aroma and taste are great, but that's about where it stops for me. A good, but not great experiment by Sam and the folks at Dogfish Head."
"Poured into a chalice a nice hazy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little off-white head, with minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, some chili's, coco. The taste is sweet, malty, nice touch of chili's. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well, the finish is dry and slightly bitter. Drinkable, not a bad brew, quite different to say the least. Thanks Tim."
"Drinkability is low to moderate. Really interesting flavors indeed. I'm never a huge fan of their archaeological beers, but I like the idea of doing them which goes a long way for me. I do think it will be rather difficult to finish this champaign bottle by myself though, and really wished I had waited to share this with a few friends. Even a 12 oz pour may prove to be a difficult feat."
"Boring, along with the usual DFH specialty pricetag would probably keep me from having this again."
"D: More than interesting. Very flavorful. I liked it - one at-a-time anyway."
"quite a good beer, another job well done for DFH."
"Nicely done."
"Sweet, simple aromas of honey and cocoa. Taste is malty with a detectable but fleeting nuance of ancho on the backend. Not spicy as one might think from the description on the label. Midas Touch's doppelganger? Good, but not worth the hype of a 750mL bottle."
"Light golden colored ale with a long lasting white head of cream. Nose isn't lacking in its vibrancy, but doesn't have a lot of complexity. Flavor is very sweet, with a honeyed fruit character. Mead-like. Not a complex beer, but interesting and pleasant tasting."
"Easily one of the more bizarre things DFH has done. Poured up a cloudy medium orange colour with a white head. Appearance was about average being neither particularly attractive nor off-putting. Smelled to me like white grapes and bread dough. A strange combination, for sure, but truthfully, I struggle to find those aroma profiles, and really, there isn't much here in the way of smell. There is certainly some sweet malt present, but this is unlike anything I have ever had before. As far as the smell is concerned. The taste is rather strange, too. I can't really discern any of the honey, cocoa, chile peppers, or any other flavours. It's pretty sweet up front, but I don't really think it's from the honey. Then the finish kinda reminds me of Midas Touch, but with the slightest hint of smoke. I really don't know what to make of this beer. It doesn't taste bad. I can drink it, and will have no trouble killing a 750mL by myself as the alcohol is wonderfully concealed. However, it isn't really something I would seek out. Again, Midas Touch comes to mind. A very, very unusual beer, for sure."
"I have a feeling this would go well with a good beef stew"
"Pours a hazy golden orange, almost amber, thin white head forms, quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass, no real lacing, ring sticks around though. Smell is interesting, very malty, bread, honey sweetness, biscuit, vegetables, bit of chile aroma, a bit peppery, interesting. Taste is very sweet and very fruity, honey, corny, honey and caramel, grapes, chile, more peppery heat than spice, lingers on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth from alcohol, very peppery spice finish. Not sure where the cocoa comes into play as I don't get any in either the aroma or flavour. Neat experiment, the chile came through nice, but otherwise doesn't do anything for me."
"drinkability is nice. the heat doesn't overpower. this one didn't really wow me, but i enjoyed it."
"D: Totally different than I had expected. The presence of cocoa or chiles in this beer is substantially muted if noticeable at all. Still, this one is tasty and drinks nicely."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The 9% abv is hidden extremely well. And despite the fact that I cannot taste any hops in this beer, or really even feel them (as in bittering) this beer is extremely well balanced. The chili gives some spiciness in flavor and feel (the feel of dry powder on the tongue...impossible feel to describe but its hinted at in this beer..), the cocoa gives some dy character and some perceived bitterness as it sits along the back of the tongue and roof of the mouth, and the honey provides sweetness. Finish is semi-dry. Body is medium, some weight added by the honey, carbonation is perfect playing off the honey so well. This is one that is dangerously drinkable. If you like Midas Touch, or if you Like mead I guarantee you'll like this one as well."
"Alcohol is well hidden. Medium body, with an almost creamy feel to it. Very easy to drink. The cocoa and chili is not as pronounced as I expected, but still worth a try."
"Been looking forward to this one. Pour into the ever trusty Duvel Tulip is a very clear light amber - much lighter than expected. About a finger of white head quickly recedes leaving slight lacing. It all clears up very quickly - still waters here. Smell is a bit of honey, some nouget. Toblerone chocolates come to mind. No chili pepper presence. Sadly, this is true in the taste as well. Another overly sweet, high alcohol DFH beer. Taste is fine. Sweet. Killing this bottle will not be a problem, but tastes are nothing like what I was anticipating. Little to no cocoa presence, and absolutely no chili. Thankfully, the auslese tastes and aromas predominent in their other archeological creations do not register here. Mouthfeel is fairly watery and smooth with little to no carbonation. Drinkability is good with no noticeable heat for its ABV. All in all, a nice enough experience, but a letdown and not a repeat purchase. Recommended if you are a fan of sweeter beers, but not if you are expecting anything with a strong chocolate presence or chili heat."
"Pours with a three finger, cream head that fades quickly and leaves traces lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium body. Sweet spicy nose. Flavor is a sweet, smooth, some cocoa, honey but can't taste the chilies. The early Hondurans (1200BC) had something going here. Worth trying even at $12.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, Me"
"I gave the beer a 5 for drinkability (not a real word) in the sense that it is able to be drunk."
"Poured into a tulip glass, nice orange/straw color, the foam/lacing quick to disappear. The smell was more of what I'd call a mid-grade lager smell... kind of wet-hay, barn smell. I could not detect the chilis or the chocolate in the smell. Early tastes were more of the lager-barn variety, which disappointed me. I thought of all the malt/backbone flavors to pair exotic chocolate and chili with, this didn't seem to be the one. As I worked through more it began to open up and be more balanced - the maltiness holding the chili/chocolate in check. I began appreciating the uniqueness of the beer, but still not really enjoying it. The mouthfeel was not great - kind of a heavy lager feel to it. The drinkability was not great due to many of the factors above. It was easy enough to drink (not too hot, bitter, or stringent), but still the overall viscosity and heavy lager-like (I know it's not a lager) flavor, just made it more of a chore to work through it. Interesting, but not special enough for the price."
"Additional Notes- I was expecting it to be a chocolate beer, but was pleasantly surprised."
"D- Really easy to drink. It's so complex that you want to savor it and explore its flavors. Not too heavy, but so complex and wonderful. I am thoroughly impressed with this one."
"Still glad I tried it though..."
"Again, not at all what I expected. Certainly interesting, but not nearly as exotic as I would have guessed from the description. A tasty beer, and one I'm glad I tried, but not quite unique enough to seek out. Certainly a good one to share, interestingly sweet and flavorful. Very drinkable as it is - nicely balanced and easy to sip on."
"I'm a big fan of the concept behind these archeological beers from DFH, but I'm kinda a geek that way. This one is vaery interesting and quite succesful from a beer point of view as well. Pours a lighter shade of orange with a short head that fades to a thin swirl. The smell is fairly light, but I smell the ancho chilis, and perhaps a slight herbal, mineral bitterness from the annato. The chocolate is rather light, and smells faintly creamy. The taste is very nice, much more pronounced in flavors, but balanced and still somewhat subtle. Creamy chocolate that tastes almost like cacao pulp, somewhat herbal, soft and lightly chocolatey. There is also an underlying lightly fruity, roasty chili flavor that segues into a final nutty creaminess. Although I think this is rather lightly spiced, I find that the chili definitely is present and adds a distinct element. Very smooth and creamy and doesn't at all seem like a 9% beer."
"I like this offering from DFH."
"Drinkability- Insanely interesting and very tasty as well. I would highly recommend this to anyone. If you don't like chili beers, give this a try. It's nothing like Crazy Ed's and totally different than Rogue's. Yummy!"
"Pours a hazy rustic wheat tinted amber color with a HUGE off-white foamy head that resists fading. Gotta love that head...takes it better than a 4.0 but the hang time makes it less than a 4.5. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing in it's wake. The smell is really interesting, but timid. At first nose i'm flushed with an earthy Belgian yeasty character that leads me to a harvest fruit like aroma... saison / farmhouse-like at first. If i let my imagination run wild i sense that earthy yeast thing breaking down to a malty NECCO chocolate and that ever so light tangy texture may actually be the chili... i'm sooo not familiar with. The nose is scoring points for complexity as it warms up. Again, I'd go something slightly more than a 4.0 because of the complexity, but less than a 4.5 because the characteristics are subtle. The mouth is adequately carbonated, medium bodied, fundamentally creamy with a nice tangy note. The texture complements the flavors nicely. Again similar to a farmhouse but with a mild chocolaty aftertaste that lingers in the aft-roof of the mouth. The 9% ABV is integrated well...enhancing its drinkability...beware, that's real alcohol content they're advertising!!! This one is another pure pleasure to consider!! Where would we be without the folks at DFH experimenting with these off centered notions of historic ales. Cheers!!!"
"This is more like a 'kitchen sink' beer than a chili beer. It's got all the crap that the ancients could think of, including a little bit of malt. The beer has a bright copper-amber hue at first, but poured a hazy rusty hue toward the end of the bomber. Head formation was fair, as well as retention and lacing. Rich aromas of honey, chocolate, toffee, and molassas fills the nose along with herbal and perfumy notes. Flavors strongly favor the honey and mask a lot of the malt base. Very sweet to taste with a powerful underlying taste of cocoa, almonds, pecans, and cashews. Again, hints of corriander, orange peel, cherries, cumin, and a flowery note give the beer a lot of complexity. Flavors of the chilis gain intensity and are noticed going into the finish. The beer's weight favors the honey as well, but allowing a soft malt blend to substantiate the beer. Quite warming from mid-palate on from a blend of the chilis and alcohol. The heat never offends but does give the beer a little something extra. The chilis also seem to balance the sweetness with the low hop (if any) additions. A very nice experimental beer. I'll have to see how this one ages out."
"Pours a ruby orange in color with no head that forms too long on the pour. Smell is very floral with a good amount of honey. Taste is fairly sweet, light and refreshing. I'm getting a bit of light fruit as well. Really clean and amazingly non-cloying in the mouth. I've taken several sips of this beer and still can't figure it out. There's just so much going on in this beer that it keeps it interesting. Good and very interesting beer, but not setting the world afire."
"I find this beer very interesting and drinkable considering it's 9% abv. It's making me wish I had a dark fruit dessert of some sort, maybe a rum raisin cake or some bread pudding(mmm)."
"I'd definitely try this one again and would consider hanging on to a bottle for a special occasion just because it is a pretty neat beer. This isn't just a novelty styled beer but a good beer that can stand up on its own."
"I'm not really sure what to think about this beer, it doesn't blow me away, but then again not too many beers have that quality. There are things in this beer that I've never experienced (I realize I sound like I'm not writing about a beer at this point) but it really doesn't impress me that much. Appearance is lacking and aroma could use a boost, but really I'm only saying this because that's what I want to match in my head. The truth is this beer has an interesting mix between sweetness and spice that might create an interesting drinking experience for some people, but right now, I'm just not that person."
"A good beer, very easy drinking that shows nothing in the way of 9% abv. Almost tastes like a lager. Bready malts with a crisp carbonation on the finish that helps things end creamy. Light cocoa attributes. Wonderfully balanced and sophisticated beer. Lack big complexity but sometimes the over complex gets old."
"Overall I was very disappointed in this. I remember reading of the Aztecs making chocolate drinks with chilis and I was hoping it would at least have some flavor aspect from those ingredients."
"Cheers"
"D-Needless to say, this is a first of many for me. It improved vastly with time sitting at the stick looking for my next glass. Overall, I'm proud to have a limited production from Dogfish and won't need to worry about the buying limit."
"Had at the Union. Thanks TP!! Poured into a small pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a thin off white head. A little fizzy. Smell is very faint. Light amounts of chocolate and some sweet malt. Taste is all over the place- but fantastic. I get some chocolate at first but the mouthfeel is fantastic- very light and fizzy. It is like you cn fel the chiles at work. As the beer warms I get the full complement of flavors-some chocolate, spices, cinamon, chile and even some coffee. How they do all those in a beer that is not a thick, syrupy stout or proter astounds me. Great beer- very original!"
"D: Really weird beer. Glad they went out on a limb to make something like this. I don't know if I would want this all the time but it was good."
"This was quite unlike any beer I've ever had, and I still feel ambivalent about it. The beer was an orange color with a small white head. It had a faint cocoa and spice aroma. A cocoa taste with a peppery background. The pepper lingered for a long while, but was not unpleasant. I'd like to try this again."
"Overall a very well done beer."
"A sipper due to the spicyness, but not at all detracting from the overall experience. A unique beer."
"Thanks to edbeer for sharing this one. Poured a translucent honey gold with a half inch off-white head. Some stringy lacing, but weak legs. Nose is earthy, spicy and cocoalicious. Cocoa character is amplified in the nose as the brew warms. Dominant flavor is cocoa/baker's chocolate (but a little sweeter), as well as honey and a subtle chili spice presence. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium with an even level of carbonation throughout. A truly interesting beer. So much complexity for such a light-bodied/colored brew and character changes as it warms. Well worth a try."
"Unusual and interesting flavor, but not one that I could deal with on a regular basis."
"D: Eh. Nothing special and I can't imagine it would improve much with time but I've been proven wrong by DFH before."
"Somewhat pale in color-I dont know quite what to expect. Sort of a very pale orange/amber color. Ok aroma-quite fruity-blend of lemon and other citrusy smell. Faint whiff of honey. Malty flavor with a fairly high level of sweetness. Honey like flavor in the sweetness. Very, very mild chile flavor. A slight drying taste which I am thinking is off the cocoa. Good mouthfeel-very light bodied. A very drinkable and interesting beer. Not knowing what to expect after reading the label is sort of strange. Well crafted and quite different. I like this a lot more then say Pangea, Midas Touch or some of the other ""historical"" beers they do. Great label too!"
"An ""interesting"" sipper. Yeasty/bready, but with subtle complexities, then a hot pepper kick that cleaned out my sinuses. A hot, even burning, brew, though with noticeable breadiness and honey that should take some of the heat off. This is one of those that is better to be shared and discussed (as a ""conversation piece""), IMO. This bottle states 9% abv, but maybe because of the chili, it seems hotter."
"Pours gold with a frothy white head. Nose is mild chiles. Flavor is smooth. Slight bite of a pepper/childe burn there. A smooth sweetness is there as well. Very smooth. Feel is slick smooth with a biting carbonation. Overall a nice brew. And for being a chile beer, doubly so. Smooth and not so straightforward that it just burns on the mouth. A real pleasure to drink IMO. Kind of comes off as nearly a spiced Belgian ale of sorts. I was thinking of taking the two bottles I have and trading them if I got a chance to try it on tap. But now I might change that and keep one to drink for myself."
"The beer pours a hazy amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a very complex array of aromas from pale and crystal malts to cocoa and chilies. It's unlike anything I've ever encountered, but in a cool unchartered territory kind of way. The taste is decent as well. It's smooth with hints of cocoa, but warming in the finish with a hot pepper hit. The peppers are there, but are hidden in the cocoa flavor. You don't feel it until it hits your stomach. It kind of burns. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer is interesting to say the least. I'm not sure I'd buy another one at $12 dollars a bottle, but it was an experience."
"A highly interesting beer and proves once again that DFH isn't afraid to experiment."
"Large DFH style bomber, love the Aztec/Inca style graphics on the label. Pours clear, light amber, with glowing/fiery orange highlights. Minor lace/head. Smoky/sweet nose. Smoke, unsweetened chocolate, earth, slight glimmer of chili spicing. Interesting and different creation by those innovative DFH brewers. Cant say its one of my favorites or that I would spring ($12.99 for the bomber) for it again."
"I guess I was hoping for something exotic, and it just seemed a little half-hearted. Carbonation was light and carried it nicely, but I didn't want any more after the one glass."
"this beer is WEIRD! that doesnt mean its bad. I was expecting to have all these different flavors. I couldnt put my finger on what it smelled/tasted like. The color was an orangey copper. I drank it out of a snifter but i couldnt decide what the aroma was. It was interesting and delicious. I am glad the apv was on the lower side for DFH. I dont know what this beer is, but it is a good effort. drinkability good and so is the mouthfeel. try it if you can."
"One of the most different and unique beers Ive had. Id expect nothing less from these guys, at the end of the beer I grew to love it. Would have guessed the alcohol to be under 5%."
"So, it's another landmark brew from history, resurrected by Dogfish Head, and I am, once again, amazed. Theobroma is excellent, if in an odd, 'traditional' way. Never confined by any semblance of in-the-box thinking, the folks at DFH could probably make beer out of briars and bathwater that would taste good, sell like mad, and otherwise earn the respect of discerning drinkers everywhere."
"Drink ability- not what I was expecting at all but a very good beer overall by dfh. Overall a easy beer to drink."
"I've been waiting for this ever since hearing about it. Not as good as I'd hoped, but a very interesting beer and a must try. I've got another bottle to age - perhaps a little time will do it some good."
"D - Another great beer from Dogfish. This is awesome."
"D- keep drinking, it only gets better. Highly drinkable except for the availability. You can only get 4 bottles at the Rehoboth and Milton locations so feel free to horde whatever you can buy!!"
"Drinkability: Interesting beer, I might like to drink one every now and then, but I don't think I'm drawn to consume it regularly."
"Drinkability- Well the first glass was nice. The second was a little hard to get down and the third was easy again (had a buzz). It can be sort of cloying at times and the dry finish seems to escalate it. I highly doubt the first beer tasted anything like this but it's a cool concept and a decent beer to share with a friend."
"Drinkability: Alcohol's up there, but this is one hell of a complex and interesting beer. I split the bottle with my father, which may have helped (he was quite taken aback by it, by the way). It's not one I could have every night, or every week, or even every month. However, it was very reasonably priced for a 1 pint 9.4 oz. beer of this complexity, and could definitely be a good special-occasion beer (as many of DFHs are). It was definitely a conversation starter at my table (even my mom liked it, which is rare)."
"I am surprised I liked this beer as much as I did, as I have been repulsed by Chile beers in the past. A well balanced beer with a good flavor, even with the chilies."
"Not a miss for DFH by far, but I think I will need to try some further aged bottles in a few months to see the full potential."
"D: The alcohol content is pretty high and it becomes more and more apparent as the beer warms a little. Certainly an intriguing beer, as DFH will be. The scent stands out in particular, though the 'buttered popcorn' smell starts to go away as it warms."
"Pours a bold orange/red with a full ½ inch white head. Smells of cloves, spices, vanilla, and honey. First sip is both spicy and mellow - very complex . A creamy milkshake like smoothness adds to great mouthfeel. Unfortunately, there is simply too much going on here with no one flavor taking charge. It is just a mess."
"Eric"
"Well-hidden alcohol."
"Without question, and regardless of anything else, I'd have to say that this is one of the most unique beers on earth at this point in time!!! That's not too unusual for DFH, however, as I think they did that years ago with Immort Ale. And there have been quite a few more in between. That said, it's a bit of a 'must-try'. Beyond that, it's actually pretty drinkable. At 9 or 10% abv, it's small glass fare, meant to be savored not quaffed, and a bottle can be split between 2 - 4 people easily. Not to be missed!"
"D- Really easy to drink even thought the higher ABV and the chilli."
"Seems very drinkable but I don't really see how it stands out. It's well done though. Definitely would shine with some aging."
"Drinkability: moderate. The flavors are not off-putting, but the combination is strange. It certainly doesn't taste like a 9% beer, which is dangerous, but there's something about it that makes me content to just leave the glass on the table a bit longer than usual."
"Unlike any other beer Ive ever had. There is really no cocoa nibs or cocoa powder taster, I Thought it would pour dark but ended up pouring light/ a tint of orange. I waited for this beer since I heard about it, I was impressed because it was so different. I could not pinpoint one flavor except maybe the honey on the finish and a little cinnamonesqe smell on the nose. Really great effort by DFH. try it if you see it, my review will make a little more sense"
"Considering the beer has chili in it, it's a very sweet and flowery beer, not much spiciness at all. Makes for a good dessert beer."
"Nice chewy, yet smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of honey and grapes, reminiscent of Midas Touch are then cut with a blast of subdued spicyness that builds in intensity.	A subtle chocolate presence appears in the finish, with notes of hot cocoa. Alcohol is nicely masked. All in all a nicely balanced beer and a return to historical fashion in the vein of Midas (I didn't care for Jihua)."
"D: Very interesting and tasty enough. 9% is a bit limiting but it's nearly undetectable and drinks pretty easy. Glad I got to try it but I'll probably trade mine."
"Overall, this was unique beer and I am glad I had the opportunity to try. Would I buy it again? Probably not, no thanks - too light bodied and strange for me..."
"Nicely done DFH, when are you bottling?"
"served on-tap at the rehoboth brewpub, this was a very interesting experiment and something i'd get again. billed by the server as a chili and chocolate beer, i expected something dark, roasty, and spicy. what arrived, however, was a clear gold, viscous-looking beer with a nice creamy white head and thick lacing. pale malty dough, honey, and floral notes in the bouqet with a hint of cocoa butter preceded a taste of prominent fresh sweet malt that led to a semi-drying finish. nice bit of cocoa butter on the back end along with some vague spice. rich, full mouthfeel with just the right level of carbonation. this surely doesn't seem like the 10% we were told it was."
"Drinkibility was not as good because it was so sweet."
