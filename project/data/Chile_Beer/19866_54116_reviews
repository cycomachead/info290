"Overall this is a very unique chile beer, one that I'd seek out to try again for sure."
"A little buttery. Wouldn't mind more heat."

"Bottle (750 ml). Shared by mathieuc, thanks! Hazy yellow with a low white head and some lacing. Aroma is yeasty with mint notes, lemony and light spicy notes. Taste is lemony and yeasty at first with light fruity notes, but when the peppers are in there and take all over the place. Light body. Good carbonation. Hot mouthfeel, too hot for my liking in fact. I strongly prefer the regular version of the Four."

"holy sour chili beer! the perplexity of this beer starts with aroma and ends about 5 minutes after you finish your last drink. the appearance is a golden hue with minimum white head. the head settles out to a weird flocculation partially due to the bret n chili. the aroma is mostly brett and strong super citrus. the taste is a whole new ballgame. its initially like a traditional wheat/saison hybrid (session-able/ coriander/ peach) then it its touches on the side palette with bret and spunk. it hits the back of the throat with huge chili flavor. the worst. the worst part about this beer is when it gets room temp... its better with more enticing flavor. this is one i look forward to having this around during the summer time to grill with."

"I was definitely a big fan of this beer. It poured very crisp, clean and clear and the aroma eminating out of the tulip glass was a blast of citrus goodness that made my mouth start watering. The taste was right in line with the citrus but slowly evolved with heat and the mouthfeel was so effervescent and finished clean with the lingering slight burn of the peppers. Loved it, finished it before I knew it, want another one."

"one of the most unique beers ever. a low alcohol sour beer, blonde in color with a splotchy white head, with african chili peppers as hot as habanero. the nose on this is just amazing, bright citrus notes after the intense tartness and lactic sourness back off. mouth watering fruits, pears and peaches, and very little clue of the peppers at all. the flavor starts like a neat blonde sour, maybe sour mashed, acidic but not caustic, soft in feel and very light on the grain front. next comes a strong wave of citrus fruit, followed immediately by an slowly escalating heat that warms the throat and tongue after the swallow but never gets too hot. its a brilliant showcase of this peppers flavors without detracting from the beer with a stomach wrenching heat. finish is long and warm without being too much at all. i can hold the beer in my mouth and taste it for 30 seconds if i want to, but the peppery heat doesn't come on until i swallow it. very light body on this, and plenty of sour. my first chili sour beer i think, and its a major success. some of the best upright beer I've had for sure, and something that demands food pairings of the most interesting sort. so cool."

"This was my first beer from Upright Brewing (Portland, OR). I drank this beer during Super Bowl XLVIII, as the Broncos' championship hopes were being crushed. However, this Fatali Four was a bright spot in an otherwise forgettable Super Bowl experience. The beer poured a hazy golden color with a medium white head. The smell had notes of lemon, wheat, and Brett funk. The taste was quite exceptional. The flavor reminded me of a fresh squeezed summer honey lemonade with big floral notes, Brett funk, and cayenne peppers on the finish. I say ""summer honey"" because this beer had huge floral notes throughout, which are associated with honey harvested in the summertime. I was amazed by the complex balance of the lemon tartness, the floral honey sweetness, and the spicy kick of cayenne-like pepper on the finish. I thought the flavors really played beautifully with each other. This may have been my favorite chile beer of all-time, as I really liked how the Fatali peppers played a complimentary role to add another element of flavor dimension rather than having the entire beer be dominated by chile heat. I was really impressed with Upright and am looking forward to trying more of their beers."

"Thank you%2C Brian. My Upright spree continues. %0A%0AGushing%2C this beer is a mildly hazy yellow with a thin%2C dense%2C white head with decent retention and minimal lacing. The nose is awesome.

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, herb, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with sour and chile flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of chile heat on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower good of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice chile presence that works well with the base beer."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is light and easy drinking with a very unique and enjoyable arrangement of flavoring. You get the expected character of a saison that is somewhat wild with lemony lacto notes and then the pepper inclusion is a total twist with the perfect amount of heat. Upright really does it for me yet again. Color me impressed."
""
"Overall another interesting, tasty saison from Upright. Along with Logsdon they pretty much have the domestic saison market cornered."
""
"O: This beer is decent. I think this bottle is a bit flat, to be honest. There just isn't much carbonation to make the flavors of the saison really pop. The heat on the back end it really enjoyable, and a bit unexpected, even though I knew it was brewed with peppers. I would love to try this again someday. I'm a real sucker for pepper beers."
"Fatali Four pours a light bodied, mildly cloudy and bright yellow gold in color with a two finger bright white head. It's surprising how light in color it is. The nose is bright and citrusy with a good amount of lemon with a touch of citrusy sweet followed by a moderate amount of pepper. For a pepper beer, the nose is overly complex. The flavors are all saison up front. It's light and really citrusy with a good amount of lemon and a night, almost Berliner Weiss esque tartness. The beer then goes into the pepper, leaving your mouth with a light tingle from the heat for the next five minutes. It then leaves your mouth watering. God I love this. It drinks light and crisp and the tartness is perfect. This is by far the best pepper beer I've had, and I've searched them out. This beer is definitely worth a try. It's some of Upright's finest work."
"Poured a hazy golden yellow in color with pale yellow highlights and a very thin bubbly head that left very minimal wisps of lacing sticking to the glass. Citrusy and tart character were noticeable on the first whiff with a little malty sweetness, some yeasty notes and slight chile notes coming through. Very nice tart spicey flavors upfront on the palate but the chile spice is well balanced and not over done. I did get a little grain, mild bretty funk and citrusy accents. The brew was medium to light in body with moderate amount of carbonation which had a mild funky, citrusy, slightly spicey tart and subtle dry finish. Very well done beer and enjoyed it for sure."

"Well, this was quite exceptional. A light cloudy straw-orange body with a healthy white froth - very light and refreshing. Tartness perfectly in balance with a kick of heat from the chiles - funky and yeasty, lots of lemon and earthy must, dry finish. Lined this up with a spicy dish for dinner - will be going out to find more of this ASAP."

"O - Whey did I wait so long on this one? Unique and great."
""
"Medium bodied but fuller than expected with a really nice balance of zesty spice, hot peppers, farmhouse yeast and light fruit.  Apple, pear and banana with hay, straw and a nice pepper presence that's not overly hot.  Really well balanced with the peppers nicely integrated.  Surprisingly drinkable considering the heat.  A lot of pepper/chili beers are gimick-y and insanely hot but this beer was complex, well balanced and very tasty."
""
"Drinkability is through the roof, this is a fantastic saison. The pepper note really adds some interesting depth without overwhelming the base beer."
""
""
"Half finger slightly off-white head on top of slightly haze medium gold body, no visible carbonation. Big dose of funk in the nose totally subsumed any chile aromatics, threw some lemon-like esters, floral hops pushed into the background. Taste mirrors the nose, brett inspired funk, more sour than tart, though I was surprised how little chile was present, got minimal warming, certainly paled in heat and chile aroma comparison with the Hot Blonde. Mouthfeel medium, decent effervescence, pretty dry finish. The PDX homies told me this was more sour than previous batches, and I'm alright with that, though wish more chile heat had shown through."

"(D)- An interesting twist on the style with the hefty spicy chiles. You cannot see much from the barrel aging aspect, but the chiles sure throw their weight around. I will be the first to say I really do not care for really spicy chile-type of beers, but this one is more up my alley than most I have had."
"pour is light yellowish orange with a tight white head. The nose is very interesting and has a nice light spice to it. Minty and sweet bright apricot with a sweet doughy aspect and light vanilla. The taste is similar, spicey, interestingly sweet and doughy. The peppery spice is more assertive with the fruit favors still bright, a touch acetic and rather sour. The body is well carbonated, light and airy."

"Beer is light in body, late spiciness, decent not overpowering. There is this mild floral sense and this nice vegetalness that finishes a little dry. I'd have this again."

"O - Upright really uses the peppers in a good way with this beer. With so many spiced beer disasters, it's nice to see this one turn out for the good. I would definitely have this one again...really unique and quite good."
"I never thought to add chiles to a beer as light as this Belgian-style thing, but it works. A nice blend of crisp fruit, funk and heat. I dig it."
"Beer pours a clear golden-orange with a thin white head. Interestingly, it's noticeably darker than the regular Four. The aroma doesn't really prepare you for what's to come, it smells more like a typical Upright saison with a hint of spice/pepper in there. The flavor, however, is a whole different story. I typically think of chile beers as a bit of a gimmick, but this beer is the first of its kind I've had that really did a fantastic job of incorporating the peppers into the flavor of the beer without having it overwhelm it. The light, slightly spicy, more typical-saison Four's flavors just meld perfectly with the spicy peppers, and you get a nice, mildly spicy kick at the end. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this beer. Kudos to Upright for trying something bold and succeeding so thoroughly."
"Body is light and effervescent. Good heat through the finish. Another excellent saison offering from Upright. Why am I not surprised?"
""
"O: As my chest warms and my lips begin to burn I am finishing my beer. Not something I could have all the time or lots of, but I really enjoyed it for what it was. Nice work Upright!"
""
""
"O: Complex mixed assembledge and very enjoyable. Would like more."
"O: Very good beer. Similar in a lot of ways to the anniversary beer they did for Belmont Station last year due to the similar malt base and barrel usage. If you liked the 14th anniversary, then you'll like this one. Just expect a slight heat on the finish. 4.5/5"

"Bottle from Brewery Creek. Crazy and yummy. Frosty golden yellow body with a small white head. Some lace. Funky aroma. Sourness and spice drives good drinkability.Grapefruit, lemon,vinegar and sugar. Best Uplands yet, despite big carbonation. A little bretty, a beer soup."
"One of the better pepper beers I've had. Appearance is mildly cloudy golden citrus with a soapy off white head. Minimal retention and lacing. Aroma is deceptively tame. Citrus, mild funk with a touch of pepper. Pleasing, but suggests a tame saison with a mild kick. Flavor is similar to the aroma, initially citrus and juicy flavors dominate before some light saison funk. Finish gets hot and the long aftertaste becomes pleasant warm, singing the roof of the mouth and corners of my chest cavity. Slightly under carbonated and watery in the finish. Reminds me of my favorite, Saison Vautour with a respectable pepper addition. Very impressed."
"The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation, not particularly saison-y. A very interesting beer, how a ""pepper"" beer should be, good burn, but not so overpowering it takes away from the rest of the beer."
"O (D) - The spice is too much for me. I'm pretty sensitive to it, and at first it's pretty tame, but after a while, it is too much."
"Both pour a clear golden orange with lots of carbonation. The regular four has a crazy amount of head. Fatali four is fairly minimal headed. Both smell a bit funky. The fatali has a nice kick of pepper on the nose. Both have a wheaty saison scent that is great. Both taste nice and wheaty. A nice funk. The fatali has a huuuuge pepper on the back of the tongue. They are both really solid saisons! The moth feel is solid. Smilar carbonation on both. Overall both are tasty. Fatali is incredible compared to the base beer. Very unexpected :)"
"Overall a great interesting complex beer. This is the most drinkable chile beer I have ever had. One of the most unique beers I have had."
"D: Not always the biggest chili beer fan, but the peppers played well with the tartness of the beer and were not overdone."
"One of the most interesting beers I've had in ages. Fatali Four is an intensely flavorful beer that has to be taken slowly, or its sharper intensities can become overbearing. And I'm taking it slowly, I've got all night."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/4"
"- Overall not the most drinkable beer.. just might be too hot for some, though not for me. I like it, and I like how the heat sneaks up later without ruining the beers great backbone."
"I'd say that the beer overall was an interesting combination of Four with the Fatali chilies, but I'm not sure I'd drink a whole pint of it given how spicy it was. Though I'm sure it would have gone great with food. I would like to see how some of the wild yeast, notably Brett, work on this beer later on as there were no hints of it in the current profile of the beer."
"While OK, I can't say I found this to be a particularly memorable effort from the folks at Upright."
"D: It is the #4 (which I really enjoy) with a perfectly savory/mouth-watering warming of peppers added in perfect quantity for my tastes. Love the result and am sad to see this one go. Among the more interesting new beers I've tried all year. My vote is cast for a reappearance in 2010."
"damn, this is one of the best fruit beers i've ever tasted. and this being the bottom of the last keg, i think i inherited some extra testes-enhancing scorch. no worries, i can handle it."
