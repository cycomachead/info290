"When I was 17, one of my friends sprayed pepper spray in my basement. Drinking this was a terrible reminder of that day."
"Holy crap. What a beer. This was very different with the powerful taste. It was worth trying but hard to drink more than two glasses of due to the power of the spice."
""
""
"Yeah I rated it high.  Its everything the label says and then some!  If you don't like heat, you wont enjoy this, but if you enjoy hot hot peppers your in for a treat!"
"good spicy brew worth a try"
"Not sure what everyone was expecting when they bought this but I like hot and this beer came through ."
"Peppers were still there after letting it sit"
"Can't taste the bourbon at all, the peppers completely overpower everything."
"Taste-A literal ""hot mess"". Even with, or maybe because of, a year in the cellar this brew was just too much heat and pepper flavor to achieve any real balance in my opinion.  I split this brew with another veteran craft beer drinker and we were hard pressed to finish it all. We didn't have the tastebuds left to try the ""Punishment"". I'll give that one another year and see what happens. Here's hoping."
""
""
"just awful. i enjoy spicy food, not spicy peppers in my beer. instant heartburn, complete waste of time and money."
""
""
""
"What did you all expect?"
""
"Not for those who do not enjoy heat. The Oaked bastard taste comes out very strongly, followed by an intense heat which lingers, and settles into the glorious lucky bastard finish. Fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"overpowering pepper flavor, bourbon taste is almost demolished and barely perceptible.  A sipping brew for those that like heat, lots of heat.  But this bastard was destroyed (ruined per Stone).  Rather than waste the rest, I used the 2nd half of the bottle to marinade a skirt steak for Carne Asada, interesting enough, here the bourbon barrel flavor came out stronger than the peppers.  Although this is a rather expensive marinade and still was not up to my usual skirt steak seasoning, although it was interesting."
""
"This is spicy...For me, it wasn't enjoyable to drink.  I imagine, for those who love pepper, this is great.  Even thought this wasn't very enjoyable to drink, it is well made.  I love hot and spicy food, but this isn't my cup of tea."
""
"I have enjoyed most things I have purchased from Stone over the years.  This (and Punishment) were the expensive exceptions.  The peppers were over-powering, to the point that I couldn't enjoy the ale and had to get rid of it."
"Definitely not for someone who hates heat. Somewhat of a novelty beer in that it has tons of punch to it. However, I have no problem eating a hot pepper. Taste the bourbon barrel aging, however the capsaicin does take over a little too much. The beer will not burn your face and make you cry for water however, though it would be great if the heat was turned down a bit for the next batch if there is one."

"Plenty of heat! Very situational beer! Went well with a hearty breakfast."

"Now THERE'S the chili beer I've been looking for! Holy hell this is hot. I am a heat lover through and through and have wanted to experience the paradoxical situation of drinking something that's intensely spicy and then reaching for the same glass the cleanse that heat from my palate. This does exactly that. There are plenty of flavors here though. If you can make it through the heat you can definitely taste a ""woody"" ale. I'm guessing it's from the Oaked arrogant bastard but there's a charred and peppery green bell pepper flavor that I'm getting too that's mixing in with it nicely from the variety of chilis in this. I can't stop drinking it. Heat isn't everyone's bag, but it's a very different beast to try and enjoy all of the flavors in here while still experiencing (and possibly enjoying depending on your tastes) the burn. With a sweaty brow, nostrils running, and a mouth in burning beverage heaven, I absolutely recommend this to those looking for over the top spicy brews. Damn, I should've bought more!"

"Just plain awful... Overpowering heat and spice takes everything away from the beer. Truly is a crime... Poor showing Stone."

"500 ml caged and corked bottle, bottled October 2013. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy reddish/brown color with some sediment floaties noticeable. There's about an inch tan head that stayed around for a long time, and a good amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like spicy and green peppers, along with some caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of a bit of oak, vanilla and bourbon that kicks in after a while. But this brew is all about the spicy peppers, it's good and hot! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating with moderate carbonation. Overall I liked this. Yeah, I finished the bottle and my eyes are watering right now, but I wouldn't mind trying this again in the future. But it's certainly a brew that I would have to be in a certain mood to drink, because it's hotter than most of the chili beers I've tried before."

"Crime is getting a bad wrap from people who don't understand what this beer is. This beer is mouth punishing with peppers. Hot and spicy, the way Stone wanted it. This beer isn't meant to be consumed by one person eating cookies. It was made for small glasses and shared in good company with a cheese board. It's also fantastic to cook with; just make it a reduction and boil unflavored sausage in it."

"(O)- These is no denying how hot this beer is. It stings the throat and does not apologize. I love spicy hot food, but I think when it comes to having it in my beer, I am a little put off somehow"

""
""
""
""
""

"O: As a chile beer it does pretty well but they could have used a lesser base beer and skipped the barrel aging and dry hopping."
""
""

"O: Call me crazy but this was actually good. I wouldn't want to drink this often, but I actually enjoyed it more than other spicy beers I've had. More depth and complexity than I was expecting."

"right, so remember we are reviewing a chili beer with Crime. given that, i think this brew stacks up nicely in the category. reddish brown in color wih a fading tan head, Crime greets the nose with vanilla, caramel malts, hot peppers, and dark chocolate. after imvibing you feel the heat from the capsician big time. i could see how the. spiciness might be too much for those sensitive to heat, but as a hot sauce enhusiast and master crafter, i can dig it. after the initial pepper blast, you begin to taste the rich caramel and barrel aged blend of the basardt. not a subtle beer, but fun to drink in small quantities. gave me a good sweat, maybe a sligjt endorphin kick."

"Medium bodied, light effervescence. Fairly smooth, too, though drying at the finish."
""
""
"The reviews for this might improve as the bottles are aged. Stone if you read this, ease up on the Jalapenos and try and keep some balance, you are better than this. Oh and make a Triple Bastard so that I can die happy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one wretched beer, drinking wise. I was thinking I'd pour it down the drain, but it might make a decent marinading ingredient, or maybe to go in chili, so I'm sticking it in the fridge. That $20 price tag is a damn steep price for a cooking beer, though."

"Maybe I should reverse my ""not well brewed"" designation, because I think this does exactly what they wanted it to do. But I also think what they wanted it to do isn't what most people would want. Me, personally, I like hot things but I'm not one of those weird scoville devotees, so even though this was tasty it was still hard to get through 16 ounces of it. A+ for creativity and boldness, B- for execution."

"500mL bottle. Pours a murky dark brown color with an inch of head. The aroma is hot pepper and not much else. The taste is pepper and hot peppers with plenty of heat. Coats your throat with heat. I think I can pick up on some Bastard but its hidden behind the wall of spice and heat. Not abusively hot but spicy for sure. Slick mouthfeel with a small amount of carbonation. Overall, I couldn't drink this all the time, or maybe even again, but I'm glad I tried it. It's not as hot or as bad as I thought it'd be. This has been aging for a few months so it may have helped mellow things a bit."

"M: Big medium."
"It's a crime that this beer has made it to production, and was actually bottled.  I applaud Stone for trying to be different, but seriously, who's idea was this?   Fortunately I had this during a sampling at a Whole Foods.  Don't worry about this being sold out, there's plenty to go around."
""
""
""
"Overall - Some of these rating make me lose faith in humanity. It's called Crime, Punishment is called Punishment, expect to be criminally punished, punished like a criminal, etc. I would honestly drink a small pour of this anytime, and would probably buy this somewhat often if not for the price. I am going to have to give Punishment another go sometime, and maybe save some of it for cooking. I like being punished, chiles and these beers."
""
"It is a bit depressing how low the rating for this beer is. What do people expect in such a beer, especially a Chili beer. Crime and Punishment by Stone have captured by far the best, freshest hot pepper flavors of any chili beer I have had. Exemplary for the style, love/hate I suppose but I loved these beers."
""
"O: I love hot stuff but this just brutal. I've had ghost peppers that were tastier than this. Not quite as bad as Punishment for some reason but it's still impossible to drink. A few sips was all I could manage."
""
"O - As a disclaimer, I like spicy food. Let me back up. What I should say is that I like spicy food when everything, including the heat, works harmoniously. When something's insanely hot just to be insanely hot, it just becomes masochistic at that point. With that aside, I've been waiting for a beer like Crime for a long time. Chili beers seem to ride the fence of too little to decent affect or too poorly done to be enjoyable but, Crime manages to up the ante while being a drinkable beer. The time this chili beer has spent in bourbon barrels seems pointless considering the fact almost no attribute shows through but, the ridiculous chili flavor and heat don't completely obliterate the bastard beneath; beer is still a part of this beer. It may not be for everyone, but if you like spicy food, chances are you'll like this beer."
""

"Let's clear one thing up first....this will go over like a turd in a punchbowl if you take it to a party. The aroma has an amazing smell of dirty socks and grandpas asshole. The color looks like I got four scoops of Chipotles extra hot salsa and shit it out the next morning (floaties included). The flavor tastes like my dog ran through a grassy patch and scooted her ass on the carpet and then I licked it up. Overall I think I might go puke because this beer makes me think of Justin Beiber and Miley Cyrus making out (I cant think of anything worse in this world). Please save yourself the trouble and go watch Sharknado 4 times in a row. You will thank me later! In lieu of waterboarding at Guantanamo Bay please send the rest of this crap there. No more terrorism...BAM!"
"Good. Lord. One. Sip. Worst. Beer. Ever."
""
"POST BOTTLE EDIT: so my initial review was only after a few sips, and I can appreciate what they are going for, HOWEVER I found that it was basically unpleasant to actually try to finish the 500ml bottle. The heat builds and is unrelenting, and to be honest the flavour while interesting at first gets a little old. I actually couldn't finish the bottle. This would have been nice to try in a smaller size like 300ml at most, but I find it unfortunate to have paid a high price for a bottle that would have been a chore to finish. Still worth a try in my opinion, but share it with a friend or two"
""
"500 ml bottle. Aroma of peppers and bourbon barrel, Vanilla, fruit. Poured an unattractive green/amber color. Taste-yes, yes tons of heat but what impresses me is the flavor of the Lukcy and the bourbon barrel still shine through. I was expecting this to be horrible due to the reviews I read. Enjoyable nonetheless."
"The heat is intense yet both flavorful and bearable, and more than just heat, you can really taste the chiles as well. I enjoy very hot food, and this is enjoyable to me, while at the same time I can see how it is nowhere near enjoyable for others. I think Stone did a great job here, If you can't take the heat, you never shoulda bought it."

"Overall, the best things about this brew are its nose and its taste. Honestly, as it seems with all the “failed” big-name brews on this site, many people ignore style and go straight for subjective, comparative value of their beers. This is the case here. The spice is wonderful, but you definitely have to be able to appreciate something spicy. It reminds us of Founders Spite series that they aged in wood with peppers. The habanero was the hottest of that series, and this reminds us of that. Crime might be a shade hotter off the bat, but by the end, it can only get so hot and it evens out. It actually smooths out with warmth quite a bit, and after the first half of the glass, allowing for much more of the bourbon and underlying caramel tastiness to shine though and balance things out. The “Bastard” series is a great base for this, affording gentle but sugary sweetness, and cooked warmth. It is so exciting to see such a hot and progressive beer like this bottled and distributed rather widely. If you want our advice, to enjoy this you must take it at face value for what it is, and not expect it to displace your current favorites. Rather, take to it with an open mind, and a love for spicy food, and you just might just find something delightful."

"O - Leaving value for money out of the equation, this beer is off-putting and unworthy of recommendation. Since it is more expensive than a Firestone Walker seasonal release, it is thoroughly wasteful and pointless in every conceivable way. Save your money, your palate and your time."
""
""
"Poured from a cork and cage bottle into a snifter, the beer is a cloudy, auburn-brown coloring with a filmy, low-profile, off-white head. Slick cling left along the glass. Nose of chili heat, with vanilla undertones and woody notes. Not much past the heat, in all honesty. Flavors of heat forward, solid and strong, with a sharp pepper spice throughout. Waves of heat and pepper spice cascade over your palate, mouth, and throat. There are some vanilla and bourbon notes in the backbone, with a boozy highlight, too. Thick, smooth bodied, with a heat and pepper aftertaste. The finish is all heat. Wow. This is rough. I couldn't finish it to drink, but it did make a mean chili the next day!"
""
""
"O- The heat is just way too much. Some nice flavors come through, but after a few sips it is overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
"... which it apparently was at the tap takeover event. A guy sitting two stools away from me left with his four-ounce taster of Crime sitting with just one taste taken. After a while the bartender took it away and smelled it. ""I'll be picking up a lot of these tonight," he mumbled to himself."

"This was an interesting beer. I didn't love it, but I didn't dislike it, either. I greatly appreciate the level of heat that Stone was able to get into this beer without getting the vegetative taste you get with some beers brewed with pepper. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish my glass and was my first and probably only drain pour. It would have been a palate wrecker for the rest of the night, and definitely a stomach wrecker if drunk at the end of the night. I would ave rated it higher if the heat level was tolerable to me, which it was not. Could be good for cooking and making deliciously hot chili. Definitely not for the faint of heart."
""
""
""
""
"Stone Crime ---3/5."
"Overall: Very very hard to finish the bottle on its own, this beer is ridiculously spicy and is leaving me to question why did I buy ""Punishment"" as well. When and if I see this bottle again I will gladly look the other way. It's intense and unless you really like the hardkick spicy pepper, this beer won't be for you. Salud!"
"edit: As others have mentioned, this beer would be greatly improved by Stone turning back the heat on this one; they're taking a great base beer (Lukcy Basartd) and completely obscuring it with a bunch of peppers. I'm fine with a beer tasting of pepper, but it should still taste like a BEER too."
""
""
"I think this beer is absolutely wonderful. The smell is insane - just really fresh chile peppers. The taste is just as good. I have to say I tasted zero barrel or bourbon, but that doesn't matter. The pepper taste is spectacular. Very hot, but not just heat, very fresh and complex. It is like you can taste each individual style of pepper. My favorite beer from Stone."
"Mouthfeel is silky, a little slick (I'm not including the burn as part of mouthfeel). Overall, this is my favorite chile beer. It nearly overpowers beery characteristics with the spiciness, but not quite, and the beery characteristics are interesting and tasty."
"I usually don't waste my time writing out reviews, but seeing as though the reviews for this beer are so polarizing, I figured I'd give an unbiased review to help people out. To begin with if you've never had a chile beer, or are not able to tolerate spicy things (and let's be honest to us in the South this isn't very spicy) then you probably won't like this beer. If I have one major complaint it's the $15 price I paid for this beer. In terms of the beer itself you have to compare apples to apples. Not everybody is going to like chile beer, and this doesn't appear from the outward appearance to be a chile beer, especially since Stone makes it. Some of the lower scores might be attributable to both the high price and deceiving nature of the outward appearances/description. All in all however, this is a solid chile beer; it's one of the better ones out there. That being said, it's still a chili beer nonetheless, and is much like a barley wine in that you can appreciate in limited amounts on a special occasion, but it's not preferable to consume on a regular basis."
""
""
"Way to spicy. It over powers the entire beer. Not good at all."
""

"If you are interested in the taste of spicy pencil shavings, then this is your beer. It's absolutely horrid. Novelty beers are becoming a joke, and this one is the worst of the worst. I wish stone would put more emphasis on producing quality beer than this garbage. I honestly can't believe this beer made it past Stone's QC department and onto store shelves."
"Overall, a very nice hot pepper chili beer. Somewhat one-dimensional and obviously not for those who don't like liquid heat. I think some of the other qualities of this beer (hops, oak, bourbon) are unfortunately masked. I dig that Stone tried pushing the boundaries with this. I would certainly drink again if offered the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
"TOO DAMN Hot. My advice, if you have this let it sit a few years. Actually paired well with some dark chocolate. Stone, you jumped the shark with this one ( and punishment, from what I hear) . Pity, dial the peppers back about 90% & this beer would be great..."
""
""

"As chile beers go, Crime is an excellent example of how it should be done. Deep copper in color, it pours with an ample head and produces lacing akin to its no chile based brethren. At this point, any other similarities to known styles are absent. The aroma is a mix of caramel and Scotch Bonnet peppers. While the pepper taste predominates, there is enough malt backbone to make it palatable. If this were a poorly brewed chile beer all you would get would be pepper bitterness and/or heat. Not the case here. Yes, it is hot, but not throat scorching. The burn is there and may be too much for those who don't like it hot. But for someone who likes spicy food, it's just right. Yes, there is plenty of chile flavor. But you can tell that there's other stuff going on to counterbalance the peppers and heat. The oak cuts the pepper acidity and malt lend a bit of sweetness. There's a nice amount of body and a bit of smokiness on the finish. It would be interesting to see where this beer goes in a few months once the heat subsides. That said, rating this beer is difficult. I tried to compare it to other beers in the same style, which accounts for its higher score compared to other raters."

"O - I can't get through the bottle. I love spicy food, but not a big fan of spicy drinks. The flavors aren't well balanced or very enjoyable and the heat sits in your stomach. Overall this is very gimmicky and I'd much rather be sipping a Ruination."

"I love spicy foods, so I was intrigued to try this one despite the poor ratings. Appearance was fine, but nothing spectacular. The smell got me though. In a bad way. It was like someone left a plastic bowl of caramels in the microwave for too long, and the plastic bowl melted and caramel burned, and then tried to mask it with bourbon and chili peppers. Disgusting. I appreciated the hotness, even though it hurt. But multiple extreme flavors that don't come together cohesively is a bad thing. More burnt caramel and plastic here. The mouthfeel was like someone made sandpaper out of caramel-flavored sugar granules and scraped my tongue with it. Not pleasant. Really a horrid beer. One of two drain pours in my life. Ugh."
"I can respect the creator of this beer for thinking outside of the box and for pushing the boundaries of what beer is. However, I think he went a little too far. I enjoy the taste of peppers in my beer under certain circumstances but only when it is balanced with the malt, hops, etc. I think I would really enjoy this beer if the heat were dialed down about 60-70%. Nonetheless, I am glad I tried it."
"O - 4 - It's good beer, the caramel malt characteristics and hops still come out, but under the overpowering spiciness. I think people that have rated it really low just weren't prepared for a spicy beer."
""
""
"One of the best brews I have had in a while now."
""

"But, excuse me, there is a little smoked gouda awaiting a perfect pairing."
""
"Overall, this is terrible and a definite a ripoff at $17.73 for a 500. If for some reason you like the idea of mixing hot sauce with a little beer, then this is for you, but otherwise this is a beer to avoid. Let's just say this is enough to put me off Stone for a while."
""
"Overall: nice try. Might as well take Bud and give it this treatment. No way to taste the beer anyway."
""
""
""
"It's all about the peppers with this beer. Serious heat, though not as bad as I though it would be. There's a hint of the Lucky Bastard/barrel aging in here but it doesn't stand a chance against the pepper flavor and heat. This is really a novelty beer and doesn't taste very good at all, and this is coming from someone who loves spicy everything. At $20+ it's a huge rip off. I don't care if those peppers came from the god damn garden of Eden, it's worth about $12."
"Pours a light reddish brown color with a decent sized off white head that quickly dissipates to wisps of foam on top. Aromas of earthy spicy hot peppers and little else. The flavor is pure heat, its like drinking lava and it sticks around forever. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a burning spicy mouthfeel. I love spicy food, but this beer is just insanely hot. There is no enjoying this as a beverage, maybe as a marinade."

"Holy shit !!! This is a hot pepper sauce with a little beer added. I love hot pepper sauce. I love beer. I just never expected to have both in the same glass!!! I love it! Hint, you will want to share this one once it's opened. The burn stays with you for a while!"

"This is a unique chile beer. It's not the hottest I've had. I would say that fresh Twisted Pine Ghost Face Killah (which is a good beer) and Cave Creek Chili Beer (which is undrinkable) are definitely hotter. This beer features a reasonable amount of heat, if you are someone that is accustomed to adding hot sauce to everything."
"A solid chile beer. Spicy and then some. It's not so hot it melts your face, but it's not for the faint of heart. The peppers add a nice vegetal depth to the mix. I'll take another."
"A beer that makes no sense in the fact that one or even 3 people can't finish the bottle. It is very hot to the point of making it impossible to finish. In a sample pour it makes sense as the base beer is very well made ( of course) and the peppers are big and powerful. For the style it a great beer as it really pushes the limits of heat and flavour. Worth trying but you need friends."

"O: Its a shame that Stone would make such garbage, its even a bigger shame they'd make it so expensive. This bottle was $18 I think? More than $1 per ounce for a drain pour? Such a waste of money and barrels."
""
""
"O: I liked the beer, but wouldn't return to it - a $20 bottle of pepper spray - as it is, I've got it's counterpart, Punishment, on tap, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but the beer lacks nuance - and it's a shame, too - a bourbon barrel aged beer should have more say in the final flavor than this beer has. If you have any hesitation about heat in beer, avoid this at all costs. If you are a fan of bourbon barrel-aging, skip over this, as you will not be able to appreciate the bourbon at all. But if you want a firebomb beer-drinking experience, or you like extreme beers with high abv, give it a try, but not if your budget doesn't allow for a very pricey purchase."

"Overall: I love the smell, and the creamy body is really nice. This beer is pretty spicy - but not TOO spicy. It does get a little painful - but that comes with the task of enjoying the flavors from hot peppers. I wish I could extract a bit more of the base beer and the barrel aspects, but the peppers dominate the profile. The very beginning of the sip is nice and sweet and must come from the barrel. An interesting beer for sure. If you don't love peppers, you will not enjoy this beer. I recommend pairing this with water and bread."

"was excited and nervous to try this. next time ill get the punishment. this beer looks good- a nice brown, little haze. the smell is hot peppers all the way. reminds me of stron hot sauce- like daves insanity. and the taste is right up there. there is a slow burn that cotes the mouth- and washes over the throat. ultimately this was an interesting experiment- but ultimately i think this beer would be better for cooking- might be great in some chili."

"Absolutely the second worst beer I have ever had (the worst beer is it's companion Punishment). I loved Habanero Sculpin, but this was terrible. There is no balance or complexity to speak of. Disgusting stuff. The price was horrible too for a 16.9 oz. bottle. I will be haunted by the terrible taste of this beer. How could Stone release this beer at this price? God awful."

"I'm very glad I tried this one, but I don't need to revisit it. Even as a lover of peppers and spicy foods, this one still isn't for me."
"I'd most likely have it again if given the chance."
"D: Not drinkable. I had 4oz, and probably only had 1oz. Easily the least drinkable beer I have had."
"D: Hmmm, I didn't think this was as bad as Punishment (perhaps appropriately). I don't know if I would really care to have a full glass of it, but not horrible."
"By far the worst beer I have ever had from Stone. I would never, ever order this beer again."
"Overall: An okay chili pepper beer."
