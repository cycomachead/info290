"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a shaker pint, the beer is an amber-caramel coloring, with a halo of white head. Nose of caramel and crystal sweetness, with only hints of pepper heat, if you dig. Flavors are pepper spice forward, with a subtle caramel backbone, and the jalapeno flavors throughout the end. Light and smooth, with a building heat into the pepper spiced aftertaste. Smooth, clean finish. Solid take on a tough style to keep balanced."

"Had this one on a past ticking trip to Asheville! Served from tap into a Thirsty Monk shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, jalepano, smoke, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, jalepano, subtle smoke, earth hop, and a spicy followthrough. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I was surprised to see this one while at Thirsty Monk as I had never heard of it, but I have always been intrigued by Chile beers. This one had all the usual characteristics of the style including the heat on the followthrough. However, I really wish there would have been a little more sweetness going on rather than just earthy spice. It would have definitely made this one much more enjoyable. Quite glad I got to try this one and would suggest it for anyone who is a fan of the style."

"This is a great chile beer. They added just the right amount of heat to an already solid APA. It's definitely worth trying."

"amber pour, bordering on a light brown with a smooth, even and small head that did its best to not really fade that much at all. aroma is lots of earth grains, light hops and a touch of rye like spice, not much pepper at all in the aroma, this comes much later. as you take a sip it has all the marks of a nicely done esb or amber, but gives you that nice kick of chili pepper in the finish that lets you know its there."
"O: Great spicy ESB - perfect amount of spice."
"Pours deep yellow with a tad of orange. A huge frothy off white head tops the beer and refuses to dissipate. When it does it leaves plenty of lacing in its wake. There is a ton of Jalapeño pepper in the nose. It is super fresh raw Jalapeño and not what one would get from a jar of the peppers swimming in vinegar. First sip is light bodied but crisp like the base beer but make no mistake the Emmy here goes to the super fresh Jalapeño pepper. It hits first, then slightly subsides, and then hits again with a super strong finish that borders on harsh but does not cross the line. It will leave your throat slightly irritated but not to the point of discomfort but rather in a pleasant awakening that lovingly lingers. Very unique, very tasty…a masterpiece!"
