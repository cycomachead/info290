I am a heat lover through and through and have wanted to experience the paradoxical situation of drinking something that's intensely spicy and then reaching for the same glass the cleanse that heat from my palate. This does exactly that. There are plenty of flavors here though. If you can make it through the heat you can definitely taste a ""woody"" ale. I'm guessing it's from the Oaked arrogant bastard but there's a charred and peppery green bell pepper flavor that I'm getting too that's mixing in with it nicely from the variety of chilis in this. I can't stop drinking it. Heat isn't everyone's bag, but it's a very different beast to try and enjoy all of the flavors in here while still experiencing (and possibly enjoying depending on your tastes) the burn. With a sweaty brow, nostrils running, and a mouth in burning beverage heaven, I absolutely recommend this to those looking for over the top spicy brews.

There's about an inch tan head that stayed around for a long time, and a good amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like spicy and green peppers, along with some caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of a bit of oak, vanilla and bourbon that kicks in after a while. But this brew is all about the spicy peppers, it's good and hot! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating with moderate carbonation. Overall I liked this. Yeah, I finished the bottle and my eyes are watering right now, but I wouldn't mind trying this again in the future. But it's certainly a brew that I would have to be in a certain mood to drink, because it's hotter than most of the chili beers I've tried before.","bluejacket74","Aug 02, 2014"

When something's insanely hot just to be insanely hot, it just becomes masochistic at that point. With that aside, I've been waiting for a beer like Crime for a long time. Chili beers seem to ride the fence of too little to decent affect or too poorly done to be enjoyable but, Crime manages to up the ante while being a drinkable beer. The time this chili beer has spent in bourbon barrels seems pointless considering the fact almost no attribute shows through but, the ridiculous chili flavor and heat don't completely obliterate the bastard beneath; beer is still a part of this beer. It may not be for everyone, but if you like spicy food, chances are you'll like this beer.","BeerFMAndy","Mar 01, 2014"

4.24,50.4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4,"Overall, the best things about this brew are its nose and its taste. Honestly, as it seems with all the “failed” big-name brews on this site, many people ignore style and go straight for subjective, comparative value of their beers. This is the case here. The spice is wonderful, but you definitely have to be able to appreciate something spicy. It reminds us of Founders Spite series that they aged in wood with peppers. The habanero was the hottest of that series, and this reminds us of that. Crime might be a shade hotter off the bat, but by the end, it can only get so hot and it evens out. It actually smooths out with warmth quite a bit, and after the first half of the glass, allowing for much more of the bourbon and underlying caramel tastiness to shine though and balance things out. The “Bastard” series is a great base for this, affording gentle but sugary sweetness, and cooked warmth. It is so exciting to see such a hot and progressive beer like this bottled and distributed rather widely. If you want our advice, to enjoy this you must take it at face value for what it is, and not expect it to displace your current favorites. Rather, take to it with an open mind, and a love for spicy food, and you just might just find something delightful.","TheBrewo","Feb 10, 2014"

To begin with if you've never had a chile beer, or are not able to tolerate spicy things (and let's be honest to us in the South this isn't very spicy) then you probably won't like this beer. If I have one major complaint it's the $15 price I paid for this beer. In terms of the beer itself you have to compare apples to apples. Not everybody is going to like chile beer, and this doesn't appear from the outward appearance to be a chile beer, especially since Stone makes it. Some of the lower scores might be attributable to both the high price and deceiving nature of the outward appearances/description. All in all however, this is a solid chile beer; it's one of the better ones out there. That being said, it's still a chili beer nonetheless, and is much like a barley wine in that you can appreciate in limited amounts on a special occasion, but it's not preferable to consume on a regular basis.","OgreSanchez","Jan 04, 2014"

Deep copper in color, it pours with an ample head and produces lacing akin to its no chile based brethren. At this point, any other similarities to known styles are absent. The aroma is a mix of caramel and Scotch Bonnet peppers. While the pepper taste predominates, there is enough malt backbone to make it palatable. If this were a poorly brewed chile beer all you would get would be pepper bitterness and/or heat. Not the case here. Yes, it is hot, but not throat scorching. The burn is there and may be too much for those who don't like it hot. But for someone who likes spicy food, it's just right. Yes, there is plenty of chile flavor. But you can tell that there's other stuff going on to counterbalance the peppers and heat. The oak cuts the pepper acidity and malt lend a bit of sweetness. There's a nice amount of body and a bit of smokiness on the finish. It would be interesting to see where this beer goes in a few months once the heat subsides. That said, rating this beer is difficult. I tried to compare it to other beers in the same style, which accounts for its higher score compared to other raters.","LittleDon","Dec 30, 2013"

In a sample pour it makes sense as the base beer is very well made ( of course) and the peppers are big and powerful. For the style it a great beer as it really pushes the limits of heat and flavour. Worth trying but you need friends.","canucklehead","Dec 10, 2013"

If you have any hesitation about heat in beer, avoid this at all costs. If you are a fan of bourbon barrel-aging, skip over this, as you will not be able to appreciate the bourbon at all. But if you want a firebomb beer-drinking experience, or you like extreme beers with high abv, give it a try, but not if your budget doesn't allow for a very pricey purchase.","Greywulfken","Dec 08, 2013"

It does get a little painful - but that comes with the task of enjoying the flavors from hot peppers. I wish I could extract a bit more of the base beer and the barrel aspects, but the peppers dominate the profile. The very beginning of the sip is nice and sweet and must come from the barrel. An interesting beer for sure. If you don't love peppers, you will not enjoy this beer. I recommend pairing this with water and bread.","Resuin","Dec 03, 2013"
