3.75,-5.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a brown to black coloring, with a light, foamy, cream colored head. Nose of coffee roast, bitter baker's chocolate, and subtle cream. Flavors are heavily roasted coffee, with a subtle cocoa overlay. Dry, light body, with a coffee bitter aftertaste. Dry finish. Very nice.","GarthDanielson","Nov 29, 2014"

3.85,-2.8,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Black with a small surface covering of off-white foam.  Malty aroma that features smooth, well-integrated cinnamon spice and coffee roast…not too aggressive with either.  Flavor follows the same blueprint, a nice blend of chocolaty malt and spices leading into some sweetened coffee and a hint of black malt char right at the finish.  An easy drinking version of the increasingly popular Mexican chocolate themed stout.  Not much, if anything, from the peppers, so spiciness isn’t an issue.  Nice.","wedge","Sep 08, 2014"
