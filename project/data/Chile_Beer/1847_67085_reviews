"Had this one at the source on a past ticking trip to Asheville! Served from tap into a Thirsty Monk shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, jalepano, smoke, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, jalepano, subtle smoke, earth hop, and a spicy followthrough. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I had this one earlier in the day from a tap elsewhere and there was really no difference between the two. So if you find that you might like this one, it doesn't really matter where you get it as it is pretty much the same brew."

"amber pour, bordering on a light brown with a smooth, even and small head that did its best to not really fade that much at all. aroma is lots of earth grains, light hops and a touch of rye like spice, not much pepper at all in the aroma, this comes much later. as you take a sip it has all the marks of a nicely done esb or amber, but gives you that nice kick of chili pepper in the finish that lets you know its there."
"O - excellent use of chili to create a very distinctive beer that goes well with some foods -- certainly worked well with my veggie lasagna. It's an extreme beer in that it far from a standard ale in flavor or aroma, but it is not challenging, assuming one likes the taste of chili peppers, since the heat is under control."
