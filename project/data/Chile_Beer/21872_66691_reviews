"Strawberry Jalapeno Brown Ale, sounds weird right? It tastes so much better than it sounds. It's got a perfect balance of strawberry and jalapeno, and the jalapeno is mostly flavor instead of heat, which compliments the beer very well. It was one of the best beers I've ever had. I got their flight of 8 beers, and I decided it was the one I really wanted some more of the most. I will definitely be back soon."

"M: Very light (since it it 5.5%) Just a wee bit of effervesce. Goes down very easily since it is so tasty."

"Not sure that I would try this one again. The pepper is screaming focus of this beer, and takes away from all other flavors and tones."

"Had a glass at the Trapp Door in Emmaus PA. It might be more accurate to call this a chili beer, since the jalapenos dominate the flavor. Of course, strawberries are also used, but they only add a mild fruit sweetness. I actually have trouble pulling brown malt notes out of this. There's the clean, fresh pepper upfront, then a touch of subtle fruit esters, but no clean toasted or roasted maltsâ€”just a slight caramel hit. An interesting beer, but it could be cleaner."

"I'm glad I tried this one out, it was an interesting beer though nothing I would or could drink regularly. Nice job at taking a risk and twist on the very boring (IMO) Brown Ale."
""
"overall, a nice twist on the style. I can see it being a polarizing beer however. But put me on the positive side."
"Could use a little more hop character, but overall I enjoyed this unique brew."
