"Very unique, I'll just leave it at that."

"O – This beer is awesome. I remember having this last year and I do not remember it being so spicy. I love how it sneaks up on you with the peppers not really being evident in the aroma. It’s definitely a beast of a chile beer – a must-try if you’re a fan of this style."
"O: I enjoyed this one as a chili beer and as a brown ale. The base showed through while providing heat which is definitely the byproduct of the dry-hopping technique used with the peppers. A must try for any chili beer fan."

"O: Overall, I am a huge fan of this, but be warned, its not for the faint of heart. In reading the other reviews on BA, which are all from the old batch, Im inclined to think they've made some significant changes because the pepper notes are huge in this one! If spicy isnt your thing stay away. But if you love hot peppers then this beer is for you!"

"O - Not too bold and outrageous with the pepper but a perfect amount that allows the full profile of the beer to be tasted and enjoyed"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a touch over medium-bodied and good carbonation. Overall a really enjoyable beer, I'd be curious to try it with more peppers (speaking to Jamie at COAST, she informed me that Dave and Mikey want to do a version with a TON more chilies...here's hoping)."

"Served from bottle into a COAST Willi. Poured a dark red-orange with a half finger off-white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, subtle citrus, subtle smoke, and peppers. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, toasted malt, citrus hop, subtle dark chocolate, subtle smokiness, and jalapeño sweetness/spiciness . It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The citrus aspect I picked up on this one was really quite nice and a pleasant surprise. It really mixed well with the rest of the notes in the flavor and aroma. There was a nice backbone for the style present and the peppers were definitely out in force as they brought a nice spicy followthrough. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity."

"Another winner from the brewery that has yet to disappoint me"
