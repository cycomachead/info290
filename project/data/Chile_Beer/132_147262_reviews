"First off, the bottle on this one is a keeper. I don't typically keep my empties, but this one is just too perfect to not keep on display. I didn't really get much on the nose aside from your regular roasty stout aromas, but the taste is where it really comes across well. First off, it's a perfectly solid base stout, probably one of the tastier and more balanced stouts I've had in recent memory, so Rogue totally got that right. When it comes to the spice element, it's not overbearing in the least and it marries nicely with the roastiness of the stout. I was a bit worried before tasting, only because Sriracha definitely has a more unique spice/sweetness profile that I wasn't sure would work like your average chile beer, but this one does it. The heat and spice doesn't overshadow the stout itself and the stout doesn't take away from the heat and spice. It's a perfect balance of flavors in my mind and this is a hot beer that I'd glad go back to again."

"Oh my Lord God! Horrendous! The claim that a human being would enjoy this type of flavor infused with beer is baffling to me. Wow. Heartburn in a bottle. Sickening. And i like spice very much in my food, my wife comes from Thailand so my palate is accustomed to heat. But this, this is an abomination.  It's so gross that if you're reading this, I beg you to try it!! Believe me, its an experience!"
"Thin-bodied stout with slow back of throat burn. Not as spicy as I feared. Split the bottle and barely finished my half."
"you know, i would never drink a whole one of these, i couldnt even finish a glass, but you simply have to respect it. for one, the base stout is exceptional, and an awesome platform for the spice, not overrun with chocolate or coffee notes, and low enough in alcohol for that not to be a distraction. i also admire the authenticity of the hot sauce itself, sriracha is a unique flavor, much more than just heat, and all of that really comes through nicely i think. that said, its way to hot for me, my palate anyway, to be suitable as anything more than an ingredient, hardly an appealing beverage, but i say that about almost all chili beer. the base stout really works for me though, and this might even be good if the heat was scaled back by half or so, because there is a void there that the pepper sauce fills extremely well, but it just gets overwhelming. its cool they continue to experiment, and with all the cult followers of this sauce and its awesome packaging, it should sell well, but for me this is a novelty item, even though the beer it starts with is very well done. worth trying for the heat junkies out there."
"Well worth what I paid for it. I'm going to get a sec ond bottle soon."
"Roasty with huge chocolate and a light lingering burning especially in the finish. I finished a pint of this and enjoyed it, but its not something I could drink often."
"My liver hurts"
"Dammit, how could I not try this stuff?  It pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger or so of tan foam.  The nose comprises roasted malts, mild coffee, and the vaguest possible hint of Sriracha sauce (though this one might be psychosomatic).  The taste brings in more of the same, though after the finish a wave of peppery heat lines my throat.  Not much flavor mixing here, which keeps things from devolving into crazily bad things happening on my tongue.  The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, this could have been a helluva lot worse than it turned out to be.  It's basically a meek, basic stout that happens to hold some pepper heat buried within it.  Nothing godawful, but nothing really worth drinking again, either."
"There is a kick definitely at the end.  It's not a super strong sriracha taste.  It is something you need to try."
"I've had quite a few hot pepper beers that have been incredible and I wish the style was more main stream with readily available options. However this was off the mark. Smell was off putting and lingering aftertaste was horrible. Almost a drain pour. I did enjoy the burn. Rogue beers always seem hit or miss. Disappointed, particularly considering the high price point."

"great beer i was skeptical at first but great taste"
""
"The spicy finish was nice it went well with the stout."
""
"Just spicy enough.  I was worried it might be more than I'd like, but it just hits the back of your throat very slightly.  It spewed a  bit when I popped the top, so be prepared for that (unlike I was).  A few paper towels later, I was good to go."

"I bought a bottle just to try it. After the first sip, you could feel the heat slide down your throat. I'd probably try it again with some spicy food, but the bottle was way too big and pricey."
"O: A good base that gets the spicy sriracha treatment. Pretty much what you'd expect if you put sriracha into a straight-forward stout. Never gets overwhelming or overdone in any way, which makes it pretty easy to drink, especially with a good food pairing that goes well with spice/sriracha. It might be a novelty beer, but it's not bad at all (in fact, pretty good!)"
"Poured into snifter. Pours two fingers dark brown soapy head, great retention, fading into a consistent film and decent sticky lacing. Pitch black. Smells of rich, roasted malt, chocolate and lightly spicy. Starts off tasting a lot like a standard stout, with cocoa, chocolate, and the aftertaste introduces the sriracha. The more I sip it, the more spice I pick up. Great balance, I thought it was going to be a fire-bomb. Creamy, smooth feel, with moderate carbonation and a tickling spiciness lingering on far back of tongue. A little chewy. Nice, quality brew! I bought it thinking it was some sort of joke, but it definitely holds its own. Would buy again."
"Solid stout with strong chili pepper finish."

"Actually a very nice beer. The spice just tickles the back of your throat. This would be great with a pepperoni pizza"

"Drinkability- I thought this was really good. not too spicy but spicy enough. I might buy it again."

"Sriracha Hot Stout pours a black color with a big lacing tan head.  There is a smokey aroma, nice hints of chocolate, and sriracha sauce.  Big chili pepper flavor, big spice note, nice smokey roasted backbone.  Good flavors good body.  Overall, its spicy, full of sriracha flavors, nice chocolate roasted smokey backbone, but a funky finish."
"Starts out chocolaty smooth then the bomb literately goes off and you get blast of hotness, pepper and tingle.  For a 5% Abv, this beer packs a punch!  Looks like a stout, doesn't smell overly hot, taste is different no problems with it.  Just wish this girl had more to her."

"A different kind of spicy from the usual pepper stout. Rogue's Sriracha Stout mixes a good base stout that holds its flavor against the spicy and smoky character of the sauce. It's not cheap, but it is a well executed pepper stout."
"I tried this on a tasting. I liked it,but I wouldn't buy it. It had potential."
"Overall, a decent amount of heat, but not great flavor on a base stout."
"The look is good but the smell and taste and feel are all off. Not a fan, it was nice for the novelty but I wouldn't waste anymore money on this beer."
""
""
"All gimmick and nothing to back it up. A very disappointing beer for the price. I like a spiced and sometimes spicy beer but this missed the mark. After reviewing a few more beers I decided I had originally been too generous with this. Save your money friends."
""
""
"Quite a thin and dry stout, with a decent smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Gentle carbonation. Hard to ignore the mellow heat in the otherwise malty finish. This was another case study in having low expectations and being pleasantly surprised, at least for me. Seems a good policy with anything gimmicky from Rogue."

"Pours a dark brown color with an off white tightly beaded head.  Deep roasted malt aroma, slight cocoa and just a hint of pepper then hints of smoke.  The flavor is roasted and coffee like with a small building heat from the peppers in the finish."

"I think I have sriracha flavored tooth paste, now that I think about it."
"750 ml bottle.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half frothy tan head that stuck around a while.  There's also a lot of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some smokiness and Sriracha/peppers.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the Sriracha/pepper heat is stronger in comparision to the aroma.  With that being said, this brew isn't quite as spicy as I thought it would be but I think it's nice and tasty.  It does have a good kick to it, and it is spicier than most chile beers I've tried.  However, the spiciness isn't overpowering and it doesn't linger around for a real long time.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has a nice amount of carbonation and it's easy enough to drink.  I thought this was a good chile beer.  It has a good amount of spice, but it wasn't too much.  I'd buy this again for sure!"

"Absolutely...  stunning.  Thank you rogue, thank you."
"Sriracha comes through on the nose. P ngers on the pallette with a spice that isn't overwhelming but delivers on the promise."
"Sriracha stout is an awesome combo."
"First off I am not going to do a traditional review as I was unable to experience it accurately with the spice. I truly appreciated how well executed this beer is for what they were going after. It really is if Sriracha and Beer had some weird demonic child. I had no desire to drink more than the 2 ounce sample I tried. I feel it would have been a great stout if it wasn't spicy. Who actually drinks spicy beer? It's just a novelty in my humble opinion, but at least beard beer was drinkable."

"I really enjoyed this beer. More of a chocolate taste than spicy for me. This is balanced enough where I could drink a full bottle of this myself and not be over powered by the spice. I definitely want another bottle of this. If you see it, get it."
"Pours a deep brownish-black with very nice tan head and decent, spotty lacing. Aroma is of coffee and some malt sweetness. Taste is pretty darn good. First is a hit of strong coffee and then fades into a slight chili burn. Actually, not a burn, but it is right to that edge, still tasty, but not overpowering of chili. The balance and complexity seems to be lacking somewhat on this one, but overall, simply put, if you are a coffee and a hot chili fan, this beer is for you. Nice carbonation, just wish it had a little more depth and balance..."
"Better than I thought it would be, heat in the back of the throat. Unfortunately, the base stout is subpar to keep this from actually being really good."

"This spicy golden goose pairs great with gumbo."

"Hard to rate this beer. Sriracha flavor does come through. Very unique. Not great, but not bad either."
""
"Pours and looks fantastic. Sriracha not evident on the nose, but quickly dominates the palate without ever becoming overbearing and undrinkable. Given the low ABV, it's not all that bad, but the price point  ($13) makes it a little excessive unless you're collecting items for a bottleshare."
"Beer pours black, tinged with brown, and forms a large brown head.  Very nice.  Aroma seems mild at first, but upon close inspection there is definitely kind of a caustic thing going on here.  Similarly, the flavor starts out very mild and almost like an ordinary stout, with a subtle jalapeño note in the background.  But the heat grows as it lingers in my mouth.  Finishes by covering my mouth and throat with a bowl of jalapeños.  Not too spicy to handle, but definitely doesn't leave room for beer flavor, and I'll probably be drinking this pretty slowly for the rest of the night.  I don't feel like I can judge the malt fairly, but it seems like a pretty good base on its own: creamy, roasty, even a little nutty.  But then it vanishes behind a wall of chili."

" Although as a person who eats sriracha on just about everything, this is one of the coolest bottles that I now own."

"Weak stout with a bunch of heat. I've had a few of this style before, this is probably the worst."
"An outstanding stout,with a really weird but tasty nonetheless"

"I loved this beer, it's one of my favorites of all time."
""
"This was my first Chile Beer."
"           Overall,I'l give Sriracha Hot Stout - Rogue Ales a Sriracha Hot Stout - Rogue Ales. This would graciously compliment any spicier dish."
"Overall - Even with subdued expectations, I walked away disappointed. This thing really needed to have a sweeter malt base to compliment the heat; instead we get heavy earthy character that pairs oddly with the sriracha flavors. As a sriracha fan, I had to try this, but now with curiosity sated I shant return!"

"3.53/5: The sriracha integration is shockingly impressive; nice work, Rogue"
"Didn't get a lot of chile on the nose.  Loved that this tasted like a normal stout until the chile hit after the swallow."
""
"tastes like a cup of coffee with a dash of hot sauce. not bad but pricey for what you get."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber during a bottle share into a snifter.  Chocolate dark brown with tan head that dissipated.  Smells like chocolate, coffee and a hint of pepper or spice.  Tastes oddly unlike it's name.  Traditional coffee stout on the front but you do get that sriracha hot sauce flavor on the back end and aftertaste.  I certainly couldn't drink more than a glass.  Not bad.  Not great."

"O - This is simply a marketing gimmick.  No sincere thought or effort given here.  I'd rather have a Bud Lite lime-a-rita"
""
"Well, I can't cite faults in advertising with this one, so Rogue is already ahead of the game there with me.  My expectations for hot sauce-enabled foodstuffs are rather stringent, i.e. lots of it, but don't be stupid about it, and I believe that they've more or less got it right here.  Maybe the base stout (Shakespeare?) could be a tad sweeter in its balancing effort, but whatever, it works."
"One of the worst aftertastes I've experienced in a stout."
""
""
""
"Overall: The heat level is spot on. It's not insanely spicy like some, but you can tell it's there, unlike others. However, the taste/smell have a weird smokiness or something else going on that does not mesh with the chilis nor my personal preferences. Not bad, but not great."
"Overall: This is a nice balance between the insane hot pepper beers I've had and ones with no heat at all. Pretty drinkable, and with that sriracha burn - as a hot sauce lover, this one's definitely not bad. (4)"

"wasnt really my style might go good as marinate for a steak"

"Pours dark, smells like chili with a little hint of chocolate. It has a burn on the backside. The bottle is the best part of it. I wouldnt recommend it"
""
"Best hot pepper beer I've had since 3rd Waves chili pepper porter. Doesn't get much better than this IMO."
""
""
"Rogue is hit or miss for me. This one is in the middle. Looks great. Inky black with some lacing. It honesty smells like a pack of Black Cat M80's. Peppery and spicy. Not a knock at all, just takes me to that place. Plenty of malt with a little heat at the end. Flavor and heat lingers on the tongue for a few minutes. Definitely in a pleasant way. Mouthfeel is a little thin and slick. Not a great beer, but good and satisfying."
""
"Nice and dark as I'd expect from a stout.  Has all the Smells you'd expect from a stout.  Roasted malt scent with a hint of spice, maybe a bit of smoke.  Roasted flavors, hint of garlic and smoke, and then a spicy kick at the end. Decent stout feel here.  Man, I was very apprehensive about this going in, and it's weird, but oddly satisfying.  The spice isn't overpowering, nor underwhelming.  Bizarrely good!"
"Slight tingle at the end from the Sriracha, not at all overpowering. Very long finish. Not Rogue's best stout, not by a mile."

"Very weird brew. Lots of pepper/ spice taste (especially garlic, at least to me), with some roasty and chocolate stouts flavors in the background. Not overwhelmingly hot, mostly just a little burn in the finish. Cool idea, but not the best."
