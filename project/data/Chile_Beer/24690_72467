4.08,5.2,3.75,4.5,4,3.75,4,"The beer pours and oranging gold with a little head of medium sized, white bubbles. The head leaves little to no lacing. In body the beer is slightly hazy, though clean and free of particles, and is full of lazy bubbles working their way to the head. On the nose, the beer smells clean and peppery, like the flesh of a jalapeno fresh out of the garden. Light bready malts also appear lightly in the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes spicy and softly sweet with light touches of acidity on the sides of the cheeks. In flavor the beer tastes of fresh jalapeno, spicy and fleshy with light vegetal skin notes that are beautiful on the tongue. Light, cracker malt can also be felt as a cream on the sides of the taste, balancing and cooling the spicy flavors. The finish brings the largest touch of bready malt, but the jalapeno flavors return in the aftertaste and give a nice lingering spice to the mouth alongside a slight plastic flavor. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a light jelling on the tongue. Carbonation is softer, but bites at the beginning of the sip. After the beer leaves the mouth is left wet with spice and acid canceling saliva. Overall this beer is refreshingly unique, with some awesome pepper flavors that would do amazingly with food. The spicy flavor actually dies off as you drink more of it, which is too bad, but overall this is one of, if not my favorite pepper beer with some great, fleshy, pepper flavors. A beer to try for sure.","Maxwell","Aug 26, 2013"

3.77,-2.8,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Enjoyed on tap at the Thirsty Moose. A good drinkable pilsner for me, with turned up heat. A base of malt and wheat mostly, I got very little hops. A nice one and well needed to break through a taste lull.Little colour or head. Average plus mouthfeel.","Sammy","Aug 19, 2012"

3.97,2.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"On tap at the NH Brewers fest. 4 oz served in a small glass poured a deep golden yellow color with a thinnish off white head.The aroma is obviously jalapeno as soon as I set my nose over the glass. There's some sweet bready pilsner malt backing up the pepper, but it has a hard time finding a voice. The flavor is quite mild from what I expected from the aroma. The pepper is there up front but it is all flavor with very little heat. Mild bready and caramel malt sweetness provide a nice backdrop before the pepper flavor throws a mild lingering heat. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. This is a great beer, I went back for seconds, its a really nice pilsner and the jalapenos add an odd, but very flavorful component to the beer.","johnnnniee","Jul 14, 2012"
