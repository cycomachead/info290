"I'm getting the smoked peppers, but little else."
"Tasty stuff! The pour is good - orange colour,two fingers of foamy head, a bit murky. There is a definite smoky chipotle nose - just enough to let you know what you are getting into. The flavour is very pleasant, a solid caramel malt base with just enough smoke and pepper heat. It is far from overpowering and in my books, very well done. I don't drink many beers like this, but I could certainly acquire a taste for them!"
""
""
"This beer was mediochre at best. It was way too earthy and was fairly flavorless, aside from a little bit of chile pepper spiciness. Definitely would not recommend this beer."
""
"Overall: yet again a pretty standard beer from Rogue for AU$14 for a 650mL bottle. Not worth that price, and an average chilli beer. I haven't had a great Rogue beer yet."
"After having a fresh chili pepper porter from 3rd Wave and falling in love, maybe I'm biased. This beer did not live up to the hype for me. Lacking pepper flavor all together."
""
""
"A very nice smoked chipotle flavour.  Not much  heat though. Sweet malty taste is the backbone to this beer. Medium carbonation."
"Super spicy. Was not my cup I tea but taste is subjective. Me personaly I didn't care for it and will not purchase again"
"There is a smokeness from the chipotle peppers with little heat. It is not overpowering."
"Great smoke and flavor from the chipotle, but very little heat which gives a great balance. Pairs well with chili or most spicy dishes. Also great to cook with."

"Yeah, this was light on alcohol but that's not what you're going to notice about this beer should you be fortunate enough to finish this off. My friend couldn't do that with his allotment so I ended up drinking his share as well as what was left in the bottle. While not a drain pour, this is not a beer for most people and should only be tried to satisfy a curiosity. Probably something I wouldn't try again but nevertheless glad that I had once, and one of the few beers that cries out for a meal to go along with it. Clearly not one of Rogue's better offerings."

"Nice head, smells smokey.. Real smokey. Taste is what I expect. Smokey smokey. Not much heat maybe a little on the finish, it was a good tasting beer but I was looking for some heat not so much smoke flavor. Might buy again and pair it with food."
""
""
"Too smoky overall but has a watery finish."

"I really enjoyed this beer although I will admit I was hoping for more heat. Poured into a pint glass I immediately noticed the smoked profile of the peppers. This also played alot into the silky mouthfeel as the beer warmed. This is my first review so please bear with me. Cheers."

"I'm trying to figure out if this version of the beer has changed much, if at all, from prior years because it was a lot better than I remember. The appearance of the poor was a dark amber hue with a light head. The smell was smokey with a little bit of pepper mixed in with the hops and malt smells. The taste and mouthfeel are what I love the most about the beer. The taste is deeply smokey with just a little bit of spice on the back of the throat. It makes the beer an easy pairing with Spanish and Indian food. The mouthfeel as well coats your cheeks so that there's a light tingle from the spice. Overall was very nice and for the price I found it at (7.99) not a bad buy."

"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, bread, chipotle pepper, light smoke, light citrus, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and chipotle pepper notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, chipotle pepper, light smoke, herbal, floral, grass, light citrus, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Slight herbal bitterness/pepper spice on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, chipotle pepper, light smoke, herbal, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt, pepper, and light hop flavors; with minimal pepper heat and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice chile beer! All around good balance and robustness of malt, pepper, and light hop flavors; and very smooth to drink with the minimal heat from the peppers. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Decent pepper beer, certainly drinkable. not overly spicy."

""
""

""

""

"Agreed that it's not the chile beer with the most heat; that's because it tastes like actual chipotle peppers. Smooth and mildly hoppy nose, moderate carbonation, with warming chipotle finish. I would argue that the spicier beers are more of a novelty, whereas this one is more genuinely tasty and drinkable. If you like that kind of thing, of course, it's not for everyone."

"Pretty decent spiced ale, actually better than I expected, pretty good flavor and worth trying."

"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of smoked malt, band-aid, chipotle pepper, and slight fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with smoke, chipotle, and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a smoke and chipotle presence that comes across better in the flavor, but it lacks any sort of heat for a chile beer."
"Overall I really dug this. A bomber is probably enough for the palate, but the overall session was very enjoyable. The right amount of peppers is key and the Rogue crew nailed it here. I'm still getting a little heat and numbing of the gums as I write. Definitely one of my favorite Rogue beers and one I will be hitting up again."

"This is actually a decent spicy beer with the right amount of heat. Won't seek out again, because I'd just rather have something else, but there's a lot of room for error and they avoided all of it, so that's definitely commendable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer, I liked the fact they limited the amount of chipotle added to the recipe, and its hops helps to refresh it. That would be a great beer to mix on a blind taste session. It is the kind that I am glad I tried it but not sure I would seek this again, but I would sure drink it again if it knocks my door."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Something different that's not TOO different. If you were to drink this without knowing what it was you would know that it was with some sort of pepper but it's not too pronounced. Not something to have every day or in large quantities but for a random beer every once in a while it's good."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great flavored beer. I've had a few chili pepper inspired beers in the past and usually they are over the top. This one is right on. You get a nice and very distinct chipotle flavor. That said it doesn't overpower the nice clean underlying ale. This would be a great beer to mix in to a tasting due to its distinctness. I had it paired with some local cheeses and it was fantastic. This isn't an every night beer but a great one to mix it up a bit."
""
""

"Overall it's odd, but pretty good nonetheless. For a chile beer, it's darn tasty."

"I wasn't completely sure what to expect when I had this beer, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I had to take a couple sips of the beer before I could really notice the subtle taste of the peppers, but it adds a nice little kick to the end of your drink. Paired well with a buffalo chicken pizza."
""
""
"O: I've been wanting to try this for a very long time. I'm glad I was finally able to find one. I'm not sure if this is only a ""Spring"" beer anymore since only recently I saw a large amount added to Bow Street Market, Freeport, Maine. I guess its good for its style since it displays the normal smell and taste of ""hot and spicy food"" the mouthfeel I'm unsure of and am making an assumption on that part, but I think I would come back to this. I wonder how this would pair with chocolate cake at dessert?"

"O - Not super impressed by this one. The smoke was nice but the bandaid really killed it for me. Probably won't get this again, and can really recommend it in good conscience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: do not drink this beer with anything that is chipotle spiced. I had a chipotle spiced chicken burrito (homemade) and it completely masked this beer. I'd say try it with something neutral to spice up your meal. And don't worry: there's no noticeable heat in this brew - just yummy goodness."
""
"This isn't a bad beer, bit it comes across more as an ingredient rather than a beer. It has good flavor if you love chipotle peppers, but I'm not sure I would ever want more than this one bomber. I'm glad I tried it once."
""
""
"O: Definitely an odd experience. There are a lot of things going on in this beer, but all very mild and the flavors do not meld well. I really don't like this beer very much. It need a thicker mouthfeel, more sweetness, and flavors that complement each other a bit better."
"Overall- Was underwhelmed all around. Taste of liquid smoke not chipolte at all. I absolutely love spicy peppers and food and this is neither spicy or good at all. Super disappointed!"
""
""
""
""
"FULL DISCLOSURE: Though I wouldn't even call this spicy, I do enjoy really spicy food and the feeling you get from it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – The beer has some good flavors and feel, but is not really something I would ever pine for on any real occasion. Worth a try, but nothing exceptional."
"O-Very interesting take on an ale, but I highly recommend drinking with food with some kind of chipotle seasoning. It complements so well that they should sell it at all Mexican restaurants."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVerall great example of a chile and pepper action in a brew, I will have this again when in the mood."
"Since this is only the second chile beer I've ever had it's hard to judge this one, but I can say for sure that it's a very interesting beer. It's a nice amber colour but the light brown head disappears very quickly and there's almost no carbonation to speak of. The chilies really come through in the smell, along with bready malts and light hops. More of the same in the taste, but this is where the chilies really shine through. Medium body, nice dry finish. Overall, a good beer."
"O- Outstanding! I can't attest to this as a stand alone beer but this is a perfect pairing with chipotle based cuisine."
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass. The color is amber with a large white head. Smell is strong, with a nice chile bite. It's a smooth taste, the chiles are apparent and it's well carbonated. The mouthfeel is average, the spiciness of the drink lingers though which is a nice touch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Sweet toasted malt, spices, subtle smoked peppers. A bit of a dry finish. Sweet malt kept from becoming cloying by just right amount of gently warming spices and smoked peppers. This brew cries out for spicy Mexican or Szechuan cuisine. Overall, great balance, flavor and a match for any spicy dish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very unique beer but it succeeds at what it is attempting. A tasty chili beer that remains balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One o'those 'thumbs-up' brews from Rogue. Give 'er a try. 4.0"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid beer, unique for sure, I could use a little more to dig into taste is somewhat one sided"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like how the chipotle adds to the taste and aroma but doesn't dominate either. Hands down the best chili beer I have had. Just the right amount of heat and chili flavor with nice malt balance."
""
""
""
"DELICIOUS, GRAB A BOTTLE!"
""
"O: A solidly made beer - hard to do with this style - that's easy to drink."
"O: Crazy game that is played on the senses. Flavors that should be coming from food but instead are sipped and a mild heat make this a very unique beer. Not your usual beer style but def worth the price of the bottle and worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A nice spiced brew from Rogue. I enjoyed the smoky character with the easy drinkability. Worth a go for those that like this type of style and are adventurous enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden copper with an eggshell colored, foamy head. Average head retention with some foamy lacing. Lemon zest, chili pepper, and plastic aromas. Orange notes, smokiness, and an unpleasant plastic flavor. Drinks like a Märzen. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft until the finish, which brings a fine sandpaper-like scrubbing. The faintest capsicum burn on the back of the throat. This is not a great beer. Certainly not Rogue's best effort. Lots of optimism in the idea though."
"After chomping on the heavy-hitting Habanero Sculpin and the smooth, but smokey Stoic, this one just falls short of being an excellent beer. Definitely was worth tasting, but am gonna keep looking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I love spicy food. I do not love this spicy beer. There are too extremes, spicy and sweet, battling it out and my tastebuds are losing. I would not recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Different but drinkable, I would not call this beer sessionable but it is also not something I'm sorry that I chose (or disappointed to have). I would likely not get this beer again and I'm not sure there are really any beers in this style that I want for... The alcohol is not very noticeable and the pepper flavor is not overly hot."
"Medium creamy body. Decent carbonation. A bit of spiciness but finishes clean and smooth and is pairing excellently with the mexican dish I am eating. It's different and definitely not something I'd drink every day but it was enjoyable."
"O: Good chile beer. Definitely recommend picking up and pairing with food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber color with a thin creamy white head. Smokey pepper, malty aroma. Initial taste is very unusual and awkward but becomes very good. Warm, full bodied. Spicy finish. Very intriguing beer if you want to explore, but not something you would drink very often."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite Rogue in any way, but it's alright. I've had better spice-heavy beers and even a couple of other chipotle-themed ones. At the price tag this comes with, I wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't call it a bad beer either. I'm sure my review will be lower than the average since there are tons of Rogue fanatics out there, but I just wasn't feeling it too much this time."

"Didn't really know what to expect from this beer. After trying it, I can say I definitely like the style and find it right up my alley. I do like spicy things overall, and having this makes me realize it can work fairly well in beer when done right. Appearance looks like a normal type of amber ale. Not to much head or lacing, looks nondescript. You can definitely smell some of the pepper, and it gives the beer a slightly smokey scent. The smell is interesting. I can't say it's necessarily appetizing, but definitely interesting. Taste wise is where this beer shines. As it warms, the pepper and spice becomes slightly more pronounced, and gives this beer a bit of a bite that I find to be really satisfying. The more you have of it, the better it is. It takes a little getting used to at first. Mouthfeel is a little on the watery side, but the same time the carbonation goes great with the spice, and the heat of it makes it feel quite full. Any fuller body would probably make this feel too heavy. Overall I quite liked this... not a beer I would drink everyday, but certainly good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very interesting mix of peppers and ale, would deff have again."
"Overall, its something to try even if it does not sound appetizing. A chipotle ale does not sound like a delicious beer to drink; or at least it did not sound good to me before I tried it but I am willing to try everything. So, even if a chipotle ale does not sound like a nice delicious ale, give it a try anyway. I enjoyed the new kind of taste that is not normal in most ales."

"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on December 29, 2011. The pour is amber-copper with a short-lasting head that boils down to a ring and a slightly cloudy appearance. For the title, the aroma is actually rather straight forward with a nuice sweet maltiness and a clean hoppiness on the nose. The body is medium. Compared to the aroma the taste is entirely unique with a very spicy bite of pepper that pretty mucn drowns out the malts and hops. Unique for certain but not really something I would have regularly."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not too good."
""
""
""
""

"""ale brewed with chipotle peppers"""
"O - Very different and quite complex. Love the flavours and the whole experience really."
"O- As expected this would pair great with some food. I was expecting a lot hotter beer. But this is really chipotle flavor with only a tint of heat. Well done."
"O - The flavor is a little underwhelming, but otherwise pretty good for the style. Try one if you're in the mood for a spicy beer."
"GRADE: B-"
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler, the beer is a vibrant, slightly hazed copper coloring with no head. The nose is caramel malty in the background, with a pepper spice and smokiness in the forefront. Flavors are heavily ladened with the peppery flavors, both sweet and spicy, and a heavy dose of roasted smokiness. Very well balanced, and a good background of malt sweetness to keep everything held together and smooth. The beer is mid-bodied, and remains on the light side for the flavor profile. The aftertaste is mostly the smokiness, with bits of the pepper vegetable on the palate. Mid-linger finish, again mostly the smoke. Very unique and interesting brew. Great flavors, and not overpowering. Can't wait to have it with some enchiladas, or other Mexican fare."
"O: I like spicy things so I was hoping for a bit more with this beer. But it does let you know it’s a beer that has spices in it. I would drink this again but I won’t go out of my way to."
"Overall: Cool idea, poor delivery. This is a weak, watery excuse for a craft beer. Would not buy again."
"O: The idea of chiles in beer was initially off-putting, but I'm glad I gave this one a chance. It actually is very good."
"Verdict: Certainly an interesting beer that is not for everyone. If you are looking for a unique flavor or to see where beer can go, check this one out. Another really solid sampling from Rogue who never seem to let me down."
"O - I figured coming from Rogue this one would provide a little more flavor...I was disappointed there wasn't much heat, but the smoke flavor was nice...I will try other Chile beers but not this one"
"Edit: After taking my last sips of this beer at room temperature, I did catch a hint of heat. :-)"
"The ratings on Beer Advocate will overwhelmingly tell you that chili peppers and beer are rarely on speaking terms. Rogue's Chipotle Ale, however, isn't too hard to swallow what so ever. It's Tex-Mex meets the North-West and it's a surprisingly decent combination, especially when (or, rather, provided) it is paired with the right foods. Bravo and Salud! to Rogue."
"Overall - I managed to drink the bottle.. but it really isn't my sort of thing. I'll give it points for originality bu I wouldn't buy this beer again.. well maybe for cooking as some other have suggested."
"Overall, then, while I do adore the flavors of chipotles in general, they're overly-represented here, and should have been equal partners, rather than the dominating boss demanding those TPS reports be delivered five minutes ago."
"O: I like this and as mentioned before I agree that this would pair extremely well with barbecued meats, even smoked spicy meat. Definitely would like honey and spicy bbq ribs slow cooked under cedar chips. My mouth is now drooling lol. Definitely a great experience as my first chili/hot pepper beer. Keep up the great work Rogue!"
"Poured a slightly hazed copper with a thin layer of delicate bubbles for a head. Malty aroma, very light, with a touch of smokiness; not much in the way of chipotle in the smell. Toasted malts on the tongue, a bit of smoke, and just a mild sensation of hop bitterness. I didn't really get any chipotle until a few second after swallowing the first swig, but after that, the slight tingle was with my for the rest of the session. Light-medium mouthfeel, and pretty nice to drink if you don't mind a little extra zing in your beer."
"Drink (4/5) A great brew. Very drinkable for spicier beer."
"O- My first spiced ale, I'm definitely impressed. The spice, heat, and smokiness are all done very well and aren't overdone. Overall, this is a highly drinkable, very tasty and interesting beer. This would pair great with barbecue or anything meaty."
"Overall, pretty average. Fine but not exciting. Since the beer is assumedly meant to be focused on the chipotle, I was surprised how mild it is."
"22oz bomber. Pours clear copper with a now you see it now you don't off white head. Smell definitely hints at smoke and peppers. Smell deeper, though, and just a strong caramel dominates. Taste definitely is dominated by smoky peppers but not nearly as intrusively as I imagined. It leaves a lingering slight sting around the mouth & the back of the throat. Very balanced, actually, and it reminds me of the rauchbiers from Bamburg a bit. Grassy, bready. The mouthfeel is thin but tingly. Overall very interesting, very creative. Not my cup of [beer] tea, but very, very well done."
"Interesting. I love chipotle. I love peppers period. I love spicy heat. Do I love this beer? I don't think so, but I am infatuated. I'm drinking this ice cold and the smoky chipotle works nicely. It's a really well balanced beer. Most Rogue beers are really good and this is no exception so it all hinges on the chipotle. I think maybe I could fall for this."
"The heat gets more noticeable as you drink it. It's not overbearing at all. And I got to say that this heat in beer is an interesting concept. It adds that background flavor that just makes it interesting."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall I thought this was a real nice beer. It tastes like a pale ale with some chipotle peppers mixed in. The flavor was nice, I was just hoping for a little more head. I definitely think it is worth a try though. I'd drink it again."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, smokey and spicy. In the taste, smokey and spicy, and some dry yeastiness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry spice and small burn in the aftertaste. Smokey and spicy, great for mexican food."
"best appreciated when drinking slowly with food. need time off between sips on this one. but one damn interesting beer. the bitterness is great the chipotle may take some getting used to."
"Pours copper with a white head. Mild chili aroma with first pour that gets greater as it warms. Medium body, like that of a Golden Ale. Chipotle flavor really comes out as it warms up with a little heat at the back of the throat. Great body and carbonation for a chili beer."
"This beer was pretty enjoyable. I picked up a bottle of this a long time ago and gave it a try. I had no idea at the time on what to expect when drinking this. The color poured out as a really nice amber color with a nice creamy looking head on it. The aroma doesn't really have much of a pepper quality to it. Instead it's got some sweet malts and a touch of hops. The taste is a little on the weak side, the spice is in there but it's very minimal. The mouthfeel is drinkable and pretty smooth. Overall I was hoping the Chipotle was going to be a little stronger. Pretty decent beer though, I enjoyed trying it."
"Nicely done, but a little one-dimensional. Malt. Chipotle. Okay, I guess that's two dimensions."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent body, and a fair foamy head. Nose has a nicely balanced combination of malt, earthtone, and pepper. Flavor follows suit. Pale malt, earthy heartiness, and a nice subtle chile pepper. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Overall, it's like a rauchbier but not nearly as aggressive - sweet and zesty to balance the smoke. Not something I'm racing out to get another bottle of, but not bad either."
"Though I dont have another chile beer to compare this to, I think this is a well crafted and interesting drink."
"Hazy copper/amber colour, light white head and no lace. Smell is smokey, chile pepper, campfire like, bacon and a light malt. Taste is smokey, malt, mild bitterness, nice heat in the finish and aftertaste as well as a light hoppy citrus note. Medium body, medium carbonation, nice overall weight, good feel. This was better than I thought, would be nice with BBQ or chile but worked well on a warm Sunday afternoon."
"I frankly didn't know that Chille Beer was a style (thought it'd be under herbed/spiced) and have never had one before so I'll give it a pass. But, the smell is just too much for me to consider drinking more than the two I bought already."
"Not bad, probably not something I'd have too often, but I agree with a previous reviewer that this might be a great cooking brew. While it mercifully didn't taste like someone dumped pepper juice into a beer tun, the pepper flavor is only mild - I had expected a bit more zing to it. Still, an fine effort."
"Red hued amber in colour. Creamy eggshell coloured foam retains moderately well and leaves a spotty lace. Muted aromas of toast and smoke. Tastes toasty with chipotle smokiness. Slight tang. Mild bitterness. Barely even a tingle of warmth from the peppers. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Feels smooth. I'm quite disappointed they played it safe with the chipotle, there is only a little smoke and almost no spice to be found in this beer. It doesn't taste bad, but it fails to meet expectations. A beer called Chipotle Ale should taste like chipotles."
"Pour was a cloudy orange, good head with plenty of lacing. Nose was spicy and peppers. Taste was pretty smooth, not overly done on the chipotle but enough to dominate the palate. Spicyness in the finish. Medium bodied. Overall a rather impressive chipotle ale and exceeded expectations."
"Pours a nice abmber colour with a thin slightly off-white head. Aroma's fairly weak, some sweet caramel malt and some peppery spice, hinting at the chipotle, and ""grilled meat""? (that's the only way I can describe it. A campfire smokiness comes out later as it warms. The taste is dominated by sweet buttery malt and bbq like smokiness. Not picking up much heat at all except for an underlying peppery spice. Average body and carbonation, nothing to write home about but not disappointing. This has been my first foray into this fringe style, but I was expecting a bit more heat. However, while an entire bomber may be a bit much for one sitting, I may pick up another for cooking purposes."
"O- Not bad but really not that good. Didn't get much heat from the peppers. After drinking half the bottle I was ready to stop drinking it."
"Two fingers of bubbly nitro head. Body is copper. Nothing much by way of aroma, which makes me sad. Seriously, there is nothing discernible here. Flavors are watery and reminiscent of plastic. What follows is heavy biscuit malts. The mouthfeel is flat and thin, and bitter residuals are left behind but nothing with great flavor. What the hell happened here? Where's the smokiness? Where are my chipotle flavors?? This is not what the doctor ordered. I'll be sure to try it again in a bottle and fix up my review if I need to..."
"A very interesting break from the norm. The smokiness that the chile's add to this ale makes it highly worthwhile. Not overpowering in any way, the bite compliments what seems to be an already very drinkable brew. Deep honey coloration, with just a bit of head. It came as part of a flight and the head/lacing may have lessened before it arrived at my table. Smoky smell, with just that subtle hint of jalapeno. Consistent taste. Went extremely well with the BBQ I was having, and was a extremely nice warm up to the RIS that followed."
"I'd buy this one again without a second thought."
"This is better than other chili beers, the fact that they are using roasted Jalapeños rather than raw makes a big difference, the pepper is subtle and does not overwhelm the decent ale that it is layered into. There are only smoky overtones noticed at first, as the temperature of the beer rises the pepper is more noticeable."
"While the look of this beer leaves much to be desired, the mouthfeel is superb. The smell is quite lacking and the flavor, while decent, could definitely use more of a bite. While this is probably not a beer I would be clamoring to purchase again, I can understand why some would seek it out."
"The mouthfeel is great, it's the perfect thickness to let the chilis make themselves known, without being too thick for the fairly easiygoing intro. The only thing I can knock this on is the drinkability. It drinks quite easily at first, but the last eight or so ounces do begin to drag. 12oz bottles would be perfect here. Either way it'd be a one and done though. A surprisingly good and unique ale here I really enjoyed. Give it a try."
"Overall this beer is awesome, I had never tried a chile beer before and I was really satisfied with it. I didn't know what to expect and I was impressed, definitely a great beer to enjoy on cinco de mayo."
"This beer pours a very clear copper in color with a one finger off white head. The smell is of moderate pepper. It's not as much as I'd hoped for. It has light smokiness and has a malt aroma similar to that of malt liquor. Strange. Luckily, the pepper heat becomes more prominent as it warms. The flavor is very smokey. I don't get a lot of pepper but I do get a light spice to it. It reminds me of the Shiner Smokhaus for some reason. It's very malty and there are no hops to be found. It's just malt and spice. Some sweetness arises on the back end of the beer. It drinks light and is drinkable enough. This style is an acquired taste. I'm a fan of the style but this beer isn't special enough to warrant your $6."
"Overall I like this beer as a very drinkable one."
"22oz bottle. Pours a murky amberish brown color with a very small layer of head. Good amount of lacing. Aroma is peppery and smokey. Jalapenos and malts. Smells spicy. Flavor is spicy as well. Tastes peppery but is a bit watery. Smokey flavor along with spicy chiles. Smokey aftertaste. I would love to pair this beer with some Mexican food next time. This beer is a lot like a Rauchbier. Overall, I liked this beer and enjoy this style. Worth buying again."
"pours a nice hazy copper color with a one finger head that quickly disappears and leaves no lacing. the smell is that of malt liquor. at first i picked up the sweetness of the malts, then suddenly i got a little smokey flavor with very little pepper. sadly it disappears as fast as it shows up. mouthfeel was clean and crisp up front, then turns slightly creamy with a dry finish. overall i wish this beer had more heat to it, luckily it was well matched with bbq chicken. i will definatly try this in the future."
"Overall, very interesting take on a smokey brew. Super drinkable but beware! I had immense heart burn after ingesting this brew! Ouch, not worth it really."
"Had this on tap at The Thirsty Monk. Poured a copper color with an off white head. Nose is very peppery with some malt and promises the chipotle that is expected. Small amount of malt in the taste with a well balanced chipotle flavor... not too much, not too little. If you like what's promised by this beer, it delivers nicely. Still, not the most interesting of brews."
"In comparison to the only other Chile beer I've had, Theobroma, this misses a lot of points. The peppers are done correctly, not overbearing but present, although other than that, there is nothing else going on with this beer. Will NOT seek out again but worth trying for the curiosity of it."
"O - Its a pretty good chile beer. Could use a little more chipotle flavour. This is probably a good introduction beer to this style?"
"D/N - Delicious bbq in a bottle. Wonderful brew and highly drinkable if you love natural and light pepper flavor. I wish this was distributed to my area."
"I like off-centered beers and enjoyed this one."
"D/O: Pretty enjoyable beer. The smokiness and pepper make it worthwhile."
"D/O: Easily drinkable and not overbearingly spicy, a great example of a smoky chile beer"
"Highly carbonated yet smooth."
"Clear orange with a small circle of white head, smells kind of bready and sweet and then a spicy peppery note hits, tastes sweet like a bready amber ale, a light smokiness is present and some pepper flavor comes through as well, not too hot but it is certainly present, mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Decently drinkable, I could see someone really liking this one if they were a fan of chipotle. I would drink this again if I was in the mood. I see real potential for this beer in a recipe of some sort. A nice sweetness is present and the pepper could definitely add some spice. I might pick this one up to make chili with."
"Decent beer, but I probably wouldn't buy again."
"D: Very well-made, but far too idiosyncratic to be particularly drinkable. Deliciously spicy. If you don't like chipotle peppers, stay away. If you do, get some!"
"Pours a reddish medium brown with light-tan head about 2 fingers tall. You can smell that smoked and chipotle aromas, and you can certainly taste them, too. I love the smoke flavor this beer has. It really tastes like the smoked chipotle ground spice I have in the cabinet... and in a very good way! It would certainly make a great stout, too."
"overall done very nice as the chili is reserved for the finish where it should be, overall an excellent beer i have to say."
"The beers pours a golden orange color with a thick frothy head.It smells malty and piny. It tastes like a good beer with the malts coming through and subtle hops. The chipotles hit you at the end of the beer after you swallow. I slight spice builds into a nice heat with every gulp. This beer is a must if you want to try something new and different. I really enjoyed it."
"M - Lighter bodied beer with medium carbonation."
"Overall great beer and a different taste. This beer exceeded what I thought a chipotle beer would be like."
"D: drinkable, but definitely not a session beer. a nicer opener to stronger beers or as many others have said, with a meal. probably wouldn't buy it again, but i did enjoy it."
"drinkability; I definitely feel like drinking more and this is pretty good as the spice keeps in line."
"Drinks easy. A nice use of hot pepper. Really profiles it nicely and is a solid beer. Glad to have tried it."
"D: Very drinkable, provided that you have food. It would go very well with a meal, but to drink a whole 22oz bottle in one sitting by yourself would be a little bit rough. All in all, quite good."
"This here is a good sessionable brew, would purchase again."
"Finish has smoke, which seems to pervade the beer from start to finish. Just not my thing."
"O - The flavors are somewhat disconnected, in that you taste them in fairly distinct, separate tiers. Overall though it's a well balanced beer with a fun kick that's worth seeking out."
"Overall: Drinkablity takes a hit as the beer warms. Better served ice cold."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a two to three finger head which gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt and chipotle along with some spiciness. The taste is much of the same, the taste starts out new with a caramel malt backbone and in the middle the chipotle taste and heat hit you, its odd a first but it is pretty pleasurable. Spices round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, and seems to be lacking a little kick. Overall its a drinkable beer, but it is more of a novelty. It's an easy drink that is a little flat, but the uniqueness won't keep you drinking it."
"D - I personally love the spiciness. Quite savory as it goes down."
"This is by no means a bash to rogue brewing, because they put out some stuff i truly enjoy (i.e. santas private reserve, dead guy, and xs) Would refrain from ever wasting your money on this. The bottle is cool, but the beer is an atrocity."
"D - Very good and drinkable. I love the spiceiness and smell. This is probably the only beer with a fruit added that I really liked."
"D - My first experience with the chipotle ale, and it was one to remember. The flavours are very unique, and I was surprised how much it reminded me of a rye beer. The peppers definitely add a unique kick, and I would highly recommend that everyone takes this one for a ride."
"D: Great beer, low enough abv that you can have several. Great companion to a gourmet southwestern meal and desert."
"Drinkability: I've got a soft spot for chile beers, but I'm a big chipotle fan. This was okay, but I would have liked more spiciness. Other than that, solid."
"O: My first chile beer, and possibly my last."
"Beer is medium bodied with a late smoke flavor. The chili flavor is matched well against the malt profile. Its pretty good. Its not overly smoky, not overly spiced. This is probably my favorite ACTUAL chile beer. Its not the best beer I've had, by a long shot, but its worth a look, for sure."
"D: A good representation of the style. I believe this would make a nice pairing with fajitas and guacamole, or other foods of that ilk."
"D: Very interesting beer. Not something I would drink every day, but better than I expected especially seeing as how this beer could be pretty hit or miss. It's a hit in my book and should be tried if you're a fan of spicy foods."
"Not my favorite beer by Rogue but I have to say one of the most creative beers I have ever had. When they say Chipotle they mean it. I am not sure if I should drink this beer or use it as a seasoning. It is very unique, very spicy, tastes like a Chipotle salsa, but it goes down very smoothly and is not over done. I can see how this could have gone wrong is so many ways but, hats off to Rogue, I think they nailed what they were going for. Not sure I would eat with spicy food might be over kill."
"Tasted from 22oz bottle purchased at Lush West Town. Pours light amber orange with a thin white head that doesn't really leave any lace. The nose is smoky and reminds me more of dried chipotle rather than fresh smoked peppers. There really isn't much else going on, as the smokiness takes over. The palate is a little more exciting, starting off with a hint of sweetness and hops, and then moving to the smoky and spicy chipotle. The body is medium with average carbonation and a long smoky and spicy finish."
"Chipotle Ale was maybe the third or fourth beer I've had from Rogue's regular line-up. I'm not sure if it was this beer, or Brown Nectar, that sold me on Rogue as a top notch brewery, but either way, this is a beer to try, especially if you're one of the many who have never had a chile beer before. Chipotle Ale is just that, it's a slightly malty beer with a smokey taste and a chipotle pepper kick to the finish. Not hot, in the food sense, but there is a notable kick after swallowing this beer that provides for a very fresh and less than common experience. Chipotle Ale is not as complex and subtle as the chile beers I've tried since, best served by itself, and an excellent choice for a first time chile-beer consumer."
"D-the taste stays pretty well. The main problem is that you better have some pulled pork near by or else you're gonna be tortured throughout this beer. i generally like a higher ABV, but considering the bottle size, i'm glad this beer wasn't too much stronger."
"Not so much. If you're accustomed to drinking something to numb the burn of hot pepper, this beer will throw you for a loop. Pair it with some food that's not very spicy to balance things out."
"Drinkable is not a word I'd use with this beer. If you like spiciness, get a burrito or snack on a jalapeno. I don't get why it should taste good in a beer. That said, Rogue seems to have done a good job on this one. If I were inclined to have another spicy beer, I'd have this one again."
"The smokey spice of the chipotle hits in the back of the mouth, with a slight lingering cinnamon fire candy sweetness up front. This is real big on flavor, but all the flavor doesn't quite meld as well as it could. A very interesting beer to try and worth the experience, but not one I'm going back for."
"Overall, this is one of the best chili beers I've had. It's pretty moderate in heat, but I really like the flavors of the chipotle and smokiness. It's still pretty one-sided in that it's all about the pepper."
"I love peppers. I love beer. So why not try them together? My experience with spiced or pepper beers has largely been limited to the famous - or infamous - Cave Creek Chili Beer. I've always had a soft spot for that beer, though it's admittedly gross now that I've moved on to bigger and badder beers. Pours a red bordering on copper. Nice balooning head with some pretty impressive amount of lacing. Moderate carbonation levels. Aroma is all smokey chipotle pepper and not much else. If you're not a fan of the chipotle favor it'll be pretty overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, with low carbonation. Flavor is smoked chili powder mixed into a red ale. Medium caramel sweetness in the finish with some temperate pepper. This beer would go great with barbecue, like burnt ends or spare ribs. Standing alone it's merely an interesting execution on the pepper beer style, heads and shoulders above Cave Creek but lacking something. Pair something with it - I pulled out some local smoked pepper jack cheese - and it really shines."
"I poured this beer from a 22oz. bottle. It had a 2 finger foamy fizzy head on top of a nice brown amber color body. The aroma is very nice of chili peppers and carmel notes. The taste is nice and smokey, nice malty taste on the back of the tongue. This beer has a nice mouth feel and is very drinkable."
"D - i love beer and chipotle, and this combination is fantastic, the flavours are exactly what I want, the feel is a great balance of smooth richness and tingly heat, very drinkable although the heat may really start to build after a few, overall a fantastic idea with a better result"
"D: overall the beer drank very well and was not at all overwhelming on the spice like other chile beers I've had in the past where it burns going down the hatch. I think I have to pick up more fresh bottles cause it seems like the spice dies through time IMO."
"Drinkablity is good. It goes down easy and is pretty refreshing. And interesting and novel beer for sure. I wouldn't mind having it again. If you like a bit of spiciness, this is certainly worth a try!"
"Drinkability really depends on whether you liked the smokiness in your beer or not. I thought I did as I love chipotle flavor, but for some reasons, I was not much of fan."
"Cloudy reddish gold brew gives a thick tan head that leaves a thick carpet of lace on the glass. The nose is really interesting- fairly typical thick semi-sweet bready malts, but then an unmistakable spicy red pepper bite. The taste is very much the same though adds a bit of smokiness, presumably also from the chipotle. Mouthfeel is moderately thick with appropriate carbonation. The spice is felt mildly starting with the first sip but really develops and lingers long into the finish, a pleasant warming burn. Very interesting, not something I'd drink regularly, but I'm glad I tried it and would have it again on occasion."
"nice. a cold bottle of heat. recommended!"
"D - A really fun brew to try and worth picking up, even if it's only once. I'd definitely drink it again though, especially with mild-to-moderately spicy food or a steak-y fish (tuna, sword, etc.)"
"Rouge's Chipotle Ale poured a hazy amber color, with a good size head that went away rather quickly. It had a smell of cooked peppers, and I found it just offensive. The taste was heavy, full, and had a spicey note to it. It was rather easy to drink. Overall a very interesting beer, and a very good beer, gets better the more you drink it; a must try."
"D- The first taste through me off, I was not expecting a refreshing taste and was hoping for something more spicy. Although this was mild, by the time I finished this bomber my tongue had just a bit of burning. Over all I hope to buy this beer again soon."
"This beer is quite interesting. Pours deep golden color with a nice white head and great lacing. Smells of fresh fruit, light malt, and spiciness. Tastes of cooked fruit, slightly roasted malt, and roasted peppers. the spiciness isn't overbearing, but does increase the more you drink. leaves a nice warm feeling in your mouth and throat. quite an experience!"
"D- This is one to be paired with food and kept in moderation. Do enjoy it though."
"Arrives a deep copper color with minimal head. Aroma is very malty with a hint of smokiness... first sip is Wow. What a nice unexpected smokiness to this brew. Very much like a rauchbier. A very pleasant suprise. There is no pepper hotness to this at all like I was expecting. I would certainly get this interesting brew again."
"Drinkability: decent beer, could have used more heat. Ot's a chili beer!"
"Looks like a pale ale, smells like a pale ale, and but for the slightest hint of chile, tastes like one too. It's a good beer, but not at all what I was hoping for."
"Drinkability - Given the style, I'll pass on it. While I enjoyed it, it's not what I would have expected from a beer whose style is focused on the chile. 2.0/5.0"
"Notes: I was expecting more. This is super spicy, so much so that it is making my acid reflux act up. I would like it more if the spiciness could be minimized a bit, but I guess that's why it is called Chipotle Ale. Split a bomber and not looking for any more. Ever actually. This was nice thing to sample, but I'm not gonna go back for more."
"M/D - Middle of the road mouthfeel, I was able to finish my half of the bomber no problem but my tasting partner didn't do much damage and I've never seen him not finish a beer before."
"D: I enjoyed it for what it is. My boyfriend loved it. I'll go back to my IPAs and let him have the spice. :)"
"D - Not for me. Fun to try, but for me, probably better to use for cooking."
"average to below average."
"A tasty beer but somehow something is still missing. I actually think that the Pacman yeast is doing something here that I don't like too much. Still, one of the better chilli beers I've had."
"[Drinkability]: Average. I wouldn't drink this beer all the time, but I'm sure it goes great with authentic Mexican food."
"This was good but I wasn't wow'ed. Pours an amber color with a small off white head. The aromas on the nose were very faint although you do pick up slight notes of hops, smoke and peppers. The chipolte comes through subtely just adding a littel smokiness that is balanced with hops and malts. Overall good but not great"
"Great brew for the spring. Goes very well will salsa or any mexican dish for that matter. Complex flavoring, tends to get bolder the warmer it is as expected. Not alot of head, about 1/4 an inch depending on your pour. I would recomend this beer to everyone, a great treat!"
"D: Nothing really stood about this beer, although I might try it again just because this is a unique style. I think this beer would work better paired with food than drinking it by itself."
"D - Pretty interesting brew that incorporates earthy, herbal hops with a spicy, peppery flair. This would pair quite well with Mexican food. The oily, peppery character really retained its spiciness, considering the age of this bottle (purchased November 2008)."
"A gimmick I suppose, but actually quite delicious. A nice ale taste underneath, just the right amount of bitterness, and the chili taste is in fact, really, really good, and goes well with the beer. There is a nice bite from the pepper, but nothing excessive."
"Drinkability: While I'm enjoying this beer and one sip leads easily to another it is really pretty much a one a night beer because of the lingering heat in the after taste. While I like my chili with lots of chiles there are also other flavors to break up the heat. This beer fills a nice niche but is more for pairing with food than for an evening's drinking."
"notes: Rouge, taking the brewing to another limit and the result is this bright, and tasty chipotle beer. Really good, perhaps the best pepper beer I have had in a long time."
"taste is of chipolte, corn, malt, and a touch of caramel, end has a strange aftertaste to it."
" Well with all that being said, I'm glad I picked this one up. And, also glad I have another one in the fridge. I almost feel like attempting this as a homebrew to give as gifts. Thanks Rogue! Well played!"
"D: In comparison to other unusual or oddly spiced/herbal brews (Fraoch heather, to name one) this is slightly easier to drink because the main flavor component is not overwhelming and doesn't manhandle the palate, so to speak. Not a session brew; more like a beer to drink with a mild mexican dish or any other mildly spiced food. Not exactly something you'd reach for if you were eating hot wings or something. Although the flavors would probably meld pretty well, could leave some gasping for air (and/or water)."
"D - Underachieving, but interesting. If the flavor were kicked up a notch or two, I'd be way more into it."
"D- Enjoyable for one or two at a BBQ or something, would not recommend more than that, simply not interesting enough."
"D- I'd say this is very drinkable. I'd imagine it would go awesome with some Mexican food. I'm drinking it solo though, and I'm enjoying it a good bit. The beer doesn't beat you over the head with the heat, and your mouth won't catch on fire."
"This is an interesting beer that I don't think would be well suited to session drinking. I look forward to experimenting with various food pairings, but sitting down at the pub and having three or four in a row doesn't really sound ideal."
"D: Goes down pretty easily, but the lacking aftertaste slows it down."
"d- the drinkability here isn't great. i was sooo looking forward to trying this, i went out of my way to pick up a bottle and saved it for a special pairing with my homemade chili (which has beer and chipotle peppers in it). this should have been a wonderful pairing but unfortunately i ended up drainpouring this bad boy."
"D: Normally, I'm not a huge fan of this style, but Rogue has found a way to make a chile beer that's actually quite good. It's definitely more of a food beer, as it would accompany ribs nicely."
"Final Thoughts: I would want a stronger attack on the nose, some heat, and a more fuller mouthfeel."
"Very drinkable, though only perhaps under the right circumstances. I once had this beer after a nice, spicey dish of chicken with a chipotle sauce. I thought this would be a perfect pairing, however--after the meal, the spicey aspect of this beer was almost completely unnoticeable, rendering it quite bland and thus driving the drinkability way down. When consumed before a meal and/or on a clean palate, however, this beer is quite vibrant and very drinkable. And so, two hours after a very unspicey meal, this one did not disappoint at all."
"D: I cracked it open with a grilled pork chop and let me say I had a dance in my mouth this one was incredible with my food. It is a five all the way. but I had a hard time finishing this one on its own after my food was gone and since this is a beer rating it is going to be lower. my advice is enjoy this with a meal, it's awesome"
"Overall not a beer I will grab again. I have wanted to try it for awhile now and I'm glad I did, but beyond that it does not inspire me. Let me also say I'm a huge pepper and hot spicy stuff fan and this beer didn't really live up the the chili side of things."
"Since this beer is spicier than it is smokey, it would pair well with mexican or spicier foods. The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with spicey red chile edge. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that boasts of crystal and roasted malts along with a very spicey chipotle pepper taste. I love these kind of beers. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. Rogue seems to be able to get it done no matter what style it is."
"D - I may have to track this down again and do the ""drink with Mexican food"" advice. It kind of ruins the night for drinking since the burn kind of sticks with you for at least and hour or two so in a way it is ""spicy"""
"This is a unique brew. I enjoyed the the smoky, spicy finish. It provided a unique balance to the sweetish malt up front."
"Overall, this is a very unique beer. It is very hot and I think it could go well with a taco. I am glad I am splitting this 3 ways, as it is hard to drink."
"Drinkability: I like this beer well enough to finish it; and, while I appreciate the craft that went into it, I don't know that I'll be getting it again. Perhaps it would go well with a meal. This is simply one difficult beer for me to rate."
"Not too drinkable, worth trying though."
"Drinkability: Great for the spice kick and smokiness, a definite winner with certain cuisines and just for a spice fix. It just needs a more assertive malt profile and a fuller body to be a true winner."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of pepper and slight yeast. Fits the style of a chili Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. An obvious heat is present. Tastes of pepper, yeast, and slight pale malt. Overall, the chili domniates and the flavor is good at first, but the heat builds and makes it hard to drink."
"D- An interesting brew to say the least...for the style, definitely one of the better ones I've had, yet it seems to be missing something (maybe more heat, maybe heavier mouthfeel...just something more) Nonetheless, this is a unique brew that is worth a shot"
"Theobroma being my only reference for chili beers, this is much better."
"M/D: Carbonation is pretty low, and mouthfeel is fairly light. I liked the taste at first, but by the end, the smokiness wore out its welcome and I was ready to switch. I think this beer has a lot of potential when paired well with food, but it's a bit much on its own."
"Rusty amber in color. Smells like an average beer. Very smooth; subtle hints of pepper. Not very hot, but you can taste the spice. Was hoping for something a little more spicey but this is definitely an above average beer. Would love to eat a burrito with this one."
"One last thing; do NOT drink this beer if you have chapped lips, cold sores, or any raw spots in your mouth. That's when the peppers will get you!"
"D: Not my kind of beer...many like this beer, but for me, not one I enjoy."
"Overall an interesting ale. The light smokiness was pleasantly surprising."
"Interesting effort. ""Extreme"" beer though? I tend to define ""extreme"" as something innovative AND delicious, so I would say Rogue is a bit off of the mark here."
"Poured in to a weisse glass. Nice amber color with a good head and OK lacing. Not sure where to start the taste end of this review. This was a well made ale but I got only minor tingling on my tongue from drinking it. I really wanted to feel the fire of the Chipotle but for me there was none. However the friend I split this with could barely finish his share due to the heat. So I am at a lost how I feel about this brew. It was well made."
"Its not perfect but a bit above average B. It is lacking in mouthfeel but just a bit, the peppers are too dominant."
"D - so unique. taxing on its own, but went great with my dinner of keilbasa casserole."
"An interesting blend of chili flavour, Scotch-like peat, and well balanced amber ale. Not a particularly sessionable offering, to be truthful, what with there being all that oft-mentioned smoke, rather than spice, from the guest ingredient."
"D: I don't think I could drink very much of this, as it just doesn't come across as something I'd want to drink more than a bomber of. Really would be an excellent beer to pair with food though. Excellent work Rogue. A beer that I can't believe I've passed by a million times. Compared to most other chile beers, this is fantastic, as most of them end up tasting like crackers with tabasco sauce on them."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Not too great for this one. To be fair, I was a little tired of the spicy taste already, but I don't think it would be easy to drink regardless. It's not a bad beer--in fact, it's a pretty interesting one--but it's more of a novelty than anything I think I'd actively seek out again. I just feel like something's missing..."
"Drinkability: A beer that I would be able to drink again, however I would not actively seek it out at a bar or beer store."
"D Only fair for me. The odd flatness and rauchbier qualities do not jive well with the pepper aftertaste. I will finish the 22 ounces but will most likely not seek this one out again. 3.0"
"I wasn't expecting to make this beer something I'd drink on the regular, but I was hoping for maybe a fun/gimmick type of brew that would be fun to buy every once and awhile to pair with appropriate cuisines. I think the smokey flavors don't really blend well with the malt and hops of an ale, and are better suited for a porter or stout. Definitely not a bad beer, I drank it all and enjoyed it for the most part, but not something I'd go out of my way to drink again."
"Upon trying this I am no longer quite so intrigued. Reminds me of the time I added chipotle and habanero to some vodka, interesting idea but not much I could drink it with. It tastes like a thin beer without much carbonation that is smoky. Clearly there are chipotles in the beer, but the beer offers nothing beyond it. Maybe I am wrong in reviewing it in comparison by other beers, but I find it to be having no great beeryness to it... I don't read reviews first, and had decided on what I would do and then saw the Bros highly reviewed it, that will be my next stop to see why they liked this (to me) highly mediocre beer."
"D: I wish there was a bit more to this brew. While the chipotle was nice, it demanded something more. Something to complement it. Most of the flavor was smoke, but not to the same caliber as their Smoke Ale. otherwise, this is a deliciously unique brew."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer. If you're looking for something interesting to pair with tacos (I did) or Mexican food, this might be the beer for it. Not necessarily something I will go to in the future, but worth a try."
"I'm drinking this with Taco Bell right now, and they go great together!"
"It kind of reminded me of Fat Tire with Chipotle flavor added, but I recommend this to anyone willing to try anything new, especially if they like Southwestern cuisine. I may pair this with some Mexican food very soon to get another perspective on it."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, a new favorite of mine, It is the best chile beer I have had"
"Overall, the peppers hit a completely different region of the senses than the beer itself, which is unfortunate, as i wanted them to blend more amicably, the way coffee flavors sneak into a beer. This, and the overly cloying sweet taste of the beer are its only faults."
"D - nice integration of peppers here. There are no off-putting flavors or funkiness."
"Certainly the best chile beer I've yet tried."
"I kind of wanted Rogue to blow the chile beer out of the water with this, but it just seems kind of savoury without being particularly pungent, spicy or full of character. Ultimately seems a bit tame, and a sort of muddle between chilli and smoked beer flavours. Not undrinkable but a bit blah."
"An interesting beer for sure. It looks good with a bright copper body topped with a rocky, soft head. The nose is somewhat promising with a bit of honey, sweet caramel and light hotness hinting at the peppers. However on the palate it tastes a lttle bit like a prank beer. The kind of vibe where you think this probably would have been pretty good if it didn't have the chilli. Especially by the end of a 650ml bottle I was well over it. It's a well made beer with decent balance, weight carbonation and bitterness some cool smokiness and I guess it's appropriate to the ""style"" of chilli beer, but I don't really care if I never drink it again."
"D - This beer was a lot better than I thought it would be, which goes to show you don't be shy about trying new things, but being in NO we love our spices, so should have figured that a Chile Ale from Rogues would be good"
"Drinkability: You can't chug this stuff at all, just enjoy this slowly and enjoy the complexity of flavor."
"Hard to imagine a more drinkable chile beer, though it would be best with left-over baked turkey or chicken, and probably not something you'd want every day."
"D) Good. I enjoyed this with tacos and it went well together. Not sure if this is my favorite style but I enjoyed this brew and would recommend it."
"- What a fantastic ale from Rogue.. one of my new favorites from them and one I hope they continue to brew. It goes down well and is very unique and great for even those that dont like spicy stuff."
"Drink: Smooth, light, and interesting flavors.. maybe too interesting. A pint or so will do."
"Overall, a good beer and a great introduction to the style. Balanced and not overpowering. Recommended for anyone slighty adventuresome."
"this isnt an ale u can throw back a few pints of, but it isn't quite a total sipper either. that is kinda what i expected and hoped for in a beer has spice. just like food, i don't want somethign i need to recover from with water and time to have another bite, but i want it to have some substantial heat."
"I must admit i always get a little scared about chile beers i mean they can either get it just right or sometimes go overboard with the chile taste which for me ruins it i just like that nice balance and this beer is a perfect example,it pours a deep golden amber colour with decent carbonation which leaves a nice two finger head that slowly dissapates to a peaky cap in the middle with lacing all down the sides,the first aroma i pick up is smoked chipotles with a malty,fruity aroma lying in the background its definately got me interested,it has an above average mouthfeel with the fruity,malt tastes hitting the palette first which is finished off with a subtle ting of smokey heat but not overdone at all this is definately one of the better examples of this style that ive tried but hey its Rogue that so doesnt suprise me."
"If you like BBQ and spicy food then you are going to like this beer. If you don't then this will not be one for you. I'm hanging on to a couple of bottles to do some cooking with, this would be great in chili or as a base for a marinade. Pick up a bottle or two for this reason if no other one."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. The ale appears a hazed rich amber color with about two fingers of fluffy light rust colored foam. Flavors and aromas consist of smokey, spicy chipotle peppers, a nice caramel sweetness follows, a bit fruity, floral hops, the smokiness is subtle. The ale is a notch or two better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. A tasty ale for sure."
"Future outlook: A real surprise winner in my book. Definitely a beer that I will buy again for the specific purpose of food pairings. Paired very well with a pepper-jack burger, and I'd love to try with other spicy foods."
"this is a great beer for what it is, but I would have a real tough time putting back a number of them."
"-i wouldnt really order this beer unless for some reason it was the only micro around at a bar"
"nonetheless, an interesting novelty."
"D. Very good for the style, but it would be difficult to drink more than a glass or two."
"The taste reminds me of a rachbier with a much spicier character. I like it better than a traditional Bamberg style rauchbier with a very spicy aftertaste. I kind of like it and I think it would be fantastic in the right situation."
"M/D - The mouthfeel is quite good, but I think that this is something my palate could only take one of"
"D-Okay. I don't know why this one bummed me out so much. I didn't really feel any heat from this. I also expected alot more smoke flavor and scent."
"Although I enjoyed this beer, it definitely could have used more heat and flavor from the chilies. Nevertheless, this would make a perfect accompaniment to some nachos and spicy salsa."
"More of desserts drink than a BBQ-beer. Mellow and rounded flavours with chilli in the background. Almost like a light barley wine."
"22oz bottle purchased at McKinnon's. Pours a slightly hazy red body with a quarter inch of off-white head. Smells predominantly like chipotle peppers. Chipotle pepper dominates the flavor too, a bit of a sweetness with fruit, caramel and cinnamon-like notes and a subtle hotness toward the finish. Light to medium in body with ample carbonation. Fairly drinkable, though the subtle hotness gets to me after a while. An interesting beer for sure - never had a chile beer before and I can't say I think I'll be a fan of the style. Glad to have tried it, well worth the try, but I don't foresee picking this one up again..."
"D - No real stand out chilie flavors, and the bitter zing was not welcoming for large sips."
"I put this beer as a spin-off of the great flavors found in Schlenkerla's Marzen... something about smoky beers just does it for me."
"Drinkability: Very smooth for a chile beer. The balnce on this one is amazing with the hops, malt, and chiles all blending nicely. One, if not the best in the style that I have had that was not on tap. I will look for this again, but one bomber at a time is good enough."
"D: I enjoyed the first 12oz. but after that, my tastebuds really didn't get much deeper than the smokey flavors. I appreciate this as something different and would drink it again, but it will not be often. This is a beer that would really benefit from the right food pairing."
"The mouth is crisp, but slightly wetter than I'd prefer. Decent amount of carbonation. This is really different. This is my first of the Chili beers. I can't place the hot spice right off, it's more of a harsh bitter quality. But as I continue to drink this the spicy jalepenos come out in a big way! Nice spicy aftertaste. This beer is not for the weak. It's different, it's bold, and, I must say, it's pretty dang good."
"If you like chipotle and smoke a lot, you'll probably find this drinkable. Personally, I found it overpowered the more pleasant flavours here. I only drank about half the bottle, saving the rest for cooking."
"You can tell peppers were used, but mostly in the aftertaste and a bit of warmth in the throat. Typical Rogue quality...solid."
"This would probably be good with some Mexican food."
"Drinkability: only one i will drink probably couldn't finish a bomber by myself"
"3.5 D: One is plenty, but it's a good ride."
"Dark gold or light copper/orange in color. Heavy and frothy foam head when poured into a glass. The nose is pretty standard and does nothing to reveal the chipotle. The attack of the beer is refreshing and clean. There is definitely some zip to the flavor that actually drinks similarly to many hoppy beers. The finish is pretty clean. Where is the chipotle you might ask? Good question. After taking a sip you have to be patient and let it develop a little bit in your mouth. It is very subtle and comes to the back of the mouth and tongue well after the liquid has gone down your throat. This beer rewards the patient beer drinker. While I certainly enjoyed this beer, it is probably more the novelty than the actual quality. Perhaps novelty adds to quality however. I just did my best to call the numbers as I saw them."
"This is a very interesting beer. I thought the pepper was really balanced but a lot of the people who tried it with me thought otherwise. The beer is a nice amber color with a fluffy off white head and great lacing. The smell is what's the most odd about this beer to me. It smelled a lot like beer, but it smelled almost like something had gone wrong in the process. It didn't smell bad, it just smelled different. I will attribute that to the chipotle peppers. The taste is great though, with nice caramel overtones and not a whole lot of smokiness or stiff spicy flavor. It's in the finish where the chipotle peppers shine... instead of an alcohol burn on the way down you get a really nice warming sensation from the presence of the peppers. This would be a great beer on a cold winter night. The mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing considering the peppers. Definitely not a beer you'll be having more than two of in one evening."
"Had this before the poker game yesterday. Poured a hazy orange amber color with thick foamy white head, almost like what cooking caramel looks like. Plenty of lacing. Smelled of yeast and a little pepper. Tasted of malts, a dash of hops, with a nice peppery kick. Wow! Incredibly smooth, considering the pepper. No more than two, though."
"drinkability is good but now that the person i split this one would not drink more the a few oz's 1 bomber will be all i can handle"
"Rogue Chipotle Ale is a hazy amber beer with a fluffy yellow head that has great retention. It smells like a home brew. There are green, grassy notes in the nose, but I'm not picking up any pepper. It has a medium-light body that's smooth and creamy with a clean, dry finish. There's a roasted malt flavor up front and then the taste of smoky chipotle kicks in. There's not much spice, but plenty of flavor. It's well balanced and very drinkable."
"Slightly chewy feel. A good amount of carbonation. A nicely crisp, drinkable brew. A good ale with a bit of complex spice and smoke added."
"D-Well, I like this well enough, but frankly, one is enough for now. Will seek it out again."
"Spicey and smooth mouthfeel, considering that it burns as you drink it, its not very drinkable, but I like spicy food, so this isn't that bad to me! What a very unique beer, you either love it or hate it, everyone should try this at least once!"
"I realize it's a niche beer and it probably lacks favor with the masses, but I wish it brought even more chipolte. I want to taste it! It's a pleasant beer, a fairly easy-drinking one. Still (and here I go again), I wonder what I'd have if DFH did a chipolte ale. I can't help but think I'd taste the pepper in that one! Until then, I think this is a neat beverage worth trying, and I'd pick it up again to complement my comida de mexicana. O mi bbq!"
"I'm thinking grilled sausages on summer day. Reckon!"
"Good drinkability on this brew. Decent flavor; interesting although not as powerful as I would have liked (I wasn't asking to breathe fire or anything). I will probably try this beer again just because it has such an interesting feel to it."
"Overall - About what I expected as the beer matches what is advertised on the label well."
"D - While it's probably the best out of the few chile beers I've had it's a struggle to get through a whole pint. Nothing wrong with the beer but not something I'll be buying again. Maybe good for a Mole black and tan with Rogue Chocolate Stout?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation that makes the sugary sweet malt come through the heat barrier."
"Wow! What a surprise this beer was. We had it at a tasting at our house. Right from the start you could smell the spices. Great color and body. The taste was impressive as well. Strong hop flavor along with citrus but then you can taste the chili flavor at the tip of your tongue. It has a little heat but it does not linger. We all enjoyed this beer and will be picking up another bottle soon. It would pair well with BBQ."
"It's hard to rate drinkability on this. It's definitely tasty and easy to drink, but I can't really think of a time when I'd want a chipotle-flavored beverage."
"Appearance out of the pour was a dark amber. Aroma held malt and smokey spice. Taste was typical ale with distinct smokey pepper. Unique beer but the smokey chipotle flavor paired with a typical ale turned out distinct yet not tastey. Praise Rogue for originality."
"Pours an amber/honey color, slightly cloudy, with a cream colored head. Aroma is mild with detectable caramel malt and honey notes. Taste is a bready malt with a hint of jalapeno that becomes more pronounced in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a medium body with medium carbonation. An interesting beer, but not one that I would keep on hand."
"Pours a light copper topped with a finger and a half of white head. Retention isn't great, but is nothing to complain about. Smell is faint but very distinct chipotle peppers. Taste - smooth mild and smoky chipotle pepper taste that is very genuine. The chipotle is the main taste in the beer, but is not in-your-face. There is a very thin malt sweetness at first that comes and then goes, accompanied by a carbonic bite and finally a bone dry semi-bitter finish, but no real hop flavor. High carbonation, bordering on fizzy, but never going over the top. I think this would go great with some BBQ."
"worth trying. i don't see this beer coming around again though."
"D - A great beer but not one I would drink repeatedly. I would consider this good with corn soup or mac and cheese since I like Tabasco chipotle with pasta and cheese. A well brewed chile beer proving it can be made without dwarfing the taste of the beer and doesn't mask the ale's taste. I found this to nice when blended with the 10,000 brew at EBF and with Stone's Bitter Oatmeal chocolate stout"
"Pours out into an orange-reddish color with moderate head. Smells faintly of smoke and peppers. Taste is of some smoke, with the slow burn of some mild hot peppers that lasts quite a while. Overall, quote light, and not as overwhelming as some chili ales I have sampled, but the burn lasts longer than I would expect. I found myself nursing this over a long period of time, much longer than I would have had something similar without the peppers."
"Pours a solid amber color with a sticky, white head that stays for a good long while. It smells like someone poured some kind of chili powder into a stock ale. Odd to say the least. The peppery sensation sits in the nose, but isn't strong enough to make me sneeze or anything. The Chipotle taste isn't as powerful as I would have originally thought. Instead, it sits in the mouth long after all of the other flavors have passed, burning slightly...more like pepper than anything else. As for the other flavors, there are some pretty decent hop notes that bitter the whole thing up, but they lose out to the peppered flavor."
"Drinkability - I liked this beer overall, but I like spicy foods. I actually enjoyed this while eating food that had been smoked all day, which could have prepared my taste buds for it."
"I have a good amount of experience using this pepper both whole and in powder form and let me tell you the flavor just wasn't there. I am very disappointed"
"Overall: Very easy to drink, the spicy pepper aspect is pretty light so most people will enjoy this beer. Nice sweetness to balance the spiciness. I could easily have a couple of these, especially while eating some good mexican food."
"D - This is definitely not a beer I'd drink on a regular basis but as an occasional oddity its not bad. I found the taste to be very interesting although not that refreshing and it definitely did not leave me wanting more. I had it with steak tacos which turned out to be a great pairing. I'll probably drink this again but not in the near future."
"D- If you can handle the heat then go ahead and hit a few of these."
"Overall - A cool experiment and definitely something to try, but too overpowering. Not something I see myself having again."
"I really enjoyed this one."
"D: glad I had it, but hard to imagine ever drinking more than 1 of these. Glad I could share the bomber."
"Pours a very golden body, big creamy foamy head, diminishing. Smokey hoppy aroma, not quite cigarette but close, not ashy. Smokey, malty taste, more chipotley now. Not sweet, not hoppy. Clean aftertaste. The smoke is subtle, would go well w/bbq, or any grilled meat."
"I would say it's an interesting beer to try, but best to have a few friends around to taste with you as I couldn't do a whole 22 by myself"
"I had no idea what to expect upon buying this one. The aroma definitely has chipotle with the usual hops. Pours deep amber with a medium tan head. The taste is actually very mild. Hoppy and malty, the chipotle takes a back seat. You can taste it, but its not like that horrible. It wasn't to enjoyable."
"D- Very drinkable pepper beer. The chipotle was far from overpowering and could have been increased without being offensive."
"I love Rogue beers and I really like spicy food, but felt that this beer was just awful. It was too hot and actually tasted like Chipotle, or like it had to be spiced with jalapeno. I had it on tap and had to force myself to drink this beer like I was back in rugby hazing. I'd rather have a tequila shot, and I hate tequila."
"My overall impression of this is that its a novelty beer. I'd drink it again for sure but because of the hop and spice mix, something I know doesn't mix well with alot of foods, I'd have a hard time pairing it, and would limit it to rare occasions when I'd want an odd beer out."
"YOu know what you're getting yourself into when you order a Chipotle Ale and this one was quite good. I'd definitely order it again but I'd need some time in between..."
"I can imagine this pairing nicely with a lot of American & Mexican cuisine. I would maybe like a little more hop presence & a little less malt in a beer like this, as the malts just end up stale and boring to me. Still, an easy drinking good beer to pair with meals in the summer."
"Big fan of Rogue, but can do without this one. I would recommend to others to try it, but will not plan on doing this one again."
"d: delicious well-balanced mix of spice and sweet, it can be a refreshing break during a night of strong beers."
"overall- this is a very tasty beer. I love smoked beers (rauchbiers, etc). This one soft of tastes like a mixture Rogue's American Amber with a hint of their Smoke Ale....both of which are my favorites, so its not surprising that i like this. get it."
"Interesting beer. Well worth a taste as it is well balanced in flavors and the heat compliments and doesn't overwelm."
"I enjoyed it, but it is not my usual beer experience. A style of its own, I think."
"Taste has some of the same cardboard that was present in the nose. Sweet malts are pretty dominant with a short bright burst of hop bitterness in mid to late sip. The smoky peppers finally come through on the very end with a lingering and quite noticeable heat in the back of the throat. I like that, but then again, I like really spicy food. I could see this being a turn off for many. I think I might try to score a fresh bottle of this and see if it is any better."
"D: I think a couple sips of this is enough to satisfy my curiosity of the flavor, but I found myself having trouble finishing the bottle. This is definitely beer with character. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll try it again."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color with a large white head that had decent retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Has a smokey and earthy aroma. The flavor likewise is very Rauchbier in charactor. Very smokey with a little spice kick and heat coming in on the finish at the back of the throat. Has enough of a body to carry the smoke and chile spice. Moderate carbonation. A good beer but not something I would want to drink much of or often for that matter."
"A: Reddish copper, thin layer of patchy head - 4.00, S: Subtle smoke on the nose along with the zest of the jalapenos, very earthy aroma, hops are hard to discern but a hearty malt backing is apparent, a more pleasant smell than I would generally expect from a chile beer - 4.00, T: A medium malt base, definite heat but far from overpowering, a very veggie quality to the beer, some hop bite on the tail - 3.50, M: Medium bodied - 3.50, D: Chile beers certainly aren't a some draw to me, but this one is reasonable to the point of making it quite drinkable - 3.50"
"Poured a clear copper orange into my Guiness pint glass. A thin one-finger off-white head quickly dissipated and left little lacing on the inside of the glass throughout the drink. Aroma is a lot of malt with the chipotle spiciness detectable. Mouthfeel is bland, medium-bodied and medium carbonation. Taste is malty, with a bit of smokiness from the chipotle in the middle, then a twinge of hoppy bitterness and finishes with an odd smoky spiciness. This beer has to be pretty warm to get the full effect of the active ingredient. Overall this is an ok beer. I think drinkability is moderate. For the style, I'm sure this is pretty good, but as a stand-alone brew I am not a huge fan."
"One of the top rated beers for style."
"A three-finger tan head tops off a reddish-orange brew. Retention is good, with some streaking, diminutive chunks of lace left here and there around the pint glass. The aroma involves, not surprisingly, some spicy peppers, malts and citrus. The taste is as unique as the smell, with some good peppery notes that linger in the aftertaste and keep things fairly hot throughout. The hops and malts mix in right underneath the peppers and are a bit overshadowed. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied, and it's light on the carbonation. Rogue can be hit or miss sometimes, but as with the Hazelnut brown, this one blends unique elements to make interesting and very drinkable brews."
"D= Best peppered beer that I've had so far. Still tastes like beer actually. something drinkable. I like it and next time I make enchiladas I'm gonna buy it again. Other than that I can't imagine drinking it again though"
"Overall it accomplishes what it set out to do perfectly, but it just isn't particularly appealing or complex. It's a great novelty, but not a great beer."
"got a bomber of this, super great. this is one of the more interesting beers ive had. great unfiltered orange appearance with a nice white head. the smell is great, really unique. not much of hops, a bit of sweet carmel malts, but loaded with bbq, hickory smokiness which is just really unique and interesting, in a good way. the smokiness is definltey stronger in the nose than the mouth, the taste is much spicer and accute than the smell that is less pin pointed. less smokey, much more chile, chiptole, jalepenos. tickles the palate on the way out. everything i wanted in this beer in regards to taste. tons of notes reminding me of bbqs, hickory chips, and tons of hot peppers. the drinkability isnt too high, in regards to quantity. but for quality i think it really is highly drinkable and enjoyable. really, really happy with this. another great beer from rogue."
"I thought this beer was very good. The smell of chipotle peppers was strong. The taste was very smokey. If you hate these two attributes then you will no doubt hate this beer, but as a chile head and a fan of all things smokey, I really enjoyed this beer. I had this with spicy chile and would buy it again. I think it would be a nice beer to cook with as well as drink with BBQ or mexican."
"D-I did not care for this beer. I think the pepper flavors were too prominent, which left no room for other beer flavors to represent. An interesting beer to try, but I won't be trying this one again in the future."
"Cheers!!!"
"I'm getting a little heartburn from an entire bomber of this stuff. One is good enough but damn if this is not one fine chile beer."
"I just cracked this after having it for a while. I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised! Very normal color and the head is good. The smell is a little odd, probably the peppers in there. When I taste it, there's a little malt not a lot of hops. The Chipotle is very nice on the back end! I would buy this beer again, but you will need to have a taste for it! Very nice drinker!"
"I had no idea what to expect upon buying this one. The aroma definitely has chipotle with the usual hops. Pours deep amber with a medium tan head. The taste is actually very mild. Hoppy and malty, the chipotle takes a back seat. You can taste it, but its not like that horrible Cave Creek Chili beer. It was enjoyable, but I probably won't buy this one again."
"Its smoky and smooth, and very clean tasting. I really cant describe more than that, this is truly a strange brew, don't know if I'll ever buy it again, but its pairing well with my spicy chicken sandwich."
"This is my first ""spiced"" beer I have ever tried and The only reason I even got this is to try all the Rogues I have never tried. I was not impressed at all by this one. Poured a red color with a good 2 finger head on it. Pepper comes out in the nose right away and that's pretty much all im pulling out of this one. Taste as it smells, very peppery, very spicy especially in the end...good med. bodied feel to it. I will not drink this again."
"Taste is really complicated. You don't notice any heat until a couple seconds after the sip. It's followed up by a lot of burnt smokyness.. like charring a marshmallow at a campfire a little too much. It's very faint though. Good balance between the sweet and some of the darker/more acrid crystal malts. Hops have a definite consistent presence throughout the experience, lending a nice floral, juicyness to the beer that rounds out some of the more extreme flavors. I keep getting little pangs of heat in my mouth but it's completely unnoticeable when you're actually drinking the beer. I think if you bumped the alcohol up on this a bit and took out the peppers it'd just be a good British barleywine. But.. it's not. It's got peppers and it's doing its own thing. Good enough for me. Not totally irresistable, but it's got a lot gong on there and they did it right without making me feel like I'm drinking alcoholic fireball water. Mouthfeel is if anything a little undercarbonated. You sort of have to draw a fine line because much more and you'd be interfering with the rest of the beer but I think it could use a little bit more for the mouthfeel and also to improve some of the head's performance. Pretty easy drinking too. The hops really pull through as the saving factor for both drinkability and the spicy flavor. If they weren't there I probably wouldn't like the beer at all. But it all comes together very well and I'm impressed that they did it."
"Smooth and rich, with a nice semi-full body. I think this is where it shines, with the mouthfeel. The spice isn't a fire, just a mild spice, and the smoke makes it flavorful and adds complexity. Cheers Rogue! Nicely done."
"I feel like a Chile Beer is a novelty act. This one tastes good if your in the mood for some sadist beer drinking. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food and a good beer but I get real tired of this one fast. I judge beer mostly on whether or not I'd buy it again. As for appearance, smell, taste, yada yada yada, this one gets semi high marks but only when confined to the style. Other then for cooking I would never buy this beer again."
"D: Obviously, one wouldn't want to session this beer, but it's quite drinkable because the intensity from the peppers isn't overbearing, though the flavor is sufficient. Another solid beer from Rogue."
"Definitely an enjoyable beer. I'm glad I didn't listen to some warnings from others; for an interesting beer, this is a great try that's worth coming back for again."
"Im usually not a fan of this style of specialy ale but this really was quite the tasty beer, kinda a malty brown ale with a big addition of spice. Probably something I will buy again, though Im not sure when."
"This beer feels like a series of wrongs that add up to a right. Each attribute has deficient areas, but all together they seem overall minor. Good beer and will become my beer of choice for the chile beer category."
"Ok, this is what it is, a very spicy well crafted beer of it's kind. You will like it if you are a fan of hot buffalo chicken wings. If you can't stand the heat...stay out of the kitchen! I feel it's one of the best of it's type, and worth a try. Don't be a ""cry baby", try something different for a change."
"D- I had to pour this down the drain first beer Ive ever done this with."
"It tastes something like a heavier malted amber ale, with a lot of spiciness, and some spicy heat to make it interesting, without being over the board as I was afraid. All in all, quite tasty, and not offensive. I am glad I tried."
"Another worthy entry to the wonderful line of Rogue beers. Pours a nice dark amber into my glass, with minimal head. Taste is smooth before a mild bite of heat at the end. There is a lingering oily heat present from the peppers that are infused into the beer, and a smokiness that reminds me a bit of Alaska's vaunted Smoked Porter. This would go great with some spicy Mexican food. Bravo!"
"This brew is a clear amber color with a thick and creamy off-white head that recedes slowly. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. Smokey aroma with prominent peppers and light hops. Medium-bodied with flavors of spicy pepper, sweet malt and citrus hops. The finish is spicy with a fresh pepper aftertaste. Maybe I am still gunshy years after my Cave Creek experience but I really want nothing to do with these types of beers."
"Poured the bomber into a pint glass, pours a orange color with a foamy white head that leavs on lace on the glass. Smell is of roasted pepper, with hints of mellow malt. Taste is a bit different, first when tasting it my toungue had a cooling senstation, then as I swallowed my throat had a burning fee. I could taste the nice malt character with a smoked pepper feel as it slipped down my throat. This when godo with the salsa I was eating that night, overall I enjoyed this and the peppery taste made my mouth water for more."
"M&D- Dry and hot. Consume with powerful food."
"All in all this drinks like a light, spicy rauchbier with a good malt feel for an ale. The acidity of the peppers and the hop bill contribute well to what would inherently be a low drinkability quotient for me, but this really isn't too bad at all. Worked well with my bowl of chili, too."
"D - This beer is strangely beautiful. First pepper beer that i've tried and me likey."
" Mouthfeel is carbonated, with a bite. It is a very drinkable beer, although I would prefer something that is a bit spicier."
"How much you enjoy this beer depends on how much you like spicy foods. You're not going to finish the bottle if you like to avoid spicy foods, or suffer from heartburn. You will enjoy it if you absolutely love everythig spicy. AS for me, I knocked down the drinkability just because it's hard to drink this beer. I've had Cave Creek's Chili Beer, and this is way more drinkable though. This one at least gives you a chance. Recommended (for the spicy food lover)."
"Pours a deep clear copper hue with a fluffy three finger off-white head that slowly falls to a thin layer of cream. A bit of webbing remains on the sides of the glass throughout the tasting. Smell is musty and spicey with a touch of caramel malt. Some smoked meats and earthy hops in the nose as well. Very subtle aroma which is nice. Taste begins lightly smokey with some dusty grains and pale malts. The pepper flavor doesn't really emerge until midway with a slight kick that lingers into the aftertaste. What pepper flavor is there though, isn't much. I was expecting more, and to be honest was hoping for more. A noticable citrus hop is detected here and there throughout which reminds me that this is still a beer. As you progress drinking this, it definitely gets warmer in the mouth. Light to medium body with a prickly feel to it. A unique beer for sure, one I'm glad I tried but don't plan to revisit anytime soon. Not bad, but not great. Give it a shot if you feel adventurous."
"D - Let's just say I hope I can make it through the rest of the bomber. The heat grows after repeated sips, and honestly it's giving me a bit of heartburn. It's a great flavor, but not exactly something I want to sip on for very long. Might be a good beer to pair with food, or better yet, a great brew to use as a base for a lot of beer/tomato juice cocktails."
"Poured a hazy/cloudy deep golden color with decent white head that dissipated pretty quickly. Aroma is very malty and peppery. Flavor is peppery with smoky notes to it as well. The mouthfeel was thin to medium. I liked this a lot, but I think one bomber would probably be my limit at any one time."
"Slight peppery taste, medium carbonation. Honey colored. Very light lacing around the glass. Pleasure to drink. I wish I had another! Pepper taste lingers for a little bit but is never overpowering. One of my favorites from Rogue and one of the few that I don't look for hops flavor."
"There is much left to be desired in this beer. Yet there is still much to enjoy as is."
"D- Easy to drink, the smoked flavor is good and unique compared to other smoked beers."
"The chipotles are definitely there in the flavor but more of a background smoky/spicy... more smoky than spicy at first sip.. citrus hops are still there as is the standard Amber ale flavors.. Brenda says it goes great with lime flavored tortilla chips. Body is standard Amber as well... the smoky chipotle flavor is more of a novelty to me... I like to use chipotles in my Chili.. I may have to give a little bit of Rogue love to my next batch... but otherwise I don't see me picking this up again unless I am using it something I am cooking... interesting, but not my cup of tea."
"D- interesting and worth a try, flavoring is amazing but not enjoyable for me"
"The beer did look nice and red in the glass, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was food coloring."
"I'm confused. I had this beer a year or two ago and I don't remember it being anywhere near this overwhelming. Maybe I got a bad batch? I have no idea."
"I am having a hard time appreciating any flavors besides the pepper in the flavor, and it only grows more pronounced in the finish. I am a huge wimp with spicy foods and I don't enjoy this at all. I'm not lowering my ratings much based on personal preference: the mouthfeel seems just about right for most beers, but you have to know brewing this beer that drinkability and flavor are going to be even more subjective than ""ordinary"" flavors."
"Creamy and soft with great drinkability. Devilishly smooth, warm, and satisfying."
"Drinkability is pretty good however. For an experimental style beer, this is certainly one for the bitter tongues and hot sauce elite. Definitely not a bad Rogue brew at all."
"As far as drinkability goes, this is a brew that I could probably have a couple of glasses of without issue, and might be really nice with pizza, but I imagine I'd get tired of it kind of before too long."
"D - Good for a starter, but not one to have a bunch of."
"Mouthfeel is a bit slick and runny, moderate carbonation. Surprisingly drinkable for what it is. Not just a novelty. Would love a pint of this with some smokey barbecued ribs."
"Get it the next time you have guests and intend to serve a spicy dish."
"My wife added a lime to hers, and it was even better!!"
"D - I don't think I can drink the rest of this pint its just not drinkable to me I'd say avoid this beer"
"D: Not a bad beer, nice complement to a meal but something I would rarely want to drink on its own. Worth a try."
"D: I guess if your up for spices or what not, you may like but it doesnt come across well. First beer from Rogue I found undrinkable. Just not my cup o tea."
"overall, thisis a decent brew but not a style that i think ill get again"
"D: This is definitely a beer to be had with a meal. Would really complement some BBQ or mexican food. I wouldn't drink this as a relaxing beer on a night after work, but given the right circumstances I would drink this again."
"Chipotle Ale pours a deep, hazy, orange with a red pepper tinge to it and a fuzzy off-white lid. Lighly sweet caramel and toasted malts with some citrusy fruit and hints of spiciness. The flavor is the same with a better, more distinctive, red peppery spiciness that creeps in from behind. Straight medium body with a pleasantly fuzzy and soft carbonation. Nice, interesting beer that I wouldn't mind having again every once in a while."
"D. Honestly, one of these is enough for me. Good for the style, definately, and Rogue doesn't seem to make bad beer. It just gets to be too spicy after a while."
"This would pair well w/ some bbq ribs or a some pulled pork."
"Poured the 22 oz. bomber bottle into a mug and received a lightly-tinted brown with a frothy, one-finger head that died at a medium pace. Some earthy hops and a light malt base in the smell, but I really picked up the peppers (reminded me of a pot of baked beans for a second). I wouldn't say dry or crisp for the mouthfeel, but just heat. This was like a good ale with a noticeable hop presence and some malts in there. Then it was like I did a shot of hot sauce. OK, it is a little bit more complicated than that, but I am trying to get a point across. My mouth actually heated up from this beer. I am not a big chili fan, and I thought the chipotle peppers overpowered the ale a tad, but I would recommend this to try once to anyone."
"Oh my god. Had this in the 22 ounce bottle. Murky amber colors with a thin, frosty head was the general appearance. The aromas were fascinating: actual spices like light jalapenos and peppers. Incredible smells! The taste creates a lingering, mild spice that is infectious. Hops mixed with peppers and hot sauce create an eclectic mix that is just great. Good solid body helps the flavors really come out. My first Chile Beer was great; I cannot wait to have more!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is brownish orange with not much more than a lacing of head. The nose has nice smokiness and some spicy zip; you can really smell the chipotle. The taste mimics the nose in that smokiness comes in first followed by a nice spicy kick. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous and it has a dry finish. I paired the beer with a steak burrito and it paired nicely, the smokiness of the beer and the slight spice complemented the burrito."
"D: Definitely not a session beer, The hot roasted peppers brings a spicy and sauciness that was quite unique. On bomber should be plenty. A novelty beer but a very good one at that and worth a try for the adventurous beer drinker seeking out something different. Will definitely spicy up your night."
"Drinks easily. Not the chile heat that I expected, but that is probably not a bad thing. Interesting as ""something different", but not enough to it (in any direction of the several that it goes) to get again."
"I don't want to penalize the beer to much though, since I think it's very true to its style. Just not for everyone."
"drinkability is good. this brew is exactly what it claims to be on the bottle: 'a delicate smooth crisp flavor with a subtle, smokey chipotle finish'. cheers!"
"Aye carumba, a spicy beer that works rather than burns and offends. This is a solid Rogue Ale with that great roasted chipotle taste on the finish. No, it doesn't scour your mouth out but rather it works with any spicy food or even better try it with food that is not spicy like a bowl of vegetable soup; it brings its own spice to the table. It is totally drinkable by itself( there is a smokiness to the finish like a lighter version of rogue smoke). Cool beer that is a benchmark for the style."
"I would be curious as to the ABV on this one (above it says ""?")"
"I don't know if the bottle was bad, or if I just hated the beer, but this one went straight down the drain after just a few sips. The beer poured a reddish color and smelled like chipotles. It also tasted quite a bit like them. Now I really like chipotle peppers, but something with this beer didn't agree with me. The person I was splitting the bomber with finished his glass, something I couldn't do. I have liked everything else from Rogue so I was expecting to like this one. But it just wasn't drinkable. I guess it is an acquired taste."
"D: Decent."
"I bought this beer with high expectations. I enjoy many of Rogue's brews. Poured a clear reddish color with a pretty good head. Smelled fairly citrusy, I was trying to detect any chipotle pepper spice but must have been way in the back. The taste was a little surprising. A bit thin and I was really hoping for a heavy pepper taste. There was a noticable ""heat"" but for the most part it was fairly well balanced. I guess it is good it isn't too overpowering or it would be hard to quaff."
"It's a light reddish, caramel color with a light tan head and has plenty of carbonation and very little lacing; it has a nice hoppy aroma to along with some spicy undertone and a mild citrus smell, but nothing like chipotle peppers. It has a clean and refreshing feel; it's pretty smooth and leaves a slight film in your mouth. It is mildly spicy, I think I was expecting something much hotter, but is very tasty. There is some bitterness in its aftertaste that really compliments the spiciness to it. This is a pretty good beer over all and I'll be buying again soon."
"D - drinks nice, a good beer, not really a spiced beer for my taste."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Smokestack goblet. The beer pours a reddish copper with a big off white head that dissipates into just a thin layer, leaving sticky lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma starts out as the sweet spiciness that comes from a fresh green jalapeno. There is a subtle sweetness that balances the spiciness very well. The taste is mildly oily and leaves a nice spiciness on the lips and tongue. For someone that really enjoys spicy food, this beer is really good. The mouthfeel is a bit thick honestly. I wish it was a bit thinner. I think that it would balance the spiciness a bit better. While, I think this is a good beer, it would be hard to drink more than a bomber."
"Pours a nice looking amber color with nice copper highlights and a white head on top that dissolves fairly slowly, although there's no real lacing. Nose is spicy malt, some smokiness, and roasted malt as well. Taste is similar. Spicy malt up front, some toffee and smokiness in there too. The chipotle spice shows up in the middle and sticks it through the aftertaste, a strangely spicy brew (my first chile brew). Kind of like a mild bitter or solid spicy malt beer, taken to the extreme in terms of spiciness. Overall, I liked this one. Very interesting."
"D: I will probably have it next time with some spicy food. Very nice beer if you are in the mood for something a little spicy. Definatly worth a try."
"I'm not sure if it was actually unfiltered or not, but this definitely looked like it. It was a pretty dark brown with a sweet hops and spices scent. It wasn't very bitter at all. The prominent taste was malt, with other various peppery flavors mixed in. It started out very unique and interesting, but the more I drank it the more it tasted like a regular brown ale."
"The mouthfeel is oily, allowing the hops to stick to the mouth also allowing the heat to remain. Its an interesting beer and I am glad I tried it but it is clearly not something you would drink more than one of."
"I didn't pair this bottle with any food, but the natural choice would be anything mexican. It is kind of like a Dos Equis Amber, but more complex and with some heat."
"My score would be better if not for the ""below average"" appearance. Everything else is much better than expected."
"Pours a dark amber with a good deal of head, albeit dissipating slowly. Smells very early -- subtle hops, and a hint of the chipotle peppers. Nothing fantastic here. The taste is interesting, but I west left wanting more. The complexity isn't what I expected from a ""peppery"" ale. While I can taste a touch of the chipotle peppers in the aftertaste, it was never the focus nor an integral part of the ale. What was striking is the warmth of flavor and I don't mean temperature. The mouthfeel is exhilarating as the flavor is consistent while the liquid is on the palate, finishing nicely with a hint of pepper. I liked the overall feeling and general warm tasting deliciousness, but I would have liked more chipotles in the overall taste and especially in the smell. Good brew."
"The initial flavor is nothing too wild, until the pepper aftertaste gently burns the back of your throat. Reminiscent of a rauchbier, but with a kick. It's jolting-- almost as if you're drinking a spicy V8 in your beer. But the more I drank, the more I enjoyed it. The hotness never became overbearing, and the earthy hops and sugar balanced out well enough. I'm always on the lookout for unique beers, and this one is one of the most unique I've ever had. That said, one bomber was plenty."
"Smell is of hoppy citrus, but nothing outstanding. Taste is definitely smokey chipotle with a little hoppy bitterness on the finish. It would be awesome if it were just a tad sweeter, but all in all, its a pleasant brew. Very novelty, wouldn't be a regular brew."
"Over all I'm not that impressed bt the style."
"650 ML copped for $5.99 from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... been waiting a long time to sample this one... the chipotle essence had long piqued my interest, so I decided to give this one a try... Pours an amber, copper hue with a minimal frothy head that soon dissipated... smell was very clear, crisp, and clean with a slight spice essence that included a delicate balance of malts, hops, and caramel... the chipotle flavor was not as noticeable as I had been anticipating... a slight spice taste is subtely noticeable, but not at all overwhelming or too strong... a slight resemblance to an amber ale keeps striking my mind as I'm writing this... When I heard ""chipotle", I was expecting a strong spice flavor, but I didn't find that here... instead, I found a strong amber, red, taste... I wasn't dissapointed by the flavor at all... this is a classic Rogue brew with the distinct quality flavor and taste usually associated with the brewery... I really liked this one, and if you're a fan of Rogue brews, you are sure to like this one... easily drinkable with a nice mouthfeel... Definitely recommended..."
"Aroma was lacking, i did pick up a slight pepper scent. When I tasted it I was blown away. Ive never had a beer like this before and at first i was a little put off by the flavor. You can really taste the chipotle flavor. The more i drank of this beer, the more i appreciated it. Overall, I probably wouldnt go out of my way for it, but its a good beer, and I would drink it again."
"Nice rich honey amber color with a good frothy whitish head. Smells of a touch of sweetness as it warms, but mostly of hops, and a slight bit of spicy heat, yet not a smoky chipotle spice smell at all. Taste is surprisingly smooth, hoppy, faintly sweet, a decent bit bitter, and perhaps the faintest bite of spice, but it might also just be flavor from the hops. There is a touch of sweetness in the aftertaste which is nice. It does have a warming effect in the chest area after it goes down also, but its definitely not a chipotle smell or smoked taste on the palate. Subtle but still nice, and even though I was expecting a touch more hearty spicy smokiness from the chipotle, It may have made for an overly spicy, unenjoyable beer. This may be the right spice level, but I wish it had a hint of smokiness still. Overall pretty well balanced, but maybe not what you'd expect from looking at the bottle. Good but was a bit pricy at $5.50 for a 22 oz bottle. I liked this beer more and more as I drank it"
"D. Hard to say... I rated it average as this is my first experience with a chile beer. I'd definitely drink this one again, but I'm not sure when I'd be in the mood for it."
"Drinkability- I felt that it was decent beer but not one I would go for all the time but is a good change of pace."
"A very nice, refreshing, sessionable ale from Rogue."
"Pours a cloudy amber - kind of reminds me of a Belgian brew. Nose is muted, but with a touch of a sweet edge. Flavor is actually pretty damn good. Starts off with an almost overly sweet tone which slowly morphs into something smoky and clean. The smoked peppers actually keep in your mouth. Over time as it warms up the smokey flavors REALLY come out. Feel is a bit thin, and it is drinkable (though a 22 oz bomber might be a bit too much for one person in one sitting), even though this is a chile beer."
"This is the type of beer that isn't for everyone. I personally enjoy it as I really like spicy foods. This beer would definitely go well with a burger or something more. I feel it's well done for the style as well."
"D - The heat is a nice tingle, but I expected more smoke. Too raisiny for my taste."
"I was given this bottle as a gift a while back. In the interim, I was able to sample this on draught at Slows BBQ in Detroit (for only $2!). On draught, I thought this was a nice, smoky beer with a bit of heat that complimented the BBQ well. Maybe I waited too long to crack this bottle open, but I'm not getting much of the heat component here. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing, but what I'm tasting now is sweet and smoky rather than smoky and hot. The appearance of this beer is where it shines with its nice cloudy deep brown color and quickly dissipating head. The aroma is smoky, but could be more intense (again, could be a function of my waiting to open the bottle). Regardless, this is an interesting brew that is worth seeking out. It would work great in a chili recipe. Recommended."
"Unlike most novelty beers, I'm glad I tried this one. If it were cheaper, I'd try it again, but there are so many outstanding bombers available for just $1 more in Columbus (this was $4), like Hop Rod Rye, the Avery barleywine ... yeah, especially those two. I'm glad a Rogue flavor bomber finally came through for me."
"The only reason you should drink this is if you hate beer and you only want the alcohol."
"Feel is thick and chunky. Sandpapery. Leaves a smoky film. In fact, the overall word is ""smoky."" It's sweet but pungent. Really interesting."
"D - Not so much. Not a session beer by any means."
"Ugh."
"I tried to file a BeerSpy report; unfortunately once you pick New Hampshire you have 14 stores to chose from and there is no 'Other/Not listed'. Purchased from Wine Society in north Nashua, NH which has a small handpicked selection of beers (and no dust)."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, appropriately carbonated. This is definitely a bit of a novelty beer and not something I'd have very often, but I'd have it again if the mood struck me right."
"Now i start to get the chile parts of the beer--a little burning in the back of the throat from the jalapenos, very balanced though--amazingly drinkable. Very good overall. I don't know how old this is or how age has affected it, but very good and very subtle with the chile--expertly done."
"Amber color with a crusty, rocky, off-white head that lasts a while and clings to the sides. Not much aroma, faint caramel and slightly fruity malt notes, and just hint of some bitter hop esters. Dry grains and dry bitter hops up front and earthy, woody notes in the back. Chipotle heat is perceived in the back of the throat and esophagus, and minimally on the palate. I dont know how they achieved this but its nice that the chipotle heat doesnt wreck the palate. Midway through a slight sweetness develops along with some organic soily smoky notes. The finish is pretty much clean at first but then chipotle flavor arrives way late. Light to medium body and mouthfeel is about average, could have done with something thinner. Chipotle flavor becomes more noticeable as it warms but still much lighter than I remember it the previous couple of times Ive had this beer."
"D- I am glad I tried it, but I don't think I will buy it again. I like spicy foods, but not a big fan of spicy beers."
"D- this is a great tasty treat, but would be difficult to drink iin session, the chipotle taste might get annoying after a while."
"D- I thought I was going to be blown away by chipotle peppers in this one; but I was surprised at how mild the flavor was. The peppers were presented very tastefully. I love trying unique brews like this and I think they are very interesting. Drinkability is high but its a novelty treat rather than something I want all the time. Job well done."
"Seriously undrinkable. I couldn't even finish a sample. I love Rogue, but there's no reason to buy this other than to go ""dude, check out how weird this beer is"" or maybe to use as a marinade for beef jerky. I guess it does technically deliver what it says it will deliver, but I just can't in good conscience give this a good review."
"Drinkability was high, although I couldnt really see paying for it."
"The beer was dark yellow golden colored with a thin white head. The aroma was surprisingly hoppy, I didn't get any chili peppers out of the smell. The taste was citrucy hoppy and a bit spicy, but the spicy heat must have come from peppers instead of hops. It was really pretty nice against the weak caramel malt flavors in the background. I plan to try it again from the bottle sometime."
"Poured into my Hennepin glass. Pours a reddish brown with a healthy inch head that settles slowly into a lacy 1/2 inch or so. The beer is cloudy and I don't see much carbonation. The smell starts out with a nice, fruity, gummi bear like hop aroma backed immediately with a smooth and sticky malt character. The taste is interesting. The taste is much like an APA with a malt undertone topped with a smooth, mild-to-moderate hop bitterness. The chile peppers are faint but noticeable right in the middle of the drink. The pepper taste isn't there but the oil and waxy pepper effect is present. A slightly metallic spice and a bitterness that is separate from the bitterness given by any hop I've had gives it away. It sits more at the front of the tongue and has a residual, consistent effect. After you rest a few minutes from drinking it the pepper taste opens up a bit more with an acidic green chile resemblance."
"Taste: Not as spicy or different than I expected. Comes across at first as lightly to moderately hoppy then getting stronger in the hop department going down. A slight burning sensation remains in the mouth and throat after a pretty clean finish. Peppery character comes across faintly towards the middle, but you really have to be looking for it or you'll miss it. Good beer, but slightly disappointing."
"Overall, more drinkable than expected. I've tried Cave Creek Chili Beer before, and it was near unbearable, so when I picked this up, it was more an experiment. A good one! Cheers!"
"Overall, I like this beer, but is one i would have to be in the mood for to enjoy."
"Not recommended"
"D - This isn't a bad beer. I'm always a little leery of a Chile Beer, but this was really quite good."
"Drinkability- It isn't a bad beer. Maybe a bit pricey but not too bad."
"D - I could have a few of these. Of beers similar in style, this is probably about average. If I had to buy it, I would probably settle for a beer a little lighter on the wallet but with similar taste. This isn't a beer I would go out and buy a case of, but if my buddy offered it to me I'd have no problem drinking it."
"Drinkability: I think it's a good beer. This is my first chili beer. It's very easy to drink, and an interesting combination. Try one."
"Chipotle Ale pours a copper color with an off white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is malty, but there is a hint of some heat too. This beer has a very malty flavor, with only a hint of chili pepper which mostly is noticeable as a mild heat toward the end of the sip rather than as a flavor (although there is some flavor from the chili peppers, it is quite muted). Not bad, the only other chili flavored beer I've had is that abomination made by Cave Creek. Thankfully, this fares quite a bit better. Worth a try, if only to say you've had a chili flavored beer."
"D: For me, this is an occasional beer. It's tasty, but not something I'd want all the time. Definitely worth a try though."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Somewhat thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Balance seems fine. Honestly, I think this would be better if you were left with just the smoky element, and didn't have the pepper bite. Overall, an interesting beer, but not something I would be likely to pick up again."
"I'm torn as to whether I should deduct points for the lack of spiciness. In the end, I've decided to make the marks reflect the quality of the beer."
"nice orangy-amber color, with a great aroma of smoke and pepper. good mouthfeel, not too thin, but a slight dryness. flavor has a wonderful smoke up front with a clean spicy finish. good malt flavors linger in the background with a subtle sweetness. not much hop character to speak of, with the peppers and all. fantastic beer. the smoke flavor is great, and from what i understand, it's all from the smoked peppers, no smoked malt. one of my all time favorite beverages"
"Poured from the 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Body is somewhere between orange and maroon in color, with a small, creamy white head that instantly recedes to a thin halo. Aroma is first and foremost chipotle chili pepper, with some lightly sweet malt providing a little balance. Palate is mellow, lightly sweet malt up front, with the chipotle pepper building towards the back of the mouth. Finish is a good blend of sweet malt and pepper, but without a particularly high level of heat. Mouthfeel is akin to an English pub ale - smooth and velvety, without much in the way of carbonation. A great pairing with my spicy black bean chili, although it's not exactly a beer for everyday drinking."
"D: A good beer, would go well with Mexican food, I would have liked a little more robustness in the pepper aspect of this beer, but overall it was a good experience and I'm glad I tried it, and with this one revisited it."
"The smokey flavor was a little intense at times but for a chili beer I was very impressed. I would consider trying it again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and, as most Rogue beers, extremely well carbonated. Very drinkable. If nothing else was around, I could probably session this if I had to. But, Rogue makes more than a few better session beers than this. Overall, it's pretty good. Better than I was expecting. Check it out."
"D- pretty solid, a slightly spicy flavor that i hadnt had before, and is balanced well, providing an interesting and different finish of chili instead of hops"
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, while this beer is more drinkable than most beers of the style that try to burn your mouth, I believe this might be a much better beer to cook with than to drink."
"This beer poured a clear copper color with a rocky head that quickly fell. The aroma is malty and smoky. The taste is smoky and malty  pepper is noticeable but not overbearing. There is a slight pepper aftertaste, but not a burn. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and seems a bit oily. Im surprised at how drinkable this is.I might not have several in a row, but it is nicely balanced and not intimidating in the heat department."
"I'll be honest, I expected more chipotle kick, but nonetheless, this beer is very solid, very drinkable, and could easily qualify as session brew."
"D: Good but not one of my favorites. A sort of novelty beer that I've had one or two excellent examples of (one by Calapooia comes to mind...). This isn't bad but isn't one I'd have very often either...worth a try..."
"This feels a bit thick on the tongue for the taste. I think this could benefit from a bit more carbonation, considering the spicy aftertaste. This is not something I would try to drink more than one of...the combination of flavours make this a potent brew."
"D-I was expecting more out of this as I love both Rogue and Chipotle peppers. I was hoping this could be an Ingredient in my chili as the chipotle should have added to the effect. This is basically a dumbed down Rogue offering."
"Average body and carbonation. This one is good at first, but too warm for the lack of intense flavor that I had expected."
"Smooth and light mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable in a wierd savory kind of way. Paired very nicely with a Portabella burger. I will buy again."
"Although I couldn't drink pint after pint of this interesting ale, I do appreciate the creativity inherent in the recipe. The chipotle flavor is not overpowering and is quite interesting. I will purchase this brew again and have already started thinking about fun food pairings."
"Well, I've been a fan of Rogue beers for many years, so I expected a little more from this ale. It made me almost nervous that it was made with chipotle peppers; but it really didn't have an overly spicy taste. The ""hotness"" shows up on the finish a little. It is clean, and pure...and that's classic Rogue style, but the body was also light and a tad simple. It would be easy to pound a few of these; that is, if you like peppers."
"Very nice beer. I'd buy this again specifically to drink with a BBQ meal. Rogue once again pulls out a different, fantastic beer."
"The Appearance is orange and red, a little bit hazy. Smells of sweet roasted peppers and the taste is similar. Very interesting flavor. Spicy and sweet with roasted flavors which become more intense as the beer is consumed. Bold beer, not an everyday drinking beer but should be a treat on occasions."
"Don't drink and review."
"The drinkability of this was surprisingly high. I've always been really skeptical of chili beers ever since first reading about them in Papizan's homebrewing book. I have to say that I am really pleasantly surprised. I didn't get chance to session with this, so I can't say if the pepper would build, but from what I had, I wanted more."
"The beer poured a crisp amber with a decent head that diminished to a ring. The aroma was mostly malt with some pepper spiciness to it. The taste was mostly dominated by hot peppers, but they showed themselves the strongest when you hold the beer in the mouth. The beer is rather light and surprisingly smooth if you can take the heat. This is one of the most interesting beers I've ever had, just not something I'd drink all that often."
"Tastes great, much more complex than the nose. Big salami and charcoal in the front, moving into a lightly sweet big malt middle and then the nodes of smokey yellow cheese kick up, moving into perfectly spicey but light pepper. Not at all hot, just peppery. Wonderfully blaalnced. Pepper burn lingers lightly."
"Drinkability: Definatly one of the most unique beers i've ever had. Im really diggin the smokey flavors, the peppers and the heat this brew has. I would definatly reccomend this to any chile head and i can't wait to try it with some spicy foods, especially mexican/ spanish."
"This is by far the best chile beer I've had. I expected the chile flavor to dominate everything, but instead it is a pleasant addition to the balanced malt and hops. A very nice change of pace."
"D - One a night is about all I can handle. For myself this is not a session beer. Might go nice with mexican food."
"Rather enjoyed this one, think it would be a good compliment to certain foods."
"Pours a nice fizzy head that's white. The color is almost an orange-like brown. The head doesn't retain too well and and doesn't leave a full lacing behind. The smell is spicy, but smells a bit like tobacco at the same time. The taste is tobacco like as well and has the same spiciness as the smell. The spice is unmistakeable. It's about like taking a drink of watered down tobacco spit. It leaves me a little nausious. The mouthfeel was a little fizzy. Overall I will never try this style again, it makes me want to throw up."
"brew."
"Overall light and easy to drink, enjoyable beer for those who like that chipotle smoked taste."
"Drinkability: Unique, easy to drink. More a novelty then session"
"Because of its roots as an amber ale, a rich caramel malt backbone blends with the chile flavor and keeps it in check. Still, the chipotle largely dominates and leaves a mild and spicy bitterness. An easy mouthfeel makes for good drinking and along with its strong carbonation, this brew cleanses the palate and really washes down food. This can feel little rich, however, if drank by itself."
"The beer pours an amber/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. The aroma is weak, but I can smell roasted peppers and a bit of malt. It tastes like spicy roasted peppers and has a hoppy finish but it's not as spicy as I expected. The heat/spice does get stronger (and tastes better) the more of it I drink, but the spicyness isn't overwhelming at all. Mouthfeel is light, and it's oily and smooth. Drinkability is good too, it goes down easy. All in all, it's a decent beer. I'd definitely drink it again, it was a pleasant surprise because I really didn't know what to expect with this beer."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't have wanted any more of this. I would like to try it mixed with Rogue's chocolate stout, however, I've heard it's a good combination."
"good beer, but probably too weird for me to drink again under my own steam."
"Again, this is a pleasant surprise and I wouldn't mind another one about now."
"This beer pours amber with orange highlights and little head, no lacing. Smells quite smokey and roasted with a taste of well roasted peppers. To be honest I don't really like this. It is an odd flavor to me and I'm from Texas. It's not disgusting. I could still finish it, I just won't spend more money on another."
"Bottle courtesy of Adrian910ss: Poured a medium amber color ale with a nice foamy head with quite good retention. Aroma of light chilli is interesting and less prominent then expected. Taste of subtle spicy chilli is very interesting and not gross at all. Some smoky flavours are also noticeable and enjoyable with a medium hoppy finish that complements very well this beer. This beer was way better then expected and Im glad I had the chance to try this."
" An interesting offering from the ""Brewers on the Bay"". This ale would pair well with Latin or Cajun seafood dishes. Definitely drinkable, I wish there were a few more ounces in my glass."
"I didn't know what to expect coming into this beer, but it definitely wasn't bad. Not something I would revisit regularly, but worth a try at the least."
"A very interesting brew from Rogue to say the least. Brewed with quality and quite original. I really enjoy anything hot - from hot sauces to hot peppers, so I was glad to see an infusion of two of my favorite things. I'm not sure how many of these I would have in one sitting, but I enjoyed this one."
"Overall: For my first chili beer, its not bad, but still not the thing Id seek out on a regular. A good niche beer; worth a try."
"Pours a clear amber color, nice carbonation, not much of a head, some lacing throughout the drink, but not a whole lot. The nose is of sweet malts, hops, spices, and caramel. The taste is kinda smokey and sweet malts, there's a good touch of caramel in there. Medium body. Drinkable, my first Chile Beer, not a bad brew at all, would recommend."
"Poured this beer from a 22oz bomber. The color was burnt orange with a small head. The first sip tastes like a normal ale then the spice hits. I would say it has more cinnamon characteristics than chile peppers but it was very interesting and it worked well for me. This beer should be in every mexican restaurant and it is one to try."
"Speaking of pepper heads, I am one. Ironically, chipotles are my least favorite pepper even though theyre all the rage now. Ive had a couple of extreme pepper beers, and theyre nasty, nasty, nasty. This beer is not one of those. Its not great, but it is approachable."
"Dranks okay, I could having a couple with a burger, bbq or chilli. Not a huge fan of the stlye, but is better than most others I've tried"
"I love peppers, and I love beer. I even love eating peppers while Im drinking beer. But a beer whose primary (almost sole) noticeable ingredient IS peppers? No thanks. Rogue makes many good beers, and Ive enjoyed most of them, but Ill pass on this one."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber bottle with a pop-off crown and a painted label. In keeping with Rogue's custom of releasing the same beers under different labels, this example was actually called ""Rogue Mexicali Ale""."
"I think Rogue has the right level of heat here, balancing almost perfectly with the sweetness of the malts they use. The heat from the peppers is high enough that it's noticeable but not too high that it dominates the flavor profile and razes your taste buds. Not only would it pair well with Mexican food, but I also think it would do well with some good chocolate. Yes, I would like another but not too many."
"single bottle from Peace Street Market, Raleigh"
"Note: Interesting flavor, but I doubt I'll revisit this style any time soon. I am fond of hot sauce and tobasco has long since replaced ketchup on my scrambled eggs, but it doesn't seem to work well with this beer, and the aftertaste was annoying."
"It's rare that I don't care for a Rogue beer, but chile beer is far from a beer I can recommend. Maybe if drunk with a Mexican meal it would be complimentary but otherwise it's just unpleasant and funky. This beer was too acidic and the aftertaste was just plain rough. Not anything you would want to burp repetitively I can assure you. I think the adjuncts of chiles added to me feeling terrible the next day. It cannot be solely to blame due to my indiscretionary excess but it didn't help either. I might attempt this one again with Mexican cuisine but no time soon."
"This could be written off as some sort of novelty beer, but I really think the chipotle works excellently at accenting the pale ale/amber ale base. Really reminds me of a Scottish ale but with a hint of chile."
"Slainte!"
"Poured hazy amber with a normal/abundant amount of head, which formed in some large bubbles. Aroma is very malty, bready, and pleasant. Previously, I'd had another chile beer which turned me off from this category, so I was a bit reluctant to take a sip. Flavor was extremely malty on the nose, with a bit of spice on the back-end. Not great, but not awful. Although I love chiles, spicy food, and preparing and eating all the foods that go with that (salsa, guacamole, anything Mexican, spicy tomato sauces and so on, after these two experiments with chile beers, I think I'm not going to meddle with this category further in the future."
"I enjoy it."
"T - Smooth and sweet with a ncie tangy toothiness to it. The pepper and spices became very prevelant as the beer warmed up. There was some great smoky malt flavor to it. The beer had a small bite but it was there."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper amber color with a pillowy light tan head that fades into a solid sheet of lace. Nose is sweet malt and smoked peppers. Taste begins with sweet caramelized toasted malt followed by smoky charcoal and a final spicy chipotle kick. The heat is definitely noticeable but is not overpowering. Overall this brew incorporates the smoky chili pepper flavor very well. Id love to pair this with some barbequed brisket."
"Overall, a really interesting beer, and probably better than I expected. And after my tasting, the rest of the bottle went very well with my barbecue beef on sourdough."
"DA: Good scores for the style, not exactly my favorite style so it's not as easy to drink as some."
"So, I decided to pick this up after trying a homebrewed chile beer a week or so ago and enjoying it. In fact this is a beer I never thought I would try. It poured a pale amber/medium orange color into my pint glass. Smells of sweet sweet malts, and hints of smoky chipotle peppers. Taste is more of the same, a rush of sweet malts, followed by a smoky chipotle pepper taste at the end. Not really spicy, but hints of spicyness. On a 1-10 scale on spicyness i'd rate this a 0.5. Drinkability actually isnt too bad on this, a nice addition for a mexican meal, or equally a decent pre-dinner beer. Quite enjoyable and recommended to all for at the very least a try of something new and different. I probably would have ranked it higher if they had used regular habanero or serrano peppers instead of chipotle peppers. In my opinion it would have been better without the smoke taste but thats just me."
"A decent beer, and quite drinkable - the chipotle is more of an afterthought. It's more like a lightly smoked amber ale with a little extra hops."
"Eric"
"It tasted ok at first,but the aftertaste I didn't like, I felt like I was drinking it out of an old shoe.My friends also tasted it and didn't like it either. Maybe it would have tasted good with chips and salsa. This the only beer from Rogue I don't like."
"Taste- Starts with a normal red ale toasty and biscuity flavor. Then the toast turns into smoke. Pepper smoke. A nice, easy, and very palateable chipotle aroma. Very interesting mix of a traditional amber ale. with soem smokey and slighlkty spicey peppers."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with a burst of carbonation in each sip. Goes down quite easily and I really enjoy the mix of smoky pepper flavor alongside the nice maltiness of this brew. Probably the best chili beer I've sampled yet. Doubt I could have more than a few in a sitting, but this is still a nice change of pace. I'd say to give this one a try!"
"Overall, the roasted habanero taste is subdued enough for this ale to be enjoyable, but is otherwise fairly boring tastewise."
"I have to say I was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews here then actually drinking one of these. I was expecting to have something that would either be pretty vile or pretty dang tasty to me since I do like chilis and spicy food. Well I did not get either really. It pours a nice yellow with a bit of a red hue and a slightly white head that laces pretty quickly. The smell to me was a bit like fermented fruit with just a hint of smokiness in the background. The taste was what kind of let me down but not in a horrible way. It ended being so average to me, I was expecting to either be wowed or just grossed out by something that tasted too much like peppers. I don't know maybe I'm crazy but it just tasted like a very average thin ale with just a tiny hint of smokiness in the background. The immediate aftertaste is just the smokiness but after a while if you let it sit on your tongue I get a hint of burnt chili seeds. It was not too bad for me getting through the one bomber but I gave it a 2.5 on drinkability because I could definately imagine it turning off alot of people and just left me pretty unimpressed either way. Not horrible or anything but I don't think I would buy another one. I cracked open a Stone Pale Ale after drinking this one and that just tasted soooo good after drinking this stuff."
"Drinkability: This would be a fun novelty in a 12 oz. bottle; in a bomber, it is a tough beer to finish"
"Well I was a little amazed that someone would actually combine hot peppers and beer but i was very happy with the outcome. Poured a deep amber color with the smell of a little pepper. Didnt taste so much like pepper but more like a smokey bbq. Almost as if you were drinking the smoke off of a grill is the only way i can compare it. Definetly worth a try once."
"I felt like I was eating some medium wings."
"The first sip is cool. The second sip you start noticing its weaknesses. By the fifth sip I'm not sure I can make it through this bomber-size bottle. Maybe they should sell this in 6 oz. bottles. A novelty beer, a novelty bottle. Glad to have had it, and I still don't agree with the ultra-purist beer drinker referenced above...but no doubt, neither one of us are big fans of this particular experiment."
"Overall this is an interesting drinking experience, though I cannot imagine desiring much more than one glass at a sitting, and even that one glass proved a bit challenging to finish off at the end. The pepper character strikes me as somewhat of a novelty, and I would just prefer a strong hop character every time."
"Overall, this might be a gimmick, but it seems to work, for about the first 1/2 of the bottle at least. Best split with someone else, or paired with very spicy food."
"I was kind of disappointed. When I see chipotle ale, I expect a little bit more spice. This is nothing for me. If it were a salsa it would be between medium. If you like that then try it."
"taste is a very interesting mix. matly, is the 1st thing i get. then there is the rest, and the rest is very much a nice change of pace. no real hop presence, but the peppers are there. not in a burn your mouth sense, but more of a pep, a kick, that show up when you least expect it. makes for a very intersting mix, and i recomend you try it if you can. Slighty chew mouthfeel, and surprisingly drinkable. nice brew to get!"
"D: A pretty decent beer, but not one I'm thrilled with. Definitely an unusual experience and worth trrying, but I can't see myself drinking this on a regular basis, or even an occassional basis."
"JC, Grand Rapids, MI"
"I don't understand how this one left the brewery. Maybe it's the ultimate in acquired taste, but I poured half of the bomber down the sink...such a pity."
"Slightly amber with moderate white head that gives some lace in my pilsner glass. Smell is peppery spice with malt backing it up and even a touch of smoke(?). The taste is a very refined and contained chile flavor the plays well with the malt and remains it the dry finish of the beer. I dug this beer and it went well with my pull beef sandwich. Drinking this by itself might be much for me but I think this beer shines when paired with food or split in a day of drinking."
"Oh wow. I was really impressed with this one, not knowing what to expect, really. It poured a bit darker than I was thinking it would. Slightly cloudy medium bronze orange colour with a slightly off-white head that went away pretty quickly. Smell is mostly sweet malts and smoke. Taste is more of the same, with very little hot pepper presence. Only a very slight tingle, and that's kind of hit or miss. Sometimes it's present, and sometimes not. Actually, there is a slight heat that's noticeable many seconds after you swallow your sip. Quite smooth and drinkable. Very impressive, for what it is. I'd definately buy this again. Nice job, Rogue."
"Very smooth and sweet upfront, followed by a drying bitter aspect from the hops. 	Some heat sneaks in towards the end, but not nearly what I was expecting from one of my favorite peppers. No pepper qualities whatsoever in the flavor, which is somewhat of a letdown."
"Cheers!"
"Pours an orangish red with an off white head that leave lacing. The smell is very smoky with some spicy notes. The taste is smoky up front (not as much as Rogue's smoked ale) with a dry finish that leaves the spice of the chipotle lingering in your mouth. This is a meduim bodied brew with a good mouthfeel and balance. The taste is not very overpowering and is easy to drink. I cannot see myself drinking more than a couple of these, I would suggest drinking these along with a nice BBQ, or the flavor could get old. A very interesting brew, done very well. This is worth checking out especially if you like Rogue's smoked ale."
"Overall, an excellent beer and a testament to craft brewers' innovation."
"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I picked it up out of the curiosity of possibly using chipotle in my own homebrew and wanted to see how the pros at Rogue managed. I was immediately struck by the sweet hot smokey smell of chipotle chiles. It was a carbon copy of opening a bag of actual chipotle chiles. Having heard horror stories of other chile beers, I was a little worried. I poured the beer, a burnt umber, into a pint glass with no head. Carbonation was there, just not in the form of any amount of head. In fact, it tickled my tonge with the carbonation and the lack of head did not help the mouthfeel. The real surprise came in the first sip. Absolutely a chipotle beer. I could taste smoky jalapenos, complete with spicy aftertaste. I even noted a bit of a hop presence. But the more notable offsetting flavor was a carmel sweetness in the malts. It balanced the spicy-smoky chipotle nicely. I had a hard time drinking a lot of this at once due to the spiciness--I felt like too much of it would give me heartburn. Therefore, I spaced it out over a period of grilling veggies, eating dinner, and cleaning up. It actually went fantastically with my grilled veggie sandwich. I marinated some portabellos, zuccini, and red pepper in olive oil and balsamic vinegar and grilled them. I toasted the bread and spread hummos on both sides. The result matched the chipotle ale perfectly. Meaty portabellos worked with the smoky beer. Tangy hummos offset the spiciness. The sweet red peppers picked up the sweetness in the malts. The zuccini... well fortunatly there was not a vegetable taste in the beer, so that was just extra. I probably would not buy another one of these unless matching it with food. Chipotle beer with veggies, who would have thought?"
"D: Interesting beer, would go very good with a good cheese."
"Drinkability- Very nice, I like it much more than I thought I would. The pepper is definitely noticable yet not enough to put me off of the brew. I'll buy it again."
"Taste is a biscuity malt. You can even taste some hops. The pepper flavor is light enough to just balance with the malt. Jalepeno spice almost acts as the hops in this beer. Mouth is long and sticky. Not a bad invention."
"Sort of a novelty rauchbier, but it's honestly exactly what it claims to be. It is a Chipoltle flavored ale. Nothing more and nothing less. It might be interesting if they could offer this beer with varying heat levels like salsa (mild, medium, etc), but beyond pretty good, although I can't see myself ever buying this again except for it's novelty."
"This was a pretty good-looking beer, cloudy amber with a medium- sized head. Aroma was Ale-like, with some pepper spiciness. I honestly cannot tell whether it was chipotle or some other pepper. Taste was hoppy with some warming spiciness. Fairly thin mouthfeel. I think this is a beer one would try as a curiosity."
"Pours a cloudy brown with a distinctly orange hue and a thick light tan head that lasts reasonably well and leaves a little lacing. Aroma is smoky, with a dark fruitiness and just a hint of hot peppers. Taste is once again dominated by a smoky note, which I've never been fond of. It's probably because, being from an Atlantic province, it's a smell and taste indelibly associated with fish for me. At any rate, other flavours include breads and plum, and the finish is dominated by the heat of the peppers, which try valiantly to save this beer for me, but ultimately come up short. Not bad in it's way, but not up my alley at all."
"The aroma smells a bit spicyand somewhat smoky, a little like a taco salsa. It also smells like a typical ale until you get further down the glass. The taste is pretty hoppy and blended well with some malts. It is followed by a definite hot spiciness along with more hop bitterness. It leaves a spicy taste on the back of the tongue, just like a mild salsa. The spiciness is actually warming. This is definitely different, but, not one I could drink more than one of."
"I remember having this beer several years ago at Rogue's brewery, before I'd ever had smoked beers. I thought it was awful. Having expanded my palate, I'd say this is a fine beer. It's not as smoky as Rogue's Smoke ale and far less smoky than rauchbiers, but if you like a tiny bit of chile spice, you should give this beer a try."
"Quite different, I must say...but I don't try a lot of ""hot pepper"" beers, so that's probably to be expected. An interesting brew that would be a great, unique one to pair with Mexican food."
"M/D- The ale is medium bodied, medium to low carbonation...It is an interesting beer, and as I sit here with it I can really appreciate it, but it is definitely not something that I would drink very often. I has taken me a really long time to finish this bomber....its a slow drinker."
"Nice head that didn't hang around leaving ok lacing. A smokey nose. A HUGE smokey flavor with the slight bite coming through at the end. I expected a heavier mouthfeel and I thought it was a little on the thin side. Overall a really interesting beer and I recommend that you try it. I couldn't finish what I had been given - I found the taste too overwhelming to drink a pint of it but i liked it. I am thinking of using it in recipes, maybe in my Beer Cheese soup, or maybe in place of a stout in gravy."
"Overall, this is wonderfully balanced...a wonderful brewing feat when it would be oh so easy to screw a beer like this up. This is one of those beers that sounds like a bad idea but turns out wonderfully, which is true to Rogue brewing history. Actually very easy to drink, but a bomber is going to be enough for me. I would get this again for sure, and would recommend you try it if you're looking for something different."
"In the end there's definitely chiles, yes, but it's also leathery as well, I haven't come across that sort of flavour since a few Fish Tales beers I had sampled before. A mighty fine ale all things considered, they did an excellent job, the craftsmanship is there, but when all is said and done it's not my cup of tea (or other brewed beverage). A sipping beer, definitely, and would go great paired with red meat off the grill, or really with anything that involves salsa. I'd save this stuff more for autumn and winter days as well, NOT something I'd grab to quench on a hot day."
"The Rogue Chipolte Ale is a very interesting brew, containing smoke and fire. This pours an amber color with a nice, though short lasting, head. The smell is smokey, with malts and hops barely poking through. The taste is smokey and then there is a nice follow up of spice. This is a fun brew. I can foresee enjoying this with just about any spicey tex-mex dish: It would fit in nicely. Drinkability is isa bit limited, at least for me, to a bomber per sitting (plus I would only enjoy this on occassion). Don't be afraid, it is different but good!"
"This beer pours a rusty amber color with a nice sized white head that holds and laces nicely. It smells malty with a strong smoky and spicy aroma. Overall it has a strong smoked chili flavor balanced nicely with malts and hops. It also has a good mouthfeel, nicely thick with a good amount of carbonation. Overall it is drinkable, but all night, its a pretty intense flavor"
"I will have this again, Cheers!"
"M / D - This is a medium bodied beer that looks great. I found that although I like spicy foods and chipolte in food and sauces, this one was a bit too far down the smoked pepper trail for me. I didn't quite make it through half the bottle. I think it's worth an experience just to taste the blend of smoke and pepper but for me a 12oz bottle would be plenty at a sitting."
"Like the other Rogue beers I have sampled, this looks very good in the glass, with a rich amber/maple syrup colour and a cream-coloured head that is tight and left good lacing. Really lovely colour, straddling that wonderful hue between ruby red and rosewood brown. The chipotle peppers are definitely there as I first smell above the glass, which almost seem to emulate hops in their aroma. This smells almost tequila-like at times. Definitely spicy, with good full authentic chipotle notes, along with nice caramel malt and fairly assertive hopping. Actually very balanced with just enough of the Chipotle. Even without the peppers, this would be a fine pale ale. It really does remind me of some Chipotle dishes I have had, dry and a little astringent. Malting adds some caramel and light raisins and cream and bread. Taste showcases the peppers very expertly, with a very good balance here: it starts with dark malts and then in the middle really lets the pepper shine through, and by the finish you get that spicy tang that burns the lips and tongue a bit, as if you have just eaten a Chipotle pepper. Everything just...works somehow. The taste on the middle of the tongue is fantastic, and the aftertaste leaves a dry peppery feeling. I have to rate it high, not so much because I find it overly tasty, but because of the way they mixed the peppers with the beer. Fantastic execution. It seems to warm the throat and belly in a that way only peppers do. The taste is not extremely complex beyond the light roasty malting and the peppers, but the finish does leave some nice hoppy bitterness as well. Wow, this was pulled off very well. Good moderaly carbonated mouthfeel, and full bodied. A piquant beer, but also relatively drinkable. The pepper is never over-the-top, but neither is this a case of searching for some hidden flavour that leaves you wondering if this was just a misnamed pale ale. An admirable beer, and I was rather impressed. Would be fun to pair with Mexican or Indian dishes. This could stand up to repeated drinking too--not just a novelty one-time ""glad I tried it"" beer."
"This didn't pair very well with the Chile Con Queso I had, except the spices. It kept my mouth ablaze which I love, but the smoked flavor was dominating too much. might go better with a meat dish of some sort, but I would never know... Alone, it's a very interesting and tasty offering, unique and worth a try once in awhile, just not very drinkable in quantities."
"This is a wierd brew. The beer poured with little head and it is the color of sweet tea. The smell is not too bad, similar to a light beer with some spices. The taste is hard to describe. It starts out as a dull spiced taste. Then it turns into a lasting bittersweetness with small hints of peppers. The mouthfeel is not too bad. There is no harshness, just the weird lingering aftertaste. This is not a beer I would try again. Probably not too bad when reveiwed within the style but I don't think I will try this style again either."
"Poured into a tumbler as recommended, this beer looked to be somewhere between light brown and orange in color, and had a smallish foamy head. While it looked pretty good, it did not exude much smell at all. I could detect a faint smokiness but nothing else. When consumed, the beer clearly oozed the mild smoky taste of Chipotle peppers. This was balanced well by the sweet fruitiness of the caramel malt and some well chosen citric hops from the Pacific Northwest. Pretty similar in flavor to chasing Mexican food down with an American Pale Ale which happens to be a pretty good beer and food pairing combination in my opinion. The flavors worked well together and the aftertaste was densely smoky. Quite juicy and medium thick on the palette, this would work splendidly well as an aperitif. Overall, a much better beer than I was thinking it was going to be."
"frankly, i didn't expect a chili beer to be so balanced."
"I would never drink this as a daily. Weekly is out of the question, and yearly?....yeah maybe. Not for me fellas....I'm convinced this will sell well with certain demo's but it misses me alltogether."
"Pours an amber color with plumes of frothy, bubbly head, gorgeous. Very earthy smelling, not so much smokey, but the chilies are present. C hops and malt provide a nice backbone, this is some interesting stuff. Flavors are, at first very typical amber ale like, then the smokey chili flavors dominate. This is close to a smoked beer, but it has more of the chipotle flavor to it, not a smoked malt flavor. A little spiciness lingers in the mouth, this would be perfect with chocolate. Overall, I have to say this beer met my expectation of both weird and delicious. The bomber is certainly drinkable, but beyond that forget it, I'll grab an IPA fast over this. Well done."
"Cheers!"
"Pours an intense crimson-amber with a nice beige head. The aroma is mostly malty with toasted bread and caramel, some spicy and floral hops and a mild, smokey pepper scent. The flavor is subtle but complex, with some toasted bread and biscuit, spicy and floral hops, and complex smokeiness, as well as roasted chipotle pepper...very nice. The mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is good. A very nice chile beer, complex and tasty."
"I'm not sure how typical this beer is for the style. While I was expecting a crisp, spicy pale ale, I was pleasantly surprised by the smoky, roasted taste."
"Overall: I liked this beer better than the Jalapeño Sunsplash that I had at the Extreme Beer Fest. The base beer was nicer, though in the end the smokiness was too much, and the spiciness could have been raised."
"It actually pairs quite well, the smokiness is subdued by the red chile broth, but still retains its complexity, and it remains an almost quenching retreat from the heat of the dish. In fact I would say that where this beer really excels is in its pairing with spicy Mexican food. I'll certainly try it with all sorts of dishes."
"Rogues Chipotle Ale is interesting. The chipotle can be overpowering but if you are a lover of peppers, then this is a winner. This beer is not my favorite offering from Rogue, but they do have many more beers to offer. Mediocre in my book."
"Pours a nice amber color with a one finger off white head. Smells of sweet malt, I can't pick up any spices, but nonetheless a pleasant smell. It has a very subtle spice with a malty sweetness, leaves a spicy warmness. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost no carbonation. It is a pretty drinkable beer, after my first glass I started to feel the spice. I probably wouldn't drink more than one, but I had a 25oz bottle so I didn't have much choice. I will say that I was hoping for something with a little more spice, this is a very subtle."
"The first thing my wife and I both thought was how to pair this with food as this seems a good choice for a broad range of meals. It's not an everyday beer nor is this a big beer (especially served as we did it right after the Imperial IPA. What were we thinking?) but a solid experience and one I wouldn't mind to repeat. Try it if you're curious. It's not THAT out there."
"Very drinkable. I liken it to a rauchbier as well. Very similar in taste, aroma and mouthfeel. It's easier to drink too. I will go back for more."
"This has a nice dark copper color with an off-white head. The smell is very nice, sweet with a bit of chocolate. The taste is very good. It is sweet, spicy and smokey. Almost like a Scottish Ale. The finish is dry and bitter, but not a typical hop bitterness. The smoke flavor is noticeable but not overbearing. My mouth kind of feels like I was drinking a good beer and smoking a good cigar. Mouthfeel is nice and full, very smooth. And the drinkability is good."
"A drinkable, fun brew to behold if in the mood for something out of the ordinary. Perfectly spiced and smokey for this Northern boys' buds."
"A cool concept for beer, but it just didn't really taste much like peppers or have any kick to it at all."
"A very thin and quiet brew, the peppers are the whole story here. Its just not a brew to savor, its more of a hurry up and finish it frosty. I think you really need to be working on some BBQ to fully enjoy it."
"There are probably others like me who fear spending the 4.50 on a bottle of chipolte ale after trying something like cave creek, but I highly recommend this beer. Rogue is a great brewer and they have made a winner with this beer. The peppers compliment the rest of the beer well and it's a nice change from your average beer. I recommend it and will certianly be picking this up again. Maybe in just a few minutes..."
"D: Good for a reminder of the summer to come or for a summer evening outdoors. Including peppers works well in this case and Rogue deserves credit for trying this out and succeeding with it. The spiciness in beer is interesting and quite enjoyable."
"I'm actually really glad I tried this one - I admittedly just wanted it for the bottle. I think Rogue managed to do a pepper beer the right way."
"This stuff is awesome. I wish I could have one of these every time I have mexican food."
"Drinkability - there aren't many pepper beers to contend with, but this is my favorite one. Great grill-food beer."
"Had this unusual beer at the Rogue Fest in December 2005 at Summits Wayside Tavern in Sandy Springs, GA. They somehow have close ties with Rogue Brewery and get unusual kegs. I was skeptical about this one and avoided it on a few trips. I do love chipotle sauce and beer but didnt know about combining them. Poured like standard ale, a clear golden amber with a little bit of quickly disappearing head. The smell is of beer and yep chipotle sauce! Smells pleasant like a backyard BBQ. The mouthfeel was a little flat. The taste was OK, mildly hoppy ale with a heavy chipotle finish. It grew on me a bit as I drank it but cant say I would have another. Its a novelty though. Glad I tried it."
"A clean dark amber beer with orange hightlights. Has a big foamy off white head. Aroma ... OK smoked chille peppers and just a hint of sweet malt in the background, but mostly smoked chille peppers. Taste ... Ok this has got to be on of the best tasteing ""chile"" beers I hav had yet. A great smooth smoky character at first then a little malty sweetness with a spicey hop finish and then in true Chipolte fashion a slow building pepper burn. YUM"
"A medium body with very light heat from the peppers, barley noticeable to a capsaicin addict like me. Not overly hoppy for a Rogue either. I'd say it's safe for the masses to try, not to spicy, not to hoppy, not too much of anything really. I expected more though."
"D - I appreciated the smoke and pepper where nicely integrated with the rest of the beer, unlike so many rauch beers and pepper beers. That being said, it was only an average beer."
" Interesting stuff. Not for everyday drinking but still, a nice solid ale with a touch of hot peppers..ooh, let me go get some pepper jack, sweeeet.. Do you like peppers? If so, you'll probably like this."
"Slàinte!"
"This is a very different kind of beer for me and though I ""feel"" that this must be one of the better examples of the style, I have to think the style is not for me. Try it and find out for yourself. ;^)"
"Moderate mouth that could use a bit more carbonation. My only regret is that I didn't pair this with chicken fajitas or jalepeno jack. Next time."
"This brew pours a murky amber color. The head is nonexistant, and there is no lacing. The aroma is very sweet with peppers in the background. The taste is mildy sweet with chile peppers mildly coming through in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this brew is a lot more drinkable than I had thought it would be. I am glad that it is rather mellow, and certainly not in my face."
"I just noticed that it was a spring seasonal so I'll have to try this again when it is fresh. I bet the chipotle will be much more noticeable. It still holds up as a decent ale with a very subtle pepper flavor."
"Notes: Interesting and worth a try, but not worth repeating."
"I really wasn't sure what to expect from a chile beer after Cave Creek ruined my sense of adventure in that direction for quite some time, but what stands out is how real the pepper becomes as you drink. It's a pretty wild diversion, the way it presents something new and unusual to the palate. It is reasonably drinkable, but that's mitigated by the character that gives it an almost novelty status. It's not destined to become a favorite, but it does go to show that most things in life are worth trying at least one time."
"This is my first chile beer. It is probably a good example of the style but I don't care for it much. Amber red color. No head or carbonation. Some mild lacing on the sides of the glass. Up front, it smells and tastes like a nice malty ale but the chile aftertaste and finish is just too overwhelming. Its disappointing because it seems like it would be better if it was a little milder on the chiles. I had to try this novelty beer. I will not buy another one."
"Drinkability: Fun to drink. The flavor makes it something that shouldn't be chugged, but it won't weigh you down or overwhelm you."
"My first encounter with a 'chile beer', and I have to say that I actually enjoyed it. Maybe it's because it's by a quality brewer, but this one did not scare me away from the style completely."
"A very astringent mouthfeel makes this beer tough to finish. Overall, very unimpressed. Definitely needs more pepper or jalapeno flavor and maybe more malts to balance out that spicy pepper flavor."
"Perhaps I don't understand the style but this beer really didn't take to me. Thick dense head on top of a dark amber crystaline body. Smelled lightly of peppers and timber ash, pleasant on the cool evening. It tastes vaguely of chili paste or spoiled almonds (kinda a numbing sensation). Left no discernable aftertaste but was hard enough to take down. Felt about right but not drinkable as it's taste was a bit too chili for me."
"Chile beer tends to be polarizing. Looking at some of the scores, Chipotle Ale is no different. On this one, however, I find myself gravitating toward some middle ground. I think I want more of a chipotle presence, but I'm not sure if I'd like the beer that I'm suggesting they brew. If anyone out there is worried about overwhelming roasted pepper flavor and mouth numbing heat, don't be. This is a relatively tame chile beer and, in the end, is an enjoyable one."
"No freshness date. Litle head and nice brownred foggy beer. Nose is good giving good C-hops, good full maltyness and and overal fresh and fruity nose. Taste is dry, full malty, citrussy before bitterness and the chile take overal. Something new to me but certainly not bad. After drinking longer this hanging chile taste comes in your mouth giving it an extra dimention in moutfeel that misses IMO some body. Good brew though that's easy drinkable and certainly something else."
"This thing tastes like biting into a hickory twig! In a good way.I has a very obvious smoke flavor that's kind of shocking at first, but after a few seconds I started to realize how good it was. Smooth and delicious, and it tastes like smoke. This beer would be absolutely perfect with a steak, or sitting around the campfire. I really like this and will buy again. Price was a little steep though. It tastes like beer and chipotle should but it's missing the spice, it shows up just as I'm finishing the bottle, and I don't even drink fast. You've got to take into acount that alcohol numbs your taste buds to capsacian, and that I like Thai food. I hadn't tasted any spice throughout the whole bottle and even forgot there was supposed to be any, and when it showed up I was like ""oh, right!"""
"This has a nice dark amber color,but the head was a little small,one finger,than other Rogues.The smell is a very earthy,with a little spice.The taste is very different.I don't think I've ever tasted a beer so smokey.You can really taste the chipolte,it has a slight bite on the sides of my tongue.This has a somewhat light/medium feel,pretty drinkable.This isn't Rogues best ale,but I admire them for trying different things.I would try this again."
"This lightly spicy, heavily smoky beer makes a unique session brew. With not too much spiciness it is suprisingly drinkable, rather than a novelty, and the smoky chipotles give it enough of a unique kick to keep it interesting all night. There is a certain medicinal quality to the smoky flavor that is noticable in the odor and taste, and it is a little too overpowering to make this a perfect beer."
"It's a medium bodied beer that boasts of a nice crispness without a overly filling mouthfeel and a seemingly low alcohol content (I couldn't find the ABV for this one anywhere), which combined with the taste make it a pretty drinkable ale. A good beer for this category, and I would return to it if the moment or the desire strikes."
"There's a small, cream-colored, sticky, still head. The beer is a clear, rusty copper. Swoopy lacing. Nose is smoky! with a little fruit and a touch of chocolatey malt. Smoky, milky front leads to a big, milky, malty, sweetish, thick middle. The finish is lightly spicy, smoky, nutty and bitter. Some nice citrusy hops poke through. Wow. Very tasty: a meal in a bottle. Quite smoky and milky. Only subtly spicy, with enough malt spine to support it. Really, really tasty."
"Light to medium in body. Smooth and mildly crisp at the start, and finishes smooth and smokey. I sampled and reviewed this before my meal, and then during my meal of spicy tacos and refried beans. The drinkability alone is very average, and with some spicy food was also average. This may pair a little better with some spicy BBQ ribs because of the soft smokiness."
"22 oz bottle pours a cloudy bright amber color with a small creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Smoke aroma, hot peppers followed by smoke and wood flavors, I can feel the heat after the first sip. Medium bodied with a creamy smooth mouthfeel, has a lasting spicy pepper finish."
"Mouthfeel is medium and clean, easy to drink. The chiles lend a nice earthiness but it would be hard to characterize this alongside other chile beers. A good choice with the chipotles but you could double or triple the amount (chipotles are among the mildest peppers) and get a much better beer."
"oh man this beer is awsome .not the killer hops like most of the rougs ive tried but no matter. pours a nice deep ruby color. ON first smell i dont really smell to much spice, but its there. malty goodness. theres some pretty good lacing in the glass but then its rogue so.... you really know there are peppers in here after you have drank the beer you can feel that tingling sensation on the tip of your tounge like you just ate some spicy food.a+++ great beer"
"These beers are always an exciting, yet apprehensive experiment; both for the brewers and the drinkers. Bright copper colored with some distinguishable amber highlights. Quite carbonated with a dainty head that fades quick. Lacing is impressive though. The aromas are somewhat of a bloody mary, with the spiciness, pepperyness, and vegetable characters. Tastes is similar as well; throw in sweet barley malt, earthy hops, smoked vegetables, and clean ale yeast. Mild barley sweetness and celery-like vegetables up front, then chile and hop spiciness hit in the body. Chile heat is assertive, but not over kill. The beer tapers into a dry chile vegetable flavor. Not bad, i've had worse."
"Drinkable as all hell! To me THIS is the ultimate Barbecue or Tex-Mex beer. Or I would drink it anytime; I am a major Chilie Head."
"neat, cool, a beer with chipotle peppers in it. i won't be racing to track another down"
"This beer struck me as having a somewhat oily, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Good carbonation. The beer was semi-low on the drinkability scale for me only because this beer is not my bag. A 12oz. sample would have sufficed for me. Very unique and worth a try."
"Thanks to Andrea for this gift. Smack!"
"Opinion: This is an interesting beer. It is clean, and well made to showcase the spice addition. I am not sure at what point the Chipotle peppers were added to the mix, but it would be nice if they were more present in the aroma...and added more fresh flavor."
" About half way through this beer I got some relief as warming peppers finally overwhelmed the impression that I was drinking beer out of a box of Band-Aids. Not what I expected from Rogue a lot more drinkabe than Cave Creek's but the flavors don't meld and like Crazy Ed's it seems to only be a novelty brew."
"Drinkability- The only time I would have this again is with maybe with some mexican food. This would probably be an excellent pairing. Not my kinda style, but blows away Crazy Ed's by about a million-fold."
"Smooth, fairly easy to drink with the heat almost like an afterthought that lingers on pleasantly. This should be a great accompniement to Tex-Mex or southwestern cuisine. The chipotle is mild enough to complement spicy food rather than compete with it. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall Impression: A good smoked beer. Not really a pepper beer in my mind, just a sweet smoky great beer. I get tingles of heat in my lips and in my chest, the heat is at a great level where its felt, but doesnt hurt."
"Purchased 7/9/05 at Made in Oregon shop in Portland International Airport. I was expecting something like Cave Creek a pilsner lager with a chili taste. First pour reveals something much darker burnt orange in color. Little or no head retention. Smell is of caramel malts and a slightly smokey aroma. First sip reveals more a rauchbier flavor. Slight bitterness. A slight hint of heat on the tongue but very slight. More bitterness than a rauchbier. Like a rauchbier on hops. Not as exotic I would have thought based on the ingredients."
"Pours a clear medium amber with a 1 finger head and good lacing. I don't get too much nose on this one but I do get some smoke and malt aromas. Taste is similar in start to their smoked ale but you don't get the ""ham"" flavor instead it is of very mild pepper, not spicy at all. Very nicely balanced between malt, hops and smokiness. A very nice example of the style. The complete opposite of cave creek. (ick,yuk)"
"typical Rogue bomber, pours rich orangy amber, fairly cloudy, slight tan head, leaves moderate lacing, Nose is fairly mild, I get hints of smoke, red peppers and malty sweetness. Medium bodied, lots of smoke, red pepper and a mild jalapeno note. Not overpowering, but the pepper/chili thing is present. Nicely balanced by malt sweetness. Not for everybody, but Pepper heads will love it, great selection for tex-mex type food."
"Drinkability: Very good, very tasty and original. It'[s smooth and well done. I really like the roasted pepper taste in here."
"D- This is a very pleasant chile beer. I'm quite surprised who good it is. I thought all chile beers had to involve pain but this one is all pleasure."
"As a fan of spicey food, I was really looking forward to this, my first chipotle beer. Pours a nice dark amber with a thin white head that fades away pretty fast. Nose is pretty much like a normal ale---caramel malts, floral hoppiness, and just a hint of smokiness. First taste is full of smokey chipotle flavor, very tasty, not at all burning, and integrating well with the malty backbone of the beer. After a few sips a spicey heat can be felt on the tongue between sips, and this spiciness builds throughout. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. I had this beer with some nachos, cheese, and salsa, and it really provided an excellent match to the food. However, due to the one-dimensional spiciness of this beer, I'm not sure I'd ever drink this by itself. I had doubts about how good this style of beer could be, but as usual Rogue puts out an exemplary product."
"At least he let me get something else."
"My first chili ale, I assumed this would be an interesting concoction. The color is a hazy copper with good carbonation and creamy head. The aroma consists of a mild malty sweetness joined by a stronger element of the spicy and somewhat smokey chipotle. The taste is very interesting and complex. A sip starts with a standard mild malt flavor, but is soon joined by spiciness and mild smokiness. Moderately citrusy hops provide a nice bite. You can definently tastes the peppers, but the flavor isn't overwelmingly spicy. The highlight of this brew is the interplay between the malts and the chipotle towards the middle of a sip. A crisp mouthfeel is also welcomed. Despite enjoying the interesting flavor of this beer, I did get a little tired of the chili flavor by the end of my 22 oz. bottle. Only one of these every now and then would suit me fine."
"It seems like it probably loses something due to simplicity, and on it's own it's a bit eh, but it would certainly hold it's own as a tex-mex wash."
"Fairly drinkable brew. I had it with some Chipotle burrito and was set for the night. I really don't think I'll have it again though."
"A really weird beer, but something strangely enjoyable. Pours a light brownish orange with no real head. A slight bit of pepper in the nose, but not a whole lot else going on. The taste is very satisfying, with a malty sweetness up front but a WHOLE lot of peppery spiciness in the back of the tongue. It really hits the roof of your mouth, this dry, smoky hotness. A real refreshing and smooth beer, but with a limited drinkability."
"First, let me state that Im not a hot pepper fan but the chipotles light involvement is just about right for my taste. I cant say that Ill return to this category of beers based on my general respect for my taste buds but it certainly was worth a look."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with spicey red chile edge. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that boasts of crystal and roasted malts along with a very spicey chipotle pepper taste. I love these kind of beers. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer considering it's a pepper beer. Rogue seems to be able to get it done no matter what style it is."
"This is medium bodied with a hearty, almost chewy mouthfeel and tiny trickling carbonation that is a perfect delivery vehicle for the subtle heat of the chipotles. This would be awesome with some smoked pulled pork."
"I guess going into this, I was assuming I was going to get something that really pronounced the peppers, I guess leaving things set back a bit is just nicer. For what it is, it's well done, just seems a bit bland to me."
"One of my favorites from rogue."
"This ale would go so well with so many summer foods, it's amazing."
"It is my understanding that this is the same as their Mexicali Ale, makes sense I guess. The beer disembarks the 22-ounce brown bottle a deep copper color with a modest frothy light tan head and the residual lace forms a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is, as one would expect, a bit peppery, lime like in its crispness, sweet with malt and the start somewhat sweet with a nice grain profile, the top is light to medium in feel. Finish is moderate in acidity and the hops pleasantly spicy as is the peppery dry aftertaste, a drinkable beer, but as with the Juniper, not one of Rogues better beers."
"Mouthfeel is about medium. Drinkability is average can understand wanting to try this I did but wouldn't want another. Next time they might try adding more peppers, worst Rouge I have had to date."
"Pours an amber color with a small head that falls fast but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly malty and smoky with a Tabasco thing. The flavor is very mild with the pepper. Lots of smoky flavors and only a slight bit of Chipotle spice. Interesting. Not really my kind of thing, but it's good to try something different."
"Drinkability: Would be good with an angus burger."
"Nice drinkable ale with a nice extra ""kick"" in the end."
"Comments - Obviously, this beer would be fun to pair with spicy food for a double whammy. Spicy food lovers take note: this beer is the greatest thing that ever happened anywhere! I could drink this stuff all night. I think I just found a new favorite beer."
"this would definately be something id drink with a porterhouse steak right off the barbie, or with some quality mexican food. i couldnt drink it all the time, but every so often i would find myself needing a drop of this beer. if only for the fact that its a unique sensory experience in the world of beer drinking. you wont find too many chili beers that are as tasty, interesting and even handed as this. very good drop!"
"Carbonation is light. Mouthfeel is full, but I wouldnt quite describe it as earthy or chewy. This beer really surprised me- I was expecting a rather unique, novelty brew- much to the contrary, I have discovered a sweet and smoky beer with an unexpectedly high drinkability. Good with ribs?"
"Drinkability  This is a very drinkable, beer that is not as exciting or chili flavored as I had hoped. Its hard to judge this not having had a chili beer before, it loses points for not having too much chili flavor. It is a good beer that I could see drinking with a variety of foods, but the flavor makes this much more than just a novelty."
"This one poured a dark amber with hints of red throughout. A very light brown, somewhat tan head formed that held on for a bit, then fell to a film leaving some lacing. The smell was of some smoke, lightly roasted malts, chili peppers and some hops. The taste was sweetish and malty at the front, with some hops at the finish and only a faint showing of smoked peppers, very disappointing. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth and medium bodied, nothing to write home about. I would have to say that 22oz. was a bit too much of this. I was hoping for a smoke filled, fire breathing trip through Hell, but I did't get it. Oh well, better luck next time."
"Overall: Tastes like a run-of-the-mill smoked beer to me, and a rather unbalanced one at that. Sadly, only the merest hint of Chipotle Pepper in the back end here. I love spicy food and peppers, but Im glad I only got one of these. More Smoked than Chipotle, which was a disappointment, nevertheless its not a bad brew.its just not for me though."
"Thanks to Chris for sharing this with me. It pours a deep amber color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is slightly chile spicey, with a slight grainey sweet background. The chile is not all that strong, but it is well in the front of the brew. The flavor is not all that bad. There is a smokeyness that hits initially. The chile kicks in but not all that bed. No burning at all. Just nice roasted chile character. I would like to have this beer with some Mexican food. No real heat, just a slight spice in my stomach. I like it. The feel is moderate with a nice healthy carb. Overall, this is drinkable for a chile brew. The flavors are nicely balanced, the feel is good, the nose is nice. I think if you review this to style, it should be top dog. I take my hat off to Rogue for this brew. Very nice."
"22oz. bomber poured into a snifter. It pours a deep amber color with one finger of head. Almost no lacing. The smell is weird. It's malty, a little hoppy, and has a smoky aroma to it. It's not bad at all! The taste is fairly malty up front, but then the smoky peppers come in. They don't hit you hard, or are overpowering, but just subtle. Not too shabby. Slightly hoppy on the finish. The mouthfeel is decent, and the drinkability is just a little harsh. Fairly decent, thanks Chris!"
"Pours a clear, amber hue, with a white head, that holds for a few minutes and falls to a single layer of bubbles. Chipotle smokiness is present in the mostly malty aroma. A pretty standard amber ale, with caramel malt flavors and spicy hops. A bit papery in the middle; oxidized perhaps, or maybe just the effect of adding chiles to the beer. With a fairly bitter finish. Just a touch of Chipotle flavor and a just a hint of heat in the finish. I expected a little more heat and a little more smokiness. Would probably go well with some Mexican food, but on its own the chile flavor is a bit odd."
"The pepper flavor along with the chalky finish limits the drinkability."
"All-in-all a nice one-off beer, but nothing I could do for a session...but I sure wish I had some more almonds..."
"This beer pours into the pint glass a dark orange with a big bubble head that drops down to a 1/8 inch top. Smell is smoky, similar to the Rogue Smoke Ale, but milder. Some malt and hops struggles through. Taste is smoky with a mild heat. This beer could use just a touch more heat, though my wife thought it was too hot. Results vary by palate, eh? The smokiness was assertive but, again, not as strong as in the Smoke Ale. Mouthfeel is medium with the smokiness and heat providing the body. There are some hops noted in the end. This is a quaffable brew, demanding some hearty food to accompany it. I'll have this on hand for barbecues this summer."
"I wasn't sure what to except of this beer since the last chile beer I had was Crazy Ed's and I didn't care for that one bit. Based on the BA rating and knowing that it's a Rogue Ale I knew I wouldn't be let down. It pours a cloudy brown color with little head. For some reason I was excepting a strong chile smell, but it is quite mild as it that of brown ale. With the mouthfeel you have a nice sense of carbonation and is smooth. The taste is similar to a brown ale, but has hint of another flavor I just can't pinpoint. Even for people that don't like the idea of chile in beer should give this at try, I was pleasantly surprised and can easily drink several of these. Two thumbs up on this one."
"Glowing amber orange with a creamy orange-tinged head with good lacing. I cant believe the difference in color between this and the Golden is only the chipotles! Its way to rich in color! Sweet malt with lots of smokiness. Close to a rauchbier in character with something else going on. Clean tasting beer, good malt presence, definite chipotle flavor. There is no mistaking this for a rauchbier. Slight spicy tingle builds after a few sips. Smokey aftertaste with lingering bitterness. Tasty brew. I wouldnt go they *obvious* approach and pair this with a spicy dish, but this would be a nice compliment to simply prepared chicken or an assortment of mild cheeses."
"Pours out a copper color. Head ends up pretty thin. Can definitely pick up the chipotles in the aroma. Taste is quite smokey and peppery. Has some hops but not as much as other Rogues. Maybe that's what is missing, I think this beer would go well with a lot of foods, especially with American summertime cuisine. Right now my tastebuds are looking for something to pair it with...feels a little bit oily in my mouth. Perhaps I may revisit this one when I can eat something with it."
"Pours out a clear amber color with a small light tan head. Decent lace. Light smoky smell to it and a solid malt backbone to help it out. Pretty simple nose to it but it gets the jobs done. Taste was quite malty with sweet caramel standing out and a solid smokiness throughout the flavor. A tad spicy from the hops or the peppers. Nice, simple and very clean. A little more kick would have done it good. Mouthfeel is about medium and the goes down quite easy. Very drinkable stuff. Even more so with a meal. I enjoyed it."
"I dont think I will have another one of these. I admit I am not always a fan of smoke beers, but I love my peppers. I was disappointed."
"I like hot chiles, I could use a six pack of this over the winter. There is taste there, however one-dimensional chiles with a smoke offering. Had again seven months later, and similarly liked the strong taste. Perhaps I am a contrarian, but I also like Canadian garlic beer."
"Not bad... Not as good as I had hoped it to be, but not nearly as bad as I expected it to be. The appearance of this beer is quite beautiful. It has a deep amber color with golden highlights. A perfectly composed and sized white head that eventually recedes to a ring. The smell picks up a bit on the smoked chipotle peppers on top of the slightly roasted malts. The taste is dominated by the smokey flavor from the chipotle, but it is not disgustingly strong like I find many smoked beers to be (such as the Rogue Smoke Ale). I was a little bit disappointed that there wasn't more of a sweet BBQ type of flavor in the back or even the spiciness. Perhaps one day, if I am ever feeling adventurous (and if it is available) I will have to try the Cave Creek if it is the flavor and spiciness of the peppers that I crave. Worth a drink... don't be scared to take the plunge. I know I was (chili beer?!) even though I tend to drink every beer with an open mind and palate."
"Was told it was tapped the night before. Deep and amber, clear, with a dusting of faint white head. Cant smell anything really, just slight maltiness, very clean. -(and there was not a bit of smoke in the air). Smooth with a touch of carbonation, but you barely feel it -nice. Deep and malty, burnt toast. Bit of lingering caramelly sweetness. There is just a touch of a tingle to your tongue, but no heat at all. I was hoping to get a bit of it- I knew not to expect a CaveCreek or anything, but still thought I would catch more than there is. And since this was still freshly tapped, I assume this is what the heat is supposed to be at. A lot of flavor is left in your mouth. Decently drinkable with nice flavors, but I was still hoping to get a bit of a punch -or at least a nudge from this one."
"Now, to try the Mole Black & Tan with a Rogue Chocolate Stout....mmm...that's ridiculously tasty."
"Overall, this was merely a delve into the curiosity corner. This was a bottle of Mexicali, actually. Now labeled as Chipotle. I'd like to re-try this at a later date, but the Mexicali might be past its prime. Buttery malty ale with a touch of tobasco."
"I don't know how drinkable this would be as a session brew, but it would likely go with a good, spicy meal a helluva lot better than Corona."
"i was hesitant to sample this style, but, seeing as i like damn near anything that is spicy and rogue brews a beer within this style, i figured i'd give it a whirl and i'm glad i did. it pours a nice copper/orange colour with minimal head but what is there is rather sticky. the smell is mainly your basic pale ale, i felt, with a nice balance between earth malt and sweet hop. there, of course, is a noticeable chile/pepper smell as well. the flavour is pretty much spot on, starting out somewhat dry amnd malty before hitting a touch of those sweet hops and then finishing with a spice kick that will hit you but not overpower you. it's mixed in toward the end just right and provides for a lovely tingly mothfeel that is well placed with the carbonation of the brew. while i can't say that this one would be for everyone, i certainly enjoyed it. at the very least, give it a try. it's most definitely a well crafted brew, even if it is different."
"Sinkability  Ay, caramba! Estos cervesa es muy malo."
"Poured into a Schell tulip from a 22oz. bomber. Color is of dark iced tea, with a small white bubbly head that melts down to a small island of foam in the middle of the beer. I had a bottle of rogue smoke ale last week and it smells about the same, smoke. Taste is definitely of smoke for most of the sip, but leaves a chipotle tang at the end. Not anything I would call spicy (I use Tabasco at least 2 meals a day). Much better than Rogue's Smoke Ale, but nothing I would get ever again. Worth a try, though."
"Hue was amber to a slight vermilion. Little head to speak of; just a faint skein. Peppery spiciness accentuated by a grotto-like outer roundness to the whole nose gay. Not sure which hot peppers were used in this  chipolte, cascabel, California hybrid, Anaheim, jalapeno, pequin, or serrano  but whatever they were, they fired right through my lips, leaving a scalding trail up my tongue, through the roof of my mouth and up into my skull. And I loved it. There also seemed to be a slight cream edge, like bakers chocolate. The spice didnt really catch fire until five or six seconds after each swallow. I was happy that the only other thing I was eating at Redbones on this visit was water, and not their barbecue, because I think that would have been sheer overkill. Overall, this is a medium-bodied offering and one that I would choose to have more than one of if my tongue would allow it. I truly enjoyed this unusual pour, and in the end, it packed no more heat than a few drops of Tabasco."
"Had on-tap at the Rogue Public House in San Fran, where Larry told me it makes a great chaser for tequila ;)"
"Clearish darker amber appearance, head settles to a skim in about 40 seconds. Laces in very fine strings on the side of the glass. Aroma is relatively subtle, smokey with a rustic rye bread maltiness, prickly and spicy. Medium mouthfeel overall, but with a mask of fullness. Pepper is certainly apparent in the flavor profile, and early -- generates heat by the third sip. Hops play in tune with the spiciness, there's an onion skin bittering in the aftertaste. Chile beers are one of the few that I rarely have a favorite in, but there is a better sense of sweet malt balance here than in many. I still have trouble finishing a whole bomber of this one, though. Intriguing aroma."
"Definitely drinkable, but don't expect a refreshing cold one or anything."
"Usually, I drink beer to quell a spice burning, not to bring one on. In moderation, this is a unique and interesting beer. However, this really doesn't have much sessionability due to the heavy pepper spice. Still, one glass is interesting, and I'm glad that Rogue took the chance on the experiment, and I'd probably have a glass again."
"how did this find its way to vegas? owell. i admit it didnt sound all that tastey, some dude described it heart burn in a bottle...but i couldnt not try it. bought a bomber and brought it home to see someone had gone to baja fresh and had tons of left over chips and salsa. seems like a good pairing. this poured out a clear reddish/copper with a nice bubbly white head. the aroma is nothing intense, a pleasant light mixture of smoke, peppers and malt. upon first taste, i thought...its alright. but then i took another and another and so on, and it got alot better. light smokiness matched up with a lightly sweet malt, the pepper taste is def. there, and it gets more and more noticable as you continue drinking. the heat builds up, but never to a point where it isnt enjoyable. crisp and lively in the mouth, this is a cool beer. went great with chips and salsa. this get a brujeria tribute for being different, and tastey."
"Not as spectacular as other Rogue offerings but in the right time and place it has its moments. I enjoyed mine with spicy enchiladas and Mexicali Rogue was a fine companion to put out the flames from the chili sauce."
"Hmmm, now this one is very interesting. Apparantly Rogue messed up a bit, as this bottle is not the same in design as the other 5 anniversary beers. Never-the-less, I also heard that this was the same as Mexicali Rogue, but i've never had that one yet, so here it goes. The pour is beautiful, a glowing reddish colour with a nice white head that lasts for a bit, and leaves a bit of lacing. The aroma is intriguing. Some strong malts, a touch of hops, some smoke, and a bit of peppery heat. The taste is where things really heat up. This brew is very malty and almost sweet up front, than the middle is smoky, and the finish is spicy/hot. The mouthfeel is good, but hot, and the drinkability would be better with some mexian food. Still, this is probably the best pepper beer out there. If a brewery can do it up right, Rogue is the one!"
"An offering I thought i wouldnt like to much but came out being really suprised,pours a golden color with a deep orange tint with not much head that seetles pretty quickly.Aroma is of bicuit malt with a touch of briney chilies.Taste is nice and crisp off the bat dry malt is the flavor that dominates with that smokey chili flavor that come mainly in the finish and aftertaste it gets more noticable after a half a glass.My wife picked out the chili taste right away without even knowing it was a chili beer I am proud of her."
"Appearance: Amber golden hue with a cream colored thin head leaves some ringed lacing behind. Aroma: Touch of hops, toasted malts nice profile finishes with a kiss of Chipotle smokiness. Taste: Mild dose of hop bitterness with unique dry flavor of smoked Chipotles going on with the malt profile seeming a bit stale to me. Mouthfeel: A bit thin lighter bodied ale lacks any notable textures. Drinkability: There's not enough cohesion in the flavors here unique but it just doesn't work for me, a bit of a novelty brew in my eyes."
"Overall I was not too impressed with this beer. It was bought on a whim by a friend and I might have otherwise not tried it. The ""best"" part of the beer for me was the lingering residual pepper effect. The further and further you got down on the pint you'd notice a slight heat in your stomach rising upwards. Could be dangerous for those with heartburn issues. I would like to try this with some Spanish or Mexican cuisine, however."
"22oz bottle served chilled. Pours a hazy, burnt orange color, with an offwhite head that fades quickly. Only a few patches of lace were left on the glass. Aroma was very subdued for a Rogue. Sweet caramel dominated the nose, with just a hint of fruitiness and some smoke. Mouthfeel was actively carbonated with some mild hop bite and a slight twang of pepper bite. Taste featured the caramel malt sweetness, with a balance provided by sparing use of the westcoast hops. I could detect a mild, smoky chili flavor of the chipotle peppers, but they're in the background. Very well balanced, overall, and very drinkable. I think this one would be better with a more assertive pepper presence."
"22 oz. bottle. I'm still waiting for these chipotle peppers to make their presence known. I bought this beer a few months ago, and after reading some reviews, I thought it would be a lot different than it actually is. Body has a deep golden color and the head retains well for a short while, then disappears. The peppers are not at all noticeable in the nose. However, the flavor and aroma of this beer are quite well balanced, though I really detect very little pepperage going on here. Nose is sweet and malty; this follows through in the flavor as well. A hint of signature Rogue hoppiness comes through towards the finish. Only a few seconds after I swallow can I feel a bit of spiciness on my tongue. I wouldn't say I can taste the peppers, but I can feel the heat, if only slightly. Oh, and I didn't expect a perfectly smooth, creamy mouthfeel, but that's what I got. I honestly wanted more peppers, smoke, and fire. That may be the only time I ever say such a thing."
"22 ounce bottle."
"One of my lower scores for a Rogue beer, which is a lineup on which I can usually count. This was not a bad beer, but I was pumped for something special from the addition of the chipotle peppers - not much going on here. Perhaps my bottle was not fresh enough, and the peppers had faded into the background (why does Rogue so steadfastly resist any dating on the bottles?). Overall, this probably fell in the more mellow-end of the pale ale pool. Pretty boring."
"22 oz bomber. My first ""chili"" beer. Figured with Rogue you can't go wrong. Pours slightly hazy golden with an orange tinge. The Head looked nice but died in a hurry. Aroma is of nice bready maltiness with some slighty meaty aromas & a good dose of hops. Taste is very clean. There is nothing special here really. Some very slight fig fruitiness at first, which gives way to bitter hops & some spiciness. Nothing really jumps out. Clean mouthfeel & aftertaste, very drinkable but nothing to write home about. Mediocre offering from rogue. Probably better to spend your money on your favorite macro instead of this for the price."
"Thanks Quaffer for the beers, they will be drank, happily."
"Drinkability- well its higher than i thought it would be due to the fact that it was lacking any sort of heat. I wasnt expecting volcano, but a warm glow would have been nice. Not one of my favourites from Rogue, but you cant like everything. Not to say i wouldnt gladly drink if offered, just dont think i would buy it over their other beers."
"Where you do notice the peppers is an odd spot in the back of your throat that seems to warm as you drink the beer. It's a curious feeling, and absolutely wonderful. A truly unique brew."
"This beer pours well with a good head that is nice and light. The color is a good solid copper color that is slightly hazy. The aroma was very poor, it had a stale smell to it which really turned me off. But once I got past the smell it was smooth sailing. It has a nice dry taste that is obviously spicy, along with a slightly sweet aftertaste that lingers for awhile."
"Big old thanks to BierRiese for helping me to reunite this once-tasted ale to my lips once more!"
"drinkability...I actually poured this down the sink..."
"Well, I was scared no more after a few gulps of this brew. The peppers are pretty subtle, and only add to hop spiciness. It has a good pale malt backround, but it is all about the blend of the hops and the peppers. Very interesting, and I would have to say it was done very well. From what I have heard about other pepper beers, the peppers really take over and ruin it, but it is not so here. Yet another interesting brew from Rogue."
"Kind of a cool orange color with a nice fluffy head. Smells more or less like a pale ale, but after you inhale, there's just the slightest, most minor tingling sensation at the back of your throat. It's not ""hot"" or overly ""spicy."" But it's definitely a unique aroma that produces a unique ""feel."" Starts malty with a dried flower, grassy taste and finishes hoppy. It's really like a nice, standard pale ale (Sierra Nevada-ish) with just a subtle kick of something just a bit more spicy through the middle. Very drinkable. I can see this going well with a variety of Mexican or cheese-related foods like a baked burrito or a pizza (which is what I ate it with tonight)."
"Im not exactly sure what to think of this beer, I like itbut its very unique. Pours a hazy golden/orange color with a fluffy white head the fades down slow, leaving a sticky thin lace. A mild smoky aroma emerges from the glass, intermixed with light citrus hops and a bit of spiciness. Taste was very similar to the smell. Initially the taste was a bit malty, followed by the smokiness of burn wood, finished off with a zing of spicy chipotle peppers. This beer is great matched up with some Mexican food. Another excellent brew from Rogue."
"This cloudy golden brew poured a tight white head that left very little lace. Smokey, floral and sweet plum aromas are slight. The earthy and buttery flavors don't stop the smoked chipotle peppers from asserting themselves. I don't know if the warming feeling is from the peppers or the alcohol, but it's nice. My expectations of Mexicali were low but to my surprise i enjoyed it alot."
"The beer poured a nice color, and look like quite a beer. Oddly enough, There was no detectable smell. The taste was quite muted as well. I wasn't really aware of the taste, but I sensed a smokey aftertaste. It was a decent base ale, but I'll probably not be spending upon it again."
"Taste: All malt at first then a small hint of hopes and the smoke pepper come in (ever so lightly) a sweet finish at the end. Great mouth feel and very drinkable . Another fine Rogue Beer."
"This beer was pretty good. If someone *has* to make a beer with peppers in it, it should taste like this."
"Beer is a hazy golden. Small creamy off-white head sits on top. Pretty light nose for a Rogue beer. A little malt and some citric hop tones. I wasn't expecting to love the taste of this beer (or any pepper beer for that matter), but the pepper notes are ever so subtle. This is actually an enjoyable brew. The pepper tones are kind of appealing. Other than the pepper, there is a nice mix of malt and hops. A little caramely. A little spicy hop bite as well. Overall, this one is pretty good."
"Mexicali pours with a modest finely-carbonated white head, over deep golden, slightly hazy liquid. Nose is a bit of lightweight malt with a light note of sulphur. Tastes malty at first, with a very slight smokiness from the Chipotle peppers, then a nice although quite subtle heat is felt in the throat, subsiding quickly. Finishes a bit weaker than I remember (it's been a year or two since I last tasted it) it used to have a bigger flavor to it, but still is a unique departure in the Light Ale catagory."
"very interesting....deep copper color, medium head and some lace.  almost a neutral smell with just a hint of smoke and rogue hops.  nice full mouthfeel gives way to some malt, a bit of hops and smoke and then a slightly warm chipotle finish.  the amount of heat is just right and then leaves a smoked aftertaste.  very tasty...would go great with some cheese and crackers and some smoked meat.  a slightly lower score for drinkability because this beer will not agree with everyone...but i loved it!"
"First pour: light golden with lager-like clarity and full head. Second pour: darker orange, hazy and no head at all. Musty odor with traces of smokiness and vague hops. Gentle malts are quite subdued and make room for the bold finish which is actually more smoky than spicy. Still the peppers linger in the finish, long beyond the beer, and build up strength in a way that is completely atypical for any beer I have tried, but right in line with the properties of hot peppers. The beer itself is quite nice and refreshing, smooth, and the smokiness is closer to a Bamberger Rauch. I could go either way with this beer; it woud be equally good - and much less intrusive - without the lingering burn, but it does make the beer interesting, even unique."
"Notes: Seriously one of the best spiced/herbal ales we have ever had ... some complex yet very well balanced and oh so drinkable all at the same time. A generous addition of smoked chipotle peppers give this brew the heat and smoke."
