"Yellow with a nice pepper smell. Taste is very jalapeno-chili with little beer flavor. Heat does not linger very long. It is hot, not as hot as Stone Crime or punishment  though. overall an OK hot beer."

"Cloudy yellow, slightly orangey brownish tinge, smells like spicy olive juice. Taste is VERY peppery! spicy hot! Not an understatement, cant believe how hot this stuff is. Starts in the beginning of the mouth and works your way to the back of the throat. good for a hot beer but nothing you'd drink on a regular basis, makes a GREAT chili base!!"

"Man up or go home. This is exactly as advertised. Looks like a nice guy semi cloudy wheat, smells like a pleasant Chili Pepper before you bite it. Taste, be ready, it's not a fake beer. Love it. Not a daily drinker like Rogue chipotle ale. It is honest, real, spicy fun. Enjoy once every month or so."

"O: It's just too much. Not bad, but NOT recommended."
""
"the heat hasnt been intolerable for me, but maybe that's because there is no regulating a pepper. some are hot and some are not. i guess i just got a 'cool' one."
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy khaki head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt and chile pepper aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly sour chile flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of chile heat in the back of the throat after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a pretty nice chile flavor."
""
"Edit: I couldn't finish the bomber. The heat was too much."

"Not my style or preference. Will kill any other beer and most foods. Don't even try to taste other styles after this one; it is a ""real"" palate wrecker. If you just want a hot spicy drink, for some reason, this is for you. But, this one is a one dimensional novelty that has been handled with much to much of a heavy spicy pepper hand. Just my opinion. (The heat and burn in my mouth and throat has not diminished in over ten minutes!)"
"O- I didn't like this beer. It had a muddy wheat flavor followed by a bile-like burning spiciness that coated the back of the throat. Overall I won't be partaking in this beer again."
""
"Overall: A good chili beer. Lots of heat, but the underlying nuances peak thru. Drinkability is good (if you like chili beers)."
""
"Brewery claims it won silver at 2004 GABF, possibly in the juvenile beer joke catagory. Give your buddy a gulp of this stuff right after you spring the Whoopee Cushion on him. I have to compare this to Ghost Face Killah, for its total commitment to bottled silliness."
"This is definitely not for everyone, but it is for me. I like chili beers and this one delivers. Very well done for the style. I will be revisiting this one."
"O: This isn't bad for a chile beer. The aroma is very good in my opinion, but the other aspects are certainly lacking. It does pair well with my turkey and jalapeno sandwich though."
"Overall I had high hopes for this beer and was let down. I actually didn't even get through a quarter of the bomber I bought. If this pepper taste could maybe be infused with a stout or porter style that had more depth in the beer I could really see it working out better. Well, my search goes on!"
"Overall: If you are looking for a Spicy, Hot Chili beer that burns your mouth than this is it! Very fun beer to use as a novelty, but I could not enjoy more than a few sips. I think this beer would be a lot better if it was blended down with more of it's base wheat ale."
"O: WOW... HOT SAUCE IN A BEER! I love hot stuff and I love beer but I DO NOT love this. Not my type of beer. Beer is usually refreshing and something I love to drink after I eat spicy food... no relief here."

"Overall this isn't much, it is just hot. Not something I would buy again, there are hotter and more flavorful Chilie beers out there. This is closer to the bottom of the pack than the middle."
"Overall this is a good beer for what it is. There are excellent variations of chilis with a good spiciness. It could use a little malt body and touch of sweetness but I think it's just meant to be about the chilis. I recommend this is you like chilis and spice."
"Overall: I actually think this is a good chile beer. Not a lot of balance going on so that kind of kills the score but over all not a bad little beer"
"O- A chile beer should have elements of chile and beer to it. This only has elements of chiles. I think if there was some balance to the beer it's a style that could work well. As is, it's hard to drink."
"O- Disappointed, this is like drinking jalapeno juice, and there is only one flavor. I think there needs to be a significant amount fine tuning to add and make it more palatable. I mean in less you love the heat, get out of the kitchen."
"Looking forward to washing this one down with a stout."
"Yes. This beer tastes like chilis. And it's hot. This should come as no surprise since there's a big red chili on the bottle along with the words ''spicy'' and ''HOT!"" This pairing is excellent, chilis are not just heat, they have fruit flavors as well The fruitiness of the chilis is a natural match for the floral wheat ale. The The heat is a welcome note, most fruit beers are cloying crap for people who don't actually like beer. This isn't. The first drink is a surprise, and not necessarily a pleasant one. But wait a moment, let the endorphins hit, and then form an opinion. Nice work 6 Rivers."
"Overall I’m surprised by the low scores of this beer – what else would one expect from a chili beer? A nice beer for the style and also one of the spicier ones I’ve had."
"The beginning isn't horrible but your relief only lasts for one second. It feels like someone stuck their hand down your throat and pulled on your tonsils with a chili pepper glove. The finish is so dry, leaving you with this mouth of residue and horribleness that left me coughing, seriuosly. Never again, oh cruel cruel world why does this exist?"
"Pours a bright, hazy dark straw color. Very thin head that nearly-immediately dissipates. Thin white collar. Kill shot for sure. The nose is a mess of bell peppers and jalapenos. Amyliz4 says it smells like tater tots. Who can argue? It's bad. Damnit, this better be a chili beer. Loads of spicy jalapeno and green pepper skin. Thin body and moderate carbonation. Really disgusting. Awful. Horrible. Disgusting. Unbearable. Nearly everyone consuming this almost vomited. F."
"I like spicy things. I like peppers. I like beer. This is not a graceful creation combining the ""good"" of any of these things. If you seek the novelty of this, strain some rancid salsa and splash some MGD64 in for a ""beer"" presence. Blargh."
"P.S. I don’t like hot foods with my beer because it tarnishes my palate, but what happens if my beer tarnishes my palate, if you would to ask me for another Six Rivers Chili Pepper Ale I would say no thank you."
"Drinkability- I thought this was very good. It has a great pepper smell and flavor to it. I would love to have this again."
"This was very very good, I love spice so I would love this beer. I understand not everyone loves the burn of peppers when drinking a beverage, but I am one of those people I guess. It is different, very different, but this is one that deserves a try. I have friends who think they are big bad manly men and they drink keystone LIGHT like it shows how manly they are. They would cry there little eyes drinking this beer, now this right here, Is a real mans beer."
"This is a bit of a shock to the senses. Looks like a normal yellow beer until you put it under your nose. Then there is no question this is a pepper beer. Mouthfeel is actually quite decent, however and pepper is what this tastes like. You are not even sure it is beer. Remarkable for its type, however, and while it is a bit of a novelty, it is actually decent to drink."
