"holy shit! No joke with the chilis. This beer is spicy, and offers a lot of the chili fruitiness and I've always craved from a chili beer. Quite daring, but not for the faint of heart!"

"I get green pepper on the nose and more chilies and peppers on the palate. Chili pepper level is just about right here, you don't have to search for it and it doesn't blow up your taste buds. As a chili head who enjoys moderate head, this one was about spot on. My non-chili head wife felt about the same....Worth a try, especially if ya like the style"
"Worth a try."
"O: I found this beer to be quite drinkable for a chili beer—it had lots of pepper aromas and flavors but the spiceness was't that strong. It would pair well with Mexican food, such as tortilla chips and salsa."

"Pale yellow in color. Pure white, thin head with a slight lace left behind. The first thing that stands out is the real, true pepper smell - delicious. The first taste is very light and ""pilsnery"" followed by a very real, excellent pepper flavor - not overpoweringly so and not overly hot. Mouthfeel is, I guess a bit watery, but not off putting. Overall, a really nice chili beer - goes well with pizza. We want to use this for cooking - maybe chicken breasts or sausages!"

"O-A bad avoidable beer, unless you think you'd like it. That being said a major avoid for me."

"Poured out as a clear looking golden color with a thin white head on top. The retention just leaves behind a thin film over the beer. The lacing in very minimal. The smell of the beer definitely has pepper on the nose, good amount of them. It also has a slight smokiness to it along with sweet malts. The taste is sweet for a few seconds right off the first sip then the peppers come in. There is a good amount of heat for a minute or two then it fades. The finish is kind of on the sweeter side. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice carbonation to it. Overall it's actually a pretty good chile beer, the heat comes in strong but doesn't make you wanna die, it tingles and then fades nicely allowing you to go back for another sip. It's not a beer I would drink a lot of, but having a single glass of it was enjoyable."

"The beer pours a clear golden yellow with a razor thin white head that fades quickly, yet provides streaky lacing. The beer was tap-served cold, but still has a sweet jalapeño spiciness in the nose. It's exactly the nose I was looking for which is a relief in comparison to the intense chilies in ghostface...The taste is outstanding and does its part highlighting the chili while also continuing to be smooth and drinkable. There is a light burn on the back of my palate, but it doesn't prevent you from taking your next sip. I think they nailed this beer and I would definitely try it again. My advice would be to use some smoked chilies to bring out even more smoothness; frankly the jalapeño beer is a little overdone and could stand a facelift!"
"Smells a bit spicy, nothing too crazy though. Taste is medium bodied, a nice balanced ale upfront with some slight pepper flavors. Once you swallow the spiciness kicks in and is actually much hotter than I would have expected. That being said, it's a good spiciness and actually rounds out the beer pretty well. Might be tough to have more than one of these in a sitting, but definitely worth a try and one of the more unique beers I've had."

"Overall: For the style, this is well done. One glass is all you can drink solo, but with some spicy tacos or some gumbo I could do a few of these."

"slight bit of pepper way in the back but it was not dominating by any means. The initial sip was a work of art. Sweet milk chocolate and sugar roll across the tongue with a lively and well carbonated feel that really lets the flavor pop. Moving through you start to feel a tingle on the tongue, a warming in the throat and a fire in the belly. Subtly the chili comes through, warming you as it goes, but by no means is this too big. This is perfectly blended in the flavor, rising subtly to a crescendo that then backs down as easy as it came up."

"Picked this up at Beers of the World in Henrietta.Poured into an imperial pint glass a clear dull light goden with a bit of orange tinge,a thin wispy white head atop.Aromas are very light with biscuit dough a tinge of hard water,there is a nice sweet biscuit dough malt base on the palate,the chilis come in the back end and hit the throat.Not as assertive as I thought it would be but it's malt profile is nice."
"The pepper is enjoyable, unlike some other pepper beers I've had."
"D: Fantastic for a chili beer. I would take this in volume to a summer BBQ. Very, very yummy."
"In the end there's almost not enough praise I can give this perfect gem of a beer. Amazing!"
"Cheers!"
"ive only had 2 chile beers in my life, this and the rogue, and i really enjoy the style, but this is definatly the better of the 2."
"D - it's a novelty beer that goes better with food rather than on it's own."
" Overall this was a great tasting, well balanced beer for the style unlike the novelty chile beers you might be used to seeing."
"My mouth is on fire. There is little carbonation, but holds up well and is surprisingly drinkable for how spicy and peppery (as chiles) it is."
" Clearly not a session beer; however, if I were eating a lot of Mexican or spicy Italian food (as I am about to), I would drink several throughout the meal. I've had quite a few chili / peppercorn beers, and this the best yet. Fantastic execution, I want more."
"All in all, this was a unique beer. Not amazing, but if you're looking to try something different, then I would definitely recommend this brew. If you're looking for a solid brew, this one might not be for you."
"Not sure I understand the name, but those dogs on the bottle do look pretty fierce. The brew pours a clear golden copper topped by a finger of steadfast white foam. The nose is rather heavy on the pepper, showcasing both its inherent heat and even deeper chlorophyll levels. Some vague wheat and extremely light citrus notes lie submissive in the background (I fear for their safety). The taste immediately begins as a normal light lager-ish brew, but quickly a decent amount of peppers comes in, washing o'er all and staying through the finish, when a bit more of that lager comes in, vague floral hops, light wheat and corn, and whatnot. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying feel and finish. Overall, a nice chile beer, a hulluva lot better than most of its competitors (though I think that may go without saying...)."
"Tastes bright pepper flavor with mild but dancing pepper sting. Malt sweet is well balanced to the pepper flavor and heat. Not much flavor in the way of malt and no hop flavor or bitter than I can detect. As far as pepper beers go, this is quality stuff. Medium body with a nice dextrinous quality that holds both the malt sweet and pepper sting. Me likey...give me more!"
"D- horseheads has produced a style that is seldom dominating the scenes. Look... you need to try this brew and appreciate what the crafter is trying to produce. As I am a fan of the spices... I will give credit to this concept. Great job Horseheads!"
"D- I like hot and I like Horseheads, so this beer will be purchased again. Not a style I rush out for, but a great curve ball when I want something different."
"Quite an interesting brew. I bet this would be killer with a bowl of chili. The more you drink the warmer it gets."
"The simplicity is precisely what makes this an easy beer to consume. While it does improve with a little warmth, Hot-Jala-Heim is really an all purpose beer, best as a refresher."
"Pretty drinkable. A really great chile beer overall, even if the heat is not as intense as a hardcore heat guy like me would like."
"F: Spicy, and the spiciness seems to linger a bit. More of the sweet malts and lager flavors lingering. Wheat, pepper, and a little honey lingering for a while."
"I would of enjoyed this more if I was eating something with a bit of a kick to it. It's a great example of the style without being too outrageous (cave creek). "
"Thanks indiapaleale!"
"This one isn't half bad. The heat wasn't overwhelming, I could see me enjoying these if I were closer to the brewery."
"Horseheads Hot-Jala-Heim is a pretty clear, lively golden beer with a fluffy white head that fades pretty quickly. The aroma has notes of corn, jalapeno, DMS and a little toasty malt. It has a foamy medium body that's pretty smooth with a quick finish that's a bit scratchy. It's a touch sweet and a touch bitter. Chocolate is detected. There's a nice twang and spice from the peppers. It's a little corny. This is more complex than I expected. It's kind of like drinking a burrito. I didn't figure out that there were Anaheims in it until I just about finished the bottle. Now it all makes sense."
"D: Best chili beer yet."
"Thanks to BeerTruth for picking this up for me and for number1bum for muling it back from Syracuse. A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a hazed golden yellow color with about an inch of off white foam. No lacing to speak of here. Nose is of green pepper skins, toasted malt, slightly sweet. Flavors consist of fresh green peppers, jalapeno peppers, nice amount of heat but by no means overpowering. The heat comes at your mouth, tongue and throat gradually after each sip and lingers until you take another pull from the glass. Amply carbonated with a medium body. A pretty decent chile beer with an emphasis on fresh, raw peppers."
"D: if you don't like spicy food or jalapeños then this beer is not for you. This is a mildly spicy tribute to the beauty that is the pepper. Not something I would drink everyday, but undoubtedly this is the best chili beer I've had yet."
"Bottle from Village Beer Merchant. Quite lagerish initially, with peppers in the finish. As I got through most of the bottle, the peppers build up and its more refreshing. Grows on you. Have liked more spicey bolder of this variety, and this was not bad, drinkablity is good."
"D - While this is a pretty one-dimensional beer, it is well-done and not overly hot or spicy at all, rendering this as quite drinkable overall. The pepper flavor is not overbearing at all."
"D-Nice stuff....not hot, light and easy to drink. This brew is a nice accompanying beer with food. We had it with franks and beans and it went great!"
"D: A great accompaniment to beans and weenies, the ale is a pretty good brew that smells great."
"D: The most drinkable chilli beer I have ever had. Glad we had alot of heads to split the bottle."
"This is definitely a good beer; pretty drinkable. With that said, I think Chile beers are food beers for the most part. They're great with a sandwich or pizza or anything that could be spiced up a bit."
"The peppers burn the throat a little, but in a good way. This beer is pure liquid nachos, brother. No way around it. I like it; truly unique."
"Drinkability- Definitley the best tasting Chili Beer I've had but honestly it was slightly tough to finish the whole bottle. It has just enough capsicum to really warm the throat after about half the glass. If you have heartburn, stay away from this brew lol. If you love Chili Beers, you have to seek this one out. Thanks Adam!"
"A real interesting brew I finished the bomber. I think that was enough for one sitting, but I will look for one in the future"
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid golden ale base, which is light and full of pale malts, but it also has a semi-aggressive pepper aroma. Jalapeno peppers are quite noticeable. The taste is good. It has a light, pale malt flavor with little to no hop character, along with a ""hot"" peppery finish. It says that it's made with jalapeno and anaheim peppers. It's mildly spicey at first then it bites you good in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a beer inspired by a recent trip to the GABF. Chili beers rock the Colorado area and now thanks to these guys they rock NY as well."
