3.92,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Overall, we’ve been very, very excited to get our hands on this beer.  Were it not due to the instance of a buddy who wanted to grab some drinks, it may have taken much longer to reach that goal of finally making the brief trek over to Dragonmead.  We adore spicy chili beers, and since moving to Michigan, many of the native locals have pointed us towards Ring of Fire.  The intrigue has been built, and expectations made.  Keep in mind, this was predominantly before the times of Crime and Punishment, so no real precedent had been set.  What we encountered here was a nicely flavored chili beer.  At no point did it approach the scalding, melting heat that we had prepared for, but again, by the bottom of the glass you definitely began to feel the burn and sweat just a touch.  This does not ruin the palate, and was our first taste of the night after which we were just fine to continue tasting.  The real prize here is in this beer’s authenticity.  The flavors presented are real and palatable for the most part, and you can tell real thought and care went into developing this recipe.  To base the chili on top of their standard cream ale is definitely unique, and adds a biscuity and fruity sweetness that is not often encountered in this style.  Ultimately, we are pleased to have tried this beer, and believe it is a must-try for those that can’t get enough of the style.","TheBrewo","Sep 05, 2014"

3.85,2.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Once I tried it, not to spicy. Def had a kick to it but I enjoyed it. A mild taste of the chile pepper. Overall I would say it was a great success. I know for a fact I would not be able to finish a 750ml but since I had it served in a 6 oz sampler that was plenty for me! Cheers","yankeej13","Jan 02, 2009"
3.32,-11.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"overall - i was less than impressed simply because i expected it to really burn, the first time i had it i couldnt really judge it other than i liked it since i had hung out at dragonmead for a few hours before, would order again but i would ahve to be in the mood for it, pretty well balanced and quite tasty, not the best beer in the world but still good","SeaUrchin","Sep 26, 2008"
3.73,-1.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a deeper amber color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of green peppers and just all around peppers. Tastes of peppers. Initially this one was not hot but the heat crept up after you drank it. I'm not talking a Cave Creek chile burn, but a lighter pepper burn.","hopdog","Apr 28, 2008"
3.75,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D-Rather good, but I don't think I could down many of these in a row. Rather one dimensional, a lot like liquified Jalapeno Jelly. Interesting but certainly not the best chili beer I have ever had.","Deuane","May 22, 2007"
3.8,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a clear golden amber with thin white head, average retention and spotty lacing. Smells of malt, floral hops, and chili peppers. Taste starts off with some floral notes with a honey backbone and a big chili pepper spicy finish. Medium light in body, crisp and smooth with a spicy kick. Easy to drink with a spicy finish, good if you like a spicy beer, but there isn't much else to it.","HopDerek","Beers"
3.68,-2.4,4,3.5,4,4,3,"This was my first experience with a peppered beer, straight off the tap in the brewery. Looked like an ordinary ale, clear and golden with a light-colored head. Only when you bring it up to smell do you start to realize that there's something different about this one, the usual hops and malts come through, but any other scents are overpowered by the distinct scent of firey peppers. Taste may be an acquired taste, but being a pepper lover it was very nice for me. Honestly I didn't notice much past the pepper, the best description I could think of would be "a good ale with peppers in it", which I suppose is rather appropriate. I do believe, however, that a more refined palate than my own could find much much more to enjoy in this one. The mouthfeel was good, with a nice crisp sensation slowly giving way to the burn. Drinkability is the only area where this one suffers, in that the heat made it a tad hard to drink. I kept wanting to take a sip of something else to dull it. That being said, I certainly wouldn't pass up an opportunity to drink this one again.","StargherKing","0"
