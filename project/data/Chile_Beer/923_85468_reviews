"I don't have the most refined pallet in the world but I really found the taste disorienting. Not in a particularly bad way however."

"I've had it on tap and in a can.... honestly a can is better."

"Definitely taste the cumin.  Interesting beer."

"Brewed with Hatch chile and pulls it off."
""

"I was expecting something more like spicy chocolate because of the smell it gives off but the taste was like a watered down chipotle stout.... I don't really recommend it"

"More points to Ska for crafting a stout that stands out from the pack, and though it is experimental, this is easily the best of it’s kind I’ve ever had. Will enjoy again, yes!"

"The ink black color is something to look at, though if you're expecting a head, look quick because is dissipates very quickly. The pleasant aroma tickles the nose is spicy hatch chiles and cocoa. It's delicious to say the least, not overspiced nor weak. In fact, it reminds me of a lighter Xocoveza, and those cinnamon, chile, and brown sugar notes really turn me on. It's in between light and medium bodied, and despite fuzzy carbonation, this is a beer that I will be looking forward to meeting again."

"I was pleasantly surprised by this. Chocolate and cinnamon dominate the aroma and flavor with accents of dark fruit and chili pepper. Very good."
"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. This beer is deep black, only slightly brighter around the edges. A frothy mocha head forms and then completely disappears almost immediately. I caught a ton of varied aroma on the pour, all of which were confirmed in the still glass: nice milk/dark chocolate balance, vanilla, cinnamon, and a hint of vegetal spiciness. The taste isn't as nice as the nose, but still contains some decent cocoa and a hint of the cinnamon. It's all corralled by the pepper spiciness, which feels higher in the balance than it should be. Everything tastes decent together, but I wish that more of the wonderful sweet spices contained in the nose were present in the taste. Body is light and slick, the pepper spiciness again keeps any of the sweetness from becoming overbearing. IMO, beers like this should lay the sweet flavors (milk chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon) on thick, balance them with dark chocolate/slight hop bitterness, and then use the spice as a tool to keep the finish dry and leave the imbiber wanting more. Mole stout seems a bit out of whack (compared to the Hunas/Abraxis's of the world, which really isn't fair), but for 9-12 per sixer and at an ABV that makes it sessionable within it's style, it's definitely worth checking out if you (like me) can't get enough of the Mexican hot chocolate stout trend."

"O: Overall I am VERY impressed. Quite unique and enjoyable. I was sad to have missed out on Xocoveza, but this one was actually recommended to me by a Stone employee and I wasn't disappointed!"
""

"This is my least favorite of the usually delicious Ska stouts. Actually it could work with such interesting flavors. From the 12 oz can purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."

"idunno... smells thin. looks.... just dark.... smell is thin, like a cheap-bar kind of smell.... taste is the same- cheap-bar kind of taste, with some chocolate and chile saving its ass..... not enough chile for me though.... I bought a six pack hoping this stuff is gonna be decent, but having my doubts.... another drink.... meh, i'm giving this stuff away....."

"Serving type: can."

"And the carbonation (good) is saving this beer from being terrible"

"Great Stout , the aroma is awesome Mexican chocolate Cinnamon, nutmeg  , dont get any alcohol  in the nose .It taste even better . Overall a great brew actually but me a couple 6 packs to put away ."
""
""
""
"O- This is quite nice.  It's like a more easygoing Xocoveza.  Thumbs up."
""
""
"If you are also a mole lover, you should give this stout a try.  If you're wary of red chile flavors, give it a pass."
"A very rich tasting, pleasingly sensuous textured dark beer. The molé peppers are balanced just about right - subtle yet prominent enough to add depth and complexity to the rich sweetness of the malt grains. Like many chili pepper beers, the presence of a head is problematic as far as visual appeal goes, and the aroma is rather tame, but these minor quibbles shouldn't stop someone who wishes give their taste buds a treat."

"Interesting stout. Easy drinker, pretty unique especially on the nose. I'd drink it again"

"I tried this as the Great American Beer Festival, and was captured by the uniqueness of the cumin idea, enough so I bought a sixer after the fest. Now that some time has passed, what appealed to me about it then just doesn't hold up. It's worth trying if you're in to molé or chiles, and especially if you like the flavor of cumin. I can imagine this would be really interesting to cook with, as well."
"I can't say that I'm very impressed with Ska's Mole Stout. I like the idea but the execution is lacking. The spices seem stale and there isn't much to the base stout. I can't say I'd buy this one again."
""
""
""
""

"Nice Idea using the cocoa and chile but other breweries have done this before to greater success (New Belgium Cocoa Mole, Lost Abbey Mayan Judgement Day, etc.). Hops bring too much herbal and vegetative flavors while the spices and chilies should be more balanced. Taxing to the palate after a while."
"O: Glad I tried it, but Chile beer is not one of my favorites. Too spicy for my taste."

"Not one to bash beers, so I will just leave it there."
"O - Interesting, just not something for me."
""
"O-I admit to having a soft spot for chile beers (stouts in particular) and I enjoyed this beer. It is a little harsh and disjointed at times, but it provides a good dose of chile aroma and flavor and decent complexity with the cinnamon and cocoa. The mouthfeel drags the score down a bit, but I would drink this again on a cool fall day like today without complaining."
""
"Just as the flavor is affected, so too is the mouthfeel, as this beer presents a challenge to the palate. Spiciness mixed with an odd pungency make this beer less smooth going down then one would like. In the end, it's an okay beer, but still one that can't hang with other, better spicy stouts."
""
""
"Molé [sic?] Stout is as confusing as its misspelled name. It isn't a bad as a chili/spice beer, but both the spelling oddity and the beer's off-balanced flavors make me wonder if the brewers understand what mole is supposed to taste like. In the end, I'm glad I tried it, but won't revisit."
""

"I mean, this boils down to two things. Do you like mole? Do you like drinking mole? If you answered no to either, this probably won't be for you. It IS however a very well crafted beer: complex and layered: an excellent representation of what it's trying to be. I am glad I picked it up, and am enjoying the experience, but it's not one that I'd want to make my go to every day: I'm just not interested in drinking mole all the time. Definitely worth checking out, though."

"overall as a fan of chili beers I like this one a lot. recommended."

"The beer poured an opaque brown with a decent amount of sediment and little to no head. The aroma was of sweet caramel malt and cocoa that did not fully encapsulate the flavors to come. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with less cocoa on than the aroma, but what the aroma did not represent was the spice. There were flavors of cinnamon and cardamom with a slight hint of clove which was all very autumn appropriate. While I didn’t detect much heat from the chile peppers I did detect a bit of their bittery presence. The flavor did leave the lingering presence of Mole on my palate which is an obvious target. Definitely an interesting brew and probably with more heat fresh."

"The Crack posed no difficulty nor did I experience gushing or any other form of problem. That may have been a bad batch. An inverted Glug began a nice bit of pseudo-cascading action, but I finally had to back off to avoid overflow. I had a brief, fizzy finger of deep-tan head with low retention as the result of my efforts. Color was a deep, dark-brown which allowed ZERO light penetration. The melange of scents emanating on the nose was fabulous! Chile pepper? Check. Cocoa chocolatiness? Check. Other unidentifiable spices? You bet. No lacing, but an oily film laid atop the beer. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and I was worshipful of the idea that they did not go overboard on the Scoville units. Just as IBUs measure a beer's hoppiness, SUs measures a pepper's heat and I am not terribly tolerant of heat. This tasted like my buddy, Ernie's, mom's mole and that is saying something! She was a great cook and knew how much I appreciated her culinary works. The three main ingredients really worked well together to create a spicy, peppery, chocolaty taste that I find hard to describe otherwise. The finish held a heat that lingered well after the swallow and I am again glad that they did not go overboard. This could be a scorching beer if they allowed it to be as such. Phew. This is what I would describe as an acquired taste."

"Pours black as coal with a very quick tan-brown head. Looks like burnt motor oil. Aroma is dark chocolate covered nuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, very dark roast barley, and bourbon. Taste follows the aroma and has a bittersweet chocolate tang finish. Not getting any of the chile. The boozy bourbon taste leads one to believe this is more than a 5.5% ABV. This reminds me of bourbon filled chocolates. Had this with a chicken mole burrito. Not very food friendly. Would be better with chocolate - Senior Murphy Chile Cream Chocolates to be exact!"
"O: What a strange, interesting beer; it looks like ""still"" cola but it sure tastes different; I like elements of a lot of this beer and I hate elements of a little bit of this beer; hmmm"
"Ska Brewing Mole Stout ---2.5/5"
"O: I had a couple of these the other night and I thought it was a pretty good beer, but now that I'm able to sit down and taste it objectively (and sober) I'm realizing what a remarkable find this is. The most amazing part of it is the pepper, because of how subdued and mellow it is, blending perfectly with the chocolatey toastyness of the rest of the beer. I just can't get over it. Other pepper beers are all pepper, often ruining the palate for anything with a lighter flavor, but I could easily drink several of these with out getting tired of it and still be able to taste my food. Good job Ska!"
""
"Still, a darn fine beer, just needs a bit of fine tuning. Great dessert beer"
""
""
""
""

"I would actually like this beer without the cinnamon, nutmeg and whatever. Stick with the basics in a chile beer. Chiles, chocolate, 2 row."
""
""
""
"Thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is spicy chili peppers. Taste is unique, spicy yet not hot per say, a bit of cocoa, a different flavor that, while good, is not something I would want a steady diet of. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a unique and unusual beer worth a shot."
""
""
""
"O-Tasty brew in my opinion and certainly not a typical stout. I wish it was a little more full bodied but I would have it again."
""
""
""
""
"The carbonation is medium strong, the small bubbles sharp and short-lived. The liquid is light and a little dry."
""
"Overall - This is a pretty tasty brew overall. I would certainly recommend trying it, for it is tasty! Very unique style, tasty. you can ue this brew to impress your beer snob friends as something they may never have had. Check it out next chance you get@"
""
"Super roasted malts mixing well with chocolate and coffee. Palate is slick and oily. This is a chile beer where you can taste the chili's. But they aren't overpowering. Everything seems to come together very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very drinkable chili beer because the peppers aren't that prominent and don't contribute any heat to the taste."
"O: A decent drink, but not a very good beer. I really can't taste anything outside of the chocolate, chiles, and spices."
""
""
""
""
"Honestly wasn't that special, maybe it needs somthing to set it apart but for me it was just another dark beer. I couldn't find any chile peppers in this brew at all."
""
"O: Probably the easiest drinking beer I have tried in the Chile beer style and it has a nice complexity of flavors to it. Not something I would want to have multiple in a session but definitely an enjoyable beer."

"D - Bleh. The feel is among the worst I've experienced in the style. Aroma had a bit of hope but nothing can save this one. Honest drainpour."
"3/c = average."
"This is a hard one to rate for me. I believe this Chile Beer style primarily exists to provide the connoisier with a new experience. The smell and taste do that in spades. Its extremely difficult to get many of the fresh flavors this beer has to survive the brewing process and arrive on your palete. The mouthfeel and especially the appearance suffer, though. Overall I recommend it, but I feel the brewmaster(s) may have been able to get more head retention somehow. Maybe we could see this in a nitro can or nitro tap."
""
"O: Not very exciting. Well crafted but a bit too modest for my taste."

"Overall this was a nice treat and quite drinkable. For such a low ABV offering this packs a nice flavor that I bet was even more strong when it was first released in early Autumn. Not a beer I would want to have everyday or more than two in a sitting despite the low ABV but a fine offering and quite balanced overall for a spice/chile beer."
"Overall, a very nice mole beer - very similar to New Belgium's version, but maybe a step below."
"O: This isn't bad, especially for a style that often isn't my favorite. That said, I wouldn't seek out another."
"this stout was something that I have never had before. It was like a chilly, spicy stout. I think they got the body just right for the spices, no so much for the stout category, seems more like a brown stout at most. I enjoyed it for its creativity but think it would be hard to keep going back to. I think it is worth recommending, if you haven't tried a beer like this it is worth the adventure!"

"Overall: this is a very disorganized beer. the parts are good however the sum of the parts are off."
"D - It sounds good, smells good, and the individual notes of the flavor profile are nice but it just doesn't come come together. It is kind of disjointed and the base beer just isn't big enough to deal with the spices. I would love to try an imperial version of this beer, but I don't really like it as it is."
""
"A very good chile beer, wish I bought more than a sixer..."
""
"O - This is a really good beer. It's not a sixer I'd want to session all night but one or two really hits the spot."
"This beer came essentially flat and tastes like someone pored a little stout into and old cola. It is somewhat interesting and does have some spice and heat but to me just not enough stout flavor to really qualify it as a stout. I usually love everything from SKA so I was really excited when I saw this in the store and did not hesitate to buy it. Really disappointing."
"Taste shows some really nice pepper and spice blending. Masterful job Ska! The pie spices are just enough to be noticed and are right on par with the spicy, but not hot peppers. The stout aspects are not overlooked with a chocolaty twist and provide some much needed sweetness to keep things from getting too spice/pepper leaning. Despite the bold flavors this beer is quite drinkable. I am not usually a huge fan of chipotle beers, but I find this one to be a very well done (smoky) chile beer."
"O - Overall I like it a lot. I'd love to try it on draft. I'll keep it on hand for a change of pace in the cool weather."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer at all. Very unique. I think I enjoyed the Lips of Faith Cocoa Mole better. This one seems to have more of a stout character than the Lips of Faith. That being said....This one is still worth trying."
""
""
"My first venture into Chili beer, I'd like to try a few more and compare to this one. This is certainly a unique style and I applaud Ska for brewing it."
""
""
"I snagged this beer wanting to try something new not knowing what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised, this is a very well balanced beer that goes down nice and smooth, couldn't really session these though, more of a novelty beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: this is my first chile beer, and I must say that I had no idea what to expect from this kind of brew. I was surprised on just how complex the aroma was of this brew and even in the taste. The spices really dominate the body along with a huge cocoa backbone and I feel that its a war between bold spiciness and sweet cocoa thus creating a slight imbalance. To be honest, I would not think of this as being a beer because of the immense spices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Despite naming your brewery after a musical genre that everybody prays will never return, Ska Brewing shows its strength in this beer. With a solid ale like this, its always good to remember to never underestimate the potential of a Colorado microbrewery."
""
"One of the coolest style of beers I've seen in a can to date.... let's see how it holds up to my favorite Mexican sauce. Appearance is a fizzy opaque brownish black. Head is non existent, as is any form of lacing. As I take a long deep smell, the first thing that comes to mind is Red Hots candy. This candy cinnamon quality remains at the forefront and basically dominates other notes. There's some mild dry cocoa in the background. The taste is similar. Candy cinnamon a la Big Red gum or Red Hot candy, plus dry cocoa, and a touch of roasty malt profile. The finish features more cinnamon and chocolate with the chili leaving almost zero heat. The mouth feel is a bit prickly with a medium body. Overall, this beer is enjoyable, but not amazing like I was hoping. New Belgium's Cocoa Mole pulled this off in a much better way. This brew feels like a novelty ""candy"" beer. Interesting nonetheless."
""

"Check them both out on Stitcher and iTunes."
"Almost black in color with a sliver of chestnut across the bottom, capped by a nice creamy looking head that is there one second and completely gone the next. Aromas of cinnamon sweetness and semi-chocolaty malt, modest chili smoke, and fruity esters. A little more pepper character in the flavor. Cocoa sweetness, cola, spices. No real heat at all. Increased chocolate flavor as it warms up. Medium bodied and very lightly carbonated which takes some of the life out of it. If they get the carbonation fixed in future batches, this will definitely be better."
""
"This was incredibly disappointing. It tastes like cola with cinnamon. There may be some more spice to this than just cinnamon but it gets buried under the intense cola flavor. I'll be avoiding this at all costs."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer had me going at first like OMG, then after several sips I quickly lost interest because it gets really flat, very light mouth feel, Don't get me wrong I do like it but only because I still can't believe the flavor and is really a beer that taste good but with almost no beer qualities as far as looks and mouth feel goes, very good stout to start a for those who are new to the darks."
""
""
"This can is an Austin Powers joke waiting to happen...(but, then again, I never liked those movies...) It pours a deep, murky black-brown topped by a half-finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, earthy peppers (complete with mild heat), roasted malts, light molasses, and brown sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, with the peppers and cinnamon combining for a unique flavor combination, all whilst the roast dances fancily behind it all. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a very nice peppered stout, one that could probably stand to be year-round... Good times."
"liked this way better than the new belgium one. poured blackish brown, super dark, with almost no head. looks almost flat, but there is some depth to the color. smell is bitter bakers chocolate and cocoa powder, with just a hint of pepper. the flavor is that dusty cocoa up front, with a lot of smokey malt to balance it out. i feel no chili heat in this at all, which i like. the peppers provide just a subtle bit of flavor, nothing too drastic. the chocolate in the finish is also very nice, a little sweeter than on the front end. feel isnt as good as it could be. it needs some more carbonation to pep up its big body. that said though, this is a cool new beer from ska. i would like to make a pot of chili with it at some point. those flavors would be outstanding in there."
""
""
"Overall, worth a shot if you like pepper. I'd pass on it if I saw it again."
"Overall the beers taste hits its goals, cinnamon comes through as well as some sort of cayan pepper like flavoring. It is not offsetting, but it is certainly not sessionable."
""
"EDIT: Having had more of these, the peppers really are a little heavy in this one. They aren't adding heat, but they're compounding the roasted notes from the stout. It's really tasty at first, but after about 1/2 can (once it warms up), they grind on the palate a bit. I haven't had that with other beers like this."
"Overall, this beer is in my unusual but good category. I will buy it again and share with my friends. My only complaint is the lack of head, which also leaves the aroma weak. Give it a head that lasts and this beer would go from good to excellent."
""
""
""
"Overall, I love this. It's not spectacular to look at, looks like a Coke in a pint glass, but it has great pepper heat, chocolate, and spices as advertised. Great beer for Dia De Los Muertos. I'll be drinking it then for sure."
""
"Pours black with a nice dark brown head. Head retention is not a strength for this one. Aroma is dominated by the cinnamon, underneath there is a touch of some roastiness, chocolate, and heat from the peppers. Flavor again started strong on the cinnamon, perhaps a touch too strong, but then in the rear there is some cocoa, something offering a little sweetness, some roastiness, and a hit of some bitterness in the finish.This isn't hot in any uncomfortable way, but there is definitely heat to it. I thought the mouthfeel on this was nice, medium bodied, a little creamy. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. Not on par with Cocoa Mole (only other chile stout/porter I have tried) but I am glad to have been able grab a sixer of this."
""
"Had to ding the appearance because while this beer started out with a huge head it was almost immediately gone. Dark black with a few bubbles at the surface. Aroma is cinnamon, cocoa, peppers, pretty good. Flavor follows suit but is really not robust enough and feels like it has a watery aftertaste. Both Cocoa Mole from New Belgium and Mexican Chocolate Stout from Copper Kettle are better beers, probably due to the body being thicker."
"O: Extremely disappointed. A lot of locals were/are really looking forward to this, and, personally, I don't think it has lived up to the excitement. It doesn't scream mole (or stout for that matter) too me. Just tastes like someone poured a mediocre pumpkin beer into a very mediocre stout."
"Comes in a six pack of 12oz cans. Would buy again."
""
"Poured nearly black except for some deep brown highlights when held up to the light,a half finger tannish colored head atop.Cinnamon and chile really stand out in the nose,a hint of vanilla and earth thrown in as well.Sweet chocolate and spices upfront on the palate,maybe a bit to sweet,charred chile flavors in a lingering after taste.It's a bit one sided with the cocoa and cinnamon-like flavors,I did like the little bit of char and spice in the finish though."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip glass. This pours a very dark brown approaching pitch black, with a small mocha head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of peppers, dark roasted malts. The feel is medium low carbonation. The taste is good, some roasted malts, a peppery finish, okay hops."
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with no head. The aroma is heavy on the peppers, with a lot of the roasted ancho notes coming through strongly. I also get a hint of chocolate and some roasted malt. The flavor is very nice. What really comes through early is some cinnamon and chocolate, as well as a hint of heat from the peppers. I also get some of the earthiness from the chilies as well as some nice chili flavor. The chocolate and chili notes meld very well together, with just the right amount of heat and sweetness. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very nice stout and I am glad more and more breweries are brewing beers similar to this one."
"I would say this is really an interesting brew and worth trying out. It's well done and I'm always a fan of breweries doing new things!"
""
"O: Solid different beer. Would try again"
