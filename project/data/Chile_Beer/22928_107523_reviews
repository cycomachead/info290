"This beer is clearly not fir everyone, which includes me personally. The look is just fine, but even before hitting the lips the smell burns your nostrils, I couldn't make it more than three sips in"

"The nose is chili and green peppers, peppercorns, sweet malts, very spicy heat coming off the smell.  The flavor is similar, more Tabasco than vegetal peppers, a little vinegar.  The finish is really thin, oily, and a little seltzer like.  This is super hot, really intense."
"One of the greats, so unique and delicious."

"Will not please everybody, but for this chili head, the heat is about spot on and this offering is quite enjoyable"

"O: This is an interesting beer that contrasts flavors of sweet malts with spicy chili peppers. The peppers seem to get a little stronger as the beer warms up but are in no way overpowering. It has a good balance for a chili beer."
