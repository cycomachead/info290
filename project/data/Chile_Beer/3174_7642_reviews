"My first chili beer on tap at the Brew Pub. You can definitely taste the chills and feel them in your lips. I liked this beer."

"Reviewed from my notes dated 1/5/12"
"mouthfeel - all pepper, thin body, hardly any carbonation"
"Completely underwhelming and kind of gross."
"On tap at the brewpub, I had a five ounce glass of this which was plenty. Golden yellow with a couple bubbles on top. The smell was really good, all peppers, reminded me of sniffing nachos covered in jalapeños. The taste was mostly peppers with some heat to it. I thought this was well executed for a chile pepper beer but I still couldn't see myself drinking a whole pint of this."
"Ring of Fire Burger. Poured a clear golden yellow with a lingering ring of white foam. Aromas of hatch chilies, serranos, jalapenos and light straw. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry warming finish. Flavors of hatch chilies, jalapenos and serranos with a smooth dry waming lingering chili finish."
"D: If you like a Chili Beer, you'll probably like this. I found it to be a nice example of the style. The appearance was the only glaring weakness here. More of a novelty to me than a beer I'd order again."
"I really like this, but I can definitely understand how someone could hate it."
"Same goes with taste. Chile is dominant but not overbearing. A slight hot-spice hits at the end, but calms down to more of a floral finish. A bit sweet at first before the chile comes out. Still a bit thin, but I think that's good. I'd hate to have a thick chile coating. Very nice."
"D - Actually pretty damn good. I thought that I would hate it, and it's not something that I would really buy again, but I'm glad that I gave it a shot. This is actually a drinkable chili beer!"
"Had with lunch at the brewpub. Color is gold, with almost no head. Looks like a normal beer until you get close enough to smell it. The aroma is completely green chili - very inviting if you are as big of a fan of green chili as I am! Taste starts out with just a bit of grain, and then the green chili kicks in. It isn't overly hot, but has a very powerful green chili flavor. I enjoyed this beer, but it is definitely more chili than beer. Also seems like a recipe for heartburn if you drank more than one."
"Clear yellow-hay hue, bright white head of a finger in height, it looks very much like a Pils. The head retention was very good, surprisingly so, and there was a fair amount of webby lacing. So far, so good. Then I took a whiff. Chili pepper. Heat. Nothing more. It is not my cup of beer really; the potency was strong and not inviting for me. Regardless I took a sip. Chili pepper flavor upfront and a good amount of heat in the back, it was too much for me. Ive had two other beers of this sort, one was restrained and good, Jaipurs Jalapeño Ale (3.15) and the other was the infamous Crazy Ed's Cave Creek Chili Beer (1.00), not so good. Sigda's Green Chili is some where in the middle. I was difficult to pinpoint the mouthfeel, it was around medium-light with moderate carbonation, it wasnt watery or oily; that is a plus. I cant say it was very drinkable, Im glad I sampled it just to get a better grasp on this style. I wouldnt recommend this to anybody but a Chili-Head."
"This been is flavorful with just enough chili zip to make you notice. To me it was like an IPA but instead of the bitterness of hops you have the chilis front and center. A delicious brew..."
"Flavor: This is where you need to have some enchiladas to pair with this. It would be good w/ food, but a disaster otherwise. This is a nicely done chili beer. I liked the chili flavor, but it's not something you can drink alone, IMO."
"By all appearances, a standard pilsner. But the aroma, taste and mouthfeel are dominated by the acrid chili taste, masking any sensation that this might actually have been brewed. Save your money and just drink the juice from a can of green chilies -- it tastes about the same."
