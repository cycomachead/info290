4.11,14.8,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"First off, the bottle on this one is a keeper. I don't typically keep my empties, but this one is just too perfect to not keep on display. I didn't really get much on the nose aside from your regular roasty stout aromas, but the taste is where it really comes across well. First off, it's a perfectly solid base stout, probably one of the tastier and more balanced stouts I've had in recent memory, so Rogue totally got that right. When it comes to the spice element, it's not overbearing in the least and it marries nicely with the roastiness of the stout. I was a bit worried before tasting, only because Sriracha definitely has a more unique spice/sweetness profile that I wasn't sure would work like your average chile beer, but this one does it. The heat and spice doesn't overshadow the stout itself and the stout doesn't take away from the heat and spice. It's a perfect balance of flavors in my mind and this is a hot beer that I'd glad go back to again.","edicius","Monday at 05:00 PM"

3.14,-12.3,3.5,3.25,3,3.5,3,"Dammit, how could I not try this stuff?  It pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger or so of tan foam.  The nose comprises roasted malts, mild coffee, and the vaguest possible hint of Sriracha sauce (though this one might be psychosomatic).  The taste brings in more of the same, though after the finish a wave of peppery heat lines my throat.  Not much flavor mixing here, which keeps things from devolving into crazily bad things happening on my tongue.  The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, this could have been a helluva lot worse than it turned out to be.  It's basically a meek, basic stout that happens to hold some pepper heat buried within it.  Nothing godawful, but nothing really worth drinking again, either.","TMoney2591","Saturday at 06:00 PM"

The more I sip it, the more spice I pick up. Great balance, I thought it was going to be a fire-bomb. Creamy, smooth feel, with moderate carbonation and a tickling spiciness lingering on far back of tongue. A little chewy. Nice, quality brew!

There's also a lot of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some smokiness and Sriracha/peppers.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the Sriracha/pepper heat is stronger in comparision to the aroma.  With that being said, this brew isn't quite as spicy as I thought it would be but I think it's nice and tasty.  It does have a good kick to it, and it is spicier than most chile beers I've tried.  However, the spiciness isn't overpowering and it doesn't linger around for a real long time.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has a nice amount of carbonation and it's easy enough to drink.

Finishes by covering my mouth and throat with a bowl of jalapeños.  Not too spicy to handle, but definitely doesn't leave room for beer flavor, and I'll probably be drinking this pretty slowly for the rest of the night.

Smells like chocolate, coffee and a hint of pepper or spice.  Tastes oddly unlike it's name.  Traditional coffee stout on the front but you do get that sriracha hot sauce flavor on the back end and aftertaste.  I certainly couldn't drink more than a glass.  Not bad.  Not great.","uvachief","Mar 06, 2015"

My expectations for hot sauce-enabled foodstuffs are rather stringent, i.e. lots of it, but don't be stupid about it, and I believe that they've more or less got it right here.  Maybe the base stout (Shakespeare?) could be a tad sweeter in its balancing effort, but whatever, it works.","biboergosum","Mar 05, 2015"

Not a knock at all, just takes me to that place. Plenty of malt with a little heat at the end. Flavor and heat lingers on the tongue for a few minutes. Definitely in a pleasant way.

Roasted flavors, hint of garlic and smoke, and then a spicy kick at the end. Decent stout feel here.  Man, I was very apprehensive about this going in, and it's weird, but oddly satisfying.
