"IPA 1st with a great pepper after taste not spicy, very good"
""
"Copper orange body with a small off-white head. Aromas of citrus and hops. Spicy peppers emerge more as the beer warms a bit. Jalape√±o blends nicely into the flavor profile, rather than overpower. An interesting beer. Fun to try. Best in small quantities."

"Was not really impressed with this beer. Had higher hopes as I have liked some of their other beers. The color was nice, there was no real smell that I would expect with a pepper beer. Was not able to pull any of the pepper taste from the beer. As for the IPA beer itself, I would consider it just average."

"Overall this is a pretty interesting twist on the double IPA style. The base brew is a nice recipe and the jalapeno infusion is done well."
"Overall, this was my first chile beer to review and it won't be my last. I am looking forward to ABC putting this out again."

"Overall this is quite drinkable, though it would be much better with less sugary taste. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at QFC Market in the Seattle University shopping center."

"Pours with a proper tan head. Color is amber with hues or orange at the edges. Aroma consists of subdued citrus hops and surprisingly aromatic jalapeno notes. The jalapeno seems to overpower on the tongue a bit at first but some citrusy hops and sweet malt ride in to save the day. Medium bodied and mostly smooth. I must admit for reasons of transparency, that I'm not a big fan of jalapenos, but wanted to give this one a go to see how it worked. Despite my aversion to aforementioned pepper, I thought the beer was well-crafted and well balanced with no signs of contrivance."

"Overall, me thinks it's a good brew that could have been close to awesome if it tasted like it smelled. Sorry to harp on that."

"If you love the flavor of fresh Jalapeno you should love this beer. Would be great as a cooking beer with all the great flavors it has."

"Overall, nothing overpowering in the spice category, but a nice little kick. The jalepenos really stand out here and make it so it is tough to find other flavors."

"o: this is a solid effort to make a jalapeno beer. it looks like a beer and tastes like a beer. i would prefer more hoppiness in the taste with a little more subtle jalapeno flavoring. this is a good beer"

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium bronze amber with a fine, one finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Mild aroma of neutral malt, light grassy hops and a hint of hot pepper that is more soapy than tingling. Flavor of bready malt, light citrus, light stone fruit with building hop bitterness and hot pepper, finishes with a lingering mild, but distinctive jalapeno pepper flavor and light burn. Medium bodied. A mild mannered chile beer with a malt body that is closest to an amber, with interesting, but not distinctive chile pepper esters and a mild hotness. Surprising lack of hop flavor, although there is a moderate hop bitterness in the finish. Kind of misses the mark for an imperial IPA, but satisfactory for a light chile beer. Pleasant, but not memorable."

"It's not a good thing when appearance gets the highest score of all the categories. This beer is pretty average. Well made, I suppose, but it just doesn't have a whole lot going on in the hop department, and they are calling this an Imperial IPA. I don't expect to drop bomber price cash on this again. I don't even know that I would recommend trying it once. I have to, it's my closest regional brewery. I had heard it was ""pretty good", but I would say ""it's okay."" Maybe a little better than okay, but not worth $9 a bomber with so many better DIPAs on the shelves."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and jalapeno aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and jalapeno flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a jalapeno presence that adds aroma and flavor without any discernible heat."

"4/3.5/3.75/3.75/3.75"
"I was apprehensive buying this because I haven;t had much luck with Alaskan bombers but the thought of jalapeno and IPA was just so tempting. I'm actually glad I bought this even though it will be a one and done purchase. Color was orange, great head. Aroma was jalapeno pepper, strong jalapeno pepper. Flavor was pretty much the essence of a jalapeno pepper with a bit of bubblegum and citrus from the IPA trying to peek through. This also had no heat to it at all that I could detect. Overall a very interesting take and a worthwhile purchase."
"Served in a standard pint glass, the pour produced a decent head but didn't last particularly long. A light copperish color that didn't impress, but wasn't defective. The smell is what you would expect. A pepper nose mixed with citrus and a bit of grass? The taste was solid. I'm not a big chile beer guy, but the mix of hops and pepper was somewhat interesting. Felt pretty good in the mouth with good body and a lively finish. Overall is was a solid beer. Not extremely interesting aside from the pepper notes that you would expect. Definitely better than something like cave creek."

"Overall: A pretty solid combination of a imperial IPA and Chili beer. Big citrus and pine notes with a big but not overwhelming heat from the pepper."
""
"eh.... chile beer? very weak. jalapeno, I suppose, is... just a novelty ipa with some chile added to it. crummy commercial beer color, minimal head. decent ipa, I suppose but could use some more heat. don't they have anything stronger in Alaska? I can dig the heat, but there is very little of it. prefer a bit more..."

"A very respectable IPA but lacks the depth of a DIPA and/or a chili beer. Among other things, the smell is excellent for an IPA, I just expected to get some sort of chili scent and the chili flavor is extremely subdued. So, for a beer advertising itself as a jalapeno featured chili beer, this falls way short. As a standard IPA, this thing is pretty damn good. As a DIPA, it lacks some of the extreme punch one might expect. But you can't get around how generally tasty and flavorful this brew is, so that's why I gave it some relatively high ratings in some areas. Worth checking out and making your own opinions."

"Overall: Until I let this open up a bit more, I was going to give this a much lower score since the pepper didn't show up right away. But... after letting this open up, it REALLY is good! Sometimes, folks, patience pays off with these unique beers."

"Apparently this one is un-retired as the bottles are quite fresh."

"Clear amber, lots of bubbles. Small foam off-white head. Nose is spicy jalepeno seeds. Taste works surprisingly well. It's a nice balance of gentle jalepeno juice with nice lingering hops. Unique and mildly spicy. Solid mouthfeel and drinkability. Probably the most creative beer Alaskan makes."
"Sample in the Alaskan tap room. The beer pours a clear orange-amber color with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly. Stringy lacing. Aroma of hops and fresh peppers. Medium-bodied with a solid hops foundation and the jalapeno pepper flavor more subtle than expected. Touches of sweet malt here and there as well. The finish is bitter with a slight pepper aftertaste. I am honestly a little gunshy with chili beers (as anyone who has ever tried Cave Creek will attest). Still, while I appreciate the experimentation that goes into a beer like this, it is not something I would go out of my way to try again."
"Overall: Very unique beer that was a wonderful suprise. I did not think peppers and beer went together until I had this beer. The previous pepper beers I had tried were among the worst tasting beers ever made. I like what Alaskan Brewing did with this one. It's great, drink it if you happen to find yourself in Alaska. It's a bronze medal winner, and from what I hear pretty hard to find."
