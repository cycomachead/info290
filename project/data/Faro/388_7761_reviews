"Clearly a spontaneous fermented base with sweet caramelized notes."

"O - Not like any other beer that I have had. But well recommended. Easily the best Faro that I have had to date."

"A finger uneven white head from the hand pull when delivered to my seat,quick dissipation to uneven bubble size broken head. Deep gold clear body no visible carbonation ala cask. A bit sweet in the nose, a surprise. Taste is certainly on the sweet side of the rest of Cantillon products, big ass funk, wet hay, tart not sour. Mouthfeel well on the light side, no effervescence. Glad I was able to try this rare unbottled treat, but on to bigger and better things. Worth a try for the ticker (which I'm not)."

"My first faro. Pours burnt orange with one finger of persistent off-white head. Interesting mix of sweet, sour and bitter. A bit look like a candied grapefruit. Interesting to say the least. Seems like initially the flavors don't blend very well, but if you hold it in your mouth for awhile, it comes together. Lots of lemon/grapefruit, with an initial burst of sugar. Finish is quite bitter. Certainly would not want to have this very often, but very glad I tried it."

"That was good to try. Being less intense as other Cantillon's, it might be a good starter to somebody trying to work their way into the brand."
"Served on-cask at Moeder Lambic Fontainas on 4/7/2013. Pours a burnt orange hue with a fluffy, 2.5 inch bright white head. Nose smells a bit like feet, followed by a sweet quality. Taste starts of sweet, somewhat akin to caramelized sugar, followed by an earthy/herbal quality, citric acid and some medicinal notes towards the back with a hint of artificial sweetener at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a still carbonation; however, there is a bit of substance to body as well as a slightly creamy texture. Overall, this beer is good for what it is - a sour beer infused with candi sugar. Not a beer I need to revisit, but I found it considerably better than my first impression of the style (Lindemans)."

"Easy to drink as there is no sourness, but it loses a lot of the best characteristics of most Cantillon beers."

"The beer is light copper hued with a half inch of head. The aroma is funky and smells like cantillon, with the addition of some sweet, fruity tones. These scents carry over into the flavor. Sweet, but not cloying, with tartness and funk playing supporting roles. Light bodied and fizzy on the palate, with lingering sweetness, reminiscent of a soda. I'm not a huge fan of faros, but this is likely the best I have had in the style."

"O - A strange beer in regards to aromas and flavor. Not very pleasant to me. I will not seek it out again. I love the brewery and the tour, but this beer is not one I could love, despite my best effort."

"Overall: I admit that this isn't my favorite style, but I enjoyed this one enough. The sweet and bitter is weird when combined this way."

"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a bit sugary and a pear fruitiness. In the taste, just like the aroma, a bit sugary and pears, but not too sweet at all. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry tart fruitiness in the aftertaste. WOW! Love it all day, sour and a nice fruitiness with a dry end."
"Pour yields a brew that looks a bit like apple cider with a few bubbles. No real head or lacing, but that's normal for the style, so I won't dock there. The nose is slightly cidery with some earthy must. Maybe must more than cider. A bit of funk. Light sweetness comes in during the taste. Light body with a faint bit of sugar and mild funk. No real acidity. Nice enough to try, but I'd much rather have the young lambic without the sugar."
"B-"
"Good body despite the low (no) carbonation, I guess the sugar reverts many attributes to the mean. I liked this, very happy to try it, but it's not something I'm likely to reach for again. I really prefer the more sour creations."
"O: Of the few faros out there, this is one of the better ones."
"D: extremely drinkable like any Cantillon, I suppose, could never get enough"
"D. pretty drinkable."
"pour was chestnut with a smallhead that quicklz dissipated. now was herbal funk like that of old chamomile tea that had been sitting out. it had an interesting zest of herbs that was backed by a interesting sweet. a bit astringent... but more sweet. seemed like a digestive aid. it was a tad on the tart but it was a smooth flavor with a backbone of sugar. a bit sweet to have more than 250ml. but still an intersting experience."
"As I've had just one other Faro, I don't have much to compare this to. This is easier to drink than Boon's, hence the 3.5 ratings, but that's not much of a recommendation."
"D- This is wonderfully drinkable- it actually seems to be wonderfully thirst-quenching as well! Drinkable on this cool afternoon in March, and I can only wonder how lovely it would be on a hot Summer afternoon!"
"The beer poured dead flat. Not a bubble could be found and there wasn't a trace of lacing. The body was a dark amber, almost chestnut color. The aroma was quite mead like with strong apricot notes. In fact, I could have easily been convinced that this was an apricot mead I was drinking. The taste started like the nose - honey and apricot sweetness but that gave way to an oaky center and a interesting funky finish. Characteristic Cantillon funk was there but the strongest note was of cream. In fact, this beer left an aftertaste in my mouth long after each sip similar to half and half and reminded me of working on a dairy farm. This trait was also quite similar to something I have found in some Drei Fonteinen beers and is very pleasant. An excellent and highly unique experience."
"Very easy to drink, pairs easily with about any food. My third favorite faro (#1 is Grardin, #2 is Drie Fonteinen)"
"bitterness? not any... It's a lambic... it's really lactic... perfectly lactic... and the sweetness of the candy make it just perfect to be drunk again and again... with or withour foods... it's perfect"
"The beer poured a light golden color with just a few bubbles around the edge, no carbonation but that is to be expected with how the beer was served and the style. The aroma was sweet, not really candy sweet but borderline. Not as sweet as other Faros in Belgium. The taste was sweet up front but there was some of the trademark Cantillon tartness that balanced this beer out very well. Although not my favorite lambic style but I find it very interesting and everytime I can find one, I go after it."
"Overall: This was my first experience with a Faro. The lack of carbonation was a little odd and the sweetness was a little much, but I was pleased with how the lambic characteristics weren't completely masked my the addition of sugars and caramel."
"Faro truly is an aquired taste. A taste that I have yet to aquire. Faro is unblended lambic in which caramel and candy sugar is added during bottling time. I believe that Cantillon uses 1 1/2 year old lambic when making this one. I sampled this at Spinnekopke in Brussels, Belgium."
"Notes: Definitely interesting. It was like a lambic for people who couldn't handle the real thing. Candi sugar hides all the wonderful aromas and flavors of the real lambic, but it was a nice dessert accompanyment."
"Enjoyed at the in t' Spinnekopke in Brussels. I ordered a Kriek Sorbet and Faro for desert... the Sorbet was SO very tart that this sugary sweetness was a perfect match for it. A DARK carmelly-brown looking liquid that was completely still. Sugary sweet in the aroma and taste. I don't think I could drink more than one on its own, but honestly this perfectly offset the tartness of my desert. Worth searching out in Brussels, though mainly for it's traditional and unique character. Look here for a nice picture: http://gallery.truthbrew.com/brussels2004/DSCN6248"
"When at Cantillon the other week, I was chatting to Mr. Van Roy about where I could sample the draught lambic and faro. He said that no lambic was in Brussels right now, but that the Faro could be found at the Le Zageman lambic cafe in Brussels. So, we walked to Le Zageman and ordered two dimpled mugs of Cantillon Faro for 2 euros a piece. The brew was a dark red colour with no head. The aromas were of Cantillons funky lambicy gueuze, mixed with some sweet candy sugar. The taste was very refreshing. This still had a bunch of lambic funk, and some nice malt to it, but the candy sugar really made this an easy-to-drink, thirst quencher. The mouthfeel is flat, but it lends itself well to this style of beer and the drinkability was very, very excellent! I'm glad that I got to try this...in a very authentic Brussels cafe, no less!"
"OK, I was glad to see other reviews say there is no carbonation in this one, because I thought maybe there was something wrong. Or maybe there's always something wrong. I had a glass of this in the only place one could find it in Brussels last week, Zageman, according to Mr. Van Roy. It was a light brownish colour, no head since it was flat, it smelled sweet and tart, pretty nice actually. It tasted almost like sweetened iced tea actually, had that tart lemony taste, and very sugary. I liked it. Not funky as Cantillon usually is with their other beers. Mouthfeel was just flat, strange to me for a beer, but interesting none-the-less. So drinkability is good, because it's obviously not filling and it's quite refreshing! I was happy to have found this one, definitely."
" This strangely enough tasted similar to a lightly sweetened herbal tea. Quite flat, a bit astringent, and with a pleasing herbal and flowery character to it. This is the only sweetened offering from Cantillon, and I believe it is only availible from the Brewery, where they add a bit of sugar to it just before serving."
"I sampled this lambic at the Cantillon Brewery. For my first faro, I knew to expect sweetness, but not this much. The beer pours a distinctive glowing golden hue with absolutely no head whatsoever. Carbonation is nowhere to be found, as this one is flat. Candy sugar is present in the nose and certainly in the taste. To me, this one tasted like flat Sprite as it was very syrupy. This is one of Cantillon's more limited offerings, however I don't have much interest in trying it again."
"Cantillon Faro is therefore unique, and really quite rare these days."
