"Very clear bronze body and very little head to speak of. Lots of visible bubbles. Smells and tastes an awful lot like apple juice/mass produced cider, sweet and fruity with just the lightest touch of acidity and funk. Not really what I want in a faro; it's just not beery enough. More like a wonky alcopop. That said, it's not unpleasant and quite easy to drink, in a Pimm's cup kind of way. Possible food pairings: goat cheese and caramelised onions, pulled pork, roast duck, chicken and waffles, hummus."

"Overall - An interesting beer, kind of like a green candy apple. Okay to try once, but not something I'd seek out again."

"Overall - First of style, and a little too sweet for this palate. Unsure if it would get more complex as 2014 approaches. Leaves me overall unsure. Nice overall flavours for 4% tho..."

"Amber-brownish colour, Light collar of white head, minimal lace. Smell is funky and yeasty, sour apple and lemon, candy like sweetness similar to Sweet Tarts or candy apple, decent acidity. Taste is sweet and quite sugary, light tart apple flavour, funky and acidic with light balsamic, lemon and more sweet sugars. Medium carbonation, medium body. I get that this should be sweet but its a bit much even a 250ml bottle was too much for me, perhaps this is someones cup of tea but it is certainly not mine."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body with carbonation of low intensity, resulting in a smooth beer that marginally foams up as it crosses the palate. Still enjoyable, however, as the minimal tartness keeps it flowing easily. Finish is expectedly dry, from sugar and acids."

"Slightly funky nose, brett?. Lots of pilsner like foamy head on light yellow to white. Slightly less than medium mouthfeel. Candi sugar, European dry hops, a touch of lemon.Carbonation still there(good to 2014). Drinkable, but too sweet.Bonus from Phyl21."
"Wow. It's been quite some time since I've gotten that lambic nose. The flavor profile is oh so nice. The last time I had a faro was some time ago, so my recollection of the style is hard to go on from here, but this seems so good. Interesting balance. I wonder if this is one of, if not the, least understood beer styles out there."

"It tastes like apple juice a little bit. Thin and sweet with a fruitiness, not good, I drank the whole thing, but I won't ever have it again."
"Very well carbonated, oppressively sweet."
"Breakfast, brunch, lunch, aperitif or dessert beer ... the Faro is quite versatile. Not an easy beer to put down if you have a sweet tooth."
"Quite good."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy medium brown color lambic with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of candi sugar with a lightly tart dubbel base. Taste is a weird mix between some Belgian malt with some easily noticeable candi sugar and a light tart and oak finish. Body is somewhat thin with good carbonation. OK but not something I would seek again."
"Drinkability : a good refreshing beer in the style Faro"
