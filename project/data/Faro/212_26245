3.38,-1.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall. I had this for dessert and I think that's the perfect time for this one. I couldn't see myself enjoying it as much on a camping trip morning or after some exercise.","Rutager","Mar 16, 2008"
3.08,-9.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"The taste has an initial tart kick with an overall green apple sweetness. The sweetness is pretty overpowering and really leads to a cloying, overly sweet mouthfeel that makes this one tough to drink.","gford217","Dec 22, 2007"
2.95,-13.7,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Overall, goes down easy but teh sock background flavor becomes mroe pronounced the more you drink and the more the beer warms. By the second bottle I had had enough.","atigerlife","Jul 29, 2007"

3.97,16.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This was a 250ml bottle that I got at Delirium Caf√© while on my faro kick in Belgium. They are definitely a great style but very difficult to find stateside. This particular beer has a dark amber color but is very clear. It initially has a good head but it falls quickly. The aroma is very sweet but with that typical gueuze sourness in the background. I really like the contrast between the two aromas. The taste is sweet on the tongue while simultaneously sour on the glands in my neck, causing them to tingle. There is also an appley flavor hidden in there giving this an almost cidery feel. As with the aroma, the contrast between the two flavors is great. This is a very drinkable beer all around and although not the best faro I had, a very good beer.","drseamus","May 08, 2006"
3.53,3.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a clear medium orangey color faro with a big foamy head with quite good retention. Aroma of sugar with some tart and sourness. Taste is quite sweet which is kind of expected for faro with more tart and sourness and overall complexity then expected from this brewery. Overall, this was better then expected since this brewer is not know for following the traditional lambic way.","Phyl21ca","Nov 06, 2005"

3.51,2.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Definitely worth a try and I would probably recommend a bottle of this over the Lindeman's Faro which I have also had but in Belgium.","ggaughan","0"
