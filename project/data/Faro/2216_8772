4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer is copper to amber in color and mildly hazy with virtually no head. The aroma is sweet and sugary, with some malt, yeast, and lambic scents lingering in the background. Smells true to style. Sugary and sweet, I couldn't see having more than one in a session. Light and refreshing, with some fruity malt character. hints of tartness and yeast. It's true, I am not a huge fan of the style (I much prefer traditional lambic), but this is well done for what it is. Certainly worth a try if you have the opportunity.","Huhzubendah","Mar 29, 2012"

4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Sampled on tap at the Drie Fonteinen restaurant with lunch. What a wonderful find as the style is hard to find and on tap ever more so. Beer was served with a copper color and just the slightest amount of bubbles on the edge of the glass but there was no carbonation at all on this one which is due to the fact of how it is served. The aroma was sweet with some slight acidic notes as well. Taste was sweet but not overpowering. Refreshing and just a hint of tart but sweet was the overall tone of this beer and made for a great lunch beer.","ggaughan","Beers"
