"People with a sweet tooth will enjoy this, tasty candi sugar, but probably way too syrupy sweet for most of the people."

"No head on a very clear copper body. No lace either. Aroma of pungent turpentine, nail polish remover, candied fruit, apricot, resins. Flavor is tough at first, need a little preparation with the flavor being very bitter sweet with tart candied citrus, caramel, pine resin. Light body and carbonation. First faro for me. Not a fan. Too sweet and syrup like. Can't really judge it for the style"

"O: This beer is sweet, but the sweetness is not cloying so it isn't that difficult to drink. It tastes like a sweetened lambic without that much in the way of fruity flavors."
""
"OV: This is the second Faro Lambic (Lindemans being the other) I've had and I've enjoyed them both. This is well balanced between the sweet and sour, the flavours blend well together though none of them are bold. This is a good sipping beer. Like I said, beers like this tend to be polarizing and I'm glad to be on the side that can appreciate this beer."

"Poured from a 350 ml bottle into a fluted glass. This pours a brownish color with a small fizzy extremely short lived off white head (only a few seconds, perhaps the shortest lived I've ever seen). It smells of vinegar, funk and a little sugar malts. The feel is thinish. The taste is okay, you get some funk, sour notes, vinegar with a load of sugar to combat everything but way too sweet."
""
""
"Beer is light to light-medium in body with minimal carbonation, a bit watery, resulting in the beer moving fairly slowly, but still enjoyably so on the palate. Finish is expectedly dry, from sugar and acids."

"Probably a good accompaniment to any fruit pie, but I enjoyed it all by itself as well. I'll be back for more of this."

"I have such a headache."
"O= This is my first faro and it's not bad. A little too sweet but it has good flavor. I would for sure try other faros but I may not try this one again."
"O- I like this a bit better than soda pop but it is in the same camp. The sweetness gets to be a bit to much after half a glass, but it is still a bit softer than other faros I have had. My wife, who only drinks diet coke, enjoyed this beer."
"Fail."
"It is sweet, but not as bad as I was expecting. Drinkable, you just have to be ready for it."
"D: To me, faro is the stepping stone between fruity lambics and the good stuff. I think this falls into that category, but just barely. It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly saccharine, and the tartness helps that."
"I have to say that I really dig the flavor here. Apart from that, I think the beer is just above average overall. This makes me want to seek out more lambics as this one seems to be rated quite a bit lower."
"Notes: Possibly the most unique beer I've had to date"
"Faro numero dos. Who'da thunk it, eh? W0rd. It pours a clear tawny amber topped by a fleeting half-finger of glowing off-whit foam. The nose comprises funky oak, light sour cherries, rum raisin cake, dank greens, brown sugar, and light white vinegar. Sweet and sour sauce ain't got shit on this, what! The taste does away with most of the sour notes, though some very subtle vinegar and tart black cherries remain fairly unfazed. The grand coalition, though, is composed of the brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, maple syrup, and candi sugar. The body is a smooth medium, with a light carbonation and a slightly sticky finish. Overall, I wasn't sure what to expect here, but this was overtly drinkable. I want more."
"This beer pours a deep orangish amber hue with no head. The smell is of oak, rum raisin, bit of vinegar and cheddar cheese for some reason. The taste is a bit of white grape, some oak flavor, and raisin (without the rum). The taste isn't foul, but it's kinda weak in my opinion. Has a nice light champagne feel to the palate and is pretty easy to drink. Not bad for something that I thought I wouldn't like. Though overall it by style is still more wine like than beer."
"Interesting but tough to drink."
"D: This beer could have actually been pretty decent if it wasn't for the chemical nature of it."
"The beer is mostly clear and see-through, with small chunks of sediment wandering aimlessly throughout the beer. The color is a light orange sunburst. The beer has a small head that leaves just a touch of lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and fruity, like a fruit juice. The beer tastes very sweet, though I suppose this was the intention. Personally, I can't fathom why one would take a sour beer and intentionally make it sweeter. To each their own. Surprisingly, the sweetness is not as cloying as I predicted. The body is medium-thin with a low level of carbonation. It was a fun experience, but I much prefer the traditional lambics over faros. From an objective standpoint, this was a pretty good beer."
"I said this about the Lindemann's faro and its about the same for this, it tastes a little like apple juice. Its sweet and fruity, its not cloying but it does taste kind of like fruit juice. Beer is thin and has almost no carbonation in the mouth. It tastes fine its just sweet and nothing else, kind of boring. I'm sure this is what this beer is suppose to taste like but its just not that great. I'll keep trying faros, as possible as that will be but the two i've had so far have been rather unimpressive. I would however try this again if it were on draft somewhere."
"Tasted from bottle purchased at Binny's Lincoln Park. Pours a muddy brown-orange with an average white head that recedes to decent lace. Nose of nutty brown sugar with some funk and a smell similar to rye bread. Flavor is caramel with some toastiness, light funk, moderate sour flavors, and nuttiness. Body is medium with average carbonation and a short sour and nutty finish."
"Very, very blunt this one is."
"The aroma on this one is definitely a bit objectionable because of the excessive sweetness, the flavor isn't quite as bad, but it is not something I really want to try again."
"Drinability is good. Seems to be meant to be sipped, and as that, it drinks well."
"D: Fairly drinkable due to the light flavor and lack of intense sourness, although it is held back by the sugar intensity."
"D - This brew is easy enough to drink, actually, due to its juice/soda similarities, but it doesn't taste very good, so why bother. As soon as I realized it was not-so-good, I just downed the whole bottle like I was shotgunning a Keystone Light. On to the next (drastically better) brew..."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dark burgundy color lambic with a small foamy head with light retention and no lacing. Aroma of syrup and sugar is somewhat gross with light oak notes and no funky notes. Taste is also dominated by gross sugar and syrup with limited complexity from the oak or the base lambic. Body is full with minimal complexity and a minimal carbonation."
"Pours a hazy brown color. Smell is a bit funky with vinegar tones and a little bit of sugar. The taste is initially very sweet, tart, and funky. Medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Interesting beer although."
"An interesting beer. I doubt I will try too many more faros due to limited availability, but I thought this was a pretty good beer."
"D- one and done. probably wont be revisiting this one, its just way too sweet. glad to say that ive gotten the chance to try a faro."
"Pours an unattractive brownish orange color with no head. ""Garbage juice"" was a common description of the aroma at the tasting where this beer was had. Garbage juice and herbal bitters, maybe some hobo. Oddly intriguing nonetheless. Flavor is sugary fruit punch with only a hint of the gross herbal note from the aroma. Why?"
"Overall: Very different. Never had this style before so can't bash it too bad. Too sweet and sugary for my tastes. Also some very strange tastes and smells. Really had to reach into my memories to figure these out."
"Drinkability was impressive. This is a super refreshing, flavorful and easy-drinking lambic. It is far more complex and far less cloying than many of the other sweetened versions on the market. I could imagine this making for a terrific after-dinner drink."
"drinkability is decent. much too sweet to be very drinkable. soft on the palate , but finishes with a candy-like sweetness. decent, but not drinkable."
"Oh, yum...whatever trepidation I had with the aroma vanished the instant I tasted this delicious concoction. Sweet Belgian candy and a light, almost ginger-like spice sits on the front of the tongue, quickly giving way to caramel-sugary goodness and a strange, almost salty note. Mouthfeel is bubbly and light, with an almost syrupy viscosity from the sugars. Definitely a beer for those with a sweet tooth, this reminds me of the lambics made by Lindemans. Fun to try, and recommended, but probably not a repeat for me."
"I didn't find Chapeau Faro to be terribly complex, but what I did find, a very sweet, interesting beer, was enjoyable nonetheless."
"Overall, god awful. Way too sweet with no other redeeming flavors. Now I know why there are only 13 of these in the database - can't be much demand for it. Avoid and definitely one and done...but at least I got Faro off the list."
"D: A bit tough to decipher at first, challenging to decide whether this is sweet or tart or something else. After a few sips, it really grew on me - refreshing, easy enough to drink and certainly curious. I'd have this again; it's too bad it's a style so hard to find. Big thanks, Deniz!"
"Poured from the bottle into my Zywiec stange. Pours a nice brown color, like most brown ales do. The smell is good, that of candied sugar and the slightest hint of horse blanket. The taste I wish I could say was better than it is. Kind of like an apple cider, but with a little bit of brett shining through in the finish, along with candied sugar. Not bad just wish it wasn't as sweet as it is. My first shot at the style, and think the artifical sweetness in the front taste may be typical to this brewery, for their banana lambic was cloyingly sweet in an artificial way when I had it a while back. The mouthfeel is stickier than a cider however, more like a soda. Not really a bad beer but not great either. The best part of the taste is the finish. It loses points drinkability wise because of the sweetness. I would like to try other examples of this style, however, I would rather have a nice gueze to drink instead."
"Pours out the haziest brown color I've seen. Almost some ruby highlights in there, but its almost too hazy to let any light through. The head was thin from the start, off-white colored, leaving no lacing. This is my first in the style, and I imagine it could be better, I mean, I've seen plenty of lambics that look clearer (still hazy of course, but they let light through) and nicer. Looks kind of like an actively fermenting beer (without the krausen). The smell is wonderful. Reminds me of the best lambics and sours I've smelled. A bit fruity and sugary, with a huge sour smell. Not too acidic in the nose, a bit vinegar, kind of powdery. Reminds me a bit of sour candy, but smells light and crisp. The taste is really great. There's immediately the flavor of apple cider, which this kind of looks like. Then comes the sour, there's a delightful tartness playing with the sweetness, but I keep coming back to apples. Kind of one-dimensional, which makes it a bit less interesting to drink, but I'm a fan of the sour. I could see this being a beer you drink for an extended session, but I can imagine that the sweetness would get cloying after a while. Just a bit more sour/tart and a bit of lightness would actually help. The carbonation is lightly present, nice, and the wild yeasts keep this one nice and full (the sweetness helps too). Easy to drink, I mean, it pours down like a NA drink, but the sweetness will probably hurt it in the long run."
"I really enjoyed this, and I had some initial doubts due to the strong vinegary nose right out of the bottle. Things quickly settled down. The beer pours a cloudy, well carbonated, murky brown with a smallish off white head, a touch of lacing, some head retention. The nose started out pretty questionable. I thought my bottle had gone bad. It got better once the beer had a chance to aerate. The taste was a real treat. This beer is a close cousin to a Belgian Flemish sour red style ale. The beer has that unique combination of sweet and sour tastes, a wooden perhaps slightly oaken aged tartness, and some very light sherry qualities. The beer is sweet, though, much sweeter than a Flemish Red ale. There are pear flavors, maybe some peach, maybe some other combinations of sweet dessert type fruits. This is an easy drinking beer, very fruity and sweet, with a nice character and loads of complexity. It was a real treat, just don't let the nose turn you off ... drink on."
"Mildly effervescent, and very smooth. It is on the sweet side, though with a sour and woody balance, but not too sticky. A candy-ish treat. Moderate alcohol for a Belgian and with a nice taste, this is very drinkable!"
"Drinkability: Is this what a faro's like? I don't know. It's not terribly drinkable, but I can't say for sure if that's standard, as it's the only one I've ever had. Can't say I was a huge fan on the whole, though - the tastes and aromas were just too whack."
"M + D: A little bite of carbonation over a medium body. I quite enjoyed the flavour, myself, though I could see it as being a love/hate type of thing. I would perhaps be a little more satisfied with a bigger tartness. Not bad."
"Flavor is not nearly as sour or funky as the nose. It's lightly funky, lightly sour, and moderately sweet. Mmm, it's good. Nice balance. There's some malt behind the sweetness, but not a lot. Spotlight is definitely on the yeastiness. Overall flavor magnitude is similar to a soda (not loud and boisterous like some Lambics I've tried). It's rather soft and delicate, especially the sweetness. Mild chocolate and nut notes. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Finishes fairly clean, a little on the sweet side with a soft mouthcoating. Tastes good."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a smooth almost slick quality to it and mellow carbonation. It goes down easily enough. However, I personally am not a fan of the overbearing sweetness that pervades this brew. I need to try more Faro's before writing off the style, however of this one I can say I am not a fan overall."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"Pours a nice hazy golden reddish amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with does leave some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast, some raspberries/strawberries/cherries. The taste is malty, slight yeast, sweet, with just a little bit of sourness. Medium body. Drinkable, I really like this one, thanks Anthony."
"Big thanks to stumac for trading this rare style!"
"This is somewhat hard to judge because its the first time I've ever come across a faro, and I have no idea whether this is true to the style. I can say that I found it to be a very interesting and unique beer. The high sugar content would prevent me from finishing a bottle of this, and for that reason I doubt I would have it again. However, the flavours were very interesting, and the weird funkiness was quite unique. I'm glad I had the experience, and it really opens your eyes to how much variation there is in the world of beer."
"Poured a 33cl bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a raisin brown with almost no head even with a very vigorous pour, and since no head can be disturbed no lacing occurred either. The strange thing is if you swirl the glass, a nice ring of small bubbles breaks the surface of the beer but it never forms a head. The aroma is so tart that it makes the back of your jaw sting. This has a really nice sour/tart/funky aroma with green apples, grape skins and almost a dry merlot aroma. The flavor is the strangest flavor dichotomy I have ever tasted in a beer. It starts out with a green apple/grape skin sourness and then completely melts into a big, raisin sweetness that reminds me quite intensely of the flavor of a quad. It's really strange. I would really like to know how they come about with such a strange flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light and syrupy, with not much carbonation. Reminds me a bit of the mouthfeel of a Kvass. I think that this would be a nice beer to enjoy every 6 months or so but I don't even think that I could even drink one of these every week. This would fall more into the oddity column then the regular column."
"intensely sweet at the start, like a concentrated apple cider. sugar, burnt sugar, apples, and more sugar give way to a slightly woody, oaky, balsamic finish. has a fairly light feel but the sweetness becomes a bit overbearing. a little more balance would go a long way, but this is a not unpleasant drink for dessert."
"Bottle thanks to mmm///beer. My first Faro! Pours a ruby hue with a medium off-white head. The aroma is quite nice; tons of, I guess you would call this fruity notes, somewhat woody and sour. Very pungent for sure. The flavor is also nice; sweet sugary fruity flavors combined with a woody sourness. Some sweet brown sugar and lots of woody flavor. Very odd, a tart cherry/ unripe fruit flavor but also lots of sweetness. A light creamy mouthfeel. Very interesting and nice. Easygoing and yet it made an impact on me."
"Ehh, give me a real lambic anyday. This just tastes like a sweet soda drink, and at $7 I won't be going back to it."
"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts on this one. Each element of this offering may not be spectacular but it makes for an enjoyable effort to savor."
"D - This is a pretty tasty beer while its not one that I could really have more than one in a sitting its a good beer thats worth trying"
"D - Well, I enjoyed it, but if you don't like a sweet beer, you probably won't. All in all, I don't find this too substantively different from a sweeter Flanders Red; it's like a less-vinegary Duchesse. Very easy to drink, again, if you don't mind a sweeter beer. At 4.5%, you could drink it until your sweet tooth gave out."
"This was a drain pour. The first one in a while. I could not even finish the glass. Not reccomended at all."
"Bought a bottle of this from Grapevine Travelers in my home town. This will be my first time trying an example of this Belgian beer. Cork came off without much of a pop, and poured a nice looking burgundy, with a ring of white lace. Red wine vinegar is the first thing that comes to mind in the nose, followed cherries and raspberries. Taste is exceedingly sweet, with a tiny bit of funky sourness. Again, raspberries and cherries come to mind in the taste. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is pretty good, although some might be a little turned off by the sweetness factor. I enjoyed this brew. It almost reminded me of a Flanders Red Ale, and also showed some Oud Bruin character. Glad I had the chance to try a Faro, and will hopefully try a few more in the future. Cheers"
"12.7 fl oz bottle for trade with lb4lb: (Thanks Deniz!) My first faro. The ever elusive faro. I thought it would take me forever to get one of these. Well, it did but lb4lb got me one. Now to the review. Aroma has a very tart sugary aroma to it at first. With some subtle malts, cherries, and sour candy. Pours a dark amber with a medium sized tan head that lingers around for a while. Taste is a lot of sugar that comes right up to and smacks you in the face. Wow! Still tastes like sour candy and some lemon mixed in there as well. On the back end a little bit of roastiness, I have to agree with the reviewer below me. It's like a mouth full of table sugar. If this is indicative of all faro's then I'm not going to go out of my way to get them. Overall, Way too sweet. Glad the lb4lb got it to me, but i guess it's just not my style."
"THX 2 hamburgah for the sample."
"Looks brown sugar and cinnamon powder juice. Very faint headthat slowly recedes to nothing after a coupe of sips. NOt to mention the very tiny bubbles in th beer. The aroma is a funky sweet brown sugar and medium toasted grains. The taste is like a fruitless fruit lambic. Youe get all the swetness, just none of the real distinct fruit flavors. You get lots of candi sugar and brown sugar withcurrant like tartness. Not a bad after dinner beer. Lots of dark toasted malty goodness."
"overall only the second faro ive ever had so im far from an expert. this one was enjoyable but simple. to wet my appetite however, a nice beer."
"Faro isn't such an exotic style after all, it's simply a style that few brewers choose to brew. If you aren't a lambic snob and actually like the sweet fruit 'lambics' on occasion, Chapeau Faro Lambic is worth a purchase."
"Drinkability: I believe this is my first faro. Although, if the patent awfulness of the rest of these Chapeau beers is any indiction whatsoever, it wasn't much of a faro at all. Avoid!"
"i would definately only drink this on rare occasions because of how intensly sweet it is. but i will definately be back for round two eventually."
"Taste is fairly rich and balanced between the vinegar and sugar. Kind of apple-y but more in the tart red variety. Wheat malt is prevalent and aids in the creamy mouthfeel. Prickly carbonation keeps this one moving. A little cloying at times, but overall this is a solid and interesting beer."
"25 cl bottle purchased around Christmas in Bruges or Antwerp, can't remember. The beer poured a dense, brown body with a slight tan head. The nose was a bit acidic/vinegary but also a bit sweet on the nose. The taste is sweet up front but also is rounded out nicely by the acidic taste. Not as sweet as other faros that I have had. Very good."
"Poured into a lambic style, skinny fluted glass. Nice and dark in color, no head on a gentle pour. Smell was complex with earthy notes. Some fruit undertones under the heavier noise (of the earth I was getting), with a sharp, maybe vinegar/acid, smell that was really pleasant. Taste was a nice sweet blend that I was expecting with the style. Finished quick, easy drink ability. Very palette able."
"I haven't had enough faros to know how this compares, but it was okay, though it lacks any complexity or really interesting character. Most likely won't return to this one."
"A tad sweeter than expected, and not too complex, but a good drink none the less."
"Originally reviewed November 23, 2006. 33cL Bottle. Yeast muddle orange and amber, plum fringed, with a rim of white. light aroma of rotting white grapes, with a meaty squeek. Faint lambic edges of oak and sour lactic. Lightly revolting. Sickly sweet white grape candy and some rotting citrus in teh bottom of the fridge dorr. Some dripping honeyish notes, lots of ogrape skins. Far away a grassy wash of lost hop memories. Light efferevesce, but overall destructively sweet and nasty."
"Pours with trace amount of head, settled to a rounding trim. A surprinsingly dark colour. My pour, from the bottom of the bottle has plenty of little, red bits of sediment. Aroma of a healthy Lambic, puckering sourness with overcoating of wild funk. Flavour finishes and starts on a yeasty note. Trace of over ripe apple, a past-due cider, notes of pear, apricot. A thin lambic, very sweet - candi sugar does lend a tremendous sweet finish. This comes through only on the finish. Little yeast bits at the end offer a very floral character. Very floral yeast notes. Very. Overall, bit of hard to discern from other Lambics if not for the telling sweetness, doesn't have the dimension of puckering tartness or complexity in aroma. Largely though, this isn't that much worse. I enjoyed it this rare style."
"Wow! This one was a surprise! This is my first Faro so take that into consideration on the review. I had this one out of a corked and capped bottle about the size of a ""standard"" 16-oz beer. The name and company are correct but it had a different label than posted here. I poured it into a Lindeman's lambic glass. It is a straw-golden color with a good rocky white head that fades at a moderately slow pace. Lots of carbonation rising up the glass. There is pronounced sediment in this lambic, which isn't a turn-off to me. The smell is a musty, spicy, and sweet but light not cloying. The taste was the surprise. Sort of like a lightly sweet and highly carbonated ginger ale. It really gives me a pleasant feeling. It reminds me a bit of the Deus de Flanders but not quite as complex. The sediment was even tasty. The mouthfeel is very fizzy and medium. If it were not so expensive I'd drink this regularly."
"Sampled alongside Lindeman's Faro. The front label had 3.5% abv, but the back label had 4.75%. Chapeau's label is green & brown with a picture of a beer barrel draped with hops and barley - Lindeman's is much more attractive: all black with stylish art deco white lettering. On opening the Lindeman's had more fizz and an immediate strong plummy aroma. Both settle to a brown copper colour with a fringe of bubbly froth - the Lindeman's bubbles slightly larger and more varied. So far the Lindeman's is ahead. On giving both a good sniff the Chapeau edges ahead with its musty sweet aroma, slightly medicinal, slightly licorice, quite perfumey - parma violets; when swirled extra sweetness rises. The Lindeman's has a slight plum aroma; when swirled some yeasty lambic acid rises. On tasting the Chapeau is the more interesting with its sweet and medicinal taste, followed by a soft sweet licorice flavour at the back. However, it flags slightly when the band aid remains in the mouth along with a cloying, clinging sweey coating of the mouth. The Lindeman's is much simpler, and more direct. It is intensely sweet initially, but that soon settles into a balance between sweetness and acidity. The mouthfeel really pushes the Lindeman's into first place. Chapeau has a soft mouthfeel with a barely noticable and soon gone gentle fizz - quite boring. The Lindeman's however has a soft fizzy mothfeel - very gentle like having baby rabbits tickle your mouth. Weee! The conclusion is that Chapeau is a flavoursome and interesting drink, but lacks the fun of Lindeman's despite the fuller and more complex flavours."
