"This one pours a small head, with a very nice amber-copper-tangerine colour. Smell of vinegar, apples (cider), wood. Sour and a bit funky. Not much carbonation, and maybe too light in the palate. Taste of cider, vtoo much sugar, but it keeps some sourness and vinegar notes. Good, though I'd always take a lambic instead."
"The Lambic character seems to have made it less into this than it should have; the aroma is actually entirely devoid of anything resembling Lambic. Not bad and sort of refreshing, b/c it is so clean, but really seems more like sweet tea with fake lemon added than anything; and I am nor really a fan of that."
"Drinkability: One of the few beers where the taste is exceptional, but the mouthfeel is a major detriment. A good beer, but not a great one."
"M/D - Mild tartness and candied sugared sweetness makes this beer too easy to drink. I wish I could find this in my home town so I could enjoy it on a hot and humid Indiana summer day"
"Bottle: Poured a deep orangey color lambic with a small foamy head with not much retention or lacing. Aroma of sour and tart notes with some light funk is surprising - nothing close to actual lambic but still retains some of the characteristics. Taste is quite sweet with some tart notes with some light oak. Not sure why apple juice was added in there but it was not overly noticeable."
"D- Wow in a blind taste test I would swear this is a cider aged in oak with a great yeast. The beer is subtle but has a nice complexity that has a new layer with each sip."
"Golden orange colour with a small white head. Aroma is of sour apples, oak and is a bit funky. Sweet white sugar taste. Lolly-ish, fruity (peach, green grapes), sour, acidic and vinegary with some grainy wheat flavours underneath. Reminiscent of a sweet fruity white wine. Medium bodied and acidic mouthfeel. A sweet, fruity and winey lambic."
