3.71,-2.9,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of grapes, pale malt, tartness, and a strong sour aroma. Fits the style of a Faro. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of grapes, tartness, slight sugar, sweet malt, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, appearance and aromas denote the high sugar levels, but otherwise good aroma, feel, and body.","Tone","Nov 25, 2011"

3.75,-1.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"If you like faro, this one is a good, but not outstanding. Served in a Mort Subite glass with a belgian ""gauffre"" by its side. (by the way, the two goes really nice one with the other!). Reddish in colour with a nice big head that really tempers down the smell. Taste sweet, candied sugar up front. Almost no classical lambic tart felling. Probably, one of the best product of the Mort Subite series. Is this due to rareness? Maybe so... but if you go to this caff√©, have one because it's impossible to have it otherwise.","blaje","Dec 10, 2006"
3.63,-5,3.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Draft on tap at Mort Subite in Brussels over the Christmas holiday. Sampled this beer while sitting at a table back table next to the bars cat. Beer poured a light amber body with a very slight body of carbonation, smooth bod, with a candy sweet nose and taste but not too sugary as I expected. There was also a nice bit of tartness that made for a decent beer.","ggaughan","Aug 23, 2004"
3.27,-14.4,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Sampled at A La Mort Subite in Brussels, it came out a clear cognac color under a one finger white head that dissipates fairly quickly to collar, leaving just a couple spots of lace. The nose is mild of fruit, with clear cherry notes. The mouth is very prickly and slightly heavy, but not at all sticky. Strong cherry flavor overwhelms the malt and nearly eliminates the hops. Sweet and tart at the same time, but the tart wins out, lasting long into the aftertaste. Tasty, but a bit one-sided on the fruit.","Globetrotter","Jun 28, 2004"
3.88,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall this was a very enjoyable lambic, much better and more complex than the mort subite framboise I tasted previously.","CAMRAhardliner","Jun 15, 2004"
3.9,2.1,3.5,3.5,4,2.5,5,"Tap at the Mort Subite Cafe in Brussels. This is a beautiful red colored beer with huge with head. Aroma is mostly sweet with some very subtle touch of malt. Taste is very sweet with a nice touch of oak at the end. The taste is somewhat similar to the kriek. Carbonation is good and body is thin which makes it a very refreshing beer to sip during a hot summer day. Overall, probably one of the best Mort Subite product that I had the chance to taste.","Phyl21ca","Mar 30, 2004"
3.75,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Had to try this while in Brussels. Carmel color rusty brown. Very transparent and clear in the goblet. Slight outer ring to the brew but that is it... not much head or lacing. Caramel in the nose (*sweetness). Light refreshing body and feel with a sparkle on the tongue. Tangy and dry... sweet and then slightly sour in the taste. A dominant caramel taste. Not really rounded or complex but refreshing.","frank4sail","Beers"
3.63,-5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The rare(?) Faro of mort subite, sampled on draught at the mort subite cafe in Brussels. This is a dark reddish colour with a small head of off-white. Aromas are of gueuze funk, sugar, and yeast. The taste is similar with the candy sugar really sticking out. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and the drinkability is pretty good, as this faro is far less sweet than Lindemans version. Of the three faros that I have had i'd rate this above Lindemans, but below Cantillons.","francisweizen","0"
