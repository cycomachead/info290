"This same beer was given an alias for the Brussels’ food month and marathon in 2012. They were calling it “brusselicious” and even bottled it under that name. Each runner received a free bottle. I just got around to drinking mine. It pours with about two fingers of head with a very spread out white lace that sticks around indefinitely. It has a very sweet followed by sour nose. I loved the flavor. It is very similar to the smell. It is almost like grape and apple. It has a very thin feel and is very easy to drink."

"O: ok, pretty much tastes like carbonated pre-school, I feel like I should go take a nap on the floor now."
"Pours clear amber beer with dense white 3-finger head. Some nice laces. Apples (cider-like), oak and aggressive hop in aroma. Excellent light acid apple taste, typical for faro, simple & crisp. Moderate carbonation, dry palate & high drinkability."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Faro (too sweet)."
"Taste is less great being quiet sweet, with lots of cherrycarracter, some sourness, litle grassy majorly spiced but overal a not ""rocking"" lambic styled brew."
