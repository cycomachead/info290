The taste does away with most of the sour notes, though some very subtle vinegar and tart black cherries remain fairly unfazed. The grand coalition, though, is composed of the brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, maple syrup, and candi sugar. The body is a smooth medium, with a light carbonation and a slightly sticky finish.

2.96,-11.9,3,4.5,2.5,3,2,"Poured from the bottle into my Zywiec stange. Pours a nice brown color, like most brown ales do. The smell is good, that of candied sugar and the slightest hint of horse blanket. The taste I wish I could say was better than it is. Kind of like an apple cider, but with a little bit of brett shining through in the finish, along with candied sugar. Not bad just wish it wasn't as sweet as it is. My first shot at the style, and think the artifical sweetness in the front taste may be typical to this brewery, for their banana lambic was cloyingly sweet in an artificial way when I had it a while back. The mouthfeel is stickier than a cider however, more like a soda. Not really a bad beer but not great either. The best part of the taste is the finish. It loses points drinkability wise because of the sweetness. I would like to try other examples of this style, however, I would rather have a nice gueze to drink instead.","rivertrance420","Mar 01, 2009"
3.74,11.3,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours out the haziest brown color I've seen. Almost some ruby highlights in there, but its almost too hazy to let any light through. The head was thin from the start, off-white colored, leaving no lacing. This is my first in the style, and I imagine it could be better, I mean, I've seen plenty of lambics that look clearer (still hazy of course, but they let light through) and nicer. Looks kind of like an actively fermenting beer (without the krausen). The smell is wonderful. Reminds me of the best lambics and sours I've smelled. A bit fruity and sugary, with a huge sour smell. Not too acidic in the nose, a bit vinegar, kind of powdery. Reminds me a bit of sour candy, but smells light and crisp. The taste is really great. There's immediately the flavor of apple cider, which this kind of looks like. Then comes the sour, there's a delightful tartness playing with the sweetness, but I keep coming back to apples. Kind of one-dimensional, which makes it a bit less interesting to drink, but I'm a fan of the sour. I could see this being a beer you drink for an extended session, but I can imagine that the sweetness would get cloying after a while. Just a bit more sour/tart and a bit of lightness would actually help. The carbonation is lightly present, nice, and the wild yeasts keep this one nice and full (the sweetness helps too). Easy to drink, I mean, it pours down like a NA drink, but the sweetness will probably hurt it in the long run.","taylorhamrick","Jan 20, 2009"
3.87,15.2,4,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I really enjoyed this, and I had some initial doubts due to the strong vinegary nose right out of the bottle. Things quickly settled down. The beer pours a cloudy, well carbonated, murky brown with a smallish off white head, a touch of lacing, some head retention. The nose started out pretty questionable. I thought my bottle had gone bad. It got better once the beer had a chance to aerate. The taste was a real treat. This beer is a close cousin to a Belgian Flemish sour red style ale. The beer has that unique combination of sweet and sour tastes, a wooden perhaps slightly oaken aged tartness, and some very light sherry qualities. The beer is sweet, though, much sweeter than a Flemish Red ale. There are pear flavors, maybe some peach, maybe some other combinations of sweet dessert type fruits. This is an easy drinking beer, very fruity and sweet, with a nice character and loads of complexity. It was a real treat, just don't let the nose turn you off ... drink on.","albern","Jan 18, 2009"

This beer pours a raisin brown with almost no head even with a very vigorous pour, and since no head can be disturbed no lacing occurred either. The strange thing is if you swirl the glass, a nice ring of small bubbles breaks the surface of the beer but it never forms a head. The aroma is so tart that it makes the back of your jaw sting. This has a really nice sour/tart/funky aroma with green apples, grape skins and almost a dry merlot aroma. The flavor is the strangest flavor dichotomy I have ever tasted in a beer. It starts out with a green apple/grape skin sourness and then completely melts into a big, raisin sweetness that reminds me quite intensely of the flavor of a quad. It's really strange. I would really like to know how they come about with such a strange flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light and syrupy, with not much carbonation. Reminds me a bit of the mouthfeel of a Kvass. I think that this would be a nice beer to enjoy every 6 months or so but I don't even think that I could even drink one of these every week.

Red wine vinegar is the first thing that comes to mind in the nose, followed cherries and raspberries. Taste is exceedingly sweet, with a tiny bit of funky sourness. Again, raspberries and cherries come to mind in the taste. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is pretty good, although some might be a little turned off by the sweetness factor.

Pours a dark amber with a medium sized tan head that lingers around for a while. Taste is a lot of sugar that comes right up to and smacks you in the face. Wow! Still tastes like sour candy and some lemon mixed in there as well. On the back end a little bit of roastiness, I have to agree with the reviewer below me. It's like a mouth full of table sugar. If this is indicative of all faro's then I'm not going to go out of my way to get them. Overall, Way too sweet. Glad the lb4lb got it to me, but i guess it's just not my style.","demitriustown","May 06, 2008"

3.75,11.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Looks brown sugar and cinnamon powder juice. Very faint headthat slowly recedes to nothing after a coupe of sips. NOt to mention the very tiny bubbles in th beer. The aroma is a funky sweet brown sugar and medium toasted grains. The taste is like a fruitless fruit lambic. Youe get all the swetness, just none of the real distinct fruit flavors. You get lots of candi sugar and brown sugar withcurrant like tartness. Not a bad after dinner beer. Lots of dark toasted malty goodness.","scruffwhor","Apr 22, 2008"

3.85,14.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Faro isn't such an exotic style after all, it's simply a style that few brewers choose to brew. If you aren't a lambic snob and actually like the sweet fruit 'lambics' on occasion, Chapeau Faro Lambic is worth a purchase.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 14, 2008"
2.16,-35.7,3,2,2,3,2,"Drinkability: I believe this is my first faro. Although, if the patent awfulness of the rest of these Chapeau beers is any indiction whatsoever, it wasn't much of a faro at all. Avoid!","ChainGangGuy","Feb 27, 2008"

3.95,17.6,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Taste is fairly rich and balanced between the vinegar and sugar. Kind of apple-y but more in the tart red variety. Wheat malt is prevalent and aids in the creamy mouthfeel. Prickly carbonation keeps this one moving. A little cloying at times, but overall this is a solid and interesting beer.","jwff","Feb 05, 2008"
3.97,18.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"25 cl bottle purchased around Christmas in Bruges or Antwerp, can't remember. The beer poured a dense, brown body with a slight tan head. The nose was a bit acidic/vinegary but also a bit sweet on the nose. The taste is sweet up front but also is rounded out nicely by the acidic taste. Not as sweet as other faros that I have had. Very good.","ggaughan","Dec 10, 2007"
4.22,25.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured into a lambic style, skinny fluted glass. Nice and dark in color, no head on a gentle pour. Smell was complex with earthy notes. Some fruit undertones under the heavier noise (of the earth I was getting), with a sharp, maybe vinegar/acid, smell that was really pleasant. Taste was a nice sweet blend that I was expecting with the style. Finished quick, easy drink ability. Very palette able.","ballewblake","Beers"
3.65,8.6,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"I haven't had enough faros to know how this compares, but it was okay, though it lacks any complexity or really interesting character. Most likely won't return to this one.","feloniousmonk","0"

2.7,-19.6,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Originally reviewed November 23, 2006. 33cL Bottle. Yeast muddle orange and amber, plum fringed, with a rim of white. light aroma of rotting white grapes, with a meaty squeek. Faint lambic edges of oak and sour lactic. Lightly revolting. Sickly sweet white grape candy and some rotting citrus in teh bottom of the fridge dorr. Some dripping honeyish notes, lots of ogrape skins. Far away a grassy wash of lost hop memories. Light efferevesce, but overall destructively sweet and nasty.","CharlesDarwin","Aug 24, 2006"
3.65,8.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours with trace amount of head, settled to a rounding trim. A surprinsingly dark colour. My pour, from the bottom of the bottle has plenty of little, red bits of sediment. Aroma of a healthy Lambic, puckering sourness with overcoating of wild funk. Flavour finishes and starts on a yeasty note. Trace of over ripe apple, a past-due cider, notes of pear, apricot. A thin lambic, very sweet - candi sugar does lend a tremendous sweet finish. This comes through only on the finish. Little yeast bits at the end offer a very floral character. Very floral yeast notes. Very. Overall, bit of hard to discern from other Lambics if not for the telling sweetness, doesn't have the dimension of puckering tartness or complexity in aroma. Largely though, this isn't that much worse. I enjoyed it this rare style.","biegaman","Jul 31, 2003"
4.45,32.4,4,4,5,3.5,4.5,"Wow! This one was a surprise! This is my first Faro so take that into consideration on the review. I had this one out of a corked and capped bottle about the size of a ""standard"" 16-oz beer. The name and company are correct but it had a different label than posted here. I poured it into a Lindeman's lambic glass. It is a straw-golden color with a good rocky white head that fades at a moderately slow pace. Lots of carbonation rising up the glass. There is pronounced sediment in this lambic, which isn't a turn-off to me. The smell is a musty, spicy, and sweet but light not cloying. The taste was the surprise. Sort of like a lightly sweet and highly carbonated ginger ale. It really gives me a pleasant feeling. It reminds me a bit of the Deus de Flanders but not quite as complex. The sediment was even tasty. The mouthfeel is very fizzy and medium. If it were not so expensive I'd drink this regularly.","TheEclecticGent","Beers"
3.34,-0.6,3,4,3.5,2,3,"Sampled alongside Lindeman's Faro. The front label had 3.5% abv, but the back label had 4.75%. Chapeau's label is green & brown with a picture of a beer barrel draped with hops and barley - Lindeman's is much more attractive: all black with stylish art deco white lettering. On opening the Lindeman's had more fizz and an immediate strong plummy aroma. Both settle to a brown copper colour with a fringe of bubbly froth - the Lindeman's bubbles slightly larger and more varied. So far the Lindeman's is ahead. On giving both a good sniff the Chapeau edges ahead with its musty sweet aroma, slightly medicinal, slightly licorice, quite perfumey - parma violets; when swirled extra sweetness rises. The Lindeman's has a slight plum aroma; when swirled some yeasty lambic acid rises. On tasting the Chapeau is the more interesting with its sweet and medicinal taste, followed by a soft sweet licorice flavour at the back. However, it flags slightly when the band aid remains in the mouth along with a cloying, clinging sweey coating of the mouth. The Lindeman's is much simpler, and more direct. It is intensely sweet initially, but that soon settles into a balance between sweetness and acidity. The mouthfeel really pushes the Lindeman's into first place. Chapeau has a soft mouthfeel with a barely noticable and soon gone gentle fizz - quite boring. The Lindeman's however has a soft fizzy mothfeel - very gentle like having baby rabbits tickle your mouth. Weee! The conclusion is that Chapeau is a flavoursome and interesting drink, but lacks the fun of Lindeman's despite the fuller and more complex flavours.","SteveP","0"
