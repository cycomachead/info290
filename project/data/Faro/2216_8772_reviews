"The beer is copper to amber in color and mildly hazy with virtually no head. The aroma is sweet and sugary, with some malt, yeast, and lambic scents lingering in the background. Smells true to style. Sugary and sweet, I couldn't see having more than one in a session. Light and refreshing, with some fruity malt character. hints of tartness and yeast. It's true, I am not a huge fan of the style (I much prefer traditional lambic), but this is well done for what it is. Certainly worth a try if you have the opportunity."
"O: A decent beer (and fun to try), but again a bit too sweet for my liking."

"Very enjoyable. I liked this one quite a bit more than the Cantillon Faro we had later on, though of course each one varied from batch to batch throughout the trip."
"O: very, very good beer"
"O: Probably the best faro out there."
"This is really the best example of a Faro that I have ever had. This is a perfect pre and during dinner drink, and I am incredibly impressed with how appetizing and very good this beer ended up being."
"D: Nice one. could have better body."
"Drinkability: Great. This is just a nice, mild, and easily sessionable beer. There isn't much to this beer but I enjoyed it and would drink it again in large quantities."
"D - Well I don't usually find styles similar to this one too drinkable, but with how good this was, I found myself wanting more. Great beer overall."
"Sampled on tap at the Drie Fonteinen restaurant with lunch. What a wonderful find as the style is hard to find and on tap ever more so. Beer was served with a copper color and just the slightest amount of bubbles on the edge of the glass but there was no carbonation at all on this one which is due to the fact of how it is served. The aroma was sweet with some slight acidic notes as well. Taste was sweet but not overpowering. Refreshing and just a hint of tart but sweet was the overall tone of this beer and made for a great lunch beer."
