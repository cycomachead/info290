The nose is a light white wine like sweetness with grape and berry notes.  Light medium body with a touch of creamy texture.  Normal carbonation with some effervescence in the middle and finish.  The World Class flavor profile hits the perfect balance of sweet and sour, excellent intensity and reasonable complexity.  It begins with a blend of tart sweet fruit.  As the tartness fades, brown candi sugar becomes evident.  The middle produces a light sourness that is sour fruit in nature rather than vinegar.  The finish is a slow fade of sweet/sour tartness.  This one is an excellent choice for lambic introduction.","tillmac62","Dec 18, 2014"

It had a lustrous dark red color, with a decent fluffy yellowish head (at least in the light I had) and nice lacing.  Aroma is of berries and apple, almost like a root cellar smell after harvest.  The taste is decidedly tart, with a mix of apple and berry that stings the tongue at the back.  I detect an almost medicinal taste to it, but not syrupy.  The mouthfeel is definitely carbonated, but not fizzy.  I like the tartness on the tongue that lingers afterward.  I am liking this Faro Lambic very much, and will try to get my hands on more in the near future.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","0"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of green apple, cherry, strawberry, peach, pear, hay, straw, grass, candi sugar, light vinegar, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast and candi sugar sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of green apple, cherry, strawberry, peach, pear, hay, straw, grass, candi sugar, light vinegar, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, cherry, strawberry, peach, pear, candi sugar, hay, straw, grass, light vinegar/funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast and candi sugar sweetness; with a nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness and after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a very nice Faro Lambic style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast and candi sugar sweetness; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 09, 2014"

4.05,11.3,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"Overall, this was a nice experience. Although faros as a style are sweet, with cloying amounts of added sugars, Lindemans sure knows how to make a crazy sweet beer. This beer, for us, functions more as an after-dinner aperitif, much like a port or sticky brandy. We didn’t find any aspect of it to be offensive, but it is about as refreshing as a tall, warm glass of merlot. There is enough tartness from the yeast to help curb the large base of cloy, but again, the ultimate picture shows that stylistically, they did things right, without too much in one direction or the other.","TheBrewo","0"

However, quite a bit of sediment drifts around the bottom and contributes to the slight haze present. The nose is relatively sweet with slight depth in the form of a subtle funky tartness. It drinks like a very very mild kriek with huge brown sugar sweetness upfront followed by a slightly fruity tartness. It's medium bodied, drinkable, and frankly a bit too sweet considering the lack of fruit/carbonation/acidity. I'm glad to try a beer with so much history and I'm a huge lambic fan, but this just doesn't do it for me. Lambics should be blended with...other lambics.","ThePorterSorter","Apr 09, 2013"

3.41,-6.3,4,4.25,3,3,3.25,"The beer pours a ruddy and candied reddish brown with a nice white head on top that sits at a fingers width. The beer’s body is clear but full of floating particles. The beer leaves a lacing of fat medium sized bubbles that leave a curtain along my glass. On the nose, the beer smells largely funky sweet, with cherry fruit leather mixing with barnyard funk and sweet sugars. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and of salty funk with a nice underlying acidity. In flavor the beer begins as cherry leather, moving into almost cidery juice with prickling malic acidity. The flavor then moves quickly into a drier hay-like bitter flavor that does not taste like hops and really doesn’t work with the sweet flavor that came before it. These flavors mix in the finish, creating a weird mix of flavors that is sweet, but not too appealing. The after taste is rather clean with just a slight acidic pucker ringing in the mouth. In the mouth, the beer feels medium thick in body with a smooth velvety carbonation on the tongue that could stand a little more prickliness to wrangle in the sweet flavors. The mouth is left slightly dry with sticky saliva on the sides. Overall, I’m a little impartial to this beer. It starts interesting and complex, but falls apart with the added bitter flavors and the weird combination of the two flavors. The beer is a little too sweet for my taste, but that isn’t what undoes the beer for me. This beer is weird, and I would probably advise trying one of Lindmans other offerings before I picked this one up.","Maxwell","Apr 07, 2013"

This pours a massive head (filling 3/4 of the fluted glass at one point), this initially quickly disappates to a 3 finger head which then has good retention ans leave a slight lacing, the body is a nice golden or light amber color, more clear than I was expecting. The smells are of a little funk, some barnyard hints, brett, a little vinegar, some ripe cherries. The feel is medium light, a little tangy. The taste is pretty good, you get the funky ripe sour vinegar taste of the gueze but then you get a nice sweet balance, I prefer the straight sour, but this is nice.","DavidST","Nov 12, 2012"

4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, funk, fruit, and subtle cherry. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, earth, tart, and sugar. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This was my first Faro that I have had. So I really went into this one blind, but was hoping I would like what I would find. In typical Lindeman fashion this one was quite sweet, but not to the point of being sickening. There was a really nice balance of flavors without being overwhelming which made it quite easy to drink. I was hoping that my first from the style would be a little more of a harder to get brewery that is known for a little more tradition of their styles, but this one wasn’t too bad.","thagr81us","Aug 24, 2012"

Get flavors of pepper, apples, white grapes, and a touch of ginger. I'm new to faros and I'm not sure what the great ones taste like, but this one fits the description nicely and tastes good. Not much of a finish, but that may be indicative of the style. I like the sweetness, but it may be just a bit overdone.

The color was a a shade of brown with a very thin white head on top that faded almost right away. The smell of the beer was actually quite funky, I expected this to be on the tart side once I took a sip. The taste however was not tart at all really. I know that it's a Lindeman's product but even they have some sourness in them. This was surprisingly sweeter than all the others I've had from them. The taste of brown sugar was throughout the beer. There was just a touch of funk in there too. The mouthfeel was decent but nothing too impressive really. Overall this was something that I found to be quite interesting and I'd like to have more of this style one day just to compare.","Knapp85","Beers"

The caramel apple is amazingly strong considering there is no fruit. Not dry enough, I wish it would dry up faster on the tongue, but it is supposed to be sweet. Very nice and refreshing.

Taste leads with a big rush of candied sugar that becomes somewhat cloying as the bottle approaches its finish, tart and funk notes seem aggressive and blend with the sugar to produce an odd flavor, light vinous notes...

RAISINS permeated my palate, with strawberries and white wine coming in mid-palate, and sweet dark sugars finishing off, with a hint of oak. Mouthfeel was about medium, with a syrupy sweetness I just didn't care too much for. Good for a glass, but that's probably it for me.

3.7,1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5," The taste is as the nose leads on, with spice caramel heavy sugar influence and mild oak flavor accenting. w/ subtle spiciness and lots of residual sugar on the palate as the sweetness lingers.

4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Crystal clear golden color with a tight ivory head. There's a very solid cascade of bubbles working up the side of the glass. There is a huge staying power on the head due to the carbonation. Looks good. The aroma is a dichotomy between barnyard and sour fruityness. There is an upfront mustyness that plays with an underlying sour apple fruityness. The aroma is actually a bit subtle. The flavor brings a mild tartness as I take the first sip. Following this comes a tart cherry mixed with grape skin and black currant. There is a lot of fruit in there. The aftertaste brings some mustyness and a slight raw wheat flavor as well. This one is very light on the tongue, with a lively carbonation. Not having any other experiences with a faro, I really don't have a point of comparison, but knowing a bit about the style, I think this falls with a standard deviation of what I would have expected before opening it. I like it. Overall, this is a good beer. I think it would fit the bill when I wanted something sour-ish but not puckering.","kmpitz2","Jul 04, 2011"
3.6,-1.1,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Light brown with an orange tint and a little bit hazy. Some fine, off-white foam appeared during the pour and lingered for quite some time, producing a lot of spotty lacing. Earthy nose, tart notes of apples and grapes, brown sugar, with a hint of nuttiness and sourness. Quite sweet in flavour -- this really tames the tartness that seems to be somewhat hidden by the sugar. Apples and brown sugar, sort of cidery and grapey, dry on the palate. Carbonation was light, but enough to lift the body and keep it from feeling dead. Overall, an interesting beer and one that I'd certainly have again, but a little sweet for my tastes. I'm thinking this would go better with food rather than on its own on a warm summer day.","DrJay","Jul 01, 2011"

Taste is pretty sweet with some funk/must flavors being covered up by sugar flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a sticky and bubbly mouthfeel.

This beer pours an orangish amber in color with a light cream colored lacing around the glass. It is very clear and translucent. It smells like it should be tasty. It smells of candied fruit and has some syrupy raspberry to it. The flavors are very sweet but not too sweet. As zep said, my girlfriend would love this. It is so flavorful and full of sweet fruits.

It shows the funky complexity of its base beer much better than Lindeman's less traditional sweetened lambics and despite the strange descriptors that I am forced to use in relating the flavors it is actually pretty enjoyable. Unlike the sweetened fruit lambics, the sourness is able to show through a bit along with the wild character and thanks to the tradition behind this style, you aren't left with the feeling that they ruined something wonderful to appeal to the masses. If you know what you are getting into with this beer you can enjoy it for what it is and I can see it being a really refreshing beer on a hot day.","nickfl","Apr 12, 2011"

Tart and sweet, complex yet drinkable, sour yet balanced. I wasn't dazzled but I decided I liked the style as a result of trying this beer.

And so, as with many introductions, now that I've had this one I'll not be returning often to this particular beer or style of Lambic very often except to sample someone else's version of a Faro to see if I like it a bit better.

The taste is sweet and sour, with more candi sugar sweetness than there are acetic notes. Clean and light with the sugar coming through loud and clear, and although the acid makes an attempt to balance, it's not quite up to the task. I could see why some might like this sitting at a cafe in the sun, but make mine a little less sweet please. Still the flavors are clean and distinct and the mouthfeel is smooth and clean if sweet.

It pours an equally hazy and clear light amber brown, not unlike a lighter cup o' tea, topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose has got some tea influence as well, along with some violets, pears, mangoes, raspberries, and some toffee. The taste is basically the same fruit, berry, and flower blend as the smell, with some extra framboise influence thrown in for good measure. In addition, some added sugar sweetness (redundant? I think not!) pervades as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thick, sticky feel. Overall, as my first faro, I felt this held its own as a very tasty brew.

Sweet turns to a slight tartness about mid way through, then leaves a long lingering candy sweetness. Light to medium level of carbonation, sweet sticky mouthfeel, medium body.

The flavor is unusual, and takes some getting used to. The dominant flavor is akin to sweetened apple cider vinegar, with something earthy and papery, like dry leaves. The little carbonation that comes through is just enough to support these flavors, and in the end, this beer is all about the sweet, dark candi sugar.

More earth, orange, honey, sweet and sour with more and more sour building up. I also pick up some mustiness and minor continued funk in the finish.

It's toffee colored with a nice thin head and no lace to speak of. The smell is yeast, horse blanket, and fresh earth. Very unusual...sort of the beer equivalent of meat that's ""gamey"". The taste is very sweet up front, with mellow fruits and a earthy background. The mouthfeel is syrupy, soft, and a bit too thick overall. The drinkability is really limited by the sweetness.

No need to slam it, as I am sure it is a fine example of the style. It is definitely complex and well crafted, just not for me.

Starting with the very soured belgian lambics that I usually find dificult to tolerate, but blended with a huge dose of candy sugars. The beer started out with a mead-like sweetness, but quickly followed up with an intense tartness that reached astringent levels. A earthy, musky, cellar-like quality swirled around in the aromas and flavors. Tasted and felt wood-like and sweettart-like. Thin feeling, but richer than the standard lambics. Finished quite dry and sweet. Approaches wine character. With all that said, it was a fantastic beer...I need a moist towelette. Thanks Clvand0.","BEERchitect","Jun 03, 2006"

Perhaps to guarantee the cork doesn't pop when you don't want it to, and it's a cheaper solution than wiring it up? Whatever the reason, it's worth the trouble getting inside. I was rewarded with a beer of pleasing light brown appearance, the natural carbonation was just right. The next thing you notice is how sweet it is. To be honest I didn't like this at first but I had got used to it by the time I had finished my second bottle. To summarise, not a world-beater but a nice cooling beverage, just the thing on a warm day.","downes51","Dec 11, 2004"

3.67,0.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Unwrapping the silver-foiled top, I pried off the cap with an opener, and was then faced with a cork in the bottle. This is the first beer I have tried which is both capped and corked; to require both an opener and a corkscrew. The appearance of this faro was darker than I expected--it was not golden but more dirty-light-brown. It was hazy, and possessed a quick, fizzy head that lowered to a ring of foam. The aroma is obviously extreme sweetness, which I expected from a faro lambic. There is complexity, however, in the delightful oakwood aromas, the assertive sourness and tartness. At the very first smell there was some unknown note, akin to leather or an astringent chemical, but it was not at all in the least unpleasant. The aroma reminded me of champagne, sour and piquant. There is also a musty note, some faint citrus, and tomato juice. The aroma, whilst appetising, was not the most powerful; for me, it could use more strength. Up front the beer is all sweetness, with oak definitely making its presence felt. I absolutely loved the sweet, sugary taste. You can feel the sugary slickness of the cane. The aftertaste too is sugary, with some balancing light malt, and oak again. There is more bitterness than a kriek, but still very little in the beer. In the middle I taste acidic tones of tomato. Despite the sweetness I get some dry mouth feels. The breath-taste is somewhat metallic, with some cherry candy. Fairly viscious carbonation, like champagne, sparkling on the tongue. On the long aftertaste, I sense iron and saltiness. I enjoy the sweetness, but no more than two of these for me at one sitting, or the sugar is overmuch. This is probably one of the sweetest beers I have ever tried. Would I buy this again? Absolutely.","Cwrw","Nov 26, 2004"
