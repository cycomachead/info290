I find this much easier to drink. Extremely light and refreshing, and I like it's mild sweetness. Not sure if it's from sucrose, but the cinnamon angle on this is really nice.","smakawhat","Jan 13, 2013"

3.78,2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours sort of a murky amber color with a small off-white head. As anticipated, very sweet. Quite fruity with an interesting butterscotch note to it as well. Decently funky with some must, oak, and straw. Lightly tart with a lemon/lactic note. The flavor has the same interesting combination of sweetness and tartness. A bit of citrus peel along with candy, sugar, and butterscotch.","womencantsail","Jun 07, 2012"
3.6,-2.2,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall - It's as if the flavors were there once, but have fallen off. It's totally drinkable, but there's not a lot there. I've never had a Faro, so it's tough to rate to style. I doubt I'll have many more. I'm really just reviewing this to taste. I expect more, because the flavors that are there make me expect more lambic aspects than it delivers.","Alieniloquium","May 22, 2012"
3.9,6,4,4,4,3,4,"Overall: this is a nice Faro. It has some nice flavor and actually isn't overly sweet.","megahurts4","Apr 10, 2012"

3.58,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Medium-bodied with slight wateriness around the edges. Carbonation is modest, but enough to propel this across the palate. Resulting feel is smooth and easy drinking.","falloutsnow","Jan 08, 2012"
3.46,-6,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Pour is a deep copper color with tons of a tight bubbly tan head. The nose is light, mostly lambic, a little cob web like fun and some faint caramel and brown sugar. Taste follows the nose but a slight bit sweeter. Cobweb and dusty funk adds a bit of complexity as sweet caramel and brown sugars come in. The body is light with a very active feel on the tongue and a hint of dryness. The flavors and nose are a bit muted but it does offer balance and some depth of flavors.","cpetrone84","Nov 14, 2011"
3.85,4.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"O: A tasty bottled offering of faro. I'd prefer Girardin cut the crap and remove the AceK though.","callmemickey","Oct 15, 2011"

3.5,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A rare faro tick courtesy of westcoastbeerlvr. Thanks, Craig. Pours clear amber with low level of carbonation, no head. Smells like caramel, oak and funk. Little bit of sourness shines through, and quite a bit more -bal and funk than I was expecting. Some hay-like scents. Taste is actually more oaky than sweet, though there's plenty of sugar to even out the sourness and tannins. Wet wood, caramel, bitterness and tannic oak in the finish. Has the Girardin essence, just very sweet. Couldn't drink a lot of this, but it's decent in small quantities. Best faro I've tasted at this point, really not bad.","largadeer","Oct 20, 2010"
3.83,4.1,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle. Pours a murky amber color with a slight white head. The aroma is more funky than expected and has a slight herbal, medicinal note. The taste is quite a surprise and reminds me of sweet peppermint. The medicinal notes in the nose are slightly present in the taste but not as much, I think they get covered up by the sweetness of the malt. Very easy drinking with a light/medium mouthfeel. Some notes of cedar or wood as well.","kbutler1","Oct 18, 2010"
3.35,-9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall, I somewhat like it. Not something I want a lot of, but it was great to try this one. Pretty unique.","mothman","Jul 04, 2010"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Beer is moderately dry and light in body with a mild forward sweetness and some lactic and acetic notes leading up to a clean finish. Its got a nice mouthfeel and is quite drinkable.","drabmuh","Feb 17, 2010"
1.79,-51.4,3.5,2,1,3,2,"This stuff is disgusting and tastes like diapers. Much more funky than any other Girardin I have tasted. Pour is brown, no real head or lacing. I was expecting it to be sweet but it was not. Rubbery and a bit oxidized, definitely a ""yuck"" factor present. My first faro but I can't believe it is supposed to taste like this. This is the sort of beer that grows up with a father that beats them constantly in a trailer park and winds up on an episode of cops.","craytonic","Jan 18, 2010"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pretty, light amber that's clear. Nose is cherry, butterscotch, faint raspberry, with that lambic funkiness. Flavor is slightly thin, with apple, pear, a touch of sweat, and berry sweetness on the finish with some nice acidity. A very approachable, yet respectable lambic.","gyllstromk","Sep 28, 2009"
2.41,-34.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I found it difficult to finish and that is rare with me, so not the best faro I've had.","BlackHaddock","Sep 28, 2009"
3.88,5.4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"D - This is pretty easy drinking stuff. It's not as drinkable as classic gueuze due to the sweetness, but I could easily put back a 375ml bottle.","MasterSki","Jul 20, 2009"
3.98,8.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D - The split of this bottle helps because I don't know if I could drink all too much of it. That said, I would drink again but doubt I'll ever see it again.","Sean9689","Dec 24, 2008"
3.68,0,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"D: A very easy to drink lambic with mellow flavors and a restrained tartness due to the sweetening. Refreshing. All in all, not a bad beer.","ricke","Beers"

4.92,33.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Light bodied, nice carbonation, this is by far the best Faro I ever had; it is indeed sweeter than the original 1882, but not by much; there are multiple sour, acidic notes along with the sweety fruitiness, and lots of earthiness and funkiness. A very impressive example, high drinkability since it is well balanced and just lightly sweet. A masterpiece of flavor packed in such a low ABV.","brdc","Jun 04, 2008"
4.02,9.2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"I've enjoyed all of the Girardin lambics I've tried but their Faro, in particular, seems the stand out offering. It was super neat, and a little unlike the couple other Faros I've tried. It had an untypical amount of depth for the style, a touch of fruit, gums-swelling level of sweet sugar, and a mellow jam session of funk. This is something I might have to seek out again...","biegaman","Mar 18, 2008"

4.35,18.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear orange/brown, thin off white head, some lace spots, pretty neat colour. Smell is funky, spices, brown sugar, strawberries and other fruits, canteloupe, nice sweet edge. Taste is sweet, sugar, fruits, caramel/honey middle, funky sour fruit, spiced bread, nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, silky smooth. Excellent beer, I can't wait to get this again. Big thanks Jan!","Viggo","Aug 26, 2007"
3.25,-11.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a light reddish/brown color lambic with a big foamy off-white head with limited retention. Aroma is quite funky with limited tartness and acidity which was a bit disappointing. Taste was similar to the gueuze but as if the tartness and acidity had been removed and replace with light sugary notes. Body was a bit too light with some good carbonation. I find it always interesting too try those traditional examples but this one really miss the mark.","Phyl21ca","Apr 02, 2007"
