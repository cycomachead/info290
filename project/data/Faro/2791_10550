3.75,5.3,3,3.5,4,3.25,4,"This same beer was given an alias for the Brussels’ food month and marathon in 2012. They were calling it “brusselicious” and even bottled it under that name. Each runner received a free bottle. I just got around to drinking mine. It pours with about two fingers of head with a very spread out white lace that sticks around indefinitely. It has a very sweet followed by sour nose. I loved the flavor. It is very similar to the smell. It is almost like grape and apple. It has a very thin feel and is very easy to drink.","MTNboy","Feb 18, 2013"

Excellent light acid apple taste, typical for faro, simple & crisp. Moderate carbonation, dry palate & high drinkability.","Dentist666","Jul 22, 2005"
