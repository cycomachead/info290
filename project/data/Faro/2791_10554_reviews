"A nice thirst quencher and the ambiance work nicely for an enjoyable beer stop while in Brussels."

"Dr: Easy to down, but nothing special. Refreshing but very disappointing considering how difficult it is to find. This is a beer that may suffer from rarity-induced hype, though it's certainly pleasant. It's just more of a cider than a beer."
"The beer is quite sweet tasting, but still thin bodied and simplistically very cider like. There is a touch of caramelized apple character here. A faint tartness seems more apple like than from lactic acid, despite the fact that it must actually be from lactic acid. There is perhaps a touch of acetic acid here that accentuates and brings out an apple cider vinegar like flavor in the finish. After having the 3 Fonteinen Faro a couple blocks away it is amazing how absolutely pathetic this beer is. It tastes like apple cider juice with no complexity and lots of cloying sweetness."
"Trying this for the first time at ""a la Becasse"" in Brussels. Served in a pottery pitcher. Pours a clear apple juice gold. A few bubbles for head the die quickly leaving you with a glass of light apple-pear smelling beverage. Smooth and clean tasting, a hint of tart. Like sipping non-carbonated hard cider. Very different - actually completely different when compared to the more famous and more consumed Belgium blondes and brunes. Delicious and a very pleasant experience overall."
"Very fun to drink. It walks the thin line of balancing sweet and tart."
"Certainly a unique brew, and well worth hunting down. I recommend that all beer lovers who visit Belgium try this the old fashioned way, and enjoy a little piece of brewing history."
"A really wonderful lambic and a unique experience in Brussels. Get to La Becasse if only to try one pitcher of this throwback."
"Drinkability: Magnificently drinkable. By the end of our time at La Becasse I had about 8 or 10 servings of this beer in the little glasses. It is remarkably refreshing and not overly sweet, especially for a faro style beer. Very enjoyable and I look forward to going back and drinking more on my next trip to Brussels."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Overall: A sweetened version of the usual lambic beer that once acquired wide spread popularity in the Brussels area, but is now extremely hard to find in its traditional format. Like lambic, Faro is an acquired taste, but the Timmermans draft version is such a classic example of the style, that it is worth the visit to Brussels alone to try it, for I am sure it will one day disappear for good."
