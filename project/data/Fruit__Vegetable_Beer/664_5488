Sickly sweet artificial tasting banana although the bottle states they use actual bananas. Not saying it is artificial but it's just a taste to me. Then toffee and some dryness but very little. Slight roastyness but not much. Happy to have tried it but will not buy again. But glad to have tried it.","Urk1127","Sunday at 02:08 PM"

The banana comes across pretty much identically to Belgian yeast. Not as hoppy as a BPA, but otherwise very similar in balance. My only knock on this is the incredible thinness.","gopens44","Feb 22, 2015"

This beer was much more pleasant than most people (dis)credited it for. This beer was not bitter at all despite other comments I've read about this one. I did experience the banana flavor both in the taste and aroma of this brew. It has a very smooth, well balanced, satisfyingly sweet taste and best of all it didn't leave me feeling woozy or tipsy, at least not yet. Although I've had even better fruit beers in Montana, this is certainly of the better ones you could savor. The current BA Score of this beer at the time of my review is 79, a pity as this is much better than others on here which are highly overrated. As far as the aftertaste goes, no issues as of yet. Would I buy this English brew again? Yes indeed. It's a winner.","Kiwi_Bird","Nov 19, 2014"

It doesn't taste like banana bread, and it doesn't feel like a craft so to speak. It's a notch above the macros and it's pretty decent, but if they marketed it under a wheat beer with banana notes and put it in 12-pack cases I'd be more excited about it (and probably by hype I'd give it a 3.5 or more). If you're expecting banana bread, just buy a loaf instead (or get your mama to make you one). It's probably as close as any brewer has come to it, but it's a far cry from a delicious treat.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 27, 2014"

3.8,8.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"500 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, best before 11/14/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep copper/amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big ripe banana, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, light caramel, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of banana, dark/bready malt, and light hop notes; with good strength. Taste of ripe banana, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, light caramel, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, light caramel, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and solid robustness of banana, dark/bready malt, and light hop flavors; with a good malt/fruit balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly dry mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good fruit beer. Good balance and solid robustness of banana, dark/bready malt, and light hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A bit one dimensional, but it accomplishes what it advertises. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 09, 2014"

The appearance was dark amber with a slightly yellow white head. The smell was full of bananas and nutmeg. The taste was great with the wheat from the beer and the banana flavor mixing to make a warm banana bread flavor for the beer. The mouthfeel was also very nice, just thick enough without becoming overwhelming. Really nice twist.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 03, 2014"

The beer looks really good in the glass, a nice amber color with a small amount of head on top. The smell is great in my opinion, and the banana stands out easily. As far as the taste is concerned, I feel like something is missing. The subtle banana flavoring is great, but it I just feel like there's something that could stand out more, that just isn't. Overall, I think it's a good beer that readily available.","firefightn24","Aug 01, 2014"

If you're a fan of both without seeking fusion, by all means give it a go to judge for yourself. For me it's a nice change of pace, but not something I'd list as a regular item on my brew menu, especially for the price. For the price of six others, I only get four, but such is the way for the adventurous taster.","Aegelis","0"

Would be nice if this had a bit more of a malt backbone to stand up to the banana -- a bit of roastiness and nuttiness would probably complement it nicely. Still, it's pretty drinkable once the artificial-seeming aroma fades. A decent beer for when you're in the mood for something unusual.","scottwood","Apr 13, 2014"

The first smell one gets is, unsurprisingly, sweet ripe bananas. There really isn't much more that be picked up because the banana smell is so strong. The first taste you get is the sweet banana as well, but then it is followed by the malt and hops that one would expect to get from a British bitter. This beer had medium carbonation and a thin or light feel. I would have expected it to be heavier, but was surprised at how light it was. My biggest issue with this beer is an associative one...the smell and initial taste remind me of Mr Freezee ice pops (for Americans think Otter pops).

2.63,-25.1,2.5,2.5,2.75,2.75,2.5,"Was really excited to give this a try as I love the smell and taste of bananas. Read the label and noticed that this is the same company that produces the Double Chocolate Stout. Hmmmm. I was disappointed in that one. Would the same apply here? Meaning would I be let down by the promise of flavor? Popped a bottle in the fridge and poured it into a beer glass. Nice 2 finger head that has some nice lacing as the head dissipates. I noticed the foam keeps throughout and never totally disappears. The color is a nice flat blondish orange. Clear looking. Has a faint smell of bananas that is artificial. I wish the smell was more pure. The taste has a very faint sweetness to it and the fake banana flavor comes through at the finish and lingers a bit. The beer itself has no body and is quite thin and watery. What happened to the ""liquid bread"" they were talking about? This is an easy beer to drink and I could probably have 2 bottles easily but I was disappointed in the overall taste. When I drink a flavored beer I want it to taste like what it is advertised. Towards the end I added some Dekuyper Creme de Banana just for kicks and the taste elevated to a new level. Granted it was still fake, the sweetness and the banana ""flavor"" was enhanced. I think this is a nice beer for women. (My wife liked the taste). I liked it ok, just wished it was more true and flavorful.","Richardbeerlover","Nov 09, 2013"

4.37,24.5,2.75,5,4,4.5,4.75,"156 calories per bottle 5.2% ABV. The first time I tasted this I was a bit tipsy but really surprised how well this tasted like banana bread. I wasn't able to sense any bitterness or bad aftertaste. With a fruit flavored beer it likely either has a bad aftertaste or such a strong flavor that you'd only be able to handle one without throwing-up - this one would be able to be consumed in a 6-pack. The taste was not excessively strong and neither unsatisfying to the way it settles in the stomach. I did like this and would like to try again as one of my first beers to be able to truly sense any subtle hints of dissatisfaction. I liked and would buy again, a good choice for the fruit flavored style. The appetence could improve but that is not as big a deal as the taste.","json83","Jul 17, 2013"

I was expecting just bananas, but they nailed the bread part as well. The taste follows suit with a really nice, surprising spot-on banana bread flavor. Not artificial at all, and the spiciness of the hops adds a nice twist. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice balance and none of the artificial aftertaste I had expected. And it's not sweet and syrupy, but very sessionable. Overall, this was very surprising. Yeah, it's kind of a novelty, but it's a well made beer and I'm glad I tried it.","beerdrifter","Jul 03, 2013"

From the bottle the beer is an appealing dark amber, pouring a weak head but with good lacing. The smell is distinctly banana - I don't smell much of bread, but definitely banana - which is a pet peeve of mine. If you advertise it one way, it better be that way, oh well that's advertisement for you. The beer however was bold and refreshing, a little too much carbonation for my taste, but still good. I really did enjoy it, a great mixture of malt and banana that mixed perfectly. Overall, it wasn't banana bread, but it was a good banana flavored beer that I think many will like.","jjamadorphd","Jun 30, 2013"

The nose has subtle, but detectable notes of ripe banana/bread, seemingly non-artificial smelling, and a touch of yeast and vanilla extract. The banana in the nose doesn't fully translate into the beer's flavor profile, which is more of a bitter amber ale than anything, but does leave traces of lingering green banana in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is relatively thin and light-bodied, sessionable, effervescent, slightly bitter, and leaves a bitter-sweet banana aftertaste. I'd say this is definitely not what I'd expected and could use a bit more body, yeast, and sweetness to really amplify what is a spot on, non-artificial banana nose and taste.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 15, 2013"

Could it be that the Banana Bread Beer sets the palate up for a new beer flavor? Based on my experience, I say it does.Worth a try just for the uniqueness alone.","Hendry","Mar 06, 2013"

Not filling can have 3 or 4 in a row and its not overwhelming. Like a pilsner with a banana boost! Not sweet banana flavor its more savory.

In her defense the other stuff included some Dogfish head stuff, a Dead Guy from Rogue and some other good stuff. Anyway, I'd heard this was bad, and it was. Not as bad as I was expecting, but still, not good. I don't think it was the execution of the beer, but the concept. I hate pretty much anything banana flavored, except bananas themselves, and banana bread. I rank this somewhere between banana flavored candy and real banana bread. Mostly I couldn't handle the smell. Smelled like a banana peel that had been left in a hot car all day. It tasted okish, but the smell was always there. There's that.","kyleelton","Nov 18, 2012"

The beer really had a crisp and small flavor profile that was more malt forward than hoppy, but the fruit portion was unusually perfect when compared to banana bread. I wouldn't be able to drink more than one of these in a session, but for an after dinner drink, or a drink to break away from the norm, this one really hit the spot. I was surprised that I did like this, as I didn't think it would be up my alley. I wouldn't go out of my way to find it, nor would I say it was a great beer or worth buying if I ever found it in bottles, but it was an enjoyable beer to sip on at a bar with some friends.","HarrySTruman","Nov 12, 2012"

Fruit beers have never really been my thing, but Wells Banana Bread Beer is an enjoyable example that I might just pick up again some time. Fans of banana bread are unlikely to be disappointed, because this beer really does emulate its flavour surprisingly well. Not my favourite Wells & Young offering by a longshot, but still a respectable brew that is worth at least one try.","thehyperduck","Jul 15, 2012"
3.42,-2.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"An interesting effort - the description of liquid banana bread is entirely justified. Plenty of banana on display and very sweet. The banana is very intense in the aroma, but balanced by a more obvious malt character in the flavour. The mouthfeel is too watery and doesn't stand up to the relatively strong taste. Overall it goes down better than expected, though I probably won't seek it out again. Worth trying.","jazzyjeff13","Jul 15, 2012"

Smell is what is advertised, banana and a whole lot of it. Some cereal scent after all the hoopla, small amount of grain. Taste is less artificial than expected, i was expecting this to be a sweet sugar bomb, while it's more of a lightly sweet banana infused pale ale without the hops, if that makes sense. Feel is very light with a low amount of bubbled activity, kinda dead on the mouth. I drank it and that's that, not something I would go for again. A bottle of this would be ideal to split with a group of 5 people or so, with a banana infused dessert, or just simply dump the bottle into your next banana inspired dish.","BARFLYB","Dec 08, 2011"

Still, this beer really works well. It's well balanced, the banana comes through but does not overpower, and it's quite drinkable. I could see myself having a full pint, but that would be the end. Also, given what I said about having this with banana bread one evening (not this one) the beer is really best for an after meal treat or something with dessert. I think this beer would be quite bad with other food. Still, a good beer overall and if offered I'd have it again. Not sure though if I would buy it again.

The taste is a bit bizarre, but still pretty good. The ""banana bread"" and the ""beer"" parts of this beer seem to exist on two different planes that are forced together when I sip this. The beer hangs out on one side, with a decent bready caramel malt presence, even if it's kind of watery. The banana bread is over on the other side, being all delicious and stuff. They never quite coexist to become as delicious as they can be, but it's still enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, and the drinkability is decent, but can strain due to sweetness.

Anyways, there's some sweet caramel malt in there, too. I guess you could use your imagination and see where the ""bread"" comes from, but I'm not digging it.

The head was a puffy, pillow-y two-plus fingers of thick, yellow-white head that held in until a big exhalation of CO2, when it fell all at once. By Gar, I can smell bananas everywhere! Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Now, if you thought BUPGOO! was wrong in being marketed to the kiddies, this is so far afield that I cannot believe that it exists. I am going to see if my current beau (she from ""Cabaret"" - 'If You Could See Her') approves. She does! Oh, my darling monkey. Wait, I see a monkey with a bomb! It's Inspector Clouseau yelling about ""A minkey with a bimb!"" or somesuch. These Brits ... it's so hard to tell what they're on about at times. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, so maybe he was saying something about it being thin. Why can't the British speak English? It's so confounding! Now, it's ""Planet of the Apes"" - Get your hands off of my banana beer, you damn dirty ape! It's irresistible to the simian set, apparently. Have you ever seen Woody Allen in ""Bananas""? He sports a Che/Fidel beard that lends itself to my nickname. Taste was as advertised - bananas with a hint of caramel. Finish was very banana and if I liked bananas, that would be a good thing.

The taste brings in the same elements, along with some raisins and a touch of fake banana flavor, not entirely unlike that found in certain yellow Runts (full disclosure: it's my favorite flavor of Runt, but it doesn't quite do it for me here). The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish.

Heavy does of wheat with a peppery finish and the banana kind of lingers in the background. Throw a little more banana in there and we would have a winner!

A very sweet and rich beer, definitely a dessert pairing brew, while at the same time, managing to bring about characteristics of the malts and a nice hop bitterness that lingers around after each sip.

Althow i think they should make a porter/stout version of this one, kind of like youngs double chocolate but youngs dbl banana","drewd0g","Oct 25, 2010"

Super-clear copper orange color with a darkening reddish aspect, a few lazy bubbles here and there within. Banana goes through loud and clear in the nose, however, fresh and light, not in any estery fashion, cinnamon and vanilla too, sponge cake, lighter granola, lemon yogurt, perhaps a hint of cherry as well. Light-bodied, light enough that the active carbonation prevents a lot of the flavor from soaking in. The banana, fig, pear fruit attenuated, the same for the bread to cake aspect. The lemon and vanilla fold into each other, the spiciness and nuttiness takes a couple of steps back. Without more richness of flavor, the carbonation keeps plowing ahead, detracts from mouth feel. Otherwise, inoffensive and innocuous.","farrago","Oct 11, 2010"

I found myself debating whether it was an ale or a lager half way through. The beer is clear and light yellow. Nearly flat, so no carbonation at all. No head. Overwhelming smell of bananas, but not the fruit bananas, think banana runts. Surprisingly, it did not taste a lot like bananas (although each time I burped they tasted like bananas). Mouthfeel was weak and thin. The aftertaste of the beer was stronger than the taste. The aftertaste was that of a poorly made Kolsch. On the bottle, they wrote:""Long ago, ale was known as 'liquid bread'. We've used our long history of creating the finest malt blends and added fairtrade bananas to awaken the senses with a seriously fruity, rich, yet surprisingly versatile banana bread beer."" Lies, all lies. Don't bother with this beer. It was close to undrinkable.","drabmuh","Jul 18, 2009"

The first smell, surprisingly, gave me a caramel malty nose with a hint of raisins and banana. Maybe its this damn cold. Then the second smell, after swirling it in my glass a bit. Whoa. This truly defines the expression 'hence the name.' A robust banana flavor enveloped my nose, and reminded my exactly that of banana bread. I'm happy to note that the powerful aroma of banana bread didn't influence the taste. Strong presence of bananas upon first sip, but not dominating the decently balanced caramel malty sweet bitterness. The mouthful gave me a light to medium body with a crisp fruity aftertaste. Refreshing as I quickly quaffed my glass. Overall, this would be a great brew to enjoy as an after dinner treat. A unique beverage, indeed.

The base beer is a classy English Pale Ale with a biscuity, cracker-like maltiness (not so much bread), a crisp caramel flavor, light on esters, and crystal clean. Well attenuated and properly done. The bannana character does just what it should; it gives an extra flavor without overpowering. If anything the bannana notes remind me of the Gobstoppers bananna flavor- not exactly real, but not artificial either. The fruit character hits hardest in the nose, while residing a bit in the flavor and whispers away into the finish, allowing the true beer character to shine. Very nicely done.

And this IS a banana beer, after all. After the first sip, I'm having trouble figuring out what banana tastes I have are coming from the beer vs the banana I just ate. Pretty sure that little burp right that was from the real banana. I suppose this means that I can make any beer a banana beer by eating a banana before it, and I won't have to pay $5 for the privilege! Subsequent tastes are getting better as the flavours become more distinguishable. Banana flavours - more direct and less subtle than a hefeweizen.

Head left a ring around the glass that lasted the entire pint (and remaining refill). Aroma definitely was that of fresh cooking banana bread. The flavor was initially very lacking, didn't provide much except perhaps for some soapy bitterness. Once the beer warmed up to probably about 60 degrees, the flavor was all sweet banana bread with a small touch of bitterness at the end. Felt a little thin in the mouth and slightly over carbonated.

Strong carbonation, with a large bubble feel. Finishes malty and marginally towards the sweet side, with mercifully restrained banana flavor. The fruit flavor gathers as the beer warms, but remains civilized. I've gotten more out of a hefeweizen. An estery, phenolic feel in the back of the throat, like Juicyfruit gum. A little pear and white grape, besides the banana. Some herbal/floral/metallic hops provide balanced bitterness. Light to medium bodied, smooth and rather dry on the palate.

As the beer warms, it mellows a bit, is less bitter, and more warming banana notes come through. Overall, the beer isn't bad, worth trying, and enjoyable, but it isn't the kind of beer you'll be drinking lots of.

Clarity is very good and there is a very steady curtain of bubbles visible. The aroma is nice sweet banana, with caramel blended in there along with a doughy malt base. I have to say that this one smells like what it says it is. Taking a sip, I get a more earthy banana, kinda like a bruised banana, flavor with a more substantial dough and breadyness to the malt. What surprises me most is the strength of the hop in both flavor and bitterness. It is nice and herbal and very pleasant in the bitterness, but it just doesn't seem to fit the rest of the brew. Mouthfeel is a very healthy moderate with a light carbonation of fine bubbles. It almost as a bot of a creamy texture as well. Overall, I have to give them credit for making this one truly a banana bread beer. I think the hop profile doesn't fit the rest of the beer, but it is still enjoyable.

I found the smell to be overpowering. The finish is more of the same, artificial banana. The liquor store in NJ where I bought it was Bourbon Street in Greenwich. The manager, noticing I was buying 2 cases of micros recommended it and assured me it was not too overpowering. I won't be taking his advice again.

Hearing the name, you would think ""hefeweizen"" but its really not. The banana flavor isn't really all that pronounced (nothing like say, a Weinstephaner), and it quickly vanishes to reveal a bland, almost flat lager flavor underneath.

2.44,-30.5,4,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Some banana-like flavor in hefewiezens and other beers is actually pretty good. And one of my favorite smells is the fresh baked bread aroma in some Belgian and German beers. But this was awful.","TurdFurgison","Jun 01, 2006"
2.02,-42.5,4,2,1.5,3,2,"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a trace of lace. Chrystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Strong banana nose. Starts as a malty/hop mix but then the banana flavor kicks in, a strange soapy banana aftertaste. $4.09 for a 19.25oz bottle from John's Market Place Tigard, Or. The bottle ABV is 5.2%.","jdhilt","Mar 18, 2006"
3.3,-6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to rogue for sharing at Winking Lizard. Clear dark amber color with a medium white head and minimal lacing. The aroma is of course all bananas. Medium-bodied, and the banana character luckily is not as dominant in the flavor as it is in the aroma. However it is still a lot of banana, along with a bit of malt and nuts. The finish is fruity and nutty. I was nervous trying this but it actually turned out better than expected. I still wouldnt make it a regular purchase though.","Dogbrick","May 04, 2005"
2.83,-19.4,3.5,3,3,2,2.5,"I want to quote my SO: If you want to get drunk on banana sweets, then it might be OK. . I, for myself, wonder if banana beers is some kind of strange English tradition.","bark","Mar 21, 2005"
3.82,8.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a rich amber with some significant carbonation feeding a nice frothy head with some little bits of foam left down the glass. Strong aroma of freshly baked banana bread. What more can I say? Except that I quite like freshly baked banana bread. Some more traditional malt flavour in the initial taste followed rapidly by a nice banana flavour on the swallow which develops into a nice bready flavour, and finally to a gentle hop finish. Quite an interesting flavour profile - beer, banana bread, then back to beer. Well balanced with both the bananas and the malt and hops coming through. I'm impressed with this. A nice mouthfeel without too much carbonation. Overall a very interesting, and rather drinkable novelty beer. I wouldn't exactly make a session of it, but if you're looking for something out of the ordinary then seek this out.","foamer","Oct 18, 2004"
3.83,9.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a clear, deep amber color with creamy, off-white foam that settled to a thin coat that clung to the glass somewhat. The smell was very reminiscent of banana bread, with notes of light malt and caramel. The smell improved as the beer warmed. The taste was lightly tangy and malty with mild banana fruitiness overall with mild hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and modest carbonation. There was a lightly lingering aftertaste that was lightly tangy banana and malt with a bit off hops. This beer was really not bad. If you like banana or hefeweizens, you will probably like it.","UncleJimbo","Jul 16, 2004"
2.83,-19.4,3,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Other comments: When you see a beer called ""Banana Bread Beer"" you immediately scoff at it because of it's marketing ploy, but then you're almost forced to give it a try. That's what happened to me anyway. Definitely gimmicky, but it's not all-out crap like Banana Chapeau or something. Doesn't taste like it smells. The aroma is hyper-banana, but the banana-ness in the flavor is more like an overly estery hefeweizen.","GreenCard","Aug 22, 2003"
4.12,17.4,4,4.5,4,5,3.5,"Smooth mouthfeel. This beer is absolutely fantastic - considering the style I cannot fault it, aside from the fact that 3 or 4 would be quite sickly...this is definitely a non-session beer.","Doiv","Aug 15, 2002"
2.58,-26.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Before you even get to what it looks like, you get a big whiff of bananas. It definitely makes you think twice if you really want to drink a banana beer or not. The beer pours a slightly light amber color, with a hint of orange. Big head that goes away quickly. No real lacing down the glass. Did I mention the aroma of bananas? It also smells a bit bready. The predominate taste is....BANANAS! Go figure. There is a bit of a crispness in the background, along with a light maltiness. Did I mention the banana taste? It isn't going away. It really isn't overpowering, but it is all that is really there, and they are just too much to take. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think that I'll have another.","Boto","Beers"
2.85,-18.8,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"A strange beer i think. Sweetish doughy banana flavour (which, yes, ends up tasting like banana bread), but the palate was a little to sweet and even cloying, i thought it was pretty hard to down in the end, don't know if this beer quite worked for me.","rastaman","0"
