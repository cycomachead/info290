"On draft at a local and decided to try, glad I did. Great raspberry smell, not overbearing raspberry taste. A little sweet, but overall very easy to drink."

"My favorite fruit beer. What can I say Im a sucker for raspberries."
""
""
"Raspberry color, along with light hops and a good balance of grains and raspberry flavor make this one of my favorite summer beers."
"Aroma of tart raspberry juice, chemical, wheat, faint breadiness. Taste kool-aid type raspberry, grass, malt, synthetic. Wine cooler!"

"Not crazy about the raspberry"

"Was not sure what to expect when I first picked up a 6-pack on a trip to Atlanta.  I was extremely pleased with my purchase.  This is just a darn good Raspberry Hefeweizen!!!  If you like fruity beers, this would be a great one for you to try!!!  Great taste, aroma and definitely a nice smooth drink!!!  Enjoy!!!"

"O: This is a great raspberry beer. The sour character makes this really refreshing, and enjoyable. This might be an awesome complement to a late breakfast or even brunch, or for a lazy Saturday afternoon session. Recommended!"

"If you like Abita Purple Haze, this blows that RIGHT out of the water! Super amazing fresh raspberry smell and ending flavor, not too sweet, still tastes like a beer, not a wine cooler. I AM a big fan of fruiting the beer, and this is how it's done well. Very pleased. I got this as a single, so really I just picked it up for the raspberry. Once I opened it, I took a second look at the bottle and realized it was Harpoon. No wonder it's amazing."
""
""
"Final verdict: buy it on sale! I don't think that that its quite worth full price on the shelf, unless your looking for a great raspberry beer to break a newbie in with (for that, its also a great gateway beer)"

"Pours a light amber with short quickly fading head with some light lacing. Smells of raspberry and malt with no other notes coming forward on the nose. Tastes as one would expect but a watery finish took a lot from what this beer could have been capable of. Mouthfeel was just ok with some small light bubbles and light body."

"This beer is by far my favorite to drink; mostly in the summer but I love to relax with a couple pints in the winter as well. It doesn't have a fake raspberry flavor to it and goes down smooth. Sitting on the back porch outside in the sun is my favorite time to enjoy the lightly flavored raspberry and the smooth Hefeweizen beer!"

"O: disappointing excepting the flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O - Pleasantly suprised. Hefe's aren't really my thing and neither are fruit beers typically. But I really liked the subtle raspberry in this one, and the hefe qualities were great. I can certainly see myself drinking this again, and will also sample Harpoon's regualr hefe because of this stuff."

"I am not usually a huge fruited beer fan, but this one is exceptional by all standards. it pours a murky pink tinted wheat beer pale yellow color with a robust inch and a half of white head with superb retention. the nose is quite tart, taking on much more acidity and piquancy from the berries than jammy sweetness. light banana and clove from the yeast, a little dumbed down and Americanized from the authentic german hefes, but still in that vein. raspberry is more dominant than what malt in the taste, and I love the tartness here, almost having a wild ale sort of yeast and funk complexion, albeit more approachable and indeed more drinkable than most of those. very light in the finish, careful hopping provides enough bitterness to not let the berries be overly sweet, but not enough to make this a hoppy brew. the balance is expert. carbonated like soda, this is nice and refreshing when served ice cold in the summer. one of the better summer fruit beers, and one of harpoons best ufo brews."

"Pours a pink hazy orange with a frothy head that fades fast. Smell is dominated by raspberry, with some wheat and yeast coming through. Taste is all raspberry from start to finish with the wheat coming through at the end. Minot much else going on, a decent flavor but could have more depth. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, easy drinker, flavor doesn't get overwhelming. Overall a decent beer, nothing amazing going on here, but not bad."

"Overall – A relatively easy to drinking hefe with a moderate, but not obnoxious raspberry flavor."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and the raspberry aromas and flavors help to spice up hat would be a pedestrian American Pale Wheat Ale."
""
""
"O: Almost like wheaty, yeasty raspberry soda. Not much like beer at all. Not bad though. Easy enough to drink, but leaves this one for the girls who enjoy sweet fruity malt beverages"

"O: Not bad but nothing really special, it is just raspberry flavoring added to regular UFO - I really wish they had added some real raspberry into the process for brewing these so that some of the wonderful tartness of raspberries would come through. Easy to drink and a decent hot weather beer, just not something I would go out of my way to get again."
""
""
"Tartish raspberry and vegetal raspberry seeds up front. Moderate raspberry and cherry sweetness into the palate. Wheat bread and hefeweizen-ish yeasty fruit notes follow. Tartish raspberry stays throughout, providing a nice foil to the rest of the flavors. It also keeps the beer refreshing and light. Moderate body with a lively, sprightly feel. A nice summer quencher, especially if you like raspberries."

"O: well, I don't think I'll have this again, just wasn't that impressed for me, still good for the style"

"I give it props for having a true raspberry character with some great tartness in the flavor and some pucker in the feel. Criminal to call it a hefeweizen."

"It had a nice rose color body with a 2"" head that layed down quickly. The smell was of tart raspberries and some wheat. The taste was the same as the smell, nice raspberries and wheat on the back of the tongue. Mouth feel was great and a very drinkable beer."

"This has become a go to summer beer for me. It has just an amazing flavor and the raspberries give the Hefeweizen that extra flavor. I just started buying the UFO sample pack last year that includes their Hefeweizen, Pale Ale and White Ale. This was a summer staple for me last year after replacing the Sam Adams Summer Ale that as been on a steady decline for the past few years."

"From a bottle stamped Best By 04/15/12. Sampled on February 14, 2012. It pours a very heady, medium amber with a reddish tint when held to the light. Raspberries introduce themselves to the nose immediately with more muted bready malts and clean crisp mildly hopped character. It smells like it would be a great way to cool off on a hot day. The body is light to medium. The flavor has a lot of raspberry which tends to overtake everything else. Still it ends tart and slightly dry."

"Found at the Four Points hotel bar in Revere, MA, this brew shows a dark amber glow with yellow edges, a modest white head that dissipates quickly and leaves little sign of lacing. The aroma gives off mild tart raspberry and sweet grass. The flavor brings a sour raspberry with lemon wheat. There’s a dry citrus hop finish in this somewhat thin bodied summer brew with tiny bubbles to tickle the palate. It has a watermelon-like quality but to me this gets old fast. Not my favorite fruit beer. Could use more grainy substance to balance out the fruit tart theme, but it probably would make for a decent change up during the summer, served ice cold and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with maybe a slight blush of pink, two fingers of light foam that disappears very quickly. Aroma is strongly that of the raspberries promised on the label! Same goes for the taste, very fruit forward. Near perfect carbonation with no vile aftertaste! I talked my distributor into selling me this as a single, I'm going back tomorrow for the other 5!"

"Sneakily good - probably a better summer beer, being so light and easy."
""
"O - Did not knock my socks off. It is what it is. A good beach beer, nothing more, nothing less"
"The beer looks very pretty, it's orange with ruby hues and a tall frothy white head. It smells of raspberry and wheat and more raspberry. It tastes great to, I'm not a fan of fruit beers but this one is good. I tasted tart raspberry right from the start, it kind of makes the mouth pucker, there is a lot of wheat and a hint of lemon. This beer is light and the carbonation attacks the tongue. It finishes very dry. I thought this was the best of the UFO mixed pack I got, I was expecting it to be the worst but I was pleasantly surprised."
"D: I like fruit beers made with real fruit. It adds a roundness and well integrated complexity that really sets them apart. Instead of being annoyingly cloying (at worst) or just mindlessly drinkable – you get an interesting quencher. The brewery says natural fruit flavor rather than real fruit, but it seems authentic even if it is not real whole fruit."
"Poured on tap at a local irish pub, the beer was served in a pint glass. It pours a hazy, cloudy, red-tinged color, almost peachy, with a thin, foamy, dense layer of filmy head that coats the top of the beer, as well as any part of the glass it touches. The aromas are heavy raspberry sweet, with a deep, dark sweet aroma, like when you are mixing raspberry Jello with the boiling water. Flavors are surprisingly well blended, with an initial toasted grain flavor that is quickly followed by a strong, but not overpowering, raspberry tangy sweet character. The aftertaste is a bit of the toasted and a bit of the tangy sweet, but light overall. The finish is a bit tart, with a slight coating left behind. Tasty brew...great on a hot day."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It's not going to win awards as a great beer, but it's much better than I expected. It's not something I'll drink in the cold weather months, but hits the spot when Mother Nature brings the heat."
"Poured a bit purple-ish amber. Average head and wheat character, with a nicely crisp body. Even though the lable notes that natural raspberry flavor is added, it had a tinge of artificiality to it, and rang of flavoring adjunct rather than brewing component. Sweetness was well moderated so that it did not come across as a fruit cooler, but not the most impressive example, either."
"Overall: this was... generally nice. Nothing special, but enjoyable and refreshing. I know my review sounds 'meh', if anything, but I would buy this again for a summer quencher."
"overall I loved this beer. I am buying more of this until it's gone for the season. Almost the perfect summertime beer."
"I drank it, but it was an effort. Skip this one."
"The color of this beer is a nice pinkish red, and the nose delivers a light raspberry smell. I am able to drink a 6 pack of these and be perfectly content. It is not a beer that I tire of drinking easily. They are great on a hot summer day. The fruit complements the base beer very nicely. The ABV is just right. I enjoy regular UFO, but I will definitely choose this instead anytime."
"Overall - A wonderful spring / summer brew. You can drink a lot of these on a warm day. Perfect for outdoor outings / BBQ's - in fact, I drank it while grilling last night and it was incredibly smooth. Similar beers in this area are Southern Tier raspberry wheat. I'd definitely buy / try again."
"A very good choice for a BBQ beer. I've had this on tap as well and would not hesitate to have it again. If your looking to try something a little bit different this summer, I would try a bottle of this brew."
"O-A solid fruit beer, possibly the best of the UFO series from what I remember from the ones I haven't reviewed."
"Very similar to the white. A hazy golden yellow with a ruby hue. Slightly bubbly head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a sour raspberry smell with a backing of heffe yeast. The flavor is a ton of wheat upfront with the yeasty raspberry coming through. A medicinal raspberry flavor over a tangy wheat body. Could barely get through a bottle of this with the raspberry assaulting my taste buds."
"I liked this quite a bit. Very refreshing and easy to drink. Fantastic BBQ beer, and it would be really hard to find someone who honestly wouldn't like it."
"Overall this is very drinkable, especially for the warmer months and a much better choice over the typical Blue Moon or other summer seasonal beers available on tap at your average bar. Not the greatest fruit beer in the world, but it works."
"O- This beer really surprised me. The raspberry never got to be too much flavorwise which makes this a nice summertime beer. The ABV makes this a easy beer to sit around and have with friends. I really liked this beer maybe a little too much but we all have to have our guilty pleasure beers right??"
"O - This is a very good beer for what it is. If you like fruit wheats, this is one of the better brews out there for you. Perfectly balanced flavor profile, unique in color. I picture this is an excellent Summer beer. Now...if only it came in cans..."
"D - Very drinkable. Light and refreshing without being empty. The fruit addition on top of the hefewizen base is a really nice combination."
"This Raspberry wheat started off pretty good. The pour was nice with a big fluffy head on it. The beer was was cloudy golden yellow and not transparent at all. The smell was quite refreshing on this beer. It had the aroma of sweet fresh raspberries of course that were very pleasant. The flavors were a little on the weak side I thought. I guess I was hoping for more raspberry all over this one. A little bummed out that it wasn't a strong flavor. The mouthfeel was soft and mild, light carbonation. The beer is good I just wouldn't need to have it again."
"Will be a great beer for a cookout or lounging in the heat but enjoyable now in the winter as well. A good beer to get wine drinkers into the beer world with - ala Lambics."
"Was definitely intrigued when I first saw this and upon first taste it definitely lives up to the Raspberry name. Pinkish color with a sweet smell. Taste is somewhat tart but you can definitely taste the Raspberry. I can see it being a great session beer even though I wasn't too crazy about the tart aftertaste. It has a very soft mouthfeel, a little like soda to be honest and you can barely notice the alcohol."
"all in all, if you like fruity beer, give this one a shot."
"DB- I can see how this beer would really catch on with the main stream. Anyone who has ever mixed sparkling water with fruit juice knows this flavor. It just feels watered down overall, quite disappointing after a good aroma."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a light reddish-pink color with a head that is mostly white but has just the tiniest touch of a pink, bubble-gum-like hue. Nose is some fresh raspberries that are mostly sweet but a little bit tart. Taste is more raspberry with some faint wheat. Pretty light body and nice drinkability. It's definitely a fruit beer, but doesn't go too far."
"This beer pours a hazy dark color with a large head that stayed throughout. It smells of raspberries and beer; not the best combination. It tastes very strongly of raspberries and just a little bit of a wheat like beer taste. Doesnt tatse like beer really at all. Overall not bad if you like raspberries, not too much of a beer though."
"D- This is a very enjoyable beer. Easy to drink, however the sweetness might limit me to no more than 2 or so of these. Overall, I really liked this one."
"D - Well my friend hated it and I ended up drinking the rest as fast as I could to get rid of them but the tartness of the Raspberry's got so cloying after a while I just kept them till now. Would pass if it was offered to me today."
"Drink - Not my style of beer, my wife sure enjoyed it though. I can see how this would be appeal to some, especially during warmer weather."
"D: Very easy. No alc. Impressed by how fruity it really is. too sweet to have more then a couple."
"At the end of the day, it's drinkable. It's a bit one dimensional, but it isn't bad. I give them credit for making a fruit beer that actually tastes like the fruit it's supposed to, and does so without seeming artificial."
"This beer is a little like beer-soda, but it's really quite good and I think it's one of the best of its class!"
"Maybe it's really the style that I'm displeased by, not the particular beer. Pretty good as far as fruit beers go, but still didn't really do it for me."
"overall quite good for what it is. it's got nice raspberry flavor in spades."
"UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen is a good offering from Harpoon. The base beer, what I can tasteof it, really isn't a hefeweizen more of an American wheat, but truly the Raspberries dominate in this beer and provides the majority of the flavor and aroma. The smell of raspberry manifests as the cap is popped and perfumes the air as the beer is poured. The color is a orangey red with a wispy white lacing. The raspberry flavor is pronounced and tastes very fresh. Overall, the beer is tastes like its a common wheat beer with a couple jolly ranchers dissolved into it. Good in it's own way, but a little too sweet and candy-like to be a great beer."
"This is a great summer beer and goes down easy."
"D-Very, very drinkable. A great session beer for a hot summer night...or day. I love this beer. I get made fun of sometimes because of its pink hue. But man, this is an underrated beer. If you like raspberries, and you would rather taste real raspberries rather than artificial Splenda aided raspberry flavor, try this. Don't let the pink color fool you. This one is a great time!"
"Drinkability - very drinkable, its so good you just want more."
"This is a highly drinkable raspberry hefeweizen. Refreshment on a hot summer day, that offers a unique spin on the style."
"Meh. Avoid."
"Quite hazy, pink grapefruit colour with next to no cap. Fruity aroma, raspberry, slight banana. You can pick up a hint of wheat if you really try, but it could just be an illusion. The flavour was heavy with raspberry, but the mineral character and coarse carbonation made it taste processed and artificial. Light bodied, high carbonation, a bit dry. I really like raspberries so I hoped this beer would impress me, but it just didn't work for me at all."
"pretty good drinkability, but the rasberry taste gets a little old after awhile. i would have like to seen a little more hefe characteristics come through. i prolly wouldnt buy this again, but it was nice to try."
"Pours a hazy grapefruit like color with some visible carbonation and a thick three finger head which disapates to a skim with very little lacing. The aroma is fanstastic, it hits you as soon as you open the bottle. The smell of raspberries and flowers hits your nose. The taste is very good also, the taste is a wheat backbone with a tart raspberry taste. The taste is like a real raspberry not artificial and super sweet. The carbonation is moderate and creamy. Overall on a hot day on your porch you could make this a great session beer. A great aroma and a smooth taste make this a great beer."
"MD- A little thin but very drinkable. If you like fruit beers you will love this one."
"Overall I don't think I would get this again; I liked it but my buddies were not impressed and I like regular hefeweizens better."
"goes down pretty smoothly. does not offer much to make me want another, or to even finish this one. I just think they were in between a few ideas. it definitely fits some tastes, however."
"Overall: I like hefeweizens and I like fruit beers, if they are not sweet, especially in the summer. I saw this come in and since I enjoyed the Abita Purple Haze enough, I did some reading up on the UFO. I am glad I decided to get it, without a doubt a perfect summer quencher. It is light, yet, has flavor. Oftentimes summer beers mean light dreary wheat that lacks zing. That is not the case with this beer."
"D: A summer beer for sure, this one is very easy drinking. Raspberry flavor almost makes it a sour with none of the complexity. Watery in the mouth and a real thirst quencher. However, I'm looking for a little more than just quenching in my beers so I'll pass unless this is the only around."
"D: Not a huge fan of ""fruit"" beers, but this one was certainly drinkable. Worth a try, but maybe not something you would want more than a few of."
"The beer has a slight reddish hue the white head dissipated very quickly, almost like soda. The smell is of raspberry booth sweet and tart. This beer starts sweet and finishes refreshingly tart. The tart finish separates this from most typical soda beers, it makes it refreshing and nice."
"A nicely done fruit beer - raspberries add to a beer that is American pale wheat with a HW influence. Not too sweet - a very refreshing brew. Raspberry doesn't overwhelm. This is how American fruit beers should be!"
"D – A fantastic beer, regardless of style. Very drinkable."
"If you like raspberry or berry flavors, this is the best I have had and I've tried many fruit flavored beers. This is the best raspberry hands down. Probably better on tap than in the bottle, but the fresher the better nonetheless."
"Overall while not the greatest fruit beer in the world it works. Light and clean, very easy to drink. I would not mind trying it again,"
"Overall: I prefer the original but this one was worth a try. As mentioned in the drink-ability its easy to session thats for sure and if i'm ever in the mood to have some raspberries in my swill this will be a go-to."
"Drinkability: Just an all around great beer. Any friend I introduce it to proceeds to tell me that they are going to go pick some up...right then. Probably best on a hot summer day, but I think I could drink this beer anytime, all the time. Its that delicious and sweet."
"Overall a very good beer, refreshing and easily drinkable. Just the right mix of tart/sweet to keep you interested."
"D- Its something I would like to have every now and then but its definitely not my go to beer for kicking back on the deck in the summer. I cant really have more than 1 or 2 without getting sick of the flavor."
" William of Bama"
"12 oz brown glass bottle obtained from Shaw's Supermarket Derry, NH. hazy orange with a pinkish undertone color with a half inch of off white head that doesn't last very long. Very fruity smell, the raspberries is very prominent with a bready undertone. raspberry-ish taste with cracker like after taste. light/medium mouthfeel. very drinkable."
"There's a nice cloudy pinkish hue. Decent head retention and lacing. Very difficult to see through. The most powerful odor to come off of this beer is raspberry for sure. It smells like raspberry jam. My wife barged in and claimed her love for it and I told her to ""get the hell out of here I haven't even tasted it yet"". Very mild, sweet, and sour. Very much like raspberries. There's a hint of ""typical wheat beer"" characteristic but the most abundant flavor is raspberry and it's very good. Tasty."
"I know that most don't like fruit beers but this one is worth the try. I loved it, was surprised by it and will have it again."
"Overall, a decent fruit beer that could amke for sa refreshing drink on a warm summer day."
"12oz. Poured a hazy pinkish color with a decent off white head with maybe a pinkish tinge also. Aroma was raspberries and that's about it. Tastes were mainly artificial raspberry with a slight biscuity-wheaty character. Overly sweet and artificial tasting. More tartness may have helped to balance the sweetness out. Decent in small doses, but there are better fruit beers out there in my opinion. Once again, I think the term Hefeweizen is misleading (as with their regular UFO)."
"D- Not bad for a fruit beer. Not really something that I usually go for, but I think it's a good representation of the style."
"RECOMMENDED!"
"M/D - nice carbonation & a bit of zip to it, but the taste seems too artificial to me"
"drinkability - Lambics are not my thing but being this is a Hefe style I can drink this. Worth a try on a hot day."
"This would make a great session beer and is thus far the best fruit beer I've had."
"Overall, I'm definitely interested in buying a 6-pack of this stuff if I can find it. This is a great fruit beer, period."
"D: Good stuff overall, which comes exactly as advertised. I wouldn't go overboard, but it can be sessioned too easily. A sun beer, that comes recommended."
"Smells like raspberry ginger ale with a slightly buttery yeast tang. Tastes like raspberry ginger ale with a slightly buttery yeast tang. Offensively tart in all the wrong places. Not much wheat here at all, some citrus hops would really have complemented the flavor. As with most fruit beers, this is a one and done."
"Drinkability: this is a one glass beer as the fruitiness grows a bit tiring. Nice flavor but in short bursts only."
"D - excellent. could drink these pops all night. The GF really enjoyed this beer. Too bad we only got one sample bottle."
"I would have to be truthful and say that I did not find this first experince with Raspberry UFO as being a posistive one. I think the main reason that I may have been turned off was the aftertaste and this beer being in the wrong glass. I think a tulip glass may have improved the experience so a second review will be in order."
"Overall - Still not very impressive, but a bit better than the regular UFO hefe. It's kind of like a run-of-the-mill wheat ale with raspberry thrown in."
"None of this is overpowering, but a decent drinking hefe."
"Overall, I really dislike this beer, but I'm being really open-minded in my ratings. Just a little underdone in every category. I cannot see myself having more than one at a time, or another one in my lifetime, for that matter."
"D- I'm having trouble finishing this one...."
"Still not a big fan of this. I would rather have something that taste like beer. But this isn't too bad, I can drink it. Not gonna lie, kinda makes me feel girly though. I feel like it takes points off my man card."
"Can see this being refreshing in the summer, but i would still plump for a reputable german weizen such as Weihenstephan or a frambozen from liefmans for something fruit based."
"Overall a very solid beer. Great raspberry flavoring without being too overpowering. The only big negative is the wheat like flavor that is somewhat dominant in the beer."
"Light bodied and pretty drinkable. I am not a fan of fruit beers however and this one would not help convert me."
"Drinkability: Very easily consumed, light bodied and tasty...I could see these things disappear on a hot summers day. My only gripe is the sweetness. I would imagine this beer would be much better with a little less ""sweetness""."
"An okay beer, good if you like raspberries. Somewhat of an acerbic mouthfeel makes this just another middle of the road fruit beer brewed with wheat in the grain bill."
"4/3/3/2/6 (1.8/5)"
"A 12oz bottle poured into a clean, clear 16oz mixing glass. The beer has a pinkish, orange tint, brought on by the addition of raspberries. The head also has a mild tint to it. This beer has a unique appearance, enhanced by the clear glass being used. The smell is of fresh berries. The head lingers more than I would expect from a fruit beer, a positive. There is no mention of the ABV on the bottle, which is a negative, even though I know it is 5.1 from this website, as well as Harpoon's. The taste is very crisp, light, and assertive. Fresh berries abound, with lasting notes on the tongue. An enjoyable beer, especially on a hot summer day. Would probably layer nicely with a Guinness float, if you wanted to cut the flavor."
"D- only if someone gave/bought me one or if selection is slim."
"Don't think I'll look to buy this one again"
"Appearance was a tad disappointing, with a minimal head and pinkish copper tone. Smell was mainly raspberry syrup, with a hint of malt. Taste was overly that of raspberry, not much wheat or malt coming through. Mouthfeel was dry, with a lightly bitter finish. Drinkability was ok, but nothing spectacular."
"Eric"
"A pretty decent beer, would make for a refreshing summer brew. I probably couldn't have more than one or two in one session though."
"D: A very drinkable brew for the summer... I tend to like blueberry fruit beers more, but this it the best Raspberry beer I've had... Give it a try on a hot summer evening..."
"MF&D - I wish I would have known how good this beer was while the warm weather was hear. I'm sure it would be a hit with the ladies."
"Really drinkable beer. Maybe it's just because I love Raspberry, but this is a good beer."
"Have had worse. Not my thing, really but drinks OK enough."
"D - This is an alright brew and while it luckily doesn't cross the line of overly fruity and too sweet, it also isn't interesting enough to come back to. Easy drinking, but fairly boring."
"Significantly better than the standard UFO hefe, the touch of raspberry adds what the other doesn't have.. flavor! Not my favorite style but I found it pretty tasty and drinkable which works in my book."
"D: Would be good quencher on a nice hot summer day by itself but not necessarily a session. Still drinks and fairs much better then their original hefeweizen."
"Nice appearance and aroma. Unusual combination of dryness and sweetness. Starts off dry and then sweet, maybe a little too sweet, at the end. Would possibly enjoy more on a hot summer day, as I assume is intended. Would buy again in a 6 pack to give it a chance, as I just bought 1 bottle to taste."
"Pours a strange reddish-orange hue with a miniscule head that seems slightly shaded pink. Nose is dominated by a raspberry jam aroma and not much else. Somewhat watery palate, starting off with more raspberries before simplifying down to a wheaty, dry, crisp finish with almost no bitterness to speak of. Not too sweet, thankfully, but just not really my style."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a orangeish-red color with a minuscule white head (with a red tint). Initial smell is raspberry (naturally), with a bit of hops. Kind of smells like cherry 7-up. Flavor is tart and finishes bitter. Very thin feel, watery, and a bit over-carbonated. Not bad overall, just a bit too tart and fruity."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. A good taste and decent mouthfeel make drinking it very easy. Definitely an excellent summer beer overall."
"Drinkability- It is seems like it would be a good summer day beer it is pretty refreshing or a party beer."
"Alluring, cloudy pink/orange color with ruby highlights like clover honey. Slightly pink head that faded fairly quickly with little lacing. Very aromatic raspberry smell without being artificial. Sweet and tart flavors of raspberry and some wheat. High carbonation and a watery mouthfeel. Summery yes, but a little weak for my preference. Long tart finish but it left me with a weird aftertaste. More of a fruit beer than a Hefeweizen."
"From Notes"
"Overall, this brew is decent on a hot day, but I would not drink too many otherwise"
"Feel has a slight to medium body, and the carbonation is adequate, although maybe a little too aggressive for a hefe. Drinkability is high due to it being tasty, refreshing and easily found."
"Pours a clear amber that has a ruby hue to it. Looking at it makes me think of a rose champagne. Nose is raspberries, almost like a syrup was added. Flavor has a fully artificial edge to it. Raspberries, yes. Syrup, yes. Real fruit? No. It's like drinking fruit juice. Feel has a biting carbonation to it and the liquid is slick. Easy to drink, but more alco-pop than fine beer. Pass."
"Overall: An excellent offering for the summer. It'll taste great as a lawnmower beer or, even better, paired with a salad."
"D- Once again the fruit beers are not for me. Glad I got to try it but I'll pass on this one."
"I was also taken by how perfectly carbonated this beer is; it's very bubbly, a feature that would make it particularly satisfying on a hot day. And at a relatively low 4.8% alcohol content, you can safely drink a bunch as you while away a day in the sun."
"This brew from Harpoon is one of my favorite summer beers. I was a little hesitant at first as Hefe is one of my favorite styles of beer and I am not a big fan of fruit in my beer. I'm glad I decided to try this one a few years ago. The beer pours a little cloudy with an interesting reddish hue. The smell of raspberries is intoxicating, no pun intended. The beer flows smooth and you can enjoy this all day long on a hot summer day. I enjoy this beer so much that I had to purchase my own UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen glass. The beer is an interesting twist on the traditional hefeweizen and it will certainly have you coming back for more."
"As many others have stated, the first thing one will notice when drinking is the instant aroma. Personally, I felt the aroma was nice but not what I wanted in a beer. For me, it was a bad sign of what was to come in drinking it. Pours very nicely and has a wonderful orange to pinkish color. Easily drinkable but the Hefeweizen style and Raspberry flavor for this particular beer doesn't mix well. Would recommend drinking something else although try it at least once for its interesting taste."
"A very solid fruit beer. I enjoy it much more than the regular UFO. A flavorful, ultra-refreshing, unfiltered fruit beer...that's all it is. Note to self: buy more Raspberry UFO throughout the summer."
"Not bad, not bad. Raspberry is good in beer apparently."
"Poured a medium coppery red with a fair head on it. The raspberry smell was immediate and intense. The taste was more of the same-- a strong amount of raspberries into a pretty straightforward wheat beer. It seemed just the right amount of berry in this one. The brew seemed pretty carbonated and although pretty good, it'd be slow going to have more than one of these fruity beverages in a row. It's just not my bag."
"Incidentally this site lists the beer as 5.1% - the label on my bottle states 4.7% abv - are there two versions?"
"Drinkability: Just the right amount of raspberry flavor. I could even clear through an entire pint of this stuff and not lose my cool, though any more might be a slightly daunting task."
"Crisp, smooth and medium-light bodied. Refreshing change of pace. Palate cleansing with a nice tart finish."
"M/D: A light beer that was very reminiscent of a soda. It was quite easy to drink and enjoyable but it sported a significant amount of carbonation which mixed in with the sugary smell and taste made it very much like a spiked soda."
"D: This beer is a little sweet for me and I wouldn't want more than one in a setting. Still a good tasting fruit beer."
"This 12 pack was my first experience with the Raspberry Hefeweizen and I must say that I was impressed. The brew poured to a dull golden/amber color and seemed to have a slight red hue to it. Medium sized off white head that also seemed to have a red/pink hue that had some retention and left some fair lacing. The aroma has a very strong berry scent, much more than I was expecting. Also present and noticeable is the nice wheat scent. The flavors where very nice, strong raspberry flavor that has a slight tart feel to it. The wheat flavors take a back seat in this one but based on the berry flavor I think that is ok. Nice carbonation that helps add a slight spiciness with what I guess might be some hops in the background? To me this is a very good beer, I suppose that it could be because it is so different that what I would normally expect."
"D - Overall, a very nice fruit beer - maybe the best non-sour one I've had. I like how this is very low on the bitterness scale, and really accents the fruit."
"This has a very original auroma and flavor. I've had a few different raspberry beers and one thing I like about this one is that the flavor isn't too overpowering."
"It pours a cool cloudy peach color with a big foamy white head that makes sweet lace patterns on my hefeweizen glass. Perfume like raspberry hits the nose as the bottle is opened. The flavor and body were very light and thin. The flavor has some tart raspberry with hints of lemon and melon. The palate is to light and thin with some light fizzy carbonation. The finish is abrupt and leaves me wanting something more. Overall it has a good taste but lacks depth and body."
"Pours a very bright lavender color, almost pink, with just a slight bit of head and no lacing (not unusual for a wheat beer); it had just a little too much color for me. Nice scent, all of it raspberry, though; I could get hints of the crisp wheat beer in it, but nothing of a malty or straw aroma. Excellent taste, though, the raspberry is strong and dominant, but here is where the wheat beer comes through, with a nice refreshing sweetness. Excellent mouthfeel, too, it goes down very well. Not my favorite fruited wheat, as it was a little too over done with the raspberries, but still quite good."
"D: For me, a little of this goes a long way. Although interesting, and relatively enjoyable, there wasn't anything that was compelling me to consume with any fervor."
"The taste hits you with the fruit flavor early but the aftertaste dries out a bit but not in a positive way. The texture is flat and fairly lifeless. I can see this being somewhat refreshing on a ht day but I'm just not feeling it. This is a typical fruit beer; it's not terrible and has some things to recommend it but it doesn't really give me the full beer experience and I won't look for it again."
"D: Very drinkable beer. I'll definitely have some of this around for myself after a workout or run. It also would do nicely for a party or get-together--a fresh, fun beer to have around to change things up."
"Overall, I would not consider this beer extremely drinkable. The taste was quite harsh to my mouth, but I would suggest it to anyone do to its uniqueness."
"I had this on tap at the brewery. It was tough to finish two ounces, it's overwhelmingly sweet and tastes like a wine cooler more than a beer. The majority of our group wasn't impressed with this beer. I certainly won't buy it and would suggest numerous other 'fruit' beers ahead of this one."
"D - Goes down easy, but not memorable... A one and done type brew... Very few characteristics of a good hefeweizen are present..."
"this beer was well balanced, I could drink it all afternoon wroking outside in a hot weather."
"Not good to me, but the lady likes it."
"D:It's a very drinkable beer. It's light and refreshing. The raspberry goes really well with the hefeweizen and does not try to over power it."
"A wonderful lighter alternative to a Framboise... perhaps a warm weather offering."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable beer, very easy on the stomach. You could drink up to 12 of these with no issues."
"Drinkability- I'll definatly by another six pack of this. This is a fruit beer, If you don't like sweet and you don't like fruit this isn't for you. For the rest of us who like a decently sweet beer without that bitter twinge, Drink up!"
"D: I could probably have a couple in warmer weather but I probably won't."
"D--Not really feeling their wheat beers. Way too tannic tasting. I believe there are other versions out there of fruit wheat beers that are better. This one would be nice if it just didn't have that awkward tannic bite at the end. Annoying rather than quenching because of it."
"D - Not too bad, for a fruit beer. My only main gripe was its deviation from a true hefeweizen, it was more watery and not thick and cloudy, maybe a bad batch. I would be willing to try again."
"Drinkability: Definitely a chick beer. Although not horrible, this isn't complex enough to be a good beer. Very simple. This could serve as a beer to bridge the gap to craft beer. Won't go out of my way to revisit."
"The mouthfeel was light and mildly fruity, with a mild raspberry aftertaste. I feel as though the raspberry worked well with the wheat flavors. I very much enjoyed this beer and would love to find it on draft."
"Overall, a pretty decent fruit beer. Just make sure it's not ice cold."
"from one of them Christmas gift mix-packs"
"An interesting variation on a hefeweizen, would be interested in seeing more of these types."
"D: If you like raspberries and weizens, then I'd said you'd love this. I'm not extremely fond of weizens and raspberries are just ok. Not a terrible brew(easy to drink, interesting taste) and something different, but it's not something I'd bet on coming back to."
"Poured into a weizen glass with lots of room for head. The color was surprisingly pink with some orange and red mixed in. The light pink head was very large. Very cool, I'm not used to seeing a beer with that color unless it's a Belgian fruit lambic. Big raspberry aroma but it pretty much overpowers any malt or hop aroma. Very sweet, almost spritzy, taste. Carbonation was fairly high but suited the beer well, making it refreshing and quenching. A little too artificial tasting to become something that I would continually stock my fridge with, but a nice change from a traditional hefeweizen."
"This is an interesting beer. It pours a pinkish color with a pink head, kind of like ruby red grapefruit juice that's carbonated. The aroma is a of very strong raspberries. The taste is overwhelmingly raspberry. Probably too strong for a beer, but it is actually kind of refreshing. The wheaty malty taste comes through in the aftertaste and it really is a nice wheat aftertaste but still very overwhelmingly raspberry-y. Great for someone who doesn't like beer though..."
"Poured a bubbly golden with an off-white, frothy head. Looks pretty good in the glass. Smell was of tart fruit, raspberry, as advertised, with a soft clove-like aroma. Taste was really dry and acidic for me, due to the raspberries, no less. Just a subtle hint of the crisp wheat malt, but the tartness really overpowered it. Mouthfeel was light and quickly dissipated across the palate. Fairly easy to drink, if you can get past the tartness. Not a bad beer, just not one of my faves."
"The taste is good at first, but after a few sips the blandness kicks in. Some creamy vanilla notes pair with a hint of raspberry and a dominant, wheaty note. Mouthfeel is refreshing, but not much else. Too much carbonation and a watery thin body leave me wondering if this is beer or raspberry-flavored, flat champagne. I can't say I'd ever buy this on my own, but for what it is, I suppose it could be worse."
"A nice head that disolves but never disappears, over a cloudy pink color. Aroma is unmistakably ""berry"". Taste follows and it's almost hard to find the ""beer"" taste underneath all the berry flavoring. The aftertaste is...you guessed it...more berry. I don't want this to necessarily sound bad, because the flavor is not unpleasant at all. Easy to drink one or two, but not many more."
"After drinking (and liking) Harpoon Peche, I had high hopes for UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen. I thought maybe these guys had figured out this whole fruit beer thing. Not quite, but this is still a decent warm weather beer that should appeal to a wide range of people."
"I recommend this beer, especially when sitting outside on a nice day watching the sun go down."
"I really enjoy this beer on hot days during the summer. Pours with a nice head, although it dissipates quickly; very little lacing remains during the tasting. Amber-pink in appearance and somewhat cloudy. I've had varying experiences relative to the visibility of yeast in the glass; guess it depends on the batch. However, my expectation is that there should be some residual yeast floating in the brew. Nice subtle smell of raspberry, but not overpowering. Very pleasant in the mouth. A little bit of a tingle on the tongue, with a slightly tart finish that leaves the taste of raspberry on the taste buds. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a pinkish hue. It has a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a smooth hefe taste with loads of fresh raspberry flavoring. It's quite fruity and refreshing. The taste is decent. It has a light hefe flavor that goes down down quick and finishes crisp and fruity. It's dry and tart with a lingering raspberry flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I wish the taste was as fruity as the aroma. It's a bit too dry for me. All in all, a fine fruit beer."
"Girlfriends can rejoice over this one though; it'll save your guy from having to order a Mich Ultra or Smirnoff Ice, and I'm sure they'd appreciate the effort to foray into diverse brews. I give Harpoon credit for creating something different as a cousin to their regular UFO."
"Good mouth feel, refreshing but not something I could drink all night. Tastes of raspberries, some citrus and a slight acidic character. Good for the hot summer days."
"Overall impression: Not a bad fruit beer - probably would be a great gateway, and they definitely go down easy on a warm day."
"I guess it was a no-brainer to take the classic UFO and add raspberries for a summer seasonal. Beer fares well with the additions. I have always found the base beer (UFO) to be a bit sub-par compated to good German classics, but the fruit flavors contribute a ton of raspberry character. The wheat malt nose is dwarfed by strong, ripe, raspberries, tartness, and a bit of an earthy acidity. The color shows a typically hazy appearance with a ruby-red grapefruit color and fair head retention and fair lacing. The flavors are also dominated by berry sweetness and tartness, leaving a hint of wheat malt, bready, estery flavors to fight through late. Moderately full body, with a thinning tartness and mild astringency if the finish. I like the beer, but it is not as subtley flavored as Purple Haze and many other Raspberry Wheats."
"I will keep exploring this genre as I feel it could be great. However, this is more a beer for your girlfriends who want a lighter, fruity beer."
"Probably the best raspberry beer i've tasted. Easy to drink, while not being too overly sweet."
"This is one adventure i am glad i went on, when first trying this i was skeptical, after trying many other fruit flavored beers and being highly disappointed, this was the saving grace for flavored beer."
"D - I enjoyed this beer, but it is too fruity to drink a lot of"
"Pours and smells like it should be very flavorful, but the taste was like weak raspberry flavored soda water. I do not usually like these flavored wheats, but I gave it a shot considering it was new to the area and I enjoy most of what Harpoon brews. Unfortantly, I could not even finish it. Maybe just not my style."
"Poured a hazy pink-gold color with a decent head. Good carbonation. The aroma is full of real raspberry scents. In many of these summer fruit beers it just tastes like fruit was added to a basic beer but this one works well. The raspberry flavor compliments the beer well creating an insanely crisp and refreshing drink. The mouth is thin to moderate. This blows the regular UFO(which i find to be quite bland) away."
"I was actually looking forward to trying this, as I got it as a free sample from a friend. I always enjoyed the regular UFO, so the addition of the raspberries made it interesting to grab my attention. Unfortunately, it failed to win over my tastebuds, as well."
"Appears an amber clouded opaque tone with a largely formed rough textured head sticks around for awhile forms sporadic chunks of lacing as it dwindles the color is an off white hue with a pinkish tint to it. Aromatics contain tart raspberry with a mild citrus sharp sweet note coming about with a bready biscuit malt presence along with those mildly acidic wheat notes yeast tone gives it a funky mix as well. Flavors blend decently because the brew doesn't show off any sugary sweet concentrate kinda of like a nice tart raspberry puree here with the yeast, wheat, and malt components leveling out the vibe a bit, I actually dig this more than the UFO Hefeweizen still no clove and banana action b/c this is an American Wheat but it does the trick in delivering a fruit beer without candy sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium to light in body with enough carbonation to tickle the back of the throat with each sip overall not something that seems like a smooth sipping brew. Drinkability for me I couldn't have more than a couple of these and I wouldn't necessarily crave another one I could see how people afraid of craft brews could find comfort in something like this."
"This beer pours a nice red color, like raspberries as expected. The aroma is strong and full of raspberry aroma. There's not much to indicate that it's a hefeweizen. Taste is a different matter though as it starts to blossom as a hefeweizen with strong raspberry overtones.The flavor is well balanced though and doesn't have the consistency of cough syrup or nothing like that. Not too sweet either."
"I was not a big fan of this one. I think the fruit beer balance was right on, but the raspberry flavor was off. Smell was of sharp sour raspberries, with some doughy aspects. Taste had nice malt notes, along with some good bitter hops presence. The raspberry, however was sharp and oily. It reminded my of accidentally fermented berries, or maybe a raspberry seed extract. I'm eager to try the normal UFO to compare, but the flavor of this one was not what I wanted"
"My wife's new favorite beer. I can't share her enthusiasm. It's a hazy red/orange color with a small head. Sweet, fruity aroma with a little grain. The raspberry flavor is there, but it tastes artificial. A little malt as well. This is an OK beer, but I think I'll stick to a plain hefe."
"Solid offering. I recommend trying it at least twice."
"Since this is the first hot day in quite some time here in Boston, I was in the mood for something a little different and refreshing. I gotta say Im not such a fan of the regular UFO offering, but maybe the raspberry aspect will spruce it up a bit. It poured into a Magic Hat Hocus Pocus weizen glass a pale, somewhat murky light pink. Heading was thin and minimal, but not altogether unappealing looking. In the aroma were light sweet raspberries, a bit of lime...very similar to how a fruit flavored gingerale smells. The raspberries become a bit more tart when tasting, with some green leaf flavors, more citrus notes, and maybe a bit of watermelon. Mouthfeel was light, crisp, and very refreshing. I could definitely make a session with this beer, especially on hot days like today. This might not be the best fruit brew i've tasted, but its a solid offering. Recommended."
"Drinkability - Good summer brew. I really liked the Harpoon UFO offering and decided to try this one. I was not disappointed. I'll keep this in my frige this summer for a nice refreshing offering."
"Overall- Not bad if you drink ONLY 1!"
"Very drinkable, but more like a soda in my opinion, especially with the heavy carbonation."
"This one is enjoyable...certainly more enjoyable than I was expecting. It's got flavour and is well balanced and is a nice thirst quencher. I don't know that I could drink this all night, but I could easily have this one again. Try it."
"I will never drink one of these again."
"The taste is way too sour and fizzy for my liking. I don't mind a fruit beer every once and a while, but the raspberry syrup is too much to overcome. There is a slight wheat or bread flavor, but again, it's soured by the soda-like syrup and carbonation. Mouthfeel is way too thin for a hefe. I'll be honest, I had a hard time finishing this beer. I wouldn't even recommend it to fruit beer fans. Go with Sam Adams' Cherry Wheat if you must."
"Poured a rich hazy raspberry tinted pale with a great hefe head that even had just the slightest raspberry red tint to it. The aroma was strong on raspberries and not much else. The taste was also strong on raspberries but of course had the typical characteristics of a hefeweizen behind it. The beer was good and carbonated as a hefe should be. This was quite enjoyable as my taste for wheat beers grows with spring coming back in bloom."
"D: Nowhere near as tasty as the original UFO, didn’t go down very easily for me, not very filling, everything I’ve had from Harpoon so far has been at least decent and some have been very good, however I did not like this beer at all."
"pours a cloudy peach / pink color with a three finger light pinkish head with some lacing to the finish. nice raspberry aroma hit you even as you pour it. nice tartness to the taste. mouthfeel was crisp, light, refreshing, dry. i was very leery about trying this beer but found it very good. i think for a summer time refresher it would be just great and i really liked the way it looked in the glass."
"This beer is as bad as Rex Grossman ....Which this gentleman , Grossman cost me some cash . Poured a pinkish / light red color ..The smell was fruit ( raspberry / strawberry ) nice head . Smell of Life Savers & Crystal Light . Taste was bland , boring and blah . It was better than the UFO - rubbish - . but that is not saying much . The taste is too watery for me . More like a wine cooler than a beer to me . I tried to like this , had 3 of them then wrote my notes . Gave the rest to the lads to enjoy . They still like drinking the Coors Light / Bud light swill ..Thans to Rex I did not need that $125.00 you eejit . ...Hold on to the ball .."
"Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass, beer is a peachy cloudy color with a very small bubbly head. The smell is definitely of raspberries, almost wine cooler like. The taste is also dominated by raspberries, with the malt taste being almost completely hidden and a very light hop finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall, I would have to say that the downfall of the drinkability is the overpowering sweetness of the raspberries. Otherwise a good tasting beer, preferably in small amounts."
"Pours a light straw color with a light, bud-like head that rapidly comes and goes. Huge carbonation. Big fat bubbles. Smells like...raspberries. That's about it, maybe a hint of wheat but not much to notice. Taste is, again, of raspberries and not much else except for a funky skunky taste in the finish. It's like drinking raspberry seltzer water/beer. Very watery and very carbonated. I couldn't finish this beer, not even close. I had to hand it off to my girlfriend who gladly accepted. I'll pass. This is one beer that is safe in the fridge from me stealing from her."
"Had a bottle of this stuff in the afternoon, after my classes. I must say I was very disappointed. It poured a bubbly head that disappeared within seconds and the beer itself is of copper/amber color. There was a good scent of raspberries but not as good as I would have predicted. The taste was overwhelmingly fruity and I could barely taste the wheat. Its different and worth a shot, but I won't be having another one of these anytime soon."
"A nice above average beer. Raspberry aroma and taste blend for a nice tart summer beer. Enjoy this with a nice piece of chocolate cake as an after dinner pairing. Check it out if you like fruit beers."
"DA: This is a nice very-hot day style beer."
"A hazy beer for a hazy summer day. Very quenching!"
"Drinkability: Low. The fruit is too much."
"- Cheers!"
"A hazey golden amber beer with a slight pink tint. Has a small white head. The aroma reminds me of a lambic, lightly fruity sour and tart. The raspberry hits the tip of your tongue first. Then the sour tartness takes over the rest. The sharp tartness on the finish keeps this from being an overly sweet fruit beer. I found it to be quite refreshing on a hot day after driving home from work. Having a six of this in the fridge just to have something refreshing to throw down your throat is not a bad idea."
"This one is worth a trying if you come across it."
"I was very stunned with this beer. At first it tasted like a malt beverage (like those mike drinks) but as it went down each sip got smoother and smoother. I could deffinetly taste the wheat in it, but it just had this nice hint of raspberry and was no overbearing, while still maintaining the fact that it is a beer and should taste like one! Very well done!"
"Overall, this fails due to the flavor seeming artificial."
"This is a refreshing and crisp beer I definitely enjoy having around in warm weather, if a little bit of a gimmick. Not likely to drink many in one sitting. I would prefer this rather than Berliner Weiss with added raspberry syrup, but probably not as much or as often as a high quality German or American unfiltered Hefeweiss with a slice of lemon dropped in."
"A decent fruit beer that is merely lacking in substance."
"Overall, the beer is alright and I would imagine that it would be a popular addition to any backyard BBQ. This is a good summer beer, but I would take long trail's blackberry wheat over the UFO Raspberry any day."
"This release also fills a gap in Harpoon's portfolio, so not only is this a fun release for fruit beer lovers, but it's a smart one."
"Highly recommend this selection for those hot summer days ahead!"
"Lack of balance in flavor. Haphazardly thrown together that comes across in the flavor."
"Pours a cloudy orange-amber color with a thin head that's quick to fade. Smell is straightahead raspberries. Carbonation is prickly on the tongue. Taste is tart, not sweet or cloying. There are no signs of the usual Hefeweizen lurking in the background. Kind of reminded me of a Jolly Rancher. An easy to drink beer that would probably be refreshing on a hot day. I couldn't make it a session beer, but could probably have a couple before needing to move on to something else."
" The alcohol can barely be discerned while drinking this, and there isn't a lot of carbonation to accompany the taste of this. Still, it was enjoyable and well suited to someone who would like to get into craft beer more. I was hoping for more of an unfiltered taste, but this brew is even smoother and easier to enjoy than the wheat beers of recent. A welcome addition to my spring and certainly worth a try for a wide range of beer enthusiasts!"
"Pours a reddish-orange with a white foamy head. Smell is obvious without even bringing the glass to your nose; very strong raspberry aroma. Taste is also very fruity; refreshing raspberry flavor, with subtle wheat and yeast flavors in the background. This is an extremely drinkable beer, especially with the summer coming up. This would be a great beer to introduce the macro drinker to something with some character."
"D  Very drinkable, top notch fruit beer. I originally picked this up to share with my girlfriend but it might not make it that far. Great change of pace."
"The mouthfeel is a bit harsh due to the fruit's acidity, but that's par for the course with this style. It's a pretty drinkable beer for a fruit beer. It's not where I'd go first, but I imagine that fruit beer fans would really enjoy this one."
"After going up the brewwery over a month ago, i knew a rasberry beer was soon on its way, you could smell it everywhere. It is a very subdued rasberry flaovr which is a great thing. Not to fruity with no real aftertaste. Would make a great summer beer, however I think I still like the original UFO better with some lemon. It is definetly worth a try."
"D - very high, one of the best fruit beers i have ever had"
"Overall: This beer reminded me of Abita Purple Haze, it's been awhile since I've had Purple Haze so I can't express a preference. I'm not a huge fan of American Hefe Weizens. I tend to prefer the fruity and spicy flavors present in German Hefes. I think the raspberry adds some of what I feel is missing from the American style. As such I prefer UFO Raspberry over UFO."
"Drinkability-The drinkability is quite high. I saw this on the blackboard at the bar I was at tonight (Treydon's Eho MA) and me and my wife split the bottle not knowing what to expect. She loves it, definatly a summery brew. Picked up a 6er at the grocery store on the way home."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle a cloudy orange rust color that leaves a white head with a red tint that is frothy and bubbly. The aroma is heavy raspberry tart in nature almost synthetic. The taste is sweet, watery raspberry juice. It continues with a tartness that is combined with a somewhat heavy carbonated wheat feel on the palate. The finish is banana, nuts, almost a musty taste as well. Decent hefe, could be great with more ""real"" raspberry presence in the body."
"D- i liked this beer a lot. another great Harpoon beer. damn Massachusetts makes great beer! now i know some people say that ""it tastes like cough syrup"" well i say so what? are you expecting fresh fruit in a bottle of beer? i'm not! when i buy a fruit beer im not buying it and expecting to have to pick seeds out of my teeth. okay enough of my tangent. this beer was very tasty for anyone who likes raspberry."
"7/8's Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic, 1/8 Dogfish head Fort. A nice little drinkable fruit beer, but honestly it just seemed like UFO with some sugary fruit syrup tossed in."
"Pours faintly pink with no descernable head to block the coloring, but has an enourmous scent of fresh raspberries. Maintains its wheat-y characteristics and flavoring while adding an almost sweet fruity punch. The finish does not linger, but that's okay-you don't want it to. This is a very refreshing beer that I could see pounding down several of when it gets a little warmer."
"I can see myself drinking this beer again once the summer comes, but I cannot see myself having a very long seesion with the beer. Rather using it as a paring with certain foods, or having one just as a change of pace."
"Pours a two-fingered white head that quicky fades leaving traces of lace. Cloudy red/amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Raspberry nose. Starts non-descript but then the sweet raspberry flavor kicks in and leaves a lingering raspberry aftertaste. $1.25 for a 12 oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Nice drinkability level overall and a beer that will only become more desirable as summer and hot weather approaches. Something tells me this beer will be a success with the female beer drinking population. Worth checking out, I lucked out with such a fresh sample."
"D - Easy to drink. I can see this being a summer cookout beer or a easy choice at a party where the drink of choice is typically more mainstream."
"D- I certainly could not make a session out of this beer, but that is only because I am not into fruit beers. This will be around in my fridge through the spring and summer as an alternative, guest pleaser and to pair with food. I could easily see cooking with this in all sorts of way as well; salads, beer braised chicken quarters or even a lean medium rare pork loin."
