"As I enjoy blueberry muffins, syrup, buckle, etc, I also enjoyed this beer.  It's not for everyone, but tasty and fairly crisp."
""
"Not for everyone, but for those who really do not like the bitterness of most beers this is  great way to go.  Yes it is sweet.  Yes it does really taste like blueberries with a little beer in the background (compared to other blueberry ales that taste like 90% beer with a little blueberry put in just to say it is there).  For me that is much preferable to those ""fake blueberry ales"".   But it is very drinkable and is remarkably refreshing.  However be careful not to forget it is an 8% brew and if you down it like a soda or fruit drink, it will kick you.  Anheuser-Busch got it right."
"Kind of sweet and has a terrible color."
"I'm  a woman and I thought this fruity ""beer""  was gross. I had to pour it out. The potential buzz off the 8% couldn't convince me to choke it down.  I'm sad for this beer."
"Gives you a decent buzz due to alcohol content but has a bitter taste"
""
"If it's natural flavor .. why does it taste like a popsicle ?"
"At first, I recoiled at the initial shock of this swill hitting my taste buds. My palate, having not enough time to recover from this horror, proceeded to endure several agonizing seconds as I mustered up the courage to ingest such misery. And then came the aftertaste which I can only describe as tasting like how sadness feels. Wild Blue exists without my consent."
"Interesting, but doesn't taste like a beer. Had I not read the bottle, I would have thought it was a wine cooler."
"Wild blue. Don't try this again"
"A very solid beer for people who can't palate beer. Also, very dangerous because if you were like me you didn't realize it was 8% abv until after drinking 3 of them!"
""
"SO. This was in the premium section near all the locals and the Sierra Nevadas and etc. DID NOT realise it was AB Schwill. 8 percent, eh? So basically I'm figuring they brew some adjunct high gravity crap, then pour in some high fructose chemical blueberry shit, and WHAM there ya have it. Kinda misleading packaging and website. I expected a craft beer with some light fruit notes. I got gypped by macro garbage. GMO fructose headache, here I come!!!"
"Its kool-aid masquerading as beer. At best will give you cavities at worst will give you diabetes."
""
""
""
"So A-b makes this stuff but it's so bad they don't put there name anywhere on the bottle. Too sweet. I don't waste beer I drank them all and they'll get you pretty lit but this is some of the worst beer I've ever had"
"Tastes and smells great just a little strong"
"Want to get drunk real fast? Then drink this juice. It's not beer, it's a high ABV juice."
"Despite the hating here, this was tasty as heck. Pours _blue_ with a finger of _blue_ head, which both retains and laces. Aroma is blueberry. Taste is blueberry. Lack of booziness at 8% is fantastic and sweetness is nice. Girly or not, this stuff is fantastic."
"Pours purple-red with thin head and modest bubbles. Lots of blueberry aroma as you might expect with some tartness and malt notes. Tastes like fizzy kool-aid with a little spice. Too sweet."
"Smells extremely sweet with an off-putting blueberry scent (smells way too smeet) and alcohol. The main off putter for me was the texture of this thing. It almost tastes like syrup. Won't be seeking this out again."
"One of the best beers I have had."
"Pours a dark purple with a blue-ish hued head. The smell was very heavy with alcohol. The taste was not as bad as I was expecting, but still way too sweet with heavy alcohol burn. The texture was also far too syrupy for me. Not a fan."
"It's ok only good for a couple swigs though"
"Pours with a small, purple head. Looks just like grape juice. Has an aroma of blueberries, malts, and alcohol that combines to create a slightly unpleasant aroma. Initial taste is sweet from the blueberries, but aftertaste is bitter from the combination of malts and alcohol. Overall, a poor beer. But I have had worse."
"Very very bad. Had once a couple years ago. It really isn't good. Dark blue color is off-setting."
"Horrible fruit beer that would be ok as a shot but not in a 12oz serving.  Pleasant blueberry syrup that gets old very quick."
""
"It was overly sweet and tough to get through."
"A good beer for college students that want something sweet with a high alcohol content. For me it was a drain pour."
""
"Sweet and crisp, drank straight from the bottle. It was very blue/purple, and claims to have juice, which leads me to want it to be considered a shandy. I don't know if there is any beer rules that say it can't be a shandy, but it was too sweet for me to call a lager. Great beer to get drunk on, being 8% and tasting like lightly carbonated juice. No bitter flavors during or after conumption. Don't let the kids near it."
"This is pretty much a less flavorful version of grape soda. Not sure I would even classify this as a beer."
"Blue Berry Lager, very difficult to execute. This is so much better served over ice."
"I was offered a taste by my father and didn't think it was that bad. Not that good, though."
"Nice fruity aroma, with a somewhat more stolid outward appearance, the taste is decent, but not as profound as the initial flavor. Smooth."
"Dark blue color, sickly sweet taste. Its good when you just wanna get drunk and not drink beer."
"Why do I have to give it a review?"
"I can understand why some hard core purists would dislike this beer. It's sweet and does remind you of a grape soda. But I liked it. My wife LOVED it! At 8% it has a nice kick and I get to enjoy the taste of blueberries."
""
""
""
"First sip of this ""lager"" is nothing like what you probably expected when you ventured out to give this new concept of brew a try.  The taste from beginning to end is somewhat of a dull blueberry soda that has been overwhelmed by syrup.   The only reason I gave it a 2 star rating is because,for some reason, despite this taste description, it is bearable to drink as  a CARBONATED MALT BEVERAGE but completely unrelatable to beer and any classic lager brews."

"Cough syrup meets beer is the best way to describe this stuff. I was looking forward to trying this but after 3 swings I was done."
"Weighting: Appearance 15%, Smell 15%, Taste 35%, Mouthfeel 15%, Overall 20%"
"Wife bought me this. Awful too sweet/after taste will not buy again. I will stick to Busch light"

"It tastes like cough syrup, both on the palate and in the aftertaste. It's simply shocking. I've long clamored for a blueberry beer that is so intensely blueberry that it pours purple, and thought that this might be the answer to my prayers, but no. A higher-than-expected ABV (8%) gives it some *super* slight merit, but it can't save the beer overall. I'd recommend steering clear."

"This is my wife's favorite beer, and I make a great effort to never run out of of Wild Blue. One Wild Blue and my wife is ""Happy""!  And when she's happy, she is always in the mood to make me happy. Anyone who gives this brew a bad score does so because it is an unconventional beer flavor. It tastes like the Blue Berries it is made from. The flavor is so intense that I am not ashamed to admit that I enjoy this girly beer, but then, I love Blueberry pie!"
"Watered down grape juice..Watered down grape juice....Oh sorry, you were waiting for my review. If you are looking for some mild juice to go with your breakfast or something to quench the thirst real fast, this is it. Beer, I do not think so. Oh well..."
""
""
"Not horrible, but I wouldn't buy it again. If you need a blueberry fix, Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout will blow your mind."
""
"Why is Wild Blue no longer being distributed in Minneapolis, Minnesota? It's my all-time favorite and I can't find it anywhere anymore!"
""
"tastes like double crooked tree with a hint of blueberries. yum"

"This is not a 2.18 beer.  Even if you do not like sweet beers, it cannot be that bad.  The purple color is interesting and the fact that this is an 8 abv is impressive in and of itself.  Flavor is good.  If I can point to a flaw it might be the lack of head and carbonation."
""
"owned by them. Very sweet, so if you don't like a sweet kick in your ass don't buy it."
""
""
""
"Wild Blue is one of the better fruit-flavored beers that I've had and will get you where you're going--if you aren't going too far."
""
""
"You can really taste the blue berry in it. It is very fruity"
""
""
""
""
"Overall : This beer is kinda cool. Everything from the color to the flavor to the lay-you-on-your-ass ABV is pretty neat. It's worth a try, and not half as bad as some of these folks claim it to be. I have to laugh when they talk about German and American hops in the beer. Really? Where did they go? A ratio of 99% malt and 1 % hops doesn't really equate to much. There are no hops to be detected."

"12 oz bottle in a glass.  Pours purple like a grape soda, head and all.  Head and lacing are non-existent after a few seconds, though.  Surprised to see it was Anheuser-Busch that brewed such an experimental beer.  In my opinion, a true craft beer pushes the limit against tradition, and this blueberry ""lager"" seems to aspire to do that.  But the smell is more on the artificial grape side than natural blueberry.  Surprisingly, the taste is light, sugary, and juice-like even with 8% ABV.  Reminds me of those nasty fruit flavored MD 20/20 liquors they sell at the gas station.  Lots of carbonation, very sweet, fruity, and no hops.  Strange aftertaste.  There is definitely room for improvement, and this style is not for everyone.  Perhaps they should have put the blueberry flavor in the background and brought out more wheat and hops to the surface so that it actually tastes like a beer.  I won't buy another one."

"The people who don't like this beer generally just don't like sweet beers. This drink is delicious and tastes like a blueberry soda. Careful though, it's 8%, but you wouldn't know it by drinking it. I've had a lot of different beers, and this one is by far my favorite. Everyone has their go-to beer, and this one is mine. Unfortunately it's really expensive to drink every night, so you might wanna keep this one for some weekends or special occasions."

"O - pretty disgusting, not sure this is ""beer", there's no balance. It's overly sweet with artificial blueberry flavors mixed with alcohol"
""
""
""
""
"I guess I am the only person in the world that loves this beer. A friend of mine picked up a couple to try and I was instantly surprised by this beer. It is very sweet and smooth and refreshing. It tastes nothing like a pint of water that burnt wood chips have been steeping in like some beers, but also has the thick feel of a good craft stout. This beer to me is what a refreshing beer should taste like."

"O--Bought it on a whim at Wegmans in their $12 build your own six pack. I'm normally not a fruit beer kind of guy, but got a few since it's summertime and I thought it'd be a nice refreshing change. It was just overly sweet and not anything resembling a beer."

"This beer has a smooth blue berry flavor. It smells really good, it is not heavy it kind of has a malt taste. At least I think it does. It is a great beer for no matter what time of the year. It is a beer that I like to come home sit back and relax and enjoy after a long hard day at work. I definitely would recommend this beer to friends and family."

"yeah this is pretty bad, but its nowhere near as bad as it is rated on here. a deep royal blue hued purple drink with a stained purple short white head, great looks, more like a grape juice or red wine, but still, deep and inviting. the nose is a mix of cheap high gravity lager and blueberry puree. its like that blueberry syrup you get at dennys for your pancakes, sweet and sticky, but not super artificial. the flavor isn't that bad either, all blueberry on the front end, at the expense of being beer, which is okay, because the base beer is pretty brutal. i get some metal and some extract sweetness, corn sugar, nothing real pleasant from the base beer, and the finish is extremely boozy, but the combination of the alcohol and sugar really charges me up. i would never buy this, but i can see its appeal, and unlike the clamato stuff they do, this one doesn't make me cringe and hurl every time i even look at it."
"Not a big fan of Wild Blue. Way too sweet for me. If you like really sweet, fruity beers, then give it a try. If you don't like them, then spend your money on a better beer. Surprisingly, it is 8% ABV, but I would not have guessed it drinking it. Regardless, I won't be buying this one again."

"Looks like grape juice when poured. Especially when the head disappears. Sweet fruity smell (again, grape, I know it is supposed to be blueberry), but also some musty notes in there as well. Sweet berry favor. Blueberry flavor? Okay. I'll give you that. Some nuttyness in there as well. A Tart, astringent aftertaste. Tastes like an alcopop. If you want beer, this isn't it. A little thick and a bit sticky on the tongue, not bad (mouthfeel). Stupidly, I thought this was a Flying Dog creation. I thought, can't go wrong, it's Flying Dog. The label led me to believe so as it is very similar in style to the Flying Dog Beers. This to me is not a beer. I don't like this sort of beer anyway, and I think too many breweries are making fruit beers. I was all proud of myself for stepping away from the IPA's for this review. Guess what I'll be going back to next time?"
""
"Overall: Just didn't not enjoy the sweetness overload nor the blueberry component. Too much syrupy sweetness."
""
"Picked up a six of this one on my way to a quantity over quality night and the selection at the store I stopped at was very limited. Very interesting looking beer, dark in appearance with a light purplish head, I guess what you would expect from a blueberry beer. Smell is an interesting mix of blueberry and beer. Outstanding flavor, I enjoyed this beer very much, plus, it was very easy to drink which was surprising for an 8% beer, this gives it bonus points overall. And it was very reasonably priced. Not sure it is exactly a beer, more of a fruit cider, malt beverage, beer mix with blueberry juice, but I found it very tasty. Overall, not really a beer, but I enjoyed it and would buy again, just don't go into it looking for a beer."

"I'd say it's a poor beer, but it's alright if you go into it thinking it's a blueberry alcoholic beverage. Doesn't taste like anything you'd expect from a beer and doesn't have any characteristics I like from a lager. So if you want a fruity drink, it's not bad, but if you want a beer then look elsewhere."
"O: This drink doesn't taste much like a beer and seems to be more like a carbonated version of blueberry juice. While there's nothing overly interesting in the smell and taste, it does have good drinkability because the beer masks any traces of alcohol."
"overall. what the hell did i buy? i had no clue this was an A-B inbev brew. i don't know what to say here. its not beer, its not wine. its an 8%abv blueberry soda. i don't hate it, but i sure don't like it. i wont be getting this again, and don't offer me one cause i will say no! i have buyers remorse really bad right now."

"Wild Blue brewed by Anheuser-Busch with an abv of 8.0.This brew pours out a dark purple color like grape juice or blueberry juice. There is no head to this brew, pink at best. I am beginning to think this this not even brew. The taste is sweet and berry. I'm not saying that is a bad thing but it is not my kind brew. This brew goes down like smooth like juice. I'm impressed for it having an Abv of 8.0. This beer was different- a good pick for someone who likes blueberries .Overall I 'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5."
" 2.5 overall. I was disappointed to have bought a glorified Joose or Four Loko, etc. This would be good if you want to look classy while truly drinking ghetto juice. I will not buy this brew again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't like any one type of style and I've enjoyed a fruity beer from time to time. This is just nasty. I finished it, but barely. I imagine wine cooler enthusiasts would even take issue with this medicinal brew. The lone positive = 8% abv will help you forget what you just endured."
""

"O - The color and scent are appealing in this fruity novelty (gimmicky) beer. The taste is uneven in that the quality swings from fruity to malty and just really let's you know that there's too much sugar in here. For fans of blueberry beers they'll probably get a kick form this - you can buy it down the street from me a $3.99 a 6er - but there are definitely better bluebeeries out there."
"The low ratings don’t surprise me as this is a maligned style of beer on this site, but this is a very tasty drink. Has a dark purple color with a pinkish head, reminiscent of a blueberry. Smell and taste is sweet blueberry fruit. No hint of alcohol. Smooth and deceptively strong. Delicious."

"When taking the first sip of this beer it tastes like blueberry juice and you will think oh man for 8% this is pretty delicious, but the aftertaste is like someone spilled their lager into your cup of juice. Drinking more than one of these at a time made me sick because of how sweet it was. I cant safely say that its NOT my type of lager.. or that i even consider it a lager. Its worth a try though, some people enjoy that overly sweet taste. I consider it more of a sugary mixed drink, but that's just my opinion."
""
"It pours a very dark purple color with a head that is lighter purple. The head is short, and retention is poor. It smells like candy and fake fruit--nothing smells fresh about it at all. The taste is more of the same. If they came out with blueberry flavored cough syrup, this would be it. It tastes like soda. The mouthfeel is a mess, again, because this is essentially blueberry soda that only slightly resembles beer. Overall, this is by far the worst fruit beer I've had. I'll still with Sea Dog when I want a blueberry beer."

"O - cloyingly sweet, more like a wine cooler than a beer, not really drinkable, and I'm still confused as to why this needs to be 8%. Cut the ABV, cut the sweetness, and make it more balanced, and it might be a little better than it is."
""
""
""
""
""
"My suggestion is: Bring a six-pack of Wild Blue to a housewarming party. Bring it chilled, of course, because it is gag-taxing-unbearable at any temperature above ""cold""—like sharp-salty grapefruit and Dimetapp, and shoeshine. Your hosts will be delighted by its strange deficiencies. You'll have something to talk about."

"Loved this fruity beer since I first discovered it two years ago. It helped me remodel my house! Once ice cold, it's pure bliss on a hot summer day. I used to drink wine, but stopped due to acid and heartburn. I often see people disliking this type of beer - mainly people who drink stuff like Bud, Coors, etc., which makes sense. I don't drink grocery store beers, and love the rich, fruit flavor and 8% alcohol level, which gets me where i need to be on two beers, instead of eight, and keeps me from having a beer gut the size of Texas!"

"O: I don't even like blueberries and this was halfway decent. It's not beer, but it's a tasty, sweet and highly alcoholic (8% ABV) treat. Gotta give it some credit. I tried to give it middling scores. It's good at what it does, but it's a poor ""beer"" at the same time. Hard to score it at both ends so I shot for the middle."
"Overall – While massively sweet, the flavors are not all that off. It tastes kinda like a berry flavored wine cooler. If you want an alcoholic dessert in a liquid form then this is alright, but if don’t want anything very sweet, then you may want to stay away."

"At first taste, it was delicious. Tasted like a smooth blueberry drink with a heavy alcohol content... continue on to beer 2 and 3 and it began to taste more like Four Loko than a beer. Ended up finishing the 6 pack and feeling awful the next day. Beautiful reprieve is the 8 % ABV."

"I love this beer. The taste is almost wine smooth but with a lot of kick. I will be trying the Wild Red today. This is not a beer for people who like the Coors, Budweiser, Miller type beers. This is for people who love different flavors and tastes. I am not a national brand beer drinker. I actually love the different type of beers/ ales a lot more, more variety in tastes, smell and texture."

"Overall: I don't exactly hate it. I probably won't get it again, but I didn't feel the need to pour it out. It is what it is: sort of a novelty. Sweet, malty, and kind of odd but at 8% ABV I'll drink it."

"Back in the day, when I was 18 and lived in the dorm, we used to drink a cheap wine called Bali Hai. Well, Wild Blue reminds me of Bali Hai or Boone's Farm. Except Blue here has a major kick to it and it's not a good kick! Unsophisticated sweet, syrup like consistency. I can't say anything good about this beverage. If I was underage and I wanted a buzz and had not developed a taste for beer or wine, this would be it. Really, this is just one bad excuse of a ""lager"". The alcohol does not mesh. It's almost like it was fortified with alcohol. The alcohol should complement the beer and be part of the taste experience. I have 5 1/2 bottles of this stuff left and don't know what to do with it. If this was Blue Moon, I could use it to bake an orange chicken. But, I don't want a blueberry blue/purple colored chicken. My wife says it reminds her of a cheap cosmo. I'm going to try it as a blueberry beer float with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it for dessert. If that doesn't work, down the drain. I would not serve this to a guest and I sure as heck won't drink it. Thinking back, this is very similar to Malt Duck and I hated Malt Duck. This stuff is worse than Hop n Gator."

"O - Not a great beer at all! Avoid by all means. How is this even being marketed on the shelves as beer is beyond me. The Brothers rating is definitely right on the spot on this one ---may even be a little too generous. This is actually an insult to the craft of beer. It's not even fit to serve at a prison! This beer has over 250 calories and is so not worth the cost or the health impacts. The alcohol content is also very high --almost 8%. If you like getting buzzed of cough syrup or you're an advocate of sugary wine coolers/kool-aid/grape soda combos then this is definitely the beer for you. If you're a true beer advocate, you should avoid this beer by all means. There are just too many other great beers out there to try. Move on!"

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Pint glass showed a juice like beverage with little head to speak of, what was there was reddish purple. The smell started out like blueberry pie but went south fast and settled as stale juice box with some chemical notes. The taste was a real surprise as it tasted pretty good for what it is, I don't care for blueberries in the first place but I wanted to keep a open mind. The berry flavor was just enough but not over the top, on the down side not much Lager came through and that results in a 8% ABV adult juice drink....still have to try the Raspberry sister beer...and I do like Raspberries...I like a little more beer with my beer but I'm glad I tried it."
"This blueberry beer is the best I have tasted. With it's full body and aroma it is pleasantly palatable. It is slightly sweet but not too sweet, and looks and tastes of delectable blueberries. The only downside is the calories. At about 260 per bottle I tend to limit myself to 1 or 2. Perhaps that can be a good thing!"

"This is genuinely, remarkably bad. I haven't had anything this bad in at least a month. I sometimes feel the urge to seek out beers with terrible reputations. I almost feel as if it helps reset my palate, giving me some perspective. And this beer certainly fits that category. I'm temped to drainpour the rest of this, as I kind of feel like vomiting, but I guess I need to practice some self-discipline."
""
""
""
"My initial, gentle pour still created two fingers of fizzing, deep-lavender head with mediocre retention. If Wild Red was a purplish-red, then this is a reddish-purple in color with NE-quality clarity. How can it be so bright and still have the possibility of sediment? Nose smelled like blueberry pie, which is to say, blueberry-like and quite sweet. I once really loved blueberry pie, but now I find it too sweet for my taste, so I am not holding out a lot of hope for this beer. Mouthfeel was thin and watery and the taste was unnaturally sweet. I begin to question how much actual fruit goes into these types of beers and how much of it is simply chemically manufactured esters. Finish was candy sweet and although it was not horrible, it was not something that I would want to drink more than one of them. Hell, I may have trouble finishing one without going into diabetic shock ..."
""
""

"Overall: I've only had the Sea Dog variety of fruit beers, and wanted to try others just for kicks. This one is A LOT different than those, but that doesn't make it bad. I'm just not sure I'll revisit this one when it's time to duplicate. I was hoping for a bit more, I guess it's the lack of beer qualities that bums me out."

"So I had this beer and thought it tasted more like a blueberry mix drink than beer. It has some serious alcohol, so that's pretty sweet, but this wouldn;t be a goto beer for me. Blueberry aroma and flavor is pretty intense. I think people dog this because it's an AB product, but compared to some other fruit beers I've tried, this one stands out. I will probably buy a six pack or two every summer to share with guests."

"O – This really should not be considered a beer. I guess the way that it is made technically makes it so, but you’d be hard-pressed to find many beer characteristics here. I’ve docked some good fruit beers for lacking base beer characteristics in the past. Not only does this one lack any base beer characteristics but it also does not smell, taste, or feel good. I wonder how the other offerings in this “wild” series are, but I don’t think I’m curious enough to try them. Stick to the usual adjunct lagers, AB InBev. At least those are somewhat drinkable."

"I don't normally care for alcohol in general but when I tried the Wild Blue Blueberry lager/ale I was pretty impressed with it. I will definitely buy it again and recommend it to others as well. I drank it straight from the bottle so can't really give much on the appearance but everything else was excellent in my opinion."

"This beer deserves ratings above a 5. Unfortunately, they only give you 12 ounces of greatness at a time, which just makes me upset. Until they make this beer in gallon jugs complete with a needle for direct IV injection, I'll have to give the same rating I'd give a fizzy, cheap wine cooler."

"This says blueberry lager on the label on the front but on the back says its an ale, so which is it? To me it tastes like it doesn't have hops therefore making it neither and a malt liquor. This product barely resembles beer. It was so sweet I looked up the calorie content only to find it 260 calories per 12 oz. I wonder how many grams of sugar. Def not worth picking this up unless your 16 years old and drinking for the first time."
"O: Not the easiest beer to drink, with the kool-aid like flavors and the not so well hidden alcohol I'm not sure I would enjoy another of these (ever). There is also something very artificial about this beer even though it claims to have natural blueberry flavoring."
""
""
""
"Off I go into the Wild Blue... This stuff pours a clear cranberry sauce topped by a short-lived finger of light magenta foam. The nose comprises sweet blueberry (surprisingly not all that artificial) and some light cranberry sauce (strange theme...). The taste reprises the blueberry, but not it's sweeter and decidedly more artificial, like ancient sno-cone syrup or something like that. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an oily feel. Overall, a pretty sad fruit beer, probably the worst of the Wild bunch AB puts out."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - Avoid, avoid, avoid. This stuff was terrible. Drain pour material."
""
"Overall, is a very overpowering sweet blueberry taste, not the best fruit lager."
""
""
"Considering I don't care for blueberry, this beer actually wasn't that bad and with the decent abv...was almost worth drinking. Ok, not so much, however, I could stomach it even though it tasted like rich cough syrup and reminded me of being a kid taking dimeatap (sp). Would I recommend it, hell no, but if you are on the FB 100 beer list challenge, you don't have a choice...."
"Nothing about this beer was at all compelling. The taste was completely over-the-top fruit. Not sure if it was actually blueberry, but it was definitely fruity. Almost sickeningly sweet. The only reason I'd ever buy this again is to mix with Guiness to make a Black and Blue..."
""
""
"This beer goes well with Fats Domino music."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the whole I would say this is a very drinkable and effective brew for someone who shies away from the higher IBU beers like IPAs. As long as you realize that this is a beer which tastes more like a fruit-soda than a craft-beer you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
"Overall - don't really like fruit beers, this isn't a terrible offering. I think it gets low ratings just because its Busch."

"C'mon guys its a blueberry beer. Is it supposed to look good, no. Is it supposed to taste like a belgium or an ipa, no. Its on par with a bud light margarita. If you feel like drinking something a little different, this will fit the bill. If you're looking for that once in a lifetime beer experience, this will not do it for you. For me, today, I'm enjoying the sweet difference that is a cheap blueberry beer."
""
""
""
"Overall this borders on a drain pour as it was not balanced or enjoyable and way too sweet to drink more than one. Basically it was like a cross between a Mad Dog 20/20 and a Grape Nehi and nothing like craft beer. Calling this a ""Premium Blueberry Lager"" is great marketing, but total BS."
""
""

"I was most disappointed by the price. It had the same price as many good beers that I like, I was foolish for not coming to beer advocate first on this one."

"I don't really have anything else to say; the moderator should keep in mind that the first rule of writing is that one should never use two words when one will suffice."
"Overall, this may be the worst fruit beer on the planet, period. This beer is beyond cloying and I don't think there's any way I could finish a bottle of this."
""
"Overall - Well, I picked this one up out of curiosity.. it's really bad. Don't bother buying this one."
""
"M: Again, essentially the consistency of juice. No real depth to the feel at all. It allows for quick drinking (if you're into that)."

"You know I don't hate this as much as others. There are issues, but the stuff I like makes it okay. Dangerous on the easy drinking and 8% abv"

"From what I can tell – Inbev created a fictitious brewery in New York in order to justify the false advertising on the label of this beer. With that said, please learn from my mistake - do plenty of research before just randomly selecting a beer from the shelves of your bottle shop when feeling adventurous. This was a classic case of false advertising."

"I wouldn't call this beer, but I don't dislike it. I like it for what it is - whatever it is - as long as it's not beer."
"Overall - Everything about this beer is wrong! Instead of selling this as a beer, they should repackage it as a cheap Four Loko-esqe drink. Come to think of it, I prefer a Four Loko over this. Avoid this at all costs, and drink real beer instead of this!"
""

"I think there is a lot of hate on this beer because it's from AB, but for what it is it's not bad. Sweet, sugary soda-pop beer, yeah, but I enjoyed it. It's not BEER beer but it's not trying to be.

"It's not really a beer. With that in mind, it's actually pretty alright. It's definitely an alternative for people who don't like ""beery"" flavors. For what it's worth, I was quite surprised that it's fairly enjoyable - As long as you realize that it has nothing to do with beer other than the name. Personally, I wouldn't buy it. But I can see how others might enjoy it."

"Having not drank many fruit beers, I don't have much to judge this beer on other than what others have said or the fact that A-B makes it. But its pretty darn good! Remove the fact that it says beer and pretend its an alcoholic concoction of some sorts and it is very tasty. It has no hop aroma or bitterness, very little head or lacing so just throw an ice cube or two in it and just enjoy a sweet fruit drink."
""
""

"I was actually afraid to try this beer after reading so many bad reviews of it. I imagined it as ""thick"" and ""syrupy"". Descriptions made it sound horrible. I finally read a quote of someone saying it was like ""between a beer and a wine"". That intrigued me because I love wine. I love blueberries. I ignored the bad reviews and took the plunge. I LOVE this beer! It is different! It does have a sweetnesss to it, but it is not the thick syrupy taste, just a light sweet flavor. It does remind me of a wine more than a beer. The flavor is pleasing, light, with a fruitiness that tastes good. Unlike most beers, it has a pretty color of what you would expect from a blueberry beverage, a definite purple. It has a two finger head that does dissipate. Although I resisted even sampling this beer, it has become my favorite! I am wondering since it actually is made from blueberry juice, if any of the healthy anthocyanins remain in the beer? If so, it would be a health beverage as well as just an enjoyable one."

"So, yes, I poured it down my sink. I came back in the kitchen later & the smell was still seeping up and contaminating my home. If the thought of drinking Draino mixed with Kool-Aid and blue syrup makes you ill, then do stay clear of Wild Blue."

"O: not good at all. Too boozy. Too sweet. Sickeningly cloying sweet with odd pronounced bitterness at the end. Gross. Couldn't drink another. Ever."
""
""
""
"This is a great summer drink, not convinced if you can call it a beer though. This beer has a color like no other, the dark purple almost makes it look more like juice. There is so much blueberry taste to this beer, it tastes more like a mixed drink than a beer. On a hot Saturday fishing or golfing this is definitely the six pack i'm bringing. For about $7 a six pack it has great flavor and at 8% abv you might regret it in the morning."

"Overall - After a little while of drinking on it, it's starting to make me feel sick. Only drink this if you're into strong, fruity drinks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: This is so gross. Super syrupy mouthfeel with huge grape cough syrup and artificial blueberry notes. The finish brings hints of grain, stale bread and already been chewed blueberry scones. Leaves a nasty sour taste in the mouth after swallowed. This is easily the worst I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"That being said it doesn't taste too bad if you like fruity things. High ABV is barely noticeable and it's not overly sweet (very sweet, but not sickeningly so). People who like the super fruity lambics might actually enjoy this, though I doubt they would admit it."
""
""
"It's thick and concocted. It's a paste. Like a pharmaceutical suspension--or a natural fruit drink--perhaps it should say ""Shake well before using."" I had a buddy of mine tell me he likes to drink this beer. Buddy says he likes to do so in the shower. I may not hang out with this buddy anymore...."

"O- The worst beer I have had, four sips and a drain pour. I tried to drink this with an open mind and ignore the low rating, but the first sip was too offensive. This really isn't beer and helped me realize why I spend my money on a high quality craft beer. When I want a fruit beer I will get Lambics and Berliner Weissbiers."

"Seriously, take the juice from a can of blue berries, make pruno out of it and mix with 7-Up. Congratulations, you have now made Wild Blue Lager."
"I was shocked at the bad reviews this beer received. It has great malt and hops flavors with a really pure blueberry flavor. I thought that this was a very well made beer."
"Cheeers!!!"
"Unpleasant. This seems to be for winos but I fear the price tag would preclude them."
"As for it being a macro (AB) brew - kudos to them for actually trying something new and different!"
"Looks like soda. Tastes like soda. It's alcoholic blueberry soda, not beer."
"I really like this fruity brew. It is very easy to drink and at 8% it won't be long before you notice its there. When poured into glass kinda of a shock it is purple in color like grape juice kinda like red wine. Its smell was of very noticable grain notes with blueberry the taste was great with a very light body mouthfeel this is an easy drinking tasty brew!"
"O/D - Like a cocktail or a cooler. Nothing I want here. Not exactly beer-like, but not necessarily a good drink. I wouldn't seek this out for anyone."
"Strange purplish liquid with a bubblegum pink non lasting head. Smell and taste are distinctly blueberry juice added to a very watered down cheap beer. Much closer to soda pop! Overall, if you REALLY love blueberry, you might like it. Watch out though, its a relatively high ABV!"
"Ill pass, and I am a girl. Just No."
"Dreadful, oversweet, cough-syrup-like taste. Got about 1/3 down, and asked the waitress to take it away. She wasn't a bit surprised."
"Smelled the bottle, huh... kool aid and grape juice. At 8% it's low grade krunk juice more specifically. Took a couple swigs to get acclimated, and first impressions are that it's basically a grape juice wine cooler with some artificial blueberry flavoring added. Heavy and sweet aftertaste like cheap wine, perceptible alcohol. Syrupy slick feel that coats the palate, and demands a chaser or sandpaper to scrape it off my burdened tongue. Gross. This is more a wine cooler/alcopop than anything resembling beer at all. Just not something i'd ever drink again. Poorly made and worse than bad malt liquor to be honest. Even Four Loko doesn't taste this bad."
"This is not a drinkable beer. I am curious about the target audience for a brew like this. I am more likely to pour one over pancakes that to drink one again."
"Overall: The positives- it's 8% abv. The negatives- everything else."
"This is the WORST beer I have ever had. It has no balance, nearly impossible to even review. In all-time epic failures, this goes hand-in-hand with the Hindenberg. It amazes me that someone allowed this to leave the sewage plant that produces this swill."
"The taste is like a dry HIGHLY carbonated blueberry juice. That high carbonation is unpleasant for some reason. The finish has more of a cough syrup taste. Way too much cough syrup on the finish. It ruins anything that could have been positive about this beer, which wasn't much to start with."
"Pours a deep purple with 1/2"" of purple-red head with little retention. Smells of blueberry but more like juice or wine; very sweet nose. This tastes more like blueberry wine or blueberry Juicy Juice than beer. The blueberry flavor is intense, overpowering, and extremely sweet. Mouthfeel is light; well carbonated."
"Wild Blue is a red wine colored drink, with a small pink head on top. Pretty good amount of lacing. The scent is also reminiscent of red wine, I guess if you keep at it you'll notice its more of a blueberry than a wine scent, but its pretty similar. The taste is like any sugary fruit drink you'll find in the grocery store, but with a noticeable alcohol flavor as well. Blueberry fruit juice dumped into a lager, that's pretty much the scoop on this one."
"Don't even bother. I didn't realize Anheuser made this beer until after it was all dumped."
"Overall Drinkability - If you like your cough syrup in a glass bottle, this is the way to go."
"D - Quite drinkable, if you like Welch's or Kool-aide."
"Dr: Like a bad gatorade flavour mixed with blueberry fun dip. In Slovenian, the word for this is ""fucking shite"". High ABV, especially for the brewery (if we can call it that), and of poor quality and even availabilty. The deceptive marketing just pisses off consumers. Ignore this one."
"Overall, this beer lives up to the hype. I never thought I would get a shot at this rarity, so big shout out to the douchebags that brought this to one of my friend's parties and forgot one in the fridge, thanks guys."
"THis is certainly a sweet candy brew and I would put it much closer to a malternative than a fruit beer, but I dont find it disgusting or offensive for what it is. I dont get any chemically or pungent flaws but wont be buying this again. Try it as a gimmick I guess but dont expect and grainy or malty character to balance the sweet candy fruit flavor and character."
"Poured a dark berry blue with fizzy, purple head that dissipated to nothing before I could toss my cap in the garbage. Smells like a berry Kool-Aid and nothing like beer. Granted, fruit beer doesn’t smell like traditional beer, but this doesn’t even smell real. Light body with a trace of alcohol. It's like drinking a lighter UV Vodka. I drank one the other night with some friends simply for the 8% alcohol, but I think the rest of this one is going down a drain."
"D: Well this is different from the other Blueberry beers I've had.... This one went more blueberry than beer... Hell I don't think you can call this beer.... Really, this is more wine like than any fruit beer I've had. I will not be back."
"Ultimately, all I can say is that I'm glad I like beer. If this is the swill non-beer drinkers turn to, I actually kind of feel sorry for them. If this were marketed as a flavored malt beverage, I'd probably be a bit less harsh, but the fact that AB tries to market this along the lines of a micro-brew is insulting at best. There are good examples of fruit beer out there (Abita Purple Haze comes to mind, a personal favorite), but this surely isn't it. If you like real beer, I would advise you to steer clear, but in the event you like the idea of a brew that comes across like a blueberry soda, well, you might give it a try (with a healthy helping of my pity)."
"Pours an absolutely deep, brownish-purple. Looks like a glass of carbonated grape juice. A nice, lite-purple head sticks around. For its eccentricity, this beer scores well in the visual dept. Then things tend to go south.. Something odd on the smell, like a musty room in the basement. And some blueberries, of course. Kind of like if Grandma put some fruit in the cellar and left it to rot. Then the taste, where things get almost repulsive. A wine-cooler kick to the throat, with scads of boo-berries - excuse me, blueberries - explode like a Hostess fruit pie. Way too artificial for any sincerity. Finish is downright boozy, hot, and too much in general. There is no reason for this beer to be 8%, or exist really. I don't know what this is? Except bad. Drainpour, only the third one ever for me.."
"Overall - Not very impressed. I'm sampling 1/2 a beer and gave wife the other half. Rather have a purple passion or tropical mixed drink than this pseudo beer. Still isn't quite a drainpour but not very refreshing either."
"Poured into a glass with a small head that disappeared almost immediately. Smells like Juicy Juice, has a reddish/purple coloring. Tastes like carbonated grape or blueberry juice with alcohol dumped in. To be honest, i only drank about 1/4 of the glass and couldn't transition to another beer because it made my mouth taste awful."
"Ok so this isn't an infused fruit beer like a Raison D'être. Not even close. It looked kind of cool in a glass, a deep purple red. Barely any head, no lacing. The taste was one step up from one of those Joose things. It was too sweet, too fake blueberry flavor, just too much. The only reason I bought this stuff was because I didn't look carefully and thought I was getting something from Flying Dog. Shame on me."
"I'll be looking to give the rest of this hooch away."
"I like this beer, it's sweet and fruity and fun! Consider it a dessert beer or with fruit and cheese. It has a strong blueberry taste and a heavy feel. The 8% alcohol content gives you a nice fuzzy feeling all over! This is a good alternative to have on hand for the wine drinkers at your next beer bash."
"This beer does not look, smell, or taste like beer. It is an alcoholic version of Welch's grape soda. If I've ever had a worse beer, I can't remember when. Actually, I hesitate to refer to it as a beer, because it bears no resemblance to real beer. I salute those of you who can stomach this crap, but I would way that if this stuff appeals to you, then you are probably not truly a fan of beer."
"I'm give it a C because I'm on the fence with this beer. I won't buy it but I still take samples of it at festivals and such. This beer pours out as a blue-ish purple color. Looks like a kids juice or something. The smell of the beer is fruity and sweet, more like a wine cooler or something. The taste of the beer is super sweet, it's actually much better if it's blended with a Shock Top. The guy giving out samples at last years Allentown Brew Works Beer Fest got creative and was making beer cocktails those two beers. Anyway, the mouthfeel is pretty smooth and it almost medium bodied. Overall this beer I feel is too sweet on it's own to drink more than one. I won't buy it, but it's worth trying."
"i might consider getting this beer again for someone who doesnt like beer but is into fruit juice."
"Looks like grape juice tastes like fruit drink not like beer at all, is more simalir to a carbonated fruit wine so if you hate beer and love wine you might like this one the only good thing about this beer is that its 8% so if you can stomach it you can do some damage...overall not reccommeded beer"
"O - Really a bad ""beer"". My wife enjoyed it but she isn't a beer drinker. I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it to anyone. Maybe it would be good to drink if you don't want a real beer and can stomach fake fruit smells/tastes?"
"Poured a murky medium cranberry with an average sized pink frothy head that dissapated after a few minutes and had fair lacing. The aroma right away hits you with the sweet scent of blueberry’s with a mild bread malt and a sweet yeast. It tasted mildly sweet and just a tad sour with a strong blueberry presence from start to finish with the flavor lasting quite a long time. I did notice a warming sensation from the alcohol about 30 seconds after the swallow, but did not taste it at all. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and a little syrupy in texture with a lively carbonation. Overall a very sweet fruit beer and rather refreshing."
"O - Bad. Really bad. Try it just to make me feel better please. Share the pain."
"I will never have this ""beer"" again. Sorry BA but I cannot comment on the qualities of this beverage as its beer component is washed out with whatever welfare ""blue drink"" syrup Annheiser-Busch used to make it. Womp womp wooomp!"
"It a great beer to start out the night or at least to try but I probably wouldn't recommend it - unless you’re a huge fan of kool-aid. I need extra words so I decided to add this sentence:)"
"Summary: Shame on you, Anheuser-Busch. Fellow beer drinkers, avoid this one like the plague. It is sickeningly sweet, and probably the worst beer I have had thus far in my life (mind you, I'm not quite 30 yet...so maybe there is something worse, but I kinda doubt it). The only reason I could justify buying more of this beer would be if I wanted to get myself of my girlfriend wasted on something with high ABV that didn't taste strongly of alcohol. Even then, there are far better choices. Honestly, I'd rather buy Cisco wine or Thunderbird. They taste just as bad, but have twice the ABV, so at least I wouldn't have to stomach quite as much foul-tasting swill."
"The beer pours a reddish-purple with a pink head. The aroma is heavy on the blueberries and cherries. The only notes I get in the aroma are fruit, no malt or hops are present. The flavor is more of the same. There is a ton of blueberry and some alcohol in the flavor. You can tell it is 8 percent. Overall the beer tastes a bit medicinal and quite a bit like blueberry cough syrup. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Eh. at least its 8% and cheap? - ok had to edit this to say that after I got to halfway I wanted to stop. This gets gross. Wouldn't buy again."
"Poured a dark dark reddish color. That surprised me. Light pink head on it. Smells like blueberry, no surprise there. Also some alcohol smell thrown in. Taste is not too good. Tastes like communion wine to me. Light-medium body. I probabl won't go for this again."
"Oh man. Pours with a fizzy very short live purple head. Color is a clear, reddish, purple, deep garnet - sort of. Aroma is imitation blueberry and beer in the background; kind of weird. Flavor is soda pop fake blueberry with alcohol warming. Body is ok, but carbonation is very aggressive. Finish is like flavor. Can't imagine drinking more than the first few sips of this. Drain might spit it back at me."
"Overall this stuff is pure weirdness and I am proud of myself for being able to handle the whole sixer. Never could see myself getting this again as it tastes more like a wine cooler than a beer."
"That said, it's not terrible. Just don't expect it to taste like beer."
"I am not really a fruit beer kinda guy but every now and again I like to try something a little bit different and was at a friends place playing cards and he had this to offer... Was impressed by the beer just out of a bottle since he didn't want to provide a glass and since my wife likes fruity beer I picked up a 6-pack... Poured into standard pint glass and tickled by the deep purple and the heavy berry aroma... had a light purple head that was very fizzy and didn't last a long while... I really enjoy the taste of this when I am looking for something ""light"" to drink and just need a break from the norm (IPA, Old Ale, Belgians/Trappists) and the blueberry really comes out in this... Mouthfeel was really nothing to call home about and I found that the drinkability was pretty good but really have to drink in moderation, not just because it is 8% but also I think too much will make you sick because it is pretty sweet..."
"Drinkability: Far too sugary and syrupy, causing this beer to completely deteriorate on me after the first few sips. Not something I would reach for again if I had the choice."
"Pours a clean purple-ish/ amber color with a small pale pink-ish head. In the aroma, fruity blueberry and a small dry malt. In the taste, sweet, somewhat like blueberry syrup, but with lager like notes.A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry blueberry syrup aftertaste. Kind of like a ounce of blueberry syrup and 10 ounces of a lager poured on top."
"Since I love challenges, I am going to try to say something positive about this beer. I like that ABusch is trying new things to capture the craft market and that this beer did not suffer from the usual trap (It suffered from other things.) of watery mouthfeel. I think the idea of a sweet Blueberry beer isn't too bad but the execution needs to be better."
"Pours purple with a finger of foam that quickly dissipates. The aroma of blueberry breakfast syrup is highly literal; there's not really anything smell-wise to indicate this is a beer. The flavors are similarly too literal: it's as if blueberry pancakes and blueberry syrup were put through a blender. It's interesting for the first couple of sips but is ultimately just a palate-wearying syrup-bomb."
"This beverage IS artifical flavoring, and the taste could not be worse & drinkability is very poor. IMO only comparable to a bad wine cooler."
"The only positive I can find with this thing is the high alcohol percentage. But I highly suggest, stay away from this!"
"Drinkability: Never again. No sir. Not fun, pleasing, or even remotely decent. I will avoid this at all costs. Now I know why malt liquor gets such a bad rep."
"Don't bother. Stay away."
"This is Juice. Fermented Juice. What do they call that stuff? Oh yeah... Wine. I'm not sure if there is any malted barley of any sort involved here. That said, I do think it tastes 'OK' and managed to drink all six of them. If you're looking for a syrupy-sweet, blueberry-flavoured wine-cooler/spritzer type beverage for your non-beer drinking friends, this would be a good choice (Oh, also, 8% abv!) I feel bad about reviewing this so poorly, as I always like when boundaries have been pushed, but this goes a bit too far beyond my preconceptions of what a 'beer' should be for me to really respect it."
"D - Well, atleast you cant taste the 8%. That being said, this beer is horrible, just horrible. This is almost an abomanation of a beer. Will never drink this again."
"My advice to AB...forget this stuff and the tomato-clam beer and ramp up your flagship brew. Your time and money would be better spent and may pay much bigger dividends. Why waste your time on these swill drinks when a semi-decent, average tasting beer would gain you the respect and likely some of the dollars of those who now run to craft brewers for something good to drink? My advice...FWIW."
"Updated June 2012; since drinkability is no longer a rating category, I feel obligated to bump this one down to straight 1's (from a 1.5 in drinkability/overall). While I have had a marginally worse beer, I can't in good conscience give this beverage anything more than a 1/5 overall."
"This beer reminded me of Hi-C fruit punch with a slight kick of alcohol. Not what I would consider a beer at all. It's very sweet and hard to finish. It has a sweet syrupy taste to it that's just plain terrible. If you're thirsty for something this sweet drink a wine cooler."
"The ""beer"" pours a dark cheap wine color and smells like one too. Has about the same amount of head as wild irish rose. Tastes like a mix between cheap wine and a juice box. It doesn't have an overwhelming alcohol taste as you would expect for 8 percent. It has a bitter after taste almost like eating pancakes with the blueberry syrup."
" Overall an awful beer, I hate bashing a beer but I just had to write the review becaue I was very dissapointed in this ."
"D- This stuff is way too sweet for me. I'm not a fan of this beer at all. AB makes some pretty gross flavored beers and this one is right up there with them. It reminds me of bum wine more than anything else."
"The taste was pretty much exactly what I expected, besides the suggestion that regardless of whether or not the blueberry flavor was slightly syrupy, it held a more ""fresh blueberry"" tartness than a ""from concentrate"" thickness. There was a definite lack of high fructose corn syrup, which I liked - though I doubt I'll ever really know if they use real blueberries like they say they do. Nestled up close to the blueberries were some cranberries and raspberries as well, but they tasted like they'd been cooked down to the bare minimum of flavors. There may have also been a few dark grapes and a very faint maltiness that lingered way underneath, but my tongue was so over-burdened with blueberries that it was hard to find anything else, much like the nose. So, obviously with all of that fruit, it was very sweet and it also managed to keep the carbonation going for most of the beer, despite the bubbles being like tiny champagne bubbles - which made the whole drink reminiscent of a fruit cider. Also, it had a very thin mouthfeel and a rather dry, crisp ending even with all of the big juicy fruit flavors, and tasted something like a slightly carbonated juice beverage that was on its way to going flat. It carried no aftertaste and in the end, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. A fruit beer like this just isn't my style, it's too sweet with not enough sour, and I'm beginning to think that even though I tried not to be a snob about it being a product from Anheuser-Busch, the knowledge (unfortunately) definitely tainted my experience."
"Don't really have too much to say about this beer except that it doesn't tickle my fancy. I didn't even feel like I was drinking beer. Normally, I love blueberry flavor but I felt like I was drinking a sparkling blueberry wine. Not a huge fan. Might just not be for my palate."
"maybe a wine drinker might like this...maybe you may like this. I didn't. I did finish the 6 pack...hell, I paid for it-not gonna waste it! At least the 8% ABV made me not care about the taste after a few! Cheers!"
"Do not buy, don't even try. Not worth it."
"Was not like beer at all, more like red wine or grape juice, in color, consistency and taste. Had less than half the bottle. Had guests try it, no one liked it. Five bottles left, too late for stocking stuffers."
"Kind of shocked to see all the negative reviews for this beer, but it is probably more like a sweet glass of wine. Has an ALC. content of 8% so you got to love that :)"
"Verdict: In a nutshell, this stands out as one of the most interesting bottled ""beers"" that I have ever consumed, but honestly, I liked it even less the second time around. So here's what I say about this; If you appreciate zero hoppy bitterness, low malty sweets and a super sweet, fruity, carbonated beverage without any alcohol barriers, then you might appreciate this. It tasted to me like a wine cooler or a mixed beverage. If you're looking for characteristics of your average, run-of-the-mill beer, this might be the single grossest thing you ever tried. It's worth a shot to most people, especially if you can find a single bottle, try it. I'm on the fence about what it is, but it wasn't very good as a beer. It's a blueberry punch in the face. I wouldn't get it again. D (2.15)"
"Drinkability- It's drinkability isn't bad, though it's called a beer. Since it is called a beer you should definitely avoid because it's so far from what beer should be. I gave the rest away to someone I didn't like."
"Conclusion: This is a special formulation for sorority girls that don't like beer because it isn't sweet enough so that they can drink half the liquid and get just as drunk. I can't find any real problems with it however, because this is a style that is wide open for different interpretation."
"Drinkability- This does go down pretty smoothly for a 8%. But that doesnt make me want to drink it again."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation. Just too sweet, and not well made. I will not seek this out again."
"ok price 6 for 8 bones."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Oh lord this is a cloying sticky sweet mess. The combination of the alcohol mouth and the scrubbing action of the over carbonation is bad. Perhaps not the worst tasting beer ever but definately not enjoyable."
"An one finger light blue head; not quite the right color for beer. Head heads south leaving a small ring of lace which slides down the glass. Color is a dark brown purple, which comes closes to a 28 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells like blueberries and malt. Tastes....well, blueberries, malt, and a weird over taste of mint leaves. Nothing much happening as I move it around my mouth. A sweet sickening flavor that annoys the more you drink. Much more like bad wine than beer. One was more than I need to sample."
"Thick and syrupy. I can't handle more than one."
"D = The only reason I didn't take a dump on this beer is that when it came down to it, I really didn't mind the taste. BUT then I remembered I was supposed to be drinking a lager and I would become disappointed all over again."
"This is a highly drinkable beverage in my eyes. It does go down very quickly. I found the high alcohol volume a little surreptious and is something to be wary of...The flavor is easily the best selling point, but the 8.0% abv in this beverage does pack a kick."
"D: One word: diabeetus. This beer is beyond cloying and I don't think there's any way I could finish a bottle of this."
"Avoid this at all costs, it's pretty miserable."
"Pours a purple-rose tint, one finger purple head. Nose of grape soda with mild hoppiness in the background. Taste is grape soda with mild hops at the finish along with a faint breadiness lingering. Super overwhelming carbonation level with a medium body. A bit cloying after a short while."
"Kind of drinkable, worlds better than most of their other beer."
"Pours a clearly artificial bluish purple without much head or lacing. Smell is fake blueberries, like a bad candle. Taste doesn't really improve things much--they actually get worse. Like the worst blueberry candy I could imagine in liquid form. Feel is like and grossly fruity. Very bad. Very, very bad."
"This is a new category for beer and I think it is very good and Drinkable. Obvious not something I expected from AB but they do surprise you all the time. A lot of reviews on this beer are more anti AB then they are true reviews of the beer. So I am disappointed that the self proclaimed ""beer gurus"" cannot give a neutral beer review. If this was made by New Belgium it would be the greatest beer ever made. YOu know who you are the ones that feel insulted right now as you read this. Great job AB you did it again."
"In any case, it is a truly unique (bizarre) beverage, that I can't imagine anyone would enjoy. The cheapest wine cooler is succulent compared to this, but maybe the 8% ABV does it for some people."
"The beer is purple in color. There is nothing lager about it. It is sour blueberry juice with grain alcohol. Disgusting. Avoid."
"D: Was not inclined to have another but was very impressed with knowledge of Anheuser-Busch, Inc. They can make a beer with taste even if its a non conventional one."
"Avoid this thing."
"Drinkability: This is barely recognizable as a beer. This may be the worst beer I've ever had. If I was offered this by someone, I would politely decline and just have water instead. Honestly, this is terrible. Its only redeeming quality is that it's 8% ABV so at least I could possibly get drunk enough to forget I ever had it."
"This might be really appreciated by people who grew up on ""Grape Drink"" (Dave Chapelle?) or who cannot tolerate the bitterness of a good brew. You'll probably love it if you like like fruity beers. I did. But since I like bitter DIPA's regularly, I can't get over how good this beer is. I just wonder what a Bell's Hopslam would taste like after one of these?"
"I honestly dont even know if this is really a ""beer"" or more of a flavored malt beverage as i feel there really isnt much of an emphasis on hops and malt interplay."
"My new FAVORITE beer! Smell, taste, mouthfeel and especially drinkability are all FANTATSTIC! It's a little strong at 8% alc, but goes down smooth. My local liquor store only carries it in 6 packs, and sells out pretty regularly. A highly recommended drink."
"IF this was a wine-cooler review, I would say this is good."
"Unfortunately this may be a better beer to mix in a smoothie, or pour over your pancakes!"
"Overall I have been going after some real winners lately but this may be hands down the worst I have had."
"I guess if anything, it's the last time I buy this piss again."
"I've had a few sips for the purpose of this review. As soon as this is done, the rest is going to be a drain pour. Very low drinkability."
"A mixture of bud and blueberry extract! That is exactly what this beer taste likes. This has got to be one of if not the worst beer I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. Thankfully I did not purchase this beer as one of my friends bought it and gave one to me. It pours a purplish color and the overwhelming perfumed blueberry aroma was all that could be smelled! The taste, well, wine cooler came to mind. I could not finish this beer and will avoid at all cost!"
"D- Horrid for long term drinking, can have one or two max before the sweetness just becomes to powerful"
"Pours a dark blue/purple-ish color, not much head to speak of. Smells like blueberries, the flavor that dominates this beer. Tastes like blueberries as well, you can barely taste any hops in this. Mouthfeel was fine. At 8% ABV, this isn't something you can afford to have a few of. This doesn't belong in the category of beer, it belongs with hornsbys hard cider and mikes hard lemonade. If you are expecting a beer you are going to be let down, but if you want a fruity alcholic drink it might be worth a try."
"Drinkability - In my opinion, I dont think I can handle more than one of these at a time. It may be an excellent paring with cheesecake or another creamy desert, but I could not drink this beer by itself without something to contrast the blueberry flavor."
"As a lot of folks have noted this is one of AB's ""covered-up"" brews. One just has to ask, why is that?"
"Well, I can't say I don't like this - it tastes like a fruit cooler, with real fruit flavours, and is fairly refreshing, especially on a hot, sunny day. However, judging this as a beer is damned near impossible, as I can discern very few non-fruit characteristics in this alco-pop."
"Highly dissapointed with this beer as I could not tell on the packaging that it was made by AB. After one sip I threw it away, and placed the other five back in the fridge for company. It's more like a wine cooler with a hint of beer. We debated what they could have won their gold medal in... Best blueberry beers? Competition of one or two? It leaves the same dissapointment AB beers usually do with an irritating flat fizz afterwards."
"Constructive Criticism : Reduce the amount of spritzy fruit drink aspect and perhaps increase real fruit flavors that compliment the underlying beer (if you may)."
"Drinkability is average to me. If you don't REALLY like blueberries you will find this to be near intolerable. As it is I will finish the six pack but there won't be a repeat purchase."
"It's not the best beer I have ever had... but to me it's not terrible. I froze my glass and put frozen blueberries in it (like you would a Blueberry Ale in New England). It tasted a bit better than if you just drank it out of the bottle. The color makes this come off as a poor man's lambic. The nose is not the most pleasant (something I would expect from an A-B beer) , the taste is ok... mostly refreshing if you drink it the way I do. There is a significant aftertaste which bothers me, but hey what can you do? All in all... it's not a good beer, but not the worst. It is something I would drink in the hot summer heat."
"D: Terrible. Couldn't even choke down one beer - couldn't imagine having to drink more than one of these. Will never drink this again."
"ah yes, drinkability... i've read in other reviews this being compared to a wine cooler. sorry to say, i would prefer a wine cooler. drainpour, and that is a rare statement from me. i feel sorry for the drain."
"Aargh, hoodwinked again! I bought this beer even though I was skeptical about it. It said Blue Dawg brewing Co. and it had a ""North American Brewer's Association Gold Medal"" tagline on the box. If I had looked at the bottle and seen ""made with real and artificial fruit flavors"" I would have been even more skeptical. Of course, after trying it I ran to BA to see what was the deal. A-B. Enough said. I wouldn't be so mad except for the subterfuge. Still a waste of $8, it tastes like a boozy budweiser with blueberry juice."
"Purple-hued with minimal head. clear. Kind of stinks like when I try to make blueberry Mr. Beer beer. Tastes astringent with alcohol notes... Kind of rough. Blueberry is present but it tastes like a mediocre berry wine. I don't care for it. It's hard to drink more than one."
"I don't think this is a nasty drink deserving of a F grade, but it fails as judged as a beer."
"D - Meh. Ok to try, hard to drink lots. The more it opens, the worse it gets."
"Drinkability - It is fine if you like the sweet bartles & james wine coolers which i do not care for."
"This is not a re-buy and I suggest the brewer remove it from the inventory like we did and dump the remaining bottles down the drain."
"Pours a deep purple red color, attractively translucent, smallish head is white with surprisingly good lacing. Aroma is of blueberry syrup, canned blueberries, quite sugary and artificial. The flavor is sweet with blueberry syrup and a canned blueberry flavor, lingering sweetness and a touch of licorice. Medium bodied, fairly heavy and syrupy from whatever they added to give it the blueberry, carbonation is moderate, a bit lower than expected. This is actually much better than expected, as I expected terrible things, but this isn't good or something I would want to drink."
"They finally made something for the ladies... and at 8% i'd imagine it was to try and get them drunk..."
"I am not going to bother with saying anything more than is necessary or, after trying to submit the review, required by the website. This stuff is naaasty. It is a kiddie beer that is entirely too sweet and has very little - if anything - going for it. Look elsewhere for your blueberry beer fix. This is one you can safely avoid and lose no sleep over."
"Not really the best beer ever..."
"Pours a deep purple-ish color with some smallish head... nothing too great but nothing too terrible. Nose is almost all blueberries for this one, some lager-y-ness, but not much. And, at that, the blueberries are pretty nice (artificial, though). Same thing with the taste, basically an over-berried blueberry muffin. I know it's a sin, but I actually kind of enjoy this. Maybe I'm just in the mood for a fruity malt beverage. A hint of sourness too in there. Smooth, medium to light body, coating. Nice drinkability, couldn't believe that it's 8%. Worth trying if the price is right. One dimensional, not the best-made beer, but not the worst beer I've had."
"I could see this being refreshing on a hot day but there are probably better alternatives out there."
"I had just finished a sea dog blueberry wheat beer, which I thought was decent, so I figured I'd give this one a shot. What a mistake. drain pour."
"An alcoholic kool aid? A malt cooler? A blueberry beer soda? Not something I'd want to experience twice."
"THIS BEER AT ALL COSTS! !!"
"Taste is tart and sweet artificial blueberry flavor. It is not a total sweet sugar-alco-pop though. The 8% ABV is hidden well, no surprise there as this is really just a panty-dropper masquerading as a malted barley beverage. To have the word ""lager"" on the label is extremely misleading and just flat out wrong. Still waiting for a hint of beer to show up to the party. No? Ok then, I will proceed to dump about 3/4 of this down the drain. Stay far, far away. I will not be touching this bitch with a 10-foot pole ever again."
"Drinkability: This tastes like spolied grape juice with maybe a bit of children's medicine. Overly harsh and sour, this was hard to finish. One and done and just a step above Cave Creek Chili as my least favorite beer."
"ahhh. I head a bit of hype about it from some no BA friends, the same friends who's number one beers are fat tire and yeungling, I thought I would give it a whirl. The smell is off right from bat. It smells of fruit (not lager should smell of fruit), Low grade vodka, and sweetener. The nose carries unfortunately right to the palate. It taste like someone put sweetener in this beer and then when you weren't looking put a splash of low grade vodka, really bad, possibly the worst i've ever tried. It does have 8 Percent ABV but its not quality and I struggle to believe this beer is adjunct free. Someone cut some corners on this brew. It does provide a purpose and it gets people away from the big BMC beers but it's not a huge gap. If you are a BA, don't get this beer, this is about as worse as it gets."
"I poured this strange beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a dark purple color and poured a big pink head. Very strange for sure. The head however did not last long. Lacing was good. The smell was great, very berry for sure. However it was a very dry beer I thought. Not bad for an odd-ball beer.I would drink again though mostly just to freak people out."
"(d) How's this for drinkability. Im not finishing this. I'm a stubborn man, but Im 100% ok drain-pouring this one. I think this would make a great starter beer for the 300lb 15 yr-old who dreams of weekends filled with smirinoff and mojitos. I really feel like having a sit down with my wife over this one...and to think I was debating taking her to Dark Lord Day with me...geesh(1/5)"
"The color and aroma was nice, but it lacked somehow in flavor. I was expecting the blueberry to play a big part in the flavor, and really feel like it fell short. I was also expecting a tartness to it. Neither were apparent. Faint blueberry taste, not tart, no real hoppy taste. Just kinda fell flat. I'm not gonna say its terrible, but will probably not try it again. The lacing resembles a Lindeman's, but lacing means nothing if the flavor isnt quite right. To me its compareable to a mich ultra with a blueberry in the glass. Which was not what i was looking for. As for the alcohol content. It is 8%, but kinda gives you a kick in the pants. I agreed with another reviewer that said seemed more like 18%."
"But ugh, the taste, not like beer, its like a vodka blueberry shot. Way too sweet to be a beer. And it stays that way throughout. No thanks. Alcohol seems like it is 18%, not 8%. . ."
"I think the main thought that turned me off with this beer was whether or not all this flavoring was artificial. The front claims that it has ""Natural flavors and color from fruit juice."" That can't be all though. Just too sugary. A ""bitch beer," if you will. My girlfriend would love this stuff. And while I, too, can appreciate an 8% ALC/VOL rating, I just don't dig this stuff that much."
"I like how the commercial description makes sure to mention hops and malts cuz you wouldn't know they were present otherwise. A kiddie beer."
"The taste is sweet and sugary, similar to a blueberry soda that has gone flat. The alcohol is hard to detect, which is its only saving grace. Not appealing, couldn't or wouldn't drink another one. Even one has its challenges."
"To start with, I adore blueberries. Fresh, ripe, and real blueberries, that is. Nonetheless, this Nehi grape-colored debacle may say it contains ""natural flavors and colors", but beer it is not. And I question the ""blueberry"" content as well. Maybe the 8% ABV is meant to obscure the fact that this one commits abominable and atrocious acts on the tastebuds? It tastes like an alcoholic grape soda, with no discernable hint of hops, just a weird, artificial fruity flavor that lingers like a Wild Irish Rose version of beer. Ugh. Avoid."
"well its a blue berry lager, so i was thinking a sweet blueberry taste, but what i got was almost Robitussin. the color, was a crimson, not any touch of the blue or really even a purple color., it went down smooth but for being a blue berry, not impressed, try blue points."
"this beer belongs in the NOT top ten for sure. Only after long deliberation did i even buy this beer, under the assumption it was a craft malt beer with some blueberry nodes. (the 8% wasn't exactly a turnoff either). it pours a dark purple head with slightly good retention. but after a couple sips, the cough syrup taste was too overwhelming for me. im not too ashamed to say that half of this beer went down the sink. good price though if this sort of thing is up your alley."
"D: This is one of the worst beer's I've had in a long time. 2010's worst beer experience thus far. Fruit flavored malt liquor was the thought that stuck with me as I drank. I came very close to pouring this one down the drain, but a friend of mine had bought it and I didn't want to be rude. A beer I will be giving a wide berth to next time I spot it in the store."
"If I wanted to drink pop I would have bought a six pack of Dr. Pepper and a fifth of Southern Comfort to go with it."
"this is the best blueberry beer i've had. my blueberry kick started when i went to maine this past oct 2009. i had seadog and national harbour. every bar in maine practically served blueberry beer. when you get it on draft, they put blueberries in it and they dance around like a lava lamp. this is definitely the best blueberry beer i'd had (had at least 6). it holds it's taste to the very end of the bottle. i got a few cases from sneiders for $30 case. they also sell it at yes, organic for $7.50 a six pack. they now are serving it at commissary restaurant at $5 /bottle. it's very popular here in DC. oh..did i mention it's 8.0% etoh! 2 beers and you'll be done! or not!"
"Mouthfeel: Ok carbonation so it goes down easy but it is very thick. I think it turned my tongue purple. Though i will say it does have a pretty cool logo."
"Kudos to those few that love this concoction. You must have iron-clad willpower to make it through an entire glass."
"Drinkable, but the fake smell/taste turn me off."
" Very limited drinkablity due to the 8% abv, which delivers a rather quick buzz thanks to all of the sugar. a sneaky beer too...as the lable tries to make you think it's craft brewed by saying: Brewed in Baldwinsville, NY."
"Was surprised to see this beer had such a low average rating. I thought that it was pretty good, and would have never guessed it was an AB product. The smell is good - lots of fresh, juicy, sour blueberry notes. The taste is good too - ripe, sugary blueberry with some hints of black and raspberry. The most surprising thing is how one of these can creep up on you fast. The 8% ABV is well hidden. I would definitely have this beer again."
"looks like grape juice. purple and slick, with a tight pink head that disappears immediately. smells of blueberries and alcohol. very strong alcohol. tastes more like carbonated grape juice spiked with vodka. nothing else really detectable. feels syrupy and heavy. would have been a drainpour had my girlfriend not been here to drink it happily."
"Poured the brown bottled liquid into a pint glass. Immediately caught an aroma of sweet candy blueberry. It was a purple cranberry color with a single finger creamy head that dissipated quickly. My initial taste was syrupy blueberry bubble gum flavoring, but interesting. As I continued to drink I noticed a nice lacing around the glass and light reddish purple color. I also noticed that the aroma began to take on a chemically type smell. The flavoring was nice with a hint of alcohol in the finish. I did enjoy the entire experience but would only drink one or two at a time. I liked the ABV of 8%. I also liked the light sweet drinkability it provided. It would be a nice beer with a light fruity salad with chicken. Overall, I enjoyed it and will try it again."
"I did not know this was A&B. I bought it cause it was cheap and higher %. This is not what I normally drink at all but I can respect the people who made this one. (Normal circumstances, I dislike Busch. I live in STL) It is not for everyone obviously. After sessions with with one now twice, I felt comfortable to review it. Not for the faint of heart to say the least."
"My stomach hurts after drinking it, it will give you an awesome buzz, but it's not worth it when it comes to taste and pleasure, not an easy drinker with the high alcohol content mixed with a foul aftertaste. They label it as a ""fruit beer", but it tastes like the shittiest fruit I ever consumed."
"D: I won't buy this for myself again, though I can understand that fans of wine coolers/'flavored malt beverages' would probably enjoy this."
"Picked up a sixer@ the local store, I actually was going for the SN Celeration Ale, which they where fresh out of and this caught my eye, says on the carton that they won a gold medal, What a laugh, This is not beer, it's more like rancid fruit juice laced with alc. I will never buy another AB product again in my life as this product is a INSULT!!!!"
"Stay away. The head looked pretty ridiculous, thin and bright bubble gum pink. I gave it a good drinkability rating because it doesn't seem like 8% despite alcohol being up front in the flavor. Other than that, it made me think of Dimetapp mixed with vodka. Syrupy and sickeningly sweet. Yuck."
"Although this beer has gotten bad review from most of the users on this site I was exceptionally pleased with the overall taste of this beer. Yes, it is a sweet beer and yes it is a bit overpowering but I tend to think this can be a good thing from time to time. It really depends on the overall users taste. I myself am a big fan of blueberries, and to find a beer that tastes like a lucious and sweet blueberry that pops in your mouth as you eat it I think that this beer has been unfairly rated in most aspects. I think of this beer as more of a lambic than anything if you are looking for a retreat from the more servitude koscher beer flavors than this beer is for you. It's definately not your average beer but as fruit flavored beers go it definitely promises more flavor than your average Sam Adam's Cherry lambic. Don't expect this beer to be your normal beer flavor, but don't discount it for being too fruity, who knows you may like it I did."
"This is 100% malternative (and an especially vile one). Not beer. Get it outta here."
"D- Tough to handle...took almost an hour to get one down while cleansing my palate with a better beer. I just did't want to waste the alcohol that was presented to me."
"Taste: This is reminiscent of the sparkling fruit juices out there that have no alcohol or even a malt liquor or pop. This is definitely not a beer taste at all. It is not like other people say that it is undrinkable but it is not what you would want if you were looking for a beer."
"This is a cheap beer with artificial flavoring; one of the first beers my friend bought when he turned 21 (three months ago) and the rest of the six pack is still sitting in the fridge. Awful!"
"D: It's flavorful but only from the blueberry extract and not very tasty, does not go down very easily but at least it's not too filling, strong kick but it just makes a bad beer worse, this beer is just plain awful."
"The taste is simply fruit juice, with some alcohol in it. No beer like qualities to it at al for me and the 8%abv? I didn't feel anything from it at all so drinking this ""beer"" was a complete waste of it's share of the mixed sixer..."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a dark purple with a light purple head that left a slight cap. The aroma is of blueberries... really the color and smell is what I would expect for a blueberry beer so average in my book. The taste however is like a cheap malt liquor beverage you would give to your high school girlfriend (back when you were in high school) because she wouldn't drink a tall boy with you and your friends. Very sugary taste, overly tart and fruity. I can't even get my wife to finish this."
"Best use? Reduce it and pour it over vanilla ice cream; such would be its only purpose. Please, this is a joke....no?"
" ~ I believe this to be a poor attempt at Lambic style brew. If that's what they were going for... ouch. I will not be recommending this to my friends, however, I will try to finish the drink I've poured. Thanks Rob."
"This is a neat beer, it's a sweet beer. Works great for hop and bitter beer haters. If you Like SA Cherry Wheat you won't be sorry you tried this."
"Overall: Going against the curve here a bit but this is my straight up opinion. Would have never known this was a AB product if it wasn't for BA. Although it doesn't hit the lager title head on its definately welcomed as it is quite tasty and smooth. Looking for a lager then look elsewhere but if you want a decent sweet blueberry beer with a moderate abv then this will be your pick."
"Bought a six-pack from the supermarket with a girl who loves beer as much as I do. Took it home and poured it into pint glasses. It pours a clearish-purple with effervescent bubbles and only a little bit of white-ish head. Sparse lacing around the rim as I poked my nose into the glass for a sniff. Very strong blueberry smell followed by the aroma of alcohol (according to the label this beer is 8% ABV!?!) The ""natural"" flavor (read: chemical flavoring added) of blueberry overpowers the normal hints of hops or malt. Really this beer just tastes like a punchier Boone's Farm or an alcoholic lolipop. It should win over people who don't much like beer, but for a beer enthusiast there isn't much to like. I'd suggest Sweetwater Blue as an alternative to this product if you're interested in berry beer."
"This is probably my least favorite beer. The beer pours a bluish tint, not a great amount of carbonation and not too much of a head. It smells strongly of blueberries, which isn't too bad, until you get to the taste. Very fake, very strong blueberry flavor that lingers a bit as well. Not enjoyable in the least. I didn't finish the beer."
"This is definitely hangover material... I would avoid at all costs."
"More of a beer cooler or wine cooler, than a fruit beer. Interesting to say the least."
"D- Again, it's like blueberry pop so I could have one or two but the ABV and color is the most appealing aspects of this beer"
"Not good at all, but a refreshing beer for sure."
"Poured red and gathered a pink head...great for us gals...Head disappeared quite quickly. Nose of bluberries, taste of blueberry champagne, ultra light mouthfeel, and the 8% ABV kicks in quickly. Just a pretty reddish beer, champagne-like aftertaste, and very sweet. Not a beer to overload on, only a true fruity beer lover can appreciate this. Worth a try, the big AB company is trying to make a stake in the micro brewing business, not up to my standards."
"D - I would give this beer a ""1" in this category but the extra half point goes to the college boys who pick up a 6 of this for a party in hopes of getting laid by a helpless woman getting blasted off his 8% fruit syrup crap. Ugh. Appearance and smell had me worried I'd have the only non-D or F review until I had my first sip. Then I realized why it was so low."
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a pretty blue/voilet color with a small head. Has a strong smell of sweet blueberries. Taste just like it smells. Sweet and fruity. Feels light in the mouth and goes down very easily. Overall I was pleasently surprised. This is a quality brew."
"I'm not gonna call this a drain pour (I'm from WI so I don't believe in that) but I would not recommend this to anybody."
"Saw this at the store and it looked interesting. It was clearly one of the ""mock micros"" that seem to be popular among the BMC marketing groups, but I thought it might be worth a try. Frankly, I should have been well-warned by a beer that has its 8% ABV so prominently placed on the label. I'm sure this is popular among the college crowd."
"Drinkability - Cloying and fake tasting. It might be okay for your non-beer drinking girlfriend though."
"I had low expectations for this one and (amazingly) it still came up short! Purplish color with a pinkish head. It smelled like a blueberry muffin which isn't a bad thing but there were no beer-like aromas at all. It tasted like blueberries and water. Again, lacking beer-like qualities. Mouthfeel was watery and thin. This is not drinkable. I could not finish it. My wife loves blueberries and she didn't like it either."
"The first thing that I noticed was that this was a lager and not an ale. Sounds like a refreshing summer beer. I poured into a pint glass and was surprised by the purple color. It looks like a grape pop (that's what I call soda). It smells syrupy sweet. I've had blueberry ales, but this seems too artificial. I kind of get a hint of beer smell in there. It tastes sweet at first, and then finishes tart. It is way too artificially sweet. I like fruit beers that have a hint of fruit, not making it the focal point. I can't see drinking more than one of these. I should follow this up with a Stone Ruination. That would be a real shock to the taste buds, going from sweet to bitter."
"Drinkability: Bad. The first few sips weren't awful; in fact, I kind of liked it. However, by the time I neared the end of the bottle, it just became a chore to finish. It's too sweet, and the blueberry became too overpowering. This is definitely not something I will be getting again."
"First off, what is wrong with me, that I keep falling for this trick of fruit beers. It always sounds like a good idea but I always get let down ( excet the Wheach). Secondly, what is wrong these brewers that think a fake fruit, heavy syrupy flavor is what anyone wants to drink. Best thing about this beer was that I got a bottle I can use for homebrewing. Thus beer pours a raspberry color with the same color head. Smell is of tart fruit. Taste is the same but with the added bonus of a thick sickly sweet syrupy fruit flavor. Tough to get tough to get through this one, took about 30-40 min. Not what I was hoping for on a hot summer day in Oklahoma. Oh well you live you learn, well at least some people do...I'm sure i'll be back."
"There are much better beers out there, but if drank quickly this is kinda refreshing."
"holy crap this was bad!! got it from a friend because he was instantly put off by it after one sip. I thought I'd be the better man, I was wrong. poured out a raspberry color and smelled like a tart red wine? no head unless aggressively agitated, and then dissipates quickly. tastes like a wine cooler, overly aggressive blueberry and alcohol flavors. this one got dumped after about 1/4 of the glass. would not buy this if you want to have a beer, because this is not beer."
"It's just not beer to me."
"Stay away from this one."
"Pours plumish purple with minimal light pink foam--already not what I was expecting (although I guess I'm not surprised). Nose is of candy-like blueberry and cheap beer, almost stale. The smell is really not very enticing to say the least. The taste is much more like bad grape soda than blueberry beer. It seems to get better now that I'm expecting more of a soda flavor than beer flavor. I can't get around this flavor that feels so artificial. In fact, if you told me it was soda I might believe you. Pretty light bodied, which frankly, is pretty impressive for a beer with 8% abv. Not very drinkable in my mind, although I'm a pretty staunch hophead and perhaps this beer has its place in someone else's fridge. I suppose I was hoping for more beer essence and far less fake fruit taste. If one wanted to have a beer like this, I would just get a true lambic. I don't believe I will be drinking this one again."
"Note: My friend gave this to me, toting it as ""the worst beer ever"" not true, it's tolerable, but it's pretty bad."
"Those who find this beer a bad option must be stuck in the mindset that beer must taste one way and one way only....but Wild Blue stands on its' own. The only surprising thing about Wild Blue is that it is made by those who bring us Budweiser. Will it hold up through the transition period to new ownership? I do not know - but if it does - then maybe reviewers who skewered this unique brew will be able to revisit and maybe change their minds."
"d- average price, slightly better than average taste and excellent drinkability. my girlfriend is not a huge beer drinker and she also enjoyed this one. its a ""fruit/ vegitable beer"" so it is pretty typically a girlie drink. i dont know how often i would go out of my way for this beer but i will definately be buying it for her again."
"Definately not something I'd drink regularly, but I would drink it again. More of a novelty drink with an 8 percent ABV."
"Ok, it was dark, hot and I just wanted a beer. I grabbed one and slammed it back. Then I thought I'd take my time, and the second was not cold as ice could make it. Sickly medicinal off taste. But I perservered it was hot and I really wanted a beer, this was all that was left backstage. Then I got hit with a buzz, I got in the light and read 8percent ABV. So not only is it not good, but it's outright dangerous if you're looking for relief from the heat in a cold icy 4 percenter. Not that you'd ever want to session this crap anyway."
"Mouthfeel was decent with a respectable amount of carbonation that made it pleasing to drink. Flavor was all fruit. I couldn't even sense the alcohol. I really thought this was fruit juice mixed with club soda. Nothing about this flavor tells me it's a beer. Very sweet and fruity. This was very different. Won't get it again."
"So...where's the lager? This just tastes like alcohol-infused grape/blueberry juice concentrate. I had an alco-pop once, can't quite remember the name, maybe Lizard-something-or-other--it's pretty sad that Wild Blue isn't quite as ""good"" as that. Had the flavor come through, all other aspects of this beer could be forgiven, but it doesn't perform that well, and I'm pretty sure I was an idiot for buying a six-pack. Too bad my wife has decent taste in beer and that my friends are smarter than I am--makes it hard to get rid of the other 5 bottles. Or maybe I'll experiment with thickening it up for a pancake topping. Or...uh...hey, anybody wanna trade?"
"The first sip made me cringe. The initial taste of this medium bodied beverage is not just artificial but medicinal. It honestly tastes like someone took the cheapest malt liquor they could find and then poured all the blueberry flavored syrup they could get into this. This is honestly god awful."
"D: Too sweet. Got tired of it real quick. Very few beers I will never drink again; this is one. Its like full-flavored Zima."
"D - this beer made my stomach hurt. it also tasted pretty shitty. never again."
"D: This is one terrible brew. For the life of me I can't understand why they would put this out."
"I'm glad I was able to buy a single of these, and not wasted my $$$ on a six pack. What deceived me was it says it is brewed by Blue Dawg Brewing in Baldingsville, NY, in fact, it's a AB product. Avoid this one, your drain will be happy!"
"I'd say overall it's worth a try just purely as a drink, but it's definitely not a beer."
"Pale red/purple color with a pink head. Smell is very sweet. Taste hides the alcohol (8%) well, but the sweetness overpowers the other flavors. I had no idea this beer was 8.00% until I started realizing that I was buzzed as I was taking my last sip. Not terrible, but not extraordinary either."
"I've always wanted to try this as it is one of their higher ABV brews. Pours a blueish color with a weak head. No berries in the nose or taste. Just artificial sweetener, adjuct malts and grassy hops. Watery body kind of sucks. Not worth the money or time to drink. Go with water."
"no thanks HIGHPA."
"Like a combination of grape juice and medicine. It even looked liked juice when I poured it into the glass. I thought this was a craft beer, and when I tasted this garbage I had to find out more, I am very suprised that even AB would put this out. Avoid at all costs."
"Purple and clear... purple. Candy-blueberry aroma. Taste is malt liquor kick in the teeth, with strong alcohol profile and blueberry cough mediciney flavor. I can't say I'm digging this brew. Mouthfeel is weak and watery, surprising for its abv but not for its simple nature. Finish is blueberry sweet, but again its of the artificial variety (think kids cereal or candy). This wasn't very drinkable."
"I, like many others, bought this beer accidentally thinking that it might be like Blue Paw Wheat Ale which I kinda like. I also thought that the 8% alcohol by volume might be interesting. However, try as I might I simply could not force myself to drink this; honestly, I did try. It looked like cool aid, smelled like blueberry jam, tasted perfectly dreadful with an even more horrible aftertaste. It also had the effect of something like cold duck or some horrible drink from the seventies. Had I seen anything on it that connected it to Busch, I would have steered clear but it is quite deceptive. Giving this scum a drinkability score would imply that it was drinkable and trust me...it was not. I have never ever poured beer or ale down the drain, but I did with this. The terrible thing is that I actually bought this. God help me!"
"But what really hurt my feelings was that the bottle doesn't say it's AB. I found that out just now. I thought it was just a cruddy niche-microbrew with one novelty beer, but no, it's a Macro with a front. How depressing."
"I think this beer has a certain merit - I can drink this junk like it's fanta grape soda. I like good beer and a refined palate just like I like Argentinian tenderloin and a black-fruity, spicy malbec. But, I wanted to chug something and make it worth it (i.e. 8%). Better 'n chugging Arrogant Bastard and WASTING money."
"unless you have a vagina."
"Drinkability: a few at a time will do you, as the sweet blueberry flavor can get to you"
"For me it's not a beer so there is no point in my trying to act all beer snobby about Wild Blue. It is something more along the lines of a Zima, a blueberry Zima. It's purple, it's fizzy, it's fruity tasting, & it's carbonated. I will enjoy Wild Blue when the weather heats up a bit as in the Summer I am not always looking for a heavy beer when it 98° outside. This fruity concoction with an 8% kick will fit the bill for me & the price is fairly reasonable too."
"as an aside, i know this beverage is called a lager but what i drank hardly tasted like one. this beverage brought wine coolers or Hard Lemonades to mind more than beer, though it doesn't fully fit in that category either. i'll leave it at that"
"A very odd reddish purple color with a fizzy light blue head. The only aroma I can detect is fruit,. Flavor is like way too sweet blueberry cough syrup with little else in the way of flavors, a medium sticky body with loads of carbonation,this tastes like a wine cooler,and should be labeled as such, I feel like I got ripped off here, shame on you AB,shame on you !"
"Quite a bit of carbonation and a bit of stickiness in the mouthfeel. Only drank one and that was a bit of a struggle. Every time I see someone buy a sixer of this, I always wonder if they have any idea what they're getting themselves into. I've tried it once and that'll be it for me."
"wow, reminds me of the super bowl...a partial case of BUD left over remaining in the fridge (why did i let it stay?)...everytime i tried to drink it, i would just add some juice to it and make a beer spritzer...my bud spritzer with TRADER JOE's blueberry juice was simply a less awful way of swallowing (almost) anything from A-BUSCH! i'll give their pale ale an ok..."
"The pour looked as if I'd shaken up a container of grape juice and poured it into my pint glass. I was slightly taken aback as I had not read about this beer prior to trying it. The label said blueberry flavored lager, but I had a hard time discerning any taste of beer whatsoever. I did find it somewhat refreshing...and then I was left with the last 2/3 of the bottle. Really not a pleasure to finish. Neither were the next five."
"One good thing about Wild Blue is the 8% alcohol content. Have a couple of these and you won't care so much about the taste. Don't drink too many though - blue vomit does not sound nice."
"It has a fruity flavor, but there's some sour undertones that throw it off."
"One in the crowd suggest that wine drinkers will enjoy this drink? i disagree because of the lack of vicinity."
"D 2.0 - Interesting taste on a strong ABV cocktail marketed as ""lager"". Definitely far from beer, lager or balance of any sort. If you love blueberries you may like this one. But watch out it's deceivingly strong, sweet, and packed full of calories."
"While it is very bad, you can finish one. It tastes more like cool-aid than actual beer. It's TOO fruity and not beery enough for me. It is also a very fake blueberry taste, almost candy like."
"It is a fine once in a while beer."
"Drinkability - it's an alcopop, and for sweet tooths like me, I could drink it again but don't foresee me buying it. Blueberry wine cooler, anyone?"
"Drain pours are few and far between at our house, this was one of them. Not recommended."
"Interestingly enough, this beer is labeled on the front as a ""Blueberry Lager"" and on the back it is describe as a ""Flavored Ale"". Wow, is all I have to say Lager yeast and Ale yeast in the same beer!!! Huzzah!!!"
"Fast forward a month later - inside at normal air temperature - cold out of a bottle. Way, way too sweet for me. Like someone else said, kind of like grape juice with alcohol and carbonation added. Would never purchase. I'd drink Olympia instead (if they still make that stuff). In the end I would not really call this ""beer"" as most people would define the term. Maybe a wine cooler, but not beer IMO."
"don't let the first drink fool you...it almost did me...kind of refreshing first swig...but its drastically down hill from there...even my wife, who prefers more fruit brews didn't care too much for this one...that says a lot..."
"This beer poured a dark reddish purple with a single-finger pink head. The smell is very fruity, almost soda-like with a lot of blueberry and some alcohol. The taste is what I imagine a blueberry wine cooler would be. A big artificial candy-like blueberry blast that seems artificially sweetened in a lame attempt to cover up the alcohol on the back end. You may have noticed that I didn't mention any beer flavors, and that's because there aren't any. If I was tasting this blind I would guess that it is some sort of denied Bartles and James ""malt beverage"" instead of a beer. The mouthfeel is thin and fairly aggressively carbonated as to resemble a soda. It's pretty drinkable. I'm not sure how to score this, since it's not entirely unpleasant, but it's also not really a beer."
"D- This is a weird beer. Very hard to grade. It depends on what they were going for here....as alcoholic grape juice this is a raving success....as a lager based fruit beer it's unbelievably cloying....it doesn't taste like a beer at all. I'm impressed at how well the 8% is hidden though."
"Purple colored beer with a thin rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are both blueberry.The aftertaste of this beer reminds me of Boo Berry cereal.Overall it's decent and although I'm sure by definition this is a beer to me it's a wine cooler with a high abv.This is something that should be reviewed on wine cooler advocate."
"but if you like wine coolers and the like. this would be up your alley"
"Picked it up at the World Market in a make your own 6 pack. I thought it was a nice microbrew but apparently it is owned by Anheuser-Busch and it tastes like it."
"drinkability: a great session beer with low taste. Bud drinkers would highly approve. Not a great Beer advocate beer though"
"This is not a beer I'd be interested in having again. Thankfully, a friend of mine (who likes this beer) gave me a bottle, so no money was wasted. I finished the glass but that's all I'd ever care to have."
"I just can't enjoy this one. It's an extreme sweetness along with an extreme tartness that just shouldn't be there."
"M - I dont think I can stomach another. Reminds me of the episode of The Simpsons where Bart and Milhouse drink the pure syrup squishee; I think I'm having mild sugar hallucinations."
"Notes: very unique. i know that this one is a hit or miss. its not bad but i dont think i could drink too many at once, unless me and a buddy took a case camping up in canada a handful of years ago and it was all we had. great ""beer"" for those who otherwise dont like the taste of beer"
"Drink at your own risk, I'm remarkably unimpressed for the price."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgian globe. This color of this beer reminds me of what cheap, balloon on bottle wine looks like when made using Welch's Grape juice. Bright purplish blue with a big fizzy head that disappeared like fizz on a pop, leaving no lacing. The head retention sucks too. The aroma is nasty artificially sweet. Like sweet n' low mixed with juice box blueberry juice. The flavor reminds me of a cheap blueberry soda. Artificial sweeteners mixed with soda water. The only ""good"" thing I can say about it, is that Wild Blue hides the 8% alcohol very well. The mouthfeel is, well, like a artificially sweetened juice box. It really leaves a gross aspartame like sweetness on the palate. This is really a crappy beer but I can see it definitely going well with the Sorostitute crowd."
"Well nothing really good to say about this one. It smells like weak syrupy grape cool aid. As far as taste goes, it tasted like my daughters grape juice box. Sweet and well... sweet. The only thing this has going for it is the 8% ABV. It's just nasty..."
"D: First beer at a New Years party--since no one else would drink it I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately I couldn't get past the first few sips before having to move on to something else."
"Overall: I was looking for a different fruit beer I havn't tried before, saw this on the shelf at my local grocery and decided to try it. The initial pour had me look at the label again to make sure I didn't accidently buy wine coolers. The first taste had me looking at the lable once more. With an 8% AVB it wasnt long after bottle 4 that I was feeling in a party mood. Unless you're trying to party without regards to taste, I don't reccomend Wild Blue."
"Vibrant purple Kool Aid/grape soda appearance accompanied by a brisk fine short lived burst of carbonation. The aroma is mild sour blueberry but for a beer so bright and similar to a soda I am disappointed by the meager aroma. Tastes like a soda I can imagine a bit of wheat flavor in the tail end. Fizzy first then flat. Terrible head retention and thin. It has been a while since I did not finish a bottle of ""beer," but I could not finish this stuff. If you want a soda, buy a soda it will taste better. If you want a beer, buy one it will taste better. If you are a teen male looking for a bubbly sweet alcohol laden beverage to subjugate the opposite sex for the evening, well Anheuser-Busch has created the product for you."
"T + M + D: The blueberry is VERY sweet and incredibly overbearing. Mouthfeel adds a bit of a stickiness that doesn't help that at all. I find myself unable to detect any real 'beer qualities' in it, just a heavy and syrupy blueberry + alcohol. The carbonation is that of a big fruity spritzer, and after a while it gets to be a bit too much and hard on the stomach. Not recommended at all, unfortunately!"
"D: Well, I'm not even sure you can call this beer. Not really. It's like a fruity malternative on steroids... the beer equivalent of Boone's Farm. Drinkable? Well, yes, but why not just add some grain alcohol to fruit juice?"
"D- I found it to be much too sweet for a beer. It was almost soda-like."
"(rated Jul 15, 2008)"
"D: I was tempted to pour it down the drain, do not want again"
"Drinkability: I finished 3/4 of this bottle and just couldn't do the rest. I also let my wife (a all but non beer drinker) taste to see if maybe a different drinker might enjoy, she did not. This is too sweet for me and little to nothing that makes you feel like you are drinking a beer. I would say go to Sweetwater blue for more of a blueberry beer and less of a fruit sugar drink."
"drinkability is not great. sticky sweet juice berries with several unpleasant dimensions thrown in. i think this one was half decent when opened, but grew more offensive the more i tried to drink it."
"Pours a clear dark red, cranberry juice colour, thick light pink head forms, lots of lace, good retention, forms a solid layer. Smell is fucked, like feet and sweaty balls mixed with some fruit juice. My hockey bag with fruit febreeze, kind of gross, blueberry juice, but kind of gets worse with every smell. Taste is like salty fruit juice, mixture of balls, cold medicine, alcohol, homeless people, and sugar. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, syrupy, with medium carbonation. Wow, this is special stuff. Thanks Russ!"
"Can you say wine cooler on steroids? Seriously this beer is very different from anything else I've ever tasted. Very fruity, a dominent taste of blueberries and other tart fruity flavors. Pours a deep reddish purple. Has a tart after taste, not very pleasent at all. At 8% Abv its ease of consumption is suprisigly easy. If you're looking for something crazy and different give it a try. Not a beer in the traditional sense by any means."
"This is not that bad if you take it for what it is, a novelty item. If you're just looking to drink a good beer, this is not necessarily where to look. Again, if you can get past the fact that it's a novelty, change of pace sort of thing; and not a serious attempt at making a high quality lager. . . it's a strangely refreshing, serviceable quaff. I would, however, refrain from more than one at a time."
"I knew this beer would get horrible reviews on the account that it's made by Anheuser-Busch. You beer snobs are so predictable. However, I love blueberries and this is very intensely flavored with them. This is what you'd get if you combined 3/4 beer with 1/4 blueberry schnapps. It hardly beer, but it is different and satisfies my blueberry craving quite nicely. I doubt I could stomach more than 2 or 3 of these at a time. I'm not even done with the first one and my brain is already feeling slightly compromised."
"D) Wifey liked it. I'm worried about the chemicals from all the ""natural flavoring"" I just ingested, but the beer itself isn't too bad."
"I'd rank this much closer to an alcopop than a beer. Actually, as disgusting as Hard Lemonades are I'd probably take one over this. And as it comes with a premium beer pricetag, this is one you will be best off avoiding."
"Needless to say I ended up just throwing away the other 5. I should also make a note here that I did not notice it was an A.B. product until after I had finished it, so consider that a blind taste test from a guy who usually doesn't enjoy their stuff."
"Drinkability is blah. This had me at appearances but failed the rest of the gamut. First few sips were easy, the rest had no problem going down the drain."
"Least drinkable beer I have had despite a decent smell. My first drainpour. I have been weirdly excited about my first drainpour. YESSSS!"
"Pours a very reddish sort of color with a very slight pink head. I was thinking it would be more lager colored with a blue tinge. Looks more like a pale grape soda then a blueberry beer. Not bad looking just wasnt what was expected. Heavy fruit aroma and a very metallic smell to it. Again more grape then anything else. A LOT of fruit flavor but it doesnt define itself as being blueberry. Overly sweet tasting. No trace of being a beer at all. Syrupy sweet mouthfeel-I can still lick my lips and get sweetness 5 minutes after a sip. I would call this a malt beverage before I put the label ""beer"" on it. I tend to love AB beers-thats just me. This is nowhere near a beer. I bet INBEV gives this the axe once the takeover is in place. Not terrible-I bet someone likes the stuff, just not me."
"I have a friend that loved this stuff so much he called me and told me I had to try it. I some in the fridge from a mix-a-six. So I tried it right away. I thought it was alright but not as great as he did. It has a purple like body with a slightly red hue. The head and lace were kind of a purple/fuchsia color but both were thin. The mouthfeel was watery. It smelled like blueberries and alcohol. Sort of like the cheap schnapps that you buy in a European train station. The taste is about the same. It just seems artificial. However I do due the oddness of this beer and the alcohol content it is a novelty."
"I have to admit I was not expecting this when I first tried it. I have had several blueberry-infused beers in my day but none this prominent. It pours deep blue-ish/purple just like blueberry juice with a light purple head, and the aroma of blueberry overwhelms your olfactory senses. On first taste I thought I had bought a soda, not a beer due to the overwhelming flavor of fruit and lack of beer. I don't know what all ingredients were used to make this but it tastes as if a couple gallons of blueberry juice were dumped into a batch of brew. On the plus side it is 8% alcohol so you won't regret the decision of buying it for very long!!"
"Pours a wine colored purple-red color body with a light purplish head, but smallish and diminishing. Very sugary, sweet aroma, some blueberry. Soda-ish aroma, syrupy. A Mellow sweet taste, like blueberry soda. Hides the alcohol. Fizzy. Okay."
"Overall: A big letdown. I saw the cool bottle and 8% ABV, and noticed the brewery listed as ""Blue Dawg Brewing."" Turns out that this is just another AB craft poseur, coming across more like one of their ""malt beverages"" such as Sparks, ad nauseam rather than any kind of ""premium lager with natural flavors."" Sorry Bud; it's another dud."
"Probably wouldn't buy again but if someone had one to give I might be able to stomach one."
"Yeah, it's from Anheuser-Busch, but I can't wait to have another."
"so... got a girl who don't like beer and you wanna take her home and stick it in her ear, get a six of wild blue and make her suck down one or two, she'll be feeling mighty fine and then you'll have her behind!"
"Color, Aroma, Flavor? Well, think ""Nantucket Nectar"" juice with a splash of soda water to give a light tingle of carbonation. No head to speak of. The bar was too dark to really get a good feel for its color, but it sure looked ""blueberry juice""-like to me. No lingering flavor to follow the sweet blueberry juice start, no malt finish or dash of hops to bite back, I really couldn't tell that this was a ""beer"" at all. At 8% this thing could be a very dangerous thing because you don't really notice the alcohol ... I'd class it along with ""Wine Coolers"" just with barley as the alcohol source."
"Anyway, it poured a purple/ blue color with no head. Smelled of sweet concentrated fruit. Tasted the same, like a mouthful of blueberry pie filling. It was very sweet but not too much to handle. I could have gone for another and the 8% is a plus, considering you can't taste any of it."
" In it's defense, it did make a great blueberry fudge cake and my girlfriend liked it, so I gave it some taste points."
"Conclusion: I know i said Dimatapp alot, and i know Dimatapp is grape...but this totally reminds me of it. Its not good... but not bas, and may not be a beer. Some will absolutely love it, and others like me, will drink it if it's around and you want something that doesn't taste like beer for some reason"
"D: OK, I thought this was a beer. Good ol' Anheuser-Busch pulled a fast one (including not having it's name on the bottle!). If you want the beer version of communion wine...this is it. I should have researched this one before buying. Oh well...live and learn."
"A,S,T,M,D: Someone poured concentrated blueberry juice in my Bud Light Ice. Tried this one on two occasions, both time I was only able to muster up 3 to 5 drinks before this swill went back to the water table. Yuck!"
"Edit: Couldn't even finish it... bad."
"D - Not good. It was a chore to finish this and I'm not looking forward to the other 5 in the fridge."
"D-Wow, it was hard to finish one of these. I simply just did not enjoy this and would not recommend it. I'm glad I did not pay for this beer."
"D - The 8% ABV is no where to be found here, all I could taste was blueberries, it's like a juice almost. Easy drinker for those who like the taste."
"dating code 08159"
"M: Lightly syrupy with highly fizzed, champagne-like carbonation. Tasted more like a wine cooler, than a beer. Nice if you want a sweet, easy drinker, but not in my fav 5."
"WOW, is all I can say. First off, the dog on the label looks like its kicking some blue feces to the side, which is not a good way to start. Pours a dark purple with a bright pink head.. I never thought I would see the day. Smells overly fruity and tastes like a cranberry juice cocktail. Way too fruity here, had trouble even finishing it. The appearance is pretty cool looking and the 8% ABV is well hidden, but thats about all it has going for it. If you can drink two of these in one sitting you deserve an award."
"I was pretty furious when I found out this stuff was brewed by AnheuserBusch. It says nothing about them on the bottle or the box, and I never would have bought it if I had known. That and it also says on the box that it won a 2006 gold medal from the North American Brewer's Association. Yet when you go to the NABA website, 2006 is the only year without the award winners posted. Hmmm. All in all a very deceptive product presentation which I, unfortunately, fell for. I should have known based on the ABV number and the price..."
"Is as drinkable as soda or juice."
"tastes closer to a mixed drink or wine cooler, but i don't mind, its still good."
"Not sure I would drink a lot of these, though if blueberry is your thing, this is for you!"
"This is easy to drink one or two after two it is just way too sweet. This reminds me more of a malt beverage than a beer. I don't think I can ever drink this again."
"Pours a three finger pink head that fades quickly, leaving some lace. Cloudy red color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Slight blueberry nose. Flavor is sweet blueberry more like a fruit drink with hints of hops. The 8% ABV is totally hidden. As a beer it is a one, as a refreshing beverage it's a three or so. $1.33 for a 12oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT"
"D: Drinkability suffers here due to its extreme overkill of sugary sweetness. Even one is far to much at times, not bad flavor wise just way overkill hinders this. Keep a glucose meter handy and don't say I didn't warn you."
"I don't usually trash a beer like this, I try to find some redeeming quality, but there is none in this"
"OK, seriously, can Anheuser Busch make a good beer? WTF is this thing? I poured it and was surprised to see a liquid like fizzy cranberry juice. Magenta beer? Purple foam? Smells like artificial flavor over hard alcohol. Upon tasting I see why. This brew is a whopping 8% and the heavy use of fake flavoring is there to cover the bottom shelf liquor flavor up. There is nothing but fake blueberry to taste. Like a Smirnoff Ice only stronger, sweeter and harder to drink. I can barely call this beer. It's only saving grace is it does have a semi-decent head upon pouring that laces nicely as you drink it. But I was glad when I was done drinking it. Steer clear oh beloved readers."
"D: If I cared to, I could have forced myself to drink this over an hour or so. But it just sat there in my glass, and I eventually dumped it."
"Overall, I was not fond of this beer. Many of my friends who know nothing about beer liked it...go figure!"
"This ""beer"" is basically a wine cooler in a bottle. It seems to lack both the defining flavors that are associated with beer and the resulting balance that can only exist by virtue of possessing both hop and malt flavors. If you're in for something sweet that lacks bitterness and balance, then this is for you. Otherwise, there's not really a whole lot here except for what the label says - blueberry (even then it doesn't look much like a blueberry)."
"Overall - Like I said before, it looks cool but that's all it has. This is basically something that Smirnoff should have come up with and maybe then it'll taste better. Otherwise, try it once and forget about it."
"D: Not a very drinkable beer. My friend brought over a six=pack and, other than the two we had to try it, no one else has opened one. Not a good beer and not recommended."
"Avoid this beer. This is awful stuff. I was lucky that I got only one bottle and didn't waste my money on the six pack."
"I am disappointed. This tastes like Peels or heavily spiked grape soda. I did not pick up on any beer qualities. The high alcohol content is a plus. Sadly, it is the only good thing going for Wild Blue. I am afraid I wouldn't be able to stomach more than 2, because his ""beer"" is just WAY TOO SWEET. The aftertaste is heavy in the mouth, and leaves the tongue and teeth with an unpleasant sour coating."
"I, like many, was fooled by this beer sitting on the shelves of my local Kroger. ""Oh, an award-winning blueberry lager by some brewery I've never heard of? I should try it"" I thought. Bad idea. The appearance of this ""beer"" is ruby, and the taste is almost like a sweet cranberry and vodka. It doesn't taste like beer at all and is way too sweet for me to drink more than two of these at a time. The 8% alcohol made me reach for this recently only to cap off my buzz and help get rid of this misleading brew."
"Reading the bottom of the box, and finding out who actually makes this, it is clear that AB just sent some Bud (or maybe even Busch or Nattie Lite) to Texas to have some blueberry syrup dumped in it."
"Unfortunately I drain poured this one."
"Overall its not bad but I dont think I could drink more than one of these."
"D: I would label it ""not that easy to drink"" and leave it at that. It just tastes like they were trying to do too much with it. It was interesting to experience it."
"The taste is just way too in your face grape juice and lager mixed. It is not that interesting until the finish where there is a nutty, slightly drying taste. The back end also suffers from a throaty ABV burn, that is just unbalanced with the rest of this beer. This beer is hard to digest after awhile and it really isn't that good. This is a beer with adjunct sweetner, but in this case, it was just over the top and badly compromised any integrity this thing may have had."
"Pours a diluted blood red with a tall pinkish head that retains nicely leaving behind some of the best lacing I've seen in a while.The nose is reminding me of new tire smell,very plasticy,some slight berry,but not fresh smelling.The taste is cheap and sugary.Mostly wild berry and some grape juice flavors.There is almost no mouthfeel,thin and watery with low carbonation.The alcohol seems well hidden,tho with some more alcohol flavors this may have somthing else to talk about,this one is very one dimentional."
"I was really excited about this when I saw it, as I love blueberries and it mentioned some awards that were won. I saw the 8%abv and thought ""whoa"". It is designed to look like a microbrew but is brewed by A-B. It pours very purple like a limbic or a fruit juice and is kind of acidic. It doesn't have much beer taste too it but more like a fruit juice. I can drink it but I'm disappointed."
"Sometimes you have to experience the really bad in order to appreciate the really good."
"This was my first blueberry lager. I swore that I liked the taste of blueberries but know I am not sure anymore. It smelled like a grape/blueberry juice (not beer). It Tasted exactly as it smelled and left a anasty tart after taste. The mouthfeel was that great, I think it was like drinking a sparkling wine. Drinkablitlity- Baqrely got through this thing."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"Wild Blue is an odd tasting brew, and it really belongs in the category of a wine/beer hybrid. This beer is far too sweet and too blueberry enhanced to take seriously as a malt beverage product. It's like an alcoholic grape soda and wine mixture. It might make a good addition as an ingredient in certain foods, liked cooked desserts. But it certainly tastes nothing like beer and it's a product to avoid."
"Drinks okay, but cloying sweetness makes this a one & done. The sweetness makes me think alco-pops not beer, still as good or better than sea dog's blueberry offering IMO. The look & taste of this makes it hard for me to believe this is derived from all natural flavors. I'm sure my wife will love this, I'd pick some up for her if no other beers of this ilk were on offer. my rating is much higher than the norm, but I call'em how I see them even if AB is trying to pull the wool over folks eyes. I've found more offenisive flavors in other AB beers un the mainstream, but it could just be me"
"This is a honest review but also a warning. I have had some great beer with fruit undertones and taste. This is not that type of beer."
"This is a ""malt beverage"" along the lines of smirnoff, etc. garbage. Gotta give AB credit for their marketing/presentation tactics...they got a couple of bucks from me. Won't happen again though"
"Next time I go to my local, I'll suggest this be near the malternatives. Amongst those, this is like a pop. I drank it, it wasn't bad, but I would never call this beer."
"Tasted on 5/22/08."
"Drinkability was surprisingly high, this is not to heavy, the booze is well hidden, and the blueberry flavor is strong and pure. The label says it's made with all natural ingredients, if that means just grain, sugar and berries, then I'm impressed. I recognize it's not for everyone, and really doesn't even taste like beer. But it's pretty clear from the label what your buying (aside from who makes it), and it far surpassed my expectations in that regard. I was surprised how I kept having to bump up the scores. Still, at the end of the day, this isn't my style, and I'll probably never bother having it again. Quite the panty dropper for the sorostitues I'm sure!"
"My score 4.0!"
"I dumped the rest of the beer out. Horrible horrible, the girl with us wouldn't try it because she smelled it and said it smelled like crotch."
"The brew presents as carbonated blueberry syrup from IHOP. There was little to no head. Aroma was overwhelmingly sweet and syrup like. The taste, thankfully, was not as syrupy, but there was still an overwhelming blueberry flavor along with a cidery undertone. While not cloying, the mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, which hurts drinkability."
"When I first poured this beer into a glass I thought I had somehow bought grape soda (but I can get past the look). The auroma is not too bad at all but I really don't know where they were going for on the flavor. Tastes more like a box of fruit juice than a beer. By far the worst blueberry beer I've ever encountered."
"I always hate giving beer a bad review, but jeez this isnt even beer. The beer pours a dark raspberry color, forming a 1/2 inch light raspberry colored head. Light hazy lacing. The aroma is all berry, and thats it. The taste is completely dominated by a syrupy berry flavor. This is exactly what St. Ides Berry flavor malt liqour tastes like. Light mouthfeel. Drinkability, its a struggle to get through one, so two is way out of the question. Overall, I bought this for my girlfriend, since she likes the fruit beers, but even she couldnt stand this. Avoid!!!"
"So they let me try one and I was shocked that this shit came out purple with no real carbonation. It's like grape juice. A blueberry smell is somewhat prevelant, but it is weak and a tad medicinal. Unfortunately, that is the best part. There is no blueberry flavor. In fact, this reminded me of some bad, cheap red wine I have had in the past. The ABV is extremely noticeable as it slightly burnt my tastebuds on the backend. It goes down watery and chunky, with a very sharp, astringent taste of faux fruit and alcohol. Not enjoyable at all and I couldn't finish the brew my buddy gave me, despite trying to be a nice guy."
"overall, this isnt a very good brew but i have had worse from this style and this brewer"
"Pours an interesting purple color, with little foam/lacing. Yes, it definitely has a blueberry aroma, but it's extraordinarily fake. Taste is super-sweet, like a winecooler. I get no indications of any beer qualities in this ""lager."" I dunno, it is what it is. I'm sure some women who claim to ""hate"" beer would enjoy this one. With high alcohol content, I think this one was brewed for the soul intention of shady college guys getting high school girls drunk."
"D - I feel bad for this one but I thought it was very wasy drinking and refreshing. I put a couple back which I often do not do. I may not order this often as it is not my ideal style but I did enjoy it. For 8% it is very easy to drink."
"Bottle: I had this at a beer tasting at a local large beer store. I sought this out, because I like this type of beer. The aroma is blueberries. VERY strong blueberries. The color definitely has a blueberry tint to it. The taste is blueberries. Not in a good way. It is a sickly sweet, syrupy blueberry taste. No subtlety to this at all. As with some of A-B's other offerings in the micro world, they are heavy handed and overdone. I'll stick with Sea Dog's version."
"D: I doesnt taste good at all but the alcohol I find to be well hidden. Surprised at that. Even so much that my wife asked me to get more- wouldnt have thought that given the booze."
"I was told there was a good new blueberry beer out in Texas: and indeed, there were two at the store, this one, and another that had a dog in a rain hat. I am assuming I picked the wrong one, because this is wretched."
"Had a single one of these floating in a tube down a river recently so I can't really account for its appearance but this stuff was pretty rank... Very phenolic almost pepto-like mouthfeel and taste, chalky, medicine, artificial blueberry and alcohol... didn't taste anything like beer or fruit beer. Don't waste your time or money on it."
"Light/medium bodied, easily drinkable if you keep it cold and like blueberry. This really comes across more as a blueberry malt liquor or wine cooler than as a beer, but in that light, it's not bad at all. If you like blueberry koolaid with a little more kick, give it a try."
"Too sweet for me - brewed from juice, not extract. Won't be having this again."
"Pour a purpleish burgund with rose highlights. Good bubbling and a light film of foam at the top of the beer. Doesn't look like a beer at first glance color wise, but I do recall lots of other great fruit beers having very thick, deep colors. The aroma is a strong blueberry with hints of grapes and prunes and just a touch of corn mixed ith cheap alcohol. Very juicey from th first sip, blueberries, blackberries,and some grapes. Juicey, fruity, but the alcohol is well hidden. Not what I expected, but you can't let this beer get warm at all. The boozy taste gets a bit overpowering. Very fruity, a bit adjuncty, and does not get better as it warms."
"Appearance has a reddish blueberry hue with a simple blueberry foam head that dissapates quickly. Smell has not much, just a little fruity blueberry aroma to it. Taste has a sharp artificial fruit (blueberry I quess) flavor followed by a acidic bitterness. Mouthfeel is light - medium with a good bite of carbonation. Talked up a lot by co-workers, but I just don't taste what they see in it."
"D - Bad, my wife really likes it though."
"Mouthfeel was not great, but not awful--not horribly acidic like a lot of fruit beers. This is simply not a very drinkable beer. In fact, I'm not convinced this is beer and would classify it as a malternative with a little beer in it. This has to be a blueberry version of Hooch with some Bud Light in it, right? Is somebody joking with this?"
"Drinkability: Not the slightest bit enjoyable."
"Overall this is a fine beer. If you're a fan of fruit beers I'd say this is worth checking out. I don't know why everyone else seems to hate it."
"Simply the worst beer I think I have ever had. Poured a bright, unnatural blue-pink color with a big, fizzy head that quickly disappeared. Smell was nothing big sweet, processed, sugary blueberry. I was not looking forward to the taste, and my hunch was right. The taste was nothing but syrupy blueberries, so sweet that it actually stung. The mouthfeel was incredibly fizzy. I've had some bad beers in my day, but I couldn't finish more then 4 sips of this one. It was more like a novelty soda gone bad than a beer. It's beers like this that give other fruit beers a bad, bad name. Stay away!"
"just plain awful not beer at all, avoid this at all costs."
"Don't bother. This isn't beer."
"I'm off to dump this one."
"If I had noticed this was a Busch product I probably would have steered clear, but I didn't and had the unfortunate experience of drinking this beer. In the glass it looks exactly like red wine, and smells like blueberry syrup. It hits your tongue with a nauseating, overpowering faux blueberry taste - with no beer flavor at all. If I didn't know this was beer, I would have mistaken it for blueberry punch. Also it's sweeter than a soda. This is a wretched, vile beverage that you should avoid."
"This is not beer. Very disappointing. I actually poured the last half down the drain after my girlfriend and I struggled to drink the first half."
"D - Not for me. Chicks might dig this, but the high ABV could be a disaster for lightweight little girls (like my fiance) who feel crazy after one wine cooler. This stuff really shouldn't even be considered beer."
"Drinkability: Not altogether terrible, but certainly not for me. Like a blend of Hawaiian Punch and Wine Cooler plus 8% alcohol!"
"Pours out like a mix of grape and red Koolaid. Tiny head that leaves some spots of ""lace."" Has an odd artificial blueberry thing going on. I've had other blueberry beers and they actually smelled like real blueberries. Go figure. Not much else is going on. A little alcohol maybe. Wow, what a taste. Artificial sweetness and artificial fruit flavor (reminiscent of Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss) dominating with some rancid graininess underneath. Finish and aftertaste taste exactly like Dimetapp. Really disgusting. Also there's some booziness. Mouthfeel has the slick and thick feel of a malt liquor with a stickiness from the sweetness here. Terrible."
"D - I struggled to complete... Hopefully this doesn't sour me on other blueberry beers..."
"Pours very red light like a red wine with almost no head, with below average lacing. Below average carbonation with a sweet smell of Hawaiian Punch. Tastes bitter and sweet...but this stuff is awful. This is awful and tastes like fermented HI C. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid Avoid, Avoid Avoid, Avoid Avoid, Avoid!"
"Drinkable in a small quantity, but only just. I didn't find it awful like some BAs, but wasn't impressed, either. I'm actually more pissed about how it's marketed. Instead of stating it's from Anheiser-Busch (and I freely admit that, because A-B is my least favorite of the Big III, I might have passed on it), the label states it's brewed by ""Blue Dawg Brewing"" of Baldwinsville, NY. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Blue Moon still states it's brewed by Coors or Molsen-Coors. Having a seemingly new brewing company from NY on the label, with a picture on the label that , more than anything else, reminded me of Flying Dog, is a fairly disingenuous way to market beer, especially for a corporation that criticizes the way that micros and craft brewers label their contract-brewed beers."
"It pours a light cranberry color with a pink head. The aroma is strong and full of blueberries and some malt notes. Its flavor is overwhelmingly fake and sweet with blueberries adding some tartness. Hop and malt flavors are barely detected. The palate is medium bodied with a sticky texture and the carbonation is fizzy."
"a - This poured a reddish blue color when I was dumping it down the drain. I should have looked first."
"I'm being honest here, this is the Mad Dog 20/20 or Erk-N-Jerk of beers. For the fruit juice drinker, not the beer drinker, who just wants to get loaded."
"All in all, a big disappointment. I'd be all for drinking an AB beer (which I didn't know it was, until I logged on BA) if it was a good one, but that being said, this isn't. I was hoping for an inventive, blueberry-tinged hellesbock, from what appeared to be a small brewery. Instead, I got artificial-flavor jacked malt liquor. Blech. What a disaster."
"Drinkability not as horrible as I was anticipating, on the same level as any of the sweet Lambics out there I actually enjoyed it, hell much better than most of the latest AB attempts to brew outside the box. Really dose cross the line out of the beer world and into the malt beverage realm for me."
"This is like the ghetto version of a lindeman's in my opinion. At least a lindeman's was a lambic before they juiced it up. I am not sure this was ever more than a Budweiser rice lager with blueberry puree and corn syrup."
"Pours purple with a decent fizzy pink head. Mild sweet grape aroma. Taste is very sweet. Blueberries and grapes. Not a very deep flavor profile. Definitely does not taste like beer but this is a fruit beer after all. Almost syrupy mouthfeel. Gets old quickly. However I don't think this is all that bad for a fruit beer. I've had other attempts at blueberry beers, raspberry beers etc, and they either end up watery and tasteless or are a beer with a just a hint of fruit or whatever. At least this one goes all the way... and becomes basically an alcoholic blueberry pop. If this had a bit more of a true blueberry flavor and wasn't so over the top with its sweetness it would probably be quite tasty."
"Wanted to give this a shot, bought this for my girlfriend and the both of us came up with one conclusion it is god awful. Pours out a purple grape soda color actually thats what it tastes like grape soda only worse. By far one of the worst beers I've ever had. Pour it down the toilet cause thats where it belongs."
"The bottle says Brewed by Blue Dawg Brewing in Baldwinsville, NY, near Syracuse. I figured I'd give a local place a chance. Its not a horrible beer but tastes like a can of the blueberries from boxed muffin mix. The high carbonation is a welcome surprise and actually makes the beer more tolerable. It wont be high on my list but I'd have it again."
"The reviewer that called it grape soda was dead-on - it's basically the beer equivalent of Cisco Wine - the taste is all Kool-Aid, no booze. It was hidden in with the microbrews and, knowing that it could be an Anheiser-Busch plant I checked it real carefully to make sure it wasn't - it doesn't say it anywhere on the bottle. Clearly I was mistaken. But, while strong, it is terrible candy-flavored (high fructose corn-syruped?) beer that will probably get you drunk, but it's more of a wine cooler than a beer. Avoid, I would suggest - easily the worst beer I've purchased in years."
"I hate to review a beer like this, but...it just bore so little resemblance to such a well respected beverage that I couldn't bring myself to say anything good about it."
"D - I finished it, but that's probably the best thing I can say for its drinkability."
"I am not surprised the outcome of this Anheuser-Busch product. The only thing it has going for it is the high alcohol content so you really have to chug it quick to get past the taste and get drunk. Poured a surprising dark fuschia color with a tiny little purple head. Smells of very very faint blueberries but you need your nose practically in the glass to detect them. Has an abysmal taste of watered down sour blue berries. Almost like an iced cold, very bad tasting merlot."
"If pouring syrupy blueberry juice into a macro-ish beer with pumped up alcohol is your thing, go for it. As for me - I'm glad that I only grabbed a single, and I won't be returning to this one."
"The beer pours a dark purple color with a thick fizzy purple head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. There isn't a lot going on here. It's extremely dry with a mild blueberry scent. The taste is average as well. I've gotta give it up to AB on this one. They have got some serious balls to put this on the market. What the hell am I drinking? The blueberry taste is there; uncompromised. They even kicked up the abv., 8%. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a first for me. Blueberry Lager? It's even blue. If this were my homebrew club, I'd be impressed, but this is the so-called King of Beers. What a joke."
"Wild Blue (Blueberry Lager) pours a purple color with a thin purple head. Smells like hi-c. The flavor is a flat out disaster. It tastes nothing like beer, and not really like a wine cooler or typical malternative either. There is some vaguely fruit like flavor, but it doesn't taste like blueberry. Blech. Drain pour."
"This was my first ""random"" six pack purchase in quite a while, and my next buy will either be a regular or I will go to a store with a beer connoisseur before I make the same mistake again."
"Is this a new flavor of Maddog 20/20? I didn't notice that this was an Anheuser-Busch offering until I took my first sip. Simply strong, dirty Budweiser with a indistinguishable cheap fruit syrup. I was intrigued by an 8% alcohol lager with fruit hints, so I tried it out. I was absolutely repulsed by what I ended up with. This crap basically ruined my night."
"This beer pours a plum color. The head is one inch in height, pink in color, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of artificial blueberries. The taste is a combination of blueberries and bile. This is the most offensive tasting beer I have ever had. The mouthfeel is over carbonated and watery. Overall, this is one of the worst beers I have ever had."
"It wasn't as rancid as I was expecting. Actually, the blueberry flavoring helped out a lot, but still way too boozy. Still, it's hard to believe this isn't a Sparks alcoholic energy drink."
"M&D: Mouthfeel? Basically just like soda pop or a wine cooler. Beer is definitely not the first thing that comes to mind when drinking this. Oddly, this was relatively easy to drink if you can get past the sweet juiciness. I'm probably going out on a limb here but I think this brew was at least an interesting departure from the norm."
"No I do not want to drink any more of this. I suppose this could be a decent choice for an alternative to juice at breakfast, but unless you're used to wine cooler and are looking for something stronger, avoid this beer!"
"Pours a dark blueberry stain color with soapy pink head. Out of the bottle smelled like blueberry muffins, but once in the glass smelled alcoholic, medicinal, and like a powdered drink mix. Taste: high fructose corn syrup, artificial blueberry flavoring, funky malt liquor aftertaste. This is truly horrible, going down the drain. Definitely blueberries in here somewhere, but wow, not in a good way."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark purple color with a thin and fizzy light purple head that quickly disappears. This looks more like a glass of grape juice than beer. The aroma is all blueberries and maybe a little grape. The taste is well... not very good to put it lightly. It is overly sweet with an artificial tasting blueberry/grape flavor that is on top of a cheap tasting malt liquor. The mouthfeel is prickly from the high carbonation, much like a glass of sparkling grape juice. Overall, I am going to stay far away from this beer in the future."
"Totally unenjoyable. I hope it dies a quick, painful death."
"Pours like cranberry juice with a bright pink head. Pretty strange looking, and artificial. Smell is metallic blueberries. Taste is sweet corn like maltiness mixed with blueberry syrup. Slight touch of alcohol coming through in the flavor. Medium bodied from the syrupy nature of it. Very sweet and artificial but with some beer maltiness in there too. Hmm... More like a mixed drink than a fruit beer. Not very subtle, but hell, it one of them is drinkable, I guess."
"Pours a crisp grape purple with a fuchsia colored head. This is beer, right? Aroma was some faint blueberry juice. The taste was reminiscent of a cross between a spoiled wine cooler and sparkling grape juice. The beer is very carbonated with present alcohol that lingers along with the fruit in the finish. I have to say, having never heard of this beer, it intrigued me enough to buy a single bottle, and I have to say, I'm glad that's all I wasted my money on."
"The teenages are gonna love this stuff - especially at 8% ABV!"
"D- I will never drink this one again. I may have to throw away the pint glass I drank it from so it's remnants don't taint any other beer"
"Feels and tastes a lot like a wine cooler. Artificial blueberry booziness. Cloyingly sweet. Not much more to say about this."
"I bought a sixer of this, somewhat excited, but that soon died down once I poured it into a glass ... pours a dirty dark purple colour ... some lacing, and very little foam ... smell is of 5 day old berries with slight rot ... taste seems a bit tacky, like a lighter version of Night Train (see: bumwine) ... hides the alcohol fairly well but i don't think i smiled once drinking this.. another effort by Bud to craft brew (1 thumb up on that note), but about as exciting as a baseball game (ya, baseball sucks!)"
"Buyer beware."
"poured a dark ruby in color with a quarter inch purple head that settled to a ring on the glass with no lace. smell was pleasant with blueberry pie aromas. taste is super sweet blueberry malt and slightly alcohol with some rough edges to it. medium mouthfeel and carbonation is ok. good as a one bottle desert beer only."
"D - It is a strong fruit lager that borders on malt liquor/cooler. A taste that really is not very interesting or rewarding. The alcohol is not noticeable until it warms, but it really isn't worth trying again IMO."
"Verdict: Awful. I've had plenty of fruit beers but this one is the absolute worst I've ever had. I have to agree with other reviews. The blueberry begins and never ends. There's no actual beer taste. I don't think I can finish a glass of this."
"Not the worst flavored beer I have had but I do not suggest going back for seconds."
"Drinkablity: Fairly tasty beer. Different and not as obnoxious as many brews infused with fruit and vegetables."
"D: If i wanted to get absolutely bombed, and not mind the sugar hangover...maybe i could drink a few of these, but really, no. This is nasty. If my girlfriend doesn't like it, I'll cook with it. It seems like it'd be alright in pancakes."
"Note: I was really upset when I had this and I feel I just acted too impulsive when I purchased it. I usually snap a pic with the phone and check it out on the site. We live and learn. I feel as if it is still slithering down my throat like some slimy creature."
"This has no business being called a beer."
"Another reviewer has it right -- this beer is much more akin to a wine cooler than a beer. Syrupy sweet with more candy-grape flavor than blueberry. Fizzy soda-like appearance and texutre. No obvious malt character at all-- all sugar. Not a hop character in sight. Artificial fruitiness and flavor and not much else. Everything about this beer screams advertisement to an under-21 audience, right down to the cartoonish logo and junior-high wording on the package. This is Kool Aid at 8%."
"Definitely avoid..."
"As soon as I popped the cap off, I smelled something sweet. A hard pour got me a inch head that was pink in color. The beer was a bright rose color. The smell reminded me of grape juice. The head vanished fairly quickly. I then tasted it. My friend's description of soda pop can to mind very quickly. If someone had given me this beer in a blind folded taste test with no information about it, I would have never had known that it was a beer, let alone blueberry. The grape taste is overpowering. I usually can finish even a beer that does'nt work for me but this beer is putting that practice to the test. A disgusting sugery drink. This is not for beer drinkers. This is for those who drink flavored malt beverages. Reminds be of tasting samples of Zima at Coors (but a lot, lot sweeter)."
"D: What's less than zero?"
"I didn't know this was A-B when I picked up a single. Not terrible, but not something I plan on having again. Maybe I should try a Leinie's Berry Weiss to compare."
"Overall this is a wasted effort by AB. They have had some decent beers outside of the light lager line but this is not one of them!"
"Whoah man - it poured out all magenta and purply with a lavender head. Even the girls in the room went, ""eewww!"" Nose of grape juice and hint of blueberry. The flavor was pretty much grape juice - not blueberry, and it had a sourness that blueberries do have, but seemed to be more in tune with the artificial flavor taste. Medium body and it looked purty as I dumped it down the sink."
"Overall, as a beer it sucks because there is no characteristics in it that gives it a beer flavor. If i didn't buy it, I would have thought it was some new bad malternative, or some weird bar drink. But as a drink itself, it is ok (though this is coming from a guy that drinks tilts from time to time). I would not want to drink this more than once at a time, but i can down it pretty well, and the sweetness is tricking me into thinking i am enjoying some fruit juice."
"Pours a clear beet red/blueberry color that has a large purple/red head. The head lasts and leaves good lacing,but this really looks ""fake"" with artificial fruit juices and color. The smell is weak with a veggie and blueberry scent. The taste is pretty brutal. It doesn't take a genius too realize they just added blueberry juice to a high alcohol beer. Even the high alcohol is hidden by the strong fruit flavors. The m/f is medium with the flavors not mixing well. I would rather have a Bud than have one of these again."
"I didn't realize Anheuser-Busch until after I had one. It pours a purple, red, blue-ish color with a thin but tall pink head that has little lacing. It smells strongly of blueberry pie, not much more. The taste is a huge blueberry pie filling flavor, nothing else can be detected. The mouthfeel is good with alot of carbonation. The drinkability is good because of it's sweet flavor. It reminds me more of carbonated blueberry juice and less like a beer but it was still interesting to try. I can see this becoming a hit in the mainstream beer market because of how sweet it is."
"I am very disappointed in this beer and will not be ordering any for our store- I just couldn't actually sell this to customers with a clear conscience (or even give it away). Kind of disappointing that they used Hallertau hops for this, they should have used their hops for other, more effective projects."
"D: I would rather drink rubbing alcohol than this. I also agree that AB is pulling some shenanigans for not putting their name on their product and fronting that this is a micro. This is the worst beer I have ever had...ever. Do not even look at this beer on the shelf or risk your eyes falling out."
"Well, That explains the one Busch Lite bottle cap among my six-pack! At first I thought; ""Did someone open a bottle, pour toxic substances in, and then re-cap the bottle with a Busch Lite cap. Weel, now that I know it's an AB cheapshot, trying to masquerade as an actual lager, I now know that I willnot die from drinking it. Although I might just commit suicide because an AB product has penetrated my body!"
"In a nutshell, It's horrible. I'd rather stay sober than drink this crap!"
"I won't bother with a full review on this one, as it doesn't seem worth the effort. Suffice it to say, if I was back in high school, and looking to get drunk - this would be great. Tastes like alcoholic kool aid. All fruit, no beer. Definitely the Boones Farm of beer. I also think its pretty shady of AB to try and pass this off as a completely unrelated brewery."
"This is, without a doubt, one of the most disgusting beers I've had in a long time. Pours the color of a fruit drink: a purple somewhere between pink and burgundy. Just a collar for a head. The nose is overpoweringly sweet, with an aroma that's a blend of fake grape and fake blueberry -- this smells like artificially created candies and such that have ""blueberry"" flavor. No actual blueberries smell like this. On the palate, sickeningly sweet (is that aspartame?), with a consistency and pungency that reminds of cough syrup rather than beer. The beer dries out just a bit toward the finish, and that's a good thing -- the fewer the flavors from this lingering on your tongue, the better. Overall, I can't say enough bad things about this beer. Avoid this at all costs. Why, AB, why? You can do better than this!"
"D - Way too winecooler-ish for me. Doesn't taste like beer much at all. Definitely a ""girl who doesn't like beer"" type of beer. Good flavor, but too much sweet for me."
"Now the question is, who can I foist the other 5 off to??"
"Poured into a snifter. It pours a rich purple/blue/red, and I immediately get scared. It has a lighter purple head that lowers ever so quickly. Aromas are of blueberry and grainy alcohol. Taste is terrible, blueberries up front with a high alcohol finish. I can't even finish this beer, it is that bad. But, then again not much from A-B can I finish. Mouthfeel is just weird, very syrupy, and it almost feels like a wine cooler that I stole from my mom when I was 15. Will I drink it again....not even on Fear Factor!"
"No other words for this other than, ""Never again"""
"Just when you think AB may be trying to make better beer, they come up with this shit."
"Like drinking bubbley syrup. Put some vodka with blueberry juice concentrate and a dash of bud light and you've just made this beer for yourself. Avoid at all costs."
"D - Nil. 0. Sorry, think positive, no one has an agenda here. It has a decent fruit quality that may really appeal to people who aren't into beer. There, that was nice. Now, for beer lovers, stay far far away from this wretched blasphemy. Far far away..."
"pours a light ruby color with little head, smells like kool-aid, mixed with alcohol. it doesn't look terrible or smell terrible. the taste is less than average.. i've hard worse but this isn't good. i dont like fruit beers, and this one isn't impressive, i guess if you like fruit beers you might like this"
"This is a sparkling grape juice in a beer bottle. It is deep red, almost purple. Smell is of blueberries and grape juice. Tastes like grape juice. Carbonation way too high. Just a bad ""beer."" The only good thing about this is it does pack a punch with the 8% ABV and it is hidden very well. But when it all comes down to it, this tastes nothing like a beer."
"D: Well, I'm not even sure you can call this beer. Not really. It's like a fruity malternative on steroids... the beer equivalent of Boone's Farm. Drinkable? Well, yes, but why not just add some grain alcohol to fruit juice?"
"Probably what the french give their kids as an alternative to Rosé to get them to take a nap after lunch."
"This is nasty. No beer here to report."
"Wouldn't you think that the owners of a fine premium beer would be proud of who they are, the name of their brewery, and maybe a logo? I guess not if you're Anheuser-Busch pretending you're a micro brewery. Shameful."
"This is simply a Malt Liquor merged with a concentrate blueberry juice based soft drink. Nothing more."
"Poured out into a pint glass, beer was a deep red color with little head and lacing. Smell is strong of blueberries and malt. The taste is pleasently sweet, with very little hops. The beer has a relativly high alcohol content, which is not noticable due to the sweet blueberry taste. Almost reminds me of a wine in consistancy, but obviously carbinated. The overall drinkability would be higher if the beer was better balanced on the hops side. This beer is an excellent taster, but I don't think I could drink a whole lot of them in one night."
"Although I was sharing a 12 pack provided by the brewmaster, I chose not to question him about this fruit beer instead asking about 3 other craft brews - a blonde, Brewmasters ""dopplebock"" and my favorite their soon to be released porter."
"D- This beer has big fruit flavors but needs some malt or something to give it a balance."
"Wild Blue is both wild and blue, so I have to give Blue Dawg Brewing (a small, hardworking brewery in upstate New York that is dedicated to earning your business!) props for truth in advertising. That's where the credit giving ends though. This is an abomination of a fruit beer that had no business seeing the light of day. How can so many master brewers be so wrong, so often, about so much?"
"Pours the most ridiculous cranberry-juice-fuscia with an even-more ridiculous cotton-candy pink head...3.5 just for its Willy Wonka-like surrealism. Nose is very similar to Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss - supersweet blueberry/raspberry and some weak, musty malt. Taste is unbelievably sweet artificial berry flavoring, a funky malt backing and stomach-burning alcohol. Mouthfeel is somehow slimy and thin at the same time. This is a foul, foul brew. I can see high school girls getting their older sisters to buy them this shit so they can pound it at house parties to get drunk. Give me a Smirnoff Ice over this anyday. Shame on you A-B. Is this really the best you can do?"
"Wild Blue? Then why is it red? Pours out to a reddish color that is similar to Robitussin. Head looks like berry spit. Aroma of light malt, and the vision of a raspberry soaked in vodka come to mind. Taste is rough... booze, berries, and some maltiness blend poorly. Ugh. Mouthfeel is unimpressive, and slightly dense. Drinkability is not that good. Wrap this one up AB, and go back to the drawing board. Skip it."
"Verdict: My first-ever beer with ones across the board. This is a terrible, irredeemable mess of a ""beer."" The brewmaster who conceived of this filth should be ashamed of himself. A definite drain pour."
"HOOCH!"
"I received this for free and I thought it was quite good. Not like a normal lager and the feel of the beer was a lot like soda. It had an immediate beer taste to it then you can taste the blueberry which in my opinion tasted a lot like a bacardi drink."
"As I drank it, I could feel the carbonation swirling in my mouth. At first I didn't mind the taste, but bear in mind that this was a four-ounze sample and about half-way through I felt overwhelmed by the sweetness. It was dificult finishing the small sample. Really, this reminded me more of a wine cooler than a beer. If that's what you're looking for - a sweet, very fruity, overwhelmingly blueberryish beer that goes down like juice, then this is for you. If this doesn't sound like your taste, I would recommend trying something else!"
"Body's the best part, lightish, smooth, slightly frothy but delicate carbonation."
"No doubt an after dinner beer."
"Got a bottle of this beer for free so I figured I might as well try it and see. I guess my West Michigan is a test market for this beer and its being advertised everywhere. This is simply a terrible beer. Pours a syrup dark blue color with basically no head and no sign of carbonation. Aroma is weak but definitely of a fake blueberry substance. Taste really is bad. It is cloying upon entering the mouth. Just so syruppy, so fake, so sweet its disgusting. And I usually don't mind sweeter beers that much. This was horrible. I sat there trying to drink it and really couldn't. I think I drank about half before I called it quits. Do not get, I don't think even the malternative lovers would like this stuff."
