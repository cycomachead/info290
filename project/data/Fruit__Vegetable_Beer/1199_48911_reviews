"Love this. It somehow manages to avoid all cough syrup flavors and it ages quite well into a nice sour."

"The pour is a dark blood red with a head that has a pink hue. Nose is cherries, green vegetables, and stale cereal. Taste is a bit stronger cherry, gets a touch medicinal. Finish is slightly tart, a big syrupy body and moderate carbonation. Not the best fruited beer."

"Very very easy to drink. I could knock down several Founder's Cerise and not think twice about it. It is one of my most refreshing beers to drink during the summer. I can't wait for Founder's to make Cerise once again."

"Medium bodied at best with a tingly effervescence, much like a lambic which is my best guess as to what they were aiming for. I like lambics, but I'm glad I only have two of these to drink. The overly artificial flavor/nose is depressing. Being from Michigan myself and aware of the heritage of cherry growing in the state, I really wanted to like this a lot but I can't honestly say I do. Finally a Founders beer I don't want more of."

"For a Fruit Beer, this is good. At the end of the day, it is still a fruit beer. It has a red hue to it and it tastes like cherries. If you want a beer, look for something else. If you love cherries, then you will love this. I'd definitely get it again, but I would have to be in the right mood (and also I would have to make sure that none of my friends would see me drinking it)."
""
""
"The Founders Cerise from Founders Brewing Company is a great beer. The appearance is both red and murky. The aroma or flavor of the beer has strong notes of cherry which is obvious when looking at the name. The mouthfeel was very light and refreshing. The taste was light, bubbly fruity and sweet. I would strongly recommend this beer to non-beer drinkers as a great place to start."

"O - Overall not a bad beer, but a bit too much like a cherry soda. Needs less carbonation and the sourness is a little overpowering in the end. Not on the top of the list for fruit beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Tasty, but not something I'd get again. There's other cherry brews out there that offer more of a diverse palate than this one. Though to their credit, I don't think I've drank a faster 6.5% bottle of beer before."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this beer a lot.I wish I had more."
""
""
""
""
"Deep pinkish red, transient white head with a ring of retention, no lacing. Nose has cherry/raspberry, light cracker and some yeast character. Taste has some sweeter cherry pie, raspberry and general berry notes. Some grainy notes, and a touch of bitterness. Medium body, and good carbonation. A passable fruit beer, but not something I'd actively search for."

"Poured a dark ruby red in color with fucia highlights and a thin bubbly pink head that barely left any lacing sticking to the glass. Big on the grains upfront on the nose with hints of cherry fruit, slight citrus and a little malty sweetness presence. Like the nose suggested it was filled with a variety of grains in the flavor alongside muted cherry fruit character, malty sweetness, hints of citrus and a touch of juice. The brew was light in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, grainy, slightly fruity and thin crisp finish. Just a decent fruit beer and nothing more."
"O - I won't miss this beer. Its a step up over the faux-fruit lambics, but at the end of the day its just a solid cherry ladened beverage. Bring on the Rubaeus!"
"Overall: Not overly impressed but it was worth a try. but probably the best cherry beer i have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely exceeded my expectations, I don't normally lean towards fruit beers sometimes because I think it takes the ""manliness"" away. This brew is feels like a belgian ale with the wrong label. Would I buy it again, of course though now that i found out that it's retired, would be a little harder. Salud!"
""
""
"O - Nice change from my usual dark ales. Not Blushing Monk quality, but a good beer. Similar, but better that a 'cooler.' Nothing bad to say. Worth a try for this style of beer."
"Overall not a horrible example of the style, and definitely one that would appeal to those who enjoy fruit / vegetable beers or lambics. I think I had higher expectations for this one simply because everything else I have ever had from this brewery has been so phenomenal, but this one is definitely still worth a try."
""
""
"O - Not the most fruity, sour, or malty beer on the planet, but for the style it is above average. Get it while you can!"
""
""
"O: For syrupy cherry beers, New Glarus' Wisconsin Belgian Red is better."
"Appearance is a reddish amber color; the smaller-than-average head is a light red color. The scent is weak malts, with not much discernible cherry. The cherry really comes through in the taste. It tastes almost like a cherry soda, but some light malts flavors are present. Slightly sweet, but not overly so like other fruit beers. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. Not bad at all, but not great either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: While this beer presents some authentic evidence of fruit that makes it worthy of consumption, it also has some detracting features. Flavors are a mixed bag of appealing and otherwise, coming across as just a little too dark and metallic. Thus, overall appeal is constrained."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for a cherry-flavored beer that has some substance to it."

"Overall - I'll tell you what - I Really Like This! There truly is a greaqt complexity and balance here - and the cherry truly tastes natural imho, not flavored or like candy at all. I eat cherries fairly often and that's what I traste - natural cherry. I get natural sweetness, and I also get that mouth-watering tartness that cherries have. I also get wheat beer characteristics, and just enough floral hop to really add an unexpected balance and depth. I think this is heads and shoulders above any wine cooler or flavored malt beverage - it'a cherry fermented ale, just like it says on the label. If you like cherries, I think you're going to LOVE this, and I like cherries ;o)"
""
""
""
"O - a nice light cherry beer, white a good touch of wheat. Doesn't touch the greatness of a new glarus fruit beer, but I would drink this one in the summer after cutting the lawn."
"Overall- This is a nice, refreshing beer from Founders, whom I think make great beers. Totally a summer beer, but I'm still enjoying it in November."
""
""
""
""
""
"An intriguing brew, but not well thought out. It's too light with no defining characteristics. It's relaxed and enjoyable, but not heavy or expansive. Not too recommended if your a lover of more tart fruit brews."

"O-not bad with some solid cherry flavor, but overall I guess I'm just not a big fan of cherry beers"
"I don't know why this beer is not good. Rübæus is great - pure, fresh, natural. Cerise should essentially be the same damn beer, only with cherries. Wrong. Something happened and the flavor/aroma is plagued with off-putting components like vitamins and chalk. One of Founders' weakest offerings. Just wait for Rübæus to be released."
""
""
"Pours a very cloudy red with just a hint of orange. Small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is a little it of alcohol at first, then followed by sweet, red cherries. Some berry-jam-like aromas, along with the smallest amount of tart aroma. Part of it smells like a White Zin...which I find strange. Taste is very fruity at first...with a somewhat off-putting metallic flavor. Slightly tart, but nothing along the lines of a sour beer. Much more sweet. Sweet cherries, with some other berry flavors. This is one damn tasty fruit beer. More cherries in the finish, with a slight, tingly-tart finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very nice carbonation for this style. Drinkability is high. Overall, fruit beers are not really my thing, so I am trying my best to rate this for what it is. Honestly though, I really enjoy it. I enjoy it a lot more than other fruit beers I have had. I would definitely drink this again."
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body with mid-level carbonation that creates an initially crisp, but then smooth (as the carbonation diminishes) mouthfeel. Closes dryly with some residual sweetness/stickiness around the mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An interesting beer. If you love cherries, this beer is for you! I don't think I will buy it again though, not my cup of beer"
"Overall: It definitely is what it says it is and doesnt hold back without being overdone although it approaches that line."
"D - Not bad, it is unusually drinkable for a non sour fruit beer."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a slightly hazy, deep, ruby coloring with no head whatsoever. Aromas of a slight roasting and a watered down, subtle cherry tartness. It almost smells like when you make Jell-O, and have to boil water and add it to the mix pack. That initial smell when the water hits the powder, only from a couple of rooms away...that's what this smells like. Flavors are rich and deeply sweet, with a solid cherry flavor, definitely more maracino than black. Only a subtle tartness in the palate, and the beer refrains from getting into the sugary or syrupy realm. This brew has legit fruit flavors. The beer is thin, and with a slight carbonation it has a very crisp feel in mouth. Sweet, moderate aftertaste that has an even fade as the palate clears. Extremely clean finish. This beer is completely different from what I was expecting. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"For someone who doesn't like cherries by themselves, I surprising enjoyed this beer. Solid offering from Founders."
""
""
"O- I like the taste of this, I just don't pick up any resemblance to beer. It's still one of the better fruit beers that I have had though."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm gonna state upfront that I hated this, but I try to review objectively and fairly. This beer poured up a bright ruby red with a small white head. The smell was mainly cherries. Mouthfeel was just about average with not a whole lot of carbonation. Taste - well - it didn't taste at all like beer to me. It tasted more like a cherry Sundrop or weak wine. But once you get used to the taste, it is drinkable. Not my favorite, as I stated upfront, but I think Founders succeeded in what they were trying to accomplish."
""
""
"I'm not a huge fruit beer fan. I thought this was a bit sweet at times. All things considered, it was a very tasty, drinkable beer. The cherries were forward and delicious. My only real complaint is that this beer is a bit thick. It comes across at times more like juice than beer. Nonetheless, it's worth a try especially if you're a cherry fan."

"A real unique fruit-based beer. Interesting flavors on their own, but not quite harmonious together. I really couldn't imagine having more than one."
""
""
"The beer pours like fruit punch, a beautiful cherry red with a slight browning towards the middle. The head is but a skim of white bubbles that leave sheets of lacing on the sides. Carbonation seems well accounted for by the bubbles running to the top, but overall the beer is too dark and cherry-murky to look through. The beer smells surprisingly more malty than anything else, there is a good bready-biscuity background to the beer and the sweet metallic tang of the cherries is definitely present, and some very subtle pear-like esters from the yeast. The beer tastes sour and mellow with a nice puckering sweet dancing bellow all else in the beer. The malt is present as a slight biscuity taste, and the pear esters are definitely present, but the cherries are the main event here and they play out nicely leaving a sour pang your mouth and little else. The cherries tart does have a slightly metallic tinge to it, like sucking down iron which detracts slightly from the beers drinkablility, though overall the beer is very nice to sip or chug. Mouthfeel is smooth and mellow with a slight thickness to the beer and a little carbonated prick, but overall very refreshing and mellow on the tongue. There is some slight saliva running in the tongue and a light puckering sour pang, but other than that the mouth is very clean. Overall this is a nice fruit beer. It is above average, but not by that much. I’ve had this on tap before and I felt like the malts and cherry played nicer there than they do when poured from a bottle. A great, slightly sour, fruit ale that is a nice to drink on a warm summer day. This won’t sweep you off your feet but its worthy of going back for a few more."
"Overall, a decent beer, but one I won't go out of my way for again. I may change my mind once I try to make a beer float out of it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great summer sipper beer. Tart, refreshing, smooth and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is up front sweet like cherries with the malt character coming on the back of the tonge. The sweetness stays the whole way through. The mouth feel is good, nice and smooth, carbonation is good. Overall a sweet and drinkable beer. I would want to session this but one once in a while for a change is good for me."
""
""
""
"I've tried this beer 3 or 4 times at this point and each time it lets me down. I had Rubaeus the last year it was around. That was a killer fruit beer. The flavors never really meld here. It's pale and fruity. I expect more from Founders."
""
"Overall – It is a refreshing and easy drinking beer and although a bit sweet, it is quite nice. If a fruit beer is something you are craving, then I say go for this one, as it is rather nice."
""
""
""
""
"overall refreshing and drinkable. Try it"
""
""
""
""
"O. Probably one of the better fruit beers I have had. Not super sweet or super sour. Could probably drink more than a few of these. Might be a good beer to mix with others. One I will seek out again to see what it does to a Stout."

"O- This was okay, but definitely a little bit disappointing for a Founders beer. Not too much aroma, a little bit artificial tasting, and fairly flat. That being said it was fairly easy to drink and it wasn't terrible (just had high expectations). I'd recommend trying it if you are a fruit beer fan, but probably stay away from it if you aren't."
"a decent summer brew, but i maybe expected more from founders. easy drinking."

"O-Easily the worst Founders beer I've had. You'd think they'd be able to make something better for the summer."
""
""
"O: well, I never had a cherry pie for a beer, but with the alcohol smell I can tell its a beer. Two more, I probably will be able to finish, but will probably not buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Possibly my least favorite Founders beer. Not to say that it isn't its own beast. It's a fruit beer with pie flavor. If you're a cherry pie fan, this is your speed."
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink but not really a flavor profile that is sessionable to me. I enjoyed this beer and would probably have another at some time in the future."
""
"o: This is good beer with a pleasing cherry flavor and tartness with just the right balance of sweetness. The cherry flavor is spot on but I would like a stronger cherry presence in the nose."
""
""
"O - I tend to enjoy fruit beers but this one really missed the mark for me. The flavor is weak and very one dimensional. It was hard to finish the bottle."
"Mouhfeel: Light & fizzy but this all works fine for this beer. Fruity. Good cherry flavor just a bit one dimensional. Would have liked to tasted more tartness. Probably wouldn't be able to drink too many of these either. I only bought one."
"O - A great cherry beer, but lacked the tartness and complexity I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing fo sho, but not the beer I'm wanting to settle down with."
""
""
"This is cherry pie in a glass."
"That said, the ridiculous strawberry donut flavor isn't *that* bad. Maybe I'm slightly more forgiving since I can still remember the similar (but several orders of magnitude worse) Ommegang Aphrodite. This beer is cloying and, to get right down to it, bad, but I can probably finish the glass. I like donuts every so often I guess."
""
""
""
""
""
"So who is this beer for? I dunno. Can't figure that market out. Its not a bad beer, but its far from even average in the Founders lineup."
"Pretty good cherry taste but the flavor overall is too weak. Still, doesn't come off as overly sweet or artificial like many fruit beers so that's a plus. I think Founders was going for an accessible change-up for their lineup, and it succeeds there, but not really up to par with their other work."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. The tartness and boldness of the cherry flavor is really nice. Very crisp and refreshing."
""
""
"I like this one a lot. It is a well made fruit beer that doesn't feel gimmicky or overly sweet. I'll definitely have this one again."
"This grew on me a bit."
""
""
""
"Probably the first beer from Founders that wasn't overly impressive. Having recently grabbed a bottle of Lindemans Kriek this one was not living up. While not a bad beer the dominating tartness is a little offputting and the sweetness doesn't get a chance to really show that its there."
""
""
""
""
"D - This is alright. It's a bit more balanced than most fruit beers, but the bitterness is a killer. I may have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An interesting cherry beer from Founders that manages to use the fruit without making it too sweet. I wish it were a bit more complex and that the nose was more present as I didn't smell too much on this one at all. It would be a good beer to introduce someone to fruit beers or Flanders Oud Bruin."
"O/D-I enjoyed this beer and I appreciate the effort put into making it. One single is enough for me but there is a truly authentic cherry flavor within this beer and I commend that. Far better than most fruity wheat beers, but no Lambic by any means. One of the prettiest beers."
""
"O- good fruit beer that has a slight berlineresque twist to it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, bottled on 5/24/12. Pours a candy apple red, with a half inch of bright white head, that leaves some lace. Smell is cherry and vanilla, not complaining. Taste is very cherry, but not over the top. Body is medium, plenty of life, not dry, and perfect on a hot day. This is a cherry beer and a very good one. Not for everyone, but Founders does it again."
""
"O: While I wouldn't pick this up all the time, it's a good example of the style and I enjoyed my glass. Certainly worth a try."
"O - I'm not sure if it is trying to be a fruit beer or a sour. It does have some nice sour qualities. I'm torn and shall rate it middle of the pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is full and sticky with soft carbonation. It really coats the pallet for sure. Overall this one isn't very good. I think it's just too sweet. I was hoping for something lighter and more refreshing. This seems to be more of a dessert."
""
""
"i really enjoyed this overall, but i feel like a 12oz bottle is too small of a size.. and the price is a bit steep for the 4 pack ($14???!). it's a good beer, and i will probably end up spending the money on the 4pack next time i see it on the shelf, but i don't think the majority of beer drinkers would spend so much on a fruit beer."
"Pours a brownish pink color with fluffy white head. Aroma of lightly tart cherries, sweet sugar, and definite malt presence. Flavor follows suit with the tart cherries highlighting the flavors, and a definite malt presence that I wasn't expecting. For some reason I thought this would be more like a NG fruit beer, but it comes closer to a SA Cherry Wheat (but of course blows it away). Light palate, strong carbonation, easy drinking. Too bad they stopped making this one."
""
"M - Thin-to-medium body. Very smooth and drinkable despite being so sweet. Surprisingly dry and clean in the finish. Great for the spring and summer time."
"Cerise pours a reddish color with a small pink lacy head. The smell has a dry malty undertone, like a pils, with strong sweet tarty cherry aroma. The taste has a mixture of sweet and, with a mellow cherry flavor ontop of a dry pilsner like flavor. Very easy to drink, the fruit isnt over powering, but present. Overall a very nice fruit beer, blended well and great in the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty good fruit beer. It’s tasty to be sure, but if the cherry were taken away, the base wheat beer would only be an average beer. The cherry certainly adds to the color, aroma, and taste, but it can only do so much with an average base beer. Still, it’s a pretty good beer, especially if you’re into fruit beers and/or cherries."
"One of the deepest fruit beers I've ever had. Insanely delicate, flavorful, and complicated. This is how fruit is supposed to be used. This is a beer with fruit added. Not a fruit beer."
""
""
"Starts off medicinal, then oddly boozy, finishing with artificial cherry flavors. Lingering bitterness feels out of place. This isn't bad, but it's pretty far from being good. A rare miss from the rock stars at Founders."
"O-not a bad beer, not anything too fancy or complex but tastes pretty good. Would have again on occasion."
""
""
"O- A decent fruit beer. Slightly tart, and it's a decent base beer with the right amount of fruit."
"O: Nice to try as an experiment, may have one now and then."
""
"Overall- I was not overly impressed nor tunred off by this beer. If you are looking for a generally fruity offering then this will suffice. However, don't think that just because there is a cherry on the bottle that that is what you are going to get."
"O: It's always good to have your expectations exceeded. There's enough of a non-cherry character to make it a worthwhile summer staple. Founders does it again? I think so."
""
""
"this is a weird one. pours majorly cloudy pink color, like pepto bismol almost. small lacey white head. not totally appetizing in appearance, but most certainly intriguing. smells like cherries and an overdoese of yeast. not a sour beer, but soe definite tartness going on. flavor isnt bad at all, lots of fresh cherries, which is the dominant flavor by far, but some interesting yeast character and a crisp finish. mouthfeel is weird, this is a heavy beer in a lighter genre, its almost too much to drink a glass of this, let alone several. good carbonation but kind of chalky. overall i am glad i tried this, but this assuredly isnt the brew that made founders famous. not bad, very out there."
""
"Overall, this beer is a disappointment. I can confidently say that this is the first time I've ever been disappointed by a Founders beer. Unfortunately, this is a drain pour, which is a first for Founders."
"Very drinkable. But not my bag. What to do with the other three?"
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll pass, but for those who like sweeter fruit beers, I could see the appeal for this one."
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable, super-cherry beer."
""
""
"O: A solid, straight on approach to a fruit beer. In this case, it works. Definitely not sickly sweet like some (Lindemans Kriek immediately comes to mind) and not too tart either. Try it out if you like cherries"
"O: a good beer if you like fruit beers or cherries, or both.... Give this a whirl."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a easy-drinking and somewhat refreshing cherry beer. I wish it were cheaper, as it is a nice summer heat beer, actually; I'd buy it more often."
""
"Overall good for the summer but not something I would want to drink all day. Even Founders struggles with this difficult style."
"o: not a fan. wish it was more tart than sweet and the metallic flavor was offputting."
""
""
""
""
"Founder's Brewing Company. Cerise. Pours a chalky, purple-red, cloudy ale with medium head and extensive linear lacing. Nose is undistinguished, faint, indistinct, maybe some fruit or some bready, maltiness. Taste is sweetish, but not cloying, fruit, but not super-fruit, with fine but not lambic-fine carbonation (I know, this isn't a lambic), but with some nice sourness in the mix. Bready, substantive, meal-like. Can't find a bitter note in the 15 IBU's either (I know, they aren't supposed to be there!). Some funky complexity and fun to try, although, if you want your fruit beer to be a lambic, then you'd better have a lambic, ya know? I liked this, however, to the end."
""
""
"O - A fine cherry beer to be concise but I must mention that this reminds me of the Blushing monk in many ways. That said, it reminds me of all the things that the Blushing Monk did better with raspberries. Ergo, worthy of having but not the best!"
"O: Really good for drinkability for a fruit beer. I can do a 12oz to myself fairly easily. Well made overall. It's pretty close up there with NG Belgium Red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as fruity beers go, this is one of the best. Sweetness is satisfying but not overdone. Just the right amount of tart character. Great balance as well. Not a style I will usually drink but exceptional for what it is."
""
""
"O: Not a bad fruit beer on a hot day. I prefer this to others I've had."

"Well done for a fruit beer. I have had some better though."
"Easy to drink and offers something different for the palate. Could be thicker but it's good otherwise."

"O: This is a different take on beer. Maybe cherry-barley wine might be a better description. Lambic drinkers and wine lovers will like this beer, or at least should give it a try. And everyone else might want to try it too, just to experince the broad range of things that can be called beer."

"O: For what it is, this is about as good as expected, but it's just not my thing. The cherries dominate, as of course they should in a cherry beer, but there's not much else to this beer."
"The beer pours a golden-orange color with a white head. The aroma has a ton of cherry syrup notes in it, as well as a hint of tartness. The flavor has a lot of tart cherries, as well as some syrupy sweetness. There is also a little bit of raspberry character and a hint of biscuit malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Poured from a bottle into an estrella chalice. This beer is very interesting. It has a beautiful pink tinted color to it and a very enticing cherry aroma. The taste is incredibly reminiscent of cherry pie. The Cherry flavor it gives off is akin to that of canned cherries, with its surgery sweetiness and tart almost sour finish. The malt in this beer gives it a nice grainy buttery feel which is really what wraps it all up to be like cherry pie. I have tried quite a few vegetable/fruit beers in my time, and I know many people including myself who don't normally enjoy them. However this is a beer that I would definitely recommend to all beer geeks, it is just executed so very well. The taste isn't nearly overwhelming like in many fruit flavored beers and I'm honestly quite confused as to why founders decided to put this beer in a 4pack rather than a 6 pack. The low alcohol content combined with the balanced and deliciously refreshing flavor would make this beer very sessionalbe to those people such as myself who enjoy it so much. Glad I picked this up."

"O- I like cherry beers, I particularly like ones that I don't have to worry to much about heartburn an hour later lol. This is good for what it is, an ale with cherries. Nothing fancy at all but well pulled off. The aroma is a little lacking but the taste takes the reins."
""

""
""
""

"O: Simple but tasty. Almost pure cherries, but not overpowering or syrupy/sickly sweet. Not like cherry soda either like a lot of fruit beers. I enjoyed it!"

"O: Not surprising for a brewery that brought Blushing Monk onto the scene: Cerise is rich, tart, and complex. I could see myself drinking this before dinner as an appetizer, during a big, meaty meal, or after dinner as a sweet dessert beer. Drinkable and highly versatile."
"$2 a single."

"Overall, a very different fruit brew. Very natural in fruit flavor, but also somewhat unbalanced. I'll try to have this again fresh so I can get the intended taste profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice one-off beer that could replace the standard mimosa and is clearly superior to wine coolers. However, this one is far to sweet for a second round."

"This is a relatively hard to get beer in CNY, but it's worth trying. For its price this is a sophisticated cherry beer that would impress both your lady and guy friends...However, it's definitely worth waiting until dessert (considering its sweetness)."
""
"Overall, it's all about the sweet cherries. Too sweet and one-dimensional for me. A poor man's New Glarus Belgian Red."
""
""
""

"Overall, for a fruity beer, very well done. Easily drinkable, fruity but very good balance. Not incredible, but pretty good, might be priced a bit high. "

"O: I had to pour this out. It was just horribly unenjoyable. Then again this bottle has been light-struck on a sales floor for 1.5 years. I would love to try a fresh example of this beer because I do thoroughly enjoy fruit beers, lambics, and sours."

"Overall: An unusually 'OK' offering from Founders. Not really worth the price hike of a 4-pack."
"O: I liked the tartness to finish the beer, but the overall heavy sweetness was too much for me."
""
""
""
"Cost: $3.19 for a single, $10.99 for a four pack."
""

"O-this is a great fruit beer. Look out Abita strawberry, because the sour notes of this bring a domestic beer even closer to that elusive and expensive lambic. Good for you Founders!"

""

""

""

"O: This smells way more intense than the taste would have you believe. The taste is good, though a bit sour for my liking. It's definitely mellow though and not to be confused with a sour. I would like to try this again fresh, though I wouldn't seek it out."
"super sweet beer, tons of cherry all over th place. i shared a few with some friends, and all the girls liked it, and the guys weren't too keen. tastes like a beer wine cooler. not on my top list to try again but if you are trying to get your gf something, give it a shot"

"Overall - Nothing terribly impressive. A simple, sustained cherry flavor. Not my favorite style, so I wouldn't seek it out again, but I wouldn't turn my nose up to it either."
""
""
""
""
"O - As others have noted, I felt this was slightly one dimensional. It's an easy drinking fruit beer that doesn't have the fake or overdone fruit flavors that many do."

"Having tried a few cherry ales, this is one of the weaker I've had. The fruit taste is almost non-existent, dominated instead by tart. I'm already not the biggest fan of this style; but if i had to have one, it wouldn't be this one."
"I'm surprised I haven't had this before, but Cerise is pretty tasty. It's like Wisconsin Belgian Red-lite. It's glowing orange, hazy amber with almost no head. The beer smells clove-y and spicy with a lot of yeast character and a little bit of bruised cherries. The beer is malt-forward with a slightly tart, bing cherry flavor that permeates throughout the finish is a little sweet with a fruitiness that lasts. It tastes much better than it could've been and I really enjoyed having as a before bed treat. It's sometimes tough to find just the right beer to end the night. This was a pretty good choice, I'll definitely be seeking this out again."
"pinkish red. what little head that appears dissipates quickly. aroma is mild, but pleasant. soft cherries. nice citrusy notes. very pleasant taste. mild cherry flavor. tart. maybe some grapefruit. little hops. great carbonation. incredibly refreshing to drink. i could drink this all day"
"Drink- A good fruit beer. A bit thick but still well balanced and tasteful. I've been happy with all the Founders I have tried."
"Light red-orange with no head or lace. Clear. Aroma is grain and cherries, though not overpowering. Light hopping with most of the flavor coming from the grains with noticeable cherry in background. Very distinct cherry flavor, different from other similar brews, possibly because of the lower than expected acidity. Light body and high carbonation."
"O – Not overly sweet. I think a little age did this beer well."
"O- If you love cherries this would be your beer. A bit one dimensional but I wouldn't expect more from these beers. Probably on the bottom end of what Founders makes. Even so, being made by founders makes it not a horrible brew."
"Overall, I came into this thinking that it could be the one brew from Founders that I wouldn't love, and while that ended up being true, I still liked it, but there are other fruity offerings out there that I think are volumes above. I think anybody looking for a fruity brew would get their fix from this though."
"O: Not bad for a Fruit beer, but nothing great."
"Overall, a unique combination of sweet and tart that is sugary, but never cloying."
"Founders Cerise was on tap at out local watering hole. The beer came in a pint glass. The color was a ruby red with decent white head that did not lace....I have noticed fruity/sweeter beers do not lace. The smell....HELLO....cherry malt. The taste to me was like a grenadine infusion that really made the beer like JCM song title....""Cherry Bomb"". The sweetness and overpowering cherry flavor made the mouthfeel a bit tricky....I drank half then switched it with someone else. Overall a great beer that hit its mark."
"Pours what I can only describe as a fizzy gold with ever slight pinkish hue. Lots of carbonation but little head. Smells faintly of cherries, hops is present in the scent. Not sweet. Taste is super cherries and super tart, puckering, and dry. Sweetens as it warms. Mouthfeel is dry and tart. Overall, enjoyable cherry ale."
"It is very fruity. Cherry, flavored, to be precise. This nearly overpowers all semblance of an ale. Nearly. But it's still ale, and not without merit. It's just a bit too fruity and sweet (and tart). I would recommend fans of the genr to try this one. It's way fruitier than most. I will try to stay away in the future (what was I thinking?)."
"I really wasn't sure what to expected with this one. Fermented fruits can work well in beer, but often they come up short. This is far from a sour, but certainly a nice tart flavor. Highly recommend giving this one a shot."
"O: Sort of like the New Glarus fruit beers in the sense that it's sweet and overly fruity, but it's got a nice flavor."
"O: This beer goes down extremely quickly and easily. This is becoming a staple in my fridge and I turn to it often."
"The smell of this beer is just awesome...probably the best aspect, can't stop smelling it!"
"I am continuing with my mini quest to try the rest of available Founders beers here in Cleveland that I have had not had yet. I poured the 12oz bottle into a pint glass to find a nice reddish orange body with a small white head. The aroma was sweet with a few hints of cherry, malt , and a bit of sourness. The taste was good, the cherry flavor was not as strong as I expected but the cherry flavor was done just right. There is a nice balance of tartness, sweetness and some funk. This wasn't very complex and was a pretty straight forward beer. There was a decent amount of carbonation for this medium bodied beer that also left a bit of cherry aftertaste. Overall a good summer beer from Founders, I enjoy the occasional fruit beer but at the same time I would probably pick up a few others before this one."
"Overall – The flavour wasn't too over the top, so it was drinkable.. but not something that I would want more than 1 bottle of. Happy I gave it a shot, but wouldn't buy it again."
"Overall: I like how weird this beer is. It completely reminds me of pink champagne in just about every way. If you're into that, then you will like this beer too."
"O: kind of a disappointment, but not bad. I would not buy this again, though."
"Overall: I'd recommend Cerise for someone who loves cherry flavor, but is not into ultra-tart krieks. This one might be too sweet for some, but I say it's just right. It manages to stay just this side of cloying. I could see vanilla notes working extremely well in a barrel-aged version of this!"

"""B+"""
"Pours a hazy light red with a 1 inch fizzy off-white head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of malt and some fruity cherry aromas. Taste is of malt and sour cherry flavors. There is a sour/acidic quality that lingers on the back of the tongue after each sip. There is a high level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good fruit beer with a nice sour cherry flavor. A good refreshment for the hot summer months."
"Pours a medium reddish amber with some white fizz which mostly dissipates within a few minutes to a ring. No lacing. Smells like tart cherry, melon, pale malt, whiff of roastiness. Pretty restrained. Taste is a sweet cherry, some malt, not a whole lot else. Lightly carbonated on a medium body; well done. Overall, this is a refreshing, tasty cherry beer, kind of like a mellower version of Wisconsin Belgian Red. I can see being put off by the sweetness or prominence of the cherry flavor, but what do you expect."
"O- Not my favorite cherry beer, but this is certainly a solid offering. I wouldn't hunt it down, but I would gladly enjoy another."
"Overall: this is a very good fruity beer. not quite up to the caliber of new glarus' belgian red, but very good in its own right. best drank slowly after on a cool summer night after a warm day"
"Very happy to have a whole growler of this. Not comparable to an unfiltered Belgian kriek as far as my taste for cherry beers, but a very drinkable cherry. Founders wins again!"
"This beer is exactly as it claims to be. It is a great combo of tart and sweet. Both of those characteristics come through from the cherries. It is thin in body and light in carbonation head, but fits as Founders Spring/Summer Seasonal. This is an excellent example of a fruit beer."
"Very nicely done. Very flavorful without being overly sweet. Not the kind of think I would want to drink regularly, but something to reach for every once in a while."
"Man, this surprised me. Had this in tap at The Beer Store in Southampton. Pours a very light pink with a little head. Nose us nice and sweet cherry side. Taste? Winning. This is a perfect light sour. The fruit element isn't at all overpowering either. A masterful combination. This is how you beat the heat. Can't wait to have anoter."
"O - I initally enjoyed this beer very much. The tartness was welcoming and proved to make this beer very complex. As the tasting continued the sweetness became a little overwhelming. I could see myself enjoying a few of these on a night when I've become hopped out."
"This beer has a pinkish orange body. The smell is sweet but not very strong. The taste of cherries is apparent, but could be a little stronger for my tastes.. The beer drinks easily, like a lambic, with a refreshing tartness. A tasty treat that I will be trying again, possibly with some chocolate ice cream."
"Cheers!"
"I've had Cerise twice and the first time it was fresh the second time it had a few months of age on it. The beer didn't seem to change a whole lot other than the flavor a little bit. The beer still poured out as an interesting looking golden color. The head was white and lasted for a while. The smell of the beer has some tart cherry aromas coming off of it. The taste is a mix of sweet and tart cherry it seems. It's sweeter when it's fresh but leaves a sharp tart flavor in the aftertaste. When the beer is a little older it tastes more sour I think. The mouthfeel is a well carbonated and fairly drinkable. Overall it's an interesting brew for sure. I still prefer Sam Adams Cherry Wheat over this and NG Belgian Red."
"This one heck of a summer beer, but I've had better Fruity beers. I expected more from Founders, but still a solid choice for a lighty, fruity palate or a cheese pairing."
"this particular bottle is sweeter than some of the others I've tried, which makes me like it a touch more. I love tart cherries, and I really want this one to be intensely interesting, but it just falls a touch short every time. not bad, but I want it to have a bit bigger kick to it. all in all, I'd still drink it by the growler if I could!"
"Poured from the stubby bottle into my Duvel tulip. I had high hopes for this one as Founders doesn't disappoint. Cherry red color (surprise!) with a touch of ruby. Nice head and a bit of lacing. BAM. The smell was awesome. I like fruity beers and was hoping this was like I found it to be. Nice and fruity smell but not so overpowering or sweet of a cherry taste. I did have one bit of off flavor so that's why I gave the taste a 3.5 instead of 4. Cherry, hops and a touch of malt. Very light sweetness if any. Easy drinking. Glad I tried it. Would love to try on tap to see if the flavors develop a bit more."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled 5/13/11. Pours slightly hazy light orange amber color with a fairly dense 2 finger white head with very nice retention that reduces to a decent sized lacing cap. Some fairly thick lacing is present on the glass as well. Aromas of tart cherries, peach, breadiness and a bit of funkiness and spiciness. Pretty nice aromas, though a tad weak. Taste of big tart cherries, with breadiness, spices, and big sweetness in the back. Wow, this actually tastes just like cherry pie. Fairly dry finish, but some tart cherries, spiciness, and breadiness does stick around for a bit. Medium carbonation and body. Very drinkable as well, with no alcohol noticed other than a small warming after the finish. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it is Founders, and they pretty much have never let me down. Excellent stuff, I might have to pick up a 4 pack before they are gone for the season."
"The pour was from a bottle into a pint glass. The color was a rich reddish copper. The foam was about 1/3 inch with modest lacing as the session progressed. The aroma was nice with cherry and malt overtones as expected. The flavor was rich with the sour cherry flavor, not a cloying sweetness. The tart edge evident and pronounced. The mouthfeel was appropriate, not too full. The overall experience was very good. I do not regret buying this beer and may buy more."
"D -- Decent brew that is worth a try for the brave or uninitiated. Not bad, but not amazing."
"O-This is a world class fruit beer. I have had many trying to find one that my wife will actually drink and like. There are going to be some haters on this beer, but I think that fruit beers you're either going to like or not like. This does not have a syrupy cherry flavor folks, this is real michigan cherries at their finest."
"O - Tastes like a sweet cherry pale ale. At times, that isn't a bad thing."
"This beer is best served over vanilla or peach ice cream. As a component in a beer float, it can be tasty. It can also work when mixed with juice. (I liked it when mixed with an orange juice/carrot juice combo.) Unfortunately, it's more difficult to drink straight. Although I enjoy fruity beer such as lambics, I was not overly impressed with Founders Cerise when drunk as-is. The beer's flavor has the cherry taste and not much else, more like a juice-flavored kid's drink than a fruit beer. I would have appreciated more nuance of flavor."
"This is an orange-amber beer with almost no head, despite a vigorous pour. The nose features some light cherry scent, and little else. Flavor, though is better. There's a lot of cherry taste, moderately tart, and not very sweet at all, right from the start. Not much in the way of additional flavors: bitterness is moderately low, and there's not any hop taste to detect. Malt gives a touch of caramel. Cherries are the center here, and it's very well-done."
"O: Founder's Cerise is a love/hate kinda beer. I really dug it, though my drinking buddy most certainly did not. If you can approach this with an open mind, you'll find a strikingly original brew. But I can certainly see where this could end up in the drain."
"D: overall might be the best fruit beer ive had to date. just a delicious play between the fruit and malt. im surprised more people dont find this as enjoyable as i do."
"Overall this is a an enjoyable brew, but short of excellent."
"I enjoyed this beer, but am glad I picked it up as a single because this is one that's fun to try but nothing I'd seek out again."
"Overall: Not a bad offering. I'm glad I got to try it, but I don't think I would seek out for it, however."
"Overall. I love fruit beers and this might be my new favorite."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip, The beer has a pinkish orange body with a faint pink amply sized head that leaves lacing- nice lacing on the glass after the head is reduced to a bubbly film. The smell is sweet and cherryful, but weak. I feel like I'm straining myself almost to pick something up. The taste is very apparent, and that's tart Michigan cherries. The beer drinks easily, like a lightly carbonated soda, or a lambic almost, in tartness. A tasty beer, but I don't think I'll be trying it again too soon."
"O: Really let down by this. Was hoping to get something along the lines of Belgian red, and got something that fell way short of that. Would not have again. Skal."
"O: Very easy drinker! Avni (GF) even loves this beer. I find this very refreshing for the summer months! Outstanding? No, but a very solid example from Founders."
"O- This is not a bad beer and I am very happy I tried it, but I would prefer a nice cherry lambic over this. The cherry flavor is definitely noticeable, just would like it if this was sour."
"What can you say...everything Founders outs out seems to be great. This is a super good beer for this time of the year!"
"The one thing was worried about was that this beer was going to be a sour, perhaps things like this are what introduces people to the real sours and I can see it being a gateway beer for me. Nicely down Founders!"
"I found myself gulping this beer everytime I opened another bottle. Just kept knocking more down. I guess I have the minority opinion here, but I thought this was a great beer. Good fruity, tart, sweet, genuine cherry character. Maybe not much traditional beer flavor, but I didn't mind."
"O: quite enjoyable on a hot day like this but not the best fruit beer ive ever had"
"O: Overall this is a very smooth and drinkable ale. Not to the extent of some other world class cherry brews, but still a nice sipper for a hot day. The lack of robust cherry flavor is the main downfall for this beer."
"Overall though this is a very solid beer and a great tasty fruity beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and has a good amount of carbonation sting on the tongue. Goes down pretty easily and is enjoyable to drink. Overall, not a favorite, but this is a style I'm starting to get into slightly more. The interesting flavors make it enjoyable, but the one-dimensional flavor profile takes away from the overall quality."
"It’s definitely a fruit ale focused on embodying the cherry essence, but it’s a bit too tart for my liking."
"D/O- Perhaps an above average fruit beer but only by default. Would have again down the road sometimes but wouldn't go out of the way for. Thanks MammothBrew!"
"Cerise is a very good fruit beer. I am not a huge fan of beers like this, but Founders definitely did an excellent job with it and I am finding myself enjoying it quite a bit. I actually think I like this much better than the last time I had it, though that was years ago. I would think this would pair very well with a creamy dessert."
"O: Good cherry beer but too sweet for me. Reminds me of jollyrancher beer. well done effort though. The ladies will like this one."
"To me, Cerise is a good demonstration of using fruit in a beer to give it a balanced flavor without being sickeningly sweet or unbearable for more than a glass. I could easily do a glass or two in a row without becoming burned out. The cut of the tartness and well carbonated body make this quite drinkable, even with the above average ABV range. A nice fruity, sweet beer for the summer months."
"On tap at The Beer Engine, Cleveland. Finally got around to rating this one. Reddish coloued boy, a little retained head that is soapy. Well malted down only somewhat tart cherry taste. Its OK, and that's all that seems intended.Average mouthfeel carbonation is right there."
"Overall: An average fruit beer that is too heavy on the sweet syrup. I'm not much of a fan of fruit beers but I've had better cherries."
"O- A good beer on a warm day, but one of my least favorite offerings from Founders. If you're in the mood for a fruit beer, it certainly is worth a try. "
"O - A nice cherry brew. Not in the league of some krieks, sours, or flanders reds, but a good pick here. Easy to drink and find."
"O- it's...ok. I'll stick to a solid hefe or wit for my summer beers, thanks"
"A bitter fruit beer? Yuck. Not sure if that's what they intended, but I am most definitely not a fan of this. It has an odd combination of flavors that just don't work well together at all. By far the worst beer I've had from Founders. Compared to my standard for cherry beers (NG Wisconsin Belgian Red), this isn't on the same planet."
"Pours a reddish brown color with white head. smell is pretty mute, but the cherries do come through a bit. Taste is mostly tart cherry, with pale malt. Bit of sweetness that becomes much more prevalent as you drink more of the beer and it starts to taste more like juicy juice than beer. Heavier mouthfeel than I would have figured and the carbonation is lower than many other fruit beers."
"Finishes very clean with a hint of dry berry."
"Overall- Has a nice drinkability. A nice beer for dessert or a change of pace. Not a regular in the rotation, for sure. I am not a raving fan of fruit beers....but this is a solid beer."
"This one was kind of different, the cherries are definitely there but theres somehting that is just different for me, if you like cherries you will probably enjoy this"
"I'm a huge fan of cherries, and the cherry presence is authentic, but the sweetness bring this one down a tad. It's also one dimensional for the most part, but it's a beer worth trying once."
"Glad I tested one instead of gambling on the four pack. It did grow on me a little. I did finish the beer. But I would try something else before having again. I feel like as the acidity and carbonation faded, the beer improved in mouthfeel and taste."
"D-Pretty drinkable and the most beery fruit beer I've ever had. Pretty well-rounded and drinkable beer."
"O - Out of all the Founders beers I've been able to try this has to be my least favorite...the cherry flavor is there but most of the time it's pretty low key...a little extra tartness would have been nice...albeit a nice summer beer"
"O- I am a sucker for a good fruit beer and this is one of the better ones I have had."
"O: A nice, fresh tasting fruit beer. 4"
"Overall – An interesting beer – one I have been wanting to try for a while, but just didn’t want to buy multiple bottles. Found this as a single in a store so I scooped it up. It is becoming a bit difficult to drink this, and in the future I would like to share it with my father (who loves tart cherries) while having some vanilla ice cream or something similar. As it sits, not something I’d go out and buy just to drink, but something that I will for sure try again eventually when the mood/time is right."
"O- Not the best brew from Founders that I've had but pretty decent relative to all the other disaster fruit brews that I have tried."
"O: founders hits another outta da park. great cherry beer, one of the best i've had. highly recommend and will buy more before it's gone."
"O: i'm not a convert (wouldn't buy a 6-pack) but i'm glad i tried this. certainly wouldn't turn it down if offered one. for the style, nice work, Founders."
"Overall/notes - Certainly one of the best fruit beers I've had, though my experience is limited. While this wouldn't go on my list of favorite brews in general, it would provide a nice alternative when I'm in the mood for something different. I can only imagine what eating a cherry pie with this would be like... probably would cause some sort of overload."
"O- I was a little surprised by this beer, I was not blown away but the drinkability is very high, would be really easy to sit back and throw down 4-6 of these without even noticing the abv level 6.5%, glad I tried it once, the wife enjoyed it immensely."
"It's a light bodied beer and goes down smooth leaving a slight pucker in my lips. I appreciate it for what it is but must admit its not my style. I'm a beer man for a reason and this comes too close to wine or champagne for me. Props to founders for avoiding any artificial or medicinal cherry flavors."
"Reddish orange with a pink head--yes! I wish the head had stuck around longer, though. Nose is tart cherries but could be stronger. Taste is tart real cherries, bready malt flavor, sweet drying finish. Medium bodied. Not overly sweet, and not a bad fruit beer, but not particularly great... I don't know that I would drink it again."
"Overall, very good. The cherries come through and dominate. The carbonation is light which is fine. Some beers mention the fruit used in the brewing process but disappoint, this really has a good sweet/tart cherry flavor."
"This definitely doesn't come close to krieks or other Belgian style cherry beers, but as an American fruit beer, it's not bad. A bit overly sweet, but when paired with the right dessert (notably chocolate), it can actually be very good. That said, drinking a whole bottle by itself is not really an enjoyable experience. Decent with dessert, but once again, a bit much to enjoy in quantity all on its own."
"it is quite light-bodied, and it could be sessioned if one really enjoys this sort of product. For someone not so much into this sort of brew, I'm not going back for more, but I can recognize and respect the quality of this offering."
"Overall- To be honest I was pleasantly surprised by this one, I guess I did come in with a little low of expectations in that I usually don’t love fruity beers and lean more towards the deep, dark, and rich porters and stouts. But this one did impress me, it comes through on everything that it says it, you get the tart cherries on both the smells and the taste that finish almost sweet with a nice balance of malts. It did really remind me of a glass of wine in both the smell and taste as well, a great fruity beer for those hot summer days, I would pick this one up again."
"Flavor is a touch sweet, which lingers until the aftertaste. Big Michigan pie cherry and faintly malty breadiness that one can't help but associate with flaky pie crust. Dry finish, clean and not cloying at all. Low level astringency, similar to cherry juice. This is very tasty (provided you like cherries) and not just another sweetened fruit beer. Authenticity reigns, leave it to Founders to brew a successful Michigan cherry ale..."
"I like these, but if you are adverse to flavored beers I would not recommend them to you. I had a 4-pack last year. At first I wasn't so sure about such a concoction, but this is the second year in a row I have come to appreciate fruit beer. The other really good cherry beer I had was from Smuttynose, the Hanami Ale."
"Overall this is an interesting beer and unexpected coming from Founders. I like it and would consider buying it again, I bet this would make a great beer-mosa"
"O - I like this beer."
"This beer drank a little more like a cider than a fruit beer. I would give it another go if there was nothing else available. Not founders best output, but I dont hold anything against them"
"The CPJ"
"O: Quite possibly my favorite fruit beer I’ve ever had. Tastes strongly of sweet and tart cherries but is pretty balanced. Incredibly light, sweet and drinkable."
"The more I drank this the more I enjoyed it, and the flavor and drinkability of this beer have my vote to rate this a good session beer and change of pace. Another excellent balancing act by Founders as they continue to impress me with fine product after fine product. I recommend trying this beer if you like fruit beers as it was just right in the flavor department."
"Quite a balanced brew and an unheralded winner, though not surprising from Founders."
"Overall - I'd say this is a very nice beer overall. Actually nice and refreshing because of the lighter body, the taste that isn't overpowering/overbearing, and the nice carbonation/mouthfeel. Overall I think I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5.0. Definitely not my favorite beer, but it's a good fruit beer. Nice for the summertime or as a refreshing break from stronger beers."
"Overall a nice beer but enjoyed more from tap."
"Overall- Very good fruit beer. Enjoyable to drink, though I never want to have more than one in a session."
"Overall, this is a good fruit beer, but there's nothing to make it stand out or make me want to buy it again. Tasty, but forgettable."
"O: Might be a good summer beer for people that don't want a true beer taste. Not really my type of beer."
"Overall a decent brew from founders, i would pick this up again a good session brew in between ipas"
"overall - my opinion of this beer is changing with my growing palate, what was once a cloyingly sweet wine knock off is now something that i would enjoy having a few on a hot summer day around the BBQ"
"If I tasted this blind, I don't think I'd have said it was beer. It still makes for a pretty nice pour and a good change of pace. Wouldn't get it again, but wouldn't be mad if offered as a dessert or digestif on a hot summer day."
"O- An OK beer. Perhaps a transition beer for those not into craft brews or wine. Not my thing, but worth a try if you like fruit beers."
"O - its pretty good. doesn't look or smell all that impressive but the taste and mouthfeel offer it some backbone. definitely not disappointed in my purchase but probably wouldn't repurchase this again espeically at 12 bucks for 4."
"A great cherry beer. Not strong and syrupy like a kriek, but instead a simple fruit beer, light and smooth, with just the right amount of cherry in there. Pours slightly hazy, orange-brown with a nice white head. Cherries in the nose, but not too pronounced, accompanied by light malts and some caramel sugar. Taste of sweet cherries with a tartness following, and a smooth maltiness to finish off, and just a bit of breadiness. Medium-light mouthfeel, and highly drinkable."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with minimal head on it. There is a weak scent of wheat and some cherry, but nothing too bold or fruity. The taste is a very nice mixture of wheats, malts, and sweet cherries that are again not too bold or sweet. This is one of those cherry beers that has a good cherry flavor but doesn't go overkill on the fruit flavor. A must try for fruit beer lovers!"
"Overall- Has a great drinkability but too tart for my palate. Also, not my favorite fruit beer but have to respect founders brewery for their brews."
"I swear I came close to making a beer exactly like this and now I know my bench mark. A very drinkable beer. Ill take another please!"
"O - I'd like to try it fresh to get an honest opinion. I expected tons more cherry flavor. All in all, I will try it again."
"d: I could have many of these in a row. It is a very light and fluffy beer. the combination of all the factors work well enough to enjoy this on a hot summer day."
"D: Overall, this is a pretty good beer. This style is not necessarily my favorite and this beer is rather sweet for prolonged drinking."
"Wasn't my cup of tea. I usally like all Founders beers, but this one let me down a bit. Again, it's completely different than other beers, so keep that in mind. Don't buy this and expect it to taste like a cherry wheat (Sam Adams) or cherry stout (Bells)."
"A drinkable beer that I would have again but I would not go out of my way for it."
" Not my favorite cherry beer at all. Just a bit too one dimensional and not over-the-top great on that dimension like some others (i.e., New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red)."
"Almost no alcohol presence; pretty easy drinking, and I'd return to this occasionally in the summer, but wouldn't want more than one at a time."
"Highly drinkable. There is no smell or taste that is offensive, though the flavor and mouthfeel pack a good punch. It hides the 6.5% alcohol well. Good stuff."
"4 pack will last me at least a year."
"D - The drinkability is pretty good. I think this is a pretty good beer for the style, but its really just not my thing. I would drink it again, but only once in a while and I could only handle 1 per sitting."
"Good with spicy food."
"The overall appearance of this brew is an amber/pink. This is what you would expect of a drink based on cherries. It is a good session drink. However, as it warms up, the aftertaste and mouth feel is degraded by the sourness of the brew. In my opinion fruit flavored beers are either hit or miss. But, I would recommend this beer."
"The body of the beer was pink-orange and cloudy, and there was no head to speak of. The smell was mild with only a hint of cherries, and some floral aromas as well. The taste was far better than I was expecting, with a sour sweet taste somewhat evoking a lambic or a Flanders red, but without any funkiness like those styles. The beer was light in the mouth and easy to drink with a dry finish. The sourness made this much more interesting than other fruit beers."
"D- Very easy to drink."
"Average mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Drinks low for a fruit beer. Would make a nice after dinner dessert beer, but I'd prefer to split a bottle rather than drink it all to myself."
"Close to full bodied, medium carbonation, and fairly drinkable. An interesting experiment by Founders. Some work really well, some don't."
"D-i enjoyed this beer all the way through and it kept its taste very well. it was unique but it wasn't unique enough that i'll be buying it again any time soon."
"what happens when you mix gold and rubies? This beer. Very little head, ring stays around the edge of the snifter. Smells like sweet caramel malts and cherries. Not much complexity, but it's nice. Cherries are bigger in the mouth, but not overwhelmingly cloying/syrupy. Almost there, though. Bordering on new glarus territory, but within the realm.. I'd've liked a little more tart cherry flavor, there is a bit, but most of it is drowned out in the excess of maltiness. Pretty good, split a bottle 2 ways and probably won't need another for a while. I bet it would make a great dessert companion, though. Maybe with some tiramasu or chocolate."
"D- This is more of a warm weather brew- and interesting mix between a fuller, medium body amber ale with tart fruit notes."
"It's decent, but I doubt I'd be grabbing me another 6 pack of this. Be interested to try it on tap however. Readily available here but I'd pick other fruit beers (and other founder's brews) over this one."
"Good color and average retention and lacing. Smells very strongly of cherries with lots of background sweetness. Taste is way on the sweet side with a bit of sourness to it as well. Too sweet for me. Body is appropriately medium, but drinkability is low for me because of that overpowering sweetness."
"D-Nice enough for what it is. I don't need to try it again."
"Rubaeus was one of my favorite, if not my favorite, American fruit beers. This beer isnt bad, but it isnt even close to the same league."
"D: Very easy to drink and enjoy. Would make a great summer beer crisp and refreshing."
"Drinkability: I just had a reviewable sized pour of this, but I was greatly impressed. Delightfully sour, slightly sweet, this is a great one ."
"This isn't a session beer but it's not the alcohol that's the deal breaker. Rather, it's the sweetness and pie-like mouthfeel of this beer. Is this great after dinner. Sure, and it's not a Stout either. I could easily see myself having another one of these on a holiday night after dinner and this is certainly one of the better beers in this category that I've tried - a nice surprise indeed."
"Many thanks to IlludiumQ36 for the generous trade!"
"It isn't so much that I didn't want to like this. Rather, my wariness about the style led me to even doubt that Founders could pull a gem out of this. Yet this brilliant brewery did. There seems to be nothing that Founders cannot do well, and this sweet and somewhat tart brew is no exception. It isn't quite my style, but I won't hesitate to grab a four-pack of these if the mood strikes me; a wonderful surprise."
"The beer pours to a reddish chestnut body with a creamy white head. The aroma is cherry juice and malts. The flavor starts off with sweet and tart cherries. With a smooth malt body. Almost tastes like Cherry Pie with that malt. The palate is sweet and Tart at the same time. Mouth watering. Texture really works. probably my favorite Fruit beer so far. Time to expand my taste profile."
"This is tasty and easy to drink. I will have another! Just delicious."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. Very cherry forward without being a Belgian, which is unique. The only other beer that I've had with so much unadulterated cherry goodness is NG Belgian Red. Both are great beers."
"This beer pours with an orange color with a reddish tint. It had very little head, and no lacing. It smells like you would expect of a cherry beer, with nice cherry notes and a bit of malt character. The taste is much more cherry forward, with dried cherries, maybe dried apples and oddly enough a bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is really nice and light and effervescent. Very refreshing and a joy to drink."
"When I was first hit with the aroma I was expecting the taste to be a let down, but I was blown out of the water with the flavor. The malts were rich and sweet while the cherries were mouth puckeringly tart! It almost felt like a lambic. I wasn't expecting to be as impressed as I was."
"O: I only had one to try, but I will be sure to pick up several packs of this next season to share with friends and family."
"D: This isn't very complex but it has a decent taste and is quite refreshing."
"This is a full-flavored fruit beer that I found easy to enjoy; nothing to sneeze at just because it's a ""fruit beer."" Wouldn't be a daily pick for me, but this is probably better than most in its category because, you know, Founders rules."
"M/D: Medium bodied, with less carbonation than expected. Nice sour component as well. Overall, it is a well made beer, but just not really my thing. I like it, but would never want more than one."
"D: Decent. Wouldn't drink much more than the bottle I had in one sitting."
"6.5% makes it a touch strong for a session beer (though a bit weak for a wine). However the flavor hides all of the alcohol. This is dangerously easy to drink. I'm glad that I only grabbed a single of this because I'd be tempted to drink these one after another. I think I have a new favorite cherry beer."
"D: too exotic to be returned to"
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and it was a nice change of pace from the styles i am used to drinking. For me as of lately it seems that Founders can do no wrong and this beer was no exception. This beer was fun to drink and my brother liked it also."
"D - Drinkability isn't very good. It's flavorful and hides the alcohol well, but the sugary and sour combination hurts it. A unique offering but I don't think I'll be seeking this one out again."
"Drinkability: Nice and light for such a beer, good drinkability."
"Drinkabilty - For a hophead, or stout fan, not something i would drink regularly. A nice change, for sure a dessert beer. Id pick up a 6-pack annually and leave it at that. Wine fans, not-beer fans would enjoy this. Pretty cool and different but im 1 and done."
"medium bodied/carbed mouthfeel. glad i tried it, and would recommend it to anyone into fruit beers (especially cherry, obviously) but i'm not exactly jonesin' for another."
"It a very nice dark cherry like aroma that is not overly sweet. There are some malt and hops tones to the aroma as well. The head disappears quickly down to a thin line with minimal lace. The body has dark red hue. The flavor is well balanced. The beer has a good cherry flavor without the fruitiness being overly present. There is a fruity bitterness with some grain esters. The body has a medium and smooth mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: very drinkable."
"Thoroughly enjoyed this brew. Can't wait to crack open the others in the 4-pack."
"I poured into a pint glass to a fleeting off white head. This beer is amber colored. The aroma is cherries and malt. The taste is tart cherries. This is definitely a cherry beer. The mouthfeel is medium. It is good if you like cherries. I could drink this occasionally, but it would be tough to pound a bunch of them."
"The imaginary antics of a young boy and his friends aside, I found this beer to be a nice change-of-pace that I don't need to have too often but that I would certainly be willing to try again."
"This beer pours a cranberry red clear body with a gentle carbonation of tiny bubbles and a thin bubbly wisp of white head. The clean soft fruity cherry note has a light sweet honey note that grows as the beer warms. There is a cherry jam aroma that finishes the sniff as the beer warms. The bright but no tart taste of cherries is just like drinking cherry juice with a slight cherry tart pucker in the finish. This turns to a soft pomegranate like bite in the finish. This beer has a light mouthfeel with a little fizz that keeps the finish crisp. I like cherries and I like beer but this is nothing but cherry juice with some fizz. I'm amazed that they could brew this with out any beer flavor. I would like some malt or hops or yeasty flavors to support the cherry flavor a little bit."
"Drinkability: This one is drinkable and the above-average alcohol content doesn't really come into play. However, I just didn't find it to be that tasty or remarkable enough in any other respect. It's a really average beer overall."
"Drink-ability: This is a perfect session beer. Very drinkable. I love the cherry flavor as it fades from sweet to tart. An excellent selection for the home pub."
"D- this beers drinkable, but it hasn't given me an excuse to want more of it. It's not offensive by any means, but there's just not a whole lot calling me back to this brew."
"D: Dessert...yummy!...but I've had better fruit beers."
"Pours a hazy deep pink color with a light pink head. In the aroma, a small, faint dry to tart cherry. In the taste, sugary to start, and a dry, tart cherry flavor. A smooth and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a sugary to tart, dry cherry aftertaste. Good dry to tart cherry flavor, a bit sugar, but not too bad."
"Mouthfeel is thicker than expected and pretty slick but features some nice prickly carbonation on the tongue. I could probably drink another, but I'm glad I was able to buy a single and don't have to worry about consuming a whole four pack."
"Pours a robust red into a snifter with very little head. Smells like a tart cherry and little else besides. The cherry odor is rather light and orchard like, however. The taste is of tart cherries. There is definitely a bit of pucker to this drink with a very dry aftertaste, almost like wine. It tastes remarkably like a real cherry, which to my tastes is delightful. The mouthfeel is not too syrupy or sweet. I like this beer a lot, but I wouldn't drink more than one at a time. I would love to try this with some fresh fruit or a suitable dessert."
"I could really drink this all day. This is definitely my go-to fruit beer from now on."
"D - Not really my cup of tea. First thought is not to fruit a beer. Doubt I'll pick any more up. Probably my least favorite founders drink."
"Some may look at this as a really weak link for Founders, but I feel that may be because of style bias because this really is a solid entry for a fruit beer."
"Draft. Enjoyed this as the St. Paul Beer Fest. Poured a slightly hazy pink color with a matching pinkish hued head. The smell is tart cherry right of the bat along with some other sweet fruit notes. The taste is very refreshing, especially on a hot day in the sun. Tart cherries that slightly pucker your mouth are at the forefront. Light/medium mouthfeel. Overall, I was really surprised by this beer as I have never tried it before. Very smooth and drinkable for 6.5%."
"*From notes taken on 6-25-10"
"Beer is mildly sweet with a cherry based tartness at the back of the mouth. It finishes cleanly. It tastes better than it smells. Still has a wheaty kind of flavor. Mild bitterness. Eh, it kind of has a medicine cherry flavor to it."
" Cheers, this is a definite midwest experience, and although it wasn't my favorite, I appreciate those who made it worthwhile."
"Pours a reddish orange with just the slightest head. Still, a pretty beer. Smells of cherry pie filling with a hint of spice, and a tad of maltiness. The taste is of sour cherries, sweet malt, spicy cinnamon, and a hint of almond, probably from cherry pits. Perhaps a little too sweet, but I like the sour cherry flavor, which seems real, not at all artificial tasting. Slightly spicy and relatively crisp in the mouth. Pleasant."
"Drinks pretty easy, but not enough going on here to hold me for than a few> Better than most fruit beers, but they aren't in the same league a New Glarus' fruitty beers IMO. Probably one of a few Founders brews that doesn't impress me"
"Easy to drink, but doesn't necessarily quench as much as you'd think, as this brings the sweet cherry juice pretty hard. I like it, I just don't think I'd crave it."
"D-A little on the sweet side but still relatively drinkable."
"My Cerise amore...sorry. This brew pours a clear amber copper topped by about a finger of white foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, cherry pie, ... I thought there was more in there, but I'm getting nothing now but these bakery items. Odd, kinda, but not really bad at all. The taste, of course, is dominated by the cherries as well, but here they are more sour, more medicinal, almost fake-tasting. Behind the cherries, there's a hint of nutmeg, coriander, and some very soft caramel. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation and a gooey (read: not really sticky, but not really not, either) feel. Overall, a decent fruit beer, but the complete package just doesn't fully come together here."
"Drinkability suffers due to the sweetness and pucker factor. While I really enjoyed this glass I wouldn't ask for two in a row."
"Overall, a nice surprise. Really enjoyed how crisp and refreshing this was for the summer. Certainly not the best beer I;ve had from Founders, but still really good."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It felt a little syrupy overall though. Drinkability was OK, it was a little too sweet and a little too reliant on the cherry juice flavor overall. I would have liked a bit more beer flavors to come through though. If someone blindfolded me and told me this was cherry juice instead of a beer I'd definitely believe them."
"D: My first drainpour. I'll put a bucket next to my bed tonight. Just in case."
"Poured a reddish-orange with very little head, and modest lacing. The nose was surprisingly subtle; couldn't pick up much besides a distant chocolate and tartness. The flavor however was a different story; big malty caramel initially, giving way to an eventual chocolate/sour cherry finish. Great flavor combo. Not overly carbonated; medium-bodied. Great dessert beer."
"Drinkability/Mouthfeel: Nice tickling carbonation and very easy on the palate. The main thing I liked was this ran the gambit of not being too sweet while still maintaining 6.5% alcohol."
"Slightly hazed reddish-orange hue with a thick, creamy head that quickly dwindles to a slim, bubbly cap. A moderately subdued aroma of cherries and warm spices improves as it warms up. Loads of flavor compared to the nose...big, full, tart cherry sweetness with some underlying spice and a hint of a malt base. Less spice than the aroma, the flavor still strikes me as ""warm""; it's a comforting beer to me. Smooth and medium bodied, yet it remains refreshing. I still like it better on tap though."
"MF/D: overly carbonated the minute it hits the tongue, dissipating the flavor rather quickly. founders should probably stick with their excellent stouts."
"d- curious, not sure i'm a fan. founder's should probably stick to the uber stouts. how about alaskan breakfast stout? not sure i'll really like any cherry beer when ng belg. red is around..."
"drinkability is good - not a beer i could drink more then one of in a sitting but a nice way to end a meal"
"D- tasty and enjoyable just not that great. Kind of artificial in the cherry department. Rubeaus was better but this year is better then last year. An amazing intro beer and a great one for I the picky lady."
"I wouldn't have this with more than potato chips or pretzels."
"Overall, I still may favor Rubaeus over it in terms of taste, but I'd still consider this a pretty good beer."
"Amber/very light red color, with a decent, 1/4 inch white head. The aroma is sweet, cherry juice and malt with no real hop aroma to speak of. The malt is formidable with some caramel, along with some biscuit flavors. There is quite a bit of cherry presence, sharp, a little acidic and sweet. And then it closes back in on the biscuit, like a cherry-biscuit (I don't know if any bakers make that, but they should). The body is medium to medium full with good carbonation. On the whole, the malt bill is intriguing for a fruit beer, but there is an acidity to this beer that grows towards the finish and works against it for me."
"D: Too sweet and fruit-forward for more than one serving of this. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered as a dessert drink, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Light to medium bodied, Low carbonation, with a sweet aftertaste. Nothing about this beer stands out as extraordinary, but it is solid, and worth trying. Nice for the summer months."
"pours a transparent copper color with good white head and good lacing that receded quickly. lively fizzy carbonation, and strong fruity cherry smell. taste was much the same very fruity, cherries definitely apparent. light bodied and short flavor duration. very crisp and refreshing. moderately sweet with a thin texture. finish is lightly sour and tart. very good brew."
"--"
"D- definitely a dessert like treat. Kind of excited to try it with the ice cream. This will be my first non-stout beer float. I like the access to a cherry beer that is not some high priced cuvee."
"D- I kind of got sick of the flavor by the end. After that initial anticipation of tasting it, the beer got dull. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes fruit beers, but there are much better ones out there"
"D - Light, crisp, and refreshing but one is definitely good for me. Gets a bit too cloying, but would probably make a great dessert pairing. A rare mis-fire from Founders for me."
"D- Sweetness of this beer makes it a little difficult to have more than a couple. That being said, a great dessert beer that pairs great with chocolate covered fruits."
"Not bad for what it is. Does not hold a candle to other cherry fruit beers like Wisc Belg Red."
"D: This would seem to be a dessert beer or a pre-dinner beer to open the palate. Tartness is nice, but it is also quite sweet. One will do the trick."
"D - Damn. Surprise, surprise. Another winner by Founders. This is an exceptional desert beer, a refreshing summer (or winter) brew, and it would pair nicely with a great many things, not to mention it's capacity to support an ice cream float or serve as a base for a cherry reduction. Outstanding."
"Pours a golden color with a pinkish tinge, and a thin white head that retains OK...looks less pink than last years iteration. The aroma has some tart cherry and raspberry notes, along with some cane sugar sweetness, biscuit, and a little alcohol...underwhelming compared to previous years. The flavor has a lot of tart cherry, raspberry and red apple notes upfront, along with cane sugar, a little biscuity malt, a little lactic acid, cherry cough syrup and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and luxurious, and drinkability is excellent. This is an intriguing summer beer that achieves a nice balance of sweet and tart and tastes more like fruit than cough syrup unlike some other fruit beers."
"Not too complex but tasty."
"drinkability: Great. I thought this would be a one and done experience, but I'm ready for another and I don't even like cherries."
"Pours a nice cherry brown with a thin white head. Nose has candied cherries and straebweeires, but not much else. A big fresh cherry presence in the flavor with bit of tartness that keeps a nice balance to the beer. Crisp, refreshing body. Tasty fruit beer."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and surprisingly well balanced between tart and sweet. Honestly, it is about time I find a cherry beer that is not shockingly tart or cloyingly sweet. Overall, this may be my least favorite Founders beer, but one of my favorite fruit beers, which I guess shows how much I love Founders but typically dislike fruit beers."
"overall - very drinkable. i was expecting something sweeter and fruitier. this is more along the lines of a sour or farmhouse. Its a good beer though. cherry flavor rounds it out well."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. Goes down like a fruit juice without much bite at all. Really enjoyed this one. My wife even went for a glass."
"Pours a medium hazy peach color with a minimal amount of somewhat white foam that quickly dissipates. Subtle cherry aromas, along with some almond and a little honey. Decent cherry pie flavor, with a nice tart finish. Was expecting more fruit in this one (along the lines of New Glarus) but it was enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: My fourth bottle and it hasn't let me down yet. The cherry is full, not in the sickly sweet way, but in the natural, gamey way."
"D. This is a delicious brew. My wife gave it two thumbs up."
"I would recommend this beer, especially over Founders Rubaeus. It's cherry pie like taste is very good and intriguing. It makes me wonder what the Rubaeus could've been like if they took the same approach."
"D. Verry good for the style, a little on the sour side."
"DB- The price was the standard Founders seasonal four pack price. It is a bit too sweet but not overbearing, it makes it a one bottle at a time thing. Their Newaygo County and last year's version of this one had more cherry flavor, fruit varies year by year. Glad I tried it, one of the better fruit beers out there. The fruit tastes like real fruit, not artificial."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy pink with even carbonation. It almost looks like a pink cider. The head quickly dissapates from the middle. The lacing is average at best. This has an earthy smell with just a hint of cherry. It's real nice because it's not overpowering, but just sort of teases you. God I love cherry beers! This one has a cherry taste that sneaks up on you. For the first two seconds after you sip there's nothing....and then it just explodes in your mouth (Sounds like a Tobias Funke line....). There's just enough sour at the end to cause a slight pucker (Maybe I should carry a tape recorder around and listen to myself....). This is great! Super light mouthfeel, which is a bit of a downfall. If it was a bit heartier, it'd be a top 5 for me. Really high drinkability on this due to tasting like real cherry and not that sweet fake cherry flavor. I want another all ready!"
"Taste is one-dimensional, but interesting enough for me to keep wanting more. Good level of cherry flavor--not overpowering and not just a component of the flavor."
"Drinkability- pretty easy drinking though could not tell you yet how many of these I would want or have in sitting but i do think do to the great balance of sweet and sour I could have quite a few of these, its not very super sweet which is certainly a good thing for drinkability purposes, the cherries are certainly noticeable but more for the sweet and sour then really pure cherry to me anyway, a nice interesting beer thats got more abv then you would think drinking and certainly goes down fast, worth a shot for sure"
"All in all, this brew is pretty good. Better than I expected as most Fruit beers have disappointed me. Good to try if you like your brews sweet."
"Copper colored brew, small white head. Good amount of lace. Smells like sweet cherries. Mmm. Tastes like sweet cherries. If you like cherries, and you like beer, i reckon you might like this, cause it tastes like beer soaked in cherries. Not overly sweet. Thin mouth. I like."
"D-There is just not enough going on with this brew to get too excited about it. Just average for this style."
"D: The flavor profile is a bit thin for my liking. It would seem a cherry beer could be more... interesting? Drinkable, but for now, this is the weakest Founders offering I've tried."
"D - Well not hard to drink, but I don't want this again, would rather have a beer that doesn't taste so much like a fruit drink."
"D: The beer is definitely easy to drink and goes down smoothly. It's a pretty good beer for this particular style."
"D - I wasn't sure if I would even like this beer and it turned out to be a nice buy. I would buy this again."
"D- easily drinkable and I enoyed it much more than the first time I had it. The price per 4 pack is alot more than I plan on spending again, but that has nothing to do w/ my score."
"Drinkability might be a little below average. The flavor is great, but it's lacking in other areas. If the finish was tweaked and improved it would be more sessionable but even then, it is a nice beer to try, just not the kind I want many of. I would buy this again but it will probably be next year before I do. Recommended once every season it's offered."
"drinkability: well done fruit beer."
"D - This is pretty decent, it had a good cherry flavor but definitely one dimensional, nice too try though."
"drinkable, but why bother? just drink a cherry soda and add vodka."
"D: Pretty solid beer."
"Overall Impression: Probably the best fruit beer I've had to date. I always wanted to try it, but I didn't want to buy a 4-pack. I put together a mixed 6-pack, and this was one of them. I'm glad I tried it. You should too if you're looking for something different"
"Tart on the tongue with a lasting tartness in the finish, almost mouth-pucker inducing. Carbonation is high but works well with this beer. VEry easy to drink but this one could grow old after about three or four sessioned consecutively. I enjoyed this one. I took a chance by buying a case for $20, but I think these will go down just fine, especially in the warmer months ahead."
"i really good fruit beer-- probably one of the better ones i've had. this would be delicious on a summer day."
"While it's not New Glarus or Cantillon, it's still a fine fruit/dessert beer."
"Very light and tingly on the tongue. The initial burst of sweetness borders on being overwhelming, but stops just shy of that. It may be low on ABV and IBU's, but it's still a slow sipper due to the sweetness."
"Overall, this is a horrible fruit beer. It should not be consumed."
"A lawnmower beer for you and your wife. She is sure to like it. And if she doesn't, take a trick from founder's themselves and mix it half and half with a lemonade and you two will both have something to sit around the pool with on fourth of july. Not over powering cherry, just enough."
"Hadn't had this one before and I HAVE to try anything by Founders. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Cerise is a hazy amber-orange color with a thin, almost non-existent head. The nose is all tart cherry, really not much else going on there. The taste is also mostly all cherries, the tart cherry seems to be a better pick for a beer because it doesn't have that sickeningly sweetness that a sweet cherry would have. This is however a pretty sweet beer but the tartness helps keep that in check. The mouthfeel is medium in body with a mouth puckering finish that leaves you wanting more. Overall a decently done beer, one of the better cherry beers I've had but for a Founders beer - a little disappointing. Worth trying though."
"Nice crisp body, yet subtly smooth. Flavors of tart cherries, but nothing puckering. Also some honey-kissed biscuits, and the faintest of hops. Bitterness is low. This was quite refreshing and surprisingly drinkable. Not bad."
"Not sure why this beer is rated B. I think this is a very good fruit beer."
"good beer i liked it"
"D: Not my style of beer, for me, one is enough, but it is an interesting beer, worthy of a try."
"Overall a great ale from founders next to the pale ale and Scottish ale respectively. I could drink this every week!"
"D- Not a bad cherry beer, could have used a bit more sourness and something to fill out the body after the initial taste."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into wine glass. Lots of carbonation after the pour but the head disappears seconds later. This beer is not horrible it is just different. Not much of a scent at all. The taste is overly sweet and honey like in nature. The aftertaste has a somewhat small tart cherry like flavor. Mouthfeel is very light and the alcohol is well hidden. I do not really have desire to drink another one of these right now or anytime in the near future."
"D: I love this beer, but one glass is enough. Just a tad too sweet to be an easy drinker. The cherry flavors pair well with mild cheeses and fruity desserts. Founders really doesn't make a bad beer, and this is proof. The fruitiest and strangest brew still tastes great."
"A nicely done fruit beer. Pretty drinkable, but one or two would be enough for most people. If you like cherry in your beer, you'll enjoy this."
"A tasty fruit beer, but a fruit beer nonetheless. One of these with some cherry pie or black forest cake would be nice, but beyond that, I'm not sure I could down anymore."
"M/D - The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, but the only thing keeping both of these categories is that the sweetness will get to you quickly."
"Pours a ruby red color that is slightly hazy and has some visible chunks in it. There is a frothy head that is fizzy and gives way to minimal lacing. The smell is of sweet and sour cherries and sweet malt. The taste is of cherries over a sweet malt backbone. The cherry taste is very unique and very good. The mouthfeel is a moderately carbonated and slightly fizzy. Overall though the drinkability on this is very high. If you dont like cherries i would stay away. If you like cherries or are looking for something different you could drink these all nite."
"D- Good drinkability. Not too sweet or cloying. This is a thirst quenching, light, crisp and refreshing beer."
"D - This is quite an enjoyable fruit beer. Very nice overall cherry flavor. Seems perfect for desert. Really think this would be great with some chocolate cake, a brownie sundae, or such...Good by itself...not one I could have a few of in one session, but with chocolate deserts, outstanding."
"A well balanced and toned down tartened sweet cherry beer that may be a good starter fruit beer for those not quite ready for the big sour brews out there."
"Drinkability: I would have this again on the same night and recommend this to those who enjoy cider and want a fruity twist."
"D- It's easy to finish a beer, but more than one is too much cherry for me. Overall a decent brew, it was cheap, interesting flavor you don't have every day. Not a super complex taste though. It's worth a try. Not my favorite fruit beer but I'm still just scratching the surface with this style."
"Pours a deep red with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly, but never disappears completely. Smells of cherries, sour cherries, faint perfume, and a brown sugar malt sweetness. Taste is a puckering tart cherry up front and sweet malt with a syrupy sweet lingering cherry flavor in the finish. Medium body and carbonation with a syrupy mouthfeel. I liked this one, I think this is a very well done fruit beer. I love cherries but sometimes fruit beers can be well over-fruited."
"D-Cherries really have an opportunity to shine, making this one interesting, if in only low volumes."
"Watermelon hued body topped by an off-white head that quickly fades to a loose and broken collection of foam islands. Cherry aroma is evident without getting too close to the glass. A closer sniff reveals a more balanced cherry and malt aroma. Occasionally I still get the hint of Swedish fish candy. Flavor is predominantly cherry, but there is a nice biscuit malt flavor. Overall, this is a very light tasting beer. Hints of bitterness pop in briefly on the finish. The beer gets more and more refreshing as I continue to quaff. Mouthfeel is thin, but it works well. I think a thick bodied beer would get tiring and cloying with this amount of cherry flavor. Drinkability is very good - I find myself wanting another."
"Poured a reddish hue, hints of brown, with lively carbonation and a lace ring on top of a decent sour/tart fruit smell and hints of malt. Minor hop bitterness and sharp tart/sour fruit tastes that is alright but slightly offbalance. Some sticky malt is in this beer, but it is mostly a tart fruit. A decent ale with minor sweetness but a little too tart for me to drink all the time."
"Poured a pinkish color out of the bottle with good carbonation but once it settled it was deep cranberry color. Nose is all cherries. Very sweet and sugary cherries. Taste is more of the same. Very sweet, ripe cherries. Very tart on taste and mouthfeel. One will be enough to drink."
"D - this surprised me in a really good way. I see a lot of similarities to New Glarus' Wisconsin Belgian Red, which is a huge thumbs up from me. I really enjoyed this beer and will most definitely purchased again."
"D: Well, it isn't even close to New Glarus Belgian Red, which is just about as close to intense as this style gets. Good, refreshing, but, the large amount of sediment about freaked me out."
"Drinkability: Not something I would drink everyday, but a well-executed fruit beer that blends both sweet and tart flavors nicely together"
"Pours a reddish-pink mixed with a wee bit of brown. The aroma is that of tart cherries with hints of sweetness. The taste brings out even more cherry flavor, coming full on at your palate. There is a slight tartness to it as well. Medium bodied and quite drinkable, a fantastic fruit beer."
"D: Quite drinkable and quenching. I could easily drink several and be content."
"Tastes just as nice and tame as it smells. The berry/cherry blend reaches a nice balance between sour and sweet, and like most good fruit beers it starts off juicy and finishes smooth and creamy. Refreshing, but there's not enough going on in the middle and end to make it a really great fruit beer."
"Ok, I'm over the fact that I'm drinking a pink beer. The beer is also good enough to comfortably drink in public. [""Yea, it's pink, asshole, but it tastes better than your piss water.""] However, I think one bottle at a time will do it. It's too sweet for more than one at a time."
"Pours a hazy ruby red, really neat fruity colour, almost grapefruit like, thick slightly off white head forms, slowly drops to a thin layer and ring around the glass, nice chunks of lace stick. Smell is nice, cherry juice, straw, lightly funky, barnyard and grass, fresh fruit, light cinnamon spiciness, earthy, pretty neat. Taste is similar, very sweet though, caramel and sugar, cherry juice, cinnamon, earthy, fresh fruit salad, more sugar, honey, lightly tart in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. A little too sweet, kind of like BG Belgian Red without the complexity."
"Founders proves to me, once again, that they are worthy of being one of my top favorite breweries."
"The main downfall of this beer is that you can't taste any form of beer in it (which at 15 IBUs isn't that surprising I guess). I am admittedly biased to start with, considering that fruit beers aren't my favorite to begin with; however, this is not the best of it's style and is my least favorite founder's effort to date."
"Single bottle copped from Joe Canal's in Lawrenceville... Cherry puree-laden aroma combined with authentic fruit flavor imparts a refreshing and subtle brew with a moderate 6.5% ABV... Interesting stuff from Founders... Although not a particular fan of this type of beer, I will give credit where it's due..."
"Glad I tried it, but would not buy again."
"Reddish copper pour with a small layer of head. Tartness present on the nose with fresh cherries and hints of alcohol. Taste is moderately tart and surprisingly subtle. The cherries present are very fresh and ripe tasting, and there is a slight acidity on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light. This one has a nice flavor but isn't too bold, a decent fruit beer overall. Not one of my favorite styles, but in this case done well."
"Pours a hazy pink amber. Not quite as strikingly pink as some red fruited beers, but it's rosy. The dissipating head is whitish with hints of pink as well. Aromas of cherry are noticed immediately without bringing the glass to the nose, though it is not overwhelming. Along with the sweet and mildly tart fruit is some malt, but no hops. The tartness is more pronounced in the flavor. It is rather natural tasting and there is a little malt flavor, but it seems to be here mostly for structure. It finishes dry (thankfully) with a little bitterness on the back of the tongue. I don't care to drink more than this one as I am craving more traditional beer flavor. Fine for a fruit beer, but lacks complexity. Perhaps one to offer to those less enthusiastic about beer as a segue into craft offerings..."
"D - You definitely won't like it if you have an aversion to cherries but it's not syrup-like at all. A good desert beer or fruity summer drink. Well balanced and brewed."
"D - I had no idea what to expect, but I like it. Not something I would regularly seek out, but definitely tasty & enjoyable to drink."
"D-You had best like tart cherries or this beer will fail you! The Rubaeus of cherry brews. Tart, lightly sweet, crisp and refreshing. Nicely done Founder's."
"Overall this beer is what it is. A solid cherry beer. Worth a shot if you're in the mood."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability is average. There are some nice aspects, but overall, it's just a bit too much, and a slow sipper for me. One and done for sure, but nevertheless, I'm glad I got to try it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rose color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of cherries, sweet and tart. Taste like it smells, more tart than sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good effort."
"D- Easy to drink and enjoy each sip"
"Blipped ""Cherry Bomb"" by the Runaways."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Bottled on 3/20/09 indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy strawberry color with a loose quarter inch, off-white head that immediately dispersed into a skim and some clusters of ringlets around the edges of the glass. Some spots of lacing, but fairly weak legs. Mild nose - slightly tart cherries and a wheat character towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - sweet up front and tart towards the back, as well as some artificial sweetener in the mix; wheat character come out much less in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel was light/medium with a consistent background effervescence, some astringency in the mix and a fairly dry finish. Interesting beer, but one was sufficient."
"Conclusion: Good flavor, but not enough of it...better than the average fruit beer for sure, but doesn't approach a good Kriek or New Glarus' offering...paired nicely with a chocolate bourbon mousse cake"
"i really wish this brew was more dry and finished with a dry spumante-type finish...but, see what you think...i'd buy a single and stay away from the 4-pack unless you have friends who might enjoy..."
"Okay, paying $4.50 for a single, I said ""this better be good"". Then I saw average reviews and lowered my expectations. good thing, because this beer isn't bad at all. I know I have not tried Wisconsin Belgian Red, but this is what i would expect. Nice sour notes and enough cheery flavor to hit the spot. Not sure of any realy flaws. Founders always does it right."
"This beer poured a cloudy orange/copper color and formed a small white head that left trace lace as is quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt and sour cherries. The flavor was of malt, and sour cherries. It had a medium light body and the finish was sweet and sour."
"But not easy on the pocketbook with the $2.50 a bottle pop, and for a ""low"" alcohol brew. I'll probably pass on this in the future."
"D: This is easy to drink. I would only drink one per session. It might go well if pared with something. This is something I'm finding with sweeter beers. Worth the experience."
"Poured a medium reddish/pinkish color with an average sized, frothy, pinkish head. Aromas of cherries. Tastes of cherries, cherry pie, pie crust, and bready. On the sweeter side with a lighter tart, cherry finish (but definitely leans towards the sweeter side). Pinkish lacing left on the glasss."
"D - Easy enough to drink, fun and not all that tiring."
"Sort of a chick beer I guess. I felt it was worth a try, but nothing that really connected for me. If you don't like overly sweet beers, maybe you'd like this, but I thought it could have used more flavor."
"Poured a reddish amber and you could smell the strong cherry-ness easily. It had a decent-bodied mouthfeel but at the end of the day, the cherry flavor was just too much. It tasted as if it was half grenadine and was just entirely too sweet for me. As for the poster than referred to it as a ""chick drink", my girlfriend said it was way too sweet for her too. I supposed it would be an interesting one to try a shot-sized sample of during a fruity beer tasting festival or something of the like, but the entire bottle was just too much for me. Possibly the first founders I didn't love. I guess it was bound to happen sometime!"
"I'm sure this isn't a bad beer, just not my thing. I'd stick to Mike's Hard if I wanted something this sweet & summery."
"Easy to drink if you are in the mood for it but I cant see as I would drink it very often although for the style I have to say its one of my favorites in my limited exp."
"drinkability: good enough"
"D- not overly bad but not in the good stage either. Its something to try but not worth purchasing."
"D: would be great to pair with ice cream, or cheese cake, or even as dessert itself. if anything its worth a try"
"Great little cherry ale. Not too much complexity, just loads of cherriness. That has it's place, sure, but in the end I find it a bit blase'...can't do too much of it."
"[NAH-6]"
"D) A very delicious beer. Well crafted. A nice session beer."
"D- I should have known that this style wasn't really for me. It tasted more like spiked punch at the prom than anything else. Not bad, just won't be getting it again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"mouthfeel and carbonation are moderate.overall this is a really good fruit beer."
"M & D - Thin mouthfeel that leaves a bit of bitter cherry aftertaste. Compared to other fruit beers I've had, this doesn't quite stack up (but I am spoiled by New Glarus, being from WI...and they have perfected the fruit beer). However, I'm a big fan of the style and could find myself sitting down with a few of these."
"Meh, a bit of a disappointment, but today is a day to paint the town red. So for that purpose alone, Cerise was a rousing success."
"Underrated is the best way to sum this beer up. I personally feel it is getting marginal marks just because it is a fruit beer. However, this is probably one of the best fruit beers available, period. A nice complex flavor with an excellent drinkability make this a summer seasonal that will constantly be in the fridge during the hot months. Highly sessionable and a nice treat, especially if you enjoy cherry flavored beers and ales."
"I found this beer to have a really good drinkability level. Yet another positive offering from Founders."
"D: Decent cherry beer. Wouldnt drink more then a bottle in a session though."
"D: It goes down quite well, although the fruitiness, as well done as it is, might get old after awhile."
"Considering the wounded condition of Michigan's economy and the fact that 75% of all the tart cherries sold in the U.S. are grown within a few hours of the brewery, it's a very amicable thing for Founders to switch production from the Rübæus (raspberry) to Cerise. It's a fantastic example of the social responsibility - in the true sense of the word - that microbreweries are capable of providing within a community; I'll gladly support that."
"Nose is muted hops with very fresh natural cherry aroma...not especially strong. Mouthfeel is crisp fresh and light, a refreshing brew, nice effervescence. The flavor is quite tart with very natural cooked cherry flavor. The fruit is well-integrated into this brew, not at all an added-on flavor effect. Bitter cherry plays well with mild hoppy bitterness, but the balance is quite well done. The finish is long and in that is where sweetness makes itself apparent...a nice effect, balanceing the prominent bitterness. One of the better fruit beers."
"Drinkability is alright with this beer. Despite its lightness, the warming alcohol would make this a decent beer on a cool day."
"D - This is a great tasting fruit beer. However, I couldn't really have more than one."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a red/pink color with about a half inch light pink head. Head retention is low, lacing is good. Aroma is sweet and tart cherries. Neither the sweetness or tartness overpowers the other, there's a good balance between the 2. Taste is similar to the aroma. It's all cherries, but I think there's more sweet than tart in the taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit rich and is well carbonated. Drinkability is OK, I could have a couple of these every once in a while if in the mood for a fruit beer. It's a decent enough brew, but this isn't something I could drink all the time."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. Nice beer to sip on with friends who don't like craft beers because well....it doesn't really taste or drink like one. Overall not a bad beer at all and I plan on picking some more up for my friends who don't drink."
"Pink and red grapefruit colour, spritzy head fizzes and shrinks away, not much head remains. Lots of sediment, I avoided most but there is still a hazy suspension of flakes, most fall to the bottom of the glass in due course. Smell is cherry, rhubarb. Tastes like a cherry juice spritzer, some bitterness, muted sweetness of strawberry, cleansing mouthfeel. I like that the fruity taste is not too sweet, no syrupy texture, crisp green apple at times, rhubarb. Body is a bit thin, aftertaste not bad, berry fruit mainly, alcohol not a factor. Well worth trying."
"Notes: Another good beer from Founders which I am beginning to doubt has ever made anything but a bad beer."
"D- Not bad, the sweetness makes this hard to drink too many."
"Word is, Cerise is a replacement for Rubaeus, presumably due to the relative costs of the fruit. That's a shame because the raspberry beer is better than the cherry beer. Oh well, there's plenty of other stuff from Founders to love. Like most all of it."
"Fruit beers are not normally my forte, yet this one I actually found pleasant to drink. The cherry flavor wasn't overpowering like in some other cherry flavored drinks I've had. Also for 6.5% ABV, this was very easy to drink, almost too easy. In fact I could see myself accidently drinking a six pack of this way too fast."
"D: Pretty solid, I found it enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Couldn't have probably more than 2 of these due to the tartness. My wife likes them, so I will probably keep some on hand."
"Pours a nice burnished copper color with some decent head ad cice lacing. Excellent cherry scent, with just a hit of malts in there with it. Nice tart flavor, wonderful cherry attributes that don't overwhelm, with just a hint of hops and a nice malty hit going through it. Goes down fairly smooth, but does have an odd mixture of after tastes."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. The beer is definitely easy to drink as it has good flavor. The ABV is well incorporated, and I would have never guessed it to be at 6.5%. I can see this beer wearing on the drinker though. The fruit flavor is a bit much to enjoy more than one of these. A pleasant experience nonetheless."
"Overall, I really liked this beer. It was refreshing and nice for a hot summer day. I could easily drink another. I will be getting more of this."
"All around pleasant new fruit beer here from Founders. I dug the authenic taste of the cherries and this was definitely a steady sipper at 6.5% ABV. I think this one's at least worth checking out."
"This poured a hazy pinkish copper with a bit of white head. It smelled like refined wheat and bready yeast with lemon and a bit of cherry. It tasted like sour cherry and refined wheat and bready yeast, with some lemon and copper hops. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a tart aftertaste. Overall this was an interesting beer. The smell was subdued and misleading, while the flavor was very puckering cherry. It tasted clean but was more like a witbier or hefeweizen than expected. It had good body, but the sourness made this more of a sipping beer. I suppose this accomplished what the brewers intended, but it wasn't right for my tastes."
"I'm not really a fan of fruity beers but this is one I really enjoy. Perfect for a hot St. Louis summer and a must try."
"Taste is ok. Light, fruity but not too sweet or overpowering like some of the blueberry beers. Kind of a cherry soda type flavor ending with a bit of sourness at the end. Some malt presence as well. Mouthfeel is rich enough. Drinkability is ok. I'm not a big fan of this style. but this beer is more enjoyable than most of the fruit and vegetable beers I have tried."
"Overall, I'll have another"
"I bought this four pack for my wife for $9.99 because she loved it at the Winter Beerfest in Comstock Park, MI this past year. But her positive pregnancy test this morning now makes the beer mine! It looks like Cherry 7 UP. Rose colored body with a nice pink/white head. Sour tart cherry smell. Not much else. Faint malt, maybe. This beer tastes very much like those cans of tart cherry pie filling. Sweet and sour. Lacing rings are left behind with every sip I take. Well carbonated and medium body. Pretty easy drinker. Good novelty beer. Probably a good choice for girls who don't like beer."
"It pours a very carbonated and fizzy reddish color from the cherries of course, with not much white head or lacing. The nose was not overly fruity, a bit more subdued with vague hints of sweet malts, sweet florals, maybe a hint of yeastiness. The taste was just spritzy on the tongue, very cherry in flavor, lots of sweet seltzery cherry soda like flavors, with some solid malt underneath that gave it some body. This was just an enjoyable, not overly sour, not overly light, refreshing cherry seltzer like beer. It's worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: Although this beer tastes pretty good, it's just too sweet for me. One or two at most for me."
"D - As has been the case during this review, it's really hard to think of Cerise as a beer. The whole time I've been thinking of a sort of sparkling wine with some obviously lowered ABV. At any rate this stuff tastes great which is almost unheard of when brewers start throwing fruit in their beer. Although you won't find the seamlessness or pure synergy of fruit and beer as in the case of Bell's Cherry Stout, you will get a very clean beverage showcasing natural tasting fruit rather than a sort of fruit ""esscence"" superimposed on a weak, off-tasting American wheat. Cerise wouldn't be a bad choice to have a couple of, it certainly goes down without a fight. I can also pleasurably imagine finishing off a night with this brew."
"Cherry seltzer with a delightful nutmeg and cinnamon finish. Mouthfeel is slightly beery and though not as obnoxiously fizzy as I had firt anticipated, it's still pretty soda-like. One of the better fruit beers I've had but as with all of them, one is plenty."
"Not one of Founder's better offerings."
"Had this on tap at the Founders Brewery. Poured into a pint glass. Appears an pinkish amber color with a thin head. Of course the aroma has plenty of cherries - boy this beer smells good. There were aromas of other berries coming in too. Taste starts off quite tart and then the sweetness kicks in mostly of cherries and some raspberry. Wow, I love the way this beer tastes. Very well balanced and a great dessert beer. My lady friend with me enjoyed it quite well too. Founders needs to be in TX soon."
"D: Pretty good, not something I would want to get drunk off of, but something I could happily have a few of."
"EDIT: as it warms the cherry flavor really shines through nicely making for a much more drinkable and pleasant brew."
"D - A one-dimensional fruit beer that fails to provide much excitement. Would be good for tipping back on a nice summer day, but its lack of complexity means you don't need to seek this one out."
"Decent, but I doubt I would buy it again. I've never been a fan of Founders fruit beers and this one doesn't change my opinion."
"Very rose hue with some watermlon meat highlights. Very quick two finger, bright white head that recedes to nothing right after the pour. The aroma is of soft tart cherries and some ripe granny smith apple juice. The taste is super smooth with just a mild cherry tartness. Very fruity, but not too fruity. Sweet, tart, and juicey on the palate. Great cheery ale."
"A bottle enjoyed at the Flying Saucer in KC. Pours the color of a light cherry juice with a thin foamy head that fades to lacing. The smell is very nice; cherries, wood and some maltiness. Medium-light body, it is adequately carbonated and refreshing. Moderately flavored cherry apple cinnamon. The entire package is quite drinkable."
"Drinkability is high because it's fruity, cold, and light in the mouth. On a hot day this is a great summer beer."
"Bottle. Pours a light reddish pink with a thick light pink head. Aroma of cinnamon, sweet cherry, and apple pie. Wow, this tastes like a fresh apple pie (crust, fruit, and spices)! Yum! I don't know why this tastes more like apple than cherry but I don't care! A little on the sweet side. I'm glad I decided to try a bottle of this."
"D: Very nice to drink, but I don't want more than one. I would buy a four pack again, but i wouldn't enjoy two of these in a row."
"Pours a nice hazy reddish color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, very slight yeast note, cherries. The taste is malty, with some yeast note, sour, cherries/raspberries. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Drinkability: Not a bad brew. A little too one-dimensional for me. Some brettanomyces might develop flavor complexity. A decent brew though."
"Since fruit and beer has a long and loyal history, Founders' proud summer seasonal celebrates what's best about their popular and local cherry crops."
"D: Pretty high. This is a very refreshing beer to enjoy on a warm day. I enjoyed one while grilling steaks yesterday."
"D: I dunno... I think one is enought for a sitting."
"Pours almost pink at first. Like a fruity tropical drink, except not really cloudy. By the time it settles is is a slightly darker shade of red. Smells malty, and lots of cherries. Something like graham cracker in there also. Taste, is a slightly tart cherry blast. But the great thing is unlike many cherry beers, it doesn't cloy at all. Not too sweet, just right. Nice malt base, and what I think is cinammon to go with the graham crackeryness. It's a little thin through, as to be expected, but very drinkable. I'm liking the second bottle of this a lot more than I liked the first."
"Overall an easy drinking, smooth, clean and very seasonable light fruit beer. I would have no issue at all with having this again any day, In fact I think it would be well worth it."
"Big fan of this beer. Decanted into a pint glass. It's a hazy deep red with a white head. Good retention. Aromas are a little bready, emphasized with tart cherries. Flavors are fantastic. Starts with a sweet and tart cherry flavor, then moves into a bready center. Tastes like real cherries - not an overly-sweetened syrup. The flavors are well balanced, too - this still definitely is a beer, not kool aid. Medium mouthfeel. A very drinkable fruit beer - I will gladly return to this one!"
"Drinkability: An ideally refreshing cherry beer and one I enjoyed. It's no New Glarus Belgian Red, but it's no slouch, either. Give it a try if you're an admitted fan of fruit beers."
"Served in a cervoise glass."
"D: The tartness and prickliness of this one makes me take it a bit slow."
"I much prefer Rübæus over this, but Cerise is leagues better than most fruit beers I've had."
"Pours a hazy pale red color with a small pink head that unfortunately does not linger for long. Just some wispy suds is left behind. Plenty of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma consists of cherries and a musty malt that might hint to some tartness. Has a nice slightly tart cherry flavor. A bit like cherry syrup. Finishes sweet with a cherry aftertaste. Nothing surprising in the flavor. A little bit of a sour/funky component would work well with this beer. Light body with a slightly fizzy carbonation. Perfectly suitable in this beer. Easy drinking for cherry lovers. More serious beer drinkers may prefer a lambic however."
"This beer pours a light red color that fades to pink when held up to light. The head is small and pink, and recedes into almost no lacing within seconds. The aroma balanced between malt and cherries. The cherry character is more like a sweet cherry juice than a tart kriek beer. The taste, however, has the tartness in vast amounts. There is a little malt detectable in the background, but it is really all about the cherries. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, I'm quite impressed with this beer. The aroma could use some tweaking, but everything else is very nice."
"Pours pink with a small light pink head that was gone fairly quickly with no lacing. Aroma is tart cherries and a little musty, slightly yeasty. Taste is puckering with lots of tart cherries, sweet, almost has melted cherry popsicle-like flavor to it. I really do like this cherry flavor and the tartness, but it's not as fully consuming as something like Wisconsin Belgian Red. Prickly carbonation, pretty easy to drink actually. Very nice on a warm and sunny day. I can dig this. Not something I would drink all the time, but this 4 pack will do nicely for now."
"An awesome accomplishment. Beer is one of the top mediums for distributing flavor. This ale shows the potential to capture an ingredient and showcase it with careful balance. The ruby grapefruit body looks so natural. The off pink head sits beautifully ontop and drops lacing with each sip. The aroma is faint zest with a flash of acidity. The taste is a rollercoaster ride. Light, crisp zest hits sweet cherry flesh back to a zingy acid bite. The cherry flashes from tart, to sweet, to subsiding zing. This ale showcases brewer talent. In a world of starbuckesque, flavor shot fruit beers; this one marches to its own accomplished drum. To the man behind Founders; I salute you!"
"Is this really a beer? Who cares is what I say. It's pretty darn good and definetly something to search out if you want a different experience. It looks like cherry 7-up and smells like a bowl full of cherries. The taste is wine-cooler, but refined, expertly crafted wine cooler. I don't know if I would want more then one, but on a hot day as your first drink for the evening this will do you quite nicely. If you want to rip it because it doesn't really seem like a beer, I suppose I can understand. To me, it was a fun and refreshing experience."
"Bright ruby red in color with large bubbly head that leaves lacing down the glass like sticky sugar. Subtle notes of cherry yogurt, candied sugar, bubble gum, and candied apples in the nose. Forceful flavors coat the tongue: light cherry puree and then sour candied sugar zest breaks through; conquers, burns, pillages the palate and leaves behind a sweet-sour note that sticks around. Light and a bit dull in mouthfeel; a light body strawberry daiquiri. Wise choice to sell in 4 packs, the fruit zest can overwhelm a palate if drank over a long period of time. All in all a very pleasant cherry sensation worth a dive into."
"D - Slightly like fizzy cherry juice with a bit of tartness but makes for a nice fruity summer refresher."
"Drinkability- a very good summer beer."
"Overall, a pretty big disappointment. But I wasn't expecting a knockout. It's ok, my view of Founders is not tarnished. I still have 3 new brews to try and hopefully love. This one just didn't do it for me."
"I could drink this all day long....very nice beer."
"Feel and Drinkability: Feel is light and finish is dry. Carbonation is actually pretty light, you'd think that for something like this it would be spritzy, yet it is not. Its just right, not spritzy and not so low as to give this one a thick and medicinal cough syrup quality. This one is easy to drink and is quite quaffable, though if quaffed it becomes less interesting and its much more difficult if not impossible to pick up the diacetyl in here that really adds to the beer. This is one that I'd buy again. Not a bad deal at $9.99 a four-pack, hey the abv is 6.5% and its an easy drinker. Great for the summer and spring, fall and winter....no. Not going to lie, this is one of the better fruit beers out there, sure its no Kasteel Rouge and it doesn't stand up to Founders Rubaes, but its still one of the best out there."
"12oz. I'm a big Founders fan, so why not try them all? Poured a rosé pink with hues of orange when held to the light. Rigorous pour yielded a very thin white head. Aromas are obviously fermented cherries, faint yeast and maybe some wheat or dried grass. Tastes are sweet, ripened cherries; slight carbonation produces a nice mouth-feel. Very refreshing and finishes sweet but tart - good balance. Alcohol is unnoticeable. Reminds me of my grandma's cherry pie. For a fruit beer, this is well made and I think Founders got what they were going for here, therefore it is a good representation of the broad and variable style."
"Again, nothing amazing - but no real problems either. A pretty solid American fruit beer."
"D- I like cherries and I like beer but this is nothing but cherry juice with some fizz. I'm amazed that they could brew this with out any beer flavor. I would like some malt or hops or yeasty flavors to support the cherry flavor a little bit."
"D: I'm drinking mine in a hurry."
"D - Like drinking natural cherry soda, you forget it is beer. It really is one of the best fruit beers out there since it is so light and refreshing and incorporates the fruit so well."
"Overall, this was a nice change of pace brew for me but nothing that I would pick up regularly. Nice brew for the style, and definitely worth a look."
"Pours a pommegranette color with a small, light pink head. Smells of lightly tart cranberries. Tastes of light tartness, cherries, kind of like a wine cooler actually. Mouthfeel is light medium, decent carbonation, semi dry finish. Fairly drinkable if your into this type of stuff, it's crisp anyhow. Pretty refreshing."
"D- No thanks I'll pass only the second Founders I didn't like and yes, they were both fruit beers."
"12oz bottle in my Bell's tulip. Appearance is very nice, light strawberry red with small white head. Not much aroma. Taste is tart cherries with a dry finish. If it had any earthiness, it would be like your run of the mill kriek. Mouthfeel is very light, maybe almost too thin."
"I can imagine a group of 21 year olds drinking Founders Cerise at a pool party, along with umbrella drinks; however, after finishing one today, I feel like I need to follow it with a beer (and possibly a shot of testosterone)."
"Bottle: Poured a bright pink color ale with a large pink bubbly head with minimal retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium sour cherries with some discernable malt. Taste is also dominated by sour cherries though malt bill is present but somewhat neutral. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Well done with good balanced and not cloying in any way."
"I probably still prefer a good batch of Sam's cherry wheat to this, especially for the price. Founder's is a high quality brew though, and this is a very good ale."
"Overall, it's loaded with cherry, just the right amount of tartness, and it's somewhat spritzy, light, and refreshing. Nicely done! One of the better straightforward fruit beers I've tasted!"
"Reddish pink colored beer with a rapidly fading head,Aroma is sour fruit.Taste is cherry and sugar cane.This reminds me of a Tastycake cherry pie.This is something a little different than yout normal beer,but in a good way.I enjoyed it and believe that it should be tried at least once."
"Sour cherry pie without the chew. Definitely a dessert beer; would go well with cheese. Good body with light carbonation. Sour-sweet aftertaste that is lip-smackingly long."
"A pretty pricey fruit beer. Not that refreshing either. If I wanted a cherry flavour, I would take a lambic over this, easy. On the other hand, it does have more to it/more tartness than a typical American fruit beer. It's a sweet cherry-pie cherry in a beer (with a hint of breadiness so it's almost like drinking a cherry pie. No problems drinking one for the experience. Don't know that I could keep drinking it though (or would particularly want to have again)."
"Poured a clear ruby red with 1 finger of white head with some pinkish edges into a goblet. Good retention and some spotty lacing. Smells of sweet cherry syrup like in a pie, along with some brown sugar and grain. Tastes of tart cherries and cherry syrup followed by some honey, brown sugar, and doughy bread notes. A slight earthy hop finish as well. Medium in body with some prickly carbonation. Sweet with a touch of tartness, like a liquid cherry pie. Very easy to drink, definitely could see myself enjoying many of these while lounging by the poolside in the summer."
"pour is pinkish red with a pink/white head. somewhat clear. the head smells doughy to my surprise. mild cherry tart and stale chamomile tea with honey. the taste is a mild sweet with a, not a flemish red, tart. not to complex. this beer was rather herbal though and actually somewhat easy to drink. good body. a lot better than i expected. good with shrimp."
"D: Not too much."
"Solid drinkable fruit brew."
"Drinkability: All around solid for me. This one's heavily infused with real cherries, and you can tell, so if that's not your thing, you may want to avoid. I don't know how many I could do in a sitting, as one seems just about right after sipping it out of a tulip, but I like it a lot, and it'd be a good dessert beer after dinner if you don't want all those pie calories."
"D - Cerise tastes, quite simply, like liquid cherry pie (much like Southern Tier Pumking captures the essence of a pumpkin pie). This one tastes so good, make a grown man cry. Good God, I can't believe I just quoted Warrant in a beer review. Oh well, there's a first time for everything, I guess."
"This is a respectable stab at a really tough style to master. Founders does an admirable job and it is truly one of the better fruit/vegetable ales I've tried."
"Drinkability: A worthy replacement to the Rubaeus, really. It's not mindblowingly amazing, but the fruit notes are pleasant enough, the beer well enough balanced, and there are enough surprises thrown in to keep it interesting and relatively enjoyable, and at 6.5%, it's certainly not too over the top. Give it a go."
"Pour is a beautiful maroon red with pinkish-white head.. sure, it look smore like cherry soda than a beer, but it still looks awesome. Has a sort of tart fruit smell to it, obviously smells of tart cherries but also sort of a candy-like smell similar to saw sweet tarts or something.. its a very fresh smell, though.. not inorganic. Taste is obviously fruity, tart cherries again but with a slight hint of bitterness from hops somewhere in there, it tastes a lot like a lambic. Very easy on the mouth with crisp carbonation with a light (not thin) body, a hint of sweetness like youd get from cherry syrup in a shirley temple or something towards the end of the swallow. You could easily drink a ton of these like they were sodas. Obviously, its more like a lambic or fruity soda than a beer, but for a fruit beer its awesome."
"Cerise is an above average fruit/vegetable beer. Overall, it's okay and has enough beer-like qualities to pass the laugh test. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of cherry and this was a little over the top for me. At the end of the day, it's a little better than I expected. While I'll never be a big fan of either, I prefer Rübæus to this. I guess I'm just more of a raspberry than a cherry fan. Meh. It's worth a try."
"D: This might be awesome as a half and half, but I don't think I'll be drinking a lot of these solo.. Good, but not great."
"Easy to drink - fizzy like a soda but so much better, a great summer beer."
"Overall, a huge disappointment from Founders. They are MUCH better than this. Granted, fruit beers are very difficult to do well, especially cherry, but this just doesn't make the mark. I wouldn't buy it again...."
"M/D - nice carbonation, the mouthfeel is a little weird to me, i like the sour cherries but its almost too fruity. Its like drinking a wine cooler"
"Drinkability: This is an above average fruit beer but nothing I feel is spectacular. I feel Rubeaus is a better drink. I will have this again and could have two in a sitting but will not actively search for it."
"Flavorful, but doesn't taste like beer at all. More like a very well made wine cooler. Worth a try to satisfy my curiosity, but I probably wouldn't get it again."
"The cherry flavor is well managed. Too often in cherry-flavored beers you get something more like a Jolly Rancher or cough drop, but here the cherry is very mild, almost more of a background flavor. Not too sweet, with a some tartness to balance. Finish was a little dry, with cherry pit bitterness."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers, but I figured I'd give this one a shot if Founders made it. It's not bad, and definitely drinkable, but didn't wow me."
"Pours out a hazy. reddish-orange color. The head is very thin and loose, but the carbonation is very vibrant, bubbles fly all through the beer and cling to the side of the glass. The smell has a very deep bready sweetness. The cherries are faint, somewhat medicinal, but the fresh grain, barley, maybe wheat are very strong. I kind of hoped there would be some tartness, but I don't sense it in the smell. The taste delivers though, I'd say. Really is quite like cherry juice, some tartness, then a very nice pleasant maltiness, bready, sweet, but not cloying. The cherry taste is not like cough syrup, like I expected, but instead just delivers on the cherry. Reminds me of those tart cherries, not the dark sweet ones, but the yellowish-orange ones. I'm really liking it. The mouthfeel kind of clings with its sweetness, and it sort of reminds me of cola. The carbonation is spot on. At points it gets kind of thin. You kind of expect a fruit beer to be tart (at least I do, like the dry sour kind of beers). But this one really works, with brilliant fruit flavor without being either too sweet or too dry. It drinks very quickly, and the 6.5% won't hit you too quickly if you just have one. Though I could imagine drinking a few more if I had them. I would recommend it."
"Very interesting and different beer but I couldn't see myself drinking more than one of these in a sitting."
"Drinkability is ok; would be able to drink more if I didn't feel like I was getting a sugar high."
"Had a pint at Pearly Baker's in Easton, PA. This beer was a disappointment. It came out a clear cherry red with no head. The aroma and flavor are basically of cherry juice while there's also a vaguely nutty malt flavor in the background of the taste. Juicy but flat and not satisfying as a beer."
"What's amazing is this isn't a lambic, tart cherries carry the flavor. Appearance is like ruby red grapefruit juice with a light pink tinted head, fine bubbly carbonation forms evenly with lacing down the sides of my glass. Aromatics offer up tart cherries more so the peels bringing alcohol and sweetness together along with the smell of evident grain infused within potent tart cherries. Flavor is excellent it lands some where between a sour ale and some cherry flavor jam. Reluctantly sweet and sour is thrown my way, but in the mix I find cherry peels carrying some booziness and some light cereal grains blending so well with the juices of mother nature. What an excellent blend touch of vinegar like acidity in the lightest vinegarette imaginable. Sweet syrupy layers of cherry sweetness quickly fade to dry tartness excellent creation very interesting like cherry cider. Great stuff I remember Rubaeus, right up there with that fruit ale. Founders doesn't offend I detect real fruit with a balanced profile mouthfeel is light at times with a reduced simple syrup border at times. Carbonation is perfect that's where everything carries out so well, quite the experience here. Girls will dig it and beergeeks will try and figure out how they did it. Drinkability is nice I don't get tired of the tartness or the cherry sweetness a great yin and yang offered up in a glass this one is good for your chee."
"D: I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It's been my experience that as far as beer goes, cherry flavors don't play well with others. They either dominate completely or leave an unpleasant sour sensation that clashes with the main body of the beer. This one, however, has just enough cherry essence to be distinctive without it completely taking over. In all, an excellent summer beer. If you like Duchesse de Bourgogne or Rodenbach Grand Cru, this'll be right up your alley."
"Best way to describe this is tart and sour. Good if you like cherries."
"Its ok for a fruit beer, at least they went all in with the cherries instead of the slight hint that is so typical of most fruit beers, and it doesn't have that fake extract taste to it. Not bad if you want a cherry beverage."
"D- Goes down easy. Sweet, but not too sweet and just a hint of tartness to balance it out."
"A unique beer that I appreciate as well done, just not to my tastes."
"M/D: Light bodied, prickly carbonation but seems appropriate. OK drinkability. A good bit of cherry, but the taste is just too off make this a very drinkable beer."
"D: Founders is a great brewery, this is not a great beer. This is not a good beer, this was flat out hard to drink."
"Good news... it's not! It actually tastes somewhat like real fruit. I'm detecting some sour cherries, sort of like a frozen cherry pie filling. That's the dominating flavor and after that I'm not getting much else. The beer coats the mouth with sweetness and goes down smooth and easy. I usually don't like fruit beers and this doesn't really change my opinion, but it's one of the best I've had so far. It actually has some real fruit flavor instead of having some fake syrupy taste. I could see myself drinking this again some day."
"12 ounce stubby bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for $3. Bottled on 3/16/09. Poured into my shaker glass and appears a hazed color akin to blush wine with about a finger of light pink foam. The head fades to a thin layer within a few minutes leaving a slight lace on the inside of my glass. Smells and tastes of bread, cherry pie filling, tart cherries, cherry pie, crust and all. Medium bodied with a notch below medium in carbonation. I could see myself going through a 4-pack or two of this while it's around."
"This beer pours a deep rose color with a thin offwhite head. Smells of tart cherries. Simple, but right on for a fruit beer. The taste is cherries and that's it really. The mouthfeel has a light body with lots of carbonation. Drinkability is surprisingly really good. I opened this one (the first one in the 4-pack) after a long day and was worried that a fruit beer like this might not satisfy my fix. I am not usually a fan of fruit beers but this one is top notch. Simple, to the point, does not pretend to be anything its not. This may be my favorite fruit beer to date."
"12oz bottle into a Founders pint glass a surprisingly rose tinted brew with a thin off-white head that lasts and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma was loads of cherries and slight sweet malts. The taste was a very tart abundance of cherries, almost like Three Philosopher's light. Not quite as tart as some Flemish reds I've had, but close. The beer is medium bodied with slight alcohol presence and a bit of carbonation. This is certainly one of the more interesting beers I've had from Founders, a bit of a change of pace for them, but still enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with a bit of carbonation."
"Dazzling copper rose with a slight haze. Small, lacy, eggshell-white head. Nose shows off tart cherries, cherry syrup, fruit punch, light graininess, and a hint of floral hops. Mildly tart cherries start off the palate. Reminds me of cherry pie. Toasted grains and pie crust malt follow, before the sweetness comes in. Fruit punch and cherry sweetness swells, pushing any tartness aside. Finish brings in some cherry pits, and faint bitterness. Lingering tartish cherries. Medium-bodied, with a creamy feel. Not a bad cherry ale, in the vain of New Glarus's Belgian Red. This one is not quite as good, but is decent. I would prefer a little more tartness and a little less sweetness, but that's just me."
"Buy anything else from Founders but stay far away from this one. I say this as one of the great lovers of Ephemere and other fruit/vegetable beers. This is not a beer, it is a poison..."
"12 oz. Reddish amber pour with a bit of white/pink head. Some red fruits, cherry and grassy aromas. Taste is pretty straight forward with the cherries. A little tart at first, gets a little sweeter with some maltiness. Just a faint hint of hop bitterness on the finish. Pretty thin, almost like a kriek type brew. All in all I'd say this is pretty drinkable, but you have to be in the mood. Something a bit different from Founders."
"For a fruit beer, this is one of the better ones I have had. If you are going to make one, make sure the fruit is the showcase. In the case of this beer, it certainly is."
"Founders Cerise pours a pink color, with a bit of pink heading that doesn't hang around too long. It sort of looks like cherry flavored ginger ale. Smell is of very sweet cherries, although there is some hint of sourness at the end. A slight medicinal quality also comes through. Taste is of cherries, cream, pie crust, more medicine. A light bodied beer, drinkability loses a few points for the sometimes overbearing sweetness. Not a bad effort from Founders. I like the Rubaeus a little bit more, although they are two totally different beers. Grab a single and pair this with dessert."
"For a tart beer, very enjoyable, and actually refreshing. The cherry was a nice touch. I'm looking forward to the other three bottles. Recommended."
"So, yeah. As a beer for a really hot summer's day this rocks. As just a beer, well, not impressed."
"D- this beer isnt for me. nothing offensive about it, it just doesnt seem like a beer to me. might be enjoyable on a hot summers day, but i doubt ill give it another shot. glad i bought one and not a four pack. not one of founders better offerings."
"Hey, it may not taste like real beer but it tastes good and it's really light. And it goes wicked quickly. Maybe not the beeriest of beers but it's an enjoyable deal."
"Decent fruit beer overall but compared to some Belgian cherry beers it just doesn't hold up. I wish they still had the Rubaeus."
"Thin, clear rose amber color with a pink frothy head with streaky lacing and little retention. Aroma of sweet cherry, like a pie, not much of a hop presence. Moderately thick mouthfeel, little carbonation. Taste is like cherry pie, sweet at first and then a slight tart finish. I don't know, nothing remarkable, certainly not as high quality or complex as the rubaeus its replacing in the lineup. The finish lingers with a slightly stale taste that makes this less drinkable for me."
"Drinkability- Not bad. The cherry isn't overpowering in the least and very simple. Not much going on other than the cherry and that's something I really enjoy. I can see how some people really wouldn't like that. Either way, definitely worth a try."
"A nice offering of a fruit beer."
"Overall- Basically cherry pie in a bottle. Actually quite good. Can drink 1 or 2 at the most."
"D- A tasty beer for a change of pace. Not as tart as most other cherry beers. Drinks a bit easier than the ABV would lead you to believe. Well done."
"Overall, a very cool beer, that's not too fruity or too cherry, which I expected. Well worth a try."
"I cringed and puckered up a bit after the first sip tried a little more and gave it to my girlfriend who didn't want to drink it either. Disappointed but I guess the style just isn't for me"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The carbonation comes close to being biting. Not too shabby but I dont think I will be getting anymore of this beer."
"Pours pinkish red. Pink head. Nose is bland. Cherry and one-dimensional. Flavor is cherry, and it is so-so. Too much fruit juice, not enough beer. Feel is thin on liquid and the carbonation is fairly vibrant. I don't dig this. Too much fruity and not enough beerness."
"This is a decent fruit beer, but it doesn't seem quite up to Founder's standard of taking it to the next polished level. It seems over-priced considering how light it is. I wouldn't bother buying it again, which is unusual as far as Founder's and I go."
"Drinkability is not the best here but if I were in the mood I might drink two or three at one sitting."
"Very refreshing and a nice change of pace. Give this to someone who ""doesn't like beer"" and see what kind of reaction you get."
"my bottom line: It's like Sam Adam's Cherry Wheat, but good. A 4-pack my girlfriend and I can agree on."
"Drinkability: for those that are not fans of fruit beers, this one will change your mind. The flavors are well balanced and you may actually want more than one in a session which rarely happens in this style."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't session with this beer but instead would enjoy it on every/any occasion that doesn't necessarily call for beer. This is one over those brews you can use to convert people to the craft beer world - a brew that even the most loyal wine lovers can enjoy. Founders has hit the nail on the head with this one and I look forward to having this beer again with some great food to complement."
"Fairly clear, bit of haze, with a definite red hue. Fine whitish bubbles formed a thin ring and a few remained on the surface of the beer, producing some short-lived spotty lacing between sips. Mild aroma, floral hops were up front with a subtle fruity character. Yeah, there some cherry there, but also a bit of earthy berry. Certainly balanced towards sweetness, bitterness was light and really only noticeable up front. Sour cherries and sugar/caramel became prominent mid-palate and sweetness increased into the finish. There was a hint of crackery malt and some tartness towards the end. Medium bodied with carbonation slightly less than average, a bit viscous. Not bad overall. The cherry flavour had a bit of a medicinal quality to it as the beer warmed, but the malt kept it closer to cherry pie territory."
" Thank You Founders"
"Drinkability: Would be very drinkable for someone who enjoys cherries. Since I don't care for cherries, one will be more than enough for me."
"Small pinkish head on top of a slightly hazy red body. The small head doesn't last for long. The smell is like maraschino cherries. While I wasn't blown away by the appearance or smell, the taste of this beer is truly great. The four pack was definitely worth the $12.99."
"I bought a 4-pack for $11.99 in Columbus, first time I've seen it. In retrospect this seems a bit too pricy for this beer, but I do like most things from Founders so it seemed like good odds. The beer is reddish-orange color, very clear, with a thin sticky white head. The beer smells a little like cherry pie, I get some cinnamon and cherries and maybe a little fresh bread out of this. I think the taste is OK for what it is, but fruit beers are usually not my thing. Sweet upfront and a little tart in the aftertaste. Medium body and easy drinking (so long as you like cherry pie). Not to be purchased again by me, unlike other Founders beers."
"Pours a clear red in color with no head at all on the pour. Plenty of carbonated bubbles around the edges, and racing up the side of the glass. Smell is all cherries. Very sweet and sugary cherries. Taste is more of the same. Very sweet, ripe cherries. I kind of like the lack of being highly carbonated. This could be quite possibly the easiest drinking beer I've ever come across. You could really put this away without even thinking about it. I would like a few other flavors to make it a bit more complex, but this is what it is. Decent spring/summer beer."
"Why do I listen to people? The guy at the Big Ten liquor store raved about this brew so I felt I had to try it at the source. This is yet another cherry ale, none of which is different from the other. Served on tap at Founders brewery in a nonic glass, this is a mild, boring brew with a reddish hue (pardon the rhyme). Non-craft fan women might like its simpleness and lack of complexity. Some cinnamon in the taste. It kind of grows on you like mold. Sadly, a round waster in an otherwise special visit to Grand Rapids. Probably true to the style, but who cares?"
"D- Once I heard it was on tap I had to have it, and im glad I did. Very drinkable and refreshing and a great beer for the upcoming warm weather. Low alcohol and a slighty tart taste and feel makes this one a winner in my senses. I need to find a bottle to compare."
"Note - Previously Founders Cherry Pale Ale, this has been slightly reformulated and bottled as Founders summer offering..."
