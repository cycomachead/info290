"Too sweet for me. I feel like I'm drinking cranberry sauce."
""
"Not to sweet or tart but well balanced. I really enjoyed this the few times I had it. It isn't a go-to, but fruit beers are generally not my mainstay..."
"Bottle poured into shaker pint. Courtesy of Tim that night I didn’t have the right channel for the ’Hawks game and we watched T’s skiing video w/Kristy. Medium red-brown body with tan head and a few patches of lace. Aroma is dominated by toasted malt and raspberry. Taste is slightly tart raspberry, sweet toasted malt, hints of cocoa and nut on the swallow. Medium body, soft creamy texture, moderate carbonation, dry finish with lingering tartness."

"A nice easy drinking fruity beer.  Seems lighter and a tad more watery than the ABV states, but its still a nice refreshing beer."
""
"O- Pretty decent, smells great as I would expect from fresh raspberries but the mix on the palate leaves a bit to be desired. Not a bad effort by New Belgium at all, but I think the carbonation and bitterness is a bit too much. I think the raspberry sweetness would otherwise be balanced out by the chocolate, toasted malts of the base brown ale; the earthy, herbal hop additions aren't really necessary."

"Taste-Rasberry, toasted malt, medium bodied. An interesting take on a holiday brew."

"This beer is what it is. They advertise a brown ale with raspberries, and this is exactly what that is. It's nothing crazy, but it's solid."
"There's a touch of a fake fruit aroma and flavor, but the flavoring is nicely balanced, and I love raspberries. Lacks the depth of flavor of a new glarus, but not a bad brew."

"BBD 4/12/15.  Pours a lovely clear medium garnet.  Normal head volume, below normal lacing and retention.  Rich nose of raspberries over a light sweet base that seems biscuit in nature.  Light body with just a hint of smoothness.  Well carbonated with a lively effervescence from the onset through the finish.  The flavor profile is where this ale shines.  Intense raspberry with a subtle underlying biscuit sweetness that never becomes prominent enough to balance the tart raspberry.  It never hits the puckering stage, but the effervescence maintains a prickly tartness on the tongue.  The finish is somewhat crisp and leaves you with a tart raspberry flavor.  This one avoids the sickeningly sweet fault of many raspberry ales."
"As this beer is billed as a ``raspberry brown ale'', I expected something quite a bit darker, richer, and different. This strikes me as a standard raspberry beer that is similar to (but in no way comparable to) the raspberry beers produced by New Glarus and Founders. The bottle says this is a ``big, luscious celebration"" of raspberries. While ``luscious'' is not the word I would employ to describe this beer, it was fairly enjoyable and refreshing and would make a nice summer beer. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much flavor to it (at least, not the flavors I would look for in a beer like this). I won't buy this again and if someone gives it to me, I think I'll try mixing it with something."

"An interesting light raspberry frambozen"
"It's either bad beer or good cough medicine."
""
""
"I've never been a fan of this style, but even so, this beer underperforms for the category."
""
"Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation.  Enjoyable, a light beer for the cooler weather"
""
""
"Overall - A surprisingly tasty beer, which may seem like a gimmick at first, but make no mistake, this beer is extremely refined, well-crafted, and dangerously drinkable at its ABV. An outstanding offering that just feels right on a cold winters night."
"This is supposed to be a brown ale?  Very fruity sweet, overall not a bad tasting beer for whatever it is they were going for"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The raspberry flavor is pleasant and slightly tart.  There is not much complexity and the body is pretty weak."
""
""
""
"It's an enjoyable fruit beer with a light thin face."
"O: Not much left to remind you of a brown ale, raspberry really takes over, but I'm not complaining. I could drink this all day."
"Real nice mellow fruit beer.  Nothing fancy, just real simple, drinkable and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is crisp up front with a little less on the end, the semi-dry to dry medium body pretty much the same.  It's well carbonated and maybe moderately smooth."
""
""
""
"When I hear the word 'frambozen', even though I'm familiar with its Flemish origins, back in my native tongue, all my feeble brain gets is 'frozen raspberry', from a sense of place and rudimentary French knowledge. Anyways, a nicely fruity brown-ish ale, the balance evident after more than a few mere sips."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty decent take on a fruit beer. Sweet and jammy but not sickly sweet. Nice chocolate malt flavor comes through after the fruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Though there's certainly not a lot of complexity here, it accomplishes what it sets out to do: give a nice, fruity snap of sweetness along with the malty balance."

"I liked it even though it was 5 mos past its best buy date.  I think it will taste of more berries if it were fresh.  I learned my lesson, even if my beer cellar is organized that doesn't mean my fridge is.  ugg"

"If you are going to invest in a fruit type of beer, I think it best to stick with Lambics or Belgian styles that are conducive to fruit in general."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-Too much raspberries, too sweet, nothing else to this beer. If you absolutely love raspberries give it a whirl but not much of a reason otherwise."

"O: This is interesting...but not really my cup of tea. Glad I bought a single."

"12 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, best before 2/23/2014. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart raspberry, raspberry skin, caramel, toast, light chocolate, brown bread, herbal, floral, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of raspberry fruit, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of tart raspberry, raspberry skin, caramel, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, floral, and herbal earthiness. Light fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering note of raspberry, caramel, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of raspberry fruit, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/fruit balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly creamy, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice fruited brown ale. Good balance and robustness of raspberry, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O- When I saw this was a raspberry brown ale I was thinking it would be a light American Oud bruin but turns out it's just a regular English/American Brown ale with raspberries. None of the flavors are very full and it's a pretty watery beer. Nothing really off putting to me just kind of weak and not too sure fruit works with this style. The raspberry is a bit syrupy but many are and it's not heavy enough to be offensive."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth (3/5) and foamy (2/5) mouthfeel that suits this raspberry brown ale just fine. Closes dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Perfect if you hate beer or anything that tastes anything like beer."
""
""
"Overall: Like a few of new belgium beers, I love the idea but it doesn't fall quite where i want it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is an interesting beer, but not my favorite. The combination of raspberry syrup flavor and toasted/nutty malts make for a somewhat odd pair in the doses used here. More malty sweetness might help balance the raspberry and give the beer a better profile. The light mouthfeel is also a bit out of place and more body would make this brown go down better."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and good example of a Raspberry Brown Ale and I think it could still pass as a decent example of a fruit beer since the raspberry is nice and noticeable. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, not filling, and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these and I think this would be a good beer to pair with a holiday dinner. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, I thought it was pretty perfect and neither the Brown Ale base or the Raspberry were too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad but I wished it was Brown Ale like. I would buy this beer again, I would for sure get some next year and I'm sure I'll pick up a couple more bottles before they are all gone. I would recommend this to anyone who likes raspberry beers or anybody who thinks that a raspberry Brown Ale sounds good. All in all I was happy with this beer, I thought it was very solid and it had great balance. Good Job New Belgium thanks for another good beer that somehow managed to fly under my radar."
""
""
""
"Mouth: A little thin, but not atypical of a brown ale. Could potentially benefit from additional body. Clean and dry it leaves little lingering besides a slight fruit tartness."
""
""
""
"Overall - something about this beer just makes me happy that it is Christmas season. Has a special little place in my heart and I could drink these all season."
""
"Overall- Not bad for a seemingly low end fruit beer. Not amazing but definitely above average. I would definitely give this a try and could even see myself buying it again. That is not something I say about a lot of fruit beers."
"Kind of disappointed with this years frambozen. Had it the past two winters and it was excellent both times. Seems to be watered down this year. Nonetheless it is still easy drinking and has been growing on me the more i drink it. Just doesn't stack up with the previous years this beer was released."
"O: Decent but nothing special - unfortunately the raspberry smells and tastes artificial. I like the combination of the chocolate with the raspberry though."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice coloration, fair head, and some strong lacing. Nose is at really good malt and fruit combination. Very well-balanced. Flavor is lightly malted and lightly fruity, neither aspect overwhelming the other... well done. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"12oz bottle, ""Best Before 17Feb13", pours red in color topped with a thin, off-white head. Sweet and tart raspberry fills the nose coupled with some brown sugar and a hint of caramel perhaps. Tastes are sweet raspberry up-front with brown malts, it's tart and a little sour on the finish with a very slight grassy/herbal hop presence, while finishing semi-dry while the raspberry lingers. Thinner mouth-feel with lower carbonation. Overall, pretty one-note and rather cloyingly sweet. I like raspberries, but this was just okay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An enjoyable, well done fruit beer. Lots of raspberry, fairly sweet, with a complimentary malt backing."
"O - One of the better fruit beers i've ever had. Really reminded me of a liquid peanut butter and raspberry jelly sandwhich throughout the drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- once you get past the initial tart shock, this one is pretty enjoyable. It is labeled as a brown ale but lacks the malt profile for a true brown ale. However, it is one of the more enjoyable fruit beers I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
"D: A solid brew--especially for style, but just not special. An easily drinkable (and very sessionable) holiday beer...would be a great one for a larger gathering where the focus is more on the company and less on the beer."
"Overall this is my favorite New Belgium beer. It's not overbearing, it's clean and refreshing and I can always have several without feeling like its a dessert."
""
"As standard American-brewed fruit beers are concerned, Frambozen is head and shoulders better than most. But the problem is that there's so much in common with this beer and Belgian Framboise that the comparisons leave me wanting more of that Belgian character in this beer. Fair? Unfair? -to each their own, I guess."
""
""
""
""
""
"C+"
"O - You can detect raspberry but overall this is a pretty weak beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer but I am not blown away. Everything is balanced and remains in check but at the same time, there is no real wow factor. A solid brew from New Belgium but not something I would go out of my way to find."
""
""
""
"Terrific holiday beer that features the fruit without being over done, malt and drying hops balance well then cleanse the palate for the next sip. Crisp, uplifting and makes this beer feel like a celebration."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Frambozen didn’t quite live up to the hype, and I wouldn’t say it lives up to its price tag either ($10.99). However, I full enjoyed drinking them and would absolutely order this if it were on tap somewhere. I’d probably even buy a single bottle next year. Recommended."
""
"Pours a clear reddish-brown with a foamy reddish-beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some earthy raspberry aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness and a fruity finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that mixes up the fruitiness from the raspberries and the base brown ale fairly well."
"Overall - Does what Lost Coast's Raspberry Brown fails to do; namely, keeping the sweetness from becoming too cloying. Raspberry truffle in a drink; New Belgium nailed it. Perfect dessert beer. I could drink this late Christmas morning and not have a regret."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear ruby red/brown with a thin tannish, almost purple head. Aromas of raspberry preserves, and malt. The flavor begins with a sharp acidic tartness, followed by some fresh raspberry flavor, thin a hint of malt. The aftertaste is very tart and raspberry tasting. Mouthfeel is good. Overall an interesting beer, pretty tasty, though the raspberries take control of most of the aroma and flavor."
""
"Overall: A nice, light Christmas beer. I don’t like many fruit beers, but this is pretty good. Could do away with the lingering astringency. Would pick up a six pack if it was on the shelf."
"Taste- Creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation, tart raspberry... and thats about it for me... the tartness is overpowering any other flavors. It kind of reminds me of champagne.. all in all this a really good holiday beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a very enjoyable beer. Not a ton of complexity but a great pairing of the malt aroma and the raspberries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent brew.... New Belgium has done a pretty good job of putting a raspberry flavor into a brown ale."
"O - New Belgium carefully manages to extract the core concept of a fruity framboise and applies it to a brown ale while maintaining the beer qualities keeping it level and fruity without being completely fruity. Frambozen is a nice winter seasonal that offers gentle festive cheer without being over the top fruity or strong; these could be kicked back by the 6-pack at family gatherings no problemo."

"I was really looking forward to this, I usually enjoy New Belgium beers and I love raspberries but this doesn't live up to the standard set by either."
"Overall a unique and excellent fruit beer. Perfect for Christmas time or anytime."
""
""
"This is definitely a brown ale with raspberries mixed in. I find it earthy and hearty and deeper, which reacts with the raspberries very well. Combines to make a hearty, yet somewhat refreshing ale, even though it's more robust than the standard weak fruit beers. This is actually bringing some good character. I like it and could definitely go for more than one since it's bringing true raspberry flavor and not a bunch of syrupy junk. A nice production from New Belgium."

"Pours a clean orange-ish to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, malty and a small raspberry tartness. In the taste, a small tart raspberry and a nice caramel malt. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry tart raspberry in the aftertaste. Nice tart with big raspberry, with a decent brown ale under all of that."
""
"Served from bottle into a New Belgium globe. Poured a ruby red-orange with one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma as comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, fruit, and cream. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, cream, roasted malt, and fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly average brew. I have to be completely honest here… I really didn’t enjoy this brew too much. It wasn’t as my doppelganger’s fiancée says, “nasty crap”. But one bottle was pretty much enough for all of us drinking this one. Four of us had a bottle while spreading mulch and none of us went back for another. While it wasn’t one of the worst brews I’ve ever had, it just wasn’t nice. Wish it would have not been a brown ale as that might have saved it. But to each their own I suppose…"

"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a dark red orange amber, thin head and light lacing. Aroma of raspberries, a bit sour, slight malt. Rasberries up front with some dry malt in the middle. Finish is dry, sour, a bit bitter and not very noteable. A slight metallic aftertaste. Light to medium bodied. A miss, which is too bad; a raspberry beer would be a nice change."
""
""
""
""
""
"pours a nice deep burgandy color with just a thin head on top. fair amount of lacing from start to finish. upon prying the lid off there was an instant raspberry aroma that filled the room. the taste is very raspberry forward at first, then turns to the base beer which is not that impressive.mouthfel is lively with a good amount of carbonation. goes down smooth with a slight sour after taste. overall i'm glad i finally tried it but not looking forward to the other five in the fridge. for a fruit beer it's alright, but for a raspberry beer there are many others out there that are lots better."
""
""
""
"O- The best fruit beer I've tasted yet. The raspberry flavor is very forward, but the lack of sweetness and gentle tartness make this very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, I actually loved this brew. You get the raspberry goodness along with some brown ale characteristics. Pretty nicely integrated but would be better if the berry was toned down or the malts were amped up."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've come to expect much from New Belgium. Beers like this remind me why. It pours a fleeting- weak lace; not amazing, but pretty none the less. Holding it up to the light I'm seeing a deep-rose amber color. It smells like chocolate covered raspberries, making me hungry. It tastes like chocolate covered raspberries, sating the hunger beast. Finally, a beer that tastes like what you've come to expect. Frambozen states it's a, ""Raspberry Brown Ale"". By the gods it tastes like a Raspberry Brown Ale. Rejoice, and drink up."
""
""
""
"Overall: Unique and not something I could drink all the time"
""
"Good for a six pack every holiday season."
""
""
""
"Pours brown with a white head. Smell is largely sweet and kinda tart raspberry compote. The tartness from the aroma is not present in the flavor, instead it's a sweet, juicy raspberry flavor with the brown ale simply serving as a base. Very crisp and silky mouthfeel. Not a bad beer by any means but not a beer that did anything for me either. NB continues to keep me unimpressed when it comes to what they offer in the 6 pack format."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best before 26 Feb 2012. This pours a nice amber color with a large tan head with a nice lacing. The smells are of a little fruit, some nuts, brown sugar. The feel is medium to light. The taste is more tart than I expected, but also light, a little fruit, brown ale, okay."
"O: Overall a good beer but a little different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appears a dark red color, two finger eggshell colored head that has good retention and medium levels of lacing left behind with each sip. Smells mostly of chocolate covered raspberry cordial candies. Underneath that there is a very light yeasty and white bread aroma playing hide and seek with your nose. The flavor of the brew throws the emphasis a bit too much onto the tartness of the raspberries and de-emphasizes the chocolate malt. However, having said that, it is quite a nice change up to see a fruit beer that is not afraid to pair a darker malt with fruit...I just wish that the chocolate malt was truly allowed to display it's full potential in the flavor. Medium bodied, fairly well carbonated, almost sessionable."
""
"O - this is a nice offering from New Belgium, not an every day beer in my rotation but a good one to mix things up a bit on occasion. I was very happy with the fact that the raspberry didn't completely dominate, but had a strong presence. I will definitely pick this one up again."
"D-While not exactly my thing, I could see how some would really like this beer; it is primarily a one-note beer with raspberries being the note."
"Average mouthfeel."
""
""
"T: I don't know, this one just didn't quite do it for me. The raspberry is there, but it has a strange sourness and a bit of an off bitterness. Some malt and chocolate in the background don't help the flavor much. Wasn't really my thing."
"M: Medium-bodied, fairly smooth. If I was a fan of the fruit beers, this would probably be pretty high up there. As it is, not bad for the style, just far from my favorite style."
""
"M: Firm with some light carb. A little more body wouldn't hurt."
""
""
""
""
""
"Haven't had a ton of fruit beers but this is probably my fave. Just the right balance of fruit, you can tell it's raspberries but it's not like soda or zima (or like sucrets, which is how Boston Brewing's Cherry Wheat strikes me). Kind of on the tart side which is how I like it, a bit mouthwatering (a bit like a lambic). And also glad it's not another (primarily) wheat based fruit beer, it's a better balance to have the darker,richer malt and chocolate. Good job New Belgium!"
"O - I thought the raspberry flavor was refreshing and tart, and the appearance was nice and inviting. I wanted a bit more malty chocolaty/biscuit like flavor to balance it out a bit though. I think I'd drink it again but probably not buy again. Worth a try but it's just not something that I like allot."
"Although a nice change of pace, this beer is too fruity and tart for my taste."
"O- picked up a single bottle because I saw this beer all winter and always wanted to try it. I am glad I just got 1 bottle. This beer is ok but has no good characteristics or anything that stands out."
""
""
"Loved the looks of this beer, was OK with the smell and taste. If they are wanting to have the raspberries as the showcase in this beer, they could have still added some spices that would play along with the raspberry to give this beer some more complexity."
""
"Overall, this is a decent beer if you really like raspberries. In my opinion it's a little sweet and one dimensional."
""
"D/O: This fruit beer is easy to drink while retaining some authenticity thanks to a lack of obvious saccharine qualities. The brewer plays it safe to cultivate mass appeal, so the sensory profile tends to become repetitive--though never challenging. It is probably best served unaccompanied, or with lighter fare; it could be perfect with a soft goat's milk cheese to bring the unctuous funk that it lacks."
""
"O- One of the most balanced fruit beers I've had. You really taste the ""this is a beer that was built around this fruit, but it's still a beer"" rather than ""here's a fruity beer"". Nice job"
"Overall - For what this beer lacks in looks, it approaches redemption in the aroma and taste. A little too sweet and lacking on tartness for my liking, but in all, it does taste like a sweet, nutty brown ale with some raspberry thrown into the mix. I guess you can't fault NB for delivering what the label says."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I finally got to try this legendary effort. While it's been around the Mountain States for a while it's never made it to CA until this year and it has in a big way. If it continues to come each year, I have another beer to add to my winter seasonal must buy list."
"Beer tastes like raspberry candy, sweet, cloying, like cough syrup gross. How does it taste so much more like raspberries and not smell like them at all?"
"Body and carbonation levels are medium. The finish is fruity but also a bit tart. Overall I really liked this beer - it's unique and delicious."
"Goes down easily but don't think I would want more than a couple."
""
"Pours a medium brown color with a good head and a bit of lacing. The nose has a light amount of raspberry with some sweet malt taking up the biggest portion. Flavor has more raspberry, though it's not all that integrated with the base. Medium body with light sweetness. Boom."
"Overall, this was decent and perfect for a hot summer day."
""
"O) This was a nice winter option right here. Glad I picked up a sixer."
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer. I would of liked other elements to come out more other than the raspberries."
"M/O- smooth sweet milky raspberries in a delicious brown ale a creamy texture with a smooth finish sweet and fruity very good"
"Drinkability: It is pretty good, but it does taste and feel much more like juice than anything else."
""
"I really like the malt base on this one, and would like to try a brown from New Belgium because of it. This is a holiday beer I would gladly return to."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- I was expecting much more from this one! Very light and not at all like a Brown Ale should be... I'm giving this one an average all around rating because of the raspberry flavor that pops out. If this wasn't around, I wouldn't give this one a chance at all! Wouldn't defer anyone from getting this brew but many better from New Belgium to go for! Looking forward to finding new Lips of Faith beer!"
"I enjoyed this beer for sure."
"Pour is very dark red-brown with a tiny off-white head. It smells mostly tart, and then the taste is also tart--not all that sweet, really, but definitely like a tart, fresh berry, combined with a weak brown ale. My boyfriend says it's like they isolated all of the parts of the berry without the natural sugar. It's a little bit chocolate and toasted biscuit in the malt underneath, but that's been dialed down, and there's honestly not much development throughout the glass. That raspberry bouquet is what stays after the swallow. It's a touch light in the mouthfeel, but it's possible that a thicker beer would drown out the raspberry complexity. We both quite liked it."
"O: One of the better fruit beers I've tried. Unlike many that taste like a jolly rancher dropped into a generic lager, this has some really nice flavors going on. Had it for the first time on tap several months ago-- glad to finally have a chance to give it a review."
"O- It's an ok beer. If you really like raspberries, give it a whirl. I could enjoy one of these every so often. More then one and a half in a sitting might wear on the taste buds though."
""
"O: Could be a bit dryer, pretty sweet, a little syrupy, aftertase is bad, average drinking."
"This beer has too much raspberry for me. I'm sure some people like it, but it's overly dry, fruity, and tart for my taste. But, I think it's still worthy of a craft beer lover's attention."
""
"O: Meh, likely won't have again. Might be good warm (as in, 100 degrees with a little honey jager in it)."
"Mouthfeel is very basic, and I like it. Just right."
""
""
""
"Overall. Not bad. Would be nice on a hot day. Lots of rasberry there and not too sweet."
""
"Overall: Good bang for the buck. Interesting new beer from New Belgium. Clearly, we all know they are capable of pumping out some great beer in the Lips of Faith series, etc. This beer is not one of those beers but if you enjoy their normal yearly and seasonal lineup then you'll greatly appreciate this beer."
""
""
""
"Not a huge fan of this, but I don't hate it either. I can't stand anything that doesn't have complexity in its aroma/flavor, but the mouthfeel is alluring enough to always make me come back for another sip, which is a nice achievement."

"In honor of Overlord I poured this from the bottle into a Trinity (CO) tulip. Pours a nice deep brownish red with three fingers of slightly pink head. Smell was good. Mostly raspberries which is to be expected but it smelled more like a crate of slightly over-ripe, slightly musty raspberries instead of a handful of juicy fresh raspberries. Taste is a nice brown ale base well balanced with some tart fruitiness from the berries. Mouthfeel is nice, not too thin nor cloying with a touch of astringency. Overall this is a perfectly nice brew but doesn't really bring anything new to the table."

"not usually a fruit beer guy, but this brown ale packs a perfect mix of tart (NOT SWEET) raspberry fruit with some excellent caramel malts and the new belgium classic yeast notes. nose is sharp and puckery, with an boozey malty backbone. more balanced fruit in the taste, with a really smooth finish. this is a very sessionable beer and will be in my fridge again during this holiday season. a clever beer from new belgium, well done"
"D - The New Belgium folk almost pulled this one off, but it falls short. Not a bad beer, but you could easily find better fruit offerings."
"Having enjoyed this one a lot when I lived in San Diego (I found it in a suburb of Phoenix) and again when I first moved to Denver, I rashly bought a case. I think I gave away 5 or 8 bottles to a hooker, but I digress. poured a clear dark reddish brown with a large lasting tan head. Aromas of raspberry and cocoa. Palate was light bodied, smooth and a bit tart. Flavors of raspberry and a bit of cocoa with a smooth slightly tart finish."
"Overall I thought this was an interesting beer; however the sweetness was too much for it to be as robust as it should be."
"Aside from the powerful fruit nose, it's a subtle experience. I can see why some may not like the flavor, but I look forward to it every year as a favorite Christmas seasonal, an alternative to the dark raisin bombs."
"Mouthfeel of brown sugared watered down promises."
"Cheers!"
"I liked the beer. One of the better fruit beers I've had. Is a good beer any time, but would make a fabulous warm weather beer."
"Thank you chugalug06 for this beer as an extra in a great trade!"
"O: Overall this was a light crisp and somewhat refreshing fruit beer,my first fruit beer and although It's not my favorite style I would drink it again as a desert beer or a night cap."
"The beer pours a dark brown with some red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the syrupy raspberry and is very sweet overall. I also get a little bit of caramel malt but it is hidden behind the sugary fruit notes. The flavor is more of the same. There is a lot of raspberry and sugar, with a little bit of caramel malt. The beer tastes nice, but it is very sweet and gets hard to drink as you go along. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I really enjoyed this offering as it was different than anything I had ever had. Highly recommend!!"
"Overall-truthfully I've grown accustomed to some of the fruit themed beers and this doesn't seem all that good. Better belgian fruit beers out there."
"Enjoyable and quite worthy."
"D - not bad for starting or ending an evening."
"D - Not exactly what I was hoping for or expecting, but not bad. The fruit doesn't seem that well integrated into the overall flavors and seems a bit artificial. Not bad, but could have been so much more."
"Pours a wonderful ruby-brown with wonderful head and excellent lacing. Nice deep scent with hints of roastiness under a very nice sweet raspberry aroma. Great taste, a wonderful malty and thick sweetness with a bit of nice roastiness to it, and a great sweet raspberry flavor; very much like a chocolate covered raspberry. Goes down very, very smooth. A wonderful brew."
"drinkable - one, maybe two if you want a sugar high."
"D: Sorry New Belgium, this is just not good."
"It's always going to be tough to approach raspberry flavored beers after you've had NG Raspberry Tart. This just can't come close."
"The brown ale adds a few woody notes but other than that it can't stand up to the fruit."
"Drinkability-Tasty and interesting, but I doubt that I could drink more than one in a sitting."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew, pretty close-tasting to other top fruit beers that I've tried before, but not very complex."
"D: above average for a fruit beer."
"**This added later. After trying again, I noticed allowing the beer to warm up more than your average brown ale helps balance the tart a lot."
"drinkability is bad - if the taste is not there why would i want to drink it - i only drank 4oz just so i could finish this review"
"Overall, an excellent fruit beer. Highly recommend. Avail here in TX as seasonal release. Rotation - the raspberry flavor is strong so one at a time is enough. I enjoy the flavor so will get a couple each season. [O;O]"
"Becuase it's a safe middle ground this is a very drinkable beer good intro to craft holiday beers"
"I could have used a heavier beer with more maltose to support the raspberries and give it a fuller texture, but still pretty good."
"This ale pours a beautiful crystal-clear ruby color with an off-white head. The aroma is moderately malty--nutty and toasty with a pleasant fresh raspberry aroma. The flavor is a nice marriage of tart raspberry and nutty malts. The finish is crisp and clean with a bit of tart raspberry lingering. The carbonation is moderate and body medium. Overall this is a very flavorful and well crafted beer that can be drunk all night."
"Note - the tanginess does seem to build after awhile, and this gets a bit old in that last couple of ounces. Still, quite a tasty beer overall."
"A great take on a fruit beer, as so many these days are limited to wits and blondes. If in the mood, I would not hesitate to purchase this brew again, because, c'mon, each sip is like taking a bite of chocolate covered cherries."
"For me not so much, but well executed."
"D: I'm torn on this. Since I only have one bottle, I can't be sure if what I'm tasting is consistent with what NB was going for, or if it's a bad bottle. I might try one other bottle (or a taste of somebody else's) just to make sure, but I won't buy any more than that unless the second taste wows me. That being said, it is a fairly drinkable beer that would be good for people who don't like beer, and if they liked it, I could easily see them drinking a few bottles as it's not cloyingly sweet like other fruit/dessert beers."
"The mouth is just above average with some sharp carbonation. While this is an easy beer to drink, I would only have one or two per night. I will be adding this one to Holiday beer rotation."
"Poured red with a short tan head and smelled of intense raspberry fruit. The body is a little thinner than the good framboises I've had from Belgium, but it wasn't sweet and thin either. The rich fruit carries over to the flavor and finishes with a quick dark bready malt character. This beer is maybe a little too balanced. A little more acidity could make it interesting."
"D -- It's better than some, but not as good as others."
"D - very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. I could drink plenty of this. Its definitely not the best beer i've ever had but it has nice flavor and is way drinkable"
"I liked the beer overall but I'm not sure how many I could drink before growing weary of it... A good novelty Christmas brew that. I wil enjoy having during the holidays but were it a year rpund offering I'd probably pass up.."
"Overall, this is an ok beer but it seems to be a bit one dimensional and a little bit too sweet for my taste."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability are ok (3/5 on both). This beer is full of mediocrity in my opinion."
"The flavor is interesting. It has a very bready flavor, almost overpowering, a rye-like flavor. The rasberry is there with some tartness. It just seems like the two flavors don't really mesh. The mesh better as it goes, but that underlying bready/roasty/bitterness keeps it form being an awesome beer."
"Drinkability - Quite quaffable. I had my father smell/try this and he (who is not really into craft beer except when I make him try my stuff) told me to get a six pack of this for Christmas. This is a nice holiday beer and glad I was able to try it. Hope I can find some more to enjoy with family on Christmas."
"So I finally got to have a Frambozen again after nearly 5 years. Sadly, it wasn't as good as I remembered it being, but it was still decent. I poured it from the bottle into a tulip shaped glass. The appearance is rich brown with a hint of red. Pretty nice to look at. The smell is like...Fat Tire with lots of raspberries. Bu the taste was, well, not that great. Raspberries are present in the beginning, along with biscuity malts, but then it gets kind of sour. The sour finish keeps me from drinking more than one or two of these at a time. I figure I will buy another 6 pack next winter, but one 6 pack a year will definitely do it for me."
"This beer smelled great but didn't quite give the sweetness and fruitiness expected. Pretty decent but nothing too great."
"overall - I don't know if its just because I am spoiled with NG Raspberry Tart or what, but this is clearly raspberry syrup. I don't care if the website says they use real raspberries. Maybe they use 10% real and 90% artificial flavoring. Its not a horrible beer, but its far from a good one, especially from a brewery that knows how to make good beer. I won't buy this again, and I didn't finish even the half bottle pour I had."
"Mouthfeel: Luscious, creamy, and not surprisingly very sweet as well. So sweet it will be hard to drink another one."
"Interesting beer. I like the flavors. Still working with how well they balance and compliment. I'm intrigued enough to want another. That's a good thing."
"D - Definitely drinkable. A nice beer for sure. It delivers what it promises. I wish I didn't pick up on that funny taste that I can't quiet place but otherwise pretty enjoyable."
"Overall a great beer, and was excited I bought the last one out of the cooler! Would recommend trying at least once!"
"Definitely worth a shot and easy to drink more than one on a cold evening."
"D-I don't hate it but I don't love it either. It was good but it didn't wow me like I had hoped it would. Considering what NBB can do with fruit beers this one disappointed me."
"Pours a pretty reddish brown with a little tan head and good lacing. Smells of tart raspberries, sweet chocolate, and a fair amount of sweet malts. Tastes very balanced. Full on assault of raspberries rounded out by a little chocolate, some hops, and some sweet malts. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is nice. Drinkability is high."
"It's pretty nice. If they were to do one thing with this beer, it would be to blend with a small amount of lambic. That would make this beer so much better."
"I will admit I'm not the biggest fruit beer fan but found this to be far superior to stuff like Sam Adams Cherry Wheat."
"Overall this beer is fruity and easy to drink with a nice balance between sweet and tart, though it lacks some of the complexities that I enjoy in winter seasonals and fruit beers. I wouldn't turn one down if offered to me, but this beer wasn't great."
"Drinkability -- I'm not in love, let's put it that way. The obvious comparison to make with Frambozen is New Glarus' Raspberry Tart, which is considerably superior. I can forgive a fruit beer that isn't very complex, but it better taste like the best raspberries of the season. This, however, tastes like malta + cheap raspberry cordial. I think the real deal breaker with this beer is the mouthfeel, like cheap soda."
"Drinkability: Pretty damn good for a Fruit Beer, which isn't really my thing. While I couldn't drink much of this, it is a nice sipping brew."
"Overall this is pretty good. The fruitiness and tartness detract from repetitively drinking this for me."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"This would be a good beer to introduce someone to sour beers."
"D: Light enough to be drinkable in spite of its taste, but why would you? This is possibly a worse attempt at a raspberry beer than Fort."
"Bottle. Poured into a New Belgium tulip glass, very fitting! Pours a clear raspberry red copper color with a 1 and a half finger off white head that has a slight reddish hue to it. Raspberry flavor fills my nostrils on my first smell, not overly so but pretty subtle. Some light roast notes as well. The taste is similiar to the smell in that the raspberry is pretty sublte but noticeable. Nice lace left on the glass as I drink this down. As fruit beer I would like to see this more fruit forward instead of being so subtle. The alcohol isn't really present at all and I would have no idea it was 7%. Medium mouthfeel."
"D: A well made, drinkable fruit beer."
"This is an interesting and tasty beer-- I like it, except for the feel."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a small amount of carbonation."
"D-- Excellent. One of my favorite Christmas seasonals. ABV is up from previous years but still well hidden and easy to drink 2-3 in a sitting. Perfect for a sitting next to a fire. Good to have again."
"2010: 6.50% ABV--16 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Big foamy lacy lasting pink head. Clear bright red raspberry brown rich deep red color. Mild raspberry light toasted cocoa mild hop aromatic front. Zesty crisp dry mild citrus sweet sour hint soft toasted chocolate malt tangy festy smooth raspberry body. Dry clean rich refreshing raspberry citus mild hop end. Rich Seasonal Brown Ale. Sampled 11/11-12/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $10.99 @ Ballard, Seattle Fred Meyer on 11/11/2010."
"D- this is more of a novelty beer than something i would want to drink with any sort of consistency. however, it is well done. id check this one if you like beers that are reminiscent of candy."
"12oz bottle into a tulip glass pours a dark pinkish brown with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is slight raspberry in front of dark malts. The taste is an interesting blend of sweet raspberries and subtle dark malts. The beer is fairly light with subtle carbonation. I suppose this one was worth trying, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"D: well balanced, nice fruited brown ale. Nothing earth shattering ( Like Eric's ale, La Folie, or Love) but good nonetheless."
"Its fully drinkable but not up to par with some of the other raspberry beers out there as in the Tart from NG."
"Pours a ruby color with mahogany highlights and a pink tinged tan head that retains well and leaves beautiful lacing...really impressive looking. The aroma has fresh, tart raspberry notes in spades, along with dark chocolate and toffee, sour cherry juice and a bit of alcohol...not particularly complex but very inviting nonetheless. The flavor is reminiscent of a dark chocolate truffle with a raspberry filling, notes of sour cherries and raspberries, some chocolate and toffee, lactic sourness, NB's trademark yeast, biscuit and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is good but just shy of great because of the acidity. The is a particularly tasty offering from New Belgium, not a training wheels fruit beer by any means...probably my favorite offering from this brewery so far."
"D- This was a good beer. The malt base that New Belgium uses almost kills this beer though. The ABV is well hidden along with most raspberry flavors in the ending of this beer. Almost a complete joy but oh so far away."
"D. Very drinkable. Higher ABV for the style but you wouldn't know it by drinking it. Goes down very easy. Something good to look forward to during winter."
"Tastes better than I remember the rest of the six-pack tasting a month or so ago, seems like the flavors have melded together a bit more of the sweetness in the beer has come out to play. I remember the fruit vying for attention with an unnecessary hop content and darker malts, the latter still being the case. The tartness of the raspberries seems to be a bit much and there is not a whole lot of sweetness going on here to help balance it out. I am on the fence with this beer, one sip I think it is pretty tasty and then the next not so much. I guess it is just one of those beers I do not want much more than one in a sitting and there are plenty of other fruit beers out there I like better. Still, not bad, and quite an intriguing and thought provoking beer for me."
"D: Very well done. There is a fair bit going on but nothing overly dominates and it all works well together. Not even a hint cloying. Complex and interesting while remaining quite drinkable. As others have said, a good balance between beer and fruit on the fruit-beer scale."
"A nice seasonal session beer. Easy drinking, not overpowering at all."
"Mouthfeel not bad but a bit thin, IMO. Easy to drink with interesting flavor until I got really tired of the overpowering berry. I've got mixed feelings about it, but overall, not a bad brew."
"Too often I'm disappointed by fruit beers, but this is head and shoulders above the average. Raspberries well-integrated into a nice brown ale. Not syrupy or artificial at all...not overly sweet... I would look forward to this winter seasonal if it were available in my area!"
"Note: This is by no means a Frambozen. I was given the bottle and initially thought that it was an attempt by New Belgium to brew a Lambic, but quickly realized that it was nothing of the sort. The same type of mislabeling as calling Bud Light a ""Vienna Lager""."
"D: nice, friendly beer; good way to introduce ""dark"" and ""tart"" beers"
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/5 inch head of a pink-cream color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of raspberry, sweet malt, yeast, and slight earthy aroma. Fits the style of Fruit / Vegetable Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and smooth with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight roasted malt, sweet malt, yeast, and raspberries. Overall, smooth, good blend, and nice body."
"serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: this is quite a drinkable beer. When I'm in the mood for a fruit beer this is what I'm usually seeking: a good base beer with just a little natural fruit added."
"Overall, a solid fruit beer but lacking in complexity and mouthfeel. If you're into fruit beers (not fruit lambics mind you), this one is okay. Not my favorite by any means however."
"Copper amber body, 1/4 finger white head quick dissipation with a bit of lacing. Big berry presence in the nose, a bit of bready malts, not much in the way of hops, though they became more noticeable after warming. The taste is berries, berries, berries, a bit of hops but they are overwhelmed by the raspberries. Smooth mouthfeel, decent carbonation. Too sweet to drink more than one bottle. An interesting holiday ale, but not something I'd drink outside the holiday season."
"D: The flavor is good. But would be a little much after one or two."
"Less raspberry action than expected but I think that's what I liked about it."
"pour is that of a reddish ale... flemish red in tone without any cloudiness. large head with large bubbles that fade. nose of yeast protein... then opens of into nice smokey earthy brown ale. palate is quite earthy and nice but lacks a lot of volume of the palate... mild sweet. some raspberry. citrus hop if any resembles of sour. not a sour ale at all but curious to see what would happen with a year of two of aging... overall decent accented brown ale."
"D- This beer would become tiring quickly; the tartness would quickly lead to palate fatigue and would overpower the next beer. Best enjoyed as a one-beer treat with good friends and family at Christmas time."
"Drink ability is pretty good. Cant believe this beer is 6.5% abv, very session able. Was hoping that the beer would have more flavors of a brown ale to go with the fruitiness but unfortunately it doesnt."
"D- For me, I couldn't have much more then one of these at a time. It just has some weird aftertastes that just kind don't do it for me. But for what it is, this is a beer I can see myself having with a fruity desert."
"The sour finish is quite good very malty.. For a beer of a complexity like this one i think New Belgium has hit a home run this year.. There are many ways to mess up a fruit beer.. New Belgium Frambozen has been a constant for me year after year.."
"Pours a brown sugar color with a raspberry hue. Seriously the body of foam is tinted pink like a lambic but with much smaller bubbles. Nose is all raspberries dusted with fresh brown sugar. Same character in the taste, like a well crafted brown ale with a raspberry finish. Nice and malty as it starts and adds a tart finish from the fruit. Only a couple things going on in this beer, not too complex but done right. Luscious mouthfeel, medium and not too bubbly. A great holiday beer, I need to go back and get the six pack."
"Medium bodied and soft, with just a touch of fruity acidic bite. A well-made, enjoyable beer. Seems like it'd be a good match for a traditional Thanksgiving feast."
"D: This is a nice holiday offering. The sweetness gives the beer an after dinner character that would go well with dessert. The raspberry flavor could stand being toned down just a touch for my tastes."
"Good holiday beer for a raspberry fan who happens to like brown ales."
"D: Very drinkable, one of the best fruit beers that I've had."
"The taste is heavily toasted bread, hints of caramel, hint of red wine,tart raspberry that is most prominent in the finish, followed by bread and a cracker aftertaste. It is mostly sweet-tart and toasty ."
"Deep clear copper color with an ecru/pink head that leaves some nice lacing. Smells like chocolate cake with raspberry icing. Tastes a lot like the icing with some cocoa and bread crust character. Even a little bit of roast. Pretty sweet overall with a touch of tartness, would work well as a dessert. Light and airy with high carbonation. Sticky mouthfeel but still drinkable."
"Had some balance issues with the chocolate and raspberry on this one. I can't put my finger on ideas for improvement but the balance of the two flavors in this beer did not work for me as much as I was hoping for (I do like the combination)."
"Conclusion: Other than traditional Belgian lambics, this is probably the best fruit beer I've tried...good job NB"
"Good enough to have a few as they are not too sweet and have a good beer backbone but this beer would be great if it just had a little more carbonation in it."
"D - Surprisingly low. I kinda like this beer, but somehow don't want another. I want something fuller, with more character."
"Drinkability is a good, and this is a pretty tasty fruit beer. I like that it's not overly sweet or fruity, but I would have liked this one to have a few more ""beer"" flavors."
"Really impressed with the NBB Frambozen this year. A rich brown in color, a beige head, with a strong smell of raspberry and a slight smell of sourness. This translates right to the palate with a rich yet sweet tasting beer that leaves a slight tartness in the mouth at the finish. A very drinkable beer that has turned into my favorite this holiday season. I have found that you can have 4-5 and not be bogged down with the sweetness that tends to accompany many fruit beers. A great balance of malty-ness with the sweet and sour. I highly recommend."
"Suprisingly good, with berries resting upon the outer edges of the tongue, providing a relaxing and interesting take on the season."
"Verdict: Frambozen is a solid and unique fruit beer; nothing more, nothing less. A nice change of pace as far as holiday seasonals go, there's a good chance that I'll be picking up another six-pack of this next winter."
"6/3/7/3/14/3.3"
"Overall: This beer was good, but as I have already said, a little too biscuitty for me. New Belgium should lay off that flavor just a little."
"D - This is pretty good. I found it to be more enjoyable with a meal (a good steak) compared to drinking it alone."
"The taste is more strawberry than raspberry, and to me it tasted like strawberry soda. I'm sure it will be a hit with the ladies who think they are beer drinkers. That being said, I didn't think the strawberry flavor was overpowering. It was very pronounced and I couldn't taste the ale, but no, not overpowering."
"Easy drinking."
"Pours a ruby-red/mahogany brown color with a pinkish-thin head. Was lacking my sense of smell while tasting (sad, I know) but I could catch the heavy raspberry notes along with decent maltiness as well. Slightly sour tartness as well. Syrupy and sweet and a great partner to my delicious thanksgiving day meal/meals. Drinkability is good but wouldn't want to go overboard. A great beer to share with friends."
"Pours a very dark red/brown color body, with a medium sized head, off-white/light tan color, average diminishing, average lacing. Aroma of semi-sweet raspberries, hops. Strong taste of raspberry, tart, light sugary aftertaste. Sweet, not very complex flavor, but refreshing."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but I still don't think I want more then 1 at a time. While not my favorite style, the raspberry went well with the Belgian style brown ale. I wish this had been a sour brown instead, but I didn't expect that when I bought it and do not hold it against them."
"Drinkable. Raspberry flavor really controls the flavor, where a touch more malt flavor and nuttiness of a Northern brown would compliment this one."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Toasted grain and mildly tart berries - this tastes somewhat like one of those healthful breakfast cereals with freeze dried berries in it. There's a touch of chocolate, mild caramel sweetness and light acidity. Medium-light in body, rather dry on the whole actually. Not a bad brew, but something's missing here - depth of flavor I suppose? It's certainly decent, but it sounds better on paper. I could see this being good if executed better."
"overall a nice fruity brew."
"Not bad on the whole. Nothing amazing, and I could see this one going well (and being a bit more enjoyable) with food. Not sure I would want to drink more than one or two, although it's clean and smooth enough that I could."
"I hadn't had this in a while, and I found it much better than I remembered."
"D--It's good, but bring a friend and have some with a meal rather than buy a six pack for a nightly beer or two."
"Bought a sixer of this at the local Nugget. Pours a crimson red with hints of brown. Nice white head that sticks around lengthily. Smells of raspberries, not surprisingly, and a nice subtle dark chocolate. Flavor resembles the aroma...tart raspberries up front with a touch of chocolate. Raspberry lingers well, but becomes a bit rich on the finish for my liking. medium mouthfeel with a hint of syrup. Drinks well, nice in what passes for winter out here in CA."
"D: fairly nice, this is probably my favorite dessert beer. hands down my favorite seasonal from NB. I wish it were distributed a little more outside of Colorado. A fine beer, and definitely a reminder that Christmas is upon us."
"D: Very drinkable, but the sweetness would eventually catch up withi me. An interestingly pleasant beer."
"Drinkability is very good for a fruit beer but I really enjoy it as an end-of-the-evening sort of treat."
"D - very drinkable not too sweet for me"
"I sure wish I could get something from New Belgium in Ohio. :("
"Thanks to tayner for the bottle...she's the greatest."
"A solid fruit based beer from New Belgium. This is my first sampling of it and I wouldn't hesitate to try it again. As I work through the bottle the sweetness seems to grow, so one bottle is plenty in a sitting but it's an all around good beer."
"Drinkability: Awesome. My new favorite raspberry beer. Perfect sweetness. Quenching and satisfying. Could easily stand alone as an aperitif or dessert."
"164 reveiws as of this writing. I will say to start I'm not the biggest fan of raspberries. I found this brew to be pleasant. On the sweeter side of things, sort of like a breakfast treat. I wouldn't mind it being a touch tarter but it's nice as is."
"Dark maroon to black pour with a dirty beige head with a pinkish hue. Smell is very nice. Fresh raspberries, a touch of tartness, and light brown ale like maltiness. Flavor is surprisingly nice. Very lightly tart and sweet fresh raspberry flavor, good rich mouthfeel and maltiness. Brown ale flavor in the finish a touch, and some sweet/tart raspberries in the after taste along with a hint of chocolate. Kind of like a raspberry truffle, but never cloying. Easily my favorite fruit beer, and a new Winter favorite."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very light body; however, the beer never is watery. The carbonation is active and seems to fit well. This beer has a nice balance of sweetness and tartness. A very nice beer treat that I wish came to Cincinnati."
" This is pretty high quality stuff, but still not enough to make me go for one more."
"D: I would definitely drink this one again and would share it with my friends too."
"Pretty well done for a fruit beer. This would pair well with some mild cheese and nuts."
"A serviceable fruit beer, but nothing to especially seek out."
"I was told that this beer was better in past years but I can offer no complaints for 2007's incarnation. I just wish I had tried this beer before Christmas so I could have enjoyed many more over the holidays."
"D - This certainly wasn't what I was expecting..which if very cool..I can't say that I would want this all the time or even more than one in a sitting but it's certainly a nice diversion from the normal and a very easy drinking beer"
"Edited review after drinking the brew with a fresh palate. Smelled and tasted a bit of lactose-like sourness. Still a good brew, just lowered the whoop-whoop a little."
"This poured dark ruby with a nice head on it. It smelled primarily of raspberry and and some malts. It tasted like raspberry all over, it was a little syrupy tasting. It has a bitter/tart after taste to it. Overall, it was a pretty decent fruit beer...it paired very well with white chocolate..."
"Although I find this disappointing, it is drinkable. I could see it being particularly good with sweeter fruit or chocolate desserts - something to contrast the tartness of the beer."
"Drinkability: A solid raspberry fruit beer, but one helping is definitely enough for me."
"I really have grown to like this beer. It's not something for every day, but on a cold snowy weekend I nearly finished a growler by myself."
"Thanks, Oxymoron, for the pleasure and cannabanaceae, for the second opportunity"
"D- Really easy to drink as a nice refreshing beer. I wouldn't mind more of this one at all. My 6-pack went very fast."
"Poured from bottle into chalice. Pours a dark amber and appears ruby when held to a light. A one finger, off white head forms that doesnt last long at all, no lacing left behind either. I have to say of the handful of raspberry beers I've had this tastes the most like fresh raspberrys and not just some extract additive. One review summed it up perfectly by saying that when its cooler you notice more of a tart raspberry but as it warms a chocolate flavor emerges. Now I hate to sample from someone else's review but they hit the nail on the head. Either way the raspberry flavor is great and tastes fresh, a little too much on the tart side but overall good. Mouthfeel is suprisingly light and almost crisp. A pretty clean taste is left behind and the slightly higher alcohol content is not noticable. Overall a good beer and could see drinking this year round."
"This was an enjoyable beer. I just bought a single but wish I had another. Not really a dinner beer, more of an after dinner beer."
"The tart raspberry taste can be a bit overwhelming to some, but it didn't bother me. A very unique beer that will either be a hit or miss, depending on individual tastes."
"Ten minutes after finishing the beer, I can still taste the tart raspberries."
"A good beer to try once, but I'll pass on it next year."
"D: This is a very easy drinking fruit beer and should please many people."
"Drinks pretty easy, a lot better than most fruit beers, this one I could enjoy for 3 or 5! This a solid offering this year!"
"make it an ideal session brew."
"Brown with shades of red, NIce tan head with a ruby tint. The smell is of a classic brown ale and fresh raspberries. The taste is well balance with sweet malts and tart berries. Well carbonated and a light body give a nice mouthfeel. It s a crisp brew that is very drinkable and refreshing."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a chalice. Poured a dark red with a nice size (2 inch) tan head. Leaves very little lacing down the glass. The aroma is enticing with raspberry, and a sourness that stays in the back of the nostril. Part of it is the raspberries natural tartness but some of it is just the style of the beer. The best part of this beer is in the finish. It finishes with the taste of chocolate. It is amazing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation, allowing for a lingering taste even after you finished the beer. The drinkability is exceptional. If it was nonalcoholic I think I could drink a case in a sitting."
"Another good seasonal from NB."
"Well this beer lives up to its label completely. The color is brown with red tints and I swear the off-white head had a tinge of pink to it, hallucination maybe? It smells like a brown ale should with slight hints of the raspberries. The first taste is good and makes me think of raspberry flavored chocolate. This beer teases you with only the slightest tart flavor hiding, must have sour! I have heard others say this has too much raspberry but I disagree. This is a fine beer from New Belgium."
"Pours a nice clear dark amber/ruby red color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy head, some nice islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of some malts, but mostly raspberry. The taste is a little sour/bitter and a nice touch of raspberry, the finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Drinkable, a very nice beer from New Belgium."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a shaker glass. Appears a nice mahogany reddish brown with about an inch of light brown foam. Smells of raspberries with slightly nutty notes. Tastes of crisp, tart raspberries, with a nice level of sweetness to balance out the tartness. Nuttiness comes through towards the finish. Moderate carbonation, crisp and rather refreshing. I wish I had another."
"D: Good beer but one of those that I can only drink one of at a time. Too fruity to be more than a nice after holiday dinner drink with dessert."
"Frambozen is a great looking deep garnet color with a quarter inch mocha colored head. The aroma is primarily raspberries with a malty background. The taste is similar to the aroma; a big raspberry flavor with a malty background, but there is a pronounced tartness as well. It has a similar body to a raspberry beer I made myself in that it is thinner than I would like. Apparently it takes more after the raspberry side than the brown ale side. Overall though, I like it and would drink it again...if I could get my hands on it."
"D - Quite easy to drink. Nothing too outstanding, but pretty much what one would expect from a raspberry ale. Reminds me of a raspberry and vanilla cola. I can see how this might be just a little too sweet for some people, as it was almost borderline for myself."
"D: Moderate abv and nice subtle fruit taste make this a good one. The tartness of the raspberry is what keeps me going back for a sip."
"Pours out a reddish brown with a somewhat thin yet frothy off-white pinkish head. Leaves some spotty lacing. When held up to direct light it resembles a deeper tawny port. Nose is faintly sweetish and of raspberries, but the strongest aromas that come out are of the roasted and toasted malts. A bit of cocoa is in there as well. Malt flavor is at first toasty and cocoa-like then moves into a raspberry sweetness and tartness. Finishes nice and dry. Only strike against this is that the malt body kind of thins out before the finish, but it tastes good overall. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, the carbonation is just fine. Not too prickly. Flavor has a bit of richness yet finishes lighter and refreshing/dry/tart, making this highly drinkable. Definately one of the better fruit beers to have."
"A definite must try for those who do not like sweet fruit beers. To me this OK but not really great. It is nice and all but I would expect more complexity."
"I really enjoyed this one, it's a very unique beer. This is a great desser treat for anybody, and is probably a good beginner beer. Highly recommended."
"This is definitely a raspberry beverage. Fairly balanced. Modest and refreshing, a nice drink. It would have been great for thanksgiving."
"Note, this review was made when I didnt know jack sh*t about beer."
"Decent beer, but it becomes a little to sweet to drink more than one."
"I like this beer reasonably well, and am not unhappy that I had to buy a six pack to get it, but I wouldn't buy it all the time. As with many of NB's offerings, I can't shake the sense that they are undercutting quality, malt bills, and hop bills to keep pumping out the product and maintain/build the market share."
"A fine winter seasonal, sure to please beer afficionados and family members who like fruity concoctions as well. One by the fire is great, but I don't think it would make a good session beer for me."
"Opinion: This beer isn't too bad for what it is...a raspberry brown ale. The fruit is a bit much in that it dries the beer out to the point that it really accentuated the other characteristics of the beer. I am not a big fan of sweet fruit beers, but this one could use a bit more sweetness to keep the finish a little more balanced. It's not bad, but still not my favorite. I would try this beer again, because I imagine that when they do it again that it will go down a little smoother. A beer like this is hard to make."
"Mouthfeel is sweet up front, leading to tartness in a somewhat thin textured medium body."
"(Z. Wood)"
"D - Very nice drinkability. This is one of my favorite winter beers."
"D - A tasty fruit beer. Nicely balanced."
"Draught. Brilliant red color, with a light hints of pink in the head. A nice vibrant and enticing fruitiness in the nose with the malt base barely noticable and the raspberries taking everything over. Light in body, faintly hopped with notes of raspberries, fruits and a touch of chocolate and caramel. A bit dull in the aroma and a bit sweet. An ok brew."
"Unlike some other raspberry-oriented beers, Frambozen takes a more even-handed approach, striving for the proper dosage of raspberry and malt. Unfortunately, I think the result is at times muddled. It's okay but certainly short of amazing."
"Overall: It's like drinking a raspberry shortcake...Excellent dessert beer and one that has renewed my interest in fruit beers."
"If you like the raspberry and chocolate combination, this is for you. Perhaps more of that taste than some beers actually labeled as raspberry chocolate ale. Not terrifically complex, but soft, delicate and refined. I loved it. Thanks to my girlfriend Kristi for bringing a few bottles of this back from San Francisco. Probably one of the best fruit-infused brews out there."
"Pours a deep red hue with hints of light browns and oranges. Crown is good sized and a bit pillowy, disappates slowly clings to the sides of the glass. A steady stream of tiny bubbles rise to the top. Aroma is very nice, raspberry right up front, then a solid helping roasted malts and just a hint of hops. The taste is wonderful. A solid roasted malt flavor up front, quickly followed by delicious sweet and tart raspberry and hints of hops down the back of my tongue. A medium bodied beer with a nice complex flavor. Very nice mouthfeel for a beer I could definately see myself drinking many more of."
"Aroma is mostly fresh real raspberries. Not puree. Very slight heartier malt notes beneath the sweetness. Ruby colored with a thin white film for a head. Probably shouldnt have had this after the New Glarus Raspberry Tart it just ruins other raspberry beers for my palate. Very light raspberry notes with a solid pumpernickel-tinged malt base. I really cant taste any alcohol so the 7% is completely masked. Palate gets very thin, but the finish is lasting and a nice raspberry/malt mix."
"cheers..."
"Brownish red in color, good clarity. The short head of foam dissipates quickly. Smell is bright with rapspberry and caramel malt. Almost smells like peanut butter and jelly. Taste is tart raspberry, bready, raisiny. Low hop flavor and no real bitterness. Alcohol doesn't seem that high. It doesn't coat the palate but its still not too thin. Carbonation is decent. Its a nice fruity, winter beer. A bit tart, but interesting as a brown ale with raspberries. Its nothing like a lambic which I had expected. Worth a try from one of my favorite breweries..."
"I have tried this beer before and been underwhelmed, but if you can still get your hands on some of this year's you really should. Apparently the rasberry crop was special this year and it really shows. I'm on like my third six of this, we've been having fun baking with it. Do not pair it with rasberry chocolate by the way, they just cancel eachother out."
"Drinkability: By far the most interesting brown ale I've had. Nothing off but nothing outstanding. Highly sessionable and not a ""raspberry punch in the face"" like other fruit beers that are out there. Worth a try for sure."
"It has a beautiful dark ruby color, with a good lace. Head poured almost perfectly. A slight berry-nut smell. It is a very watery thin beer with a slight nut-chalk flavor. A very minimal raspberry taste as well. The taste didnt last veryl\ long either. Hence, the thin watery feel. I would of liked just a tad more berry flavor to it."
"The body was light to medium. Some smoothness but mostly tart with a touch of bitterness. I would have like to see more malt but this is one of the better fruit beers out there."
"Am i crazy that i thought this was an excellent brew? it did not have great head on it, but it was really good. it has some brown, nutty aftertaste, but the raspberry wasnt' too strong nor overwhelming. it wasn't too sweet either. i'm not too keen on raspberry beers (cept purple haze w/ some mudbugs) but this is really good and refreshing. just don't order one w/ the buds b/c its delicate and not too fully flavored."
"Drinkability is the one thing that I don't feel deserves at least a 4. It's good, but I can only take so much. Thus it makes a good seasonal... you like it when it comes out and by the time it's gone, you're sick of it anyway; but if it were around all the time I would probably be more likely to pass it up. No ridiculous cravings such as with other notable holiday releases, which could be good or bad depending on how you read into it."
"Mouth is very tart and crisp, the carbs pack a punch and will awaken your taste buds. Very tangy, but perhaps a bit to sweet, you just cant drink more that 2 before your mouth starts puckering up."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of fruity beers really at all. I can see myself drinking this once in a while I suppose, however not more than 1-2 at a time, it was really too sweet for me. I bet this beer would be real good in some sort of marinade or paired with something else while cooking."
"overall a nice dessert beer, sipping beer, or something that would be wondeful served with some turkey or pork and cranberry."
"There seems to be this odd trend of bashing NBB lately, just because they have become quite successful from a buisness standpoint. Well bollocks to that! This is a well crafted beer from a brewery that should be a shining example of what American craft brewers are capable of. Enjoy!"
"About as good as it gets for a non-lambic Frambozen. In a chalice it offered up a nice muted malt smell and a hint of the raspberry to come. There is now sweetness to this assertive beer which makes it great and the cringe of tannins which can be present are also put to rest. Simply a great belgian very slightly tart brown with a blossom of raspberry flavors all coated in a soft fluff of chocolate. Masterfully done. Bravo New Belgium."
"Not only does it have a very flavorful, well balanced raspberry aroma & taste, but there are amazing chocolate undertones to this beer. Literally like drinking a chocolate covered raspberry. Absolutely delicious. And not sicky sweet like you might think. Very smooth and easy going down. An absolute CRAFT beer. Truly a joy to drink. I wish I had a case."
"Maybe I had too many pop wines in my youth."
"The taste is a wonderful mix of raspberry and malt and works so darn well, it's hard to put the glass down. I've enjoyed this brew for many years and will continue to as long as NB wants to brew it. ;^)"
"Honestly, one of the best raspberry beers I've had to date. It's a difficult fruit to work with and this beer is a quality product. I'm amazed they got such vivid malt character to mix so well with the difficult raspberry."
"The color is a cloudy ruby brown. The creamy head is a bit on the small side, but the light brown color is interesting due to a slight pink tint. The aroma is of fresh raspberries, definently not an extract smell, with an underlying toasted malt body. The taste has plenty of fresh raspberry flavor upfront, with all the tart and sweet nuances that you'd get if you had just popped a berry in your mouth. The underlying malt is ever present, with a flavor similar to Fat Tire, and serves as an excellent balance to the unique raspberry flavor. This is the best fruit beer that I've had, for raspberry fans this is a must try brew."
"This is a fantastic beer. I only picked up a sixpack of it, but I'm definitely going back to get more before its all gone."
"Overall: A pretty nice beer - which kind of surprises me because I've never been too big on fruit beers; however, this isn't overbearing in it's sweetness like fruit-flavored beverages I've had. Seems to be almost a mix between one of those and an un-fruited beer."
"Should go very well with dark chocolate deserts."
"This is very drinkable overall--a nicely balanced fruit beer that is heavy enough to be enjoyed as a winter seasonal."
"I was very impressed with the look of this beer as I poured it from the bottle, nice thick looking texture very deep red almost purple hues from this one. The smell is fruity, that is about it, nothing special, very present but not to impressive. I may have raised the taste a little high on this one, I typically do not enjoy fruit based beers but this one has a nice hop balance to the fruit base. A nice semi-creamy mouthfeel finishes well but seemed a little flat. The head is very minimal, to be expected from a fruity one. Overall I think a lot of people who typically drink macros would like this one even. Not bad for me, for a fruity one, but I do not think I will try again."
"This one has a nice mix of dark malty flavors and sweet raspberry overtones. It seems to sit right on the fence of a good summer quaff (a la Purple Haze) and a beer youd warm slightly and sit with by the fire during a snow storm. The flavors are balanced between the thicker malts, fruity raspberries and just enough hops to cut the sweet. The color has the nice red tint youd expect without looking like it had been mixed with a sugar syrup. Im saving a few to try next summer after a day in the yard. I think itll still rise to the occasion."
"Nice beer to give to non-beer drinkers. I'm also thinking up lots of ways to cook with this."
"This is an occasional beer."
"Pours a near opaque, barely translucent muddy brown. Not much head and the aroma was brown ale all the way. Some fruit was in the nose, but not too much. That semi-chocolatey brown ale smell was the first thing I tasted. Without the fruit, this would have been a pretty decent brown ale, but with the raspberry flavors it becomes a classic brown. Most browns have a finish that I find off-putting and dissatisfying (think Legend Brown if you've had it). This beer finishes smooth with just the right hit of that typical flavor. Loved it. Again, I wish that NBs were readily available here."
"Raspberries dominate the taste, which would make this a good offering for non-beer people. Very drinkable. It might go well with some chocolate which isn't too sweet."
"Overall, a very interesting beer and an excellent fruit beer."
"12 oz bottle thanks to the generosity of babydoc. Deep scarlet in color when held up to light, with a moderate off-white head that fades quickly to a layer of faint bubbles. Smell is chocolatey with bready malt and fresh raspberry aroma. Taste is very tart, slightly sour, and dominated by raspberry, chocolate, and a touch of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is fairly well carbonated, and the sour/tart flavor of the raspberries mask any presence of hops, but this beer is a very interesting and unique. Great for a dessert, but i would not try to session these at all."
"Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, the color is a deeper-reddish chestnut color, with a slight 1 cm head that literally fizzes out within seconds, leaving a slight edge layer on top, but nothing spectacular. Sitting at least 18 inches away, I can already smell the cranberries. Accompanying them is a sweet malt with hints of floral hops and maybe just a ""sprinkle"" of caramel as well. The first sip reveals a definite presence of rasberries and some slight brown maltiness. The hops are aparent on the swallow, and a ""twang"" of alcohol hits you on the very finish. The cranberries carry the load of this ale however; a little too much for my liking. The feel is a lot like a cherry cola. A shot of carbonation on your tongue that is stingy, but the body is more medium-bodied IMO, and the alcohol burn is there at the end. Not a bad brew in the end, but I couldn't have another. I guess I'm not a cranberry lover. The bottle is definitely the highlight of this one."
"I've made no secret of the fact that Fat Tire and the truly wretched Loft are probably my least-favorite craft brews ever. But this is a really tasty, unique brew--I like it a lot. I was hoping for Three Philosophers Light. It's not quite that, but it's a light, complex dessert that's not a bad session. Good job, guys."
"Would make a great dessert after a big meal of, say, roast beef, gravy, root veggies."
"Not bad. Raspberry becomes more apparent after a few drinks."
"poured a hazy murky reddish brown witha thin thin head. lots of raspberry in the aroma, very siliar to rasp. jam/jelly almost seems a bit artifical. just a touch of sourness in the taste followed by a fairly average brown ale with a bit of raspberry mixed in. personally i'd like some sourness to counterbalance some of theoverpowering raspberry syrup in the aroma and give some more character to overall beer. not really worth picking up IMO."
"This is an excellent fruit beer, ideal with desserts or as a nightcap. Thanks to babydoc for sending this one my way."
"All in all, New Belguim has made an enjoyable winter seasonal, and one that I will enjoy again in future years."
"This is a fabulous beer, I've never had anything like it. Pours a deep dark brown with a tan head that has great head retention. The smell is of deep dark chocolate and raspberry. Smell like a nice truffle, hints of caramel and cream. The taste was fabulous, it is like drinking a chocolate covered raspberry, the chocolate upfront taste blends nicely with the raspberry sweetness. The milk/honey blends well with the chocolate. This is medium bodied and goes great with Raspberry Cheescake or chocolates, great dessert beer. The drinkability is down just because the beer is really sweet, more like a glass a night with dessert than a session beer."
"Lambic lovers should love this, I suppose."
"Comments - Drink this one instead of a dessert wine. I'll bet it would go really well with cheesecake, or even cranberry sauce. I can see how many folks may not like this one, but the taste has sort of grown on me (but the aftertaste is not so great). Worth a try - get it in a mixed six pack if you can."
"Other comments: I swear I'm not being stuck up about this and dissing it just because it's not made in Belgium. It's just not very good! Pretty disapointing. Great color, though! I just don't get why nearly everyone has scored this beer 3.5 or higher. Are you afraid to pan a beer from New Belgium or something?"
"A good fruit beer: ( review from a guy who isn't a big fan). Pours a ruby red cast with decent tan head and some moderate draped lacing. Smells of a raspberry pastry...little else. Taste is at once fruity and sweet and earthy with a sting of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly thick...maybe a tad too carbonated. The beer seems to be stuck firmly between ""refreshing"" and ""hearty"". Drinkability is good: this is a tasty beer. Decent. Period."
"Very nice. For a ""macro"" microbrew this is well-made. A nice holiday offering, particularly if most fruit beers strike you as too sweet."
"Drinkability- Easily drinkable. Not as sweet as I expected. Kind of like a lambic, but not as sour. I nice change of pace drink that would be good during a cold or hot day. Glad I picked this one up."
"This is a crimson brown colored brew that poured a fine head and is leaving a good lacing. Smell is wonderful, of raspberries and wheat. Taste is very interesting. It is am interesting combination of rapberries and chocolate and it finished with a dry hop sensation, very nice for this style. It is a bit on the thin side. Overall drinkability is not great. It is best suited for desserts, perhaps paired with a cheesecake."
"Not a ""typical"" Belgian Frambozen, but a good brew in a similar vein. This one is kinda like a dirtier Fat Tire with raspberries thrown in. A good dessert brew, but not something that blows my mind like most other NBBC brews do."
"Drinkability: If you like the Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic or McCoy's Raspberry Ale, you might like this beer. This is also a good segue beer for people hooked on wine coolers. But for people who really like beer, this is not acceptable. I won't buy it again."
"This looks pretty good, Heavy head leaving a touch of lace. Brown from a distance but some red is noticed when you get up close. The smell is light malt with only a faint sweetness. Taste is maltly along with that sweetness that I expecting from this brew. Not at all as sweet as I was anticipating, but slightly tart. This is where the taste stops dead in its tracks. Some acicity in the finish which is cool. Got to day that this is probably the best fruit brew I've ever had."
"This beer pours a reddish brown body with a foamy white head with hints of pink that leaves belgian lace on the side of my glass. Aroma is of raspberries with a malty sweetness there is a hint of cellar characteristic. Taste is of raspberries then chocolate maltiness in the middle and a strong raspberry finish. A great fruit beer, not overly sweet at all. It has a hint of sourness likely from the raspberries but is no where near a lambic. A very refreshing brew but I don't think I could drink too many of these because of the acidicness."
"Kinda like your workin mans lambic."
"A nice brew. First had it a year or two ago, on Old Chicago's glass night, and have a very nice goblet style glass to go with it. One of my favorite fruit beers, as many of them seem a bit too sweet for my tongue."
"Bottle. Yipes, not too good. Sweet sticky rasberry cola and brown sugar. Tasted like rasbery cordial on top of a below average brwon ale. I seriously have my doubts about New belgium. This was more like soft drink than beer, to sweet, not sourness/acidity or anything, just sweetness."
"12oz. bottle: The beer pours a reddish-brown color. Not too much head, which doesnt linger. What was there had a bit of a reddish-tan tinge to it. Aroma is pretty much that of tart raspberries. The taste of tart raspberries is the most evident, but not overly done. A bit of a neutral brown ale supporting it. Definitely another acquired taste, but this was pretty good!"
"a nice beer. cheers go out to beer angel for providing the sample!"
"Light brown color with ruby highlights and a frothy, off-white head that leaves sticky rings of lace. Juicy raspberry aroma upfront with soft toasted malt scents in the backround. Flavor is similar to the aroma, starts with juicy raspberry, sweet with a little tartness. Raspberry subsides as toasted grain flavors come into the profile. Hints of cocoa and caramel lie in the backround. Medium in body and very smooth. Not dry like a lambic, nice and juicy. The raspberries balance very well with the brown ale. Highly drinkable and delicious. Very nice."
"Appearance: A murky crimson blood red with a pleasant off white fine bubbled creamy textured head leaves nice Belgian style lacing here fine and spread evenly. Aroma: A nice toasted malt character stands beside nice subtly spiced raspberry juice very nice could be festive for the holidays considering the label adorns wreath made of raspberry and hop vines. Taste: A pleasant mix of berries and characters of a nutty brown ale it all blends well a nice creative experiement here that came out decent. Mouthfeel: Creamy textured pleasantly smooth medium to light bodied fruit infused ale. Drinkability: Not usually a fan of the fruit additive in a beer but these guys do a nice job this one is pretty drinkable not a cloying offness in the mix of fruit and malts here they mix well."
"I was quite excited o try this beer. It is dark ruby in color and has a slight fruity and spicy aroma. But the raspberry does not come out as much in the flavor as I would have liked. You can tell raspberries were used, but the rich, malty body comes across as a more earthy spiciness. Still this is a good holiday seasonal."
"I did enjoy this beer; however it is the kind of beer that I would have to have in small doses. The tartness makes it hard to drink a lot of."
"This one poured a beautiful cherry hue with a thin tan head. Aroma is a bit sour, raspberries, graham crackers, yeast and malt come to mind. Body is thin to medium and smooth yet effevescent. Flavor is tart and full of raspberries with an acidic finish. Overall not outstanding and rather weak in aroma and flavor."
"A clear chestnut body reveals crimson and orange highlights when held to the light; and its frothy off-white head holds quite well while leaving some nice, thin lace throughout most of the glass. Bright, juicy raspberry dominates the nose, backed by a softly chocolatey and grainy malt. The body is medium and somewhat dextrinous with a fine, median carbonation that warms to become airy and smooth. Juicy, sweet and lightly tart raspberry returns in the flavor, again followed by a cocoa-ish, lightly chocolatey, subtly caramelish, and delicately biscuity malt that fades to again reveal raspberry. It's sublime bitterness never surfaces, but does a brilliant job at balancing from the wings; and it teeters nicely between sweet, tart, juicy and cocoa-ish. Quite nice! The cocoa-ish character of the malt gives it more depth than most raspberry ales, and lends greatly to its drinkability. Certainly worth trying."
"This was a good beer. Had a nice head, colored a pale redish, that lasted the whole way down and laced all the way as well. The smell was of raspberry and a hop smell as well. The taste at first was dominated by tart raspberry and finished with a nice smooth malt taste. A very well made beer and one of my wifes favorites."
"The Frambozen poured a dark ruby red with a big pinkish-tan, creamy head that lasted for the entire time and laced the glass on the way down. It had a tart, fruity nose. The taste followed suit - a big tart raspberry initial taste that mellowed as the beer warmed, with a smooth malt finish. This is one of my favorite holiday beers. The fruitiness is not overwhelming, and it's very drinkable. I have noticed that the taste can vary from batch to batch as well as draft vs bottles - some are fruitier and tarter than others."
"Give the other holiday offerings a rest and try this undiscovered gem of a beer. It certainly made MY holiday a little brighter."
"I would like to see NB pursue this baby into full, North American, fermee spontenee glory."
"This is a pretty tasty offering from New Belgium Brewing Co. It has a nice raspberry tang that makes it easy to quaff. Not quite on a par with Lindemans, but pretty close."
"This pours with a decent light tan head settling over clear deep ruby liquid.Lots of candyish raspberry aromas in the nose. The berries carry over to the taste anong with a very slight sourness. Finishes on a fruity/tangy note...nicely made, but pretty much a one dimensional beer. Thanks to bditty187 for the bottle."
"This is one of the better Raspberry beers that I have had lately. It pours a nice ruddy, yeasty brown colour with a small cap of white foam. The aromas are of tart raspberries, and nice belgian malts and yeast. The taste is very berry-ish, but also very belgian-y. This reminds me of a light alcohol Belgian dubble, mixed with a low abv lindemans framboise. Or something like that:-) The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is good. Nice!"
"paid $5.99 for a 6 pack."
"Drinkability: Not a favorite of mine, but worth trying. Hope you like raspberries more than malt and hops to really enjoy this one."
"This is an odd little beer. Not bad, but just . . . well, odd. I thought that this was supposed to be a try at a framboise lambic-style beer, but I see now that that is not what they were shooting for. At least I hope not. It is a raspberry flavored brown ale, and that is all. Not very tart, and a little on the sweet side, but nowhere near cloying. Definitely interesting."
"I think this would be a charming beer to introduce to folks during the holiday season. It would make a great dessert compliment to a dark chocolate cake or mousse. Or all by itself."
"deep brown and red with a small thin head. Slightly fruity smelling as expected. But the Raspberries don't really come out until the first taste. Its got a lot of body like a typical beer but with a powerful raspberry taste. Its slightly bitter but yet sweet depending on the tine of sip. It starts bitter but ends sweet. A nice different beer from New Belgium."
"Tralucent deep ruby hue. Spotty, strawberry cream colored head manages sparse lace. Acuate waft of sugary, but vibrant raspberry hits the nose at first, then is ensued by subtle notes of dry cocoa and light biscuit. Dark caramel hints and earthy, damp hay tones arise upon swirling. Paradoxically pungent yet mellow in aroma. Intriguing. Rounded, burnt sugar cookie sweetness incipient in flavor is complemented by a combination of ripe raspberry and blurred caramel. Salty biscuit and trace woody, leathery undertones surface as it breathes and attempt contrast, but raspberry flavors are pervasive. Full bodied, agreeably dextrinous in mouthfeel and reminescent of berries and cream. Tartens a notch late, with an nearly overshadowed kriek feign. Finishes with quickly fading acidity yielding to sweet cocoa and raspberry. It's been a while since I've had this, and I'm pleasantly surprised. There's sufficient body and malt character to balance the fruit flavor. The residual sweetness does eventually weigh a touch heavily on the palate, but overall it's quite a unique, flavorful and enjoyable brew."
"Thanks to Mr. Jeffboo for sharing!"
"Deep red clear color, pours with a tan head. A strong aroma of raspberry emanates from this glass, dominates all other aromas that might be in here. Quite dry, not sweet at all. The raspberry flavor is there, lightly acidic as well, and a slight tannic astringency in the finish. This is quite nice, I like that this is not over-sweetened and syrupy, like so many other fruit beer interpretations. There is a good amount of body that helps to carry this beer."
"Bottle bought at Huckleberry's in Spokane. Poured a reddish brown, with a decent head colored somewhere between off-white and pink. Scents of raspberries (duh), a pleasing sweet and sourness. A little maltiness, but way in the background. The taste. is fruity, with a little bit of tart lemony flavor in there along with the raspberries, but not at the same level. There's also a bit of maltiness hovering in the background, just enough to make you aware its there. This is a very pleasing beer, perhaps not traditional enough to please hard core fruit beer drinkers, but quite tasty nonetheless. I had to grade it down in the drinkability area, as this is just too fruity for repeated pints. This would probably be great with a rich chocolate dessert. Now I want one. Doh!"
"Thin head subsides quickly atop a bungundy and brilliantly clear brew. Aroma is of sour raspberries with with the lightest touch of a stale hop scent. Flavor is pretty nice as there is a nice interplay between the chocolaty malt and the sweet and sour raspberry flavors though i don't detect any hops which may be what the brewers intended though i like a little hoppiness in all my beers. A carbonic bite actually gives this beer a bit more of a raspberry attitude. Very nice beer to drink and a good beer to give to hardcore fruit beer drinkers to illustrate the balance of fruit and malt."
"Medium brown color. Small head. Aroma is raspberry and slightly malty. A medium bodied fruit beer. The raspberry flavor is fairly pronounced. There is also a very slight lambic like quality to this beer. The berry flavor really dominates and it a mix of fruit sweetness and a lambic like tartness to it as well. The brown ale qualities are present as well, but they are far in the background. Malts are nutty and sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. Its a interesting beer, but it a little to sweet for my tastes. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet."
"What a pleasant color this brown ale was. It was a red tawny port color with very little foam and no lace to speak of. The smell was of a tart raspberry nature with some hops in the background. The taste was of tart raspberrys with a hint of roasted malts and some hops. Not to thick and very pleasant on the after taste. A pleasant surprise for my palate and yours, if your looking for a tart fruity flavor in a brown ale."
"Very nice beer I am happy I tried it again..this time in a glass."
"Thanks to jeffboo for the bottle."
"Deep reddish brown in color with maybe a tannish pink head. It has a somewhat fruity aroma of raspberries and earth. It has a nice light to medium body that holds a chocolate covered raspberry flavor well. Not overly complex but a nice after dinner drink with dessert."
"Acquired via trade. This is one of the better Fruit Beers I have tried, mostly because the fruit flavoring is not as in-your-face. Pours a dark ruby color with a thin light beige head and almost no lacing. Aroma is all raspberry. As mentioned, the raspberry flavor is less pronounced than in similar beers, it does taste more like a beer with raspberry added than a raspberry beer. Despite not being particularly strong, this would probably get old after the first couple. Finish is smooth but gets a little sour toward the end."
"Pours deep ruby in color with a thin creamy light pink colored head that quickly fades into a trace amount of lace. Nose is fresh raspberry and sweet malts. Crisp with a good amount of carbonation to tickle the mouth. Taste is a nice blend of tart raspberries and sweet malts with a bit of fruity citrus. The raspberries in both the aroma and taste seem very natural with no artificial notes that tarnish so many brews of this type. A delightful brew that makes for an excellent after-dinner drink."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer and I am glad that I got a 6-pack so I can enjoy a few more."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red color with a pale pink 1-1/2 finger head that leaves a nice pink lace down the glass chasing the deep red brew. The nice aroma of crisp raspberries is dominant as should be in this beer along with a mild vanilla background. So far, I feel like I am about to have a dessert in this experience. The flavor is a semi-sweet raspberry that again overpowers most. Everything else from the light hops to the roasted malt is nothing but background. It finishes with a cough syrup type flavor that is just short of desirable. Perhaps the complexity of this brew is buried by the raspberry flavor. It is a light to medium bodied brew that finishes lightly sweet. Drinkability is not too high. Not bad, but not great. Cheers!"
"This one is rather tasty and should be chilled. The mouthfeel is lighter than I expected - not heavy like Belgian Lambics. The malt and hops are also strong in this one. Much more an ale in feel. I found this rather tasty and it went excellent with Lamb for Dinner. I recommend this one too. What a surprise - I seem to recommend every beer - but then I am a Beer Advocate""."
"Lovely claret color with a huge pale pink head head, minor lace, a quite visually striking beer. Very pronounced natural aroma of raspberries, sweet, but with a wine or cordial characteristic. Taste begins with raspberry flavors, stinging carbonation, and a distinct alcohol note, beneath which are substantial bittersweet chocolate malts and spicy hops. Raspberry flavors rise to a tart sharpness towards the midpoint of the taste. Near the finish the hops assert themselves more strongly to vanquish the lingering raspberry notes. This beer is notable for the fact that the raspberry aroma and flavor seem completely natural and free of odd chemical flavors usually present in raspberry-flavored beverages. An absolutely stunning accomplishment in brewing. Would be excellent as a dessert beer."
"Granted I haven't tasted a lot of beers coming from this style but this is an excellent brew. I have always been impressed with New Belgium Brewing, Inc. and this just helps confirm that idea. Not to mention that I was worried that I may never get to taste this beer since it is one of their special releases. It pours a deep ruby color that has a full creamy head that lasts all the way down leaving a nice lace. The smell is as you would expect, strong of raspberries and the taste is just the same. It has the raspberries along with a decent malty flavor as would be expected with a brown ale. It continues on with that fruitness with the mouthfeel similar to that of a rich raspberry juice with some carbonation. It is very drinkable but the fact that it is so fruity makes me feel like I shouldn't drink it like regular beer. Overall, I find this brew to be quite excellent and will definitely get it again if it comes around again. Plus, this beer makes an excellent holiday brew in my opinion."
"I would first like to say I don't like this style of brew to begin with but if I did I'm sure I would enjoy this one from my favorite brewery. A very dark red.It smelled like raspberry's and you can tell it is very fruity. Was the first fruity brew I've tasted and I did not like it. The taste was very fruity and tasted like raspberry's. It tasted like a wine cooler and I will not drink it again."
"Dark red, almost opaque brew topped with a huge reddish off-white (raspberry colored!) head. Kind of fizzy, goes down to a thin lace. I must say, it's a great looking beer. And the aroma, wow, HUGE aroma. Powerful natural raspberry aroma that almost knocks you back, in a good way. Underneath are subtle hints of spicy hops and a bit of grainy malt. Again in the palate, raspberry dominates. The tangy raspberry goes quite well with the spicy hops, which are second in the medium body. Grainy malt hangs in the background in a subtle way, yet is the big supporter for this brew at the same time. Tingly mouthfeel from the overall spiciness. It even warms, with what I expect is not so high an ABV. Great choice for a winter brew. I wonder how many pounds of raspberries are used per batch for this beer? It must be a generous amount, because it's hard to find this much fruitiness in a beer brewed with fruit, with the exception of a fruit lambic. Would be great for pairing with chocolate, raspberry desserts, or just plain raspberries. Good holiday brew."
"This unique tasty offering pours into a deep dark ruby color and a foamy pink head.  The aroma of candied raspberries is very similar to many flavorful red wines.  The initial sweet tanginess of the berries is supported and balanced by a generous malt profile and a deep spicy hop presence.  This is a very tasty brew that, IMO, will also cellar very well."
"Thanks bditty187 for the trade so I could review this beer!"
"Clear ruby-brown hue, it is an absolutely gorgeous color, the off-white head never develops much height, maybe a fourth of a finger, sparse in the middle, fuller around the rim. Laces rather well, very webby. The nose is raspberries and malt, there is pretty good depth to the raspberries, a little sweet, a little tart, a little like pie, yet I cant help but say this is a one trick pony. Yes, the malt is noticeable but what does it really do? It has an inviting aroma nevertheless. The palate is impressive, that is all I can say. The maltiness is very sturdy, typical of a Brown Ale, hence the name. The raspberry taste is very pie-like, a touch tart and a touch sweet, I detect more chocolate notes than I have typically. The finish is largely brown ale in nature, the hops are not noticeable, the bitterness is minimal; the aftertaste has a burst of raspberry and then maltiness. Drier than youd expect, the taste is far from cloying. This beverage begs to be paired with cheesecake or a chocolate cake. This fruit beer is much different than 99% of its competition. I look forward to Frambozen every year; it is worth a six-pack for sure. I do like it better on-tap however. This is an impressive beverage. I would recommend this to anyone who thinks fruit beers are either girly or too sweet. This ale is damn tasty. Recommended."
"The pour is an opaque dark sanguineous color with the head moderate in sized and spumous in texture, the color a toothsome light tan and the lace a thick and sticky blanket to coat the glass. Nose is raspberry, hints of malt, sweet, and altogether quite pleasing to ""Sniff"" with the front nicely malt laden and somewhat sweet, the top light. Finish is tart and befittingly hopped with the acidity moderate and quite dry aftertaste, a nice drinking beer that I sample often."
"They did adecent job with the two cherry but there is something wrong with this beer. It looked good, ruby/brown color and the mouthfeel was alright. It had a sharp smell and a weird bitterness to it. Bitter almond might describe it best. If this was from the hops I have never had a hop that tastes like this. I have also made plenty of fermented raspberry beverages and none of them had a bitter flavor (astringent yes but not bitter). I will try it again in case this was just a bad bottle."
