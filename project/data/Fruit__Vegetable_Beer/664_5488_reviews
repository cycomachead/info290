"Pint poured into glass. Brown body very slight head if even. Smell is like those laffy taffy banana candies. Taste is sharp carbonation. Sickly sweet artificial tasting banana although the bottle states they use actual bananas. Not saying it is artificial but it's just a taste to me. Then toffee and some dryness but very little. Slight roastyness but not much. Happy to have tried it but will not buy again. But glad to have tried it."
"Taste was immediately of banana, and aftertaste was bicuity. Pretty spot on for a bready beer with banana flavor. Not my cup of tea though. Again, wife loved it."

"just love it. i love bananas already so yeah haha"

"Surprisingly good. Definitely worse beers..."
"My wife loves this beer... Can't buy a 6 pack without bringing her home one of these bad boys"

"Great beer, I'd drink it any time."
"Really enjoyed the banana flavor of this, was good even after warming on the beach for a bit (forgot a cooler, oops)"
"i could taste the hint of banana and it was gooooood"
""

""

"Awesome beer really does taste just like banana bread."
""
""
""

"Very good looking beer, smells like banana (with notes of skunk). Tastes like banana bread but it also tastes like beer which is nice. Not my favourite, I wouldn´t even buy it again, but It´s a very interesting experience."
"Love this. Tastes just like banana bread"

"Great smell, very smooth, pleasantly surprised!"
"I think that the most important aspect of note with this beer is that even though it's billed as a ""banana bread"" beer and flavored with bananas, it comes across very similar to a Belgian pale ale. The banana comes across pretty much identically to Belgian yeast. Not as hoppy as a BPA, but otherwise very similar in balance. My only knock on this is the incredible thinness."
""
""
""
"Pours with a large, white head. Has a very clean amber color. Has an actual banana bread aroma mixed with a hoppy aroma. Initial taste is of banana bread immediately followed by hops and a hint of alcohol. Well done, Wells. Well done."
"Medium amber color with short lived head and lace. Deep aroma of ripened banana with a backbone of biscuity richness. The banana isn't overbearing in the taste, but blends well with the slight malty base. Mouthfeel is bubbly with a buttery texture. Overall its a pretty balanced brew, although I'd like to see what this one would be like on nitro."
""
""
"I would like to try this with banana pudding!"
"Smells just like banana bread, very tasty."

""
"I'm usually skeptical of most fruit beers, and I'm not a big fan of bananas, but this is pretty good. I thought it tasted more like oatmeal with bananas, but nevertheless it lives up to the name."
""
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had. If you're into something different and refreshing, this is it. You take your first sip and its beer but the after taste is absolute banana bread goodness."
""
""
""
"Very surprising, great beer. I would buy again"
"It's a gorgeous rich amber color when poured.  The smell is almost non existent with just a faint odor of sweetness.  The taste is rich and flavorful, light carbonation, and just a hint of  banana bread.  Smooth finish, without the cloying sweetness I've seen in other 'fruit' type beers.  I have to say, I'm rather surprised by this beer, I wasn't expecting much.  It's delicious and satisfying."

"Strange to see such experiments from british brewery, but this one is nice"
""
"Overall, the aroma and taste is great, but it's a very light beer. Missing some body and a little freshness."
""
"Smells a lot like a banana. Dessert beer"
""
"Ehh it's alright. I mean I've had better but then again for what this beer is its pretty good."
""
""
""
""

"Wow, very good beer. Must have."
""
""
"Great taste, not hoppy. Smells great"

""
"Exactly what you want from a flavoured beer"
""
""
"Tastes strongly of bananas which is exactly what I  wanted."
""
"Exactly what should be expected when getting a flavored beer. Very good."
""
""
""
"I don't know why I like this but I do."
""
""
"Surprisingly enjoyable. Could use a tiny bit more sweetness, but it stays true to its name in its flavor. Was worried it would just taste like banana flavoring, but there is actually a wholesome bready-ness to it as well."
"Interesting but Good banana bread taste"
"Great craft beer. Amazing with chocolate stout blend"
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer. It pours with good head retention. The smell is sweet with strong nots of banana. The taste is smooth and the banana are obvious on the palate. Feel is slightly carbonated to my opinion but leaves only sweet tones for after taste. Will be getting this again!"
"Not a fan of fruit beers to begin with. This had too much banana, but I can't imagine any banana flavor being a positive in a beer."
""
"Has a strong Banana taste, but not overwhelming"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent but I was expecting something a bit heavier, with a better head.  The beer almost has to be taken by itself, not even a pretzel, because the banana flavor is so delicate.  I enjoyed trying it, but I'll not likely buy again."
"Newly introduced in the local market"
"Loved this beer the banana flavour made it special"
""
""
""
""
"I simply love this beer, its like drinking dessert"
"Pours a nice amber brown with a head that fades quickly with minimal lacing. Smells exactly how it sounds: banana bread and British ale. Tastes like banana bread (duh). The banana hits you up front and the finish is somewhat lacking. I find the banana to taste a lot like those yellow banana popsicles you grow up eating as a kid. I wish it was thicker or creamier but then you might lose some accessability. Decent unique brew. Would have again."
""
"A strong smell of banana bread on the nose that was slighty more subdued on the palate. It definitely has a lingering mouthfeel that emphasizes the banana bread experience."
""
""
"Goes down smooth, and has a nice hint of banana flavor throughout.  The taste is robust and refreshing.  This beer kicks into gear right away and I would recommend it to anyone and would purchase it again for myself.  It has a slight bitter taste so most chicks wouldn't dig it, however I don't mind this flavor one bit at all!  It comes in a 500 ml bottle so it won't leave me too much more room to rate any other beers tonight but thats ok with me.  This is a nice beer.  I have a British heritage however, so I have a slightly biased opinion ;)"
""
""
"Very week taste, taste like a flavored miller sorry but being honest."
"Great beer for trying something new!"
""
""
"This beer is good, but hard to get through an entire bottle.  The uniqueness of the Banana taste wares off and it is a good beer, but nothing great."

"I picked this one up at my grocery store. It was expensive but am glad I didn't let the price keep me from picking it up. This beer was much more pleasant than most people (dis)credited it for. This beer was not bitter at all despite other comments I've read about this one. I did experience the banana flavor both in the taste and aroma of this brew. It has a very smooth, well balanced, satisfyingly sweet taste and best of all it didn't leave me feeling woozy or tipsy, at least not yet. Although I've had even better fruit beers in Montana, this is certainly of the better ones you could savor. The current BA Score of this beer at the time of my review is 79, a pity as this is much better than others on here which are highly overrated. As far as the aftertaste goes, no issues as of yet. Would I buy this English brew again? Yes indeed. It's a winner."

"Wells Banana Bread Beer had a decent amount of foam.  Wells Banana Bread Beer had medium carbonation.  Wells Banana Bread Beer had a smooth taste with medium taste of wheat.  There was a vague banana aftertaste within Wells Banana Bread Beer.  People who enjoy a smooth banana aftertaste beer will enjoy Wells Banana Bread Beer."

"07/18/12  On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. I like this beer. May be sweet for some, but I don't mind that one bit. Clever & well made. Worthwhile. Maybe not 2 in a row, but I'll have another before I leave."

"The bananas in the nose might suggest a tradition hefe, but there's enough malt and sugar underneath to say otherwise; it's more like a banana Popsicle.  The taste is lightly toasted malt with ripe bananas and just a hint of light caramel in the finish.  Good carbonation give the body a nice structure to enjoy drinking.  If you like a banana-taste profile and want more malt and body than a hefeweizen typically provides, this could be an option."

"Overall (2.93) : I would call this a wheat lager with banana notes. The nose is the strongest part of this ""banana"" beer. It doesn't taste like banana bread, and it doesn't feel like a craft so to speak. It's a notch above the macros and it's pretty decent, but if they marketed it under a wheat beer with banana notes and put it in 12-pack cases I'd be more excited about it (and probably by hype I'd give it a 3.5 or more). If you're expecting banana bread, just buy a loaf instead (or get your mama to make you one). It's probably as close as any brewer has come to it, but it's a far cry from a delicious treat."

"500 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, best before 11/14/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep copper/amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big ripe banana, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, light caramel, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of banana, dark/bready malt, and light hop notes; with good strength. Taste of ripe banana, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, light caramel, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, light caramel, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and solid robustness of banana, dark/bready malt, and light hop flavors; with a good malt/fruit balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly dry mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good fruit beer. Good balance and solid robustness of banana, dark/bready malt, and light hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A bit one dimensional, but it accomplishes what it advertises. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"I would like to start out by saying this beer should be enjoyed at room temperature, or at least that's where I got the best flavor profile from it. The appearance was dark amber with a slightly yellow white head. The smell was full of bananas and nutmeg. The taste was great with the wheat from the beer and the banana flavor mixing to make a warm banana bread flavor for the beer. The mouthfeel was also very nice, just thick enough without becoming overwhelming. Really nice twist."
""

"Currently drinking a glass of this as I'm sitting here typing. I had this beer years ago, but decided to pick up another bottle since I see it all the time. The beer looks really good in the glass, a nice amber color with a small amount of head on top. The smell is great in my opinion, and the banana stands out easily. As far as the taste is concerned, I feel like something is missing. The subtle banana flavoring is great, but it I just feel like there's something that could stand out more, that just isn't. Overall, I think it's a good beer that readily available."

"Smells of Banana Bread. Wells really knows how to get smell down. Feels thick in my mouth and tastes sort of tangy and spicy with a definite aftertaste of banana. Every burp tastes like banana bread. Excellent beer to drink with comfort food like a grilled cheese sandwich. Lower APV than in most beer I'd consume, can drink a couple of these with lunch and not get a buzz."

"Trying the wells and young banana bread beer at the Pie Factory in Florance, AL. The beer poured a clear copper with virtually no head and no lacing. The scent is definitely banana bread. The taste has a lighter malt base with banana and hints of spice (clove).The m outhfeel is lighter in body with subtle carbonation. Overall the beer hits the mark as far as taste. ..but one is enough for me."

"This is very refreshing and it taste just like the label... BANANAS!!!!  This for me is one of my all time favorites to enjoy in the summer months.  Gives you that tropical feel like your in the islands!  Anyway it is a light, easy to drink beer that is not overly sweet, but leaves you with a great beer/banana taste that lingers.  If you like banana or fruity beers, add this to your list!"

"Seems distinct between the banana bread and beer flavour. At first, banana bread in all its rich sweetness, then turns to straight up beer with a bite at the finish. If you're a fan of both without seeking fusion, by all means give it a go to judge for yourself. For me it's a nice change of pace, but not something I'd list as a regular item on my brew menu, especially for the price. For the price of six others, I only get four, but such is the way for the adventurous taster."
""
""

"Pours a clear amber/orange with a medium off-white head. Aromas of banana scented sunscreen, but not in a bad way, actually pleasant, ha. Taste begins with a little nuttiness, then some sweetbread, followed by banana candy flavor, and a hint of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is average. Overall an ok beer, but the banana flavoring is a bit too artificial tasting to me. I'd rather just have a banana forward hefeweizen if I want a beer that tastes like bananas."

"Very thin and watery looking brew. Light metallic bronze color with thin head. Smells decent. Banana runts for sure. The taste follows the nose, sweet banana like the candy banana runts. There just isn't much to this one. It's thin and lacking complexity, but it is easy to drink."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Initial aroma and flavor is banana runts. After some time it mellows out to a reasonable banana presence, but the bread part is a bit lacking. Would be nice if this had a bit more of a malt backbone to stand up to the banana -- a bit of roastiness and nuttiness would probably complement it nicely. Still, it's pretty drinkable once the artificial-seeming aroma fades. A decent beer for when you're in the mood for something unusual."

"This beer's had a good rep in the beer world, and there aren't many banana beers out there. For what it is I think it's a well-made, pretty well-balanced beer. Overall the banana-ness tastes and smells a bit artificial to me. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're expecting a fresh banana experience you'll be a bit disappointed. Not overly sweet, so you could definitely drink more than one of them without palate fatigue."

"Pours a pretty amber in color with a very small off-white head that settles down to around the top of the beer along the glass. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip. When first opened you can smell the bananas with malt. Very pleasant. The taste would be expected as with the smell, bananas and yeast/malt, hense the name. A different beer that is tasty and not bitter as well as a good aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Slightly let down by the sublte-ness of the flavour. A dessert beer for sure, not sure what else you would have with it. Glad I got to try it, but not sure if I would drink again."
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer exceeded my expectations in a big way. The fruity banana flavor is not cloying at all, and the toasty malts are in perfect harmony. I wouldn't go for this all the time, but I thought it was pretty enjoyable."
"Overall: It's a decent beer, but very good for a flavored beer. You can actually taste the bananas, but not in an overwhelming way."
""
""
"Okay listen, this is a beer for a specific purpose. You've heard of Dessert Wines? This is a dessert complimenting beer. It smells very much as advertised. It tastes they way you would imagine. It goes well with any ice-cream, tart, fruit, or pie dessert dish. This is not your ""during the game, or social outing"" beer. But if you utilize this beer with a dessert dish, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Didn’t knock my socks off by any means. I was hoping it would be more malty to really harness the sweetness of banana bread."
""
""
""
"Copper in color with a small one to two finger head which breaks rather quickly leaving a very thin cap and some lacing. The first smell one gets is, unsurprisingly, sweet ripe bananas. There really isn't much more that be picked up because the banana smell is so strong. The first taste you get is the sweet banana as well, but then it is followed by the malt and hops that one would expect to get from a British bitter. This beer had medium carbonation and a thin or light feel. I would have expected it to be heavier, but was surprised at how light it was. My biggest issue with this beer is an associative one...the smell and initial taste remind me of Mr Freezee ice pops (for Americans think Otter pops). Once I got past that, I did enjoy the beer."
""
""
""
""

"O- Not something I would drink all the time, but it's neat to revisit every once in a while (got this particular bottle for free) just to remember that there is a beer out there that tastes exactly like banana bread."

"This beer smells exactly like banana bread. Unfortunately the taste doesn't match the intensity of the smell. Most of the flavors are only slightly detectable. A little malty and the banana taste isn't very noticeable until the aftertaste. Still, this is a crisp and very drinkable beer."

"Was really excited to give this a try as I love the smell and taste of bananas. Read the label and noticed that this is the same company that produces the Double Chocolate Stout. Hmmmm. I was disappointed in that one. Would the same apply here? Meaning would I be let down by the promise of flavor? Popped a bottle in the fridge and poured it into a beer glass. Nice 2 finger head that has some nice lacing as the head dissipates. I noticed the foam keeps throughout and never totally disappears. The color is a nice flat blondish orange. Clear looking. Has a faint smell of bananas that is artificial. I wish the smell was more pure. The taste has a very faint sweetness to it and the fake banana flavor comes through at the finish and lingers a bit. The beer itself has no body and is quite thin and watery. What happened to the ""liquid bread"" they were talking about? This is an easy beer to drink and I could probably have 2 bottles easily but I was disappointed in the overall taste. When I drink a flavored beer I want it to taste like what it is advertised. Towards the end I added some Dekuyper Creme de Banana just for kicks and the taste elevated to a new level. Granted it was still fake, the sweetness and the banana ""flavor"" was enhanced. I think this is a nice beer for women. (My wife liked the taste). I liked it ok, just wished it was more true and flavorful."

"Yeah this is an Outstanding Beer, have you ever tasted any other like it? Strong Banana Nut smell, and upfront taste. Great dessert beer for special occasions. Something different and fun. Every day...nope. I wouldn't drink a Guinness every day either. I bought it just for fun and that is what I got."

"PS: Following a recipe on the internet, I mixed a second bottle of this offering with some Young's Double Chocolate Stout (probably my favorite sweet stout). The resulting blend was tasty, but both the banana and chocolate flavors were too muted to make for a delicious desert concoction. As a beer, it tasted like a thin stout. Interesting, but not worth repeating."

"Overall, this is pretty poor stuff. The banana is a gimmick and no more, and it doesn't work with the other characters of the beer at all. It certainly doesn't live up to its moniker, a concept I can believe would actually make a rather tasty brew."
""
"Overall it needed to be richer and sweeter, the banana is there but easily overcome by the ESB nature of the beer."

"The body is about medium, a little bit of a mineral edge as it translates into the feel. It's even slightly dry as that herbal hint creeps into the finish. Crisp and otherwise smooth, it goes down prety well."

"This has to be one of my favorite beers, I love bananas so this might be why but it has the perfect color like a orangish darkish copper, and I cant get enough of the taste, this is a beer I will keep around for a while. It smells very fresh and has low carbonation. this one scores to be in my top 5 favorite beers."

"This is my favorite beer of all time, but I don't drink it as often as I would like, so when I do, it is a real treat. The appearance, smell and taste are incredible. It is a perfect blend of beer, banana and spices, and has perfect carbonation. Highly recommended! Give it a try."

"I have had this a few times and it seem its to go down hill the more I have it. With that said it was fantastic the first four pack I had. I will continue to buy it when I am in the mood for it but will not buy any to have on hand. Overall it is worth a try."
"I like bananas. I like banana bread. I love beer. Will they fuck this up? Surprisingly, no. This beer pours a copper colour with a thick, one and a half finger head that lasts. Smells of banana pudding, vanilla, bready malts, and just a faint hint of pine. Taste starts out like banana bread. Big banana flavours with some malt backbone. Middle has a vanilla and pine flavour added in. Finishes like banana taffy. Mouthfeel is smooth, drinkable and dry. Overall, a beer I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
""
"O: I thought this was a decent beer. If you drink it cold it might not have much to offer but the moment it starts warming up you can definitely get more flavors from the beer. I would have it again."

"D - a beer that would be better as a liquor."

"Overall: This is a fairly straightforward beer. It is very definitely ""banana bread"" based, but fortunately, it never strays close to being gimmicky, and holds up as a reasonable beer on its own. Now if only they released a Banana Bread Stout...!"
""
""
"A unique beer that certainly follows through on the promise it's name makes. I went into it with fairly low expectations, but the banana blends well with the malts and is not overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You can definitely smell banana bread! Really interesting and everybody at our table had to try it! It has really good color the taste is more on the sweeter side. One negative for me is that this beer felt ""thin""... I guess since I like stouts I prefer full bodied beers."

"O: Not something I will rant and rave about, but definitely something I will gave again in the future."

"Overall - Amazing brew, I am a sucker for anything banana and this really did the trick. Would recommend to banana fans and those who have a sweet tooth, otherwise it might just join the ranks of fruit beers that most beer drinkers don't enjoy."

"156 calories per bottle 5.2% ABV. The first time I tasted this I was a bit tipsy but really surprised how well this tasted like banana bread. I wasn't able to sense any bitterness or bad aftertaste. With a fruit flavored beer it likely either has a bad aftertaste or such a strong flavor that you'd only be able to handle one without throwing-up - this one would be able to be consumed in a 6-pack. The taste was not excessively strong and neither unsatisfying to the way it settles in the stomach. I did like this and would like to try again as one of my first beers to be able to truly sense any subtle hints of dissatisfaction. I liked and would buy again, a good choice for the fruit flavored style. The appetence could improve but that is not as big a deal as the taste."
"Overall, A pleasant surprise. Worth a try."

"Clear yellow-amber pour with a two finger off-white head with decent retention and nice lacing. The smell is exactly what one would expect...banana bread. I was expecting just bananas, but they nailed the bread part as well. The taste follows suit with a really nice, surprising spot-on banana bread flavor. Not artificial at all, and the spiciness of the hops adds a nice twist. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice balance and none of the artificial aftertaste I had expected. And it's not sweet and syrupy, but very sessionable. Overall, this was very surprising. Yeah, it's kind of a novelty, but it's a well made beer and I'm glad I tried it."
"Final Thoughts: It's a good beer and an interesting experience, but I wouldn't say this is something you'd drink regularly. I actually had it for breakfast one day. Anyways, like a broken record, it's as advertised. If beer is liquid bread, you are going to get mild liquid banana bread."
""
"Banana bread and beer - holy mackerel, what could be better? Well, it wasn't stupendous but it was sure good. From the bottle the beer is an appealing dark amber, pouring a weak head but with good lacing. The smell is distinctly banana - I don't smell much of bread, but definitely banana - which is a pet peeve of mine. If you advertise it one way, it better be that way, oh well that's advertisement for you. The beer however was bold and refreshing, a little too much carbonation for my taste, but still good. I really did enjoy it, a great mixture of malt and banana that mixed perfectly. Overall, it wasn't banana bread, but it was a good banana flavored beer that I think many will like."

"The beer pours a clear amber with light bubbles a thin, loose, off-white head that settles quickly without lacing. The nose has subtle, but detectable notes of ripe banana/bread, seemingly non-artificial smelling, and a touch of yeast and vanilla extract. The banana in the nose doesn't fully translate into the beer's flavor profile, which is more of a bitter amber ale than anything, but does leave traces of lingering green banana in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is relatively thin and light-bodied, sessionable, effervescent, slightly bitter, and leaves a bitter-sweet banana aftertaste. I'd say this is definitely not what I'd expected and could use a bit more body, yeast, and sweetness to really amplify what is a spot on, non-artificial banana nose and taste."

"EDIT: I forgot to mention that I hate the idea of pouring a beer down the drain. I just don't see the point in being wasteful. I gave this one a solid go, and drank about 80% but that last bit was my first drainpour. Ever."
"its banana bred beer in a glass nothing more either you like it or hate i think its perfect taste just like a banana bread i giggle its so good if you like banna bread drink tis beer nothing more to say they capture wht they were going for nothing needs to be said enjoy the berr yes or no i love it so enjoy"

"Take this beer for what it is. If your looking for something that tastes like beer then you should just walk on by this one. But if you appreciate how they came about to make a beer that actually tastes like banana bread then this is the one for you. It is unreal how they did this. Great job guys!"

"O: Decent beer but not one that I would seek out in the future."
"This beer is great for a flavored beer. Sweet hints of banana blended surprisingly good while still maintaining a classic malty beer taste. Could use a bit more carbonation. If you like sweet beers and bananas, I highly recommend giving this beer a try!"

"I don't intend to repeat this beers for its not feel special to me."

"O - Good looking brew not necessarily the color of banana bread. Smell is alright but artificial at times. Not really imitating a slice of banana bread. I do appreciate that the beer has beer quality but I think it could work better with a smoother/chewier feel and a touch more sweetness."

"Wells Banana Bread Beer comes across as a bit kitchy and falls short in terms of overall appeal. I love bananas and beer, but the melding of both in this offering did not work well."
""
""
"O - Immediately I thought, Wow this is really surprising good. But the more is sipped, the more i realized this has the nose of a Laffy Taffee and tastes a bit artificial. In their defense the taste isn't too overly ripe/too sweet banana. Almost a touch bitter- which is very nice. Spices, pepper and sweetness are really balanced. But, the artificialness is something I couldn't get over or this would have gotten higher ratings."
""
""

""
"O: A really nice beer but more of a rare occasion buy when your feeling frisky not something I would stock up on for any occasion."
""

"A reasonably decent and drinkable ale, reminiscent of other English and Scotch styles, with the added gimmick of surprisingly analogous banana bread flavors. Worth a try, might even have it again, but it isn't spectacular, just pretty good."

"I mention the sorbet/palate cleanser concept because I followed the Banana Bread Beer with a Ballast Point Sculpin IPA (my third bottle of the six pack), and found myself completely blown away with the flavor of the sculpin IPA, whereas the first two samples of that same six pack struck me as merely average. Could it be that the Banana Bread Beer sets the palate up for a new beer flavor? Based on my experience, I say it does.Worth a try just for the uniqueness alone."

"I own a bar in wisconsin, we specialize in micros and imports. Been doing it as a profession for 7yrs. I am not a beer expert but i know what i like. I like this beer! I drink a lot of jameson. When i want to ease off of drinking or have a relaxed drinking engagement this beer is a go to. Very drinkable and smooth. Not filling can have 3 or 4 in a row and its not overwhelming. Like a pilsner with a banana boost! Not sweet banana flavor its more savory. We do joke and say who put the banana laffy taffy in my beer! Hint of that flavor. It is a must try! Not steering you wrong to the expert and the green horns enjoy!"

"This very unexpected beer, have a good taste and a very good color. The taste and smell obviously remember us a banana beer. Despite it's very unusual, the beer is very good in overall. It has a poor neck but a correct carbonation and the mouthfeel surprising you at all. If you could, I recommend you to drink it even for a new experience."
""
""
""
"On tap. Pours amber with a long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of banana, yeast and bready malt. Body is full and slightly crisp. Taste is of banana, bready, caramel malt, earthy hops and brown sugar. Finish is sweet in the beginning then becomes dry. Delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
"Medium copper body topped by thin, poorly retained, pale beige head. Huge banana aroma with subtle cake batter and brown sugar nuances. One dimensional banana and toasted nut flavour profile with a very mild bitterness in the finish. A little bit of butterscotch that feels appropriate for this beer. Simple but pleasant. Light-bodied with low carbonation. Feels a bit on the thin side. Slight diacetyl slickness. If you like the taste and aroma of bananas then you'll probably like the scent and flavour of this beer, however, it could be much better with a more substantial mouthfeel."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Quite good as a slushy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a medium amber brown, thin head, no retention. Nice looking color. Smells of ripe bananas, fresh walnuts, bready malts, and sugary sweetness. I hope this isn't too overly sweet. Actually pretty well balanced. Not sickly sweet but definitely leaning that direction. Nice banana flavor. Not much hop bitterness to speak of but definitely heavy on the malty, caramel, bready side. Mouthfeel is thin, light, and slick. Nice consistency and I like the low level of carbonation. Overall a tasty beer that lives up to my expectations."
""
"Thinner medium body, decent carbonation, watery and sticky on the tongue. Basically a watered down, faux-sweet banana bread profile with some borderline-adjunct tendencies. Not terrible, but I wouldn't recommend this."
""
""
""
""
"(My partner wishes his car perpetually smelled like this beer.) Notes of vanilla, banana, bubblegum, and the initial sweetness is followed by an equal amount of bitterness. More banana than bread. Maybe a hint more carbonation than necessary. It tastes as if they took your favorite beer and infused it with banana shaped and flavored candy. We expected this to be darker and denser but overall not bad."

"Presentation Packaged in a custom 19.25 ounce (an imperial pint!) brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"O: Fun just buying the beer for the name, and exciting to have something different, but sadly not something I may buy again for personal use. Maybe I would think differently about it if it was a hot summer day, sitting by the camper, or right after I mowed the yard, but not feeling it mid December. Its light and crisp like a session beer, but not sure if I could hang with that flavor for knocking back a few."
""
""
"Passable, but still a novelty beer to my mind, or an attempt to cheat another, more interesting, style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fun and approachable beer. The banana taste is bold and clear, and this dominance might be enough to turn off drinkers who like to play with layers of complexity as they drink. Still, though, this is probably worth a try if the concept of a banana bread beer is enough to get you interested."
"A solid banana beer. The banana isn't overwhelming, and I wish I had bought another one."
""
"Overall - A good beer, especially for a fruit beer. Would recommend to try and will probably get again."

"O: this is one of the more interesting beers that I've found. It's quite the oddity but I have to say that it was worth satisftying my curiosity. There are some pretty bad fruit beers out there and I don't feel that this is one of them."
"O: It is what it is, banana beer. There's a definite appeal here, though I can't say I really enjoy this. Personally, I'd much rather have a hefeweizen with a more natural banana ester character over this one any day."

"This was given to me by a friend who heard I liked craft beer. She just picked a bunch of stuff from the craft beer section and this ended up in the bunch. In her defense the other stuff included some Dogfish head stuff, a Dead Guy from Rogue and some other good stuff. Anyway, I'd heard this was bad, and it was. Not as bad as I was expecting, but still, not good. I don't think it was the execution of the beer, but the concept. I hate pretty much anything banana flavored, except bananas themselves, and banana bread. I rank this somewhere between banana flavored candy and real banana bread. Mostly I couldn't handle the smell. Smelled like a banana peel that had been left in a hot car all day. It tasted okish, but the smell was always there. There's that."
""
"Overall not a bad brew, but not something I would want to drink a lot of."
""
"O: it is definitely interesting, the banana taste is definitely present but it isn't overwhelming...I like it but will likely only buy it on occasion when craving something very different"
""
""
"O- Not bad as a novelty. Don't think this would be very sessionable. It was definitely the unique brew I was looking. The alcohol content plays a subtle role in the taste with that hint of banana....I might try this again sometime, but don't see this being heavy in my rotation. Definitely worth a try."
""

""
""
"This beer really did have an unusual flavor of banana nut bread. The beer really had a crisp and small flavor profile that was more malt forward than hoppy, but the fruit portion was unusually perfect when compared to banana bread. I wouldn't be able to drink more than one of these in a session, but for an after dinner drink, or a drink to break away from the norm, this one really hit the spot. I was surprised that I did like this, as I didn't think it would be up my alley. I wouldn't go out of my way to find it, nor would I say it was a great beer or worth buying if I ever found it in bottles, but it was an enjoyable beer to sip on at a bar with some friends."
"this was a very good beer. the pour was perfect and the head was great! the color is almost a caramel/oak color and the smell is that of bananas, caramel, sugar, and nuts. the mouthfeel is nice and smooth, this beer will leave you wanting more. the first sip is full of banana flavor. i would reccomend this beer to anyone that wanted something different."

"Taste differs a bit, banana is not as present as in the aroma, where malt sweetness in predominant. Medium bitterness. Though banana comes back in the aftertaste."

"check it out any way you can"
"Overall, this is a good beer, especially for a fruit beer which I am not usually a huge far of. It smells weakly like banana bread, but this comes out a lot better in the flovor. It has a nice balance of beer and the banana -No problems in appearance and it isn't too sweet so that it is drinkable."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some artificial banana aromas. Taste is much the same with a watery flavor. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer and not a good example of a fruit beer in my opinion."

"Holy Crap, this is a Banana Moonpie!!! Somehow, this beer reminds me of a flavor of saltwater taffy. This should be tried at least once by every beer drinker, even if never again. It would be a stretch for me to finish a full glass of this, much less a second. That being said, I feel that if you ever loved sweets in your childhood, you will Love at least ONE sample of this beer."
"F***ING BANANA BREAD!!! THIS S*** IS BANANAS!!! B.A.N.A.N.A.S. Great specialty beer. While not my kind of beer I would certainly consider buting again if in the mood for some liquid dessert! Just goes to show that sweet done right can still please a hophead."

"500 ml bottle. Copper coloured beer. Smells like sweet baking banana bread, warm clove spice, baked bananas, bready and nutty as well. Noticeable spicy hop aroma as well. Flavour is sweet doughy and bready. Banana tastes real, no candyish character. A well-balanced and surprisingly tasty beer. I don’t think I’d want to make a session out of it, but for a change it’s pretty good"

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"The taste was even more spot on. I was skeptical to drop the money on this beer at first, but curiosity got the best of me. I was very impressed with the similarity between banana bread and this brew. Much more than just a banana flavor, which is what I originally predicted. The sweet-roasted after taste leaves you wanting more. If you ask me, the only tragic thing about this beer is the 11.2 oz bottle. I want those extra .8 damn it!"
""
"Overall a beer I was expecting to drink and soon forget, but I will remember this beer as being very subtle but still pronounced. Natural flavors win - no gimmicks here. I couldn't enjoy more than a bottle every now and then though. A beer begging to be paired with possibly a flourless chocolate cake or bananas foster?"
""
"Not as fruity as I was expecting... toasted walnuts, some unexpected pils-like hop notes, some banana, not too sweet, pretty unique... not thirsty for a second one but I enjoyed it."

"Bottle: Poured a clear light brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with minimal retention and some very light lacing. Aroma of banana notes is quite strong with light sweet notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by banana flavours with some sweet notes. Body is a bit light with medium carbonation. Interesting at first but the aroma gets to be a bit too much after a while."

"O: very nice. Definately one to drink again...but I like bananas."

"O – This is a really nice beer until that bitter and metallic taste comes into play. They certainly got the banana bread part right in the aroma and at the start of the flavor, so they definitely get points for that. The overall drinkability and enjoyability of the beer suffers due to the odd finish. All in all, this is an average fruit beer that was nice to try, but I probably won’t be looking for it again."

"Poured from their 1 pint .9 oz bottle found at the local Wegmans. Pours a nice amber color, distinct banana smell. They certainly got the banana bread taste down here. Nice malty finish, typical English ale. If flavored beer is thing or even just occasionally, I highly recommend this beer. Plus, at 5.2% alcohol, a good kick with the flavor."

"Light and whispy mouthfeel. Banana flavor throughout. Lightly toasted grain. Finishes like eating a piece of banana bread. Although brewed with real bananas, some of the banana flavoring seems artificial. Also for a beer called banana bread, i thought there would've been some more bready malt flavor along with a fuller mouthfeel. Great if you like bananas, but otherwise doesn't live up to expectations."

"Final Grade: 3.4, an acceptable B-minus grade in academic terms. Fruit beers have never really been my thing, but Wells Banana Bread Beer is an enjoyable example that I might just pick up again some time. Fans of banana bread are unlikely to be disappointed, because this beer really does emulate its flavour surprisingly well. Not my favourite Wells & Young offering by a longshot, but still a respectable brew that is worth at least one try."
"An interesting effort - the description of liquid banana bread is entirely justified. Plenty of banana on display and very sweet. The banana is very intense in the aroma, but balanced by a more obvious malt character in the flavour. The mouthfeel is too watery and doesn't stand up to the relatively strong taste. Overall it goes down better than expected, though I probably won't seek it out again. Worth trying."

"O - i was expecting a gimmic and it is BUT it is also a tasty one that is more than I expected and worth a try for sure, definitely tasty"
""
"Amber in color with a nice white fluffy head that sticks on top until the glass is empty. This beer really smells like banana...I didn't expect that. Taste more like banana biscuits but lot's of banana flavor. Decent beer to boot. A bit thin in the mouth. Nice beer to have from time to time. For a fruit beer it's pretty good."

"Overall: Not a daily beer, since I could see getting tired of the banana pretty fast with repetition. But tasty enough as a session ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable, quite interesting that the beer has the flavor and smell of banana bread so accurate. I liked this beer but it is not a sessionable one for me - I could see myself really enjoying this in the fall."
"In the larger 1pt .9 bottle. Good cloudy wheat beer color. Banana flavor didn't seem at all artificial to me. The bottle was nearer it's sell by date, weak foam head, and maybe that helped knock the strength of banana flavor down to normal levels? An enjoyable pint, but not one I'll have to buy again."

"Overall this beer taste some what like described, a mild bitter banana bread. Although it was a bit weaker and much lighter in flavor than the aroma suggested…"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was something that I had to try last year and found it to be just ""okay"" After gulping half the glass over the short time writing this review I've found myself to thoroughly enjoy it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color, with an off white head. In the aroma, it smells like banana Runts. In the taste, banana bread, with a pleasant note of cinnamon. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry ripe banana in the aftertaste. Just like what it's called, banana bread beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a pretty nice beer. I was hoping that it had more flavors pop out then just banana but it was a nice change of pace that needs to be tried once by everybody."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an ""interesting"" beer, but not a specially good one. I enjoyed the banana flavor in this one, unlike the previous fruity beers I've tasted, but the development (I don't know how to describe it in a better way) was not on par with my expectations. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something different, and maybe buy it again, but not if there's anything better."
"Not a bad beer overall, but I’d say a bit disappointing. Would be a fantastic beer for Thanksgiving and not so much for now (April 27)."

"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this beer...the aroma, the taste, ahhhh...I love anything banana and banana nut bread is one of my favorite desserts so imagine how excited I was when I saw this on a local pub's beer list. It met every expectation I would have of a banana bread flavored beer. Did not disappoint at all! Not overly fruity or sweet, but it is a dessert like beer. It was nothing short of fabulous!"
""
""
""
"This is an interesting beer tastes and smells like a bananna shake. A nice beer for dessert. I don't normally like fruit beers but this is nice and enjoyable."
""
"Had low expectations on this beer but actually enjoyed it. tastes like banana bread without being to doughy or malty. don't think I could drink it consistently but liked the experience."
""
""
"I love banana bread therefore the idea of a banana bread beer interested me. This brew definitely delivers on the bananas, the carbonation is a bit too much. The peppery hops are a nice touch but stronger malts would better balance out the overall taste."
""
""
""
"Prost!!!"
""
""
"Pours a dark golden copper amber with a small head and some lacing. Aroma of ripe banana, fruity with some malt. Taste is of ripe banana, light spicy fruitiness and some mild hops bitterness. Palate is a light body, moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet banana fruitiness, some malt balanced by a light hops bitterness. The banana flavor is not overpowering and not too sweet. Overall a light refreshing sessionable ale."
"I did love the smell of this beer. color looked nice. Co2 was harsh."
"Interesting. I like the whole concept how beer is food...aka...liquid bread and this is like banana bread. It was! I could taste the English ale maltyness, fresh hops, and of course the banana....it was tasty and could be paired with anything....real good if you were munching on nuts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not really something I'd want to buy or drink. There are other beers out there that provide a better banana flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was a bit suprising in that i actually liked the flavor, but i just didn't get the banana. Not bad, but not something i would buy again."
""
""
""
"O - Although it should probably be a 3.0, it gets half a bonus point for being so different. Won't have it again, but don't regret trying it and I think any beer drinking should."
""
""
"This beer is quite a journey. It looks normal, but then you are treated to a fresh baked banana bread loaf, then punched in the mouth with bitterness and a taste of your own blood. Weird beer."

"O: Surprisingly drinkable. Not terribly balanced. Not a big fan of artificial flavors either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The aroma of the beer is fantastic and in some ways sets you up for a disappointment in the taste and feel. I just expected something more chewy and bananay in taste; more banana bread in nature. Worth a try, but not something I would go to on any regularity."
""
""
""
""
"O- A good beer, one worth trying, but I don't know if I'll get it again."

"Overall, this is a good beer. The banana is rich and impacts the flavors in a positive way. The body and flavor could be better, but considering there aren't many beers with this flavor profile out there I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall the virtue in this beer is its unique quality, its ""banananess"" and it delivers in that sense. It was fun to drink, but not a brew for the ages."
""
""
""
"Honey-colored and lots of carbonation, but not much of a head (though some nice, white lacing). Label says ""Malt beverage brewed with bananas and banana flavor added."" The smell and taste of the beer remind me not of banana bread or even mashed bananas but rather banana-flavored salt water taffy (but not nearly as sweet). A bit too watery for my taste. I was expecting something with a little more heft."
"3.0 T: It's not bad, but, aside from the nose, it does fail to live up to its name. Taste is too weak and mouthfeel is too watery to take this seriously."
""
""
""
"O-A nice change of pace, no matter what it is that you are used to drinking. More than one (they come in 16.9 oz bottles) would be too much sweetness in one night for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed what I had."
""
""
"O: really tasty different beer. Promoted aptly. Really is what they say it's supposed to taste like, big banana bread flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad. Not great. I probably would have given this higher marks if that banana taste had been produced naturally either through brewing with bananas or via some kind of voodoo yeast magic. I would not be opposed to having this beer again, but I probably wouldn't seek it out."
""
"Poured this and compared along side an actual slice of banana bread. Poured a nice golden color with a thin head. The aroma is pretty much banana, and that's it. And sort of a fake banana smell, kind of like the runts candy banana. Same in the taste. A little malty, but just tons of banana that's not as fake as the candy, but not as real as an actual banana. Kind of thin, with nothing that really lasts. More of an interesting occasion beer than anything else."
""
""
""
""
"O - Worked extremely well in the recipe I had!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had seen this around for awhile and finally broke down and bought a bottle. Pours a clean amber with a yellow tinge around the edges. The head doesn’t last long and is soon just a thin film on top. Obviously there is a aroma of banana and mild spices like nutmeg. It starts off with a mild bitterness but soon mellows out to a fine drinkable brew. Going to try this with a beer bread mix sometime."
""
"Medium bodied, this beer travels well over the tongue, leaving nothing behind. It has a dry finish."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: it is what it says it is, spot on for the flavor but average the rest of the way"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If you see this in the supermarket, don't buy just one to sample, buy at least 2 because you're gonna want another."

"DOA"
"Overall, tastes like banana bread but is pretty intensely flavored. The mouthfeel could use some work too."
""
"Overall I'm glad I drank this. It's a novelty beer that's worth a sip or two, maybe not a full pint."
""
""
"Overall - Definitely something different.. I'm glad I tried this. It doesn't taste like the smell but it's still good."

"When I got this beer I never heard of Wells brewing company. Looking at the name banana bread beer my first thoughts were this mite be to sweet to swallow but I have been fooled before. This beer was amazing very impressed a great dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like the banana flavor but the beer is just a bit too hard for the soft banana."

"Wells Banana Bread Beer is a light looking lagerish beer with a hazed yellow color to it and a short lived burst of white bubbles on top, no stick. Smell is what is advertised, banana and a whole lot of it. Some cereal scent after all the hoopla, small amount of grain. Taste is less artificial than expected, i was expecting this to be a sweet sugar bomb, while it's more of a lightly sweet banana infused pale ale without the hops, if that makes sense. Feel is very light with a low amount of bubbled activity, kinda dead on the mouth. I drank it and that's that, not something I would go for again. A bottle of this would be ideal to split with a group of 5 people or so, with a banana infused dessert, or just simply dump the bottle into your next banana inspired dish."

"I wanted to like this beer; I certainly like bananas. It just wound up as a disappointment to me. Flavor is so-so at best and lacks that comforting hominess one associates with banana bread. Mouthfeel seems off and the whole thing just doesn’t gel all that nicely."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting beer to try, would go good with bread or dessert"
""
""
""
"(D)- A very strange beer, though fun and enjoyable, I really just see this as a novelty beer one would try once just to see what it is like."
""
""
"Overall: I had pretty low expectations for this brew based on what others had said, and I was still slightly disappointed, there really was no ""bread"" in the banana bread at all, and the banana was pretty much straight candy banana flavor, with nothing else going on complexity wise, probably a good experiment that shouldn't have gone farther than that."
""
""

"I bought some double chocolate and some banana bread from a local craft beer store. I will be trying the recipe out this Thanksgiving dinner after the meal and watching the game!"

"O - Much like the name, the flavor and aroma is quite gimmicky. Certain yeasts are capable of making a banana compounds, but adding actual bananas to the brew takes it too far."
"Finally, whatever that terrible astringency is coming from in the taste needs to be taken care of. It almost single-handedly makes this beer undrinkable."
"I wish it tasted more like it smelled. As it is, not horrible, but the hop profile was a bit too tuned up for the banana and it didn't mix too well."
"Pours a clear deep amber color with a modest head that displays decent retention and fair lacing. Smells like banana's all right. Slightly sweet malty aroma deep behind and hints of spices like nutmeg and all spice. There's a beer under there somewhere, but for me only a swirling of the glass brings it through the banana onslaught. Taste is a hint more beery. Sweet candy sugar and light grainy malt mixed with banana's. Smooth sweet almost creamy mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation with a medium body. I kind of enjoyed this, although It's not something I would have all the time. Extra credit for thinking outside the box."
"Reviewed from notes, enjoyed 09/16/11"
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass. This pours a light brown color with a nice white head. The smell is of banana and bread malts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is of banana and malts, surprisingly there is a little hop bite at the end."
"Overall / Drinkability: Overall - I think one must be a lover of bananas for this beer, and while I like them, I hesitate to call myself one who loves this flavor. Still, this beer really works well. It's well balanced, the banana comes through but does not overpower, and it's quite drinkable. I could see myself having a full pint, but that would be the end. Also, given what I said about having this with banana bread one evening (not this one) the beer is really best for an after meal treat or something with dessert. I think this beer would be quite bad with other food. Still, a good beer overall and if offered I'd have it again. Not sure though if I would buy it again. Neat beer, neat experience - not a staple beer I would drink all the time."
"Food match: Maybe a couple slices of banana bread would make this beer taste likewise. Wishful thinking?"
"This stuff is pretty good. I have never tasted anything like it. It will not be a go to beer for me but is still interesting and worth a try."
"(O) Not one that I would go on a search for, but it's a decent brew to have every now and then. I really can appreciate that it smells and tastes like banana bread. I've had several beers that speak of vanilla or other flavors and it might be present in the aroma but not at all in the flavor, but this beer is straight up what it claims to be."
"O: I like my banana bread with a bit of cream cheese. I tried the same with this beer and it does actually pair quite well. Overall, I thought the banana flavor in this beer was too artificial, but then again a real banana flavor - being more subtle - would probably disappear among the malts."
"O: It's interesting, to be sure. It's not the type of beer that I would drink all the time, but it's good as a novelty beer. And it delivers on what it promises: A banana bread beer."
"O: Definitely worth a try. It's a pretty unique beer. I might purchase this again if I'm in the mood. It certainly wasn't bad."
"It seemed like a weird beer, so I had to try it. It's not something I'll keep stocked in my fridge, but I'm glad I could mark it off my to-do list."
"O=Was hoping more for an amber or stout type consistency with darker hops presence. Not recommended."
"O: Not as sweet as I had anticipated, would have liked it better had the hops compleatly wiped away the bananna on the finish. Instead left a bit of an aftertaste that I was not a fan of. That being said, it was easy to drink, however not something I would buy(this one was a gift)."
"O: this is a solid fruit beer, although I wish the banana taste was a little more pronounced. The beer does a good job in introducing the banana on the nose but falls short when it comes to replicating that characteristic in the taste."
"Drinkability: Nice beer that has a hint of banana bread. Very easy to drink and goes down smooth."
"O-I like banana bread so this rates pretty high for me"
"O - A excellent beer that i would try without doubt. Nice style of beer, well developed. Not a banana overwhelming flavor."
"I""m not sure I need another one, but it does make you think. Maybe it needs hazelnuts. Or just a lot of malt and some burnt sugar."
"O - Not quite a sink-pour, mainly because I couldn't force myself to pour out such an expensive beer. My buddy with whom I split it also finished his, but after much longer than he normally takes. I'm surprised this comes from the same folks who make the tasty Double Chocolate Stout."
"The end."
"O - Really interesting beer. I like that the banana is obvious and that you don't have to dig for it. Too bad its so expensive. Had this once before but I think I like it much better this time around."
"Overall: I love the taste of banana in beer, which is why I am drawn to the Hefeweizen and Dunkelweizen styles. I figured with a name that has ""banana bread"" in it then I must try it. I would probably buy again but can't see committing to more than a bottle at a time. Certainly not a session beer but a ""should try"" if you enjoy banana flavor in your beer."
"Pours a light copper color with a foamy off-white head. The smell is dominated by fresh and fruity banana there is a slight tang to it and some nutty malt. It tastes mostly of banana bread (not surprisingly) with some sweet malt and a peppery hop accent. The beer is light with low but sharp carbonation and a pleasing finish. This is a solid and straight forward beer, nothing to complain about here."
"overall - Enjoyable, something different. Doubt that I'd search for it again as it's not what I want out of a beer."
"Not a bad idea, though this is decidedly a gimmick."
"o: This is definatly a try one time only brew for me.It was pretty crazy with bananas probably too much. If you love bananas this is for you."
"o: worth it. not what i expected, but better."
"The color when poured was a dark amber brown with a minimal amout of foam, with a fair amount of lace on the side of the glass. The Smell of banana and yeast was evident in the aroma. The taste was of banana, bread yeast and caramel. Nicly balance of sweetness/tartness that made this ale pleasant to drink. This is a very interesting ale that I would buy again and again."
"overall i loved this beer... but i also love banana bread so if you don't like banana bread don't bother... not sure if it is a real or artificial flavor but i don;t care because it was delicious."
"It seems like a simple principal: I like banana bread. I like beer. I should like banana bread beer. But I don't, it's pretty mediocre. I still go to Weihenstephaner hef when I need a beery banana."
"O: I don't know if I could drink a lot of this, but I really liked drinking this beer. Very easy to drink and not too sweet for a fuit beer."
"Overall it was interesting but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Appearance has a nice copper color with a crisp dissapating head. Smell has the upfront banana bread aroma with the malt in the back. Taste has a good balance bringing out the bananas with the malt and hop. Mouthfeel is closer to medium that IMO should have a lower carbonation to bring out a softer flavor. Overall a very nice beer that brings out what it says it is."
"O - Something different for sure. I might try it again sometime."
"O - Overall this is just an pretty average beer. Buy one and move on!"
"This beer pours out a clear copper color with a tiny head. The smell is very nice, bananas, candy sweetness, and bready malts. The taste is a bit bizarre, but still pretty good. The ""banana bread"" and the ""beer"" parts of this beer seem to exist on two different planes that are forced together when I sip this. The beer hangs out on one side, with a decent bready caramel malt presence, even if it's kind of watery. The banana bread is over on the other side, being all delicious and stuff. They never quite coexist to become as delicious as they can be, but it's still enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, and the drinkability is decent, but can strain due to sweetness. Overall, an interesting beer, but truly a one and done."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Overall, it's a great beer to try, but probably not a repeat brew."
"Poured a clear, light brown with a thin white head that settled to a light haze. I thought this would be darker for some reason. Smells like...bananas. Banana RUNTS actually. I know they use ""real banana"" in this, but I can't help that it smells artificial. Perhaps banana is just a tough flavor to pull off. Anyways, there's some sweet caramel malt in there, too. I guess you could use your imagination and see where the ""bread"" comes from, but I'm not digging it. Taste follows the nose closely, mainly banana and some sweet malt flavors of coffee and cocoa powder. Too sweet. Body is thin with moderate carbonation. I can understand why some people like this, but it just isn't my thing. Pass."
"Probably this is the best fruit beer I've drank, not overly sweet, just right."
"O: I thought the smell was fantastic, and the taste, although not what I expected, was well done. It was a bit high priced, so I doubt I'll be buying this often, but I'd gladly have more."
"Overall this beer is exactly as billed, although I’m not sure I could drink more than one in a sitting. It was interesting to have the banana influence without the spices (as in most weizens) though, and worth a shot."
"O - Interesting drop this. Very sweet. Despite this one being 2 months past its best before date, I thoroughly enjoyed it. A very nice wintery desert beer."
"Overall - this is a unique beer that if u r looking for something different it will work. Thanks to spinrsx for sharing, was a nice split."
"Would recommend to any banana bread aficionado..."
"Overall-I don't like this beer. However, I do have to give them some props. Although I will probably never drink this again, I would reccomend it to the right person."
"Overall a good brew! It's like a hefe on steroids. This would make a great dessert beer."
"o: Great smell to this that makes you love it. The taste holds up to the smell in the beginning but leaves you underwhelmed as it becomes too water. I'd get this again once in a while when I'm looking for a sweeter brew which won't fill you up."
"Overall, a disappointment, even though my expectations were not particularly high. I like banana bread a lot, but I think I will stick to the real thing. The beer would be improved somewhat if it was not in a clear bottle, and was not subject to being skunked."
"I tried this beer on June 11, 2011 after purchasing at one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent red colour with a very thin white cap. The aroma was banana, spices, grainy malt, and floral hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour is mild fruit, spices, and acidic maltiness."
"Overall, a great tasting beer to share with friends, especially those afraid of hoppier beers."
"D: The alcohol doesn't come through at all, but no less, it's not particularly pleasant to drink because of the strange flavor combination."
"D - It has several issues, but it is still tasty. I'd recommend splitting a bottle with 2-3 people, as this is infinitely better in small doses."
"The beer peeled out of the bottle at a speed unrivaled by any CANned beer. It really took me by surprise, so I got yellow and ran away until it had a chance to settle. The head was a puffy, pillow-y two-plus fingers of thick, yellow-white head that held in until a big exhalation of CO2, when it fell all at once. By Gar, I can smell bananas everywhere! Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Now, if you thought BUPGOO! was wrong in being marketed to the kiddies, this is so far afield that I cannot believe that it exists. I am going to see if my current beau (she from ""Cabaret"" - 'If You Could See Her') approves. She does! Oh, my darling monkey. Wait, I see a monkey with a bomb! It's Inspector Clouseau yelling about ""A minkey with a bimb!"" or somesuch. These Brits ... it's so hard to tell what they're on about at times. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, so maybe he was saying something about it being thin. Why can't the British speak English? It's so confounding! Now, it's ""Planet of the Apes"" - Get your hands off of my banana beer, you damn dirty ape! It's irresistible to the simian set, apparently. Have you ever seen Woody Allen in ""Bananas""? He sports a Che/Fidel beard that lends itself to my nickname. Taste was as advertised - bananas with a hint of caramel. Finish was very banana and if I liked bananas, that would be a good thing. The hops monkey on my back nodded in agreement."
"O - Drain pour. As much as I love banana bread this doesn't taste good at all."
"Probably won't go for it again; might be nice mixed with another alcohol like vodka, as a flavoring for a mixed drink...It lacked hopping and body."
"Overall – Well.. it tasted kind of like banana bread I guess.. It's definitely worth trying this beer just for novelty. I'm not sure I could drink more than 1 in a sitting though. I don't think I'd buy it again."
"O: One and done for me."
"Moderately dark straw with a thin ring of off white foam. Surprisingly pleasing aromas of over-ripe banana, vanilla,brown sugar, perfume. Sweet with medium bitterness to balance. I like the sweetness in this one. Good dose of bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied, quite active carbonation, but also creamy. Enjoyable."
"Pretty good dessert or ""snack"" beer and not overly sweet despite having both corn and sugar. Could be a regular pickup alongside Young's Double Chocolate Stout."
"O - disappointing effort from Wells - an interesting beer but it can't overcome all of its apparent shortcomings"
"Pale amber/orange colour, light white head, no lace. Smell is almost identical to a banana popsicle, malty and fairly big in that department but you would never know it from all the banana. Taste is banana, malt rolls in and brings a nice bitterness with it, biscuity with banana in finish and aftertaste. Medium body and slightly syrupy, mild carbonation. This isn't bad and quite different, I could drink this again but not for a good little while though this may just not be my thing."
"Clear bottle...pours into a mug a pale golden with a good size banana coloured head. Nose is banana esters and malty. Taste is rather subdued and weak. Subtle hints of a hefe in the esters present, certainly a banana taste and more malt in the flavour. Mouthfeel is light and watery. Overall a dissapointment, weak on flavour and gimmicky, not to be revisited. Shame since I really enjoyed Wells Dbl Choc Stout."
"Coppery amber color with moderate cap of khaki head. Muted notes of fresh baked banana bread, lightly nutty, some hints of sweetness. Taste is much more in line with banana bread in this presentation, solid lightly sweet bready malts comine with bannana and bubble gum notes from the yeasts. Only negative to say is there is a slightly watery grape presence towards the back end of the taste. Medium bodied, mildly carbonated. Improvement over bottle - accomplishes its goal."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. Splitting it with a friend is the way to go, and it makes a good night opener. The subtle banana flavor adds enough to make it interesting without cheapening it. Worth a spin."
"O - Worth a try, but at $6.00 a bottle there's certainly better beers to buy. A bit of a novelty, but a decent attempt nonetheless."
"O- Overall I feel let down. I wanted to get that big banana flavor but the bitterness is what stands out most to me."
"I wasn't expecting much but my curiosity got the better of me. I think the idea could be pulled off but this isn't it. Skip this one."
"This beer is definitely something to try for the novelty of it. I didn't find it to be a complete drain pour, although I did only have about 6 ounces or so of it, I could stomach it. It's pretty sickening after a while and something I cannot fathom why anyone would drink this more than once. Nice try, Wells."
"Fairly easy drinking. Not too sweet, and low-ish alcohol."
"Overall, I have a hard time recommending this beer. It was an interesting experiment, but I certainly won't be buying it again. It's one of those things that you try just to say that you've tried it."
"Overall- When I first seen the name banana bread beer I almost jumped all over it, I thought wow what a cool concept if they could actually pull it off, and to be honest this one has gone above and beyond my expectations coming through and delivering on all perspectives. Thank you to the LCBO for bringing this one in for the summer release because I will be going back tomorrow to stock up on more before they all disappear. A great beer that does exactly what it says and is not overpowering while doing it. Wells & Young’s makes some great almost underrated beers that for the few that I have tried I have thoroughly enjoyed."
"Overall a good beer. It would go great with some dessert. Not my idea of something to drink a lot of but great when your in the mood for something different."
"O: See taste. Worth trying, but I probably wouldn't have another."
"O: This beer isn't necessarily bad, but it is too unfocused and uneven."
"Overall, this beer proved to fall into the ""buy it once for novelty"" category. Try it if you must, but don't set expectations too high. There are far better dessert beers out there."
"  I would drink this time and time again if it was readily available. The bottles, however, are larger and it is not sold in 6 packs, only by the bottle. It's imported from England. Regardless, I would totally buy this beer again. I wonder if this was served in a restaurant if they would serve this with a banana wedge on the rim of the glass? Talk about fruiting your beer! "
"O: Not bad overall, but definitely is a novelty beer. Smells fantastic and tastes OK. I can't imagine buying it again."
"O - i have big dreams for this beer, the aroma is outstanding. i feel like the idea is awesome the execution was just not perfect. this is not the first time ive had it, its been about a year although i may want more from it i think im going to get it more often and see how well it will fuse with some stouts. HELL YES, SON"
"The mouthfeel is rich without being heavy and this beer is very drinkable. Excellent and highly recommended."
"interesting!"
"The beer pours a golden copper color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the banana syrup with a little bit of malt mixed in. The flavor is more of the same. I get some banana and toffee malt, as well as a little bit of brown sugar. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. It definitely tastes like bananas, but after a while the beer gets a little hard to drink."
"O - I love beer, and I love banana bread. This brew gives both. My experience is most ""fruit"" beers don't taste like beer, or the fruit... and each of the flavors are ruined in trying. This beer marvelously accomplishes both giving a beer that tastes like a beer... but also tastes like banana bread. Definitely worth a try if you like both. Works exceptionally well when paired with puddings or flan as dessert."
"O: I was completely baffled by this beer. As you probably read, there were a lot of aspects that surprised me about it. Anyway, it turned out pretty well. I consider this a bit of a novelty beer, and it’s not necessarily something I’d seek out again. However, if it came up on tap somewhere, I might give it another go in the name of good fun."
"The beer is a light brown color with not much foam. It smells and tastes just like banana bread, as you would expect. I can also taste slight notes of caramel and maple syrup. It tastes sweet, but not too sweet. The mouthfeel is a little too watery. I wish it could be fuller. It is an overall good beer that I will definitely try again."
"This beer is definitely something that a little different. This beer pours out as a nice hazy light brown color. The head is thick fluffy and white. The aromas are exactly what you expect... Banana and Bread. The smell is dead on. There's not question about that. The taste is pretty much spot on too. The beer has a strong Banana flavor up from that turned into a bready dryness after you swallow. This beer is pretty tasty but I wouldn't want a ton of it all at once. I feel that the flavors are too sweet and are too much to have more than one in a sitting."
"Overall: Interesting, but doesn't quite cut it for me as there is something about the combination of bananas, hops and mineral water that I just fail to appreciate"
"That said, reasonably drinkable, although I could see myself getting tired of it after one or two. Not bad."
"D- Low Just not as advertised. Didn't pick up any Banana bread notes."
"pretty basic and tastes very synthetic, it's not that it tastes bad but it doesn't taste like beer to me. pretty average and I'm not sure what market they're trying to target with this one"
"Overall I could enjoy these during Christmas or with a thanksgiving dinner, nothing to seek out if unavailable but it is decent."
"A Banoffee Pie sort of beer!"
"O - It's a good beer if you're in the mood for bananas."
"O: Very drinkable but not as much banana as I wanted. Decent try."
"O - Overall somewhat of a letdown after the great aroma. Was difficult to finish the bottle of this. Glad I tried this but likely wont pick this up again anytime soon"
"A unique type of ale that y'all should try at least once. No cloying sweetness to worry about. Helps if you enjoy banana-esque flavor, but even that's not overdone."
"Banana bread beer - an interesting idea but only average execution here."
"D - More drinkable than one might expect. Not overpowering."
"M/D: Nice and smooth, exceptionally drinkable. Absolutely loved this one."
"But even though I usually like flavored beers more than most people, this barely works. It beats chilli beer. I probably rated it a bit higher than I should have."
"D- 3.5 I could enjoy several of these. The only thing that may hold me back is its sweetness, but that's a personal preference. It is light enough that it really isn't filling, not necessarily what you'd think of with banana bread. It's an impressive take on the concept. The aromas and initial flavors of the brew are worth a shot for anyone that enjoys both banana bread and a good brew."
"Serving type: bottle"
"It's a pretty medium copper color with very little carbonation or foam. The aroma is a nice banana even though it seems a tad artificial. The taste really is like banana bread, not as sweet or spicy as I'm used to, but it's good. It goes down ok but it seems to leave a slightly metallic aftertaste. It's ok."
"D: Definitely drinkable. Very interesting to try and I think I might actually get this one again as well."
"The banana taste is also not overpowering. It is smooth though perhaps a bit too carbonated. The ale comes first with the fruitiness second. Dry at the end. It is a nice ale, but not a particularly spectacular taste overall. Worth it to try as Wells&Young have a stellar reputation, but I would personally stick to the Bombardier."
"I went out to the beer store to try out something new that I had never tried before. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this beer, but I was surprised at how great it tasted. If you ever want to try something different that is enjoyable, give this beer a chance!!!"
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink because the banana taste isn't gimmicky and is balanced to some degree by the flavors of malts and hops, however I couldn't drink more than one of these at a time."
"D- The beer tastes and goes down very smoothly.I would definelty have this bber again. It is also a good beer to have several of, if thats what you're looking for."
"Can't stop smelling this beer. Rich and delicious banana bread aroma. Yum. Color is a nice dark amber, moderate head when poured into Young's pint glass. Flavor is a much more subtle version of the nose. Mild banana supported with a solid malt backbone akin to maybe an English bitter. Not too sweet, not too hoppy. Really enjoyable beer. I think I could have several. Great to share with a domesticated primate after a meal."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium. To me this beer is was hard to drink. The flavor were all over the board and not consistant. I really was hoping that this beer would be a lot better than this."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, I was expecting worse but was pleasantly surprised to find that this beer wasn't too bad"
"A different beer, worth a try for it's uniqueness."
"D - Very easy to drink, well balanced and tasty for the fruit beer option. A nice desert beer."
"I've tried this seeming oddity before, but haven't been able to remember much about it. 'Til now. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of light dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, nutmeg, light cinnamon, and rye bread. So far it seems to live up to its name. The taste brings in the same elements, along with some raisins and a touch of fake banana flavor, not entirely unlike that found in certain yellow Runts (full disclosure: it's my favorite flavor of Runt, but it doesn't quite do it for me here). The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice beer, nothing really outstanding by any stretch, but it could have been bone-chillingly worse given the desired final product."
"D- As much as I love this beer, I'd be good after no more than say 2 pints...no offense intended! It's just so flavorful, the alcohol is very well hidden and would be the perfect desert beer....I could see myself enjoying this with some cake and ice cream! I highly recommend this to anyone, amateur and expert alike!"
"D: very good...tasty, probably one my top 10 favorites"
"I'd call this a stunt beer, and it's a successful stunt. In the fruit beer spectrum it's in the mellow end of the spectrum from the more tart cherry and berry varieties. Worth at least a try if you're open to fruit beers, and if fruit beers are a fave for you, this could become a regular."
"fruit beers are my favorite. I like em spicey and sweet. Wells bananabread beer delivers on both counts. The smell is great. It smells as if you're baking banana bread right in your glass. I think over all this beer would appeal to both fruit beer lovers and beer fundamentalists. This is a real beer with real beer flavor and just the right amount of banana and spice flavors. I think the pairing works really well and combines to accomplish something out of the ordinary and great. One of me all time favs."
"While this isn't even close to being a favorite of mine, I'd say that within this category this is a pretty good beer."
"D-Regardless what other people have said about this beer's concept and execution, I can't knock it. It's successful within the parameters of what the brewer was trying to accomplish. I enjoyed it."
"D-You'll probably want to stop after one. But it's a hell of a clever idea well worth trying."
"D: Ok, this is a beer that I have avoided for nearly 10 years, now I know why. It is just ok. If it was heavier body, slightly darker might have been delicious, but too watery for me. Try it with a friend, no need to seek this out."
"I enjoy this one on an early weekend morning or late evening."
"Nice clear brown color. Minimal head with a light lacing. Great aroma's of banana, wheat and spices. Has a good bitter spice taste with a good portion of banana in there as well. Good balance of bitter and smooth flavors. Finishes nice with a after taste leaving you thinking you had a slice of banana bread."
"Some may love/hate a dessert beer or one that is flavored with something like banana, but I do enjoy this one in moderation. It is not overdone in the least. It accurately encompasses the banana bread vibe without sacrificing the beer itself."
"D - A few sips were interesting but 3/4 of the bottle was a drain pour."
"New 11.2 oz bottle super fresh stuff best by 4/20/11. Pours a deep amber copper hue with a bright off white cream colored head. Fine speckled lacing scattered on the sides of my chalice. Nose is straight up banana syrup, with some sweet underlying caramel malts. Flavor actually has a balanced level of sweetness, upfront though it's banana split/banana fosters with a dry finish and nice mineral water character. I've passed on this for quite some time, glad I tried it. There's a nice banana flavor that comes through with caramelized sugars bringing dessert like notions to mind. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is mellow nothing heavy or harsh. The sweetness is initially a bit cloying but it fades nicely on the back end of the palate. Drinkability overall is decent something that will peak the interests of non beer folks, but not something I want to session with."
"D - Too fruity sweet for my palate to drink exclusively for an entire night, but I would definitely pick up a bottle once in a while."
"D - Hefe lovers might enjoy this more than others, due to the banana-like flavors that are often found in such beers. Very drinkable and tasty. Would definitely have another."
"-nooot bad. i came in expecting to pour half of it out, but i think i shall finish er off"
"D - Not digging this as much as I did before. Smell and taste is a bit too artificial for me, resulting in an almost fake tasting brew. Just didnt do it for me."
"I liked it and think it would make a refreshing summer patip beer"
"It is not overly carbonated, a little fizz on the tongue with a warming aftertaste in the mouth complimented by the fruitiness. It goes down quite smoothly and easily, nor is it very expensive, so with 5.2% abv, you may want to be careful."
"Wells Banana Bread Beer has a dark yellow colour and a good 3 cm head that lasts awhile. The smell is mixture of banana and yeast... banana bread! This beer starts out with hops and banana esters. The finish is pretty smooth, though the banana flavour remains. This beer really is like banana bread, but it's a little too much for me."
"Will definitely buy again!"
"D-very drinkable, made me want another"
"Glancing over other reviews it seems that Wells Banana Bread is a fairly divisive beer. I'm not entirely sure why. I found it to be a fairly conventional, commonplace English ale, albeit with some banana flavour. It should be straightforward enough: Do you like beer? Do you like banana? Chances are you already know whether this interests you."
"Bottom line - Underwhelming and uninspired. Definitely tastes nothing like banana bread."
"D- the banana was a little much, so I wouldn't want more than one of these."
"While the constituent components are all there, they seem to come off as individual players, disjointed, rather than the supple blend that is yer two-week old bananas and sugary bread (and chocolate chips, can't forget those!). A mere curiosity, as far as beer is concerned, but relatively high on the drinkability scale for its ilk."
"Very clear but dark oak in color. Has a nice head but virtually no lacing. The color and how transparent it is is quite remarkable. Nose is bananas, bubblegum, peppery. Not so different from a Hefeweizen to me. The sweet banana is most prominent. Think Laffy Taffy. Would get higher marks but it is a bit subdued. Not so much of a banana flavor here. Heavy does of wheat with a peppery finish and the banana kind of lingers in the background. Throw a little more banana in there and we would have a winner! Overall taste is a bit weak and watery in itself but at least it isn't offensive. Mouthfeel is great and I can say it would be easy to drink in the summertime. Overall glad I tried it. Wouldn't mind trying this again. Especially in the summer."
"The smell of this brew is more impressive than the brews tastes and mouthfeel. Pretty good brew, but once the novelty wears off it is not really something I could session."
"Drinkability- Wells really hit it on this one! I could only drink one glass of this beer because of how different it was. Probably would give you a stomach ache if you had too much of it! Tough to say this beer's drinkability."
"Overall: I'm sorry I bought a 4 pack...I wish I had bought a single."
"Not bad -- one of these every once in a while is a nice treat. I'd pair it with -- banana bread -- if you have any."
"Starts off strong. Nice retention on the head, amber color, crystal clear, with tiny carbonation bubbles. All downhill from there. Aroma is what you might expect, bananas and a bit of caramel sweetness, not bad. Decently soft up front with the bananas the predominant flavor. After that nothing. No middle or finish, like a banana flavored light beer. Some bitterness in the end, but not enough to make this beer interesting. Medium bodied. A novelty that's worth one try, but that's it."
"Out of the bottle the smell of banana is the first thing you notice. The color is a nice copper color. The taste is not as strong as the smell but it is subtle and nice. Carbonation is on the light side but that makes the beer smooth like a nice banana bread. You are left with a nice after taste of banana's. I would drink this again but would not make it a part of the regular rotation."
"There is more carbonation than I really like, but this beer is pretty smooth and has a dry aftertaste, very drinkable, but again nothing special."
"Overall: Not a big fan of this one. Looks ok and smells ok but the taste and mouthfeel leave a lot to be desired."
"A bit pricey in NYC at $5.99 for a 1 pint 9 oz bottle, but I will definitely return to this again and again, perhaps savoring it just for 'special' occsasions."
"Clear copper color with little head retention. Has a mashed ripe banana smell with sprucey / piney notes. The taste reflects the aroma.. the banana fruit is balanced with a light piney hop flavor. Not an overbearing fruit beer. It is light in body and very drinkable with a clean finish."
"I get a lot of banana and malt from this beer. Its one I want to try homebrewing, but I am afraid this beer wont disappear for years if I make 5 gallons."
"Overall, I would buy again and make it a regular in my rotation."
"For some reason I am attracted to concoctions like this offering from Well. Pours a good looking pour with frothy white bubbles that don't last. Smell was a potent banana bread smell. They weren't lying. It had a more smell than taste but thats good. Otherwise it would be over-powering. It had a pleasant mouthfeel and was a very balanced brew. However, one is probably enough."
"Overall - Nothing special but its drinkable and light in flavor. Smooth, no hop bitterness and a hint of bannana flavor. Something to try and say you've tried it then move on."
"Pours out a light amber with a thin, whispy head that manages to maintain some decent lacing. Smells like banana bread, with some strong aromas of vanilla and buttery white cake icing, and the flavor matches the smell very well. Tastes like candied bananas, someone posted the resemblance to the banana runts and they were spot on. A very sweet and rich beer, definitely a dessert pairing brew, while at the same time, managing to bring about characteristics of the malts and a nice hop bitterness that lingers around after each sip. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side, but the beer itself is quite rich, with a fairly high carbonation level. All in all, a good beer for what its worth, more of a novelty or a one time attraction."
"This is an interesting, semi-drinkable beer but I think it belongs paired with food. It's too odd to stand alone. It would definitely make a good breakfast beer, maybe with some fried potatoes, bacon, and eggs. Yum!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"D: Low ABV and good flavors make this pretty damn drinkable. May not be everyone's cup tea, but it is worth looking at to try something different."
"go for one just to try it really to me it tastes like a sweet yuengling"
"*- Overall, I have a confidence now in whatever the Wells & Young's Ltd Brewing Company does. This beer is called Banana Bread Beer, and truely lives up to that title. Great beer that would be great with your Sunday brunch, or with desserts like Pumpkin or Peacon Pies. EXCELLENT BREW!"
"Dr: I'd have it again and recommend it to friends as a good fruit beer."
"I love this beer and completely satisfied with my selection. I was completely love the smell and aroma of the beer and reminds me of banana bread. The clear color is beautiful. The pour of the beer into the glass was smooth. The mouthfeel was smooth."
"D-drinkability depends on situation. a night out with the guys: not for me. summertime at the pool: i'll have this all afternoon!"
"Finish was also poor in my opinion. There is almost a 'skunky' beer finish under the banana flavors. The slight banana aftertaste is also unpleasant."
"Overall, this is a nice novelty brew, but it's not even the best beer I've had with bananas in it (I'm a huge fan of dunkels)"
"D: Worth trying once, but I wouldn't drink more than one in one sitting. Very recommended for people who enjoy fruity beers."
"D - Very drinkable. For a novelty beer the flavors aren't over the top so it doesn't overwork your palate."
"This beer is amazing. Its a little sweet, smooth tastes like bananas but not to the degree that it's unpleasent as it finishes with a wheat taste. I can't overemphasize how smooth this beer is, the low alcohol isn't even detectable and overall I find it about as drinkable as beers can come."
"Drinkability suffers because I don't like sparking water. Would not buy this again. Too bad, I was hoping to like this one."
"Look this is drinkable, they didn't do a bad job. But I have two philosophical questions for you? 1) Why brew beer with actual bananas when there are already beers with stronger banana flavors simply from the yeast and natural process used?, and 2) Why brew beer with actual bananas if in fine print at the bottom of the label it says ""banana flavor added"" (meaning they cheated to get to this level of banana-ness)? Clearly simply adding bananas to the brew doesn't get the job done. What you have here is apparently the wine cooler version of banana-like beer."
"Overall this is an extremely drinkable ""flavored"" beer. I couldn't drink it all night because of it's uniqueness but is one of my favorites for a ""dessert"" substitution. If you combine half this beer with Young's Double Chocolate stout, you will be in for a real treat! You can thank me later..."
"This s--t is bananas B-A-N-A-N-A-S. This is the beer I envision everyone being forced to drink in hell."
"Drinkability- This beer goes down extremely well and if the taste were more prevalent, I would definitly enjoy more than one in a sitting."
"D - Im glad I tried this one, as it was certainly interesting. In fact, it was quite enjoyable, but I dont see myself ever buying this again. I would love to see a porter or stout that could live up to the nose of this unique beer. The rich buttery smell and flavors just beg for a chewy big body to savor."
"D- Very delicious. Complex and deep with nutty flavors dominate. Rich and hints of spice. Very nice. Slight hops and well balanced. Vanilla tones set this one off from the regular."
"This beer had about a one finger head. It's smell consisted of a strong aroma of bananas and also had a nutty smell. It does smell very much like banana bread. It was medium bodied. It had a good level of drinkability and felt smooth, but I would find it difficult to drink more than one or two in one sitting."
"Overall drink on this one is kinda rough, you expect a bit stronger flavor, but by the time your done, it feels you have ate a loaf of banana nut bread. This would not be a good session beer at all. A novelity of course, but would still have one again if offered. Might not seek to purchase again though."
"D- I really wish this beer tasted more like real banana's. I love the idea of the beer, I just don't think it was excicuted very well."
"Copper color, 1 finger head. Smells like nuts and bananas (Success!) Tastes like banana bread Lots of nuttiness and banana flavor The banana fruit flavor comes across really big, it's like drinking banana pudding or banana nut bread something like that. I like it when a beer that's supposed to be flavored like something tastes just like it! medium body mouthfeel with pretty good drinkability. I like this beer, glad i tried it. Althow i think they should make a porter/stout version of this one, kind of like youngs double chocolate but youngs dbl banana"
"This has been a beer I have been afraid to try but I made the leap and wow this is great! The apperance is an average brown. The smell is remarkable, banana and nuts just like banana bread. The taste is exactly would you should expect out of the name... you can taste the bananas and the nuts with a backing of booze. Really good beer, not something to pound, its farly light and not overly sweet."
"Loved this beer, awesome taste. Will drink it again but not often seeing the 9 dollar pricetag was a little much"
"Around a finger's worth of slightly off-white head, comprised mainly of larger bubbles which means little retention, lackluster lacing as well. Super-clear copper orange color with a darkening reddish aspect, a few lazy bubbles here and there within. Banana goes through loud and clear in the nose, however, fresh and light, not in any estery fashion, cinnamon and vanilla too, sponge cake, lighter granola, lemon yogurt, perhaps a hint of cherry as well. Light-bodied, light enough that the active carbonation prevents a lot of the flavor from soaking in. The banana, fig, pear fruit attenuated, the same for the bread to cake aspect. The lemon and vanilla fold into each other, the spiciness and nuttiness takes a couple of steps back. Without more richness of flavor, the carbonation keeps plowing ahead, detracts from mouth feel. Otherwise, inoffensive and innocuous."
"D: Hmm, almost a tough one to call. If you haven't tried it, try it. Not something you'd want to drink a few of but a decently drinkable session brew. Its like an English hefewiezen, with the wheat-beer style flavoring and the tangy finish."
"My wife picked this one up one day while we were out beer shopping, and we split the bottle with a friend. Poured a light brown color, with a small, quickly disappearing, white head. Aromas of bananas, but not real bananas, more like banana laffy-taffys. On the palate, more banana flavors (some real/some fake), brown bread and a hint of earthy hops. Fairly one dimensional, and really not very good."
"D: Not very drinkable considering it's novelty 100% and it tastes so much like banana nut bread you'll be tired of it half way through that is if you don't like eating a whole loaf of it at one time."
"MD- At first it takes like a nice hefeweizen, but then the sweetness hits, and there is a little to much sweetness. I might give this another try but I am not sure I could drink more than one."
"Notes: Is and Isn't what I was expecting. I was kind of expecting a hefeweizen style for what ever reason. I'm guessing this is more like a Bitters brewed with bananas rather than relying on a bavarian yeasts banana like esters."
"drinkability: Glad I tried it but won't be looking for it again. Good for those looking for a mild, decent session fruit beer. I was kind of hoping it would be a ridiculous creamy rich milkshake of a beer. Not so much."
"Hey, what can I say, it tastes like Banana's...a little. The beer poured golden for the most part in color with the head dissapearing instantly..the taste of banana was there, light and not over powering, for those who like a beer with just a hint of banana flavor, this may be the one for you."
"Poured into a 12oz. AC/DC collector's series pint glass. Copper in color with a 1 finger tan head. Strong aroma bursting with with banana, fruits, malt and, of course, banana flavorings. It does actually taste like banana bread but a bit synthetic tasting. Not over powering at all. Only a slight taste of alcohol. A drinkable beer but in the end not too outstanding. This is a good bear to pair with (I have to say it) banana bread."
"Drinkability is average, but if you really like banana nut muffins or banana bread then crank up the drinkability higher. A great novelty beer for anyone that like bananas. If you don't like bananas then stay away."
"Banana bread poures a darker amber color with a small head that stayed throught the beer. It smells very sweet and very much like banana. The taste is initally very sweet strong banana flavors then finishes a bit harshly. Easy to drink but the harsh aftertase holds it back. Overall enjoyable if you like bananas, very unquie i would drink this one again."
"Liquid banana bread? Like mom used to make? Let me at it! I was wary at first with the possiblity of the Runts fake banana taste but I was pleasantly surprised. Taste was literally banana bread tasting. Nutty, real ripe bananas, a hint of nutmeg and nothing overly sweet about it. Quite refreshing in fact. That was was what over powered the brew but it was thouroghly enjoyed."
"D - Definitely a solid, tasty brew that I wouldn't hesitate to drink again, but seems to miss on the banana somewhat"
"I absolutely love this beer, I have never seen or even heard of a banana beer so I had to try it. In my opinion it has a mildly average taste of banana..which is just enough. Its light, has a very nice color and aroma. I bought two, one to drink and one to store. I really wish i know more about banana beers and what kind of hops and grains goes into this Wells beer. any feedback would be great!"
"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle no. 23/03/11-A-L0083-04:04. Sampled on September 7, 2010. The pour is copper-amber with a lot of fluffy tan head that slowly pops downward although it remains about a quarter inch thick. The aroma bursts with banana flavorings, tropical fruits, and a malt character. The taste had a solid bitterness with banana flavorings mixed in. It lives up to its name."
"Final thoughts: Would recommend it, but personally would probably not buy again."
"Banana, banana, banana, and more banana. This is a good once in a great while brew, dont drink it everyday"
"Overall a very decent brew the only reason i bought it was for the novelty of it you gotta try it once with the expectations of it being an average brew that has a banana flavor"
"Cheers!"
"It's an okay ale, but doesn't quite hold its own. If you're looking for a banana bread beer find a decent dunkel weiss and skip the added and artificial flavours."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass little head, dissipates quickly. Very nice carmel color. The scent is primarily bananas, ripe. Very appealing. The taste is somewhat mild and a bit of a disappointment. It could almost pass as weak cream soda with a bit of banana. Not really bad, an interesting beer to try. Probably a one time thing."
"D: I was not expecting too much from this beer, to be completely honest. However, I really enjoyed it. It did indeed taste like banana bread and was not cloying or overly artificial."
"Maybe this is better in England, if so, it did not travel well. I bet Wells can do better, and I will be excited to see them try."
"Drinkability: pretty darn drinkable. I think the novelty of the flavor and the bit of sweetness would start to wear pretty thin on me, though, after a couple of pints. This is a very middle-of-the-road beer; definitely worth trying but not something I'd want too often."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of ripe bananas. Taste is also dominated by bananas, some malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a unique and good quality brew."
"Drinkability: Although the flavor is not as potent as I would have hoped, the alcohol is surprisingly well-hidden. Taste's is fairly good, although weak, so overall the drinkability is pretty good."
"D: If there was like an ""imperial"" or ""extra"" version of this where it was thicker and more flavorful I think it would be better. Overall it doesn't really taste bad, but there is something missing. Try it one then move on."
"The mouth on this is crisp. Carbonation level is moderately high. Decent body. The banana isn't as forefront as I'd have thought, or really wanted. Faintly present in the aftertaste. Fresh breads take its place. A slight mineral twang on the back end as well. Faint English hop bite. All-in-all, this wasn't too bad. Not all that I expected, but still decent. I even finished off the last half of the bottle paired with some actual banana bread. Why not? I like the pairing. I could see this becoming a decent dessert beer, maybe with some pie."
"The flavor profile of the banana-y-ness, yes that is a technical term, was spot on. In the end though the beer itself didn't hold up for me."
"list."
"Drinkability is poor. Not much to like about this strange brew. Lacks richness one would expect to see from anything with bananas in it and it's lack of body and octane left me with no reason to every open another one."
"The beer is a bit of a novelty, but it's not bad."
"Was very excited when I saw this in the shop and thought I should buy immediately. Apart from the smell it's been a big disappointment."
"D: this beer drinks exceptionally good for a fruit beer and is not too sweet. I really use to drink this brew on a daily as a session beer years ago beer I became a beer advocate and I can tell how my palate has evolved because this beer was the shit to me."
"D- More of a novelty than any kind of staple beer, for sure, but it is surprising how easily taken back this one is. I could definitely do two in a row before being compelled to move on."
"Drinkability - It is a unique brew, but definetly a good ""drinker."" Worth a shot."
"D-An average beer at least for the curiosity factor, but really nothing more than that."
"Who doesn't like banana bread? This beer is exactly what the label says. I must say it was quite enjoyable. I was expecting to taste like odd fake banana flavor but it was very tasty. If you like banana bread you should try this beer. It would be nice to a few of these around for desert."
"I was disappointed in this beer, expected it to have a sweeter banana flavor. Pours an amber-golden color, not much head to it. Noticeable carbonation. The aroma was nice, you can definitely smell the banana. The taste threw me off, mostly a lager but slightly more bitter. Had a slight banana taste in the background, but I actually would have liked more. I barely finished the whole thing, wouldn't buy it again unless it was much cheaper."
"D - Well, I don't really know. I mean, I guess if you're a HUGE fan of banana bread, then this might be the one for you. I am a huge fan ofbanana bread and I still didn't find this the most appetizing of beers. Pretty much a banana flavored lager."
"Overall I would recommend this simply because it was interesting. I don't think I could drink this everyday or once a week, but I could see myself getting this once a year during winter. I would suggest having this as an after dinner beer or with dessert."
"Not too bad. I'd have it again, but I'm not going to go out of my way."
"Pours a clear, golden/amber color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, yeast, banana, hops, and slight vanilla. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness noticeable. Tastes of strong banana (just like banana flavored smarties), pale malt, yeast, slight grain, and slight spice (clove). Overall, good aroma and body."
"Poured a dark golden color into tulip glass. The smell of banana bread enters the nostrils. The taste of banana is definitely on the palate. Average mouthfeel. Light backend. Nothing overwhelming. Decent drinkability with a banana bread flavor. Overall, a decent beer with a banana taste."
"D= 3 glasses down the drain should tell you something."
"Lives up to the name. Smells more like banana than it tastes, but the flavor is present. A yeasty, bready flavor follows the initial banana taste. Not much more to this beer, a tad stale on the finish, but a good fruit beer and unique to say the least."
"D- This beer is highly drinkable because it leaves such a pleasant after taste that always calls you back for more. Overall, it is nothing earth-shattering but is a very enjoyable, and different, beer to try"
"D - Very drinkable for what it is. I remember having this a while back and it being much better; more full banana bread flavor."
"D: This was just as expected. Clean and drinkable and quite unique. It's not something I would crave often, but it was nice to try once."
"Overall, glad I picked this one off the shelf. I had seen it several times but never took the plunge because it was a bit on the expensive side. Probably wouldn't pick it up again unless it was on sale, or I had a super craving for banana bread, but I don't feel that my money was wasted. A unique beer, to say the least."
"Not a very drinkable beer...unless you've had nothing to eat all day and want to get drunk on several of these. Otherwise, I would never want more than one of this dessert-like beer."
"For what they were trying to go for I think they did a good job, but what they were going for may not be the best thing ever. The color wasn't very attractive, it is an ugly dull brownish, orange-ish mess. The aroma is a lot stronger than I was hoping for, I wasn't expecting it to smell exactly like banana bread, but it does. Just on the nose there was very little else. The initial taste is a banana attack and a very strong attack at that. The mid palate taste and even feels a bit like butterscotch which is I think saves it from being too overwhelming. The finish is a little watered down which was actually quite pleasant. I definitely think that this isn't a beer you can drink often but was exciting anyway and could probably be had with some food."
"Notes: While I can't see this being for everyone, I love banana bread and love oddly/full flavored beers... so I love this."
"D- I wasn't sure what to expect from this even after reading the reviews. The smell was great and really got my hopes up, but I was disappointed with how weak the flavor was. Worth trying once, but amp up the flavor a bit and I might be more interested in drinking it again."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, could probably do more than one."
"D- Not a big fan of very strong fruit tastes however this one did not turn me off as I expected."
"A beer that doesn't quite live up to the deliciousness of it's name, but pleasant and well crafted."
"I am a huge fan of banana beers and this one rocked my world. I had first discovered the world of banana beer through a much more subtle beer called El Jefe Weizen Ale of Hale's Ales. I recently went to my co-op and couldn't find El Jefe so I tried this beer and I now prefer it."
"D- A very easy to drink beer, but I think one is plenty. Not that I didn't like the beer, just the banana flavor would get old quickly."
"Overall this beer is very drinkable and worth the wait. I knew once I opened the bottle that it would be a good one and I would definitely buy again."
"Copper colored with an off-white head that quickly settles to a thin lace. Smells of bananas (gosh!) and a slight mineral smell. Tastes of bananas, bubbblegum, and a slightly bitter hops bite and a touch of calcium. The aftertaste has a touch of cinnamon as well. Mouthfeel is soft, with a touch of carbonation. Very drinkable. Good balance of the sweet with the hops elements. I like it :)"
"Drinkability: While this did capture the flavor of banana it was the taste of artificial sweetner mixed with banana. I went into it with an open-mind, many beers have banana undertones. Too much. Not my cup of tea. I would not buy this again."
"Drinkability: Was an interesting change of pace. I would compare this to a fruity lambic or belgian style. Nice and sweet with some spice and obvious banana flavor. Could easily session a few of these. Although, I like fruity beers, others might not."
"Maybe it's because my tastes / memories are being distorted here, but the best way I can describe this beer is that it's Southern Tier's Pumking infused with bananas."
"I had this beer a number of years ago and since Well's have merged with Young's there are notable differences. First, the banana taste is not as long as it originally was and the beer is predominently more carbonated these days and if I am honest I would say it is too carbonated. Having said all this, it is still a good drinking session beer, I just wish it was still like it was when it was first brewed."
"Overall drinkability isn't bad if you like fruity tasting beer I guess. I did like it, but wasn't overly impressed."
"D= Pretty decent brew. Definitally unique but not something I would go for all the time. I may get some more however just because I really like banana bread. Everyone should have this beer once."
"This beer was a little too sweet for me, I love banana bread but not in my beer. sorry this is a one time experience for me."
"From the bottle. Pours amber/copper with a small white head. The head slowly fades and is almost gone within five minutes leaving very little but mainly no lacing. The smell of this beer is exactly what I was expecting and then some. Bananas and banana bread, pretty spot on. Other noticeable aromas are spices. The taste isn't as impressive as the smell but in all honesty it's not blowing me away but I do get a good hint of liquid banana bread. The banana dominates first and is present through out the taste, it's followed by certain malt taste mainly caramel towards the end. A low ABV this isn't a problem drinking. This one is good and pretty much was advertised. Banana bread for sure but at least it's not overpowering in the taste and you can tell it's a beer. I'd drink it again for sure but probably not that often."
"D- Let's just say I won't be coming back to this !."
"Taste - Sweet malts with banana with a slightly unbalanced bitterness. There was a slight astringent taste mid-flavor that wasn't helping this beer's case. Kind of good and different but not amazingly so."
"D: An interesting ale. Banana as a sole ingredient (and not a yeast by-product)? Paint me surprised."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. It is very much like liquid banana bread, and very interesting. Its not amazing, but it is enjoybale on occasion"
"I poured from a 16 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a clear amber with a moderate white head. The aroma is spot on, big banana and nut notes. The flavor is reminiscent of Banana bread, but not quite. The banana is there, as is the sweetness. The finish is slightly bitter, but not bad. The beer is a bit thin, and lightly carbonated. A nice change of pace beer that I enjoy on occasion."
"Poured from a 11.2 fl.oz bottle, purchased at a six pack shop in Erie, PA. into a snifter. Color is a caramel kissed with amber. The head is limited to a thin lining on the outer edge of the glass. Steady carbonation. The scent is light but sweet with banana and sugar. The mouth feel is heavily carbonated, with powerful yeast. The pleasure of the banana bread is loaded in the after taste. My first taste is almost tinny...which returns later after about a dozen sips. This is the first beer I have tried that attempts a banana bread flavor, but I have to say that the attempt is well executed. However, even if you are a fan of banana bread, stick with a six pack and steer away from the dedication to a full case. Something tells me that between the yeast and the tinny flavor, this beer would not hold up well over time."
"Holy Banana Batman! This beer is crazy. The initial sweetness of the beer mellows out with a fine brown malt finish. This really does taste like banana bread. Its pretty crazy. I honestly thought this was going to be a disaster of a bottle, but I was wrong. This is a very good, balanced, and tasty beer. Cheers to el Nadador for finding this sexy beast."
"A thin and slightly watery feel; moderate carbonation. Overall an interesting and rather unique fruit beer. The banana pairs well with the maltiness, especially in the aroma. The flavor and mouthfeel fell a bit short though, being thin and underwhelming."
"pours a clear medium amber in color with a quarter inch frothy head and a light lace. smells of banana and banana bread. taste is sweet more candy like than like banana bread flavor is right on. mouthfeel and carbonation ok. wife gave me two bottles to try its not something i would have bought thats the only reason its being reviewed."
"Overall, an interesting experience probably worth trying if one is available."
"Tasted from bottle. Pours a light amber, almost golden color with a white head that quickly dissipates. There are aromas of lightly toasted malts and (you guessed it) banana. There is also a little bit of a sour aroma. The slightly bitter bit hits up front and then quickly disappears. The banana flavor is strong, but doesn't really taste like real banana. Something about this beer reminds me of circus peanuts candy for some reason. The finish is a bitter that I would not normally dislike, but it doesn't match with the other flavors very well. The carbonation is very lively. This beer is interesting, but I would not describe it as good."
"Mouth/Drink: The mouth is a bit thin, but smooth and nicely carbonated. I could only seeing myself drinking a couple of these due to real banana bread taste."
"Well, the brew poured (into a Brooklyn Brewery Tulip) a beautiful amber with a nice one finger width head that remained for quite some time. The smell is decent for this brew, however it seems too artificial for my taste. The initial taste is that of some bananas, malt and surprisingly, hops. Can't say that I was expecting the hops, I wasn't to thrilled by the way it meshed with the banana flavor. In general, I think this beer is a novelty, however they still need to refine the recipe."
"Good beer, bought on a whim. Would probably buy again."
"I find the beer to be enjoyable, but as it's ABV may suggest, I don't find it to be a good session beer, but rather a nice pairing with a dessert or possibly a fruit gazpacho or fresh fruit salad."
"The mouthfeel is good but not great. It's thin and slightly watery despite having creamy flavors. I also dislike the lack of carbonation and hop bitterness but I bet they would mute the banana flavors. To sum up I was psyched starting out with this beer. Who doesn't want a glass of liquid bread especially a yummy banana bread but after about half a glass I'm bored with the novelty of it. This beer loses me for the same reason it originally captivated me. I'll stick to eating my banana bread from now on but I've been thrilled trying this honest and tasty brew."
"Really overall a good idea just not what I expected. Wonderful smell nutty and banana...but its not sweet and its very light. I think I will take a crack at some thing like this in my home brewing adventures more nuts more banana more sweetness and more alcohol... :)"
"D- more of a novelty beer than something i would want again and again. if you like banana, check this one out. if you dont stay away."
"Drinkability: Good beer overall, I definitely dig the banana flavors. Definitely would have this one again."
"Drinkability: It's more of a novelty than anything. Fairly sessionable."
"Notes: Seems more like a banana bar than banana bread due to the sugary sweetness. Not a bad beer for a gimmicky type of beer, and pretty good if you are in the mood for it. I like the idea, but would have liked a bit more bread and a bit less sugar. Banana flavor isn't intense and it taste generally like a banana, with just a slight artificial taste (artificial taste seems to follow the taste of a real banana just a bit stronger and sweeter)."
"Drinkability: This is a hard one. The flavour does not lend itself to a session drink, but I'm thinking that pairing with a good banana and chocolate dessert a few bottles could go down very well."
"D - It's a good thing I didn't pick up a case because I really don't seem to like it. Good novelty beer though!"
"D: If it was not so pricey would have one every day as desert,did I say yet Mmmm."
"D - Very drinkable. If it wasn't expensive it would be a good standard to have a stock of just for something to drink."
"Overall, this is a good brew. It's the only banana beer I've had and the banana flavor goes surprisingly well with the pale ale base. I wouldn't go out of my way to find it, but if you run across it, definitely give it a try."
"Overall, it's pretty good for a banana beer. I wouldn't know what more to ask for."
"Deep golden body. Bordering on copper. Very clear. Thin off white head. Sporadic lace. Smells like a banana flavored popsicle. Oh, I used to really like those. Flavor has ""imitation"" written all over it. Very artificial tasting. Confectionary like. Banana extract comes to mind. Looks like they used real bananas, but it tastes like imitation. Not a lot of other beer traits to talk about. Maybe a little caramel malt. To me, this is not that good. I've only had one other banana bread beer and it was much better (Town Hall)."
"Far too sweet for me and rather unbalanced, and I have a hard time imagining something that would go well with it."
"while the banana bread part was pulled off exceptionally well, this remains a novelty been for me. kind of circus like in that it is enjoyable, but only every couple of years."
"I recommend drinking this beer along with food. You need something to take the bitter aftertaste out of your mouth quickly and to complement the bananas. I ate candied walnuts, and they improved the beer a lot."
"Flavor is like your average crisp carbonated ale, followed by a long lasting banana aftertaste. Banana flavor is overall light, which surprised me. I was expecting heavy banana sweetness...but alas, not at all. Once again, pretty mild...light mouthfeel. Not overly sweet. Not bad."
"D: Low. I'm not sure banana is actually soluble in water, so artificial flavoring seems likely, although the label indicates that ""Fairtrade Bananas"" were used. Right. A handful of bananas and a gallon of banana flavoring."
"Value: The worst thing about this beer. I paid $4.99 for a bottle. Should be priced at half that."
"The lightness extends to the alcohol, which can hardly be felt here. Polishing off one of these wouldn't be that hard to accomplish in terms of how strong it is but it takes too long for the European-like hops in the back to kick in. Worth a try once only because I have yet to find anything out there remotely close to this!"
"Incredible aroma, but stops there and goes downhill quickly as it doesn't quite have the taste and body to back it up."
"Definitely cannot drink more than one in a sitting."
"M, D- Too light on structure and too heavy on CO2. Perhaps a passable hot-weather thirst quencher, but not suitable for serious ale drinking. Nothing very objectionable, but nothing inspiring either."
"D: its good but, would only be willing to drink one of theses. It would pair well with some foods and is unique, a good change of pace."
"In short this beer is entirely hampered by what it purports to be - Banana bread beer!"
"d: i would drink it asgai many times, i would session it; and it would be a good beer to give to that annoying female friend you have who"
"wouldnt necessarily buy it again but its better than some beer!"
"D: Pretty nice as an apertif or dessert brew, as well as pairing fantastically with banana bread, spice cake or banana nut muffin."
"As far as Wells entry goes, it's a thumbs down for me, which is too bad because the idea is a good one and I do like banana bread. Maybe the beer is poorly executed, maybe I got a bad bottle, maybe my taste buds don't know sh*t, or maybe a banana bread beer is just not meant to be. After all, I like pizza too, but a pepperoni and sausage ale would surely fail from the start."
"It's certainly worth trying, and it's not bad at all. Still, I'd rather have a slice of banana bread (preferably with some cream cheese on top) and a beer on the side (preferably not at the same time, but who knows). If you like banana bread, then definitely try it out. But I wouldn't get more than a bottle."
"D - despite low ABV this would be tough to finish >1 due to crazy and not terribly attractive flavors"
"D= I like it but not one of my favorite beers."
"feels a little under carbonated and not as full as a beer whose claim is bananna BREAD."
"I'll keep this one short and to the point. Cloudy yellow golden body with a big bubbled ivory head. The smell is mostly overripe banana, sugar, and a toasty malt character as well. The taste is the opposite of robust, muted, over carbonated banana soda with a shot of booze in the back. Lacking overall and very average if not below."
"D. Went down very easily due to the sweetness and low alcohol, which was completely hidden in the fruitiness. I was not impressed with the beer but easily finished it with no hesitation."
"If you need a potassium fix while drinking, I haven't found the content, but this may be the thing for you. Very good!"
"Drinkability> Sure!"
"Drinkability - Very smooth with a clean finish. It was a very interesting beer and definitely something different. I would definitely buy another bottle"
"Banana. Period. Has a distinctive banana smell on the pour, but not overpowering (you actually have to put your nose to the glass, not like you can smell it from a foot away or anything). Has a distinctive banana taste and finish that is pleasant. It's not overpowering banana. This is one of the few specialty beers that I could have a few of at one sitting, but it is a little thin."
"Drinkability average-minus. Overall, nice novelty, but not so great on the execution."
"Drinkability: Here comes the problem. It's an absolutely gimmick beer much like Pumking is. Yes it succeeds in tasting like banana bread but after a while it gets to be too much and I love banana bread. This is a one time kind of beer that I don't think I'd have again, but it is worth a try."
"It was pretty drinkable but I can't imagine making a day of it."
"Overall I'm glad I was able to try this one. Maybe not a everyday drinker but very unique."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium and smooth. Drinkability is fine, after all its a fruit beer. Just that damn aftertaste..."
"16.9oz bottle. Pours a golden amber color with a white head. The aroma features a good amount of banana. The taste has a little bit less banana flavor but it is still evident. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew tha is definitely worth a try."
"Surprise this is smooth with a hell of a bannana after taste. Could not shake the bannana taste from my mouth. Would never have more than one of these."
"Tasty, drinkable - but truly a novelty beer, not something to go back to multiple times over."
"Drinkability- very nice, I would and will definitely drink this again."
"Surpisingly hop forward with a some nice floral characetr. The flavor is again dominated by a sugary sweet banana flavor. Slightly bready medium body which is pretty crisp and clean with some biscuit nutty malt. Kind of a silly gimmick but actually succeeds in tasting like banana bread."
"i tried this beer at a winterfestival this past weekend and was blown away by the overall pleasant drinking experience it gave me. we all knew it would smell great and look ok but tatse... wow! its great. its not syrupy or overwhelming like banana first ale second. no no. this one is done correctly. ale first banana second. i think after a nice bitterly smooth ale kick the banana fades into the back of ur tastebuds. perfect. my suggestion... try with youngs dbl choc stout. u guessed it. banana split. enjoy to all"
"For something different try this! I will again."
"Oh my god, wow! This is so delicious. You think you don't like fruit flavored beers? Don't be lame. You like banana bread, right? This tastes like banana bread. It also smells like banana bread. How can that possibly be bad? Not only that, but the underlying ale is good, too. But this banana taste is just brilliant."
"Overall The novelty of it is by far the most appealing aspect (that and the smell)"
"poured an amber color with an ok head a little lacing the smell is bananas right away a little spice some cinnamon and nutmeg..the taste is banana bread all the way with some cinnamon and caramrl malt in the background i also detect some apples and pears the mouthfeel is to much banana it overwhelms this beer its all im tasting..however it is one to try its just not one to have to often"
"D--SHARED IT WITH MY WIFE, SHE SAID SHE WOULD DRINK IT ALL NIGHT, I ONTHE OTHER HAND WOULD BE COOL AFTER THE FIRST AND THEN SWITCH IT UP"
"Notes - This one is worth trying. It's different and a good unique flavor experience."
"I scroe this a 4.0 on drinkability for a fruit brew. It reminded me of an banana laced cider, not overly sweet or too fruit intense. Good for one, maybe mix half with a Stout for a twist, but count me out on a second round. Good for something different. Try a slash in a stout sometime, it may surprise you."
"I was excited to try this beer as who doesn't love Banana Bread. Not surprisingly there was slight aroma's of Banana and caramel. The hops leave a slight bitter aftertaste that affects how many I would want to have in a sitting. I don't mind slightly bitter beers but in my opinion a ""Banana Bread"" expierence should have a slight sweetness to it. I would recomend this brew I just wouldn't go out of my way to find it after already trying it. Cheers!"
"There is a bit more banana nut bread balance to the beer upon tasting. The banana flavor is a bit more natural and the nutty malts show up a bit along with a toastily bittering finish that seems to be helped along by a touch of leafy hops. I cant help but think this beer is a bit thin. This seems to be a style that screams for a viscous, creamy mouthfeel with a tad more sweetness. It's an interesting beer and worth trying for sure, but the novelty wears off pretty quick."
" Overall, nicely balanced and interesting-Would make a fine dessert beer. I was a bit skeptical at first, but pleasantly surprised. Not a bad beer to try for an interesting and different taste experience."
"Drinkability: This is the most banana I have had in a non-hefe. I like the fruit flavor on top of the dry beer. It is a nice change from fruit beer that can taste too much like syrup. I would have this again, but two is the most I will have in a sitting. I do not get the advertised bread taste and certainly no nutty taste either which I am used to on banana bread."
"Not much head on the unique bottle pour, this intrigued me and I was expecting a Belgien type but this was more of an ale with banana flavoring. Very unique and good, big banana aroma with an acidic mouthfeel and banana notes. This is a beer to have one of, but not a session beer. Good though if you are into that flavor profile. If this were served at the EBF folks would rave about it I think...it is extreme."
"This kind of tastes like banana bread at first, but then it doesn't taste like banana bread, it has this weird bitter flavor that reminds me of beer. After the weird beer flavor it starts to taste like banana bread again, but then the beer flavor COMBINES with the banana bread flavor and it tastes like someone made banana bread with beer instead of water, which is just a stupid idea. If you're going to make banana bread, do it right and leave the beer out of it. I don't know why you love this stuff so much nickd717, and I'm never trusting your opinion on banana bread again."
"i LOVE banana bread, so i really enjoyed the taste. definitely something unique to me. i'd definitely get this brew again."
"Despite my reservations, I'm fairly happy with it - it has a great opening, there are pleasant surprises, but you'd better down it while it's still got its legs. You'd better drink it cold, on a really hot day. It's certainly worth trying, if only for the novelty value. Will I buy it again? Probably not, but I'll have one if you're buying."
"Drinkability is high but that doesn't count for much with me these days. Just because I can drink 12 of them doesn't mean I want to. I'll pass next time I see this one."
"Not my style but It is a treat."
"Overall okay as a novelty but that's about it. Might work out paired in small portions with fried bananas but otherwise I can't imagine buying this again."
"O - Worth a try but not an outstanding discovery. I'd probably drink it again happily if it was an option in a slim pickings shop!"
"Overall: Overall a nice beer but not overly impressive. I do however highly recommended trying this beer."
"Very interesting beer, but I think it would have worked better with something like a wheat beer."
"I'm sorry Wells Banana Bread Beer, I wanted it to work. It's not you, it's me. We could still be friends..."
"Crystal clear and bright copper color with plenty of carbonation. Big creamy head that settles rather quickly. Yeasty and bready homebrew smell with fading cooked banana notes. Taste very frontloaded with lots of overripe banana sweetness and malty sweetness underneath. Flavor fades quickly leaving little but faint and tangy fruit flavors on the front of the tongue. Little to no hop characteristics. Body is medium to light, feeling very thin and fizzy in the mouth. No lacing."
"Taste is as the nose. The bana taste is unique though. It tastes much like fake banana. Both the banana aroma and taste remind me so much of the banana Runts. An amber with fake banana. Not something I'd buy again I suppose."
"Purchased from Otto's Wine Cask in Brown Deer, WI. Pours a dark golden body with a white head of foam that falls. Aromas of bold, fruity esters and big banana smell too. Medium bodied with good carbonation and a nice malt flavor to compliment the banana flavors. This is pretty good at first, but the novelty wears off about half way through. Too much banana flavor leaves me wanting to switch to a beer that tastes like a beer."
"D: I'm kind of confused - is this a candy-shot or is this beer? I won't buy it again, but it was an interesting experience never the less."
"D- Drinkable. I could probably enjoy 2 bottles in a sitting before the overwhelming maltiness got to me."
"Overall, I like the idea here, but not the follow-through. It needs waaay more malt flavor and more spices to justify its name. This is not a banana BREAD beer. It's a banana flavored lager."
"D: not sure about a young example, but this goes down super easy right now.. refreshing, clean, good banana but not overdone. pleasantly surprised."
"an interesting beer, and one that's good as a crossover beer. not one i would typically buy, but it was fun."
"Wells Banana Bread Beer, how can you walk past a beer with that kind of name in the store. I've been eyeing it for a while, even though I usually think that fruit beers are a terrible idea. I had to try this one. I never say I regret drinking a beer, and I don't regret drinking this beer but it is close to the worst beer I have ever had. I found myself debating whether it was an ale or a lager half way through. The beer is clear and light yellow. Nearly flat, so no carbonation at all. No head. Overwhelming smell of bananas, but not the fruit bananas, think banana runts. Surprisingly, it did not taste a lot like bananas (although each time I burped they tasted like bananas). Mouthfeel was weak and thin. The aftertaste of the beer was stronger than the taste. The aftertaste was that of a poorly made Kolsch. On the bottle, they wrote:""Long ago, ale was known as 'liquid bread'. We've used our long history of creating the finest malt blends and added fairtrade bananas to awaken the senses with a seriously fruity, rich, yet surprisingly versatile banana bread beer."" Lies, all lies. Don't bother with this beer. It was close to undrinkable."
"-Oelergud"
"anyone who has to witness every use of the banana firsthand. I won't be having another one soon."
"Collaboratively evaluated by twaddlac and Jae27"
"Collaboratively evaluated by twaddlac and Jae27"
"Taste like it smells--like a very tame, pasteurized ESB and banana Laffy Taffy. A nice blend. While it's not the most traditionally beer-flavored, I'm willing to forgive its cutesiness since it was born of necessity."
"Pours a copper color with a one finger head. The smell is of straight bananas....b..a..n...a....n...a...s. It is probably one of the most over powering banana smells i have been around. The taste is what you would expect and that is bananas. There is really no malt or bread notes to balance out the flavor. The mouthfeel is good there is not a lot of carbonation. To drink alot of these you would have to really want it. In small does this would be a good beer however, you couldn't take in big doses."
"Taste: Sweet and smooth upfront. Spicy hops and moderate bitterness in the middle. Crisp finish and a little banana aftertaste to round out the experience. I wish it had a bigger banana taste. That is the whole gimmick afterall. Might as well have taken it to the extreme."
"Pours a deep copper with a one finger head that laced very well. Reeks of candy bananas, but I guess that was to be expected. There do seem to be some hop aroma and a touch of malt at the back but it's all about the bananas. A little awkward on the palate. Starts off sweet and bananary but has some malt beer body bringing up the rear throwing it off. Then those banana lolly notes hang around for a while. Probably would've been better as a sweet banana beer, light in body in the vein of some fruit lambics. Not horrible but once is more than enough for me. Kind of tastes like ""what was the point?"""
"The banana really dominates this beer. It has rather a dairy flavour to it, reminding me of Angel Delight. There is a slight bitterness to the finish but that isn't uncommon with banana generally. I'm very picky about bananas yet find this surprisingly decent."
"D - Again a very underwhelming fruit beer, I wish brewers would incorporate fruit into the beer better, instead being a fruit centered ""beer"""
"drinkability: overall it is what it is, but its not good. Plenty of other better fruity options for beer out there."
"D: This is not a good beer, but still not as horrible as I had suspected. Don't know if a banana infused English ale is a good idea what so ever, so I think this one was doomed to fail no matter what it tasted like. Can't say I would recommend it."
"The brewery's got better offerings than this. My inner child caused me to reach for it on a whim, but I don't think I'd buy it again except a single bottle for a tasting meant to show people the interesting things you can do with beer. Taking out the ""metal"" taste would help, but there needs to be a better layering of flavors here."
"D-very strong on the fruit end, but not the bread end. I would like to have had a bit more balance."
"Solid atmosphere. Really nice appearance, and nose is definitely banana, but not overwhelming as to drown out what's left. Subtle, balanced flavor. . . again, not all banana. Good feel. Although not something, I'd want to drink everyday; overall, pretty solid quaff."
"Drinkability: I'm hoping my wife likes this more than me. Reminds me of banana bread, but in an artificial sense. Decent drinkability, not bad for a desert beer or possibly a pairing with actual banana bread. Probably won't reach for one to relax with on a warm summer night, however."
"the beer is interesting and actually more drinkable than I expected it to be. I enjoy this but probably wouldnt drink more than one at a time. Worth the experience IMO. Give it a shot."
"Pours a clear amber color with a quickly diminishing fizzy white head, a little bit of lacing. Aroma is sweet, ripe bananas (obviously but not overpowering), bread malts, with a twinge of bitterness providing a decent balance. Flavor is very similar, bananas, maybe a touch of caramel malt and a slight hop bite at the end. Mouthfeel is dry, carbonated, light, and the astringency sticks around for a while. Not necessarily my cup of tea, but a decent and drinkable beer. Fairly well balanced considering the use of banana."
"Don't know if I'd drink it again.. . I might, but I doubt it. Intersting taste, not at all bad, but not something I'd seek out and drink regularly (or even occassionally). I just prefer other styles, no fault of the brew."
"ruby colored. white head, with little retention, and little lacing. smell is all banana bread. it's like having a piece of it tucked into the glass. some maltiness tucked in there with the banana aroma. taste is more banana, but not balanced. taste is a real downer from the smell. too many things going on, too many flavors. kind of tannic like throughout. finish is quite dry. this beer would be better suited to cooking than drinking."
"Dr. Certainly. Now if there was only a way to get some walnuts in there..."
"I like beer and I like banana bread. So I figured this beer would be a home run. However I bought this with some trepidation because fruit beers can get too overpowered by the fruit. Poured into a pint glass and as the head struggled to form on top so did my expectations. The aroma was just what it should be...Bananas. Not much hops or malt aromas if any. Surprisingly the taste was good. No lacing from the lackluster head but bananas was obvious. Overall I enjoyed this beer, it wasn't a home home run, maybe a stand up triple."
"i had very low expectations for this beer but i was plesantly surprised. i have tried other ""fruit"" beers before and this one is in a league of its own. as the name states... this beer does not just smell like banana, but it smells EXACTLY like banana BREAD. the banana taste was not overpowering. beautiful color and good appearance (head disapated quickly). i could drink a bunch of these and i will definatly buy this beer again!!!"
"This was a beer that upon my first sighting it in my local beer joint, I promptly scratched my head and said ""What the...?"" It was quite an interesting concept and a pleasure to try. My two main gripes: 1.) A heavier mouthfeel seemed more appropriate to me. 2.) TOO MUCH banana. It has a good base, but some more balance would have been nice. Still, the novelty alone makes this worth trying."
"Drinkable? I didn't even manage to drink half of the bottle."
"Not entirely novelty, but not a beer you'd designate as an every day go-to beer either. I'd wanted to try this for some time, as the idea seemed too good to be true. While this is no grand slam, it does well enough--but I'll bet Dogfish Head could really do something amazing with this concept. I thank BDLBrewster for the opportunity to try a bottle. Cheers, Matt!"
"Poured from a brown glass bottle into a pint glass... pours a clear golden color with a white head. Lots of carbonation. There's a nice smell dominated by banana. The taste is plenty of banana, but not much else... a slight bitter aftertaste. I like the idea of a banana infused beer, but this one just doesn't really live up to potential."
"This beer pours a light orange with an ivory colored head. Foam shrinks down to a thick film, good retention. Smell is amazingly like banana bread. The banana smells realistic, not overly sweet fake flavoring. Also some toasted bready malt. Taste has lots of banana as well. Again, naturally tasting. There is some solid caramel malt that keeps it from getting to sweet. A bit of spice finish, cinnamon maybe. No real hop bitterness, but don't miss it anyways. I would say medium-body, good mouthfeel. Drinkability? Original and unique for sure, exactly as advertised. Definately worth a try, but wouldn't want to drink more than one at a time."
"D - This is an extremely drinkable beer for what it's worth."
"Below average drinkability for my tastes. Somewhat high ABV of 5.2 + artificial tastes = what's the point?"
"Well, I'll be! I'm really quite surprised how spot on this beverage nailed the experience of biting into banana nut bread. Except it's not overflowing with flavor and strangely dry - which counters the desired moistness you'd want from the bread."
"Drinkability: Even though I thoroughly detest bananas and their wimp flavours in their original form, I decided to put that aside and review this one from a neutral stand point, thus the disappointment lies not in the choice of flavouring, but in the fact that it is all too weak and bland."
"Conclusion: A for effort, intent, and originality...the execution, not quite so great. It tastes like what it's supposed to, that's certain. This could be pretty damn good if the banana intensity was just ratcheted down a touch and if that odd, bitter, somewhat metallic bite wasn't there on the finish. Still, worth a try, at least once."
"Smells like a banana, but the banana taste is not too strong. The taste is creamy with banana, but not over powered by the banana. The beer had a foamy head with large soapy type bubbles. It is a good change of pace, but not something you could drink all night."
"Finish is dry and crisp, a nice beer, definitely unique and enjoyable."
"I was interested in trying this fruit-based beer, knowing it was a gimmick of sorts. That being said, it is definitely not my favorite beer, and seeing as it only distributed in singles at $4.50 a pop, I cant say I'll go out of my way to get this beer, but then again, I wouldn't be opposed to having one bottle on hand since I enjoy Young's Double Chocolate and mixing the Banana Bread Beer for a black and tan is a decent concoction (though I think it is the YDC that makes the concoction delicious and not so much the Banana Bread Beer)"
"Damn, this smells so incredibly good (and I even have a bit of a cold!). I could seriously imagine just buying it again just to smell. I'm generally not a fan of fruit-style beers (though some can be great). One of my biggest issues was the carbonation. On cask or nitro this would be more fun, I'm sure. That said, I still think the flavor was rather lacking or missing something. Though, probably, the smell had made me hope that this would just be liquid banana bread or something. ;-) An interesting beer, worth giving a try, but a novelty nonetheless."
"damn....banana actually pretty weak not that i was wanting anything overpowerful but nothing is there to accent it well little bit of hops but thats about it. disappointed. my wife really wanted to try it too but almost spit out her taste. i finished the bottle but that will be the last."
"Really interesting beer. I'm glad I picked it up. It's not really my favorite, but I do love the banana flavor. This is a beer that I had been thinking about buying for a couple of months, but waited until a friend of mine gave it the seal of approval. Probably not for everyone, but you never know how much you'll like or dislike something until you try it."
"This is an interesting one to try. What excites me most about this beer is the prospect of food pairings. I think it would suit equally as a dessert beer or as a light, fresh foil to spicy dishes (curries, Mexican, etc)."
"Drinkability: Despite the mouthfeel, this beer is quite drinkable. Nothing offensive in the flavor, just not what I expected."
"Pours a clear light amber with a frothy but somewhat fizzy beige head. Nice pure banana oil aroma, similar to banana flavored candy. I also get some brown sugar and pumpkin pie spices. Flavor has some banana, but it's more pithy than sweet and there's not a lot of it in the first place. An earthy hoppiness and bready malts make up the bulk of the flavor, presumably because the base beer is an ESB. Mouthfeel is a little thin for a beer named after a rich and chewy confection. Carbonation is a little too high. Not bad."
"D Good but this gimmicky beer is much less sessionable than many others like it within its style."
"D - It's pretty drinkable, but not very interesting. Not one I'd buy again."
"If you want a banana flavored beer, try Ayinger Dopplebock."
"The taste is light byt flavourful, a definite but light banana element throughout with earthy leaves and tea, some tasted grain, esp. in the finish. It is dryish with light sweetness dominated by peppery bitterness that lingers around the mouth for a long time. it's light, crisp, a bit watery, but actually prwetty good and interesting."
"M + D: Kinda medium body... Sizzly carbonation like soda again... Fairly easy drinking but not all that great. Can't say I'm a fan, but the flavour isn't drainpour worthy."
"Nice idea, but I won't be having this again."
"Overall - A nice treat, but not a regular standby. If I'm feeling like something fruity, I might go for it."
"the beer is good and worth its price. only problem is that its a little bit too obvoius that it was flavored mostly with artificial banana flavoring. worth trying but i wont get it again. the labeling is impressive like most youngs bottles are. for a beer as light as it was it was not too carbony but it still tasted felt like gas and not natural carbonation.i payed 3.69 for mine but ive seen em as high as 5.99. bottom line though:its just a light beer with banana flavoring, nothing to special."
"Drinkability- Although this isn't what I'd hoped for, It remains a fairly well-balanced, and definitely refreshing beer."
"D - Medium drinkability, I guess if it were the only thing amongst buds and millers, I might go to it first, but won't search it out."
"M - Thin bodied, consistency of water with just a little more viscosity. Not entirely impressive on its own but goes well with the rest of the qualities of the beer."
"D- This particular beverage may have suffered from the hype I put on it, but i was not impressed and wont be buying another. I failed to find much by way of redeeming qualities."
"D = This is okay for a novelty, and I could see using it in a mixed drink or in cooking, but not really a beer that makes you want to drink much of it."
"Poured from bottle into Sam Smith pint glass. Appearance is clear medium orange color, not much head, lightly carbonated. Smells strongly of bananas. Taste has a little banana flavor, not as much as I expected from the smell, and the breadiness is there too. Light prickly carbonation. Finish is pretty crisp, some light earthy hoppiness. Medium-light bodied. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is a little watery with medium carbonation. When you serve this cold, it is actually a bit difficult to detect the banana presence. But as it warms, the banana definitely becomes much more pronounced. Just don't let it get too warm because it did get a little out of hand towards the end. This was worth a try and I can appreciate it as a specialty beer but I don't think I would be drinking too many of these. I don't know anybody who'd be buying a whole case of this but for a one time treat, this was an interesting thing to try."
"The color is a golden/orange/amber. There was a small head that quickly vanished. Decent banana aroma. Tastes somewhat like banana bread, but overall I found it to be pretty weak. There was a little too much carbonation for my liking. More than 1 pint of this beer would be too much. I guess it's worth trying for the novelty, but not as good as I expected it to be."
"Overall I thought this was quite tasty. Fruit beers can be dicey but I enjoyed the sweet and then bitter flavors of this one. Certainly worth a try if you are looking for a change of pace."
"Pours a golden brown color, fizzy, with a big white lasting foamy head. Very strong ripe banana aroma, a little hops, but mostly bananas. Banana malty taste, banana aftertaste. Bottled water taste. Not much else. Interesting, but this will be my last."
"Not to bad for a fruit beer, almost like a heavier and sweeter hefe. Such a specialized flavor I can't see drinking it often, but worth a try."
"i wanted this to be a lot bigger than it was. the label makes reference to beer as ""liquid bread," and posits that banana bread beer is then a logical conclusion. i'll buy that, but then why not take it further? i'd love to see a heartier, thicker, stronger version."
"D - An interesting concept and well executed... However, this is not a brew that I'd turn to on a regular basis... More of a novelty, but one that I'm happy I tried..."
"M&D: slightly fizzy on the texture, medium- to thin-bodied for a 5.2%abv. ale, and the filtered+pasteurised version is way less enjoyable as the cask-conditioned version. I guess, without a slightly richer and fresher body as the cask version demonstrated, the more artificial and thin side of this beer has simply woken up to rock the boat."
"Pours a rich whiskey color with little head. Automatically small the deliscious banana. Tastes very smooth with a great aftertaste. It is as you swallow that you realize why its banana bread not just banana. After reading some reviews I was worried it would be too sweet but it is just the right amount of sweetness. I would definetely recommend this beer for women or men who are not ashamed to admit they like sweet and fruity beers."
"d - would be very difficult to drink more than two in my opinion, found it a bit sickly and sticky after a while but overall not too bad, would definately try again"
"The beer is very unique, I will say that much. It was worth trying but I don't think I could drink more than one at a sitting."
"MM"
"d- Well its sweet and fairly tasty, but it has several boring characteristics. This all makes it an easily drinkable beer, but I feel there is no way to get around the issue of cost with this one. I love banana bread, but I am never going to drop $5 for a bottle of this stuff again. It's just not what something like this should cost, period. It was good for a try, but that's it."
"Overall - An interesting brew with a few too many off notes and a bit on the sickly sweet side... worth a try once..."
"D: Pretty drinkable and would definitely recommend."
"was drinkable but not something I'd make a point about or rush out and tell everyone to try"
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"This is a drinkable beer, but the prevalent banana may wear thin after a few of them."
"Pours a rich amber with a decent head that dissipates somewhat quickly, some lacing remains. Smell is nice...it actually smells like banana bread out of the oven, definite bread undertones suggest malt presence. Taste is good, banana presence is there, some maltiness, hop tartness on the finish..defintely not over the top. Moutheffel is light, smooth and has a nice slightly tart finish. Very easy to drink...probably a better brew in warm weather...but still ok in late December."
"Disappointing from what the expectations were based on the description on the bottle. The incredible smell is just a tease...the flavor is lacking. More of a soda than a beer..."
"Overall - This seemed like a failed attempt at making a holiday beer. Fake syrupy taste like the candy with the yellow bananas... I think they're called Runts. Not worth the money. Not worth a try."
"The drink is light-bodied with zesty carbonation and fluffy feel. Very surprisingly drinkable."
"Pours darker gold with a frothy white head. Aroma of...banana bread. Nuts, ripe bananas, and liquor in the nose and in the taste. KInd of grainy, and the banana taste seems a little sickeningly sweet towards the end. Overall, much better than I expected."
"Overall, I picked this one up as something different and fun to try. It wasn't by any means bad, but definitely not something I would introduce to the regular rotation. For the price ($4.99 for a 500 ml bottle), the value just isn't there."
"D - A nice novelty, and not a bad ale by any means, its just not all that great honestly. I could drink a few once in a while to switch it up a bit and surprise the palate."
"Drinkability: It's definitely a novelty. But I'm glad I got to try it! If you're oddly craving beer and bananas at the same time, I would recommend this!"
"Hmmm...an interesting concept that I can give them credit for trying. I'd rather just stick to having a slice of banana bread with a nice, robust porter, or milk stout."
"I poured this peculiar shaped bottle into a pint glass. The brew poured a nice amber brown color with a quickly dissipating head, leaving almost nothing except a trim of lace. The first smell, surprisingly, gave me a caramel malty nose with a hint of raisins and banana. Maybe its this damn cold. Then the second smell, after swirling it in my glass a bit. Whoa. This truly defines the expression 'hence the name.' A robust banana flavor enveloped my nose, and reminded my exactly that of banana bread. I'm happy to note that the powerful aroma of banana bread didn't influence the taste. Strong presence of bananas upon first sip, but not dominating the decently balanced caramel malty sweet bitterness. The mouthful gave me a light to medium body with a crisp fruity aftertaste. Refreshing as I quickly quaffed my glass. Overall, this would be a great brew to enjoy as an after dinner treat. A unique beverage, indeed. I would probably buy this again, and would be opposed to giving Wells Banana Bread Beer a good recommendation."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that I would never be able to drink more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. But on that note, I could see myself drinking it day after day. I think this would serve as more of a summer time beer, I just hope I will be able to find it come June and July."
"Picked this up to sample because my gf wants a banana beer, and this convinced me to make mine a hefeweizen."
"Future outlook: I bought this as a pseudo-novelty lark with essentially no expectations. It struck out, and I can't imagine going back for more of this."
"Light to medium in body with a very mild carbonation and the 5.2% ABV being virtually undetectable, this stuff goes down as easily as Gatorade. Overall a good beer and I don't even like banana bread."
"Poured a crystal clear orange amber with a thin off white head. The aroma is obviously of banana bread. Its incredibly sweet, almost smells like bubble gum. Tastes like bananas but has an odd metallic flavor. I would have expected more of a wheat and bread flavor to it. Feel is kinda thin. Not a great fruit beer."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head that stays at about a half inch.Aroma is banana.Taste is banana and biscuit.I was expecting this to be more sweeter but there is just a subtle hint of sweetness.This is definetly something worth trying.Something that should be tried at least once!!"
"The appearance is strange; a little like a soda (?!?!), it has an orange/ginger ale sort of color. Weak head, no lacing. Cool smell, bananas dominate, along with grainy malts. It smell faintly like a hefeweizen, but also like an English pale ale. The mouthfeel was surprisingly watery. The flavor was mainly caramelized malts, not much in the way of hops. the flavor was a bit weak. A little sting on the tongue is from the carbonation. The finish is gone from the palate in a flash. I'm glad I tried this, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"1st review. Saw this today, had to give it a shot. Pours with very little head or lacing. Smells faintly of banana, not overwhelming the smell but actually enhancing it. Has a nice smooth taste to it, malts up front, with a nice hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is real good. I could drink this all day, wish I had bought more. If you can find it, try it out."
"Served from a bottle, this pours a clear amber color, with a scant white head and a small amount of white lacing on the glass. the smell is slightly of vanilla and malt. The taste is of a typical English Pale Ale, with added banana and vanilla. That is to say, it is malty, with a flavor of bread and caramel, with a crisp hoppy background. The banana flavor doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the beer, but actually compliments it. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth. If you like bananas, this is an interesting variation of an English Pale Ale. Recommended!"
"16.9 ounce bottle, best before 3/31/2009. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear copper/amber color with a half inch white head that went away very quickly. Lacing is average. It smells like a combination of overripe bananas and banana nut bread. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma, but there's also a nice slightly hoppy bitter aftertaste that lingers around a while. It does taste mostly like banana nut bread. Mouthfeel/body is light, with average carbonation. Drinkability is OK, but I don't think I could drink more than a bottle of this at a time. But it is smooth and it's not hard to drink at all. If you like bananas then you should like this beer."
"I am quite surprised at how much I am enjoying this brew. It is a nice change from the highly malted/hopped craft beers i usually drink."
"Poured into a couple of pint glasses. This warm brown beer pours a good foam and keeps a good lacing. The smell that greats the nose is wonderful banana nut smell. The initial taste is that of a caramel coffee flavoring. It fades to a great tasting banana nut flavor making a great tasting beer."
"D: I wouldn't want more than a half of one, but my wife liked it!"
"Don't drink and review."
"D: Ok drinkability overall; a decent combination of mouthfeel and taste. Not too bad of a taste, but could have used a bit more malt presence."
"Crisp and light on th etoungue, the mildly bitter and dry brew clahses somwhat with the intense baked banana flavor and aroma. The banana becomes less intrusive as you drink, and the brew is fairly nice with food. A richer heavier ale might have conveyed this flavor more successfully."
"Pours a transparent light brown hue with white head that clings. Powerful banana bread aroma sifts through the air upon first pour, You might think you are back at Grandma's house for dessert and a few laughs. A light bodied beer that tastes of veggies and banana flavors to finish the drink, along with the stale banana aftertaste that accompanies the real fruit. There's slight carbonation, not too powerful, and drinkability is fine here due to its lightness. A good summer beer when getting bored with wheats and looking for something new."
"D: Seemingly artificial flavor of this brew would be hard to stomach in large doses."
"Drinkability is NO GO. Don't care for this bland mix of water and nothing."
"The banana is up front in the aroma and lingers in the pale aftertaste."
"D- a solid session bitter beneath it all. unlike most fruit beers for me, the banana doesn't seem to lose its appeal. instead of fruit with a beer back, it is more like beer with a light fruitiness making it a good choice for those not-so-into fruit beers. not to mention that banana is a common flavor associate anyway."
"poured a nice clear light brown color with very little head that disaperd quickley. this smelled like the kitchen while my mom bakes banana bread. this was sweet in the begining and malty at the end with a great banana flavor all the way through. this is a beer that i would love with sunday breakfast, eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, a cinniman rool, some oj and one of theese beers. the purfict start to football day!"
"Out a bomber this brew poured with a huge three finger tan head on top of a dark gold liquid. Decent retention and after a minute the cap grew rocky, moderate lacing. The aroma was at first a burst of bananas with caramel malt behind that, distinctly sweet. The flavors were odd. Well, it is to be said, they nailed the banana bread flavor. But that's what makes it weird. Kind of like KeKe key lime liquor. Bready malt, sweet malt, bananas and even a hint of nuts. Medium body and an ok mouthfeel but it could use some refining. An unique offering and if you like banana bread you cannot miss it but I cannot stress enough how unusual the flavor and bouquet are."
"Could drink one of these, once per year."
"I actually had this beer while eating a peanut butter sandwich, and the pairing was heavenly!"
"Wow. I loved this beer! Had read the reviews here and expected this to be something you'd have a few sips of and get sick of rather quickly, but not the case. I found the banana flavor to be there for sure, but melded quite well with the ale and not sweet. Just added a nice full, mellow taste and body that was very appealing. Mouthfeel was outstanding. OK, I wouldn't order a 2nd one, but I did fully enjoy the entire large bottle. Had it shipped to me here in the states by a sort of a beer pen-pal in the UK, I'm disappointed I probably won't have this again as you can't find it anywhere that I've seen."
"Bannana bread huh? Sure, why not. Expecting a novelty of a beer without any real meat or potatoes, I ended up with a well-brewed beer... with fruit. The base beer is a classy English Pale Ale with a biscuity, cracker-like maltiness (not so much bread), a crisp caramel flavor, light on esters, and crystal clean. Well attenuated and properly done. The bannana character does just what it should; it gives an extra flavor without overpowering. If anything the bannana notes remind me of the Gobstoppers bananna flavor- not exactly real, but not artificial either. The fruit character hits hardest in the nose, while residing a bit in the flavor and whispers away into the finish, allowing the true beer character to shine. Very nicely done. I will certainly revisit this beer, but it'll likely be one then moving on to something else."
"The name really describes the flavor. It definitely tastes like banana bread but the flavor is slightly too artifical for my tastes."
"This beer is alright if you like banana, but the beer underneath the banana could be better. The drinkability is better than this, but I have to take a little off somewhere."
"D- Drinks good, but too much banana for me."
"D: Eh it's something different but by no means a staple."
"500mL bottle purchased for $5 from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a clear medium gold, with lots of bubbles but little head. I just finished off the rest of my toddler's banana after putting him to bed. Will that make this judgment better or worse? It's a decent malt aroma, but sadly I'm not getting any banana. And this IS a banana beer, after all. After the first sip, I'm having trouble figuring out what banana tastes I have are coming from the beer vs the banana I just ate. Pretty sure that little burp right that was from the real banana. I suppose this means that I can make any beer a banana beer by eating a banana before it, and I won't have to pay $5 for the privilege! Subsequent tastes are getting better as the flavours become more distinguishable. Banana flavours - more direct and less subtle than a hefeweizen. I gave my wife a blind tasting, and she noted heavy banana flavours - perhaps because she doesn't much care for the fruit. A fun beer."
"Second time that I've had this brew because the first time, I wasn't sure where I stood.. Overall.... not bad. Not a session beer by any means but one that is truly good for dessert! Appearance is nothing unusual and the smell is just what you would expect, a glass of banana bread. Taste is the same, a loaf of liquid banana bread. Personally, I prefer mine solid. The mouthfeel is nice with nothing clouding the palate. The drinkability is average as I couldn't really drink more than half of the 19.25oz bottle that it came in. Worth a try but it's not on my ""must have"" list."
"worth checking out though."
"D: Easily drank the entire bottle writing this review!"
"Drinkability- Novelty beer that really wasn't half bad. Banana isn't too overpowering and not too sweet. Enjoyable, but not an every day beer."
"Caution: Keep away from monkeys. :D"
"D: I'm not sure how to rate this one overall. Its not really like a beer at all. But it is good... hmmm It kinda gets sweet after a bit so it might be hard to do this over and over again. maybe buy a bottle to split for something different. Good, but not really beer like..."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It smells like a English pale brewed with hefe yeast. The banana/clove aspect is in full swing. The taste is decent. It has a dry pale and bisquit malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with the hefe banana esters. I guess there is real bananas in here as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinker, but a bit of a concept beer. I like the results, but not enough to buy another."
"It was just borderline ok and not worthy of another purchase at 5 skins a bottle."
"the banana flavor is not as strong as it smells. it is nice and sweet, more subtle than expected. the sweetness kind of dances around the light ale flavors. intresting, but nothing spectacular. worth a try if you like the fruity sweeter styles."
"The aroma of ripe banana and bready malts fills your nose as you pour this beautiful golden amber brew. It forms a modest off white head with lots of little bubbles streaming up the sides of the glass. The flavor is full of over ripe bananas with nuty and sweet bready malts. It's light to medium bodied, well carbonated and it has a slick almost oily texture. An excellent brew."
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip pint glass. Minimal white head that dissipated quickly. Clear gold color with no visible carbonation. The smell was ridiculously strong candied banana similar to a banana Laffy Taffy. The taste was pure banana bread. Sweet and bready with hints of malt. Flavor similar to an exaggerated hefe wiesen with sweeter and more pronounced banana flavors. Delicious, sweet and creamy with a clean finish leaving behind copious amounts of banana sweetness. Overall a very good beer but too sweet to pound. My only issue is that I felt the banana flavors tasted artificial and overly sweet at times, but definitely a good beer and worth seeking out and trying if you get the chance."
"D- Ummm... does anyone like bananas? I think the house plant may... A little too fake-banana to finish the 3/4 bottle that was my share."
"D: I knew this was going to be bad and it was. I really hate banana. Damn it."
"MF&D - Medium/Thin bodied. Crisp and refreshing. I actually liked this beer, but I would have to say I due to the candy like sweetness, I probably would not drink more than 2 at a sitting."
"I love Banana Bread but I did not love this beer as much as I do the real thing of course but it was a good effort. It was ok though. Poured with a nice cream head that fades slowly leaving a trace of lace. Had a clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Strong banana nose. Starts as a malty/hop mix but then the banana flavor kicks in, a strange soapy banana aftertaste."
"It had a decent body, and was drinkable to say the least. As it warmed, the bitterness from the hops were more present, and the banana flavour more but left the scene. I couldn't drink more then one of these in a sitting."
"So overall, pretty light and fruity, balance will be helped by sitting, but in general an OK fruit beer."
"This is really a fascinating beer. Really a fantastic english bitter, with just the right amount of banana and malty bread qualities to give it, yes... a banana bread taste, but at the same time it's not overpowering or detracting. Honestly, it's just a really nice english bitter."
"P.S. This would be terrific in the Autumn, perhaps with a warm bit of fresh banana bread!"
"This beer poured a nice golden copper color with a thick egg shell colored head. Lacing was minimal but present. The smell was..surprise! Banana bread. Man that's wild. It really smells just like banana bread. Also had a nice breadiness in the smell. The taste was again bananas but not too much. Much less banana in the taste than in the nose which was good. Very crisp and clean beer. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall an incredible beer. Highly recommended."
"D: Very light and drinkable. Very good true banana flavor. The sweetness is a drawback to sessionability. Would pair well with lighter fare and desserts (mmm...Bananas Foster)."
"I liked this beer as a neat surprise. I could have drank one more but my personal tastes skew away from drinking more than one or two sweeter beers in a row. I would try this again or bring it to a get together just for the novelty of it."
"Verdict: An interesting gimmick that's drinkable. Nothing to phone home about though."
"As far as drinkability goes, it has it. There's enough to make it pretty interesting, but not so much that it would wear on you. I would go back to this one when desiring a good English ale with some fruitiness."
"Pours a transparent honey amber color, with a film of a head that seems to have a yellow tint to it. the smell is defiantly banana bread, a welcoming aroma. the taste is very very much banana peel, kind of tart on the finish and a bit sour all the way through, but i kind of like it, and it grows on you as you get through the first glass. mouth-feel starts off smooth, gets crisp in the middle, and the after taste leaves a tingle as well but no viscosity. drinks like water, no problem downer. all in all, an okay spring or early fall session brew (in my humble opinion)"
"Drinkability: It's alright, but it just doesn't come together right; if I think of it as a fruit beer, then the malts and hops seem out of whack. If I think of it as a pale ale, then the banana seems out of whack. They need to find a way to bring them together. It's a nice novelty, but not one that I'll return to or recommend unless they change their recipe. I would like to try it on cask, though."
"Won't be drinking any more of this. Definitely not worth the price (almost $5)."
"A seethru dark golden body with minimal head but it was a little rocky and it kept up with the beer. A light banana and yeast smell, nothing else. The taste is banana bread and that is it. I could see how other people might not like it that much, but I love banana bread so I thought this was great. A mediumish body that went down extra smooth - liquified banana bread. A little pricey, but I will have another one."
"D: turned me off at first, but it grew on me later, definitely an acquired taste, maybe the flavor would suit something better like a stout, glad I tried it"
"D - This is an easy to drink beer if you like banana bread at least I will pick this up again if I see it."
"But all in all, a solid ale. Light in hops, clean, smooth, and slightly sweet. I'm liking this. You drink a few of 'em. And it's oh, so, banana-y...a nice novelty that could turn out to be a regular treat!"
"D-I have it again sometime"
"D: Moderate overall but good for what it is, a banana beer. novelty wears off pretty quick and becomes a rather a boring drink after one."
"Again, I wanted to try this because I love banana bread. I don't know if I would buy this over some other beers again but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth trying. Definitely fun and worth giving a shot."
"Overall, nice mouthfeel, good taste, a beer for the lover of UK beers!!"
"I really enjoyed this one. This wont be for everyone, but I was looking for banana bread so I was satisfied."
"I was told that people ""love/hate"" this beer, so I wanted to try it out. Pours a rusty orange color into the glass, with a thin head that disappeared quickly. Lots of carbonation noticed on the sides of the glass. The smell was like a freshly peeled banana, and gets your attention. The taste was a bit of a let down. It had more of a spiced winter warmer flavor, and not much banana. A unique beer to try once, but not something I want to have a lot of or have often. I am on the fence with the love/hate idea."
"Overall - Intriguing idea, the banana taste actually goes quite well with the malt. Unfortunately, the thats where this beers ends. An average beer singled out for its unique taste. Not much body or depth, and even the bananas dont hang around much beyond the first taste."
"Might be interesting for the novelty of the idea, but it seriously lacks in the flavor department."
"D: Well, this beer could have been done a lot better. Id like to see another brewery take a shot at itgive it a bit more body, a lot more bready tastes and a lot more complexity."
"Overall, an interesting beer. I think it is quite nice, but i think i would get tired of it quick if i had it often."
"Fairly strong odor of banana accompanied by a faint odor of spices and hops. Wow, it tastes like banana bread, imgine that. I really like the taste not overly sweet. Unfortunately the intense carbanation made it difficult to drink, could not take more than to swallows at a time. Overall I find it worth a try."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice golden hue with a slighty creamy white thick fomay head. Head left a ring around the glass that lasted the entire pint (and remaining refill). Aroma definitely was that of fresh cooking banana bread. The flavor was initially very lacking, didn't provide much except perhaps for some soapy bitterness. Once the beer warmed up to probably about 60 degrees, the flavor was all sweet banana bread with a small touch of bitterness at the end. Felt a little thin in the mouth and slightly over carbonated. Was easy to drink, but the carbonation definitely made it less drinkable."
"The drinkability is good as it is, I can't see my self drinking a lot of this but as a novalty is is pretty good. Prosit MK"
"D: Hmm, I wanted to score it more highly but - the banana is just too much after a while. If it's your sort of thing you could probably drink it all night but it's just an occasional thing for me."
"Moderate to hight carbonation. Full mouthfeel, but somehow manages to feel very light."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer that is quite drinkable and not too cloying. I'm sure the ladies could appreciate something like this, and so could I if it were paired with some delicious Christmas desserts. Try it."
"D - I bought this for the novelty and am glad I only bought one. It was good, but I don't think I could do two. C'mon! Bananas in beer?!"
"I would buy another"
"Shared a pint with a buddy. We have been thinking about adding some banana flavors into one of our homebrews and thought we'd give this one a try. Amber/copper pour with decent head that came down quickly. Smell was overwhelming banana but did have some nuttiness. It did smell like Banana bread. Tasted of bready malt and banana but had an undercurrent of medicinal slightly astringent flavors. Seemed good at first, but as it warmed, it became more medicinal and less drinkable. I didn't end up finishing my half of the pint. My buddy thought a little more of it than I did."
"bottle from Grapes & Hops in Fayetteville"
"The flavor is on the mild side, with more beeriness and less banana than I'd expected. I'm grateful, as I'm not too into fruit brews in general. Strong carbonation, with a large bubble feel. Finishes malty and marginally towards the sweet side, with mercifully restrained banana flavor. The fruit flavor gathers as the beer warms, but remains civilized. I've gotten more out of a hefeweizen. An estery, phenolic feel in the back of the throat, like Juicyfruit gum. A little pear and white grape, besides the banana. Some herbal/floral/metallic hops provide balanced bitterness. Light to medium bodied, smooth and rather dry on the palate. A bit of nutty pecan towards the back, with a bit of doughy yeast. Very much like banana bread, but still very much like an english bitter. Well done. I'd drink this one again."
"This is not a beer that I would sit in a pub with, but would be great with an appropriate food pairing."
"Final Note: if you can find this beer, it's worth a try."
"This is almost like two different beers--the smell is a sweet banana bread experiment; the taste is closer to a sweet pale ale."
"Flavor is definitely banana and malt- no hops I can find. But there is also another more herbal flavor- clove, cardimon, something in that neck of the woods. It's mostly there in the aftertaste. Somewhat off-putting to me, but I can't let it take too much from an otherwise interesting beer. A once in a while treat, not a regular drinker."
"The beer is pretty well carbonated and its very easy to drink. Mouth-feel is on the thin side, doesnt make me feel like Im drinking bread."
"D: Very drinkable, and warms the body well."
"Try this beer you will be superised how good it is."
"Cute idea, but nothing to write home about."
"I was very excited when I had the chance to sample this beer. Banana is by far my favorite fruit. As for the beer, the color was a golden hue when poured from its bottle. Of course, the aroma was banana, but that didn't hide the caramel malt in there as well. The flavor was decent with the banana, light hops and malt. What I was suprised to find was how light bodied this beer was. It finished limp in your mouth. I think I was looking for a fuller bodied beer with a sweeter finish."
"This is a beer to try if you like banana bread and enjoy sharply dry bitter beers like Rogue's Mocha Porter. For me, it didn't do it because I let my expectations get in the way. I may revisit this beer in a year or so."
"I was very excited to try this beer...the thought kinda seemed weird, yet intriguing. Still, I went in with a few guys to split up some cases & this one had to be part of it-we all wanted to try it- yet didnt want to lay out the coin for the case individually, so we all ended up with some this way. Everyone was happy with the beer, it pours nice, retains a OK head with mild lacing, Bannana in the nose, with a nutty, toasty cracker like malt flavors. Notable hop notes spice tings just right to balance up a very nice drinkable english ale. Very un-like typical ""dishwater"" pub bitters & not anywhere near being overpowering. Nice drinkable beer that you can actually drink a few of wth your ""mates"" then cry about the fact you just drank up a 50 dollar 12 pack!"
"As for drinkability, it's certainly a well-made beer, and it's balanced and very, very interesting. One could mull over this one for a while. But it's certainly not a night at the pub quaffer, I think just one would do fine. Worth trying though. Unlike any other beer in the world!"
"D: I dont think Id go back to this one. Just too sweet and a bit sloppy in the mix of flavors."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: These novelty beers are pretty hit or miss, usually miss, but this isn't half bad! I'd honestly try this one again sometime."
"Fairly interesting beer that is done quite subtly. No screaming banana flavors here, but instead some light fresh banana integrated with a malty/bready body. Not bad. Pours a light amber with an okay initial head that fades just a tad quickly. The smell is of banana and bubblegum. The banana smells natural- not artificial. The taste is a little more subtle but the bananas are still there along with a yeasty breadiness and a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is dry and smooth. All in all, quite nice if not my every day cup of tea."
"Drinkability - a super fruit beer, provided you're bananas! A great beer tasting pick."
"I could only manage a few sips before giving up. I love bananas, bread, nuts, and banana bread. I do not like this beer. Banana bread flavor leaves too fast, leaving a cloying sweetness and lingering sourness."
"If you're in the mood for a banana-ish beer, this is a solid 4.5-5. But, that's a pretty narrow taste desire. I enjoyed this beer much more than the ranking I'm giving would indicate, because I was definitely in the mood for a beer of this sort. I'd like nothing better than to sip this on a Costa Rican plantation while wearing a white panama hat (yes: the hat is necessary)."
"This is a bad beer, but it's unique and trying to fit a niche. It certainly has some pleasant aromatic characteristics, but flavors lack balance and left me disappointed, especially since a 20 ounce bottle cost me $5."
"The overall experience is solid. If there is one thing to say about this beer it would be that it is true to its name. I imagine that if someone plopped a glass of this stuff in front of me and asked ""What does it taste like," there is a good possibility I would say ""Banana bread."" I'm not sure how much of a positive attribute that is to many people but its certainly worth something."
"This beer isn't poison, but it's nothing special either. Very unimpressive."
"Well this is a try one time kind of beer. Too many esters here, should have based this off a Bock or wheat beer."
"D: Given the name I had high hopes for an interesting beer And despite the breakfast sounding name, I found this beer isn't much for any time of day."
"The beer pours a very clear amber color with a nice off white head, good lacing and retention. Yes, the smell is about bananas, but what do you expect. The taste is a bit more bitter and maltier than I envisioned. The bananas are pronounced and it does have a bready or earthy tone to it, but I wasn't expecting this level of bitterness. As the beer warms, it mellows a bit, is less bitter, and more warming banana notes come through. Overall, the beer isn't bad, worth trying, and enjoyable, but it isn't the kind of beer you'll be drinking lots of. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy, the aftertaste slightly tart, and as one reviewer mentioned, it does have some characteristics of what you would find in a pumpkin ale in terms of the bitterness/spiciness in the middle."
"1 pint 3.25 oz bottle. The brew pours a nice golden to copper color with a finger of very dense head over top. Clarity is very good and there is a very steady curtain of bubbles visible. The aroma is nice sweet banana, with caramel blended in there along with a doughy malt base. I have to say that this one smells like what it says it is. Taking a sip, I get a more earthy banana, kinda like a bruised banana, flavor with a more substantial dough and breadyness to the malt. What surprises me most is the strength of the hop in both flavor and bitterness. It is nice and herbal and very pleasant in the bitterness, but it just doesn't seem to fit the rest of the brew. Mouthfeel is a very healthy moderate with a light carbonation of fine bubbles. It almost as a bot of a creamy texture as well. Overall, I have to give them credit for making this one truly a banana bread beer. I think the hop profile doesn't fit the rest of the beer, but it is still enjoyable. I think the banana is balanced and not over-done in the brew."
"I poured this interesting beer into a tubler at 50 degrees. It was a nice amberish color and kinda looked pinky also, maybe it was the light it was night. It had a nice fine bubbly head and really smelled like bananas. It also really tasted like bananas. I thought it was interesting and really not bad. I most likely will not buy it again but I think you should try it. It is interesting."
"This is interesting enough to try once. I can't say it misses the mark completely, though I do with that the banana and bread came together more completely while retaining some of the nutty quality to give it some depth. Anyway, the flavors alone are all there, and not bad at all. It's easy to drink, but it would take a true banana lover to reach for more than one. ""Gimmicky"" kept running through my mind, but better than many other ""gimmicky"" beers - fruity or not - that are out there."
"This beer is a light clear beer with a creamy tan head. When you open the bottle the smell of banana candy hits you. My wife reminded me of those large peanut shaped banana flavored soft candies we had as kids. Not a pleasant odor in a beer in my opinion. I don't taste much of a bread taste. I found the smell to be overpowering. The finish is more of the same, artificial banana. The liquor store in NJ where I bought it was Bourbon Street in Greenwich. The manager, noticing I was buying 2 cases of micros recommended it and assured me it was not too overpowering. I won't be taking his advice again. I just could not get past the artificial banana taste, it was all I could taste, before during and after. I rinsed my glass before going back to drinking real beer but the banana taste just lingered."
"It pours a nice dark amber color with minimal head and light lacing. There is (surprise, surprise) a hint of banana in the aroma. I was expecting it to have an overpowering banana flavor, but instead it was very subtle. At first I was kinda let down. In the same manner that a framboise is liquid raspberry, i wanted this to be liquid banana. Halfway through, however, I began to appreciate the subtle hints of banana and nutmeg. The finish is very bready/yeasty and kinda sweet. I imagine that it would have been amazing with Bananas Foster or some type of similar dessert."
"Saw this one in Rehoboth Beach; the label and name immediately stood out to me and I just had to grab it. Nice large 19oz bottle. It smells candy-ish...I wouldn't really say artificial, but the scent reminds me of banana flavored candy, like a now & later. The taste is kind of odd, and maybe a little disappointing. Hearing the name, you would think ""hefeweizen"" but its really not. The banana flavor isn't really all that pronounced (nothing like say, a Weinstephaner), and it quickly vanishes to reveal a bland, almost flat lager flavor underneath. Finishes watery and forgettable, and not that clean. On a positive note, this brewery uses its own well water for brewing, and fair-trade bananas are used in the brewing process."
"Drinkability: this beer actually went well with a fresh loaf of banana bread I made. But as a stand alone beer, it is interesting and different, but not one you would drink regularly. Nice novelty beer in my opinion."
"good drinkability as it's actually pretty refreshing. a novelty beer to be sure, but it's honestly not bad, and i might even be inclined to pick up another bottle if i ever saw it again. i think this would be great to have on a fall evening, as it sort seems to be in the same vein as pumpkin ales to me."
"In the end, a good brew that is just above the novelty ring!"
"M&D - one of the better fruit beers i have ever had, not overpowering, not underflavored, a great beer, if you can get this, definitely try it"
"If I found this in a pub I could drink it all night. Its a sweet beer that's not overly sweet. I'm not really for or against fruit beers, I just appreciate when they are done well, and this one tastes like really bananas not natural/artificial banana flavoring. Not bad at all."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. The beer poured a deep amber forming a 1 inch head. The aroma is of very strong banana bread. Nothing else is detectible. The taste is not as strong as the aroma. Banana bread flavor along with light spices. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Smooth light finish. Very drinkable. Overall, I was impressed by this beer. It tastes just what it says it is. No suprises there. Good flavor and average abv. make this brew a sessionable ale. I would definitely drink this again."
"Drank average, nothing special here. Banana freaks may like this, was looking for a lot more breadyness to go with it. Makes me wish for some Bombardier on cask"
"Recommended for banana freaks and those wanting to get a bit primal."
"Bananas! BOOM!!! As soon as the bottle was opened, banans everywhere. Poured with some head that quickly faded to almost nothing. No lace. Has a deep amber tinged with red hues. The flavor was surprisingly dry with some bitterness. Strong banana esters. Medium body. Naturally long banana finish. One was enough."
"Overall: It's an above average beer that with a few minor changes could become really good. If they would add a little more banana, some spice, and kick back on some of the hops this one could truly shine. Without these changes its still a nice change of pace beer that dares to be different."
"Wonderful aroma - disappointing taste."
"D - Meh, not really worth the money. It is far from the worst thing I have come across, but I'll be better off not having it again. When I want banana bread beer, I will seek out Aventinus, that is certainly closer in flavor (though not in ingredients)."
"A nice beer, worth trying and I think worth repeating. Smooth mouthfeel, and a fairly clean finish."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is ok, flavors seems to fight a little bit. Pretty much all about the bananas. I actually think this would be better if it was a little less carbonated, as well as a little toned down in the hop department. Overall not bad, though. I wouldn't mind having it again, but can't say I'd go out of my way for it."
"It's not bad, it's just bland. The problem is it's called banana bread beer and you expect some banana and bread flavors. I didn't get any of that, it was just sweet and smooth without anything standing out. Came off like an average amber ale."
"D - a great ale to mix or compliment chocolate, but not cloying. Fruity but just enough to fit the style. I would try it any time I might be feeling a little ""bananas"""
"There is a medium to light mouthfeel with this beer, however I think if it had any more then it may make the pint a bit sickly. However as it is it is VERY drinkable. Don't simply buy one bottle of this pleasant, refreshing fruit beer or you will be very disappointed."
"Overall, an average fruit beer. If they dropped the hop taste and aroma and allowed the focus to be on the banana, I think this could be a much more interesting offering. As it is, one bottle is plenty. I won't be buying more."
"The label suggests a medium-brown ale, but what's actually poured is clear copper with insignificant head and little lace. Smells of squishy banana pulp and little else. Flavor is weak, but a bit better than the smell. Starts with thin biscuit malt, builds juicy banana flavor in the center before finishing with a faint touch of hop dryness. Watery and overly-carbonated body. Light and drinkable, if not very interesting."
"Drinkability: If nothing else, this is a drinkable ale. Its character and complexity won't send you back for a case, but as long as you're not asking this to be a dessert beer, you should be happy."
"The taste was good. Nice banana front with a load of soft malt and yeast. Again a small tint of metal and alcohol taint the back of the tongue. A good beer to sip and if you like banana ... Try This Beer."
"D: I would have this beer again, but it might not be my first. Could have more of a Banana taste."
"I guess if you're a banana fan, this is probably an alright beer. The concept seems weird to me, though, and I was unable to finish a whole bottle. However, I assume that's mainly because of my dislike of bananas."
"Pretty good, and it might make a nice in-between beer when you're at a pub and looking to mix things up. Not great, but not bad either."
"Light/medium bodied, drinkable but a little more body would add to the experience. This may not be for everyone, but if you like banana bread, or even bananas, this is worth a try. Probably best as a dessert beer but could work with pork or turkey."
"Thank's to my friend Steve for bringing this back for me from a recent trip to England. Poured into my Imperial pint glass and appeared a dark amber color with two fingers of creamy, dense head. Smells of banana taffy and sweet caramel. Tastes of sweet bananas, malt, and a slight bitter citrus, lemony tang. Medium bodied and finishes dry and crisp. This beer delivers on it's label and I would certainly seek this one out again."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The carbonation is disagreeable. The long lasting mineral water flavor also detracts from my enjoyment. The beer is ok to drink one time. I will not repeat this particular beer again."
"Overall, the label states it plainly, this beer is all about banana bread. The smell is wonderful, but the taste feels tamed and short with some crisp bitter bite at the end (crisp and bitter does not belong with banana and bread), as well as a fairly light body. Just a fun novelty beer overall."
"D - would like it to be thicker on the tongue and creamier on the finish to give it more of a bready texture. Just feel its annoyingly thin - almost dare i say a macro with a banana flavour - this could have been so much better! But still, a nice change!"
"D: Very pleasantly surprising beer, wasn't sure what to expect from this one but it was very good."
"I had this beer on my 'wants' list for quite a while and was thrilled when I spotted it on my recent trip to Ohio. I'm glad that I didn't give in to the impulse to buy multiple bottles because it really isn't that good. My scores are somewhat inflated because I enjoy the fresh banana part of the schizoid flavor profile so much. It hurts me to say it, but this beer misses the mark."
"Some banana-like flavor in hefewiezens and other beers is actually pretty good. And one of my favorite smells is the fresh baked bread aroma in some Belgian and German beers. But this was awful."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a trace of lace. Chrystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Strong banana nose. Starts as a malty/hop mix but then the banana flavor kicks in, a strange soapy banana aftertaste. $4.09 for a 19.25oz bottle from John's Market Place Tigard, Or. The bottle ABV is 5.2%."
"Thanks to rogue for sharing at Winking Lizard. Clear dark amber color with a medium white head and minimal lacing. The aroma is of course all bananas. Medium-bodied, and the banana character luckily is not as dominant in the flavor as it is in the aroma. However it is still a lot of banana, along with a bit of malt and nuts. The finish is fruity and nutty. I was nervous trying this but it actually turned out better than expected. I still wouldnt make it a regular purchase though."
"I want to quote my SO: If you want to get drunk on banana sweets, then it might be OK. . I, for myself, wonder if banana beers is some kind of strange English tradition."
"Pours a rich amber with some significant carbonation feeding a nice frothy head with some little bits of foam left down the glass. Strong aroma of freshly baked banana bread. What more can I say? Except that I quite like freshly baked banana bread. Some more traditional malt flavour in the initial taste followed rapidly by a nice banana flavour on the swallow which develops into a nice bready flavour, and finally to a gentle hop finish. Quite an interesting flavour profile - beer, banana bread, then back to beer. Well balanced with both the bananas and the malt and hops coming through. I'm impressed with this. A nice mouthfeel without too much carbonation. Overall a very interesting, and rather drinkable novelty beer. I wouldn't exactly make a session of it, but if you're looking for something out of the ordinary then seek this out."
"This beer poured a clear, deep amber color with creamy, off-white foam that settled to a thin coat that clung to the glass somewhat. The smell was very reminiscent of banana bread, with notes of light malt and caramel. The smell improved as the beer warmed. The taste was lightly tangy and malty with mild banana fruitiness overall with mild hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and modest carbonation. There was a lightly lingering aftertaste that was lightly tangy banana and malt with a bit off hops. This beer was really not bad. If you like banana or hefeweizens, you will probably like it."
"Other comments: When you see a beer called ""Banana Bread Beer"" you immediately scoff at it because of it's marketing ploy, but then you're almost forced to give it a try. That's what happened to me anyway. Definitely gimmicky, but it's not all-out crap like Banana Chapeau or something. Doesn't taste like it smells. The aroma is hyper-banana, but the banana-ness in the flavor is more like an overly estery hefeweizen."
"Smooth mouthfeel. This beer is absolutely fantastic - considering the style I cannot fault it, aside from the fact that 3 or 4 would be quite sickly...this is definitely a non-session beer."
"Before you even get to what it looks like, you get a big whiff of bananas. It definitely makes you think twice if you really want to drink a banana beer or not. The beer pours a slightly light amber color, with a hint of orange. Big head that goes away quickly. No real lacing down the glass. Did I mention the aroma of bananas? It also smells a bit bready. The predominate taste is....BANANAS! Go figure. There is a bit of a crispness in the background, along with a light maltiness. Did I mention the banana taste? It isn't going away. It really isn't overpowering, but it is all that is really there, and they are just too much to take. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think that I'll have another."
"A strange beer i think. Sweetish doughy banana flavour (which, yes, ends up tasting like banana bread), but the palate was a little to sweet and even cloying, i thought it was pretty hard to down in the end, don't know if this beer quite worked for me."
