4,42.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss brewed by Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, with an ABV of 4.70% This brew pours out a nice pink color with a nice white head.  Berry Weiss has a color all on it's own . The smell is sweet, with berry. You pick up on a hit of grains, malts, and hops. The taste is bitter, sweet. You pick up on the berries in this brew.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean. The berry taste is smooth and refreshing.  Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss has a nice balance to it there is nothing overpower in it. Overall I'm giving Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss a solid 4 out 5 .  I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market.  I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jan 05, 2015"

Aroma is mixed berries, pale wheat beer (the base beer aroma is strong with this one) and a hint of liquid antibiotic. Flavor is sweet, tart and fruity with a nice grainy background. Mouthfeel is light and surprisingly not syrupy. Overall a decent and economical choice for those who like raspberry flavored beers.","EagleTalon","0"

AROMA: immediate raspberry that evokes cough syrup and Valentine's candy hearts... PALATE: a chiasmused mullet in mouthfeel--fizzy party up front, swift, flat drop at the throat; refreshing but also awkwardly lingering...TASTE: cranberry, raspberry, and malty--not offensive; like an Italian soda but extra sweet due to the malt; refreshing, but undesirably tart...OVERALLL: this is at home on the deck in the heat, or at a party where the other beer choices are pedestrian...not sessionable, and not worth a close-up here....","dacrza1","May 25, 2014"

3.14,11.7,3.5,3.25,3,3,3.25,"Overall / Drinkability: I got this an extra at a beer tasting. When this particular beer is mixed with Leinenkugel's summer shandy it is a very nice combo. By itself, I can see why others in the room thought this was a wine cooler. Fruity and the beer gets lost in it all. I finished this bottle, but I don't think I would go for another, although I'll give it a slight increase in rating due to it being refreshing. Which I suppose is the whole point behind a shandy or radler during the summer. That fruit serves as a pick-me-up when its hot out and you want something to drink, but not to get drunk. This works on the grounds of slaking thirst and it's not awful, but it's awfully sweet and once done, I'm good and have no interest in another.","damndirtyape","Jul 31, 2013"

The taste had just enough 'beer' to it to let me know it was a beer and not a wine cooler. Honestly, I think this is a beer that a lot of people (who normally wouldn't like) could come to enjoy. Will I get another six... sure, now that my girlfriend likes it and she's busting into some of my other exotic craft beers. :)","Hybrid3rdGen","Jul 08, 2012"

It smells exactly like a strawberry milkshake and is very appealing to anybody, even my girlfriend who typically doesn't enjoy any type of beer. The taste is of cherry 7up and that's about it. Not bad, But not really that great. While leaving it in the mouth, No additional flavors come through, it only feels like sparkling wine upon your tongue. Once again, interesting.

3.85,37,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pretty amazing pink tinted hue going on, head was white with addition of berry juice and flavors it's pretty much a light cotton candy pink frothing thick head. Aroma has tart vinous berries, with an upfront acidic quality with raspberry/strawberry juice notes. Flavor is a mix of juicy fruit, tart berries, earthy citrus flavor it's actually well blended...I thought I would have hated it but it's actually like a decent alcopop at least flavorwise. Great tasting by beverage definition they're onto something here, this will sell. Mouthfeel effervescent carbonation is sturdy, I actually enjoyed the beer it's filled with flavor and berry notes. Lighter bodied in beer standards slightly dry acidity, nothing like a Belgian fruit ale, but damn good drinking fruit beer that I generally despise even when made by microbrewers. Overall, I'm not into these types of beer, but I like this one go ahead try it, you may actually enjoy it.","WVbeergeek","Mar 26, 2012"

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a pinkish/amber color with a half inch light pink head. The head goes away quickly, and there isn't much lacing. The brew smells like berry fruit juice/drinks and grain. For the most part it tastes like it smells, it tastes like a mix of fruit juice, grainy malt and berry flavored carbonated water. The flavor isn't quite as artificial tasting as I was expecting, so that's a plus. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a little bit syrupy and is well carbonated. As far as fruit beers go, I'd have to say this is average all around. I've had better and I've had worse. I don't think I'd buy a 6 pack of this, but if someone gave me a bottle (a friend did give me this one) I wouldn't turn it down, either.","bluejacket74","Nov 16, 2011"

For you jaspers that wonder why it is so important to decant from CAN to a glass, the visuals on this one would be your answer. Pink beer! Like pink lemonade, including a slight haze. I am cuing up the theme to "Pink Panther", "F**kin' Perfect" by Pink, and "Comfortably Numb" by Pink Floyd as musical accompaniment. The head disappeared fairly quickly, allowing me to get my nose deep into the pink. It smelled like ... wait for it ... raspberries! What did you think I was going to type? That scent came from the equally pink, but horribly nasty Bud Light Chelada. Shame on you! I was transported back to my paternal grandmother's backyard garden, where she had red raspberry bushes in abundance and as kids, we would raid those bushes like there was no tomorrow. Mouthfeel was soda pop fizzy and the natural flavors of blackberries and raspberries were prevalent on the tongue. It reminded me of those wine coolers of the early 1980's in terms of its tart sweetness and the fizziness. I hate to say it, but this was more of a beer for the G/F who might not dig some of the other beers in the cooler. Finish was very berry-like and it was not unpleasant, but one would probably be enough for this hophead.","woodychandler","May 09, 2011"

That said, it pours a pinkish and ruby orange body beneath a fluffy head of pink foam. The head retention is very good and it leaves some really nice rings of craggy lace at the outset of the glass. The nose is bright with sugary fruit (it acutally reminded me of Hawaiian-Punch a bit) and not much else. In the mouth it's medium-light bodied with a dextrinous edge; and delicately prickly with carbonation... kind of like soda. The flavor is exactly as the nose suggests, but with more of a "real" fruit character. It starts sweet and finishes sweet with a healthy dose of cleansing acidity across the middle. The bitterness is very low-key, for obvious reasons; and although it lingers a bit in the finish it's never overly sweet. Again, kind of like a raspberry soda.

Of course, i grabbed a swig from her first beer, and ended up splitting the pack with her. This stuff is really good! It pours a rich garnet, clear ruby color, with a surprisingly thick 1/2 inch head. it doesn't have the most appealing smell, kind of fleetingly sweet and a bit funky, but nothing unappetizing. Tastes like juicy blackberries in a bowl of cereal. not overbearing, light enough to want another several. tastes great while dipping copenhagen snuff. the bittersweet balance is mouthwatering. as far as mouthfeel, it's creamy, slightly overcarbonated, but has a nice dry finish--where the cereal flavors come in.

That aside the beers tastes of a berry flavored malt, some say this is a wine cooler, but I disagree, in my opinion the beer is a little thicker than that.

I get blackberries and raspberries from the smell. I like a nice berry wheat beer, if the berry is involved in the fermentation. Tasting the drink, the berry sweetness kick you hard first. After swallowing, there is a hint that you are drinking a beer, but it is just an afterthought. I have to give this a bit of a kick on the drinkability, as I have been known to kill a 6 of this in a night, but because it is flavored with juice, it can't be more than slightly above average.","kmpitz2","Jun 28, 2004"
