I am disappointed that this brew is mislabeled as lambic on the bottle label. There is no aroma or flavor of wild yeast esters, no sourness at all to this brew. There is a vaguely tart (but mostly sweet) cranberry presence and a fairly generic wheat malt, and that is all. Texture is light and carbonation is high enough for a soda pop…is this a beer or an alcopop? The fact that is it is difficult to tell does not bode well. If a beer has a word printed on the label, I fully expect to have the promise of that word delivered to me by the contents of the bottle. I am disappointed, Sam Adams, very disappointed. The great majority of my problems with this brew could have been prevented by simply refraining from lying on the label of the beer.","WastingFreetime","Feb 16, 2012"

It disappoints. It drinks fine, has decent body and is smooth enough. If I had to drink this again I wouldn't mind too much but I'd never buy it again.

Not sure why Sam Adams decided to call this a lambic when clearly it isn't. Poured into a NB tulip glass. Pours an apaque rust mahagony color with tinges of red. The head is a big, fluffy 2 finger head with a very slight red tinge. Head laces as it settles. The aroma is slightly similiar to a hef with banana and clove notes with an ever so slight berry note. The taste is ahhh, not that great to be honest, not competely terrible but not all that great either. Again, I get more of a slight hef flavor with cloves.

Sour wheat aroma coupled with musty/earthy berry and lemon notes, banana, cranberry and slight clove as it warmed -- pretty strong and not appealing to me. The flavour was mostly fruity, cranberry and lemon, with some malt sweetness up front and bitterness in the finish. Light clove spice lingered. Fairly dry with average carbonation that was on the coarse side, medium bodied. Although it tasted all right, I had a hard time getting past the aroma each time I went for a sip -- I found that exhaling during a sip was the best way to avoid the unpleasantness.

The taste is surprisingly strong, with a really upfront cranberry sweetness and the caramel flavors promised on the bottle. It's not quite as bad as some people said it was, but on the whole I thought it was really unbalanced, and the cranberry sweetness resembled a cranberry juice or soda more than it should have.

Eventually, it tastes like a cherry lollipop. Wait, did someone drop a jolly rancher in my beer 90's style!? At least I got a little clove and banana from the wheat, but it's certainly not enough.

Thin all the way through, like someone took cranberry juice and just added 2 parts water to it, with an unenjoyable bitterness in the middle, and puckering sourness at the end, that just stays with you. That flavor lingers on the palate, which isn't a real enjoyable experience. Has kind of a musty foulness about it. Somehow manages to be real chewy and cloying despite the thin taste behind it. If you can get past the taste, it's very drinkable, and highly carbonated.

I might have to turn the remaining bottles into a sauce or marinade, as i will have some trouble finishing this one off.

Served in a small goblet I waited and swirled and allowed this one to warm up and breathe. Golden orange color with a light reddish tint, a huge white head crested the glass and ultimately dwindled down. Lots of white lacing on the sides of the glass and a lazy constant carbonation. Aroma is tame and is of sour fruit, makes me pucker slightly as I sniff it. Sharp and awkward on the palate at first this one got smoother and friendlier as it sat. Wonderful flavor very unique yet something familiar, it took me halfway into my 2nd bottle to realize that I had made a dark raspberry wheat homebrew a year or so ago with some similar flavor. Anyway this has an initial sour taste, the cranberry flavor is subdued but comes through in the middle. After that crisp sourness is a small burst of dry sweets, honey in nature but likely the maple syrup used in the recipe. This was well enjoyed with some fancy chocolates dropped off at the office as a holiday gift.

I'm not a huge fan of cranberries and this brew has lots of cranberry flavor. This is not a beer that I would recommend buying on its own merits.","Gmann","Nov 23, 2007"

I think it is a good beer for its stye and wat it is; a American made non-traditional fermentation lambic.

I can definitely taste the cranberries, although they're more mellowed out with less sourness than cranberry juice normally has.

The lambic tartness along with the cranberry tartness made for a plesant complex flavor. Still sweetened to drinkable levels. The appearance is a very non-assuming straw color with firm head retention and carbonation. Aromas grab hold with a pleasant sweet-tart character. Very clean and palate-cleansing in the finish.

It had a bit more carbonation than other Sam Adams' beers, and it was very dry. As a seasonal beer, it's fine, but I would never choose it as a frequent beer.","timbercanoe","Dec 05, 2006"

As it warms, the sour cranberries become more pronounced. For what it is, it's not that bad. A bit sweeter than I expected as well.

Big berry taste up front, to be sure, but it's followed by a wall of... thickness. Yeah, maybe it's a body thing more than anything else, but I seem to be getting the worst aspects of syrupy sweetness combined with a sort of sour thickness that's just not doing it for me.","PeatReek","Dec 04, 2006"

Very fruity and very bready but they did not seem to go together and appeared as more separate entities that just do not work well together. It also has a very lingering aftertaste of the cranberry which is also unpleasant. The mouthfeel is very watery, almost like a flat soda with a citrusy sting of the fruits. The appearance seems almost misleading once in the mouth. The aftertaste among other things make this not-so-drinkable. I am a big fan of what these guys do, so I am a bit disappointed.

As far as drinkability goes: no, I won't have another even though the 12-pack this came in has two of these in it. This reminds me more of a cranberry flavored soda spiked with some alcohol.

The body was yellowish orange in color, the carbonation quite active, and the head stable at one finger thick.

While not really like a true lambic, it was a pleasing light taste reminiscent of sweet tarts, which is one of my favorite candies. Normally I am not a big fan of fruit added to beers, and thankfully the cranberry flavor played very little part of a spoilsport and was very complimentary to all the other tastes. The beer was light on the palette despite not being too thin. It appears that I was dreading opening this bottle for nothing. A pleasant surprise is always welcome.","rajendra82","Jan 27, 2006"

Appearance is reminiscent of that of a thin, watery maple syrup as far as coloration is concerned. Aroma is fruits and wheat, as one would expect, somewhat citrusy with a slightly earthy undertone lingering in there somewhere as well. Taste is tart and tangy, mainly of cranberry, some melon like flavor mixed with somewhat sweetly bitter aftertaste, fades quickly, much weaker wheat flavor than the aroma exhibits. Wheat is still present in the taste, but fades in after the cranberry tang attacks your mouth. I honestly expected much more from this brew in many ways, smells much better than it tastes. Mouthfeel is far from what it could be, feels overly carbonated and rough on the tongue, and as far as drinkability is concerned, I doubt I will finish this one, or even attempt the second one in this winter mixpack.","danielocean03","Jan 23, 2006"

An intense sweetness filled with intense overripe and rotten fruit all in the form of some chemically enhanced syrup. The mouthfeel is fine. The drinkability is awful. It doesn't work as a Lambic as the label proclaims, nor a Fruit/Vegetable Beer as labeled on BA.

The nose is primarily grainy malt with maybe a tiny, tiny must sprinkling, I can pick up on a sweet fruit flavor, not the tangy cranberry I was expecting but more of a sweet currant aroma. The flavor is a little different than what I was expecting as well, the same grainy malt from the nose is here though. The middle is a weird mish-mash of a slight syrupy sweetness, tart fruitiness, and a flash of mild bitterness. Not bad though, just a little different than what I was expecting I do pick up a faint mustiness or at least some kind of nice little yeast character as opposed to just a clean fermenting yeast.

Not unpleasant, but not entirely convincing either. There is certainly nothing to be found here along the lines of a true Belgian lambic funk. Upon tasting I immediately think of this as being thought of as a lambic for the common beer drinking American by the folks at Adams. The flavor is very inoffensive & easy going, sweet but not (too) syrupy, very fizzy in the mouth & just the slightest tartness at the end. Nothing unpleasant, but also nothing challenging or even close to a true lambic style.

Cherry Wheat you have the cherry taste and smell. I had the lambic at about 50 degrees so I couldn't say it was too cold to kill the taste. The fact is, this one has no taste. It's just another fizz water offering from a brewer that puts more capital in it's advertising campaign than in it's brewing endeavors. I wound up pouring in some Oceanspray Cranberry juice. Only then was this brew somewhat easy to down. My advise is to save your hard earned cash and pass this one up. The S.A. brewers should take a trip to Belgium.

The nose offers a bright combination of grainy malt and mildly tart fruitiness. The body is medium and its fine, median carbonation caresses the tongue before warming to become lightly creamy and smooth. The flavor delivers the promised Cranberry atop a delicate, grainy, wheatish malt base that's backed by just enough hop to keep it from becoming sweet. It finishes crisp and dry with some residual swirling notes of juicy fruit and cereal. Quite nice!

2.79,4.5,3.5,2,3,3,3,"Slightly hazy dark peach-brown appearance, 1/8 inch head that turns to a wine glass rim-clinging ring of small bubbles. Really lacks aroma almost altogether, a little sense of berries. Why are they even ATTEMPTING to allude that this is a Lambic? Sweet maple and cane sugar malts, slight sense of sugared cranberry juice, slight bitter sense and nothing other than berry at the close. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. Given that cranberries are among the most tart of fruits, it seems Sammy just passed the buck and brewed a fruit wheat beer of no particular memory in order to not offend people unfamiliar with a Lambic's strengths (or weaknesses, depending on tastes). Sure, its a Fruit Experimental, but I wonder more than ever about the loss of the memory of true Lambic and Gueuze flavor profiles.","ADR","Dec 03, 2002"

Well...I love true lambics now, and I still think this brew blows. Don't know if BBC is poking fun at themselves calling this a lambic or what, but seriously...what the hell. Not even close...not even in the same universe. Rusty orange color, smells faintly of tart cranberries, but really, just doesn't smell appetizing. Dry wheat flavor with some mild fruitiness. Decent smooth mouthfeel. I opened this bottle thinking, ""maybe it'll be better than last year."" Nope. I hope the sink's thirsty. Where's my Old Fezziwig?","IrishRedRock","Dec 01, 2002"
3.38,26.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic: Not nearly as bad as I remembered it in years back, the cranberry taste is much more muted than in earlier versions. Pours a reddish golden color, with a slightly off-white head, that lasts, and leaves nice Belgian lace down the side (although that’s about the close as you’ll get to a Belgian lambic). The aroma is Cranberries, no surprise there. The taste is initially very sweet, with very prominent fruit tastes, however, these bleed away quickly, and leave a dry, almost Champagne taste. Clearly, this beer is very effervescent. Again, not too shabby.","jackndan","Nov 26, 2002"

2.58,-3.4,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Peachy-bronze hue with goldish highlights, largely clear, however there is a slight haze, the white head raced to a half finger in height before it quickly faded to a soapy residue, the collar of bubbles around the edge was slightly fuller than the center. It looks well enough, it didnt lace (as expected). The nose is odd and borderline gross, distant and muffled cranberries, oranges, sugar and a kiss of wheaty-yeast. The potency is modest but strong enough to perceive this unusual amalgamation. The palate is a little tart upfront with big sugary sweetness in the middle (the maple syrup?), a mesh of cranberry-orange jelly at the finish. Slight wheatiness, especially in the aftertaste, some sourness as well. There is funkiness but it doesnt seem indicative of yeast, maybe it is, but it is not all that tradition in flavor. I find this beer to be weird tasting, some may call in complex (but I doubt that), and it is frankly too cloying. Medium-light body, thinned more by the wheat, near absent carbonation, tacky-sweet mouthfeel, it fails to be drinkable. SA needs to abort with one, Lambic it is not. It is not even a good fruit beer. Barely tolerable to drink, one is enough for me you want the other? Rather lousy.","bditty187","Nov 26, 2002"

The maple syrup seems to combine nicely with the cranberries to produce a sweet, but not cloyinging sweet, aroma. Very pleasant. The body is closer to light than to medium. The taste starts out sweet, but finishes slightly tart. There's a very real sugary taste to this beer. It's really not cloying in the least. Cranberry seems to add some tartness to this.

3.52,31.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Orange amber hue, with a head that readily settles into a thin, spotty layer that persists. Slight haze. The aroma is comprised of mellow, ripe, red fruit that is unexpectedly cherry - like in nature along with medium caramel malt. Pleasant esters, mild earthy hops and breadiness are present as well. Trace butterscotch. Light, non descript tartness upfront yields to a combination of caramel malt sweetness and clean wheat graininess. The initial tartness persists sufficiently so that when the subtle cranberry flavor emerges late, an impression of caramel syrup coated tart cranberries is left. There's a definite twang of cranberry extract. Subdued earthy hop flavor. The light hop bitterness and fading tartness leaves an overall sweet character to this brew. Dextrinous body and firm mouthfeel considering the low strength. Very quaffable. Finishes sweet and lightly bready, but otherwise clean. A surprisingly good fruit beer. There sufficient malt character to prevent cloying fruity sweetness. I think Sam Adams was poking fun at themselves when calling this a ""Lambic.""","marc77","Nov 24, 2002"

It's really not much to look at -- average dark golden, nice white head that fades. The smell is cranberries on a cracker; actually made me grin. The taste is sour, but it's somewhat balanced by a slight maltiness (more bread-like than sweet). Cranberry flavor lingers in the finish. As a lambic, this beer does not even rate. As a fruit beer, however, I'm rather surprised and impressed with it.","mophie","Nov 23, 2002"

My opinion of it has only gotten worse. Poured a cloudy medium-orange in color with an off-white head. Aroma smelled of ripend fruit and grain. There's a mild sweetness up front that gets replaced with a smooth tartness in the middle that turns sour at the finish. I've had lambics before and this is a far cry from the style.

Very tart cranberry aroma with some of that aroma of nature that lambics usually have, but it's not quite as strong as it is in others. Well, it sort of tastes like a lambic too. Sour and sweet cranberries and more of that slight ""horse blanket"" character. Again, not quite as strong as I'd expect from a lambic. It's sweeter than I'd expect as well, probably from the maple syrup used in brewing this. Malt is noticeable in the background. I've heard a lot of bad things about this beer, but it seems like it's in the general direction of lambic to me, and not a bad effort for a brewery that isn't specifically set up to brew lambics. Not the best, but hey, It's not so bad.","hyuga","Nov 10, 2002"
