"Lemon Shandy pours a hazy golden color with a small swirling head.  There is a weak soapy aroma.  The taste is soapy, but weak lemonade flavors come through near the end.  Flat body, weaker flavors.  Overall the soapy flavors are pretty bad, the brief hints of lemonade that comes through are nice."

"Not as good as summer shandy but drinkable! A little too lemony for me!"

"I wouldn't call this a beer to be honest. I think the lemon taste is good but was left wondering where the beer taste went. I would drink it again though."

"Overall: I am a fan of Shandys and this one fits the mold. Smooth and sweet. But not much ""beer"" and almost no aroma."

"So would I recommend it ? I am mixed about it but I will say..Yes BUT, only for Summer (around July or August), because I would't buy this beer during winter. Overall it's a much better beer than those Bud Light lime and all the lime beer in general. If you wanna have a lemonade, lime citrus beer, take this one no doubt about it, but if you wanna have a beer with some guts, this one is definitely not for you."

"The Crack! was loud and so I celebrated with an inverted Glug. It produced two-plus fingers of fizzy, bone-white head with extremely limited retention, quickly falling away to wisps. Color was a hazy Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, "

"Update: It is my understanding that the morons at Anheuser-Busch are considering marketing this dreck here in Canada as craft beer. Lie to us some more. We love it. Jerks."

"Overall (3.65) - In my book, this beer is a winner. I'm bumping the overall score up because it really is inoffensive and refreshing. It incorporates the wheat and the lemonade and doesn't overdo it on either, and manages to keep them both in check while complementing each other. Leinenkugels' in comparison is a bit too harsh, and while still decent, is not as refreshing and pure as this brew. Perhaps it's the Belgian wheat..."
""
"A pretty bland shandy. The appearance was a very light yellow with a fizzy head. The smell was mostly of the lemonade. The taste was very tart and seemed like this was much more lemonade than beer. Wasn't very blown away by the flavors as everything was overrun with the lemonade. Mouthfeel was light but nice for the summer. Overall I'd say I'd be fine with it if I saw it at a picnic but I'm not going to search it out."

"Overall, the list of ingredients is rather off putting. The first two ingredients to this thing, which the can claims is a ""Belgian Style White Beer"" is ""beer"" and ""ale"". Wait how is beer an ingredient in beer? Next on the ingredient list is sugar, and a long list of words like ""flavour"" and ""modified"". No thanks."

"There's not much to hate, but there's not much to remember either - take that as you may."

"Can: Poured a light yellow color ale with a light bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of lemon syrup with quite a bit of residual sugars is closer to juice than beer. Taste is a mix between some wheat malt notes with quite a bit of residual sugar and some lemon syrup notes. Body is light with good carbonation. Easy drinking wheat beer with a tad too much sugar thought."

"O: The lemonade/lemon part of this shandy is just too artificial smelling and tasting. Easy to drink and with a low ABV, just not a beer that I want to have more than one of..."

"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of lemons. Taste is lemony, light and refreshing, not much to it but easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and I wouldn't want a steady diet of it, but not a bad warm weather beer."
""
""
""
""

"The label basically tells the story for this beer: ""Belgian-style wheat beer brewed with spices and with natural lemonade flavor added"". It looks like a standard witbier, and it's got pretty good head retention and some fair lacing. The aroma is like a standard witbier as well, displaying a bit of coriander and a hint of citrus over a sweetish, wheaty malt base. The flavor is where it deviates. If you read the label carefully it states that it has ""lemonade"" flavor added, and that lemonade flavoring has the perfect balance of sugary sweetness, soft lemon flavor, and delicate citrusy tartness. It dominates at first, but then fades to reveal the witbier base in the finish. It's slightly artificial tasting, but not so much so that it would bother you (I don't think). So, overall, I think this makes a great drink for summer. It's light, easy to drink, sweet but not overly sweet, and just 4.2% alcohol by volume."
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe if this were a Radler I'd be more inclined to score it higher but it's a wheat beer with very little beer like properties."
""
""
"Overall: Not very good, even before you factor in the weird off putting aftertaste. This is bad even for what it is. Seriously, how do you f*** up a shandy?!"
""
""
"Overall: I thought this was a good brew. Tasted good and went down easy."
"The taste is way too lemony and more like lemonade. I barely pick up any grain or malts. There is a zingy hop kick at the end but that may be wishful thinking. Ah well...I've reviewed it."
"O- Overall was pretty disappointed. I was hoping for a more natural lemon flavor, not one reminiscent of a powdered drink mix."
"I absolutely love this beer. It has a very crisp and clean taste. Not bitter at all and finishes with slight lemon flavor. I have tried many lemon shandy selections, and this is by far the best. It is not easy to find, but I wish they would produce it all year. It does not have the heavy powder lemonade flavor most do. Would recommend it highly."

"Final Grade: 2.92, a C. I'm not real big on shandies, but Shock Top has cooked up a drinkable one here. It lacks the dish soap/furniture cleaner vibe that plague a lot of these macro lemon beers, and would be refreshing enough served ice cold on a hot day, perhaps at the clubhouse after a game of golf or some-such. The final verdict? I don't entirely dislike this, but it's still annoyingly sweet."

"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a super thin white head. No lacing was seen to speak of.. The aroma is of wheat and a light citrus. The taste is of wheat with lemonade and lemon zest. Has a slight tangy aftertaste as would be expected. Goes down easy and would be good on a hot summer's day.."

"Clearly this beer has that Lemon flavor. I was feeling this beer. I bought the variety case and this was a really good beer. If you like that lemon flavor you will enjoy it. I will note that beer is probably better if you have one or perhaps two. It is not a beer that I would drink on a regular basis"

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, it’s pretty decent for the type of beer that it is made to be."
""
"The Belgian wheat's are always cloudy, but this one was very bright and very yellow, on the down side the head is small, no lacing and no staying power. You can definitely smell the lemon and it mixes well with the odor of wheat that I like so much. It refreshing and crisp in the mouth, but mostly watery (like you would expect from a lemonade - so it's sorta hard to hold it against them.) Anyway, it's a good Shock Top - they guys specialize with the fruit/vegetable brews and do a good job at it."

"Overall, a very solid summer-type beer. A good price point for a solid beer. I like it and will probably drink more of it in the warmer months. This may be the definition of a mowing beer."
"O - Overall, Tastes like the most artificial soapy lemon I have ever witnessed."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Not too great. There are much better shandys out there. This just wasn't refreshing and a chore to drink."
""
""
""

""
""
" Easy to down, but damn near water. Some of the shock tops are passable. To me the concept of Shandys or Radlers are sacrilegious, but this one is really setting the bar low"
""
""
"Not the worse lemon beer out there, but I'm sure it's leagues away from being the best, too. I'd grab this before a Summer Shandy, but that's not really saying too much."

"Tried at the end of the brewery tour in St Louis. Only one available I hadn't reviewed. Two finger bright white head on a cloudy but still bright golden body. Musty wheat, rice, hint of lemon citrus but very light. The flavor starts with rice, wheat ad grain with carbonated not so fresh lemonade rounding out the finish. Light body and high carbonation. Pretty gross beer. Worse than I would imagine lemonade being spiked with bud light."
"Overall - Another substandard Shock Top brew. Not a bad flavor, but the lack of any kind of body leaves this beer tasting a bit like lemon water."
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a semi-clear pale yellow hue with a quickly dissipating head. The scent is mild with creamy wheat and lemon aroma. The texture is slightly creamy with cheap grains and lemon hitting the taste buds rather weakly. This is essentially Bud’s version to compete with Miller’s distributed Leinenkugel’s Summer Shandy. It’s a decent summer beer…maybe? I guess I would have to try both of them at the same time to give an honest opinion of which one is better but I have yet to have a shandy that tops Potosi Steamboat Shandy on draft. Overall this is average, maybe a little better but nothing that amazes me that much."
""
""
""
""
""
"The creative label could use a beer that matches it artistry."
""
""
"Something about it just misses the mark of being a true shandy. Would be easy enough to drink on a hot day, but so would lemonade. Despite a slight ""artificial sweetness"" to it it's not ""inoffensive", but it is weak, even for a low abv shandy. A rather shallow brew."
""
""
""
"a weird one for sure. has a funny smell to it, soapy and floral, yeasty and from concentrate. its weird for sure. lemony, but like canned lemonade, not like fresh lemons. the flavor is also odd. lots of polleny flowery notes from the yeast, but the lemon is sugary and unpleasant. it doesnt work. its acidic and candy sweet at the same time. the mouthfeel is off as well. lots of body i think from the unfiltered nature of this beer, but the flavors dont stand up with it, and it feels somehow artificial. carbonation is fine, but that soapy taste wont leave my mouth. id say its easy drinking, but i slammed mine only so i could move on to a beer i prefered more. i dont hate this, it just isnt good. it amazes me that BMC drinkers like this stuff but cant get into a real hefeweizen. how is that so?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is refreshing, crisp and clean. Overall, as reviewers have already said, it's a shandy; don't expect more than the flavor of lemonade mixed with beer. It's not bad, but if it were at a party with a cooler full of these shandies along Yuengling lager, I wouldn't even consider the shandy. As one reviewer said, drink this COLD."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, ginger, spices, and artificial lemon aromas. Taste is much the same with a very medicinal lemon flavor on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that has some very artificial lemony aromas and flavors."

"O – This really is not a bad beer. It’s pretty much exactly what you would expect from a shandy: half beer and half lemonade. Also, the base wheat beer isn’t bad at all. If the BMC-style adjuncts weren’t added, this would be a really good beer for the style. Those extras just take away too much from every aspect of the beer. Nevertheless, this is a very drinkable and tasty beer that is very well-suited for a hot summer day."
"Shock Top Lemon Shandy does have one positve point, and that its thirst- quenching quality. Drink it very cold on a hot day and you won’t be disappointed; not thrilled, no, but not disappointed either. It seems made for this purpose, but little else. The body is a too light and too lacking in basic beer ingredients to recommend for anything else."
""
""
"Taste-faint lemon zest, soapy, thin-bodied. A rather weak-kneed shandy attempt. Don't get me wrong, on a hot day at ice cold temperature, a couple would go down easy, but a real glass of lemonade would probably taste better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It’s a good, light and refreshing alternative to something like a hard lemonade if that is what you are feeling like at the time."
"It's a decent beer for what it is...a cheap version of a British classic. It's easy to drink and provides good relief from the warmer months. And it's cheap."

"I don't like shandy-style beers to begin with, but this is worst than most. It offers the graininess of a typical american lager with the artificial flavor of a powdered lemonade mix. I'll pass."
""
""
""
"Overall - Not something I'd ever buy or drink again. It's way too artificial tasting and it was tough to get through my glass."
""
"Great summer beer. Cloudy as to be expected from a wheat beer. The aroma was sweet and lemony. Taste was a fine mix of fruit and wheat. Very light and drinkable. Surprised by the criticism of this brew. I think it hits the target it aimed for. Not intended to complement an evening cigar but hits the spot while floating in the pool."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours a cloudy yellow with a tall, bubbly, white head that holds decent retention, but leaves no lacing on the glass whatsoever. Aromas are lemonade, faint wheat and yeast. Tastes are very one dimensional: lemonade. There are some faint wheat and yeast notes, but the lemons dominate. Mouth-feel is thinner than it should be, considering there's wheat in it. Ample carbonation and goes down smoothly. Overall, it is refreshing for a hot day, but rather bland and more like lemonade than beer. I would not try this one again."
""
""
""
""
"The body is light and carbonation medium, feels insignificant and not as crisp as I’d like. Never had a shandy before, hope they’re not all this bad. Won’t be back."
"O: A very weak beer, even grading on a curve it fails. Good thing I managed to buy a single instead of a six pack. I don't think I'll ever buy this again."
""
""
""
"O: Hey it is what it is.... and for what it is it ain't bad... Arnold Palmer but wheat beer instead of tea. With a shot on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Whatever. Now I can check it off of the list."
"Will never buy this again. I'd rather gargle with Lemon Pledge."
""
""
"o: nothing special, but not a bad beer for a hot summer day. drink this one COLD."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy yellow straw with a little head, but that disappears very quickly. Smells of lemonade with a hint of wheat. Tastes of a little bit of lemon with some wheat, but is not very strong at all. Beer is very light and goes down well, but has a bit too much carbonation. Overall, a below average beer."

"I'm glad I was given a bottle of this, because if I had bought a six pack I would have had to dump five of them."
"O-not a very good shandy. I don't mind a nice shandy or half and half once in awhile but this one is just off."
"Not exactly a shandy, as it's not a half and half deal (maybe they do math differently in St. Louis), but more of just a weakly-flavoured adjunct-buoyed wheat ale. Too much to pick apart, and not worthy of satisfying any sort of fruit-beer craving - I'm thinking of tossing in something from that huge wedding gift basket sitting on the desk over there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yuk, seems like they have this super huge vat of Bud Light and siphon off a few thousand gallons add some flavoring and give it a shock top name, getting a little old already."
"Overall- On a hot day I wouldn't mind having one or two. I dont see myself purchasing one any time soon but if it is offered, try it."
""
"O: well, I'm not sure what to say other than I'm glad I only bought one of these and not the whole six pack."
"Overall: Uh, it's a very good tasting Lemon tea, not a good beer. I barely, I mean just barely, got a few hints of barley in there. I like it, just not what I consider a beer."
""
"O - This was okay. It didn't really taste like a shandy, though."
""
""
""
""
"Stoutish"
""
"Overall: Shock Top dared to take Blue Moon head-on, then, they showed up what seasonal pumpkin and fruit beers can REALLY be, and, now, Shock Top is flexin' their summertime shandy muscles. It's a bit sad, really."
"Overall its not a bad hot weather lawn mower beer and the low abv will keep the mowing straight"
""
"Pours hazy straw yellow, white head is decently pillowy and sticky, surprisingly. Faint aroma, hint of lemon, memory of coriander, only a foggy remembrance of wit yeast. Taste is similar, splash of lemon, slight coriander and wit character, mostly water. Very light in body, spritzy. Watery to a point of refreshment, more of a sparkling water than a beer, though the ABV is actually surprisingly high for the style. Overall probably a success for what they are shooting for here. Inoffensive, refreshing, and an overall lack of ""beer"" character."
""
"I don't hate it as much as I expected, but can't imagine I will ever drink another."
""
""
"I won't be revisiting this."
""
""
""
""
"O: I happen to like lemon flavored things, so this wasn't terrible for me. There are other lemon beers out there that aren't so one dimensional."
""
"O - It is not as lemony as I'd imagined but close."
""
""
""
"The flavor is light and rather bland, but only teasing with the honey-lemon sweetness, rather than slapping it up front. Definitely lacking, but I've had worse."
"Appears a hazed golden yellow note, with a thick creamy head billowing above the rim of the glass. White creamy head, fine even lacing, aroma has a nice spice layer with creamy bread and yeast notes. Of course outward lemon zest, with a nice creamy malt/wheat base. Spicy yeast component, with a refreshing citrus zing. Refreshing flavor, summer filled beer. This will sell well, across the board, not a bad beer. Comparable to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, possibly created to directly compete with that product. Mouthfeel is creamy , dry finish. Tart edges, make you pucker but not overtly sour. Carbonation is sturdy carries this lighter bodied beer very well. Overall an enjoyable summer beer, that I don't mind drinking especially when it's warm outside."
"It's as light as the original, not terribly watery but thin, though carbonation is lively. Crispness is solid and constant, and this beer actually is rather smooth. Still thin and light, but not bad."
""
"It looks good, a hazy pale yellow with a finger of head. The aroma is very sharply lemony. Pledge-y lemon. The taste is pretty boring, it goes down tasting like nothing, then a bit of lemon, then a bit of the coriander. It's palatable, but really nowhere as good as the Leinie's. The mouthfeel is very watery. The drinkability is pretty good, but the artificiality wore down on me towards the end of the glass. Overall, just another hop on the bandwagon. Here's to hoping that BBC and Alchemy & Science's attempts at the style are better."
""
""
""
""
"Looks the part, smells the part, but lemon La Perrier sparkling water has got more body and flavor than this. Thank god it was a sample. Not that leine summer shandy is my cup of tea but even that mops the floor with this, at least that tastes like it has malt in it."

"This was a freebie from my retailer friend; I would have never ponied up the bucks for a 6 pack..."
