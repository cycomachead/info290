It incorporates the wheat and the lemonade and doesn't overdo it on either, and manages to keep them both in check while complementing each other. Leinenkugels' in comparison is a bit too harsh, and while still decent, is not as refreshing and pure as this brew. Perhaps it's the Belgian wheat...","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 16, 2014"

It looks like a standard witbier, and it's got pretty good head retention and some fair lacing. The aroma is like a standard witbier as well, displaying a bit of coriander and a hint of citrus over a sweetish, wheaty malt base. The flavor is where it deviates. If you read the label carefully it states that it has ""lemonade"" flavor added, and that lemonade flavoring has the perfect balance of sugary sweetness, soft lemon flavor, and delicate citrusy tartness. It dominates at first, but then fades to reveal the witbier base in the finish. It's slightly artificial tasting, but not so much so that it would bother you (I don't think). So, overall, I think this makes a great drink for summer. It's light, easy to drink, sweet but not overly sweet, and just 4.2% alcohol by volume.","NeroFiddled","Beers"

It’s a decent summer beer…maybe? I guess I would have to try both of them at the same time to give an honest opinion of which one is better but I have yet to have a shandy that tops Potosi Steamboat Shandy on draft.

Smell is of grain, ginger, spices, and artificial lemon aromas. Taste is much the same with a very medicinal lemon flavor on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that has some very artificial lemony aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 26, 2012"

Comparable to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, possibly created to directly compete with that product. Mouthfeel is creamy , dry finish. Tart edges, make you pucker but not overtly sour.
