I do like the mix of richer grain and fruit. fuller bodied and rather poorly carbonated, but a cool beer nevertheless.","StonedTrippin","Dec 20, 2013"

3.43,2.7,3.25,3.25,3.5,4,3.25,"The main problem with fruit beers is that often the smell and taste of the fruit being employed is simply too strong, drowning out the smell and taste of the malt, hops, and other beer ingredients. Well, here comes a beer that is quite light on the raspberry in both scent and taste. The only problem is that it really doesn't have much else to take its place. Yes, you'll taste some malt and hops, and mostly bread and yeast, and nothing is the least bit offensive. But you won't be blown away by anything. This is a forgettable beer, one that avoids being overpowering but that doesn't have anything to be memorable in the least. No, it's not too sweet or too tart. The mouthfeel is great, as the thickness is right where I wanted it to be and the carbonation is enough to keep it interesting while not distracting from the flavor...but the flavor itself just isn't enough. Instead, consider Thirsty Dog's Raspberry beer if you can find it. Dark Horse's beer just simply doesn't try hard enough. Or, maybe we should celebrate a beer that doesn't surrender to fruit flavors and aims to be a bit more mild. I just don't know, but I do know that I won't go out of my way to find this again.","DeFaz","Jun 30, 2013"
3.46,3.6,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Not a bad fruit beer, though I feel I'm being a bit generous in my assessment. This reminds me more of an American pale wheat ale or an American blonde ale than a fruit beer. Nothing about it really stands out. I would not turn it down on a hot day, but I doubt I would seek it out again. Though this beer is well worth trying once, there are far better fruit beers on the market.","mrfrancis","Jun 29, 2013"

Taste of biscuit, toast, light tart raspberry, herbal, floral, and light earth. Lingering notes of toast, biscuit, raspberry, herbal, floral, and earth on the finish for a bit. Not nearly as much raspberry in the taste as I expected from the aromas. Mostly biscuit and herbal hops. Minimal cloying flavors on the finish and fairly dry. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly syrupy and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming on the finish.

The nose comprises stale raspberries, wheat, corn, flowers, and a hint of blueberries. The headliner berries may come off as stale, but the smell isn't yet objectionable -- just not thoroughly fresh. The taste holds notes of medicinal and artificial raspberry, dehydrated strawberry (like the kind you'd find in Special K and other such cereals), toffee, musty wheat, lemon rind, and a touch of weak clove. Okay, it kinda starts off fine, but devolves quickly into tongue pain. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick and kinda grainy feel.

Ultimately I'm not a big fan of fruit beer, and this is I believe the first time Dark Horse has disappointed me. I'd like to think it was the style more than the brewer.

The head, though, is more like soda than beer--noisy, fizzy, and completely gone almost immediately. The nose is cleanly grainy with some fruit that invokes citrus as much as raspberry. Yow...no doubt about the raspberry in the taste, though. It's actually an uncommonly fresh taste for a fruit beer, though it's still stronger than I hope for vis-a-vis the underlying grains. The finish isn't so good, with the less appealing remnants of both the fruit and the malts both lingering. There's enough crispness in this one to cancel out what might be a sweet, clingy mouthfeel.

3.23,-3.3,3.5,3,3,3,4,"Poured a murky brownish orange into a pink glass. Floaty yeast was apparent, didn't realize there was this much yeast in it. Nose was of some floraly hops and very faint rasperry. Taste was of light malt, lighter raspberry and a little hoppy bite. Not too impressed, was rather easy to drink, but didn't care too much for it. I'll see what's next.","HoboAGoGo","Jul 02, 2006"

3.8,13.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a murky orange yellow color and formed a pure white head that disappeared quickly. The aroma was of hops, and a small amount of raspberry. The flavor was of hops, raspberry in the beginning that faded near the end. The finish was light and a bit spirte, not really reflecting much of the raspberry.","Wildman","Jun 01, 2006"
2.24,-32.9,3.5,2,2.5,1.5,2,"The sour mouthfeel leaves for a undesirable texture making this not the most drinkable beer I've tried. I'd pass this one if searching for a good raspberry ale.","mcallister","Apr 10, 2006"

3.27,-2.1,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Taste; tart raspberries are there, but they're mild and not overwhelming, a bit of oranges, and just a touch of hops in the finish. It's a fairly light and refreshing beer that I think would have been much better during the summer.","RedHaze","Oct 25, 2005"
3.97,18.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a cloudy pale with a slight reddish tint to it. It has a small white head that fizzles down to a ring around the edge of the glass with no lacing. The smell is good, mostly raspberry and a touch of what smells like someone getting a perm. It's strangely nice. The taste is raspberry mixed with the hops of a good pale. Very nice. The mouthfeel is nice, medium body with medium carbonation. It's a very drinkable beer. I recommend it.","Brian700","Aug 03, 2005"
3.53,5.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability is not that grand as this is a fruit beer after all. I cannot see a reason for drinking more than one. Maybe if I was a girl. I can always hope I guess.","SupaCelt","Jul 24, 2005"

3.81,14.1,2.5,4,4,3,4,"Bottle provided by Eyedrinkale ala BIF20. Thanks much for the opportunity! Pours an enormous three finger fluffy head. Too much carbonation from only half of the beer poured so far. Cloudy and tangerine in color...this beer looks like a wit. Smells raspberry with some sweet and also a waxy that makes me think of a raspberry scented candle. Tastes only mildly raspberry and a little bit yeasty. It's wet sweet and lacks the sour/tart that often is found in raspberry beers. Aftertaste has apricot, mixed berries, and orange melon. Medium-light body and mildy carbonated (must have all been released during the pour). A sweet and fruity drink that's light and refreshing.","mentor","Jul 16, 2005"
3.35,0.3,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Had this at the Brass restaurant in Mount Pleasant on tapas night $1.00 off so I gave it a shot,pours a hazy blond with the red raspberry tint.Aromas of fresh raspberry puree and wheaty malt,flavors are not as tart as expected more sweetwith a firm dry malt backbone.Not really a fan of the style but gave it a try not all bad for the style but I wont have it again.","oberon","May 20, 2005"
3.56,6.6,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange color, topped with a cream colored, rather thin head. Aroma is reminiscent of an American wheat beer. Flavor also has nice wheat crispness, with just a hint of bitterness. Also a hint of coriander flavors in the aftertaste. The raspberry is very subtle, and offers just a hint of fruit flavor. However, the flavor becomes just a bit artificial as you continue to enjoy the beer. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, and this is a fairly refreshing beer. I'm not big into fruit beers, and I must have picked this one up in a state of Michigan beer confusion as I was trying to pare 40 some offerings down to 12 (only got to 21, and I still have thoughts of going to pick up a couple others). However, it is a solid offering, and one of the few fruit beers I would drink again.","aaronh","Mar 29, 2005"
4.27,27.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Gotta hand it to them for what this is, a Raspberry beer. Pours a dark straw/amber color, massive head, and decent lacing. Smells like, well, raspberries. I guess that's what they are going for so they nailed it. Taste is purely the tartness of the raspberries and, well, nothing else. No hint of hops or malt. Very clean. Very carbonated, so much so that it tends to explode in your mouth. A good beer for a fruit beer, something for the less hardcore beer drinkers to go for.","deejaydan","Jan 31, 2005"

4.44,32.9,4,5,4,4,5,"This beer bridges the gap between light and flavorful. Manages to be a relatively light beer, but with a nice full bodied wheat presence. This is definitely a beer worthy of quaffing several liters.","nortmand","Oct 14, 2004"

4.37,30.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,"On the palate there is ample raspberry infusions charged with silky, windy lines of gas. More neutral than assertive and thankfully not sweet at all. Tangy, buttered grain flavors at the root. Nice that they didn't overplay the raspberry or the sugar. Kudos!","putnam","Apr 29, 2004"
3.43,2.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Without many fruit beers under my belt, thisone was a nice change of pace. Thanks CJRMellor for the sample. The brew poured a cloudy, hazy orange/copper with a average size, slight fiz, to its eggshell colored head. Lace was good and stuck around. The aroma was faint with a berry malt on the nose. A taste rush of flavored citrus, berry, and of coarse raspberry. Its followed by a watered down wave toward the finish. Just a hint of hop and raspberry leave the mouth dry and tart. A very drinkable fruit beer. Id like to try a cold one on a hot summers day.","chilidog","Mar 28, 2004"

Good mix of wheat and raspberry flavor. It had a pretty dry texture to it also. This was a nice easy drinking beer, not real complex or deep, but I don't think it was meant to be that way.","granger10","Oct 31, 2003"
3.68,10.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"Just had this on-tap at Ashley's... A pale, yellowish copper in color with light hints of pink. Broad, loose head. Aromas of raspberries and grain. Pretty big raspberry taste -- but somehow thinned or diluted. Tastes like the berries are drowning in water and losing their flavor a bit. Very little backbone and not a very crisp finish, so it feels a bit thin. But this is a supremely easy summer refresher -- went down so, so fast. Works well for what it's supposed to do -- which is provide an easy-drinking summer brew, I'd imagine.","marburg","Aug 05, 2003"
