"The perfect fruity beer brewed in the perfect city.  GO BOMBERS!!!"
""
""
""
"First discovered this beer at a NY TAP festival. It was my first fruit beer I would say, and has since lead me to try a few others. As I am not a fan of drinking alcohol while eating food (it's usually one or the other, aside from Buffalo wings and football spectator foods), I found this beer to be very drinkable in that instance. It competes well with juice and soda and is by far is my favorite peach/apricot inspired beer."
"Pale orange color with a long lasting head. Overpowering apricot aroma and flavor. Kind of like a beer cooler, but it kind of worked."
"Such a crisp, light beer. Perfect with dinner"
"O: [3.25] I don't know the ABV yet - but I am guessing 5.5%.  I think this would be an excellent summer beer out on the dock.  Really refreshing and a surprisingly nice fruit flavor.  I will definitely get this again in the summer to share."
"Nice apricot inspired beer. Slightly dry, not too sweet. Good stuff if you like the flavor."

"Pours a peach colored and slightly hazy liquid with very little and quickly disappearing head. The aroma does, as the name suggests, have a hint of apricot, however, not strong enough to my liking. The taste is light and fruity and low on hops. A refreshing beer but ultimately too bland for my tastes."

"O: refreshing and a good thirst quencher; easy to drink; I generally don't like fruit beers, but on a hot day, this was an enjoyable diversion from my usual hop bombs;"

""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: Ithica is capable of much better. I get that fruit wheat beers aren't generally targeted at the beer geek audience, but there just isn't any flavor in this."
""
""
""
"O: I'm not sure you'd want to drink this unless you don't like the taste of beer in the first place... I could see using this in cooking or accompanying a wide variety of summertime foods, namely barbequed chicken or shrimp, not to mention salads with vinaigrette, mandarin oranges and toasted, candied almonds"

"I'm a major sucker for fruit beer, so I had to try this one. It was my first time at a local bar, and I was waiting for my aunt and uncle to meet me after work, so I ordered this beer with my fries. It was sweet but not too much so- in other words, you could definitely still taste the beer in it. There was a perfect blend of sweetness and yet a tiny bite to it. It was very smooth and amazing when ice cold! If I came across it again I'd definitely go for a second taste."

"Overall - I haven't tried many (if any) apricot beers. If nothing else, this beer demonstrates that the flavors can work together. Probably better, too."

"Has a strong apricot smell and taste, without (in my opinion) being too fruity or sweet. It's just good sipping, goes down easy (hence stock up please) and I enjoyed having them."
"I like this beer. I thinks it's dope. Ain't care what youse all thinks. Beer be tastin mighty fine to me. Peaze it. NahImSayin. building the street credit is what Robbie P says. Do what you gotta do. Get it... Kryzzl be liking it too. Das it gurl. Joel says f that bs."
"An average fruit beer, smells good but tastes a little bland. This beer would be pretty good if it just had some more body and flavor."
""
"O- It's ok, missing something in the wheat category, though."
""
""
""
"O: I was not expecting a lot from the beers I had on this day because it was a little beer cruise around Manhattan, this beer was refreshing but taste wise it was nothing to brag about."

"Overall: If it's what you like, they knocked it out of the park. Not too sweet, with real apricot flavor. Would enjoy this one again."
""
""

"Not really a beer that is going to wow many craft beer fans, but is different, the apricot flavor is good, and it is very drinkable"
""

""
"Overall, I'd not try this again. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was not what I'd ever expect from a wheat beer. It's not nasty at all, but the flavors are not pleasant for what is labeled as a ""wheat"" beer. Try this beer if you are looking for a different kind of wheat beer or anything that is plain mild in flavor and mouthfeel. To me, their are American, German, and Belgian wheat beers that are much, much better than this."

"Overall, not too impressed. I haven't had this in a quite a while, and decided to add it to a mixed six the other day because I remembered actually liking this brew back in the day. Not so much anymore. Smells pretty great but the flavor profile just isn't there. I'll get down on some Flower Power all day, but I definitely won't be drinking this stuff anymore."
""
""
""
""
"O: Smells great and has a good mouthfeel, but the flavor is weak. There was also virtually no head."
""
"O - Good summer beer and for those that enjoy strong fruit flavor."
"O:this started off okay but it might have well been labeled shock top it's that bad didnt even want to finish after getting half way through. I hope ithica's other offerings are better"
""
""
"Had this beer the other day on Tap at a local bar and grill. I've never been a huge fan of ""fruity"" beers but thought I would give it a try. Definitly a distinct apricot taste, slightly on the sweeter side. Enjoyed the citrus aroma but not my favorite beer. On the flip side. my girlfriend loved it."

"Head did not last long, cloudy yellow appearance, expected more of a golden yellow look, sweet as expected, apricot taste is kind of artificial. Maybe OK for a hot summer day, purchased in a craft pack, so only have one to drink, which is probably enough for now. Might be a good breakfast drink as a replacment of OJ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – Ah… It is an OK beer, but somewhat one dimensional and a bit to sour up front. Not one I would go to with real occasion."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler-pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, orange-yellow coloring with no head but a ton of carbonation bubbling throughout. Aromas of apricot, slightly sour apple, and sugary sweetness. Smells like a candyshop. Flavors are clean and crisp, with a strong apricot charcter in the forefront followed by a roasty grain backbone and tangy apple highlights. The aftertaste is like finishing a Jolly Rancher, with sugary sweet lingering flavors. Crisp, slightly long lasting finish. Refreshing and light, but quickly can bbecome overbearing."
"Overall - Well.. I don't really care too much for this beer. I guess it's really only for the apricot lovers out there. This is just too sweet for me."
"O: This beer is enjoyable and easy to drink, a very enjoyable beer for hot summer weather. This could be a decent session beer for an outdoor event but probably not an every day drinker."
""
"Not crazy about this beer. I did not like the overbearing apricot taste. I like fruit beers during the hot days, but not this one so much. less than average for me. I don't think I will be trying it again. I would give a try to another Ithaca beer brand."
"A boring wheat ale from a promising brewery. A bit of a letdown. 3.0"
"O - I enjoyed this one and I will have it again."
"I was surprised. Not too shabby."
"their version of the now famous magic hat number 9. this is not nearly as good in my opinion. pours a very pale yellow color with a minimal white head. smells overly sweet, like apricot jam or preserves, rather than fresh fruit. heavier wheat malt and some hefe style yeast, peppery and zesty. flavor is kind of a combination of all the aromas, with the apricot coming on first, then the yeast, and finally the malt and a different apricot vibe, a bit more tart this time, very front of the tongue. it actually crisps up nice in the finish, and isnt a bad summer drink with its light body and bubbly carbonation. overall though i think ithaca is best at making hoppy beers, and this foray into the fruit side is not my favotite. passable, even good for those unfamiliar with the number 9, but an inferior poser to those in the know. hang me for that if you want, but i stand by it."

"Overall: Not a bad beer at all, definitely preferred in the warmer months of the year. Has a fresh fruit feel and honestly you can't go wrong. Salud!"

"Overall, this beer is a good idea but poorly executed. Too much apricot flavor...maybe with more malt or sweetness it would have more balance."
""
""
"This beer pours a pale clear yellow with no head or lace. There's a good bit of fizz. The aroma is a small amount of apricot and something else strange. The flavor has an apricot tang but a strange sourness and funk. The mouthfeel is light and very sticky. Ithaca apricot Wheat is not a good beer, there was a sticker on the bottle that said ""sample not for resale"". Not recommended!"
""
""
"O – A refreshing beer with a nice fruity flavor without being too sweet."
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a golden color body with no head or lace to it. The smell is very strong of apricot. The taste is a little bit of malt up front then the apricot hits your taste buds hard but in a tasty way. The mouth feel is nice and smooth and overall is a very drinkable beer espically when it warms up a little bit, the flavors really come to life."
""
""
"O: nice feature of apricot, however it is lacking the balance that would make this be more refreshing"
""
""
""
""
"Because of the low amount of carbonation and light alcoholic content of this, it would be easy to down a few in a sitting. While the apricot is a decent flavor for a beer, there are better offerings out there where one could enjoy that and the drinking session as well. While not bad, this been is unmemorable at best."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, not my favorite style of beer, however it is done right. No flavor takes control of the drinking experience, everything is balanced well."

""

"Overall – In retrospect, I probably should have bought something else. I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers and this one didn't change that fact. I guess it's decent for the style and it does in fact have a lot of apricot taste.. just not something I'd buy again."

"Cloudy, golden orange in color with a decent head. The beer has a pleasant citrus-y, apricot aroma with grainy notes. Tastes exactly as you would expect. To comment on other reviews, I concur by saying it is a bit light and one-dimensional, but overall not bad at all when compared to some other flavored wheat beers. tastes good & is refreshing, even though its nothing to write home about."

"O. Taste just like apricot wheat beer, imagine that."
"OK, YOU CAN DO BETTER!"
"O - The aroma was about the only good thing going for this beer...yes, it's a summer fruit beer but I wanted more fruit...the wheat and malts took over the flavor profile and left an aftertaste that was unpleasant"
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the crazy apricot in the aroma and taste. This was not overly sweet, as is easy to do, but rather it was big on the actual tasting notes of the fruit, rather than the general sweetness. These qualities were so robust, in fact, that it started to obscure some of the more desired flavors, like the grain bill, that would have helped to really balance this guy out."
"So every once in a while a fruit beer will turn up in my fridge. If it is a quality brew, I don't care what kind of beer it is. I have always been impressed with Ithaca so I had some pretty decent expectations for this brew....somewhat dissapointed. The beer poured a dark golden color with a thin white head which quickly dissipated. Carbonation bubbles flowing and rampant. Smell was sour and peachy. Taste was bland- too much fake apricot flavor which came through as exceedingly sour. Grain and straw. Liquid sour peach rings. Not a bad summer beer, just didn't work for me."
"Has more of a malt beverage feel then a beer."
"Overall I kind of like simple fruit beers from time to time but this really could use another level of tart (kind of like Weach) to balance the soapy flavors of hops and wheat. Still could totally have a couple in a sitting."
"Overall this is a decent selection at a bar in the summer compared to the alternatives (Sam Summer or Summer Shandy from Miller/Coors) but is that really saying much."
"I had high hopes for this beer, but unfortunately they weren't met. Oh well."
"Overall, the apricot flavor seems extracted and fake, completely overbearing any other present flavors. Interesting to try, but horrendously balance and just not my thing."
"Bleached white head of large bubbles which are gone seconds after the pour, no lacing at all. Huge amount of bubble beads inside the murky dark golden to amber colored liquid, close to fully translucent. Strong apricot on the nose with peach and yellow apple too, soft lemon juice accents, the wheat component is relaxed and hard to individuate, slightly honeyed, maybe the graininess comes out more as it warms. Medium-bodied, smooth and close to soft, only the carbonation adds a steady tickle. Not overly sweet but, again, the apricot is by far the dominant aspect, as supported by pear and peach along with juicy orange and lemon citrus. Moderate dosage of wheat, rye and some biscuit. Dries up sufficiently by the end to achieve balance, this without impinging on the friendliness of the fruitiness. If you want an apricot beer, this should be on the short list."
"Not a bad summer beer if you're looking for something light and sessionable, but I'll pass in the future."
"D: Uber fruit dominated, but not fake or cloying. Still the fruit is strong enough to basically smoother the rest. There is a bit of substance in the background, yet the fruit domination gives this a bit of a cider feel. In all fairness, it is quenching and good for a summer novelty."
"I tried this on a whim. Didn't like this much. Off-flavors were present with the good one's in equal strength."
"The aroma was light and very fruity. Much more then I thought it would be to be honest. Lots of light grain, peach, apricot and various other notes along the lines. Not really picking up many hops in here, neither in the flavor. Took a sip and could have sworn this was like a lindemans or something. Lots of light sweet peach and apricot notes. Some light grains and a touch of yeast. Very light body, almost water like in its thinness. Lots of carbonation as well with tons of bubbles just rippling up toward the surface and keeping it the consistency of seltzer almost. Easily sessionable, though a bit too fruity to throw down too much of it."
"You could do worse for a hot afternoon quencher but I can't really recommend this one anymore than that."
"O - I want to hope that this was the beer bars fault and not how the beer actually tastes. I am going to buy a singl;e bottle just to compare it to. I hope that I have a better experiance with this beer."
"Poured into a perfect pint with a semi-hazy dark-wheat colored body with a finger and a half head that dissipates leaving little to no trace as I have been coming to expect from fruit beers. The smell is of tart wheat and yeast with a fresh apricot smell, the taste follows through. Not much else going on here, a little hop bitterness, a little more midget help. Very prickly on the tongue, a decent beer, nothing special."
"Very light, watery.  High carbonation.  Refreshing and very high drinkability.  Good hot weather beer.  I'll have to try DFH Aprihop next spring now."
"Makes me wonder if this was a bad batch or something...."
"The Rest: Very little malt presence and no hop profile at all, this is more of a apricot cider than beer."
"O- A solid entry beer to get someone away from BMC and a really different style"
"If you're in the right mood, i.e. hot and thirsty, this isn't bad at all. Or if you want less fruit, this will do it."
"O: Dee-licous offering from my favorite brewery. This is definitely a summer beer and I love it. Highly recommended."
"I poured this beer from a 12 ounce bottle, pouring a light copper - orange kind of color. The most dominant smell that I get is definately apricots with maybe a small floral scent to it. As for the taste, the apricot does not come through as well as I thought it would by the smell. It is very light and drinkable, which seems perfect for a warm summer day. It seems like a mix between Sea Dog's Apricot Wheat and Magic Hat #9, leaning more towards the Magic Hat #9."
"Overall good but doesn't hold a tee to a DFH Aprihop. Would like to try this right after a Magic Hat #9 to compare."
"The cpj"
"This brew poured out as a cloudy orange yellow color. The head was pretty fluffy looking until is simmered down to just a thin white film over the beer. The smell is soft and sweet, the apricot really shines through here. The flavors of wheat and just a hint of apricot are in the taste. The mouthfeel is smooth like most wheat beers. It's a pretty decent brew for the summer if you're into stuff like that."
"D - Very drinkable. Overall very light and crisp. The beer could have used a bit more body to avoid the watery feeling. The apricot flavor is nice and strong and sweet, but overpowers the rest of the beer a bit."
"Single, twelve-ounce bottle copped from Total Wine & More. Consider this a watered-down version of Magic Hat's more famous rendition of the same style... Good but not great. Light mouthfeel; easy on the palate. Definite apricot aroma pouring through. Light-bodied, refreshing but lacking substantial taste."
"O - A nice, novelty fruit beer that'd be fun on a hot day. It is well done and this apricot flavor is much more present and appealing than what you get in a Magic Hat #9."
"Overall, ok, but the cloying wheat and apricot are a bit much."
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and on the smooth side with high, fizzy carbonation, a very light body and decent drinkability. Not an every day beer, but a decent enough beer to mix up things with."
"O: I enjoyed it more the 1st time versus the 2nd. It's a nice light and refreshing brew, and although it's on the sweet side, it's great for summer. Second time was good, but not great. I would definitely get this again if I new it was really fresh."
"O- Refreshing, crisp and clean but also underwhelming, typical and weak. Cheers!"
"O- This beer tastes like apricots, if you do not like sweet beers or apricots you will not like this and your reviews will read as most of the others i've read. Like sweet crisp beers? try it, not? pass on it."
"D - Not my favorite beer ever, but not nearly as bad as I thought it'd be. At least there's truth in the advertising, you better like apricots if you try this."
"Maybe im rating it against what i was hoping to drink, but i def will not be seeking this out again."
"its easily drinkable, but not for me, i wouldnt want another. i could not recommend this, too one dimensional and artificial. kind of a shame because ithaca usually brings it."
"To be fair I tried this one after the January ""Best By"" date by less than two weeks although I doubt if that would make that much difference. The beer poured light gold with a thin white head that didn't stick around long enough to barely notice. There's some obvious carbonation in the clear body. The nose is all apricot, overpoweringly so, yet not entirely unpleasant. The taste is also overpoweringly apricot with a slight bitterness of hops and an off taste of something rotten around the sides and back of the tongue that isn't noticeable if you swallow it REAL FAST. That of course makes the mouthfeel real difficult to discern as you pound it down to avoid the atertaste of rotting fruit and make it real difficult imagining that another round of this brew would be enticing. Pity too, as I always liked apricots."
"D: The low alcohol content makes this beer easy to drink but there's nothing interesting in the taste that would make me consider this to be sessionable."
"B+"
"D: This beer is on the lighter side, so it'd be easy to kick back a few of these. My overall experience wasn't impressive though, so I might want to reach for a different beer come round two."
"Poured a clear light gold with slow carb trailers. Thin whitish head. Soured apricot for the nose. Taste was a more bitter apricot with very light wheat body. Finished sour, and the feel was generally thin overall although carbonated well. Meh."
"d: for me personally, this is not a very drinkable beer. my wife loves it, though. to each his own."
"My favorite beer! Nice and smooth. Great apricot taste. It actually tastes like real apricots and not an extract. I get this whenever it comes out, wish they did more cases of just this. Its always in the sampler but rarely alone. The smell is absent of hops, all apricot which I like. Would reccomend to anyone!"
"D-The over powering apricots are not a plus but it is a very easy drinking fruit beer."
"Apricot wheat pours out a glazed golden color that is darker than expected. A nice amount of white foam and small lacde patterns. Scents include apricots, sweet malt and grass. Semi sweet. Taste is apricots and fruity pebbles with malt backing, a small hoppy bite that is light, barely nothing. Feel is slick medium lively and sweet afterwards which kinda kills it. I've been avoiding this beer for a while and now I know why. It's better than number 9 though."
"Ithaca, you are much better than this. I'm disappointed in you. This beer has done everything in its power to win my one and only grade of F."
"Three ounce sample in a non-standard stem glass. Color is gold, slight orange. No head, no lacing (because it's a cask beer). Aroma has no recognizable hops, definitely a fruit beer. Heavy ripe apricot, a little tooo ripe. Taste is super ripe apricot. Light-bodied beer, does not stick to palate. I think this beer needs to cut back on everything, including the apricots. I believe it is possible to have a nice apricot beer on cask that won't be too sweet."
"This was such an easy drinking beer. I've had it both in the bottle on tap at bars, and on tap at the brewery - on tap is better, but both are good. The Apricot is so distinct on both the nose and while drinking. On the nose, it's unmistakable, it smells sweet, florally, mixed with a bit of honey. In the mouth however, you just get Apricot - none of the sweetness that you would imagine from such a big nose. Don't think this is one of those sickly sweet fruit beers. This is just wheat, with a kick in the head of pure apricot."
"I was unable to finish this beer due to the flavor and lack of anything appealing. I will not buy this again. Someone recommended this to me, now I know not to trust them."
"Drinkability: A decent and unassuming beer. If this beer was more available in my area, I could see it becoming a regular session beer. There's nothing overtly exciting about it but it is a solid, drinkable, refreshing brew. Worth a try at least..."
"Not recommended. I hope that I don't accidentally buy one of these again. Oh, and this is written by a guy who loves a fruity wheat beer."
"This is a terrible beer that should be skipped."
"MD- The feel is okay. I don't think I'd buy it again, but not a bad American fruit wheat beer."
"Overall, a soft wheat beer with a distinct apricot taste that enhances it without overwhelming the balance."
"This is pretty darn drinkable. The flavor is just complex enough without being overbearing or fake. Not a bad offering at all!"
"Well the smell is pretty good and taste is spot on. For a apricot wheat beer it is the most that taste like apricot so far to me. It has a good taste and goes down easy. Not much else to say on it. It is a good summer day beer out on the patio or cutting grass or even at a concert."
"D - Tastes natural, so its ok in my book."
"D: A session beer for sure but definitely not the most interesting or flavorful. Just really plain in every aspect of the word. Its drinkable for sure when there's nothing better around but I don't see myself reaching for it if I have other choices."
"Overall a really decent fruit beer however I can't speak for the bottled version. It makes me remember the first time I had cherry wheat on tap. I would pick up a growler of this the next time I was in town."
"Good summer beer."
"I poured into a pint glass to three fingers of egg shell head. It is golden. The smell is fresh apricots. It taste is apricot as expected. It is more subtle than other apricot beers I've had (#9, Pyramid). I thought this beer might be refreshing after an eleven hour workday in the sun. It's decent. It is a step up from the aforementioned apricot ales."
"D - My apologies to the fine folks at Ithaca who typically can do no wrong in my eyes, but this one is a little bit of a struggle to get through... While not the most challenging of styles, both fruit and wheat beers can still be enjoyable experiences, unfortunately Apricot Wheat misses that mark on both accounts..."
"Notes: This is a bit on the dry side but still has decent flavor. Cheers."
"D- Not very drinkable for me due to the very bland taste. I wanted a beer, not a apricot flavor water..."
"Notes: This is an interesting beer. It isn't quite as good as a wheat beer as I would like. But as far as fruit beer goes it is better than most. If they could amp up the wheat side of it, this would be a good beer."
"I'll try it again if by some outside chance I can get it on tap, but otherwise I will steer clear."
"D: I like this as a ""I Just got off of work let me have a drink and enjoy the nice weather drink"" This six pack will probably last me a good while though."
"Off tap at the brewery this beer was a clear, bright golden color. The head was bone white, fizzed out quickly and left little lacing. The aroma was all apricots and wheat. And the flavors? All apricots and wheat. The flavors were natural, as opposed to that of artificial or candy-like, apricot. Not particularly sweet and fairly balanced but also quite simplistic. The mouthfeel was weak and bubbly, the body light and the carbonation a touch high. Not to be too Vermont biased, because I'm not even a huge Magic Hat fan, but #9, for example, is a far better beer than this."
"Poured golden orange, very carbonated, into a pint glass, with less than a finger of white head, and very little lacing. The smell was on the sweet side; apricot and syrup, with a hint of earthiness/leather. The taste was fairly bland, until the finish, where the apricot flavor popped up in a not-that-annoying amount, and lingering a little through the finish. I actually was somewhat positively surprised, as the smell had me expecting a syrupy mess, but it wasn't that way at all. The mouthfeel was very thin, and super-carbonated. Drinkable? Yes, but I can't picture me having more than one of these."
"D: Would be hard to drink more than one."
"Drinkability: I might be one of the few that will give this beer a good review. Is it amazing mind blowing? No, not even close. But is it decent and not bad for its style, yes. The only thing is the smell over powers the taste of the beer making its drinkability a little lower then usual but overall not a bad beer."
"Pours golden orange tinted with a slight haze bright white head fades rather quickly. Aromatics have a nice earthy almost nutty apricot pit like note, mild citrus background with sharp wheat. Flavor has American wheat with apricot extract written all over it, decent fruit beer my mom and my wife both dig this one alot more than I do. Again that earthy apricot pit shows up in the finish almost as a lingering bitterness to replace the low hop additions I guess. Mouthfeel is light bodied sturdy carbonation nothing to write home about overall drinkability, I'm sure this one is going down much smoother in the summer months."
"I can see where some people might enjoy this beer but it isn't for me."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with no freshness date. Poured darker golden with not much head. Scents of strong wheat, and sugary, fruity, sweetness. Nice ripe apricot flavor with lots of carbonation. Also flavors of biscuits or bread, almost like a doughnut. Mouthfeel is pretty light making this pretty drinkable. Not one I would reach for very often but a decent beer."
"Smells like wheat and apricot extract. Taste follows. Absolutely average, nice refreshing alternative to a BMC but more of a gimmicky ""chick"" beer. Mouthfeel is too carbed. Could be a session beer, non-offensive, just too safe and average."
"This beer is easy to drink, it's pretty straight forward, not very interesting but it is refreshing and has good flavor."
"D:I really dont like fruit or wheat beers to much but for some reason i like this one i find it very drinkable and would have it agian if i ever came across it."
"D: Pretty good variation on your usual summer wheat ale, but the apricot flavor is just a bit much for me to want to have more than one (OK, maybe too. If it was really hot. And there weren't any other options)."
"Although it isn't heavy, the overpowering apricot taste does start to wear on you over time."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I had some of this after the Flower Power, which I loved. This seems pretty mass marketed with not much quality attached, however, and it seems like another fruit beer marketed for people who want to drink beer but don't want to have it taste like beer. That's of course fine in some respects. Like what you like. But I wouldn't try this again, fruit beer or otherwise."
"Cheers!!!"
"This is a thirst quencher and I could probably pack away a few of these on a warm day. Not my favorite fruit beer but I could buy it again for sure."
"T- Apricot really comes through, overpowering really. Dry. It's a solid fruit beer. But I can only have a few."
"Light bodied with high carbonation on the mouthfeel. Crisp and very easy to drink, but lacking any real depth in flavor. The apricot and wheat balance is nice, but I wish the flavor profile was a litte beefier."
"Thanks, jjayjaye, for the opportunity"
"Drinkability: Fairly high for a juice - it doesn't even really seem to be a beer. I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this one compared to other fruit beers I've enjoyed."
"D- i was expecting a nice mild refreshing thirst quenching beer for this june heat wave and that's what i got. i even ordered it on tap for my bar after i blow this keg of allagash wit. a great summer beer, easy drinking and smooth and as far as fruit beers go, apricot and wheat are a perfect match IMHO. i could go for about 5 more of these."
"Overall, a pretty mediocre beer. Nothing that hasn't been done before. This is not as sweet as some apricot beers I have had, which is a bonus. Not the best, but would drink again."
"The tartness, while mild, conflicts with an otherwise standard/typical American fruit pale wheat ale. I was almost able to finish it off, and suppose I could have - but didn't want to. Not something I would recommed, even to apricot lovers."
"D - I wouldn't recommend this for sessioning. Too sweet, but if you can see through that, go for it."
"Overall-interesting flavor choice but too sweet and muddled for me. Credit for originality though."
"Seriously...this beer is underrated. Give it a go this summer."
" I thought this was better than some of the other fruited beers I've had. I wouldn't drink it all the time, but I think it will find it's way into my summer rotation."
"The taste is a touch watery and the slightly burnt and musty flavors in the nose make their way into the taste of the beer too. The apricot is less over the top in the taste but still present. This beer isn't all that good, and the burnt flavor is a turn off. The beer is light, pretty unidimensional, and a touch drying on the back side. This is a mediocre beer with no hops, and not much of anything besides burnt and musty flavored dried apricots."
"Overall - I got this bottle at the Foodery in Philly. If this were more available where I live in NY, I might consider it over #9 as a standby brew. Not groundbreaking, but nice and fruity. A great everyday beer."
"This is also one fo the most drinkable beers ever. It is very light and you could get through 6 before you even know what you are doing. Great aroma, smells exactly how it tastes."
"A cloudy almond tan color with a whispy white head and weak lacing. The aroma is a fairly subtle but sweet fruit, perfumey apricot with little else to distinguish it by my nose. The flavor is a pleasant but sweet apricot reasonably tempered by a drinkable wheat base. It's a bit whimpy in body even for the style, a bit dead, but not too bad. If comparing to Magic Hat I will take #9 as the livelier, more balanced apricot brew. Drinkable enough."
"D: I have to admit I usually hate beers that are intentionally fruit flavored and I initially tried this only for the sake of trying it as it was included in my sampler, but actually quite enjoyed this beer and I look forward to finishing the rest of them."
"Overall I thought that this beer was a letdown the intense aroma gave way to an average beer."
"Poured from a bottle into my Appalachian Brewing pint glass. Clear and fizzy with not much head retention or lacing. The smell was APRICOT MANIA with a distinct candied apricot scent. Way more than I expected in the smell department. This would probably be a good chick beer. Easy to drink but a little too much apricot."
"(rated Mar 5, 2007)"
"D: I really liked the first 3/4. The last fourth, I fouind myself in need of a hop bomb. Might be the weetness, might be the lack of complexity. I liked it, I'd recommend to try it...just don't know if I could (or would want) to kick back a few."
"M + D: Starts out feeling rather crisp, finishes a touch sticky... I'd be more than happy to enjoy it on a sunny summer day, though, even though I'll admit it would be more of an after-lunch dessert type choice."
"this isnt a great beer, but its not terrible either. looking at my numbers its not getting anything over a c. but its still worth a shot if you want to try something different."
"A kind of bland wheat beer. The apricot flavor isn't overbearing and is mixed in well which is good, but could use a little bit more of a flavor kick. It's drinkable, but then again so is water. There's much better fruit/wheat's out there.. and this brewery has much better options too."
"Overall: uh, apricot beer. 'nuff said"
"D: Not impressed, I doubt i'll try this again"
"Very sessionable, flavor profile is good, but not great, preventing a slightly higher score in this category."
"I'm surprised at the lack of love for this fruit beer because I think its actually quite well made. Golden body with a small white head. Fresh burst of apricot and grain in the aroma. Relatively straightforward apricot and wheat flavour, but well demarcated and crisp. Refreshing carbonation and a relatively light beer. Not something you would drink in the middle of a snowstorm, but a good summer brew."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability- Average for the most part not something I would drink all the time."
"D: I really did not enjoy this beer. I think maybe I don't enjoy this style of beer thus I am biased. I probably would not have it again unless I developed an appreciation of fruit beers."
"D: Very drinkable but is not for beer drinkers...more someone who likes a light variety and is looking to enjoy a nice dessert."
"Overall this is a fine beer from Ithaca Brewing company. I've had a chance to try this at the brewery and have had some in my house this summer almost ever since. It's a nice refreshing summer beer for people who like a fruit beer or fruit + wheat beer."
"this is a super light beer with apricot flavoring, and as such i am not really a fan. an interesting change up from the other stuff ive been drinking, but nothing to write home about."
"Cheers..."
"Drinkability: Certainly no drinkability issues, but I'm not left yearning for another."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with 1 finger of foamy white head that fades fast, leaving not much lacing. Smells big on apricots with some straw and wheat backing it up. Tastes strongly of apricot up front with some spices and a nice light wheat backbone, and a touch more citrus in the finish. Light in body with strong fizzy sparkling carbonation, very fruity but just enough wheat presence to remind you this is a beer. Very refreshing and easy to drink on a hot summer day or after mowing the lawn, but not something I could drink a whole lot of unless I was in the mood for apricot."
"Overall a decent beer if you love apricot - they aren't kidding. Would be better with a bit more hops. Medium amber color with not much head at all and lacing that disappears after the first few sips. The aroma of the apricot hits you first, rather crisply. Light in body makes it go down quite easy, and you may want it to because the taste gives off slight metallic flavors at first, then the apricot, and finishes with the wheat. It actually feels good in the mouth, despite this, and could be a session beer if the flavor suits you."
"A great summer beer and an even better beer for the gals. This is a decent wheat, but if your like me and want the ultimate wheat experience all the time, you'll be more disappointed than if you got a three dollar hooker!!"
"D: Overall a very fruity summer or lawnmower beer, but could be better if the flavor was toned down a tad and the yeast and hops were allowed to compliment the overpowering apricot sweetness."
"I couldn't drink very many of these, too sweet and lacking balance."
"A friend gave a me a bottle of this a few months ago and I finally got around to trying it this weekend. I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers so I was a little skeptical. Pours golden in color with a thin, white head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is of apricots and not much else. It has a sweet apricot flavor. Quite frankly the aroma is better than the taste."
"D: This beer suffers from a lack of depth, and this hurts an otherwise refreshing beer..."
"D- Definately a summertime brew, not my thing but they did a good job to the style"
"D - Very light and easy to drink. Kind of has a Magic Hat #9 vibe going on, but not quite as thick or bitter. Decent beer that's probably better on a hot summer day."
"This beer poured a light copper with a single-finger head that didn't last long. The smell is a nice refreshing apricot on top of a standard citrusy yeasty wheat beer background. The taste starts with tasty apricots that aren't sickly sweet, which was unexpected. Following the apricot upfront, there was some refreshing citrusy tartness in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thin with some fairly sharp carbonation. This is a very refreshing beer, and I imagine I'll be grabbing a six-pack or two come summertime."
"Nothing impressive looks wise here, a little deeper in color than an average macro lager. Smell was apricot (duh) and not much else. From the smell (which i must say was very pleasing ), i expected to be drinking apricot juice but it wasn't as dominating as one would think. It was actually balanced out pretty well with an earthy taste on the tongue. I wouldn't go out of my way for this but it is a good option at a picnic and I expect it would do well with the ladies. Decent."
"Overall i enjoyed the beer and apricot wheats are one of the few fruity type beers that i will drink."
"I was going to re-review this to give it a fair chance. I had a thought that maybe I destroyed my palate with some of the other beers I was drinking at the time. I was dissappointed to find out I was right the first time."
"Had a 2 oz. sample poured from the tap at the brewery into a glass tasting glass (much better than the plastic cups that some breweries use). Pours a pale yellow with a white head which dissipates. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is quite fruity, with apricots really coming through as well as a bit of the hops and some esters. The taste matches the aroma, with a tartness from the hops balanced by the added sweetnes from the apricots in the finish. Light mouthfeel and low alcohol content mix well with the sugars from the apricots to give a good drinkability."
"This beer poured a golden yellow with a minimum head, which disapeared rather quickly. The beer smelled as advertised, slight apricot a citusy smell. The beer tasted like watered down apricot syrup with flat wheat beer. Realistically, I am not sure where this beer has been, since it was a one of a kind find in my mom's fridge, not what I would expect from a wheat beer. I would definitely try again under different circumstances."
"This beer pours a golden yellow color with a short white head that sticks around for a bit and then disappears. The aroma is of apricot and some light wheat, but pretty much all apricot. The taste is of apricot and some wheat. The apricot overwhelms most of everything, but it isn't bad, it's refreshing. The mouthfeel is good, could be a bit more carbonated, but it still has a good mouthfeel. It is a very drinkable beer and I would probably have a few more of these if I could."
"Drinkability: One of those beers that's just not for me."
"D: The low abv means that, if I were of a certain mind, I could pound these babies all day long. Unfortunately I am not of that mind and this beer just doesn't do it for me."
"D - Fruit beers aren't my favorite but this on is pretty easy to drink"
"Very mild body. Crisp and easy to drink. Carbonation is nicely balanced, but the body is quite watery. This would make a nice drinker if I were swinging a hammer on a roof, but honestly, this is a very weak brew."
"Pours a clean pale yellow with a white head. Aromas of sweet apricots, very big nose. In the taste, kind of sugary and a dry apricot flavor. A smooth and sweet mouthfeel, with a dry apricot aftertaste. Big flavor of apricot and a nice dryness to it. A bit too sugary, but it fits in this beer."
"Although the apricot flavor can be powerful, its a very nice beer. I can see myself drinking several. I liked the beer overall, but I personally prefer a darker beer. I have sampled the 3 main Ithaca Beers and this ranks #2 out of 3."
"D - As advertised. It's apricot, it's wheat. Dunno what more to say about it. Light, refreshing, and pretty straightforward."
"I'm a sucker for apricot, so I wouldn't mind having this again... as long as I don't have to pay for it. Otherwise, there's a lot better out there."
"If it were an apricot I wanted, I'd think twice before getting this again. Particularly if there were a Dogfish Head Aprihop Wheat or Seadog Apricot available."
"Nothing impressive looks wise here, a little deeper in color than an average macro lager. Smell was apricot (duh) and not much else. From the smell (which i must say was very pleasing ), i expected to be drinking apricot juice but it wasn't as dominating as one would think. It was actually balanced out pretty well with an earthy taste on the tongue. I wouldn't go out of my way for this but it is a good option at a picnic and I expect it would do well with the ladies. Decent."
"The taste is similar to the nose. Very pronounced apricot notes with a clean wheat finish. Another great summer brew from Ithaca Beer Co."
"I've decided to cut Apricot Wheat some slack where scores are concerned since it's such a solid example of the style. Whether that style is worth drinking or not is up to you. I still don't like apricots."
"Light,very grainy,very rough for what should be a light beer. Feels like cough syrup in the mouth. Not a beer i would want to drink again."
"No idea of the price but a different summer beer for the deck party."
"I bit over the top for me, but its beer like this that helps us appreciate better beer.,"
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness dating, pry off cap, new graphics. Pours a dull, semi cloudy light golden/apricot. Nose is perfumy, fruity and sweet. Apricot present, in the flavor profile, but its sort of candied in nature...tastes too sweet, and not all that natural, and also a bit watery in the mid section. Expensive lawn mower beer, at best"
"Very thin in the mouth, and I would have to say not very drinkable. I will finish this one and pass the other two from the sampler on to someone else. I'm not even sure that the ladies would like this one. Maybe the BMC drinking ladies might find it interesting."
"Part of an Assortment 12-pack (4 different Ithaca brews) I picked-up at the Beer Zoo outside Hershey PA. I hadn't heard of Ithaca, but I bought it specifically to try the apricot. I was not disappointed. I'm not a huge ""fruit beer"" fan, but there's something about the way the apricot was used--like hops--to add a ctirus-like edge to balance the malt. Pale gold color, small head that stayed through a few sips; apricot in the nose with a mostly malt taste. Nicely done. Refreshing."
"Just had this at friend's fire. Tastes a lot like an apricot yogurt; a domineering apricot start with a solid, wheaty finish. Very palatable. The middle-ground between a Magic Hat 9 and a Dogfish Head ApriHop. The mouthfeel is, as expected, thin but creamy with carbonation. I'd recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good apricot brew."
"D- I certainly wouldn't get tired of this, but some variety would be nice on the tongue."
"Well, this on is basically light and tastes like apricot flavoring. Like it doesn't taste like an actual apricot, it taste like a high-fructose corn syrup-based apricot juice with a slight light barley background. Still inoffensive overall and easy to dink."
"Poured a sunset gold hue with minimal head that was quick to fizzle out. Smells sweeter than I expected. I guess I was expecting something a little more subtle, like my old pal Numero Nueve. This beer, however, had a strong syrupy smell and taste. I could drink a couple of these on a hot summer day if they were really cold, but I wouldn't otherwise choose this beer again. The syrupy mouthfeel is reminiscent of Wachusett's blueberry ale, which I find to be revolting. The wheat beer foundation in this guy is solid enough that the syruposity is somewhat masked, but overall it's just not a very balanced beer."
"drinkability -I like some fruit beers but never tried an apricot beer. BA list well more then a dozen. Great summer beer. I did enjoy this, I picked up a 12 mixed pack."
"Thick like a juice. Laves quite the sour/sweet aftertaste. This is really a beer for those who like wine coolers or fruit drinks. It's not for beer drinkers, in my opinion. Too bad they have to include three of these in the Ithaca 12-pack. It's a ""girl drink"" and it's hard to finish. I actually poured it out with about 1/3 left."
"D: Not very drinkable. It's low alcohol, but it just doesn't taste good. Maybe it's better in summer when it's hot."
"Thanks to Wasatch for this sample!"
"Drinkability: Seemed to be over carbonated and a little too sweet for my tastes. Apricot flavor was overpowering. Wouldnt bother with this one again."
"I can see this one being a summer time favorite  itll definitely quench your thirst. Its not for everyone, but if youre in the mood for a wheat/fruit beer, give this one a try."
"Poured out of a bottle into a standard pint glass, this wheat ale left a thin fizzy head that dissapated quickly into a ring around the top. The smell was distinctly of apricots, with a little bit of the yeasty bread smell in the background, which was tough to pick up. The taste was very much of apricots, (as another reviewer noted, far more than Magic Hat #9, likely because of the inherent sweetness of wheat ales) and wheat, it really didn't get more complex than its own name! There was a yeasty characteristic to the aftertaste, but it was still mostly fruity. I could detect essentially no hops flavor, and thus no bitterness, but the beer somehow doesn't become overwhelmingly or cloyingly sweet, which I liked. Mouthfeel and drinkability were both great, and this beer screams ""summer."" Overall, a good choice if you want to pick up something for a picnic or BBQ, because its likely even your non-beer drinking friends will enjoy this."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice creamy two finger head which leaves quickly, little lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet malty, some hops, apricots, and wheat. The taste is sweet, lots of apricots, and grassy. Light body. Drinkable, a nice thirst quencher."
"D: I didn’t find it very tasty, but I’m not a big fan of the style. It’s an easy drinking beer and might able to turn someone off of a macro if they like the apricot flavor. Within the style, I’ve certainly had better. To compare it with a beer of the same fruit flavor, I did like it better than Magic Hat #9. However, this would be one of my last choices when buying beer."
"If you enjoy fruit beers, this is surely one for you. This has even more apricot than Magic Hat #9. Pours a very clear golden color with powerful scent of apricot and peach with little head. Drinkability depends on if sweetness is your thing. People who enjoy mixed drinks will probably drink this for a beer...but someone who enjoys hops will avoid this beer. Definitely something to drink on a hot summer day though. Give it a try."
"Bottle from a 12pk sampler picked up at Wegmans in Syracuse. Gold and slightly hazy with just a patchy white head. Woah! Smells like an apricot jolly rancher, or somesuch. Taste is the same, sweet, sweet apricot. No room for anything else. I'm sure there is a market for this beer, Just waaay out of balance. For those who want a beer based mixed drink."
"Wafts of slightly skunky wheat and apricot come off the huge bubbly head, inviting nonetheless. It's a somewhat thin ale but with a big dried apricot payoff. There is none of that syrupy-sticky-overly sweet element that turns people off to fruit beers. It is however still on the dessert beer side of the spectrum due to the strength of the apricot in the profile. I would love to have one of these after any kind of dinner meal. A pre-night cap beer or warm up before bed."
"Brew pours to a strange yellow orange color with a small white head that vanishes extremely quickly, and leaves no lacing what so ever. The aroma of this brew is of apricots and I think that is about it, but the apricot aroma is not that enticing, seems to be way over the top. The taste, thankfully, does not have as big of an apricot taste as I was expecting from the aroma but it certainly is the most noticeable aspect of this brew. I also notice a very watery feel to the brew, seems like it is very thin. I guess it is an ok brew, just not my cup of tea, felt it could be so much more."
"Only called Apricot wheat now with a nice orange yellow label. Was really not impressed with this beer whatsoever. I like apricots i.e. #9 and others, however this was very blah. A very pale yellow color. Had a very wheat taste to the beer, almost like drinking a loaf of bread, was not a big fan. Had a very decent apricot flavor in the end though and some decent apricot smell. Not one of my favorites, worth it to try if you get the ithaca mixed case, but wouldnt buy a 6 pack."
"Fizzy and light body, but surprisingly not very carbonated in the mouthfeel. Easy to drink. A bit tart, but overall kind of dull and uninteresting."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability...well this is the second beer in my long list that I've actually had to pour out."
"Pretty average looking beer - pale golden color without much of a head. Smell is strong apricot with a graininess lurking in the background. Taste is apricots balanced nicely with the wheat flavor. What makes this beer work for me is that it's not really sweet like a lot of fruit beers. Mouthfeel is denser than one would think from looking at it, has a dry finish with a bit of lingering apricot flavor. I'm not a big fan of fruit beers, but I did enjoy this one and found it to be quite refreshing and easy to drink."
"Taste is a malty wheaty light ale with a hint of nicely ripened apricot as it is described. Im not a huge fan of fruit beers but on a hot day, they can be appropriate and this might be one of th ebest fruit beers I have tried. Definitely a good one for the style and I would definitely buy it again."
"While I'm going from memory here, I believe that this is a slightly drier version."
"Would probably make a pretty good ice-cold swiller after mowing."
"I also just remembered that my friend Heather has a chicken and dried apricots recipe that would maybe benefit from a hint of this beer."
"D: Definately a drinkable beer. I am suprised as I don't particularly like fruit beers, but on a hot, humid day like today, it was perfect."
"Drinkability: very bland flavor-wise, and this beer is one I can't see drinking again. This may appeal to non-beer drinkers."
"Because there's not too much beer character to lose, this would probably stand up to being served ice cold on a hot summer day."
"Courtesy of a travelling co-worker. Murky golden color with a medium off-white fizzy head that disappears pretty quickly. Nice apricot aroma, along with a bit of malt. Light-bodied and fruity with apricot being the dominant flavor, however there is a strange sweetness/staleness in the background that ruins it somewhat. The finish is fruity, wheaty and short. Alright in some respects but the off flavors hurt this beer too much."
"This pours a very light yellow straw with a smallish white head that disappears quickly. The smell is very strong with apricots and bakers yeast along with a strong nut aroma. The smells are so strong that they have to be artificial. If you sniff this for any length of time it can even get alittle sickning. It's not bad in small dosages,but I don't think I've ever smelled a beer as strong as this. The taste is like the smell only not as strong. This is all apricot, nuts ,and ""bisquits"". The m/f is light with the strong flavors not mixing all that well. This isn't a bad beer, it's just too strong. If Ithaca made a more subdued version , this would be much better. I had a hard time finishing one."
"Poured a dense bright-white head that was held up by a storm of carbonation. Transparent straw-colored beer holds a ton of bubbles. Apricot aroma is pretty potent, and almost like a perfume. It's a bit much and a little artificial to me. Apricot is mellow and subued in the flavor, and I think there is a dash of coriander in there as well. I think I might taste a little malt, or in this case wheat, but I'm not really sure. Mouthfeel is soft and fluffy; rather nice. It's apricoty, but you knew that. The only things I'd change would be to make the apricot flavor a little more natural/mellow and the finish much crisper, but those are my opinions."
"A very drinkable fruit beer. A perfect light summer drink."
"Pours a medium yellow with a good head that quickly dissipates. Strong apricot nose with a slight whaety undertone. A bit overdone on the apricot...probably a bit more refreshing in the summer. Medium mouthfeel, a bit too ""thick a finish"". Ok on the drinkability scale, but Dogfish Aprihop is abetter choice. Worthe a try, especially in warmer weather."
"This beer pours a very pale, clear yellowish color with a medium white head that disapates very quickly. The aroma is very floral with strong notes of apricot and a bit jammy. The taste definitely apricot but not a whole lot more, some wheat notes. This beer is very light and easy to drink but not very complex."
"It's a good beer, i might have enjoyed it more if I was in the mood for such a light beer. I might buy some again sometime, but it's nothing that will be on my mind to pick up."
"Pours a very light color.Almost watery looking.No head or lacing to speak of. But don't judge a book by the cover. This is a nice lignt beer for the summer. The fruity taste was enjoyable. It has a sour apple bite to it. If your looking for somthing light with a different taste,give it shot!"
"The beer poured a bland yellow with hints of pink and orange in it. There is also no head. The aroma is very strong with a chemical apricot, with some malts in there. The taste is of apricot and astrigency. way too sweet lmost like a dessert wine. Reisling to be exact. only carbinated. There is bitterness in the end but it is more like rotted fruit bitter than hops bitter.The mouthfeel was sharp with large bubbles and a dry finish. Not a pleasant beer in my book."
"Pours light amber, not much lacing, but a crapload of effervescence. I think it was too bubbly. Smell was good with a nice whiff of apricots along with light flowery hops. Taste followed well with a light IPA floweriness, some wheats, and solid real-tasting apricots. Don't get me wrong, this ain't no #9, but it's certianly a nice refreshing option."
"Moderate mouthfeel, crisp, and a little sticky with lots of bubbles. Insanely drinkable."
"Its not for me, but a go if you like the really sweet brews."
"Blechhkk... this is pretty nasty stuff. I was glad to see something somewhat local out here in Western New York for the summer and jumped at the chance to pick up a mixed 12 of Ithica. 4 different beers. 3 were really good, and I was sort of skeptical about this one, and I was right. It pretty much sucks. Pours a yellowy fizzy mess. And I'm talking soda fizzy, not your average beer carbonation. Smells like soda too, sugary and fruity, way too fruity, not a nice subtle hint like in some fruit beers. Oh god... after another few sips I have to drop that taste down to a 1. And I hate to do it, because their other beers are great, but this deserves a bashing. Tastes like straight up juice or soda, hardly any recognizable beer qualities. No hops. I'm sure there's malt in there (and hops too, I guess?) but there's no character shining through. I don't think I can finish this... and I NEVER pour a beer down the drain... until now."
"Tastes delicious- apricots, some other fruits- raspberry and orange, mostly. Tastes like fruit juice- but it's spiked. I think I could turn any self-proclaimed beer hater into a beer lover with this beer. It just tastes deliciously fruity. It also feels great- lots of bubbles, nice crisp finish. Crazy drinkability- I've never emptied my glass that quickly. A delicious, very drinkable beer. Fellows, this one will turn your girls into beer drinkers. Trust me."
"A 5 in enjoyability."
"Pours a slightly cloudy medium light straw with not much head or lace. Poor head retention. Aroma of apricot and wheat (duh), but more so of the sweet apricot. Taste is apricot with some slight wheat malt (duh again). Finishes with a mild hop bitterness. Overall not my favorite type of beer but I'm sur it tastes pretty good on a hot summers day. An OK brew but not much to write home about."
"Bender Factor: The perfect way to finish a 12 sampler off by yourself. Makes you think that you are getting rehydrated. Ordered after a long night of drinking Stouts and IPA's. Way better than Magic # 9, which is a weak apricot wheat pursuing Blue Moon. Ithaca stands alone."
"A pretty fun beer. Definitely worth a try based on its strong fruit character, but it's not wildly complex. Well suited to vary one's drinks during a night of continuous consumption, especially with its light and smooth texture and peppy drinkability."
"The only non macro or big import served at the bar at Belhurst Castle so I gave it a try even though not a huge fan of apricot brews,poures a somewhat hazy straw with no head to speak of poured two bottles and no head in either looked flat.A big canned apricot aroma going on (like a few others noted) with some toasted graininess,taste is like sweeteded apricots and and toasted malt even more of the latter in the finish and aftertaste,went down quite easy.Not bad for an apricot ale have had better I let my wife normally drink these."
"Cloudy, golden liquid with a strong, artificial-smelling apricot aroma. The apricot smell dominates the nose, and not much else comes through. Taste is slightly grainy, without the wheat-beer qualities that I expected. Its a very soft, almost watery beer with essentially no aftertaste. This is a beer for the unadventurous non-beer drinker. I did not enjoy it."
"First imperial pint glass pours with a 1/2"" bright white head, which fades rather quickly, and minimal lacing. Clear, pale straw brew, with a strong apricot aroma, with an undercurrent of grainy wheat. Just what I expected, which is always nice. Taste is quite tartly of apricots, carried by the wheat body, light as it is. Mouthfeel and drinkability are average, but for nothing to write home about. I know, I'm not the biggest fruit beer aficianado anyways, but give me a good one and I'll give it its due props. This one isn't one of the earth-shakers, in my book."
"This is an okay brew. It is an average wheat with plenty of room for improvement."
"For being an american wheat, this is pretty drinkable. Obviously, a beer like this would be better suited for the summer, but it was just fine with my orange and ginger chicken creation in the dead of winter. It's flavored, but at least the flavoring works well with the malt."
"Drinkability: A litle too malternative for me. Needs more ale character. Probably nice well chilled on a hot summer day."
"Not for every day, but definately a sweeter summer favorite."
"The beer pours a clear golden color with no head or lacing. The aroma is of sweet apricots and little wheat malt. The taste is the same. It's not an overpowering apricot taste, but the flavor sticks out at you. The body is low to medium. It's a drinker, especially on those hot summer days. This is a favorite of my wife, but she's a sucker for a pale fruit beer. I just don't care for wheat beers that are not hazy and ringing with wheat taste and aroma."
"Fuller bodied than most wheats. I'm typically not a fan of fruit beers but this one has a light apricot flavor that's not overwhelming."
