"Overall- A nice and tasty brew that has a great level of darker fruit flavor all while not being obnoxious in sweetness.  This is a rather pleasant drinker and a well crafted fruit beer overall."
""
"Overall, a very interesting brew.  The flavor and carbonation combo is knockout!  Like a ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb!  That being said, there's not a whole lot that makes me think ""beer"" when I drink this apart from the yeasty aftertaste, but I'm somehow still very entranced by the flavor and aroma qualities.  A great choice for when you want a beer, but don't want a beer at the same time - if that makes sense.  In a nutshell - Fun and uncomplicated."

"O-  Right there with New Glarus fruit beers, and that is saying something!"
""
""
"Sweet,  but not overpoweringly so,  like commonly available kriek beers in the US.   A bit pricey,  but a treat good for an occasional shake up."
""

"Super sweet, didn't taste like beer really, tasted more or less like grenadine"

"Tried this one tonight. According to the description that is found on the beer menu, it was definitely described correctly. Deep ruby in color but mouthfeel was lacking body. Cherry taste was most evident and pleasurable. Decent lacing in the flight glass. It was lacking in some areas but I was pleased in others. Great dessert beer all around."
"Nice for other people not my type of beer"
"I really dislike a strong, sweet, cherry flavor, hence the lower flavor score(I grabbed this by mistake), but it had a great mouth feel. Great color. All in all I'd drink it again, but I wouldnt buy again. Just not my cup of brew."
"The cherry (cranberry?) juice takes things over in the flavor but there is still a hint of toasted biscuit malts to balance that tart fruitiness out. Tart finish. Has a wine-like feel.  This has to be one of the better fruit beers I have tried.  It is fruity, yes, but it still acts like a beer."
"O:  It isn't nearly as bad as cherry wheat.  Very one not with not a lot of complexity.  Cherry flavor is better than it smells but it does get cloying after awhile"

"I'd give it a 5 if it was up against any other cherry beer; it's best in it's class. This is a beer I can use as a gateway drug for wine drinkers. While other beers in the fruit/lambic arena are more akin to wine coolers, this has some of the deep richness of a sweet deep red wine. the cherry flavor mixing with the donker makes for an excellently, drinkable, enjoyable beer. The fact that I can drink more than one of these in a row , unlike many lambics or perrys where my palate needs a break, is a testimony to it's good balance and flavor. It is a great balance of the tart with the sweet. The malt and deep flavors of the beer seem to yield to the natural, great tasting flavor of dark red cherries."
""
""
""

"The flavour seems to be a bit divisive - you either love it or loathe it. Me? I love it, and if you like cherry beers then you owe it to yourself to at least try this."

"Not a beer that you slam but one you sip.  Cherry notes are prominent and the sweetness is not overbearing.  Excellent special occasion beer.  Happy I was able to partake."
"I believe this is a bit underrated previously and would certainly recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth for their beers and very welcome surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, that is yuck!"
""
"This is so deeply fruity with a nice touch of sweetness, but balanced by the tart finish. Rich but light bodied. Attractive red amber color with a fine-grained and long-lasting foam. Zingy on the tongue with just a nice acidity, like real fruit."
"Overall: Plenty of cherries but enough of everything else to keep the drinker occupied.  The light tartness really adds some authentic flavors which keep this from being overly sweet."
""
"Flavour not to my liking."

"Wasn't expecting that much but was pleasantly surprised.  Aroma is a biscuit and cherries.  The flavor is full-bodied with a nice cherry sour element.  Extremely well-balanced with the 8% ABV thoroughly hidden.  The beer flavor is subtle but definitely present with a faint hop element in the aftertaste.  You have to enjoy cherries to appreciate this beer, but it's outstanding if that's what you're looking for."
""
"Bottle from World of Beer as a carryout.  Pours dark, deep red colored with a finger of pink head that recedes quickly.  Cherry boquet off the top of this one , slightly tart but mostly black sweet ones, a bit of cranberry note, very fruity and not much else going on, though it's nice if you're a fan of cherries. Flavor is a big punch of black cherries, not much in the way of hops or malt or yeast or sourness here.  Basically black cherry juice with some carbonation.  Nevertheless, this isn't extremely overly sweet and is somewhat pleasant as a dessert beer.  Medium bodied with plus carbonation that keeps things from being super syrupy.  Overall worth having if in the mood for cherries.  The thing that sticks out to me here is that it comes with huge black cherry flavor, but without the medicinal cough syrup notes that can often be associated with that."
"No... not really for me. The huge raspberry flavor in the aroma and taste really come across as more ""cough syrup"" like than anything. Not very drinkable, had to sip slowly. There's not a whole lot to this beer other than that fruity flavor that overpowers everything else. A little alcohol bitterness and some metallic aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark reddish brown body, has a delicious cherry smell and the flavor is of strong cherry syrup. Very solid beer, but hard to drink a lot of this at once."

"If you like fruity beers and are not in to hoppy beers, you might find this very yummy."
""
""

"The best thing I can say is that ounce for ounce, it is cheaper than cherry cough medicine. The cherry is cloyingly sweet. There is a light tartness that is insufficient for balancing sweetness. There is a bitter medicinal aftertaste. Is this sweetness artificial? Is that where the bitterness is coming from? Disappointing"
""
"O: First time for this beer and it is quite an experience. Was expecting a slightly tart cherry belgian ale and get a cherry lifesaver. Like I said, this being my first experience and with 2+ years on it, not sure how accurate this review will be for some people who get it fresh (I got this for $1.50 and didn't check the bottled on date...oops!). Good after dinner drink"
""

"O: I intend to buy a few bottles to throw in the cellar!"

"If you ever tried domestic sour cherry liqueur, this is what beer taste like, and smells also. Sharp,a bit sweet, refreshing and strong. Unlike liqueur, not sticky, and feeling on tongue last shorter. Very good after desserts, especially cakes and pies. Besides cherries, slight amount of wood, pine and earth can be felt."

"Food pair: Drink as a dessert with vanilla ice cream or drink as aperitif. Drinking it will make you hungry."

"Not the ideal color for ale. Strong cherry flavor up front but a bit of a mucky aftertaste. Really tough to match this one up with foods either. This was one of the least enjoyed red ales I've had. I'd stick with a kriek lambic like Timmermans in the future"
""
"O: This is Zima with a double-shot of cherry cough syrup. I've had a really good sour beer with cherries before, so cherries aren't the problem. It's the fact that this is simply not a good beer. Pretty much a drain pour."

"Poured into a Rastel goblet. Excellent head with large bubbles. A bit of a champagne feel to the pour - very effervescent. In the glass the beer is a dark ruby/garnet color. Smell is good. Very sweet. A hint of jolly rancher in the nose. The mouthfeel is wonderful, very refreshing and tangy. Taste is sweet but balanced, definitely not a session beer but a good change-up or after dinner beer. Very enjoyable, but not one to have everyday."

"Draught @ Sharpedge Creekhouse: Served in a great Kasteel Chalice. This one pours a dark ruby tinged brown color. There was a wisp of a tan head that left some lacing. It has a nice nose. Some cherries, and some sweet caramel malts. Some other fruits hiding down in there. The flavor is very nice. Cherries on top. A hint of tingling on the tongue. Good malt body, with some sweetness. A touch of chocolate also. I wouldnâ€™t sit down and drink a lot of these, but I would definitely have it again!"

"Overall / Drinkability: I feel that the beer is the vehicle that carries and showcases the cherries, and allows the cherry flavor to be the main highlight, but not be too much. Alcohol is very well hidden; I doubt I would ever know this was 8% ABV unless I had looked it up prior to drinking it. A very nice beer showcasing cherries. That being said, I cannot have more than one. It's good, but by the end of the glass my palate is tired and wants something else. If the Belgian ale underneath could come out more and play with the cherries, then you'd have something really amazing here. Glad I tried it, but at the price here in the US, doubt I would get it again."

" O: Cherry, cherry and some more cherry, deceptive, wouldnâ€™t want too many, could be ruinous."
""
""
""
"O: This was, after the apperance, a nice surprise."
"Merely okay in the world of beers, certainly below the high standard which Belgium cranks out. Might be something to try if you're in the mood for a beer which tastes little like beer. If so, I prefer Quelque Chose."
""
"O - A very good fruit beer. Something I'd have to be in the mood for, and to be honest as good as it was, a bomber of this was just a little much. A 11.2 oz would be perfect."
"Medium bodied, synthetic candied mouthfeel. A little cloying on the finish."

"That was a little better but I'm not a fan of either."
"To the Point: need I say it again â€¦ cherry; I think I am drinking a cherry cola; I donâ€™t think I can finish even on bottle of this; half way thru and I am taking this glass to my wife; if you like cherry flavored colas this would be perfect for you;"
"O: Very different than anything I've ever had before. It's worth trying just for the experience but I wouldn't make this a go to beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For me one of the best beers ever!"

"Overall strong cherry dominance hides the alcohol. Would serve well as a dessert/winter holiday beer."

"B/low B+"
"o: Tastes a good bit better than it smells, but still not very good. Awesome cough syrup, but lousy beer."
""
""
"This is a great dessert beer. I couldnt drink more than one of these, or drink them very often but I really enjoyed it with some dark chocolates."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very straightforward cherry beer. Recommended if you're willing to accept that this is in no way close to a traditional Kriek and just want a cherry bomb."
""
""
"Overall: I may drink this beer again, but only in limited quantities. I would compare it to dessert wine, because it is good in small quantities, but too rich to drink it all."
"The overall effect in the hot Thai climate in which I enjoyed this was quite refreshing, something that most Belgians are not able to do. There's a bit of fizz and a light feel to the beer overall which works for hot weather. I am not sure that this would be a good session drink, seemed to me this is great as a one off, but I am not inclined to write it off as such. I am intrigued and will be indulging again soon, for sure."

"Yes, this was strong but it needed the booze to give it some oomph. While not as sour as a Lambic or light as most other beers that fell under this category, this certainly was a fruit beer that was almost good enough to stand up as a dessert unto itself. It fell just a bit short because the artificial aspect was too pronounced here but even with that being said, this can be enjoyed just on its own and would pair nicely with something like a cheesecake that could add some depth and sweetness to this slightly-mild brew."
"This beer was great after having a good meal. Opened a bottle of this as a dessert. The pour was a reddish brown color with a good looking head on it. The smell of the cherries were pretty impressive mixed with a little funk and some yeast. The taste of the beer is sweet and has just a bit of tartness to it from the cherries. The mouthfeel is light and pretty refreshing, has a good amount of lively carbonation. Overall I feel that this beer is quite good. Worthy of checking out."
""
""
"My Grandma would love this."
"This beer was a hit with my girlfriend that does not like beer, I gave it to her to finish."
""
"Overall: It delivers what was promised. Liquid dessert."
"Absolutely delicious...I LOVE cherries and I loved this. Sweet, but not TOO sweet with just a hint of tart. Awesome."
"Review #2300. Kind of like how when you were 18, you thought you'd be dead by the time you were 30. . ."

""
""
""
""
"O: This beer can be considered one dimensional, but it's a nice one to enjoy if you like cherries. This would make for a nice selection if you want something fruity but is a lot heavier compared to a lambic."
""
"Overall: Nice sweet and tart notes. Some sour notes and oak flavors too."
"Mouthfeel: Medium body with a tight fizzy carbonation. A bit softer than soda but the flavors would make you think you were drinking one. No sight of the 8.0%. Nice flavorful fruit beer."

"Not a fun of fruity beers, unless if it's a hot day and I want something to quench my thirst, and even then most probably I will go for a lager, but anyway, this is very drinkable and made me realize there are good fruit beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Too sweet and syrupy to my taste. Fruit beers, I prefer the drier ones like Cantillons or 3Fonteinens. I do not recommend this one"
"Overall: Very good beer. Goes well with meals."
""
""
""
""
""
"The poor is pretty good. A light tan head on the beer is kind of underwhelming for the sweet cherry aroma that is there. The beer itself is a dark maroon color. The taste is glorious! It's as if God picked cherries and placed them in your mouth. This is how a fruit beer should taste. It has a long finish; the goodness stays with you for the night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very drinkable fruit beer. I'll get it again."
""
"Nice fruit ale with a little too much of that cough syrup flavor. Still rich, but tart. A little heavy on the sweetness."
""
""
"Overall, a good fruit beer, but I prefer fruit beers where the fruit flavor is stronger and isn't competing with too many other flavors. I suppose I should appreciate complexity, but for some reason I don't when it comes to fruit beers. There's something about the exact mix of flavors here that just didn't quite work for me. I'll likely revisit this one again someday."
""
"O: This reminds me of NG Belgian Red, in its syrupy cherry flavor. Not my favorite, but I can appreciate the style every once in a while."
""
"Pours mahogany-red. Brilliantly clear. Tan 1.5 inch head that quickly dissipates to 1/8 inch. tan. The nose has distinct sweet-cherry notes. Moderate-to-light carbonation. Very modest Belgian lace. Medium-light body. Nicely restrained fruit with bitter notes (hops and cherry pits?). The ABV is not evident on the palate. Well-balanced, delicious ale. Lingers pleasantly. Bitter, palate cleansing notes are evident in the finish."
""
""
"I kinda like the color of this beer: brownish red. Smell is not very pleasant. I can somewhat smell the base brown beer under it all, but the main thing I pick up is sugar and cough syrup. The taste. Where do I begin? This tastes like straight up cherry cough syrup with a hint of maraschino cherries. There's a touch of tartness in the finish, but it's not enough to fix this mess. Mouthfeel is sticky and could use more carbonation. This is so gross. Not drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I am very impressed with this beer and wish I would have opened it up over the summer when it was warmer. The alcohol is nowhere to be found and this is really a guzzler. I really need to seek out some more Krieks and see how this stacks up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and lots of dark cherry aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly medicinal cherry flavor. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
""
"A quick story, if you find it in your hearts to give me the time to tell it. I may be a bit jaded when it comes to what I believe is a quality beer, and have succumbed to the hype of certain styles of brew over the years. I also succumbed to a 6'2"" Czech, but that is another tale. Or tail. I would never in my life take a sip of a damn fruity beer, and the thought of adding fruit was a novelty meant for punier men than me. I have been proven wrong tonight my friends. For tonight I have been exposed to the greatness that is Kasteel Rouge. A cherry bomb that destroys your mouth, but in the most respectable manner. A hidden jewel in the temple that is the Belgian beer empire. This type of beer was always something foreign to me. Like a black girl. She may have beautiful features, but you think that there must be something different going on. You are hesitant to make a move. You remember what your friend once said...""they are spicy."" You wonder what the heck this spicy taste thing is all about, and keep your distance, but also keep a fixation. One day, you invite the girl back to your house, and finally kiss her. She tastes the same as everybody else, but you only let her give you a handjob in the end. This is Kasteel Rouge. A gem in disguise but only good enough for hand pleasure. I came. Something you keep around for a quick fix, but not the true love you desire. The sweet pleasure of those lips may get you through the night tonight, but there always comes another day. Keep this beer handy for those quick fixes though my friends."
"One overlooked aspect to this drink is that it is a MASSIVE HIT WITH THE LADIES. Again, this might disqualify it from consideration for beer graybeards-in-training. But if you want to rock your girl with a deceptive alcohol content and give her a drink that she will crave, and keep asking for more, then look no further than Kasteel Rouge. How well it masks the taste of rufies I don't know yet. But there is a significant chance that with Kasteel Rouge you won't need them at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty decent fruit beer. The malt provides a nice balance to the tart, sweet cherries. All of the flavors mesh quite well. The alcohol is noticeable, but adds warmth and body and doesn't take away from the flavor. The slight medicinal note is really the only off-putting part of this one and even then it's faint and almost negligible. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
" You would definately never guess the abv."
""

"On tap at Cheeky Monk in Denver. Pours dark amber with a short-lived white head and much lacing. Strong aroma is of cherries. Body is full and smooth. Taste is mostly sour cherry, caramel malt and candy sugar. Finish is long and sweet. This brew is too sweet for me."
""
"The color is red, bit darker then the usual capsuled Kriek, taste also a bit darker, less sweet but it misses the sour aspect. Overall, a nice red fruit beer, sweetness bit masked by the high alcohol (8%), definitely a nice alternative to a sweet red wine in the summer sun !"
""
"O- The cherry flavor is big and sweet and there are no other flavors to cut it down. There isn't any depth and it is a bit like drinking liquid candy. It was pretty hard to get through the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a dark ruby red with a two finger slight pink head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, fruit, and cherry cough syrup. The flavor was of sweet malt, big cherry, subtle cream, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The cherry coming off of this one in both the aroma and flavor were rather intense. On the aroma it seriously reminded of cherry cough syrup that I had when I was feeling bad as a child. However, this did taste MUCH better. There was a nice cream note going on to help balance out the cherry sweetness, but it was a case of too little too late. A very sweet finish to my day, but I could see this one opening up quite a few people to this style."
""
""
""
"O: This was so interesting! Much sweeter than I thought because it was described as a quad on the menu. I recommend you try it if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Has a nice deep red look to it and a good cherry smell. I was dissappointed in its lack of flavor depth. At 8% abv I feel it couldn't release some other nice flavors before it was overwhelmed by alcohol. I thought the carbonation was appropriate and had a somewhat light feel to an alcoholic beer."
""
""
"great beer. pours deep dark mahogany in color with a lasting quarter inch bubbly tan head into one of the coolest beer specific glasses ive ever seen. smells like cherry jolly ranchers, a bit artificial on the fruit front, very sugary, with plenty of red and caramel malts in there as well. flavor is also very jolly rancher-like, tart and sweet, tons of cherries. more of a jellied or candied cherry flavor than a fresh cherry, but it works well in this beer. the belgian yeast compliments it very nicely. mouthfeel is pretty solid, lots of carbonation and a somewhat bigger than medium body. not sure id drink these all night, but it was a nice beer to try once, especially on tap. the cherry in this is unlike the cherry in any other beer ive had. definitely check this one out."

"O: I was looking for a Gueuze or something similarly sour and this was what we ended up getting. The cherry flavor is really sweet and I think a little bit overdone. I can definitely taste the addition of cherry juice and its not a good thing. If the cherry flavor were dialed back a bit it would be better."

"Rather strong fruit beer with more depths and characters but itâ€™s still easy to drink anyway."

"Drinkability/overall- i actually did enjoy this beer but you have to know what you are getting into when you buy this beer it is straight up cherry desert beer, that being said its not cloying sweet and has nice enjoyable flavor, its a good beer that I would occasionally go to when looking for an after dinner desert kind of treat, though not hard to drink best split with someone"

"Poured from a 12oz short and stubby bottle. This pours a light to medium bodied cherry syrup red. It looks like cherry juice. If you put a glass of cherry juice right next to my glass now I would not be able to tell you which is the real thing. It smells like sweet cherry pie filling with little to no tartness. The flavor however is syrupy and medicinal and has a dusty, musty finish that is very offputting. It instantly makes this one unenjoyable and kills all likeability. It drinks light and sticky due to all of the sugar. Overall this is a medicinal sugar bomb that is not worth your time, especially being as pricey as it is. If you want cherries, go for a kriek."
"Pours a deep ruby red color with visible carbonation and a slight half finger head which is slightly pink. There is little to no lace left on the glass. The aroma is of cherries and raspberries. There is also a nice floral aroma to it. The taste is straigth cherries and raspberries. It is very sweet but appealing. The mouthfeel is lowly carbonated and sticky. Overall it is a nice beer it is very sweet but it is a very nice change of pace."

"Poured a 750 into two tulips. Very strong sweet maraschino cherry nose. Plenty of light carbonation and solid moutfeel. Cherry flavor is just right with not too much belgian yeast coming through. One of my favorite cherry style beers but not on par with New Glarus wisconsin belgian red."
"Smell and taste are cherrielike. The alcohol in it makes that you could call this a beer but it isn't. Mouthfeel is like drinking a cherry cola. Overall a very disappointing 'beer'."
"D - Best to split a bottle with someone as the sweet cough syrup part tends to be a bit much but it is tasty in small doses."
"O: decently drinkable because it's dry, but still difficult. Glad I didn't have the whole thing."
"Overall, this is an enjoyable brew that I will likely imbibe in time and time again. I've been known to tailgate with it...using the proper glassware."
"11.2 ounce bottle into tulip, bottle date: 071016. Pours hazy and cloudy reddish brown color with a small foamy off white head with fair retention that recuces to a thin lacing cap. Aromas of big fresh cherries, and cherry juice; with a bit of tartness and spices in there as well. Aromas are nice and strong, and what I was expecting from the bottle description. Taste of tons of cherries, cherry juice, tartness, cherry skin, and a bit of spices as well. No bitterness noticed; but there is a ton of cherry skin, tartness, and sweet notes lingering on the finish with a bit of spices as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. This drinks very smooth for the alcohol level, but is still quite a sipper due to big flavor and sweetness. No alcohol noticed other than a warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian cherry ale in my opinion, tons of flavor."
"O: too much alcohol, and i don't really like this kind of bitterness, not too sweet tough which isn't as evident for a cherry beer"
"A delicious cherry beer."
"Thats really it. Kind of a one dimensional beer, but in a decent way."
"I can read a bottle. I knew what I was getting into. Cherry flavor is pure, but this is not a beer you want to buy more than one of. A novelty at best."
"Overall: You have to appreciate the style to appreciate the beer. Russian River obviously have done well in this genre and therefore I tend to compare my Fruit beers to them. This one was good, not too offensive."
"D. apidimi of a sissy drink. No thank you. I like me beer tasting like beer."
"O: A real delight overall. You can keep the cherry pie, I'll just drink this for desert."
"O: Leaves you with a sweet, medicinal cherry taste."
"Won't say much as, while the beer wasn't bad at all, I didn't find much about it entirely remarkable. Entirely yeastless for a belgian, tons of cherry in the nose and taste. Maraschino cherries really have their powerful sweetness tucked in by a little tartness from a dark cherry flavor that I think composed about 1/3 of the taste and complexity of the beer. Really sweet with nice tart/sour notes to add some hit and complexity, tasty but nothing to write home about."
"D/O: This is ""dessert beer"" in every sense of the word. For those that say it's ""too sweet", I agree with you... if I was trying to have this with a steak. Or trying to sit down and have 3-4 of these with friends. But that's not what this beer is for. It's for dessert. It's to close out a night of moderate drinking on a sweet note. And for what it is? I think it's exceptional. My favorite fruit beer, with no close second to be found."
"O - It's been said Belgian people like their beer, specifically lambics, sweet and heavier on the fruit. In that case, this one fits right in and I'm confident that it's a hit over there. Unless you're an avid fan of cherries (I know a few people...) and don't mind a little (understatement) bit of syrupy sugar in the flavor, you'll love Kasteel Rouge. If not, don't bother with the $8.49 price tag on this beer. Instead, if you're lucky enough to live in Wisconsin, pick yourself up a Belgian Red from New Glarus for $1 less. Of course, chances are that if you're reading this, you already knew that."
"Dr: It's incredibly drinkable, has a high ABV that doesn't come through, and is very well priced."
"Overall--Dessert beer, to be sure. Great for once in a while, and a very good example of the style. Highly drinkable and satisfying."
"The beer pours a reddish-purple color with a small white head. The aroma is unmistakable. I get a ton of cherries with nothing else. While the aroma is one dimensional, the cherries are well done. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of sweet cherries and maybe a little bit of some caramel or toffee malt. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. If you like cherries, you may like this beer. If you don't like them, this is not the beer for you."
"Split this one with 2 friends on a broiling summer afternoon at a backyard BBQ. Pours reddish brown with a pink-hued head. Smell is all cherries and so is the taste. This is much closer to a black cherry soda than a beer. In fact it's almost hard to detect that it is a beer and the significant ABV is unnoticed. Moderate carbonation. Very sweet. Didn't get any medicinal/robitussin flavors at all. The flemish/sour brown ale underneath the fruit is barely detectable. A fun beer and the ladies seem to really like it as well. Gotta be in the mood for this kind of thing but a perfect dessert beer or sweet refresher. Halfway thru the glass I started munching a BBQ pulled pork sandwich and they went very well together."
"O - I'm not big on these beers normally, but I really enjoyed this one."
"There's a lot of great qualities about this beer, and almost as many not-so-great ones. In moderation, Kasteel Rouge is great. In large quantities, it's almost sickening, but you won't have a cold for weeks."
"It poured a slight kriek like beer. It had a large reddish white foaming head which dissipated very slowly. It smelled definetely of black cherries. It tasted like a fruit cake and cherry pie. A bit too sweet for me but it was a good beer. I didn't know it was a cherry beer when I bought it."
"Wife purchased this one on a whim and we tried it in a tulip glass. She didn't realize it was cherry flavor so she was a bit shocked at first. It was enjoyable and a nice change of pace from the standard Belgium and IPA styles that we have been having lately. I probably would not try it again anytime soon but it was good."
"T: very tart, cherry flavor that interacts through several waves of complex flavor. I wish I had a version without the cherry, to learn what the underlying Belgian style is. As presented, it's pretty much a lambic with a very nice cross-section of the fruit juice and beer."
"Overall Impression- Has a nice cherry taste but may be considered a cherry wine-cooler to some. I could down a bottle of this in no time and was hard not too! Easiest beer to drink I've had for a while. Interested in seeing what other people think of this beer. Grab more than one because they go fast!"
"Decently flavored, though I would bet the fruit in here is artificial. Fake cherries are fake tasting. Not that Iâ€™m complaining too much â€” I always did like the cherry JRs the most."
"Poured a reddish body with pink head that died slow on top of a mild aroma - all cherry. Mostly a cherry taste and passable, not too tart but there is a balance. Has a biting finish thanks to good carbonation. Other than just a light cherry tasting beer that is easy to drink there is not too much to write here; I found this an enjoyable desert beer and a good drink in its own right but this wouldn't be my first pick."
"The best fruit beer I've ever had. In addition, one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Medium body and carbonation with a crisp, clean finish."
"Of note: this is my wife's favorite beer, and I always keep 750s in stock."
"I think it deserves a second opinion at another time."
"(D)- This is an interesting fruit beer, but very sickly sweet and medicinal; I do not like being reminded of that sickly cough syrup from my childhood with each sip."
"O: Quality cherry beer. 4"
"Taste is strong, dark cherry, darkly toasted bread with hint of coffee grounds, porter, and burnt sugar. Thereâ€™s a faint tartness, exceedingly faint bitterness. Itâ€™s enjoyable and pleasant, with good body and character, but itâ€™s a bit one-dimensional and lacks complexity, the sweet-tart singed cherry predominating almost to the exclusion of all else."
"Had this one on tap this afternoon at The Wynkoop Brewing Company. Pours a nice reddish brown color with a very quickly dissipating head. Aromas of tart cherries and a little sourness. Light bodied, tart and crisp, with flavors of tart cherries and sweet malt."
"O - would like this more if the dark cherries weren't so over powering or sicky sweet. A little bit goes a long way. Would be a decent bottle to open up and share with a few people after dinner."
"Rouge is so sweet it is tough to finish by itself. I definitely recommend pairing this with some nice dark, chocolatey dessert. While I am not normally a fan of super strong carbonation, I think it was necessary in this beer to prevent a sickeningly syrupy mouthfeel as well as a sickeningly sweet flavor. If you're goal in life is to try every cherry-flavored thing on Earth, this is right up your alley. If not, it might be worth trying once..."
"Overall: Somewhat one-dimensional but still a tasty, easy to drink beer."
"Ending notes: I'm not sure if I got the bottom of the barrel, but this beer didn't taste like a beer at all. I was unimpressed despite the positive feedback I've heard while working in a liquor store. A good beer for girls that like Dr. Pepper. Eh.."
" ~ This is one of the best fruit beers I've ever had. I definitely recommend this beer to anyone who likes this style."
"The bitter finish leaves you wanting another gulp. But the beer gets too sweet in the long run. The balance and drinkability is better when the beer is cold; recommendation on the label says 6 degrees Celsius."
"D: i personally like anything cherry so this is a winner to me, overall easy drinker, but you must like cherry."
"Overall an extremely tasty Fruit Ale, although it is more like a Lambic than an ale. This is the perfect beer to enjoy at the end of the day with a nice creamy dessert."
"D: too sweet to be more than a 1-2 drink beer"
"Pours a deep muddy red with a thin pink head leaving little lacing behind. Aroma initially reminded me of cherry cough syrup as I was pouring it. After sitting for a touch, the smell of cherries is extremely pronounced but is intermingled with an interesting aroma of earthiness, maybe even a bit of leather. Strong initial sweetness leads to an interesting full cherry flavor. The sugars are pungently noticeable throughout, but almost more so in the finish. Very sweet indeed."
"drinks pretty well. very hard to believe it's 8% ABV. Not my favorite, but I can see it having its place and time and pairing rather well with dessert."
"Deep red-brown color with wispy head, not exactly what I was expecting. Nose is largely cherries, maybe a bit of acidity, little underlying malt. I went into this under the impression that it was a Flanders Red, but obviously I was mistaken, and a glance at the bottle confirms this. Flavor as a fruit beer is definitely fruity--sweet sticky cherries with maybe a hint of underlying yeastiness and a touch of malt to it. Unfortunately, I think the cherries border on medicinal... not terrible though. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy for what I would like, though nothing too remarkable. Drinkability of this beer was pretty impressive, I would have guessed 5% ABV at most. That was pretty cool, but I would pass this one up."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable and highly enjoyable Belgian fruit beer. While it's not a lambic, its flavors certainly bring that to mind. I could definitely see this beer appealing to non-beer drinkers. It's easily quaffed despite its 8% ABV. All in all, an enjoyable, non-challenging fruit beer."
"d - I thought this was a very good beer, but it is very sweet and dominated by cherries. I love cherries and like sweet beers so enjoyed it but I could see hwo this is too much for some people. If you're looking for a funkier or sour/tart cherry beer, this one is not for you; it's all sweet, no sour. Would have again."
"D: my brother and I split this 11.2oz bottle over lunch, and we were both content with leaving the ~6oz that remained on the table for the trash."
"Mouthfeel is very full and thick with little alcohol finish."
"This is the worst tasting beer I have ever had. Made with Sour Cherries?!?! Who had that bright idea. I guess if you like cherries, or cough syrup, this beer might be for you. On top of the horrid taste, it is a very low carbonated beer, making it even less appetizing."
"D-quite refreshing, but not sure I'd want to drink more than one."
"good, but perhaps a little too sweet to have more than a pint of this. Easy to find beer, but kinda expensive IMO. Would love to have this on tap, but 1 pint is more than enough in a sitting, unless you love sugary sweet beers."
"The beer pours a dark purple color with a thick frothy pink head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mildly tart cherry scent that's fruity as hell and quite refreshing. The taste is good as well. It has a wonderful cherry flavor that's refreshing and faintly tart. The yeast adds a good deal of character and the juice contributes a good deal of sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking fruit based beer. It has an elevated alcohol level that's well hidden and tremendous drinkability."
"D-mmm the taste does stay all the way through. i love the cherries so much. i could drink this one all night long!"
"Nose hard enough in cherry juice, low foam. It looks like a bit of a cherry cola. Fortunately, the mouth is not as laden with cherries as you might think. A bit of bitterness, acidity but a tad far from being truly compelling. We note, however, esters aftertaste ABV and very discreet. The real problem with this beer is that its creators have lost between two conceptions. Either take the side and make a fruity beer, certainly commercial, but fruity and sweet as desired. Either take the side of strong beer and produce a beer, fruity indeed, but the structure as strong as its larger counterparts. What a pity."
"An easy recommendation for those getting into Belgian beers or as a dessert pairing,"
"D - in summation this is incredibly sweet but also nice and fruity. Might be nice for a change but you wouldn't want to drink too many."
"You have to like over the top sweet cherry flovers to like this one, avoid it if cherry is a turnoff or if you have very had a bad Nyquil experience. ABV is hidden very well."
"Overall- An outstanding and readily accessible beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who wants a nice sweet nightcap/dessert. Very delicate and outstanding. Outside of Belgian Red which is impossible to find, this is my favorite dessert beer or beer similar to the Belgian Red style."
"d- a sipper, definately interesting though, would drink this again but probably not seek out to buy."
"D- Higher than expected. For a non-sour Belgian fruit beer, it's very enjoyable."
"Rouge has a pretty syrupy mouthfeel(medium bodied). It has a small carbonation to it and it's aftertaste lasts not that long."
"I'm not saying this beer is a great kriek, but for a Kasteel beer, it's actually not bad at all (i've had some disappointments with this brewery, but this brew is very ok)."
"D-very tasty brew with a huge cherry blast and very straight forward. the palate really sells this making it very creamy with huge cherry flavors. they don't try to do too much here, simple and enjoyable."
"D: Very good. Never would've guessed the ABV on this one - very well hidden. Goes down very easy."
"From the strong cherry nose, I was concerned this was going to be a complete bust of a beer. It ended up being a beer I probably won't purchase again, but I do appreciate it's craftsmanship and character. It could have come across like cherry cough syrup, but instead was more like a sour cherry soda with touches of beer. Be careful though...the higher alcohol is not that noticeable most of the time you are drinking it, so a few minutes after you finish the alcohol sneaks up and says hello!"
"Strong cherry flavor; deep sweetness and fresh and preserved fruit flavors both like a cherry wine with a head and like a liqueur without the medicinal syrup of a cheap kreik. An excellent alternative and boundary pusher; it made my wife very happy and allowed me to linger at Three Floyds long after our meals were finished. A little sweet and thick to be truly ""drinkable"" but also certainly worth a taste if you know what you are getting."
"All around good beer! Went well with bbq chicken; a little too much on its own to drink a lot of."
"drinkability: I had high expectations and it didnt deliver"
"I am not partial to fruit beers, as a rule, but this one hit my sweet spot, so to speak."
"D - Its a nice fruit beer. Not too too sweet, not too too artificial tasting. Would be nice though to have a bit more fresher taste and less artificial."
"D - Would be much better if the artificial flavor wasn't present. Still this beer is pretty decent. I would drink this again but don't see myself buying it again anytime soon."
"D - A very interesting beer. Lots of cherry flavor, goes great with dark chocolate. The 11.2oz bottle is a little too much though. Drinking it by itself the beer begins to lose its appeal and I couldn't follow it with a second one."
"D: This was a ridiculous drink that barely resembled beer. It hid the alcohol well, under all the sweetness. So if you like cherry taffy, this could be considered easy to drink. Too extreme for my tastes; I'd prefer a cherry Belgian beer with more complexity and balance."
"I initially had this on tap and it so impressed me that I went directly out and got a bottle of it to take to the wife. It's the cherry bomb beer in the best way I can imagine. It's color is dark red with just a hint of the Flemish brown beer underneath. Even the head is pink! The nose is cherry cherry cherry but not the chemical smell that others have mentioned. I smells more like a liquid cherry pie than anything else. The taste is again cherry, sweet and sour with the tang from the Flemish brown ale rounding things out. There is malt and fruit in lovely harmony. There is a full mouth feel with light carbonation. This is a dessert beer no doubt. It's smooth and fruity and yummy but a small snifter is all you need. A 750ml will easily satisfy 4-6 people along with a sliver of a dense chocolate torte. I keep a bottle on hand for just such an occasion."
"No idea what this like in a bottle. I have one waiting for the right moment."
"I was not a big fan of this. I was hoping for something more tart but this was extremely sweet and syrupy. Not something I'd try again."
"D- If you don't mind that it tastes more like a soft drink than beer than you might have a hard time putting this down. I, for one, will not discriminate as my sweet tooth prevails. I just wish I saved it for desert"
"First off, this came in one of the coolest goblets ever, with a representation of what I am assuming is the brewery molded into the long square stem. The beer itself was dark as black sweet cherries with a deep pink head that was very foamy and fizzy. The head eventually settled into a pink collar that left no lace at all. The aroma was incredibly fragrant and full of tart cherry deliciousness. I was hungry when I drank this and it actually made my mouth water. Though the smell was dominated by tart cherry, it was very sweet overall, and seemed a tad artificial, more like store bought cherry pie filling than my mom's homemade Michigan tart cherry pie. The flavor was quite well balanced with tons of sugary sweetness, but also a good amount of tartness to keep it from getting out of control. Rich tart cherry flavor ruled the day, but all that sweetness also produced juicy dark sweet cherry flavors that melded with brown sugar notes. I am starting to think this would be an amazing dessert beer. The body is medium, and it somehow manages to stay quite smooth even in the finish, with just a bit of stickiness. This was a surprise with all the sweetness it had going on. It had the perfect amount of carbonation, so perhaps that helped. Though this is a very well made beer, it is perhaps a bit sweet to be extremely drinkable, though compared to its contemporaries, it holds up pretty well in that department. I just realized this is an 8% beer, something I had no idea of when drinking it. I think I will have to raise the drinkability score. Chalk this one up as being surprisingly enjoyable."
"Sweetness is balanced a bit by some tartness and maybe a touch of sour. Cherries, raspberry jam and more cherries...tastes very much like pie filling. Alcohol is detectable but does not seem as high as 8%. Carbonation is low and the body is full. It seems like a little bit of dark malt is there if you really pay attention. This is a dessert beer of the highest order. Vanilla ice cream with a square of dark chocolate? Oh yea."
"Holy Cherries. This is a very fruity beer with strong cherry flavor, and ample cherry taste. I have had this beer both on tap and in an aged bottle and I think the beer in a bottle is better. The cherry sweetness subsides a bit over time, which marries better with the beer over time and allows for some complexity to come through without being overwhelming. It's good to have a small pour, but anything more than 8 or 10 ounces would be too much."
"Drinking this would be a cherry gig indeed! Ahem. Sorry. It pours a mostly clear ruby topped by over a finger of ecru foam that holds a slight pinkish tinge. The nose comprises more than a healthy contingent of cherries, chased by a slight medicinal quality. Something akin to Cherry Coke lies beneath this mass, but can't quite find the right words to express itself. The taste mirrors the smell, though the cough syrup is toned down a bit, allowing the cherries to explore a somewhat more sour path to enlightenment. Again, the Cherry Coke is there as well, possibly aged in some dry oak barrels (not enough to allow a lambic-style experience to blossom, but just enough to be vaguely recognizable). The body is a solid medium, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying finish. Overall, a solid fruity Belgian, though not necessarily one I would be able to contantly down."
"The sweet/tart cherry flavor was agreeable, though this beer absolutely causes beer fatigue; great for one, maybe two glasses, but then you want to move on..."
"D: Not my favourite. I can appreciate the flavors, but I won't be buying this again."
"I opened the bottle and right away I could smell the cherries.I poured the bottles (one for me and one for my wife) into pint glasses. There was a very nice head on both glasses. Although at this point the cherry aroma was very strong almost too strong. In the first two to three sips the cherry is very strong, but after that it was very nice as the beer warmed a little. Over all it was a very nice drink more like a cordial than a beer. This was my first experiance with this beer and I am looking forward to having another."
"D - This was my first fruit/veggie beer, and I didn't really know what to expect. Overall, it was good for one serving, but I wouldn't get another. By the end, it was just too sweet for me. The alcohol was well hidden, and I couldn't get a hint of it at all. It felt like I was drinking cranberry juice."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Not to heavy considering the sweetness. Hard to drink more than one but very easy to enjoy it. A fruit beer with 8% alcohol, definitely breaks some molds. Again i might like it more than most."
"D -- Overall, very drinkable. I thought this was a very good beer, worth a repurchase when an occasion arises. I know it's not the same style, but with the same basic flavor profile I find it more palatable than the lambics that I've had as it isn't nearly as sweet and has a complexity that those just don't match."
"Really drank like a soda and was refreshing, but didn't provide the punch or complexity that I look for in beers."
"This beer goes down like a cherry soda. I had it at Ebeneziers Pub on draft. Sweet beer but drinkable. The 8% alcohol is not noticeable. I have not had it in bottle yet-but soon it is in the fridge. It come sin a champagne like bottle. It cost around $9/bottle but you get a couple of servings in that."
"D- I go through this stuff like water in the desert and it's great at dessert also. Hard to pair with an entree but great for before and after."
"Notes: Lots of cherry flavor. I think it would make a good dessert beer (like their Brune). Slightly sweet, but nothing like the overly sweet lambics, and it has enough tart and sour flavors to give it more of a balance and more than one dimension. Seems somewhere between a sweet lambic and a Flemish Red. Good for a sweet and sour/tart cherry kick."
"The wife, who hates beer, liked this stuff. It goes for around $80/case here in eastern PA. Basically reminds me of the Frank's Cherry Wishniak I used to drink as a kid growing up in Philly. Carbonation is there, not too bad. Deep maroon color. Very hard to detect any alcohol. Unusual in that unlike many beers that I prefer a little warmer, this seemed best right outta the fridge. Best in the summer I would think."
"Overall, a nice fruit beer. Reminds me a lot of a poor man's New Glarus Belgian Red. It's overly sweet and cloying and needs more balance. I remember liking this a little more on tap."
"-Khillje"
"Ok, not bad at all. Still sweet...expected. But very decent. Good infact. Still a fruity beer that I wouldn't neccessarily buy...ever, but that's based on preference of style. But by itself, it doesn't need a Hoegarden to mask the sweetness like some other ""Lambics"". Again, lots of cherries, carbonation, and only slightly malty. Medium to light mouthfeel, yet sweet. Once again, not bad at all."
"Drinkability is limited due to the sweetness and the strength. A noble fruit beer."
"D- I could drink this guy all day. This is an easy drinker, not especially complex, but it sure does taste good."
"Overall a pleasant fruit beer. I'll drink it whenever it's around but I don't seek it out. Some friends and ladies I know love this though, and rightly so."
"Served in a casteel glass goblet style glass. Murky dark red/brown serving color with very little head. Big cherry smell right up front. Taste is mainly cherry, almost had a robitussin taste at times but I still found it very good. Mouthfeel is very nice with good overall carbonation. Drinkability was very high in my opinion. I had no idea it was an 8% abv until I just saw it on here. Feels like half that...maybe thats why I was so drunk having 2 of these after 2 dorado's. Nice offering and I am glad I ordered it."
"Pretty tasty, probably better fresh."
"Really, not what I was expecting."
"Opinion: Well, overall this is a pretty good beer. Cherry beers aren't really my favorite type of beer, but they are normally one of the better fruit beers. This one is more toward the ""foo-foo"" side of the spectrum and would probably be a decent one to convert some chick that ""doesn't like beer", but the Lindemans hold true as ""beer candy"". This one is a bit more like actual beer, but still a very bold fruit beer nonetheless. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer again, but I would almost certainly pick something else if a place was going to have a beer of this caliper on tap...they would almost certainly have something that I would want more. Either way, I would recommend that you give it a shot...preferably with a couple friends."
"Pours dark ruby with a good bubbly head that quickly goes away leaving a thin film of bubbles. Good carbonation. Nose smells like yummy cherries, the kind of nose you get from a cherry infused cider. Taste is at first a nice fermented cherry but quickly turns into an almost diet soda sweetness. As it breathes the diet soda-ness but still maintains a strong sugary taste. Doesn't really have any beer-like qualities."
"D- It's not a bad beer. This is the first Belgian fruit beer that wasn't a lambic that i've tried. If you're new to this kind of beer and looking to explore then give it a shot, but there are probably better Belgian fruit beers out there."
"Overall, didn't like this one that much the second time though. Scores okay marks for being better than a Lindemans with a more interesting and complex flavor but very much too sweet in the end."
"D - Personally, I wouldnt drink it again because this is too fruity for guys. Definitely a ladies drink."
"Drinkability was pretty high, which surprised me. It could have been the occasion, as I was tired and thirsty from walking around all day on a nice fall day, no sun, t-shirt and jeans, light breeze, but this went down in a hurry, and if my wife afforded me the time, I would have enjoyed another no problem. Very smooth, dangerous ABV, perhaps the best pure fruit beer out there."
"D: A good after dinner drink, not as complex as say a cherry lambic, but the cleanness of the flavor is great and the alcohol level in this beer gives it a nice kick."
"Gorgeous!! Without being heavy or cloying - fresh, dark cherries and gentle carbonation dance around my mouth in a feat that few other than the Belgians can accomplish and with a flavor that is both singular and complex. I love beer that redefines beer and this beer tosses your beliefs into a vat of cherries."
"Notes - This is a fruit beer that is full of fruit smell and flavor. If you are looking for a real fruit beer experience and not just a beer with a subtle aroma of fruit then this one is a good choice."
"Love Kasteel but do not like this particular one. Must admit this is not my style of beer but I just think it is too fake cherry tasting."
"Insanely drinkable, no hint of alcohol, this is such an easy beer to drink"
"D - Average-plus. Would be better if not for the cough syrup aspect."
"Procured @ Red Carpet Wine & Liquor"
"750ml corked & caged. Healthy cork pop, looks more like wine than beer. Dark ruby red with a quickly dissipating off-white pinkish head and no lacing. Smells of grapes, cherries, and other fruity goodness. It makes my inner child smile. Tastes of cherries, burnt oak, leather, and a slight ashy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice, slippery and bubbly. Drinkability is good, there is no real alcohol to it (despite its abv). I like it. Different, sweet but not overly so. A fruit beer for those that don't like fruit beers I'd say. Ironic as fruit beers are beers for those that don't like beer, but who am I to spit in the eye of a good cliche'?"
"This is an interesting brew. Kasteel Rouge is definitely in the realm of sweet fruit beers. I generally prefer my fruit beers on the drier side. This brew is still quite enjoyable, and is highly drinkable to boot."
"A bit to syrupy sweet for my taste but it's not a bad beer and worth a try if your into the fruit like beers."
"D - I'm trying to give this brew the benefit of the doubt. But it seems terribly one-sided to me. I want to taste more than cherry juice when I drink a beer brewed with cherries. I can imagine that it would pair decently well with a duck pate or a rich chocolate cake, but a beer can't rely on food pairings to make it palatable. Pretty disappointing."
"11.2oz bottle served in a tulip. Poured a deep mahogany with a pinkish-tan, half inch, loose head that eventually dissipates into a skim and a thick band around the edges. Nose was cherry Sucrets. Taste consistent with nose - exactly what liquid sucrets would taste like - sweet and tart cherries as well as medicinal notes in the mix. Mouthfeel is between light and medium-bodied and sparklingly effervescent with a fairly dry finish. I like this brew, especially on tap, but I can only have one in a sitting. Nice to have once in a while though when the mood strikes."
"D - Not sure I would drink a bunch glad I tried it was not bad for this style either."
"The taste is reminiscent of cherry pie filling. Sweet and tart cherry fill the palate. Again, really in your face. It does have a some what artificial taste lingering in the after taste. Very easy to drink although it is incredibly sweet for my palate. Any of my female suitors would love this beer."
"I love cherries with a passion and want to give this beer a super high score, but it focuses on cherries almost to the exclusion of everything else."
"Looks dark red, had about an inch head on it, the smell was very very cherry, it worried me for a sec but one sip put a smile on my face, they got it right! The beer has a little tartness to it and is far from too sweet, it actually tastes like some delicious cherries, not the syrup flavor other beers have. Good carbonation,this beer beer went down easy but I can't say I'd go back for more any time soon. Still, if I were to have another cherry beer, this one would come to mind!"
"Drinkability : sweet commercial krieks (too ABV), I prefer traditional Krieks."
"D - This was a pretty short review...but there's nothing else to really say about this beer except for the cherries...not much ""beer"" flavor...great to end dinner with"
"Off the tap at The Daily Planet this beer was a deep ruby color with a garnet meniscus. The one-finger of tan head retained as a thin collar and decent lacing. The aroma was very sweet and punchy like cherry cough syrup blended with brandy reminiscent of a kir. The flavors were equally sweet and alcoholic, candy sugar, tart cherries, currants, candied nuts a touch of wood and bitterness plus lots of alcohol heat. Cloying and acidic. The mouthfeel was a touch slick but smooth, the body medium and the carbonation good. The flavor combination was pretty good but it could only be enjoyed strictly as a dessert and I would not order more than one."
"an interesting beer, but not one i'd be rushing out for."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer. Not sure of it as a session brew due to the sweet/sour component, but I would have it again, especially on a hot summer day."
"Very drinkable fruit beer."
"In close I am glad I tried this beer. I have a real sweet tooth and this is definatly satisfying it. It may not be the worlds most complex beer, but it's not trying to be. It's just a good easy drinking beer thats perfect for summer. So drink up my fellow sultans of sweet!"
"D: Yeah, it's kind of girly. But you'd be hard-pressed to find a better dessert beer or a better gateway beer for someone with a sweet tooth."
"Overall Impression: A cherry-flavor beverage. The only downside, really, is that it tastes more like a Mike's Hard Cherry-aid than a Belgian beer. Regardless, it's tasty. I feel rather guilty for rating it so high when it's been so heavily de-'beer'ed, but eh... it's good."
"I would happily pair this with a pepper encrusted venison tenderloin with a merlot reduction, or duck with a cherry sauce."
"The beer felt light, smooth and was fairly easy to drink. It has a very bitter aftertaste, but not off-putting. It was dry and had no real carbonation to speak of. For the style, not the best but not the worst either. Perhaps the beer would have worked better after dinner."
"Wow! Another bsolutely great Kasteel beer! I first tasted this one in some bar in Amsterdam a few months ago and I was absolutely impressed. I found a place to buy a bottle and have it home. Served in a Kasteel glass. Very beautiful cherry red colour, with wonderful ruby reflections when hold it to the light. Pinky creamy foam, like a cherrie ice cream, that last just for a second. Smells of cherries, marzipan, apple pie, bitter almonds or Amaretto. A like brandy flavor, tastes of cherries, vanilla, apricot, acid notes from the cherries, but is also sweet, nice balanced, and I find even some pepper. Really great, but of course, you can't drink many of them in the same night..."
"Mouthfeel & drinkability - Medium bodied mouthfeel...almost creamy on the palate. Finishes fairly crisp with a strong cherry aftertaste. I can taste a small bit of alcohol but not what I expected with the 8% ABV. Overall, this is a very solid brew...one I will be recommending to all of my friends that enjoy this brewing style."
"Good stuff, especially considering a Lindemans is approximately the same price for a small bottle as this was for a 750ml."
"D - To me this was one delicious beer one that I could drink for dessert or drink with a slice of cheesecake one of the best fruit beers that I've had worth trying"
"Definitely not an opener, but can be a memorable closing beer for those with the taste for it."
"This brew pours a mostly brown color, with ruby red highlights (especially when held to the light). The head is an interesting pinkish color, without great staying-power. The smell is very good. Lots of cherry flavor in the aroma (dominating, actually), with also a little malt and alcohol underneath. Ripe, black cherry aromas are central, though. The taste is reminiscent of black cherry soda, although not artificial. It's mildly sweet, with a nice tang and slightly sour note. Not at all like a fruit lambic, yet just a bit sour. The sourness does a great job providing some balance to the beer, which could easily become too fruity without it. Malt is present in the flavor as well. No hop character at all. Although it was in the aroma, there is basically no alcohol in the flavor. Fairly full in body, especially for a fruit beer. Great, lingering finish with lots of cherry."
"What is this? Nothing I will ever drink again. On occasion I like a good fruit beer, but this tastes like artificial cherries. I will probably end up poring the rest out."
"Drinkability: For a fruit beer, this is awesome. While it tastes cherry, it still feels like beer. I will certainly seek this one out again."
"Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck hasn't failed me yet. Kasteel Rouge is a fantastic choice if you like sweet fruit beer that is also deep, rich and complex. This brew is a more than pleasant surprise and is a repeat purchase for sure."
"this is very sweet, and I could drink this all day...except there are better beers for me to waste my time with."
"Overall- Too fruity, too much like red wine."
"Pours a hazy, dark maroon color. 1/4 inch head of a purple color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of cherries and the slightest sweet malt aroma. Fits the style of a Fruit/Vegetable Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp. There's an average carbonation level and a strong tartness. Tastes of cherry first, then a strong cider flavor, and a very tart finish. My girlfriend swears by this brew, but it's nothing special by my standards. I'm not a huge fruit beer fan, but this was drinkable."
"Overall, I thought this was a great ""fruit/vegetable"" beer and it was quite refreshing. Looking forward to my next one!"
"D- The drinkability really saves this brew. It made it much easier to get down despite the taste."
"Medium bodied, somewhat syruppy, more of a dessert or after dinner brew. You could even pour this over ice cream or make a sorbet."
"D: The best cough syrup I've had, but nothing all that inspiring."
"I thought this one was pretty damn good. Of course there are better versions out there but this is a solid choice since it's cheaper than many of the others."
"It's all cherry. Don't let the description fool you. There isn't much malt or hops or yeast to e found in this one. Still it's a cool switch from the everyday!"
"I found the description a little disingenuous. Instead of Belgian Ale with cherry juice added I think it comes across as sour cherry juice with a splash of Belgian Ale. I've had several other Belgian+Cherry combos and none were this fruity. More like a lambic, really. I almost poured it out but I'm saving it to possibly use as a sauce, maybe for pork chops."
"Poured this deep, rich cherry colored beer into a pint glass. It gave off a pinkish foam as it first was poured and kept a lingerance of lacing. The smell of the beer was that of cherries and malts. The taste followed with the aroma yet with notes of spices. Overall an excellent beer that just has a nice palate of flavors to enjoy while sitting down and sipping a beer."
"This beer was not for me, way to much cherry flavor and it needed to be toned down."
"Drinkability: A bit simple with it's delivery of just cherries and jolting sweetness. Me, I'd sooner reach for something a bit more graceful, like New Glarus Belgian Red. Still though, I found it reasonably enjoyable, but I could see many people considering this to be outright cloying."
"Small sparkly pink head. Well carbonated. Color is reminiscent of blood oranges. Strong aroma of sweet cherries and cinnamon. Starts sweet and tart, cherry is front and center. Medium body. Cherry flavor doninates throughout, ultimately more on the sweet than tart side. Finish is dry, alcohol is present but not too strong. Good sweet contrast to the tartness of the NG Belgian Red."
"Drinkable, but not overly pleasant."
"Overall I think people might enjoy this if they're a big fan of fruit beers, but again, I can't handle it. Caveat Emptor."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is a little too prickly. Drinkability is decent but cherry flavor could be a little over bearing after a while. Pretty good representation of a fruit beer."
"D: While I don't drink fruit beers that often, this is one of the better examples of one. This would be a good summer beer. Easy to drink and refreshing."
"Pours an opaque, strongly reddish mahogany with a fine-bubbled pinkish head. Scent of cherries dominates the the malty aroma. Flavor is almost too sweet, mainly cherry with an undertone of malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and pleasing, and aftertaste is mainly sweet but not cloying with hints of hops."
"Again, it's not very complex, but sometimes it doesn't need to be to be very good. I enjoyed this one thoroughly though drinking an entire bottle of this might be a task with the overpowering sweetness."
"Nice stuff. Good balance between the cherry tartness and sweet notes and both the body and especially the drinkbility were great. This was a nice one for the wife and I to split."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability - Both are very good particularly considering the sweetness due to the high tart acidity."
"D: I am not big fan of fruity brews, but this one grew on me. As it warms in your glass it warms to the palette. Not a bad beer and if you like cherries you'll really like this one, but give her a try nonetheless."
"Got a bottle of this at the company holiday party. Was basically what I expected - a maroon beer with a weak head that smells and tastes like what it is: cherry syrup. There's a little bit of a beer flavor in the taste (not so much in the nose, which is really just sweet, almost cough syrup cherry), with some sourness that's fairly interesting. Body's fine, and the carbonation's fairly appropriate. It's not really my style, but it's not garbage by any means. Probably couldn't have more than one though."
"D_Hard to drink too many of because of the intense flavor and high carbonation"
"Tastes very good--the lack of complexity (and beeriness) is a little more present and is slightly detrimental, too. Tastes like super duper cherries. Tastes like a Luden's cough drop. This--goddamnit this is like the Leinenkugel's Nut Brown shit, where it tastes so good it's almost like it's cheating since there's obviously been something added to this that's not beerish enough. I'm more apt to trust Kasteel than Miller, though, so I'll give these guys the benefit of the doubt and assume this is real cherries, and not Xylatol614 or whatever."
"mouthfeel is crisp, sweet, very drinkable - overall nice for desert.. but i likely wouldn't buy again."
"D - This is an interesting beer. Very sweet and very sharp."
"check it out, i dug it"
"edit: next morning....okay the whole review is right one except for the pregnant lady part...I swear it made sense at the time, but now I don't quite see what I was getting at, almost but not quite."
"On tap at Madison WI's Malt House. Bold and rich cherry red body with pinkish head. Tons of cherry in the aroma and flavor. My first impression of the taste was artificial cherry, lending almost a medicinal tinge. A second sip (and each subsequent) proved just how wrong my first impression was. Full-on cherry enveloped my taste buds and at 8.00%, provided a dangerous beer to session. If not for the sweetness, I could drink this all night. I love the bitter, burnt flavors in many other styles, but this is just such a unique experience for any beer lover. Superb fruit beer."
"I am not a big lambic or sour fan, but this beer defintely scores well with me. There is a good cherry taste without being tangy or overbearing. This beer is a good mix for someone like me, who loves malty thick beers and my wife who hates beer, but loved this offering and is now tasting everything I bring home."
"Short and stubby Belgian style bottle, pours rich reddish amber, cough syrup style. Pungent cherry nose, quickly departing red hued head and then leaving next to no lace. Sweet, sour, tart, pleasantly fruity, with notes of cherry, raspberry, cough syrup. Layers of dense, pungent and intense fruit. Nice stuff. Well worth a try. Would be nice with a chocolate and/or fruity dessert."
"Not much to this Belgian. The High Alcohol contnet at times seems to overpower this beer and can taste a bit like NyQuill. Takes me back to my younger years when sneaking a bit of NyQuill was quite the night out. It forms well in the mouth and is easy to drink if the alcohol doesn't bother you. The smell is strong and pungent and rather pleasing. Overall this is not a bad beer, but then again, nothing special either."
"This was an expensive beer in a short bottle. But worth it if you like fruity beer. A lot better than Warrants ""Shes my cherry pie, cool drink of water what a sweet suprise."""
"Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable fruit beer. I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these in a night, but I'd definetly throw this beer my rotational fruit beer catalog!"
"Please let me know what you think of the review. As I said, it is my first and I want to improve upon this skill. Thanks a lot!"
"A big strong sour tart cherry taste,very desert-like. Doesn't remind me of beer,yet not offensive,i kind of like it. Sweet sugary upfront with the sour tart cherry taste midway and through the finish with a sweet tart taste lingering. Not syrupy like a lot of fruit beers,has a slight doughy yeasty taste to it, has a bit of a champagne like mouthfeel.Goes down easily the alcohol is pretty well hidden with a very slight touch of heat. Not a beer i could drink more than a couple of,but does go down quite easily. More like a desert beer. If you like cherrie this is the beer for you. Lots of cherry to this beer,yet not to overpowering."
"Wisconsin Belgian Red is significantly superior, if you like a tart taste to balance. If you want unabashed sweetness, this one is for you."
"Higher alcohol than I presumed. DELICIOUS, a candy beer so it's hard to give it great ratings within the style but its enjoyable."
"A good beer, but not one I'll be looking to purchase again anytime soon."
"I'm glad I tried this beer on draft, but will probably not revisit again... unless of course my girlfriend orders it and can't finish it herself!!!"
"Carbonated red with white lacing and head. Smells and tastes like the aforementioned cherry cough syrup, but sweeter and more appealing. Not too strong, but the fruity flavor is a little too much for me to consider too drinkable. Interesting, but not something I enjoyed too much."
"Finish is,,,, hard to finish a whole bottle. Small amounts are better to share with freinds in little tasting glasses. NOT a session beer whatsoever, but a after dinner sipper. Maybe on a day that looks like the town on the bottles picture, a smoggy dark dreary night."
"D: Carbonation helped with the drinkability as well but I'm glad I shared this bottle amongst friends rather than drinking the whole thing."
"Light effervescence, smooth, medium full body. A dessert beer for certain, but a fine one."
"rating #1000 at Ratebeer... wow, this is wonderful stuff... delightfully fruity and clean, with loads of cherries!! .. light purple-red colour .. good lacing .. one of the nicest most enjoyable beers in existence!! .. bottle was Kasteel Rouge, same as Kasteel Kriek..."
"i also have enjoyed doing a black and tan of sorts with this beer. mixing it with old rasputin imperial stout, floating it. its not an easy task. i call it THE AMBER SPIDER. its amazing like eating a chocolate covered cherry. the combination of the two beers also creates a really nice head on the rasputin. makes it a bit more creamy. i had two last night!"
"Pours a deep amber red color with a pink head. Aromas of sour dark cherries, right in their prime. In the taste, dark cherry, a small sourness and well a bit surypy, almost medicinal. Aftertaste of a small cherry and a coating in the mouth. Not too sweet, nice alcohol and deffinatly not a girly beer!"
"D: Ok combination of mouthfeel and taste made this decently drinkable. The robitussin taste got to me later on in the beer which made it less appealing to me."
"Burgundy colored ale with a pink head that rapidly fades away.Smell is cherries.Taste is sour cherry and malt.This is not a beer you would be drinking during a Sunday football game or while mowing your lawn.I will say this is good but give me an ice cold Budweiser anyday over this!!"
"I would describe this as a lambic wannabe. Overall, I'd say it's one dimensional. It is tasty and decently priced ($9 for 25.4 oz.)."
"Brasserie V tonight. very delicious. slightly sweet, a little too sweet to be a super session beer. but very flavorful, very stong cherry flavor and definitely nice solid malt cackbone to it all around. formed a good beer and my non Beer Geek friend found it his favorite new session beer, although lindemans (too sweet for me) was his favorite before hand."
"Really crisp and zingy, Kasteel Rouge is plenty tasty with a zip of carbonation and no indication of the abv. The tang of the drink limits the drinkability a bit for me."
"D- I do love this beer, but in moderation. One beer this sweet is enough for me...on to something hoppy!"
"Bottle courtesy of secret santa: Poured a deep red color ale with a light pink color head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of syrupy cherry with too much of sweet cloying notes. Taste is also dominated by the extremely sweet cherry syrup with some very light malt notes. Full cloying sweet body with some average carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Too sweet for my taste buds and too much of the fake cherry syrup comes out for me to enjoy this beer."
"This would be a great dessert beer. Perfect to have with some vanilla ice cream, maybe even make beer floats with this."
"Alcohol very well hidden. A nice little diversion, but honestly, this should have been a taster sized serving."
"a real rich dark red, from the moment i opened the bottle the room filed with cherries, my mouth was wattering at just the smell, it was love at first sip, this one is like a less sweet cherry soda with a slight belgan beer aftertaste, this one could pass as fine wine. as far as cherry beer goes i think this one is top dog for me so far beating out lindamins, next time i will buy more than just the 11.2 oz that i got, if you like cherry beer this one is for you!"
"One of the more distinct and impressive beers I've had in some time, better than a straight-up Lambic, while nearly as sweet and more complex. Excellent."
"I am a big fan of the flavored/fruit beers, some are good while some make the attempt but tragically fail. This is the latter. From the crimson clear color, looking at this through a glass almost looks like peering through a liquid filled ruby with tons of little bubbles for your enjoyment. The rose white head appears fast but lingers for a slow dissolve showing that there are definately cherries in the mix. Sour cherries fill the air with hints of malt and oak adding to the desire of the mix. With the first taste you get blasted with the sweetness of the cherries that slowly turns a sour edge. The thin crispness and high carbonation fill your mouth making a smooth feel that ends in a bitterness that is quite enjoyable. Overall this beer is great, form the mid range ABV to the flavor it proved it's self, to me, at least it would be a great beer to pop open and have with desert."
"Poured into a tulip from bottle. Deep red with a off white pink head that lowers quick on a gentle pour. Nice steady ring around the glass edge contrasting the redish brown brew. Good carbonation from appearance, the D at the bottle of the duvel glass is constantly providing an escape of bubbles and creating a white circle in the center. Smell is totally cherry with some brown ale undertones. Very sweet taste up front, slightly bitter in the back, carbonation is good on the tongue, the cherry isn't really in your face in taste. Not really medicine like a lot of these styles can be. Not a bad cherry."
"The finish is again very sweet, long lasting, and sticking very much to the tongue and palate. I found this unpalatably sweet and way too close to drinking cherry cough syrup (at the risk of repeating myself). To its credit, the alcohol was hidden pretty well."
"Available on tap and bottled at Capone's. Initially tried in a sampler set with some pretty heavy duty stouts and IPAs, in which setting it proved to be a quite tasty refreshing cherry beer. It wasn't until several days later when I was drinking the bottle I picked up that I realized what was wrong with it: while being good it more closely resembled carbonated cherry juice rather than of a beer. Very good cherry juice to say the least, nice sweet smell, never cloyed, slightly syrupy but with more than enough carbonation to compensate, but still... I would highly recommend this beer in small quantities as a quick refresher in between tasting some deep stouts or porters, but never in quantity and NEVER as a standalone bottle."
"Years ago, this was my first authentic Belgian. I aged this bottle, just under a year, and found the trial aided the aroma, at the expense of the flavor. Not a bad trade, but worth making note."
"RJR"
"Pours a two finger pink head that fades to a ring and leaving traces of lace. Deep red color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet cherry nose. Flavor is sweet maraschino cherries with a sweet & sour cherry finish. Higher ABV is hidden. $4.39 for a 330ml bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"It is what it is... A sweet cherry ale that tastes great. I doubt I could drink this all night but it is a good brew and one that I will be buying again.."
"Well it pours very red with a pink head. Nose is like candied sugar. Flavor is like liquified cherry Jolly Ranchers. It's just sweet. Bloody sweet. Feel is fine. Nice carbonation with a good liquid feel. It's easy to drink, but it's just reeeeal sweet. Like I said: liquified Jolly Rancher."
"Brew arrived in a very classey Kasteel glass. I like the little house structure at the base of the glass. Very neat. Dark red color with a little bit of a red head. Smell was of cherries, and booze. Almost tastes like cherry coke with a shot of alcohol in it, very simple beer. Mouthfeel was decent, medium carbonation. Took me a while to finish but that's ok. I would order again."
"I can't really recommend this brew, it tastes like cough syrup with a hint of beer."
"Pours a deep bight crimson/scarlet when held to light,the head is a nice pink panther color,this looks very nice.The nose is cherry cola and yeasty.Sweet fresh cherries upfront and throughout,reminds me of Jollyrancher tartness,nice maltieness midway keeps it interesting and distracts from the cherry.The mouthfeel is soft and spritzy,not syrupy or sticky at all it's very good considering cherry syrup is added I belive.A great Belgian offering,quality."
"This beer is all about the cherries. It pours a nice ruby color with some head and minimal lacing. The smell ... you guessed it, cherries. The taste is basically a flatish cherry cola with some tartness and a slight sweet malty background that appears in the finish. The two endearing qualities to this beer are its refreshing crispness and the very well masked over 8% ABV. I was hoping for more of a Flemish Red experience, and instead I got a slightly artificial cherry experience that isn't bad, but one I'm not keen on returning too either. As the beer begins to settle, I'm getting more of a cherry cough syrup taste that is not all that nice. As one reviewer said, this would be a nice after dinner dessert beer in place of a sweet wine. Okay, I'll go with that, but drink it before it gets too cough syrupy."
"Pours a dark reddish color, some carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, minimally sticky lacing around the edge. The nose is a sweet/sour cherry, and some malts. The taste is sweet/sour from the cheeries, slight malts. Medium body, easy drinking for a 8% ABV brew for sure. Drinkable, my first from this brewery."
"Pours like a dark red cranberry juice out of the box. Smells of a dark cherry with the seed still left in! A slight bit of tart off the cherries comes out as well. The palate is significantly tart, with the cherries tasting as if they were put on an ice cream sundae at Walmart. The sweetness feels quite a bit artificial, not natural. Not bad, but the palate wained a little bit comparing to the nose!"
"D - This tasty Belgian ale has a superb cherry vibe. It's sweet, tart and sour... and extremely drinkable."
"D-Very nice cherry beer with a nice amount of flavour that does not go over the top. This is a very nice apertif beverage."
"Usually I am not a big fan of fruitbeers, but this has nothing to do with an artisinal beer, it is sugar-free soda with beer."
"The strong cherry flavor hits you first and then there's that tartness and a little bit of tingle after the swallow. I didn't notice too much carbonation, but then again I've been nursing this one for an hour or so. Man, that's good..."
"On tap, no head on pour when it reached me. Dark brown, tawny highlights. Smell's intense, almost, but not quite, medicinal. Taste is more on the sweet side than the tart side, and the mouthfeel is a bith thin. Despite this, I prefer this cherry blend to its closest counterpart, 3 Philosophers. I enjoyed it, and picked up a few bottles the next day."
"D: something nice to have every once in a while or with dessert, not something I would sit back and drink all night long"
"Notes: I would love to have the ""Brown Ale"" that this is based off of. This beer (the brown ale with cherries added) is excellent."
"Drinkability is modest. Kasteel Rouge makes a fine desert beer and one chalice goes down nicely. Then again, I'm not sure I would want to drink too many of these."
"D - This is a great desert beer to be savored on a full stomach. It's rich and sugary and that kills any sort of session potential, but as a decadent treat it's outstanding."
"D= Again, a pleasing beer for the occasion, but one is suitable."
"This beer poured a clear very dark cherry red color and formed a small very pink bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbon is present. An aroma of cherries, cherry pie, cherry cough syrup, etc. The flavor was of cherry, some woodiness and oddly, just a hint of carmel or maybe chocolate masked by the cherry. The body is medium light and the finish is tart. A nice beer from a pretty consistant brewer."
"Verdict: I'd be lying if I didn't say that I loved this beer. It would definitely make a good dessert beer, depending on the dessert entree. I've never rated anything in the category it's in that high but I have to give this high marks for what it is. Feel free to disagree."
"Not very complex and kind of disappointing, but not a terrible beer either. I just had higher expectations."
"Light-bodied and a tad boozy as it progresses. Becomes more like a spiked cherry cough drop as it goes on. I can't see drinking much of this, but it's fine for what it claims to be. It's no lambic, but it's better than many fruit wheat beers I've had."
"D: An interesting concoction, actually tastes more like a cocktail than a beer, like a fruity mixed drink that Conan likes, but I really didn't want more than one in the end."
"Definitely not one of my preferred beer styles, but I still say that this is a well done beer. Not as deep in cherry flavor as New Glarus' belgian red, but slightly more beer like (which I actually prefer more). Still, I can't see many occasions when I would want to drink another of these but if you're into cherries, or different styles of beer, you owe to yourself to try this at least once."
"I usually enjoy big full bodied malty sweet beers. This one has some good qualities but just doesn't quite hit the spot for me."
"Beautiful cherry red, and perfect cherry in nose that wafts cherry a few feet,cherry lace. Medium mouthfeel with high carbonation, this one is fresh. Tasty,a bit of woodiness, not too tart.Second to New Belgium in authentic and complete taste. Solid real and unique."
"D - I believe Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck N.V. tried to make black cherry soda into a beer. Great success! Very drinkable and refreshing!"
"D - hmm overall I like the flavor of this beer but the tartness is just becoming too much. I drink this without any food and I think that on the whole that this is a beer that should only be drank with food. It would also make a good reduction sauce since it is rather flavorful. I think it would go well with a duck or a pork on the whole. Def on that needs paired though and would not really want to drink one alone again."
"Pours a dark red cough syrup/beet juice color with a light gray-pink head. The aroma is clean, sugary cherry juice. There's a hint of vanilla-spicy stuff in the background, but it's a reach; this is a very simple, straightforward aroma. On the palate, initially a touch bitter with a cherry underpinning that's only slightly tart. Cherry sweetness comes on around the mid-palate, then dries out a touch, leaving some unpleasant bitter, woody tastes behind at the finish. There's an underlying sweetness and juicyness that is in-line with the note on the bottle saying that plain cherry juice is added to this beer. Mouthfeel is an odd blend of beer-smooth and juice-smooth, with only a slight bit of carbonation. Overall, there's not much to recommend this. It's fruitiness lacks complexity, and perhaps due to the fruit juice addition, there's little beer character that actually shows through."
"Pours burgundy with a purple tinged head that has some decent inital head but that fades pretty quickly to settle to a ring. Deep, deep aromas of cherry and Cherry Heering with a background smell of cough syrup. Some slightly sour winey smells on the very tail end. Tastes somewhat like cherrry cough syrup as well, but with a pleasant bitterness that runs through it and saves the day somewhat. A touch of fresh cherry flavor floats above the more medicinal taste. Mouthfeel is super sweet, and that combined with the low carbonation level makes this a bit of a chore to drink. Not balanced or subtle at all, and extreme in all the wrong directions."
"Drinkability: Very high. Surprising complexity for such a sweet fruit beer, which is a good thing. The high ABV may limit what you would want, but a very good example within the style."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with vinuous notes and standout wild cherries that linger to a sweet, cupcake finish."
"Not overly thick which is a relief because excessive body in fruit beers can sometimes translate as syrupy-ness. I don't know that I could drink another of these but it certainly was worthwhile."
"Reviewer notes... I rating this brew based soley on its merits as a fruit beer NOT a Belgian beer."
"This is definitely way too easy drinking, not so sweet that it becomes cloying this beer just disappears from my glass. Very simplistic in its one dimensional cherry character, but still certainly enjoyable if you like cherries; I certainly had no problem consuming my 330ml bottle of this."
"The flavor was incredible. I expected something like a lembic, but the cherry flavor was perfect and not that sweet at all. This is a good pre-dinner drink. I think the flavor might be a little too much to have with a meal."
"Drinks fairly easy, might get old after a while due to the sweetness & dryness, but this worked for me & my wife dug it too"
"Stubby bottle pours a clear ruby body with a small and fleeting pink head. Speckles of lace cling to the sides of the goblet. Aroma is sweet black cherries and some earthy yeast. Light medium body has a restrained carbonation. Taste is sweet and tart cherry, almost candy-like. The cherry overwhelms the subdued malt and hops presence. The 8% abv is not noticed. If you like sweet and tart cherries you will enjoy this one."
"Something I picked for me and the wife to enjoy today and I have to say I really impressed with this cherry infused beer.Poured into a small tulip glass a mauve maroon color with a large blooming pink head that clung nicely to the glass as it settled slowly.Wow the mix of sweet and tart is almost candy-like well like a sweet tart,neither overpowers the other.A dessert beer to behold but not wimpy afterall it is 8%alc. but the candied sweetness along with somewaht lactic tartness in the finish just makes you wanna drink more its almost addicting.Fruit infused beers when done right are awesome and this along with Founders Rubeus may be my two favorite,take it for what it is and you will thoroughly enjoy it."
"A bit sour, but not too bad."
"Note: Not nearly as good from a bottle!"
"Kastell Rouge pours a deep, dark cherry red with a minimal ring of pink head circleing the glass from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. I really like the smell, they nailed black cherry. The taste is nice too, it has a nice cherry flavor, tart and sour balanced nicely with sweet. Definitely not cloying or medicinal which could easily happen. This isn't something I would drink often, but frankly I think it's quite enjoyable."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, I have my reservations any time I hear the word ""cherry"" in a description of a beer, but this one is pretty good."
"Finish is a little sticky sweet and cola like."
"Ample carbonation and a nice smooth mouthfeel make this beer very drinkable. I had no idea what the ABV was when I tried it. I didn't notice the alcohol until long after the beer was gone. It was very good and very drinkable. I could have easily spent the night drinking nothing but this beer."
"The beer pours a deep black cherry color, the head creamy and reddish purple in color, the size modest, as it depletes, and the lace forms a thin but concealing sheet. Nose is steeped in sweet ripe cherries, with a nut-like undertone, tart and crisp, a real delight for the ocular and olfactory senses. Start is ripe sweet fruit at the front; tart at the back, hint bitterness also present, top is moderate in feel. Finish has a stinging acidity, tart cherry flavor carries to the end, not a hint of the eight percent alcohol, what a Â“HootÂ”."
"Overall, recommended for certain circumstances. Could also be a good crossover beer."
"I'm convinced that this brewery could pee in a bottle, cap it, and it would turn out great. They simply can do no wrong. This beer proves it. A burst of tart cherry aromas fill the nose, followed up by a vineous, woodiness, and sharp berry character. The beer looks darker than most fruit lambics, but still take on a red hue, laced well, and held a firm foamstand throughout. Flavors of tart (nearly sour) cherries swirl around a solid malt base to amplify a sweet / savory / wine-like complexity. A firm hop bitterness combines with a sharp astringency to temper the intense fruitiness and sweetness. Alcholols are hardly detectable, but thin the beer for ease in drinking. Finishes with a candy-cherry flavor and a bitey-bitterness. It certainly picks up on a lot of Framboise-type character, but a bit more malty, and less intense sourness might make it prefered."
"O: Despite being my favorite of the cherry (non-lambic) beers, I can only drink one of these in an evening... but I would certainly return for another."
"This beer is very drinkable for me, though it isn't necessarily drinkable by beer standards. It tastes like a really awsome Slurpee. Hardcore beer zealots might frown on this one for abandoning their hops and malts for overly masking cherries. I like it because it tastes like liquid cherry candy and has 8%. Best candy ever!"
"Overall: I love this beer. What more can I say?"
"This beer pours a very dark red color with a mediun pink head that has ok retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly comprised of sweet cherry juice - not very tart at all, just sweet. Reminds me of a cherry syrup. The flavor is all cherry. Slightly tart and quite sweet - again, reminds me of cherry juice. Leaves a cherry flavor on the tongue. Effervescent. The body is medium and the drinkability is good. The alcohol is not even slightly obvious. Tasty brew."
"Pours a deep mahogany red with a quickly receding pink head. I am a big fan of Flemish sours, and was looking to try something new when I picked this up. I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but figured it would be similar to a lambic. This was a bit of a disappointment. Fist off, it completely lacks any subletly or complexity. It smacks you with cherries throughout. It's strong and malty, which I like, but has a harsh medicinal aftertaste. To be blunt, it's like drinking carbonated cough syrup. I would pass this one by. You can do much better for the price."
"good stuff. nice for dessert, or a relaxing nightcap."
"Overall, I'm pretty dissappointed in this one. With the Kasteel name, I was expecting a good, well made fruit beer, not another lambic rip-off like those that they bottle with the St. Louis name. The smell alone is enough to turn you off. All that being said, this could be GREAT to cook with. I can think of a dozen or more marinades and recipes that this would be great for. Perhaps I'll buy another to toy around with..."
"Pours a very clear candy apple amber in color, topped with a dense, frothy two-fingered head. The color of the head is a blend of light tan and red, for what I might best describe as a ""dusty pink", and this aspect of the presentation is actually somewhat impressive; the head fills the glass nicely for several minutes befor fading to a ring of moderate lace around the edge. Compared to the visual aspect, the nose is less impressive, it's mostly canned sweetened cherries. Yes, the same kind you use to make cherry cobbler and/or scoop over cheesecake (complete with that thick cherry sauce!), so for the most part it's a sickly-sweet, concentrated, and not at all natural smell. I'm also getting cherry Life-Saver (TM), cherry Tootsie-Pop (TM), and even Cherry Sucrets! So far this is not really my bag, baby. Owing to the color of the head I had to check the label to make sure that there was no artificial color (or sweetener) in this one, but no, there is none - or at least none listed. And the taste? Throw the idea that this might be a fruit lambic -or even a sweetened fruit lambic- right out the window. What this is is a Belgian brown ale jumped-up with fructose-sweetened cherry juice. It's almost an 'either you'll like it or you won't' proposition. While this is medium-bodied and with a nice brisk feel on the tongue and palate, neither is it all that compelling, instead moving from a sweet cherry explosion to a lightly malty booziness and then fading away to a light citric tang and somewhat dull cherry aftertaste. The 8% ABV is welcome here, if only to break through the wall of canned cherry. Drinkability would be better if this were a bit more exciting. Malt profile is dominated by the unnaturally sweet cherry on one hand (bad) and the tart, tangy cherry quality on the other (good), so don't go looking for too much complexity, it's smothered. Apart from that, this is really not a bad beer. It might make an interesting ale to blend with a strong dark Belgian (like Kasteel's own Donker) and it might be an interesting choice for a 'training wheels' fruit beer (instead of Lindeman's, New Glarus, etc), but in the end I had expected more from the Kasteel brand."
"This beer pours a clear dark ruby color. The head is large and dark pink in color. It recedes rather quickly into a nice cap of foam. The aroma is of cherries. It is a nice aroma, but completely lacking in complexity. The taste is of cherries, but with a funky sour milk like aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, it is very noticable that this beer is an ale trying to be a lambic, and not a real lambic. I just cannot deal with that rotten aftertaste. This is a drain pour."
