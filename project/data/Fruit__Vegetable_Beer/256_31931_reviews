"Pretty good summer beer, just the right amount of tangerine"

"Much better than most fruit beers. I'd take this over blue moon any day!"
"Purchased at BevMo Manhattan Beach."
"Worth a try...  as most beers are."

"I'm a sucker for  citrusy beers."

"Nice summertime beer, not filling, nice tangerine finish, and I like citrus."

"This is my wife's favorite beer - and she hates beer. I have to keep it in the fridge. So, for those who are not looking for a hoppy, sour, palate destroying taste, this is the beer for you. As soon as you pop the cap, a burst of tangerine smell hits you and then when you are finished, the taste lingers like a wheat biscuit on the back of your tongue."

"When I rate a beer I try to be objective. Even if I don't particularly appreciate a certain style I try to rate it according to other beers in the style that I have tried. I have been to Lost Coast Brewery and it was a great experience. However Tangerine Wheat was anything but great. I hope it was an old bottle or my glass was used to clean a toilet. It was very very orangey but after about a second I had to force a swallow and drain pour the rest. I'll try it one more time and see, but as of this review. Avoid!"

"  Overall a solid 4.5 for Tangerine Wheat - Lost Coast Brewery and Cafe. I was pleasantly surprised by the non-artificiality of the tangerine flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really not impressed. Too big on the fruit character, loses the hops and malt in the sweetness. A little metallic as well."
"Overall (4.24) : Would I drink this again? Dude, sign me up to buy cases. This is a pleasant beer all around. The smell blew me away, and the taste did little to sway that opinion. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style, and what else is left? The design of the bottle is catchy, too. Tangerine Wheat is fab."

"Pours a slight hazy golden in color with a thin white head. Some sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. Medium/+ carbonation. Some light spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of tangerine zest for the most part and some grains. Lots more tangerine zest flavor for the taste mixed with some grains/wheat. Very slight dry bitter finish that doesn't last at all. Overall, a very decent summer brew."

"O: I would not be so quick to buy this next time, but it was not bad. It was worth a try. I will say it was not among my favorites but I have had others I liked less. In short it is worth a try if you are looking for something on a warm pleasant day."

"Easily seduced by the ripe orange flavor, any notion of ale are easy to dismiss. But in the end, the beer is grainy-sweet to a fault and its orange taste becomes way too dominant, not allowing the classic ale-like taste to become part of its story."

"I believe this to be a beer that is suited to taste. If you are a fan of beers with strong tangerines and apricot sweetness than this is up your alley."

"Overall a pretty good fruit beer on a hot summer evening which it is right now. I think you could do better with a decent wheat beer and squeeze an orange wedge or half a tangerine into the beer."

"Smelled orange, tangerine, pulp, orange rind and maybe some citrus hops. Simple, yet good. Got orange, tangerine, orange rind, orange pulp, wheat and grass. Reminded me a bit of an orange creamsicle, orange Smarties and the orange type of dental cleaning powder. Light body. Thin-to-oily texture. Lively carbonation. Astringent, crisp and refreshing finish. A excellent fruit beer not fruity to the extent of disgust. I would highly recommend this seasonal specialty! One of the top on my list under this category. 150 calories per bottle 5% ABV."
"A pretty good fruit beer overall, although I’m usually a sucker for these ones (not summer beers though). Nice for the summer."
""
""
""
"This pours a lemony golden color. There’s a barely perceptible citrus aroma to this. I can almost taste a hint of tangerine along with some orange peel and a hint of coriander. There’s some fizz on the end of this otherwise forgettable beer. With so much out there I’d pass on this next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: awesome summer brew!"
""
"D- not so bad for what it is. The flavors compliment each other well enough, but it isn't a knock out by any means."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden with a thin white head. fresh tangerine peel aromas abound, quite nice. Taste begins with a rich tangerine flavor, then a little bit of bread, finishing with a dry, citrus finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall quite a nice beer. You can tell you are drinking a wheat beer, even with the tons of citrus flavor."

"O - Started refreshingly interesting, but the Tangerine is too much. If this beer were a bit mellower and had a little hop bitterness to counter the tangerine it could really work."

"Overall - While it starts off well enough, the tangerine carries too much into the finish, leaving an overpowering sensation on the palate. A near headache inducing experience after one beer. I once bought a sixer several years ago when it first hit the scene. I couldn't get through two before I gave the rest of the sixer away. I swore I'd never try this beer again, but once I began to review beers I knew I'd have to give it one more round before putting it to rest forever. It's a shame, this could be a great beer if it were toned down and given considerably better balance. As it is, it's awful."

"Perfect for a hot summer day."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't buy this beer. I really can't help but wonder if this beer really has tang in it? This is the worst beer I've had in a long time."
""
"O: Must try if you like tangerine. Otherwise, would not recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This seems like it would be better paired for a hot summer day by the pool or just after finishing up the yard work on a 90 degree day. It could be good, but unfortunately the tangerine flavor is a bit too artificial in character."

"screw the haters on this one, this beer kicks ass. whether you like fruit beers or not, you have to respect this one. so much flavor! the pour is a relatively standard looking pale wheat color with a lacey but thin white head. the nose is epic, so much tangerine, right from the tree. its acidic and sweet, tangy and robust, its juicy and alive, all at once. its fantastic, and it crowds out any heavy vibes from the wheat malt in both taste and smell. all those aromas carry through to the flavor, which is equally orangey and refreshing. there is no other brew out there this heavy on the tangerine citrus element. its uncanny really. more than enough carbonation, made a little heavy from the left over yeast, but to me this is inconsequential, as the tangerine notes make this beer as light as can be. a perfect spring break lounge chair sipper, winter transformer, or everyday slammer. i absolutely adored this beer, and im sorry to see it rated so low. i think its a rare thing in the beer world to encounter a brew with so much fruit character that isnt sweet or fake. this is really lovely, dont let the ratings throw you off."
""
""
""
""

"Taste throws out some competing flavors....I dont like how the malty sweetness plays against the sharp, obvious tangerine citrus. It lacks flow and the pithy character comes out too much. I dont like the syrupy wheat/malt flavors and think this would come across better with a lighter malt and an uplifting bubbly carbonation. The mouthfeel is a little flat and a touch cloying. I am a sucker for fruit beers, so I will finish this 12 oz sample, but I definitely wont look for this one again."
""
""
""
"Tastes similar to the aroma, like slightly carbonated soap, with a hint of wheat and citrus at the finish. Definitely not impressive."

"Overall- If you searching for hopps and malts you will be disapointed in this brew. However, evaluating the beer for what it is (fruit beer) I think it hit its mark quite well. This beer is well crafted and is defiinatley an above average fruit beer. The beer needed a thicker head with more lacing on the glass and lacked complexity to be considered a nop notch beer. This beer would be an excellant picnic beer or hot wheater beer. It would also be an excellant entry level beer for someone new to craft beer. Overall I enjoyed the beer. It is definatley interesting and worth checking out."

"Was looking forward to trying this beer at a relatively new bar nearby my house. At first I enjoyed the aroma - it has a very strong tangerine smell to it. The first few sips were ok, but the more I drank through my pint, the more and more it started to taste like Tang. The Tangerine is way too strong in this beer without any other flavors to complement it. It honestly didn't taste like a wheat beer, let alone a beer at all. Unfortunately it was a disappointment."
""
""
"Fizzy like club soda with a feel similar to it as well. Fairly clean finish though dry and bitter. A decent beer overall but needs a better, less bitter, finish. And some wheat notes would be good, too."
""
""
""
"But this beer, to me, is hardly palatable. It is thin, watery, and sweet/ dry from the tangerine. It tastes like a yucky soda."
""
"Overall – It reminded me too much of a orange soda to really be a beer. I can't say I've ever had a beer that tasted quite like this one, so that made it worthwhile to try. I won't be buying this again."
"Overall a very fruity tasting brew with a thin watery feel, would be great when you feel overheated and want to chug a few..."
""
""
""
""
"O - It reminds me of Blue Moon with an orange slice, but without that cardboard taste that Blue Moon seems to have."
"I was actually in the mood for a wheat beer this particular day. Served in a ribbed tumbler, a hazy, burnt sienna color with a wispy white head; no real retention or lacing to speak of. Obvious whole tangerine peel in the nose, with a zesty wheat profile. Delivers what it promises in the taste, bready wheat malts, tangerine and more tangerine, from the pulp to the peel, mild pithy bitterness in the finish. Light-medium body, a bit chewy, and moderately refreshing. No surprises here. Not too bad overall."

"Poured from the bottle the beer appears a hazy orange-ish with a microscopic white head. The nose is a potent orange soda slap in the face with a hint of beer...brings me back to my Keenan and Kel days. Unfortunately, it tastes exactly like orange soda as well...god awful beer with no redeeming qualities. The artificial orange candy flavor and extreme effervescence is way too overpowering to say that the slight bitterness on the back end brings balance to the beverage. Although I can't detect an ABV at all making it quite drinkable...for a mixed drink. I will never drink this ""beer"" again."
""
"O - Not a very good beer. Reminded me of a weak tangerine cough syrup. It was hard to finish the bottle, but I did it. Never again."
""
"Overall - I love this beer. It's nice to try something different.. After about 10 minutes the foam and lacing was completely gone, but I can't say it had a negative effect on the flavor. You probably shouldn't to drink this beer if you have acid reflux, it's quite acidic. I'm finding this out afterward.. lol"
""
""
"I wanted to like the beer. I love the smell. I love orange in my alcohol. I just couldn't get past it."

"The strong tangerine flavor combined with this brew is how a wheat beer should be; forget adding the orange to Blue Moon, this is the beer you want!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Okay brew, the tangerine taste seems a bit forced, is a refreshing finish"
""

"O) Lives up to its name -- tangerine beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know if I'd buy this with food, cause it does ride the palate a fair bit, but its definitely a good kind of ""kick back and knock one down"" kind of drink."
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a 1/2 inch orange-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is a mix of tangerines and oranges with some slight grain aromas. Taste is of intense tangerine up front (fruit and zest) with a wheat aftertaste. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good fruit beer that delivers much more than I was expecting it to."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy beige color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of tangerines, some wheat. Taste is tart, lots of tangerine, a touch of wheat, a slight bitterness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a drinkable and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent fruit beer, would only get it whilst in the mood."
"A more than reasonable offering from the fruit beer category. While I prefer the essence and balance of something like Hangar 24's Orange Wheat, Tangerine Wheat is a little bit of a breakup from the usual orange flavored wheat ale."

"i mean if your in the mood for something unusual try it. or if you cant get those pesky stains off your liver, try it"
""
"D: Very drinkable, this would be great on the beach. Overall a nice mix of flavors and feel. It was more tangerine flavor than I was expecting and I surprisingly liked it."
"Overall a nice summer beer."
""
""
""
"Dr: Very drinkable, but lacking complexity or inspiration. I'd have it again at a lower price."
"O-not a good fruit beer whatsoever, very poor beer. could not even finish it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, as soft drink, it would be ok, as a beer it is less than ok. Very disappointing and difficult to finish."
"O) I like fruit beers for the most part. Perhaps I would have enjoyed this more on a hot summer day, but I sincerely doubt it."
"Overall: Couldn't hack the memories of children's aspirin that this beer brought back for me; drain pour"
"Overall: Bascially alcoholic flat fanta. It was good but not what I want from my beer."
"The Tangerine Wheat from Lost Coast is very good. If your hanging with some hotties and want them to try a good fruit style beer....this is it. The appearance I thought was lacking...the color was a cloudy burnt yellow color. The was zero head present and no lacing. The smell was AMAZING....like an orange Life Savor....very good! The taste had a big orange/tangerine taste with hints of spices. This could be compared to a Blue Moon with Orange Peel. The mouthfeel was very smooth and easy to drink....great summer beer."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow hue which leaves a fast vanishing two finger head and a very little rim of lacing,the smell is basically one of the most strongest fruit inspired wheat beers ive ever sampled and has aromas of very strong Tangerine a touch like sunkist and with a twist of candied wheat,the mouthfeel is light bodied and very similar to sunkist with its high carbonation and the only tastes i can phathom from this brew are obviously Tangerine,candied wheat and fruit punch and overall the Tangerine is way too overpowering and doesnt let any other flavours shine and i would not buy again it almost reminds me of sunkist mixed with vodka cheers."
"Is what it is and does what it does. Probably be very enjoyable in peak summer."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with about a half inch white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing at all. The beer smells mostly like tangerines, along with a little bit of wheat. It tastes kinda like a watered down sugar substitute tangerine/citrusy soda would taste. Not awful, but not exactly good, either. Mouthfeel/body is light, it has good carbonation and it's not hard to drink. Overall I can't say I'm impressed with this beer at all. I like the aroma, but that's about the only thing I like a lot about this brew. With that being said, I'd still try this again in the future just as long as I was only buying a single bottle and not a 6 pack. I've had worse but I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy more than a single bottle of this at a time."
"It's drinkable, but just barely."
"O: A very drinkable wheat ale with fruit, but it may be too sweet for some."
"Overall, a good beer and highly recommended for those looking to try something different and specially to all the tangerine lovers."
"This is just like a glass of Sunkist only with a touch less sugar. For me it is over the top on the fruit flavour and it lacks any sense of finesse."
"O- Good beer but it felt like it was lacking.. Not sure what it's missing, bit something feels off. It wasn't bad, but not one of my favorites. I'll definitely try another brew from them again though..."
"We first must say we are usually drinking stouts or porters. In addition, from experience most beers claiming tangerine flavor/taste were disappointing. That is not the case with this beer. Right from the start this beer has a strong tangerine aroma on the nose. A nice clean white ivory head implies the carbonation that is in this beer. This beer also has a slight thickness that is unexpected. The flavor of tangerine also comes out in the taste with only an extremely slight bitterness but an effervescence that clears out the bitterness leaving the orangey taste. A really great summer beer."
"Pours a clean orangish-yellow with carbonation bubbles coming to the top. Nose is wheat and fruit, the tangerine comes through nicely. Taste is malt and wheat with the tangerine present but not overpowering or oversweet. Mouthfeel is light bodied and very carbonated. Rather refreshing overall. I enjoyed it at the pool while on vacation in CA."
"Overall I was not impressed with this beer."
"When I poured this brew into a glass, I noticed how orange it looked in the glass. I could definitely smell the tangerine. It smell was a little strong for my liking. The head on my beer was quickly gone. The taste for me was that of a nice smooth beer. This is the sort of beer that you could have after a hard day at work or mowing the lawn and you want something refreshing that would not fill you up. If I had to pick a food to go with it, I would have this brew with finger foods, or a vegetable plate. I think this is the type of brew that you would have as an appetizer. Before you drank a heavier beer with a meal."
"Overall: Not a good beer on any level but the smell so if you wanna spend money to sit around and smell a beer then this one is for your"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a pleasant, refreshing beverage that seems more like a fruit soda than a beer. It offers the prospect of a refreshing cooler on a hot, humid summer’s day, and that is probably when I I might be willing to have another. My overall impression of this beer is that it is a bit better than some of the fruit/wheat beers I’ve tried and the wheat/tangerine makes a good combination. But it is a bit too much like a soda to suit my tastes."
"O: Not something I could enjoy on a daily basis. However, one would be quenching on a hot summer day, after mowing the lawn, etc."
"Poured out as a hazy orange color with a nice looking white head on it. The beer doesn't have much lacing. The smell is heavy with tangerine with light aromas of wheat. The taste is very strong with tangerine, it almost tastes like perfume or something. It's a little too strong I think. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing perfect for those days when it's hot out. Overall it's not bad but the flavor is a bit on the potent side."
"Hazy orange in body with light bubbly white. Fruity aroma of tangerine, dandelion, cream soda. Tastes of light tangerine, wheat, slight yeast character, floral notes, an underlying dry hop character is quite refreshing as well. Tangerine lingers on the palate in the aftertaste. Light body with some fizzy carbonation. Much better than expected. Refreshing and balanced for a fruit focused beer. It doesn't go over the top in it's tangerine direction."
"Saw this at By The Bottle in Vancouver and said ""summer is upon us, time for wheat beers"" cracked it open after work today and so far, I am pleased. It pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with some visible carbonation. Head is about 1/2 inch tall in my imperial pint glass and it fades quickly, eventually it recedes to a ring around my glass and a slight bit of film over the top of my beer. When I smell it the first thing I get I tangerines, sort of an orange candy sort of smell. As I taste it I first catch the wheat, but the tangerine taste takes over quickly. In general I would describe the taste as being similar to an orange creamsicle. The tangerine taste lingers for a bit, but I wouldn't call it much of an ""aftertaste"". Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but I think that gives it a refreshing feel. Overall, this beer is okay on a summer day, and if creamsicles are your thing, then this is right up your alley."
"O: I had high hopes, and I really tried to enjoy this beer but the medicinal quality of it really ruined it for me."
"O: I'm a fan of fruit beers, when it's done right. This one was intriguing to me, but it didn't really scratch my citrus itch. I don't think I will be giving this one a round two."
"D - This is a very strange beer with some over the top tangerine character. I mean, I expected citrus but this is ridiculous. It really smells like a piece of fruit, which works well in the aroma but not so much flavor wise. It has a weird, orange soda aftertaste that just doesn't do much for me. Not a drain pour, but really not good."
"O: Too sweet for me, and lacks balance, granted it's a fruit beer, but for such low ABV, and like the fruit, it should be refreshing, lighter, even crisper. I'd pass on this again. Glad I split this bottle."
"Overall wow I expected more from a California brewery but this beer is crap! I can forgive extra sweet beers but when the beer has no quality other than tangerine flavored water I can't help but bash it. Average at best..."
"D- Very much a fruit beer trying at a wheat not the other way around. This one is very sweet so it's difficult to have more than one."
"D: Wouldn't be all that bad if the texture was fixed. Besides that though, it's quite one dimensional."
"Drinkability. Good drinker if I'm in the mood for something like this. Would be a nice on a hot day while camping."
"A cloudy orange with a ton of carbonation and good retention. The nose smacks of orange and tangerine, like Tang! and nothing else. The taste is all OJ again. The mouthfeel is creamy but quite dry. Not the best of this style but may be a good substitute for a mimosa at brunch."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, this beer pours with a smell like you are actually peeling a tangerine. I'm impressed so far. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold color with a thick, foamy, dense white head. Picture perfect for a Wheat. As I said before, it smells like an actual peeled tangerine. When you get your nose deep in there you get some effervescent versions of the citrus smells, and the constant flow of bubbles also shows a high level of carbonation. In mouth that carbonation makes the beer a bit sharp, but the flavors are made to be crisp and light. Full flavors of light malt, oat/cereal, and a surprisingly light citrus highlight. With the nose of this beer, I was almost expecting a mouthful of Orange Crush, but the citrus aspect was a nice balance rather than an overpowering ogre. The beer stays light and crisp throughout drinking, with a minimal citrus aftertaste on an extremely quick finish. This beer is super-easy to drink by the bucket, and on a hot day I would absolutely fill a cooler with this brew."
"Will drink again."
"Notes: This one was way off balance and too light on the palate. Overall I was just not impressed with this beer."
"(12oz bottle). Pous hazy yellow-orange with white head. Very little carbonation. Aroma of orange/tangerine-almost like those orange jelly candies that are shaped like a slice of orange. Taste is sweet, but the first sip is almost like an orange soda with the fizziness hitting your mouth. Thin to medium bodied with slick texture. Finish has a bite like the taste of the peel (and pith) of the citrus. Interesting. It's refeshing and crisp. Would make a nice summer beer."
"Big thanks to Gobzilla for sharing this one upon my arrival to Cali. Served from bottle into a Firestone Walker sampler shaker. Poured a hazy yellow yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and tangerines. The flavor was of sweet malt, tangerines, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall I wasn't really a fan of this one at all. Tastes like a fruit drink (the ones without all the added sugars). This might be okay mixed with Vodka but that might be about it..."
"Not having this particular fruit (though it's not all that different from navel oranges, IMHO) as part of my diet, it was enjoyable to see it so prominent in the profile of this wheat beer, and tasty enough at that, if you're OK with such brazen simplicity in your doctored brews."
"Poured a hazy golden orange in color with pale yellow highlights that had a very thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was that of a tangerine jolly rancher candy with faint wheat notes and a bit of underlying bready character; pretty basic aroma. The tangerine pretty much dominates the palate with lots of sweetness some mild wheaty accents and a touch of breadiness in the backgound. The brew was light to medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a very sweet and mild bready wheaty finish. I can't believe I used to really like this beer but after no having it for awhile and seriuosly drinking lots of craft brew I have definitely out grown it."
"D: Just far too sweet to drink any significant amount of. Like drinking melted candy."
"D: great substitute for orange kool aid, wife enjoyed it. Great fruity beer if that is what you like."
"D: not bad, nice beer for a hot summer day, very refreshing citrus drink"
"Lost Coast's Tangerine Wheat poured a clear orange-copper with a thin off-white head and minimal to no retention. Nothing impressive, but what it's lacking in appearances, it certainly makes up for in nose. This was probably one of my favorite beers to smell if only because it was pure sweet, freshly-peeled clementine and tangerines - a nicely sweetened orange citrus juice with plenty of sugar and zero bitterness; I almost want to say it reminded me of some sort of cleaning agent, minus the hospital smell. Had I not been at an event for beer tasting, there is no way I would have known this was a beer purely by smell, as the alcohol was nonexistent in the nose. Even in the taste, it was like an off-kilter orange soda. Sipping it made me think of sucking on a clementine splashed with tangerine. The mouthfeel was medium with quite light carbonation that kept it from being fizzy. It ended nice and clean and very fresh - a summery, fruity drink by all measures."
"D- I usually hate fruit beers. I would love to drink this after a long bike ride. It's a very refreshing beer. That said it isn't too beery, more like a mixed radler."
"Very unpleasant beer this one. It's not a refreshing fruit beer, it's an unfortunate and insipid one. Very little to recommend it, even if you're a fan of the style."
"I had such hi hopes for this one, too. What a shame."
"D - If you like Tang, this is a great beverage. If you want a beer, this is not for you."
"D - Pretty much as advertised. Heaps of tangerine flavour, but I think the beer got lost in the shuffle some."
"D) Not easy drinking unless you like orange soda. I would not have another one of these."
"I would recommend this beer to people really into fruit beers but I could live my whole life and never have this again."
"Fitting orange-gold color, the light head dissipates very quickly. Dominant smell of sweet citrus/tangerine is strong and pleasant with a nice wheat backdrop. Tangerine flavor is lighter in taste, a little sweet, but some wheat in the finish to balance. Lots of carbonation and slightly viscous mouthfeel make it somewhat soda like. A pretty good fruity beer, but no more than 2 for me."
"Overall-I normally hate to trash a beer but for me this one honestly crashed and burned, not at all a good mix of flavors."
"Remember - You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning!"
"D: a little drier finish and some more carbonation would have made this much more drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is light, medium carbonation. Refreshing as a wit should be. Drinkability is good. No flaws and a moderate ABV make this sessionable."
"D - I could pound this all day in the sun"
"D- This stuff is simply amazing. A tasty summertime beverage, and this one would be perfect as a 'hair-of-the-dog' type drink after a night of drinking! The orange is quite dominant, but there's enough wheaty/malty flavours that linger to remind you that it's still beer. I wish this stuff came in a 6-pack, because it's the perfect summertime beer."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a thin white head. Not much retention, and just a bit of laceing. Aroma is of sweet tart candy. Body is light with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is Tangerine up front with a mix of sweet tart fruits and wheat throughout. Tart finish. Not bad if you like this style."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: well, it's a light and refreshing beer, but I feel like the tangerine is just way too much. Again, that's what they advertise, but this is basically tangerine cream soda that happens to have malt and alcohol in it."
"although I did like this beer I wouldn't recommend it unless you need a citrus blast"
"D - You'd have to be the judge on this one...I could drink a lot of these pretty quick because the sweetness is not overpowering and it would be perfect on a hot day...but I would not have a few of these just for the heck of it"
"D: This is a lot better than some of the other artificial fruit beers out there, but it's just too fake in the end for me."
"D - You'd better love orange/tangering/citrus fruit... otherwise, don't bother. However, I found this to be a light, quaffable wheat beer with a bold citrus character that's nice for warm-weather imbibing."
"Brought back from San Diego by my wife. Pours a light apricot color, with a nice billowy white head. Huge citrus aromas or orange and tangerine. A decent wheat beer, with big tangerine and orange flavors. A pretty decent, refreshing beer, nice for a spring day."
"At 5%, this is a pretty drinkable fruit beer. I could drink a a few of these for sure. IMO, This would make a great beer around Christmas. I hope it's available around that time of year. This beer is really in a category of its own- amazing."
"Drinkability: refreshing and zinging with carbonation, easy to drink despite its problems."
"D - One was enough, and although it was drinkable on a hot day, I wouldn't order it again."
"D: one of the most refreshing ales I've had so far. This is perfect for spring/summer on the beach, bbq, Poolside, anywhere in the sun basically. This beer is alot more intricate in flavor and aroma than beers like shock-top or blue moon IMO."
"At just 5% abv you don't notice any alcohol, but it's too much like a carbonated soda to enjoy too many of these at a sitting."
"Overall I think this beer is going to polarize. Some people would like it, and it could be approachable for the uninitiated beer drinker who also likes fruit flavors. The base beer is probably pretty good, but the tangerine flavor is too prominent and just not natural-tasting enough for me. Not bad, but also not my thing. But, I wouldn't refuse it if offered on a hot day."
"Drinks ok here- definitely not the girly fruit beer you give your girlfriend."
"A bit hazy and dark yellow in color. Beautiful white head disappears quickly and is not very sticky. Aroma is all tangerine. Actually, my first thought was orange soda. The second one was organge gum. Regardless, I do not find aroma particularly inviting for a beer. Plus, it's just too strong. Taste is disappointing. Not very crisp, a bit sweet. Orange and lemon are both citrus, but what a different in wheat beer. Actually, I can probably go for an orange slice in my beer, but this is just too much. Light to medium body. Drinkable (just not enjoyable). Not much in terms of aftertaste (just lingering orange sweetness)."
"Drinkability - None. I gave this another try but honestly, with the insane amounts of carbonation, lack of flavor, mouthfeel, etc. I just can't justify my wasting both calories and my taste buds on this when I have a fresh Pliny sitting in the refrigerator. I think I may try another new beer first because I can't even get past half a glass of this. Truly a sad excuse for a beer and I will avoid at all costs from now on."
"D - This is probably a great beer for people who are not really into beer and like soda or fruit drinks. It tastes absolutely disgusting and has horrible mouthfeel, would never do it again."
"The brew paired very well with the steak! I used a mild seasoning, but the natural flavors of the steak played well with the citrus...almost like a marinade. This was a very fun beer as far as wheats go."
"Mouthfeel, remarkably consistent for a fruit beer, they usuall falter down the stretch. Drinkable, although not worth $7 a 6er, unless its for your old lady and she's hot."
"Nothing worth drinking, not a fruit or lambic style beer."
"D: From what I have read on this beer style, this one seems to match it perfectly. Very little balance going on here, but the flavor of tangerines is very pronounced and enjoyable. Flavor and mouthfeel together make this one that almost anybody could enjoy, whether or not they appreciate a good beer."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Not much of a head, especially for a wheat beer. What there is dissipates quickly leaving only a small layer of foam. Appearance is a moderately cloudy golden/copper. Aroma is dominated by a very pleasant tangerine presence, though malty wheat notes are detectable in the background. Those malt and wheat notes are nowhere to be found in terms of taste. Nicely acidic tangerine is present in abundance, but the ""beer"" taste itself seems a bit watered down. More maltiness would have provided balance and much improvement. Mouthfeel is very refreshing, with plenty of carbonation. Overall a decent and refreshing fruit beer, but it is lacking in traditional wheat beer characteristics."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a slight orangish hue. It has a beautiful white head with excellent retention. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a modest tangerine aroma. The taste is average. It has a crisp wheat beer flavor with what tastes like watered down orange juice. I'm not a huge fan of the fruit flavor here. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a bit too much carbonation. This is an average fruit/wheat beer. I don't think I'll be having another one of these any time soon."
"Drinkability> Nope. Couldn't even get half way on the pint before giving it up to a friend, and she wouldn't drink it because she didn't want to waste her alcohol intake on something that tasted like ""bad Clearly Canadian."""
"its as if someone took a wheat ale and squeezed in some tangerine. it has a real sugary taste, with real powerful tangerine flavor. like other reviews, if you dont like tangerine, you dont like this beer. to me its almost overwhelming, and infact, borderline in the same category mikes hard lemonade. but since i love lost coast i wont be to mean. it is in fact refreshing on account of its higher carbonation. and the wheat beer thats hiding under the tangerine actually has good flavor. This is another good beer to have when you spending some time in the sun, coming out of the ice chest a few degress cooler than the fridge. like i said, if there was a refreshment rating it would be really high, and as far as fruit or vegetable beers go its top notch."
"I have had this beer in bottle and on tap. When I tried this beer it was a nice change of pace from my normal great white and guiness beers I usually drink. It had good appearance and smell. Smells like tangerines! Taste was good with strong tangerine tastes. After a few of was feeling great. Nothing was too special about it. A good over all beer."
"The taste and smell are much better than it looks. Easily sessionable for those interested in fruity beers. I enjoyed one of these but I won't be seeking it out."
"D - Pretty high. You know, I'm not a huge fan of fruity wheat beers, but this is supposed to be a fruity wheat beer, and considering that, it's not that bad."
"Drinkability: If I had kids, this is what I'd put in their lunchboxes. Personally, I'll stick to beer that doesn't taste like soda."
"Bomber- pours a cloudy dull orange with thin soapy head and little lacing. Nose- big orange juice, five alive beverage smell that overpowers any malt in the nose. Taste- stale fake orange juice. Has a very mineral dryness to it. Little flavour from the malt. A screw driver would be much more satisfying if one was looking for an orange flavoured adult beverage."
"Tangerines are evident big time on the nose and to lesser extent on the taste...both though come off as artificial to me...the taste is of sweet artificial tangerine flavoring..just doesn't taste good to me or feel right...syrupy almost.... nice idea with the tangerines but this is not done well and is not one I would drink again."
"Good, low carbonation but a little sweet. Not quite as sessionable as it should be, even when served cold on a hot night."
"There is a subtle refreshing carbonation in the mouth that would quench a thirst on a hot day, but I wouldn't want to drink more of this than I had to."
"This beer had a pretty foggy/hazzy appearance. Smelled like a pretty nice tangerine. The taste was quite surprising, I had never had a fruity beer before, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. There was medium carbonation from what I noticed. In my opinion, fruity beers have kinda been more of a 'girlie' thing, but after finally having one, I can say this would be a good beer to have on a hot day for any guy. Enjoyable when you just want to kick back."
"Murky looking orange body. Fiery streaks of ruby accent. Thin dirty white head caps it off and leaves minimal amounts of lace. Aroma is bright, citrusy and full of tangerine. Like it. Taste can be described as all fruit flavor and little to no wheat flavor. I'd like a little more of a wheat presence, but this really isn't too bad as is. It's bright and spritzy and full of tangerine. A citric bitterness lingers. Body is medium and carbonation is fairly jacked up. Could be used as a decent refresher on a hot day."
"Bottle. Pours a hazy light orange amber with a thin white head. Aroma is tangerine and other citrus and a touch of malt. Flavor is also tangerine and malt, with only a hint of bitterness. Smooth and light mouthfeel. Not bad, but not my thing really. It is different, but I think I like other wheats better."
"Poured a nice light golden color with a nice whote head. Nose was pretty simple and straightforward..tangerine and wheat. Taste was nice, pretty balanced just enough tangerine to give it a great taste but not overpower like many fruit/wheat beer combos. Low ABV makes it very easy to drink and this would be a good hot summer day beer but not a session beer."
"Served on draft in a plastic cup... Clear dark orangey gold with a modest white head. Aroma is tangerine, grains, cream, and citrus. Flavor is grainy with banana pith notes and a rather decently-melded tangerine note. Doesn't taste overly artificial, although it is pretty sweet. Inoffensive, better than a lot of crummy fruit wheat beers out there."
"Couldn't drink then entire bomber, too sweet, but a good beer all things considered. Give this one a try."
"Hazy orange with blonde highlights and a decent cream colored cap that settles quicky to a skim and leaves scaps of lace behind. The smell is pure, fresh tangerine rind and orange candy. The flavor is incredibly fruity like a shandy or radler, half pale wheat beer and half diet orange soda/tangerine juice. Light bodied and creamy. I guess the drinkability depends on how much you like fruit flavor in your beer, it's a little much for my liking."
"Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat sounds like a pretty good idea. Too bad the execution leaves a little something to be desired. Indica IPA and 8 Ball Stout are still this brewery's best."
"Drinkability- This was a pretty good beer and would drink it again. It will definitely prevent scurvy."
"There's nothing really offensive about this beer but it's just too much like candy as I've said. Plenty of better summer beers out there."
"Delicious and refreshing. Serve with bacon!"
"Drinkability: I really want to like this beer with its tangerine and wheat profile, but the fruit flavors seem cheap. More wheat malt and a REAL tangerine addition, even at a lesser degree, would improve this beer."
"Last time I had an orange Hefe it was a Mandarin Hefe from Grants in their last years alive. It was over carbonated and too orangey. This is a better orange beer because the carbonation level is on the lower level and they don't knock you over the head with the Tangerine taste. It pours a kinda cloudy peachy dark gold colour with little head.The beer itself is a pretty good wheat with the tangerine showing up in the midbody and the finish.I added a lime slice and it helped the acid on the mouthfeel and then I added half a Whistler Wheat to added a more Hefe flavour. I ended getting a real nice summer beer but really the intial product is just OK"
"The smell was awesome. One whiff and you were overwhelmed with the lovely essence of the tangerine. The taste was fairly bitter with a good wheat malt to it with a dominant tangerine. it was pretty thin and mildly carbonated. Overall not a bad fruit beer effort."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with two-finger head that dies quickly and has a very fruity, springy smell. I like fruit beers, and had some hopes for this but it disapoints. First, it is sharp and sour tasting with the overcarbonation. Also, the fruit taste, the ""tangerine", feels like I'm drinking a flavored Diet Soda - just a little fake. The beer passes somewhat smooth and finishes clean, but it is rather pointedly tasty and not for the better. I don't see myself drinking this again."
"Wow, that's a lot of tangerine. Really. I mean if you're into super fruity beers and are especially fond of tangerines, this baby is up your alley. Otherwise I advise you to avoid this beer. There is a little bit of clean wheat malt flavor, but like I'm saying - tangerine, tangerine, tangerine."
"Drinkability- Saying this is a beer for junior high girls would be disrespectful to junior high girls' palates. It's nauseating how fake this beer tastes. I can't even give this beer the ol' ""would probably be good in the scorching sun"" label often given to shitty lagers and wheat beers. I don't like to be a hater, but I feel abused paying $3 for this ""beer."""
"Basically this tastes like less-concentrated tangerine juice. Sure, there is a hint of wheat in there, but you hardly notice it. It loses all sense of being a beer in the taste. Really pointless, even for the novelty factor... better just to visit the produce and/or juice sections of your local grocery store."
"I was disappointed, I expected better things from this beer and it turned out to have the same pitfalls as most flavored beers."
"Beer poured a 1.5 finger head that dies quickly. Cloudy orangish-amber color looks rather intriguing. Smell is what I expected, wheaty with tangerines. Taste is a pretty straight forward, a wheat beer with a tangerine finish. It's a simple beer that is very easy to drink. However, I think I'd get bored with it after a couple."
"Lost Coast Tangerine is a hazy and sparkling ale that lingers between light amber and deep gold, with a hue leaning toward peach. It has a small white head that fades to a film and stays put to leave nice lacing on the glass. It has a bright tangerine aroma, with a note of lemongrass. It is medium bodied, quite bubbly and extremely smooth. The finish is clean. Tangerine is quite prominent in the taste. It is moderately bitter and well balanced. It is a nice, sound, refreshing and satisfying wheat ale serving as a backdrop for tangerine. There is a clean, short, tangerine peel finish. What a great idea. Rather than just trying to emulate citrus with hops, they just went for it."
"While I usually don't enjoy fruity beers, it was on tap and something new so I figured I'd give it a try. Very nice smelling, light and easy to drink beer. It didn't seem like many fruit flavored beers that taste like beer with some fruit extract dumped into it after the fact, was a well blended combination and a pleasant suprise. I wouldn't want more than one of these, but it is a beer that I would try again."
"Wheat and tangerine are delivered more or less as advertised. Not sure if that's a good idea though."
"D - Refreshing soft fruit brew that met my expectations."
"D- Way easy to drink, unless you find the strong fruit taste to be on the offensive side, which I did. Grapefruit is also not a favorite of mine, and by the end of the 22 oz it was getting very tiring. Some overtly fruity beers (Read: New Glarus Rasberry Tart) I can drink all day, but not this one."
"D- I really do like this beer, but wouldn't find myself having more than one bottle of this at a time, as the citrus flavors are very prominent and could easily get to be a little too much. However, on a hot day, I might be a little more liberal with this one....overall a decent beer!"
"Pours orange-yellow colour with nice one finger head. Smell - tangerines, kinda fanta smeel, wheaty flavour barely noticeable. Taste - tangerines kill all wheat flavor, but it's still pretty decent beer. It kinda like drinking fanta mixed with beer. Fruity, crispy, refreshing. Interesting stuff. Wouldn't drink this on a regular basis, but I'd have it once in a while on a hot summer day."
"As a Lambic, I really liked this one. The tangerine could be tiresome after 2 or 3, but if I was in a pub in Eureaka I certainly wouldn't hesitate to order a pint or two. Certianly worth a try."
"A very drinkable brew. Light ad crisp, it would be a great thirst quencher on a hot day."
"In the end it's an okay flavoured wit, I was hoping for more tangerine as was promised in the aroma, but as a result doesn't stand out too much from the throngs on wheat and wit beers with similar flavour profiles and no extras added."
"Bottom line: it's a tasty combination, and if you like fruit lambics, you'll probably like this. Much better than the blueberry wheat beers out there. Would be even better with a bit more carbonation, a thicker head, and more mouthful."
"Mouthfeel was good, light carbonation and a clean finish. Pretty easy to drink if you like the taste."
"Drinkability: Just when I was griping about a lack of tangerine-based beers Lost Coast saves the day."
"Still, I gotta give props to my man, hurleymanvw, for bringing this one back for me and my girlfriend on their recent trip. She actually didn't mind it at all; I just couldn't bring myself past the basement thing. Take all this with a grain of salt, it's probably just me."
"D - Good, real refreshing for a fruit beer."
"Tangerine Wheat pours a hazy orange color with an off white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma does a pretty good job of capturing tangerine, it's not all sweetness, there is some rind too. The body is very light, there is a nice tangerine flavor and a fair bit of wheat in the aftertaste. I would disagree with those reviewers who think this tastes like orange soda, it never really gets very sweet. Pretty good summer beer. Recommended."
"D: Nah, a bomber is way to much of this one, three ounces is too much to be honest."
"As you except this first sip your taste buds pick up the wheat that is well masked behind the citrus storm. The citrus tingles the tongue as it rolls across and falls away. The head really doesn't have time to fade away into the glass because the beer in the glass isn't in there very long. This is a light drink that sit at only 5%, perfect for the hot summer day, one after another. This is also a great breakfast for those weekend mornings you want to start early."
"Drinkability- It was quenching, but really didn't come anywhere near hitting the mark. Would not really recommend."
"Drinkability is good. This is a refreshing and easy to drink ""summer like"" beer. Especially nice on a really warm day. But I wouldn't want more than a couple."
"Pours a hazy light orange with decent, yet fizzy head. Smell, as you would have guessed, is all tangerine or orange. Taste is about the same. Taste like you would guess, a wheat beer with tangerine flavoring. I do have to say I dont mind an orange slice in a hefe every now and then and this was similar to that, just similar though. Mouthfeel was light and crisp due to the high carbonation. Overall I cant say this was terrible, but I probabyl wont seek it out again. I think if they toned down the tangerine and added some body to it, it could be a great beer."
"Drinkability: Has very high easy drinkability with little resistance to any flavor that isn't tangerine. Honestly disappointed with this beer since Lost Cost makes it. Think about using this beer to make punch at parties to add a kick to it or use it for baking."
"As other reviewers have stated, it may be very simple, very orange soda like in its character, but give it dues for its drinkability."
"A beer for people that don't really like malt or hops, pretty close to an orange soda in all respects. Not really for Beer Aficionados."
"Very drinkable, the strong suit of this beer. Would be very quaffable on a hot day, but wasn't quite what was looking for on a cold, it's-spring-why-is-it-snowing night."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. Not my styles, ie fruit and wheat. But I would love this beer in the summer. I might even bring a growler of it to the golf course."
"It looked alright to start. Appeared pale yellow and had a very nice white head that lasted considerably longer than I expected. It only went away towards the bottem of the glass. The smell was of tangerine extract, definitely not fresh tangerine, and it completely masked any scent of beer. The taste was another step away from beer, as it tasted entirely like tang. The carbonation helped this out a bit and made it seem a little more like soda, but nothing could make this actually seem like a beer after such an intense fruit smell and taste. It may be easily quaffable if you aren't looking for beer to drink, but for me, I like my beer to taste a little like beer."
"had on-tap in a pint glass, appearance was a dark hazy orange color with a small head. has a strong fruity tangerine aroma to it. tastes pretty much like it smells, has a strong sweet tangerine flavor. mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth tasting. im not a big fan of this type of beer but this one was really refreshing and would probably try it again on a hot summer day."
"Arrived at my table a mildly cloudy orange with a scant 1/4 inch head. Smells of.. tangerines and more tangerines. Very dominant tangerine flavor. Slightly sweet and and then bitter. The citrus tangerine flavor overpowers everything else. Mouthfeel is crisp and moderately carbonated. This is a smooth drinking beer and although it's now November, I can see myself enjoying a few of these if I should happen upon it on draft again in the summer. Quite thirst quenching."
"Overall- A candy tasting beer. Not bad if you're going to drink half a pint. Novelty!!"
"D: I'm not a big fan of fruit beers, but I have enjoyed Lost Coast's other offerings, Raspberry Brown and Apricot Wheat, those wern't too overpowering with the fruit taste. This one however was so fruity that it didn't even taste like beer."
