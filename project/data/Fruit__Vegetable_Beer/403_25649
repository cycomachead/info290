When first opened the aroma of fresh apricots hits your nose right up front with some wheat. Very nice! The taste was even better with just the right sweetness with good wheat to balance out the flavor. No bad aftertaste and goes down very easy. Available year around.","BeerWithMike","Nov 03, 2013"

The aroma of this ale was full of fruity apricot and peach- Light in body, this beer had a base of malted grain, sweet apricot and peach nectar. There is a somewhat of a sour , medicinal taste that is not well balanced. The aroma of this brew is quite appealing, packs a very nice punch but the apricot flavor does not follow the lead.

Good-smelling beer full of apricot, peach and maybe dates. Sounds like a pretty good Jolly Rancher flavor. Plenty of flavor in first sip. Apricot is the first thing that comes to mind whether that is the case or not. Seems to be a terrific summer brew, but not something you’re going to order all night at a bar. Really a good combination of not too wheaty, not too fruity. Fairly carbonated. Pretty good beer overall.

The nose comprises wheat, flowers, and fake peach. I suppose the peach could actually have been apricot, but it certainly seemed more like peach to me. The taste brings nothing new to the table, and the "apricot" flavor not only comes off as more fake, but also more armpit-influenced. Boo.

4,17,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very solid two finger head into a wheat glass, the head is completely white and very pillowy and creamy. It's hanging around for a bit as well, not skimping away too fast, it's leaving pretty good lacing as well. The body is pretty impressive (considering some of the wheat beers I have had lately) it's very very cloudy, and there is not much visibility coming through this beer at all, it is a really solid looking wheat beer. I'm shocked at how well this head is sticking around, I really am. The carbonation looks about medium-high, maybe too high, we'll see about that. The color on the body is slightly darker than a traditional wheat beer, but held up to the light it looks standard - a cloudy orange. Overall I'm really impressed with the way this beer looks, the head has finally died down, but it gave me a lot more than most beers do. I've had this beer before and I don't remember it looking this good, I'm close to giving it a 4.5 on appearance, but I don't think it's quite there. The smell is very simple, fresh apricots and a little wheat, not much in the way of malts are hops, if there is much in here it's not noticeable. The smell is very nice and it smells very refreshing, pretty one sided with the apricot, but I don't think I'll mind, it smells really good. Well this is a thousand times better than I remember it being, maybe it's just because I haven't had a wheat beer in a while, but this is really hitting the spot. There is a slight cheap beer taste to it, but other than that it's pretty dang good. It's just really really really tasty and refreshing, maybe slightly over powering with the apricot, but I don't mind that much at all, it's a fruity beer, just like it should be. Not much in the way of hops, maybe a tiny tiny malt note in there. Overall it's really simple, but very refreshing and easy drinking. Mouthfeel is good on this beer too, I could tell by how cloudy it was that it wasn't going to be skimping out on the wheat, and it really didn't! The mouthfeel is full and the body is big and full of wheat, carbonation is not too big, a little on the high side, but it works in the beer. Drinkability is through the roof on this beer, it's tasty and refreshing, and only 5.1%. I'm not a huge fan of Pyramid, but this was a really solid beer.

Mouthfeel is round, creamy, and soft. American wheat ales are pretty neutral on their own, but they do make for a nice canvas for other flavors, especially bright assertive ones, as with the apricot in this case.

Drying aftertaste with mild american hop bitterness and possible grapefruit rind hop charcter and light tropical fruit phenols lingering breifly. Very crisp and refreshing mouthfeel, with a light body that shows some texture from the fruit pulp. Finishes with a touch of weizen yeast and not overly sweet; only of hint of apricot remaining.

It offers a beautiful nose of sweet apricot that's remarkably authentic (although I'm sure it's from extract). The body is a bit hazy, and has a golden-orange color similar to that of an apricot. The creamy white head holds fairly well before dropping to a wide collar, and it leaves some spots and splashes of lace behind it. In the flavor, the same apricot fruitiness returns, and it's just gently sweet and not overdone. Some malt flavor backs it, and it's perfectly balanced by a firm bitterness that's just enough to keep it "beer", and leave it dry and refreshing. Some mild apricot flavor lingers in the aftertaste, nagging at you to take another sip. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth - again, kind of like an apricot - with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation and medium body.

It's actually better then it could have been. The flavor is filled with apricots, but it tastes like beer rather then some sweet concoction.

Simple aromas came from the glass  lots of apricots, wheat grains, and wisps of hops. A beer that is what the label states. The flavors were just as the aromas, fresh picked apricots, some sweet malts, wheat grain tones, some sugar, and citrus hops from beginning to the end. Aftertaste was light.

It's a sugary, honeyed nectar with enough wheat to make the beer cuttingly refreshing, despite its abundant sweetness. But on the whole, it basically tastes like sucking down the syrup out of a tin of apricots. I suppose it might work in a dessert setting, and it could probably be used in a killer recipe, but it completely fails in scratching that beer itch with which we are all familiar. I will say this, in defense of fruit beers: apricots (and peaches, pears, squash, pumpkin, and apples, for that matter) work much better with beer flavors than berries -- or cherries. It's just a better marriage... or it could just be a personal preference. Dogfish Head made a good beer with Aprihop, which succesfully married the sweetness of the apricot with the citric bitterness of the hops. It worked well, and I would recommend that one over Pyramid's abundantly sweet version. However, if you're an apricot nut with a severe sweet tooth, or some sort of bee or fruit fly, you will probably prefer the Pyramid.","Thrasher","Sep 27, 2004"

No lacing is apparent. Smell is of apricot flavoring with a malty warmth that barely tickles the nose. Not too impressive. The taste is thankfully somewhat better. With the same sweet, yet odd, apricot taste in the forefront. There is a decent bready backbone here and a finish of citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is likewise refreshing, and the low-ish carbonation level allows a nice, though hardly complex, suite of flavors to be expressed.

A slightly sour finish was surprising, as I figured all the apricot would be too sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, even for the wheat beer that this is based upon. However, the very fine bubbles of the carbonation help offset the thinness a bit. The drinakbility is good, but I don't think I'd want too many of these.

3.3,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"When poured, it had a hazy reddish golden color with very little foam. The smell was of apricots and malts, with a hint of hops. The flavor of apricot dominated the taste, mixed with malts and citrus. The sweetness that was supplied by the malts and citrus. The correct bitterness supplied by the hops, which balance out this fruity beer was interesting! Must try it just once at least!","BeerManDan","Dec 09, 2002"
3.38,-1.2,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Pours a lovely hazy golden color with a creamy white head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is dominated by fresh apricot. Taste is sweet malts with fruity notes of apricot, banana, and citrus. Finish is crisp with a bit of a sweet aftertaste. A very refreshing brew that would make a great summertime beer.","Morris729","Nov 06, 2002"

2.28,-33.3,3,2.5,2,3,2,"Pours a reasonably attractive apricot color, slightly cloudy with a sparse head and persistent yet sparse carbonation.  Aroma is dominated by apricot scents.  Where is the beer?  The taste does not answer that question either, as the sweet apricot taste overwhelms the underlying wheat.  Only toward the end does one get a hint of a little dryness--too little, too late.  Mouthfeel is fine, but drinkability is poor for a beer.  This might be a fine drink, but it's not a fine beer.","BitteBier","Aug 28, 2002"

2.57,-24.9,3,3.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Let's see. I like beer. I dislike apricots. Apparently I dislike apricots more than I like beer. Hazy apricot color with minimal head. Points for color that matches the flavor though. I am generally not a fan of fruit beers.","Dogbrick","Jul 11, 2002"

3.68,7.6,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Pyramid Apricot: Cloudy, tan beer.  Aroma is nothing but Apricots.  Taste is surprisingly well balanced, and the apricot does not overwhelm the rest of the beer, at all.  Fairly highly carbonated, with a sweet aftertaste. This is a shock, a fruit beer that I do not hate.  Worth a look.","jackndan","Apr 16, 2002"

3.37,-1.5,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Murky, chunky bright orange color.  Fast rising small bubbles that keep restoring a thin head.  Smells like, well, apricot.... Flavor is more subtly apricot, with a carbonated impression that releases the most at the back of the swallow. There was a carbonated water impression to me in mid-mouth.  Wheat tastes are minimal and just the slightest of bittering at the finish.  A controlled fruit beer but I can't highly recommend it because of the carbonated water taste.  I honestly prefer this directly from the bottle, it seems to concentrate the apricot flavors (if fruit is your thing).","ADR","Oct 15, 2001"

4.84,41.5,4,5,5,4,5,"Very nice apricot aroma - like fresh juice had been added to the ale.  The fruit element is well balanced, lending a softly sweet, fruity note without taking on the candy/soda pop sweetness I seem to find in most fruit flavored ales.   A good choice as a pre-meal drink.","Brent","0"
