"Decent beer, I enjoyed the novelty"

"This is easily the worst beer I've ever had! And for the price!!! Never again will I buy ANY voodoo series beers!"
"Light bodied, thinner mouthfeel.  Overall, this is a unique dessert beer.  A bit on the sweet side just like the whole voodoo doughnut line of beers, but that's ok, it would taste worse if this were highly hopped."
"looked and smelled good, but had zero body, and a horrible taste"
"Glad I only got one."

"Banana esters, peanut butter in aroma. Chocolate, with lightly fruity notes. Flavor is similar, with a bitter finish. There's an off fruity and floral tone. Peanut butter lingers in aftertaste."

"The Voodoo is an interesting beer to say the least. The beer poured an opaque dark with thin ecru head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent carried Hershey like chocolate and banana bread....not getting much peanut butter. The taste was mostly weak chocolate. The mouthfeel was light in body (which for this beer style I would prefer a medium to fuller body) with smooth carbonation. Overall its interesting...and not over the top."

"I popped off the ""oxygen-fixing"" cap and gave each of us a generous pour. Following the pseudo-cascade, I had a finger of light-tan head with decent retention. Color was a solid dark-brown (SRM = 44), although they identified it as 75 Lovibond. I have a handle on SRM, so I am not going to try to learn Lovibond unless I have to. Nose definitely gave off banana esters, but accompanied by a maple syrup and an odd fried-doughnut quality. I was now gearing up for unrelenting sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was sweet, all right, but chocolate and banana were about it. Finish was likewise sweet and the peanut butter made a brief appearance at the end, but it might as well have had an asterisk next to it on the label for as much as it mattered. A definite novelty."

"i appreciate the innovation and the idea, and the other two of these have been downright delicious and well done, but this one is a bit of a miss. some age on the bottle, so maybe my banana has faded, but i didnt taste it at all. worse, i didnt get any peanut butter, maybe a slight generic nuttiness, but nothing but a greasy texture and some sweet malt on this for me. chocolate yes, its all in the nose and finish, but the sweet grain makes it tough to appreciate all the way. i get no banana whatsoever, not even from the yeast, which may have been the best way to get those esters in here. worse yet, its alcoholic and not even that strong, it stings and it stinks, i just dont care for it. as it finishes i get a little more of the peanut butter, but its not really compatible like it is in other beers that have come around. its contrived, not real genuine, and just a sloppy mess of flavors that never gel. it may have been better when it first came out, but its well past being reasonable. i will likely keep buying these beers, only out of curiosity, but this is the worst of the three by far."

"Overall, not awful, but I don't think I'd get this beer again. But I know whenever Rogue does a new Voodoo Doughnut beer, I'll be sure to try it out of curiosity."
""
""
"O- Judging by the ratings, I didn't have high hopes for this one, but I actually liked it. The mouthfeel was the only thing holding it back, as it was way to thin. Still enjoyable overall."

"Ok pours a nice dark brown with a thick head. Initial smell is a little sweet. Not a strong smell so I take another whiff and the first thought is that the smell is off putting. A big turn off. Smell is very artificial. Taste has no sweetness at all. I can't detect any banana, peanut butter or chocolate. Then I look at the label and it says ""donut"". Then I try to imagine this beer as a donut. Starts to make a little sense but I can't get over the off putting/ artificial smell. The smell is very familiar similar to a Wells beer. The only thing going for this is the cool pink painted bottle. This beer is not worth the $10 I paid."

"O: The banana is very overpowering. I would like to have seen more chocolate. One of the worst beers I've had. This was a drain pour!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I expected more from this beer because it has been talked about around here for the past few months and I was let down a little bit. Not a bad beer but not great."
""
""
""
"Drinking this straight out of the fridge, it's extremely 'closed' and bitter. But let that bugger sit for 10-15 minutes and it's like drinking a Saturday morning. The flavors come alive and mix quite well. The mouthfeel is there initially but dissipates quickly and the end does come across as a tad 'watery' but I still feel this is a good, interesting beer to try. I wouldn't drink it all the time, but I could certainly drink it on occasion."
""

"I can't say this beer is very good, especially coming from rogue, but it was *interesting*. Wouldn't bother drinking it again."

"Overall: Its a good different taste and i would recommend it to the chocolate banana lover. overall i liked it and would drink it again, different but unique, in a good way."
"O: I am really going against the tide with this rating, but I really liked it. Was it disappointing? Yes. Can I see why some might find the idea of it disgusting? Yes. Ultimately I feel like the flavors just weren't strong enough and didn't blend right. I still enjoyed the beer."
""
""
"Overall, I like it. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I wouldn't turn it down."
"Overall, the beer is kind of a train wreck, but it is so interesting and all over the place that it was at least fun to review. But I'm not sure they got the ingredients right at all. Peanut butter was missing and the banana tasted more like strawberries. Oops."

"This pours a dark brown color with a brown, foamy head. The aroma is a mixture of cocoa and peanut butter. The overall taste is very malty mixed with some cocoa flavors. It finishes with a chalky after taste. An interesting style and advertised ingredients but it could taste a lot better."

"Overall: I think this is the first time I have actually been tempted to break my no-drain-pour rule. This beer easily takes the prize for the worst beer from a craft brewery that I have come across."

"Poured into a Pint glass showed a beautiful brown/black Ale, small tan head on the second pour which left nice lace but went away quickly. The aroma was banana before pouring...chocolate after being poured and on the second pour was chocolate banana mix, taste went a little on the same lines with chocolate coming out first and stronger banana on the second pour with bitter chocolate as a finish. Mouthfeel was medium and more like a Stout than a Ale but since chocolate is in this I guess one should see that coming, low carbanation also sways to a Stout style. Overall the fact that I never got any peanutbutter in this was kind of a let down, really enjoyed the maple bacon offering and always wait for the flavors to come out as it warms...while as a whole this got better as it warmed but no peanutbutter ever surfaced."

"O-I am actually disappointed with Rogue. It's one thing to make a bad beer, it's another to get our hopes up with such an itruiging name. It's not as if it's a terrible beer, but it's definitely not worth buying."
""
""
"I tasted this blind, and have a feeling this will be right up there with my most positive deviations from the norm. But I found this an outstandingly idiosyncratic beer. Amazing flavours just socking you all right up in your tastebuds. No regrets. No complaints."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I appreciate the attempt at innovation, but this endeavor was a tall order to say the least. It's hardly a success by my account, but few would have succeeded given the demands. Voodoo Doughnut is the epitome of a novelty beer."
""
""
"Make no mistake: this is a novelty beer that's probably not worth the asking price but the contents of the bottle are not entirely wretched; there are far more gimmicky ales out there and, considering the blatant use of artificial (sorry, ""natural"") flavours, this could be so much worse. Still, Rogue makes beers that are so much better - spend your money on those, not this."
""
""
""
"Overall- I thought this was a pretty decent beer. It was a bit tough to down a whole 22oz bomber, but in smaller samples I would drink this beer again. I appreciate the originality and creativity of it."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep dark color ale with a small dark brown foamy head with almost no retention. Aroma of light peanut butter notes with some fake banana syrup notes is not the most pleasant. Taste is also dominated by gross banana notes with light peanut butter notes with quite a bit of residual sugars. Body is light with light carbonation. Too much banana notes for its own good and also too sweet for my own taste buds."

"Dark brown - almost cola - in color. Sparse head that sits like a film on top of the beer. Aroma is not very inviting. The combo of chocolate, banana, and peanut butter sounds good on paper, but becomes a garbled mess. Throw in some licorice to boot and I am suddenly not interested at all. Very thin textured and not enough carbonation which ruins the mouthfeel for me. Metallic finish. This beer could probably benefit from a bigger malt profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is, umm, weird. I get more of the peanut butter, some banana, and only a hint of the chocolate. An interesting novelty taste -- not altogether offensive or unfaithful to the premise, but certainly not a beer with lasting value or drinkability."
""
""
""
"Worst tasting beer I have has in quite some time. Not putrid or vile enough to drain pour but it sure tries hard. Kind of makes you wonder if they are even tasting this stuff before going public."
""
"Overall – This was really quite an enjoyable novelty brew. While somewhat artificial in banana, it had a nice candy like smell and flavor that melded well with the darker and roasted doughnut like characteristics of the brew. While I was not a fan of the Voodoo Doughnut Maple Bacon ale, the Voodoo Doughnut Chocolate banana and peanut butter ale is delicious and even although it is rather overpriced it is one you should likely try at least once."
"I really wanted to like this beer, but between the acrid roastiness and the intense hoppiness on the finish, it was a rather tough session. At its pricepoint, this should have been far better."
""
""
""
""
"I enjoy this very much and it one of my normal drinker."

"O- I don't know what exactly they brewed with to get these flavors...but what the hell? If you stripped off the chocolate and peanut from the label, I wouldn't even know they were supposed to be represented. What a mess."

"750 ml bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stayed around for a while. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like milk chocolate, peanut butter, roasted malt and some banana. It tastes like milk and bittersweet chocolate, banana, peanut butter, burnt/charred malt and a bit of caramel. I do think the chocolate flavor is stronger compared to the banana and peanut butter. It does lean more towards being a sweeter tasting brew than a bitter, roasty one. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. Overall I liked this, I wouldn't mind trying it again in the future. It's certainly a unique beer, and it's definitely worth trying if you've never had it before."
"Overall: boo indeed. I quite enjoyed the Maple Bacon beer, despite what everyone else seemed to think of it. But this is piss-poor: this is thin, fakely flavoured and weak without any integration or any particular thought put to it. Very uninspiring stuff."
""
""
""
"I'm sad about this beer. I wanted to think that people are dumb and are just drinking the haterade. But this isn't a good beer. I wouldn't drink again. It's thin and comes off as fake. They should sweeten the beer a bit, and maybe use more chocolate, more peanut butter, and less banana. That's my recommendation."
""
""
""
"There's no banana , or peanut buttertast1 tastes like a big tootsie roll- I splurged and bought a pretty bottle beer and I was craving peanut butter chocolate and banana- gonna keep the bottle or a keepsake. Now that I type over the mug on my laptop, I smmell the banana. Would not buy again,,,sorry!"
""
""
"Not the worst beer I have ever tasted. But definitely didn't deliver on the flavors promised by the bright pink bottle. I was hoping for more!"
""
""
"O: it's pretty unpleasant, the appearance and mouthfeel are good, the banana flavor is like a sour laffy taffy rolled in self lighting charcoal dust"
""
""

"750 ml bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, banana, toffee, light peanut butter, toast, bread, and toasted earthiness. Ok aromas with interesting balance of malt, banana, and light peanut butter notes; smells pretty artificial, but has good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, toast, banana, toffee, bread, light peanut butter, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, banana, toast, light peanut butter, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a bit. Pretty solid balance and robustness of malt and extract flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid experimental flavored beer. Ok balance and robustness of malt and extract flavors; and smooth to drink. A fairly enjoyable offering."

"I should have known.... In the immortal words of George W. Bush: ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice....we, um....we won't be fooled again."" I personally found the first Voodoo Doughnut beer beyond disappointing, I should have known to be wary. I'm aware this is a rather harsh review, but when a company puts so much effort into marketing a beer like this, and then with the rather exorbitant price tag associated with it, the consumer is in a position to be brutally honest after buying the ticket and taking the trip. Lesson learned Rogue, twice bitten with this series...."
""
""
""

"I hope they get this right after last tragedy and it pours a dark dirty brown hue with a creamy two finger head that slowly resides to a a smog of cloud across the top and a rim of lacing to match,the smell is basically an even mix of bananna,chocolate,peanut butter and the slightest hint of bubblegum,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied and way over carbonated making the mouthfeel rather rough and all I get on taste is an artificial blend of bananna,chocolate and peanut butter finished off with a herbal green cocoa bean bittersweetness and overall you guys gave proven your point what may make a sensational donought does not necessarily make a good beer please quit while your behind and u waste any more money cheers."

"This beer was a little disappointing. It was very pricey an d did not measure to what I thought it was going to be. I expected a journey through bananas and Pb doughnuts. It was weak. I would definitely not buy it again. I was a one time gimmick. I like the bottle though."

"Pours a dark cola like brown with a two finger khaki color head. The head gives way to edging and fingers of lace. The aroma is of dark chocolate with a hint of peanut butter than a ripe banana smell. The taste follows suit. Up front is deep chocolate taste with a little toasty taste. There is a slight peanut butter flavor before banana takes over at the end. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated and creamy. Overall it was interesting...the flavor profile swirls around from sip to sip. It is worth a try but only one try."
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, lighter effervescence. Weirdly, I think I would prefer this beer without the additions of chocolate, etc. Poor execution on this one. Maple Bacon Doughnut was great, had hoped this would be close. Rogue screwed up again."
""
""
"O- A fun experiment, but not a repeater. Wish the peanut butter was more available. Very good, chocolate taste. Almost like drinking a banana flavored dark chocolate bar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste ruined it for me. It has a very metallic taste to it. This would have been so delicious as a stout. I don't feel as if I wasted my money on this, but I would not buy it again. Maybe halvesies with a buddy down the road."
"Not all I hoped, but not bad,, worth a try, needed at least 2% abv above what this is"
"Serving type: bottle"
""

""

"The smell was strong like a typical beer but you also sense a slight hint of chocolate. I was real curious about the chocolate, peanut butter, and banana combination which you can't find everyday. On the immediate taste you can sense the chocolate and banana combination which settles quite well with the lasting flavor of peanut butter. For a fruit flavored beer I wouldn't rank among my favorites which are cherry and tangerine so far in this category. I would recommend trying if you can find it. This is a seasonal special with est. 159 calories per and 5.3% ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Edit: I forgot to mention the tasty chocolate flavour I'm getting; very reminiscent of their Chocolate Stout. A saving grace?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: In theory, this could be a good beer if pulled off correctly. This, however, is more of a banana extract mixed with chocolate malt and a touch of peanut butter beer and really doesn't work. I'd like to see the peanut butter aspect come out a little more and have the banana taste real and not so much like extract. I enjoyed the other Voodoo beer. This one, not so much"
""
"Overall - Did not finish the bottle. Very disappointing."
""
"I was a fan of the first Voodoo Doughnut collaboration. But not this one. Too bitter, too much banana, not enough chocolate or PB."
""
""

"weird beer that doesn't taste bad, but fails at being what it describes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"1.0 D: This beer is so shitty and so ungodly expensive that I can only assume that whoever brewed it and whoever priced it are going to be sitting in it someday in Satan's bathhouse. It should be obvious that I would never buy it again. I wouldn't even accept a free bottle. Hell, I wouldn't even accept a free bottle if it came with a good local sixer if it meant I had to drink this again. The only redeeming aspect of this beer is that it scratched my curiosity itch, albeit at great cost."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It was difficult to keep perspective on this one. It was a bit of a mess and extremely sweet, but in some ways that conflicting flavours and the almost cloying sweetness were intended by the brewery. That said, I think the flavour integration could have been much better."
"O: Overall the beer was decent, but nothing to write home about. There are better chocolate, banana, and peanut butter beers out there, that taste better than the beer individually. That being said, the chocolate flavor in the beer is very nice, it's just not quite there yet. If you are a chocolate lover, I think you could enjoy this beer if you aren't expecting much of anything else."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A serious misfire from a brewery that I can usually rely on for rock-solid beers. It's still beer, I'll still drink it and enjoy the act of drinking beer, but it doesn't taste very nice and there's a great deal of it in this obnoxious bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O - I had hoped this beer would be better than the Maple Bacon Ale. I was wrong. It started out good until the second drink. It tastes like chocolate dish soap. How can two beers with such great sounding ingredients be so bad? Rogue has a lot better beers than this."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a dark mahogany brown with a healthy two finger light brown head with great retention and massive lacing. Interesting sweet aroma of milk chocolate, stone fruit juice, hints of peanut butter and bananas, quite estery. Flavor is mild chocolate, nuts, vanilla, hint of banana, finishes drier with toasted malt and light hop bitterness. Light bodied with decent carbonation. Like the last Voodoo, this was a beer that for the first time in my life, I really wanted a paper bag to make sure that no one saw me buying it. And like the last one, I approached with trepidation but still found it an interesting, if not great ale. This tastes like a decent chocolate ale that has been watered down and blended with a light lager. You can almost taste decent ingredients crying to assert themselves. Kudos to Rogue for trying to push the envelope, but I can't help but think that this could have been better with a more substantial (dark and toasted malt) body, to support the sweet flavors. I had a good time drinking this because Rogue pretty much shows you what you're going to get with the label and the flavors were fun and interesting if rather thin and attenuated. Still definitely a one and done. Will I be tempted by the next version of the pink bottle again? Sadly, probably yes."
""
""
""
""
"I cannot believe they are charging roughly $13 for this beer, and I cannot believe someone in that company thought it was a good decision to release it at that price point. For the price alone, this beer is atrocious, and I have never been so glad to not have paid for a beer in all my life. I have one bottle left, and I am giving away to my neighbor."
""
""
""
""
"I think so many people were let down by the Bacon Maple ale that they decided to write this one off before even trying it. If you go into a beer assuming it's going to taste like shit, then it'll probably taste like shit. This beer wasn't exactly ""good"" and it's not something I would go out and get again, but it was drinkable and it was different, and it was about six thousand times better than the Bacon Maple ale."
""
""
"Overall- I was not impressed by this beer. Voodoo Doughnut Maple Bacon Ale was much better than this. Rogue needs to tone down the cocoa and increase the banana and peanut butter flavors to make this better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the beer seems deeply divided, offering on the one hand a nice set of sweet dessert notes that, while offering few traditional beer flavors, are still tasty; and on the other hand, a bitter, citrusy, and grassy thread that wouldn’t be out of place in a light IPA. The problem is that these flavor sets would be decent by themselves, but don’t work together, and the beer feels like it needed to make up its mind whether it wanted to be a dessert beer, or a lightly-hopped pilsner."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the kind of beer that is hard to review because it is both so strange and so bad that words cannot do it justic. I was not expecting to be wowed by this beer, but I at least expected to find something enjoyable about it. Sadly, I couldn't find a single redeeming characteristic. It looks odd, smells odd, tastes odd, and feels odd-in other words, it's an odd bird. I'll give the brewers at Rogue a few points for creativity and bravery here, but unfortunately that's all I can do. If awkward could be fermented and bottled, it would be this beer or something really close to it."
"O - I think I'll continue to be an outlier on the review of the Voodoo Doughnut series. Certainly the peanut butter was a tad underwhelming, but the banana sweetness did come through and was very complementary to the chocolate notes. It's a porter with a unique banana sweetness and a touch of nuttiness. I suspect if they weren't as ambitious in the description of the beer (forcing the drinkers to expect a blast of banana and peanut butter) the reviews would be a lot higher. Nowhere near deserving of the poor reviews, and if given the opportunity I would try it again."
"I got a chance to try this at a friends house and while I know the person who brought it was trolling I am pretty sure Rogue is trolling beer geeks by making this. It was a truly awful beer. Dark brown, almost looked like a stout. Aroma was just off, none of the featured ingredients were present, eww. Flavor was quite bad, hints of chocolate but mostly just yuck. I would never drink this beer again, shame on you Rogue."

"Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Chocolate, Peanut Butter, & Banana Ale---3.5/5"
""
""
""
"Drainpour."
"Voodoo Doughnut Chocolate Banana & Peanut Butter ale rests on the taste buds in identical fashion of Tootsie Roll candies (wax wrapping and all)! As fascinating and fun as the beer it- it sorely suffers from trying to resemble beer. It tries to be hopped, it tries to be dry in finish, it tries to be drinkable. Rogue would be better of getting out of the beer's way and letting the rich textures and overwhelming flavor additions shine."
""
"Overall I dont understand all the hate for the Voodoo Doughnut series. Both have been accurate to their names and a new beer experience. Worth a shot as long as the price isnt outrageous."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a little banana but mostly overpowered by the chocolate taste. I'd rather drink a southern tier blackwater series than this. Not a very good beer. Waste of $9 if you ask me."
"Drinkability – This is better than I expected, although I like their Chocolate Stout much better."
""
""
""
""
"O - always respect to Rogue for pushing boundaries, and every once in a while it just doesn't come together, the chocolate flavour is there but banana and PB are nowhere to be found"
""
""
""
"Complete waste of money. With real ingredients, it's a possibility. With extracts, it's a waste of water. It's hard to drink, it tastes like crap, and the ABV is so low you feel everything. Sadly, I've got a whole bomber to finish."
""
""
""
"Not going to give a blow by blow review, as this beer does not deserve one. It says quite plainly on the label that all the stated flavors come from extract, and this shows very clearly in the taste. Extremely chalky and artificial on the palate. While it might still be bad, I could have at least appreciated a beer that used chocolate malt, hefe yeast, and then some PB in secondary fermentation. This is just... well lazy. On the plus side I now have a pink bottle to add to my collection. Glad I was at least able to split this among several others."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, ruby highlighted brown coloring with a dense, frothy, light tan head that starts around an inch, but settles in to a thin quarter inch layering. Aromas of chocolate syrup, both rich and sugary, with subtle banana notes and a hint of peanut butter. The chocolate really takes over the nose. Banana flavors are almost candy-like, with a weak chocolate syrup character and only hints of peanut butter here and there. Very awkward on the palate, and the flavors overpower the watery thin body. The aftertaste is candy-sweet once again, and the cloying sweetness lingers through past the quick, watery finish. This beer was a neat idea, but it really is all over the place."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an interesting concept, but it'd didn't translate well. The banana was overpowering and seemed artificial. The peanut butter was present but underwhelming. The most interesting flavor was the chocolate which tasted like an odd type of chocolate ice cream. Overall, I'll give it points for uniqueness, but this was not pleasing at all. The flavors didn't mesh. It was like drinking an over-ripened banana split with weird ice cream. I'll pass in the future."
"O: This beer seems like it could use a heavier body because the banana and chocolate flavors don't seem integrated with the rest of the beer and just tastes like a light beer with some syrup flavorings added in at the end."
"O: I probably would not recommend this beer to anyone (and I did not hate the Voodoo Maple Bacon beer) because the smell and flavors are just too artificial. Not easy to drink and not very enjoyable - I would recommend avoiding it."
""
"Overall: I couldn't recommend it. I wanted to like this beer, but it wasn't well-executed at all. Needed to be darker, maltier, and more chocolaty. And where was the peanut butter?"
""
""
"Overall - Another creative entry for the adventurous palate by Rogue. Not as good as the last Voodoo brew, but it's not bad. I find the flavours are off balance - a lot of chocolate, some banana, and a hint of PB. Worth a try for novelty purposes."
""

"I'll say I liked the ""other"" pink version better, but overall this was not terrible. Gimmicky? Maybe. Awful? No. Obviously I knew what it was before I tried it and as a beer lover, enjoyed it for what it is. Not many others are attempting this (probably for a good reason) but I do applaud the effort of trying something out of the norm. Definitely enjoyed the experience and the thought-provoking it produced."

"I had a peanut butter sandwich for lunch today, so I'm recently versed in that particular flavour, and buster (heh), it ain't here. However, the banana and chocolate do well enough to represent, but the overall effect is too busy, too scattered, and too askew to take as anything more than a novelty. Like the previous Voodoo Doughnut incarnation, I'm likely above average in my rating, but that's mostly because I don't think this, as strange as it is, warrants rubbing elbows with the true 'poor' beers out there."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a strange one, would have been better without the banana but I know that's not the point. Prob love it or hate it, but I definitely didn't like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a decent beer, interestingly flavored when the flavors can be picked out. I would stay away from this one again at the $16/bottle price point, too expensive for a not-particularly-memorable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"At $14 per bottle this one might be worth a pass in my book, Rouge has much better selection available year-round."
"M&D&O - overall the beer is NOT bad. It just seems a little chemically, which detracts from the beer for me. My friends both enjoyed it. I was a little disappointed, but not heartbroked. I did like Maple Bacon better. Excited for the next voodoo."
"Overall, disappointed the flavours were so synthetic and hidden. It feels like I'm tasting a cheap brown ale with a strong hoppy bitterness. I was expecting an ""Elvis' favourite sandwich"" beer and got a weak watery brew instead, so no, I would not have it again nor recommend it; I just hope Rogue makes better novelty beers in the future."

"The beer pours like dark chocolate milk, or dark roast coffee. The beer pours with a massive sandy head on top. The bubbles are creamy on the surface, but quite rocky beneath, leaving a sticky thick ring of lacing and lots of webs running down from that. The beer’s body is too dark to penetrate with the eye. On the nose, this beer smells like plastic banana chocolate. There are touches of chemical green apple in the nose as well. Really, this beer smells fake and chemically. The chocolate does lay a nice layer beneath the rest of the smells, and is thick and rich, but the other smells are really quite gross. On the tongue, this beer tastes watery with definite plastic notes. Sweet and bitter. The flavor begins as sweet chemicals, moving into a thick chocolate flavor briefly before washing into a watery taste that mixes bananas and chemical flavors in a slurry. A slight cocoa chocolate flavor brushes through the finish, but is not very long lasting. For part of this taste, the beer is pleasant, and then it gets really gross, and then it’s okay and then its gross again. This is certainly a weird beer, but overall I think it’s gross. It’s worth a try, but you should split this thing among a large group. In the mouth, this beer feels thin to medium in body with a light touch of dry roast. The beer leaves the mouth with a lot of astringent chemicals on the sides and back of the throat. Overall, this beer is weird, just like it promised to be. I really am not a fan of it, especially the chemical flavors that I get from it, but there are some strangely redeeming flavors present in this beer, and they make me keep sipping. This beer tastes horrible, but it isn’t a drain pour."
"O= I don't know why people hate these beers. I think it's just fun to hate Rogue because they trick people into buying their beers by making new names for them. That and their yeast is a little sketchy for me. But these beers are fun. They collaborate with a famous local doughnut shop and make some beers that I would never have thought possible. Yeah it may not be a everyday drinker or maybe even a repurchase but they are fun beers. I like them and this is no exception."
"O--not a drainpour but definitely not a re buy. Glad to have tried it though, since, as like po k mon, you gotta have em all!"

"I'll steer far clear of this pink bottle of sadness and regret in the future."

"Voodoo Doughnut chocolate, banana, peanut butter ale pours a black color with a small lacing head that was withstanding. There is a sweet aroma, with strong peanut butter and banana. The taste had strong peanut butter flavors, with strong hints of banana, with just hints of the chocolates. Drinkable, but has a strange linger after taste, the peanut butter sticks out a little too much. Overall a strange beer, very very unique, it has to be worth a try just for being weird."
"O: Well, this is leaps and bounds better than the first voodoo ale - I drain poured that one instantly. It was undrinkable campfire ashes. This one just has some marginal and slightly unpleasant adjunct flavors in it. It generally resembles what they were going for so I have to give them points there. Having said that, is it good? No. Is it $15 good? Not only no, but hell no. It would be worth trying as an experiment for about a dollar. At this price point only loonies will buy it (present and accounted for)."
""
""
"O - this is the kind of shit that will make me never buy another Rogue beer again. I mean, cool for the experimentation, but who in the f at QC let this one be bottled? I feel completely ripped off for spending $13 on this bottle of waste. Instant drain pour."

"A bomber of Voodoo Donut Chocolate, Peanut Butter, and Banana ale, served in a pink painted bomber from Rogue. Pours a rich Carmel brown with a creamy head; the nose left a bit to be desired as all I was able to detect was a light scent of cocoa, peanuts, and roasted grain. The most unfortunate aspect of this brew was the taste. Bitter, dry, with the acidic sour taste that you find in burnt coffee, this beer embodies none of the elements that you find in a tasty brown ale. I appreciate this offering as a bold and even risky gamble, but there needs to have been a head at Rogue who spoke up and called this formula for what it was and continues to be: a disappointment."

"O: better than the maple bacon doughnut version but not an outstanding beer. I'd say it's pretty average. I applaud them for daring to be different but they need to make a better product."
""
"How the hell could I resist? This stuff pours a brackish black-brown topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises chocolate-covered bananas. Straight up. Good times. The taste, though, leads with a strong sense of rubbery vinyl, tempered only by a wave of bitter chocolate-ish-ness. Wow. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, just like the first Voodoo Doughnut brew, things smell pretty tasty, but they end up tasting sub-par. In this case, though, things went further downhill than before. Still worth the shot, though."
""
"O - I loved the first Voodoo doughnut brew, and I thought the concept for this one was interesting, but it just fell flat on its face. I'm not sure if they used an extract or tried to add something artificial for the banana flavor, but whatever it was it went completely haywire."
""
"Pours a deep amber to brown in color with a tan head. In the aroma, sugary banana with faint notes of peanut butter and chocolate. In the taste, dry banana and underlying flavors of peanut butter and chocolate in the end. A small bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry banana skin and small peanut butter flavor in the aftertaste. Big banana all the way through, notes of chocolate and peanut butter, and a bit bit sticky."
""
""
"I'll take a Maple Bacon over this adventure any day and twice on Sunday. Time to move on."
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark brown, almost black, with little head an little retention. Still has decent lacing. Peanut butter & chocolate are evident in the nose, but I'm not picking up any banana. Follows through in taste. Goes down super sooth. No aftertaste. A solid stout. Not as sweet as the bacon maple edition. I like both, but I think the bacon maple version is superior."
"D - Interesting mix of flavors. Not quite balanced, but somewhat enjoyable."
"C"
""
"Like others have said this was a major disappointment. I was really looking forward to this one and couldn't get down a glass of this stuff. Looks amazing and had my hopes up immediately, the smell was different, but then the taste was... awful. The taste was very artificial and for $13 a bottle I was expecting so much more."
""
""
"I guess to each their own. I really loved this beer. It poured nice and dark like a stout with a nice latte like creamy brown head. The taste was quite different but very good. It kind of reminded me of when I make myself peanut butter banana protein shakes with chocolate protein powder. Overall I'd drink it again. I only docked half a point off the overall due to the price of this beer. 15 bucks for one bomber just seems a bit steep to me."
""
"Its good but not great. I don't feel like typing a full on review, but it was pretty chocolatey, slightly banana-y and basically no PB at all. It was pretty average. Much better than Maple Bacon, but nothing special (and nothing worth $15) but still pretty good."
""
""
"I expected that, if this beer were to miss, it would be on the cloyingly sweet side, but that wasn't it. This beer was just a potpourri of mismatched ingredients, in my opinion. And the $13 price tag? I'm kicking myself. I drank about 1/2 a pint before pouring the rest."
""
"On a plus note, the empty bottle smelled fantastic the next day."
"On a good note...I loved the bottle!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, banana, and a slight nutty aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that sounds good but is not executed very well with a flavor that is very mild and muted."
