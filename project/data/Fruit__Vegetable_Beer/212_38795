That being said, there's not a whole lot that makes me think ""beer"" when I drink this apart from the yeasty aftertaste, but I'm somehow still very entranced by the flavor and aroma qualities.  A great choice for when you want a beer, but don't want a beer at the same time - if that makes sense.  In a nutshell - Fun and uncomplicated.","KJHB","Mar 14, 2015"

While other beers in the fruit/lambic arena are more akin to wine coolers, this has some of the deep richness of a sweet deep red wine. the cherry flavor mixing with the donker makes for an excellently, drinkable, enjoyable beer. The fact that I can drink more than one of these in a row , unlike many lambics or perrys where my palate needs a break, is a testimony to it's good balance and flavor. It is a great balance of the tart with the sweet. The malt and deep flavors of the beer seem to yield to the natural, great tasting flavor of dark red cherries.","carp3tshark","Dec 03, 2014"

Extremely well-balanced with the 8% ABV thoroughly hidden.  The beer flavor is subtle but definitely present with a faint hop element in the aftertaste.

Cherry boquet off the top of this one , slightly tart but mostly black sweet ones, a bit of cranberry note, very fruity and not much else going on, though it's nice if you're a fan of cherries. Flavor is a big punch of black cherries, not much in the way of hops or malt or yeast or sourness here.  Basically black cherry juice with some carbonation.  Nevertheless, this isn't extremely overly sweet and is somewhat pleasant as a dessert beer.  Medium bodied with plus carbonation that keeps things from being super syrupy.  Overall worth having if in the mood for cherries.  The thing that sticks out to me here is that it comes with huge black cherry flavor, but without the medicinal cough syrup notes that can often be associated with that.","BMMillsy","Beers"
2.65,-30.4,,,,,,"No... not really for me. The huge raspberry flavor in the aroma and taste really come across as more ""cough syrup"" like than anything. Not very drinkable, had to sip slowly.

It has a nice nose. Some cherries, and some sweet caramel malts. Some other fruits hiding down in there. The flavor is very nice. Cherries on top. A hint of tingling on the tongue. Good malt body, with some sweetness. A touch of chocolate also. I wouldn’t sit down and drink a lot of these, but I would definitely have it again!","Boto","Nov 17, 2013"

3.82,0.3,3.75,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Overall / Drinkability: I feel that the beer is the vehicle that carries and showcases the cherries, and allows the cherry flavor to be the main highlight, but not be too much. Alcohol is very well hidden; I doubt I would ever know this was 8% ABV unless I had looked it up prior to drinking it. A very nice beer showcasing cherries. That being said, I cannot have more than one. It's good, but by the end of the glass my palate is tired and wants something else. If the Belgian ale underneath could come out more and play with the cherries, then you'd have something really amazing here. Glad I tried it, but at the price here in the US, doubt I would get it again.","damndirtyape","Sep 28, 2013"

4.41,15.7,3.5,5,4.5,4,4,"A quick story, if you find it in your hearts to give me the time to tell it. I may be a bit jaded when it comes to what I believe is a quality beer, and have succumbed to the hype of certain styles of brew over the years. I also succumbed to a 6'2"" Czech, but that is another tale. Or tail. I would never in my life take a sip of a damn fruity beer, and the thought of adding fruit was a novelty meant for punier men than me. I have been proven wrong tonight my friends. For tonight I have been exposed to the greatness that is Kasteel Rouge. A cherry bomb that destroys your mouth, but in the most respectable manner. A hidden jewel in the temple that is the Belgian beer empire. This type of beer was always something foreign to me. Like a black girl. She may have beautiful features, but you think that there must be something different going on. You are hesitant to make a move. You remember what your friend once said...""they are spicy."" You wonder what the heck this spicy taste thing is all about, and keep your distance, but also keep a fixation. One day, you invite the girl back to your house, and finally kiss her. She tastes the same as everybody else, but you only let her give you a handjob in the end. This is Kasteel Rouge. A gem in disguise but only good enough for hand pleasure. I came. Something you keep around for a quick fix, but not the true love you desire. The sweet pleasure of those lips may get you through the night tonight, but there always comes another day. Keep this beer handy for those quick fixes though my friends.","Toddzillamz","Sep 26, 2012"

But if you want to rock your girl with a deceptive alcohol content and give her a drink that she will crave, and keep asking for more, then look no further than Kasteel Rouge. How well it masks the taste of rufies I don't know yet. But there is a significant chance that with Kasteel Rouge you won't need them at all.","amendt","Sep 26, 2012"

It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The cherry coming off of this one in both the aroma and flavor were rather intense. On the aroma it seriously reminded of cherry cough syrup that I had when I was feeling bad as a child. However, this did taste MUCH better. There was a nice cream note going on to help balance out the cherry sweetness, but it was a case of too little too late.

Taste of tons of cherries, cherry juice, tartness, cherry skin, and a bit of spices as well. No bitterness noticed; but there is a ton of cherry skin, tartness, and sweet notes lingering on the finish with a bit of spices as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. This drinks very smooth for the alcohol level, but is still quite a sipper due to big flavor and sweetness.

Didn't get any medicinal/robitussin flavors at all. The flemish/sour brown ale underneath the fruit is barely detectable. A fun beer and the ladies seem to really like it as well.

3.98,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"First off, this came in one of the coolest goblets ever, with a representation of what I am assuming is the brewery molded into the long square stem. The beer itself was dark as black sweet cherries with a deep pink head that was very foamy and fizzy. The head eventually settled into a pink collar that left no lace at all. The aroma was incredibly fragrant and full of tart cherry deliciousness. I was hungry when I drank this and it actually made my mouth water. Though the smell was dominated by tart cherry, it was very sweet overall, and seemed a tad artificial, more like store bought cherry pie filling than my mom's homemade Michigan tart cherry pie. The flavor was quite well balanced with tons of sugary sweetness, but also a good amount of tartness to keep it from getting out of control. Rich tart cherry flavor ruled the day, but all that sweetness also produced juicy dark sweet cherry flavors that melded with brown sugar notes. I am starting to think this would be an amazing dessert beer. The body is medium, and it somehow manages to stay quite smooth even in the finish, with just a bit of stickiness. This was a surprise with all the sweetness it had going on. It had the perfect amount of carbonation, so perhaps that helped. Though this is a very well made beer, it is perhaps a bit sweet to be extremely drinkable, though compared to its contemporaries, it holds up pretty well in that department. I just realized this is an 8% beer, something I had no idea of when drinking it. I think I will have to raise the drinkability score. Chalk this one up as being surprisingly enjoyable.","zoso1967","Jul 16, 2010"
4.17,9.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Sweetness is balanced a bit by some tartness and maybe a touch of sour. Cherries, raspberry jam and more cherries...tastes very much like pie filling. Alcohol is detectable but does not seem as high as 8%. Carbonation is low and the body is full. It seems like a little bit of dark malt is there if you really pay attention. This is a dessert beer of the highest order. Vanilla ice cream with a square of dark chocolate? Oh yea.","twiggamortis420","Jul 10, 2010"
3.9,2.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Holy Cherries. This is a very fruity beer with strong cherry flavor, and ample cherry taste. I have had this beer both on tap and in an aged bottle and I think the beer in a bottle is better. The cherry sweetness subsides a bit over time, which marries better with the beer over time and allows for some complexity to come through without being overwhelming. It's good to have a small pour, but anything more than 8 or 10 ounces would be too much.","Soonami","May 11, 2010"
4.05,6.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinking this would be a cherry gig indeed! Ahem. Sorry. It pours a mostly clear ruby topped by over a finger of ecru foam that holds a slight pinkish tinge. The nose comprises more than a healthy contingent of cherries, chased by a slight medicinal quality. Something akin to Cherry Coke lies beneath this mass, but can't quite find the right words to express itself. The taste mirrors the smell, though the cough syrup is toned down a bit, allowing the cherries to explore a somewhat more sour path to enlightenment. Again, the Cherry Coke is there as well, possibly aged in some dry oak barrels (not enough to allow a lambic-style experience to blossom, but just enough to be vaguely recognizable). The body is a solid medium, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying finish. Overall, a solid fruity Belgian, though not necessarily one I would be able to contantly down.","TMoney2591","May 02, 2010"

Full-on cherry enveloped my taste buds and at 8.00%, provided a dangerous beer to session. If not for the sweetness, I could drink this all night.

Sour cherries fill the air with hints of malt and oak adding to the desire of the mix. With the first taste you get blasted with the sweetness of the cherries that slowly turns a sour edge. The thin crispness and high carbonation fill your mouth making a smooth feel that ends in a bitterness that is quite enjoyable.

Not as deep in cherry flavor as New Glarus' belgian red, but slightly more beer like (which I actually prefer more).

I think it would go well with a duck or a pork on the whole. Def on that needs paired though and would not really want to drink one alone again.","jeonseh","Jan 20, 2008"
2.98,-21.8,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a dark red cough syrup/beet juice color with a light gray-pink head. The aroma is clean, sugary cherry juice. There's a hint of vanilla-spicy stuff in the background, but it's a reach; this is a very simple, straightforward aroma. On the palate, initially a touch bitter with a cherry underpinning that's only slightly tart. Cherry sweetness comes on around the mid-palate, then dries out a touch, leaving some unpleasant bitter, woody tastes behind at the finish. There's an underlying sweetness and juicyness that is in-line with the note on the bottle saying that plain cherry juice is added to this beer. Mouthfeel is an odd blend of beer-smooth and juice-smooth, with only a slight bit of carbonation. Overall, there's not much to recommend this. It's fruitiness lacks complexity, and perhaps due to the fruit juice addition, there's little beer character that actually shows through.","geexploitation","Jan 04, 2008"
2.81,-26.2,4,3,3,2.5,2,"Pours burgundy with a purple tinged head that has some decent inital head but that fades pretty quickly to settle to a ring. Deep, deep aromas of cherry and Cherry Heering with a background smell of cough syrup. Some slightly sour winey smells on the very tail end. Tastes somewhat like cherrry cough syrup as well, but with a pleasant bitterness that runs through it and saves the day somewhat. A touch of fresh cherry flavor floats above the more medicinal taste. Mouthfeel is super sweet, and that combined with the low carbonation level makes this a bit of a chore to drink. Not balanced or subtle at all, and extreme in all the wrong directions.","Georgiabeer","Dec 31, 2007"

Nose is steeped in sweet ripe cherries, with a nut-like undertone, tart and crisp, a real delight for the ocular and olfactory senses. Start is ripe sweet fruit at the front; tart at the back, hint bitterness also present, top is moderate in feel.

4.03,5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I'm convinced that this brewery could pee in a bottle, cap it, and it would turn out great. They simply can do no wrong. This beer proves it. A burst of tart cherry aromas fill the nose, followed up by a vineous, woodiness, and sharp berry character. The beer looks darker than most fruit lambics, but still take on a red hue, laced well, and held a firm foamstand throughout. Flavors of tart (nearly sour) cherries swirl around a solid malt base to amplify a sweet / savory / wine-like complexity. A firm hop bitterness combines with a sharp astringency to temper the intense fruitiness and sweetness. Alcholols are hardly detectable, but thin the beer for ease in drinking. Finishes with a candy-cherry flavor and a bitey-bitterness. It certainly picks up on a lot of Framboise-type character, but a bit more malty, and less intense sourness might make it prefered.","BEERchitect","Oct 28, 2007"

I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but figured it would be similar to a lambic. This was a bit of a disappointment. Fist off, it completely lacks any subletly or complexity. It smacks you with cherries throughout. It's strong and malty, which I like, but has a harsh medicinal aftertaste. To be blunt, it's like drinking carbonated cough syrup. I would pass this one by. You can do much better for the price.","Boomhower","Oct 08, 2007"

3.48,-8.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a very clear candy apple amber in color, topped with a dense, frothy two-fingered head. The color of the head is a blend of light tan and red, for what I might best describe as a ""dusty pink", and this aspect of the presentation is actually somewhat impressive; the head fills the glass nicely for several minutes befor fading to a ring of moderate lace around the edge. Compared to the visual aspect, the nose is less impressive, it's mostly canned sweetened cherries. Yes, the same kind you use to make cherry cobbler and/or scoop over cheesecake (complete with that thick cherry sauce!), so for the most part it's a sickly-sweet, concentrated, and not at all natural smell. I'm also getting cherry Life-Saver (TM), cherry Tootsie-Pop (TM), and even Cherry Sucrets! So far this is not really my bag, baby. Owing to the color of the head I had to check the label to make sure that there was no artificial color (or sweetener) in this one, but no, there is none - or at least none listed. And the taste? Throw the idea that this might be a fruit lambic -or even a sweetened fruit lambic- right out the window. What this is is a Belgian brown ale jumped-up with fructose-sweetened cherry juice. It's almost an 'either you'll like it or you won't' proposition. While this is medium-bodied and with a nice brisk feel on the tongue and palate, neither is it all that compelling, instead moving from a sweet cherry explosion to a lightly malty booziness and then fading away to a light citric tang and somewhat dull cherry aftertaste. The 8% ABV is welcome here, if only to break through the wall of canned cherry. Drinkability would be better if this were a bit more exciting. Malt profile is dominated by the unnaturally sweet cherry on one hand (bad) and the tart, tangy cherry quality on the other (good), so don't go looking for too much complexity, it's smothered. Apart from that, this is really not a bad beer. It might make an interesting ale to blend with a strong dark Belgian (like Kasteel's own Donker) and it might be an interesting choice for a 'training wheels' fruit beer (instead of Lindeman's, New Glarus, etc), but in the end I had expected more from the Kasteel brand.","Chaz","Beers"

It is a nice aroma, but completely lacking in complexity. The taste is of cherries, but with a funky sour milk like aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, it is very noticable that this beer is an ale trying to be a lambic, and not a real lambic. I just cannot deal with that rotten aftertaste. This is a drain pour.","KarlHungus","0"
