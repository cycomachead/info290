Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy coppery-amber (SRM = > 13, ~ 17). Nose smelled heavily of cinnamon and nutmeg and I will be honest here - I am getting really tired of smelling the whole spice rack in these beers! Balance, people! And this coming from a self-avowed hophead who likes DIPAs. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, creamier than many of its ale counterparts. The taste was really muted and frankly kind of watery. What happened to the spices from the nose? They seemed to have disappeared! Finish was rather bland and nondescript. Unless they tweak the recipe for next year, I will not be revisiting this beer after the 2013 edition.","woodychandler","Nov 20, 2013"

The beer was described, more or less, as a cross between a pumpkin beer and an Oktoberfest, both of which I enjoy. The color was a nice amber with very little head, much of what you would expect from a beer of this kind. I thought it smelled fantastic, however, the taste was where I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer. I was just expecting a bit more. The pumpkin was a bit overwhelming and, to be honest, it tasted extremely similar to Blue Moon's Harvest Pumpkin Ale, which is roughly the same price for a 6 pack. I realize this beer is not an Ale, however, to me, the taste was pretty close. Like I said, it is a good beer, just gave me nothing that made it stand out and made me want to look for it again next fall.","scanny24","Nov 18, 2013"

This Was one of the lower ranking pumpkins that felt like it had a higher ABV than most others I've had. I like my pumpkins mild and this one was hoppy like other Terrapin beers I've had. It was also spicy with a tough finish. On the darker golden side where as I prefer the lighter pumpkins. Overall finishes in the lower half of pumpkins I've had.

This Pumpkin Ale/Oktoberfest hybird poured a hazy orange color, produced a small off white head, poor retention and it left an average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh roasted pumpkin, caramel and pumpkin pie spice. Medium in body, this ale had a malted grain base, pumpkin, caramel and a nice amount of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice- in fact it borders on being over spiced. With that said it is a very worthy Pumpkin ale- Nice session beer = first example of a Oktoberfest/Pumpkin Ale I have sampled.","GossageBrewery","Jan 27, 2013"

Very clear and bright brownish amber hued liquid, becomes more zinc orange towards the outer reaches with a final shift into yellow, hardly any visible carbonation. Big clove and nutmeg in the nose, vanilla and cocoa along with, of course, pumpkin, pie crust to scone for breadiness, mild yeastiness, has a liqueur like quality even as at times there’s a short burst of grass and pepper. Medium-bodied, has a hard mouth feel, lacks graceful movement and flow. The carbonation is light, what’s there has a tight prickle. Dry on the whole, the ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon has a spicy cumin edge too. Cocoa powder more than honey, brown sugar or caramel, in keeping with dryness. Whisper of peach, apricot fruit, any sweetness more derived from that pie dough, baked goods component. Loses any hoppy bite here but does have a mineral water feel which aids a fresher finish.

However, this beer is only an average example of each style. It doesn’t have the abundance of hearty malt aromas and flavors that I’d like in an Oktoberfest and it only has a mild and subtle pumpkin pie aroma and flavor. I’ve kind of run into this a lot with Terrapin when they try to combine styles, but they definitely get bonus points for trying and for creating a beer that is both tasty and unique.","BlackBelt5112203","Sep 06, 2012"

Not sure that I am describing it well, but I definitely got a soft mouthfeel from the pumpkin but the spices were on the dry side for your typical ""pumpkin beer"". I was going to say that it almost reminded me of a lager in terms of the mouthfeel and then I read the bottle and saw that it is a hybrid of a pumpkin beer and a märzen.

The only reason i picked this up was because I've never had it before. I realize its supposed to be different from those, but let's face it...this is just another pumpkin beer. As long as the price stays, i promise I'll never buy this again. If it were to come in 6-packs for the same price, then yes, I'd definitely pick up one of those.

The malt lends a bread-like quality that makes this seem even more like pumpkin pie, in aroma and taste.

This blends nicely with the relatively mild earthy hops, a nice creaminess and just a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon. Just a touch of sweetness.

The finish was dry, which probably was the effect of the spices. The body felt medium thick, but fluffy due to the carbonation.

4.51,22.6,3,4.5,5,3.5,4.5,"Very good pumpkin beer by Terrapin. Got this one on my first trip to Charleston Beer Exchange. I saw they had it on draught and immediately got it. They nailed this one pretty good. Apperance was ok, nothing to write home about. The stuff that matters though, smell and taste, were great. Smell was just like a fresh pumpkin pie and oh so buttery. Taste was just like you'd imagine a good pumpkin pie would be. Not too much cinnamon, slight earthiness of the pumpkin, and buttery goodness. The more it warms up, the more I like it. Definitely in my top 3 favorite pumpkin beers.","JISurfer","Oct 12, 2009"

4.27,16,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Notes: I had high expectations for the marriage of two good styles and Terrapin didn't disappoint. I'm sure some will not like it because some people don't like pie tasting beer, but this is what I have been waiting for. Most pumpkin beers are too spicy and hoppy for me, but this one is just right. I literally tastes like pie in your mouth, all the way down to the crumbly crust.","dpodratsky3","Oct 09, 2009"
4.52,22.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"I wasnt expecting anything from this one. All of the other beers in this series have been average at best. Not only is this the best one in the series by far, it may be one of the best pumpkin beers I have ever had. Not overwhleming, subtle, spicy, very flavorful and very festive. A really hard style to get correct and Terrapin really nailed this one. Loved it!","SaCkErZ9","Oct 09, 2009"
4.22,14.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I enjoyed it. Pumpkinfest, for me, was a nice amalgam of a pumpkin beer and a wholesomely bready Oktoberfest. Minus a few ounces portioned out to Roommate Chuck, I had no qualms in clearing through the entire bomber.","ChainGangGuy","Oct 08, 2009"
4.2,14.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"M/D: Medium to full bodied, carbonation is slightly prickly but goes well. Good drinkability. Perhaps a bit more body than most pumpkin ales which takes a little away slightly from the session quality, but very tasty and entirely drinkable, although perhaps a bit slower.","NCSUdo","Oct 08, 2009"
4.04,9.8,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Smells of straight spice. Pumpkin spice galore, but not much else. sweet and spicy. taste is similar, needed a bit more pumpkin flavor insted of straight spice. light body with a bit of tingle. very easy to drink. great beer","Anthony1","Oct 06, 2009"
4.15,12.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"drinkability: great pumpkin beer, and maybe the best pumpkin. I have thought about someone combining these fall favorites together and Im glad Terrapin did. Nice beer","CampusCrew","Oct 05, 2009"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I was really pleased with this one. I am a big fan and to do this style right takes a bit of finesses. Quite impressed with the way they pulled this one off and I would have no issue in trying it again.","mikesgroove","Oct 05, 2009"
