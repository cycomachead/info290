"I can't even fathom the still make this beer. There have been many amazing things added to beer, blueberries, grapefruit, etc, but beets.. Beets are a punishment and create a really horrible beer. It's not secret that I am not a fan of Magic Hat but this one takes the cake, it was seriously the worst beer I have ever experienced."

"O: Not overly impressive but somewhat decent fruit beer. I would not go out of my way to drink this one again."

"I don't know what to say. My notes on this are a little rough, but I'll try to turn them down. I just thought the taste of beets was there, and it just wasn't a good thing. I looks cool as a result, but I just don't think it works, unless maybe you're Dwight Schrute. Hard to get past."

"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice head, and some really nice lacing. Nose is a wheat with a little fruit. Flavor is washed out malt, with indistinct fruit compliments. Overall, this is an okay quaff."

"This smells like a bitter root to me. The flavor profile is...well...boring. With all that crap they are using in this beer, I was expecting at least a bit more punch. Alas, there is not much to this except faint, drab hints of who-cares-what-it-is. Nice label. Boring beer."

"dont be too hard on this one, its a clever summer brew. pours a hazy pink color from beet juice added, with a short white head without much retention. smells like a wheat beer, plenty of yeasty spice going on and a very light body. flavor of the beets does not really come through, its more of a visual thing, but this is a refreshing beer with nice flavor imparted by the yeast. sort of sweet for just a second at the end, before fading out slowly with a touch of bitter hops. feel is fine, very very light. a good summer session with intense carbonation. overall i like it, not my first choice, but a very drinkable seasonal that is perhaps being treated a bit too harshly here on BA..."

"Appearance is interesting with rose/amber hue, and pink tinged foamy head. The aroma is weak vegetables and cranberries and not much else. Taste is disappointing also with soapy tones and thin malt: no hop presence evident. Mouthfeel is thin and uninteresting. Overall not something I would buy again, but I do give them credit for trying something outside the safety zone."

"o -ok, so it's past it's best by date, i didn't look until after i drank it. that being said, this is a f-ing strange beer. not awful, but feels more like a wine cooler with less sugar. not recommended."
"I wouldn't suggest this beer."
"Flavor was really not impressive. Dry, straw-like and lager-like. Slight caramel. No body and highly carbonated. Kind of like drinking dirty soda water. Very light bodied and not very good. Sweet and tastes really cheap. I would certainly avoid this again. The really high carbonation kills this one. Yuck!"
"Overall: So so. Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it."
"I don't know if this beer was just old or what, but I had been leery of Magic Hat in the past. I have not found one beer brewed there to my liking. Sorry, guys. Keep trying."
"Overall I would buy this beer again on an extremely hot summer day. It is refreshing but in an odd way."
"I allowed my love of a bargain to overtake my love of beer on this one as I picked up an assorted 12 pack of Magic Hat ""Summer Scene"". That is the reason why I am staring at what is essentially a purple colored beer. But given the fact that the beer is called Wacko, I have nobody to blame but myself. The smell is what one might encounter at an overpriced candy store in some touristy area, an artificial yet enjoyable sugary fruitiness, much like taffy. The sugary fruitiness continued into the taste, but was joined with an earthy maltiness. The mouthfeel had very much a fluffy dessert feel to it. Despite my initial hesitation, once I let go of my preconceptions/pretentions, I actually quite enjoyed this beer. There is a solid base to this beer beneath its initial appearance. I could seriously consider sessioning this sometime."
"Overall, this is decent fare, having many good flavors and characteristics, but lacks something to set it apart from the field, and begs for a shot of brown sugar and at least a light hop kick. Good beach fare, then, but not something to take to a beer tasting."
"The aroma translates almost exactly to the taste. Adjunct lager-like corn malt taste with an interesting vegetable flavor. I'm guessing beets again, but I'm not quite certain. Some hops add a touch of bitterness, but it lingers throughout the taste and finish, leading to a dry finish and aftertaste. The aftertaste is somewhat odd as well, with that vegetable taste lingering. Its refreshing for sure, but I can think of a lot of refreshing beers that I like the taste of better. Great bottle cap though of course: ""Banana costumes, by nature, are funny."" Made me chuckle."
"Reddish copper in color, the beer pours with very little head, and it produced no lacing at all. The aroma and flavor are both somewhat off-feeling, with a tart twang and that malty/adjuncty character that reminds me of cheap kegs in college. Getting past that, there is a touch of caramel. Some sweet vegetal notes come through, but really, it just doesn't work all that well. Vegetal hops are a no-no. I feel the same about beets in my beer. I'm not Dwight Schrute. Off flavors in the finish. Not diggin this, though it is much better straight from the bottle."
"Overall I don't think I would buy this beer again. It's really not terrible, just odd. Hard to pinpoint exact overall flavor impression."
"O: Well – I think the color and the label were the best things about this beer. I was not overly impressed although I do give Magic Hat credit for trying something different. But different is not always good."
"The taste is light and malty with the same annoying tang that's in the smell. No trace of hops. Bad aftertaste. Not enjoyable and hard to get down. High level of carbonation. This is a terrible beer."
" ~ I wouldn't recommend this brew to my friends. There are better summer brews available."
"Overall: Not a fan. Dont know if its a C beer but its not something I would want to try again. The color throws me off. I always appreciate the creativity and therefore I wasnt too hard on this one."
"Fact: If I were Dwight Schrute, there’s no doubt that I would love this beer. Fact: I am not Dwight Schrute. Because of this I find myself somewhat at odds with this beer. I don’t really know what to make of it. The aroma is downright disgusting. The taste is strange, with hops and malt hinting at the start but beets taking over. The lack of carbonation hurts what would otherwise be an interesting, albeit Wacko, diversion."
"Okay, so this thing is about as strange as they come, but I admittedly don't have much experience with fruit or vegetable brews. Maybe that's why I like this thing. They should have called it, ""That Hooky Thing"" because it's like that pop song you won't admit is a guilty pleasure of yours."
"Pours a deep ruby red with a thin lacing of head that disappears quickly. Smell is sweet and yeasty. Taste is an odd blend of malt and beets with a mild bitterness at the very end. The beets hang on in the aftertaste. The beet flavor actually is as well blended into this beer as beets could possibly be. Light to medium bodied and nicely carbonated."
"The BEETS! Kudos to Magic Hat for trying something unique. But the risk you run is that oftentimes it flops. This was one of those."
"As a summer beer, it’s suitably refreshing, but it could be more flavorful. For this summer, it would be great if it came with a frozen glass, or person with a giant fan-shaped leaf, or winter."
"A peculiar rosy amber color, with a weak, slightly pink scattered head that spreads to the edges after a few minutes, and little or no traces of laces. The aroma is a peculiar mineral/minty-evergreen and bubblegum. Just hard to describe. Not immediately alluring but okay. The flavor follows suit but brings in more evidence of malt and maybe even what I might call a hint of clove and sweet grass hop. There’s a dry bite to it at the front. It has quite a bit going on but at the end of the day it’s an odd sort of lager that’s a little too bubblegum sweet for my tastes in this sort of style. It’s medium-light bodied with a tiny bubbled, fizziness in feel. Refreshing, an alright summer beer, drinkable enough but not something I will rush back for."
"Overall: Wacko has a really good taste to it, very refreshing on a summer afternoon. I wouldn't drink this regularly all year long, but I can see myself getting more of this next summer."
"Drank straight from the bottle, definate smell carmel maybe a hint of chocolate and beets. Taste pretty much the same, alot of Caramel and chocolate to my palate but thats alright,a hint of beets that ins't my favorite ( i think they taste like dirt) pretty thick (for a summer for me), not really what I'm interested in when I think of a summer seasonal, I would enjoy this much more in the winter of late fall, all in all pretty solid, just not for the summer."
"This beer is bright red in color, which is concerning off the bat. It is colored with beets and you can certainly taste the sugar right off the bat and it follows through the whole beer experience, which is a bit much even for someone who likes a sweeter beer. First taste impression is sweet, followed a feel of having a sugary drink in your mouth and then leaves you with an aftertaste of sugar. Had it both in bottles and on tap. On tap was at least a bit better as it seemed to balance the sweetness a little more throughout but still was a bit much. Would be good to those who like a super sweet summer beer."
"O: I am never, EVER pouring one of these out of the bottle ever again. How does a beer that looks like meat juice and smells like raw vegetables taste this good? A beer with a wonderful personality, but it looks like Steve Buscemi."
"overall, well, i covered that in ""flavor""... not one i'll be looking for again."
"Not my favorite but at least is a different summer brew."
"Overall this is a decent summer beer. I like that it is something different."
"O: I'd say that it's an average fruit beer that NEEDS to be drank cold, almost like almost all AAL's if you want any decency out of them. If it's not cold, this becomes a nasty drink that can be hard to down. As long as it's in a cooler, this is an easy-drinking summer beer"
"I should note that this beer is not currently on the top 50 Fruit / Vegetable Beer list on beeradvocate. And for good reason. This beer taste like shit. It is a drain pour for sure. Harsh and bitter, sweet and a horrible lingering grainy aftertaste. This beer kick me in the nuts, beat up my wife, aborted my child and asked me ""Is this your dog?"" before kicking her and leaving the front door open upon its exit (to waste the air conditioning). This is a disaster of a beer. BEWARE AVOID AVOID AVOID."
"Overall, I tried it once and that is enough."
"Overall: Unique flavor and aroma though this beer itself feels like 'carbonated water with flavoring'. Not terrible, in fact unique in itself- but it just doesn't work for me."
"The color is beautiful, but the gimmick of beet juice is its hook and there isn't anything to keep me there. This tasting resulted in a drain pour of about the last 3 inches of the pint. Sad, I know, but life is short."
"The taste of this beer is just as the name suggests- Wacky. I assume that the color of the beer and to a degree some of the taste has to be attributed to beats or beat sugar. Whatever this flavor is, ill call it beats and some sort of funky yeast taste comes through. Overall- I don't like this beer- It s to Wacko for me- I guess someone likes it."
"This beer poured a light rose color, clear, offered little head. Scent was undetectable. Taste was minimum. I'm not sure what Magic Hat was going for here. It does not have an off-putting taste, just not one that is well, tasty. Mouthfeel was eh. Overall, not my choice."
"I got a growler of this at Whole Foods, where it was listed as an amber ale, certainly not a great characterization. Again, an average beer. Magic Hat house flavor but not great."
"O: swing and a miss, not worth the money or the time."
"Strange bright red color. Some head with poor retention. Minimal lacing. After ten minutes, this stuff looks like cherry Koolaid. Wheat and fruit juice aroma, odd. Flavor has a weird sweetness from the beet sugar. I don't know why they would add that to a beer. Medium-bodied with adequate carbonation. This stuff is definitely innovative, however, in this case I'm not so sure it's a good thing."
"O: Not really impressive at all. Below average, cheap feeling beer with no lasting impression on scent, taste or mouthfeel. Color is cool (beet juice added), but is more of a gimick. I like #9 by Magic Hat, but they missed on this one."
"O: I was expecting something interesting if a guy who brews beer for a living is drinking this, but no. Really the most bland beer I've ever had. Just pink fizzy water with a little sugar. Oh wait, that's diet soda??? This is my 2nd magic hat beer and so far they are 0 for 2!"
"This beer is a subtle beer and I could tell they didn't want to go overboard on the beet taste so that it wouldn't maybe turn people off when they tasted it. Yeah its a safe beer for such an outlandish one and I think this is what peoples main problem with it is. They are expecting this unique knock your socks off dare I say off centered ale but instead get a very subtle flavoring profile which I think when recognized is pretty damn good. This is a really good sessionable beer as well as its light in the mouth and alcohol. Is it the best summer beer? no but is it worth getting a six pack of this summer? I'd say so."
"Overall Impression- Besides the awesome artwork on the front, this beer is only appealing by the label and name... Not even a beer in my book, more like a malt beverage with a pink colored body. I was hoping to have a great beer from Magic Hat with the cool body, but seems its just for show..."
"pretty tasteless, and the pink color seems like a gimmick."
"Overall, I am not impressed. I will not buy this beer again."
"Poured with almost no head. A blood orange, slightly pink color. Very interesting. Smells of wheat and a sweet tartness. The taste is has a tangy bite upfront followed by a light wheat body. A crisp finish that retains that tangy slightly sour flavor. A little too sweet."
"This same sweet yeast or whatever it is, many of these beers taste sorta like Glade."
"Overall - I like this beer because I don't care for hoppy aftertaste. Never had a beer with a beet undertone so I proceeded with caution. Will buy again, if simply because I like it plus it's a conversation starter."
"D- Not overtly bad, sweet and sugary beets is the main flavor with some light beer flavor in the background. It does what it sets out to do but not something I would probably look out to buy."
"o: glad I put these all out at my memorial day BBQ...so I didn't have to drink too many of them!"
"As far as summer seasonal goes, it is light and crisp, but it’s weird. I finished it, trying to figure it out the whole time. I wouldn’t do this again. Sorry, Magic Hat."
"Well this was interesting...I was quite startled when I started pouring the beer and noticed a pinkish/redish hue. As with all magic Hat beers....there is something familiar that each one contains. This beer is no different. As mentioned above, it pour a redish color, there isnt much smell (allergies could be causing an issue). The taste is decent. There is some subtle citrus there, but seemingly a solid amber. The lighted abv and somewhat fruity taste make this a good summer beer."
"O: Probably.. no.. definitely the worst beer I've had from Magic Hat. Save your $$ and enjoy some of the other brews by MH. Cheers!!"
"Overall: Nice to serve the non-beer drinkers on a hot summer day; I guess this would be an alternative to a wine cooler for that crowd"
"Try it at your own risk."
"All in all, not my favorite fruit beer, but definitely drinkable. A good session beer on a hot day like this."
"Pours a pretty, electric-orange. I guess the beet juice is doing its job. Smell is a vague lot of fruit and grass. Taste has a sweet base, on which there is a pleasant freshness, and persimmon-like flavor. Finish is almost non-existent. A ""crisp"" beer for sure, but I don't see the point in a beer which is very comparable, but less tasty imo, to their #9. I'd rather just go with one of those."
"ehh... wasn't horrible but wouldn't try it again"
"When I initially poured this into my pint glass, I thought ""What the...seriously...is it Izze?"" I expected a cloyingly sweet maltyness w/ the extravagant bubbles and effervescent head, ala carbonated raspberry lemonade. It wasn't. It was a very dry, slightly bitter beer with a clean aftertaste. I won't put this at the top of my list of fine beers, but I like the look and the beer is very drinkable and was good for a nice, warm NC afternoon. Try it if you want something different."
"Overall – Not really my sort of thing I guess.. but I figured I'd give it a try nonetheless. If you're in the market to try something different give this one a shot. It did seem to get better as I made my way through the glass.. but I wouldn't buy it again."
"D - Fairly drinkable. The beet flavor is an interesting addition to beer, but the beer itself is empty and not very interesting. Feels very off balanced and empty as a whole."
"OK, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink but it isn’t anything that I will be seeking out to try again."
"I'd buy this for hot summer days"
"I would drink this beer again. I had a six pack while grilling out and then moved to another brew. So maybe a good simple starter is a better way to put it."
"Overall, this beer just didn't do anything for me. Even for the style, it wasn't, well...beer-y enough. I felt like I was drinking a cross between a pink sparkling wine and a Zima. I definitely would not try it again."
"O- Good for the evening on the beach. Liked it last year and this year."
"I am a fan of what Magic Hat has does. I like their sense of style and their advertising is usually very hip and fun to look at. I had very high expectations for Wacko went it came out and knew that I wanted to give it a try. A local place had it on tap and I ordered one up without any hesitation. The beer came to me as a clear pinkish hue of a beer. Interesting, kind of girlie looking but I'll give it a go. The smell was on the weak side wasn't really able to pick much up other than generic beer aromas like some malts and grains. The taste was very light as well, kind of bumming me out. The beer itself is drinkable, I expected a little bit more of a flavor or something. Just fell short on me I guess. I still enjoy other Magic Hat brews though, I'll just skip this one unless it free."
"O- i guess i just didnt get this beer. definitely wont be having it again or see what the appeal is. i also dont see why its back for its second summer."
"overall i guess im just not impressed, and i was so excited by the thought of making beer with beet juice. ""Yes! these people are thinking like homebrewers!"" i was thinking. but this is a beer not worth spending money on."
"drinkability: very drinkable for the summer season, unique with its color, fresh tasting and malts have character, nothing spectacular, but nothing to knock either."
"I'm 4 beers in to a session and I decided to give this a try. My first and only question is ""why?"" Looks like childrens cough syrup; not a bad thing if it brought something else to the party. No distinct smell except sweet. Maybe a little cherry.Taste is better than the nose but I'm only picking up a bit of a hoppy bite.Bottom line, I'm not sure the beet brings anything to the beer except for the fact that MH stakes a claim on doing it first...big whoop."
"D: it's light and 'refreshing' but not the best fruit beer i've had by any means. maybe if it's really really really hot outside."
"Overall - A waste of drink. Too mild, nothing worth the time to drink and certianly nothing much to enjoy. Very easy to drink and low alcohol, but other then that, needs work."
"Oh, my. Where to start? The worst part of MH Wacko is the nose. Imagine a nice fresh bowl of hot vomit. Or the bottom of a dirty shoe. Somewhere in between, perhaps. And who in their right mind decided on a ""beer with beet juice color""? Didn't we all decide at age 5 that beets tasted like dirt? This beer is just not right from the get go. I used to live in a town that used beet juice to coat the roads because it has a property that melts ice. Perhaps we should just pour this stuff in the road and put it to good use there. I love beer, all beer, but not this beer. On second thought, it's not beer. I think we should rename it ""Hot Barf on a Wednesday night""."
"While I am a Magic Hat fan, this just fell flat as far as taste. If I was blindfolded, this is as close to an American lager macrobrew that I've seen them come. A bit strongly carbonated, with a hint of vegetable from the beets, and some sweetness on the backside. But other than that, it's quite plain. Usable as an attention-getting session beer, but not much more than that."
"This beer pours a cloudy reddish-pink color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of berries with a hint of tangy wheat. It is rather mild though. The taste is very neutral. There isn't much going on at all. There is some fruit, but it is hard to detect. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with annoyingly high carbonation, and a watery texture. Overall, this is a bad beer. I will not be drinking this again."
"This is a pretty good beer."
"I was kinda shocked when I poured a glass of this wacko summer seasonal from magic hat. The color is surprisingly red. The smell is mild and fruity. The taste is fruity as well- it's not as fruity as a lambic- this is deffinantly a beer. There is just some slight fruitiness in the background. Thiis isn't a great rich powerful beer, but I do think it does what it sets out to do- be a refreshing summer beer that you can't drink on a hot day."
"I won't be seeking this again. I hope this is their first and last attempt with this one. Boring, it has a little more taste than a Coors Light, that obviously ain't sayin' much."
"Overall this be is very average and I probably wouldn't not have bought this beer had not come in a sample pack, I would probably not buy this beer again"
"I'm not sure why they would do this to their company. I know they like throwing different things into their beers. But, this one is a bit wacko."
"Overall a brew with an interesting taste and a decent drinkability, although the fizzy carbonation may have been just a tad too much."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a slightly hazy yellow-orange (beet juice colored, I mean it is on the bottle afterall) with a two finger pure white head with a slight pink hue going on to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, big sweet fruit, grape juice, and beets (juice maybe?). The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, nutmeg, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall if I'm honest, it was a Hell of a lot better than it smelled. Granted that really isn't saying much. Just way to bland in the flavor to be good. I have never had beet juice before, but if this is what it tastes like, COUNT ME OUT! I would personally only suggest this to someone to get a reaction from when they smell it... Just not very good at all."
"drinkability: I's pass on this one. Magic Hat has better beers than this"
"D - This one didn't grab me so I didn't seek another."
"decent pour with a very reddish color, presumably from the beets. for a fruit beer I am rather impressed as I'm not typically into that. It has a very sweet flavor that works fairly well. It may not be the best brew i have gotten from magic hat, but was at least a nice brew to try."
"It had a bitter aftertaste and I did not want to drink more than the couple of sips that I had. Even if you are fan of fruit beers, there seems to be nothing special about this one."
"D- Easy to drink, but nothing impressive. Kinda dry."
"D - Low alcohol makes the drinking easy although from a taste standpoint, not sure if I want another. Not bad, just more run of the mill."
"The appearance of the beer is an oragish haze colored beer. With a slightly off colored head. I could have sworn the head was kinda pink, maybe it was the lighting. The taste is of malt and some yeast character. Their site says they only use pale ale malt, which im wondering is true. It reminds me of a more mellowed out Sam Adams Summer Ale. It is a drinkable beer, with the mouthfeel heavier than a lager, but lighter than a brown ale. Low medium mouthfeel I guess you could say."
"D - I just can't really get into this beer it just falls short on too many levels needless to this isn't one to seek out anytime soon"
"Drinkability: I don't really get this beer. Seems that they took and average macro light lager and added beet juice to make it pink. Uh, okay. Why?"
"Light bodied, no lack of carbonation. Somewhat watery. Not something I would care to drink again."
"This pours as I quote A Christmas Story it ""looks like a pink nightmare", but as a fruit beer I guess you can't knock it all the way. The smell is of burnt biscuit and beets or some other off sugar like grapefruit. The taste is a bit too strong for my liking. Everything is off. I wish that I could give notes or details, but this seems acidic and rough. It tastes pretty bad, but it's not the worst thing I've had. There is too much vegetable, but then again I think it has no reason being a type of beer. There is a sour harshness that I don't like. It's not really drinkable, but as I've said before I don't like it at all."
"This is a pretty good beer. Look past the gimmicks and you'll find an enjoyable American Red Lager."
"D - Well since it's fall you can find this on discount shelf's and other places. It may hold up with slight sediment and the flavor will probably be more bitter. Will pick up a sixer next summer."
"D- wacko is a drinkable beer for the ridiculous weather. It does not jump out that much but its not awful neither"
"Drinkability: Looks great, but I'm not a fan of the tangy smell and the taste isn't doing anything for me either."
"I bought this at a place where you can mix and match a six pack with beers from all over the world - the label sparked my interest so gave it a try - Not a great brew and doubt I will purchase again -"
"Drinkable to a point but soon became cloying."
"its not too shabby but nothing special at the same time. needs more depth. however, its drinkable but not something i would seek out."
"I poured the 12oz. bottle into a pint glass, it had a very light pink color to it with a 1/2 white head that resided quickly to a thin lace. The smell is of floral hints and sugar, The taste is very light of beet sugar, not a lot of hops. It has a nice mouth feel and goes down smooth and is very drinkable."
"While magic hat can pull off some big things, summer definetly makes them go thirst-quenchers above palate-teasers, and this beer isn't bad but i might stick to other styles for the (remainder of) summer."
"This brew is the color of cranberry ginger ale with a fizzy pink head that settles fairly quickly. The smell is semi-sweet, some fruit and floral elements, a bit of yeast and a bit of mild muddy hop. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy without much body to it at all. Taste is dryer than expected from the nose (but that could be from the rampant carbonation). It has a decent dose of musty grass hop that blends seamlessly into an earthy vegetable kind of essence. The earthy flavors, musty hop, and a little bitter lemon hop linger in the finish. This is an odd beer, a novelty at best. I'm glad to have tried it but I see no reason to have it again."
"Wacko [fruit/vegetable style] is not my type of beer. However, may appeal more to the wine cooler crowd - too ""Wacko"" for me to revisit."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours like a medium red wine with a little bit of spritzer-like head. Smells very fruity, like Hawaiian Punch if it were a 4% ABV malt liquor. Tastes like it smells, with a smooth malt and natural flavoring, and a bit of emphasis on the cherries amongst the ""red"" fruits. Quite a bit of carbonation, which brings out the malt a bit more and making it similar to a spritzer. Very drinkable, it seems like a more refined beer approach to a light, fruity malt liquor."
"Light body, a little syrupy at times. Medium carbonation. This isn't a terrible beer by any stretch, just not very impressive."
"Not a whole lot going on in this beer except for its unique color. Worth a shot if you find it in a sampler but don't pick up a 12 pack like I did."
"I'm not a Magic Hat fan really, and this beer is exactly why. It just doesn't work and ended being discarded. Sorry MH, not a fan."
"I'm scratching my head about the beets in this. I can't find that beets lend any color, aroma or flavor. A bit of sweetness I suppose but cane sugar would have done the same. This drinks pretty much like a nondescript amber ale. Ho hum."
"D-Very easy to drink and a good summer yardwork beer, very refreshing"
"man....what a waste of 9 bucks for a six pack. oh well lesson learned, if you must try buy this one on sale."
"Drinks okay, doesn't suck as much as the average MH product, so that's about the best endorsement I can give it..."
"Cheers!"
"Given the name and the prominent noting of beet sugar in the process, I expected something off the hook. Overall, this beer was pretty average, all-around. The beet sugar was evident in a sweeter than normal flavor profile, but not so much as to throw the beer totally out of balance. The sugar seemed more cane sugar in character, but I don't know that I could really tell the difference. A bit of caramel in the malt. One was enough."
"After I drank the beer I saw that it is flavored with beet extract. I guess that explains the color and the flavor. Dwight Schrute may like the beer, I don't."
"Not a great beer. I'll give it to the guests who don't know better."
"D- Different but to strange for the average drinker or as a session. I like it but for the next time i'll try something else."
"Drinkability - A very drinkable beer. A light and crisp taste with low IBUs. You can put a few back no problem. The beer is neither off-settingly strong or weak. The beets however might scare a few people away."
"drinkability is good for what it is, an easy drinking Summer beer...but there are better ones out there. CHEERS!"
"Creative idea, but beets do not make a good ale. Drank one at that is enough."
"Very little head retention. It pours crystal clear and is very red. Even the head has pinkish red hues. It smells fruity and metallic. I'm pretty sure that is flavored with cranberries. Taste is a little fruity, and watery, no distinct hops or malt flavors. Since it is watered down, it's not overbearing, so that does help its drinkability a little bit. Overall I was very dissatisfied. This was the first Magic Hat beer I've ever had, and unless someone else is buying, will likely be my last."
"drinkability is good. balanced, light, refreshing. don't reach for this one if you want a lot of depth and complexity, but i think it does a pretty good job of what it says on the label - a crisp summer brew."
"This was poured into a regular pint and was reddish-amber in color with a head that appeared as a thick white skin like that of a pudding. It smelt very faintly of grains and malts and barely tasted of either. The beer seemed flat and was a difficult one to drink because of the bland almost complete lack of flavor. The tap handle was nice, though."
"Pours a slightly hazy, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, slight citrus (grape?), and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Fruit/Vegetable beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, citrus, grain, and hint of hop. Overall, below average in appearance, aroma, and body."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, a touch tart. Not bad and a nice refreshing summer beer, but not a whole ton of character."
"Hazy copper body. Thin off white head. Not a lot of lace. Sweet, fruity aroma. A little vegetal as well. Flavor is lacking. Quite thin. I guess I taste the beets a little. Not a lot else. Ghostly rhubarb. Body is medium-low with spritzy carbonation. Not one of my favorites."
"Nothing terribly wacky about this beer. Pretty plain, inoffensive and ordinary. The beet juice color that this boasts makes it quite pretty for something so common tasting. Maybe a hint of extra sweetness and bit of bitterness? Probably the kind of thing that would be welcome when very very cold. Otherwise, this still drinks like a fizzy yellow lager but a prettier color."
"Eh, it's easy to drink, although I would prefer a crisper finish and less sweet. It kinda reminds me of a flavorful Miller. The finish leaves an unpleasant flavor on the palate and I really don't detect much in the way of hops anywhere. Not a beer I would pursue again."
"Wacko poured an almost orange color, with a very small head that went away quickly. It had an earthy smell to it, that was slitghtly unpleasent. The taste was a bit sweet, light, earthy but full. It didnt have the strongest flavor and very easy to drink. Overall a unquie beer, and I felt it was a good summer time beer. I would buy this one again."
"Wacko pours a pinkish red color with a pink head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit fruity, but not particularly beet like. The flavor is also a bit fruity, but otherwise it seems to me to taste like a cheap adjunct lager. I did not care for this, your mileage may vary."
"Drinkability: Not the best or certainly most flavorful beer out there. A good summer refresher indeed, but there are still other beers I would rather pick over this one for that same purpose. Unremarkable and not necessarily worth it, though it may be good for those looking to expand undeveloped palates."
"D - Refreshing and I would go for another."
"Overall, a C+/B-."
"Actually, pretty drinkable. The crisp mouthfeel balances well with the beet/malt sweetness. I'd like to try this one on tap to see how it can vary."
"d - I thought this was an awful beer. Not much to the smell but some weird vegetable/earthy tones, and the taste was worse, being the same plus being metalic. Would not have again."
"Yet another disappointing beer from Magic Hat."
"D: Thankfully i only bought a single. wouldnt try it again, but not a fan of lighter summer beers"
"Overall, I was fooled once again into thinking that magic hat made a decent beer because they have trick labels and cool, bohemian label art. Mistake. This is dreadful and would rather have a BMC light. Avoid."
"How this is 'summer' beer I don't know. I found it neither refreshing nor enjoyable."
"drinkability - very drinkable. went down smoothly and was pretty refreshing on a hot mid afternoon. wasnt quite what i hoped for and would choose many others before this one again. on the plus side, it has a pretty cool label."
"Nothing outstanding about this beer. Pretty much average across the board. The beets were present in the color and I believe the taste also as there was some fruit/veggie that I couldn't quite place (not up on my beet flavor knowledge). It did finish crisp and clean and would be good on a hot summer day, but definitely would not be my go to. Glad I tried, but most likely will not purchase again."
"Crisp and clean."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a pink tinged gold with a thin white head. Not much going on in the aroma department, just a light malt sweetness. Light bodied with a bit of bready malt and some malt sweetness in the finish. Pretty easy drinking summer beer, but nothing to get excited about."
"It started out with a cool label stating that contains some beets, that should have been a sign right there that something wasn't right with this beer. There really wasn't much of a smell to the beer at all but it some how reminded me of a light soap smell, clean with a hint of floral but not much on the nose at all The taste was a very light sweet malty taste. I can see were some may find this as a nice summer beer but it was not for me. I would prefer something with a bit more flavor."
"Conclusion: Gets a bit more unsorted as this warms up a bit...I'm not enamored with it by any means; it's not bad, strictly speaking, but it's not that good either."
"Drinkability is a little below average. I drank one during dinner and didn't want another after that. Nothing terrible and after three beers it tastes like a regular lager. Told the bartender to get some paulaner or weihenstephaner."
"Aroma is husky and tannic. First sip confirms this. Bland, grainy, dry. No hops to speak of. Overall this is a uninspired gimmick of a beer. Quite a dissapointment."
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combination makes this beer a nice, drinkable beer overall."
"Magic Hat?!? Seriously? This is one of the worst beers (if you can call it that) I've ever sampled. Thin, over carbonated, flavorless---like flavored seltzer. Plus, think about holding a pink colored beer in a pint glass. Really, avoid at all costs."
"Drinkability- I could see myself pounding these on a hot summer night, but i'd get no enjoyment out of it."
"D-This is not bad beer. I would drink it over a lot of other BMC things out there but thats about it. I wont ever purchase a six-pack of this. I'll give the rest of these to my girlfriend she likes the number 9 maybe she will like this too."
"Drinkability - a tasty summer brew, I refer it on tap. Some nice flavors that make for a tasty warm weather session."
"d - not an impressive beer to me."
"Overall this is a fine beer. I can see why Magic Hat makes it for summer: It's very easy to drink and light enough to have several without getting drunk."
"Drinkability: Not really impressed with this one. I'm afraid that the beets might not really be working here. I'm usually pretty impressed with Magic Hat's seasonals but this one is pretty disappointing."
"D - Good for change of pace, but I'd only have one."
"DB- Great price as usual from Magic Hat. The fruit flavors and malt ones are nice here. Gotta keep trying the Magic Hat mixed 12 packs, a great deal with beers that are usually worth trying."
"So, yeah, I'm sure the score is a major tip-off that I did not enjoy this beer. Worse, it all started out so well. I saw it on the shelf at one of my local haunts and thought, ""Hm, that sounds interesting. Let's give it a go."" After chilling it for a few days (there's a lot of beer in that fridge, OK?), I finally got around to pouring the damn thing. It was clear, the color of a nice blood orange, and had a head made of about a finger of quick-dying white micro-foam. It seemed as though the beets were doing their job well, making a festive, interesting appearance. Things began to go sideways when my 'strils got involved. The bit of citrus hops was the only saving grace here. Unfortunately, from behind them rose some funky wheat, bad puffed rice (I didn't know that could go bad...), and a scent warning me of an impending vegetable zombie attack. I knew that damn disposal didn't work well enough. Still believing myself the Shackleford of beer, I pressed on into the foreboding taste. Big mistake. The vegetable zombies struck, a V-8 executive's acid-induced coma nightmare. He knew the vengeance was pending, but just kept convincing himself it was an impossibility. Foolish man. My taste buds were pelted with orange peels that had been urinated on by a demon; grass left over from a hippie's orgy-tastic sex tape filming; hard water; and the very salad Ngo Dinh Diem was scarfin' on when he was assassinated. I'd love to know how much they paid for that last one on E-Bay. The body was a mercifully light medium (any thicker and I may not have been able to survive), with a seemingly oppressive carbonation and a dry finish. I applaud the creativity and find the use of new and different ingredients to be a noble (is that the word?) endeavor, but this experiment has gone terribly awry. [rec] awry. I've had worse, but not many. I will say, though, it's worth a try, even if it will most likely end up down the drain loike mine. Every beer is worth a shot. They're just not all worth more than one."
"D: pretty easy to drink, which was likely a priority for the brewmasters. Give this brew some flavor and I'd gladly have another. Glad I didn't buy this 6-pk!"
"D: Too light and not enough taste to seek out again. Easy drinking beer, but flavor would get old after a while."
"Drinkability - This beer suprised me. I really enjoyed it. Not my favorite style, but it is definitely a good refreshing, summer beer."
"My pops likes magic hat so he got this and I'm gonna recommend he never get it again. Definitely disappointed with this beer."
"I think I can finish this one, but I'll pass on another."
" I do think this beer would make a great hangover cure though"
"DM: Nice carbonation and surprisingly refreshing on a hot day."
"D: More like soda than beer. I wish the flavors were not so subdued. Too fizzy with an undeveloped flavor. There are other fruit beers that I would easily recommend over this one."
"I wouldn't seek this out again, but I wouldn't loathe the thought of drinking it. I would certainly attempt to find a good gueze or lambic first, though."
"D - A pretty standard, but drinkable brew. There isn't much going on in the aroma, but light yeast character and pleasingly musty Brit hops put some life into the flavor. The slightly reddish tinge from the beets is a little strange and it's my only complaint on an otherwise decent summer brew."
"Oh! I get it! The beer is pink! That IS wacko! It looks like kool-aid, which I haven't had the desire to drink since I was about ten. This is a gimmick beer in the truest sense of the word. Flashy packaging and claims of how they make ""the best beer on the planet"" will easily attract the label-shopper. Unfortunately, the beer can't back up any of that. Faint, slightly sweet cherry medicine and biscuit malts in the aroma. The taste is similar to caramel and cake icing, but not as flavorful as either one of those things. Spend less time on coloring the beer and gimmicky packaging and just brew something good already."
"I could session this, but i would finish with some higher ABV beers at the end of the night. Great for starting the day off earlier."
"D= I've tried, believe me-- several bottles and just never could tolerate the entire bottle."
"D - Meh, I wouldn't refuse it if someone offered me one. But once again I was let down by a Magic Hat sampler."
"d-I found the beer to be less palatable the warmer it got. I found the flavour kinda odd as it warmed up. It was fine at a chilled temp though."
"Overall this is a pretty refreshing beer despite it's darker color. Semi-sweet finish and clean hop flavor make it easy to drink but it just doesn't taste all that interesting."
"Taste is floral with a touch of light fruit, what I would imagine chewing on rose petals to taste like. Light lager sulfur with more than just a bit of hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is fine for a 4.5% lager and the carbonation is nicely done. I dont know if I will go out and buy another sixer of it this year, but I had no trouble finishing the one I bought."
"This is nothing special. Overall, seems very familiar to other beers from the same source. The beet quality blended just fine - I kinda' liked it. Also appreciate the mild alcohol quality."
"This is a pretty bland and flavorless beer overall, but easy to drink and forget."
"An interesting beer."
"Overall, not bad, just not good. Meh..."
"Pours and awkward pinkish red with a little bit of fizz that I cant even call a head. No lacing. The smell is fruits. a lot of fruits. Berries and more sweet fruits. The taste is the same. Fruity, fruity, fruity. Also very grainy with malt and a slight hop bitterness. Average mouthfeel. Way way way too sweet to be very drinkable."
"D: I don't think I could drink an entire bottle of these at a sitting, even though I would try it again."
"D: Decent brew, nothing unusual really except for color. This is a good summer beer as long as you don't mind your buddies seeing you drink a pink beer."
"D- Decent but nothing to write home about... but I guess enough to write on the intertubes about"
"D: Goes down easy; great for summer (obviously)."
"D- Overall, Wacko is a pretty average beer at best. I don't think I would purchase again."
"quite recommended."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pinkish color with a small head. Smell is of grains, some beets. Taste is mild, slightly bitter, not much in the way of flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent but unspectacular brew."
"Mouthfeel is pretty dry and the blandness of this keeps it relatively drinkable."
"overall... the color is crazy, the taste is interesting, but seems like magic hat wasnt quite finished when they were making this... seems like its missing some flavor and body... not sure if i will buy this again yet, ill finish the 6 pack and see if it grows on me"
"i cant get over the color"
"""the song of summer", that it may be, but it will not be the beer of summer."
"Ok, I appreciate the experimentation. I really do. Though, I'm not a huge fan of beets. I won't say the experiment failed, but it's just not for me. Good shot."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink on a hot summer day. Tastes great cold."
"Drinkability: easy to drink alot of on a hot day. refreshing!"
"Overall, I doubt I could do too many more of these, but it's an interesting experimental brew, and I think it might actually pair well with a salad."
"I can't really say I enjoyed this beer, though it was interesting. I wouldn't be interested in having another one."
"Fairly meh... would not get this again."
"D: Not bad at all. It goes down easy enough and is well balanced if a bit vague. It is something different and fun to take to a BBQ. But I was expecting something more interesting, something a bit, well, wackier."
"Overall I really can't think of a good reason to buy this beer - I'm sure some new craft beer initiates will find it palatable however I'd wager that it'll do more harm than good as far as turning people onto craft beer."
"Pours a clear redish orange color with a finger of big bubbly white head. Minimal retension and just a bit of lacing on the glass. Nose has malt sweetness, a bit of hops and true as the bottle states, a bit of a beet/earthy note in the aroma as well. Taste has a bit of malt and low hop profile. Unfamiliar taste that is minorly earthy rounding out the finish. Medium amount of carb and feel. I dont know what to make of this beer. It was an interesting experience but one was enough."
"I actually drank it right at the brewery and it always seems to taste better there to me."
"A good, unique looking summer beer - well made and refreshing. The beets add a striking red color, but not much else. After all, beets do not have a strong flavor. There is light maltiness and very slight fruitiness. No hop presence beyond just enough bitterness that the beer is not syrupy. Should be drank cold by the gallon in August."
"Drinkability: An easy going novelty beer that turns into a summertime favorite"
"Ok beer, but wont seek it oout."
"Wow is all I can say, and not in a good way."
"Drinkability is awful. This beer is really bad. I very rarely ever not finish a beer, but this one may be unfinishable. The taste is so off and bad that I actually wonder if I got a bad bottle or something. Avoid."
"Notes: A uniqueness is the only thing going for it. Other than ""beet color", it just tastes like a sweet watery adjunct beer. Look at your friends glass and just say ""looks interesting", no need to taste."
"Drinkability: initially I thought this brew was pretty good, but my feelings on it have changed a little, its pretty weak, id say its an occasional brew, drink it cold."
"Overall: Was awesome the first time i had it and maybe its just that this beer is rounding out its life. Best by date was Sep 09 but it really didn't wow me this time."
"One thing I will say is I downed this one pretty quickly so I could 1. get a different beer and 2. stop holding a pink beer."
"This is an interesting beer, but I will not be looking for it again."
"a good summer beer it looks good in a glass ,smooth and satisfying ."
"Pours a reddish pink color, it is a weird color like a strawberry soda. The smell is of sweet malt and a hint of floral hops. The smell is faint though. The taste is of grain backbone, and a wierd bitter middle to after taste. The after taste is almost like a cigarette butt, could be the beets. The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated. Overall its isn't very drinkable, the after taste is a little much, its a different idea with the beets, but the taste is off."
"This seems like a red summer brew. Poured without a head, not even a lacing. The colour is quite pretty! Malty nose, subdued hop bite,woodsy taste, lacking in a distinct beer flavour, clean sweet finish. All those combined doesn't make a great taste, or even a good taste, the only thing going for this quaff is the colour!"
"Wait a minute... did i just buy soda? This is barely a beer at all. It pours like a soda. Very fizzy with no lingering head. Bubbles continue to rise from the bottom of the glass. Smell is very earthy. Taste is very light and sweet with a slight bitterness at the end. I could see drinking this on a hot day if it was served very cold. An interesting beer non the less. Got it from a sampler 12 pack. Don't think i would bother picking it up again."
"On tap at the new Champions Sports Bar in the Marriott Copley. Served in a standard pint glass. The first thing you notice is the neon red color of this beer. Odd. Has a bit of an earthy smell. The flavor is unique to say the least. Kinda sugary, kinda fruity, and kinda bitter all at the same time. The sugar aspect gives it some sweetness, but I think the beets counteract that with some tartness. Very dry aftertaste. I wanted to try this beer because it sounded strange, so I knew what I was getting into. An unusual experiment from Magic Hat. It was worth trying, but not a beer that I would purchase again. Could not imagine drinking more than one in a sitting."
"Drinkability : This beer is smooth enough to be drinkable, but too bitter to be refreshing. Leaves the mouth dry. Plus its just a very average brew. Serve COLD, this is the only way you'll enjoy it. Spend your money elsewhere this beers only gimmick is its coloring. Magic hats quirky bottle and packaging visuals often are much greater then the beer inside them is."
"Wacko isn't as wacky as Magic Hat would like to believe. Instead, it's yet another in a long line of misses from a brewery that has the talent to come up with pretty good beer when they want to. While I don't regret buying this single (since it satisfied my curiosity), I'll be glad to see the bottom of the glass."
"This is such a bland beer. I wonder what their thought was? Mabey this was a bad beer?"
"I wasn't a big fan of #9, and this one just reaffirms my dissatisfaction with Magic Hat. This wasn't a bad beer, but it wasn't anything special, either."
"#9 wasn't bad enough?"
"Candi sugar (beet sugar?) and toasty malt. The website says Wacko is an English ale but it's crisp and toasty and kinda reminds me of a weird marzen. Vegetalbe soaked water aftertaste. It's not terrible but it's not really good either. I'm not sure what to do with this."
"Notes: I wanted really to like this beer but overall it just didn't have much to offer, other than it had an interesting color."
"Wacko smells like a light beer with a very faint smell of produce, the variety would be difficult to pinpoint without the label letting us know that it is a beet. It tastes almost like nothing, very light, faint beet, little alcohol presence. It goes down easy, but it is just so faint. Although I do enjoy their #9 and other selections from time to time, I did not particularly enjoy this offering from Magic Hat."
"Anyway... not much to talk about with this one."
"Trying to go into this with an open mind but the initial appearance and aroma are not helping the situation. Pours a clear red/pink color with a large frothy pink white head that actually has nice retention and lacing. Aroma is very unappealing to me, very earthy and musty, beets obviously, I don't know...dirt? In general very vegetable like and grainy. Not necessarily offensive, certainly unique, just not appealing to me. Smooth medium body with fairly high carbonation, flavor follows the nose, very earthy and vegetable like. Actually taste is more appealing to me than aroma suggested and has a slight hop presence in finish. As this warms up I start to get a little more of a a sweet, mildly fruit like presence in the body before the drier, slightly unpleasant vegetable/beet finish. This is actually kind of refreshing and not as awful as expected, however for my own taste I'll be skipping this in the future."
"The mouth was crisp and bubbly with a moderate amount of carbonation. Flavor was of sweet malts, some vegetable taste, and finished slightly bitter. This was decent. Much better than I expected. I'd get it again."
"This beer is not a drain pour, but I don't intend to repeat the experience. It's pretty weird, in a bad way."
"This beer poured a clear light pinish-red color with a very thin, 1/4 inch pink head to it. Head doesn't stick around and doesn't offer much in the way of lacing. Nose is predominantly of malt and grain with a slight hidden fruityness to the nose mixed with beet. Taste is ... interesting. I expected more of a beet presence to it, what I found was the malts and grains were the dominant force in the taste, with beet flavoring giving it a kick, and a bite to the end of it. Light bodied, low to medium carbonation, goes down somewhat easily but an odd afterbite/taste to it. This was a fun beer to try, but one was enough for me."
"I like Magic Hat, fruit beers, beets, and wild experimentation, but the base beer on which this experiment was conducted is boring at best. Why not inject gimmicky beer color into a good beer?"
"Has a intresting pinkish hue to it along with good head and laceing has a slight malt smell with a sweet potato ending, good allaround taste, and mouthfeel is good smooth little light and i could drink these for hours would buy agian for sure good for a hot day."
"D: Meh... light and refreshing, but the tastes dont blend."
"T- Great malt taste. There's a nice vegatable taste to it. It says Beats on the lable and that makes sense. Very smooth."
"Not too bad of a beer. Its pretty balanced and a good drinker for a hot night."
"Non-offensive, but not something I'm compelled to necessarily go back to and visit either. With so many summer offerings, Wacko stands out more on packaging design and label art, as opposed to substance. I wish the taste was as edgy and artful."
"D: Not unpleasant, not great. It could grow on you but i don't see myself picking this up again."
"Drinkability: The foul smell ruins an otherwise exciting beer. Upsettingly, I bought a six-pack, but I doubt I could finish even this one beer."
"Cheers!"
"Magic Hat definitely gets points for originality as it does provide to be a light, semi-refreshing beer with a unique flavor. Would I run to the store and buy a six-pack of these? No thanks, three is enough."
"This wasn't a bad beer I guess, but I just can't think of anything particularly commendable about it to base a recommendation on. So I don't recommend."
"As beer enthusiasts, we often establish certain prejudices and fail to realize the intent of a brew. If every beer was a trippel, we wouldn't be having as much fun, would we? I'm not here to tell you any beer is good or bad because everyone has different tastes. Wacko is not a thick beer. It's not bitter. In fact, it's very sweet, barely hopped and not very filling. The sun shining through its red color is beautiful. I get it. Beers can be black, so why not red? I am a huge fan of much higher-quality characteristics, but to say this is a low-quality beer would undermine Magic Hat's intent. Wacko can be enjoyed as a beer of choice throughout the day with no regard to its richness. It's a simple summer seasonal, nothing more."
"I was disappointed with the blandness of this beer. Magic Hat makes brews that I quite enjoy or quite dislike. This one is just....meh."
"The beer was a wild pink color and the beer had a great big white puffy rich head. It lasted pretty well also in the heat. The lacing was great. The taste was interesting but refreshing and clean. I would not want to sit and drink 6 in a row, but it was a cool brew. I'd buy it again. I guess I must have got a fresh one after seeing everybody elses review."
"Reviewed on 07/12/2009. Bottle. Pours a frightening pink/red with a small white head. Aroma of sweet malt. Flavor is bland--sweet malt and nothing else really. Sugary, nasty mess. I was right to be afraid of this beer...Seriously, stay away from this one."
"D. A little too thin for my liking. Not alot of flavor or smell, Not my favorite from the sampler pack."
"D: Not tasty in any way, does not go down easily, not too filling, mild kick, I just did not find anything good about this beer and there's no way that I would drink it again."
"D - Drinkable after you have a few but the first sip tells you that you don't want anymore"
"d- drinks like water. very lacking in flavor/smell but not at all bad.... just boring."
"Against my better judgment I picked this beer up, I was already not a fan of MH beers, this further reinforced that opinion."
"D..Not something I want to have again. Difficult to drink when you cannot stomach the taste of the main ingredient."
"Drinkability: While this beer is not horrible, I feel there are better, more flavorful fruit beers out there. Good to try, I don't feel it's so good to keep."
"D- I always try to give magic hat offerings a fair shot and they never impress me. I would not want to drink this after a 12 hour day on a chain gang down south, although that's not allowed anyway. Again, wacko is wack and Magic Hat needs to try harder, or take this off of their seasonal releases forever. I foresee a ton of this not being consumed and sitting on the shelf for a while."
"D: It is drinkable enough. I could see this being refreshing on a warm summer day. There is just not enough there for me to really want to drink many of these."
"On a hot day, it's not unwelcome. It certainly lives up to its name. However, if you're looking for a summer beer, you're better off with just a good heffe or pils."
"Feels verrrry light, nice on a hot summer day, but not so nice with a meal for me. Could drink a ton of these on a nice day."
"Lives up to it's name, but it turns out that's not such a good thing."
"D- A decent beer that does down alright. I'm just not blown away. This is maybe a little too sweet."
"D: Not enough flavor to be that drinkable, but still easy to put down because of the light body. Overall, an interesting summer beer, but not one I'd likely seek out again."
"This beer, brewed with beet sugar, is a distinctive pinkish color with amber hues. The head is white and fairly stable...it's a good looking beer. The smell is a little fruity (strawberries and pear?), along with a mustiness. There's not a lot else in the aroma, which is not really engaging. The taste is moderately dry, but has a lot more sweetness than I expected when learning about the beet sugar. I had anticipated bone dryness, and this doesn't even approach that level. Still, it's not a sweet beer. Some malt and fruit come through in the flavor....berries again. The finish is crisp and there is a solid hop presence. Not a bad beer, but also not one that really excites me."
"Not overly impressive, but still rather refreshing. A light summery beer. The fruit taste is so minimal that it leaves me wondering - why beats, what gives? If you are looking for a fruit beer - there are better options out there. If you are looking for a summer beer, ditto. But it is worth picking up and trying it out."
"The hype for Magic Hats's Wacko was less then acceptable. I have come to learn and love Magic Hat's variety of different fruit flavors was such a let down. Other then the pink color, Wacko was nothing more then Coors Light with red food coloring. I'm so happy I bought it in a twelve variety pack because I would hate to have to force down the other tastless seven."
"Ultimately Wacko is an ok summertime refresher. Fans of Purple Haze with find comfort with this beer."
"I really expect more quality from Magic Hat"
"D - This one is worth a try, probably just once unless fruit beers are your thing."
"Sour flavor that is over the top. Surprisingly short (near non-existent) aftertaste. Quite the novelty. Thin bodied, highly carbonated. A clear miss."
"Drinks very well, but I have to think that is expected of a 4.5% of this style."
"D - If you can get beyond the lackluster taste, you could polish 2 or 3 of these without trying. Low ABV to boot. Not really much of a beer though."
"This beer was a bit off=putting at first , but I have grown to like it. It is very refreshing, easy to drink, and reminiscent of a cocktail - it has bitter and vegetal aspects as well as sweet and fizzy notes. All in all, way better than the Odd Notion also in the Summer variety pack."
"M/D - Light and crisp...about the only goodt hing going here. The taste is just not good and this is one of the very few drain pours I have ever had."
"on a hot day. The keg version is much more flavorful."
"Not my thing. A bit sweet, though not overly. Not much to it. A carbonated, sweet-ish, pinkish-red drink."
"Odd fruit beer. If you like beets you may like this brew. I tried a couple more to see if I could acquire a taste.... it didn't happen."
"Cheers."
"As I poured this beer from the bottle I noticed definite red tint to it. It looks like Cherry 7-Up. The aroma is mildly sweet with a strawberry component. The taste is very light and the mouthfeel is very thin and light. The taste is refreshing and actually isn't too watery. The beer is unremarkable, but would be OK after mowing the yard or a round of golf."
"12 ounce bottle, best by August 2009. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with about a half inch white/pink head. Head retention is low, not much lacing either. Not much to the aroma, it smells like sweet malt and grain. With that being said, it doesn't smell bad at all. However, the taste seems a bit off to me. It tastes like sweet malt, grain, and a weird unnatural sickeningly sweet flavor that I'm not sure what it is. I assume it's from the beets/beet sugar, but I don't know for sure. I just know I don't like it. There's also a weird aftertaste that isn't appealing. Mouthfeel/body is light, but it's not watery and has decent carbonation. Drinkability isn't good, but then I don't exactly like the taste of the beer either so that doesn't help. I'm lucky I just bought a single bottle of this, I couldn't imagine having to drink any more bottles of this than one. Unfortunately this is a perfect example of what I think of most (but not all) Magic Hat products. This is just another brew that is more gimmick than substance. I know Magic Hat is capable of making good beer (like Roxy Rolles and HIPA), I just wish they'd focus more on making decent beer than stuff like this."
"Overall, I think this beer is a tad underrated. This is not a great beer, but it is drinkable and is better than the run-of-the-mill macro lager. I actually like this more than some micro brewed lagers like Bells. If you are in the mood for a refreshing lager-tasting beer, this fits the bill nicely. Recommended."
"The drinkability here is off the charts, I'd say. While the beer isn't likely to please those who are looking for an ultra-complex beer, this style isn't really supposed to be that way. For a summer beer, this is definitely a top choice."
"D: OK drinkability."
"Definitely a cool beer. Just that first pour out of the bottle was startling and it's a nice take on an English beer."
"Enough said."
"D: Easily a session beer with low alcohol and ease of going down without offensive flavors. Don't be fooled by the color it is pretty good! Magic Hat is clever."
"D: Very drinkable. It definitely lives up to the summer ale intention. I'd trade up this for Bud any day. Works as a porch session beer. As a microbrew, it's a bit weak."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a pinkish-red color with a large, but quickly diminishing off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is pale malts, grainy and that's about it. Taste is sweet, grainy and kind of tastes like, but not as good as their #9. Mouthfeel is lighter and the sweetness stays on the palate for a while. I was scared of this beer because of what I had heard previously. It was not all that bad, but not great."
"Drinkability: I could throw back quite a few, but I wouldn't want to unless there were no other options."
"Pours a three finger light pink head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Clear red color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Faint hoppy nose. Flavor is almost sweet hoppy beets, unusual. Best by Aug 2009. 12oz bottle from 12-pak - any supermarket in VT and NH."
"Overall, not as bad as I expected, try it."
"I really wanted to like this one. I mean, it looked like there would be some interesting flavors popping out, what with it being pink and all. But alas, simply tasted like a force carbonated macro. Which is to say, you could throw a ton down, but would you enjoy it? As for me, not so enjoyable. Nothing wrong with it in any way, just wasn't exciting. Second beer of the night, and ended up being a near full drain poor. Simply didn't want to waste my sobriety to a boring beer. What a waste."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of August 2009. Sampled on June 12, 2009. I have never seen a beer pour the color of pink before but that is just what this one did. Pretty bizarre...or whacko, like the name implies. Must be that beet sugar. That is really the only aroma I get is a faint scent of sugars or hops. But it is nothing to write home about. The mouthfeel was rather thin and watery. The taste was also on the bland side and maybe a little tart. The only unique thing about this beer was its color."
"Yeast-English Ale, Malts-Pale, Hops-Columbus, IBUs 15, plus Beet Sugar"
"This poured a clear, strange pinkish peach color with white head. It smelled mostly of bready yeast with some apple and copper hops, and a bit of barley. Its taste was dominated by bready yeast and earthy wheat and barley, with a bit of copper and apple. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a mild metallic and wheat aftertaste. Overall this was not nearly as flavorful or unique as I hoped. The ingredients all tasted low-grade, leading to a dirty and bland flavor. This also had a weak body and low ABV, so it wasn't difficult to drink, but it's difficult to justify drinking. The only interesting aspect about this drink was the strange color, and I'm not sure that was a good thing. You can skip this beer. (Why are summer seasonals so much worse than winter?)"
"D. This brew was interesting, but the pink body is the only thing that really makes it memorable. Good if youre looking for a light version of craft beer."
"Refreshing summer brew."
"This is an odd looking beer. It poured bright pink with a little head. The smell was pretty basic American macrolager, I wasn't able to detect any beet if it was supposed to add to flavor as well as color. Taste is more of the same, some sweetness up front with no hops to balance it out. I could be drinking Budweiser with some food coloring in it. The mouthfeel is slightly watery with some crisp carbonation. This beer is as drinkable as most American Macros, so at least it has that going for it. A very underwhelming brew."
"Very disappointed with this latest Magic Hat release. Its been a while since I have had anything from their brewery but thought I would give it a try. Poured into a clear mug, the color was interesting enough - rose colored - reminded me of the cherry ginger ale that Canada Dry used to make. Anyhow, the color was interesting enough to start several conversations about different beers. The taste was another thing; i think the beets played tricks with my mind as I expected one thing a got something completely different. I can't say anything else other than I couldn't finish it and had to toss it out. Thank goodness I was at a party that I could leave the rest of the bottles behind. Boo...hiss...Magic Hat."
"This beer had quite a peculiar smell - maybe it was the beets. Very surprised by the color when pouring it into a glass. Was worried that the beer was skunked from the initial smell, but figured since this is the new seasonal that was unlikely. Nonetheless it was far from good in fact I hope to pawn off the remaining bottles on unsuspecting friends. Disappointing coming from Magic Hat who seems to be normal good beer."
"Certainly a nice break from my recent personal streak of big-ass syrupy and/or ultra-hoppy ales. But generally I'm thinking this is pretty run-of-the-mill, no-surprises stuff. Maybe the color is a bit wild, but the beet juice doesn't come through strongly enough in the flavor, and a kick in the butt like that would've helped this beer attain something more than averageness. It's okay, certainly worth trying once, but hardly ""wacko."""
"D- not an undrinkable brew, just not what i was expecting, for the half the price i could just get LaBatts or something comparable that is thirst quenching"
"The only slightly redeeming factor about this beer is the pretty shade of pinkish red that is it's hue. I am truly disappointed in Magic Hat for putting out this ""macro"" type of swill. The mouth feel is average, the aroma is less than appealing and the taste is well insipid. Perhaps a heartier does of hops could have saved this brew, but then again that would have reduced the profit margin on this one. Lesson learned, don't send the wife to the package store with less than specific instructions on which beer to purchase."
"Comes out of the tap a clear reddish amber with a thick white fine-bubbled head. Aroma is not strong but is malty with a hint of cherry. Flavor is fairly malty and has a subtle hoppy undertone, as well as a firm hint of cherry and a whisper of sweetness. Texture is lively and tingly."
"Pours a pretty pinkish amber with a nice sized and persistent head. Aroma is faint sweetness and a bit of grassy hops. Taste is slightly sweet with an interesting note that must be the beets but it comes of as kind of a weak rounded apple flavor. Mellow and balanced. Light to medium bodied and very drinkable. For the style and for a summer beer this actually pretty good and enjoyable."
"Tap handle is 100 times better than the beer. Seriously. If I didn't have to write 250 characters I wouldn't even waste my time giving it some sort of a review besides saying ""awful"" and ""who tasted this and thought it was a great idea to put into the market"". If I was magic hat this would be the last beer I'd want a new to magic hat drinker to try. A never before magic hater would probably never again. I got tricked into paying for good marketing and poor liquid by Magic Hat once again."
"Overall wow, this was really not that great of a beer, and to be honest I was unsure it really even was a beer. Not something I plan on going back to for sure."
"meh"
"D: Could take it or leave it honestly. Lacked any wow factor at any point and overall was an average drink."
"12oz bottle into a DFH snifter a crisp ungodly pinkish red with a thin eggshell head. Aroma is slight sweet fruits and sweet malts. The taste is an overly sweet abundance of malts and fruits, really nothing but a mess. The beer is light bodied with decent carbonation but the overt sweetness blows that all to shit. This is certainly one I'll never touch again with a ten foot pole, I'm very glad I just bought a single bottle."
"Overall this beer beer isn't too bad, I expected the worst after pouring."
"On-tap at Liberty St. Tavern in Allentown, PA. Appeared red with a short, off-white head. Really? This beer only gets a C? It's not that bad, just a simple summer beer with an interesting cherry and apple flavor from beets. There's also a spicy malt flavor in the background - from wheat maybe? Not that bad in my opinion. If you want to try a sweet and simple beer that's a little different, try this."
"It's drinkable on a hot day, straight from the bottle. Otherwise ..."
"It's true that I'm not a fruit beer fan but this just isn't very good."
"It pours amber/ reddish in color, has a slight head and is completely clear. Carbonation is light to moderate. There is a almost berry like aroma that smells sweet and fruity. The taste is of Malt, fruit, alcohol and almost hops. This is a different type of beer that I think lives up to it's name."
"Not nearly as wacky as the label would have you think. Overall a light and refreshing ale, and actually quite boring at that. Little more than a novelty."
"I do not see myself ever buying this beer again. no way."
"So a beer with beet color. I'm not going to lie, this looked like cherry 7up when I poured it, nice and fizzy. Scent is fairly remniscent of an amber ale/american macro. Sweet somewhat fruity smell. Dry taste with lots of carbonation. Very thin mouthfeel. An interesting beer, the taste was hard to place but pretty awful. Pretty sure I would not buy this again."
"The feel is lagery, for lack of a better word. Smooth enough but watery. This one is a real disappointment. A typical macro lager in sheep's clothing."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodies, fizzy, and sugary. An odd but interesting choice for a Summer seasonal release."
"I wish I'd read some reviews as I'd have stuck with one bottle and not six."
"Probably the first time Magic Hat has genuinely rubbed me the wrong way..."
"D - It isn't awful; it's definitely an oddball, but as cubedoggy said, I don't think it deserves such harsh criticism. It's certainly light enough to be within-context for summer - the overall flavor and mouthfeel would make it fairly easy to drink - but the extra weirdness in the flavor sort of takes away from it."
"Fail."
"Drinkability: Not recommended. I've had some great beet dishes in my time. Now, I suppose I've had one iffy beet-based beer. This is a one-off release, right? Right?"
"Poured a very red color, nice gimmick, but I know beet sugar won't do all of that; decent head but almost no lacing. Very odd and weak scent, hints of hop, malt, and veggie all competing, but none of them are strong at all. Decent taste, probably would have been a nice pale without the addition of the beet sugar which really blanded everything out. Goes down fine."
"D- I guess I was a little disappointed. Its not bad, but maybe I wanted something different. Other than the color, it taste like a lager. A decent lager. Not what I wanted in a summer beer, at least today."
"Notes: This did not work for me as I could not get past the flavor.Not the worst of summer beer just not my ideal summer seasonal."
"D: I don't know, I'm an hophead and a homebrewer, and I think this is an excellent summer brew. I'm not sure why there's such disgust and vitriol in the other reviews. I've bought it 3 times already while here on business in Boston, and my wife has some waiting for me when I get back to Maryland."
"On the upside, I took one of these beers out of the running. Consider this a bullet dodged if you haven't had it yet. Your welcome."
"Not much more I can say...I will go back to #9."
"D: Nil"
"Slick and watery mouthfeel, slight tingle in the finish. Low drinkability, I'm not enjoying this one. Seems like it's perhaps a light summer drink made to compete with malternatives."
"This is a very disappointing brew from Magic Hat - their worst brew by far. I was totally misguided on this one. Can not even recommend it for more then a few. This brew would be good for a very hot day or maybe pairing it up with a meal and you want an alternate to soda."
"Drinkability is not bad, especially as a lawnmower beer. This one is right on the edge whether it deserves a glass or just a swill out of the bottle. I bought 2 in a mixed six pack. I would not buy a six pack of this, with so many better summer beers around."
"A bit of on odd beer but not terrible. Redish pinkish color and perfectly clear. Nearly white, pinkish head that goes away modertly fast. No lacing. An odd taste. It's a mediocre taste right off the bat, and then you taste the fruity sweetness of it. Other than the fruity sweetness, apparently from beets which explains the color, there is really nothing else interesting about this beer. Not bad, but not too great."
"Recommended for a pot luck tasting and nothing more."
"Light bodied, possibly a little over-carbonated. I suppose it would be easy to put a few of these down, but it jusn't taste good enough to me to even finish the glass."
"this is a interesting addition to the magic hat faily of beers."
"D - Don't know what to say here...I guess I'm glad I tried it so I know for the next time...Magic Hat came up a little short on this one"
"Drinkability, this beer is a lost cause I hoped to never cross paths with any beer of this level of shit. It has created a new plateau of piss poor brewing efforts, why does it have to come from a likeable brewery like Magic Hat and have such a cool fuckin' label."
"A sixer on a whim (and cause it was cheap). A friend and I split them, and neither of us was particularly impressed. This one poured a strange bright maroon color with touch of quickly vanishing head. Nose wasn't terrible - sweet maltiness, some very light unidentifiable fruit. Not a lot going on there. Maybe a touch of yeast. Flavor's fairly similar. Just nothing really to hold on to (and I might not have known it was a fruit beer without seeing it's strange appearance). A hint of malt, some sweet fruitiness, and a hint of hops. Feel is fine, appropriate carbonation and a medium to slightly thin body. Overall, it's boring. Won't pick this one up again."
"I know this was just a taste, but more than enough in my opinion. Not a beer I would ever seek out again."
"This will be my shortest review. The beer is pink. It has a hint of citrus in the nose. It has no flavor. My wife described it as having less flavor that Natty Light. I have to agree with her. Sad, very sad. Why would they bottle and sell this? A sad one for Magic Hat."
"Magic Hat Wacko is a clear, sparkling, raspberry-colored beer with a small white head that leaves pretty good lacing. The color surprised me. It has a yeasty, wheaty aroma with a note of citrus peel. It is light bodied and crisp. It is lightly flavored with mostly... wheat. There is light grassy bitterness to it. This is chugging beer."
"D- An odd beer that I am happy that I have tried out. As for drinkability, I think I could only take a few at a time."
"Glad I didn't buy a full 6 pack of this thing and got it instead in the mixed 12 pack."
"Still, very mundane, I'll not be back for more."
"Magic Hat was grasping at straws again for a kitschy summer brew to saturate the market. Pre-emptive for an Odd Notion? Perhaps. Chicks and light beer drinkers might get a kick out of the sparkling wine look, but the flavor is ultimately a letdown."
"That being said, I can not and will not defend this abomination to beer. First of all, it's pink and that to me just seems like a novelty. Novelty can be fun if the product is also good. This ""beer"" tastes like beet flavored seltzer. There is no taste. It's just a really bad decision. Magic Hat however, is known for being experimental, and when you take risks you're sometimes going to not hit the mark. This is that beer."
"D: A total gimmick beer. If this was yellow, no one would pay any attention to it. I normally enjoy Magic Hat's odd styles, but this one really falls flat. It's not terrible, but thoroughly average."
"Taste is...not bad. Fruity, but not overly so. The beer strangely works for me. If you get past the color, the beer itself is refreshing a drinkable. Worked well with my pulled chicken barbecue."
"12 ounce bottles. Comes with handy freshness dating info on the rear label. Pours a radical shade of pinkish red/diluted beet. The head is similarly tinted, loose and fluffy before receding to a thicker film and leaving copious amounts of thick lace. Light and fruity on the nose. Not my favorite style, this one is the expected continuation of the light and fruity theme. Hops flex their muscles mid way through the experience. Hot weather, summer lunch, with dessert, all these occasions could work with this one"
" Sorry Haters, I dig this one...except for the silly color and gimmicky nature. a blind taste test would serve this brew well."
"Pours a clear rose color with a wispy white head that settles into a small ring. Something very unnatural about a pink beer. The aroma is of light tart fruit, perhaps apricot and some veggie. The flavor is a bit grainy, little metallic, and sugary (brown sugar) sweet but nowhere near cloying. The feel is light but not watery, fizzy, finishes neutral perhaps a touch sweet. A gimmicky brew, flavors are ok but seems to have identity issues."
"Pours a light pink color, very off putting, with a small white head. Faint pilsner-like nose, some roasted grain, a dash of bitter hops, no adjuncts. Light on the palate! Super light in fact ,dare i say watery, almost no flavor, a hint of malty sweetness, slight bitterness towards the finish. I guess it does its job well, just not my cup of tea is all. This beer (for me however) gets looped in with Freaktoberfest, i just cant take it seriously, it plays games with the left side of my brain every time i look down at the glass."
"The beer pours a reddish/pink color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a typical golden ale scent with a slight fruity/estery aroma. I guess beet juice was added, but the sugars must have all fermented out leaving behind just the color. The taste is average. It has a very thin pale malt flavor with little hop character and a dry finish. I detect some dry fruity taste, but it's low to moderate at best. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinker, but it lacks taste and real beer character."
"This beer is why you should look at reviews before purchasing. I poured from a 12 ounce glass into my SA pint glass. The beer pours like a cranberry/ 7-up mix with a thin fizzy white head. I do not want my beer to look like a ""chicks"" drink. The aroma is very faint, maybe a bit musty? The flavor is a little funky with a bitter finish. The beer is thin and highly carbonated. I guess the drinkability is OK, it is probably better at a BBQ with food to hide the beers lack of flavor. IMO the worst beer I have had from a craft brewer in a long time."
"D- This was the toughest aspect to rate. I say that the Wacko is drinkable, just not enjoyable for me."
"It pours alright, it looks fine and the head retention is decent, but the taste is quite unexpected. This is not necessarily a bad thing if you like beet sugar. Wacko is listed as a ""summer seasonal"" at the liquor store with no hint of it's base style or malt/hop varieties inside. It's astringent and I detect no sour element to the beer. No frutiness from the ale yeast and not much in the way of layers in the pallette. Magic Hat has some good beers out there on the market. Unfortunately this is not one of them. Stay clear of this beer."
"this beer pours a very pink color with a matching head that has decent retention. the aroma provides a bit of sweet malt and some off notes... i assume the beat juice. the taste is alright with a bit of a sweet and sour thing going and a dry finish. not a bad beer but not one that i'm going out of my way to find."
"Actually somewhat refreshing. I guess if you love beets this one will sit just well. Otherwise, it's a middle of the road beer that's maybe trying a little to hard to be original. I'm sure there are some fans out there."
"Bought as part of their summer mixpack."
"Unfortunately, I don't think that many will share my view as this beer will be viewed as a Procrustean bed. Traditional APA fans will spurn its general lack of hops while summer beer fans, disappointed that Magic Hat has not created another Circus Boy, will wince as they choke back a six pack. The thought of this drives me WACKO!"
"Poured a medium reddish color (cherry Kool-Aid) with a smaller sized pinkish head. One Wacko looking beer. Aromas of vegetables (is i the beets?) and some grains. Tastes of the same with some sugary sweetness. This one was definitely different."
"D) An alright brew. Not too impressed, but to each his own."
"So what do I say? Gimmicky, perhaps. I don't think that the beet is anything special, but on the other hand I don't think that marketing something like this is bad either. Whatever sells, right? And let's be honest, cards on the table, I enjoyed this and liked it a hell of a lot better than tequiza. I know chicks will dig it. And hippie guys will probably love it too. So what the hell, spread the love!"
"M/D - decent carbonation, but the flavor is just off to me. I had one and now i'm good."
"Pours Beat red/pink with not much head and no, lacing. The color is interesting but it in no way resembles a beer. The smell is very light with a small whiff of hops and candied sugar. The taste is not much more then the smell, there is nothing offensive and the flavors that i can pick up are not bad in anyway, but it has as much flavor as a bud light. I could put quite a few of these away easily enough because there is nothing wrong with it, but it dose not impress me at all. How can Magic hat replace some of its better brews with this??"
"Didn't know what to expect so when the bartender handed my ruby red/pinkish draft I thought he mixed my brew up with my wife's order (she had a Fraimboise). The head was nonexistent and it carbonated like Cherry 7Up. One whiff and I didn't pick up much except some faint hops and some minor dark fruit notes. It is a little watery and slick, with minor hop bitterness and dryness in there along with some floral hop notes. Picked up some sweet malts on the backend for a decent balancing act. I am not slamming the beer by its color and Magic Hat usually comes up with good beers, but this one is a miss."
"pink beer what next! looks good in the glass held the head well and left a nice lace on the glass. smells funky and metallic. malty dry taste, crisp carbonation and a light mouthfeel. left me with that metallic after taste that i didn't care for so its not something i would buy but its not a bad beer."
"Might drink again, but only if it was summer, my other options were worse, and maybe there was a pink themed party going on. That's what this beer was made for: a pink themed party with a bunch of your macro-drinking friends. For that it would get an A+."
"the color caught me as soon as i poured it, a pinkish reddish color that looked like a fruit beer. it had a pinkish foamy head that left in a hurry. no lacing. it smelled sweet with a little bread mixed in there. you could taste the malt, sweet, and a little bitter with a dry finish. you can not taste the color(you know what i mean). low in abv so drinkability is there. as far as summer beers go this one is ok. i liked the unusual appearance, and it made me like it more(mental thing, cause i love beets.) give it a whirl with an open mind, and compare it to other summer offerings."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours pink with a fizzy pink white head. This is one very different beer that smells quite sweet and not that much in the way of anything else except for some pale malts. The taste follows the aroma with the sweetness and pale malts. Probably my least favorite out of the Summer Mix."
"The color is a bit odd, a pale pinkish, to me it looked like diet soda. It has a pleasant sweet smell. The taste is kind of bland. Its not offensive or over powering but rather lacking any real lasting flavor. Once again, with the taste I was kind of reminded of diet soda."
"D - Meh. Tastes like another flavored wheat ale for the most part. Interesting for a few sips but nothing that stands out."
"A unique beer (they named it correctly), but nothing special here. I don't see myself revisiting this anytime soon, but glad I tried it."
"I'm sorry, I just can't get my head around a beer that is pink. This beer is a reddish-pink color with a thin pink head. The head is gone in seconds. It has a nondescript sweet malt aroma. Some improvement in the taste, with a bit more hops assertiveness. There is also a bit of bubblegum in the taste. I suppose, if you can get past the color, that this beer would be a good session beer."
"Don't judge a book by it's cover is the terminology that came to mind with this beer..i just bought to try it out..didn't know about the beet coloring until just cracking open the first one....it's looks like a raspberry lambic (which i've tried before and is awful) but it taste similar to a summer notion beer from last summer. It had a nice pinkish head that never quite settled....to me it tasted like a piney summer beer...don't let the color trick u...good session beer for the summer...it's sure is a head turner..the color that is."
"+Edit: Grammar corrections (hey, I'd had a few). And taste taken down a peg now that I've finished it off."
"This tastes like one of those mainstream beer that craft beer consumer rage against, just with a pretty color to it. Unfortunate, because the vibe and the marketing of Magic Hat and what they promote is fantastic. I feel really bad saying this, but it is about the beer. This is not a good beer as far as flavor and quality."
"D: I guess you could drink a whole 12 of these if you wanted to, but for me there's nothing to keep me wanting to drink this disappointment. Perhaps its magic hat pandering to its more hipster beer drinking crowd instead of real beer drinkers, but they've gone down a notch in my book, at least HiPA is still good."
"The mouthfeel was quite light. Is really quite refreshing and easy to drink, goes down well."
"Drinkability: Very high on a hot summer day and high enough to be reached for any other day."
"Overall- Too watery. Not enough hop presence to make this a worthwhile APA. A gimmick because of the beetjuice coloring."
"Okay, this beer is just silly. Beetjuice for color? What's the point. This came in a mixed 12 summer pack so I drank one. I wouldn't say it's a drainpour, but it doesn't really have anything to recommend it either. Pours an orange/pinkish-red with no head beyond a thin ring. Smells vaguely fruity and a tad dusty. Tastes light, fizzy, slightly fruity, dusty, and slightly bitter and metallic on the finish. Pretty blah. Carbonated and slightly bitter and artificial in the mouth. The beetjuice does nothing for this beer but add some dusky notes and an artificial color, and there isn't much else there either. I'll avoid this in the future."
"I bought a six of this even after reading the label to see it is beet red in color which makes it hard to take serious when you pour it into a glass. It didn't taste absolutely horrible and I'm sure people that don't really like the taste of strong beer will like it. People who like wine coolers and things like Bud Light would probably love this. If you prefer a good ale, porter, or stout (or fall or winter beer) then this is not for you..."
"Eventually the head turns white and the beer mellows out to just a pinkish read. Not much there aroma wise. I must also say I've never tried a beet before, so I'm not sure of its taste. But, this beer has a nice mouthfeel and is nice and smooth and easy to drink. Has a nice fruity sort of flavor to it, but not over the top at all. Sort of like #9 just with beets I suppose. To sum it up, it's an easy drinking beer that is light bodied and good. I don't know what else people are expecting from a summer beer but there it is."
"I hope to see this beer on tap this summer."
"It's a replacement for Hocus Pocus, which was a solid good brew, but was a Sam Adams Summerale clone, so I think I prefer them doing something different for the sake of variety."
"Drinkability: I don't know why all the bashing on this offering, sure it's not Magic Hat's best beer but it's a fairly decent one at that, it's easy to drink, refreshing, and features enough elements to make it easily better then alot of other fruit engulfed beers on the market today. Don't know if I'd get another 6 pack of it, but if offered, I would easily have another one."
"i think hocus pocus rocks this one into the ground, even with its limited flavor profile."
"Way too sweet for me to have more than a couple. Not very drinkable for the session beer style abv."
"The taste is quite nasty. What were they thinking. This tastes like really lousy ale with a bunch of coloring and flavorings added. The underneath is a dry and poorly crafted maltiness, and on top is just some awful fruit adjunct. The beer is part dry, part sweet, none too refreshing. The mustiness just lingers all the way through. What a disappointment. This is a drain pour for me."
"Note: this beer could work in getting more chicks to play beer pong (get the clear plastic keg cups!)."
"Avoid this trite, unrefreshing beer, to me easily the worst that Magic Hat has to offer. A poor offering that ought to be discontinued forthwith."
"This is a strange beer. It is redish pink. I thought I have seen everything until I poured this beer. The appearance is cool. The smell is like a slightly sweet beet. The taste is not bad. There is a very slight hoppiness and a sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good too. This beer is not as crisp as the packaging says but it is still not bad in the mouth. As for drinkablity...This beer is not a bad beer very cold and I could see the refreshing fator on a warm day. All around it is a odd but solid beer and I will buy again."
"This beer is weird. It pours with no head and little carbonation, but get this, the beer is pink. Nose is a little bit skunky but nothing too crazy and the taste is slightly sweet but not over the top. Overall this beer is interesting but nothing worth buying again."
"I wouldn't normally recommend this beer, but I suppose just for the experience it might be worth trying, as long as you don't have to pay for it."
"Might as well have drank a miller light and put some food coloring in it.Poured a dull pink collor with excessive carbonation. No aroma to speak of. Tatsed like you would expect a bad pilsner to taste. I would wright more but the opening statement pretty much sums it up."
"Pink colored beer with a light pink fluffy head that fades quick and leaves some splotchy lace on the glass. Smells of toasted malt and beets otherwise very clean. Tastes very light and crisp, faint caramel malt and toasted grain with a splash of beet thrown in for good measure. Light and effervescent with a dry finish. Not bad but not great either. The bottle I have says 4.5% ABV."
"As for mouthfeel and drinkability, this is like water. It's very thin, but might actually be pretty thirst quenching on a hot day. Again, this is almost like drinking water: you could down a couple of these without trouble, if you were so inclined."
"overall-- an interesting beer. definitely better than most summer ales out there. give it a whirl-- but i dont see myself buying this more than once more"
"D - Why bother, it just tastes like a light lager and looks fruity but doesn't taste like any fruit was used in it. I could say it is drinkable, but only passable really. I would prefer some taste, not just texture and a colored pale beer. Whatever was used to color must have fermented out and I would say try as a lawnmower ale if you see it cheaply priced. the fuschia color is kind of queer(wacko)"
"Notes: Not much here, really. Light and somewhat refreshing, but dry. Tastes an awful lot like Single Chair with a light suggestion of red fruit."
"Overall a refreshing ale. Didn't get much beet however."
"Not a bad beer. Would probably quench your thirst in the summertime. Not much else to write about and too similar to Kerouac, except that the carbonation level seems higher. Otherwise, worth a sample if not a full growler."
"Off the tap at the brewery this beer (a re-branded, 'slightly tweaked version' of their Kerouac, a beer made with beets!) was a wine-cooler-pink color. The one-finger, baby-pink colored head did not retain well and left weak lacing consequently. The aroma was rather faint, a blend of pale malt, floral hops and sugar-beets. The flavors started dry with pale malt and some wheat-like notes followed by a bit of sweetness from the beets and hops. The finish was semi-bitter, the beets again, with a touch of herbal hops. Generally acidic with hints of tartness, like an augmented Hefeweizen. The mouthfeel was a bit foamy but soft, the carbonation average and the body medium/light. An unusual beer to be certain, but a summery one and worth a try if nothing else for the novelty."
