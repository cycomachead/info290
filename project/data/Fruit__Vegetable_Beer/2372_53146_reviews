"O: Heavy on the cinnamon spicing and nutmeg, nice abv% of 6.1% sits well with a gentle warmth for the chilly season drinking. Sweet upfront with a dry pumpkin spice finish."
"Poured from bottle. Orange/copper in color with thin head. Lots of pumpkin pie spice in the aroma. The nutmeg and cinnamon dominate the flavors with some malty sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Another good beer from Terrapin."
"Overall:  This is a very good pumpkin ale.  I really like the little bit of tartness that this beer has.  It’s very original.  I’m definitely getting a few bottles of this next year."
""
""
""
""
"O: Oktoberfest meets pumpkins and spice. makes total sense.  I found this to be as good as most Märzen but closer to and akin to most pumpkins, perhaps just ahead of mid-pack."
""
"A lager that is heavy on the pumpkin spicing."
""
""
""
""
"As pumpkin beers go, I would not choose this one again. Nice places, but little else."
""
""
""
"O - I like this brew.  It stands out because of the lager base."
"The description reveals this is a pumpkin lager and it tastes and feels like a lager. Very thin and a tone of wateriness, this is not one of Terrapin's best offerings. There is a spicy thread of clove, nutmeg, ginger and anise but I don't get much of the pumpkin gourd or pumpkin pie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an interesting and different seasonal beer by Terrapin. A little thinner and sweeter than other pumpkin beers."

"Amber in color with good clarity.  A fingernail of off white head covers half of the top of the brew.  Aroma of cinnamon,nutmeg,and pumpkin pie spice greets my nose.  The taste is a blend of spices.  Cinnamon and nutmeg lead the way with pumpkin pie spice in the mix.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and somewhat rich."

"Overall: Pretty good pumpkin ale. The pumpkin flavor is very up front but it's not over bearing. It's not overly sweet, but it has the right hint of sweetness. I'd certainly consider it a go-to pumpkin ale for this time of year."

"Had at Jessie's on Fire in Auburndale..."
""
""
""
""
""
"It did keep a pretty decent amount of carbonation but it did taste a bit moldy. I am going back and try this one again and make sure it has a 2014 date. If I get the same profile I will leave this review as is, otherwise, drink with caution!"
"O: A very seasonally festive brew that is tasty and easy drinking. Definitely worth a try and worth your money."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The pumpkin flavor is overall pretty mild, and I don't get much pumpkin spice flavor either.  I wouldn't say that that is a bad thing.  But this beer tastes more like a brown ale to me, than anything else.  There is a nice bit of nuttiness to it though."
""
""
""
"Pumpkin lager.  Light.  Refreshing.  Hint of pumpkin and spices.  Not over powering.  Could drink on a hot fall day.  Pours to a light slightly opaque golden brown orange.  Little to no head.  Traditional lager smell with a little hint of seasonal spices.  Clean and crisp in The mouth.  No real aftertaste.  Hints of pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon but again really light and subtle.  I like it. Could drink multiples unlike pumpkin ale or stout."

"Best of the Pumpkin flavored brews that I have tried"
"O- An enjoyable pumpkin beer, nice balance to the taste.   Worth picking up, spices really drive the beer. 4"

"Very enjoyable pumpkin ale.  Very rich and spicy. Nice bready and caramel notes to go along with the usual pumpkin spices.  One of the better 12 ounce bottle versions I have had."

"I think there are better representations of this type, I think the flavor is good as a novelty, but I don't think I would go again on this one."
"A pretty standard feeling pumpkin brew. It displays a beautiful orange clarity and hanging white collar. The aroma and flavor falls into the typical pumpkin pie category. A nice balance of malty sweetness verse cinnamon spice addition. Fairly clean, crisp and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""

"One of the spicier pumpkin brews that I actually enjoy quite a bit. The ginger spice feel is super fresh and there is a nice maltiness and some pumpkin to support those spices."
"The beer is bright orange with just a mild haze. Beige head that settles as a thin ring on top. Aromas of lager, fall spice. Cinnamon and nutmeg with some squash character. A bit sweet, but not too. An interesting take on a fall seasonal, going the lager route as opposed to the typical ale choice. Crisp finish with a subtle hop bitterness. A solid beer, especially if you're a fan of Oktoberfest and/or pumpkin brews."

"This is a good example of a seasonal fruit beer, not overpowering, not too cloying - to my taste just right. Spike and the crew have done it again!"

""
""
""

"This is beer #1 of my pumpkin week of Thanksgiving. Can't wait to continue the line up as the week progresses!"

"My pour produced two dense fingers of tawny head that slowly fell away to wisps, leaving some nice, sticky lacing in its wake. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy coppery-amber (SRM = > 13, ~ 17). Nose smelled heavily of cinnamon and nutmeg and I will be honest here - I am getting really tired of smelling the whole spice rack in these beers! Balance, people! And this coming from a self-avowed hophead who likes DIPAs. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, creamier than many of its ale counterparts. The taste was really muted and frankly kind of watery. What happened to the spices from the nose? They seemed to have disappeared! Finish was rather bland and nondescript. Unless they tweak the recipe for next year, I will not be revisiting this beer after the 2013 edition."
""
"I purchased this beer in Total Wine, who gives a brief write up of each of their 6 packs(or 4 packs, in this case). The beer was described, more or less, as a cross between a pumpkin beer and an Oktoberfest, both of which I enjoy. The color was a nice amber with very little head, much of what you would expect from a beer of this kind. I thought it smelled fantastic, however, the taste was where I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer. I was just expecting a bit more. The pumpkin was a bit overwhelming and, to be honest, it tasted extremely similar to Blue Moon's Harvest Pumpkin Ale, which is roughly the same price for a 6 pack. I realize this beer is not an Ale, however, to me, the taste was pretty close. Like I said, it is a good beer, just gave me nothing that made it stand out and made me want to look for it again next fall."
""
"A desent beer."
""
""
"Overall: A very good Octoberfest beer, that is well balanced in its own right. The malty sweetness plays well with the spicing and evens out any of that astringency from spice and pumpkin. Very drinkable!"
""
""
""
"O: Very sessionable. I bet it's great on tap. A nice Halloween treat."
"Had this pour from a bottle into a tasting glass. This was on a night when I was trying several other beers so there is an accurate benachmark to go off of. This Was one of the lower ranking pumpkins that felt like it had a higher ABV than most others I've had. I like my pumpkins mild and this one was hoppy like other Terrapin beers I've had. It was also spicy with a tough finish. On the darker golden side where as I prefer the lighter pumpkins. Overall finishes in the lower half of pumpkins I've had. Picked this up in a mixed 6 pack from whole foods in PA."
""
"The pumpkin spice is muted vs. other seasonal beers that claim to cater to pumpko-philes tastes, but it comes through quite well. Overall, a great seasonal offering by Terrapin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an amber orange color that is not transparent. It glows like a jack o lantern when you hold it up to the light. Good thick off white head that stays a few seconds and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smell is all pumpkin spices a lot like pumpkin pie. Taste just like it smells. Full bodied feel in the mouth with a slight bitter aftertaste. Not the best pumpkin or Oktoberfest beer I have had but I definitely would drink another."
""
""
"Decent carbonation level, and very full bodied, flavor lingers for quite a bit. Not smooth, a little gritty. Not as balanced as it good be, it's sweet, bitter than sort of sweet again at the end. Still pretty drinkable. I think the recipe could be tweaked just a tad and it could be great, not just good like it is now. Still, glad to try another Terrapin beer, even if it's not my preferred style."
""
""
"O- very drinkable however i would not rate it as a top pumpkin ale or an Octoberfest"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - my previous experience with pumpkin beer is Blue Moon and Shipyard. This is a step up and very drinkable, but it is never gonna be my favorite seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is supposedly a variation of an Oktoberfest with pumpkins and spices, but I don't get any of the malts that is usually associated with a Märzen. It tastes more like a pumpkin ale, but with a slight bit of a clean mouthfeel that you would expect from a lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A decent interpretation of the pumpkin style popular around fall, but overall not impressive enough to warrant a second purchase."
""
"Would recommend!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This offering is a lager, unlike most pumpkin beers which are ales. Still, this is a solid effort and a tasty fall seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is crisp and light. Not a bad Pumpkin based beer. Worth a try."
"This is a good offering. Interesting pumpkin offering and would be worth trying again."

"too bad I cant get it in CT."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall worth a try but not something that I would see continuing to produce they would be better off making a real pumpkin ale. Think of Terrapin as the DFH of the south they make some good brews but other times its like wtf were you thinking."
""
""
""
"Terrapin Pumpkinfest from Terrapin Beer Company is copper colored in my pint glass. Not a lot of foam here. I can smell faint pumpkin with some spices thrown in. As far as flavor goes, it's decent. Everything is accounted for. There just ain't much special going on here. I would probably pass on this in the future at the current price. As a note of interest, my beer was a 4-pack and cost $9.99. To me, this is a little pricey for an average beer. Terrapin, put these in 6ers and I could see myself buying some more in the future."
""
" The taste is slightly caramel tinged with some woodiness of cinnamon and nutmeg with a mild grain toastiness and light herbal hop flavor with a gentle fruity tinge of pumpkin flesh adding an almost melon or vegetal taste with a mild spice in the finish giving a unified flavor profile. Overall this is a very drinkable pumpkin beer whether it is a lager or not …I actuall like the way the lager qualities work with the spiciness and adds to the drinkability with a more dry character in general."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really like this beer, but it could only get better if the taste if the taste was better. I don't think i'd go out of my way to grab this, but if it was there and i had a choice, i might choose this over other pumpkin ale-like beers."
"O - Just a big disappointment, I liked the idea of this beer, but I have no clue where that weird bacon flavor is coming from, just unbearable."
""
""
"Overall: I too like the idea of combining these two fall styles (and favorites of mine in the fall). It feels and tastes more like an Oktoberfest with pumpkin flavor. Easy to drink at 6.10%, but has enough pumpkin flavor to not be a session beer. Cheers!!"

"O-Terrapin makes great beer, but this one was disappointing. It is a spice bomb. I was expecting more pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think of this more as a hybrid of Oktoberfest and Pumpkin beer rather than just a pumpkin beer - kind of interesting that it is a lager rather than an ale. I generally like pumpkin beers but I was not the hugest fan of this one - it reminds me of a spiced Oktoberfest with a hint of pumpkin."

"O: A nice pumpkin lager, but a little simplistic. Lagering seems to have made smoother and easier drinking, however. Nutmeg stands out a little strong but I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"Recommended Vintage: Try a bottle at 1 year!"
""
""
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Pumpkin Ale/Oktoberfest hybird poured a hazy orange color, produced a small off white head, poor retention and it left an average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh roasted pumpkin, caramel and pumpkin pie spice. Medium in body, this ale had a malted grain base, pumpkin, caramel and a nice amount of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice- in fact it borders on being over spiced. With that said it is a very worthy Pumpkin ale- Nice session beer = first example of a Oktoberfest/Pumpkin Ale I have sampled."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A distinctly better-than-average spiced pumpkin ale. Not too flashy, not quite a dessert beer, packs plenty of distinctive flavor without being overbearing and feels like something you'd want to drink on Thanksgiving with mashed potatoes and stuffing. Recommended, I'd buy it again in season if I had the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought they did a good job marrying the styles of an Oktoberfest and a pumpkin ale."
"Overall, a nice unique attempt at a pumpkin beer and it just barely misses the mark. If the spice was dialed back a little bit this would be an outstanding drinkable pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: what can I say. I'll give this one a whirl again, but I was kinda bummed out by this. I'm hoping its because I've been on a porter and stout kick that this one came off as watery and bland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was one of the pumpkin brews that I thoroughly enjoyed, well balanced and great tasting, great fall beer!"
"4.5"
"This was a pumpkin beer that was closer to ""holiday spice"" than ""pumpkin"". Why exactly? I'm not too sure. Maybe it was the balance of spices? Though I would definitely say nutmeg was the most prominent and may even argue it was slightly overpowering compared to the rest. All in all, a decent brew, definitely a nice holiday warmer."
""
""
"I poured this one into a pint glass, it has a copper color body with no head or lace to it. The smell has a very nice aray of pumpkin spices and pumpkin flesh. The taste is upfront of spices and then a mellow flavor of pumpkin come throug. The mouth feel is good, almost the constincey of a lager. well balanced and carbonated. Overall this is a good pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- You'd better like nutmeg if you wanna get into this brew. A good stab at the style but could use some toning down in the spice department."
""
""
""
"Overall - good, like the lack of bitter and the sweetness isn't too much. Very drinkable for 6.1% with no real presence of alcohol flavor."
""
""
"Overall: A decent pumpkin brew, interesting its a lager. Solid and from a beer geek standpoint, a pretty cool idea. Lacks the fullness of the its ale brethren."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was an interesting experiment, but it proved one thing to my mind: Don't mix pumpkin and Marzens... the ingredients just don't mesh well together."
"as far as pumpkin beers go, this is the most unique do far this year. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Love the concept of taking an O-fest and a Pumpkin Ale and smashing them together. A good brew all around I just have a problem with the spicing upfront, needs to be dialed down a bit. A fun brew to quaff back."
""
"III like it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The head on this beer was about average with okay retention. The aroma was excellent with strong (but good) overtones of pumpkin pie spice. The beer had a great hop flavor that is often missing in this style. This is a beer that I would gladly have a second. In general a good beer for this style it was great."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer rocks. One of the best fall beers out there and right up there in the argument for a top-notch pumpkin beer. Would drink this again and again."
""
"This is a lovely beer. Smells fresh and spicy, and can taste cloves and cinnamon immediately with almost a fresh apple cider finish. Light and lovely. I don't taste tons of pumpkin, but this is not a sweet beer at all, very spicy. Really great fall beer."
"Pours a very lightly hazed auburn color with a slim head that shrinks to a bubbly collar. The aroma is brimming with pumpkin pie spices. Some bread, brown sugar, and not much pumpkin, but very pleasant all around. More of the Oktoberfest side shows up first in the flavor...spices, caramel, mild sweet bread, toast. Smooth, slick, fairly light on the carbonation. I can dig it."
""
""
""
"More nutty than pumpkin. Nice clove and spice taste. Dirty brown and slightly opaque. Slightly under carbonated. Paired nicely with pumpkin pie gelato. Nice was more clove. Light feel of a lager. Thought the low carbonation was that first bottle but it was the same for the next two."
""
""
"This beer really should be moved to Oktoberfest since that is what it is...says so on the label at least, but I digress, beer is medium in body, sweet and gourdy on the front with a decent but slightly heavy on the finish. A little too sweeet for an Oktoberfest but overall it is fine. I'd consider having it again."
"You get a finger’s worth of fizzy foam which dissolves down at a steady clip, mostly smaller bubbles, dark off-white color, the lacing is wispy to close to nonexistent. Very clear and bright brownish amber hued liquid, becomes more zinc orange towards the outer reaches with a final shift into yellow, hardly any visible carbonation. Big clove and nutmeg in the nose, vanilla and cocoa along with, of course, pumpkin, pie crust to scone for breadiness, mild yeastiness, has a liqueur like quality even as at times there’s a short burst of grass and pepper. Medium-bodied, has a hard mouth feel, lacks graceful movement and flow. The carbonation is light, what’s there has a tight prickle. Dry on the whole, the ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon has a spicy cumin edge too. Cocoa powder more than honey, brown sugar or caramel, in keeping with dryness. Whisper of peach, apricot fruit, any sweetness more derived from that pie dough, baked goods component. Loses any hoppy bite here but does have a mineral water feel which aids a fresher finish. Not sure it finds a clear direction and then takes it but pleasant enough, if quaffed uncritically."
"Not a bad beer, but just does not stand up to the offerings from Southern Tier, Cigar City, Weyebacher and others."
""
""
"I got really excited when I saw that Terrapin has a pumpkin beer. Taste has really nice nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and pumpkin spice with a smokey flavor. A pretty strong beer. Medium body, decent head. A good brownish orange color. I will buy again."
""
""
"I see what they were going for, a pumpkin octoberfest combo, but really the octoberfest side of this beer doesnt come out at all."
""
""
"O. A good beer and unique combination that actually works pretty well. The big question is: why is this necessary? Answer: I'm not sure it is. I'm also not sure I'd return, as there's just not enough here to keep me coming back. Too light for a pumpkin and too spicy for an oktoberfest, it leaves me wanting one of each just to drink to style. But I like to reward ingenuity and good craftsmanship, and this is certainly that in spades. A nice little beer that I'll return to next fall, but I'm not sure I'd ever want more than one in a season."
""
"O: Another tasty seasonal pumpkin beer, certainly worth another sampling."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- If only it tasted as good as it smells. Overall, not bad though."
"Overall. It's light but flavorful. I don't feel that the spices are over done in this one. Light sweetness that is washed down with a tight carbonation."
"Overall, a solid brew from Terrapin. I had it 2 years ago and was happy to be able to revisit it this year. Would definitely drink again; nice fall ale."
"Overall: These are usually good or bearable beers. Just dont think many of these that have pumpkin as the feature flavor as oppose to an addition/note can be great. But for the genre, this one is good."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not about to become my favorite beer, but a good fall beer. Really captures some good autumnal flavors, though (like most ""pumpkin"" beers) the taste of actual pumpkin is nowhere to be found. Thoroughly decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good beer. Definitely a combo of a Octoberfest and Pumpkin. It's great for those Fall football days."
""
"Pours a dark but clear amber, moderate head. Scent brings ample pie spices and pumpkin to the front with a nice cinnamon and vanilla whiff. Taste follows suit, slightly brown sugar sweet, ample spices, creamy pumpkin pie with some nice vanilla notes. A touch lighter than prefered, needs a bit more creaminess. Solid seasonal beer."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, nice new pumpkin beer to add to my list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is an interesting beer. It is definitely tasty and drinkable, and I think it’s a cool undertaking to combine two great fall styles – Oktoberfest and pumpkin beers. However, this beer is only an average example of each style. It doesn’t have the abundance of hearty malt aromas and flavors that I’d like in an Oktoberfest and it only has a mild and subtle pumpkin pie aroma and flavor. I’ve kind of run into this a lot with Terrapin when they try to combine styles, but they definitely get bonus points for trying and for creating a beer that is both tasty and unique."
""
""
""
""
"D - A solid seasonal offering from Terrapin... While this is supposed to be a hybrid of a Marzen and a Pumpkin Ale this one definitely drifts towards Pumpkin Ale status (except for the fact that it is actually a lager)... Deserves to be mentioned in the large second tier of pumpkin beers falling a bit short of world class status, but is still better than many of the other offerings out there..."
""
""
"Overall I give points for originality since I can't think of any other pumpkin Oktoberfest's. Not really worth a six pack or case but a good beer regardless."
""
""
""
"A few frills aside, this is a plainy-decent and well-spiced pumpkin lager. Can't say that I've had a pumpkin lager before. I get the mashup of styles between pumpkin beer and Oktoberfest, but it's a spiced lager with a lot of seasonal flair and some pumpkin meat. Awarding a higher rating as a promising pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
"OK, NOT MUST HAVE!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the few pumpkin's I can actually stomach this time of the year, and my go to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was pretty nice. Would be good after a heaping plate of turkey and dressing."
""
"O - A delicious seasonal beer. An interesting blend of pumpkin ale and Oktoberfest styles. Terrapin absolutely nailed the level of spice for my taste. I don't know exactly what this beer is, but I don't care. I'll definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a fairly clear copper color with a cream colored head. Definitely a strong pie spice aroma to this. Lots of nutmeg and all spice with perhaps a hint of vanilla. A nice malty sweetness, too. The flavor is quite nice. Plenty of malt sweetness to it with a solid, but not overdone, pie spice flavor. Good nutmeg, all spice, and a hint of cinnamon, too. Light in body with medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"O – Nice cinnamon character, but the vinegar note really throws things off and the profile is relatively light on the pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best pumpkin beers I've head, mostly because this is one of the few that I would have more than one of in a single sitting. All of the positives of a pumpkin beer and none of the negatives of an overly sweet beer. This smells like pumpkin pie in a bottle but tastes like a well-balanced and perfectly spiced pumpkin beer. Would definitely drink again!"
"O - At least as good as other pumpkins I've had, lighter than desired as most but overall a good spice filled beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm pretty sure this is the first pumpkin lager I've had. It is light and nicely refreshing, but the spices are just a touch off for my taste. Still one of the better pumpkin brews I've had this year."
""
""
"Pours a nice amber, almost pumpkin colored with an off white head. Smell is not what I was expecting from a pumpkin beer. Smelled more like a Belgian Wit to me, with a touch of nutmeg. To me it tasted like a Belgian wit, with a saison-pumpkin mouthfeel. Not sure that I am describing it well, but I definitely got a soft mouthfeel from the pumpkin but the spices were on the dry side for your typical ""pumpkin beer"". I was going to say that it almost reminded me of a lager in terms of the mouthfeel and then I read the bottle and saw that it is a hybrid of a pumpkin beer and a märzen. Overall it is an interesting brew, not what I was expecting going in and it definitely doesn't fit the typical pumpkin beer genre, but an enjoyable brew."
"This is my first pumpkin beer and while not bad I would've liked a little more depth. Overall a decent beer from a great brewery."
"{May 2013 update: drinking a ~9 month old 2012 which is, if anything, better}"
"Overall: Just alright. The bitterness in the finish doesn't really go with the rest of the beer."
"O: Pretty solid for what it is. A good pumpkin beer and one I would pick up again. Skal."
"O – Interesting mix of beers here. I liked the back end better then the front. I was looking for a little more pumpkin at front and the heavy spice presence overshadowed it a bit. Overall though this is a solid good tasting brew."
"O-as far as tastes go, this is awesome. however, i do have a big complaint...$11 for a bomber? seriously? now this beer was sitting between a CCB Good Gourd and a Southern Tier Pumking, both being much cheaper than this. The only reason i picked this up was because I've never had it before. I realize its supposed to be different from those, but let's face it...this is just another pumpkin beer. As long as the price stays, i promise I'll never buy this again. If it were to come in 6-packs for the same price, then yes, I'd definitely pick up one of those. It it a great and unique beer, but for the price I'd rather mix some pumking with my favorite german oktoberfests."
"Pours out amber with a nice frothy white head. Active carbonation visible. Lots of pumpkin and spice in the nose mixed in with cinnamon and stewed vegetables. Noticeable bitterness about halfway through the sip, good lager character to it. Again, cinnamon shines through in the taste, along with some pumpkin and a hefty blend of spices, pretty much smells like it tastes. This beer is crisp and refreshing, has a nice moderate mouthfeel to it, and is extremely smooth. Overall, I'd prefer this pumpkin-lager to a pumpkin ale any day."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: A pumpkin spiked Oktoberfest, hard to disagree with such an idea. This may be my definitive Fall beer from here on out."
"O- A good pumpkin beer but not the best. I love the smell but the taste is lacking."
"o - overall, exactly as advertised...""Although this is a pumpkin beer, it is a lager"" - certainly not an in your face pumpkin beer. more beery than most pumpkin beers and overall pretty good."
"O- In top 3 favorites with Schlafly and Pumking so far, but I have a ways to go with Greater Pumpkin, TREAT, and Double Pumpkin all waiting to be drank. Nothing was overpowering or unbalanced. Can't wait to relax and drink this more this fall..."
"O: A good beer that is a nice combination between the Marzen and pumpkin ale styles. It doesn't overwhelm with pumpkin spices and finishes clean and dry like a Marzen."
"Did a side by side comparison with last years Side project 8 Thanks to Jimmy! Definately different but both good in their own rights."
"O - A solid pumpkin brew. It needs more flavor to it though. Perhaps some more pumpkin and/or spices."
"O - This was a nice surprise. It's not far from my favorite example (Good Gourd) and had some nice flavors. It was particularly good as it warmed. I'd be happy to buy a 6pk when I see it next."
"Had a six pack over the weekend and found it to worthy of the ten dollar price tag. Nice amber appearance and good head. I found the nose to be excellent with cinnamon, nutmeg, and spice. Each one tasted better than the one before, would highly recommend."
"There's no hint of the lager yeast in this one so it's surprising that this is a pumpkin lager and not a pumpkin ale. Pretty good all around."
"It needs more of either spice or pumpkin to make it great. But, is a very good tasting beer and one that I will gladly drink."
"This was the hardest review Ive done because its so damn hot and cold. Some drinks are world class, some drinks are failures. Inconsistencies really ruined this one for me."
"D: My favorite pumpkin beer so far this year. It is not dominant on either pumpkin pie or pumpkin spices which I can appreciate. I feel like Dogfish head is more like eating pie and Southern Tier's is more like warming spices; which both are good in their own regard but Pumpkinfest is a great balance between the two, by far my favorite lager I've ever had:) I love Terrapin."
"Overall- I was extremely impressed, they did a great job and I will continue to buy and enjoy this beer. Cheers!"
"O: A unique blend of pumpkin and octoberfest, definitely one of the better pumpkin beers out there."
"O - An excellent fall beer! A mash up of an Octoberfest beer with pumpkin. Nice spice flavors with pumpkin."
"This brew pours out as a nice looking amber color. The head is a little fizzy and tan in color. The lacing is minimal for sure. The spices on the nose scream autumn loud and clear. The taste of the beer is balanced nicely between the spicy pumpkin flavor to the beer hidden inside of it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a good charge of carbonation to it. Overall I enjoyed this pumpkin ale and wouldn't mind trying it again one day."
"D - pretty solid pumpkin ale here...definitely full of spice and a huge nose. I think the nutmeg was just a tad bit too much, but this was still excellent. I would gladly drink this guy all night. Great stuff Terrapin!"
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a slightly cloudy dark amber copper color with a big fluffy 2 finger head that is slow to recede. Raw pumpkin notes in the nose, nothing too sweet and slightly vegetable smelling. The taste is better than the nose with a slightly sweet start with spices and pumpkin flavors. Slightly alcohol in the end. Medium mouthfeel. Ends with a lingering bitterness and pumpkin flavor. It's just ok."
"D: Overall a decent pumpkin ale. Not my favorite but I wouldn't mind having it once a year."
"From fall brew ranking notes (2010): Clear cola coloured body with a thin tan head that fades relatively quickly. Aroma of nutmeg, pumpkin, alcohol and a touch of cherries. Medium-bodied; Strong spicey bite at first with a lot of nutmeg and allspice and a touch of cardamom with some pumpkin flavours and a touch of alcohol coming through at the end. Aftertaste shows some sweet caramel and a bit of malt, but the spices dominate the palate. Overall good beer."
"I'm not a fan of pumpkin beers in general, and this does nothing to change my mind. In my opinion, this needs more malt, more sweetness, and less spice."
"Very enjoyable, but it tastes like a regular pumpkin beer to me. I don't really get any of the Oktoberfest characteristics from the beer, other than the caramel and toffee which are typically present in other pumpkin beers."
"D: I know this isn't in the pumpkin beer category, but I still consider it to be one. Not my favorite and I think there are better ones out there. Needs to pull back from the spices a bit and I think it would be a bit better."
"3.0 D: Again, not bad, but there are other pumpkin beers I'd pick over this everytime."
"Pours a nice dark amber with a tan head. Aroma of pumpkin sweet caramel, cinnamon. Taste is sweet malt, pumpkin, cinnamon, and sweet spices. Palate is nice med body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet malts and spices, pumpkin, some brown sugar with some slight bitterness adds some balance. Has lingering sweet pumpkin aftertaste almost like a pumpkin pie. Overall a nice and interesting brew for the holiday season."
"D - After reading the lable I was wondering how this was going to work out...and to my surprise I think it turned out pretty well...I was able to pick out each part of the beer and it wasn't overly spiced or overly sweet...a nice beer that you should try and determine whether you like the premise or not"
"Pours a clean deep amber to orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet pumpkin and spice, almost creamy. In the taste, spicy, hints of cinnamon, and pumpkin, more flavor at the end than in the beginning. A spice bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, and a small dry cinnamon and spice in the aftertaste. By far one of the top pumpkin beers that I have had."
"Extremely well balanced throughout and very tasty, with the cinnamon and nutmeg leading the malt and tiny hop bite along by the nose. Not too thick on the tongue and extremely easy to drink, this one was gone before I knew it."
"(D)- Not bad. Far more spicier than what the smell led me to believe. The bitterness started to really bother me."
"d - decent beer but one of my least favorite pumpkins."
"The appearance is amber with a small head. The smell is pumpkin pie with a decent amount of both pumpkin and spices but also a sweet caramel malt. The taste is like the aroma with a bitter and spicy finish not unlike pepper and cinnamon. The palate is smooth. Overall a good beer."
"Had a bottle from Abe's Cold Beer. I like this one. There was a lot more natural pumpkin flavor and less spice dominance that a lot of pumpkin beers have. It tasted like I was eating pumpkin or some other squash, not just drinking pumpkin pie spice beer. It was backed up with a toasty chocolate barley character, making a cocoa pumpkin taste. It's great to find a fresh take on the pumpkin beer that also happens to be delicious. Check this one out."
"D: An interesting hybrid of Oktoberfest and pumpkin ale, this 6.1% ABV fall amalgamation is pretty darn drinkable. It takes the best of two great seasonal styles, the smooth, malty drinkability of a marzen and the spicy, roasted sweetness of a pumpkin ale, and levels the difference out. I'd certainly try it again if i came across it."
"Average beer, nothing too earth-shattering but a nice fall seasonal for sure."
"Drinkability: decent pumpkin beer that hits the mark for the style. Easy drinking. Worthy of a try."
"Pours orange copper with a nice off white head. Good deal of lacing on the way down. The nose is nice and definitely quite interesting. Can definitely understand the concept. Undertones of pumpkin and squash with a bit of bread and some slight sweetness. The taste is pumpkin, bread, squash, and a bit of caramel. Nice carbonation and a medium body. Drinks fairly well and definitely a unique concept."
"D-easy drinking pumpkin brew, good to start some friends out on who normally drink busch light."
"D - The blend is good...save for the lack of pumpkin carry-over into the flavor. The nose is predominantly pumpkin while the flavor is Oktoberfest. The should marry the two with a better blend to become one great super-beer! Lakefront's Pumpkin Lager is a far superior pumpkin lager. This has a few adjustments to go before it gets to the next level but it's certainly drinkable as-is."
"D- I'd bring this as an example of where pumpkin beers should start, and where they can go from. Sure it is decent, but would I want this over other offerings? Probably not again. Still nice one to tick off and try."
"Against Pumpkin Ales however, where the spices are expected, this one sits at the low end of the center of the mediocre pulp that dominates the field. In this style it would get about a 2.5 as well. Being a Pumpkin Ale enthusiast, there are a dozen other beers I would recommend before this one."
"D - goes down easy."
"D: This is a solidly made, drinkable beer."
"Until I find something I love, I think this style just isn't for me. I've heard the Weyerbacher and Hoppin' Frog Imperial Pumpkins are both good, so I'll try to get those and review before the season is over."
"D: This is a perfect blend of pumpkin ale and Marzen. Bravo."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, sourdough lingering with effervescent carbonation tickling the palate."
"This is one of the thicker Marzens I've had in terms of mouthfeel. The heft of the body suits the vegetal flavor profile of this beer. Drinkability is pretty damn good. A lowish ABV and refreshing lager sensibility make for a nice Fall session candidate."
"Probably too drinkable."
"Drinkability = Not the best pumpkin ale (Dogfish Head is still the champ on that one), but definitely much better than most I've had. Very smooth and easy to drink. Perfect for sitting on the porch as the leaves fall."
"A very nice mix of two great fall styles."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Many better brews in the style, ahem, Pumpking, ahem, Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin, ahem! Not the first to hunt down for the style. Many better, unbiased, brews to try prior to this one."
"All in all, I'm disappointed. The sweetness is nearly non-existent, the spices are downplayed and it just doesn't seem done well for style."
"D: This is one of the best pumpkin beers I have had. The spice flavor is spot on, this brew is gonna be hard to beat."
"Very drinkable."
"The flavor honors the Oktoberfest base with a crisp, nutty malt presence. Solid backing of aforementioned spices don't overwhelm the palate, but definitely accentuate the maltiness. Mouthfeel is spot-on: crisp, medium-thin body with a tightly packed carbonation level that complements the spice levels to a ""T". Overall, a more-than-serviceable Pumpkin/Oktoberfest hybrid. Easy drinking, lots of flavor. Don't pass this one up!"
"Over all a good beer that I would certainly have again."
"On-tap at The Pit served in a 10oz glass a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was crisp pumpkin spice and sweet caramel malts. The taste was a nice amount of sweet malts with a nice balance of pumpkin and spice, especially in the lingering finish. The beer is very crisp and smooth with decent carbonation. This is just an all around great beer."
"Overall-- highly enjoyable, easy to drink, and pretty darn tasty... for a pumpkin lager!"
"D: Easily drinkable, partly because the flavors are overall lacking in complexity or strength. Disappointing flavor after a very good aroma."
"All in all, what a disappointment. This beer is mediocre in every way, except for that fantastic aroma. What a waste."
"Pours a deep amber color with a thick tan head that retains very well, quite appealing. The aroma is pretty heavy on the spices (cinnamon, cardamom, clove, orange zest, black pepper), along with caramel malt, pumpkin, and brown sugar. The flavor is also heavy on the spices upfront (notes of cardamom, cinnamon, clove, orange zest, white pepper), along with caramel and brown sugar, toasted bread, and some slight floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium, and drinkability is limited by the heavy spicing. Pretty solid pumpkin ale, but the heavy spices seem out of balance."
"Fresh 12oz bottle picked up in VA this week. The beer is clear, copper colored, with a thin off-white foam. It smells exactly as you'd hope a pumpkin ale would smell, all the pumpkin pie spices like cinnamon and nutmeg but with a substantially malty base. The malt lends a bread-like quality that makes this seem even more like pumpkin pie, in aroma and taste. As with most pumpkin beers the spices give an unpleasant aftertaste, at least not to my preferences. Still though this is one of the best stabs at the style, I could definitely go for it again."
"22 oz. bottle, Side Project 8 (almost a year old). Pours a slightly hazy, dark copper color with a quickly diminishing frothy, off-white head. Aroma is sweet and pale malts, pumpkin, allspice, a hint of bubblegum, and a bit nutty. Flavor is caramel, light pumpkin and spice, a touch of cinnamon, and a touch of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, decent carbonation, slightly dry and bitter finish. Good beer, nice flavors, well drinkable."
"Nutmeg and cinnamon are on the forefront of the taste with an exceptionally clean feeling that I am guessing is due to the lager. Spicing is kept at moderate levels and is actually pretty dry overall, with a light toasty malt presence. Goes down so very smooth and quick, tasting great even though it is nearly a year old. Not much negative I can say about this one, an excellent melding of two fall classics. I really enjoyed it."
"D - Very solid pumpkin beer, 2nd only to DFH Punkin' as my favorite. Really wish I would have been able to try this fresh, may have easily been my favorite. Can't wait for Fall to get here so I can get some more pumpkin beers!"
"Drinkability: I really like the flavors, and I absolutely love the nose; I do wish the mouth was a bit thicker and creamier and that the carbonation was more consistent. Overall though, as noted earlier, if this was fresh, I believe this beer may be unstoppable."
"Terrapin does it again. They manage to strike the right note while combining two disparate styles."
"Served from bottle into a Euro pint. Pours a nice copper color with a one-finger white head that quickly subsides to a minimal height. There was slight lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of pumpkin and cloves. The flavor was of pumpkin, sugar, and spicy. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was not that bad for a pumpkin-style ale. Actually I typically do not like them, but this one was quite enjoyable and is by far my favorite pumpkin ale tried thus far."
"Drinkability: I generally like pumpkin beers, but as I am not a big fan of the Oktoberfest style, this one does not do much for me"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was OK, although all the spices made it a little less drinkable. Would have really liked more actual pumpkin flavors and aroma rather then all the spice flavor. If it had xmas label on it instead of pumpkin I probably would have thought it fit that season just as well."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/3.5"
"Value: Got it for $3.99, what a steal!"
"D: Above Average Pumpkin Ale, but is Overpriced"
"D - Solid pumpkin ale with a pretty well-rounded flavor despite being rather heavy on spice in the aroma. Not one of my top examples of the style, but good nonetheless."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one quite a bit... Sort of a hybrid if you will and I thought it worked...."
"Thanks Grant!"
"M/D - Light and very crisp in the mouth. I'm not a fan of pumpkin beers at all, but this one is pretty good actually. A little too sweet to drink a lot of, but putting the bomber down isnt much of a problem."
"Pretty good job from the guys in Athens."
"Drinkability: Average, and not one of the best Side Projects. This one was a little ""high up"" in the mouth and nose for a pumpkin ale, and - not that it wasn't an interesting one - it wasn't exactly what I like out of mine. The spices were a little too subdued, the malt backbone a little too rough in places, and though certainly the abv% is right for enhanced drinkability, I just wasn't sure if I wanted to. Worth a try, though not worth picking up more than one or cellaring."
"The lighter body offsets the intense flavors nicely, making it easy to drink."
"Pours a medium brown with a nice tan head. Good lacing and retention. Nose has pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon and some grainy malts. Taste has bready malts and a subtle pumpkin pie presence. Light to medium body is well carbonated. Nice pumpkin inspired Oktoberfest."
"D - Delicious, too bad it's a one time brew (or so they're claiming). I'd pick up a case of this for Thanksgiving/Christmas after-meal beer if they come out with a version of it next year."
"D - And with this, I think I am done with pumpkin ales for the year. I'd really like to see an unfiltered bottle conditioned pumpkin ale from someone....even the stronger pumpkin ales are getting a bit dull to me."
"Drinkability: high drinkibability for this one, many pumpkin beers seem to overdue to the taste making it a beer that one can only really enjoy sparingly, this beer overcomes this problem by incorporating the ""fest"" part to form a more drinkable beer,"
"Drinkability: A top notch brew that walks the line between pumpkin and oktoberfest IMO it takes the finer qualities of both styles and combines them into a very tasty brew. Definitely on the sweeter side, it's a very refreshing brew that has done the trick to finish off my day."
"Flavor is very similar to the aroma. Fuller end of medium with a very nice balance of Octoberfest/Marzen and Pumpkin beer flavors. Toasty caramel and rye malts are prominent up front with a subtle hint of biscuit followed by a slight sweet pumpkin presence and a very prominent spice profile. Hints of cinnamon and brown sugar as well as some strong clove notes, subtle vanilla and ginger. Pretty well balanced with a nice hybrid of flavors from the two styles. No alcohol warmth to speak up making it pretty drinkable. Slightly medicinal in the finish. Complex and interesting. Recommended for fans of both styles."
"Drinkability is decent, though the finish and mouthfeel leave a bit to be desired. Nice nose, and nice front end though."
"D- probably the best pumpkin beer ive had. the label says this is a cross between a pumpkin beer and an oktoberfest, and i think it comes off as just that. definitely reminds me of fall. it is still kind of a novelty beer to me, so one is plenty."
"I like the effort here by Terrapin to try for a mix of two different fall favorites, as I think that they are really on to something here. The taste comes off a bit better than the aroma does but I just wish that the flavors were just a little more memorable overall. Still, this is definitely worth a look and I wouldn't be surprised at all to see this as a new seasonal in 12 oz bottles next fall."
"Crispy and malty on the nose, with a subtle spice hit of pumpkin pie, nutmeg and maybe some cinnamon. Not overly pureed sweetness that you might find in a typical pumpkin beer. Dry mouthfeel, very crisp malt flavor. The pumpkin-ness kicks back in on the finish, leaving the palate a little sweet. I would drink this all day long, if offered at a football game."
"Flavor is spice and malt focused like the aroma. Both cinnamon and cloves come through in the flavor, with cinnamon still the dominant spice flavor. There's also quite a bit of malt here and I'm thinking pumpkin. There's a flavor in here that is a bit rich & maybe slightly starchy & full bodied. Most pumpkin ales I've had have lots of pumpkin spice but not much pumpkin. I think what is extra/interesting here is the extra pumpkin flavor. A little bit of hop bitterness, but mostly it finishes with spiciness from spices, not hops. This beer had a nice carbonation & full mouthfeel that I really liked. I have only had half a dozen or so pumpkin beers, but this is the best one that I've had. An enjoyable beer."
"High on the drinkability meter. I really enjoyed this one, so it's a shame they're only doing it once."
"Very drinkable and a nice addition to the fall. Very glad I have the chance to try this."
"It works. Pumpkifest has the equation down for a style I'm sensative to. Things get even more interesting when you drink this with a slice of pumpkin pie."
"D - This is a good beer that could be enjoyed on a cold winter night, but since it is a limited release I'm not sure I will have many of those nights to enjoy it. Drinkable, but it could be better."
"I bought this bottle at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA."
"D - Pretty drinkable, it is well balanced despite being a bit on the dry side. The aroma is very nice, but the flavor suffers from the cloying, medicinal spice character that is unfortunately common to the style. The malt character is the saving grace, it is thick and rich but not at all sweet and it gives the beer enough depth to survive the spices. This is a decent limited release, but I wouldn't buy it again if they made it next year."
"Pours a clear dark orange with fast fading thin off-white head, spotty lacing. Smell: pumpkin pie spices, light toasted and toffee, a little raw butternut/pumpkin, munich. Taste: lightly toasted, toffee, cinnamon/allspice, nutty squash at the end of the sip. Mouthfeel: crisp but too thin, with a near-gritty ground spice finish. Comes off as a decent ofest with pie spices added. Took most of the bomber to get into. The pumpkin is there, but I think the munich malt and spices take center stage. Still enjoyable, but could use more substance, especially in the feel."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, nice pumpkin note, nutmeg/cinnamon, and a good dose of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, another very tasty brew from Terrapin."
"Pumpkinfest is I believe one of the better Pumpkin beers for the season, so I do think the experiment succeeded. I think I like it better than your average straight up pumpkin beer but perhaps not as much as your average Oktoberfest. Or maybe it's the other way around! In any case you will not be disappointed in trying this beer."
"Thanks to Bhalter8 for this brew. Pours a nice clear amber into my Terrapin pint glass with a one inch white head. This is a nice looking lager. The smell is a little disappointing, it smells like the over use of pumpkin spices. Luckily the taste doesn't match the smell. The spices mix well with sweet malts to create a pretty unique beer. Light to medium body, very smooth and drinkable. Sweet pumpkin spice aftertaste. One of the better pumpkin beers I've had to date."
"The mouth is a bit on the light side, a characterstic common to many of the Side Projects, unfortunately. Not a lot of carbonation present on the tongue. I do like how this one tastes though. It's not a big smack of cheap pumpkin. Rather, it's a light flavoring with some spice presence of nutmeg, cinnamon, and hints of allspice. A hazy tobacco flavor on the finish. The aftertaste reminded me a light cigar. Not too bad. Not the greatest of the style, but a decent one."
"D- Overall, this is up there with some of the better pumpkin ales. Another solid brew in the Side Project series. Recommended!"
"Bleh, I've only had a handful of pumpkin ales this year and this one is reminding me why I don't bother much with the style. It's all spice and not much else, and even has a few strange elements to it. I don't find this one to be very successful."
"A very nice pumpkin ale with a nutty, pumpkin flavor and not too sweet or over spiced like many examples. Tastes like a pumpkin beer rather than a pumpkin pie beer. Smells nutty, and like baked pumpkin with a hint of spice. Even nuttier in the taste- you can really tell that the pumpkin is in the squash family here- almost reminiscent of baked butternut squash, but even a bit earthier. This blends nicely with the relatively mild earthy hops, a nice creaminess and just a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon. Just a touch of sweetness. The nutty lightly carmelized roasty flavors keep bringing me back for another sip. Delicious. Smooth, creamy, and medium bodied in the mouth. One of the better side projects. Nice!"
"The beer came in the typical Terrapin side project 22 oz. bomber, and poured out the classic pumpkin orange colored, and clear. The carbonation appeared lively, and the head was one finger small but stable. The aroma was pumpkin and spices (cinnamon and nutmeg). The taste was herbal, and full of pumpkin pulp. The finish was dry, which probably was the effect of the spices. The body felt medium thick, but fluffy due to the carbonation. The aftertaste was sweet and spicy and lingered for a very long time after each sip. A very well made beer with a good deal of pumpkin flavor. If you don't like pumpkins, this would be over the top for you."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Aroma is of nutmeg, brown sugar and pumpkin pie. People at my bar can't stop drinking this shit. Memo to Terrapin/Spike: Thank you for making this side project but please do what you did with Gamma Ray and make this one an annual beer. It's too good to be a one time offering, you know it, I know it, everyone knows it. I understand that this one is a hybrid, either way its at the top of the pumpkin heap of beers. Taste follows the aromas pretty well and I do detect some of the traditional ""Octoberfest"" flavors in the background, but pumpkin flavors dominate the taste profile and its truly a tasty and refreshing joy to drink."
"Pours a deep, clear reddish amber with a thick off-white head that recedes to a small cap and leaves some spotty lacing. The aroma is massively spicy with lots of nutmeg and cinnamon and enough pumpkin to think I am sniffing a pumpkin pie. The taste is more of the same but seems to have a more prevalent pumpkin sweetness as well as some sugary sweet malts. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and extremely creamy, leaving a slightly dry and very spicy finish. I'm actually pretty impressed with this one."
"D: A little too sweet for me to have more than a pint, shared the bomber."
"D: An entire bomber will suffice. Very tasty beer that is great for the season."
"Overall I thought the bottle version was a bit smoother but other than that there weren't many differences between the two versions. Worth a shot."
"D- Easy drinking and refreshing. One of the better Octoberfest/pumpkin beers I've had. The smell is unique and the taste is great. Good job Terrapin."
"D: Pretty tasty, nice spice with subtle pumpkin. What seperates the good from the great when it comes to pumpkin beers (for me) is a bready pie crust like flavor. This one does not have it. Tasty for sure, not at the very top of pumpkin beers though."
"Poured a dark orange almost brown body with minimal head and minor lacing. A good pumpkin and nutmeg spice smell along with some minor sweet caramel malt. Smooth, medium-bodied with a mild pumpkin and cinnamon taste. Slightly creamy, goes down easy along with a little spice and some sweetness as well. A good pumpkin ale but not at the top of the heap."
"I like this one, but it lacks the great coalescence of spice and sweetness that I love so much about Pumking, which has become my benchmark for imperial pumpkins."
"A mix of a Fest lager and pumpkin ale now thats a mix.Poured ino a imperial nonic a clear burnt orange with a tinge of bronze,a thinner slight off white head atop.Light pumpkin pie spice in the nose,clove,cardamom,and cinnamon mainly,it is pretty light though.A nice mix of pumpkin spice and a crisp toasty finish,one of the better pumpkin ales I have had in awhile flavor wise.This pumpkin ale is not overly sweet and spiced up and is very drinkable,very nice."
"All things considered, a good pumpkin beer. 22 oz was plenty though."
"Very good pumpkin beer by Terrapin. Got this one on my first trip to Charleston Beer Exchange. I saw they had it on draught and immediately got it. They nailed this one pretty good. Apperance was ok, nothing to write home about. The stuff that matters though, smell and taste, were great. Smell was just like a fresh pumpkin pie and oh so buttery. Taste was just like you'd imagine a good pumpkin pie would be. Not too much cinnamon, slight earthiness of the pumpkin, and buttery goodness. The more it warms up, the more I like it. Definitely in my top 3 favorite pumpkin beers."
"A tasty pumpkin ale overall."
"Drinkability...well it tastes good but this is a 22 oz. I don't know about having a few. Still..I won't take down the rating on this category for that."
"Notes: I had high expectations for the marriage of two good styles and Terrapin didn't disappoint. I'm sure some will not like it because some people don't like pie tasting beer, but this is what I have been waiting for. Most pumpkin beers are too spicy and hoppy for me, but this one is just right. I literally tastes like pie in your mouth, all the way down to the crumbly crust."
"I wasnt expecting anything from this one. All of the other beers in this series have been average at best. Not only is this the best one in the series by far, it may be one of the best pumpkin beers I have ever had. Not overwhleming, subtle, spicy, very flavorful and very festive. A really hard style to get correct and Terrapin really nailed this one. Loved it!"
"Drinkability: I enjoyed it. Pumpkinfest, for me, was a nice amalgam of a pumpkin beer and a wholesomely bready Oktoberfest. Minus a few ounces portioned out to Roommate Chuck, I had no qualms in clearing through the entire bomber."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, carbonation is slightly prickly but goes well. Good drinkability. Perhaps a bit more body than most pumpkin ales which takes a little away slightly from the session quality, but very tasty and entirely drinkable, although perhaps a bit slower."
"Smells of straight spice. Pumpkin spice galore, but not much else. sweet and spicy. taste is similar, needed a bit more pumpkin flavor insted of straight spice. light body with a bit of tingle. very easy to drink. great beer"
"drinkability: great pumpkin beer, and maybe the best pumpkin. I have thought about someone combining these fall favorites together and Im glad Terrapin did. Nice beer"
"Overall I was really pleased with this one. I am a big fan and to do this style right takes a bit of finesses. Quite impressed with the way they pulled this one off and I would have no issue in trying it again."
