I live in the South and a damn yam is not a sweet potato! If it is sweet potatoes then they need to say what it is, anyway, this is an interesting beer and has intrigued me enough to try some of their other offerings which I have heard are much better anyway. It was a good deal for the beer considering the flavors and size of the bottle. I would suggest this one and I might purchase this one again next year. If I decide to even hop on the fall beer train. I am kind of over it at this point and this was the last one of the year and I saved it for the last ""Fall"" holiday, Thanksgiving!","humuloner22","Nov 27, 2014"

4.25,12.7,,,,,,"Autumn Maple is a great take on the pumpkin ale style. Leave it up to The Bruery to take the road less traveled and create a pumpkin ale-style beer and leave the pumpkin out completely. The yams work nicely on the mouthfeel and likely help this beer achieve the high ABV (lots of fermentable sugars in yams). The beer is spicy, sweet, and alcoholic without overdoing any of those things. Really good stuff.","hagbergl","Nov 07, 2014"

Tastes follow suit with sweet candied yams, alcohol, belgian yeast, stranger dryness and an overall strange profile.  The maple adds to the sweetness and the beer really doesn't go anywhere.  More of a chore than a pleasure to drink, but certainly interesting.","Stinkypuss","Oct 10, 2014"

The color is maple syrup brown but the taste not so much. The overall taste is balanced on tap with the bold flavors of liquid yams, spices, sweet mouthful of goodness. The bottle is lack of any of yams and its heat(alcohol)  overpowers it. It's very inconsistent to what I tasted on tap   then from the bottle. Go figure! Cheers.","Flip4beers","Aug 28, 2014"

Despite reviewing a bottle ""past it's prime," this beer ages exceptionally well and suits a sub-zero winter just as much as a cool autumn. Along with Uinta and Anchorage, The Bruery stands to be one of my top three breweries in 2013. Regardless of style, I encourage you all to give The Bruery serious consideration...it is worth it! 4.75","threeviews","Jan 24, 2014"

The appearance is like that of the brilliant maple leaf as it falls from the limb to the ground. Aromas of boozy autumn flavors fill the air and warms my palate as it flows throughout.

This reminds me of something made by Southern Tier- good, but definitely a little over the top on the sweet end. Pours a slightly murky amber with little head. Sweet with yams and brown sugar, and moderately spiced with winter spices. Balanced, if a bit sweet. There is also a fairly nice bready finish that is a bit like an uniced cinnamon roll- yeasty,bready, a bit spicy, but not that sweet. All in all, a pleasant experience, especially after the beer opens up for a while. It seems to get less sweet and certainly less carbonated- and breadier.","Georgiabeer","Dec 29, 2013"

The beer itself is a clear brown that has a dark copper hue to it. However, seen in the right light, the beer also has bits of red. The beer has a strong maple smell with hints of hops complementing the maple and spices that make their appearance. In addition to the maple, the beer has hints of a banana smell that is probably the yeast and brown sugar, both of which complement the maple. The taste is fairly different from the smell. While the maple does play a central role among the various taste, the hops seem to come out more as an aftertaste. The spices are more distinct than smell. The various spices vary from cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. Overall, the beer has a sugary and nutty flavor with a heavier emphasis on spices than other brown ales. Notes of yam are also present. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation. The beer has a smooth feel but with some texture as it is drunk. Overall, the beer is pretty good and worth getting when available.","HattedClassic","Dec 05, 2013"

So this is that and somehow better. It takes a moment, but it strikes you that the flavor and mouthfeel of this ambitious T-day beer is rightly balanced.

Certainly a sweet edge due to the syrup, where maple flavor doesn't come to the forefront quite like the overall seeetness of its sugar. Not complex, although more sipping gives me more of an apple note. A mild burn briefly pops through afterward, then levels off. A sipper. Wish it were better carbonated. Seems perfect to accompany a holiday meal, so as intended, this will be had with Thanksgiving dinner. A different type of beer, and despite not favoring this style, appreciated. Update following meal: score on this brew bumped up by nearly a full point, just because it compliments this type of meal (incl turkey, cranberry sauce, broccoli, hot rolls etc.) perfectly.","TBoneJones","Nov 28, 2013"

4.3,14.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Very classy looking beer, burgundy in color, off white/tan head doesn't last too long. Smell is oak, pumpkin spices, brown sugar, green tea, not much maple. The maple comes out a tiny bit more in the taste but is still disappointingly subtle. The yam I think has a cleaner less punchy flavor than pumpkin which in my opinion is a good thing. Pumpkin can be very pungent depending on the species and ripeness and I've definitely enjoyed a minority of the many pumpkin beers that I've tried; sufficed to say I'm not the greatest pumpkin beer fan. Mouth feel is good, decent amount of carbonation, medium bodied, a little bit of alcohol spice on the finish. The alcohol is actually very well hidden in this beer. Overall I think if you're going to call out the main ingredient in a beer then it should be front and center, the maple is too subtle. But that's about my only serious complaint. The yam works amazingly well as a pumpkin replacement. The flavor is extremely well balanced, the pumpkin spices are not overpowering. A perfect beer to enjoy on a cold evening cozied up in front of a roaring fire.","Kevin73","Oct 13, 2013"

4.1,8.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/25/2013. Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, pear, apple, raisin, dark bread, toast, yam, cinnamon, clove, allspice, maple syrup, pepper, nutmeg, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, pear, raisin, apple, molasses, toast, cinnamon, yam, nutmeg, clove, allspice, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Lingering notes of dark fruit, apple, molasses, cinnamon, toast, yam, nutmeg, clove, allspice, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent spiced Belgian strong ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt, yam, spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

Nevertheless, lots going on - spice, malt, sweet caramel starch, fleeting pepper, a wink at hops. Flavor is like nose, tang is up front followed very closely with the malt, starch, caramel, spices and an array of lovely, interesting complexities. Body/carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, true, of good length, and only at the very end do I get the alcohol smack down. I like it!","drpimento","Sep 28, 2013"

Upon further sips, the flavors unravel a bit as the big, ripe, fruity esters of the Belgian yeast strain play nicely with the maple syrup. The sweet potatoes not only lend their flavor, but make the brew chewy, a little chalky. Thankfully, there are ample scrubbing bubbles because it's a lot to take down - even with the carbonation there's plenty of sticky residue between swallows. The booze pops in mid-sip to break things up a bit, but man, the molasses really sticks around throughout the sip. I'd definitely tone down the molasses next batch. Finishes long and sweet.","rand","Apr 15, 2013"

On initial taste, the beer is overpowering. I suggest letting the beer breath for at least a few minutes. Again, earthy and sweet, not a regular flavor for beer.

Smells very belgiany, with spices and a blend of the other elements supposedly used in the brewing process: yams, molasses, and maple syrup. Taste is similar, but with some dark fruit added. Mouthfeel is sharp, crisp, and somewhat refreshing with a buttery/pastry aftertaste. It's definitely rich. Overall, not a huge fan of this beer and I suppose I hyped it up myself because I was so interested in the maple aspect. I would be interested in trying this with some age on it.

The taste is pleasant but relatively one dimensional. spicy belgian yeast, some powdery fruit and not much maple or yam, which is what got me excited about this.

Maybe if the yeast hadn't taken over, i'd be able to find more layers to this beer, but after splitting the bottle into two servings, and racking my brain both times, my review remains the same. On the other hand, without the belgian yeast, maybe this brew falls in line with everything else, leaving it boring and passed over. I have never tried a beer that taste so different then it smells. If i were blind folded and asked to name the style of the brew by smell, i would say pumpkin ale, if asked the same question by taste, i would say a farmhouse/saison.

In the '09, every flavor blends to create a very intriguing fall brew. And of course, the alcohol is completely subdued. That's the issue with the other vintages. Too much burn from the alcohol as well as less-developed flavors. Especially the '12. Way too much booze. But, overall, the spices, yams, molasses, and Belgian yeast all play a part unique to each year. Nothing spectacular, though. Just a well-crafted, enjoyable seasonal brew.","Gatch","Oct 11, 2012"

I can appreciate that, since I certainly don't need any more pumpkin beers in my life. So whereas using different ingredients is cool, it seems to me like the yams just thicken up the beer as opposed to giving it any broad character that will be more than minutely noticed. If one wanted to be negative, one could say it clogs the beer. But it isn't so much a bad thing. Just making a note of it. So overall here, we get a thick dark Belgian ale that is quite hearty. Which makes for a good fall beer and an excellent alternative to all those stupid pumpkin beers.","RblWthACoz","May 08, 2012"

Aroma dominated by yam, with spices, almost cola-like and faint sweet malt. Interesting flavor of caramel, maple and sweet yam; cinnamon and nutmeg. Finish of caramel malt ending somewhat dry with some tannic elements. Body is medium, somewhat creamy. Somehow this works nicely, this is a tasty autumn ale. Could have been cloying, but the slightly dry finish balances the flavors nicely, althouth the tannins were a bit of an off flavor.

I've found a lot of their beers to be interesting enough to keep the beer enthusiasts at the table happy, but still accessible enough for non-craft beer guests to enjoy. The booze in Autumn Maple can be a bit much, but if you pair it with rich foods the booze can become an asset and you might be surprised to find even novice beer drinkers asking for seconds at the table. Think steak with cream peppercorn sauce, cassoulet, ect.","vfgccp","Dec 26, 2011"

The 10% alcohol is present throughout, and becomes even more pronounced as it warms. The tartness dies down but I started to pick up an almost chalky flavor—the dry finish didn’t work with the alcoholic booziness that became ever more present. Yams and the malty-smokey-molassas notes become more pronounced as it opens up. It took its time to grow on me, but it didn’t excite or thrill me as I had expected (and hoped it would). To be honest I felt it was a bit of a let down. We’ll see how the second bottle is after another year or so of rest.","elNopalero","Dec 17, 2011"

I will not be picking this one up again.","tigg924","Oct 27, 2011"

I didn’t get the subtleties I was hoping for due to this element. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation a little low.","thekevlarkid","Oct 13, 2011"

3.8,0.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall, this is a tasty beer. It really drinks more as a belgian brown (which is its base) than a spiced vegetable beer. I would have liked more maple and yam flavor, but this is a tasty brew that does an excellent job of masking the 10% ABV.","jgreenearrow","Oct 05, 2011"

3.06,-18.8,4,3,3,3,3,"O- Ehhh don't think this is all my style. I was hoping for a lot more maple syrup, but the yams are a tad too much. Not so much a bad beer, but not a good one. I could see the variations being better perhaps, but I'll never her my hands on them.","haazer","Sep 30, 2011"

No light escapes to the other side of the glass. Nose is really great for the style. Yams, nutmeg, cinnamon, maple syrup are the primary players in the smell. This beer is aptly named- it's not a pumpkin ale, but it smells like fall to me. Really well put together, and not overpowering. Unfortunately, the taste doesn't live up to the nose's promise. It's not as well put together, and tastes jump out at you and then disappear. It almost suffers from an identity crisis for me... None of the 10.5% ABV is noticeable at all. Mouthfeel is medium, w/ a light sugary aftertaste. OK, but I'd like it to have some more substance and character. A little too one dimensional. Overall, this is an interesting brew, but it's just not put together quite right. Still, I'm glad I had a chance to try it. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Sep 30, 2011"

The aroma is really strong on this one. This began with a strong aroma of Belgian yeast and burnt caramel, with hints of allspice and molasses. Oh yeah.... and YAMS. The first sip was quite spicy, with a sweet backend, almost tasted like teriyaki sauce. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice all dominate the flavor up front, but burnt caramel and sweet yams to end It. There is also a very noticeable spice from the alcohol content. Mouthfeel on this is kind of syrupy, while displaying a great amount of carbonation. Just like someone mentioned earlier, kind of a medicinal feel to it. I think this is a great, and creative interpretation on this style of beer.

The taste brings sweetness from the maple along with a chewy richness along with an earthy vegetal quality from the yams. Also it has a very strong belgian yeast taste that I didn't really think worked to well with the other flavors. Abv was slightly noticeable and I didnt find it too drinkable.

The smell is a lot like a kriek and very sour smelling, the alcohol is very prevalent on the nose with a light hint of sweet potatos and spice. The taste is very strong of maple brown sugar, sweet potato, nutmeg and other spices. Alcohol is very upfront as well. The mouth feel is sticky with a medicinal burn throughout, a very similar mouthfeel to nyquil.

You could damn near let this sit out and use it as potpourri. It's easy to take in the hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, vanilla, and so many other subtly nuanced spices. The taste is very unique. You definitely get the yams. However, it has a very strong clove presence...the same way every beer on earth that's brewed with Belgian yeast has that trademark taste/smell to it. This had a nice mouthfeel to it. Nothing about it was long lasting or lingering except a bit of the clove again. Over all, this was nice.

The nose absolutely reeks of cloying yams, maple sap, and pumpkin pie spicing....I am shocked to report that this is the first time I have ever experienced a desire for a de-amplification of the nose in my entire beer-tasting experience. Its a great combo of smells which work together well, but the levels are set so high as to be annoying. Tastes like maple syrup at first, but evolves into MEGA sweet potato pie with a boozey alcohol burn to it. Not exactly my cup of tea, but I can see how it would appeal to others. It just....crams *way* too much yam flavor and scent into my head, when I'm only a lukewarm fan of yams and sweet potatoes.

You can pick up the Belgian yeast more in the nose than the flavour but that is because of the veritable cluster...party...of spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, lots of brown sugar and molasses. It might be me but I didn't pick up too much of the maple, and I know everything about maple syrup, maple leaves, maple trees, etc... This was an easy enough beer to drink, not too hard, slight alcohol burning. I am pretty sure if you drank more than one though, you'd turn into a drunk turkey.

This smells like a sweet potato covered in butter, sprinkled with cinnamon fresh out of the oven. I don't even like sweet potatoes but wow, this is perfect for autumn. I wish I would've opened this on Thanksgiving. This tastes like sweet potato pie, and that's the perfect description. It is a little sweet but it's to be expected for what the rest of the beer represents. It drinks smoothly and looks like a Belgian dark and is full bodied. This beer is very drinkable but the sweetness can be a little much. I'm not a fan of yams so I'm glad I split this bottle three ways. It's a good beer and different to say the least. I'm glad I tried it. This beer should definitely be split between friends as more than a third would be a little much.","aasher","Jan 28, 2011"
3.82,1.3,3,3.5,4,4,4,"I'm rating this in comparison to the other fall/pumpkin beers since the yams are really a replacement for that gourd. Based on that standard, I think this beer does quite well. It's not overly spiced and you can actually taste the yams (whereas many pumpkin beers are designed to mimic pumpkin pie rather than actual pumpkin). Not my favorite style or my favorite example of the style, but it is evocative of the season and is worth a try when the leaves change. A worthy experiment from a forward thinking brewery.","chicagobeerriot","Jan 28, 2011"

I was instructed to take care pouring this one out to leave the yeast in the bottle, but my best try was a failure I guess. Alcohol is hidden well. One glass was fine enough for me.

Lots of sediment towards the end made the beer very harsh and yeasty. Fair overall... I don't mind some trub in my beer, but the high yeast sediment here killed it towards the last quarter of the bottle, making it almost impossible to finish even with careful pouring, and the maple taste was stale and almost not worth mentioning.

Light to moderate lacing on the glass after a quick fade. There is some stickiness apparent in the liquid. A deep rich nose full of sweet malts and Belgian yeast. The yams add a thick layer of decadence to the dark breads and malt. Banana is enhanced by them. Dark fruits are sitting on top of them. This is so pleasing to my nose I could smell it for days and still want more. A bit of earth balances the thick sweet breadiness, a light touch of alcohol adds a flourish. Taste is in line with the nose. Dark fruits and large slices of sweet brown bread in the front. Some notes of maple syrup. Earthy mellow hops to balance and bitter the finish. Complex spiciness that makes you wonder if it is spice or the basics. The usual holiday bouquet is here but is so well integrated you just enjoy it without focusing on it. Feel is supple with a light syrup consistency. Moderate carbonation is spot on and just a bit short of creamy when fresh poured. After a bit of time however the bubbles take on a gentle personality and add just enough movement to keep the beer from getting heavy. A nice experience overall on balance. Drinkability is surprising for a BSDA. This went down like a lager almost and with good food a real winner. A great beer for the holiday table as well as anytime Belgian dark urgings. Really good stuff here.","scootny","Nov 28, 2010"

I don't really know what the yams are supposed to add, imagine it adds to the sweetness. Medium mouthfeel, light for the style, light on effervescence, a bit sticky.

A really nice earth that seems to sit in the wood of the cask and the dirt sweet blends well with the nutmeg. This is an american beer. More so an imperial vegatable beer than anything belgian. A tad boozy but it could be much worse. Not overly sweet but has a lack luster feel as it lacks density in both yeast protein and malt.","rtepiak","Oct 08, 2010"
4.14,9.8,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"D: Here's the thing, most fall seasonal veg beers sell it way too much on the spice. You end up with a flat pumpkin pie sort of taste, heavy on all the pumpkin pie trimmings, light on the pumpkin (Pumpking, Dogfish Head Punkin being the 2 most notable exceptions to my memory). The Bruary here decided to go for the throat of fall food. Earthy, thick, starchy, sweet veggies. And they nailed it. There is just enough spice to season the yam properly, but the focus is on the flavors of the yam itself, not the spice. Very, Very nice.","codewarrior","Oct 08, 2010"

It pours a hazy dark garnet topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose, as many in the room said, elicits memories of Thanksgiving dinners past: candied yams, sweet potatoes, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, candi sugar, and Belgian yeast. Only the last couple (especially the yeast) were absent from my past November meals. The taste isn't as delectable, but still holds notes of maple syrup, orange zest, ginger, banana, clove, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel apple. This ain't as much of a meal, but still sits nicely in the tummy. The body is a light-ish medium, with a moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel.

In addition the finer notes seem to me to be orange zest and grapefruit (probably from the hop aroma). The taste is of Thanksgiving. There's sweet potatoes, brown sugar, and citrus zest. There is a distinct syrupy boozy taste to it as well which some may claim can go with Thanksgiving as well.

Head retention is decent, but not much lacing at all. Aroma is molasses, yams, and sweet spices. It tastes mostly like spices, candied yams, and some molasses along with a little bit of maple. I do think this brew is spiced too much for my liking as the spices seem to overpower the other flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it certainly goes down good enough. I think it's a solid beer, but I also thought I would like this one a lot more than I did.

The taste follows through with similar notes, but also with an accompanying sweetness from the molasses. Belgian yeast notes are apparent as well.

Its body is light with cola-like carbonation. An intensely sweet brew, but aside from that, there's not a ton going on here.

The palate opens with a rich sweetness with brown sugar, vanilla and maple syrup with a definite molasses component. The spices really dominate the mid-palate and the finish, big and prominent. The yams aren't particularly noticeable Drying on the finish with a touch of alcohol, this medium-bodied beer is quite perfectly carbonated, it's soft and smooth on the palate.

Ok, so not a huge improvement in the smell, I'm getting a sweet Belgian aroma, some spice, both yeasty and added, perhaps some hints of orange. I'm not picking up a whole lot of malt character, which isn't awesome for a brownish beer.

The spices are nice and mellow, but there. The bitterness is good and strong with an interesting cinnamon bite. I'm not really sure what the yams bring to the table.

Fairly clean though, light bodied, right at the end of the spectrum of acceptable carbonation. Alcohol is not real apparent. I'm going to really struggle finishing the whole bottle. Sweet with sour and the Belgian yeast really just doesn't do it for me. Definetely one to share with others.

It's nice, a little too sweet smelling for me, not enough beer, but nice. The taste is pretty good too. Very similar to the smell, but it's a lot harder to distinguish everything. It's just a rush of sweet candy flavors A(though the beer itself isn't sweet and syrupy) with a mildly spicy finish. I'm interested but not impressed. The alcohol is a little too strong for me. It's not very heavy for a 10.50% beer, which is surprising. The carbonation bites on the finish. Not bad, but not a whole lot of fun. And for the strength, I'm surprised that it's so easy to drink.

To start with there are the weizen flavors of sweet malts and some light banana, but on top of that is a gourd-like quality which must be from the yams. Maple syrup is there but I wouldn't know it unless I expected it, and to finish it all off there's a hot alcoholic burn.

Aroma is fairly mild, a little disappointing that it isn't stronger given the ingredients in this beer. Very earthy, vegetable-like and Belgian-y aroma, with mild sweetness (the maple I suppose but I can't actually identify that specifically), some peppery and cinnamon spices. Doesn't really open up much more as it warms up sadly. Flavor isn't that much different than what I imagine an Unibroue pumpkin beer might taste like. Well, you can tell the difference between the yams used instead of pumpkins, but as for what the spice and maple contribute there isn't anything that unique. Full bodied, syrup like, with high carbonation (seems like issues from last year's batch didn't carry over in that regard). Taste starts off like a dark Belgian ale, before the spices come in, cinnamon, light clove, etc. Finish has both an earthy, vegetable taste (the yams) and a slight sweetness (the maple), but neither is overpowering and are nicely balanced. Alcohol has a warming presence, but never burns or is found in the flavor. Overall, a very nice balance of flavors, and a nice alternative to the glut of pumpkin beers on the market this time of year, but slightly disappointed that if you're not paying close attention as you drink it's just another dark Belgian.","yourefragile","Oct 08, 2009"

The aroma is of nice spicy belgian yeast; banana and clove, brown sugar, and figs. The maple aroma comes through as the brew warms. The taste is vinous, a plum fruitiness, an earthy spice tone, light lemon tartness. The molasses and maple syrup add the sweetness to the brew but are fairly subtle and blend with what I imagine is the yam. Not much yam flavor but I pick it up towards the end. The feel is moderate to thick, perhaps a touch syrupy and sticky; light carbonation and quite noticable abv. An interesting brew, needs to tone down the booze so that the other flavors come through.

This beer is difficult to review because there is so much happening here. Thanksgiving in a bottle really, the light maple syrup note works well with the sweetness and mild spiciness of the brew, the alcohol content is detectable but it cuts right through the flavor in a way that enhances the experience rather than hurt it, this beer is hot in a good way.

The sweetness from the yams and maple is evident but the spices, mostly cinnamon and clove is what I am picking up, is just a tad too powerful. A full-bodied beer that is thick, sticky, and smooth and finishes slightly dry due to a minor citric hop bite on the backend; could also be a very minor ABV burn.

Heading is slow to fade, and does not leave residue on the sides of the glass. Spicy nose full of cinnamon and clove, along with some nutmeg, and light pumpkin spice. Funny that none of the ingredients mentioned on the label I can pick up in the smell. Taste is a different story, as the brown sugar and maple syrup really show up. The yams I wish I could taste, but I think the fact that I have never had yams may have something to do with it. I also get a slight hint of juicy fruit in the taste, which may be a result of the higher alcohol content. Speaking of the alcohol, it really works with this beer in that it can be felt and tasted, but it complements many of the flavors. All of the spices really give your palate a full slide show of tastes. As far as drinkability goes, I will need to get another bottle or two while they are still around, as this might be the perfect beer for this season. Next time I pop one of these, I will make sure I am in the middle of some real Boston Fall weather, so that the experience is all the more appropriate.

3.36,-10.9,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"I like that the spice character is quite subtle, it is hard to guess what is spice and what is fermentation derived here, which is exactly how I prefer it. The beer itself is not too bad, it definitely really needs the texture and vitality that carbonation would bring to it. I definitely am looking forward to getting the next, carbonated batch of this.","Gueuzedude","Dec 11, 2008"
4.04,7.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A very interesting beer! My first sip made me ""Wow!"" with all the flavors to take in. You can definitely taste the yams and it's fairly spiced but very drinkable. Cinnamon, ginger and allspice (i think) jump out at me. The color is light amber and the head was well formed. I hear the bottles have a carbonation problem, but it works well on cask because you don't expect much. It tastes like what a autumn amber should taste like. I wouldn't drink it every day, but I would gladly grab a bottle next autumn to enjoy.","antilogic","Dec 08, 2008"
3.5,-7.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My first Yam ale. Very nice balance, with a lot of flavor. Notes of yam, candied pecan, cinnamon, ginger and all spice. Very simple nose, with sweet malt. Autumn colored ale, with a long lasting head. Interesting, well balanced flavor. Sweet, strong. Pretty nice.","Crosling","Nov 30, 2008"
3.04,-19.4,3,4,4,1,1,"I saved my only bottle of this for thanksgiving. Poured dark brown with absolutely no carbonation. Smells and tastes very nice. Perfect thanksgiving flavors - yams, spices, maple syrup. Really creative idea. Unfortunately the near total absence of carbonation makes this practically undrinkable. It's like a syrupy yam juice. Very disappointing to spend $15 on this, especially since I seem to recall reading that the brewer has acknowledged the carbonation problem. The price should be drastically cut. Couldn't even finish a glass of this, so we used the remainder in our turkey gravy - a task for which this beer is much better suited. The gravy turned out great. Highly recommend using this beer for cooking.","waltonc","Nov 29, 2008"
3.43,-9,4,3.5,4.5,1.5,2,"I hope if they brew this again that they adjust the carbonation of this beer. If they do I would highly recommend this one.","tendermorsel","Nov 27, 2008"
2.08,-44.8,2,4,1.5,1,1.5,"Overall, this beer was memorable, but for the wrong reasons. I applaud the Bruery for their creativity, but in my (admittedly) novice opinion, the Autumn Maple just doesn't work. If they can get the carbonation worked out, I would be curious to try a small glass on tap next year, but I will not be buying another bottle. Ever. I am looking forward to the Bruery (hopefully) redeeming itself in the bottle of Saison Rue that I will be opening shortly.","yeastsipper","Nov 26, 2008"
2.98,-21,2,4,3.5,2,1.5,"I was very excited to try this beer since it was brewed with yams, spices, and maple. However, I was very disappointed when the it poured with no head whatsoever. Little to no carbonation. Great aroma and flavors going on, but it tasted like a beer right after fermentation - flat and sweet. The beer is bottle conditioned so maybe I got one that just didn't carbonate. Gave it a 1.5 on drinkability because my friends and I had to dump it down the drain. Sad.","Bardeen","Nov 25, 2008"
3.82,1.3,3.5,4,4,2.5,4,"D: Overall, this beer lacks a feel and carbonation, which kind of spoils it. There is 10% ABV in this beer, but it is so tasty that I cannot detect the slightest bit of it. Kind of tastes like a pumpkin brew you left open and out all night that somehow retained all its flavor but not its carbonation. Its still very drinkable, just half as enjoyable as it would be with some body.","kasper","Nov 24, 2008"
3.87,2.7,3.5,4,4,3,4,"I knew about the carbonation issue prior to purchasing this 750 ml bottle. I pulled the trigger anyway because the thought of a yam-based Belgian brown ale with a 'pumpkin ale' palette of spices sounded too good to pass up. If The Bruery fixes things with the next batch, look out.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 23, 2008"
3.9,3.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"One last note--I'm not sure why this is classified as a pumpkin beer when the label states that there is no pumpkin used in the brewing.","likestoswallow","Nov 16, 2008"
3.97,5.3,3.5,4,4,3,4.5,"a very drinkable fall brew, for a 10% plus brew.","getkrunkhoe","Nov 16, 2008"
4.15,10.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"On tap at the brewery during AHA rally. It's thanksgiving in a glass. Orange amber color with a creamy tan head. Aroma is spices like pumpkin pie meets candied yams. Taste is rich, full malt, some sweetness, and yes you can taste the yams! Some alcohol. Full bodied and smooth for a beer that strong.","Brewsmith","Nov 15, 2008"
3.77,0,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I think the beer may have been a little cool and that I had some unfair expectations of what this beer was and should taste like. It was a good beer just not what I expected.","WeeObese","Nov 13, 2008"
3.9,3.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"On tap toronado SD, would love to try a bottle after a year in storage. As the toronado staff noted, this would be awesome with thanksgiving meal. A bit sweet, some spice but with great texture. Really interesting nose and sweet and lingering finish. Like a thanksgiving meal wrapped up into a brew. Very enjoyable. I don't have a lot of experience with this style brew.","paytoplay","Nov 10, 2008"
3.77,0,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, I am looking forward to getting this one again next year, as this years batch has suffered far too greatly from lack of carbonation. It just felt lifeless and dull, which is a shame as this may have been a remarkable brew otherwise.","mikesgroove","Nov 09, 2008"
4.79,27.1,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Awesome beer, awesome brewery. Like whats going on there and look forward to many future offerings.","goodspeed94","Nov 09, 2008"
3.22,-14.6,3,3.5,3.5,2,3,"**I just found some tasting notes on this that appear to be about a year old! In any event, repeated bottles demonstrated that the lack of carbonation was an endemic problem. Even on-tap, only mild carbonation, but really flat out of bottle. Will update review/scores.","Overlord","Nov 06, 2008"
3.45,-8.5,1.5,4,3.5,4,3,"It does feel nice in the mouthfeel department. Full bodied an syrupy with very little carbonation. This beer packs a bunch at 10.5% ABV. It's a very interesting brew that's big on yams but I can recommend to try, but in the end, it's not my cup of tea...and I'm a big pumpkin/spice ale fan","Brewlore","Nov 01, 2008"
4.42,17.2,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"The head went away quickly on my sample, the color being a dark russet orange. The aroma is maple syrup at first, then as the beer warms the assorted spices (clove, nutmeg) and yams really come out. If you try this, allow this to warm up to let the overall flavor shine. Yams, yams, and more yams here with assorted spices. (Dark) Fruity Belgian yeast is very noticable. The alcohol can't be found, the carbonation is at a perfect level, it has a full body...I like the feel. Sip and enjoy with a Thanksgiving dinner, or in my case a bratwurst and German potato salad.","DoubleJ","Oct 18, 2008"
4.45,18,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"D: A beer that drinks as if it had much lower alcohol, but it still contains some heaviness making it more of a sipper. Best of the style I have ever had, I can't wait 'til it comes out in bottles, I know what I'm drinking this Halloween.","Halcyondays","Sep 21, 2008"
4.45,18,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Easily the best ""pumpkin"" ale of the handful I've ever had, though it has it's own unique take with the yams, Belgian yeast, and any other secrets in it. I don't think I'm the biggest fan of the taste of pumpkin ales traditionally, so it says a lot for this one to score so high for me.","MiScusi","Sep 20, 2008"
