It's  not like other fruit beers, where you think you're just drinking cider; there's enough of an aftertaste that reminds you that it's beer to know it isn't cider, and it's not overpowering with one fruit.

3.5,6.1,,,,,,"Although they're certainly not the first to do so, you've got to give Magic Hat at least a little bit of credit for originality in producing "Elder Betty", an elderberry weiss. The berry flavor comes through quite clearly, and adds an interesting secondary flavor that comes out in the lingering finish. The base beer is well-made, although basic, but that's clearly so as not to interfere with the berry flavor; and along those lines the bitterness is kept in check, and there are no hop flavors to speak of. It's interesting and refreshing, although I'm not sure you'd really want to have two of these in a row.","NeroFiddled","Aug 20, 2014"

I don't typically like fruit beers and didn't think I would like this one because Elder Berry is usually too tart for me. It was the perfect amount of tartness to make this beer taste like an ale with a cider-like touch to it.

Taste was crisp and fruity, but not sweet or syrupy. Very refreshing with a nice mouthfeel and pleasant aftertaste. Definitely a refreshing summer brew. I will definitely try this a few more times this summer.","wsmith1625","Jun 27, 2014"

Elder Betty has an ABV of 5.5%. The smell is rich with spices and some grains and fruit. The taste is great smooth and rich with spices and berries. Elder Betty goes down smooth with no bad aftertaste. There is nothing bad to say about this brew. This brew starts off smooth with a clean finish. I like how this brew has more flavor than most brews on the market. This brew was more than what I was expecting. I would buy this Elder Betty again I'm giving this brew a 4.50 out of 5.","nicholas2121","Jun 08, 2014"

This is probably the most crisp wheat style of beer, be it hefewiezen, witbier, or what have you, that I've ever consumed in recent memory! I highly recommend this for a thirst quencher for the dog days of summer. Especially here in humid-ass Ohio hahaha.

Smell is of malt, grain, and some slightly sour berry aromas. Taste is much the same with bread and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of mineral-like bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but nothing I would go after again.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 14, 2013"

It actually tastes somewhat bland despite this. I was expecting a fruit beer with a dominant flavor of elderberry. Rather than the focus being on the fruit, there's an odd dry herbal and floral flavor and a flavor of nuts and bread. It's earthy. The mouthfeel is thin, crisp, and dry. It's refreshing. I appreciate the effort to be unique, and it's not bad by any means, but the "magic" just leaves me confused and underwhelmed at the same time.","DeFaz","Aug 03, 2013"

The body is light to medium which is just what you want for a day like today. The taste has some wheat and berries with a low bitterness and clean, crisp ending.

The smell is a nice mix of soft, twangy wheat, a little yeast, some banana and grass, and, finally, a generous fresh-berry scent. The taste has a bit of wheat, a tart dryness, and enough hops for balance. The body is sooth and creamy. It's a decent beer, but it didn't grab me.","Suds","May 19, 2012"

2.95,-10.6,3,3,3,2.5,3,"I'm typically not impressed with much that MH has to offer, and this was really no exception. Poured a hazy orange-yellow with a small white head that receded to a wispy layer of bubbles. Aroma of grains and sweet berries, sugary malts, sweet candy. More of the same in the taste, elderberries (there's a Monty Python joke in there somewhere), sweet bready malts, grains, mildly wheaty and acidic. Definitely more sweet than tart as far as any fruitiness goes. On the lighter end of medium-bodied and a bit stale in the aftertaste. Not too bad overall, but just not my thing.","Rifugium","May 17, 2012"

3.65,10.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Even though Wacko was my intro to craft beer, even I could tell that it needed to be retired. Enter Elder Betty, a wheat ale brewed with Elderberries. And it's good! Far better than Wacko, at the very least. It pours a hazy golden color with a small head. The aroma is very strong on the fruit, with a touch of wheat perceivable. The taste offers a nice, refreshing, slightly tart kick of berries with just the smallest amount of wheat in the back. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for an easy-drinking summer brew. A great summer thirst quencher that blows Wacko out of the park, even with my soft spot for it.","shand","Apr 13, 2012"

Mouthfeel is very nice, dry on the tongue. As it leaves the mouth it leaves a slight berry after taste, nice. Overall this is a good wheat beer that has been infused with the right amount of elder berry flavor. Nicely done. Bring on the summer heat, this beer will sit well on the deck with some fruit salad.","barleyroad","Apr 11, 2012"
2.93,-11.2,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"I just had a world class German hefeweizen, why on earth am I drinking this now? Pours nicely into the same weissbier glass, glowing hazed golden orange hue with a bright white head, much less texture going on than the German counterpart. Fine even lacing formed looks nice, into the aroma: Tart berries, they say elderberry, I wouldn't know that one in particular but some fruity tartness that resembles berries. Think head to head competition with Leinenkugel's "fruity pebbles" beer. A bit cloying in my first sip a strong sense of berry extract comes down the palate, with some lifeless watery notes and hints of grassy/grains colliding with elderberry extract. I will let my wife finish off the rest of these, she enjoyed one straight from the bottle last night. In all of the years in trying Magic Hat beers, I've never seen marketing this bad, the weird looking Elder Betty on the tree doesn't make me want go see jambands perform. "Golden Haze for Summer's Daze" ha-ha-ha (smoker's cough following). Outside of marketing the American yeast used in the beer makes the wheat component pretty lifeless and one dimensional, the yeast is chalky/doughy no spice no esters just effin boring. Mouthfeel I will repeat finishes cloying like I neither need to eat something or brush my teeth to get these flavors off my palate. Carbonation no complaints really, just a huge blunder of a summer beer release. Give me a good German Helles any day, that's not normal anymore in the craft brewing trends. Overall if you have to try do so within the confines of a 12 pack summer sampler when they're released.","WVbeergeek","Apr 06, 2012"
