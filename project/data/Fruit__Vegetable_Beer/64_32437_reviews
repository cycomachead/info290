"Overall:  I like the fruit character that steps up this golden ale.  Will always look for more of this in the future."
""
""
"O: This is a sipping beer – it’s a touch to sweet to drink a lot of. It has a lot of interesting elements but they do not always come together."
""
"Overall: a solid fruit beer but not quite top tier. the fruit/belgian yeast clash just a little bit too much. it could be nice with either more fruit flavor or less phenols. other than that the amount of alcohol is nice but takes away a little to much since the fruits don't fully develop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was not a fan of the blueberry backberry along with belgian yeast.  I thought the fruit flavors were done real well.  I just wish they had put this in a wit."

""
""
"This was a 2012 vintage at the brewpub."
"I was curious to try this combination of black raspberries and blueberries but this just didn't do it for me.  I found it to be too sweet, and although I have had far worse, this is not a beer I would have again."
""
"Is this a beer??? It definitely is a treat for beer drinkers. Medium Sweetness, the fruit comes through like a red wine. Like nothing I've ever drank before. I'd recommend it for a change of pace, or nice splurge buy one afternoon."

"Very fruity, almost cider esque. Strong but not my favorite, won't reach for it again for a while with all the other great dogfish options"
"Felt great. Looked great. Smelled great. Tasted great"

"O: Not a bad brew from Dogfish, if it wasnt for the rasberry and blueberry puree I probably wouldnt like this beer because it taste a lot like white wine and I am not a fan of white wine. Very sweet and fizzy."

"Gotta love it when your local bars get some cool kegs. This case in point pours a partly hazy sunset rusted gold topped by a finger of glowing bone foam. The nose comprises blackberries, light blueberries, very light banana, mild biscuit, light sourdough, and a pinch of allspice. The taste brings in more of the same, the berries matched by some Belgian yeast-infused bread and a hint of orange peel and light grass. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty nice beer, one that I could see going well with plenty of foods (muffins and lamb dishes spring to mind)."
""

"I think I got hyped up for this beer thinking it would be something really great. I love blueberry beers and I love Dogfish, so I thought it would be a great combo. So when I opened the bottle, I didn't think the smell was great, but they don't all smell great so that was whatever. The pour was good and the appearance was a good hardy beer. When it came to tasting I think it was just something that I didn't expect, so I didn't love it. Wasn't bad, but I'm not sure if I'll buy again soon. Mouthfeel was actually nice. Overall I gave it a 3 because it just wasn't for me."

"08/07/13 On tap. Just a taste. Not quite the fruitiness I'd hoped for. All in all a good tasting brew but I was expecting to be gob smacked and that didn't happen. I guess that's what I get for hyping myself up. This is one those that may just fare better from a bottle. Worth a second chance."

"Yeasty flavors upfront, phenolic and footy, hints of fruit come through, would like a bit more. Tough to discern berries, seems mostly blueberry emerging. Spicy bite in the finish. Yeast dominates too much for me, which detracts from the ex-berry-ence."
""
""
""
"Found in a discount bin of bombers at local store and was delighted to find this nice fruit beer! pours a beautiful reddish-peachy color with thin pinkish head. the blackberries come in heavy on smell with tinges of that sourish belgian yeast. nice strong flavor of the golden ale base plays under those real berries and extra notes of dates, licorice, granny smith apple on the back. as other reviews note, all the layers mask some of the booziness nicely!"

"Overall, this was good, not great. I'm glad I tried it, and it was an intersting change of pace. Maybe some age would help, as other reviews seem to suggest. Did not live up to my expectations, but it wasn't bad either. If you're looking for a big fruit beer with natural flavors and some wine-like qualities this should be right up your alley."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - More like wine than beer at this stage. This is aging really well, and I'm willing to bet I wouldn't like this beer freshly bottled nearly as much as I do now. I'm sure it would be a solid beer, but I can see it being super sweet, jammy and heavy on the fresh fruits used. This is becoming darker in color and richer in malts, sugars and fruits. Very, very tasty and complex."

"Fruity fruity fruity! Not that you should have expected anything less from a beer proclaiming to be made from blackberries and blueberries. Pours an interesting redish amber with a clingy thin white head. Smell is a lot of fermented funk, sour citrus, mild malt, and hints of blueberry. Taste is yeast, but opposite of the smell, i get mostly blackberry on the palate. Mildly sweet, a touch of sour. Leaves you with some fresh fruit on the aftertaste. Feel is great: easy, almost TOO easy to drink. You would swear this is more like 4 or 5%, certainly not 10. Nice boozey warmth once it gets down in the gullet. The alcohol can sneak up because it's so easy to drink. I downed a bomber inside of 30 minutes and definitely felt it shortly after. Good beer, preferred Red & White (if they can really be compared)."

"This is more like fruit juice with beer in it than beer with fruit in it. Still, that's probably what was intended, so it's hard to knock a beer for being what it is. Glad I tried it but I'm in no hurry to have it again."
"unfairly underappreciated. this is a great beer, well made and fun. it looks pinkish and foamy, with a nice richness and good bubbling. smells like a Belgian blond, but has some great germal elements. malty with a fruity element, the blueberries stronger than the black berries in smell and taste, almost tart. the malt meshes amazingly well with the berries, a cool combo and definitely something different. yeasty, but the carbonation is huge, and so is the body, better and better as it warms up. love the fruit here, like no other. and the alcohol content is entirely invisible. how in gods name is this thing over 10% abv? just feels like a session beer. overall a great mix of fruit flavor and taste, nose of baby feet a little, but a real high quality brew here."

"this is a 2012 bottle, so it's last year's batch.. i have to say there's not much of a difference in the year this has been cellared."
""
"Overall-Not bad. Definitely need the subtlety that this beer provides to be able to drink the fruit stuff. The Dogfish people don't typically let me down though."
"If you like fruit beers, then you will love this. It's one of the most ""natural"" tasting fruit beers I've had, no corn syrup sweetness here. Personally, I enjoy the occasional sweet fruit beer so I enjoy this one. However, if you don't like those types of beers, there is obviously no reason for you to waste your time here."

"My friend brought me a bottle of this stuff - and I wish I'd have known to age it. Seems like the only positive reviews come from vintage bottles - mine was certainly not a vintage. Assuming the fruit mellows out, I can imagine this being a nice beer... I strongly suggest letting it sit if you want a more enjoyable experience."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2012A. Pours moderately cloudy orange copper color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tart raspberry, blueberry, grape, raisin, clove, light molasses, red wine, and earthy yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with a good balance of yeast esters with the big authentic fruit notes; with a nice malt/spicy ester balance as well. Taste of tart raspberry, blueberry, grape, raisin, clove, light molasses, bread, red wine, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fair amount of fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, dark fruits, clove, light molasses, bread, red wine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of fruit flavors; with a good balance of malt/yeast spiciness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a slick and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial Belgian fruit beer. Nice complexity of fruit flavors and balance of spicy yeast esters; and very smooth to sip on for a 10% brew. A very enjoyable offering."

"I'm really impressed with what this is. This one blows away barriers as to what to expect of craft beer. I know this has been out there for some time and I'm pretty sure I've tried it before as I've had most DFH offerings being in Philly. Not sure if the age has anything to do with it, but I really am enjoying this. Wow! A great beer."
"Overall: This is one big ass fruit beer, and it's a good one. Dangerously drinkable and not as sweet as you would expect a 10% DFH fruit beer to be. I'm looking forward to trying a bottle of the 2013 batch when it's released."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and berry aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors."

"Poured this Fruit Beer from a bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a blueish/purplish color, produced a thick white head, retention was average and lacing was minimal. The aroma of this ale consisted of malted barley and sour fruit juice. This is a full bodied beer, 10% ABV. - Thankfully, I had the St. Charles Whisker Biscuit to assist me with this. A sweet malted grainy cereal base that gives way to tart fruits (blueberry and black raspberry) - it is actually a nice balance between sweet and tart- The issue I have with many fruit beers is that they are all sweet from start to finish- This ale does a great job to balancing the sweetness from the malted grain with the tartness of the berries. Another note here is how easy to drink this is- This is a big beer but very easy to drink. Don't be ashamed to grab this fruit beer and share this with a friend."

"I am not a fan of fruit flavored beer except for hints of the flavors, and this beer is like a fruit flavored wall of Marshall amps cranked up to 11. Dogfish Head makes some wonderful beers, they're one of my favorite brewers, but this is aggressive and obnoxious. The smell is nice -- mixed berries, I especially smell raspberry, but the taste is borderline unbearable. Tastes almost closer to a wine cooler than a beer it's so sweet and fruity. So unpleasant I poured about $7 worth of its 13 dollar bottle down the drain."

"Overall, this is too boozy to be enjoyed over long periods of time. With a ABV turned down a few notches, this would be a very solid beer, but the smell and flavor profiles tend to take over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is slightly purple from golden - to be expected. Good lacing on the glass but head disappated quickly. Smell is more blackberry heavy than blueberry. Taste is consistent with the smell. Slightly boozy taste but the ABV tips that off. Great for a nightcap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Dogfish did a nice job with this one...I didn't find the alcohol presence, but I'm sure an entire bomber would do me in...great berry flavors with a small supporting cast in the background"
""
"O- If the goal was for a berry-based sparkling cider-like beer, they nailed it. This tastes nothing like a traditional beer, but is good for what it is."
"Edit: I feel like I didn't do this beer justice in the review or the score, so I adjusted the score accordingly. Like many people on B.A., I'm not the biggest veggie/fruit beer fan and sometimes my reviews will reflect that bias (sidenote, dudes, please stop saying that fruit beers are ""girly."" I'm a woman and it makes me feel really unwelcome in the craft beer enthusiast community when gender is used as a benchmark for how good or bad beer is). This beer accomplished exactly what it is meant for. It's a good seasonal beer and you can tell they used real berries instead of fake flavoring. Would I rather have a robust porter or an IPA? Sure. But if I were looking for a fruit beer with some actual complexity, this is a really excellent one."
"I like a good fruit beer and this one fits the bell for me. More wine tasting than beer tasting, but a good sipper."
""
""
"O: If this was about 5% less abv and was crisp and dry, I would drink this beer regularly. As it is now, this is a big, boozy, fruit influenced golden ale that is worth checking out, but not my favorite drinking beer."
""
"Beer is thick and sweet, strong with a lot of cherry flavors. Very strong, very in my face. It is a little harsh but finishes fine, lingering fruitiness. Very sweet."
""
""
"Nice bold fruit beer-- not sugary, not too dry or sour, gets the flavor well."

"This beer pours an amber/ruby red with a white head that carries a hint of purple within it, and is very thick and frothing with happy bubbles, which dissipates slowly, leaving a nice half-finger head and also light and sliding lacing that droops in lovely cloud patterns down the glass. The beer smells sweet and yeasty, with nice hints of the malts and stronger hints of sweet berries. I also detect a slight hint of wet dog, which is a little upsetting to the beer… that may just be the sour berries doing funky things with the wet smell of the beer, but it is a little strange to smell. Malts seem sweet and light, and a hop character is not even there as the berry bite takes its place. The beer tastes very sour with a metallic/citrus tinge in the back of the taste which comes partially from the booziness of the beer, but that doesn’t entirely explain the metal. The beer is almost wine-like with light berry accentuations, which means this is definitely a sipper, not a chugger. My initial thought is that I should have had this in a wine glass and not in the pint mug I used. There is also some syrupy flavor after the taste has washed over your mouth, and the bitter of the raspberry definitely lingers in the mouth. It is very harsh on the tip of the tongue with carbonation. It leaves the mouth very dry and desert-like the farther it goes on the tongue, but the very middle and tip seems to be cloying with a thick and sticky syrup feel. It also leaves more of a wine’s sweet fruity lingering in the mouth than a beer’s crispness. Overall I am not very impressed with this beer, especially for its $13 price tag. It has a nice sour taste, but there are also some stranger things in the taste, especially the metallic/citrus anomaly. The fruit just doesn't do nicely with this beer. I either want more fruit flavor, or less and more beer; but where they stand is not really working for me. I also don’t get much of the blueberry in the taste, which is disappointing. I suppose the raspberry is just too strong of a flavor, but I would have loved to have sensed some of the blueberry. The beer is a meh, and definitely not a recommended from me. Honestly, I just want more berry flavor from this and it just doesn’t deliver."

"O- A very nice beer. Not sure they hit it out of the park, especially for the cost ... but one you should try."
"O - Comes off like a tamed version of Fort. Lots of berry flavors, somewhat of an earthy and medicinal finish, way too much alcohol. Like most big DFH beers, I think this is meant to be aged to calm down a bit. I hate to make this comparison as I love DFH, but berry flavored malternative beverage..."
"The best fruit beer I have had so far; full body, great flavors and has lots of kick to it. Never been the biggest fans of these type of brews, but this one is great. Great fruit brew here, another stud from DFH."
""
""
""
"O: The beer is a little sweet for my palate but it hides the alcohol very well. This is more of a sipping beer than an easy drinker or a sessionable beer."

""

"Revisit: I don't like this anymore very much. Found the bottle to be too sweet and boozy and a chore to drink. Not awful but just not very appealing. These qualities would work better in a big stout but this one just gets too hot and syrupy after a few sips."

"I poured this beer from a 750ml bottle into a pint glass. It has a nice rich auburn color body with just a small white head that leaves a nice lace down the glass. The smell has a nice berry aroma to it. The taste is a little tart to start then the berries come in on the middle of the tongue and gives it a nice like sweet flavor. I get like a white wine finish on the back of the tongue. Very nice mouth feel, very little after taste. Overall this is very different and i really like this beer."
""
""
"2012 Bottling. Pours a clear, pinkish amber color with a large white head that takes some time to go down. Scent is very berry-forward...quite inviting actually. Smells like fresh raspberries and blackberries with a hint of tartness. Lovely aroma. Taste is initially just a bit tart, but quickly turns to alcohol flavor. There is some definite booziness to this (nowhere near Fort, but noticeable booziness). Belgian yeast flavors with some spice and dark malt. You still get some pleasant raspberry and blackberry...not really picking up the blueberry. Finish is warming and sweet. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. Although it drinks fairly light, the puree and booziness makes it feel much more heavy. Drinkability is fair. Overall, I was very skeptical going into this because I tried Fort not to long ago and hated it. This one could definitely use without the intense alcohol flavor, but it is an enjoyable beer. The nose especially."
""
""
"Overall – Not really what I am looking for when I am looking for a beer. It is a good wine alternative if that is what you are looking for; sorta a white wine-beer hybrid."

"Overall, a really nice unique but slightly sweet fruit beer. I was expecting something insane from Dogfish Head based on the other reviews, but you pretty much get what you read on the label, which is really nice. Might be more of a desert beer than anything you would want to drink with a meal."
""
"O-The beer borderlines on artificial at times, there isn't much need for 10%abv."

"Gorgeous bright red with a slightly pink head. Subtle nose of berries. Champagne like effervescence. Big full mouth feel. Bright berry. Some medicinal syrup like burn on be back end. Sweet cherries, blueberries. Strawberries. Clove and coriander remind you its a Belgian pale ale. Peppery spiciness. Flavors all blend together really nice. Tart finish. Pretty subtle for such a big berry beer. Nice. Nothing spectacular though. Not worth the price tag."
""
""
""
"A big boo-boo for Dogfish Head Brewing. A beer that's completely unnecessary. 10% witbiers are not for me. Kudos if you can finish a whole 750ml of this stuff. 2.5"
"overall- definately a great beer, and unlike many dogfish specialties i will definately consider buying it again"

"At first, I was significantly unimpressed by this Black and Blue from Dogfish. After a few sips in, I'm coming around a bit. It's pretty drinkable, relatively light in body, and probably pretty mass-appealing. I'm still not in love with the Black and Blue, but it is growing on my slowly."

"Nice berry aroma, could even smell it when it was being poured. 10% ABV, but you really don't get the alcohol taste or burn. Seems like it could be a sessionable beer, but the abv might creep up on you. Strong yeasty flavor from Belgian yeast on back end. Overall, another good beer from a great brewery.... would try it again next year."

"O - Decent fruit beer. Not quite up to New Glarus standards but glad I got to split this bottle with a friend. Nothing stands out too much."

"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This is late in the season to be having a fruit beer, but I found a 2010 bottle at a local beer store and had to have it! It tastes just like it smells which is great since it smells wonderful! Of course I am having it in from the 750mL bottle in a snifter. to be 10% it sure is hidden well, but most of that probably comes from age. if you like fruit beers this has to be a target of yours, it is a wonderful treat!"
"This looks about standard for a big fruit beer, a golden red color with a tiny head. Aroma is about what I'd expect from a 10% alcohol brew brewed with tons of blueberries and blackberries. Taste? Berries and booze. with a bit of malt. What else would you expect? Mouthfeel is on the thicker side of medium, with prickly carbonation. Drinkability is very good. Overall, a great ""extreme"" fruit beer, there's a ton of fruit in this high alcohol beer."
"This beer poured poured out as a purplish red color with a foamy pink/white head on top. The head settles and doesn't leave much lacing at all. The smell of the beer is fruity, yeasty and has a little funk to it. The taste of the beer is a lot like wine in my opinion. I think the berries used in it give off an interesting flavor once fermented in this brew. The mouthfeel is semi-thick like most of the DfH big bottles are. Overall this beer is decent, I can't say that I've wanted or needed to have it since the first and only time I drank it. If I was at a party and someone had it I would totally drink it again."
"Overall-- this beer is too boozy, not flavorful enough, and in need of more carbonation. lots could be improved on--- but if this were my homebrew I would be eager to play with it. I certainly wouldn't stop here, I'd reconfigure the recipe and try to make something spectacular. I do harbor a slight concern that the base beer is the wrong platform off of which to build this recipe, but perhaps more fruit, and a bit more sweet malt action could save it."
"Overall this is a really enjoyable drink. I'm not usually very big on sweeter beers like this, but this had just enough balance to not be cloying, even after a whole bottle. I would say that this would be an excellent dessert beer shared after a nice family dinner where everybody could sip on it. It is pretty delicious."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, very chewy, with a creamy finish. Difficult to drink more than a small glass - too sweet and thick. Very weird for the style."
"At 10% this beer is scary drinkable. This is one of the best fruit beers I have ever had. I'll definitely pay the price tag for this again."
"Overall, a really nice unique fruit beer. It reminds me of a light bodied mead. I was expecting something insane from DFH, but you pretty much get what you read on the label, which is nice. Just unexpected from my point of view."
"Being a fan of Dogfish and their try anything attitude I wouldn't advise against trying it, just not my cup of beer."
"(138th)"
"Feel is a strong medium and the carb is a bit lighter than the Red and White counterpart. I was burping up Jolly ranchers long after I finished this so the artificial flavor stays a bit. A bit of alcohol to but not hot. I did not enjoy this so much. To fake tasting and everytime I taste candy in my beer, it's a huge turn off."
"Had 3 bottles of this along with 3 bottles of Red & White on a fishing trip to the Finger Lakes. Must say, I liked the Red & White better. At any rate, this is a fine fruit beer. The fruit is very pronounced in both nose and mouthfeel. Very sweet in my opinion. This would be a fine after dinner/dessert beer. The 10% is hardly noticeable. This one could sneak up on you quickly. Not so sure I'll revisit this in the future, but I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor is very nice. Overall, I thought this was a very nice fruit beer. It has just the right amount of sweetness to perfectly balanced out the fruit. Definitely worth a try. I would buy this again."
"O- A really nice fruit forward brew! Love the berry/carbonation POP!!! For what it's supposed to be and do... I'd say it's very good for the style it represents! Pair this with a fresh berry/spinach/blue cheese salad, A cheese and fruit plate, or blueberry jam glazed grilled chicken w/ coconut couscous!"
"Dogfish Head Black & Blue is a clear, solid golden ale topped with a dense sand colored head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a super fruity aroma of fresh black raspberries and blueberries. It's a little sweet, a little floral and there's a whiff of light grain. It's medium bodied and lively. The finish is pretty clean and a little astringent. It's a little sweet and fairly bitter. There's a little sourness. It tastes more like fruit wine than fresh fruit. The black raspberry is pretty prominent at the start of the taste. It gets progressively more bitter as the finish approaches. It's mostly juniper and alcohol by the finish. Berries linger in the aftertaste. It has qualities of an old ale, a mead, a melomel and a sahti. It's very unique! It tastes a little boozy, so I wouldn't say this is for chugging, but it's enjoyable, unique and pretty classy."
"O - I can dig this brew. Its kinda like a blueberry barleywine. Not sure if a few more years would have made it all mellow out but if that ABV can tone down a bit this would be a really nice beer."
"D: I wouldn't say this is a great beer, but for what they are trying to do here, they really nailed it. This is a fruit beer and everything about it screams fruity, berry goodness. If you're looking for a fruity, interesting beer, give this one a try."
"The mouthfeel on this beer is wonderful and the fruit overpowers the alcohol enough so that you really can't taste it. The nose on it is very enticing. This is another great beer brewed by DFH."
"D: Would,d be a great desert beer or you could... nah this is nice anytime. On another note it made em crave Cheerios which I eat with blue, black or raspberries."
"Overall- I do love fruit beers. Its a preferred style of mine. Knowing that though I havent tried a hole lot of them. But that being said this is one of my favorites so far. Everything seemed to work well. I cant wait to find more."
"D: This was a very nice beer with good balance of sweet and tart. It could maybe be a bit more bold, but the alcohol was very well hidden so it was dangerously easy to drink. Great beer for any season, and could be really fun with food pairing. I enjoyed this better than Red & White."
"Overall. Nice berry flavours with great body and nice level of sweetness for what's going on in this one. Just a little boozy, but it's forgivable ;-)"
"O- This is a good beer, and one I think a lot of wine drinkers might enjoy. I wouldn't call it complex by any means, and the Belgian golden base didn't really show up for me, but I think this is a pretty good example of what a fruit beer can be."
"O - Hmm, this beer is very different in a good way. This beer lives up to the name, and what it's supposed to be."
"GOOD, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"O: I did not like this beer."
"Pours a clean and clear coppery gold color, small cap of white head, lingers and leaves a touch of lacing. Scent is dominated by the promised notes of blueberry and blackberry, faint notes of alcohol follow with a moderate amount of grahmn cracker sweetness. Taste again is fruit forward, especially at serving temp. Blueberry is at the front with a light tartness, blackberry and faint hints of concentrated grape juice. Slightly cloying by time the 10oz is over. A grahmn crackery sweetness seems to intensify as the drink warms, a little spice comes out as well. Alcohol is quite noticeable. Medium bodied, carbonation is moderate, lightly dry. Overall i prefered this to the bottle, the fruit stood out more, even though the beer felt more one dimensional."
"O. Didn't know what to expect going into this, DFH is phenomenal, but blueberry beer? But it works, it tastes good, and it's definitely refreshing. Good stuff!"
"It's actually not half bad. The alcohol is a little high which gives off some wine like characteristics and makes it a little tough to punch through a bomber. Still miles ahead of Blackberry Witbier by Sam Adams, though. Pretty decent, albeit one-sided."
"Overall- I really like this beer, I like fruit beers in general and this is one of the better ones I have had, especially ringing in at 10%. Slap a New Glarus label on this and I bet it would rate out to an “A-” average at least. Cheers Dogfish, nice job on this one!"
"Black & Blue is just an okay release from Dogfish Head. It’s not a complete disaster, but a couple of tweaks would help – primarily less berry flavor and less alcohol flavor/warmth. If you’re into berry flavored beverages, you just might like it. Irrespective of your taste, it is worth a try...at least once."
"O- a bit of a surprise. I didn't expect the sweetness without the alcohol bite. Very smooth well balanced beer"
"I like subtle flavors and heavy on the anything tends to make me miss the point. This beer did that. However, I think paired with the right food it could be delicious but on its own this wasn't for me."
"D - A unique blend of styles that challenges the senses... The nose is more fruit than Belgian... The palette is more Belgian than fruit... Enjoyable all the way around... The only complaint is that this on is ever so slightly cloying..."
"Overall, a pretty nice effort for a fruit beer. The berry aroma and taste is well presented. Nice beer for a warm spring night."
"O-i had this a very long time ago, and in my memory it was a miss of a beer. maybe my taste buds have matured, but wow i'm loving this. i wish it weren't so expensive because i could buy a case of this and drink it. this bottle might not be for sharing because it goes down so easily, especially considering the ABV. this is extremely good and definitely quaffable."
"This is how a fruit beer should be, soft flavors with amazing bouquet of dark fruit, but the alcohol backbone to round it out into a fine, fine beer. Dogfish just knows how to do these different beers correctly, love just about everything from them. This is in my top 5 of favorite beers!"
"O-overall I think this is a great fruit beer. I don't think I could drink this everyday, but it would be nice to have on a mild summer night with some vanilla ice cream on the side."
"This is certainly not my favorite beer style, but I think that this beer is very greatly crafted and is exactly what it is supposed to be. A fruit beer!"
"Draft to snifter. Beer looks good. Not that I'm sure what it should look like, but it had the depth representative of black and blue berries, so it's gotta be labeled ""good"" at minimum. The bouquet was also good; the fruit was well-represented. Taste was excellent. The flavors poured through nicely. Mouthfeel was good; definitely a sipper. Overall, a good beer that I'll definitely be ordering again."
"D/O: Pretty much nothing but fruit throughout this one, which is ideal. Nothing fancy, just a nice mix of berries and beer. Yum"
"O - Plenty of fruit in the nose and mouth. The starchy, buttery flavors add a different dimension here."
"O – The nose is fantastic, and the beer opens with a great berry flavor, but the medicinal backend sandbags this brew from really getting off the ground."
"Drinkability is high. There's a good amount of booze in this one, but its very enjoyable and goes down easy. Not hard to kill the 750mL alone, but at 10%abv, you need to be careful."
"I had this in a 750mL bottle, and kept it in my fridge for just a little too long I think. Still good. Kind of tasted like a sweet tripel. Poured semi-cloudy, orange-brown with a nice white head. Fresh fruit on the nose. I got hit with the alcohol in the taste right away, which made the blueberry a bit harsh and acidic. Followed up by bright malty sweetness with some light sugars reminiscent of a Belgian tripel, and a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel and a bit harsh, but I could tell it was because I let it sit in the fridge too long, so I can't really blame the beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy orangish pink color like a late day sunnyset. There is a two finger soapy white head whiches recedes to skim and leaves some lacing on the sides. Very nice long very inviting. The aroma is of sweet blueberries and blackberries with a hint of graininess. The smell is very inviting. Not a complex smell but a very good smell. The taste follows the nose exactly. A big blueberry and blackberry taste with a hint of malt to balance out the flavors. Sweet and smooth taste very good, very nice. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation and is slightly dry, kinda wine like. Overall it is a very good beer, nice taste for a fruit beer, upper ratings there, but the smell is very nice. This is a beer I would seek out again and again."
"O: Fruity and enjoyable. 4"
"O) A well crafted brew. The fruit flavors are quite authentic and not sugary imposters. I will finish this bottle myself and if I had more I'd probably drink it."
"O: A very interesting fruit beer. Nothing I could drink 3 or 4 of, but a nice sipping beer."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, some nice blueberry notes that are at times overwhelmed by too many medicinal notes. The blackberry also really never comes through. Not a bad beer by any stretch, just not really worth getting more than once in my opinion."
"	Overall, I choose Red & White. I think Black & Blue lacks a uniqueness to separate itself from other blueberry-flavored beers. I could probably get a six-pack of another blueberry beer for the same price as I paid for this bottled pint and get a very similar taste. That being said, I have had some blueberry-flavored wheats that are artificially flavored and taste nothing like blueberries. This beer is not that hopeless."
"Had a sample last night at the brewpub in Rehoboth. I'm normally not a fan of fruit beers but had to try this one. WOW. Belgian Strong with blackberries and blueberries. Berries very noticeable in the aroma/flavor, but I don't know if I didn't know what they were that I would have been able to tell. Very well balanced between maltiness and fruit flavor. Don't think I could drink a full pint, but this is a perfectly executed fruit beer."
"Overall a great beer for the style. However, at $10 a bottle only a few can afford to drink much of this one."
"Received a bottle of this one as a gift from my wife for some holiday or other. Poured a reddish-orange color with a slightly off-white head. Somewhat tart on the nose, with aromas of dark berries, alcohol and candi sugar. Medium bodied and tart, with flavors of dark berries, candi sugar and booze."
"Eh. This is a beer that is not sure what it wants to be. Pours an attractive reddish color, impressive head with some decent lacing. Not as much berry scent on the nose as one would expect. It is there but its not strong. Tastes of fermented raspberries, not much hops or too much of anything else. Mouthfeel is ok, not syrupy like I expected. Ok beer, nothing I would go out and buy again."
"If I saw this again where I usually frequent, I would buy it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"But not this time. I'd rather drink a macro lager than this. Really. Huge thumbs down."
"For the price I wont buy up the store but if I see another bottle, I am most likely going to snag it."
"D: This ale is drinkable, but would prefer more tartness from the berries if at all possible."
"(D)- Crisp and refreshing. Great fruit profile, yet sort of straightforward. Still enjoyable and tasty. Definitely a good fruit beer"
"D: This is always a repeat beer for me, i find it perfect for sipping while sitting around a nice big campfire."
"This definitely isn't your ordinary beer.. but the flavors alone make this very worthy. These are the kind of beers I expect from DFH. Well done, recommended!"
"Overall I thought it was very easy to drink and I enjoyed every aspect of the brew. I will definitely be buying this again."
"D - Drank the 750ml by myself so I would say its very drinkable."
"D- Very drinkable. Fruity but well balanced. Not overly sweet. Delicious."
"Carbonated moderately with a dry overall feel. There is a bit of alcohol warmness in the end."
"Overall impression: Pleasant enough, but rather forgettable."
"Easily had a couple glasses of this. A must share with dinner or after."
"Overall a solid fruit beer form Dogfish Head."
"D- wow, you can slam this. Dfh making another drinkable brew for the ladies!... And me"
"Overall I enjoyed it and appreciated the genuine fruit taste as opposed to fruit flavorings. It's a nice sipper, but I still like the Belgian lambics a lot better."
"I drank almost the entire 750ml myself, so yeah, it's pretty drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a bit above average. Drinkability was good, it was a pretty good fruit centered beer with some good and fresh berry flavors. It had a fruit juice like quality to it that was pretty good. Overall a pretty decent beer, and a very good beer of the style."
"As mentioned before, this brew drinks more like a wine then a beer, but I find it goes down quite well. I have had this beer a few times before and always thought it was better with food. I think this is one of DFH's more successful tangents."
"Pours a moderate reddish brown color with a light head and not too much lacing, but a decent amount of retention. Both the nose and the taste are pretty much consumed by the berry additions, although there is a bit of booze in there as well. Drinks fairly well at the moment, though I'm guessing this would get much better as it mellows out a bit with some age."
"D - You gotta give it to DFH for continuously pushing the envelope on what beer can be. That being said, this is a great one to try and could be a great replacement to the bottle of wine for a dinner party, but all in all not something that I would ever pick up in a 6'er if it were available."
"D: Drink it like wine."
"Cheers."
"Easy driner despite the ABV. NOT HOT AT ALL. Other reviews cite hotness. I did not experience that."
"Overall this was fun to try, as it always is with the folks from Dogfish Head. Drinkability is moderate though, at 10% and being bottle in the stadard big beer pint as per DFH specialty brews."
"2.5 D: Definitely not one of DFH's best. The only thing good about this is the appearance, but in the scheme of things important, that doesn't mean much. Boring smell, boring taste, boring mouthfeel. Thus, not very drinkable and worse if you factor in price."
"The color is an amber/deep red. It has a thin cream colored head. The smell is strong pundget and fruity, sweet and tangy. At first sip it is malty, sweet and smooth. You can taste the tangy-ness, bitterness, and sweetness that black raspverries and blueberries pack in the back end of the beer, you can almost taste the 'skin' of the fruit. This beer isn't as sweet as you would expect like most fruit beers. Overall, pretty good."
"D: Kind of tasty compared to most fruit beers, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's certainly one of the better fruit beers that I've had."
"Overall good, but there are better fruit beers at a better price."
"Pours a clear, deep amber with white head. The head dissipates to small beading over several sips. The aroma is of blackberry jam, ripe blueberries, and a spiciness from the Belgian yeast. The taste is sweet and fruity, but not cloying. A little bit of caramel malt, and just enough hops to balance. The alcohol is present, but it's not super boozey for 10%. The carbonation is medium to low, and very fine. Overall, a nicely brewed, strong fruit beer."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, with a nice bit of tartness, but lacks the complexity I would have expected"
"full-bodied, chewy mouth-feel with medium-low carbonation. with this type of flavor profile, personally i'm not going to have a lot of it, but i would be more than open to a revisit at some future point."
"Overall impression: interesting flavor. definitely worth trying again but i can't have it on a regular basis. don't drink too cold---you'll miss the unique character."
"Drinkability: The combination of the high abv's, the dirty iced tea look, the sweet berry smell, and the gross sour flavor on the tastebuds make this a difficult beer to have too much of. Wish I had a taste of this before I bought a whole 22oz. bottle."
"The labels states ingredients include black rasberry and blueberry puree but the taste is more like a near flat peach lambic with a strong alcohol. Not quite sure what kind of meal I would pair this with - maybe some nice old world cheeses. Share the 25oz bottle with friends - one glass is enough per person."
"Pretty decent overall, definitely more interesting than a stock golden ale or fruit beer, but the payoff isn't quite all there."
"This beer was not what I was expecting and could be a real winner."
"M & D: I could drink this like juice (and am!). Get a bit of carbonation on sip and it is amazing. The scent and aftertaste make this easy to drink. First bottle I sipped. Second bottle I am drinking like a bum with his Thunderbird. I can't get enough of this!"
"Slightly overpriced and harder to find that most Dogfish Head brews. ABV is also kinda much but if non of the above are problems for you, seek it out."
"Drinkability is okay. Sometimes it's too rich like molasses and other times it seems just right. Can't drink very many of these. The drinkability is somewhat confusing to the personality of this beer because the body is so substantial and filling it makes you think winter, but the taste is so sweetly delicate (although robust as well) that it makes you think summer. Summer to me is typically a more drinkable beer."
"I am willing to bet, as Sam Calagione (Founder and President of Dogfish Head) often mentions, that this beer will be best in two years. The fruit should come to the forefront a touch as the yeast dries the beer out crating what I expect to be a more tart and spicier drink. Right now though it is easy to enjoy on its own or with almost any sort of cheese, pasta, pizza, fried fish or cheesecake. MMMmm, try it with cheesecake!"
"Bottle. Pours a definite blue/purple tinged color with a slight purple head. Fruit smell along with a slight belgian yeast. The taste is a touch more alcoholic than I was expecting but it is fairly smooth nonetheless. Belgian ale taste with a nice fruit finish. Light/medium mouthfeel. As a fruit beer I just wish it had a stronger fruit profile."
"D: As was with the Red & White, the 10% ABV makes the drinkability low for me. Also, while I love black raspberries, the taste with the alcohol was a little overpowering."
"Poured a bottle dated December of 2009. It poured a light amber with good reddish tint in the light. The head was slight and cream colored. The smell was amazing. It wreaked of raspberries, perhaps blackberries and was both sweet and tart. The taste was very good but doesn't quite hit the mark that the scent does. It makes you crave the berry accents. The mouthfeel is good as well, it's rather light to medium in body for the style. Its very drinkable. It is delicious and completely hides the alcohol. I love this beer and would greatly recommend it. If only it weren't so expensive but aged bottles are definitely worth it."
"From a 750 ml bottle, this beer is a clear amber color. Although spottingly white, the beer has a mostly nonexistent head. Its aroma is fruity, predominantly blueberry, with a touch of other fruit. There is a notable malt scent as well. There's virtually no hop scent. The taste is semi-sweet, with a firm bitterness. Although there's a lot of fruitiness and a touch of yeast, it's a fairly clean beer. Medium body, and quite drinkable. The beer is straightforward and interesting. It's not particularly engaging, however. It's a reasonably good fruit beer. Not much more."
"D - for me i must drink it cold not chilled and thats do to the fact the raspberry flavor comes out more which i did not care for to much"
"One bottle is enough for me; not what I was really hoping for from this brew, and it's another example of DFH falling short on their fruit beers to me."
"D: As one of the beers I've personally hyped to hell in my head, it didn't really live up to it. In the end though I liked it quite a bit, better than Red and White for me, a unique flavour."
"D- As much as I did enjoy this I don't think I'd have another one with age on it. I will definately try it fresh and compare the difference. Very easy beer to drink."
"Note, 30 Dec., 2013: Had a glass of this last night and found myself enjoying it more this time than I had when I reviewed it. The fruits came through nicely and the whole seemed more drinkable that I gave it credit for."
"D - Medium drinkability. I split this bottle with a few friends and was perfectly happy with my portion. Definitely gets more cloying as you drink, but an interesting and unique brew nonetheless."
"D - This beer is very approachable and drinkable. It has nice fresh fruit aroma and flavor but has enough complexity and beer notes to avoid seeming like fruit juice or a wine cooler."
"Overall a surprisingly good fruit beer. I expected a sweet, syrupy mess, but it wasn't like that at all. Drinkability is above average."
"Overall, this is an interesting brew. Not one that is excessively drinkable, but one that would be good to split with friends with some vanilla ice cream."
"25.6 oz bottle poured into a large DFH snifter. It is a light red color, translucent with a fizzy inch or so of head. Smell is very acidic with a wine-like berry presence. Blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries are all very prevalent in the smell. Taste is a sour/tart blend of berries, with an emphasis on blackberries and raspberries. Mouthfeel is very acidic and fizzy. Alcohol is present but hidden fairly well."
"I'm not the biggest fan of the mingling of fruit and beer but I very much enjoyed this."
"D: I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed Black & Blue. It is very palatable, not something for constant imbibement, of course, but it has it's time and place. Would be a good beer for wine heads."
"First review so forgive some inexperience. A nice beer for late in the night and drinking alone. Wouldn't pair very well with food, but does well alone."
"This is an enjoyable beer and one that I'd get again, unlike DFH's Red & White. The alcohol is not masked, but that might be intentional in order to balance the fruitiness."
"M/D: It is a little thick, but in a good way, not in a heavy stout way. It has good carbonation and I put down a good bit of the 750ml bottle. It is great to split among a couple of people where you each get a glass or so."
"mouthfeel a bit tart"
"Pours a deep amber color with a reddish hue and a fluffy off white head that sticks around for a while. Smells of sweet berries, candy sugar, higher alcohols, lightly phenolic. The taste is not really what I expected from the nose. Lacking is much in the way of berry sweetness. I get a bit of tartness mixed with a malty sweetness before I feel the twinge of alcohol descend from my lips down my gullet splashing into my stomach. Tart sticky mouthfeel, medium to thick body, medium level of carbonation. I have mixed feelings about this one. I found the tartness and the flavor tasty, but the alcohol burn was a bit to much for me. Maybe an aged bottle of this would be better? I don't think I liked it well enough to put forth the effort to age though."
"D - Tartness limits this to a shared 750ml bottle, though a strong, maduro cigar helps to balance out the overall flavor of the beer."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden but the high level of fruity flavors makes this beer one to be sipped."
"Flavor: Lots of fruit. Drinks more like a wine. Quite yeasty and following with a lot of ester. I started to drink this while it was still pretty cold out of the fridge, but as it warmed up the fruit really showed itself in the nose and on the tongue. Made it much nicer to drink."
"Clear, bright reddish orange in color. Nice lacing. Berries, berries & more berries on the nose. Black berry does dominate, however. Lambic-style sour in the taste, with mouth-coating consistency. Estery. Nice warming finish."
"D - dangerously drinkable in warm weather. gives no hint of the ABV."
"D- This does not feel like a beer, but it is not bad. If you do get a bottle be ready to split it with someone because half a bottle is all that one person needs in a night."
"D - Well I wanted to try these beers for a reason, to sample extreme beers on the cheap. This accomplished this as this was my second favorite along side of a few others of 6 beers sampled."
"An earlier reviewer mentioned that it might mature to good things if left alone and perhaps that's the case. As it is, this bottle turned me off completely. Especially having had the wonderful DFH/Stone/Victory Saison Du BUFF a couple of hours beforehand."
"D - DFH is a brewery I respect immensely, but I think they can do better than this. I don't dislike it, and would likely drink it again if offered to me, but in terms of flavor it could have been more powerful. Still worthy of a quaff."
"Dogfish Head Black and Blue poured a dark amber color, with a little bit of sediment. There was a medium sized head, that had a purple color to it. It smelt of hops, blueberries, and rasberries, so overall sweet, and bitter. It had a very unquie taste. First it had a typical dogfish head bitternes, then a taste of blueberries and rasberries, and it finished sweet, and smooth. It was easy to drink, and overall a great beer, very unquie and it may not be for everyone, but deffently worth a shot, and I found it very enjoyable."
"pours a sparkling clear amber color. lots of fizzy carbonation, average fluffy -fizzy head followed with good lacing. very berry smell with a taste that follows much the same. has a bit of a light fruity wine flavor to it. very easy to drink, alcohol is not the least bit noticable. thin fizzy feel and very sweet, probably to sweet to drink in bulk but could definitely drink every day. first beer i drank that could quench my thirst. could drink this shit at half-time-F@#$ gatorade pass me a black & blue."
" ~ Overall I'd say this beer is certainly something you should consider trying. I don't recommend you run out today and try to find a bottle. But, if you come accross one and can find it for a reasonable price (less than $11.99 which is what I paid for the 25.6 ounce bottle I purchsed) then I suggest you add it to your cart. At any rate its an interesting beer, the bottle labeling is artistically considerate and its brewed by a fine brewery."
"As much like wine as beer, I'd drink this like a bottle of wine; uncork it, drink it, appreciate it, then have again at a later date."
"Mouthfeel is complementary, dry and well carbonated. Drinkability is great and it goes well with food. I had mine with a ribeye."
"This has very high carbonation, much like a German wheat beer or the like. Feels tingly and alive on the palate. The alcohol content also warms you greatly while being consumed. Truly a pleasure to drink this beer. One bottle may not be enough. Great drinkability for such a heavy hitter."
"Notes: A treat to find this one on tap. Thanks again Mr. P!"
"D: A pretty good beer; as I mentioned, it grew on me bit by bit. Not something I'd buy regularly, however, especially with all the other DFH beers that are so great."
"Drink is ok. I probably wouldn't get this again but it was worth a try."
"D: I'm not the biggest fan of fruit/vegetable beers, but this one is very well made and extremely drinkable."
"This is a very tasty fruit beer that would go great with a gourmet meal. It seemed a little thin on the palate, but otherwise very well done."
"750ml bottle served in a Tank 7 Tulip. Poured a reddish gold with a thin, pink tinged head. Fruity aroma that is slightly tart. Light bodied with lots of carbonation. Lots of fruit, berries obviously, in the flavor. A bit of tart acidity. A bit of alcohol is apparent. This got better as it warmed. Not something I'd go out of my way to buy again though."
"Decent fruit beer. It'd be nice to have every once in a while."
"D- The sweetness makes this a sipper. Its a good beer...but god, I couldn't imagine drinking more than a bomber in an evening. I'd assume it would be really good with some sort of berry pie for dessert"
"Dark amber in color with a slighty purplish brown tint. Aromas of Blueberries, citrus fruits such as grapfruits and lemons, along with some yeasty bread dough smells. The flavor is very interesting starting off with lots of Blueberries with the raspberries not showing up until the very end. Plenty of tart citrus and sour dough flavors show up between all the berry fruits. The beer seems to have lots of fruit in the aroma and flavor but no sweetness to balance out the sour. The carbonation comes off a little light. The alcohol seems more apparent in the beer compared to othe DFH fruit themed beers I have tried. A very interesting beer that I'm glad I tried, but not one I would run out to get again"
"Slainte!"
"D - Glad I tried this one but probably won't be a regular one from me, pretty expensive too. This would be nice on a hot summer day though."
"D: really good for a big beer like this, but I'd expect nothing less from DFH. Sam & co are masters of hiding booze in these big beers."
"Hardly any head at all, even with a somewhat aggressive pour, gone quickly with no lacing to be seen. Murky orange rust color with some brownish orange brick hues too, brightens a touch around the rims. The berry scents come through clearly in the nose, however, these are nowhere near being dominant, grapefruit and tangerine citrus there, raw brown sugar, peat moss, lighter yeasty bread dough, sweeter maltiness more apparent as it warms. Full-bodied, dry, sour and borderline acidic, really gives your palate a nice twist. As in the nose the berry flavors knit into the whole and not clumsily obvious, not a ""dumb"" fruit beer. More herbaceous qualities here, match up nicely with the sour grapefruit and lemon component. Presents sufficient apple, apricot, pear fruit as well as honey and yeast to keep the sourness in check. Carbonation is light but contributes when it has to in order to continue forward progress. Given its genre there's a limit to its inherent complexity, that accounted for, sticks to the script well and can't fault the execution."
"Overall, very drinkable. I'm a little surprised at how much I like it. I thought it would be a ""one and done", but I think I'll get this one again."
"Drinkability is pleasant enough but, among its peers, this 11%er has to have a relative weakness. It's not that it's too strong, it's just that it's so unique and unlike other beers that you wouldn't typically make a long session of it. I mean, it IS a brew with blackberry and blueberry puree. It's another example of why Dogfish Head Brewery is iconic in craft brewing--a trail-blazing fruit beer!"
"What a unique beer to say the least. This Belgium style Golden Ale brewed with black raspberry and blueberry puree is a must try for any serious beer lover. The label art comes from the portrait painter David Larned from Pennsylvania, accompanied by his wife Sarah, they are both huge Dogfish Head fans. This interesting brew pours garnet color with a thin white fizzy head. Aromas of black raspberry and blueberry are the most pronounced along with hints of citrus. The palate is not dominated by the fruit like you would think, it is definitely there but it is different than you expect. The fruit is balanced with a nice amount of malts, a great acidity and fine bubbles that are almost Champagne like. If you are looking for something new and interesting to try, this is it."
"Overall I was a bit disappointed by this beer but knowing DFH's track record (by no means a bad one) I should have expected nothing less than something intense and out of the norm. I won't buy this again but I could see some liking it - worth a shot if you like fruit beers and know what you're getting yourself into."
"I see fairly average ratings from more experienced folks. Maybe my palate is not refined enough, but this seems an exceptional brew."
"D- Dogfish head never disappoints in creating an interesting beer; this is no exception. Definitely worth trying, but probably something I wouldn't go back for too often."
"D: Would definitely have another, which is good, because I bought a bomber."
"A hazy reddish purpleish blueish color with little head and no lacing. All I can really smell is berries. The taste is of sweet berries and a little brown sugar, and a slight bit of alcohol. I was surprised for barley being able to taste the alcohol since this is a 10% brew. The mouthfeel is good and its a drinkable beer. I made some girls who hate beer and only drink wine try it and they thought it was pretty good, as do I. Defnitely a solid beer from Dogfish head."
"It pours a slightly reddish purplish color with a sizeable amount of head that disappears quickly. The smell has sweetness to it; there is a natural smell of berries. there is also a bit of an alcohol smell present. The taste tastes strongly of berries, the sweet/ tartness of the berries are balanced with a slight brown sugar like flavor. The alcohol I smell is not present in the taste. The balance of sweetness and tartness is nicely done in this beer. Overall a nice berry beer that's worth trying at least once."
"As far as fruit beers go, it's just about equal parts fruit and beer- as opposed to others which tend to be pretty obvious which way that they lean (think Floris apple versus Elysian Pumpkin). Definitely an interesting effort from DFH, though not one I'd really get again. Fortunately for the sake of variety my wife digs it, so I'm sure I'll be back to review it again next year."
"Drinkability -3.5/5.0 - Very good, but not one you have all the time - fun for special occasions"
"D: this reminds me of a iambic, this beer carried a high price tag for what i got, i would say its worth trying but not drinking all the time, and i probably would not buy again, I made a black and tan out of the last glass which was off the charts."
"- Overall not impressed. I like many fruit beers, but this one is off the mark in flavor... very medicinal and funky."
"with a slow pour this produced no head with light white bubbles around the edge. Slow carbonation with a nice cloudy ice tea color. Stuffed my nose into the glass and smells of light malt filled my nose. First sip produced a nice and smooth malt taste, couldn't find the berries I was waiting for so I let it sit for awhile to let it come to tempature, after that I picked up nice berrie taste to go with the malt. It left my mouth a little dry, but not to much that I thougt I should get water. Being 10-11% abv this was going down smooth, will really try to pick up another one of these and try to make it to dfh to try it on tap. Another great selection from the brewers at dfh, applause, applause"
"This beer definitely should not have sat for this long. It is not terrible for sure, it is just very muted as far as smell and taste go. I am actually surprised that it is as good as it is for a 3 year old fruit beer. I will be on the lookout for a fresh bottle sometime, and will give this one a new review when I do."
"D: Very sweet. Halfway through my first glass and I know I couldn't have more than a pint. Could be refreshing on a summer day though."
"Drinkability: Another big time winner from Dogfish Head. One of the best fruit beers out there, very nicely balanced and the first time I've liked a beer with blueberry flavorings. Excellent all around, seek it out for sure!"
"Overall Impressions: Drinks like a crisp, dry(ish) champagne. Aroma suggested a bit more punch than what flavor was. Really came close to what I expected from the label description."
"Surprised by how much I liked this beer. Made me rethink Dogfish Head. The dark color with fruit tends to throw me off, but this beer was quite exceptional. Highly recommended"
"750 ml 2007 aged 1 year. Dark amber light brown pour. Fruitier berry aroma and on the palate. I was told this wouldn't last a year, but it did so with greatness. The hop profile mellowed out and the flavors stayed strong. No sourness or cloying. Thinking about aging another one but with so many coming out I have even better choices. Another winner from DFH."
"I'm sipping on my second glass of this fine beer as I write this review. Let me just say, this beer is excellent. The pour was amazing, it just shines with beautiful color and the aroma is incredible. I'll be honest, after I finish this glass, I shall pour another and maybe another. The drinkability is out of this world. I love this beer. Another awesome job from Dogfish."
"Notes: One of the least inspiring offerings from DFH for my liking. Both beer and design try to have a pretended seriousness with a tongue in cheek tone, but in the end like the portrait revival on the label it feels a bit blah. They can and typically do better, not a bad brew by any means but there is little really memorable here."
"A touch salty and spicy, this beer drinks remarkably well as it warms. Blueberry and raspberry carry throughout, while the malt plays heavy on the sweet card. Despite the fruity character, the beer is not overly acidic or dry and has a strong alcohol body. Pretty well-balanced with uneven carbonation (a lot up front, disappears shortly after)."
"Very carbonated up front with some slight sour acidic tartness with a sweet medium body that is dominated by dark berry fruit and a slightly spicy finish. The alcohol is very well masked making this beer pretty quaffable. The sweetness of the blackberries and blueberries is no cloying or artificial which is always a plus but is still a bit too much for my liking. An interesting experiment but not something I would seek out again, especially at the high price point."
"Overall - a decent brew if you like fruit beers. I personally prefer my fruit beers to be sours. For me there may be a bit too much hops compared to the fruit flavors. There seems to be an imbalance in the overall beer. But if you like fruit beers that are subtle and not too sweet, then you may really like this one."
"Steven and I tried to enjoy it.. thankfully.. it was the last beer of the night.. I am just not digging it.. I know how much this badboy costs... I appreciate the opportunity.. but.... I will damn sure never buy one. Dan... you are a true BA.. and almost certainly my favorite BA.. A good PA brother."
"taste is sweet and tart, thin, berry is definitely in there, sour malt in the back, and spice, end is sour, dry, and a little bitter."
"Taste is mostly malty with a mild berry presence but obviously noticeable, blueberries are usually subdued anyway but the blackberries provide a slight tartness, not overkill on the fruit aspect and dodges the artificially sweet line and walks the natural goodness line instead."
"Those who don't like fruited beer stay away!!"
"D: Pretty drinkable beer, though I think that this would be better of shared amongst friends."
"M-D: This is a beer that I believe would be for a special occasion. If you like wine, I think that this beer could be put in the place of it. When taking a sip, the beer is very smooth. Once the liquid touches the tongue, the flavors just hits you like a ton of bricks."
"Overall I am still not a fan of fruit beers, but this was pretty good."
"CHEERS!!"
"D - Really nice offering from Dogfish Head that is certainly worth picking up & sampling. Share the 750 with a friend and exhalt in your good karma while sipping a very nice & unique beer."
"For a fruit beer I must say as with most dogfishes I never know what to expect but it's usally at worst a bit different but drinkable, at best its something incredible challenging our ideas of what beer is, and this beer was fruity, but at the same time it was beer, much like red and white. The coloring is ruby red and redish orange in spots with a white head. Smell is strong of fruit, like an unpasteurized cider The taste is of wheat with a strong finish of black raspberry and blueberry, as strong as it could be without making it taste unbeerlike. It has moderately bubbly feel not unlike sparkling wine. I think I could drink a few of these i they wern't so pricey"
"If you like the fruit tasting beers this is very drinkable, however, it was too much berry for my taste."
"A body that is smooth and a little light slides over the tongue. The drinkability is good, but maybe after a couple the sweetness might get to you. Overall a decent beer that's worth trying if you see it."
"I agree with one of the previous reviewers. This beer needs more fruit. I think the underlying ale doesn't seem to complex though. But with the sourness/whatever at the end of the sip, I was tempted to give it a 4.5 on taste."
"I like this, although flavor counts most, and there's a little something missing that I can't put my finger on. I want to like it more, as DFH has my eternal respect and support for their many experimental and often stellar experiments. Still worth a try, although the high price tag might point many people toward other ""must try"" beers that won't do as much damage to the finances."
"Drinkability- By itself, not the best ever, especially for the price. There was nothing that set this apart from other fruit beers in my estimation. Would have been really nice with a desert, especially a cheese cake. By itself, it left a little to be desired."
"Drinkability- Well I usually find that a light bodied beer without an excess of sweetness or bitterness in a high alcohol environment, usually isn't the most drinkable brew. This beer follows that trend. The fruit needs jacked up quite a bit for this brew to hit the goodness its price tag promises. If you see this brew for $4.99 a 750mL, pick it up. At regular price I'd avoid."
"D: Not very drinkable for the style, but since DFH is hardly one to fit a style, this is a very drinkable beer even with the amount of alcohol."
"This beer is not my favorite DFH offering by a long shot, but as a fruit beer it was pleasant and tasty. With its lack of malt beery flavors, it reminds me of bit of a framboise lambic."
"drinkability: it was OK. I'm not a big fruit beer person but when I do I want it to actually be a fruit dominated beer."
"750mL bottle split whith rtratzlaff poured into two DFH Signature glasses a crisp dark orange with a decent off-white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is dominated by berries with slight sweet malts poking through. The taste is very tart berry flavor against sweet malts and slight booze. The beer is on the heavy side of medium, but the 11% is fairly well hidden. This is one I'd wanted to try for a while, and, while not as good as its Red & White sibling, it does not disappoint."
"D- Very high, considering the alcohol content. This stuff is a joy to drink. I'm loving DFH 750s more and more."
"Overall a good brew, but nothing to knock your socks off. Drinkable up to a point - its 10% abv will put you on your ass so I'm glad I split the bottle with my girlfriend. She loved this brew!"
"D: Very, very tasty for a higher ABV fruit beer. The berry combination drinks like pinot noir juice added to a well-crafted Belgian pale ale. Excellent on its own but it also went well with baked salmon in a lemon-tomato reduction. Preferred to the Red & White."
"D - This was a very drinkable beer, I like how Dogfish Head incorporated the fruit into the beer, instead of throwing a bunch of fruit into the beer and drowning out that beer quality"
"Drinks very well, there is a bit of a bite, but the syrupy quality makes it smooth."
"This poured amber with a hint of redness out of my 750ml bottle. For me, the raspberries and blueberries dominated the scent. Very nice lambic tartness, but I really didn't get much of a malt note. I actually enjoyed the fact that the taste of alcohol was prevalent in this one. It seemed to balance the taste. I really like the idea of this brew, but I would rather have had the berry mixed with a porter or a stout."
"I maintain it's tough to review fruit beers. This one is just kind of in-keeping with the style in general (with a few exceptions). One consistent, fairly straight-forward sweet flavor (raspberries, in this case) that comes to kick aside the other flavors and aromas in the brew. It's not bad, and I didn't mind drinking a touch of it. However, it's a missed opportunity, as they could have run with some more interesting tart or sour flavors. Overall, alright, but nothing too complex or interesting (which is a total miss for DFH, a brewery that specializes in ""interesting"")."
"Was given a bottle of this last October as a gift. Decided to split 750 ml of this tonight with my better half. Pours a copper color with amber hues with very little head. Raspberries are very prominent in the nose with a hint of the blueberries. Taste is a tart punch in the mouth from the raspberries. As the beer goes on, the taste begins to mellow. It's somewhat refreshing in the Summer months. Good full mouthfeel - plenty of carbonation. Drinkabiliy is average due to the sweet fruit tastes coupled with the ABV."
"A fine choice and probably worth a rebuy. It's definitely an interesting take on a fruit beer, and you won't be able to find anything like it anywhere else."
" for drinking it all afternoon."
"Poured a lovely medium copper colour, slightly cloudy, with a slightly off-white head. This actually poured a little lighter than I was thinking it was going to be. Smell is definitely fruity with the raspberry seeming to be more assertive than the blueberry. Taste is berries with a moderate amount of sourness and some detectable alcohol, but I certainly wouldn't have guessed the abv to be as high as it is. Mouthfeel is also very light considering the style and abv; well carbonated being neither too assertive nor too light. Very drinkable, all things considered. I am pleased with it."
"Aroma is richly fruity and somewhat malty with an undertone of yeast. It pours a clear coppery amber with a fairly thick but not persistent head. Flavor is more like a good apple cider than a beer, and has a decided alcohol bite. There are hints of molasses and raspberry as well. Texture is rather edgy and a little fizzy, and aftertaste is a little tart."
"It's a nice after-dinner beverage, something I moderately enjoyed. Yet, in all, DFH Black and Blue isn't quite my cup o'tea."
"Pours a seethru coppertinted red with two-finger white head that dies quickly and leaves a little bit of sticky lace. While there are some tart berries in the taste, this is mostly a sweet drink. Blackberries, blueberries dominate over some raspberries and possibly some other sweet malts as this is like drinking a lambic. A pretty good drink, but I can only stomach so much of this in one sitting."
" The bloke on the label looks mighty proud of himself, and so am i for getting to review # 750 on the exact day I started this journey 3 years ago exactly."
"D: Interstingly drinkable. Its a sipper - watch the ABV; alcohol presence more prominent as it warms."
"easy to drink for 10% abv like i mentioned before. and the taste is not offensive or overpowering. i could have more than one glass, but not more than one bottle of this joker."
"I got this is in a 1pt 9.6oz bottle, a great bottle to sip on throughout the night. Overall another great Dogfish Head brew!"
"Another exciting big-bottle (1p-9.6oz) find. Dogfish has offered up some nice ales such as the Red & White, a great-taster, so hopes were giddy for this one. I expected something darker; I don't know why, since the label clearly stated a black-raspberry & blueberry fruit ale. Maybe it was the impressive dark bottle. Regardless, the pour was a pinkish-gold brown that settled as with lemon-raspberry fizz and minimal head or lace. A smooth-bodied but bright flavor of sour malt & berries with lemon. The 10% alcohol was non-existent; instead the sour lambic quality prevailed, not too sweet at all. I wished it were more complex, with a better lambic-quality or weisse aspects, as it was fairly simple, although quite nice accompanying my spinach & strawberry salad and bison-burger. I still think I would go for the Red & White next time...hmm...maybe a Red-White-Blue for Independence Day????"
"Pours a rapberry brown color. Thin beige head with a purple tint. Nose has tart ripe berries over peppery alcohol and sweet malts. Taste is crisp and refreshing. Blackberries an raspberries up front followed by a sweet malt profile and a kick of booze. Medium body is well carbonated, but a bit syrupy. Drinks easy for the size. Fruit beer on steroids. I prefer the red and white, but still a decent ale."
"Overall its an interesting beer. Worth a try and some may hate while others really enjoy. For me, one glass is enough. A whole bottle of this 10% beverage will be over-the-top."
"Final Thoughts - Really enjoyed this brew. Excellent for the style, and high abv. I really enjoyed this limited release brew (as the tap stated) without having to go to Dogfish Head's brew pub. Kudos to Dogfish Head."
"D: This would be more of a desert beer for me, or even a nightcap. Couldn't see drinking more than a glass or two here."
"I had this in bottle about a year ago and wasn't overall too impressed, so I decided I needed to try it at the DFH brewpub this weekend on tap to see if I'd feel any differently about it. I didn't too much really.. The appearance is fairly nice with a cloudy, reddish-orange color that looks sort of like grapefruit juice. Aroma is mildly sweet but quite faint. Similar was same as I remember, a bit of berry-like sweetness but it seemed to have more of an acrid, acidic-like fruit sweetness to me, like cranberry or grapefruit more than blue or black berries. There is a bit of the blue in the aftertaste but you really need to look for it. The mouthfeel is very crisp with the carbonation and on the thinner side of moderate heaviness, so its easy to drink in that aspect, but theres a slightly unpleasant aftertaste right after swallowing. Overall, still a bit disappointing, but its definitely not bad and has to be appreciated for being organic, where many breweries might just add blueberry-flavored chemical sweetner to make it taste like blueberries."
"750ml bottle with a bottled on date of 02/12/07. Poured into my Duvel tulip glass. Appears a color akin to the flesh of a ripe red plum with about two fingers of fluffy light ecru foam. A nice lace forms on the inside of my glass with each sip. Overall, a fantastic looking pour. Smells and tastes of sweet mixed berries, blackberry jam, blueberry bagels, a touch of spicy yeast, and a bit metallic in the taste. At over two years in the bottle, the alcohol is virtually non-existent. A notch above medium bodied with just about the perfect level of carbonation for my tastes. This bottle could have went another year or two easily."
"I don't like to pour a snifter of beer, drink it and say, ""wow, I have all that left in the bottle?"" I'm not there with this, but it is a project to put this whole thing down. Not an unenjoyable project but as a judge on Iron Chef once said about Iron Chef Sakai (sic?) and his lobster with masatake (sic?) mushrooms, ""I don't think I'm enjoying this quite as much as the Iron Chef intended me to enjoy this."" It's well-crafted for what it is...by the way, what is it, anyway? It's a moderately enjoyable little piece of confusion...not that I'd know from experience but if you got stoned and instead of listening to the Dead you listened to technohouse all night and you actually enjoyed it a bit, that would be close. Again...confusion."
"A very nice beer that doesn't go overboard on the fruit. A sipper but the alcohol is so well-hidden, you should step back and savor it anyway."
"Overall a tasty and refreshing brew. Carbonation and subtle dryness does a good job of making this refreshing and keeping you coming back for another sip. For 11% ABV, I'll definitely find myself drinking this too quickly. Another unique and fully enjoyable brew from Dogfish."
"Overall this is a nice example of a belgian style fruit beer. It is not as high-octane as Fort, making it more drinkable, and seems to be a bit more harmonious flavor combination than Red & White. Of the 3 fruity beers mentioned in this review, this one gets second place."
"Overall: Absolutely one of the best beers that Dogfish has made. Far better than Red & White and even Fort for that matter."
"Yet another very unique brew from DFH. Each aspect of this brew is executed wonderfully compared to other fruit beers. Expect lots of Belgian and berry flavors but still a drinkable product that is not too sweet."
"Drinkability - It is drinkable. As it comes in a wine bottle, it may actually be more appropriately served from one. Tastes more like a wine than a beer."
"Had this sucker on a disgustingly hot day in June of 2008 at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton DE. Four beers on tap that day for people to sample. First ths sixty, then the ninety. Then the lady brings out a pitcher of this beautiful reddish stuff with a nice head on it. Wow, what is that?!?! Poured into a plastic cup, swigged it down. Wowee! First thought that came to mind: lambic. Very easy drinking beer that tasted like a Lindeman's Framboise, but not disgustingly sweet or filling. This stuff is mind blowing. Should have got a case! Another winner from DFH!"
"Mr. Calagione has yet again crushed the boundries between beer and wine and created a beautifully harmonious brew with qualities of each. Live, vibrant fruity qualities meets wild musty yeasty balance. Who else is doing something this innovative. I must score high for this great brew, can't wait to cook with this one."
"Drinkability - Not something I would try again. Not my kind of beer. At 10% ABV though this beer is a kick to the head."
"Interesting, and certainly worth a try. Nice blend of Belgian yeastyness and tart fruitiness. Plenty of candy sugar sweetness to conceal the high ABV."
"Not a bad fruit beer."
"I'd drink this again, anytime."
"Pours an amber brown-red color. Huge foamy white head, good lacing & lasting. Fruity sweet aroma, some blueberries. Some dark fruit but not too strong, some raisins. Floral sweet aroma, sugary like a belgian. Some malty taste, blueberry or blackberry, fresh. Hides the alcohol pretty well. Light and pretty easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with nice, fairly thin carbonation. It's fairly drinkable but leaves a bready aftertaste."
"I'm a big fan of pretty much everything Sam Calagione does, but I'm not sure I'll go this route again. No regrets on trying it, but not sure I'll be picking up any more bottles of this."
"750 ml. bottle. Poured an medium amber, small head that disappeared quickly. Aroma was almost non exsistent. Couldn't distinguish any blackberry's or blueberry's, nor could my wife. Had a medicinal taste to it. The only positive I could say is that the alcohol was well hidden. I have a bottle that I will cellar and try at a later date, hopefully for a better a review."
"Out of a very sophisticated, wine-like bottle this rather expensive offering was a hazy pink/orange color like a ripe grapefruit. The head was off-white and thin, the retention not very good and the lacing scattered. Odd looking brew... The aroma was semi-sweet, a combination of blueberries that gave it a musty quality, mandarins that gave it a tart note and some sourness and a bit of spices made more zesty by the hints of alcohol. For 11% this was rather subdued. The flavors again struck me as odd. Where were they going with this thing? It started with fruit puree, pulpy and rich before it went more tart in a gooseberry-like way along with a lot of alcohol and some sugars that tried to balance it out. Neither the blueberry or raspberry came through clearly for me and I kept feeling like the alcohol was rubbing other flavors out. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/full and the carbonation good. It was much more acidic that I would have guessed and though it mellowed out by the time I was finished with it I just wouldn't ever recommend it, especially for the price."
"Conclusion: This was my treat to myself on my 26th birthday; I'd been wanting to try this beer for a long time, and while it was pretty tasty, I was expecting a little more depth and complexity...at any rate, it was pretty tasty with dessert."
"First sip reveals an average body and average carbonation. The beer is caramel malt and some berries too, a little tart. No hints of hops or actually ABV either. Well hidden booze. The beer is interesting, but not sure if Id pay the price for the bottle again."
"Overall give it a shot. Its expensive, but definitely worth a try. I think ill try red and white next time."
"Overall, I'm not sure if age has done this one well, but it's still a tasty beer and a very pleasant change."
"date consumed: 5 Oct 2008"
"D: I buy about a half dozen Black & Blues every year and always look forward to them. I haven't found anything else like it. A good bottle to split with a friend or loved one."
"Pours a hazy light brown with reddish tints with a nice white head that fades fast. The smell is of tart fruit, a few sweet notes, some wheat and yeast notes as well. I expected the smell to be a little more potent. The taste starts tart with a hint of sweet, lots of berries, finishes with the wheat notes and has a long tart aftertaste, very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is smooth a good blend of flavor, a medium-light body, nice carbonation. The drinkability is good, a nice balance and not an overemphasis on the fruit make this one a good session beer. The high ABV might steer you away from too many. Worth checking out, especially fruit beer and saison fans."
"D - Honestly, this is very refined and complex, but the cloying syrupy mouthfeel kinda kills if for me. NOt bad, and totally worth the experience... but this its not something that I'll revisit anytime soon. My wife didn't like it because it wasn't fruity and sugary enough, and while I can appreciate this offering, I thought it was a bit too sweet/sour for me. It's okay."
"Great drinkability for a fruit beer."
"Clear reddish-purple-brown pour with a short, sticky head. Alcoholic fruity aroma. The blueberries and blackberries hit you immediately, but are soon followed by a malt-liquor like flavor mixed with fake sugary fruits. The alcohol is not masked at all. Somewhat disappointing. I thought the guy on the bottle looked like Jimmy Stewart with a black eye."
"This is a slow sipper. I liked the flavor of the beer but still had a hard time finishing the glass."
"For it's age, I think it held up well. This is a nice example of a fruit beer. Recommended, but the price can be a deterrent."
"D - Better than fort but the flavor is to artificial to be enjoyable"
"This stuff is alright, I wouldn't buy it again though. Pretty easy to drink, just not that interesting."
"D - I heard mixed reviews about this brew, so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. However, I found this to be a flavorful beer with a nice sourness and authentic berry character. I admire the fact that DFH really tries to push the brewing envelope. Not everything is going to be outstanding, but you have to respect them for going against the grain. With that said, I found this brew to be quite drinkable."
"Overall, an interesting beer. Not something I'd go out of my way to try again, but it was nice to try."
"Ovrall, this is a decent attempt at a fruit beer, but lags far behind its Belgian brethren. Sort of hard to figure which direction this beer is going. Needs a more cohesive flavor profile. More fruit, less alcohol [which sneaks up on you]."
"With this percentage this is definately not that drinkable."
"I am a huge fan of dfh beers. This wasnt my favorite. It was a thick cloudy beer with a golden color. i didnt really get the raspberry or blueberry aroma. a little but not really. the flavor was sour. didnt taste like fruit. a little bit of an alcohol flavor. mouthfeel syrupy sweet. drinkablity low. will never drink again."
"Really glad I tried this. Not my favorite, but appreciated the interesting quality & out of the box craftmanship by Dogfish Head. Keep up the good work."
"Overall impression: This one is fairly average - and I seem to remember the price being well above average. It is fairly drinkable considering the high abv."
"Drink ability- a very good beer. the only bad thing about this one is the price @ $15 it is a little out of my price range."
"I wouldn't buy this one again."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"D: This brew is nice and subtle, but my girlfriend passed out while drinking ""her"" beer and this was really hard to finish off the whole 750 with her down and out. The fruit becomes taxing and the tartness also. I would recommend drinking this with a dinner party or having at a tasting because it is worth trying but definitely for sharing."
"Drinkability- It was a good beer to try once and move on to a different tap. It may not get revisited by me, but I can't say it was the beer's flaws that caused that. It's worth it for the fruity beer lovers out there."
"Overall, a good brew, not great. Too much fruit in all aspects for me to love it. I'd have everyone once in awhile with friends to change things up but probably wouldn't make it a regular"
"I'm a hophead, but I really liked this one. Probably the best fruit beer I've ever had."
"D - I think that this would make a good dessert beer to sip on fruit beers aren't my favorite style but the random things that DFH puts out are always worth trying once"
"Overall one of the better fruit beers i have had. I was really shocked by how good this one was. I would have no objection to having this again at any time. Really very solid and one of the good ones from DFH."
"The taste was very similar too. You get a mouthful of blueberries and blackberries on every drink. The alcohol content/ flavor tastes a little getting used to but the taste is worth it. Great red hazy color. I highly recommend this beer for any season. its worth the price to try it at least once."
"D-Falls somewhere between imperial lambic and classic fruit ale on the fruit beer scale. Besides the presence of fermented fruit this really has no resemblance of a wine to me whatsoever. The 10% abv is also very well hidden and this one drinks like it is 6%. This is definitely one of the better fruit beers out there that I have tried."
"cheers!"
"D- Still not a big fan of the fruity beers. I'd probably pass on this one again. Worth a try of course. Just not my style still."
"Big bubbly off-white head on cloudy grapefruit coloured body. Carbonation bubbles. An interesting tartness that is overcome by maltiness. I understand the tartness comes through in fresher bottle,this one was one year bottle from Crushinator. A good bitterness, very drinkable, creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable.Thick lace left in glass."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Again, light on carbonation as should be a brew with high alcohol like this. Alcohol is hidden pretty well in the feel and taste of this brew, much better than in Red and White and Fort. Really this is one I could drink all night, nice and easy going down, slight alcohol balance-that is in the flavor of the brew it helps to balance it out-but it's a good brew to sit down and just chill with, finish the growler watch some movies...Got it for a good price, 23.99 for a 2L growler, when a 750 bottle is 12.99...now that's about two beers for 12.99 as opposed to 5-6 for 23.99. Bout a dollar or two cheaper for the growler. This isn't something I'd regularly pick up, its good but I'm not all that crazy about it. Check it out if you like Dogfish Head though. Great beer, one of the better fruit beers that I've had."
"Tasted on 6/30/08."
"Overall an interesting beer. I picked this up as an afterthought while at the beer store. I am not big on fruit beers, even though I do appreciate the lambics now and again. To me this was sort of in the middle. It wasn't a true lambic and it wasn't a true strong ale(even though it was powerful). I am hard pressed to place this beer in any one category and becasue of that I find it difficult to compare to others. I probably would not get this particular one again but I look forward to trying other products that Dogfish Head has to offer."
"Notes: Nice beer, much less tart than I expected. Not a big fruit beer lover, but this was a good brew from a great brewery."
"I've loved DFH for some time now but I've hesitated to try their more creative brews. This was a step in that direction. And while I prefer hops to anything else, they really show some depth in their beers."
"RJR"
"drinkability: easy street for the abv"
"It pours a dark amber into my Dogfish snifter, with a lean white head that lasts all of twenty seconds. The aroma is of, no kidding, berries and alcohol, but the combination seems to emit a tomato-like essence that reminds me of canned tomatoes like my mother use to put up. Very interesting, and a little off-putting. Intense flavors of rich, ripe fruit (mainly raspberries) push through the malts and sweeten the tongue in the center of the taste experience. One detects more malts and alcohol at the finish; hops are barely present, if at all. It's certainly not overly fizzy, and the body is medium. Overall, it's a nice brew, but the sweet, fruity flavors may make it difficult to pair with food. Actually, now that I've said that, this beer may be akin to a French-style rosé wine, so a nice pairing may not be out of the question. Bon appetite!"
"sweet berry flavors over a strong bitterness. finsihes with a bite similar to cherry flavored cough syrup. there is a sour bitterness in the aftertaste. the 10% is hidden well. interesting, but not my thing i suppose. generaly unpleasant flavors to me."
"It's not that it's a bad beer per se, it's just that I was expecting it to be fruitier. In its defense, the fruitiness did increase somewhat as it warmed, but it's still just not quite what I was looking for."
"On tap at Julian's, Providence. Really liked this one. Pours reddish gold with no head. Arome is of sweet berries with a wine finish. I thought the fruits were really well integrated with a very nice vineous quality. Some warming alcohol on the finish. I also thought the bottle version was a little too sweet, but this doesn't seem to be the case on tap."
"Sorry hippk9 but my wife bought the last two bottles of Red & White (which I love too) in Ft. Myers. She also got me this bottle of Black & Blue to try. Not as impressed. A little too sweet and berry-like for me. Pleasant but the big bottle was almost too much."
"The flavor decently blends cidery-sour notes, spicy hops, pale malts, and some fruity bitterness provided by a hint of raspberry. A champagne-like bubbliness coats the palate, as Black & Blue finishes dry and sweet. I've gotta commend DFH on masking the alcohol, as its barely noticable. Verdict: Not a great beer, the price certainly drops the drinkability down a bit, but it was enjoyable."
"The 11% will spank that ass if you aren't careful. Its nowhere to be found in the aroma or taste and before I knew it, I was singing along to Stayin Alive on the TV set... Well done, DFH!"
"d: Hard to believe its so strong. The berry sweetness is balanced out brilliantly by the musky bite in the finish. The fruit is more subtle than I had expected, but I am happy with the result. Won't pay $14 for another bottle, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Bottle is probably best shared with a couple friends."
"This beer would make a good crossover for anybody who likes wine. Fruit flavors with the right amount of alcohol to make it familiar. I think the phenols may throw them off a little. I felt this one was a bit acerbic for my tastes."
"D. Very good session beer, but I would rather have something else for extended periods of drinking."
"Drinkability is moderate to low. High alcohol taste slows consumption, but other flavors are nice."
"Drinkability I would have to rate as very good. Like the Red & White, it doesn't drink at all like the strong beer that it is. Good job Sam."
"Overall-A very good fruit beer. This is well balanced and a fun beer."
"Pours a hazy, dark red color with a small light tan head that dissipates after a couple of minutes. Aroma was very winey and fruity, with lots of berries in the nose. I could also pick up a slight whiff of malts as well. Taste was quite sweet up front, I can definitely taste blueberry, and some warming alcohol. The finish was a combination of sweet and sour with some mouth puckering fruitiness mixed in. Drinkability was surprisingly good for a beer(wine?) of this strength. Despite having my doubts, I liked this beer. Give this brewery credit once again for experimenting and coming up with recipes that push the envelope of what beer can be."
"I'm just not sure about this one. It's a fantastically original recipe, but I'm not sure the execution is as spot-on as it could be. I wish the boys from Milton had taken this more down the route of the Fort and made it more of a wine. I figure some age might also improve things considerably."
"This was a hearty brew with a nice ABV. Poured a dark sunset red color no black nor blue though. Smells like sour raspberries and blueberries with a kiss of oak. Tastes of ripe and sour raspberries and blueberries. I little tart for my taste. I enjoyed this one chilled in a bubbler."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, high carbonation, a bit sticky. Pretty good drinkability. A good dessert beer for sure."
"Drinkability: Very good fruit beer, with nice bit of complexity and sweetness. High ABV could be daunting to some. My main worry about this beer is the $14 price tag. Would buy again, but not for that price."
"Drinkability: I'm surprised that this isn't rated higher, as I was kind of blown away, and this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of fruit beers. But this is wonderfully sour (but in a mild and not overbearing way in the least), complex, and it doesn't seem like alcohol's present at all, even as it warms. Yes, at the around $12 price tag, this is a treat, but I enjoyed it a lot, and I'm not sure I've had a beer quite like it before. DFH lately is hitting all the right notes for me... keep it up."
"To its defense, the alcohol is pretty well-covered, with it adding just a touch of dryness. It went down pretty somewhat quickly, but I wonder if it was the search for more flavor that made it so ""drinkable"". The problem with this beer is more in the ""lacking"" than anything ""off"". Drinkable enough to try - but not to get again."
"Good stuff!"
"This beer feels a little too much like two beers in one. Good flavors but just not quite what I was looking for."
"The color was very impressive, a gorgeous red amber topped with an inch of head. It produced a nice cherry wood smell that could be compared to watered down Capri Sun. The taste was fruity without being sweet. It had a surprisingly light mouthfeel, but the alcohol makes its presence known later. I found it enjoyable, but like other Dogfish Heads, you don't want to take its deceptive lightness for granted- they pack a powerful punch. Each gulp was very airy as it went down and came with a punch of alcohol."
"D - enjoyable, but I don't think I could do more than 1 glass in a sitting (split the 750 mL with my gf, who was a big fan of it last year). My gf seems to think this isn't as good as last year's, but I have nothing to compare it to, so who knows what the difference could be? Might pick up another bottle at some point (would still totally have on draft), but with the cost of beer recently I may end up skipping the second bottle. Still, worth a shot I'd say."
"Wow I was blown away by this one!! Awesome peachy-red color as I poured it into an oversized wine glass. About one fingers worth of peachy white head with a good amount of lacing present as the glass emptied. A bitter smell to it at first and later on noticed a strong alcohol scent. It had the most amazing taste, both a sweet and bitter raspberry flavor first followed by a tart blueberry ending. Simply delicious I could drink this all day long. Didn't notice the alcohol at all, very deceiving, as I finished the bottle it began to hit me. I've got to get my hands on another one of these. This is the best beer I've had in a while!"
"D = I think this one is definitely one to go with food and I suspect spicy food, not sure I want it again just to sit around and drink though."
"This one went down very easily. The alcohol is hidden very well."
"pours a bright ruby copper color with a two finger white puffy head that hold well but minimal lacing. smells better from the bottle than from the glass which is kind of funky. malty taste with blackberry and blueberry blending well. mouthfeel and carbonation ok. thought the red and white much better."
"Poured into a DFH glass a nice clear/clean golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, blueberries, black raspberries, some spices, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet at first, then some tangyness from the berries, slight spice, and some caramel. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very very well in this one. Very drinkable, I like this one as well as the Red/White brew."
"Black & Blue is yet another Dogfish Head offering that promises much more than it delivers. Audaciousness is an admirable trait, but at some point a brewery has to come through with killer beer. Bottom line: a good idea wasted."
"Drinkability- Perfectly fine brew. Liked it, but probably wouldn't buy it again...especially for the $14."
"Just not altogether crazy about this one. Good, but not great. Enjoyable, though. Specially at the end, when the expectations wear off."
"D- Not a bad beer. I just don't think the fruity beers are my thing."
"This would be an excellent dessert beer and I suspect that it would be able to stand up to an even longer cellaring."
"D: For a fruit beer drinks very nicely and wine-like. Not as good as the red and white though."
"D - A bit of a berry bruiser w/ a full malt and alcoholic influence. The dry texture makes for an easy to drink beer, yet it still shows the 10% abv fully. I like how the fruit is not overly sweet and it still has beer character w/ the cooler taste you might usually associate w/ fruit beer. This is one I would drink again and again, yet not very drinkable as far as sessionability goes. One of the better fruit ales I have had since the black + blueberry flavor actually adds to the taste of the ale."
"D: For 10% it goes down easy. I had a bottle last summer and I drank it too quickly. Learned my lesson and took my time with this one. Despite all the grapes it was not overly sweet. Dogfish strikes again. They keep pushing the envelope."
"Overall- Another ""envelope pusher"" from DFH. Neat and different, but just not a great beer IMO. Carries more wine like qualitites, but might be something special if paired with the right dinner. I appreciate what these guys do everytime they try something different, just for the fact that they are breaking the mold."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. More like drinking juice than drinking beer, I'd say. has the consistency and mouthfeel of a brew, but the berry taste does well to make this beery easy to drink and hard to put down. Excellent!"
"Overall, I don't know why exactly, but it left me wanting more. I think maybe sub-consciously when you open a dig fancy bottle you're expecting to get blown away by either flavor, aroma, or both. This beer did neither, so it seemed a bit disappointing, but it's certainly not a bad beer at all."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Pours ruby red with a pinkish head that falls to 1/8"". Smell is rich malt with vinous and blueberry notes, and a touch of yeast. Taste is mostly Belgain yeast, biscuity malt, and alcohol. Where'd the fruit go? There is a slight sweetness that is reminiscent of a tripel, but no flavors I'd identify as fruity, aside from a vague winey dryness at the end. Mouthfeel is appropriately thick for the ABV/style, without being syrupy. Pretty light on its feet for 10%ABV."
"This one poured a medium red colour with burnt orange edges. It also had a thin skim of fine, off-white foam and a ring of large bubbles that produced a bit of spotty lacing. The aroma was fruity, heavy on berry sweetness and a little yeasty. Mild bitterness with a lot of berry flavour up front, followed by earthy fruit skins and a slight tartness. A bit of malt provides some sweetness and there was a light alcohol flavour in the finish. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation. Slightly syrupy texture with a little warmth. Overall, the mouthfeel was a little dead. Decent for a big beer and impressive because the fruit really provides most of the character without seeming artificial. I split this one with my wife and she enjoyed it as well."
"Overall: Thanks HimerMan for giving me the chance to try this one. Although not quite what I expected, it was good. I love everything I have ever had from Dogfish Head."
"The dry tannins don't compliment the fruty tones of the beer. This makes for some off flavors that effect drinkability."
"Tastes similar to the nose, tart and sweet. Very different, glad to have tried it."
"doesn't matter- the only rule that matters is taste, and this one is good."
"Meh an OK beer but not one I would buy. There is just nothing all that great about this beer. If I am going to buy a DFH fruit beer it is going to be Fort or Red & White."
"Don't drink and review."
"The beer sluices from the 750ml bottle a slightly chill hazed golden amber color with a bright white creamy two fingered head that settles quickly leaving a thin blanket of lace to seal off the glass. Nose has a sweet and sour note, spicy with a modest hint of the berries, hints of fusel alcohol, and at 11 percent ABV, no wonder. Start is ambrosial, fair to middling malt presence, and a mild tartness from the black raspberries, but not overly so, top is light to medium in feel. Finish carries on the sweet and tart duo, hops understated, and the alcohol present but well hidden, acidity benign and the aftertaste dry and tart. Ive learned to like this style, and Dogfish Head has been the reason why, a Marvelous brewery."
"In conclussion my fellow Americans, Black & Blue will infuse you with the zest to put up aforementioned bundting on your porch and Vote for Sam!"
"Meh an OK beer but not one I would buy. There is just nothing all that great about this beer. If I am going to buy a DFH fruit beer it is going to be Fort or Red & White."
"Although it is masked relatively well, the ABV does make this a sipping beer. Still a great and interesting berw; things I have come to expect and enjoy from DFH."
"Somewhat mediocre and unbalanced. But still, rather drinkable."
"D - I won't bother with this ever again. A definite was of money and liver strength. Much better beers exist out there and for much less. Yet another drastically overpriced DFH offering."
"D: This 10% beer (per the label) is a whopper that you may want to share with someone. The fruit flavors are strong but don't mistake this for a sugary sweet experience, this beer is big and bad with a lot of swagger."
"Drinkability - a sort of Imperial Fruit Beer, this is tasty and potent like Genesis 10:10, yet more elegant like Quelque Chose. Though an expensive bottle, I'd purchase it again."
"Recommended"
"Black & Blue pours an orange color with a white head from a brown 750 ml bottle. The aroma is quite muted, perhaps some berry, but mostly just malt. The taste is mostly malt, no hops to be found. And surprisingly little fruit to be found either. There is a hint of berry, which mostly was noticeable in the aftertaste, but it's not nearly as bold as I would hope from this brewer. It's not bad, but it's not what I had expected or hoped for from them either. Worth trying."
"D- solid beer with a great blending of flavors"
"Another interesting and well done beer by DH. Can't say much more than that except cheers."
"Bottle courtesy of John_adam2002: Poured a medium brown/reddish color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet grain is kind of weird. Taste is dominated by sweet malt with an unrefined grain taste which didnt really agree with my taste buds. Body is pretty average with some medium carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. I couldnt really taste much fruit or hops in this beer contrary to what the label advertised. Overall, I thought this was not bad but it wasnt even close to being as great as what the label lead me to expect."
"Drinkability - this is decent, but not great. It goes well with food or dessert, it is not really a session beer, and its high abv would rule out sessionability in any case."
"Pours a clear red/cranberry juice colour, huge off white head forms, laces pretty well, good retention. Smell is caramel, citrus, blackberry moonshine. Taste is sweet, malt liquor, fruits, alcohol, some berry but mostly overpowering sweetness and fusel alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost thin flavour, high to medium, almost prickly carbonation, alcohol burn, weak finish, not too exciting. Can't say I enjoyed this much. Thanks Lexx!"
"The very preety fruit juice colorings make up for the lack of head, the bubbling isn't bad either. I was expecting a more pronounced berry aroma, but was a little let down when the nose came up a little short. I was glad I could smell the blackberries, but the blueberries seemed to be a bit obscured. The taste was alright, especially considering the fruits don't overpower the overall taste of the beer. I could taste the Belgian malts as well as the black and blue berries. Very smooth palate. But overall a little blander than I expected. I'm glad I tried this beer. But it was a little sub-par."
"Nice berry taste with both the black and blue berry flavors coming through. A dark ruby color and a velvety finish. I prefer drinking it from a snifter rather than the squat water glass you are provided at the bar. The alcohol (10%) let it's presence be known but it didn't overpower anything. You missed out if you didn't get any this year. Lets hope they brew it again in 2008."
"This offering from DFH pours a light eggplant color with a blue hue essence leaving a orange/blue head thick and frothy. The aroma is tart, horse blanket, grassy, doughy, barnyard ripened fruit. Appearence is picture perfect. The taste is boozey upfront, sweet blueberry, apple, apricot, wheat tart bite followed by a smooth alcohol feel on the back of the palate. This is a great brew overall solid fruity boozey brew made for sipping."
"Pours a translucent purplish red with a blackberry aroma. The flavor is ""all fruit all the time," and yet the fruit isn't too intense -- it's nicely crisp, and the alcohol makes its presence felt. It has a sour, bitter-crisp finish. For me fruit beers are a not a staple, but a great change of pace, and in that context this is recommended."
"Not impressed at all. Must rate as avoid if possible. I appreciate what DFH is all about and the chances they take, but this beer is not my thing."
"Incredibly drinkable, for its potency, but not as cool as I hoped it would be. Still, hats off (as always) to Dogfish Head for trying something new."
"d- rather underwhelming offering, particularly for a fruit beer. I dont think i could even tell this was a 'fruit beer' in a blind taste test. This was good for a group beer tasting, but I probably won't go in for round two anytime soon."
"I thought this beer was decent, but it may have been just a bit too mellow. A mix of half this and half Forte I think would be perfect!"
"Not very fruity and kind of boring all gimmicks aside, probably my least favorite DFH beer I've ever had."
"Overall a really good beer, but I feel like the same flavor could be acheived at much lower abv. I'd drink it again, but I probably wouldn't pay for it."
"Drinkablility: Fine. I'll drink it. More because of what I paid for it rather than what's inside the bottle. Probably the biggest disappointment I've experienced from DFH. A total 180 from their Red and White, which I thought was very good."
"Drinks easy. I could see the alcohol in this one creeping up on me rapidly."
"Drinkability is decent, with the 11%ABV nearly impossible to detect anywhere but in your hangover."
"Overall: Not too bad, glad my beer guy kept one back for me to try. I missed out on the Red & White which is unfortunate since it gets really good reviews. This one is a pretty good fruit beer, but is somewhat lacking in taste. I with DFH would have put a little more berry punch in this one."
"Highmarks for feel and drinkability. It drinks like a smooth wine, where other smooth fruit beers are simply juice-like. The flavor, however, leaves a lot to be desired. It's just bland. There's mellow, light malt profile with a touch of blueberries, but that's it. It might be a decent, in not expensive, gateway beer for wine drinkers."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a good carbonation. This one goes down really easily considering the abv and I could see it getting me in trouble if I drank too much. There's really no alcohol flavor at all in here. Overall, an interesting brew but it didn't really grab me enough to want to buy another bottle at the price point it sells for. There's many other things I would choose first."
"decent drinkability, sort of a big sticky beer, but the alcohol is well hidden actually. overall, worth a try, but nothing i'd come back to."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy purple head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light blueberry scent with very little malt aroma. The alcohol is also well hidden. The taste is decent. It has a mild fruit flavor that boasts of black raspberries and blueberries. The malt bill seems quite simple and lacking character. I understand this is a fruit beer, but it really doesn't do much for me. The mouthfeel is average. It's a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a real letdown. I was hoping for something bold, but it really didn't live up to the hype."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with pretty good carbonation. This beer is quite drinkable for 11%, but was not interesting enough for me to want more than one glass."
"Drinkability: The real loser in all of this is me, as I still have another bottle of this stuff waiting for me at home."
"The bottled date on this one was 2/13/07, so it had almost exactly 4 months aging. It pours a very dark rich red color with no head. There are visible bubbles rising from the bottom of my DFH snifter. The only smell I get off of this is a wine-type aroma and it isn't very strong. I like that the fruit is fairly subtle, or at least not with the usual accompanying sweetness. The raspberries are up front, and as they fade out the blueberries step to the front. It's almost hard to think of this as a beer as it tastes and feels more like a wine. I do get a bit of malt flavor in the background, but just a very little bit. I like this beer for what it is and I'm interested to see if aging will change it at all. My guess is that it will probably only hold it's own or go downward."
"750 ml bottle, 12 oz sample. The beer is a deep rose to light red color with a tight 2 finger that falls to a nice coating over top of the brew. Clarity is moderate and there is a small carbonation running through the glass. The aroma is giving me definite blackberry fruityness that sits over a base that reminds me of wheaty beers, and is the same as I have found in the Red and White and Fort. The flavor is a little subdued to me. The fruityness is dominant, but it is also interrupted by a detectable alcohol character. It really seems to be somewhat distant in the flavor category. I'd like a more prevalent character. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, with a mild carbonation. I think the alcohol character works towards making the beer feel more thin. Overall, I am finding this beer interesting. It delivers what I expected, just not in the quantities as far as flavor goes."
"Crimson tinged amber robe. Little to no head at the pour, and what's left dissipates quickly. Fruity in the nose, but not nearly as bold as you might expect. The flavor is sugary, but not sweet. And it's not boldly fruity. There's some black raspberry, but not so much blueberry. Jam like. It's only subtly tart, and it could stand a little tartness to balance the sugary side. The alcohol is present though, although it's not rough and actually seems to work within the dextrinous flavor and body. Interesting. Drinkable. More of an apertif or nightcap beer."
"Pours a light amber in color, clear, with a bright soapy white head that slowly recedes. Aroma is strong of berries, no surprise, and also shows some lemon and perfumy soapiness. Taste shows both raspberry and blueberry, mingling with a good sized malty sweetness, some crisp carbonation, esp when cold, and a dry and perfumy finish. Medium in body, nice dry finish. The alcohol is barely evident for its size, however all of th flavors seem to be fighting each other rather than blending well together. I like my fruit beers to either be slightly lighter in body, I found the bigger maltiness didn;t blend well with the berries, or to be more singularly focused on the fruit flavor, here things seem to be competing. Glad that dfh is pumping out new and different product, this one while interesting, isn't up my alley."
"D- I won't have it again. A disappointment... just too much of some strange yeast."
"Pours a reddish or even pinkish amber. Litlle head and no lacing, but a fascinating color. The smell is still a little hot, but beyond the alcohol is a hit of yeast and dry dark berries. The taste is also quite yeasty and there are more dark berry flavors. Not sweet at all, rather the flavor is more jammy as found in a wine. The blueberries are more prominent tasting the black raspberry, at least initially, but as it warms the raspberry becomes more evident. Dry and very drinkable, but definitely a big beer. I like it."
"Drinkability: this is a unique fruit beer that is definitely worth trying because of the nice flavors, but to me this is a ""one bottle, one time of year"" beer - and if it comes out next year I'll probably pick one up."
"An outstanding pro for this beverage is its 10% ABV and its unbelievably coy drinkability."
"Going into this, I feared I was spending $14 for a fruity malt liquor, and my fears were confirmed. Once again Dogfish Head suckered me into ponying up way to much another one of their failed experiments. I'm beginning to really resent this brewery, in spite of their occasional hits. Kinda like Microsoft software, I'm tried of paying for the privilege of beta testing. Resist the temptation, it may sound good and has a cool label, but is definitely not recommended!"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours an amber orange color with minimal pink head that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is sweet berries and fruit also a bit of bread in the nose. Taste hits my tongue with a tarte taste of berries and a bit of malt character, little carbonation but quite smooth, it has a unique taset and one I truly enjoyed. This was a fine and different offering very good, I was expecting it to not be as good as it was. Drinkability is very high for such a high abv on a beer this went down smooth and under control, I could drink this fine beverage all day long."
"Eric"
"Hot & Heavy alcohol presence (too much for my liking), with a cloying barleywine distinction. Not as fruit/wine-like as I would have expected. Not refreshing. Not very complex. DFH hasn't impressed me in quite a while now. I think I'm done giving them the benefit of the doubt. And my money."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a meduim body. The beer is very medicinal and boozey in mouthfeel. As stated previously this beer doesnt really work for me. The beer was drinkable and nowhere near a sink pour; however, the beer just doesnt work for me on so many levels. I got a drinking experience from this similar to having berry extract added to my malt liquor. With that said I know the beer is experimental. I have enjoyed numerous experimental brews. I will most likely buy another DFH experimental beer. Thanks for continueing to push the envelope."
"Overall: Like many of DFHs specialty beers, this one is interesting and pricey and overall not terribly remarkable. I only bought it because it was a limited release; I vastly prefer DFHs more established offerings such as their 90 Minute IPA. Worth trying for obsessive completists such as myself, or if you just love niche craft beers."
"What an odd beer. It tastes like a ""40"" mixed with a berry lambic. Not to bad, but not a beer I'd pay for again."
"D- There are some subtle hints of fruit but not much of interest in this beer. It could use more flavor of some sorts but the alcohol is very smooth for such a big beer."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" lavender head over the slightly cloudy bright red brew. Head holds on well, with tons of slow-falling lace. Aroma is rich an d fruity, without the intensity that sometimes makes one think artificial. Taste is lightly malty, with somewhat generic fruitiness coming on in the middle, and becomes more blueberry as the flavor lingers after the swallow. Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy, and drinkability is not bad for a fruit brew. I enjoyed this brew, but probably wouldn't revisit for the cost. Your mileage may vary."
"Second pour from the bomber was from up high. Results yielded a nice head that remained for awhile. Alcohol presence came through as it warmed. More sweetness and dark fruit characteristics."
"The mouth is rather syrupy, though this shouldn't really be surprising. But it's not as well balanced as I would have liked, and the alcohol is overdone. Defintely not one of my favorites from DFH. If looking for sweeter brew, the Midas Touch or Chateau Jihau are superior."
"The beer pours an amber brown color, with very good head retention and nice lacing. The nose is pretty closed, though I get a hint of ginger and malt. The beer has a very nice rich mouthfeel, with flavors of honey, butter and melon. There is a soft creaminess on the palate, and the beer has a smooth, lingering finish. The abv. is really well disguised in this beer. Knowing Sam, I figured it would be up there, but this does not taste like a beer with an 11% abv. Absolute amazing. Another winner from DFH."
"The color was very impressive, a gorgeous red amber topped with an inch of head. It produced a nice cherry wood smell that could be compared to watered -down Kool-Aid (if I were very cynical.) The taste was fruity without being sweet. It had a surprisingly light mouthfeel, but the alcohol makes its presence known later. I found it enjoyable, but like other Dogfish Heads, you don't want to take its deceptive lightness for granted- they pack a powerful punch. Each gulp was very airy as it went down, yet grants a buzz."
"The smell didn't blow me away. It hinted at some sweetness. The taste wasn't overwhelming of fruit (which I like) and just gave a hint of blueberry and blackberry in the sweetness as you sipped. Not much in the line of hops, and the alcohol is somewhat evident. This was a pleasant beer to sip over a couple of hours. It would make a nice dessert beer."

"Well, this is by far the worst brew I've had from DFH. I feel cheated for shelling out $12 for this bottle. The fruit flavor is bland and subdued, and the only other flavor that really comes through is the alcohol. Pass on this one..."
"Overall Dogfish Head has created a solid fruit beer, but it was not what I was hoping for. I did, however, try it during a tasting that involved a lot of great 'Big' beers that may have overshadowed some of the Black & Blue's more subtle qualities. I would like to try it again and see if any of my opinions change."
"large capped Belgian style bottle, bottling date etched onto bottle, nice/fresh beer is good. Pours a great looking ruby/berry color with a raspberry tinged head, leaves some spotty lacing upon a moderate swirl. Fruity, lightly sugary nose. This one is sweet and fruity, as expected, berries, jam up front. Light, summery brew, would be nice as an apperatif or with a warm weather lunch/dessert. Champagne with a strawberry in it like qualities. When judged as a dessert beer, I think this one would at the top of the charts. Nice creation, crafted with skill and care from DFH."
"Label has ABV at 10%."
"A good offering, but I'll not be a repeat buyer. Nice to see something new from DFH."
"This seems like a good beer, but nothing really to spectacular hits me other then the style and mixture of ingredients that DFH has tried to induce into this ale. A one time try will do, other then that, its perhaps passable. Refreshingly zippy enough and mildly fruity but just not enough draw or character to really perk interest beyond the cool name and label."
"Overall this is a neat experiment and an excellent beer to get wine drinkers interested. It has a lot of champagne qualities, from the fizziness to the wine-like flavors."
"Drinkability: I could see this being a nice refreshing summer beer if it weren't for the ABV."
"D- Unfortunately it is too powerful to have much of, maybe as a dessert on a special ocassion."
"Overall a good balanced fruit beer. Just enough fruit to know what you are drinking, good masking of alcohol, easy to drink and a good strong beer for summer. I dont think I could make this a regular but maybe this should be on a rotating every other year schedule."
"I love the attempt, but I think it misses the mark."
"Poured a redish tinted amber color with a tight white head. Wonderful aromas of dark berries and some mild floral hops. Smooth and creamy taste of rich yet mild blackberries and blueberries. Hops and malt make a well enough presence so that the beer is not too sweet. Well balanced and very drinkable for the ABV. Recommended."
"Capped 750ml bottled on 02/12/07. Pours a slightly pinkish amber color with a small head. The aroma was mostly grain with just a hint of berries and a good whiff of alcohol. The taste was on the otherhand was just a mess. It tasted sort of like a bad berry wine. There was really not much malt or hops at all. The drinkability was low due to it being unbalanced and boozy. Overall, I am very dissapointed with this brew as I had such high expectations after the Red & White. Not reccomended."
"After recently enjoying the Red and White, I had big expectations for this brew. Though nice, it did not live up to the hype. The beer pours a 'grape-juice' looking ruby color with formitable retention that soon faded. The abundant aromas shows a blast of juicy berry character with a strong note of red wines and oak. The flavors show a berry, wine tartness, but lacks the intense flavors expected. The barrel gives a bold muskiness and earthiness (nearly horse blanket) which dominated the fresh fruits. The feel ended up a bit thin, although hiding the alcohols well. Finishes wiht a mild astringency and lambic quality. Nice, but just expected more."
"750ml bottle from Florian's. Translucent ruby-red body with a quarter inch of off-white head. Smell is weaker than expected, but consists mostly of blackberry with a hint of blueberry. Blue and black berries dominate the flavor as expected, with hints of caramel malt, making for a mostly sweet beer with a hint of sourness. Surprsisingly little alcohol present in the flavor. And while the body is atad syruppy, it;s oddly drinkable for such a big beer. Maybe getting this one again."
"750 ml bottle. ABV listed as 10% on the label, but who's counting when it's that strong? Pours up the color of a Manhattan, or like iced tea with a splash of cranberry in it. Light pink head holds nicely for a while. Subtle berry aroma with whiffs of alcohol and a medarate grainy aroma to it. I can tell I served this one up too cold so I'm going to come back to it in about 10 minutes. I can definitely pick up on the berry content now that it's warmed a bit, noticeably the blueberry (I love fresh blueberries, one of the reasons I had to try this beer). This beer certainly does have an alcoholic warmth to it. After a couple of sips, my stomach feels a touch warmed. The berry flavor is subtle, taking a back seat to a malty, grainy tasting beer. No descernable hop aroma or flavor to take note of, although there is a organic vegetal quality to the beer, but not hops. Carbonation seems a bit subtle due to the medium-to-thick body of the beer. Initially malty and sweet, with a faint tartness near the finish. I mentioned that I love blueberries and I'm just delighted that this beer kept its flavor in check. I've been disappointed with any other blueberry beer I've tried because they always taste like a Jelly Belly jellybean or if Kool-Aid made a blueberry flavor. Sam keeps reinventing his line of beers like Madonna keeps reinventing herself, only difference is that Sam is God and Madonna only thinks she is."
"750 ml bottle, bottled on 2/12/07. The beer pours a red/purple/amber/brown color with a white/light pink head. Head retention and lacing are good. I can smell berries/fruit, not necessarily raspberries and blueberries but the aroma is fruity. The taste is sweet and tart berries with a bit of a medicinal flavor and malt, but no hops that I can taste. Taste does get a bit better as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light and a bit slick. The alcohol isn't noticable at first, but it does kick in later on. Drinkability is OK, but nothing special. Overall I think it's a decent beer, but a bit of a disappointment to me."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle with no date on the bottle. Poured into a tulip glass, this beer was a reddish hue with a small head. It had a sweet aroma. I couldn't detect any particular fruit. Taste was the same: sweet, but not much else. I think after drinking the bottle that maybe I could taste some backberry, but I,m not sure. No hint of blueberry. Some malt gave it a decent mouthfeel. This beer was too sweet for me."
"Ignored beer advocate glass suggestion and poured into a Grolsch glass. Head levels out a good two centimeters off the surface with decent retention and delicate almost gray lacing. The body is red amber, with purple tones, bright red high lights and some peach/pink. Its moderately translucent, with good clarity, and tiny bubbles. The smell reminds me of fall immediately for some reason, maybe because I had Jiahu ( and this reminds me of that?) for the first time this fall, but I can not say for sure. I get no absolute traces of raspberry or blue berry, although I do get strong hints of berry, but what specifically I cannot discern. Malt is present with a weird dried corn note, plus very little hop aroma. As it warms the fruit becomes much more apparent almost sticky in my nostrils. Taste is slightly gummy or jammy alcohol is perceptible but by no means over powering. I taste hints of fruit in the beginning, a tinge of bitterness in the midsection and another flourish of berry character coupled with light malt on the finish. I didnt notice the normal alcohol warmth you would immediately after taking a sip of something 10 abv, but it did ketch up with my soon after. For me the mouth feel was a bit unexpected on this, I thought there would be much more residual sugar left over from the fruit after fermentation. I get the feeling the fruit had so much fermentable sugar in it that it left a smaller amount of desirable fruit flavor and aroma, but in tern helped to boost the ABV so high. Very interesting, definitely not a sessionable beer, not because of the drinkable factor simply because of the ABV. Fun and interesting to try, but if it were available year round I doubt Id buy it."
"It is a ruby/purple red crystal clear beer with a faintly off pink head. The head was huge, but it dissapated quickly and only left a little bit of lace. The aromas are of strong raspberries, black berries, oak and some phenol alcohol. But only very faint phenols, as the regular alcohol comes in strong flanking the beer like the Viet Cong. The taste is very sweet raspberries, black berry fruity flavors along with the balance of woody oak. There is a lot of alcohol in the back ground, and as it warms it gets even stronger. Never the less, it doesnt leave that traditional alcohol burn on you palette. I think this would make a great reduction sauce for some vanila ice cream, and pound cake. Very nice. Once Again, Sam you've out done your self."
"Great reddish/blue color. Nice thin white head. Reminds me of the one berlinner weisse I have had in my life. Good aroma-fruity with a mellow lactic type smell to it. Fruity and dry flavor. Some malt flavor. No real bitterness to it. Good sourness. The fruit/malt dominates. While the label says blueberries and blackberries neither stands out-just says fruit. Nice body for being 11%. Overall a nice beer. Doesnt really stand out in any way shape or form. I know they are 2 seperate beers and styles but the Red and White puts this away."
"That is not to say that the beer is not made well. I think DFH did a good job considering what it is, and I respect them greatly for it. I just think perhaps this is one direction that extreme beer shouldn't venture much further."
"This beer poured a dark red color and formed a pure white bubbly head that disappeared leaving trace lace. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of berries and not much else present. The flavor was of blackberries and raspberries with some medicinal aspects to it. It has a fairly light body to it and the finish was tart. It's hard to review Dogfish's experitmental offerings since they always go to the extreme, which isn't necessarily the best wasy to approach a brew."
"Stay with the Red and White!"
"Dry astringent metallic/medicinal berry flavors, with a strong Robitussin sensation that summons up deep buried memories of the most horrible illnesses, and almost makes me gag. What happened here? Red & White was phenominal, the best large beer DFH has done in while. This is a chore to suck down, and may meet a watery grave in my drain before long. Alcohol becomes apparent a few sips in, with a bit of hotness that goes straight to the head."
"I'm taken back by the taste. Off balance of berries (black and blue I assume). The metallic hint is back. Moves from thin to syrupy. Perhaps i expect too much from DFH, but this is not very good. A nice attempt, though."
"Drinkability: Pretty easygoing. Light flavors and body make this a pretty refreshing ale. That said, the flavors aren't prevalent enough to hold my interest for too long."
"It poured nicely, developed a decent size head and had a nice purple/ruby color. There was little head retention. Had a nice smell and initial taste was good, not overpowering on the fruit, although it did leave me actually wanting to taste more of the berries. The mouthfeel fell flat and left a chalky feeling on the back of my tounge. It's not a bad beer, but my high standards for Dogfish left me expecting to be blown away by this one and it did nothing of the sort."
"It poured a deep purple/reddish color with a head that was gone within seconds and like I said before the first few drinks were very pleasant."
"Very unimpressive beer from Dogfish Head. Pours a dark purple, berry like color, flavor and taste was just so so, no better, no worse than any other fruit beer. C'mon Sam, show us the love. Beer had at GABF in Denver so only a small sample. Poured by Sam the man himself."
"I was really looking forward to having a brew-pub only beer on my travels to Rehobeth Beach, but this was not what I wanted. The premiss for this beer was taking a belgian-like recipe with a strain of yeast and during primary fermentation feeding blueberries and blackberries everydayto the yeast beasties. Man was this a painfull thing like almost all of their spirits. Bruise color no real head. Smells like boozy berries. Tastes like bad berries wine. Yuck, maybe they will be able to turn this around the next time they make it like they did with Fort."
"It's like bad medicine mixed with a caramelized, concentrated wine mix. This is worse than the sacramental wine that we would taste when we were alter boys...blech!"
"Only available on tap at the Rehoboth Beach brewpub location, which is a good thing. This is a sour beer, and not in a good lambic way. Sour as in an off-tasting, bad-wine kind of way. Black & Blue seems to have a lot of characteristics of bad cheap wine, actually. It comes across as not being aged enough. Maybe if it was left to sit for a while it would mellow out, but as it stands now, this is an offensive-tasting, intrusive beer. The Black & Blue's cousin beer, ""Red & White"" was completely sold out in under a month, whereas B&B was still available, which should tell you something. Overpriced, too alcoholic, and difficult to finish. Avoid."
"Upon your first sniff of this beer it is pretty evident that it was brewed with a ton of fruit, about 300 lbs of fresh blackberries and blueberries to be exact. The taste is spicey, a bit tart and definitely led by blueberries and supported by the blackberries. You can also get a touch of the hops on the backend that round out this beer and a strong bit of carbonation running through. Although the fruit and spice blend well to form a pretty smooth, not too sweet beer, you definitely get the high abv burn on this one, more so than with the DFH Red & White. Although this beer is pretty extreme from the amount of fruit added and the high abv, it is suprisingly drinkable and smooth and worth a try if you can get it before it runs out."
