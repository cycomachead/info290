"In your face raspberries.  Too sweet for me.  Wife Loves it."

"Tastes like juice, but it's not too sweet. Nice balance."

"Pours a clear garnet red with effervescence geysering from the goblet stem toward the surface, producing barely a single finger of shortlived, rose hued, foamy head that leaves only a few small motes & wisps of lacing. Aroma is sweet, raspberry, strawberry & faint cranberry (in that order) in a malty background with a hint of plastic. Taste is medicinal, very raspberry (jam like) & other red fruits, caramel malt, reminiscent of mineral water, cherry cola, Luden's Wild Cherry cough drops. Tart, bitter & musty finish with a phenolic, raspberry, black cherry & bitter aftertaste. No hop presence. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, wet & drawing with a little prickle. To be truthful I'm disappointed."

"Medicinal, and too sweet for my tastes..."
""
""

"Excellent.  Reminds me more of a raspberry wine - very good."

"Complete syrup bomb. disappointed by this."

"I could drink this all day, everyday! Deliciously sweet and satisfying."

"Absolutely delicious... The slightly sour raspberry taste compliments the smooth sweetness of the beer. Would definitely recommend."
"Despite being brewed with raspberries, I get a lot of strawberry sweetness that seems to balance this out nicely. The malt is hidden but it stills gives off a ""beer"" flavor that's reminds you that this is not a Smirnoff Ice. It's Rubaeus on steroids, for sure, which makes it a better experience."

"O - An awesome beer.  Wife said it tastes like a push-pop.  She dug it.  Well done!"

"This beer has a beautiful pinkish color. It has a great raspberry smell to it. This is a very sweet beer and tastes strongly of rasberries. I was very impressed with the smell and taste. This was a top notch fruit beer in my opinion"

"This is awesome. Lots of raspberries but drinks a little hot for a berliner right now. It needs some age on it, but I think it will be really good once I cellar it for a while."
""
""
""
"Clear pink, lots of raspberries, not much else, but the raspberry flavor is spot on.  Not artificial at all."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a massively tasty brew that having it now, I'd be hard pressed to want to cellar this one for very long. Can't for see present flavor developing more favorable but maybe one day I'll see. Regardless, good to have this one making another appearance."
""

"Slightly medicinal in flavor without being off-putting"
"A: Brilliant garnet with a 2.5‚Äù lacy pink foam cap that slowly dissipates. S: Big fresh raspberry nose laced with tartness. T: Raspberry and lemon with light grains M: Medium body and above medium carbonation O: I have had this in the bottle and on tap. The bottle is more carbonated and is an excellent, tart fruit ale and the carbonation helps tame the fruit. The tap version was barely drinkable."
"Overall: good but not great. I can see this one becoming really nice in a couple of years, but as for now it could use a little something to take the edge off the sweetness. a bit more alcohol in the taste might be nice too."
""
"A bit sweet but nailed the style--thinking a few years of age will do this some good."
"Interesting beer on draft.  Too much berry juice flavor for me.  I wanted to drop an ice cube in it and drink it like a high schooler drinks a wine cooler.  Just fruit fruit and more fruit.  Not my cup of tea."
""

""

""

""
"Served as a cordial, this would be divine.  As a beer, it's uneven--perhaps it was foolish of me to try to drink so much all by myself."
"I tend to like sweet and intense, fruit-forward beers, but Blushing Monk came across as a cloyingly and somewhat artificial, mixed berry flavored mess. This beer has nothing on New Glarus's Raspberry Tart."
""
"""Imperial Rubaeus"" sums up Blushing Monk pretty nicely. A really great fruit beer - there's no style that Founders doesn't do well."
""
""
""
"Found this to be overly sweet and one dimensional. Its a raspberry bomb. I would like some more complexity. I won't be buying again at 16.99 a bot."

"Not a Belgium or a fruit guy, but thought this was awesome..but too expensive. Going to try yhe rubeus."

"Raspberry wine with more raspberries than one can imagine.  Not my thing, I don't care for wine and hated this.  Luckily my wife loved it.  No false advertising here, tastes exactly like what they describe."
"Tasted from draft at Firkin on March 27, 2015."

"A dessert beer.  It really pulls off the sweet with tart without being too obnoxious.  Well executed.  Had it on draft."

"Very strong raspberry taste. A bit sweet, a little boozy. Pretty good."

"I have this weird affinity for raspberries, so I knew I would love this.  Borderline sexual at times."
"3/24/15 Founders tasting @ Clinton Hall, NYC."
""
"This beer is beyond sweet. Cloying, overwhelming, beyond sweet. Pours decent with nice red color, clarity and head. Smell is strong raspberries, but no surprise there. The Belgian notes are completely lost in the fruit flavor, and the acid overwhelms everything else. Can't even taste the malt. No sense of balance; it's like drinking thick syrup. I would avoid this beer like the plague."

"2015 vintage. Poured from the 750 ml into a snifter. Overall not a ridiculous tart flavor hit definitely get a beautiful raspberry base. I'd love to see how this ages over time. Worth a try if your into sweeter raspberry beers. Very much like framboise, but less tart and higher abv..."
""
"2015 vintage. Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a deep, vibrant, ruby coloring with a tall, frothy, pink-tinged head that quickly settles out into a frothy surface coating. Aromas of richly sweet and subtly tart raspberries, almost identical to the smell when you are making Jell-O and add the hot water to the powder. Really all encompassing the nose, but if you dig there are some hints of candi sugar and a bready backbone. Flavors are all raspberry forward, richly sweet and with a subtle tart character that puckers your mouth just a bit. The beer is big, with a dry undertone that makes you want to drink more. Really smooth and tasty. Some subtle bready and sugary notes are mixed in the palate, as well, and work as perfect accent notes. This is an insanely drinkable beer. The ABV is extremely hidden. The aftertaste is a subtle linger of the raspberry fruit notes, leading into a smooth, lingering tart and dry finish. This is a tasty damn beer!"
""
""
"A huge improvement on Rubaeus."
""
""
""
"Deep red raspberry juice w/malt."
""
""
""
"Phenomenal raspberry bomb of flavor!  2015 version looks, smells, and tastes amazing.  Cant find much to count against it, bravo Founder's!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Alcohol is pretty well hidden and the beer is quite enjoyable though it might pair better with a chocolate dessert vs. a main course."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice fruit beer from Founders, imperial rubaeus wouldn't be out of the question, a bit sweet and syrupy, heavy and very one dimensional, just plain raspberry juice. The booze starts to come through a bit which adds to the harshness, but at the end of the day, this is refreshing and enjoyable, great for an afternoon session."

"This is a robetussin clone, and they almost naked it, buy I prefer the real stuff."
""

""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer and I hope they don't wait 5 years or whatever, to make it again.  Whenever they do make it, I'll be a buyer."
""
"Fruity but with a heavy mouth feel..not smooth..good but not great"
""

""
"Pours a beautiful crimson red with a fluffy pink head. Absolutely stunning in appearance. Lovely smell from the glass. The taste is intense raspberry.  This would VD heaven on a hot summer day. I will seek out more of this gem."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like carbonated cough syrup. Or like the syrupy Lindemans Lambic. Not what I was hoping for."
""
""
"Low B-"
""
""
"Wonderful sweet raspberry beer. has enough effervescence to not make it to sweet though. Very enjoyable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This seem more like a champagne than a beer in the aromas and feel. It has a medicinal cough medicone aroma that turned me off at first, but. The raspberry character opened up as it warmed This would be a nice brew to drink on new Years or something. I definitely wouldn't gravitate towards it though since this isnt one of my go to style of beers. I can see the chicks really diggin it. Fun beer to try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste and smell are a bit artificial but delicious.  Mouthfeel is thin and a bit syrupy.  Overall a good tasting raspberry beer but needs more natural tartness to reach the next level.  There is a reason why most raspberry beers are sours.  Worth a try but spend your time and money seeking out the better raspberry sour beers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, fruit beers can be hit or miss, but this one takes that big fruity flavor that I always look for in the style, and it adds just enough complexity to make it just not a one note beer and in the end it makes for one tasty beer.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's smooth, slightly refreshing, the alcohol is hidden well , it's not too filling and the taste does a good job at holding my attention, I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, but I might attempt to drink a whole bottle.  What I like the most about this beer is that  it showcases the raspberry in all it's glory.  What I like the least about this beer is nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change.  I would buy this beer again if they release it again and I got a few bottles in the cellar to see how it changes over time.  I would recommend this beer especially if you like raspberry beers.  All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I though rubaes was pretty damn good, but this one just raised the bar another notch and Founder did everything right with this beer.  It's not a favorite founders beer, but it is my favorite non sour raspberry beer.  Great job guys, this is one awesome beer, keep it up."
""
""
""
"O: A beer for raspberry lovers. It's undoubtedly the highlight of the beer and never backs down. The Belgian yeast adds a nice complexity and depth while staying in the background. Highly drinkable despite the 9.2% and very enjoyable. Definitely worth looking into if you're into Belgians or raspberry focused anything"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very strong raspberry flavor, slightly tart"
""
""
""
"Aroma is medicinal and I get more cherry and cranberry than raspberry. Taste and mouthfeel are cloying with hints of cranberry juice on the flavor. Oily mouthfeel that coats the palette with flavors that I don't find to be particularly enjoyable. Quite disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost like a zinfandel wine..."
""

"I echo @VTR's sentiments almost exactly, except for the fact that I AM usually into most Belgian styles. This is a less intense raspberry framboise, something I would never think of enjoying straight up. 4 oz. pour more than does the trick."
""
"Had this on tap for the first time.  Poured a bright red in a pint glass.  Smell was pretty much straight up raspberries with maybe a little bit of yeast.  Great nose that let you know what you were going to be in for.  Taste was raspberry.  Great raspberry taste that was not overly sweet or medicinal.  It tasted pretty natural to me.  What I found interesting was that with the sweet nose and taste it ended pretty dry which made it a lot more enjoyable to me.  There was some carbonation almost fizzy like.  I was really impressed by this considering I am not a huge belgian fan.  I did not think the alcohol was hot rather I thought it was well masked.  I brought a growler of this that night.  It was a great beer to sip by the pool yesterday!  I will get this again and pair with some chocolate cake or something similar for a desert!"
""
"A beautiful beer (looks and taste). Easily one of if not my most favorite Belgian style beer. Truly a pleasure."
""
""
""
"This beer tastes like cough medicine. Don't understand it's high rating"
""
""
""
""
"Tastes very much like wine with a little beer fizz at the end.  After the syrupy mess that was Big Lushuous I was a little worried this would end up the same, and though while the raspberry is sweet it is natural & balanced."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"Never given a perfect score, and never thought it would be a fruit beer either. Just an absolutely incredible drink."
""
"I am not a big fan of flavored beers, but this one may change my mind. Other flavored beers I have had overdo the sweetness, making it hard to drink much. This one tones that down, making for something different.If you want something a bit out of the ordinary, give this a try."

"This is a very tasty fruit beer; great for a desert beer."
""
"Lots of raspberry.  Too much for my taste."
"My GF and I like mixing a framboise with Hoegaarden, this beer seems like it would be good for that.  Unfortunately, it's expense would indicate that's not what it's meant for."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, refreshing, not too sweet"
""
""
""
""
"I feel this could be so much more. It's delish, but for me the alcohol heat was distracting."
"Overall: A really great imperial fruit beer. It‚Äôs like Rubaeus on steroids. Huge taste of raspberries with a nice presence of Belgian yeast. It avoids becoming too sweet or boozy. I‚Äôm glad I got to try this after missing it in 2011. Going to age a few and see how it holds up."
""
""
""
"Very powerful flavor so take it slow"
""
"Overall, this beer doesn't disappoint after an almost 5 year hiatus. The raspberries are prominent and delicious, while the Belgian base ale makes its presence known as well. I cannot wait to see where this will go with age, if only I can manage to not drink my other bottles."
"EDIT: I just wanted to add that the lacing wasn't too impressive. Didn't stay for long or stick to the glass much at all."
""
""
""
""
"O- A good beer that I'm glad they brewed again as I missed it the first time but I have to say I don't find it all that much different than Rubaeus but it is twice as expensive. Yes the Belgian yeast adds a bit of depth to it but really not that much compared to regular.   It is much better than any of the cheap Belgian fruit wit beers I've had. My final thought on this is that it is a very good beer but not that much different than Rubaeus which is also a very good beer, and much cheaper and easier to get all summer."
""
""
"Not sure exactly what all the hype about this one is about.  Maybe the 2011 release was better.  I think I prefer the lightness of Rubaeus over this.  It's still decent for what it is."
""
""
"If raspberries are your thing, get this beer. A little one dimensional but tasty."
""
""
""
""
"A great fruit brew, reminds me of New Glarus in the same vein.  Very memorable.  I hope they make it every year."

"One of the best fruit/veg beers I have ever had. Excellent deep red color and intense raspberry flavor."
""
"The best beer I have tried thus far in 2015."
"O: Promising but for the price this bottle was a let-down. If that bitter note wasn't there and the fruit/wheat kept the stage I would be scoring this a lot higher. Without the bitter note it would go from very good to perfect if there was a bit of acidity to complement the sweetness"
"Outlier detected - for the price tag this beer should be amazing. It just awful. I hate Founders and this was the final straw. I will never spend another penny on their overhyped crap products."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Yes, this is awesome and worth the price. Looks like Founders made a large amount of it so I hope many get the chance to try it."

"While overpriced and missing that tart flavor to counter the sweetness, this beer is quite tasty and has a smooth and thick mouthfeel. To be enjoyed after dinner. Balance the sweetness a bit more and you've got an excellent fruit beer."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2/2015. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lightly tart raspberry, red grape, plum, apple, pepper, candi sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, raspberries, and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big tart raspberry, red grape, plum, apple, pepper, candi sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness and yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raspberry, red grape, plum, apple, pepper, candi sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, raspberries, and moderate malt sweetness; with an awesome sweetness/tartness/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible imperial Belgian fruit beer. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, raspberries, and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Pours ruby red with nice lacing half inch  head. Smell was sweet but not as distinct as I would have liked it. Taste is a sweet raspberry sorbet, nicely balanced without being overwhelmingly sweet. Notes of vanilla and tart crust. Would pair perfectly with vanilla bean ice cream. If you love raspberries,(which I do) this is an outstanding fruit beer"
""
"Deep Ruby color with a pink tinged head that shows moderate retention and lace. Huge sweet and tart berry aroma with a faint earthy yeasty Belgian edge to it. The flavor is quite sweet up front with some huge berry flavor but finishes quite dry with a lingering berry. Sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Light to moderate carbonation and a medium body. Its hard to find a beer in here. Overwhelming raspberry aroma color and flavor with a hint of Belgian yeastiness. Is this founders counter to New Glarus' Raspberry Tart? Tasty, sweet, syrupy very desert like!"
""
""
""
"I was excited but a little apprehensive about this ale after my disappointing experience with big lucious.  when I opened the bottle it smelled great..sweet just like raspberries.  It pours a beautiful ruby red with minimal head.  Then the first taste...light, delcious and full of real raspberry taste (unlike my lucious experience).  No crazy bitter after taste and was truly a delight for my tastebuds.  I would most definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a raspberry ale.  one thing I really like is that even though it's got a high abv (9.2%) it doesn't taste like it.  I thank my way 2 drunk friend for gifting this to me.  He got it right!"
"O- I would definitely choose to drink this over Rubaeus any day (I don't really like Rubaeus).  Pretty much met my expectations and is very good though I don't see where all the hype is coming from.  It's basically an imperial Framboise, which is nice but not really earth-shattering."
""
""
"Overall: Yes please. I want another bottle to age."
""
""
"6th of the evening. Imperial rubeaus sounds about right. Not getting the Belgian part very much, but more like a frambois than anything. Great and refreshing, looks like another Michigan favorite, Faygo Redpop."

"This is a tasty fruit drink, but I don't quite see why the hoopla surrounds it.  If you live in Wisconsin or border it, you have access to NG Raspberry tart for about half the cost of this one and it is superior in every way except for its alcohol content."
""
""
"I was hoping to taste more Belgian yeasty goodness.  This tasted almost only like raspberries to me with no complex flavors that i wanted to get in a belgian fruit beer.  Worth trying.   Wish i could've got a sample pour before spending 16$ on a bottle.   Probably won't buy again."
""
"For what it is, I guess it's alright. But damn. I really wish founders would just lay off the raspberries bc everything they make with rasoberries is just sickeningly sweet."
"I'm really glad I finally got to try this one. It's not the best raspberry beer I've ever had (what up, LPF and Raspberry Tart), but this still one of the most authentically fruit forward beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is easily liked if you like raspberries and crave chocolate like I do."
"Overall - Amazing beer. Strange that this is, in fact,  a beer. No sign of 9.2% abv anywhere. Very good. Met my expectations. Would recommend, highly."
""
"Not a fan, way too sweet, thick & syrupy, very much like children's cough medicine."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Founders describes this as imperial R√ºb√¶us and that basically hits the nail right on the head. Not super complex, but it's not supposed to be. It's a big ass raspberry beer and it's done well."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is a perfect dessert beer. I would take this over raspberry tart from new Glarus, and that is saying something. Interested to see how this ages, but that is just A curiosity. This is perfect now. Share it with people you love"

"Good beer, but way too sweet for my taste"
""
""
""
"Initial thoughts... A refined, more sophisticated Rubaeus.  Heavy raspberry flavor, but offers a better balance of fruit and yeast.  In the world of fruit ales, this is an absolute standout.  The alcohol is a bit heavy for the style and certainly creeps up on you quickly though."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is your perfect dessert beer.  The usage of raspberry is one of the truest, most genuine efforts we‚Äôve ever encountered.  Sweetness comes crushingly across the palate, wiping most other things away.  Do NOT expect anything sour or tart out of this guy, aside from the natural bite and pucker of the fruit itself.  The only thing that could catapult this to the next level would be if they would barrel aged it, or deepen it with a darker, more chocolatey malt bill.  That would be just craziness though, so ignore that.  It is superb as is, don‚Äôt get us wrong.  As a bit of commentary, we find it entertaining that we our only now getting to try the 2011 effort, as they ramp up to rerelease Blushing Monk next month, in March of 2015.  We should have waited to do a side-by-side, but something tells me the memory of this beer won‚Äôt soon fade from our minds."

"Possibly the best fruit beer I've had where the fruit is the sole star.  This beer is all about jammy raspberries.  It's not ""funky"" or ""sour.""  There's an inherent tartness because fresh raspberries are tart by nature.  I'd love to pair this with some vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Truly remarkable."

"As far as raspberry fruit beers go, this is a couple notches above Raspberry Tart. I thought Raspberry Tart was too sweet, but Blushing Monk is ridiculously fruity without that overwhelming sweetness of Raspberry Tart. Its basically a steroidal raspberry fruit beer and I would recommend to anyone who likes raspberries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has held up unbelievably well. I am very impressed and this certainly exceeded my expectations. Nothing at all like Rubaeus. This beer feels as authentically fruity as New Glarus' fruit beers do. Very much worth seeking out again."

"Trying a 2015 bottle now, and either my palate has changed or something is different here (likely the former). In any case, not as rich and decadent as I remember, and much more sweet and cloying syrup. Decent enough for a few ounces if you are in the mood for raspberries but beyond that it‚Äôs just a bit much. Pretty big score downgrade here..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, it's def plenty of awesome raspberry, a bit too sweet and syrupy but not overly, light stem seed like tannins and touch of bitterness, somehow drinkable despite the crazy syrupy sweetness, but tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an absolutely fantastic beer. Wish I could have tried this fresh so I had a point of comparison, but man was this delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This is very reminiscent of New Glarus' Raspberry Tart, but slightly less sweet (which is a good thing). There's not really much to the beer besides the raspberry flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste has great raspberry cordial type flavor with a slight malt sweetness and tanginess of fruit with slight sweetness and gently tart flavor in the finish with semi-sweet but not quite candy-like raspberry taste, very natural in intensity. Overall this is an excellent fruit beer with enough strength that is in the realm of some strong ales -the fruit seems to cloak the alcohol making this a drinkable deceptive beer"
""
"Founders never disappoints! Absolutely delicious. I'm glad I got to have this at a tasting because it is a very bold beer but my glass was amazing from start to finish."

"This is a full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. This amount of fruit craziness is what some might expect all fruit beers to be like but dare I say this reaches a bit beyond the spectrum of even feeling like a beer. Those who enjoy the likes of dessert beer or new glarus or selinsgrove fruit beers will probably go bonkers for this. A real panty dropper per se."

"Delicious beer that seems to hit a great stride around the year mark. Loads of fresh raspberries mixing with the malt to create a raspberry tart in a glass. Mildly acidic, bringing a pleasant tartness to help balance all the sweetness."
""
""
"Ultimately, drinking this beer is a bittersweet experience (literally and figuratively). Simply ... it's a wonder. Resplendent , multi-faceted, sweet, dense, slightly sour and impeccably executed. The problem is the looming/crushing doubt that I will ever get the chance to drink it again. I feel as though Sharon Van Etten's crushing ode Heart In The Ground would not be out of place, playing over the stereo as I joyfully and ruefully finish this glass. ""Can I live without you?"" seems like a nearly applicable sentiment."
""
""
""
"Overall: Compared to other raspberry hybrids, this is vastly different. Like a milky, lactic smoothie more than the refreshing, dry tartness. Maybe the Belgian influence though i didn't get it much in the flavor. Demarcates itself from the pack and very unique."
""
""
""
"This has a great raspberry flavor. It's a little too sweet for my preference, but it's hard to deny the quality that is put into this beverage."
"The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall this one is pretty fantastic. Real enjoyable."

"It's shocking how much I ended up loving this beer. One of the best fruit beers I've ever had. Thought it would be too sweet or too thick. Blushing Monk exceeds all expectations except mouthfeel, but even then, the lack of booze is all the more inviting."

"Raspberries. If one word reviews were allowed, that might be all I would say. I never give a 5 for appearance, but I have to give love to a beer that is movie scene blood-red. While pouring from the bottle, one gets a big nose of raspberries. The initial taste is raspberries. One really get the tart of the raspberries and can almost sense the skin of the fruit on your tongue. If I did not know it was a beer, I might have trouble recognizing it. There really are not many of the elements of beer present. There is not much carbonation or maltiness. One might get a hint of wheat. In this respect, It reminds me of the New Glarus Belgians. However, I still detect beer in the New Glarus line. The tart raspberry continues into the aftertaste. The beer is one-dimensional, but I still enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
"I thought I'd never get to try this again after blowing through the bottle I had. Glad this showed up at the festival. I'm not a particular fan of either Belgians ir fruity beer but this stuff is in a class all it's own. Well done, Founders!"
"It is my opinion that with time the malts will shine more making it a delightful brew, especially because I am fan of malty beers and raspberries, both. And although I remarked that it is rather syrupy and tough to drink at the moment, it still drinks very easy for its body and ABV."
"O - Overall this is incredibly outstanding. So, so so much raspberry. Its incredible just how much raspberry qualities they've crammed into this one."
""
"O. It isn't bad, I didn't think I would like it, but got it for my gf. the smell and taste are tart then sweet raspberries the whole time. I tried to find another scent or flavor but couldn't. for what it is, its great, but it would be hard to drink more then one bottle of this in a row. I will say it is better then some raspberry stouts and other flavored beer I have tried."
""
""
""
"Blushing Monk is amusing for three sips - anything beyond that is overkill."
""
""
""
""
"O - While it is a touch too sweet, it is nowhere near Lindeman's Framboise sweet, and is a very nice raspberry beer. Good on a hot day."

"Poured from 750ml 2011 vintage bottle into tulip glass. Pours a slightly viscous, deep blood red with a creamy, pink head. Nose is raspberries, raspberries, and raspberries along with some sweet tarts and strawberry funk. Flavor is again, all raspberries, very sweet, juicy, puckering sweet and tarty. Finishes medium bodied and only lightly sweet. Really enjoyed this fruit beer from Founders - have to say the appearance took me by surprise. Would've loved to do a side by side with Wisconsin's New Glarus Raspberry Tart even though I am not big on sours or fruit/vegetable beers (except pumpkin)."
""
"O - I really wanted to give this a 3.75, but I rounded up. It is a really nice beer. BUT, it is awfully sweet once you start drinking enough of it. I think splitting this bottle would have been a wise choice. The sweetness just got to me after a while, and I have quite the sweet tooth."
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: solid beer, but it was better when I had it on tap at Founders. I started off thinking that my glass was not enough, but the drinkability diminishes as I have more than 8 ounces. It's trite, but this is now a different beer as the raspberry diminishes. Still awesome."
""
""
"O - I'm glad I have one more bottle to enjoy with my sister-in-law for Easter 2012."
"4.5 overall is from ease of obtainment."
"O - an interesting beer. I was surprised as how easy it was to drink, and the unique aromas. but not something I would crave constantly especially at this price point."

"Body is medium/full, bigger than I expected, with good carbonation. Somewhat creamy, not too fizzy, feels just about right, with a bit of heft to it. Here's hoping they bring this one back again soon."
"O-an interesting and flavorful beer which I enjoyed for dessert, but would not drink much on a regular basis"
""

"This beer is a beautiful deep ruby color, slightly hazy, with little head. it smells and tastes like fresh raspberries. There is not much beer flavor here, but there is a fair bit of Belgian yeast that contributes an identifiable spicy ester and phenolic profile one gets from pale Belgian ales. The beer is very sweet (at least the perception of sweetness is there from the berries), but there is a nice tartness to balance it out. It has a fresher fruit taste than New Glarus Raspberry Tart, but I find it sweeter more aggressive than that beer, which I enjoy a bit more."
""

"O: I have to go with an A grade on this one. I can't believe that I am rating it that high, but for the style and the amount of clean flavor that I got...I really liked it. Backed the wife's review up."

"The only raspberry beer that I've encountered that tops this is New Glarus Raspberry Tart. However, this is a little hard to compare. It's very unique. It's very sweet, but it also has a nice malt profile."
""
"Blushing Monk looks, smells and tastes like pure raspberry syrup. It‚Äôs very sweet ‚Äî I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be able to drink the whole bottle by myself. Maybe I‚Äôll put the rest on some waffles or ice cream."
""
""
"Pours a gorgeous dark reddish-purple with a thin pink head. Smell is sugary raspberries with some Belgian yeast lurking in the background. The taste doesn't live up to my expectations however. The raspberry flavor is excellent, but it's a little too sweet, heavy and boozy for my taste. The more I drink the more I think it tastes more like a raspberry liqueur than a beer. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, heavier than I would have imagined and fairly sticky. It's a nice fruit beer, but I would prefer something a little lighter and not quite as sweet. Maybe drinking fruit lambic over the last few years has spoiled me, but this is so opposite of that style that my palate is somewhat jarred."

"Pours a goregous dark ruby color with a small purple pink head. Kinda looks like a weird red wine. This smells like raspberry candy and raspberry syrup. This tastes amazing! Tastes like sweet candy and rasperrby. Other dark fruity flavors are there too. Slightly drying but also sweet. Feel is lightly tingly. Yum. So drinkable."
""
""
""
"O - Such an amazing, crowd-pleasing beer that pairs phenomenally well with desserts. Founders should get rid of Cerise and add this to their full-time lineup!"
"I brought this beer and a bottle of champagne to a NYE party for mimosas. No one seemed interested. I thought it was a good idea."
"O: An amazing fruit beer. Hands down, this is the most raspberry forward beer I‚Äôve ever had."
"O: A good beer. Don't know if it's a Belgian Strong Pale or not but it's good."
""
""
""
"O: Darn good stuff from Founders, once again. A bit sweet initially, but I like the way that the sweetness gives way to a funky middle and tart, crisp, and dry finish. A really good beer overall. I will enjoy seeing how this ages."

"O: Great fruit beer. Might be the best one I've ever tried. It's not like fruit soda like some, and it's not like others where the fruit characteristics are buried."

"Morey's Bottom Line: I've been sitting on this for a while now, and decided that today was a good day to crack it open. Very rich and tart raspberry beer. Fun and unique. If you're looking for something different....this is your huckleberry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a vibrant red color with a pinkish, short livid head. Aroma of cherry, other assorted berries and Belgian yeast. In the taste, tart raspberry puree, cherry and cranberry juice elements. A mild tartness is noticeable. Alcohol is muted, tastes fruity, semi-sweet but very delicious. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, well carbonated. Overall, a tasty brew, almost like a lambic but not quite there, nor is it trying to be."
"An enjoyable brew, but not one I'd buy again."
"O: For a style that is growing on me this beer is definetely tops. This should be a must try on anyone's list who enjoy's or is looking to explore fruit beers."
""
""
""
"Dark blood red. Modest amount of pink head. No surprise it's full on raspberries here. Slightly tart and very earthy. Flavor is loaded with raspberry puree. Very vinous. As if they threw all the branches and leaves in the slurry. Dry finish. Mild carbonation. Not even in the same class as Raspberry tart."
""
""
""
""
"O) Enjoyed this start to finish. Obviously not for anyone who doesn't like raspberry, or fruit beer in general. This is outstanding for the style. I'd love it if Founders made this a yearly release."
""
""
"O - I don't have the heat to give this brew a poor rating just because it misses the style so poorly... This is without a doubt a fruit brew. Please don't be deceived. Not too much belgian going on with this brew. Highly recommended! I would be interesting to see what happens to this brew with a little age..."
""
""
""
"Blushing Monk is a damn good beer, I am very happy to see once again. Certainly not an every day drinker, this is one you want to keep on hand for a special occasion. The flavor is rich and decadent, certainly a sipper. Founders delivers far more than a simple fruit beer, even if you are not normally a fan of the style you owe it to yourself to try this one out."

"This beer pours a dark rose color with a thin white head. The aroma is very tart, like unripe rasberries. The taste is very fruity but with enough malt and carbonation that you still know that you're drinking beer. I didn't pick up much of a belgian yeast flavor or aroma. The mouthfeel was light and I definitely wouldn't have known this was a 9.2%abv beer if it didn't say so on the bottle. This was proably the most enjoyable fruit beer I've ever had, although for the price ($26 in Philly) I don't know if this is something I'd consistently purchase were it not a seasonal release."

"Overall: I was intrigued by this beer from the moment I heard about it, so I was thrilled that they decided to remake it and bottle it. At this point, in terms of raspberry beers it only comes short of the great raspberry sours in my mind."

"Pours a clear dark crimson with a 1 inch puffy light red head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random chunky streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. A very striking looking beer. Smell is of raspberries, raspberry juice, other berries, and some malt notes. Taste is of raspberries and other berries, berry juices, and a subtle malt flavor that ties everything together. Some tannin-like aspects in the flavors. This beer has a very wine-like mouthfeel with a coating quality in the mouth. The carbonation is nice and the beer is dry on the drink down. Overall, this is a good fruit beer with a nice raspberry/berry presence. I think the smell on this one is better than the taste though."
"(D)- A really solid fruit beer, though belgian strong pale ale?? It is heavy and sweet, but lots of great fruit in here. I look forward to revisiting it after a few years simply based upon how that small taste of the original bottling was like."
"O- As straight forward as this beer was, it was pretty damn tasty. Not as sweet as I was expecting, with some nice berry tartness at the end. My favorite fruit ale I've had to date."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy deep red color ale with a large foamy head with good carbonation and some good lacing. Aroma of freshly pressed raspberry with light sweet note is quite incredible and close to the New Glarus beers in terms of aroma. Taste is also a super good mix dominated by loads of pressed raspberry with light tart notes and a well balanced sweetness level. Malt backbone can be felt though doesn‚Äôt‚Äô play a huge role. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this much from a fruit beer and couldn‚Äôt understand the hype. I know do."
"Bottle. Popped open a bottle by my lonesome tonight as I really wanted to try this one and it sitting in my fridge was way too much a temptation on a friday night. Pours an extremely dark rosie, red color with a deep reddish pink head. Hmm, ever so slight belgian yeast esters upfront that then gets dominated by a hard core raspberry aroma. I have a feeling on this one that the taste is going to follow the nose. Raspberry, raspberry, and a touch of additional raspberry. Head settles to form a pink collar around the glass. As with the nose, their is a slight belgian flare to this that quickly transitions to a full frontal assault of raspberry flavor. Tart and sweet. Slight bitter in the end. Leaves the mouth feeling like it just ate something really sweet. Medium mouthfeel. I need to try this next to New Glarus Raspberry Tart to see which I like better, but this is really good as a sweet fruity beer."
"Overall: A very tasty raspberry beer. I think it could improve with time and that other flavors/aromas may come forward once the raspberry fades a bit."
"M - Medium body. Smooth. Light carbonation."
"Thumbs up - this easily gets my recommendation."
"D/O: Barely appearing as beer, the Blushing Monk channels REAL raspberry qualities in a deceptively strong package. Even among fruit beers it stands apart, allowing the fruit to take over instead of making a place for it amidst other beer characteristics. Still, it is compelling, drinkable, and a success."
"Mouthfeel: It love how this beer goes down for a belgian/lambic it isn't to tart to drink and everything about it screams freshness. This beer is just as good as its New Glarus cousins maybe better. Will do a side by side someday to see if I am right."
"Excellent beer. I hate to pick nits, especially after having done it real life, but I'd take either of the New Glarus beers over this. Lower alcohol, more depth, better tasting. But now I'm just whining, because, well, yummy."
"O: This is an amazingly jammy, one-dimensional fruit beer, and nothing more."
"O- I think this had lived up to the hype, it takes a lot of work to keep the fresh taste and not let it get to ""preserve"" tasting."
"A flavorful fruit beer. This is not a Belgian pale by any stretch of the imagination."
"A nice fruit beer, very real, not that fake fruit extract that is typically found in most fruit beers."
"Nice, sweet, dessert beer to share."
"I was really disappointed in this beer. It was glowingly sweet and the fruit flavor was overpowering. The mouthfeel was syrupy and I just could not enjoy it at all. There was little to no head on this beer and the carbonation was severely lacking. I'm not sure what the hype is about. I like Founders but this one was a miss."
"O: This is a great beer! I am not one usually into fruit beers but this is one I would go to great lengths for!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. I recommend sharing a big bottle with friends as a dessert."
"O - very good to drink with the wife. It's sweet but not too sweet."
"Overall: I liked it a lot but I'm not sure if I could drink an entire bottle by myself. I did enjoy the fact that it was more tart and sour then sweet."
"Thanks to jdiddy for pulling this out of the cellar. 750ml bottle served in a chalice. 2006 vintage. Pours a brilliant, translucent claret hue with no head. Big raspberry aromas, as well as a slight, earthy character. I cannot express how much raspberry you get off the nose. Taste is fantastic - raspberry dominates, but there's also an easy, pleasant tartness, some acidity and a slightly medicinal quality. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a crisp carbonation. This is an amazing and dangerously drinkable beer (the earlier vintage weighed in at 12.6%). Having tried the 2011 vintage immediately following, I have to say that age has done some wonderful things to this brew. If you can pick up a couple bottles, definitely cellar one for several years."
"A delicious raspberry ale that truly allows the authentic, fresh, and vibrant flavor of the fruit to shine through. Quite tremendous!"
"When it's cold straight from the tap it's a bit prickly in the mouth and a little overbearing in flavor. As it warms a bit everything tends to mellow out and it's quite enjoyable. I was a bit skeptical that this would be too sweet but I was pleasantly surprised. Not too sweet at all. Not something I'd want to drink everyday but overall a good beer."
"This brew poured out looking like carbonated blood, a really nice looking ruby red brew with a pink colored creamy looking head. No lacing but has some light retention. The smell is of fresh raspberries and more raspberries. The taste is sweet and lightly tart with again with plenty of raspberries. The mouthfeel is smooth, and slick. Overall this brew is a lot like most Framboise brews, very sweet and has a long lasting aftertaste. Definitely somethingto sip and enjoy over a long period of time. Very happy to have tried it finally."
"Pours a deep purple sort of like a red wine color with a one finger pinkish purple head. The head recedes to skim and leaves gobs of lacing up and down the glass. The aroma has the scent of raspberries with a hint of grassiness. The taste starts out with a sweet raspberry taste and then midway through switches to a raspberry tartiness with a hint of booze. The beer was very sweet in nature. The mouthfeel was cabonated and silky. Overall an excellent beer very good taste look and aroma. A very easy drink despite decent abv."
"O: Nice treat, and an interesting beer. Is a great beer to have in a bottle share, since it's so unique, and very tasty. Waited to post this due to the first bottle had some leakage in transit for the trade, and was therefore pretty flat (no fault of the brewer) Still got a lot of the flavors that way, but man the carbonated version was SOOO much better. Less sweet, more tart, creamy, fluffy, and fruits notes were delicious."
"O: Well done. The abv is really well hidden. Good drinkability, but I wouldn't want a lot of it."
"Although this was a last minute trade, I'm happy I tried it. It's quite tasty and not just another gushy fruit beer. I can't be sure how much was paid for this beer, but anything around $12 would be reasonable. I do wish that more of the Belgian characteristics same through, a yeast fruitiness would have played nicely off the raspberries."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this beer is like an adult soda. I could probably down the entire 750 mL. in 15 minutes with a straw if I were really so inclined. The body is a little thick with an almost syrupy quality to it, but is not sticky or difficult to swallow. The carbonation is slightly fizzy but is obviously helping to prevent the body from congealing. Overall, this beer has a very slick mouthfeel and it just slides over your tongue and down your throat."
"And once again, Founders makes one hell of a beer."
"Pours a wine-like deep ruby with some dark pink foam that disappears rather quickly to a ring and some large bubbles. Smells vegetal and loads of raspberries. Taste is again loads of raspberries and some cherry with a pleasant, moderate tartness. Thickens the saliva, full bodied and thick with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is pretty good but suffers a little on the drinkability due to the heavy dose of raspberry and the syrupy body. That being said, I generally find fruit beers (like the NG ones) to be drinkable only in very small doses."
"I was so excited to try this beer. I have always loved lambic- fruit style beers. First off the beer pours a deep red, as expected a quickly - disappearing pink head. It was a bit more sour than i expected in taste both on draft and in bottle. Still a great beer worthy of the founders label. I would say its very close to the ras tart from new glaris, but with a heavier mouthfeel and overall weight. I would however rather have a new glaris belg red over either one of these beers."
"I look forward to pulling another one out of the cellar around the holidays to see how this one continues to evolve."
"O: One word, Unique. I liked it, not a beer I would have often, but once or twice a year would be great. I just love how beers continue to transform and I hope that never stops."
"I do think Blushing Monk is going to age nicely. I expect the tartness will fade somewhat and the hops will die, turning this into an even sweeter, dessert like beer. Now I just have to find some bottles for the cellar..."
"O: Just pure concentrated fruit, and definitely the best fruit beer I‚Äôve ever had (better even than NG beers). Thanks again Jay, I would love to drink another bottle of this."
"A very good fruit beer, but I would have liked it better if there was just a touch more tartness. I'll choose NG Raspberry Tart over this."
"Pours a deep, dark blood red with a massive dark pink, frothy head. Nice retention and light clumps of lacing. Aroma is pure, sugary natural cranberry and raspberry puree fruit. Flavor is straight, tart raspberry puree, not as sweet as the aroma (which was probably picking up some of the belgian yeast which is overpowered here). Slightly drying in the finish, medium thick body with low carbonation. It is what it is; raspberry puree with light alcohol presence."
"Overall, this is a top notch fruit beer, even though I am typically not a fan of how sweet fruit beers are. Hopefully Founders will bottle this one again."
"Cracked this with pixieskid yesterday toward the end of a night of many many beers. It is a very dark red beer with a cap of pinkish off white head. The aroma was huge on the raspberries with a mild belgian yeast aroma, but the raspberries were the big star here. With the flavor as well, there was a lot of raspberry with a bit of belgian character. This beer is to raspberries what cerise wishes it could be to cherries. Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I would have liked which maybe leaves it a bit sweet toward the end of the bottle. Overall this beer is outstanding. Definitely wish I had been able to pick more up."
"Six-ounce pour into a flute glass. A lush ruby-colored beer with a thick magenta head, that receded to a thin layer, leaving some nice lacing behind. Aroma thick with raspberries, like Lindeman's Framboise times five, at least. Juicy sweet taste, raspberries aplenty--you can almost feel the grit of the seeds between your teeth--tart sensations on the tongue, grassy, with subtle hints to the malt and yeast at play in the distant background. Medium-bodied and very drinkable for a fruit beer. Founders is definitely my go-to brewer if I'm in the rare mood for a raspberry or cherry (see: Cerise) beer."
"This is a great fruit beer. It tastes of natural raspberries. It is pretty easy to drink and is very flavorful. A great example of what a fruit beer should be."
"O ‚Äì Delicious with a raw, natural raspberry flavor."
"O: I'm not always the biggest fan of beers like this, but it isn't quite as cloying as some others."
"Overall - So this is a tough beer to review. It's unique. I opened this with my wife thinking she'd enjoy it. She took one sip and said ""No thanks."" I'm stuck with the whole bottle, hence why I don't think it's easy to drink. And why exactly is this a Belgian Strong Pale Ale? How is this not a fruit beer?"
"Had on draft at Capone's in a 5 oz. snifter. Pours a luscious wine red. No head to speak of. This wreaks of raspberries in a good way. The taste is very complex. Sweet, yet tart...this is all raspberry all the time. 5 oz. is the perfect serving size for this. Definitely a sipper, I find myself involuntarily preventing this from rolling over the tip of my tongue. Oh yeah. It's sour. Considering this type of beer isn't really my bag, I'm enjoying this. Would have again."
"O - Good flavors, just so, so sweet."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Creamy with a fine, modest carbonation. I would recommend this one again and again."
"O: really nice beer. A little sweeter than I prefer, but this beer has it's place and it is exceptional in it's place. Great for a warm summer evening."
"Taste-Full-on rasperries, tart, subtle Belgian spiciness. Almost like a glass of fortified wine or a Raspberry Lambic. That being said, this is a very refreshing and drinkable brew that hides the high(9.2)ABV. very well. If there are any hops to speak of in this Belgian Strong Pale Ale, they are effectively drowned out by the intense raspberry flavor. The Blushing Monk would make an outstanding dessert beer, either on its own or with anything sweet."
"This is pretty bad. The fruit flavor seems very artificial to me. To much like childerens cough syrup. I love Founders, but this is crap. Not something I would recommend."
"An excellent fruit beer, so fruity as to make you question how much beer is here, and how much of this is simply a variation on very well-done raspberry wine. I'm so glad to have had the opportunity to try this one, and am looking forward to grabbing more of Founders' backstage series one-off releases this year."
"A very flavorful fruit beer. Maybe too much fruit for a beer, since it dominates everything."
"O: Phenomenal beer. I can see why this is only a limited release though, they had to use every raspberry in the midwest!"
"D: This was like an oud bruin with tons of raspberries added to the barrel. Fantastic! The scent and taste and body were all great, with well hidden alcohol so it was easy to drink. I guess the original batch was 12.3%, but the bottle here claims 9.2%. Either way, it drank like 6%. Not sure how it'll age, but it was great fresh. Recommended."
"I think I got my raspberry fix for awhile. The berry is put on display and not much else gets in the way of the berry."
"Drink- Not sludgy, but not super light either. Bold and in your face. This was a nice bottle. It was as I mentioned a sipper beer and fun to sit and watch flavors melt together and mold as it warmed a little."
"Overall, I have enjoyed this beer. Not one that I could drink everyday but am definitely glad that I was able to try it and look forward to having my other bottle in the spring maybe(?)"
"O- Some people will dislike this beer but mostly the sour fiends but this will appeal very much to the chicks and with that higher ABV will help out some of us homely beer geeks get lucky WOOT!"
"very nice raspberry colored red with a small pink colored head and very nice carbonation visible throughout the session. The smell was rich with raspberry essence. Extremely strong so that nothing else could possibly come through. Now the flavor was to die for. I have never been the biggest fan of fruit beers in general, but this has just come to a whole new level. So sweet yet tart and sour at the same time, the flavor was so strong, yet not overpowering and not too sweet as to make you sick, it was in a word, perfect. It had the most perfect taste for this style I could have ever imagined. A great light body and great carbonation made it feel like water and there was just no hint of any kind of alcohol in this. This was by far one of the best brews I have ever had."
"O: Yum. 4"
"Overall Impression- I've had this one in Bottle, and have to say it is even better on tap! It was creamier and fresher tasting on-tap. While I still am a huge fan of this brew, I am still looking forward to the Canadian Breakfast Stout coming out in October! Keep it up Founders!"
"O - Super flavorful, very well balanced raspberry brew. TONS of raspberry flavor but shy of a lambic. Still keeps it's beer body."
"This beer was certainly a treat to try however for me a single glass was enough, in fact too much. It's very sweet and tart, as one would expect but the flavors are very well done and not overbearing to the point where it's off-putting. If you like red fruits, namely raspberries, this is certainly one beer you absolutely must try. Similar brews; Lindemans Framboise"
"O: Overall a very tasty treat. Perhaps better suited for a dessert beer, or on top of vanilla ice cream. Still very good with an abundance of raspberry flavor."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. I'm glad I got the chance to try it. The alcohol is well hidden and could get somebody in alot of trouble and could serve very well pairing with a fruity cheesecake or other berry dessert."
"Wow...what a surprise. Thanks to my friend that brought it over, with 7 Ribeye Steaks. This beer poured into my Great Lakes pilsener glass Blood Red with a pink carbonated head. Some light lacing down to the bottom. Aromas of huge fresh raspberries, and a bit of Belgian yeast. Very strong sweetness on the nose. Taste is Thick and syrupy but not as sweet as you would expect, a nice balanced tartness. Some notes of tart raspberries linger on the finish for a bit with some spiciness from the yeast. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish. Hidden very well....12.3%, who would have thunk it. What a treat."
"Pours a dark red with a hot pink head looks crazy. Smells strongly of raspberries. Taste is sublime...big raspberry sweetness up front with just the right amount of tart. Carbonation is slightly higher than let's say a lambic but not huge. Very drinkable, my mother hates beer all together but loved this. She still doesn't believe its a beer. Overall amazing beer."
"A dessert beer for sure. Beautiful raspberry flavor but it is one dimensional."
"Overall: While Blushing Monk isn't very complex, it is the oppitome of fresh. I can't imagine drinking this or any fruit / vegetable beer all the time, but I really enjoyed this brew."
"Medium mouthfeel and no real notice of the alcohol. This year's version says 9.2% abv, not over 12 as in past years. Superb brew, once again from Founders. They rarely disappoint."
"Overall: Although I might have preferred a bit more tartness or yeasty funk, this is still a very nice example of what can be done with a fruit beer"
"I split this bottle with the girlfriend. Not sure if I could finish a whole one myself, but we both enjoyed 1/2."
"Blushing Monk pours an impossibly deep plum. It's almost solid when held to light, with only very faint ruby highlights shining through. The first pour yielded barely two fingers of foam, while the second pour manages to churn up a full three fingers worth. Retention is alright, and there's a fair amount of lacing, but the color of the head is what really grabs attention. It's the offspring of lavender and a dark pink/light red shade, and it's much more vivid than the head from any other fruit beer I've ever seen. The nose is quite potent, and it screams raspberries, with just a little bit of sugary sweetness present as well. The flavor is just as one note as the aroma, and it really gets old as I make my way through the bottle. The flavor is exclusively of sugared up raspberries, and people referring to to the beer as alcoholic raspberry soda aren't off base at all. The body is a little flabby, especially for a Belgian brew, but the sparkling carbonation is perfectly suited to the beer. This is one that would be much better served by a smaller serving size, as the all out raspberry assault quickly gets old."
"This is an extremely interesting and, in many ways, excellent beer. The raspberry character is fantastic and dominates the flavor and aroma. It's almost a little too much, in fact; a little more ""beer"" character might be nice, although the Belgian yeast helped with that. The sweetness also could be a bit much at times, so I would recommend this as a dessert beer. Also, although it hides the alcohol well, this is a strong beer and best split between two (or more) people. All quibbles aside, though, it's very nice and a good bet for a special occasion or change-of-pace beer. Recommended."
"Pours a pretty maroon-red color with nice purplish-pink head on top. Nose is not as overly sweet as some describe, but a blast of tart, fresh raspberries hits. With more exploration some of the malt comes through with a bit of alcohol, but really this is just a fruit bomb. Flavor is quite good, not cloyingly sweet, but sweet nonetheless. Just robust fruit flavor here, like fresh raspberries. Somehow it is balanced out so as to not be overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium, not too heavy and sticky, but not too light like a champagne or something. Moderate to full carbonation helps to keep this one from becoming too sticky. Overall, I like this beer, but I don't think I would want more than one. It's good, and a damn fine fruit beer, but not a beer that I'm going nuts for."
"O - This has really good drinkability. Even though it has a pretty heavy body and high alcohol, it drinks just like juice. Juice with more complexity mind you. I am really enjoying the flavor of this. It's hard to put down. I think this is a really well crafted fruit beer. I recommend trying it. I would definitely buy this one again."
"I have to say, it's good, but not something i'd buy a bunch of, it's honestly too much like juice for me. So since i think it is about average, i will give it a C-ish score."
"Overall I'm glad that I got my hands on a bottle and I hope to get my hands on one more. I look forward to what Founders has in store for its 750ml bottles and I hope in the future this one gets brewed again."
"O: I was not expecting to like this as much as I did, having tried Founders Cerise before. This blew away my preconceived notion of what Founders can do. A great finish to a decent weekend. Hooray for pleasant surprises!"
"O: I think this would be more interesting if it was fermented with brett and other wild yeasts."
"Sickeningly sweet followed by a god awful throat/chest burn. Gee can I buy some more of this? Worst beer I've had from Founders hands down."
"Yes, my overall score exceeds most of the rest of the scores. This beer is 9.2% ABV (the one listed above must be from the previous batches) and I've had difficulty not gulping this beer down...I like it that much. If this had been touted by the brewery as simply a fruit beer than this may have been much higher, but claiming it is ""Belgian style"" invokes thoughts of fruit-flavored lambics and this doesn't compare. Still, I do love this beer and will be eagerly seeking its next release."
"Overall: Not a very complex beer, but it is unique and worth a try. I can see chicks really diggn this beer because its sooo fruity. Founders delivers another fantastic beer. Must try it out if you get a chance!"
"Definitely not your average fruit beer. Found this refreshing despite ABV being on the higher side. Alcohol is not even noticeable. Reminds me of a sparkling fruit juice more so than a beer."
"Pours a deep, blood red with about an inch or so of bubbly, purple head. The body looks nearly black in the glass, but retains an ominous red glow when held to the light. It looks absolutely stunning. Smells, as one might suspect, of raspberries; crisp, refreshing raspberries - without the artificial sugar scent - dominate the nose, but some yeasty, belgian-like scents escape the depths and are vaguely noticeable. Taste is very similar, being primarily of fresh raspberries, so much that it reminds me of homemade raspberry jam. It is slightly sugary in the mouth, but the carbonation helps it from being overly-so; it also seems to bring out the tiny bit of belgian pale character that lies beneath the surface, as some yeasty notes can be found rather readily after the raspberry punch subsides. A small amount of warming alcohol lives at the end. The carbonation is great, and helps the beer finish slightly dry instead of sticky/sugary. Overall, this is the best fruit beer I have ever had, and I feel fortunate to have been able to try it."
"O: I'm reluctant to give any beer an overall 5 rating, but if there was ever a beer that I would give such a rating to, this would be my pick. I completely understand if some people really don't like fruit beer, but I do, and this one is the best I've ever had. Thank you Founders for taking such pride in your work."
"A big, strong, malty fruit beer, unlike any I've had before. It's like a cross between a typical low-ABV fruit beer and a barleywine. Quite tasty, and hard to believe it's as strong as it is."
"I'm torn on this beer. At times it can be a great, sweet rush of raspberry juiciness. At others it's a sickly sweet mouth full of carbonated raspberry juice. There isn't much depth or complexity to it. No sign of the Belgian yeast and none of the ABV shows it's face at all. Probably best enjoyed in small samples rather than full pours."
"I really was happy to be able to get a bottle of this to try. Everyone agreed though that the pour they had was enough. It's very sweet and tart, although quite flavorful. It just may be a bit too over the top for some. You've been warned."
"On tap at Founders Brewing. Dark purple-red pour with very pink foam. Aroma of pure raspberry, seeds and all. Taste is sweet, with only a slight ""natural"" tartness from the raspberries and finishes with a slight touch of belgian ale yeastiness as though to make sure the sweet fruity flavors don‚Äôt go on forever. Palate has medium carbonation and is quite full bodied. I never thought I would like this beer so much, it was our favorite of the night @ Founders."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. The alcohol was well hidden, and the flavor wasn't artificial at all. I would definitely have another if I get the chance."
"Notes: I wasn't expecting the sourness, but it turned out to be a welcome addition. One of the best fruit beers on the market. A tad one-dimensional maybe, and not very complex, but I love it for what it is. Comparable in some ways to Troegs Mad Elf, though I like this better."
"An onslaught of real raspberry flavor that seems never ending. Something I wish more brewers would do, but I think they are deterred from fruit beers because the category is sort of a guilty pleasure among most serious beer drinkers. A very unique beer to say the least, glad I tried it."
"O: Huge and massive fruit at every turn. An exercise is excess that is fun to try, but not likely something I'm going to be wanting on a regular basis. It receives my recommendation but isn't one I'll be stocking up on. 4/5"
"NOTE: While this could totally stand alone as a dessert, I highly recommend tasting this with the highest grade dark chocolate that you can get your hands on."
"Pours a deep red witha pink head. In the aroma, a small dry presence of fruit. In the taste, quite fruity, especially raspberry, with a dry texture to a small sweetness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel with a small dry fruity raspberry like aftertaste. Still quite fruity, but hides the alcohol, and not overbearing at all."
"Vintage 2011. Figured since I was seeing a few friends for the first time in a while, I'd bust out a bottle o' something nice. Here goes. It pours a deep, dark ruby topped by plenty o' relatively short-lived dark pink foam. The nose comprises rich raspberry, light black cherry, and red grapes. Damn, now that's a lot o' raspberry, fella! The taste holds notes of straight raspberry (as though you're biting into a bunch o' fresh ones), very light cherry, cranberry, and currant. A light tartness pervades, but doesn't get very strong at any point. At some point, the cranberries seem to take over. I never thought I'd say this, but there might be too much berry-ness in here... The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, I get that this is supposed to be a berry bomb, but I think they went too far this time. There is no semblance of any base beer, or of any Belgian character, for that matter. Just berries, berries, and more berries. I thought I liked berries, but this was nearly too much for my own good. Nearly..."
"Overall pretty good. It isnt something you can drink everyday but a nice after dinner / dessert beer for sure."
"Overall, this was way more over the top raspberry than I expected. ¬†It's a sipper because of the combination of alcohol and tartness. ¬†That being said, raspberries are one of my favorite fruits so I'm enjoying the hell out of this."
"-GFunk"
"O - Overall, this is yet another excellent one from Founders. Even better than Raspberry Tart IMO."
"Smell is raspberries, raspberries, raspberries with darker fruits just below naming: dark hints of plum and fig. Citrus hints. Smells sweeter than it tastes. Taste wraps the tongue and throat in rich fresh-crushed raspberry cider. Not too sweet (thankfully) and ends drying and astringent, begging for another sip. Grownup fruit juice. Marvelous. Fantastic. Thank you."
"O: very unique style and very well made. I highly suggest sharing this beer with friends and family as it is a great experience even for novices. Certainly a very memorable Belgian. Enjoy."
"O - This is a great tasting raspberry ale. It was worth the price."
"O-had one from 2007 that was better. can you imagine that. better? Anyways. buy 2. one for now and one for later!"
"O: Brewers of the world: the fruit beer bar has just been raised. Once again, Founders has given the beer community something that is lovable, intriguing, exciting, and just plain unforgettable. It‚Äôs beer like this that make me want to take the trip to Grand Rapids just for the Founders Taproom. Mark my words, I'll be there by year's end..."
"O- this is different, i have 4( well 3 ) bottles i shall be getting used to this style in time."
"Bright reddish purple pour, looks like red wine or grape juice. Short lived pink head that leaves filmy lace when swirled. Certainly a nice looking beer. Very sweet - Lindeman sweet - aroma. Very pungent and full. You just know this is going to be sticky... And it is. I am drinking jam here. So very sweet and clinging. I wish did have some tartness to round things out, but this is not that kind of beer. This is a dessert beer of Creme Brulee proportions. Drinking a bomber of this was too much. I could not cut it. I was not worthy. I capped it, and finished it the next day with a turkey sandwich. The alcohol is very well hidden, but you will not be able to drink enough of it in one evening for that to matter. Meant to be shared? Most def."
"As a big fan of Founders, Belgian styles and raspberry-flavored beers, I opened this with much anticipation. I really wanted to like this beer, but, in the end, just could not fully appreciate it. Poured a deep purple, like grape juice, with a tight, bright pink head. First sip was pronounced raspberry, almost cloyingly sweet at first, and then rapidly shifting gear to moderate tartness. Belgian character of beer was largely overshadowed by the fruit flavor, with candy sugar being the most noteworthy contribution. The fruit flavor was simply overwhelming - the sort where a little bit goes a long way. Perhaps as an after dinner digestif this would be good, but no quaffer here."
"How does Founders do it? They make unbelievable stouts, ipas, and dipas, how do they also do such a solid job with a fruit beer. Probably the best fruit beer I've had to date that isn't a lambic. Truly a tasty treat that didn't grow tiresome for me at all. Glad I have a few more in the cellar."
"Overall: This beer will change your view on fruit beers forever. No hint of the alcohol, just raspberry. This bomber though is meant to be shared. A whole bottle would be too much."
"Medium, richly smooth bodied with a lightish amount of carbonation, the brew glides down to the gullet without a hitch and where, I ask you, where is the +9% alcohol?? No sign of it in the taste and I reckon there's not much evidence of it after the swallow either. Great brew!"
"O- I'm not digging this one at all. Tastes more like a wine cooler than a beer, but to each their own."
"CHEERS"
"O: A really good fruit beer, but that's kind of like a really good meeting with your boss -- you'd rather have done something else but you're glad it was pretty good, but it would always be hard to say it was a wonderful experience."
"D - this is good, but taking down a 750ml of this was more daunting of a task than anticipated. That being said, I really enjoyed it and an 8oz pour would have been perfect. Over time, the sweetness and sugar got to me. I really enjoyed this and is a nice change of pace for a Founders offering,"
"Overall this is by far the best fruit beer I have ever had, period. Its strong in the beer department which is key and doesn't taste like sweet fruit juice which is a big complaint of many fruit beers. The fruit tastes fresh/authentic as well, compared to some which taste like artificial from extract. Really outstanding beer."
" Overall Founders proves again why they are my favorite brewery. I really enjoyed this beer but I have to say my 8 oz pour was just enough,I don't know if I could of drank much more.Best to share this one."
"Medium bodied, sweet, tart, low to medium carbonation, and easy to drink for a 9.2% abv beer. Very glad I picked this up, and that I have more bottles to drink for later."
"Well done, but that is what you expect from the folks at Founders. All around great beer that I wish was offered ""all around"" the calander."
"I've not had much experience with fruit beers but I can easily imagine how this style can fail in execution. From this perspective I think this beer is quite the success. I don't think I'd go out of my way to have this again as it's not a preferred style but I'm certainly glad I had a chance to try it."
"O - Some friends had the previous version of this and raved about it, and I'm really happy to have had the newest batch. That said, after this, I find myself longing for the subtle complexity of Kasteel Rouge. Think a higher ABV like the original version would help this beer a good deal. Still a huge Founders fan, and I'll happily try all the Backstage series beers."
"Notes: This is the first time I'm saying this (and maybe the last time) - this tastes more like a fruit wine than beer. It really tastes to me like they fermented out raspberry juice with champagne yeast. Lovely, delicious, refreshing and jammy. Don't get any semblance of Belgian yeast or ""beer"" flavors."
"O - A very solid fruit beer and one of the more interesting. The yeast adds a complexity that usually lacks from straightforward fruit beers. I enjoyed the refreshing quality that the fruit brought, but also the almost fruit stout feel brought on by just how many raspberries were in this."
"O - A great brew. With delicious raspberry flavor and good alcohol content."
"Another amazing beer from Founders and worth trying."
"It‚Äôs great after one but more would be overbearing."
"This brew is perfectly balanced. It has a quick decay as well."
"O - A very, very good fruit beer. I think this is a close second on my list of favorite raspberry beers behind New Glarus Raspberry Tart which is practically flawless. Glad I was able to obtain one of these...and it does hold up to the hype/demand pretty well...I have no regrets for the $18 I spent on this bottle, but after having this, I know that for half the price and a little bit of effort setting up a trade I can get all the Raspberry Tart I want and be even happier."
"This beer pours a full bodied dark red, reminiscent of a framboise, with a two finger, Valentine's Day pink head. It smells of Belgian yeast and sweet and tart raspberry puree. The raspberry is overpowering and delicious. It tastes of sweet raspberries, first and foremost, with a moderate tartness and a Belgian yeast finish. It offers complexity in terms of raspberry, offering every aspect of the fruit, but the beer itself is dominated by the raspberry. It is delicious and is like an imperial framboise. It drinks full in body and really is a big beer. I couldn't be more pleased with it. It's an exceptional beer and one of my all-time favorites. I can't wait to open an '07 in the following months!"
"O: I liked this a lot, but it is a bit too simple. At first I was really stoked on this beer, but after a bit I was pretty numbed by the overwhelming hand of raspberries. Half the glass and my palate was numbed, I wasn't pulling anything else of this glass at that point. Normally it's the alcohol that's numbing, but in this case it was the ingredients. That said, if you are a raspberry freak; then my friend, the eagle has landed. Outrageous raspberry fruit beer, but I would have liked some more complexity. An accomplishment in solid execution with an ingredient, but two-tones of complexity at best."
"O: This beer is damn delicious. On deliciousness alone this thing would get an A+. However, I would like to see this beer calmed down just a bit, with a lighter mouthfeel, a little more tartness instead of sweetness and fewer raspberries. Point is, they may have overdone it a bit on the huge raspberry sweetness. Still love it, but to be a truly perfected, A+ beer, this thing will take some tweaking."
"O: Thicker than a regular fruit beer with way more alcohol, but not in a bad way. This is a really good beer and one I would have again. Skal."
"O: This is a sipper and the bottle should definitely be shared. Served alone or possibly with cheesecake this beer would make a wonderful desert. Solid take on the style, but not my favorite."
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and I think it's worth the $15 price of admission. However, my wife raved about the brew, labeling it ""one of the best beers"" she's ever had. Well done, Founders."
"O: I had NG Raspberry Tart last night and I must say that I enjoy this brew much, much more. I'm not getting any of the medicinal notes I picked up with the NG beer. Fruit beers are growing on me and this is another awesome example."
"A wonderful beer to enjoy with friends on a wonderful day. It is a bit pricey for the style & I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer. I was curious to see what would develop from this style of beer, however Founders has found a way to make a positive contribution to fruit/vegetable beers."
"much lighter bodied and very easily drinkable for the high ABV, i just wanted to keep gulping it down, i believe our bottle was somewhere around 9%, perhaps the latest version? not sure."
"Overall: A very nice fruit beer. Sweet and sugary, but the fruit profile is undeniably excellent. I'm looking forward to trying to the 2007 version soon to see how it compares. The sweetness limits the drinkability, so you I wouldn't recommend opening this alone. This would be good on french toast."
"I found this brew to be a pretty darn good fruit beer and appreciated its balance of sweet to dry. It was full of fresh berry flavors but just a bit too sweet and fruity to be something I would drink a lot of. Interestingly, my wife who really likes sweet fruit lambics found this beer to be too dry. Go figure."
"O - Good Lambic-style Belgian ale by Founders. Very intense fruit beer worth trying, but it lacks some desired complexity."
"Overall , Founders did a great job with this fruit beer. The alcohol is very well hidden. Only problem is I could only get one bottle!"
"Reminds me a lot of new glarus raspberry tart."
"O - Pleasantly not what I was expecting. Loads and loads of raspberry flavor. If anything, I'd say I wish I had someone to share the bottle with. Over the length of imbibing, the sweetness seemed to get stronger."
"O: There has been a lot of hype over this beer. Is it worth the high price tag? My opinion: Yes, but just barely. Maybe not even that. It's a fruit beer that doesn't suck, and a lot of fruit beers do suck, so it has that going for it. And it's as drinkable as you could ask for for a beer approaching 10% abv. But it isn't stellar, it feels like it's missing a little bit of body or substance."
"Am amazing beer. Not much could be improved"
"O- Fantastic beer, but too sweet to drink often. Perfect as an interesting dessert option. Considering it as such, its stellar within its style."
"This is a stellar fruit beer. If all fruit beers were like this one, it would be my favorite style. I just cannot find a complaint about it. My wife even had the idea to make a beer float with it and a scoop of black raspberry chip icream. AMAZING!"
"Overall, the main thing that I noticed different about this beer was that I couldn't pick out the alcohol. I guess the small drop made a difference. A really solid beer."
"O - Very nice raspberry...drink? Its hard to call it a beer, but its still really refreshing. Made for a nice 50th review on an ""excessive heat warning"" day."
"Well, I almost passed on this one, but my wife convinced me to try it (I had to then split it with her). Pours a very dark purple, almost black, into my tulip glass. Interesting, dark pink head(never seen that one before). Smells strongly of sweet fruit, like rasberry (duh) or strawberry. Tastes a bit like a wine cooler (not that I've ever had one!), but something holds the fruit back from overpowering. Part of that must be the mouthfeel, which is a little thicker and less carbonated that a wine cooler. Geez, the alcohol is well hidden. This is not my favorite style of beer, but it is tasty and refreshing on this extremely hot day (meanwhile, I'm sitting in A/C)."
"Lighter body, with a decent amount of carbonation that gives a fuller feel. Some alcohol present, but blends in well. This is an amazing fruit beer. This is all about the raspberries. Maybe the Belgian yeast adds that earthy note. Not sweet, but also not sour. Truly unique."
"O - Great beer if a steeped raspberry character is what you're searching for...not at all overdone. If you prefer a Lindemans extremely sweet and syrupy beer, this one is probably not for you."
"overall - very interesting, probably one and done, but it's anvery enjoyable one."
"Pours a ruby beet color with a cap of pink froth. Nose of bready yeast and ripe raspberries. Nice balance in the flavor between ripe fruit and tart. A little fruit seed in the flavor as well as some very light tannin. The more I sip, the more this justs tastes like fermented ripre raspberries. Yum. I have to say, for the style, I prefer New Glarus Raspberry Tart at about half the cost and constant availability. This brew is a bit more fruit heavy and thick in the mouth than the crisp sweet/tart NG RT. Still a great beer all around."
"Overall - Really tasty and easy to drink. A great change up from typical beers. A bit to tart aftertaste that makes you almost want to chance it with another drink. Really good drink, would like to have one aged a few years."
"pours almost purple in color. has a little pinkish foam but no head. smells like fresh raspberries and lots of sweetness, almost like a sweet dessert wine. at first youre hit with a ton of sweetness then it turns to a mouth puckering tartness, yet goes down too smooth, this bottle wont last long. mouthfeel is thick and sticky. this is one hell of a beer, i wish they made this year round. if you get the chance you gotta try this beer."
"O: really great representation of the style, my fear was that the sweetness would overpower the taste but it worked nicely and really blew me away, loved it"
"O: Blushing Monk is a great beer for lovers of raspberries, fruit beers, or dessert beers.¬†Very much of a one-note beer, though, and drinkability is suspect, at best."
"Pored into pint glass. Pours dark ruby, but clear. One-finger head the color of strawberry milk. Lovely, strange pour. Nose is fresh mashed raspberries, along with a strong raspberry seed character and wood notes. Hints of Belgian yeast. Tastes great. Good mouthfeel and good carbonation. Overall, a fine effort."
"Overall, extremely good. The raspberry flavor is very pronounced but not overpowering or too sour or sweet. I think the high alcohol takes away from the fruit flavor but it's still an amazing beer. If you want you can compare it to New Glarus Raspberry Tart but that is a much lower alcohol beer so the raspberry stands out a great deal more."
"O- A good fruit beer, but I was expecting more. Was expecting more of a sour beer. The yeastiness of the beer makes it a little different and a slow drinker. Glad I tried it, but would not pay the $15 for it again (glad I had this now because I would have bought another if I found one)."
"Moderately thick for a fruit beer but on par for a 9.2% ale. Carbonation is also quite low but there to break up the monotony."
"Founders Blushing Monk is a top-notch fruit beer. Fruity without being cloying, and high in alcohol without being boozy. I'm shocked that the ABV is listed at %12.3. Is that correct? I thought it was 9something. Good mouthfeel. Compared to the other top-notch fruit beers, it's nice to see that Blushing Monk gets some distribution, even if it only comes out once every few years."
"Really enjoyed this one. The fruit is very well done and I liked the fact that it was more sweet than sour. The belgian yeast was a unique twist as well. Very drinkable beer that I highly enjoyed with my wife."
"A good fruit beer I am happy to have tried, but maybe a bit sweet and one-note for my tastes, the 7oz or so pour I got was a good amount."
"Definitely surprised me in a very confusing way. I really don't know how I really feel about this beer other than I would never every pay for it again. I'd have a glass if offered to me or something, but seriously if you're going to sip on this just make yourself a raspberry screwdriver and safe yourself some money. Glad I tried it for the novelty but I immediately reached over for some surly furious after this one to get my taste buds out of the raspberry funk they were in. Too much raspberries, could have made it a much more interesting beer. Who knows with so much sugar maybe leaving this one in the cellar might do some kwirky ol things to it."
"O- I couldn't get enough of this, wish I would have gotten a couple bottles of this when it was released in the area. Probably the best fruit beer I've had. Everything about this was good, a very enjoyable drink."
"Overall: I'm glad this one made it to bottles again, especially in the 22 oz. medium; great scents and flavors, and a tartness that keeps it refreshing and prevents it from becoming a sugary mess; weight, acidity and ABV would slow me down a bit on this one, but I really enjoy beers like this on occasion and I may be picking up at least one more (I guess it lived up to the $15/bottle price tag, at least in my opinion)."
"This is a seriously big raspberry beer, though I never would have guessed the ABV. I wouldn't exactly call it drinkable as he sweetness is pretty massive but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Overall one of the best fruit beers I've had."
"Overall this is a beast of a fruit beer, I would never have guessed that the ABV was so high. Very well done as the sweetness isn‚Äôt overpowering and the yeast adds a bit of complexity. Well worth a shot."
"O - The abounding raspberry aroma leads to a bit of a let-down in flavor where it's a bit more syrup-like than fresh and potent. I can say though that this beer pairs fantastically with Sartori's award-winning BellaVitano Gold cheese. MMM."
"I am completely blown away. I know I may be motivated by the press and the buzz--but for some reason this is one of the most fantastic beers I have ever had. It's like a key in a lock, baby."
"Absolutely amazing raspberry fruit beer. One of my favorites, though one that would be for occasional drinking only, much too sweet to have often."
"I dig the good fruit beers. It tastes authentic and brings the raspberry bomb to the table. Similar to New Glarus."
"10/11/14: holy shit is this great after 3 years. Nose is huge, rich and fruity. Taste is semi-sweet, tart, smooth as hell. Wow."
"One side note: Fantastic when properly proportioned with Cantillon Bruocsella 1900. Experiment at will. You'll have a lot left in your bomber."
"o: This is the fruitiest beer I've had in a long time. It isn't something I'd want to drink regularly, but it is very well done. An interesting break from my usual stout or IPA."
"Overall- its amazing and i usually share but with this one I hated sharing."
"O- Really enjoyed this beer, extremely easy drinkability, the abv is hidden well, the raspberry flavor coming out is fantastic, like I said earlier this beer gets to be a little too sweet after a couple of glasses. This is a beer to share with others."
"Fuller medium body, lower carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue, almost dries out the tongue after a while. One of the better non-sour fruit beers I've had, and definitely right up there with Raspberry Tart."
"Edit: oct 26 2013. This got amazing. So balanced and smooth. As far as fruit beers go, this could not be any better."
"Tickles the tongue with sourness but is incredible drinkable. The alcohol is almost non existent and I can't state enough how surprised I was that this beer is so good. Expensive but well worth the money."
"Notes: Founder's brews some of my all time favorite brews, and then stuff like this‚Ä¶ It is not as bad as their Cerise but the experience with their fruit brews‚Ä¶ This one lacks the complex boozy punch of say DFH's Fort, or the tart nuances of a good lambic. Quite surprised by the hype generated by this brew, and that this one was selected as the first release in big bottles."
"Pours a bright light purple color that is quite similar to a light grape juice. Really nice head with a slight pinkish hue. Spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings loads of raspberry to the level of Barq's Raspberry Cream Soda. Not much depth, but I don't really care, especially once it gets into the flavor. There is some slight yeastiness on the backend of the flavor, but for the most part this is just a raspberry assault that is absolutely beautiful. Some light earthiness, especially in the feel. Lightly tart and fairly sweet, though not too much. Really outstanding beer."
"O- Drinks extraordinarily well for the alcohol content. Simple, but really well done. Very sweet and would make for an excellent dessert beer."
"An insanely intense display of raspberry! Avoiding all the common flaws of typical fruit beers, and with the excessive use of fruit, it's remarkable how vibrant and true that this beer is to nature and the character of the plant."
"o - i have no problems drinking this beer and find it to feel more beer like than many other vedgie beers, but i don't know...something about it...maybe it is just the style in general, but it doesn't feel like beer to me. i think it is the mouth. overall an enjoyable experience and i plan to try and get ahold of a few more bottles...very good."
"Overall a really nice beer that is one of the stronger flavored fruit beers I've tried. And, for s 9.2% beer, it's a great dessert."
"I've been anxious to try this brew since Founders announced they were going to be bottling it. Pours a magnificent, deep burgundy with a slight pinkish-tinged head. The aroma is dominated by raspberries, with some candied sugar coming through just a bit. The taste closely follows the smell, with the sweet raspberries more apparent on the initial taste, and a more tart, drying finish‚Ä¶quite pleasant. This is a brew that I couldn't drink regularly, but as a dessert beer (cherry/peach cobbler come to mind), or maybe even paired with fruit salad, this beer would be perfect. The alcohol really isn't that apparent, although I'm sure after a 750ml bottle of this, you'd likely know it was there!! Glad I have another bottle to try in one of these scenarios‚Ä¶.nice job Founders."
"This is an outstanding beer. It was a chore to finish a 750 because of the high sweetness, but one glass is extremely easy to put down. The abv (note 9.2% on the label, not 12.3%) is non-existant."
"-Cheers"
"The flavor is best described as a raspberry bomb. Very sweet, Little evidence of hops, malt, or yeast initially. The yeast becomes more apparent as it warms. Some of that metallic quality shows up in the finish. Long, sweet, finish. This is a $16, liquid dessert. The mouthfeel is very full. A big beer to be sure. Overall, it's not really my cup of tea but it's a well made beer."
"O: I love it. It doesn't do much else other than tart raspberries, but then again it doesn't need to. Again, this is hands-down the best fruit beer I've come across. Highly recommended, despite the hefty price tag."
"Overall ‚Äì Being a huge raspberry fan in general, I knew I‚Äôd like this beer. After drinking it I can confidently say I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I will state, however, that the price is pushing it, but for being such a unique brew, and one that hides the alcohol so well, it is really worth it. Try this if you can; it is worth the money."
"D-A ridiculously enjoyable beer; way more complex than any other fruit beer I've had; most are one-note fruit bombs. This one has the fruit bomb character but also some nice chocolate with a slight bitter character that keeps me coming back for more. I don't, however, get any of the Belgian yeast character."
"O - At $13.99 a bottle, it's not as bad as in some places here, and after trying it, I went back to the store for more. This is also a fairly versatile beer, as it would pair exceptionally well with a rich chocolate cake (think flourless) or even just some dark chocolate. Also would be a great dessert beer on it's own."
"o: a greate brew. Nice fruit flavor and just sweet enough that I can finish the bomber without feeling ill. Highly recommend"
"O- Not a perfect beer, but they hit the mark they were aiming for. it is really good, and definitely worth seeking out. Cheers!"
"Overall I am pleasantly surprised by this release. I expected it to be good, but I'm not usually a really huge fan of non-sour fruit beers. As usual, Founders delivers. It's pricey, but I wouldn't turn down another one for sure. Probably the best fruit beer I've had."
"Note that its alcohol content, according to the label, is 9.2%, not 12.3."
"Overall- I would seek this out again but I don't think I would pay $19.99 for a 750 again. As far as fruit beers go this is an awesome one."
"O- Usually I am not a fan of flavored or sweet beer. Great beer, just a little sweet for me. Still delicious to have every once in a while."
"D - A very tasty, savory type of beer, refreshing despite the 9.2 abv, but the alcohol is totally hidden - a unique quality that I have learned to love from Founders."
"Overall, an impressive raspberry strong-- I heard the description and now I believe it."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Great Lakes Christmas Ale wine glass. Pours a dark ruby red with a thick pink head. Nose is all raspberries with a little bit of malt behind it. Taste is sweet raspberries up front, with a tartness at the finish that really balances it out and keeps it from being the least bit cloying. Really well done balance of sweet/tart. Some strong malt flavors as well. Very faint alcohol taste. Nothing to complain about in mouthfeel. Overall this is a winner. It's a big burly fruit beer with a high ABV and perfectly balanced. This might bump Belgian Red out of my top spot. Need to have it some more first. Well done, Founders."
"Going into this beer, I assumed it would be something of an imperial Raspberry Tart. There are definite similarities between the two beers, and while I prefer New Glarus' take I have to remind myself that Blushing Monk's ABV is over twice as high - from a purely technical standpoint, that's pretty impressive. I couldn't see myself drinking this often or in mass quantities, but it's excellent for what it is."
"750 ml bottle, 2011 vintage. Served in a flute, the beer pours a ruby red/purple color with about a half inch dark pink head that went away quickly. Not much lacing. The brew smells like fresh sweet raspberries, raspberry jam and a bit of tart raspberries. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like sweet raspberries and raspberry jam along with some tart raspberry, too. Also, there's a little bit of bready yeastiness noticable. But this beer is definitely all about the raspberries! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has moderate carbonation. It's smooth and very easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, it's certainly one of if not the best raspberry beers I've ever had. Even at $14.99 a bottle I'd definitely buy this again in the future, I thought it was worth the money."
"O: this is a well executed and unique fruit beer. It does a great job of putting raspberries on a pedestal while still retaining qualities of a Belgian style ale."
"Like raspberry soda. Medium to light in body, moderately carbonated on the palate, easy drinking, bright, raspberry from start to finish. Sweet, it is a truly amazing beer. I just had a thought, maybe I should do a side by side with Raspberry tart to compare the two. Another good beer from Founders."
"O: It pains me to have such a meh beer from my favorite brewery, but such is life. It's not a bad beer, but it's so completely one-dimensional and lacking in complexity that I could never call it good. Add onto that the fact that it's very expensive ($15 for my bottle) and you have an all-around disappointing beer."
"D: The cloying sweetness and heavy mouthfeel massively damages the overall drinkability."
"O: A wonderful Fruit beer that is pretty and delicious. Well done yet again, Founders."
"Overall: Very impressive, and I like it quite a bit more than Cerise (never tried R√ºb√¶us). However, despite the gorgeous look, tantalizing aroma and strong taste, it is ultimately too far outside the realm of beer (even Sour Ales seem more like ""beer"" to me) to want to seek this out again. So I am ""only"" giving it a 4 for overall."
"Overall I wasn't exactly impressed with this beer. There was a lot of hype about Founders releasing this beer again as part of there limitied edition series. Don't get me wrong I love most other Founders Beers, but not this one."
"The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Medium bodied with a great drinkability. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer. Something that helps change things up from the normal offerings and I'm definitely glad I picked this up; will be looking to score another bottle if possible."
"o - Overall I thought this was a great fruit beer; I really loved the sweetness of the raspberries in the taste. I wish the nose had been a little bit stronger and sweeter, and I wish the carbonation was a little bit less, as that would have made it almost perfect. In any event a great beer I would love to have again. My girlfriend loved it too, and I'm quite glas I have another bottle of it."
"I cannot believe that this is 9%. It just drinks like juice. It reminds me a lot of Rubeas and Framboise. An excellent drink but your wife/girlfriend will think it is amazing."
"Overall: It's nice to meet a fruit beer that doesn't try to be refreshing and light. This is an fruit beer for people who can't stand wheat with their fruit. It's heavy, sweet, and tart without ever being overbearing. Truly a first-class fruit beer."
"O/D-This beer delivered for me. Not only did I really enjoy the flavor, this is one of the more attractive looking brews I have come across so far. I love raspberries. Now I love this beer. Founders is just allergic to making bad beer. Applause."
"O: A great example of a fruity beer and the alcohol is hidden very well. This is a good one to share with your lady friend. Founder's does not fail to impress here."
"D: Deliciously drinkable and the ABV is hidden well here. No overwhelming alcoholic nose or taste though you definitely know its there. Very Enjoyable."
"Grabbed a bottle of this from Downtown Wine and Spirits tonight in Somerville. I passed on this beer the last time it was out because of the high price tag, but now that I can afford it, I am game. Pours out a nice reddish pink, with a finger of white/pink heading. The nose is of fresh raspberries, and that is about it, not artificial smelling either. Flavor is very sweet with raspberries, and again, that is about it for me, but this is not a bad thing by any means. Medium mouthfeel, and the alcohol is not present at all. It appears that they dialed it back a few notches with this batch, which is fine by me. My final thoughts are that this beer is delicious, and needs to be paired with some kind of dark chocolate dessert."
"Dark ruby brew. Fine bubbles. Delicious tangy raspberry aroma, with an earthy leaf must underlying. Tart and extreme raspberry...incredible lack of any alcohol heat given the greater than 12% ABV. Brett provides a mushroomy flavor. A rich maltiness and slick and sticky mouthfeel. Truly a unique and fabulous brew!"
"I can see this definitely creeping up on a person during the course of an evening. It was probably in the public's best interest to retire this one."
"D-this is very artificial and syrupy in the flavor, it is straight forward and simple, sweet and slightly bitter in the finish."
"drinkability - even with the beer being a little flat i enjoyed every sip and could have drank a couple bombers of this beer"
"Deep cherry red pour. Nose is heavy, sweet honey, berries, vanilla. Tons of vanilla in the mouth, with a full raspberry but not really all that enjoyable. Sort of cloying and heavily sweet, maybe a touch of sourness or acid. Difficult. Bottle is a couple years old at least, I'm not really sure this has improved or will improve more. Heavy, sticky berry sweetness."
"Wow. This is really tasty. Very delicious, great flavor. This is like liquid raspberries with alcohol. Very nice feel with good carbonation and a body that falls just light of medium. The drinkability is insanely high. I would love to drink this whole bottom myself."
"This beer appears a ruby red color. There is a small head that recedes rapidly, leaving virtually no lacing on the glass. Raspberry jam, raspberry pie, and just about anything raspberry. There is no shortage of raspberries here. The beer tastes very good. The alcohol is hidden very well behind an armada of pungent raspberries. It's a bit too sweet to enjoy more than a few ounces. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. I'd certainly have it again."
"The mouthfeel is moderately thick and carbonation is above average. Drinkability is good, it's a great fruit beer that showcases the raspberry flavor beautifully. If you like raspberries chances are you will enjoy this beer a lot. Only criticism is that it was pretty sweet overall. It could have used some tartness to balance it out a bit if it were to challenge NG's Raspberry tart for my favorite raspberry beer."
"overall - love this beer, i hope the rumors are correct that it will be re-released in 4packs!"
"Taste is amazing, it's sweet and fruity, so tasty and drinkable I love it. The carbonation is very light and drinkable it's totally worth selling out."
"D - Hard to say, for 12.30% it's pretty good, but the alcohol does work to kill it at the end as well as the sub-par taste. Not bad, but not great."
"Overall, this is ok but nothing special. Its not a true fruit beer to me, not enough fruit with too much alcohol. If you want to crush a 12% real quick and get slammed this might do the trick."
"I want more. Please hit me up if you have some to trade."
"Overall, a very good fruit beer. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the New Glarus but definitely worth giving it a try if you can still find it."
"this beer has a beautiful pink raspberry color, it pours nicely into a wine glass of a tulip glass, the texture is light with good carbonation and a sweet raspberry nose. despite its alcohol content there is no evidence of the abv while drinking it. i have bought this beer at many different places around philadelphia before its extinction, @ eulogy (where i currently work), @ cappones, @ the foodery, @ south philly taproom. if anyone wants to trade this beer for something please let me know. :)"
"This one is a miss. The New Glarus version is vastly superior."
"Pours deep dark ruby red with a pinkish tinged head. Smells like fresh raspberries, which is surprising given the age of the bottle. The fresh smell and taste really surprised me given how old this is. The taste is more fresh raspberries, very sweet, bready malt as well. Kind of has a belgiany taste. Mouthfeel is a bit warming and medium bodied, comforting. The alcohol is hardly noticeable though. Good drinkability, especially for a high alcohol content fruit beer. I'm glad I got to try this one while a few bottles were still left around"
"A shame that its no longer in production, this beer is a real shiner for what a raspberry lambic can be."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer, defintiely to be enjoyed (shared) with others."
"Overall, a great beer. I have a feeling it is slightly past it's prime. I would have liked a tarter character in the taste, but the alcohol has all but disappeared completely, which is a plus. Great stuff, can't wait to try it again."
"Raspberry nose hides the 12.3% ABV. The taste is sweet brewed raspberries. Poured a brownish/red, light lacing. An awesome specialty from Founders, and it was a treat to remember its beauty."
"Solid beer, glad I got to try it."
"Drinkability: An interesting brew that it's unfortunate to see retired. The Belgian thing almost works well with the raspberries, and the raspberries themselves are fantastic. Oh, and the alcohol is absolutely nonexistent, only poking its head through in very rare instances. Also, my girlfriend absolutely loved it, which is something I can pretty much say about only one other beer we've ever tried together (and I've made her try A LOT). So, definitely recommended."
"A pretty good fruit beer. It did not taste artificial. I found the sweet and tart raspberry flavors to be a nice change of pace from my usual picks."
"D: Deliciously drinkable and the ABV is hidden well here. No overwhelming alcoholic nose or taste though you definitely know its there. Enjoyable if you like lindeman's fruit lambics as it is not as sweet but with a similar style, taste."
"D - Drinkability is good for a 12.3% raspberry bomb. It's simple but I think that's what Founders is going for with the Blushing Monk. It goes down quite easy given the abv. Actually, the alcohol is hard to pinpoint which is pretty shocking for a beer of this stature. A good idea might be to share this brew. A bomber might be a bit much in a session for one person but I'd sure be happy trying to put one away myself. Another fine brew from Founders."
"Founders did a nice job overall with Blushing Monk. Personally, I prefer this to their other fruit beers. Yeah, it's somewhat one dimensional, but there's enough flavor to score pretty well. It does have a nice taste. Founders did a really nice job with the alcohol in this one. You'd never guess it's over 12%. For a fruit beer, it's good stuff. If you're into the style, you'll probably really like it. If you're like me and have a tough time getting into the style, you might just be surprised. Definitely worth picking up if you have the opportunity."
"*NB: Much better than Rubaeus, that one is a bit watery"
"D- Great pre or post meal sipper. A truly wonderful experience from top to bottom. ABV completely hidden."
"Medium bodied yet crisp and relatively clean. Finishes slightly dry. A really nice beer. I really loved Rubaeus and this was no let down either. The raspberry flavor really shines, as it should, and this one is a real easy drinker."
"Drinkability - as much like a fruity wine as it is a potent brew. Not much in the way of grain, hops, the basic beer components. A fine dessert beer or evening apertif, the strength and tartness of the beer keep it at a sipping level."
"A very drinkable beer. I split this with my girlfriend who also liked it. If you are into fruit beers, I recommend this. It will not stun you with complexity, but there is enough going on to keep up the interest."
"Overall a tasty brew. I would drink it again for sure."
"The body is moderate and surprisingly so clean for the ABV. The carbonation is light but does allow the raspberry to come out more. Just have to say it again, very clean. Overall a great fruit beer, and no it's not an oxymoron."
"This is much too easy to drink. Especially for a 12% brew. Enjoy this one if you get the chance."
"This is yet another excellent brew from the guys over at Founders. I'm not all that into fruit beers but this is a great example of what fruit beers can and should be."
"Awesome taste. Not quite as thick as Raspberry tart. It tastes about the same but seems like more belgian and less raspberry. Probably the best fruit beer I have run across. Strong aroma. A bitterness hits after the sweet. Medium body. Could drink a bottle of this for desert. Seems like a really good mix and belgian and raspberry. Great level of carbonation."
"Picked this up at the Beer Stop in West Hazleton for $15. I had this bottle quietly aging away for about a year. ABV stated on the bottle is higher that what is written here - somewhere around 13%ABV if IRC. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my Maredsous chalice. Appears a hazy ruby red with a pinkish hue and about two fingers of fluffy pink foam. Smells and tastes of, what else, fresh raspberries. Notes of raspberry jam, tart raspberry jell-o, raspberry puree, sweet -n- sour raspberry flavors. medium in both body and carbonation. extremely drinkably, especially after about a year in the bottle. The alcohol is just about non-existent. This one goes down very well. Sure, it's pricey, but IMHO, worth the $ for a once a year treat. Let's hope this one comes back around, but I'm not holding my breath since Rubeaus has been put on hiatus."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for its strength."
"Bomber shared with Jason,Derek, and a couple of newbies thank you Jason. Is it 9 or is it 13%? Bottle aged for a year says 13.2% and it could very well be. Amaxing fruitbeer. Dark pink with big soapy pink head and pink lace. Aroma of raspberry and some malt. Big mouthfeel, raspberry, tart raspberry. The taste is a beer with very raspberry, she delivers. Good drinkability. Carobonated too. Natural sugars."
"Pours a beautiful rich ruby color. Not much of a head, a little sticky cap and mild lacing. Strong smell of fresh raspberries and a little heat on the tail. Robust flavor of raspberries, with some wine qualities. Light texture and body goes down smooth with some lingering bitterness. This is delicious, great drinkability cant wait to have it again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a hint of carbonation, very nice."
"Pours a dark ruby red with a thin fizzy light pink head that quikly fades. Nice funky aroma with pleasant raspberry presence that is not too overpowering. Excellent balance of sour and sweet with a slight spiciness. Huge raspberry presence that is not too sweet, being balanced out by slightly sour earthy funkiness. Very quaffable and not acidic at all with a dry finish."
"If you spot this while beer shopping and have not had this yet and like fruit beers, buy this immediatly. You will thank me later. I recently heard that founders is discontinuing Rubeaus do to the cost of raspberry's, so I don't see Blushing Monk being brewed again any time soon, which is sad."
"Drank alright, the tartness & dryness hold me back, this kind of reminds me of of an Imperial version of new Galrus' Raspberry, tart. Sometimes less is more, this would be a fantastic beer to pair with foods. My wife would love this, but she's been asleep for an hour, here loss, will save her some, maybe..."
"Cheers to you Jimmy J for bringing this one."
"Pours the true color of raspberries and slightly cloudy with a wispy head that's gone in a flash. Looks and smells like a wine except for the spotty pattern of Belgian lacing. The aroma is amazing...well balanced between the natural sweetness and tart characteristics of the berry. The mouth feel is light yet has the stature to carry the flavors on well past a sip. Full raspberry taste, tart but well within a satisfying tolerance. This bottle is labelled 12.3% ABV....and it is well integrated. This alcohol presents some warming but it is hidden by the intensity of the flavor and complexity of the mouth. A really nice drinker. Highly recommended."
"6/4/6/3/14 (3.3/5)"
"M/D - I wasn't expecting this at all, very very sweet and tasty raspberry. As for drinking more than one, no way. Beside the price, I think its too sweet to make it a regular."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The mouthfeel is dam near perfect. Its not to full bodied but isnt exactly medium bodied either. The sweetness is kept in check by tartness. This was a pleasure from start to finish. This is what I wished DFH Fort was like."
"D: Pretty low. Not extremely sweet for the style but it becomes too much. ABV is pretty damn high, too."
"The remainder of this bottle will have to be blended with something else to finish it though."
"Taste: Very tart fruity and refreshing. This is the most alcoholic beer I've drank but the alcohol isn't really noticable. This is what every other raspberry beer aspires to be."
"Drinkability: Excellent! An impressive, sumptuous brew that delivers tons of great flavors and a punchy alcohol percentage, yet it remains very, very drinkable. It's no Dogfish Head Fort (thankfully). Love me some Blushing Monk!"
"D - A little cloying and tart for me. Fun to try once, though!"
"From a brown 22oz bottle - Pours a dark reddish/brown - very pretty. Smells of tarty raspberries. Below average carbonation. First sip is tart and bitter with the raspberries leading the way. Other fruits could include pears and grapes. Super fruity not too sour. VERY NICE. The 12.3% is well hidden."
"HV"
"This is certainly not something I would drink with any regularity, and in fact I would probably share a bottle next time. But this is really an impressive beer that I would gladly have again."
"Poured into a Smuttynose Big beer tulip. Reddish brown slightly hazy appearance. White bubbly head quickly disipates to a slick with ring of bubbles. When shaken up and swirled halfway through the head comes back but it is more foamy than at first. Smells like raspberries, raspberries, raspberries. At first this is all I can smell and I can smell it from acroos the room. After a bit some alcoholic sweetness pokes into the nose and almost a banana scent. As it warms more, the cloying sweetness becomes more pronounced. Tastes like raspberries and a bit of tartness, this is definitly more sweet than tart. Has a bubbly mouthfeel at first upon a bit of swiling the bubbly mouthfeel moves toward a thick, syrupy, sweeter mouthfeel. As this warms up the alcohol which was previously well hidden starts to become barely evident especially deep in the nose. Overall I think this has too much fruit sweetness for what it is. Not an easy drinker for me."
"Tastes like fresh rasberries and it is very refreshing. I have no idea that this beer is high octane! Masks it wonderfully. Good crisp mouthfeel- not as syruppy as I would expect. Pretty darn drinkable for a fruity beer as well."
"D - very drinkable - tastes like spiked punch, but not very many identifiable beerlike qualities. I got a little bit of wheaty berliner weiss flavor somewhere in there, but not very evident. A good drink but not a great beer, massively overpriced. Trying Rubaus soon"
"Overall, not as good as a Rubeaus, and not worth the money."
"Drinkability: this is a fairly unique beer IMHO, but this is one of those one bottle per session beers despite the great flavor."
"Quite an interesting beer, not sure it is worth the price of a case but certainly as a single bottle purchase."
"Thin head settled quickly, darker red than the Rubaeus, more like a raw cranberry juice. The aroma was pretty heady I thought: a strong black cherry smell that gave way to a yeasty odour and then a pink grapefruit flush. The taste was balanced and pleasant with tart, over ripe fruit, muted acidity and teasing tartness counter balanced with the sweetness of a european honey. Both this and the Rubaeus are raspberry-based and this is like the higher-alcohol big brother to it with a more substantial mouthfeel and texture. The only slight distraction, I thought, was a more abrupt after taste, possibly the malt following on the heels of a very pronounced raspberry-beer experience. The high alcohol is very well hidden, I would never have guessed this was over 12%. Highly recommended."
"I was impressed by the Founders R√ºb√¶us, but this is something else. I don't believe I've ever tasted a fruit beer quite like this. Granted, I can't exclude fruit-lambics which are another thing altogether, but this too is special enough to be put in a category of its own; at 12.3%, Blushing Monk is an incredibly unique beer, one which will stand out in my memory for some time."
"Drinkability: Superb sipper/aperitif . If you like raspberries, grab a few friends and crack one. Highly recommended, sweet fruit beer."
"Expensive, to be sure, but it's not often you see a brewery nail a beer like this. Find it, try it."
"Note - The 2011 bottling is every bit as good as the original"
"Quite enjoyable as an occassional sipper. Very natural feel to this. Early gateway to more funky lambics?"
"Founders has every right to be proud of Blushing Monk. They've nailed the essence of a big raspberry fruit beer and they've picked the perfect name (considering the appearance and the ingredients). This isn't a beer that I'd drink often, especially at $15.39 per bomber, but it's a delicious treat that will ease me into the evening with style."
"Wonderful, and it belongs up there with Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart from New Glarus. It is dangerously, dangerously drinkable. I had to triple check the ABV."
"D-This is 12.3%...your kidding! A great sipper for sure. This is the beer equivalent to a wine aperitif...a truly well done brew. Certainly not for everyone but for those that like raspberries...wonderful!"
"A short lived one three finger head is almost pink in color, which I found quite appropriate for the style. Body is a very deep burgundy. Nose is full of purreed raspberries, rugbarb, and a prequil of sweet tartness. A long creamy tartness is actually silky as you take first sip. A minerally vegetable laced sweet and sour battle ingages on the back of the tongue. This has been called a bigger version of Rubeaus, but this really is its own unique brew. Twords the end of the palate you get a distinct bit of dryness that really balances out the tartness. There really is a lot of complexity going on within the palate of this beer. Alchol is completely hidden. Mouthfeel is fruity dry thick tartness. An exceptionally drinkable sipper."
"Tasted a lot like a framboise to me, still pretty tasty for a fruit beer with that much alcohol, interesting brew and would not necessarily expect this from Founders, would drink again if given the chance, recommended"
"drinkability is good. the fruit is very prominent without being overly sweet. there's a touch of sweetness there to help balance things out, but not too much. the alcohol is mostly hidden, aside from the pleasant warming that starts on the way down and spreads outward from there. a great dessert beer that can be enjoyed by beer geeks and non-geeks alike."
"D: The alcohol is nicely masked. The beer is a good sipper that veers dangerously close to cloying but never quite gets there."
"Founders hit it out of the park with this one. Pours a raspberry red in color with some nice carbonation bubbles filling the top of the glass. Smell is tart raspberries. Taste is much the same. Amazing enough, I didn't tire of it by the end of the bomber. This is a very easy drinker, you get no hints of the 12.3% ABV. This was a real treat."
"D- Definitely a desert beer, for the 12 percent alcohol this one is extremely drinkable. It doesn't quite measure up to raspberry tart but it's hard to hold that against it."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability.. well, for what it is, it is easy to drink. This would make a good sunday brunch beverage or something to use for a toast on new years eve or a celebration of some sort, but beyond that i could not see this as a beer to settle down and drink for an evening, mainly because it does not taste like beer"
"D: A little tasty especially if you're into the raspberry flavor, goes down ok, not very filling, strong kick, this just is not my type of beer, particularly since I could see too much in the way of beer characteristics through the intense raspberry flavor."
"I do think that the price for the bomber is a little high, but it is worth a try."
"Drinkability is good. But a little can go a long way for most tasters."
"Minus the very miniscule island of foam, this beer looks like wine. Merlot and grape juice with a little it o' sediment at the bottom. No bubbling, no lacing, and no head. The aroma is very fruity. Lots of rasberries, a few currants, and even some wine grapes. The taste is a pretty complex rasberry with lots of other very lightly tart fruits. The palate is very juicey and msweet. Not overpowering, great after dinner beverage. Only mildly warming cosidering the alcohol."
"pours a beautiful translucent ruby red, but with no head. Intense raspberry aromaswith a bitter backbone that smells a little seedy. A little hot as well. There is a slight but haunting aroma of roses as well. The taste is more mellow and integrated. More roses, heavy flavors of fresh raspberries, and a background herbal quality. I like it, but I can see how it wouldn't be everybody's cup of tea. The mouthfeel is tart, but not too much so. Quite a big beer and it shows, but I think its interesting enough to warrant exploring this one a few more times."
"Pours a dark cherry red with a one finger hazy pink colored head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Very spotty lacing. Smell is a spicy fruit, but not necessarily raspberries. Strawberries, sour cherries, and blueberries all fill the nose. Sour wine aromas make a strong presence. There is a pretty obvious alcohol smell too. Sweet syrupy raspberries up front followed by a sour bite. Some pepper and a faint wood flavor emerge as well. Aftertaste has a bit of alcohol with a sour apple like sting. Mouthfeel is a medium body with a steady carbonation. Nothing too outstanding about this brew, but definitely worth a try."
"Blushing Monk falls into that wondorous category that borders Flemish red sour ale and fruit ale. A delicious beer that pours with a reddish-burgandy color this brew does not disappoint. A unique offering from a brewey that consistenly pushes the inner envelope of craft brewing."
"Pours a reddish/pinkish hue with a very small pink head. Nose is definitely raspberries. Nice and full edge. Flavor is definitely fruity and full of raspberries. But this tastes like Kool-Aid with alcohol in it to me. A bit too one sided with not a lot of complexity to it. The feel has a great level of carbonation that just soothes the mouth. Overall though, this leaves a lot to be desired. No complexity and too much kool-aid-ness. I'd pass on this next time I think."
"Served chilled in a tulip glass, from a twenty-two ounce brown bottle. Poured a beautiful cranberry red color. Almost an inch of soapy, bubbly, pinkish red colored head formed. Pretty quickly faded into a small ring in the glass. It did leave small spots of thin lace on the glass. A big nose full of raspberries, and plenty of dry alcohol. Almost Chambord like. Taste was pretty much the same. Tons of thick fresh raspberry flavors, sugary sweet with almost mouth puckering sourness. Finishes rather smooth with quite a bit of throat and body warming alcohol, and pretty dry. Has a nice, full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Plenty of tingly carbonation felt on the tongue. Pretty good drinkability, but I choose to enjoy it sip by sip. Pretty damn good in my opinion. Didn't know what to expect coming into this, but was pleasantly surprised."
"decent drinkability. a bomber is honestly a bit much, but it's very tasty. i don't know how ""blegian"" it is though."
"Deep pinky red color. Reminds me of the old dessert 1 2 3 and the shades of red that were in it. Very carbonated but not much head. Huge rasberry and tart/sour aroma. Blast of fruit and rasberries up front. Great sourness and slightly sweet as well. Very well done between the 2 tastes. The sour bite is really, really great. Almsot seems an alcohol bite but I dont think so. Very bright and lively mouthfeel. Rather thin and quaffable. Fantastic all around. Could do this on a regular basis and often. Right up there with New Glarus-which I love-for me."
"A very poor effort from this otherwise outstanding brewery. A beer to avoid IMHO."
"This is a smooth fruit beer, but also noticeably boozy; it's basically the Rubeaus on steroids. At 12.3% ABV, it's not exactly easy sippin', and there's really not much in the way of hops to balance things out. Still, it's tasty and is definitely worth a try. The folks at Founders don't do bad beers, and this is another good one."
"The strong rasberry scent of this ale is sweet but not cloying, a nice change from the candy quality of so many fruity lambics. The color is a deep pink, a mix between magenta and ruby; the blush of the Blushing Monk. Very small head. The taste is clean, sweet and fruity, but not too sweet, with a dry quality, very reminiscent of a rich red wine. The flavor was full enough to hide the strong abv. I sampled this beer at Extreme Beer Fest 2006 and had been searching for it since. I took a beer break for the past few months and found this to be very drinkable given my palate's complete cleansing."
"This is almost like drinking raspberry Kool-Aid, but with a touch of carbonation."
"Pours a slightly hazed ruby red/maroon, nice colour, thin pinkish head forms, settles to a thin layer, leaves some nice lace rings. Smell is raspberries, fruits, toast, sour and tart blackberry seeds, bread, grains, nice. Taste is sweet berries, raspberry, caramel, very fresh taste, alcohol is non existant, sugary and fruity finish, but with a tart and bitter berry seed aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low carbonation, bit of warmth comes across, very nice fruit beer, nice complexity."
"Highly recommended. Just don't expect anything Belgian. And if you're a utilitarian, Rubeaus wins out, but don't pass this one up!"
"Overall: Thanks Faro for yet another great beer. My wife sends her thanks as well. This beer is great. Fruit beers are fun, and never boring."
"Good beer to try but I don¬ít think I¬íll seek this one too often."
"Overall: Another wonderful Founders brew. Tons of raspberry flavor that keeps you running back for more. I really enjoyed this brew; I just wish I had bought more than 1 bottle."
"I split this bottle with SurlySober...where he got it I don't know."
"Drinkability: Why don't they bottle stuff like this in a 12 oz bottle? It would be quite hard to open one of these 22s and finish it by yourself. At $15.99 and with it being so limited, I wasn't thoroughly impressed, but it was worth trying. This is a surefire dessert beer. I'll stick with the Rubaeus from now on."
"D - This is scary, it's as easy to drink as the Ruebaus, but is twice as strong. It sticks to raspberry, and doesn't seem to explore a whole lot, but it is very good at what it is."
"Appearance is a maroon purple color. A finger of big bubbled head that vanishes quickly. Interesting color, although no real lacing. Nose is crazy spicy raspberries. Very light hint of sourness. Flavor is solid. Sour raspberry notes, but not as strong as the sweetness. Alcohol is covered up really well, and grows as the beer warms. Sourness shows up at the end. Winelike, although very sweet. A nice mix of random dried fruit as well. Feel is excellent: crispy, biting, refreshing high carbonation. Body is medium, maybe a little thin but good with the carbonation. Overall, I liked this one, although it's not the most complex beer in the world (standard for the style). A lot like a sparkling (and highly alcoholic) raspberry juice."
"A superb offering. Certainly didn't taste its ABV. If you love New Glarus Raspberry Tart and high ABV beers (and I do) you will love this beer (and I do)."
"D - I think this one is better in small doses. I always loved the samples I had at the Great Taste but drinking a whole 22oz was a little tough. Still a nice tasty fruit beer."
"Pours a dark golden brown color with a pink head that is rocky and builds up tall on the glass. Dies down to leave lacing along the side of the glass and a ring on top of this nice looking beer. Smell is of berries and more fruit in the background. Taste is even more fruit, but not much else, and I did not complain. Absolutely a shock coming from a big beer. Anyone that says they don't like beer, give them this and it might blow their socks off... This does not taste like ""beer"""
"Pours a brilliant light crimson with a frothy pink head that dies to a ring. Very lively carbonation. Smells of huge, sweet raspberries, and....raspberries. Taste is awesome. Juicy fresh raspberries that are sweet and tart. Makes me pucker with delight. Medium in the mouth with a great tickle on the toungue from the lively carbonation. ABV is absolutely non existant. This beverage is an abolute delight!"
"$13.59 a bottle at Woodman¬ís East. Wowza! 12.3% Pours a crimson lavender with a huge pink tinged white head. Dissipation is rapid despite a lot of visible carbonation. Aroma is boozy and very powerful, consisting mostly of raspberries. Very tart and boozy flavor of raspberries. Full to the point of being heavy. Raspberry flavor is out of this world but it¬ís one dimensional, not that that is necessarily bad. I think this beer is exactly what the brewers were going for. It¬ís really quite astounding. Personally, however, I am not very happy with it. It¬ís just too big, too strong, and too much of a good thing. I also don¬ít like that the body, at least to me, seems to come more from alcohol then from raspberries. Impressive it is, simply for being so big and so fruity but I really did not enjoy it and had a tough time finishing the bottle, even with a little help."
"D- It is a great beer if you love strong raspberry flavors. Not a style I would usually spend $15 on but I am glad I tried it. Probably not one I would get again. Nice beer to watch a rugby game with!"
"12.3% alc per label.Poured into a oversized wine glass a full rich raspberry red with a hint of brown to it a lacy pink colored head atop,wow big tart raspberry aromas a bit of sweet alcohol and toast as well.Tastes like the raspberries off the bush I used to eat when running around the woods of central MI as a kid very tart with just a bit of sweetness but the tartness really is the show,there is a toasty backbone and a sticky sweet aftertaste and mouthfeel making it more that just tart raspberries on the palate.The best fruit beer of any kind I have had I had Rubeus over the summer and this is a double version of that,kick ass beer."
"Mouthfeel is like a sweet tart filled with fruity jam. It tickles the front of the tongue upon the sip and hits the rear of the tongue with verocity. Full bodied, rich, chewy, yeasty, and chocked full of berries."
"22 oz bottle was about $16 at The Keg in Clarksville, Indiana. Pours a slightly hazed garnet body with a small and soapy pink head. A few flecks of lace are left on the goblet. Aroma is earthy yeasty mushrooms and lots of raspberries. Taste mirrors the aroma, with lots of tart raspberries and some earthy yeast. Alcohol is miraculously hidden except for a slight warmth. Very drinkable for such a large fruit beer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and soda like carbonation. Good beer but I would like to have seen some malt presence to counter the fruit."
"Drinkability - this is very good ale. Its high abv alone limits sessionability, but the taste is more of sipper than a session beer anyway. It is something to enjoy with dinner or dessert."
"Drinkability: Pretty good fruit beer."
"Jen: Do we usually pay this much for a beer? No! Would I buy this again...without even blinking!. It pours out a nice deep magenta color with little foam. All I can smell is raspberries. First taste is quite amazing. It has a nice medium body with small bubbles. The ending is of tart raspberries that makes the alcohol virtually disappear. I wouldn't even think there was alcohol in it, except that equivalent to a wine cooler. I both want to savour this and drink it in one big gulp...can't wait to have it again. I would recommend this to anyone, even non-beer drinkers!"
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy pink head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful raspberry aroma that is tart and almost lambic like. The taste is perfect. It has a smooth and refreshing raspberry taste that goes down so easy and finishes tart. It's refreshing even at 12.3%. That's quite a feat. This is what I was hoping Fort would taste like. These guys have a winner here. There is such a tremendous raspberry presence. This may be the best fruit beer ever. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an awesome beer. I wish I could get my hands on more of this; a kick ass beer and great drinker."
"Cheers!"
"Felt very bubbly in the mouth. Nice medium body. Tart aftertaste. This one was enjoyable for me, and I am not a huge fruity beer type of guy."
"Drinkability: For the alcohol percent, wow. The acidity is a bit much for me (although right now I am feeling especially acid sensitive, so I am going to disregard the acidity), and the price is quite high. I will buy it again."
"D- This beer is all about the big and wonderful taste of raspberries with some nice sweet and sugary notes that support the tartness. It drinks very smooth for a beer for this much alcohol. The Belgian yeast adds some nice subtle flavors that enhance the sweetness and give it some nice depth."
"This beer poured a clear dark amber color and formed a small off white head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt and strong raspberry as well. The flavor was of malt, raspberry and maybe a hint of anise. The body is medium light, yet slightly creamy. The finish is tart, yet a touch sweet with the influence of the raspberry quite apparent. The warming effect of the alcohol is present, but is hidden fairly well, otherwise. Not much for fruit styles, but this one is done very well."
"Shared growler from the brewpub. Pours a pinkish ruby color with a medium and fluffy white head with decent retention. Strong tart raspberry aroma with touches of citrus. Medium-bodied and fizzy with a very strong raspberry flavor that mellows pretty quickly. Unlike most tart raspberry beers, this one becomes easier to drink with time, which is probably due to the maltyness. The higher than usual ABV is well-hidden too. The finish is tart raspberry at first but finishes like sweet toffee. One of the best Fruit Beers I have tried."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Just had this beer the other day at the Brewery in Grand Rapids. This is one exceptional beer! Labeled as a Belgian Trippel fermented with raspberries and the ABV is 12.3%. Kind of a champagne type mouth feel with huge amounts of raspberry aroma and taste. You would never know that this beer is as high in ABV as it is indicated because is it is dangerously smooth going down. It would be easy to call this a ""chick beer"" because of the flavor, but I would venture to guess that even the biggest of beer drinkers would have a short night after a couple of glasses of this beer. That being said this beer is my wifes favorite and it is simply delicious for a fruit beer. I'm still much more of a KBS fan, but this is a nice touch to drink on occasion."
"I'm not generally a big fruit beer fan, but this one is no ordinary fruit beer. Highly recommend."
"That's right, this serving was from the bottle. I just got my hands on a limmited 22 oz bottle. This red passion poured with a fizzy head that was gone in an instant. The smell was like sweet frozen raspberry lemonade concentrate you get at the grocerie store. Very tart, no alcohol phenols smell present. Mouthfeel is crisp, fizzy but thick. Taste is great. Big raspberry up front with a little dry almond after taste. Drinkability is outstanding, you could easily go through a 22oz'er yourself. I think I just might do that."
"D: This is criminally drinkable. it goes down so smooth and easy. The alcohol is virtually nonexistant. I can't figure out how or where they hid it! It's like drinking a 3.5-4% lambic. Amazing!"
"Very clean pour with an excellent rose colored head. Very sweet beer. This may sound stupid but this reminded me of my childhood and I kept remembering back to that foamy jello stuff (I don't remeber what it was called) . Perfect amount of carbination. Overall yet another great job by Founders."
"Pours a murky ruby to blood in color with a bubble gum pink head that builds to a finger and then recedes to nothing quickly. Aroma is a mix of sweet raspberry puree along with a lemony tartness. Taste is much the same, like a not quite ripe, tart raspberry, there is some raspberry sweetness underneath that slides across the back of the tongue, but the tartness is dominant. Carbonation at first is a bit sparkling with a crisp effervescence, this dies down as it warms but there is still a bite at the back of the throat. Reminds me very much of another tart raspberry beer except for the alcohol content. The alcohol on the chalkboard at the pub stated 10.3 and it is almost non-evident, very well hidden/balanced. This is definitely not one I can do many of both because of its strength and its strong fruit flavors, but it captures the essence of raspberries very well and was a nice festive one to have after belgian waffles this holiday morning."
"can't wait to try it over ice cream"
"Wow. Amazing brew. Poured out to a deep ruby color with medium low carbonation. Aroma of raspberries and malt. Very appealing. Flavors of complex berries, malt, a hint of grain and husk. Nice. Mouthfeel was thicker than most other fruit beers, but wasn't at all syrupy or overly dense. Drinkability is pretty good consitering the rather high ABV. This is what we'd get if R√ºb√¶us was put on steroids. Recommended."
"Nice thick mouthfeel. The high acidity balances the sweetness of the raspberries perfectly. Could drink a good long time."
"WOW. This beer is amazing, it is like a rasberry lambic times 100. It pours a hazy redish pink with a large white bubbly head. Smells intensly of rasberrys and yummy sweetness. The taste is amazing, stronger than a lambic but so good. It has a somewhat sour or tart aftertaste, but the rasberry comes through the strongest. I could drink these all day long. The mouthfeel is carbonated and fresh, very light. This is a wonderful offering at Founders and should be tried by all! Enjoy."
"The bottom line is that this stuff was easy to quaff and very tasty. I like the body and flavour, both of which are noticeable improvements on the standard lambic flavour in general and the Rubaeus offering from Founders in particular. I hope they start bottling this stuff soon!"
"This would be a seriously dangerous summer beer because it goes down SO easily."
"This beer was a little expensive at $5.00 for an 8 ounce glass, but it was worth it. It had a nice ruby red color and a great aroma of raspberries. It had a nice pink foamy head. It had wine like characteristic, and is a great fruit beer. It reminded me of a raspberry Lambic, but a lot stronger."
"the mouthfeel was a little watery but that could be due to the big beer i drank at the fest"
"Velvety smooth and incredibly drinkable. Highly recommended."
"Apparently it has four times the amount of raspberries that Rubeaus had in it and after trying it, you can definitely tell that is the truth."
