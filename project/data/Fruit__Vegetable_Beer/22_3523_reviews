"Light fruity apple notes with a hint of belgian yeast in the background.  pretty much what it says on the box."
"If you want a glass of champagne in a 12 oz. bottle this is your beer."
""
""
"3/22/15 (Bottle) - Light golden pour, generous pillow head, thick texture. Sweet apple aroma. Beer is very sweet, tastes OK, feel light and smooth. OK beer but I like others better from this brewer."
"Overall:  It's refreshing, but lacks complexity. Not the best beer from Unibroue."

"It was bright, it was crisp, it was unique. It had the essence of it's fruity notes without having a heavy amount of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a big fan of fruit beers so that is probably reflected here. Having said that, the apple flavor is light, well balanced and pours rather well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Belgian cider? Whatever, it's just OK."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very carbonated tasty fruit beer that I would have again."
""
""
"Fizzy apple with no bang and not much to mention.  Disappointing from Unibroue and I like them and fruit beers in general."
""
""
"Overall: Good brew, little pricey considering the other beers Unibroue puts out there for the same price. Share with a friend, and drink up. Salud!"

"Final Grade: 4.11, an A-. Éphémère Pomme is one of the best apple-flavoured beers I've had, but to be fair, I don't recall ever actually liking one very much until now. This is exceedingly good for a fruit beer, and I absolutely love the crisp mouthfeel - but it's still not my favourite in the Éphémère series. As with most of Unibroue's flagship products, this one has a strong Belgian ale vibe, so if you're looking for something along that line with a decent fruity kick, this is a worthwhile option. I'd get this one again, but I'd still rather drink a good craft cider."
"So overall would I recommend it ? Even with the 3,5/5 that I gave to that beer I will say No. Don t take me wrong, this beer is not bad but it doesn t have that thing for me to recommend to give it a try."
"Overall - this isn't bad beer, but the apple flavor is just too non existent for my tastes."
""
"O – I thought the apple would be overwhelming, but this is surprisingly well-balanced.  Otherwise a fantastic Belgian-style pale or tripel, with a twist."
""
""
""
"Interesting and glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""

"Probably my favorite artificially flavored beer product. The yeast enhances the apple in a buttery pie crust kind of way. Very awesome."

"Okay, simply a light summer beer with a big dose of green apple up front. Would try again on tap, but would probably just prefer some Franziskaner."

""
"06/09/12 At Shorty's, NYC. Had the bottle & liked it (Still waiting to kiss a girl.) On tap it's a much brighter flavor. Not too sweet but the green apple essence is in the house. Nice texture. Not too syrupy. Now to try it w/one of Shorty's Pork roast pork sammies."
""
""
"O - One-noted. Not something I'd reach for regularly, but credit is due for the fact that this is a green apple beer not trying to disguise itself as something else."

"O - This seems more like an apple-flavored soft drink than a beer to me. It's probably decent for the style (it is intended to be a fruit beer, after all), but just not my idea of what a beer should be. I'm also not a big fan of the flavor of Belgian yeast. If you like Belgians and/or fruit beers, give it a try."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 7/17/2015. Pours fairly hazy pale gold color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big apple juice, pear, white grape, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, clove, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of apple juice, spice, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of apple juice, pear, white grape, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, clove, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of apple juice, pear, white grape, orange peel, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of apple juice, spice, wheat, and yeast ester flavors; with very nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice fruit flavored witbier style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of apple juice, malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - Nothing wrong here, just not terribly interesting. I love green apples, and apple beer seems like a good idea, but this is fairly plain."
""
"Poured from a bottle. Has a white-yellow color, like white grape juice, and a very healthy white foam. Smells like sour fruit, not unpleasant but not great. The flavor is more complex. The apple is most dominant but isn’t overpowering. The beer is more dry than sweet, even a little tart. Has a nice, smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is a little lacking in some regards but the beer is still pretty enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Mouthfeel could be better, smoother, but there's a nice balance between sweet fruits and spices."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a cloudy golden color with a two finger fluffy white head that grew before receding into a foam of white, leaving no lacing. It looks quite good for a fruit beer, like a tripel. Scents of green apple, grainy malt, spicy Belgian yeast, faint apricot and wheat malt. A good, fruity, light, crisp scent with the tell-tale spiciness of Unibroue's Belgian yeast strain. Very nice. Taste begins with heavy, fruity apple notes, on the green apple side of thing, and some slight pear-like flavors. This mingles with spicy and earthy Belgian yeast, faint coriander, very faint lemon-like sourness and a nice backbone of sweat and grainy malt, all present throughout the sip. Finish is grainy wheat cracker, apple and spice, as is the aftertaste. A very good flavor profile, not overwhelming or bold, but light and refreshing, yet still quite complex for the style. Very well done. Mouthfeel is light bodied and watery, with high carbonation and a wet finish. Refreshing and crisp, befitting the rest of the beer. Overall this is a very good fruit beer, with a nice Belgian character to give it depth. Its aroma and flavor are crisp and refreshing and the mouthfeel is light which helps the other qualities. Its a good warm weather beer and quite well done."
""
""
"Overall, an incredibly refreshing beer. When I'm in the mood for something light and fruity this hits all the right notes. The flavor/aroma profile is complemented perfectly by the texture. Unibroue never disappoints with their Belgian-style masterpieces."

"This was served with a slightly goldened straw color with a head that didn't show much retention. Smell was apple and orange, and there are flavors of apple, malt, citrus, and minimal hops in the taste. The beer has a pretty nice mouthfeel (thin, but not too thin and crisp) but also is very acidic, so much so that I could feel it burn my esophagus on the way down. Overall, I think that this is a pretty good beer, as it offers overt fruit flavors while not being too sweet, and it's not too thin. But is it worth the $8 that I paid for a tall glass of the beer? Well, no."

"Let me tell you ladies and gents, if you like apples then your gonna LOVE this beer! Its ok for me, not great, not awful. If this beer was a women I presume that Id take er home to mamma then maybe a date to Taco Bell or Wendys, idk. As always everyone 'Merica."

"O: By far the best fruit beer I have ever had. Not artificial and not a wine cooler just a great beer."

""

""

""
""
"Overall the quality is there and the aroma is great but this drink is meant for people that do not drink IPA's and who enjoy sweet drinks."
""
"Overall this appears to be your average fruit beer, very sweet with the character of the dominating fruit, in this case apples, and then not anything else. One or two of these on a hot summer day, like today, would be nice but the sweetness gets to be too much after a two and I need something with some hops in it. Typical for the style; try it once."

"650mml bottle bought from the Bottle Barn, Santa Rosa, USA a few days earlier. Shared between two people. As part of a six-week West Coast beer tour. See my blog for more details: carbeers.wordpress.com"

"A light, fruit beer that embodies apple flavor without overpowering through sweetness. It's refreshing and crisp with a soft and subtle vanilla note on the smell and palate. You can drink four of these and not feel any bloated, heavy framboise-like, richness on the stomach. At a smooth 5.50% ABV, you don't have to struggle to get through it. Very good paired with meat and potatoes or pasta. Perfect on a summer day in a cold glass. I've only found them in singles or a 4-pack, $2.99 a piece or $10.99, respectively. Unibroue makes fantabulous beer, try the others!"
""
""
"This is one unique tasting beer! Apple nose (of course) with hints of banana/bubble gum. Like a combination Heffe/Cider. Very tasty, but a little on the thin-side. The finish is quick--a hint of citrus tang then it's gone, unfortunate, but I would definitely drink this again."

"O - hmm.. Im sorry, but I can't put this in the fruit beer/ale category.. Even with all the apple notes going on. There is still a wheat presence and it's noticeable. It's reminds me a lot of their witbier with a big apple punch. So I can't get past that and I sure as hell don't get a fruit beer with this. Is it fruity? Well yea, but it has enough wheat going on to be just some old fruit beer. Is it world class? As world class as it can get. A damn fine brewery with an idea and they perfected it. Problem is, that's not much in terms of what it is. I love Unibroue and this isn't a complete waste. It's as good as anyone will ever get with a wheat ale with apples and coriander lol. But that doesn't mean it's an A+ brew either. Just a very good brewery with an idea. I'll drink one in spring, but I won't go out of my way to get it. My wife does love it though and she hates beer of all kinds lmao."

"D - overall acceptable and tastes but not outstanding in any way. Maybe a good transition beer to or from ciders."

""
""
""
"Would I have it again? Maybe on tap but probably not"
""
""
"I likes it. Very refreshing and crisp."
""
""
"Thanks for trying Unibroue, but this is not your best effort. If the cassis, cranberry, and peach beers were anything like this, I can see why it was narrowed down to one… but I am curious why this one. If this is the best of the four, that's too bad. Now I want to get a bottle of the raspberry. Know anyone in Quebec?"

""
""
""
""
""

"O- I think it is nice the apple flavor is not the center of this beer. The apple supports the malt, which I feel tastes like plain beer. It isn't phenomenal, but I enjoy that it is a fruit beer that isn't completely about the fruit."
""
""
""
""
"a very well made beer, certainly not for everyone, but unique as fruit beers go, since it isn't super sweet. the pour is hazy and very pale golden in color with a lively white head, fizzy and maybe pushing three inches tall. the nose is fruity like green apple skins, but not the flesh. there is very little sweetness or tartness in the nose, just sort of that apple essence. also a nice light wheat malt base and a fun bright Belgian yeast strain. the flavor is decidedly apple forward, but its like granny smith apples or something, not too sweet, not too tart, nice and clean and crisp. floral blossom apple and hop profile is more robust than anticipated, and it works well to sharpen things up. long curious finish where the yeast takes over. I liked the flavor of this quite a lot, despite what the BA community seems to think. its something different for sure, but it is absolutely artfully made whether you like it or not. awesome feel with upbeat carbonation and a fluffy but delicate texture. it really works, especially in early spring here. seems just right to me."

"Pours a pale yellow in the glass with a decent head at pour but disppates quickly - almost like a soda. A thin layer of head remains at the end - fine carbonation - and can be excited with a swirl. Smell is fruity - green apple is present and maybe some lemon or other light citrus. Taste is good - green apple is present and mutes some of the other normal beer flavors. Still good."

"A beer-drinker's fruit brew. Would be very good during hot weather."
""
""
"I’ll just note that the bottle call cellared for about a year and a half."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this beer is a little one dimensional but very nicely put together. Would be wonderful on a hot day during the summer."

"BTW, unless you have vice-grip hands, I recommend a pair of pliers to help you uncork this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- the least most complex beer i have ever tasted. Sour green apple candy. That's basically all there is in both aroma/flavor. It also reminds me of watermelon bubblegum. Luckily i love both, so i can't possible give this a bad score. I was told on the label exactly what it was, and i enjoyed every second of it. Complexity be damned, this beer is simply awesome."
"I really enjoyed this beer, the apple was a little consuming but it was still a nice easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- When taken for what it is, it's quite good. When compared to the quality and depth of beers of other styles, it falls short."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall better than I originally though it would be. More sessionable and not as sweet and sticky as other fruit beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would pick this above most hard ciders if I was in the mood for cider. Very refreshing and light tasting beer. It is a very solid midpoint between a sweet cider and a glass of champagne."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle sample. Light golden color, slightly cloudy, small white head. Ripe fruits on the nose with some white wine like aroma (Chardonnay). Baked apple flavors with some yeast. light artificial notes. No bitterness what so ever. Light body, not rich enough in malts"
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm gonna go ahead and say this was a solid beer. There wasn't a lot of flavor but there wasn't anything offputting about it and that was clutch given the lightness. I picked up on the apple and the spice. As an easy drinking beer this was on the money."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but not quite my cup of tea either. Not particularly recommended."
"After nosing this beer, the taste was a bit of a disappointment. I was hoping for some sweet and sour fruit notes to be battling for supremacy on my palate. Unfortunately, what I got was a light-bodied, apple-tasting beverage that, while refreshing and pleasing to drink, did not excite my palate or challenge me the way I had hoped."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was a tough beer to drink and I could barely finish this one 12 oz. If you want something sweet than I would recommend going for a cider, and if you want something carbonated go for champagne. This beer didn't do anything for me."
""
"This would be a good beer to drink in the summer, but no other time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not my cup of tea, shocking from this brewery. Too much fruit, like trying to spice up Bud Light with an overpowering fruit and a lot more carbonation. I would not recommend buying this, it is worth trying once (maybe), although even that I'm unsure of."
""
""
"D - I'm usually a fan of Unibroue offerings, but this one misses the mark for me... Average to below average in all categories other than aroma... This is not one that I'll be indulging in again..."
""
"Overall: Dissapointing. I don't this is like a light wheat beer with candy apple syrup poured in."
""
""
""
""
"I get more wheat than I do apple (which is a God send), but they dont mesh as well as I thought they would. Its like a yeast heavy Belgian pale (not spicy, just yeasty) with a touch of uber sweet candy apple trying to do something good."
""
"O-The nose is good but the apple notes dominate too much."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a once-in-a-while kinda beer but offers a unique and complex flavor compared to many other fruit beers, good stuff."
"Overall: Definitely different, not bad, but I wouldn't pick it up again."
""
""
""
"O - I will buy some granny smith apple cider next time. Not worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a liquid jolly rancher candy. It's sour apples throughout. I'll pass in the future."
""
""
"I think this could use more carbonation, more apple, and less funk. That being said, all in all, this isn't bad. And, I didn't do this beer any favors by forgetting about it for a year in the back of the fridge."
""
""
"Carbonation bubbles are very prickly on the tongue. There is almost nothing to the super light body on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours out a bright clear golden color, like alot of lite beers look. the head settles quickly. smell is like rotten apple juice and dirty wet rags. taste isnt any better, in fact it's worse. very medicine like, i dont think the spices compliment this beer at all. not happy with this purchase and dont recommend anyone buy it."

"Overall: not too bad. certainly drinkable but these fruit beers are just for trying to me. These arent ""regulars""."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall; A beer for cider drinkers. I liked its light mouth-fell, but lacked balance and depth. Thou cherry notes and bubblegum really stuck out on the finish, when paired with Cave aged Gruyere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good. I am not generally a big fan of sweet fruit-flavoured beers, but this is a good example of such a thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice clear amber with a fairly thick and fluffy white head. Strong, slightly sweet aroma has a firm overtone of sour apple and a hint of malt. Flavor is mainly sour apple, almost like a hard cider, with an undertone of malt and a hint of coriander. Firm-bodied texture is rather fizzy, though the fizz doesn’t go far down the pipes. Not great, but definitely worth at least a try."
""
"O: I enjoyed this interesting brew and could really appreciate it on a hot day realizing on the back porch. A deffinate summer treat that I will probably revisit."
""
""
"This is a fantastic beer for: hot days, people who like cider, and/or people who don't like beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a goblet 03-12-13. Opening this up, I get a wave of fruit smells from a few feet away, nice, up close I get apple, coriander, yeast esters. The look is a slightly hazy light orange color, with a very short lived white head. The feel is medium to light, tongue tingling carbonation. The taste is okay, apple juice and biscuit malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a stemmed weisse glass, the beer is a cloudy, opaque, yellow-gold coloring with a fluffy, white, light head of about a half an inch. The head disappears as you drink, and there was not a hint of lacing throughout consumption. This thing is pungent of granny smith apples. I can smell it being poured, and I am a few feet away. Upon closer inspection, the nose is sour-sweet granny smith apple, with a mild roasted grain backbone that can be found if you dig around a bit. Flavors are completely different from what I was expecting. The backbone is more of a roasted apple sweetness, with none of the tart that I was expecting from the granny smith nose. Slightly acidic highlight throught, with a tree and pollen highlight throughout. It almost tastes like an apple blossom smells, if that makes any sense. The aftertaste is crisp and slightly spicy, with some peppery notes. A bit on the watery side, too, leading to a slightly limp, nondescript finish. Easy enough to drink, but the flavor profile and mouthfeel are all over the place."
""
"Poured in a glass, the colour is a warm daffidile yellow, pleasant to the eye. The smell is fruity with banana & orange tones. The taste is neither bitter or leaves an unpleasant after taste. Overall a very nice beer that complements most foods, especially Indian food. Some how the spicy veggie food matches well with the sweetness of the beer."
""
""
""
"M- Light and fluffy with a perfectly petite carbonation, very dry leave. Very slight green apple and orangey-lemon in the aftertaste, kind of like Constant Comment tea."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle received in a beer of the month 6 pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, VA into a snifter. Poured a cloudy dark straw with a small white head, that dissipated quickly, but left some lacing. Smells of green apples and light malt, but the apple definitely dominates. Tastes of a more begium-style malt with hints of sour green apple, but less than what was expected. Goes down easy for a medium style with good carbonation. Overall, a decent beer, and a fruit beer that kinda surprised me."
""
""
""
"Overall- A nice take on the fruit beer by Unibroue. This is not overally sweet which makes this easy to drink and refreshing. I like the sweet and tangy/sour characteristics to this beer. Worth a try!"
""
"O-A unique beer. Lots of apple flavor with hints of bitter orange. It's a bit odd and I'm not a huge fan of the combination of flavors."
""
""
""
"DOA"
""
""
""
"I'm more in love with the smell, than the taste. This is the kind of beer that is a midway between a wine and an apple cider and beer. Give to people who like smooth, and who like wines."
"The flavors were a bit thin. It's champagne-like carbonation was welcomed and had some musty character to it. I liked the tap version better. Probably won't buy again."

"An unusual occurrence: a beer that seems pretty much average in every category. Certainly not my favorite Unibroue offering, although I see the appeal in it."
""
""
"Overall not bad. This isn't my favorite style, but I would drink this again, paired with the right food."
""
""
"O: good beer. I like the regular unflavored better though. Still good."
"Very different beer and not too bad."
""
""
""
"Overall, I give points to achieving an aroma that I've never experienced in a beer before, but at the end of the day this is still a beer and it needs to taste like one. The palate just suffers too much from a thinness of flavor and texture. As one who keeps one foot in wine as well as beer, however, I can see this having a lot of potential being paired alongside of a salad or simply prepared white fish."
"O: Pretty simple fruit beer, almost all apple. Tasty and refreshing enough though."
""
"O: This is a really good fruit beer – very refreshing and enjoyable."

"D - It's highly drinkable and I appreciate that the beer imparts a very, very fresh apple flavor. It doesn't seem artificial at all. I do think, however, that it suffers from simplicity and mediocre quality."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it reminds me of champaigne (not that I've had much champaigne). Great fruit beer. On the downside, it seems to go flat really quickly."
""
""
""
"Beer is light in body that is cut even lighter by the heavy carbonation, the fruit is all forward the finish is grainy and sweet. A mild aftertaste appears, a little acidity from the grains. I have no idea when this was bottled since I could not locate a date stamp but this bottle was typical of my experiences with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"All in all, I was disappointed in this beer. I expected a more complex and intense ale, especially considering this beer came from the same brewery that makes La Fin Du Monde, possibly the greatest and most complex tripel on the planet. This just did not live up to anywhere near those standards. In reflection this beer feels little more than a nice and light golden ale with some apple flavor and that weird cheese astringency. Not well balanced and not very flavorful. I was hoping for more from such a great brewery, but everyone falls short sometimes."
""
""
""
"O: As far as a fruit beer goes, I guess this is pretty good. Not particularly my style though."
"Meh. Not a fan of this beer or style."

"Pours a white wine/ white grape juice color, crazy amount of carbonation creating a giant head atop the glass. Smells like homemade hard cider, funky spice. Taste has a crisp apple taste and finish, its not that its bad its just that there's really nothing more to it. Light in body, fizzy, sweet and dry. This is would be an easy drinking beer if the carbonation werent coming through my nose. Pretty average if your in the market for fruit beers or lambics."

"I got this in a Unibroue sampler case. This is my least favorite of the 6 styles in the case, and the only one I wouldn't buy on it's own. All the other 5 styles are amazing."

"O) A decent beer. Mostly pleasant. I'd have another one."
""
""
"Revisiting one of the few fruited beers I didn't recoil from back in the day. I take that as a good omen for this time. We'll see: It pours a lightly foggy gold topped by a finger of steadfast white foam. The nose comprises green apples (plenty of skin involved here), light pear, wheat, banana, white grape, vanilla bean, and whipped cream. Kinda like certain scented candles I've come across, but one of the good ones. The taste brings in more of the same, with the granny smith apples really coming to the fore. The other fruits and the vanilla are cut a bit, but still make discernible appearances. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a silky-ish feel. Overall, a pretty solid fruit beer, but not necessarily something I could realistically see myself drinking all that much of."
""
""
""
""
"O - I expected more from this beer since I'm fond of other beers from this brewery, like Maudite and La Fin Du Monde, but it doesn't really command attention like the other ones. Almost watery at times, especially when it starts to warm."
""
""
"This is a good, solid ale. Simple, but not overly complex. The tartness is on the spot. It could be better, but is still worth trying."

"Nice beer. Would be nice served cold on a hot day."
"Dr: Incredibly drinkable, and with an average ABV, but still one higher than other equally drinkable fruit beers. I'd love to try it on draught. This would be a good beer to use to try to transition someone from macrolager shite or to try to get the missus to like beer. The price is rather high - at least as a US import - however."
"Wow what a unique beer. I am glad I tried this one for sure and I feel it did a great job. Although we will see if I ever pick it up again unless I have a specific pairing in mind."
"O - The Ephemere is a delightful apple flavored belgian style ale. If you like green apple flavors, you will like this beer. There should be no mistake...this is an Apple beer. If you don't like fruit beers or apple flavors, you won't like it...but if you do, enjoy!"
"O: Relatively weak flavors cannot save this beer. I would not seek this one out again."
"Split a 750ml bottle with a couple friends. Despite pouring a clear gold, it smells a bit yeasty. The beer has a smooth vanilla-wheat background, like their witbier. Over the malt is a sweet, juicy candy apple character. For a fruit beer, this has a great balance of the apple and malt. Give it a try if you like cider."
"Overall if I wanted a hard cider I would buy a hard cider it dosent really taste like a beer and it isnt even that cheap"
"Pours a hazy straw. A white 1/4"" head sticks around, no lacing. Green apple aroma immediately noticeable upon opening bottle, spicy yeastiness, some bread. Green apple forefront in the flavor, sometimes I get flavors not unlike a green apple jolly rancher. Some spicy phenols, light malt sweetness. Doesn't seem full flavored to me, sometimes I get a watery taste. Mouthfeel is medium, plenty of carbonation. Overall I have enjoyed this beer because it is different and decently executed. The green apple flavor is uncanny and fun."
"O: This is a nice, refreshing, summertime apple ale. It might be a bit too musty and musky for some, but I like it."
"O- It saddens me that I have to go to the USA for this when it's brewed one province over. This has to be one of the best fruit beers I've ever consumed."
"Overall / Drinkability: Interesting beer, but I think one is enough. The smell is really good, but the taste is a bit disappointing in comparison. The good aromas in the smell don't show up in the taste. Mind you, the taste isn't bad, just not at the same level as the smell. I suspect this beer would be best with a fruit cobbler or pie...maybe with a meal like pork, but by itself it's just okay."
"The beer is a light yellow color, and teeming with effervescence. Nearly transparent with a small white head that leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma does indeed bring apples. Spiked apple cider, apple juice, with a light helping of yeast and spice. Beer, meet apple juice. The body is relatively thin, with ample carbonation. Mild alcohol presence. A good apple fruit beer. One is plenty. You must like apples if you are to enjoy this beer."
"Overall Drinkability - May go decent with a pairing, but there's not much in the way of interesting qualities. Neither a flute nor food would probably save this beer. Sort of like the Michelob Ultra for fruit beers. Unibroue, I am disappoint."
"From the caged, corked bottle stamped 07-05-12. Sampled on September 17, 2011. The pour is a hazy, cloudy orange-amber with a foamy little head. The aromas of apples lead the way with a zingy hoppiness in the background. The body feels in the light-to-medium range. The taste is also full of apple and yeast but it is also kind of dough-like. There is a sharp sour hop bite at the end. Adequate but not my style."
"O - Overall it just isn't my kind of beer. In this awkward style I tend to review even more to my tastes, and I just don't love it. A weird collection of flavors."
"O - it started promising but this strange dusty musty taste and feel keep creeping in, just not quite up to the standard I expect from Unibroue"
"O - I probably wouldn't reach for this one again. The flavor profile was too sweet and had a fake apple quality to it."
"The body is a hazy straw color and has some yeasty sediment floating around in it. The head is perfectly white and consists of numerous, relatively large bubbles. Unfortunately, it does not last long, and little-to-no lacing is left in its wake. The smell is of strong apple juice, sugar, some spice, a bit of yeasty funk, faint straw, and some muddle earthy notes. Taste is of candy apple backed by prune juice. Really, this tastes like carbonated juice and not at all like a beer I've encountered before; all I can think about is an apple Capri Sun that thirsty children would drink during half-time of their pee-wee soccer games. The sugars from the apple and prune dominate everything except a minty, toothpaste like finish. Quite unpleasant. Mouth is crisp and well carbonated, but finishes very sticky and sugary. Overall, this is a very odd beer, and not one I'll be picking up again any time soon."
"Overall: This is a very tasty and creative brew. Pretty sweet and sour but not overbearing. Its a lot like a strong and complex apple cider but you can still easily tell its a beer."
"Finger of white froth over a hazy hue reminiscent of a pale, unripened orange. The nose is great (and ""tickly"") ... apple sweetness to apple tartness with faint coriander on top of other spices. Deep pulls reveal dark berries. There is a ton going on in this aroma, and it's all stellar -- I just don't happen to have the exotic fruit knowledge to help describe what all is there. Flavors are loaded with fruitiness, and they all stick like syrup to the back of the throat. Super heavy carbonation, maybe a little much. Apple tartness and sweet pear as well as berries. Bitterness and dry malty flavors are present. Spicy but also a tad musty. A very unique and complex beer, but not all of it works well together."
"Light, refreshing, tangy and dry all come to mind on the first few sips. Carbonation is actually not as high as I thought it would be, but is more on the medium side. An crisp apple taste is the main attraction here, but its rounded out by dryer tastes of coriander and lemon rind. Syrupy finish, but dry in the mouth feel. Overall, this is a thirst quencher, and a pretty good one at that. Decent complexity, but probably won't buy it again. Worth the try though."
"D - Delicious apple beer. It's highly drinkable. This is the first bottle that I've tried, but I had this on tap at Monks Cafe in Philadelphia a few weeks ago (as dessert). It was perfect. While on tap it might have been a bit more flavorful, the bottle is very close and stands as one of the best fruit beers I've ever had."
"O- Fantastic beer with great drinkability. Perfect for summer, but great whenever. I crave this often and have never been disappointed. A great beer."
"This beer tastes good and it is very easy to drink. I recommend it as a gateway beer for newer drinkers."
"O- Honestly, still not too sure about this one. The initial taste is overpoweringly sweet, yet finishes nicely. Appearance, mouthfeel, smell were all nice, but it's the taste that keeps me from saying it was a good beer. I'll have to come back to this one."
"Not a cider, but an apple beer. And surprisingly very tasty. Pours a hazy straw-yellow with a thick puff of white head that mellows out after a minute or so. Big aroma of fresh apples and apple skins, and not in a bad / acetaldehyde way. Light grains and herbs in the background. Tart flavor, full of crisp apples; pale malts and light sugars take the edge off a bit mid-palate. Light mouthfeel, and very drinkable. I could easily have a few of these in a session, unlike many fruit beers.."
"O – Well now its an odd one. It does not even taste like beer. Its much like champagne honestly. Its good for what it is, has decent taste but I would skip it."
"Ehhh..."
"D ~ Nice change of pace from Unibroue's beers. One of the most interesting fruit beers I have ever had."
"O - A tasty summer drink and certainly worth a try. A bit underrated IMO and would certainly be appreciated by any fan of fruit infused beers."
"This has a thin and somewhat spritzy mouthfeel and is easily drinkable but it begs the question: what's the point? I wouldn't buy this one again. Very unexciting, to say the least."
"Poured out as a hazy golden yellow color, The head was white and fizzy. There was just a touch of lacing after the head settled but not much more. The smell of the beer is great, I love the smell of the fresh apple blended with the Belgian yeast. The taste of the beer is good but I feel the apple gets a little lost in the mix. The mouthfeel is soft on the tongue but keeps its integrity with a good amount of carbonation. Overall it's a pretty good brew, I've had Apple beers that I like more, but this one seems to be the most popular in my area."
"O- This is my first fruit beer, so I unfortunately can't compare this to other of this style... I probably wouldn't go out of my way to drink this, however, this is a refreshing ale that I could see myself drinking on a hot summer day (like today!)"
"D - Delightful. Not something I could do very often, but as a dessert beer or to split a bottle with a few people every once in a while would be a treat."
"The beer was a light golden yellow with a thick white head. It smells of fresh, sliced green apples with a hint of yeast hops and watermelon. The taste is mostly green apple with Belgian yeast and banana. The beer is light and soft with smooth carbonation and a slightly dry finish. I enjoyed this beer even though the only reason I bought it is because my girlfriend wanted to try an apple beer,but the apple flavor was a little overpowering."
"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was expecting something tarter and more carbonated."
"Overall it is OK for a fruit beer."
"Overall, I did not think I was going to like this based off of the smell. But the taste makes up for the nose."
"Overall- Interesting! With the light body starting off with a Propel type of taste, the carbonation then jumps out and adds flavor/mouthfeel during the last steps of the drink. I would recommend trying this beer for anyone! Have had many times now and ready to have later tonight on-tap @ the Bridge (if I get to it)."
"looking forward to trying another unibroue selection tonight!"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite refreshing on a hot summer day."
"d. You can only have one or two, but the selantro balances it well enough to make it drinkable."
"Tasty and a fine session beer."
"Very yeasty on the palate, and a bitthin in the midpalate. The apple is there, but its nowhere near as strong as it is on the nose. This had the potential to be sweet, but it's very nice and dry and mild. The apple does contribute some tannins, and the mouth-feel is vigorous carbonation and clean refreshment. An interesting beer, for sure. I dig it a lot."
"M - In my opinion, over-carbonated. But the dry finish makes this a great session beer. Crisp and refreshing."
"Overall a decent beer and would be a good gateway beer for Sours/Brett Beers but by no means should it be in a class with them and I am glad it is not. Belgian Fruit Beer is appropriate so I am glad it isn't trying to be something it is not."
"overall, a pretty refreshing beer although quite bland in taste. light fruity aromas, some apple, nice carbonation, short finish. I don't see how it got a C+ from the bros. would be lovely when it gets hotter."
"overall? won't seek out a second time. if i'm offered it for free would i drink it? sure. again, we're not talking drainpour territory here; more along the lines of 'why bother?' - just doesn't do a whole lot for me... much better stuff out there in general, and from unibroue in particular."
"O: Just too much in the way of bubbles and not enough in the way of flavor or aroma."
"O: Overall it's a good Belgian style beer, and the apple does add to it. However, it doesn't stand head above shoulders. I would drink it again, but I probably won't be picking it up off the shelf any time soon."
"Taste is definitely apple fruity, at times it seems almost cider like if not for the distinct Belgian style yeast and spice, light and refreshing, the carbonation explodes in the mouth and fizzes away fast but I'd say it's a tad too assertive, can seem thin at times but at least it isn't cloyingly sweet like some fruit beers can be."
"O: I wouldn't go back to it, needed to try for this unibroue gamut i'm running at the moment, but doesn't stand toward the top of that list."
"Overall - No thanks. It reminds me more of a cider/sparkling white wine than an actual beer. I give it credit for trying to be different, but there is a line to draw."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Refreshing but not my cup of tea."
"O- A highly drinkable beer with great sour apple flavor. Does not taste much different than a hard cider, but does has some unique yeasty qualities."
"If it weren't an awful beer it would be extremely drinkable. It however is awful!"
"The mouthfeel is light with a good amount of carbonation. Makes it refreshing, but honestly, too light for my preferences. Overall, a good fruit beer, which honestly isn't my cup of tea. Thought I'd give it a try, and wasn't too disappointed."
"O: Bought this on a whim since I've never seen it in our grocery store. First bottle I had I hated. The second time I had it, I had it with spicy food and I think it helped. Very much like cider in my opinion so I wouldn't suggest this for those who don't like ciders or apples."
"I could imagine this one being a nice patio beer with the light drinkability providing a nice thirst-quenching power."
"The taste is quite smooth and complex. It has light apple notes mixed with alcohol and yeast."
"Wow, it's like a belgian beer was mixed with granny smith apples. Opening the bottle the apple aroma is very noticeable but it isn't the artificial aroma in lots of other beverages. It's a cloudy yellow color with some sediment. The taste is mostly apple with some citrus and floral. It's not overly sweet so it doesn't come off as overbearing like many other fruit beers. The finish is fairly clean and has the body of a light belgian. I really like this one. Unibroue seems to consistently produce high-quality brews, so I'll definitely try more from them."
"Probably would not have tried this beer unless someone brought it over to my house. I am glad I got the opportunity as it is a unique and well made beverage. Saying that I probably won't ever buy it...maybe I just didn't connect with it. I like the label...a bit feminine for beer but I suppose there should be beer for ladies too. The head was a fizzy white, the aroma was filled with apples and yeast, the mouthfeel a little fizzy a little silky. The flavor was complex with hints of apple, pear, lemon, concord grape, some bitterness in the back end. The finish lingers for just a few moments of apple flavor. It is a nice summer beer that maybe I would get for the wife...even though her impression was similar to mine: good but not remarkable."
"Overall: Subjectively, I have to say that I'm slightly disappointed with this beer. I was expecting something with more tart and sour rather than a watered down apple juice. Objectively, the beer is decent enough to drink the whole way through and the ABV is low enough say that you don't feel like an alcoholic if you drink it during the day. I wouldn't put this on my top list of recommendations but it's good enough to have cool during a hot summer/spring day."
"D - Refreshing and not overly sweet."
"D: This goes down very easily. The sweetness is the only drawback I can see."
"This is an easy drinking beer with a lot of apple flavor. It stands true to a white ale with a nice touch of sweetness. I would drink this with desert, preferably an apple pie. Cheers."
"Overall I wasn't expecting much, but I liked it.. Probably more than I should. It's a drinkable beer with enough complexity to make it interesting and a nice departure from other styles when needed."
"An easy beer to drink. Even its boldest traits don't offend. Has some good unique qualities."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Perhaps slightly too carbonated. The carbonation takes away from the apple and cider flavors. Slightly sour and bitter. Light bodied and funky."
"D: very, very drinkable; crisp apples and heavy pie textures from cinnamon, coriander, and other spices balance the crispness well"
"Cloudy golden/straw in color with everlasting white bubbly head that leaves pretty lacing. Weak aroma of sugars, apples, juice, light fruit and sour notes. A wave of flavors hits the palate: sour apples, light fruit, apple skins, slight lemon, and fruit skins in the aftertaste. Light in body with spritzy carbonation that tickles the palate. A very refreshing, fruity (but not annoyingly so) beer that satisfies that light sweet beer crave."
"T: Again a bit of a stale granny smith apple flavor with a little pepper and spice to it. Not much to this one and without a doubt, the worst Unibroue beer I've ever had."
"Head of one finger dense foam, with little lace. Color is a 6 on the SRM beer color chart. Slightly foggy. Smell, apples of course, with some trace of honey and malt. Taste is green apple, spices, wheat, malt, and a slight trace of hops. Mouthfeel is sort of on the bland side, with a little tingle form the carbonation. A change of pace, but just too sweet for any extended drinking. I would try it again."
"While this wasn't horrible -- as I feared -- it still wasn't good. Despite my reluctance, I have had a few decent, and even ""good"" fruit beers. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of them, although I suspect age may have been the greatest factor in its lack of balance."
"D - If the apple-ness of this beer sits well with you, you could hit a lot of these in a night, but beware the bubbles."
"drinkability; very drinkable, but not in a good way, more like a light beer."
"Clean light flavors of apple and spices are prominant with a clean dry-ish finish. Not much depth."
"NOT A MUST HAVE, JUST OK!"
"D- This is a beer for the right occasion, possibly as a dessert. Could be a good gateway for the friends of ours that don't like beer."
"D: This was very clean and easy to drink. It was a very nice Belgian ale that would be perfect to drink in the summer, with a superb balance of sweet and sour and tart flavors. I'm not big into fruit beers, but this was very enjoyable. Recommended."
"-And as I consider this more of a sipping cider for a summer night, (and not a cider to be compared with its more robust winter brethren..) I think it begins to do more of what it sets out to do. It doesn't seek to be heavy or especially overpowering, and I appreciate that. Does it make up for what's sometimes a rather thin taste overall? Not always, but this is one that I can (very reasonably)buy, and share during a time of year that is peppered thin with ciders. I think it adds a lot to a repetioire of sometimes heavier offerings from Unibroue, and never find myself regretting buying or sharing it."
"D: To juice like for me, just plain to sweet and bland. Really think this is one of the lesser Unibroue beers."
"Ok, first off let me say that I love almost any kind of beer. I even like Wild Blue, even though that tastes like grape soda instead of beer. But this... this is not beer. It doesn't even taste like cider. It tastes a little like sparkling white grape juice and apple juice mixed together with even less of a cheap pilsner. I drank it, and can't believe that I did, so I gave it at least a 2 for drinkability. But it tasted awful at first!"
"For a summer drink on a hot day, this might be nice and refreshing. However, I can think of a lot of other things I could drink instead in that instance. As it is there's not much going for it."
"O: once I adjusted to the strong apple flavor, I started to really enjoy this 'beer'. As fruity as a cider, but with a quite different flavor profile."
"Notes - I'm not sure if there's really wheat in it or if the coriander just makes me think of a witbeer. Regardless, it's probably Unibroue's least impressive beer, but that's not saying much. It's a tasty and somewhat subtle fruit beer. Ephemere's something both a beer geek and his non-beer-drinking girlfriend can enjoy."
"D- Not a bad fruit beer but there's not much complexity at all"
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth beer but the apple taste is way to strong and sweet for my liking."
"Drinkability - For a fruit beer it was really nice and easy drinking."
"(Edit: The bottled version isn't even close to the draft version. Grabbed some as a follow-up and they're okay, but much milder to the point of being boring...FYI. I'd give it a 3.3 or so. Not ""flawed"" but ZZZZzzzz.)"
"Overall not as bad as I had expected given the reviews. It's certainly not my new go-to beer but the brewery seems to have achieved what it set out to make. A green apple beer, that is."
"Edit - Turns out I couldn't even finish this one...the artificial, tart apple flavor eventually overwhelmed me, and it ended up being a drain pour...lowering drinkability score as a result."
"D- Very easy to drink, fruity and fizzy, slightly overcarbonated."
"Basically an apple-infused Belgian pale ale with a soft, champagne-like finish. Some may not care for it, but I enjoyed the light, sweet & fruity quality of the beer."
"D - Very high. It is very smooth and goes down easily. Good beer for a summer day."
"M - Light body, smooth. Moderate carbonation."
"I could drink a shitload of this. This is the perfect brunch beer, or would work as a supplement to sparkling cider. Very tasty."
"Overall, this is a decent fruit flavored beer. The dryness and watery body hurts the drinkability, but interesting nonetheless and worth checking out."
"Actually a quite interesting beer from Unibroue. It is a light cloudy gold with a rocky 1 inch head. Smell is a wave of apple and orange peel with a faint yeast scent on the background. Taste is of very crisp refreshing apple with a delicious belgian yeast biscuity flavor. Mouthfeel is similar to that of a saison. Very high carbonation and bite. Drinkability is lower than some beers due to its sweetness. Not bad though."
"I love several of the other Unibroue offerings and that's partly why in comparison I was so disappointed with this one. Poured about a 1/2"" head which totally dissipated. Amber. Definite smell of apples and a taste subtley apple. This beer is kind of a cheat though because they had to add the apple juice to the product to get the apple flavoring, it isn't simply from brewing with apples."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Might be a little light to have with a meal, possibly better for a dessert beer."
"D: Very smooth, it went down very easily. I don't know if I could handle drinking another immediately, but I'm not going to count that as a knock since the flavor is so strong."
"D - Well it was cool to get this so cheap and I have had it with a year or more on it and it seems the green apple flavor shines with age. Still fresh it is rather tasty. One is good for a sitting."
"D: Flavor's not bad, and I guess this is pretty good for what it is, but I'm not loving it. Refreshing enough, but it's too sweet for my taste, and the mouthfeel is just a little too uncomfortable for me to want this very often."
"Mouthfeel was good, fairly light but because of the complexity I wouldn't have more than one or two."
"750ml corked and caged, shared with a friend in 10oz snifters while watching Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Poured softly for a 2-finger head with wonderful retention, very cloudy gold. Lacing was sticky, covering 20% of the glass. Aroma consisted of Belgian yeast with slight sour apple, orange peel, and some lemon. Taste had a dry feel, and had a slight sourness, like that of eating gummi worms. Extremely dry feeling on the mouth, and a touch of candy apple. Lambic-like carbonation, slight sour apple stays on the palate from taste-to-taste. Like a half-sour Belgian. Can't wait to have this again."
"Drinkabilty - Well, nothing special here. Kind of a step up from blue moon. Its smooth , easy to drink, and light in alcohol. This could be better. More spices and less sour apple, but it is a decent enough to drink. Its very light , could drink 3-4 of these ona hot summer day for sure, but i wouldnt want to."
"Moderate carbonation but it is a light body and light colour. Big on the smells, but a restrained but well-crafted taste palette. Unlike a lot of fruit beers, this one actually tastes like beer while mretainig a strong fruit aftertaste."
"4.0 D: Not bad for a fruit beer. The base beer is pretty good and enough fruit is used to not feel watered down. Would drink again."
"D - without wanting to be sexist this beer is targeted at females.It offers very little in complexity."
"The beer pours a golden straw color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the tart apples with a little bit of bready and biscuit malt. The flavor is once again heavy on the Granny Smith apples. There is a little bit of malt, but it is well hidden behind the fruit. There is a light tartness to the beer. High carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"I poured into a pint glass to an enormous white head. This beer is pale yellow in color and looked like an adjunct until I dumped some yeast into the glass. I could smell the green apple as soon as I popped the top. I got an even bigger whiff once I started pouring. The apple obviously dominates the aroma. I think I get some malt in there, too. The taste is big on apple, as well. The finish has some spiciness to it. It tastes like some Belgian yeast. It finishes like a wit. There is plenty of carbonation. I expected it to be sweeter since I know a couple of women who like it a lot. It reminds me of a mix of hard cider and witbier. It was worth a try."
"but this one makes a good product, halfway between cider and beer."
"Drinkability - I expect an apple beer to have a stronger apple presences, this beer did not bring the full apple crunch to the table. I did not mind this beer, but not something i am looking for down the road."
"Taste is coriander and green apples up front, a bit sweet and light, then a drier, fruity-yeasty grain finish with lightly sweet grain-citrus-fruit aftertaste following. Feel is fairly lively."
"The drinkability is just fine. It's simple, if you like beer and apples, you'll enjoy it. If you like beer and don't like apples, then you may want to skip it. If you don't like beer but like apples, this could the beer for you. But if you don't like beer or apples then...go eat a pear, ya fruit."
"Overall: Decent beer overall. There's not a ton going on here but the flavor is good and it is highly drinkable. I won't necessarily recommend this beer, but if you're a fan of Unibroue, it may be worth checking out."
"D- Easy to drink, and light. Sadly it doesn't stand out to me much at all, and I highly doubt purchasing it again due in large part to it's lack of character. Not bad, but nothing too impressive."
"D: Easily drinkable."
"Overall a good beer for anyone who is not much of a beer drinker to those who like a mild, clean, very flavorful beer. I'll be back for more!"
"D: Very drinkable would like another so I shall perhaps not even share this bottle with anyone but me."
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. It's a great example of some of the more out-there things that can be done with beer. A great beer to give someone who doesn't like beer."
"Note: Generally not a big fan of this, but has some ok qualities but for as crisp as it is its not very drinkable in my opinion. I'm still fairly new to fruit beers so this may be a shining example, but if so then I should stay away."
"Highly drinkable due to the nice taste, and the light bodied crispness, not to mention the modest abv of 5.5%"
"Pours a light honey with a medium, creamy white head. Really soft look, tiny bubbles abound, good lacing. Aroma boasts granny smith apple, caramel, light hops. Kind of thin feeling, with nice green apple tones, but with cardboard on the finish that drags out a bit long. Refreshing and decent, flavor needs to be more soft and of course that classic cardboard quality I could do without."
"D-this beer is singular and messy, the malt presence seems out of whack and the green apple flavors are not inviting at all."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being above average. Drinkability is decent, it had some cool and interesting flavors to it and the crispness of the apple made it pretty refreshing. It was a bit on the sweet side and maybe a bit light on beer flavors overall though for me. It felt more like a cider or apple juice then a beer at times, not that those things aren't delicious though."
"D: While the ABV would let you drink it for a long time, the taste would become too much. I tired of this beer quickly."
"Not particularly drinkable. I would not have this one again."
"This was fun to drink, and I'd enjoy another without hesitation."
"Fruit beers are really hit or miss in my opinion. I think this is a good one because the fruit taste is very natural tasting and not over the top. Often, fruit in beers tastes very artificial, but not here. Recommended."
"This is a fine summer beer, perfect for those occasions where your beer tastes are straying toward the fruity side of things."
"I'm not a fan of fruit beers. This is one of the few I would recommend."
"A pretty good, but not great apple-beer. Apple's not my favorite fruit to work into a beer but they did a decent job. Appearance is hazy orange-yellow, not much carbonation. 1/4 inch head disappears after about a minute. Smell is nice, apples predominate. Taste is apple, smooth, malts, some zest from the coriander. Mouthfeel is quite good. It's a crisp beer good for a summer day. Goes down quite easily, but I suppose the apple flavoring might get old after a while."
"Pale gold colored brew, pretty hazy and lots of little bubbles rising to form a puffy white head. Scent is mostly granny smith apples along with some light malts. The taste is pretty complex and i cant think of anything ive had like it. Its got a wheat beer base with a light amount of tart apple flavoring, along with some spice and a bit of a yeast profile. And yet despite the layers its all pretty mellow. Kind of biting on the tongue, thin to medium bodied. Certainly a unique brew."
"I thought it sounded interesting so I bought a 750ml bottle and poured it into a Guinness pint glass. It poured light and crisp and was an applesauce in color with a light white head that laced the rim of the glass. It continued to bubble, kind of like Sprite. The aromas given off were interesting. At first it was of sweet apple and had kind of a pilsner tint to it. As the beer went on it smelled more like a granny smith, or a cider, and the coriander became more apparent. The taste too began sweet before tasting a bit sour, and like a granny smith cider. It tasted pretty good. The mouthfeel was very light and crisp. The beer was very, very carbonated and continued to be so. It didn't really dry out like I thought it would. I think that for a single beer, it's very drinkable. It's essentially a cider so I'd say it's better suited for a hot day. It was definitely interesting. It's probably worth a try although nothing too special."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium light also. This beer surprised me the flavors to me were on the mild side, but the beer was balanced fairly well. If I would have had a stronger apple and malt flavor that gave more presents on palate, I would have given it a better score."
"Drinks very well, quite obviously this beer's best quality. refreshing summertime brew that doesn't quite pass into the ""too fruity"" realm, but has plenty of fruitiness nonetheless."
"With the right food or cheese, this might pair relatively well, but I would avoid this on its own. A low point for the brewery..."
"Drinkability - Fairly drinkable though I really wouldn't care for another. This really wasn't my cup of tea. I just couldn't get over the fake green apple flavor."
"Tastes just like it smells, yeast, green apples and a little bit of cornbread."
"The body was light, but held together with abundant carbonation that had a lingering bite. It was an apple beer for sure, an a non-offensive one at that, but one's enough."
"Pours a golden orange color into an allagash flute. smell has apple corriander and orange and not too much else, perhaps some yeasty notes as well. The wheatiness sticks out in the original sip bt the applr becomes more and more apparent as it is drank. Mouthfeel is light with a wateriness to it. I could have a bunch of these and plan on using it as a segway for some into craft beer."
"This beer poured a bright amber color with a large head that stayed throughout the beer. It smelt very much like apples and like a sparkling wine. It tasted like a sparkiling wine; very strong apple flavors with just a bit of a beer like taste. Very sweet and very light which makes it very easy to drink. Overall very interesting and not bad if you like the apple taste."
"Drink - Once again another beer that I appreciate for its distinctiveness; but not my sort of thing. I can't see myself wanting more than one of these at a sitting. The back of the bottle mentions how it goes perfectly with certain foods like cheese and pork - I wouldn't mind testing out that theory"
"D: Very easy drinker, I could drink a few of these... It is a little Cider like with the amount of apple you get. This may not be everybody's kind of brew but I like the difference of these kinds of brew. My first apple brew.... and I like this one... It is a Unibroue and you really cannot go wrong with these guys."
"D- would not ever have another unless I was offered it by a friend"
"D- This is refreshing and easy to drink on a hot summer day. I am not a huge fruit beer person, but I will get this again when I am in the mode for a fruit beer."
"Drinkability- sure thing"
"D: Very easy to drink. Like carbonated juice. In retrospect, missing many beer qualities, but I really liked it."
"a great palate cleaner. and a very gentle apple quality. it's completely a crisp beer that doesn't have an lingering quality of misplace ingredients. the citrus quality was well blended between the apple sour. there is some floral quality even. this is was a clean cut beer that doesn't have much to offer but doesn't really fail along the way. i wouldn't have more than one at a time."
"drinkability - the apple flavor is strong but offset by the intense carbonation, if the carbonation was lessened, this would improve the beer dramatically"
"Had my first one of these five years ago, and thought it was too much like a green apple soda. This next meeting with Ephemere was better, offering a few more dimensions than just sweet bubbly apple beer. Still not my favorite, and not one I'd go to often, but it's solid and so damn refreshing that its drinkability is almost off the chart."
"D-Extremely high. I could easily sit and drink the whole 4 pack in under an hour, and will drink it all tonight. Not a very high ABV, great warm weather beer. Absolutely one of my top summer brews. Drink it on the hottest day of the year."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. The aromas are wonderfully refreshing. The watery mouthfeel is actually appropriate to style due to fruits that tend to thin out fermentables (BJCP) ;). A well made fruit beer."
"This beer is surprisingly good for a fruit beer."
"D- Highly drinkable mainly because the flavor and feel is not very complex. I personally like the taste of apples, but some people might get sick of it."
"Ephemere Apple is pretty good. I am not a big fan of fruit beers. But this one is well made and focused."
"Pours a golden straw hue with rich, slightly sweet yeasty smell with overtones of sour apple. The flavor is that of a mild Belgian / white ale, subtle complex yeast, a hint of sweetness, a very mild sour bite with just a hint of apple. This was very easy to drink and I was a bit sad I'd bought only one."
"D - Went down easy enough, and I could see subsituting this for a hard cider if you are looking for more of a fruity crispness to go with a meal."
"Pours a hazy yellow gold color with a thick three finger head which gives way to a skim with little to no lacing. The aroma is very good, nice green apple smell with corriander and some other fruits present. The aroma is strong and very inviting. The taste fell a little bit short, there wasnt much there. A wheat backbone with hints of apple and corriander, but after the smell i expect a more full flavorful taste. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is okay, there is nothing to really dislike, but there is nothing to make you crave more either. It needs a stronger flavor."
"D- Not one I would drink again. I was disappointed as so far Unibroue has been in my top spots for their other beers."
"I appreciate all beers within context. I had this beer tonight with a plate of pan fried apple-onion pork sausage. Fantastic. This is also a great beer to sip while resting in the shade on a hot summer morning."
"If I was going to drink an alcoholic apple beverage, I'd go with one of the many quality ciders available in my area. So I doubt I'd get this again. However, this rating is for drinkability and this one went down easily. With a 5.5% ABV, you could drink these one-for-one with most hard ciders and have the satisfaction that you're drinking a beer."
"Taste is bold sweet-tart apple flavor, general fruitiness I struggle to identify, mild spiciness, and is quite thin and finishes dry with a cidery acidity, but a sugary sticky flavor still manages to stick around. The body is thin and the carb a bit distractingly spritzy, even masking the flavor a bit. The beer wasn't bad, but I've little desire to crack open another."
"The high carbonation fits this type of beer and it makes it pretty drinkable. This is a pretty unoffensive easy drinking approachable fruit beer but not by any means spectacular."
"d - I'm a big fan of Unibroue's beers but this is my least favorite I've had so far. I wasn't a big fan of the sweet apples and mint combination...it was just too sweet for me. Wouldn't try again."
"D: Not bad but a little fizzy and the sweetness gets old. Much like carbonated apple juice. Refreshing and dry, might be good for a hot day."
"Kef"
"D - I could drink this one all day, especially in the warm summer months. Really easy to drink. This could be a good candidate to bring to a dinner party where there aren't a lot of beer drinkers."
"Mouth feel and drinkability are slightly better than average, smooth and easy going, but nothing has me running to buy a case."
"D- It is drinkable and refreshing to be sure, but other than the uncommon semi-tart apple flavor, there's nothing special about it. I have friends who ""don't like beer"" that might even find this agreeable."
"Notes: Nice light offering from Unibroue. Nothing to rave about but an enticing social quaffer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head and considerable sediment floating around. Smell is very sweet, strong apple aroma. Taste is milder than the smell, green apples with some spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Too much apple, too sweet."
"i wasn't really blown away or impressed by this beer, especially for the price tag. It wasn't exactly unpleasant, either. The high carbonation is the only real fault i could find. Otherwise a charming, tarty fruit beer."
"M/D - the carbonation combined with flavor made this an undrinkable brew"
"Light feel, but the apple becomes sour in the end, thus taking away the crispness feel. Ok drinking. may try it again later."
"D - This is a light refreshing beer wish there was more apple and sourness but overall it is pretty decent."
"D: There is nothing offensive about this brew, but there isn't really anything extrodinary or exciting either. It is refreshing after long day of work and a (seemingly) longer commute though."
"It should go without saying that you're only likely to enjoy this beer to the same extent you like tart, green apples (or at very least, to the extent you're in the mood for tart, green apples). Those who don't share that taste will certainly be overwhelmed. Comparing fruit beers to more general styles can be like, well, comparing apples and oranges - there's so many sugary, artificial ones out there. Fortunately, this is not one of them."
"Mouthfeel was medium to light. Adequately spritzy. This beer delivered what I expected."
"D: good, almost like beer and cider had a kid"
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a small white head. Smell is yeasty sour candied apples, spices, citrus, and caramel. Taste is a lot like it smells with yeasty sour apples, spices, and citrus. Light mouthfeel, high carbonation. Overall, its very drinkable, and refreshing."
"D: This beer is just OK IMO. To me it tastes like a watered down version of Delirium Tremens. It would be pleasant on a warm day or with some mild fish."
"This is ok but I'd rather not be reminded of old ladies bath products when I drink beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, and drinkability is on the higher side, but the taste is too one dimensional to me."
"D: Not really meant to be a session type beer, but goes really well with certain types of foods. The apple flavor would complement a chicken or turkey dinner well, or perhaps go well with some smoked or sharp cheese."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with plenty of quickly disappearing head. Lots of fresh cut apples after popping the cap. Apples and vinegar are ripe in the nose. A bitter sweet taste awaits the first sip. Lots of yeast available in the taste. I could sip this easily. I am glad I got the Unibrue variety pack."
"Nice offering from Unibroue."
"The creaminess and some of the apple stays with you a while after. Not exactly pleasant. Overall I don't find it that drinkable, but I will finish the bottle."
"Taste however correlates poorly. not a bad thing though, it would seemingly be sweeter but it was rather dry wit-like, citrusy and grainy at a time, grassy even, much of the coriander popping up here. discrete bitter finish. the body is a bit thin, which is the weak flank it has, but in all, this is a fab beer."
"For shame..."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a large fizzy white head that quickly fades away and leaves no lacing. Sweet and sour aroma of green apples, spices, and yeast. Taste is similiar to the aroma. Light body with high carbonation, fairly dry. This is drinkable and would make a refreshing summer drink, although if I had a craving for apple I'd probably choose a cider over this."
"D- Somewhat refreshing, but nothing there to say ""this is beer"". It's more like an apple-flavored soda."
"Ephemere-Ale brewed with apple juice, coriander and curacao. Served out of a bottle. It poured a foggy golden yellow. It smelled of caramel green apples, vanilla and coriander. It tasted of a light crisp sour apple, yeast, milky with a light lingering spiciness on the tongue. The flavors seemed too fake tasting though for my own taste. It tasted a bit too much like a green apple jolly rancher. It was reminiscent of a wine cooler with a beer twist. Do they even make beer coolers? This would be a good example. Definitely not my taste and I won't be drinking this one again."
"D - I can see this as an enjoyable choice for a spring/summer night, but it is not something I would go out of my way to get often."
"Poured a cloudy/hazy yellow into a glass with a frothy white head. Smell was faint but of spicy and sour apples. Taste was similar, earthy and floral up front balanced by some apple sweetness and spice. Decent fruit beer, not overpowering by any stretch, well balanced just nothing too special about it."
"Bottle samples-Nice beer for the summer. Foggy straw body with a small whitish head. Aromas are citrus, apples, and a sugary candy aroma. Tastes like sweet and sour/tart apples. Slight alcohol taste is present as well. A nice refreshing summer beer for sure."
"drinkability is good but i dont think i could drink more then one in a session"
"Pours a cloudy gold with a small but rich white head. The aromas are massive. Granny Smith apples practically assault the nostrils. Green apple carries over strongly on the palate, with yeast also featuring prominently. The taste is takes the label a bit too literally for my taste. It's unique and interesting, for sure, but I don't honestly enjoy the taste. Am glad to have tried it."
"Meh, I can't imagine an apple beer could be much better than this. That said, I can think of a handful of fruits better suited to brewing, and, particularly, to this beer."
"surprisingly it ends up being a bit heavy and filing in the end. perhaps that sediment is taking away more from the beer than i thought. anyway, it is a very nice beer and quite unique. well done."
"Overall, this is a nice, clean, crisp brew. The highlight of this is the green apple notes. Definitely too watery, but it is meant to be light. The curacao could play a much more prominent role here too and it would add much needed complexity."
"Overall I found it an enjoyable beer. I found it to be more of a tart fruit flavor than outright sweet. Which was definitely a pleasant surprise. Again this isn't my favorite style, but this would be on my short list if I'm in the fruit mood."
"As advertied - this is a nice crisp summer refresher. Like I said, it seems to be more of an traditional European soda...carbonation and all, which is good, but I suppose this is what a fruit/vegetable beer is all about. Just not really my thing - if I am looking for beer."
"Light on the mouth. This should be served very cold. A good beer for the Spring."
"The smell was dominated by apples of course with faint spiciness in the back. It was thin in the mouth and light malt taste that was a cross between a light beer and apple cider. Overall my wife was a fan of this but it is not my cup of tea."
"D: This is good to try once, but nothing I would have again. Came off as sparkling wine/cooler and not much a beer."
"This beer could have scratched a fantastic itch - a nice cheap alternative to those wonderful fruity lambics and geuzes. But it's not even close. Will not buy again."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/3.5"
"I finished the 4-pack, but it won't be a repeat for me. If I want a witbier, I'll buy Ommegang Witte instead."
"Pretty good for a fruit beer."
"Drinkability: This would be a perfect summertime refresher. Just complex enough to be interesting with a mild crisp fruity flavor, but not so complex as to distract from a summer open house with friends. I enjoyed this beer and would not turn it down if offered."
"I've enjoyed all the other offerings I've had from unibroue. Big fan of La Terrible. Trois Pistoles is next. Hopefully it will be a better experience."
"D - Pretty drinkable beer in my opinion. Finishes without much aftertaste which makes it easy to drink. Goes down really easy too with the lower alcohol level."
"This is good for what it is, but I am not a big fan of fruit brews. That being said it would be awesome to drink this on a hot day as opposed to iced tea or lemonade. Good for what it is, just not my particular type of brew."
"D - The flavor may get a bit old after a few, but it's certainly delicious for what it is. I could have at least two and be refreshed and satisfied."
"I poured from a 12 ounce glass into my SA perfect pint glass. A pale, hazy yellow in color with a big fizzy white head, no lace. The smell and the flavor of this is all about tart apples. To be honest that is all I smell and it is the dominant flavor, along with some spice. The finish is sweet and lingering. The beer is light and fizzy. This was a nice change of pace for me even though I do not see myself buying it again. If I want apples I will reach for cider, not beer."
"It was good. Not great, not special."
"Overall it was fairly interesting and quite drinkable. Given that there is secondary fermentation involved, I am somewhat interested in picking up a few more bottles, to try it both fresher (my bottle was sitting around for a few months) and aged a little bit longer."
"Atmosphere is okay. Appearance is pretty average, nose is very fruity and pleasing. Flavor is not what the nose projects, and the feel is a little off-putting. Overall, this is a pretty average quaff. I guess it's okay just for something different."
"Mouthfeel is decent, but the taste keeps this from being drinkable in my book. Sorry unibroue, but no thanks to this one."
"D: This beer didn't do a lot for me. Pretty much a nice Wit that's had a dose of apple added to it. I'm glad I had it, but doubt I'll be back."
"Value: Pricey."
"Pours to a light golden yellow. Aroma of sour apples fills the nose immediately, followed by some alcoholic notes, and a little curacao. Flavor has a bit of a stale apple character. Mouthfeel is kind of like champagne, rather bubbly. Smooth and slightly bitter. But overall decent."
"Drinkability - It tastes like a fruit beer - in this case green apple, slightly tart rather than sweet like apple cider - a combination of beer qualities and cider."
"If you are reading this review and want to try it please take the 3 other beers that I have."
"Overall, this is pretty awesome as far as fruit beers go. Though the fruit is the main component of flavor and aroma, it's not overly sweet or sour. One or two would probably be enough."
"Cloudy with a great apple aroma about it. It quite simply is my favorite apple flavoured beverage at this point. Creamy head without an overwrought carbonation like most ciders. The malt seems to balance the apple beautifully. If you like cider, you'll love this beer!"
"Very straight forward and one dimensional. I like apple, but this beer reminded me a lot of Strongbow cider with more pronounced apple."
"Now that that's out of my system, let's get serious. At the Coppermine Pub in North Arlington, this poured a cloudy yellow/orange into a Chimay chalice with two fingers of bright white head. The head collapsed rather quickly though, and laced a little on the spotty side. The smell...gee, let me think...apple??? YES...green apple, but not limited to green apple; caramel, passion fruit, oakiness, and some smokiness also come to the fore. This aromatic mix was a little surprising, so I couldn't wait to sip it. In tasting, the apple and passion fruit hits you first, and then dissolves to a surprising mid-palate vanilla/oak/tartness, and then finishes on a sweet/smoky note. Very surprisingly complex for a style of beer which is typically one-dimensional. The feel was very carbonated/spritzy, but fairly thin. In summary, I couldn't help but think that next summer I will stock my fridge with plenty of this, for the long days of working in the yard. Also a great beer to appeal to both sexes if you're having a party or dinner guests."
"D - Can't do it. Just can't drink this horrible brew."
"The taste is horrendous. It has no flavor of apples or sweetness, its flat and tastes like a wanna ba sparkling water. The end is fuzzy and blah. A very poor effort all the way around. Mouthfeel poor and not drinkable at all."
"Since I started brewing, my tastes in beer have changed considerably. Until today, I hadn't had this beer, or any Unibroue beer, since I began brewing. Most beers now leave me greatly disappointed, even the ones I used to love (e.g. Bass Pale Ale). This beer, however, is still a masterpiece in my eyes. I hope I still feel the same about the rest of the Unibroue lineup..."
"This beer pours a cloudy,hazy honey hue with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger head and mimimal lacing,it has aromas of spicy belgian yeast,apples and pears,it has an above average mouthfeel with nice tastes of spicy,yeasty apples that really dominate this but suprisingly the apple plays the costar in this brew with that classic belgian yeasty unibroue taste being the most prevalent taste but i also get a little apple juice right at the end,not a bad beer but not one i could drink all night."
"Notes - Not a very fruity beer this one only had green apple notes in the nose. Other than that, it's a pretty straight forward blond ale."
"Pretty light and refreshing, the carbonation seems a tad weak, but overall I felt the flavors were decent, albeit the coriander was a bit much. Not a bad beer per say, but underwhelming particularly considering the $10 for a four pack price tag."
"D- I really enjoy this fruit beer. Granted I couldn't drink this all the time, but I do enjoy trying to pair this guy with food from time to time. Easy to drink a bottle, especially with someone else."
"D = One of the better fruit beers I've had, but still I'm not a fan of the style. Nevertheless, entirely drinkable, and certainly appropriate for the crisp fall weather. Not Unibroue's best, but better than most."
"Overall, pretty much tastes like fizzy apple juice, not very complex or particularly enjoyable, not may favorite Unibroue offering."
"D - For a fruit beer this is one of the better ones out there good taste thats pretty easy to drink its worth a try sometime"
"The body is about what is expected for a Wit. Drinkability is excellent, even better that the base beer (Blance de Chambly), smooth, crisp and refreshing this is an excellent change of pace beer. Certainly worth trying."
"The color is golden brown, and the beer is very cloudy. There is little head that quickly dissipates. Notes of nice sour apple can be detected when sniffed. Sweet notes up front, then a nice green apple flavor, followed by a very sour note. Highly carbonated. A very good fruit beer, if that is your think. Although the apple flavor novelty could wear off quickly, this is a drinkable brew."
"Overall I feel as though this is aggresively marketed toward the fairer sex. It's a decent beer but it seems more like a tainted La Fin Du Monde than anything. Worth a shot if you're into fruit beers."
"Pours medium/light golden with a very slight cloudiness. Very slight head that disappears very quickly, leaving no lacing at all. Aroma is probably this beer's strong point. Apple tartness predominates, but doesn't overpower. There are other herbal hints here, with a sort of minty presence easily detectable. Disappointment creeps in when it comes to taste. Apple notes are extremely subdued; I expected something much bolder. There is a continuing mint/herbal presence on the palate, along with the faintest maltiness. Perhaps some sort of cinnamon/coriander character might have been more complementary here. Underwhelming is probably the most fitting description. Mouthfeel is acceptable, with a decent level of carbonation, and a pleasant smoothness. Overall, not a bad brew, but I always expect a little more from a top notch operation such as Unibroue."
"Drinkability: As with many fruit beers, it's a bit sweet for me to have more than one or two in a sitting."
"DRinkbale OK but I really have to question if the line between beer and Cider has been crossed here."
"I have never been a big fan of fruit beers but I do enjoy this one. The tastes are so subtle, not too sweet, not too fruity, but a terrific balance in between. I like the the hint of sour apple and the blend of hops. The aromas coming from this beer do not hint at the flavor to come. Nice body which makes it quite drinkable but not a session beer at all."
"D: dare i say it might be a chick beer... seems like a beer you should sip, like a white wine, but you just want to down it to get more effect."
"Don't drink and review."
"Serving type: bottle"
"As someone who certainly enjoys mixing it up with a fruit beer now and again, i really enjoyed this beer. I find that a lot of fruit beers unfortunately taste like wine coolers and or juice; this beer certainly does not have this problem, it tastes like a beer. Another highly palatable beer from a great brewery, Cheers Unibroue!"
"Cheers!"
"A large, quickly expanding almost pure white head finishes off above the rim in a flurry of tiny bubbles which shine in the light. After hesitating for a few seconds it fades calmly until only a thin layer of froth is left behind. Very little lacing is seen. Color is a greenish orange, kind of like apple juice. Smells big on the fruits up front with some vinegar in the background. Apples, apple rind, coriander and a splash of orange float to the nose upon closer inspection. Very promising so far. Tastes involves more coriander, green apples, sweet apple juice, and a bready base. Light bodied and highly palatable but tasty. One of the best ""fruit"" beers I've ever had. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it."
"MF&D - the body is well carbonated, but it is just a bit too thin for my tastes. Its a good beer, but not really my thing. maybe for the lady, but not enough apples for me to want to finish the bottles."
"D: Pretty drinkable for sure."
"Clean and refreshing it finishes with a nice crisp finish."
"Drinkability: high level of carbonation reduces drinkability, but it is quite refreshing and I think would be quite drinkable in warmer weather or with hotter foods."
"I like that this is not overblown with sweetness. It has the fruit acidity and character, but it's blended with a pleasant wit base, leaving it clean and crisp, not heavy or sickly. This is a fruit beer done pretty well - the apples lend some extra character to an already decent beer, but don't dominate the flavour."
"i will admit this one caught me off-guard i enjoyed the taste and smell much more than i thought i would"
"D- At first I thought the sweetness was going to become a problem, but this actually was rather enjoyable for a fruit beer. I don't see myself getting this again, but it is definitely worth a try."
"M/D: there is a lot of carbonation that went into this beer and it still feels watery to me and does not stimulate the tongue much. It's a decent brew to drink but I will not be purchasing again."
"The bottle says it is best before 2011. Maybe I should have waited a little to see what the bottle conditioning does. I love Unibroue but not this beer."
"For a fruity beer this is actually quite impressive, I'm not usually a fan. It still retains enough beer qualities to keep it from being designated a beer-like cider. I don't think I would buy this again but would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fruity brew (especially if you plug your nose)."
"Some fruit beers are one and dones, but this holds the apple back and just introduces it to you, making it a drinkable brew. Its clean and crisp, and that makes you want to have more than one."
"Overall, i'm glad i tried it but I won't go looking for it"
"Overall, a good beer and I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: High. Could it be any higher?"
"This is a fairly drinkable beer. It's nice on a hot day, but don't expect much in the way of complexity in flavor or smell."
"Very bubbly with lots of carbonation. I'm not sure how to classify this one. It was interesting to try but I can't see myself drinking this again. If you absolutely have to have a beer that tastes like apple cider, well they got that dead on but I can't remember when I've ever had that type of craving..."
"Drinkability: The low ABV and wonderfully powerful apple flavors combined with the mild yeastiness and spiciness makes for a nice beer and a pleasant change from a huge beer... Easily sessionable and I have to admit, I like the mouthfeel because it does something a little different than other beers that simply dry or leave a coating."
"I'm glad I tried this, but I won't ever buy this again. Just fizz water that tastes like it has green apple Jolly Ranchers in it."
"it's very carbonated. the mouthfeel is bubbly. it's drinkable."
"MF/D: Carbonation is spot on, however the totality of the apple is a little big..."
" Had this on tap in AZ for 3 months and it was excellent. Moved to Australia and my GF bought me a 6 pack and I could not finish it. Too metalic and only saving grace is the brewery and that I have had it on tap beforehand."
"I loved the Cassis while I was at the Mondial de la Biere in Montreal. We picked up some local brews before heading back to the states and since I am a fan of nearly all of the other UniBroue beers I have had I thought I would give this a try. I'm not really sure what to think of this. First impression is that the scent of apple is way too overpowering, it's like they are trying to hard to remind you that they made a beer with apples. The taste is also nothing impressive. It tastes like they mixed bad cider with a bad belgian ale and neither characteristic is particularly pleasing. There is almost no body to this beer and it drinks like a can of flat soda. I probably wouldn't drink this again."
"Éphémère was more like fruit-flavored club soda than beer and not something I'd seek out again."
"I got a tulip-shaped glass of this stuff from the bar down the street that has about 36 beers on tap at all times. It's quite unlike any beer I've ever had. By the time it got to me it only had a thin head left and was very cloudy and hazy. Very yellow. It really gave off some apple fumes. Apple was the biggest odor by far. Maybe some earthy wheat also. The flavor was overpowered by Apple. More the sour apple flavors associated with cider and not the sweet types. Kind of Granny Smithy, I guess. The other flavor was wheat beer. Spiced cloves and sour apples in a semi-thick brew. It's not bad. It's just unusual and definitely a novelty. Easy going down but not what I'd like to drink all night."
"Figured I should try this at some point for the hell of it. Pours deep honey-golden. Lots of bubbles and carbonation. Smells like muted apple flavoured graham crackers. Taste... this to me basically tastes like slightly apple-flavored tonic water. Just lots of bubbles, and a lot of blandness. Extremely carbonated, super bubbley, but no depth behind it. Drinkable if you like this sort of thing. This has to be the most bland beer produced by Unibroue. The few that will like it will love it, but most people expect better from them."
"(D)- At 5.5%, this is an easy drinker for the most part. Super light, delicate, and exceedingly carbonated. A cool beer to serve to wine freaks w/ appetizers if you happen to be entertaining! They wont believe its beer they are drinking! If you dont like super dry beers or wines, then this probably wouldnt be for you."
"Pours a cloudy honey with a soft head that fades quickly. The nose offers a very pleasan mix of spicy vanilla and tart green apples. Also a little it of coconut in there. Very enticing. On the palate it is slightly sweet but more tart and acidic from the apple flavours. Quite highly carbonated, finishes long and dry. Not a session beer but a good beer for every now and then."
"M + D: It comes close to having the sparkling mouthfeel that many of Unibroue's offerings have, but ends up being a bit sticky. It also seems somewhat heavy for what it is - that's not to say it's really weighty, it's just a notable medium body when I was expecting something a little more delicate. It's not the heaviest in alcohol, but it seems this one wouldn't have been bad if it were a little lighter in flavour and alcohol."
"Overall, it ain't tops by any means, but damn, I could down 'em."
"Very crisp, easy to drink on a hot day after cutting the lawn. Very refreshing, and definitely prefer to this to an American adjunct (in response to a few recent threads and forum posts tehehe). Some orange zest that I'm picking up, and a nice belgian yeast strain all culminate to produce a nice easy drink."
"D - This goes down well. It is not overbearing and is enjoyable enough to drink. Unfortunately, it lacks depth and interest to make this something you want to drink much of."
"Drinkability? Not good. The flavours aren't doing anything for me and neither is the mouthfeel. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it by trade as I think paying for it would not have been a good thing."
"D- I can imagine drinking any more than one of these flavors are just kind of odd."
"drinkability: I was pleasantly suprised. not a lambic or fruit beer. Like I said it was more liek a wit with different flavors. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability - Could be drinkable but not something anyone will be considering."
"Pours a very nice cloudy yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice fizzy/foamy two-finger plus white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, nice notes of apple, and mint. The taste is malty/yeast, highly carbonated, with some apple/mint notes. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, but would not buy again, very nice nose, but the taste is so so."
"Golden color with moderate white head. Definite apple notes in the aroma along with light malt and spices. Yes, to me the apple is of a Granny Smith or maybe even a Fuji. Smooth, pleasant beer and very good on a warm day/evening. Body is light along with carbonation. A good effort in this category. The apple is not overwhelming, and to me that is a plus."
"Very underrated beer. I think this might be my favorite Unibroue beer yet. Highly drinkable, great flavor and original. I can count on one hand how many fruit beers I have enjoyed, and this one ranks with my favorites."
"D. One of the better fruit beers I've encountered. Has a definate apple cider meets belgian brew characteristic, and I was happy it was an actual beer and not fruit soda."
"Very unimpressed. I expected a lot more taste and pungency in the nose."
"Cheers!!!"
"I am a huge fan of the 'La Fin Du Monde' by the same brewer. This is a very good fruit ale."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours cloudy with tight carbonation bubbles climbing the length of the glass. The tart green apple smell was the best part about this beer. Overall average taste. Refreshing, but it didn't have any flavors that stood out. I wish it had more of a yeasty bite or some honeyed grain to compliment the apple aroma."
"D: Sorry guys, I have loved everything I have ever tried from this brewery, and this one simply does not stand up to the rest of the line up.. I think it is a little too funky for me.."
"D 4.5 - Excellent examle of a unique apple brew. If you are open minded on fruit beers, and like sour apple, than this brew is a must try."
"D: The high carbonation makes it more of a summer brew, but I could see saving a few for winter nights around a warm fire."
"Drinkable. Try it and decide for yourself."
"Quite refreshing for a sunny, brisk spring day, it went down quickly, daring me to have another. The apple character comes across as subtle and musty, but does well to imbue this fruit beer with a particular elan."
"D - Moderate, the smooth mouthfeel and pleasant taste, yet lightness would offer someone a good sessionable brew given that they like green apples enough. The abundance of green apple and slight lingering aftertaste of bitter would limit the drinkability for me."
"Future outlook: I've yet to have a bad beer from Unibroue, and this is no exception...though this one is a bit more on the outside of what I typically want from a beer."
"D - Not a beer I would ever drink again. I used to hate fruit beers and this is a prime example of why. Vile swill."
"D- an excellent thirst quenching wit, although fruit flavors generally deter me from drinking for than one or two. i've been putting this one off for awhile, but i'm glad i finally found a single. unibroue kicks ass in all departments."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could share a case of this with the girls and boys to make both of them satisfied. Unique and complex."
"Drinkability: I could enjoy this beer anytime/anywhere. It would be great with food and even better in the Fall. I look forward to tasting this again."
"Purchased in a mixed mystery 12er...most reviews cover this well. 1.5"" head that dissipates quickly. Apple jolly rancher followed by yeasty finish. Light, zesty, refreshing but leaving me wanting more from this beer. Average, probably wouldn't buy this beer again."
"Fruit/vegetable beer style is not a favorite style of mine; however, this is my favorite of the style to date. Anyone that is a fan of the style should enjoy this ale."
"Pours a golden orange with a thick head that quickly died out. Smells like spiced apples and yeast. Initial flavor is very green apple with a belgian coriander spice somewhere in the background. There are some other fruity flavors in there maybe strawberry. No noticeable hop or bitterness. It was a little bit watery feeling. Excellent flavor."
"Drinkability - Sweetness prevents this from being more drinkable, but it is still quite enjoyable."
"Although this is a perfect spring/summer beer, I couldn't see myself drinking more than one of these in a sitting as I find similiar novelty type beers best when enjoyed singularly."
"An alright brew..."
"M - Crisp, bubbly, medium bodied."
" I have been sitting on this for a nice Spring day like this. nice choice."
"D - A good beer but it seems to be missing something and doesn't quite come together for me. I think I'd like more sour or something else to fill out the flavor."
"This is much less offensive than the Chambly I just drank. Taste is all sour apple. There is a very large amount of carbonation in this beer, but it works well with the flavors and style. Not something I could drink alot of, but different."
"Pours hazy light golden with a tightly beaded head and some light lacing. Smells a bit like a dusty apple jolly rancher. The taste is somewhat similar. Grainy and with some artificial sour apple flavors and a slightly washed out finish. Heavily carbonated and somewhat creamy. Not for me really."
"Overall - It almost feels like slightly darker light beer with apples and coriander. It's certainly not terrible, but the flavors are so unbalanced it doesn't make for a memorable experience."
"D- For a fruit beer it's a solid brew."
"d - this is probably a one-time trial for most of us seeing as it is a fruit beer from a belgian brand. I dig the belgian take on a hard cider but the odd mouth foaming throws off my drinkability score. If it settles down more by the end of the glass I'll update my score but I doubt that will happen."
"Admittance--this is NOT my thing. I loved Apple Jacks as a kid, and that was that, with not an apple to speak of since... still, pours a ncie, golden body with a thin yet consistent white head, with effervescence showing this to be a lively brew... intensely tart darts of apple, windblown with a fresh cut of wheat... easy drinking, clean body, light to medium and slightly bubbly on the tongue--swift start to finish.... apple tart is unmistakeable... secondary flavors built off that clean, crisp, unfiltered effervescence.... as a filler in the case, not bad... I must reiterate, I mean no disrespect to the brewer, and have found more than a few silly beers that shipped faux fruit along with its malt and hops, but this is tastefully done..."
"Gave this brew a try last evening. Bottle said drink before 1/10/10. The brew poured to a slightly cloudy yellow color with a fair sized white bubbly head that broke down very quickly, the bubbling action reminded me of champagne, I got no real lacing to speak of. Strong apple aroma, my wife was feet away of my glass and she asked me ""are you drinking a fruit beer?", when I said yes it has apples in it she said ""thats what I smell!"" So that gives a good perspective of the aroma profile that dominates. Also there is a spicy zest in the aroma that is clear from the coriander, curacao and the yeast that is used. The flavor also has a strong apple presence that gives it a slight tart feeling. This brew does not seem like most wit's as the coriander is not noticeable till the very end. The end seems to be quite dry. Has a nice zest to the feel as it prickles the tongue. Clearly not my favorite brew from Unibroue but overall pretty tasty, more of a summer drinker, but based on the price I am not sure i would really get this one again based on what else is out there."
"D= pretty high. Average beer that's a little weird and unique."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, there are a few sour beers that I like and this one definitely is not among them."
"D- From the aroma I was worked that this beer would be another all artificial flavor candy wheat beer, but the flavor was much better than I expected. Nice sipping beer and I would like to try pairing it with some desserts but alone one was enough, mostly due to the aroma."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. pours a straw yellow with maybe a touch of gold and orange. it almost looks a little green too when held up to the light. a nice soapy head that faded to nothing very quickly. the nose is mostly that of green apples with maybe a little bit of spice as well. fairly light mouthfeel with some medium to high carbonation. little bit of lacing. the taste is pretty decent, could be a little better though. mostly you taste the green apple up front with some nice belgian malts. just a touch of the belgian yeast coming through, i thought there would be a much stronger taste and smell of the yeast like most unibroue's. it finishes nicely with a slight bite on the tongue and a somewhat lingering taste of apples. the drinkiability is a little above average due to the fact that the apple isnt too overwhelming like a lot of fruit beers and the moderate to low ABV. i would prolly not seek this out again, but every other unibroue ive had was amazing, this one kinda of falls short a little bit."
"Huge white foam like a sink full of dish liquid bubbles, the pale yellow gold color has streaks and markings similar to sand art. Without surprise, the apple comes through clear as a bell in the nose, the coriander to ginger spice delicate enough to avoid muskier clove side, citrus breeze of orange and lemon, yeast onto raw pie dough and a vague nuttiness. Light-bodied, presence carried almost exclusively by the enthusiastic carbonation. The lemon, orange citrus much more present here, if not an iota sweeter. While decidedly green apple in profile, there's yellow and Fuji apple too. The coriander, cinnamon-led spice washed out some by said carbonation. Straw, hay more sweet than bitter. That said, there's a light pucker in store for you as it finishes. Very little aftertaste or retronasal action. A decent offering, naught more."
"D: I wouldn't plan on having more than one of these in a single sitting, although I think it could be a decent pairing with an apple dessert."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a light golden color with two fingers of fizzy head that disappears quickly. Smells like I dropped a bunch of jolly ranchers in a wheat beer. Taste is similar to the smell, all the body of a wheat beer with a green apple taste. Light mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable. The least impressive beer I've had from unibroue yet."
"D-I would love to drink this brew on a hot July afternoon. In the winter, it seems a bit off. Regardless, a quite drinkable brew, enjoyable overall and in its effectiveness in framing the apple within a light Belgian-style ale."
"M/D - Light bodied and very well carbonated, a pretty easy drinking brew if you can deal with the off apples taste, it seems to get better as you go, but if you don't like it, you won't like it kind of a thing"
"Fair. Goes down easy but I don't know if I'm going to grab another."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 3/4"" white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Meringuey head lasts and lasts, with plentiful chunky lace. Aroma is green apples and spices. Taste is light, with echoes of the nose. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, with pretty easy drinkability. Could have a bit more substance, but still a nice brew."
"This is a good basic fruit beer, classically Belgian in style and character. It is cloudy due to being unfiltered, and pours with a nice head that is pretty well retained over the greenish amber color. Like other refermented beers fro Unibroue, this one has a crisp sparkling mouthfeel that dominates in the mouth, but the pronounced apple flavor comes through, even though it is very subtle in the bouquet. Very soft finish, with little aftertaste, the main lingering sensation is from the high carbonation. Nice for an occasional occasion, but not a beer that I will drink regularly."
"The taste is certainly of tart green apples, but it is of more of a watered-down cider nature. As such, mouthfeel is thin and a little astringent. The coriander the bottle mentions is just barely there, near the finish. This is an interesting beer to try, though not one I'll likely revisit."
"Overall a very good beer. At first it seemed like a Blue Moon knock off with a little twist, but it was someone else that told me the beer had apple in it. Couldn't quite put my finger on that taste."
"D-Might start to feel like smirnoff ice after a few of them but it is easy to consume in non binge drinking quantities."
"D- I've had this a couple of times now and, while it's not the best offering from Unibroue, I would definitely do it again."
"This isn't my favorite beer, and I may not even buy more, but I think it's phenomenal for its style, hence the high marks."
"Mouth: Green apples, sweet and lightly tart, shroud a fairly typical witbier flavor profile consisting of banana pith, eggnog, and coriander. Carbonation is very very high, which is limiting the drinkability as I struggle to sip without getting the pop-rocks-in-cola feeling. The bubbles are too coarse for a Belgian style beer as well, making it too prickly on the palate. Not bad, just needs some refinement."
"Drinkability: I liked this beer. It's very easily sessionable, and I would likely buy this again. It's my first Unibroque beer, and it did not disappoint."
"This is an average beer, probably the weakest offering I have tried so far from Unibroue. Although I could drink lots of it since it feels as though its seltzer water."
"Drinkability- Not my favorite, but novel."
"Nice example of the style, though truly a style within a style..."
"Drinkability: I would have this again...It tastes like a beer/hard cider mix, but there is enough of a beer taste to it."
"I don't want to repeat too much of what has already been said, so I just want to add on that in addition to the granny smith apple juice taste, I actually tasted hints of some sort of medicinal flavor; mainly in the aftertaste. It was hard to put a finger on because it was somehow a familiar taste, but that was actually what sort of ruined the flavor for me overall. It was still fairly drinkable, but the smell was the highlight for me. This is the only apple flavored beer I've had to date and with that being said it is still decent and worth trying."
"Overall - Fantastic brew."
"At only 5.5% abv, there is nothing here to draw me back. If I have an urge for something like this, I'd rather have a cider."
"D_Hardly any alcohol taste, feels like Welch's. Taste is a little strong, don't want to have too much more"
"Overall, this was a pretty easy to drink beer. It was a little bitter, but that was expected and it wasn't too overwhelming. It was a nice change from the regular beer. I'd recommend at least a try of this beer."
"D - very good if you like granny smiths, but avoid if you don't like them or sour things"
"(rated Feb 8, 2007)"
"Very easy to drink, had it with currywurst and apple sauce and it went great with the meal. Had no problem drinking the pint and would have asked for another if it weren't for work in a few hours."
"D: An interesting little fruit beer, it had enough flavour to keep it interesting through the glass. A nice change of pace, though I'm glad I got the 12 oz. instead of the 750 - I don't think I could drink that much."
"As with a cider, this would go great with a pork dish, but I think it could complement most meals."
"Now it was rather tasty. Great balance between the spices and the fruitiness."
"Pours hazy yellow with a huge white head. Granny Smith abounds in the nose, like a cider. Light, bubbly mouthfeel that tends to get too bubbly and make the beer a bit acidic. Tart apples and spice throughout, with some pear flavors. Lots of fruit, not much beer, but good."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with hints of orange, with lots of sediment left in the bottle, and a big puffy white head. Booming nose of green apples paired with sweet malt and that classic Unibroue yeast character. Much of the same carries over into the flavor, slightly tart and cider-like with hints of acidity and mild oxidation, sweet pale malt, and a dominant yeast presence. Grainy in body, this beer is definitely on the decline, when fresh the green apple flavor is alot more pronounced and refreshing, the carbonation has slowed down alot as well. One of my favorite ""flavored"" beers when fresh, but make sure you check the date..."
"D - Drinkability is good. I can see where this would be a very refreshing choice on a hot summer day. The apple flavor works well for the style of beer Unibroue has paired it with. Really kind of shocked at how quickly this beer tends to disappear. Alcohol is almost completely hidden and really helps with this category alot. Another good brew from the guys up in Canada. Glad I got the chance to try it."
"This one is definitely skippable. If I ever pick up a Unibroue variety pack again I'll keep the La Fin Dumonde's for myself and give this apple junk away to a friend(or enemy)."
"Notes: It is just fine and a possible alternative for people who don't like the ""big"" beers offered by Unibroue."
"Really disappointed in such an expensive beer."
"Pours a golden yellow color, very hazy with a huge fluffy white head with good retention and lacing. Smell I actually enjoyed. It was a combo of a typical Belgian (yeast and bread) with a hint of Granny Smith apples. Actual Granny Smiths. The smell wasnt too dominating which I was glad. If the apple smell was too strong I guarentee I wouldnt have liked it. The taste wasnt too good I thought. It tasted like a very bland wheat beer. There was a nice apple aftertaste, but wasnt really enough to save it. Overall very boring. Mouthfeel was light and somewhat crisp I thought for it not having the highest carbonation. Overall a unique beer, and good for a fruit beer, but I've had several better."
"Pours a very cloudy yellow with a large head and lots of ascending bubbles. Not much for lacing but a thick head retains throughout. Smell is of full on green apples, taste is the same and has a bit of a sour kick to it. Quite an odd beer but I enjoyed it. For such a prestigious brewery I was expecting a bit more taste, as this compares to almost a Magic Hat #9 or Harpoon UFO Raspberry/Blueberry in terms of body/mouthfeel/drinkability. Not bad, but I'm sure they can do better."
"Second pour from the large bottle had plenty of yeast, vigorous tall head again but much the same overall impressions. Maybe fruit beers aren't going to be my favourite; this is worth a try but didn't particularly win me over."
"Truly something different on a hot summer night."
"For those looking for a bneer for a wife, or ggirlfriend this is the beer you will want to try!"
"I love Unibroue, and I have really enjoyed this mix pack. However, I really wish they had left this one out of the mix."
"i had it. won't ever have it again."
"Overall, this is a brave, polarising kind of brew with unique characters and a very refreshing feel to it. All I can really say is, thank God it's Unibroue who made this one, because they really handle a potentially god-awful beer with an expert touch."
"This is officailly the worst beer ever. I have never had to pour anything down the drain until right now. I drank half the glass to see if things might get better, but no. I cannot beleive Unibroue would put their name on something this bad. The appearance probably deserves a 3, but everything else was so awfull I had to drop it to a 1. The nose is of artificial apple candy. The taste is a horrible blend of malts and artificial flavoring. Body is syrupy and over carbonated. Stay away from this stuff."
"There's nothing going on here other than the apple. Where's the malt? Tastes like alcoholic apple water. Just don't get this given Unibroue makes some mighty tasty stuff. Who fell asleep at the wheel here?"
"D - Not bad but I was expecting it to be sweeter which would have helped a ton. Also there is way to much carbonation to be enjoyable"
"D - this is refreshing beer that would be good for summer drinking"
"In a way, this reminded me of a scented candle - pleasant aroma - a bit overbearing on the main scent, in this case apple - but, something you want to imbibe? Not really. Well, I may be exaggerating a bit, as it has ""some"" drinkability. I became close to finishing the bottle. Artificial-ish green apple becomes too much in a 750 ml bottle. Not the refresher I was hoping it would be."
"D - Very good but a little to sweet and sour to drink too much. One is good."
"This to me is a beer you have for novelty or bring to a party so people can try something different."
"Fruit beers aren't my favorite to begin with, but apple is definitely on the bottom of the list in terms of fruit flavors that I enjoy in beer. If apples and fruit beers are your thing, you'll probably love this. Me, not so much. This became a drain pour for me unfortunately; more because I couldn't stand the jolly rancher smell, and didn't like the taste enough to drink it quickly and be done with it."
"[Mouth] Very refreshing and excelent body, sweeet, the taste is nice and fresh, the head is creamy and the aftertaste is fruity"
"A tad light in the mouthfeel, but otherwise very complex and drinkable. A unique brew in every respect."
"Medium body at best, average mouthfeel and no detectable alcohol...a bit boring sums it up for me. Next."
"Overall, it's a really great beer. I highly recommend. For me, I could see this as a several time a year beer. Maybe mix it into my 3-4 wits that I constantly cycle thru. Might get too sweet after a couple so not a true session beer but close to it for me."
"D: Pretty decent beer. It reminds me a lot of a cider without being one. It still has that beer flavor to it and isn't too crazy when it comes to the apple. I could and would drink more. Girlfriend loved it, but then again, she loves ciders. Good crossover beer."
"Out of the bottle this beer produced a huge, pillowy eggshell white head of tiny bubbles. Great retention and nice lacing. Hazy straw colored liquid. A very nice looking beer in every way. Delicious aroma of crisp apples, some spices (coriander) and floral hops. Pronounced apple flavors live up to the aromas promise, subtle malts appear first but are quickly quashed by the fruit flavors, then followed by the crisp hops. The hops provide a green apple like character. Quite sweet almost as though it were a hard cider. High carbonation in an otherwise light beer only adds to this impression. Is it a good beer? No. Is it a good hard cider? Yes. Is it a good way to get girls drunk? Hell yes. Expensive but worthy of this cause."
"Flavour is zippy and spicy with the coriander and clove coming to the forefront. Sweet, but not overly so, with a light fruitiness. Lots of funky yeast as well, with a bit of breadiness. Simple and well balanced. Mouthfeel is a little watery for my liking, but it's summery, light and not overcarbonated. This is a hot day's tipple that's drinkable in quantity. An enjoyable and not overstated apple beer."
"D- hard to say. It is a session beer but the flavoring could hinder the ability to pound them back. Easy to toss down though."
"Very smooth, certainly refreshing, and pretty good but I have a tough time viewing this as a beer. If someone told me that this was a hard cider I might believe them. A hazy golden color with a nice thick foamy head. Aroma is sweet and fruity and at first I thought might be raspberries mixed in with apples. The 5.5% is much lower than other Unibroue selections I've had. Definitely a unique brew, at least to me it is. A sweet apple taste dominates the flavor with some yeast in there worth noting. Overall it's a nice change from the norm and pretty good for the summertime."
"Notes: Not bad,but to me this was not a beer.It was a carbonated green apple soda.So I suppose it was bad because it is sold as beer,still one can have so much worse."
"D - As I said, it's totally off balance, the flavors don't harmonize at all, but it is well made and perhaps could've been a good beer. I wouldn't drink more than one of these as the overly sour flavor really irritates me."
"Overall a good fruit beer, but there other beers are better."
"not too drinkable, i wouldn't be opposed to drinking this again or even regularly it's just not a knock out."
"The flavor is much more subdued in it's appleness than I would have guess from the aroma, which is a good thing."
"Pours banana yellow with a little head. Smells like apples. Lots of apples. Right after I opened a botlle it just hit my nose. Very nice. But you can't really taste those apples, just a liitle touch, which is nice I was afraid it was going to taste like cider. Pretty refreshing beer. I would most definately have another one. Probably the best fruit/veggie beer I've ever tryed."
"T: At worst, this tastes like a Unibroue beer, the typical Belgian yeast and malt body, but slightly watered down. The ripe green apple flavor is very noticeable but not overwhelming and the high carbonation makes this very refreshing. However the aftertaste is slightly watery. I wasn't very excited to try this beer and I was somewhat surprised by this but still would not drink this frequently."
"This is a decent fruit beer. Its not the boldest beer in the world, but it doesnt taste like an alcapop either. The apple and beer flavors are well integrated. A refreshing and simple summer sipper."
"D- A style of beer that doesn't have a lot of WOW beers in it, but Éphémère is enjoyable. This is a very refreshing and clean beer, whose fruit flavor doesn't taste artificial. I look forward to trying the other fruit beers from Unibroue. Cheers!"
"D: Not as bad as I anticipated. I am curious to try one with a less sour fruit offering."
"D= Not my favorite style of beer, nor my favorite offering from Unibroue, but this was not an unpleasant beer. It could go down well on a hot summer day, especially when paired with some spicy grilled shrimp."
"For a fruit beer, I suppose it's alright. I've never enjoyed fruit beers and never would have bought this if it didn't come in the mix pack of Unibroue beers that I bought. I would probably take apples over most other fruits in beers which I find either way too sweet or way too sour. In any case, I think fruit should just stay out of beer."
"A nice light golden color with a touch of haze. The smell is active with lots of green apple smell. The taste is light, and reminds me of a spiced cider type of beer. The one thing that stands out to me is that typical yeast flavor that comes though and can typically be found with most of the Unibroue beers. This is easy to drink and goes down smooth. Another refreshing offering by the Unibroue company."
"D-Eh. Goes down pretty smooth but not sure if I want to drink much of it"
"Interesting idea for a beer, but not for me."
"Worth a try, but given all the stellar brews I've had from Unibroue, not my favorite."
"D - This is ok, but the apple taste really gets muted after half of a bottle and this is more refreshing than flavorful. I enjoyed this, but probably would choose a peach or cranberry flavored Ephemere if I had the option"
"Dry, crisp, and ultimately pretty refreshing, the drink is overly carbonated, but not obnoxiously so. This would be a good drink for a picnic outside, when the weather is hot as Hell and anything cold would taste good. Otherwise, skip it."
"Pours a hazy yellow, with a rapidly diminishing bubbly white head. The colour is attractive, but the lack of head definitely detracts somewhat. Light wheat aroma, with a strong, well-defined presence of apple. Very fresh. The taste reminds me a lot of blanche de chambly, but with a lot of the spice replaced by apple. In fact, it tastes very much like a blend of cider and weizen. The whole package adds up to provide some incredibly refreshing and light flavours, which makes this the perfect accompaniment to a light meal or hot day. The body is medium-light with the keynote aggressive carbonation, which I think is a good match for this style. Superb drinkability."
"A summer refresher but curiously light for a Unibroue offering."
"Surprisingly dry and very bubbly, like champagne or cider. If I didn't know, I probably wouldn't even think this was beer. Still, it's not too sweet or fruity and shows surprising drinkability for a fruit brew. Probably quite refreshing in the summer heat.. Only the overcarbonation would keep me from downing a sixer of this."
"Pours a pale amber color. Not all that great head retension. Rocky head. Light green apple skin mixed with the familiar unibroue belgian-like yeast taste. Very light and refreshing. Smell is sugary and sweet like their La Fin Du Monde but there's less abv and less bitter balance. Anorther whiff gives off some hard to detect extras. Kind of complex and utterly drinkable."
"Overall - I bought this with some reservations as I'm usually not a huge fan of fruit beers but this was surprisingly similar to a belgian white with a touch of apples. This was on sale at Wegmans for $7/4 pack so seeing as I'm a huge Unibroue fan, I had to try it. Probably my least favorite of the Unibroue selection so far, but definitely worth a try if you like something a little out of the ordinary."
"Drinkability: Fair enough for a glass full of apples. At least Granny Smith would be damned proud, God rest her soul..."
"Drinkability is ok, as this is a lightweight beer that it rather bland. However, it's way to carbonated to drink with speed, and not particularly interesting as either a Belgian Pale or fruit beer."
"I was a little disappointed with Éphémère. I was expecting a strong apple, almost cider-like taste, which isn't what I got. It smelled great in the glass, similar to apple juice. The taste, though was just average. There was definitely apple there, but it was weak. The apple taste gave the beer some sweetness which was nice, but I was hoping for something stronger. Still a decent experience though."
"D: Definitely drinkable, don't know if I would want to have more than a few in a sitting. Not really a session beer but then again I don't think many fruit beers are. Unibroue continues to amaze me as I try their various brews."
"drinkability is ok. the nose was good, but the taste was a big disappointment. nicely balanced with the alcohol hidden fairly well, but just unimpressive and slightly disappointing overall."
"Mouthfeel is very lively and light, but the flavor and scent make for a beer that is difficult to finish. I would not recommend this. Seems akin to a Smirnoff product."
"I have heard mixed opinions of this, but for a White Ale style, this is fantastic. Easy to drink and absolutely perfect for the hot Australian climate."
"A fine unibroue beverage, one that anyone can enjoy."
"Sidenote: Paired very well with a chicken curry stir fry."
"Easy to drink, but fruit flavored beers are not my thing but I could see having one of these on a hot summer day as a refresher."
"This poured a light amber, it smelled like an apple jolly rancher. I was suprised aftere the smell how mellow the flavor was in the beer, there was a slight taste of apple and an even slight flavor of beer. It was very easy to drink @ 5.5% alcohol. I would stick to the other beers from Unibroue this one was a bit of a let down after the many great ones I have tasted from them"
"I drank a couple of sips and poured the rest down the drain. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers, but this was just nasty."
"D- Very drinkable! The aroma alone is worth it, just pour a glass and enjoy the smell."
"D: Very drinkable...the restrained flavor make this fruit beer very enjoyable. I could have see myself enjoying multiples. I would love to try this beer with seviche or any grilled seafood."
"D-Aroma is wonderful. Paired w/a Danish Havarti. They went well together."
"As I mentioned earlier, I do have a sweet tooth and this beer delivers. It has a dryness to it that makes it drinkable, and the malt aftertaste reminds me I am drinking a beer. Yet, the caramel quality to the malt makes me think I am eating a caramel apple. In which case, I don't think my stomach could handle another one at the moment. The bubbly lightness makes it a great beer to offer a new convert. I will definitely have another, just not tonight."
"I was expecting an overly sweet almost Smirnoff Ice flavor to this beer, I don't really know why. I was pleasently surprised though. Poured a hazy honey color. The nose was a powerful green apple smell almost reminiscent of a sour apple Jollie Rancher but not quite os synthetic. Taste of pleasant tart green apples but not too overpowering. It was pretty well balanced. Very tolerable."
"D - Perfect for a warm afternoon. Delightful ale for a change of pace, light enough to enjoy more than one. Recommended."
"D: While I don't drink fruit beers all that often - they're too sweet - this one is pretty solid. Of course, this depends on your tolerance for apples."
"d- ehh, not huge on fruit beers, but better than some other apple things ive had,"
"D: Ok drinkability but, as noted above, the mouthfeel took away from the overall enjoyment of the beer. It had more of a gummy bear taste as opposed to a apple taste. Ok drinkability, but not too enjoyable."
"This was a strange beer. It wasn't as bad as I feared, but it wasn't exactly the greatest drink ever. It was very light in colour, like a dark apple cider actually, and it reeked of apples and flowers. The pour was nothing remarkable, and the lacing it left was pretty weak. The taste was not bad; it was sweeter than I usually like, but it was still drinkable. Not something I would keep in my fridge, but my friends (who are more into cosmos and the like) declared themselves fans."
"Sorry. I just want my beer to taste like beer!"
"This was surprisingly good. The aroma was not overpowering -- there's definitely apple but it has a very terrific fruit scent. The apple flavors mix well with the other fruity esters and the other species. I found this very tasty and while it is sweet, it is not overly sweet or cloying. Definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As I mentioned before this beer is dry, very dry. That was the first thing that hit me when it hit the palate. It also has a champagne character in the mouth-highly carbonated with a fairly light body, goes along nicely with the dry character. This isn't a brew that I'd go out looking for again. Its not bad, but there is just nothing special about it. And for the price I don't think that its quite worth it. It is, however, worth a try...I just won't be coming back to it anytime soon."
"D: A very sweet-n-tart flavored wit with spicy green apples making for a great summer time picnic beer that drank like a wine cooler. Could easily down these on a hot summer day and not tire of it, very refreshing."
"D: this is a good beer when it's pour but half-haour later it's more than ordinary."
"Taste does come out more when the beer warms up and there is not much aftertaste. Not the drink I though it would be but I could see myself buying these every so often."
"Drinkability: It's a weak effort, but I guess a great brewery's weak effort is better than a lot of beers out there."
"d: This beer is very crisp and refreshing. I fear I may have not enjoyed this one to its fullest on this blustery february evening. I'll save my other bottle for a warm spring night."
"Very over carbonated which tends to hurt the mouthfeel"
"Poured out a light hazy golden color with lots of carbonation and is topped off with a nice white head that quickly dissipates and has very little lacing. It has a very sweet, slightly tangy aroma with a hint of pears and apples in it. It has a clean feel with a light body, its sweet and a bit spicy with some hints of malt in it, it a smooth drinking beer with a slight sour aftertaste. This is a very interesting beer and much better than their (Unibroue) cranberry beer which wasn't all that bad."
"Mouthfeel is very carbonated and prickly all the way to the very end. Some bitterness at the end showed up making this beer very refreshing and quaffable."
"Like I was saying, if any girl ever requested me to by them a Mike's Hard Apple Cider, I would get them this instead confidently and proudly. I know this may be taboo, but try it with a little Sprite or 7-Up, with perhaps a little grenadine. Hey, it's an apple beer, let's have fun, ey?"
"Overall- I think this beer suffered from some unrealistically high expectations on my part. Throw in a great pour and aroma and I was a bit underwhelmed when it came to taste. Not a bad beer, but not the ""can't miss"" I had built it up to be."
"D- Very easy drinking, smooth, very well balanced and full of refreshing, delicate flavors."
"Ah well. This is undoubtedly the worst review I have given on this site. At least I can follow it up with a Mort Subite (which is, btw, stunningly good)."
"Is this what diet apple soda tastes like? If you want an apple beverage with lots of carbonation, buy some Martinelli's instead. This is one of the lost souls at Unibroue. But I promise to forgive this blunder if Trois Pistoles (which rounds up the Unibroue ""Les Autres"" Invitational tomorrow) is as good as the community says."
"cheers"
"My first ever beer from Unibroue was Blanche de Chambly, and that was perhaps one of my favorite witbier's of all time... having somewhat high expectations for this brew from a company of this caliber, I was not disappointed at all from this unique and different sample... Pours a beautiful cloudy, hazy, foamy, off-yellow color with decent head... appearance was very similar to that of a witbier... the cloudiness really comes through... smell was full of ripe, green, granny smith apples that burst through immediately after opening the bottle... I had recently sampled Leinenkugel's Apple Spice beer, and this was certainly a step above that - almost on a different level... much more smooth and refined... A very fruity, almost citrus-like taste, and the apple factor is definitely more evident in the smell than in the taste... very easy drinkability at 5.5%, and a good mouthfeel lead to a very enjoyable and easy to drink beer... Definiely recommended.."
"The body is light, but the carbonation is a little too heavy for me though it is very crisp and refreshing. Considering the massive carbonation and the sweetness of this beer, it is still quite drinkable."
"Overall: I'd recommend this beer if you're interested in a light, fruity drink, not if you're interested in a fascinating beer."
"T. Maybe a little apple and maybe some malt, but all in all this is"
"Overall- After the smell, I did not think I would like it. The apples really take charge. But after the taste, it proves to be refreshing and enjoyable much like a cider. I think after a hard-hot day outside, this brew would prove itself to me."
"D-- i may drink two of these in a row but NO more than that due to the bubbly aspect....i loved this beer though and will definetly get it again...it was better than i could have expected...another nice taste for me from unibroue..thanks guys"
"This beer is definatly different. I'm glad I finally got up the courage to try this one but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't buy it again. Also not really a fan of the excessive amount of sediment."
"Easy going down but very much reminiscent of a wime cooler rather than beer Great summer refresher however."
"D: Very refreshing, would make a great lawnmower beer. At the same time I am not sure I will pick up more, I guess it depends on the price. Definitely worth trying."
"D: I come to appreciate this beer more and more with each one I drink. It drinks like an apple cider with a nice dry, tart finish. Very easy to quaff and would make a nice summer beer. Nothing too outstanding, but nevertheless I recommend that people try this one."
"This i s a fairly decent beer that is pretty easy to drink. Try it if you get the chance."
"Overall - Not very enjoyable. Over-carbonated with an overly phenolic yeast character."
"The brew lacks depth and complexity, and in all honesty I'd rather be drinking a vodka apple cider, but if you're a fan of framboise you may well get to like this one."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head. Not much retention,and just a bit of lacing. Smell is of sweet fresh fruit,and candy. Body is light,and carbonated. Taste is of sweet fruit,with apple up front. A nice juciey,finish,makes this a very enjoyable beer."
"D: Good for what it is (but I'm still not a fan)."
"It's not bad; it's just not as good as Unibroue's other offerings, such as Fin du Monde or Don de Dieu."
"D - This is pretty good. It is very different from other beers of this style."
"D - Not something to drink all the time or session but a couple of these on a warm summers day would be alright."
"This fruited ale has a nice look, a very light blonde coloring, although almost no head and no lacing. It has a great scent, with a wonderful apple kick thats very nice. It has a good ale flavor, with a nice maltiness and an interesting, if slightly sour, apple taste, as if a granny smith apple had been squeezed into the bottle. It goes down nice, if a bit fizzy. It is worth a shot if you like fruited beers, although this is different than a fruited wheat or a lambic, especially if you can find it in the Unibroue sampler pack."
"D: I'm not a cider fan, and I like how this is more along the lines of an apple champagne. Not one I would choose first off, but a decent beer none the less."
"Pours a bright hazy golden color with a large soapy white head that dissipated into a soapy cap. I poured the yeast in so plenty of floaties hang'n out. The smell has a slight spice edge followed by juicy apples. It has a bit of a citrus scent as well. The taste is of spice and what I assume is curacao, and apples. It has that green apple jolly rancher taste. There is also a mint like taste. The feel is light and fizzy; its sweet but has some malt balance, finishes on the dry side. Overall not a bad brew, that has some good apple taste. The mint presence is a bit odd. Worth a try."
"D- Very easy to drink but slightly lacking in character."
"Bottled opened with a whoosh, followed by a strong smell of granny smith apples. Poured with a beautiful cloudy pale straw color and a nice head; however very little lacing on the glass. Effervesced nicely throughout the tasting and was surprisingly light in the mouth considering the carbonation. Almost buttery on the tongue with only a slight tingle followed by a mild taste of clove and coriander. Very little apple flavor. Quite crisp and refreshing, although I don't think I would drink more than two in a sitting."
"12oz bottle poured into a wine glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a large white head supported by a lot of little tiny bubbles rising to the top. The aroma is dominated by the tart green apples and a touch of yeast. The taste much like the aroma features the green apple flavors most predominately with just a touch of malt and a hint of yeast. The mouthfeel is light and crisp and very fizzy from the high amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but I found it to be too one dimensional relying too heavily on the apple flavors."
"Although it is very fruity, I don't think its done poorly. Its a welcome change. I don't normally drink fruit beers, but I will definitely look for this at our local beer store. Althought its a fruity, the belgian characteristics come through as well. It has a very hazy unfiltered look to it, like many craft brewed Hefe's, but instead of the banana aroma and taste thats so prevalent, its overwhelmingly apple."
"Pretty drinkable for how sweet it is"
"Drinkability: while I wouldn't probably drink more than a few at any one time, because I don't want to overload on the apple flavors, this beer is very interesting and easy to drink."
"D- Easily drank this bottle, but did not enjoy it so much. It lacked what I was looking for and truly teased the sweet apple flavor."
"My ONLY regret w/ this drink is the mellowness in the actual apple flavour. The smell just wraps you in, inviting you to enjoy it...but than the taste is strangely mellow. Like a light cider."
"Drinkability: Intriguingly delicate; nothing to get in the way of drinking it, and the light flavour would pair well with light cheeses or starchy desserts."
"DA: Very nice."
"Overall, a great fruit beer. Not super-sweet, the fruitiness takes a backseat and adds only complexity."
"i was expecting more nuances to come out as it warmed, but really the aroma waxed and waned as temperature jumped around... but the apple always stayed just on the fringe... actually has me hankering for a lambic, but i'd be happy to serve and drink this all summer long... and in LA... that's a lot..."
"Mouthfeel is light and slightly creamy. this is a nice after dinner digestive."
"Just not a good effort."
"Drinkability- A very good relax and sip ale that could pare wit a lot of different foods as well."
"D: I would drink this one again, if it ever comes out again. If you like the fruit beer, then you could no wrong with this."
"It's light bodied and easy to drink. But the tartness of this beer would steer me away from having another is the same session."
"D- This is a great summer fruit beer. It is light, crisp, and tasty. Very sessionable on hot days like today. Unibroue never lets me down with their brews and this is another great one. I will have it again."
"This brew pours a cloudy neon green color that fades along the edges. The head is a massive, billowy three inches in height. The aroma is of rotting green apples, and curacao. It reminds me of a vomit covered barroom floor. The taste is of green apples (without the rot), with a citrusy, curacao spritze in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with prefect carbonation. Overall, I really like the taste and mouthfeel of this beer, but the aroma ruins it for me. I can't see myself drinking this again."
"For me, it actually paired surprisingly well with the completely unplanned chicken mango pineapple kabobs and coconut rice."
"D - A great lambic-like fruit beer that is full of subtle gentle flavors. Drinkable enough in the summer, but it's not really as interesting or complex as I thought it would be."
"A nice color and decent head, ok stringly lacing. Aroma is a weak, thin sugary apple juice, its not bad, but not liking it one bit. The same artificial apple is too distracting for anything else to be tasted. Really, thats probably how its supposed to be, but its just not done well, imo. If this were a light beer with apple juice mixed in, I'd say ""hey, this would be tasty for beer drinkin and throwing a frisby on the beach."" As it stands, not impressed in the least."
"D- Pretty good. A good session beer, but I can't think of good pairings, so I'd probably have one or two and move on. Get one if you're in the mood to have some bubbly cider."
"Drinks alright for a ""rich man's snake bite"". Could do a few on a hot summer's afternoon (actually a little cool today). Was surprised how much I liked this!"
"I've enjoyed Unibroue's bigger offerings in the past, so I gave this a try. Unfortunately, I didn't like it much. I've had hard ciders that I liked better. This maybe has a little more body than Hornsby's or Woodchuck so not as much of a ""throw-em-down"" apple-flavored drink."
"The taste is a similarly pleasing amalgam of a light malty beer with lots of fresh apple flavor throughout from start to finish. Lightly actve carbonation complements the flavor and makes this refreshing and drinkable, much less sweet than I thought it might be from the inital smell. Fairly watery though, underneath the apple. Nice for a change, and well done, but the actual apple flavor didn't excite me particularly, so I give that an ""above average"". Actually, perhaps what I mean is, why do we need an apple beer? Cherries are great in beer and lambics, perhaps not apple, methinks. Cider, after all, is there for the apple lovers."
"Drinkability & Notes: If it was not for the apple character this would just be plain carbonated water with a little malt on the side."
"Quite drinkable, good light dessert beer."
"Light and refreshing. Tasty and juicy. Nice drink."
"Considering the style tends to use artificial adjuncts/supplements to get the flavor, it is still too unbalanced for my taste. IMO not a well rounded brew, even considering the styles goals...."
"Taste was like a very mild witbier with some apple flavoring. Did not have witbier astringency but was not overly sweet or unnatural tasking from the apple. The mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing and drinkability was good. Not too sweet, I could have easily downed a few if I was out with friends."
"Good fruit beer, which is tough to make. Enjoyed one glass, but couldn't drink much more than that."
"for a beer that could almost fool some people into thinking they are drinking sparkling wine, this beer almost filled my room with apple. the most intense fruit beer ive ver tried, ive had it in growler and bottle, growler was alittle better, but for being a apple beer it wasnt as easy to drink as id think. had a little bit of a weird aftertaste, but im looking forward to trying the other ephemere styles like cherry,grape, etc."
"This beer pours a nearly golden color. Smells strongly of apples and/or apple candy. Mmm. Taste is much of the same, except that the apple is reduced in the background with just a hint of sourness that balances it out.Tart and somewhat tangy. Very drinkable still, which shows that Unibroue only brews good beers."
"The taste had some good apple flavors, as expected. A candy-like sweetness reminiscent of Juicy Fruit lights up the palate and is accentuated by a nice carbonation level. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and relatively crisp, but doesn't have much of a burst to the aftertaste. All in all, this is definitely a beer that goes down easily, partly due to it's low (5.5%) ABV. The ""apple, curacao, and coriander"" make for a tasty brew, but it lacks the intricacy of most other Unibroue beers."
"Ephemere Apple pours a hazy yellow with a white head that fades rather quickly to a thin cap. The smell has notes of tart apples and coriander. A little of the tartness come through in flavor, but the coriander is more noticeable in the taste. A rush of carbonation in the initial mouthfeel made me expect a crisp finish that didn't materialize. While this beer was interesting, it is not something I would want to session. It is worth trying, however."
"It's kinda hard, but if you can pour this one like a hefeweizen...very carefully. It pours nice and big, but after a minute or so it falls into a thin lacing that doesn't hold so well. The color is a light cider brown, almost like a light IPA. The smell once you open it is apple. Floral apple tones that must be mixed with something citrisy...the bottle says coriander and curacao. They must be what I'm smelling in company with the apple. Now there's barley even a lacing. A minute head. The smell reminds me right away of a belgian triple mixed with hefeweizen. Clove is what reminds me of a hefeweizen. The mouthfeel is the first thing I notice, it's got that carbonation that's prominent and sticks to your tongue the whole time you drink it. The flavor is slightly clovey and Belgian-like, however the apple cider and light citrus then take over and finish dry. The flavor reminds me of a mixture of candy and medicine. Overall, I will probably not have this one again."
"This beer pours out a pale gold color with a fairly large pure white head which doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon. I was able to notice the smell immediately after pulling off the cap. There is a good deal of sour green apple, granny smith like, on top with a bit of cloviness and banana underneath. The taste too starts out with a lot of sour apple flavor which is somewhat balanced by grainy, bready maltiness and a bit of hop spice it's fairly sweet as well. The apple flavor may dominate a bit too much for me. This beer is very bubbly and active on the tongue, finishes dry and leaves a lingering apple taste. Light and refreshing this beer is fairly drinkable if it is your ""thing"". I could see personal preference playing a huge role with this one, some will love it some will hate it, I find it to be an interesting, different beer from Unibroue, good but not great."
"This was good, but it didn't wow me. I feel the Cassis version is far superior and much better. That is not to say this was bad, but that the Cassis is that good. This would be a great refresher, would pair fantastic with a summer salad (Waldorf especially), lite seafood, or pork. Actually, it would go really well with a simple pork dish...I'll have to try that. A good fruit beer, and worthy of checking out."
"The winged fairy princess on the label tipped me off to what I was in for! A very cloudy, pale yellow appearance with a high carbonated fizziness when poured. Sour apple aroma with a hint of banana. Very light taste of green apples but the carbonation predominates. Finishes in a slightly sour note. Light, tingly mouthfeel, dry overall presentation. Highly drinkable if this is your favored style. Light in alcohol and delicate in body that should appeal to white wine enthusiasts. Would pair well with stir fry or grilled chicken breast."
" I guess this could be considered fairly drinkable, but Im not sure I want to drink more. It is very sweet from the apple flavor but there is not much else going on in this beer. This could be a good warm weather treat. I love many of the other Unibroue beers, but this is not one I am likely to visit again any time soon."
"Mom still liked it, but I have a feeling she's just being mom."
"Not my typical thing, but it's done well. It's basically like a sparking cider, but more yeasty (and has a more beer-like texture). It's more carbonated than I typically like my beer, but that works with the flavor. Probably won't get it again for myself, but with others, sure... Nevertheless, fun to try."
"It poured a cloudy dark yellow with a champagne-like head. I didn't get any coriander out of the aroma (it's written on the bottle) but I did get a good amount of sourness. Flavor was a cross betweeen champagne and a pear-flavored soda (if there was such a thing). A very light, refreshing and crisp mouthfeel."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow with a thick head. The bubbles were tight and had nice lacing  although it disappeared quickly. The smell immediately reminded me of a green-apple flavor jolly rancher. The taste is sour and fruity. It isnt as strong as its aroma. The mouthfeel is on the thin side. It seems to be quite well balanced and would be very drinkable for those who favor this style."
"Interesting enough to try, but this 750ml bottle would have been more appropriate for sharing. Pretty good for a fruit beer though."
"poured from a 750ml bottle with the wire holding the cork dated 2005 a hazy straw yellow color with a large white head that just faded to no cover at all and no lace at all. smell is good with a earthy apple and a slightly spice aroma. taste is even better nice apple juice malt up front and slightly tart end. light mouthfeel very crisp and dry. very enjoyable, great summer drink."
"Pours a hazy dark yellow. Huge aroma of ripe green apple. Huge is not an understatement - it approaches jolly rancher territory. Taste is slightly tart green apple with definite orange undertones. There is some biscuity maltiness there as well to keep it under control to some degree. Feels like a sparkling cider in the mouth. Carbonation is very high, which I like here. Fun change of pace for springtime, but not something I would want on a regular basis."
"Pours a golden yellow with a frothy white head that fades quickly. The aroma of apples immediately filled the room when I poured this beer. The smell is very strong and inviting, all apples with a hint of yeast. The taste is very similar. The apples are very powerful, but as you get to the bottom of the glass the yeast comes out revealing a belgian like beer. The mouthfeel is decent, light and crisp, but I would have like the carbonation to play a bigger role, maybe smaller due to the growler. This one is an easy drinker if you like fruit beer or belgians, the apples calm as you drink, and they do not drive the beer to be sweet or tart, but have a good balance. I suggest checking this one out. Cheers!"
"A light and fruity ale kissed with a Belgian yeast strain. The flavors are too sweet and somewhat artificial; hence the notice of ""ale brewed with apple 'juice'", on the label."
"D - While I don't see myself drinking more than one of these in a night, as I'm not generally a fruity beer kind of guy, I can see how some people would. It slips down pretty easily and the low alcohol content for a Unibroue means that it's not going to knock you off your feet."
"-Oelergud"
"Beer poured out a nice hazy golden orange color, with nice carbonation, but only very mild head, some lacing. Smell was light, with faint apple and some spices. Taste was very nice, with apple again coming up front, with a very light and smooth spicey following. The mouthfeel was very nice, again good carbonation, very smooth. All in all a nice fruit beer, I would like to have it on a summer night and review it again."
"D- Very good. Has a nice complexion and balance to it. I was pleasantly surprised with this one."
"Drinkability: quite a drinkable brew , high on the list of veggie beer iv'e tried for it natural , (if a bit light) flavor. Smells more complex than it tastes though."
"not bad, but weak, i woulda like more to it, but not bad"
"Overall, an interesting beer. Definitely not a session beer, but more of an intriguing refresher. But, be warned, by the time I was finishing my bottle I found it rather cloying and was glad I was finished."
"Pours a light hazy yellow color with a monstrous solid white head that stays well. The nose is of tart green apples and Belgian-style yeast. Not much else, but that's enough. The palate is maybe a little more bland than the nose would lead you to believe, but it is light, refreshing and laced with green apples and a pleasant sweetness from the malt. Some residual yeast notes here as well, as you'd expect from Unibroue. The body is quite light and refreshing. Heavy-handed carbonation, and finishes quite dry. My wife loves this beer and that's not an indictment. I like it too, for gian white ale flair. Blanche De Chambly with tart apples. Nice."
"D - It tastes good but I don't know how many fruity beers I (personally) can drink in one sitting. Depends on my mood I guess."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a inch of white foam. Smells of green apple and mild spice. Tart tastes of green apple, lemon, and spice. A frothy medium body with above average carbonation. This is a very crisp and refreshing offering. I would seek it out again."
"Much sweeter than the beers that Unibroue is famous for. I think they did a good job with the apple flavor. Not quite as tart as a New England Cider. This one is probably better cold. Recommended."
"Wierd mouthfeel: at times it seems too fizzy, and at other times it is very smooth. Drinkable, but the 750ml bottle can be a challenge."
"drinkability: good"
"Overall, as far as fruit beers go, Unibroue knocks this one out of the park. Awesome taste and smell."
"Pours a hazy golden color with lots of carbonation that forms a modest head that dissipates very quickly. But, the first thing you notice is apples. As soon as I opened thed bottle I smelled apples. This however does not come through as strongly when actually checking what's in your glass. Tast was lacking what I would have thought to display more apple character. Not my favorite Unibroue."
"Don't be discouraged by the beer if your scoffing at it's apple content because it's actually pretty damn good. This beer has piqued my long dead interest in the style. W00t Unibroue!"
"Light golden/yellow color. Small white head that is sustained with a steady stream of carbonation. The smell of apples hit me the second I opened the bottle. Also a hint of yeasty spicyness. The malts are light tasting, giving the impression of a wheat beer. The apple flavors come through but are not overpowering or sickly sweet as you may expect. I found this to be a rather nice little beer. Something very nice for a change of pace. Light and easy on the palate but with enough flavor to make it interesting. Once again i'm impressed with Unibroue."
"A very decent beer, and something pleasantly different."
"Overall: I have been looking forward to trying this beer. Although I am slightly let down with it, it is still good. It is a little more cidery than I would like."
"Notes: I can tell this is a well crafted brew as its complex without being annoying. This is not something that will see my fridge too often though as sour apples, spices, and sweetness is not for me. With that said though this is a must try."
"D - Very drinkable. Aside from the price, I would drink the hell out of this."
"Beer poured a cloudy golden color with a well sustained white head. Nose is of champagne and sour apples. Taste is somewhat having a wheaty quality with a sour apple finish. Mouthfeel has a champagne quality to it, quite bubbly and lively. Drinkability is OK. One is pretty good to try but I am not sure how the second one will go down."
"The mouth is light, not at all complex, and not very inspiring at all. The lack of body and flavor make it drinkable, but I won't drink one of these ever again. I don't see a point."
"The smell was what I would call typical and expected; mild tart apple, sweet fruits, candy sugar, mild yeast and almost no hop presence. I was impressed with the taste, which was rather mild despite the nose; doughy yeast and sweet/tart fruits blended very well to give a nice and varying mouthfeel, which started with the carbonation tingle, then went through sweet and sour and ended smooth, but almost watery. Overall a very decent fruit beer."
"This is a refreshing fruity beer and quite drinkable, but not as good as I expected from Unibroue. It would be a decent choice on a hot summer day, but I can find beter summer beers at much cheaper prices."
"I could see having a couple of these in hot weather but its something Id have to be in the mood for. Good but not great."
"The carbonation was a little too low and the mouthfeel a little sticky for my liking. I would have liked a crisper finish, but I concede that may have made it too cider-like for others."
"D- Lower alcohol content than most of the unibroue brews, this is very drinkable. Good for company that doesn't like beer but likes wine. A good foot in the door for those not into beer...yet..."
"Just no reason to drink this one really more like sparkling water, really if the beer was less carbinated I might have been able to enjoy some very light balenced flavors but with this much carbination nothing much comes through. I would also like to try this beer with more apple flavors I think it would be nice with all that carbination. Really I would like to see the carbination scaled back or the taste scaled up."
"Feels okay in the mouth, like a decent wheat beer. The taste is just weak. Apple is present, but very little character besides. It's not really active and bold like a good lambic, but it's also not cloying like fruit beers can be. If you like Pyramid's Apricot wheat or Sam Adams' Cherry wheat, give the Ephemere line a taste."
"Overall: I like the taste of coriander in food, and I like the spiciness in this beer, but I can't find a clear link between the two. I think I might just need to try some other beers with coriander. In general, I like this take on an apple beer, but don't know if I'll be shelling out over 2 bucks a bottle for it again."
"Really carbonated...almost too much. Thin, champagne like body. I am not extremely impressed, however, I won't give up on fruit beers yet."
"The taste is like a really good witbier (Blanche de Chambly perhaps) with a few Jolly Ranchers dropped in and dissolved. Very interesting mix with incredibly drinkable results. The beer is very light in body and easy to drink a lot of without it getting too cloyingly sweet, even. Not a fan of fruity beer, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"Pours hazy golden color, amost like a hefeweizen with a fizzy white head which dissipates quickly. Aroma is green apple and yeast. Taste is apple , yeast and spices.Mouthfeel is thin with a lot of carbonation. I expected more complexity from this, but its still ok. Wouldn't go out of my way to try this again but its not bad."
"If you like apples, you should thoroughly enjoy this one."
"The beer poured a belgian style dull gold color with a few undiscovered sources of carbonation. A constant quarter inch of bright head retained throughout the drinking. The nose was strong on sweet, lightly sour, apple tones. The flavor of the beer proved to be quite sweet and apple infused without pushing over the limits of turning into an apple/beer alco-pop type deal. A slightly creamy texture developed as this one warmed, and the beer proved to be an enjoyable digestif, but too sweet to be sessioned and not my favorite style. Still an interesting rendition of this style of beer."
"Taste was apple-like, very refreshing and combined with the usual witbier tastes. The wheat base was pretty solid and the yeast profile was just right. Drinkability was very good."
"When my husband handed me the beer and said, ""it's all you."" I knew when he meant. There was a lot of coriander in this beer. (Something he can't stand.) From the aroma to the taste, you know it's there and not hidden. It's a hazy yellow with a thick head and quite a bit of carbonation. Very apple, spicy, and tart taste. It was okay, but nothing I'd want another of."
"I just know that the wife really enjoyed her samples, as did I. This brews was very fizzy and softly carbonated  just a top notch summer drinker!"
"Ephemere (Apple) pours a golden color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is nice, apple dominates. Flavor is also pretty good, I'm not the biggest fruit beer fan, and I can say this is fruit beer done well. The apple flavor while strong was balanced by a wheat base, it never got sweet or cloying. This beer is quite light, I found it to be enjoyable. Recommended."
"Overall: The highlights of this beer for me are the mouthfeel and the sublimely balanced apple flavor. It might not be for everyone, but it should definitely be tried by everyone."
"So yeah, when it comes to apple beverages, this completely blows away any of the mass produced ""ciders"" that one would find. Definitely worth a try, and if it were just a little bit cheaper, it would be a great summer staple."
"Cheers!"
"Very nice but not a session beer. Crisp for a hot summer day."
"Pours into the tulip glass with a tremendous head that fades away slowly leaving only a few spots of lacing behind. Color is green apple with numerous small bubbles. Theres yeast in the bottle. Nose of very sweet apple and that signature Unibroue yeast. Taste is something like apple juice, not beer-like at all, fading to a kind of watery concoction like a glass of water with an apple Jolly Rancher dissolved in it. A little bit of yeast is evident, and everything finishes on an ever so bitter note, though Id stop short of attributing it to hops. Mouth is watery and flatly carbonated in other words, it feels sort of flat. Drinkability is OK; its not offensive, but not inviting, either."
"Drinkability: Pretty killer for a fruit beer, especially on a hot Milwaukee night."
"If you are thirsty on a hot summer day, this would be very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing and an excellent match for any chocolatey dessert (I had it with molten chocolate soufflé). May also work well with cheesecake or as a marinade for pork."
"I wouldn't want to drink this regularly, but as a change of pace it's okay."
"A sweet treat of a beer, perfect for a hot summers day like today. Highly drinkable but the high level of RS could make it difficult as a all day session beer."
"Pours a hazy pale with a slight hint of green. Smell is that of wheat with some green apple in it. The green apple is more evident in the taste of this beer with strong wheat flavors and a bit of orange citrus. Good mouthfeel with some nice carbination. A very drinkable beer, great for hot weather."
"This beer was kind of disappointing. I was hoping for more fruit flavor. Not a bad beer, but it didn't wow me."
"Overall an interesting beer. Unibroue always packs a crapload of carbonation in their beers, and this seems to give it an elegant characteristic to it, as if it was a sweet champagne. But as far as beer goes, an interesting alternative and quite tasty, but not one i would have cravings for. not a big fan of the coriander."
"Pours out a hazy brass color with a violently fizzy head that disappears within seconds. Smell is strongly of sour apple laffy taffy and hints of coriander. Tastes of granny smith apples, coriander, and light yeast tones. Very tart and refreshing but thins out too much in the finish and becomes seltzery. Despite the lack of head, this is very bubbly and champagne-like. It's a little thin in the finish, however. Quite drinkable as a hybrid of cider and ale."
"D- meant to be sipped but could easily be chugged"
"As opposed to most beers, I actually thought this was more complex before it had warmed. Once warm the apple dominated and took away some of the wheat beer characteristics."
"This is the second of my ventures into the Unibroue line of brews and I found this one to be very good. It is pricey (here it's about 7.50 for a 4 pack), but it's a nice change up to the regular line up of brews for me. My only complaint is that this appears to be seasonal. I'll have to give the other Ephemere seasonals a try."
"Pours a pale gold with a quickly fading 1 finger head and OK lace. Good green apple smells mixed with a bit of honey sweet light malt. If the intent here was to make a beer with nothing more that green appple flavor, they should have made a cider. As beer goes I think that this is nothing more than alcoholic carbonated apple water. Very flavorless (except for the apple). A definate summer beer. Very light. It's liteness does give it high drinkability though. I will have to try this one again on a hotter than hell summers day. A well made beer but just too wimpy for me."
"Pours a light colored ale with great retention and no disitation. The scent of apple and citrus is very present. The taste is very lite and refreshing, a great summer beer. Another great beer from Unibroue and will be a regular in my fridge!!!!"
"Overall: Very dissapointing. Not much to it but green apple flavors and a touch of wheat. No hops and no malt. More like flavored water than a beer. I wouldn't waste the money or time."
"D - Not bad at all. one of the better fruit beers I've had. A more than acceptable replacement for a dry apple cider."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. Not filling, clean finish, fine flavor. Not too inebriating, but sensually pleasing. I had my doubts about this one, but it has really surpassed expectations."
"We sit here drinking the 750ml bottle. It is much less carbonated than expected. Maybe we got a bad bottle(or maybe not...it does have the right smell)? The beer poured a golden color, with a white head that quickly disappeared. It smells of apple, but the taste does not really represent the scent. The flavor is fake. It tastes like apple but does not taste natural. Mouthfeel: it is less carbonated than expected, and almost has a bitter after taste. It is drinkable but disappointing."
"Notes: Fruit beers are slowly becoming one of my least favorite styles, which is a shame because Magic Hat #9 is one of the reasons I got into better beer. Oh well, I guess tastes develop..."
"drinkability: the strong apple taste adn the high carbonation make this hard for me to finish, but it's not so bad I won't have one once in awhile, it's just not something i would sit back and drink very often/all day."
"Notes: Certainly a favorite of mine when it comes to fruit beers, but not a style I lean towards to begin with. Another good beer overall from Unibroue."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and, by far, the best of the Ephemere series."
"I like this. It says on the bottle it's a ""refreshing summer delight", and I'll bet it is. I don't think I'd want to drink it all day, but if I was thirsty, it'd really hit the spot. It's tasty, fizzy, fruity, and delish. One of the best fruit beers I've had in a long time."
"Pours a pale straw, heavely clouded by yeast. The snow-white head rushes up to fill the glass, and with a hard fizz like club soda, it disintigrates to nothing and leaves only a few scarce dots of lace. Wheat and pale malt in the nose, an a strong aroma of granny smith apples. Sweet wheat and extra pale malt flavors are met by a quasi-lambic tartness and a distinct apple taste that is not quite ester. The aftertaste is semi-dry with no hops to be found, and the overall flavor is left unbalanced. The sour flavor from the fruit and mild yeast bite are not enough to even out this overly sweet brew; reminds me of one of those foo-foo drinks. Very high carbonation and thin body like a spritzer. While the finish is a little on the sweet side, ultra-crisp-light mouthfeel make this fairly easy to drink."
"Served in an imperial pint glass. A very large white head sitting on a cloudy straw yellow body. Lots of carbonation bubbles race to the top. Even before the glass got in front of me the green apple aroma hit me in the face. It dominates right from the start and influences everything else. A medium body is again dominated by the tart green apple with a tang from the carbonation. Definately a different kind of brew."
"This is one of those beers that begs you to inhale it. Its almost like Unibroue made a Belgian style fruit beer."
"I thought this was pretty bad, and i was looking forward to it. Pours with little head, doesn't look like much, doesn't smell like much other than a corky hint of apple. Taste is where I have problems with this beer: there is very little of it. My sample tasted akin to watered down cider. I'd rather drink a 40."
"Drinkability: This would be a great beer to have on a hot summer day or a good compliment to light fare or a pork dish."
"The taste is short and leaves you lacking...disapointing really but overall a nice product."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow straw with a small head. The smell is all about apples. It's a nice smell,but i'm not sure it's right for a beer. The taste is also all apple,there are some spices,coriander and pepper,but it's not too strong. The m/f is light and pretty well balanced. It's not bad,but take away the apples and there's not much here. I won't buy this again."
"Although I don't normally care for fruit beers, I find myself enjoying this one. The apple flavoring does not overpower the base flavor of the beer. Very interesting."
"When i first opened and poured this beer the room was filled with a blast of fresh green apple smell. It poured a cloudy gold with a thick white head. The flavor was sweet, slightly tart, full of apple flavor and of spices like cloves and cinnamon. There was a mild alcohol bite at the end. It was very smooth and not in the slightest bit bitter. I found it very good, THe apple wasnt to overpoweringly sweet or tart, and the flavors were all well ballanced, I enjoyed this one very much."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a solid cap of foam, about an inch with good retention. Smell is predominantly sour apple, but I also detect some lemon or perhaps raspberry aromas. Taste is sweet but tart, like sour apple, grapes, and wine. The apple flavor is done well, not too overpowering. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Not too thin. The alcohol doesn't really come out much. Overall a nice apple flavored fruit beer, but probably not for everyone."
"D - An ideal summer beer. Naturally, I am drinking it in the dead of winter. It works well with many foods. Basically, use as a substitute for apple juice (well, don't pack it in your kids' lunches, but you get the idea). It is definitely better cold. Great for a session, also as a gateway beer to the craft world for those who enjoy cider."
"My wife's favorite beer, not mine. It poure a slightly cloudy pale yellow with a nice head. It had a tart odor to it, and more of a sour apple than sweet apple taste. Somewhat carbonated, felt OK in the mouth. A nice beer to drink a few of, but not something I'd want to drink all the time. A summer beer."
"d: not a fan of apple flavored beers, so I'll say average."
"Earthy grains are somewhat out of place in my opinion. Nice finish, but not something I'd rush to go back to."
"As good as a fruit beer gets in my mind."
"I would say that this brew is much closer in character to a witbier than any sort of fruit beer. But what ever it is, its a real treat; tart and acidic, but still delicate and refreshing. Highly recommended."
"again, another great beer from unibroue. just wish the alcohol content was a bit higher, but i guess you can't win 'em all..."
"Not something I'd try again, but I'm curious as to the other Ephemere twists."
"Overall not a bad beer but I was hoping for more. Not going to give up on this one though, will probably buy again. Perhaps I will try some of the other flavors if I can find them."
"Didn't like it at all, I'd go as far as saying icky."
"Overall; I do like this beer as a divergence. It's a well-crafted beer, just not something I could drink all the time."
"This beer is very easy to drink and is quite delicious. Its light crispness contributes to its high drinkability. I'd drink this beer again and certainly plan to."
"Mouthfeel is rather light with a strong flow of carbonation that dances across my tongue. Ultra refreshing..I could seriously drink a lot of this brew, especially on a hot summer day. One of my new favorite fruit beers...I wish I could get a mixed 12pack with all the flavors. Well worth seeking out. Yum."
"Unibroue labels are always great, and this one is no exception. poured a cloudy dark yellow color with magnificient white puffy head that rapidly fell to a thin ring. Smell is a pleasant mixture of apples, coriander, and other spices. The bubbles seem to attack the nose. Taste is superb, with a nice combination of apples , coriander and othe spices, and a nice tartness, yet still sweet. The carbonation in the mouth is enjoyable, like champagne. Finish leaves a nice apple taste in the mouth , almost like a fresh apple pie. This was a very nice beer. I'm not much of a fan of fruit beers, but I truly enjoyed this one. Almost too easy drinking."
"Another delicious brew from Unibroue. If you don't mind fruit flavors in your beer, this is a great one to try."
"A well crafted fruit beer without question. Very enjoyable to sip on a warm day. Definitely recommended for those would like fruity beers and appreciate the Belgian yeast/clove combo."
"Wow! This has got to be one the funkiest tastng beers ever. It pours a golden clear color with a nice lace. It actually looks like sparkling apple juice. Smells like apples and about nothing else maybe a little yeasty. It tastes like sweet acidic apple juice with a wheaty malty character. Very well balanced but definatly lacks complxity a quality I have come to expect from Unibrou."
"Taste good. The nose, basically, only slightly washed out by a grand fizziness that feels cool but kills the apples."
"This beer is one that is easy to find locally. I really love its champagne like qualities as well as the clear and ever presesnt apple aroma and flavor. not as cloying as many ciders, The green apple flavor blends well with the ""beer"" aspects, the doughy yeast, the soft biscuity malts and the faint hop presence. This is a beer to enjoy with lighter fare."
"Pours a golden/straw yellow with a neon greenish hue when held up to the light. Lively bubble action feeds a foamy white head that shrinks to a coating but stays for a while. Aroma is tart apples and some musty yeast/wheat - kind of like a sour Jolly Rancher. Taste is granny smith apples and grassy wheat. The apple is more subtle than in the New Glarus, more tart as well, but I just liked the Apple Ale better. Don't get me wrong, this is tasty, but I liked the sweeter cidery approach better than the tartness here. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp like the Ale. This fruit beer certainly has more of a ""beer"" flavor than the Apple Ale, but I preferred the later. Still this is another good offering from Unibroue, so far so good from our friends North of the border."
"750 ml bottle best before 2/17/05. Pours a pale hazy yellow with a finger of dense whit head, pretty good retention. Big green apple aroma with some hints of lemon, bubblegum, and spices. Taste is a mild green apple upfront giving way to a clean wheaty malt and just the slightest tart aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth yet has a highly carbonated bubbly effervescence---very nice, although it does lead to some strongly appled flavored burps. This is a really good fruit beer, not at all like an apple cider that most people would expect, and is a really nicely flavored but accessible beer."
"The Unibroue line of products continues to amaze me. I was very skeptical about this beer, thinking it would be a sidestep from some ciders Ive tried. I was wrong, again. Huge granny smith effervescence, lager-like color with a huge head and cloudy pasteurization (lack thereof). This beer ended up being a very sweet Belgium type beer."
"Drinkability: Though it's not extremely sweet, I don't know if I'd want to make a session out of this. It seems like with any fruit beer, eventually the notion of the fruit may either get a bit boring, not lively enough, or tiresome. However, if you're wanting something that's craft-worthy without being overly insane to the palate, this is certainly worth trying. If I can find them, I'll probably be trying the other varities of Ephemere also."
"Pours hazy gold with huge white head and thick lace. Aroma of apples and bubblegum esters. Seen it described as ""green apple Jolly Ranchers dropped into a glass of Duvel"" Thought it would taste like apple cider but inspite of dominate apple flavors it displays its Belgium side with orange zest, clove and crushed coriander with a curacao bitterness merged in sweet sparkling wit-like light body with a tingling mouth feel from the strong carbonation."
"Reminescent of a Belgian Wit and a Sprakling white wine. Tart, sour, and defyant esters. Spicy, peppery, and lightly sweet. Citric and acidic. Ooh, by the way, APPLES! Granny smith to be exact. The cidery aromas trascribe into the flavor and ride it on through to the finish. Lightly earthy and grape skin flavors add bitterness and roughness. Finishes dry, tart, and mildly sweet. High carbonation scrubs the palate, and the alcohol numbs it. Dry and bubbly. Aftertaste is a little phenolic and warm...remaining tart and sour."
"Hazy and light gold in colour. Green apple and some mild yeast aromas. Flavor wise, the apple dies off a bit, and a sweet cherry flavor moves in. It reminds me of cherry Bubbliscious gum. With all of the fruit flavors going on, it still retains its beer flavors as well (gentle hops, yeast, etc.). Oddly enough, I kinda wish this beer was a bit sweeter, but this is still some solid stuff."
"Drinkability: It's drinkable. I wouldn't put it in the recommend category, but a decent and different beer to enjoy."
"-UF"
"Taste was not particularly pleasing to me and was about the most disappointing aspect of this beer. It tasted vaguely like granny smith, but had other aspects to it that I just didnt like to well."
"I had this on tap at Ciceros today. It poured a hazy gold color with a thin white head, that didnt last long. No discernable lace left on the glass. The aroma is dominated by apple maybe a little citrus. Taste is crisp apple, a little sweet. Slight orange citrus in the finish. This is like drinking a Jolly Rancher apple flavored candy. Slick crisp mouth feel. Low drinkability. This is just too sweet."
"I love Unibroue but this offering is passable to me. Not a bad brew particularly when the style is considered, but not one that will make it into my regular rotation anytime soon."
"Nice brew for the summer months. Very light and refreshing, and a bit of a change from Unibroue's other offerings. Flavors of apple, corrander, and sweet spices were present, as was a nice level of carbonation. Aromas were slightly sweet and herbal. Finished dry, but with a slight sweetness on the palate. This is a very drinkable beer. Recommended."
"Body is medium with a light and airey texture and fine carbonation. Soft and playful palate. I could drink this all day."
"Refreshing, but nothing I would usually gravitate towards."
"Fizzy, refreshing, and very drinkable for a summer brew."
"How do you like them apples? Very much, thank you."
"This is a very drinkable, refreshing summer beer. I drank it on a 90+ day, and it was extremely thirst quenching. There's not alot going on that is very complex, but it certainly did what I expected it to on a hot summer scorcher. It is what it is!"
"A very drinkable and nice brew."
"Cheers!"
"This one pours a hazey light yellow with a white head that sticks around for a while. Very aromatic. As soon as I removed the cap I was hit with the smell of apples. The taste is of wheat and apples and its also a little yeasty. It has a pleasant flavor but I felt as though something was off. I think I was expecting some more sweetness or maybe a little bit of tart because it is an apple flavored beer but overall it's delicious. I'd definately recommend it to anyone."
"Ephemere is perfect for helping your malternative swilling friends graduate to the world of beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slightly thin and watery, the mouthfeel is nothing much to speak of. Drinkability, on the other hand, is excellent. This beer is easy to approach and would be a great way to ease your lesser informed friends off the the Mike's Hard Lemonade, the wine coolers, etc."
"Definitely worth a few. Not my favorite Uni-brew, but definitely a good beer."
"This is an interesting beer from Unibroue and really very different than most every other beer out there. Apple beer. It's a murky peachy color with ample carbonation and little head. The smell is of fresh rinds of Granny Smith apples, perhaps simply some citric acid. The strange smell is in the aftertaste, although the beer itself has a very thin body and a weak malt character. I'd like to see a strong pale given this dose of apple, but instead it's a weak glass of wheat beer. I suppose this is a real quenching beer and easy to drink, but for all it does differently it still fails to impress on the whole."
"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with a huge white head, looks like a quality belgian wit. Smell is all wit too, fruity yeast smell with hints of clove, corriander and a light apple bacound. Taste is very wit-like also, with a nice spicy flavor like corriander and clove, with a light hint of apple, really a nice belgian style wit, im not really picking as much of an apple flavor as i was expecting but its good all the same. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, very refreshing for the summer. The drinkability is good, but the spiciness lowers it a bit."
"Quite drinkable, quite refreshing, and something a novice could devour like a pro."
"Drinkability: Not something to drink everyday, but a worthy summer offering"
"Drinkability: An excellent beer that is good once in a while but not too often. For $5.99 it's not too expensive for such a good beer."
"It's light and active on the palate, and easy drinking. I won't seek this one out too often, but it'll make for a nice summer quaff when I want a light yet tasty treat. Truly pleasant and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Good for the style I suppose. I personally am not going to lay about and drain any number of these. If you want to step back from traditional beery beer for a second, this is the ticket."
"Tasty, well crafted and refreshing."
"Pours a very cloudy light orange color. Maybe the color of applejuice if it was extremely cloudy in appearance. Big white head crops up immediately, then dies down to about a finger. Aroma is very interesting and inviting. Huge fresh cut green apple character, also some pale malt with plenty of yeast. Somewhat vinous in aroma. Flavor starts off with lots of bready malt, not unlike a Belgian pale ale. Bitter green apples quickly come into the picture, adding an acidic bitter character to the semi-sweet malt. Hops are present with the faintest of citrous bittering, and a spicy flash. Yeast is noticeable, as well as the coriander. Finish is slightly vinous, but is a little too sweet for white wines. It is not too far removed from a hard cider. However, the apples are kept in check by the huge malts and it does not drift into the cider category. Kind of a cross between a witbier and a hard cider, yet influenced by Belgian pale ales. Very interesting indeed. Carbonation is crisp and powerful. A little sweet for my liking, but still complex and a good change of pace."
"Had this on-tap at the Flying Saucer in Addison, TX. Served in a chalice, this beer was light with a big bubbly head that fell down to a 1/4 inch sudsy topping. Nose was full of tart apple. I figured this would make me pucker, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the apple flavor somewhat mellow. More like appleskin than tart apples. Mouthfeel though was thin and the beer/malt flavor was subdued. This is certainly a thirst quencher, but I wouldn't make it a regular beer. You could market this beer with the O'Doul's jingle: ""It's what beer drinkers drink when they're not drinking beer."""
"Drinkability: In hot weather this would be a nice light refresher. I can see pagans using it in rituals when they run out of mead or wine. Between the fairy on the label, the sweet-tart apple, and the light character, this has Beltaine written all over it."
"This is a great beer to split with your female counterpart. Anyone that's a fan of light beers would probably appreciate this and it makes a great stepping stone on the way to better beers."
"This is one of those beers that I don't think I would buy a ton of. I can't really handle more than one. This would be a great apperatif (sp?) or desert beer."
"Sampled/enjoyed a large bottle, with a cork and cage. Best before dating on the back label. Opens with a nice pop and burst of aroma. Pours a dull shade of light apricot, clear until the final yeasty pour clouds things up. White head, quickly disappears and this brew leaves very little in the way of lacing. Nose is light fruits and sweet perfume. This is a light fruity brew, pleasantly light on the palate. Notes of crisp tart apples, and some yeast. Sort of a tart, fruity, light Belgian/Canadian wheat beer. Fine brew for a summer lunch, salad, cheese, nuts, you get the picture."
"Sampled at the Southside Beer Expo, Frankfort, Illinois. Golden color, like beer mixed with apple juice. Does anyone remember Shasta Red Apple Soda? This brought it to mind immediately. But the character here is more complex and spicy, of course. No ""cidery"" taste to speak, just a well-done fruit beer."
"Like a fresh apple. Had frrom a warmed bottle at Beer Bistro's Belgian fest, served by Stephen Beaumont himself. Smell of apple, very authentic, smooth. Still can only have so much of it, as sourness and could use more spice? Fruit beers not my main style."
"Nice beer. simple and good, nice dessert tastiness"
"From 341ml bottle. Pours hazy light straw with a small white head that disipates fairly quickly. Overwhelming aroma of apple with honey and light yeast/malt in the background. Apple dominates in the taste as well, almost masking a malty finish with almost no bitterness. My first friut beer, so not sure what to expect."
"Poured a pale hazy yellow with an effervescent head. Very strong apple cider aroma, mixed with some other general tart fruityness. It tasted much the same as the nose, sour and mediciny. Horrible. Very highly carbonated, Sprite-like mouthfeel. This is the only beer I've had to date that I couldn't finish."
"Drinkability and Overall: While beind a pretty refreshing beer, this one has no special or standout qualities to it. The apple flavor is nice, but not as unique as I had hoped. This is one of the more dissapointing beers I've had from Unibroue. It's still not bad though, but keep in mind it's no lambic."
"Comments - The apple gives the beer a unique twist, but overall it still falls flat. Try other offerings from Unibroue befire you get this one."
"Admitted lover of fruit beers, here, so it should come as no surprise that I think this is a great brew. Unibroue consistently impresses me, and this was (if memory serves) the first of their beers I ever tried, and the one I buy most often. The first thing you notice when opening the bottle is that fantastic apple smell. And the pour... what a lovely Belgian head. Mm-boy. The taste is superb, not too tart (which you kind of anticipate due to the Granny Smith aroma) and with a good ""full"" feeling in the mouth. I don't drink this all too often, due to the cost, but my fridge always seems imbalanced without a bottle of it inside."
"For me something is missing in this beer. It is just a bit above average. There is no zing, nothing special like I thought; its a beer that tastes like apples."
"I really enjoy this beer because of its uniqueness and the refreshing fruity but not too sweet taste. Éphémère has a straw opaque color with sparkling carbonation and a strong scent of Granny Smith apples. It reminds me of my first job on an orchard in New Hampshire. The slight sour taste compares to actually biting into an apple, tongue tingling and all. Not a beer to have after a large meal as it tends to tense the stomach after finishing the first glass. This beer would be perfect to serve and a Halloween party along side some pumpkin ale. I love autumn, especially in a pint glass."
"perhaps the meal this accompanied had an effect. i'll have a retaste and offer new notes"
"Thx"
"Pours hazy medium amber, looks like a hefe. 4 fingers head! I think I wasn't very careful on this pour. Extensive retention, had to wait awhile for it to dissipate. Smells fruity (mainly apples) and delicate spice (coriander) with some background notes of malt. Taste was ridiculous. Mild but solid apples with the spice and the malt to keep you noticing it's still a beer. Almost nothing like a beer though. No bitterness whatsoever, everything is just like the title, 'Ephemere'. I only had it out of a 12 oz bottle, I think I need to have the full experience with the larger bottle. Definitely a unique and wonderful brew."
"750 corked/caged bottle served a bit too cold. Hazy cider yellow. Bottle opened with nary a pop, slight apple scent upon opening. Pours fizzy but head drops immediatly. Light, gentle carbonation, though very little malt presense. Spicing does a nice job and dry finish is welcome. I sense very little sweetness in my bottle, unlike some others here. Nothing dominant here, or stand out either. Wouldn't turn it away if offered again, but nothing I would search out."
"Pours a semi opaque golden yellow. The initial head is nice but fades quickly to a thin white layer of foam. Aroma of tart apples predominates. For a summer brew, has a surprisingly denser mouthfeel with a slight bit of creaminess. The flavor of apples dominates the palate, but not in a sickeningly sweet way. Finishes clean and crisp. I think this is a pretty nice beer, although one that I couldn't drink a lot of, hence my lower rating in the drinkability aspect."
"Highly unique, very tasty beer. I love to drink this with meals, especially with good cows milk cheeses."
"Quite a pale colour, much like apple juice with a thin head that disappears quickly. Smelled very fruity, like a white wine with some hints of apple. First sip - wow very tart like a granny smith apple, very highly carbonated with a sharp biting mouthfeel. Not pleasant at all. Drinkability is poor. This is a shitty beer experience. The combo of taste and smell is really rank. Just because you can make an apple beer doesn't mean you should."
"A very refreshing beer."
"Cloudy bright yellow in color. Tight carbonation. Sheeting action on the glass. Aromas are mainly Granny Smith apples with some baking spices and cane sugar. Flavor drops off from the smell. Watery-thin, with a pseudo-apple flavor that I could see used as a masking agent in making liquid forms of pharmaceuticals. Just an unpleasant flavor here. Finish is dry and short-lived. Low body and not very pleasing to the palate. The nasty flavor really hurts the drinkability here."
"Tastes is of yeasty wheat malt and sweet apples. Lightly spicy and with a nice dry finish. A bit sticky sweet in the aftertaste. Mouth is crisp and dry, champagne-like. A decent fruit beer if not overly complex. Nicely done."
"Straw colored with light effervescence a white head (low retention) and sticky lacing. Aroma is subtle; fruity esters, sour apples, spices, yeast and hops. Flavor has a mild sweetness at the start crisp middle, apples, and a dry tart finish. Palate is light bodied and dry with light co2. IMHO: An interesting interpretation of the style. A little light and dry for a fruit beer  more like Champaign."
"Hazy medium gold with lots of carbonation and a thick bone white head. Sour apple aromas meld with some wheat malt. Lovely spice present. Belgian candy sugar noticable. Also has a bubble gum flavor. Dry finish, with a nice apple flavors throughout. A very nice beer. A bit lacking in the mid-palate, but otherwise very good. Worth a try for sure."
"This brew can be summed up as fruity and yeasty. Not bad on occasion, but not something that I would indulge in often."
"If you're in the mood for apple beer, then I'm sure you'd find this highly drinkable. For me, it's not unpleasant but a beer I'd have to be in the mood for."
"750 ml bottle corked with wire closure. As soon as you pop the cork you are hit with a very strong, sweet, apple smell. Pours a light yellow and cloudy color. Label describes it as ""lively"" - was it ever: high foamy, almost fluffy, head. Very active carbonation in the glass, in fact it kept foaming even when glass was half empty. Due to the strong apple aroma, I was expecting a similar strong apple cider taste. The taste was a very light apple flavor (almost disappointing because it was all smell). A nice change, look forward to the next seasonal."
"This is probably one of the lightest looking beers I have ever seen. The only reason I gave a 4 for the the appearance is because of the beautiful carbonation action that this gives off. There is tons of activity going on in the glass. I believe that the aroma is exactly as it should be....ripe apples; and it surely is. I can honestly smell it from about 3 feet away. Its only weakness is that it smells a little too sugary. The taste is wheaty with an apple candy backbone. A tart finish seems to fit well with this beer and somehow the taste comes together. This a nicely flavored ale, but as I expected, 1 would be the most I would have in a session."
"Pours a very hazy light straw color. Big white bone white head forms, but fades into a smaller head, but doesn't completely disappear and lace on the edges of the glass. Intense apple aroma can be smelled feet away after being opened and poured. Surprising because when you actually bring the glass to your nose to smell it, its not quite as powerful as you would think it would be. Very beautiful bouquet of apples, very sweet smelling. First sip is loaded with apples, strong carbonation in the beer expands and explodes in your mouth. Definite flavors of coriander. This beer must also contain a lot of wheat because it has a residual sweetness, yet it finishes fairly dry. The weird combination of apples and malt doesn't mix extremely well, but it leaves a very pleasing apple and wheat aftertaste. Overall this is a good brew, nothing great or excellent unlike the other unibroue beers."
"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a wine glass that's tinted blue, so I can't really attest to the color of the body. Nice-looking, slightly foamy white head. Beautiful fragrant aroma of ale yeast, wheat, and lots of fresh, tart apple. Light, airy body, reminiscent of champagne (not particularly foamy, but airy like it's not even there). Apple and coriander dominate the palate, with a candy-like sweetness in the background. Great accompaniment for the pear almond tart I'm eating for dessert. That's what I'd call it, a dessert beer. Not for sessions, but perfect for pairing with fruity desserts."
"750 ml bottle. Not a very complex beer, but an interesting one nonetheless. I wouldn't search it out, but it sure could be a refreshing glass on a hot day."
"Drinkability & Notes: If it was not for the apple character this would just be plain carbonated water with a little malt on the side."
"Taste: Light like a Hefe, sweet but not syrupy, they made a beer with a lot of balance between the apple and wheat flavor. Very tasty beer? Nope. Very tasty Cider? Better."
"Not bad overall and popular with the ladies."
"Drinkability is extremely high, I would gladly drink one of these every day, even without the apple flavor."
"I generally dont like fruit beers, but this is one of the few that get my vote. Its got a fruit-flavor throughout the taste, without the artificial sweetness that you often find. Very good."
"All in all, a much nicer beer than I expected. Effervescent in mouthfeel, and not at all cloying in flavor, with a surprising amount of depth. Unibroue rarely disappoints!"
"I smelled apple as soon as the cap was twisted off. Pours a glowing peach hue with a fizzy, like cola carbonation, white colored head. Strong green apple aroma, some malt and coriander, quite inviting. Carbonic acid was honestly the first impression after the first sip, highly carbonated. Subtle apple comes mid-palate and then faded to some residual traditional witbier spicings in the finish; dry, light and airy. This would pair up pretty good with some pastry-encrusted baked brie with honey drizzled on it. Not too aggressive, just about enough fruit and spices to appease the senses. My only gripe is it seems overcarbonated; I'll be burping apple Jolly Ranchers for an hour. Drinkability's good, one's enough, though, I could see a severe case of the ""green apple quick-step"" if drank in mass quantities."
"Slightly hazy from the suspended yeast particles, yellow-gold in hue with a very modest peachy influence. A massive bright white head topped the beer; it was at least three fingers in height. Impressive. The head retention was admirable; it slowly faded to a tight cap. The subsequent lacing was patchy but it didnt cling well. Still this is an interesting looking beer and my curiosity is aroused. The nose is airy, it reminds me of a Wit. Wheat aromas start the bouquet, followed by a kiss of marshmallows and dried oranges. There is a very faint suggestion of spice. These aspects are pleasant as is, however this says nothing of the lovely green apple aromas of the finish. The apples dont smell like cider but more like a Jolly Rancher. The potency isnt very strong, this is disappointing, regardless the bouquet is still inviting. In a word the palate could be summarized as refreshing. That said, the beer isnt outright flavorful, sure it is tasty but where is the flavor depth? Upfront is a mild sweet wheat and marshmallow taste, which softens by the middle. Here the green apples emerge and then fade. The finish is malty with a dash of spice, apples, and dried orange peel. Not to mention a kiss of yeasty dough. In the aftertaste the apples reappear. Overall the palate is pleasant but it is far from remarkable. Still Im not complaining drinking this. Medium in body with big, lively carbonation, the mouthfeel is very enjoyable. This is the best aspect of this beer. The effervesce cleans the tongue after every swallow. Refreshing. I bet this beer would kill with pancakes. Yum. The low abv is a plus too. It is an easy quaff. This would make a pleasant lazy warm Sunday afternoon beer. Even though the palate isnt very bold I still enjoy it. I would really like to try it again. Thanks mdings for the sample."
"A treat for the senses."
"Highly carbinated, almost champagnelike, bit too much for me... Taste is not as sweet as the scent would lead you to expect. Pretty dry tasting. Slight chardonnay taste with maybe a touch of green apples. Drinkability would be higher for me if the carb was lower. Decent flavors, not too strong, just nice. Could not do a bunch of this in a sitting, but nice for maybe one or 2 glasses."
"I enjoyed this slightly more than the cranberry version. Pours a hazy golden color, with head that nearly overflows unless the drinker is careful. Smell is sweet and musty, perhaps a little tart. I detect little to no hops here, with the fruit being the primary form of flavoring. A sweet beer, with the apple taste being somewhat shallow. Well carbonated. Not especially complex, this is a simple fruit beer. Somewhat smooth. Drinkability is average. A slight step up from the cranberry, but not by leaps and bounds."
"Bottle: decanted with a hazy honey color...rocky sticky cap...lively effervescence...heavy nose of ripe apples and musty yeast...peppery tongue mingles with a malty apple body and a clean tart spicey finish...very much like an apple wine spritzer fortified with malts. A nice drink"
"The initial taste is pretty much hopless with notes of coriander and orange peel with an apple overtone. Its really not as appley as i imagined it would be. Decent, not great taste. Worth a try."
"This was a beer that I really enjoyed. The appearance was not particularly notable. It poured a light golden color, with average head. The apple smell is very strong, and just makes me want to drink it. The taste is not nearly as potent as the smell, but the apple taste is far from subtle. It is almost a cross between cider and beer, and I really enjoy it."
"Beer is good. Happy fruity beering."
"Ephemere Apple is pretty good stuff. I like fruit beers that add spices to the mix, but don't lose their fruit beer personalities. This is no 'humdrum pomme' but a zesty, snappy, Belgian-influenced apple beer that is winsome and tasty."
"I was skeptical when this beer first came out and didn't try it until recently due to my anti-fruit beer prejudice. I ignored it at my own peril since this was a pretty tasty brew if you keep an open mind. First thing I noticed when I flipped the cap is aroma of apple juice filling the room. I was still skeptical at this point that it was just going to be overly sweet and too fruity, but I was wrong. First sip indicated that it was not sweet but in fact pretty dry and you could actually taste barley malt and not just apples. It was immensely interesting to have the the malt flavor compete with the green apple flavor to see who wins. It was a dead heat - both flavors are winners. Body was light,crisp, and tart which gave it a refreshing quality. When I finished, I was dissapointed that I only bought one."
"Pretty darn good for a hot summer day, and a nice post-dinner compliment to barbecue."
"Right when you pop the cork on this one you smell a sudden burst of fresh green apples. Almost as strong as an air freshener. It pours a large white head. This one has lots of carbonation that adds to the light, crisp, and dry mouth feel. The color is a cloudy yellow orange. The smell is strong of green apple and behind that is the smell of their pale ale, blanch de chambley. The flavor is Tart, crisp, dry, green apple, and a little bitter at the end. The apple flavor is not as strong as the smell would make you think. Overall it seems like the blanch de chambley with some essence of green apple. A MUST TRY!"
"Drinkability/notes: An enigmatic beer that has inspired much pondering and analysis. I suppose it must be said that I liked it, because I would like to have another, if only to better discern its mysteries."
"Drinkability for me was average. This could be a quite drinkable brew if not for the confusing array of notes. I don't think a fruit beer with a Belgian base is really what I would choose if I wanted a fruit beer. Although when compared to other fruit beers out there it is still a very well made beer. If you like fruit beers I'd say give this one a try."
"It has a nice refreshing mouthfeel so I wouldn't hesitate to have another if someone was offering, but I wouldn't go looking for it."
"Numerous food pairings come to mind, I see it as quite versatile."
"This beer poured a cloudy, yellowish color with white foam that settled. The smell was a pleasant, tart green-apple aroma (somewhat akin to Sweetarts) with minimal malt. The taste was dominated by tart, green apples with minimal maltiness and very low hops (if any?). There was also a touch of citrus. The mouthfeel was sharp and crisp with a lot of fruity citrus. The body was medium with low carbonation feel. This was a rather pleasant drink, but you have to like apples."
"I liked this beer on tap, but it was a little more sweeter than I expected it to be. The bottled verison seemed more mellow, but on-tap the flavors really came out. Came in a tulip glass. Looked like a misty lemon color with a nice amount of carbonation that lasted for a long time. Smell was apples all the way, mixed with some light spiciness. Taste was nice, but the colder it was, the better it was I thought. Green apples hit the palate hard and lasted all the way towards the aftertaste. A great dessert beer, but it has to be cold."
"The taste is tart and dry, like a chardonay but better, because its beer. The high carbonation level allows the toungue to experience more flavors but not the sour on the sides of the toungue. Very interesting. Light fluffy, and crisp. Refreshing to sit on the porch on a muggy night and take this down. However, I cant drink the entire 750mL bottle I opened for myself."
"had this as an early evening before the show drink and thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Not my favorite Unibroue but the beer was of the quality that I expect from this exceptional brewery. Served in a tulip glass, excellent carbonation and head for this beer. Wonderful aroma of granny smith apple though this was not overpowering and seem to complement other notes of citrus and spruce. Tastes again of an apple picked fresh from the forest, herbal notes in this beer are too interesting. Nice balance of malty sweetness and hints of hoppy bitterness, make this not a cider but a wonderful beer with some complex character. What to pair this beer with I am not sure but a wonderful beer to sip and savor; a good mellowing beer for a mellow summer afternoon"
"Cloudy, straw yellow with a dense, bright white head. It looked quite fizzy in the glass. It smelled strongly of green apples, with a bit of spice and yeast. The flavour was completely dominated by apples, but was still quite complex. It started with some spiciness, changed to apple sweetness in the middle, and finished with a dry tartness. Also in the finish was a bit of the yeast flavour common to the Unibroue line. It was pleasantly light bodied without being watery -- great for summer."
"Served as 10.5 oz pour at Redbones. Beer was the color of dusty faded cloudy lemon. Aroma was strongly of granny smith apples, rounding out to a bit of syrupy jolly rancher apple. Pleasant medium mouthfeel. I thought there was some yeastiness in the taste, finishing with a slight tart/apple peel taste. A nice and tasty beer."
"As it is, I'm a fan of Unibroue, I like apple flavored candy, so this is a winner... but with the winged fairy goddess on the bottle, and the sweet candy flavor, this is the happy hardcore of beer... enjoy it in small doses, but don't let anyone know."
"Note: 750 mL bottle, best before 5-29-05"
"Éphémère (Apple) was served from a 750ml corked and caged brown bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a hazy golden-straw color, and was topped by an active and voluminous white head that left thick blanketing lacing. The nose was zesty with musty, sharp, and juicy tart apple aromas. Notes of coriander and a lovely rich floral component added the right touch. The taste was mellower than expected, with an initial creamy smooth coriander component, which became more tart and apple-spicy in the transition to an anticlimatic and subdued finish. Only a mild lingering coriander essence remained after the tart flavors abruptly dropped off. I did enjoy the interplay between the smooth coriander and the tart apple. The body was comfortably smooth and full and the carbonation was nice and fluffy. I found this beer to be an easy drinker for the style. Éphémère is an approachable fruity Belgian-style ale that won't wow you but should make for enjoyable beverage."
"Surprisingly refereshing, and higly drinkable, this could double in a lot of situation."
"The taste is ambrosial, again perfectly embodying ripe apples. At first the tongue senses some slight malt, much musk and yeast, and sweet candy flavours. In the middle is a little dryness akin to a good cider, and the finish is all apple. Perfect carbonation and good mouthfeel. Drinkability is high because it balances so well, and it is not particularly strong or pungent. Mmm. Give me this over a warm cider any winter evening. Some may find it quite similar to a hefe, but the apple must DOES make a big difference. Heavenly beer."
"Yellow apple colored hazy brew, with nice white head that falls to thin ring of constant rising bubbles. Smells of good sour green apples dominates here. Tastes light crisp not at all sour like the smell just clean and refreshing with slight apple flavor, with a touch of yeasty bread flavor thrown in. Mouthfeel is medium light and bubbly too much so for my taste. Never been fan of over carbonated beer just never seems right on my tounge. Overall nice experience but was expecting something more."
"Poured a hazy golden yellow color with a white finely carbonated head. The head receded quickly to along the edges of the glass, bit of lacing across the top of the beer. The smell as I poured it from the bottle was sweet, honey-like, and loaded with green apples. The smell of the beer in my glass was little different, though the sweet honey character had mellow into a dull sweetness with the apples themselves. The taste is citric and tart, hint of apples, hint of residual sweetness right before a dry finish. Rather complex, moreso than what I was expecting. I'm still missing flavors because they rush by at full tilt. Mouthfeel is very tart, hint of sourness, very bubbly and light all over the tongue. This is a tasty beer, but not one I'll be rushing out to buy again. Well, not for me, anyway, but the missus will probably demand it again shortly..."
"Drinkability was low. I am having to cap this off after 1 glass to try it again later. I would not buy this ever again."
"A super refreshing brew, I hope Sleeman doesnt kill this brewery and their wonderful beers."
"This beer on tap goes down a lot quicker than the one thats been cellared for a couple of years. Nowhere near as complex, but a real treat to have one thats so fresh."
"12 oz bottle. Poured into Corsendonk glass. Gleaming light golden color. Nice dense bubbly off-white head. Not alot of apple aromas, more of a faint belgian yeasty smell, along with a certain fruitness. First taste has a tart sour apple flavor to it through. Very nicely balanced with that distinct belgian ale body. Nice, tight carbonation. Very good finishing hop crispness, all though the apple flavor is subtle but noticable. Very crisp dry finish with more sour apple snap. Medium to light bodied and very refreshing. Definitly worth a try."
"A good summer brew. I'd drink it again if it were available."
"The taste is of apples and the finish is real crisp. The apple flavor isn't as overpowering as I expected. This brew is very refreshing and worth a try this summer."
"Drinkability continues the all-around quality aspect of the beer."
"This beer smelled like apples and the smell was quite pleasant. It has a yellowish color but a nice head, appropriate for an apple drink. The taste is harder to judge. It does have a strong, sweet apple taste. That seems appropriate, so I don't think I think it is good and appropriate for what they were going for. The drinkability really takes a hit. Do you really need something so sweet? No. If you are in the mood for a hard cider, this may take its place. Very good for the summer."
"A drinkable beer if you're a girl...just kidding, but I'm looking for a little more flavor in a beer. Its drinkable like Coors light is drinkable."
"Overall: A very interesting beer. Another winner from Unibroue. (For the time being, at any rate, since they got bought by Sleeman's.)"
"Notes: A very light beer with a big bold apple aroma that is just a little much. Seems like a belgian wit with an apple cider blend. Cheers!"
"Crisp and dry, very dry almost like a cider, light body, powdery."
"It starts as a cloudy, hazy light yellow-gold with nothing but sour apples, and more sour apples. As such, it is a very good version of sour apple beer. But I guess I was thinking something a little more subtle. I have a hard time rating this beer, because it actually is pretty good at being what it is, but I am not a big sour apple fan, and therefore, this beer is not my favorite. Add the caramel and make it a caramel apple, and you have my vote. As is, I couldn't finish it."
"Am I drinking the same beer as the others who have reviewed this, or was I just expecting something much different? Bright hazy yellow colored with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Nose has a hint of green apples, but is overpowered by the doughey, yeasty smell. Flavor is all yeast, way too strong. I had to hunt for the flavor of the apple, and was then even maybe only imagining it. I tried this with two other craft beer fans, and we all felt that the yeast overpowered and the apple barely surfaced."
"The Jolly Rancher comes back on the aftertaste. I can tell that there's a good beer in there somewhere, but it just has no chance to show itself."
"This is something completely different from the other beers I enjoy, but I think it's a nice change and that it's very well done."
"The beer exploded from the 12 ounce bottle upon opening. It poured a beautiful, super clean gold color with a nice white head which subsided very quickly. Aroma is very dry with just a hint of apple comming through. Taste alludes to it's color; super clean and crisp with hints of apple and spice. This is one clean beer. Very very refreshing. Mouthfeel is fine and bubbly and drinkability is super high. This is a very solid beer. Could definitely be a summer time staple for me."
"Bottom line was that I was just confused by this offering. I'm not sure if the attempt here was to make an ale that compares to apple ciders, or what exactly. I liked it, and I'd probably pick it up again sometime, but the next time I'm in a mood for something this fruity and sparkling, I'll just go and pick up a real cider. A strange and interesting ale for sure."
"This wonderful beer (cider) screams APPLE from the moment it hits the bottom of your glass. The strong aroma of over-ripe, tart apples assaults you...in a good way. The color is a light amber and a medium white head forms on the pour. The yeast from the bottle makes it look like there are actually apple bits floating in the beer (cider). The taste is apple cider, through and through, with none of the off tastes found in most commercially available ciders. This one is extremely tasty, but it definitely tastes more like a cider than a beer. There aren't really many beery qualities at all, in fact. Still, I have a feeling this will find itself in my regular rotation, especially in the warmer months to come. It is very refreshing and extremely drinkable. My only real complaint is that the carbonation level is a wee bit too much. It almost burns your tongue there are so many bubbles assaulting it."
"It is a Belgian Wit with apple juice added. It looks like a typical wit beer; a huge head and a color that is almost white from the cloudy yeast. The aroma is slightly hoppy, but there is a definite presence of green apple. It is a light, crisp, beer that is sweet and acidic. You can taste traces of the coriander and orange peal through the apple taste. This is great for sitting out on the porch and drinking on a warm summer night."
"The dry fruit character makes for a fun, savory drink. The genuine apple presence plays off the other components to establish a refreshing balance. It's an easy quaff, with each sip making the next one even easier. It's not spectacular, but it's solidly good, and a snap to enjoy. It's a seasonal that I'll gladly revisit each year when that time rolls around again."
"The is a great beverage as far a beverages go, but does not get all the way there for a beer."
"Taste was a cross between a wit beer and a wood chuck granny smith cider, although the apple is subdued a bit. I would like to try this beer again during the dog days of summer."
"I've been looking forward to this one. 12 oz bottle pours into a tulip glass a slightly hazy, honey yellow with a three finger head of white, tightlyknit foam. The head retains very well, and stabilizes at 2 cm for the remainder of the glass. Aroma is fascinating, with bubblegum and McIntosh apples, with an array of Belgian-like spices in the background(cloves and coriander). Mouthfeel is a dose of fizzy carbonation, akin to a Belgian pale ale. Taste is surprisingly complex, with a yeasty, mushroom earthiness, tart green apples, fresh baked bread, cloves and coriander. Flavor profile is very similar to a fine Belgian pale ale, with the addition of sour apple. Very nicely done. A very tasty, sipping ale, with a very good drinkability that I found surprising."
"My wife was a definite fan of this beer. One reason is that it has a lot going on that's similar to a witbier, a style that she actually enjoys. It's a very pale and cloudy yellow with a nice soapy white head. It has the esters and phenols I'd expect from the witbier, but without the coriander and orange, although the green apple flavor and aroma actually sends in down a road fairly similar to that of the orange peel. Very quaffable. Not a mind blower, but tasty."
"Lots of apple taste, too. But quite bitter on the tongue, and overall, too chemical in nature for my taste. I've enjoyed many Unibroue beers, but I'm afraid this is not among them."
"Poured into a glass, the beer appeared very light and golden. Its aroma was of green apples and coriander, as I expected from the bottle. The beer was a little too light and dry, with a robust apple flavor. It's rather drinkable, but not exactly something that I'd go out of my way to try. We picked up a bottle for a dinner pairing, and were very pleased with the way it complimented a bacon and apple dressed salad."
"Drinkability: If it was cheaper, I'd buy it by the case for hot summer days. Better flavor than cider, more refreshing than regular beer. Very nice overall."
"This is a cloudy yellow beer, with head that disappears quickly. The smell was a very nice apple smell, but it was downhill from there. I could taste the apple, but the beer was bitter, and also watery. I thought it was a bit too crabonated, and not something I would go for a second time."
"For something similiar but tastier- Wyders dry pear cider!"
"Overall Impression: A real example of the diversity of beer. Without the Unibroue yeast taste, if given to me blind, I wouldn’t even think it was beer. Very fruity and sweet. Glad my wife liked it, I think the whole bomber would start to get a bit old, which would be a shame. This is a great dinner party dessert beer."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer, looks good, smells great, taste is ok, but the fizzbomb factor will steer me away from this beer in the future."
"I've avoided this beer because of an aversion to fruit beers. I should not have waited so long. Very nice brew."
"Notes: Overall a fun beer. Not something you'd want to drink a lot of. Might pair very well with a salad. Good starter beer for a night of tastings."
"This is one delightful brew so off the wall as to be totally memorable. Great dry taste and super crisp mouthfeel. Very good drinkability. Let's vote for motherhood and apple pie. Yeh!"
"Hazy orangy yellow with a frothy head. Intense aromas of granny smith apple. Amazing smell fills the entire room. Touch of wheat and yeast round out the aromas. Taste is of unibroue yeast with a strong backing of wheat and pale malt. Apple adds a touch of sour and thankfully no sweetness. The sweetness comes from the smell and not the taste. Unique and fantastic."
"An interestin appearance...cloudy golden yellow with decent lacing. Distinct green apple smell with some light floral elements..plus a definite yeasty smell. Taste was strongly apple, witha bit of restrained hops in the background.Kind of like a cider, but with a rounded quality that was way beyond what I have ever tasted ina hard cider. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with a very nice dry quality. A touch of a wit beer here, as yeastiness made its presence known from time to time. Very easy to drink. Probably even better during warmer weather...refreshing quality."
"Served with the yeast since this is a wit with fruit. It was actually difficult, had to drink a great deal before I could get to the yeast at the bottom to pour it in even though I'm sharing this with my girlfriend. These Blanche de Chambly glasses hold very little. Anyway, after all of that this becomes a very cloudy banana-colored brew with a large white head that stays pretty well. Aroma of apple Jolly Ranchers, yeasty banana taffy, and vanilla ice cream. Lots of sweetness. Have to give it points on that aroma, it's very unique. It surprises you when it hits your tongue, no non-malt sweetness at all and no invasive fruit character. There's a dose of green apple in there, but it's not overpowering and doesn't take away from the wheaty goodness of this interesting wit. Light-bodied with delicate yeast spiciness and lots of wheatiness with a touch of clove. Minimal hops, but they're there and balance it out well. It's like Blanche de Chambly with apples. I'd say this is a very good fruit beer, and I'm usually not a big fan of fruit beers. Up there with New Belgium's Frambozen."
"Ultimately comparisons with Lindeman's Fruit beers may be made, only this is not at all sweet."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden with a white head. Aroma consists of green apple, yeast, spices, alcohol and banana. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy. Soft green apple, vanilla and malt combine to form the front. Apple flavor seems right on target without being too tart. Yeast flavors emerge in the middle. Finishes with flavors of banana and corriander. Very unique taste."
"Bottle: It pourred a light brew with a faint smell of cider. Huge head with good retention skill. Lot of carbonnation and the usual wheat taste from Unibroue. The spice and apple aroma are too faint and therefore this probably my least favorite from the Ephemere series. I did notice that it is better when drank warm. The sour taste of apple is accentuated. Note: I once drank this on tap and it was way better but can't find it on tap anywhere now."
"A very interesting beer. It pours a hazy yellow color with a huge, frothy white head. Sour apples to the nose, as well as some spiciness. The taste is of apple, a bit of wheat, some breadiness, a hair sweet to the taste as well as the sour apple taste. An interesting change of pace, but I couldn't drink many at one time."
"I bought an ephemere mixer pack. Two bottles each of ephemere original, peach, cranberry and apple. I decided to try the apple first. Hmm, on pour I knew my money was well spent. Voluptuous three finger head that ever so slowly disippated to two. Poured in a newly bought pilsner glass, so I'm excited twice over. New beer, new glass. Anyways, the body is a hazy orange colour. Cloudy and light. Big, pillowy head. Sniff. Hmm, sweet smelling. Like an orchard after rain. A little green apple tartness behind a white curtain of malt. Now for taste. Yummy. Not wow, but yummy. Tart granny smith and/or golden delicious apples, crisp and smooth sweet malt, faint bitterness upon swallowing. Sweet and sticky mouthfeel. Makes the mouth smack just a little after finishing. Excellent, nay, perfect drinkability. I think this beer will soon become standard in my house. This would make a great apertif for a lunch or light supper."
"Drinkability: Exceptionally so."
"The taste is not quite as strong as I would have liked. Much more witbeer than apple. Somewhat dissapointing. The mouthfeel's fairly pleasent, though a bit lighter and more watery than I wanted from it. Not a bad beer, really, but I wanted a little more from it."
"Looks almost like a lemon drop in color. Yellow, cloudy, wonderful. Smell is clearly of green apple fruitiness. Very nice. Bit of hop on the end of the nose. Flavoe is surprisingly dim on the apple flavor. Some fruity esters, but nothing overwheling. Has the same, subdoed, white ale flavor expected from most breweries, but with a slight touch of the apple. A bit disappointing in my opinion, but still quite nice for a refreshing spring brew. A different kind of beer. One brewed to sit under the shade of a tree on a brisk spring afternoon and enjoy. Not an extremeley complex brew."
"Drinkability: All in all this is a very drinkable brew. It would be a great beer to have on a hot day."
"Appearance is a hazy golden yellow with light head that retained well. Heavy aroma of green apples and traces of wheat.The taste of apples is nicely mild without over powering the beer. Feel is light and refreshing with a nice creamy balance.A must try."
"For some reason, I imagined something bigger out of these guys, but all things considered, this is just right for what they're trying to do here. A nice, mild, bright, fruity ale, perfect for desserts, picnics, parties...but nothing I'd likely turn to often."
"Pours to a hazy yellow color with a thick, creamy white head. The aroma is of sweet apples and pears, with a coriander sent as well. It has a very fruity aroma as soon as you pop the top. Amazing fruity aroma, I can't get over. It is a bit yeasty, and medicinal in the aroma as well. The flavor is fruity with the apple, and pear flavors. The flavor flows to a dry coriander flavor in the finish. It is light bodied, refreshing and easy drinking. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall this was just one interesting brew. Sort of a belgian triple mixed with apple cider. It smells like vomit, but… it’s actually pretty good."
"Had this sitting in the refridgerator since summer. It poured a golden yellow color with a thin head. The head lasted through most of the drink. Apples and sweetness were detected in the aroma. The taste was a smooth combination apples, mellow spice, and some bitterness. Very light and refreshing on the tongue, and a mellow tart apple flavor lingers on the tongue. The carbonation was perfect. Very enjoyable, very drinkable, and looking forward to this next year."
"This one just didn't live up to my expectations. It poured a nice light apple cider color with a nice sized frothy head and lots of bubbles racing to the top. Lots of lacing on the sides. The smell was quite sweet and very appley (sp?). Anyways, the taste showed green apple but not in the way I particularly like. Too tart and there were too many spices retarding the apple flavor. Didn't seem to meld too well. With that being said this was still a solid brew that improved the further along I went in tasting it. But I don't think I'll be going out of my way to get this one again."
"Wow what nice offering again from Unibroue,pours a pale yeloow with a huge blooming head,a great aroma of green apples almost like a green apple jolly rancher.Taste is pretty complex much more than I thought,a nice fresh green apple taste with a nice malted wheat flavor with the two combining to make a great finish.Almost to easy to drink its 5.5% is masked very well."
"Pours a cloudy pale gold with a snow-white head. An instant whiff of freshly sliced Granny Smith Apples escapes. A mild aroma of malt and faint hops follow. The light bodied malt possesses a slightly fresh white bread flavor. The big dominant flavor here is tart apples. A mild lime-like flavor and lightly spiced cider taste are noticed in the finish. A champagne-like effervescence carries the flavors all over the tongue, but diminish the presence of any noticeable body. Purchased on Oct. 16, 2003 - the Best Before Date is 05/21/05. This is a light bodied, light colored and relatively low alcohol (5.5%abv) ale with a fairly long shelf life. I wonder how well it will really keep?"
"Foggy pale golden in hue. Mountainous, dogged, burly white head leaves dense, steadfast lace. Candied, sugary, yet vibrant green apple along with bubblegum esters hit the nose simultaneously upfront in aroma. Softer, rounding wafts of orange peel and signature Unibroue juicy lychee like yeast esters surface as the nose adjust and the beer breathes. Understated waft of herbal phenolics. Reminescent of a green apple Jolly Ranchers dropped into a glass of Duvel. Unique, and oddly enticing aromawise. Apple flavors abound in the flavor profile, but are more of a tart, Granny Smith nature. Pronounced, static, bubblegum undertone, lends a lingering suggestion of flavored flouride treatment. Fruit flavors are sharp and extract like initially to the palate, but mellow as the brew breathes, eventually melding with the mild notes of clove and crushed coriander. Sucrose sweetness augments after a deliberation and couples with the persistent green apple theme, yielding a sweetened, sparkling apple cider impression late. Whimsically spritzy in mouthfeel, light in body, and nearly refreshing. Bitterness is mostly curacao derived, and the paltry hop presence leaves fruit and yeast character unhindered. Finishes surprisingly juiceless, with an abrupt note of tart apple marmalade. Quite an odd brew. Akin to a Belgian wit / cider hybrid. Although it grew on me as I drank it, I don't forsee myself getting another bottle anytime soon. Enjoyable, but certainly not a showstopper. A 750 ml portion is enough for my palate."
"2002 version. Yellowish apple ciderish color, very hazy. Large creamy soft head. Aroma is apples, dough and cinnamon. A medium bodied fruit beer. Very Spritzy. Lively carbonation. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. The apple flavor is very subtle and is more tart than sweet. There is a touch of wine cooler-ishness to it, but its most definitely a beer. This is a perfect beer to sip on a hot summer evening. Yet another interesting beer from Unibroue. Mouthfeel is full and soft. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Not as tart in flavor, or even as appley as the granny smith on the label would leave one to believe. Clearly ale made from grain, and nowhere near cidery. Lovely subtley with suitable complexity: brisk flash of biscuity malt, zip of citrus peel hops and third, the real apple flavor. Short, refreshing, light finish of fruit and grain."
"Pours a very pale straw with a pure white head of foam. The smell is instant apples. One does not have to stick their nose in the glass at all to find the apple.. The smells wafts towards you from across the room. The taste is well, surprisingly light. In fact, I was rather dissapointed. I could taste the apple, and some yeasty breadiness, but other than that the taste was so light and ephemeral (hence the name) that i kept wanting more richness. This is not to say that its a bad beer, and it would be brilliant to cook with or drink as an appertif in the summer. I guess i was just looking for something with a bit of a more full- bodied flavour. I would give it another try and certainly drink another, just not on a chilly night after a long day of work."
"This brew is in keeping with Unibroue's trademark appearance. It's a hazy yellow-gold with those nice champagne-like bubbles and frothy white head. My six year old daughter instantly smelled apples from half-way across the room. The smell is a wonderful combination of tart apple and a musty Belgian yeast smell. The taste is dominated by apple, but citrus smells are pronounced at the start but fade a bit after it sits a while. It's a very refreshing and interesting beer. Not an everyday beer but a nice change from the usual."
"Quite a complex warm weather style brew and who couldn't picture themselves sprawled out on a lazy lawn with some soppresata, double cream cheese and an Ephemere? Quite good."
"It is light and crisp with tingly carbonation. The sweetness of the nose carries through in the flavor. It is not too sweet, but it is up there. Some grainy notes balance it well, and the apple presence is toned down to a suitable level. It is very drinkable, but definitely not one to judge Unibroue by."
"The beer is quite murky (like a young cider) and a light brown color, poured with no head at all. It has a pleasing cidery aroma. The flavor is very dry with a subdued apple taste. Not too much flavor over all. I was expecting a bit more excitement from this beer, though it was not bad overall"
"Drinkability  Not my cup of tea. Ive had a few fruit-flavored ales that Ive liked, but this one didnt make the grade. Sorry."
"Pours a pale hazed straw with a white head. Tart apple is an underlying theme that this beer is constructed around. To say that this is apple beer is to mock the complexity of the brew itself. Yeast, and many spices also show up in the profile. The tart start and finish of the brew make it quite the drinkable. This is one of the better Unibroue Ephemere brews."
"A beclouded lemon yellow with the head voluminous in stature, color brilliant white, frothy in texture and as it dissolves a velum like sheet of lace forms to conceal the glass. The aroma of tart Granny Smith Apples hits your nose first, then the underlying malt sweetness with a citrus like crispness, a real treat for the senses. Start sweet and the top middling in its feel to the palate, the finish has a stinging acidity, very, very dry, tart with the hops present but understated in their spiciness, quite a treat as Fruit beers do not rank high on list of beers. Having said that I will definitely hunt up the other varieties, as it is quite intriguing."
"The flavor confirms what the aroma hinted at. An average Belgian wit, with a moderate to strong apple flavor and a little late spicyness. Not very complex, but a little above average for a fruit/vegetable beer."
"Medium-light body & highly carbonated. A decent summer offering."
"This is a very refreshing beer, with its fresh fruit character and light body, but given that seemingly light body, the stickiness left after sipping this is surprising. The dominance of the Belgian yeast is offset very nicely by the fresh green apple aroma and flavor."
"Éphémère is a good choice for a refresher during the hot days of summer."
"This is a smooth tasting, well balanced beer. It is a nice change of pace to other styles that are out there. I think this beer may appeal to those wine drinkers who snub anything made out of malt."
"Color is a very light cloud of hazy yellow with a thin white loose head that fades fast and leaves very minimal lace. Smell is apple-isious! Lots of green apple with the skins even, not cidery tart, more like a subdued creamyness like an apple shampoo, has some banana, pear and musty notes. Not all that strongly pungent but wonderfully complex and subtle. Taste is sparkly smooth with an easy going apply bite of green apple, with the skins too, light pear and banana with a smooth yeasty finish and a fading soft crispness. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, easy, refreshing, interesting, fun, unique, another Unibroue keeper."
"Notes: Flavor profile doesn't quite do it for me. May re-review down the road. Pour with caution."
"I poured this beer from the 750ml bottle to share with two friends. Immediately, we could detect the fragrant green apples. It smelled incredibly fresh. The color was a nice light golden color with a cloudy appearance. There was a nice head to it that did stick around for a little while. The taste was quite refreshing and while the apple was quite evident, it was overpowering. It had a light mouthfeel which made it very easy to enjoy. There was a nice yeasty after taste. I do not recommend drinking this as quickly as one might another refreshing beer, but rather drink it as slowly as you would any other nice beer that you wish to fully appreciate."
"Very pale straw colored beer is topped by a fluffy white head that seemingly lasts longer than summer itself. The aroma of green apples hits you as you open the bottle. Once in the glass, more of a spicy wheat aroma greets the nose. The taste is very light, almost like ""Sierra Nevada wheat light", but with an overlay of green apple. Very refreshing and nice. Pretty dry finish. Moreso than just about any beer I can remember. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy. A bit too light for my tastes, but this beer pulls it off well. Drinakbility is decent, but this is not my first choice of a summer quencher. Give me a hearty hefe over this any day. Still, a solid beer from Unibroue."
"ok i heard alot about this and i was really stoked to see it in my local beer shop so i immediatly bought a 750ml bottle and ran home. upon opening it smelled of lovely green apples (the cork still smells like apple candy) and it poured out a golden yellow with a nice white head. the taste was somewhat of a let down though. didnt really have the strong apple taste that the aroma hinted too, it kinda tasted like a watered down hefe with just a hint of green apple. i dont know, but i just didnt dig it at all. i was decent, but not at all what i had expected. the mouthfeel was nice and light with good carbonation and it was refreshing. i only had a glass full and was done with it, damn."
"Very nice, this one. Especially as a summertime thirst quencher. Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy gold. CO2 surges to the top like water falls at Niagra. Incredibly bubbly, sort of reminds me of champaigne. Head is thick, white, and fluffy; very long lasting. Smell of green apples is incredily strong. Smell is tart, and somewhat candy-like. Underneath the apple, if you can dig that far, is a smell of grainy wheat. Flavor at first is heavily laden with Granny Smith apples. It also has a very grainy wheat flavor, more noticeable after a few sips. Aftertaste is only slightly fruity, and rather big on the wheat. Light bodied brew, with a very rough mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable on this hot August evening. Thirst quenching, and flavorful. Definitely a brew for my fridge next summer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Again very light and refreshing with a crisp taste. Very easy to drink on a nice summer day."
"Overall: My hats off to Unibroue, since coming to the States and trying many of their beers, they have truly impressed me no-end with all of them. They are definitely one of the greats thats for sure."
"This beer poured a pale yellow color that had a slight haze to it but was very well carbonated. The head that was produced was an off white head that had a creamy consistency and lasted fairly well, but when it fell, it went fast. Some lace visible, but nothing outstanding. The aromas were mostly of green fresh picked granny smith apples, some spices were present (clove, cinnamon, coriander), wheat grains and other fruits could be smelled (banana, orange, lemon). The tastes were a mirror to the nose, mostly green apples, wheat grain, fruits (lemon, banana), spices (clove mostly with some coriander). It left an aftertaste of fresh apple pie with a wheat flour crust. It was light bodied. It started off a little on the over carbonated (sharp) side but calmed down fairly fast. It reminded me of champagne with apples in it. For a hot summer day this beer was very refreshing  it quenched my thirst and was pleasant to drink."
"Yet another thanks to Kluk for this one. Apparently Premier just got it in. What an outstanding cure for the apalling Utah heat! Poured a hazy golden orange with a whipped white head. This is one of the best smelling beers I've had. Unibroue yeast and wheat at the base with an ethereal sour apple aroma dancing around. I wanted my small glass to turn into a pitcher so I could chug it! Taste was refreshing wheat/yeast with a very subtle sweetness (the smell was deceivingly sweet, but I was glad to find the taste not so). Finish was crispl and slightly tart with powerful granny smith apple notes ( but not sweet like cider). The apple notes lingered. Best ""summer beer"" I've had this year."
"Wow, what a nice aroma this beer has! Immediately after popping the cork on this 750mL bottle, pleasant thoughts of sour apple Jolly Ranchers come to mind. It's very fizzy and the head is enormously fluffy. Dry on the palate this beer is...very crisp. The apple flavor is pretty reserved but very pleasant. I'm not too familiar with coriander and curacao, so I didn't know what to look for in the flavor for them. But this is a wonderful brew that's not too sweet, not too sour, with just the right amount of everything."
"A lovely beer, great for summer quaffing."
"I always anticipate anything new I get to try from Unibroue, which is absolutely a world class brewery. On to Ephemere, an intriguing beer indeed. Pours a pale apricot with only light visible through the glass. The head is big and very fizzy dissapating quickly to nothing and there is no signs of lacing on the glass. The nose is faint with an apple sweetness. This is a very balanced beer with a definite apple theme that is not overdone. Sweet red delicious apples support the malts up front and almost lip puckering granny smith apples travel with the hops in the back end. There is a refreshing bite from the carbonation and the finish is dry. Overall this is a very unique beer that is extremely drinkable. I would have no problems drinking a 750ml or two...."
"Pours a yellowish color with a nice tight white head. Aroma is strongly apple scented with a bit of spice underneath. Taste was kind of a surprise with the apple flavor very subdued and very well balanced. There was no sickening sweetness or overpowering fruitiness as in some fruit beers. Overall a good beer but nothing I would go out of my way for."
"This is such a beautiful thing! This is what ""fruity"" beer should taste like. The crispness of the apples and mild hint of hops combine religiously, making this one bad ass brew. The little fairy on the front is pretty cool too. The smell is of very strong apples, so I was expecting something sugary, but alas, it was not. The head lasted a little bit, but died down in the end, which was to be expected. I am gitty like a school girl over this one! Horray for Unibroue and another one of thier fantastic beers! Canadians aren't all bad."
"The beer pours a hazy light gold color with a frothy white head. The aroma is spicy. There is a great aroma of green apples here. The taste is much the same. Apple flavor comes through, but the spices added make this a much more complex brew. It's smooth, highly refreshing, and Belgian like in taste. The mouthfeel is good. This is a light bodied beer. I love this brew; a real good sessions beer and a break from the norm."
"Pours with a hazy golden color with a large white head. Aroma is of orange and coriander. Taste is very citrusy and finishes with the flavor of cider. Not as much apple flavor I expected, but I got a great tasting belgian wit and the apples add another dimension of flavor."
"Appearance is similar to a wit.....hazy light golden. Approaches apple juice color, but not quite that pale. The nice looking dense white head has good retention. Aroma is delicate, but quite nice. Sweet apple, cinamon sticks, must and fruitcake. Nice tasting thirst quencher. Takes just a little getting used to on the first try, but it definitely grows on you. I am happy to discover that this beer is not very cidery or acidic. There's just a little tart senstion, but not a lot. I reminisce about the green apple taffy I enjoyed during my youth as I drink. The musty undertones really add a pleasant quality to this beer. Just a slight amount of bittering is noticed. Lively carbonation is noted in the mouthfeel. Body is a little better than medium. I like this one."
"Pours a hazy golden color.Has a great aroma of apples with some spicyness and yeast notes.A really distinct taste- light ale with hints of apple.Beers like this are really not my thing but this is quite nice.There's a certain spiciness that comes thru the tart apple flavor.An effervescent mouthfeel completes the picture.Overall I would have to say quite an enjoyable beer.Has a very unique flavor and a great tartness thats perfect for a summers day.Dont know if I would have more then 2 but still very nice indeed."
"Taste was not as fruity as the nose, moreover a subtle mix of wheat finesse, the light golden malt of a summer ale, a tiny bit of spice from coriander and curacao, and the nascent sweet and sour of the apple adding some character in the background. Had an easy slide of a mouthfeel, suprisingly no fizz. An inviting drink, good though not the best fruit beer, but definitely better than most."
"Pours out to a pale golden, forming a huge pure-white sea-foam head with superior retention and nice lacing. Adding the yeast turns it a beautiful murky white. Carbonation is strong. Aroma is intoxicating....fresh green sour apples perfectly in harmony with the trademark Unibroue yeast notes...cloves and a hint of banana to round it out. One can smell green apples across the room. Oh boy...what a taste. Amazing stuff this is...tastes exactly as it smells, however the green apples are not as strong as I would have thought by aroma, but still tart and juicy, complementing the crisp wheat and delicate pale malt body. Mouthfeel is spritzy like champagne with a brisk, clean mouthfeel and slightly astringent finish. Hops are only in the background and slightly perfumy and contribute just enough bitterness to complement the sweet apples. Very easy to drink, however I would have liked just a tad more malt sweetness. This is great stuff...indeed another masterpiece from Unibroue. I can only imagine what the peach tastes like."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Aug 4th, 2003: I honestly don't much see the point in a granny smith beer. Pours a murky yellow with a medium white head. Quick lacing. Strong aroma of sour apple and wheat. Light-bodied with a character consistent with other beers of the style. Sour apple dominates the flavor, along with some wheat and spice in the background. The finish is rather crisp and stays with the apple theme. Not bad for what it is, I just don't see the point in beers like this."
"Flavor is much less apple-y than I had anticipated. The malts and coriander come through very nicely, and the balance is wonderful. Apple is the perfect choice for the style, which i believe is something close to a witbier. The coriander is very spicy, and lends the perfect compliment to the sour apple flavoring. I'm not sure what curacao tastes like, but an odd sweetness seemed to mingle with the apple, so perhaps that was it. Malts are light, and allow the other flavors to take precedence. Body is very light, and the carbonation is perhaps a bit too high for my tastes. Almost like champagne, with vigorous small bubbles. I'm not really into that, but I can't say it didn't work for the beer. Great summertime quaff."
"Drinkability: hard to believe there's any alcohol in this beer. Very easy to drink but best as a post-dinner dessert beer. I shared this with my wife (a moderate beer drinker) and she loved it. Perfect for unwinding at the end of the day."
"Light bodied and refreshing, but just not tasty enough (even apart from the off-flavor) to make me want to drink much of it."
"Overall Impression: Unibroue is just an amazing brewery. This is another great innovation of theirs. I'm thoroughly impressed. The bottle label says, ""Truly, a refreshing summer delight in every sip."" I couldn't agree more. My girlfriend who doesn't drink beer at all (aside from the sips I require her to take of every beer that I have) said it was her favorite one she has tried so far. And that says a lot! A testament to the likeability of this beer, atleast."
"A good ale that pours a thick white head, leaving little lace. There is a distinct apple flavor with good carbonation but there is a lemon citrusy tartness to it. It has a clean mouthfeel and finishes smooth. Light summery brew, very easy to drink a few of these."
"($7.99 / 4-pack)"
"Drinkability - This is a specialty kind of selection, and not something I would drink regularly, yet I would buy it to share with others as a classy alternative to the standard ale. Its fruitiness lends itself well as a tasty summer pick."
"Pours a lovely hazy golden sunrise color with a foamy bright white head that dissipates into a rich lace. The instant you open the bottle, a strong aroma of fresh picked apples is apparent. Once poured into the glass, a light underlying yeastiness was also detectable. Moderate in body with a spritzy and zesty texture from the strong carbonation. Taste is sweet candied sugar and tart green apples with a bit of fruity yeast. (reminiscent of an apple-flavored Jolly Rancher). Finish is crisp and quite clean. One of the best (possibly the best) fruit beers Ive had the pleasure to drink."
"Boy this is good!! Maybe it's just that it's summer and this hits the spot. I love the honey-cream color, and the puffy white head on this beer. The nose is that of granny smith apple ala jolly rancher candy. The taste is that of a good French cider, yet with a great beer taste on the tail end. The bubbles here are fine (like champagne), and the mouthfeel is superb, with very fine, again, Champagne like carbonation. The addition of orange and coriander is ever so faint and does wonders for this beers overall complexity. A cleansing bitterness prevails on the finish and baits you for another try. A cool breeze on a warm summer night-delicious!!"
"Hazy and light greenish-tinged yellow color. Massive soft white head, really cottony. Laces in large dots. Hard to get past the apple in the aroma, but there's also a sense of sharp goat cheese and a prickly spice. Compared to the smell, the flavor is quite muted and fluffy, coriander leavens apple and is joined by a pumpkin pie impression. A bit of ester. Light and well carbonated. Slight currant and citrus aftertaste. Not really my style, I actually like to hold my nose on this and somewhat limit the apple aroma's impact on the overall flavor profile."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy dark golden color with a huge 4 finger head which has great retention. Big chunks of lace are left down the side of the glass. The smell is rich in sour apple, like a sour apple blowpop. There seems to be some alcohol to the smell, even though it's a low abv. The taste has some apple tartness, with a bit of spice, probably from the coriander added. It has to be one of the most refreshing brews I've ever had. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy, just a little bubbly. The drinkability is very nice, and I could put away a few of the 750mLs easy. Definately going to get some of the big bottles on my next beer run!"
"Bottle conditioning announced itself with a gigantic head that filled the glass after just the first few ounces were poured. Seltzery white tiny bubbled, the head settled down after a few moments and I was able to fill the glass. The aroma is perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this beer. Granny Smith apples, more to the candy-ish Jolly Rancher side of the spectrum, but as the beer warmed a sweet, cotton candy element emerged as well. The green apple notes were more subdued in the flavor, and could have been taken more for a yeast by-product than a brewing adjunct. The overall effect was a Belgian take on fruit beer. Not spectacular, but interesting."
"Highly effervescent,cloudy straw yellow with a ful size white foamy head which dissipated to a semi-thick layer of foam. Aroma is yeasty, tart and green apples. Very crisp with flavors of apples, wheat and coriander. This is a nice refreshing brew that I thouroghly enjoyed."
"Lovely lookingbeer. Pours a thin, white head. Head lasts a while, but cleans the glass -- no lacing at all. The beer is a solid yellow color. Aroma? Apples, of course! Green apples. Smells a little poppy, too. Taste? Apples! tastes nice. Not sweet like a cider. Very crisp. Refreshing. A nice summer drink, but only one every now and then, please."
"Good. It's a little tastier than the original (because of the apples), but it's not really exciting. It does get pretty nice at temperature, though: apples butter and pepper."
"This beer pours a yellow color with a moderate head and little lacing. The aroma was filled with apples and not much more. The flavor tasted like a 50/50 mix of your normal Unibroue beer and apple cider - quite enjoyable. It was a little sweet but it was very well balanced. This is a good beer and I would recommend trying it."
"When first poured, it was a straw yellow with a slight green hue with a rich white head. The smell of fruit reminded me of apples, ""Granny Smith"" and ""Macintosh"" for starters. The taste was mostly of apples and a hint of orange and spices. The front of the bottle says, ""Ale Brewed with Apple Juice, Coriander and Curacao"". It was not overly sweet or bitter, but, there was an effervesent feel in my mouth after each sip. Very well balance for an ""Ale with Fruit", which makes this beer, very refreshing."
"This poured a hazy yellow color with a meringue-like white head. The brew is highly carbonated and that hits you on the roof of your mouth. Lots of complex green apple and spice flavors. It finishes quite cleanly. This is a very nice warm weather beer."
"Ephemere pours a deep golden color with a huge, bubbly head. A steady stream of carbonation is present. The head retains well, leaving trails of lace down the glass. Aroma is mainly of tart green apples, although notes of coriander, citrus rind and yeast are evident, as well. Taste is big on green apples up front, obviously, but lingering behind are orange rind, clove, and coriander. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, despite the carbonation that is obviously present. This is a light-bodied brew for the most part, although it can be filling. Overall, while this brew is not overly sweet nor sour, the apple flavor lingers after the final sip. A quality fruit beer all around, and an excellent one to have on hand in the summer months."
"I used a flutish/pilsner glass as recommended on the bottle and man be careful it pours like champagne. Straw yellow color with a huge sticky white head. Candi sweetness, bubblegum, and green apple in the nose. Initial wheat dominance followed by some spice and then apple skin and a touch of white pepper. A nice refreshing wheat beer with some tart apple but it is not overly sweet. The brew shows good balence and has some nice richness and smoothness in the mouth and on the tongue. Refreshing brew. Dry on the tongue on the finish."
"Drinkability: Pretty good for what it is. I couldn't drink this all night, nor would I want to. However, it is a very well done brew...in the hit or miss world of fruit beers, this is definitely a hit. Hours later, I'll still be burping apples..."
"Hazed white color with a dense white head -- tiny bubbles! Big apple aroma slides over the top of a subtle bananas foster scent. It tickles the nose just gently. While drinking it, the mouthfeel dominates with high carbonation and a fantastic dry finish. The beer has a clear and well-defined, though subtle, sweet apple presence that finishes with a brief peppery note. For some reason, I just think it could be a little more exciting. The slightest hints of ripe granny smith apple peel resides in the aftertaste. A very pleasant summer refresher and definitely worth the purchase at $5. Another solid Unibroue offering; how the hell do these guys do it?"
"Body is thin and the acid in the finish provides a light tang that matches well with the spritzy nature of the carbonation."
"This beer poured a hazy yellow color and formed a huge foamy white head that left trace lace as it quickly subsided. An aroma of apples and spices, with a hint of yeast and butter. A flavor of hops, spices and butter. A fairly light and slightly sprite finish. A very drinkable beer."
"Hazy gold, I can compare it to the color of apple sauce with a huge two fingered creamy bubbly white head. Aroma is fragrant of green apple tones, spices characteristic of Unibroue, and notes of a slightly musty yeast the complements the overall aromatic expressions of this beer. Taste well, the granny smith green apple flavor is not really detectable within the flavor as much as in the aroma. The light creamy apple sour tone and high carbonation mixed with the spices of this lighter palatable ale add an very nice twang to the flavor profile. Drinkability a definite easy going beer very drinkable great retreat from the summer heat one well done fruit flavored ale, I can't say I always care for them usually hit or miss I am glad this one connects."
"Brisk and sharp and slightly tart. Mouthfeel is crisp but also slick. Strange to taste apples in my beer, but the result is a very refreshing, very drinkable beer."
"Quite yeasty on the palate, and a bit dilute in the midpalate. The apple is there, but its nowhere near as strong as it is on the nose. Sort of like a watered down Fin du Monde with apple added. The apple does contribute tannic length (thanks MJR!), and the mouth-feel is all bottle-conditioned soft fine carbonation. An interesting beer, but not one I'm sure I'd have again (although I'm still burping apple the next morning, so in a way . . .)."
"Note:I rarely give out 5's but IMO this deserved it."
"750 ml bottle best before 5-1-05. Pours a hazy straw color in the glass. Head slowly builds to a mountain of white foam. Aroma is sweet floral scent with a bit of coriander. The first sip reveals a much drier beer than I had imagined. The apple juice doesn't add much sweetness. The taste is also far more subtle than you might think with a fruit beer. Very subdued appple flavor. The other thing that is quite noticeable about this beer is the mouthfeel. It is like soft water. Carbonation is not harsh and is silky on the tongue. I've got one for the cellar too."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It poured out to a chalky, cloudy, golden color in the glass. The aroma is excellent. Light apple and other fruit. The taste was quite good. The apple is done just right, not overbearing at all and combined with the spices made for a nice, summertime-style, treat. This beer actually reminded me of drinking champagne. Definetely worth a try. I'll be revisiting it before summer is over."
"Cloudy golden/orange pour with a huge head. Light fruity nose highlighted with apple, a hint of dried apricot and some spiciness. The taste to me was of less apple than the nose had suggested. In fact i would say it was somewhat light and creamy with a ""bubblegum"" finish. Not sweet at all but more subtle and refreshing. Not bad as an overall beer drinking experience."
"As usual, Unibroue has produced a solid, respectable beer. It's not their most complex or ground-breaking beer, but what is a run-of-the-mill beer for Unibroue could be considered a triumph for just about anyone else."
"A bottle has already been put away to age a bit."
"edit (2010): It's been seven years. My opinion remains the same. I was given a bottle, so I drank it. I still wouldn't spend any of my own money on one, though."

"Pours a hazy yellow-gold body that's topped by a frothy bright-white head that displays excellent retention and maintains a firm 1/2"" cap throughout. Unfortunately, it leaves only minor spotty lace. The bouquet expresses an amazing aroma of fresh-picked Granny Smith apples. It's lightly sweet and tart (and yet there's no tartness in the flavor?) - very enticing! It's light bodied and crisp with a zest on the tongue. The flavor delivers much less than the aroma might lead you to believe, but it's still quite nice. Soft apple notes combine with some yeasty fruitiness atop a thin, well-attenuated and lightly sweet malt. It's quite delicate, and somewhat one-sided, but nice. It's very reminiscent of a light white wine. And although it does have a great drinkability in that it's light bodied and refreshing, I was left looking for something more."
"Pours out a slightly pale gold colour, big head (it is Unibroue, after all), and fine carbonation. Oh how I love these big bottle conditioned beers. Nose brings some light apple scents which instantly fill the room as soon as the cork is pulled. These are acompanied by a slightly bready, yeasty note. Flavour: well, the short description on the bottle says ""beer on lees with apple must"". That's absolutely perfect description of the taste. This is apple, but soft and light - unlike Niagara's unique all-out apple attack. Must is evident, with yeast, bread flavours. Think clean laundry as it comes out of the dryer (w/o Bounce or similar sheets) but in a good way. Mouthfeel is classic bottle conditioned, light, energetic, happy. Drinkable? Yes! This is good beer. Can't wait for the Ephemere mixer pack to make it to Ontario (I know it's coming...)."
"Bon Chance!!"
