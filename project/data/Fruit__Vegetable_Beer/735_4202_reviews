"Overall: Not a great summer brew. Awesome cans, but that's where the awesome ends."
""
""
"This is the perfect backyard BBQ beer. Smooth and crisp with a delicious blend of watermelon that isn't too overbearing with little after taste. An all around perfect beer for those late summer nights in the yard with friends."

"horrible.. one of the worst ever"

"I have to give it the grade I did in a hats off manner. Just given the fact that they actually accomplished a watermelon note blended with a fruity wheat flavor is somewhat exceptional to me. Not that it's a great beer, but bc if the feat itself. I can't say I'll ever have another, but this is proof American brewers are yet again pushing the limits of flavor."
"It poured a milky golden with a reasonably nice head. The smell was a lot less pungent than I had expected, citrusy sweet notes with some of that wheaty body. The taste was...interesting. At first I almost spit it out. I was overwhelmed by the watermelon. But I steadied myself and kept trying it. The taste settled and it actually became rather pleasant. It's a nice drinking beer on a summer day, but nothing to write home about. Unless you're going home for the summer, and need a beer to drink for that."

"Delicious summer beer watermelon taste is just right not to sweet."
"Poured into tulip. Hazy yellow a tiny little bit pink. Smell is good yeast and wheat and a bit of sour watermelon at the end. The taste is dryish straw like. Good feel. With watermelon rind at the end. I was excited seeing this beer but the watermelon was sour and drying. I'd still buy it again though"
"This is a great summer beer for a hot day by the pool. Love it"

"Just a hint of watermelon in the finish. Other then that it's no different then a coors light"

"Overall I like this beer, a nice subtle watermelon flavor with a bit of peppery bite.  It does feel a bit watery though, which can be good or bad depending on what your looking for.  I find it good on a lazy hot day during summer icy cold.   The can art is great as well."

"Something different, has a jolly rancher watermelon vibe to it. I'd get it again if I saw it."

"O: Gets a little cloying with the watermelon after one or two, so it's not the most seasonable wheat beer. Nice on warm summer days while floating in the pool. Worth a try if you're into fruited wheat beers"

"Wheat on the front of this beer that quickly transitions to watermelon. This lasts for a few sips and the intense flavor of the watermelon dissipates. This is a very bright and crisp beer very light mouth feel . This beer at the start has a candy like quality to it. The watermelon is a little strong at the start but this subsides quickly and the beer has this nice light fruit flavor to it."

"I am lucky enough to have tried this at 21st Amndt. in San Francisco on draft served with a fresh watermelon slice! Yup it is not complete without the fresh fruit. And please don't judge by the from a ""can"" experience, I think it develops a metal residue flavor which I could actually pick up on. Draft only for this one please. Enjoy"
""
"The freshest and most refreshing watermelon beer. It's not fake and its not too sweet. If you're looking for a beer, choose something else. But if you want a watermelon delicious-ness (thats still a beer), buy one."
""
"D - Not a bad beer by any means... The watermelon addition is a compliment to the base wheat beer and doesn't dominate in any means... A nice summer sipper, but not something that I would indulge in on a regular basis... I'm a big fan of 21st Amendment and if this is my least favorite beer they make, they're doing something very right..."
""
""
""
"If you're looking for a beer that honestly tastes like watermelon (for some reason), here you go. Watermelon beginning until the end when a wheat character comes in to cleanse the palate a bit. I actually really enjoyed this beer and would definitely buy it in the summer if it were available in Michigan."

"Taste / Palate: It’s lightly bodied and like it’s aroma it has light pale bready and wheat maltiness with a light sweetness and an equally balanced watermelon flavor. Again like it’s aroma it also has a slight mineral flavor note and just a very light herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Notes: This is definitely a hot summer day or lawn mower beer. It’s thin and light making it easy drinking and interesting. It like that the watermelon taste is natural and some candy like flavoring added to a light wheat beer."

"O- This beer serves its purpose as an innocuous, inoffensive wheat beer with some watermelon flavoring thrown in to make it a bit different. It's a quaffer, great for music festivals and sporting events where you just want something semi-refreshing and accessible to gulp and share with friends. Especially good for the non-beer-loving females. In the overall scheme of things though, there are much better things to be drank out there."

"I loved the way the watermelon added to this beer. Not overpowering sweetness, just some light melon flavor in the background, refreshing yet slightly dry. This is an excellent summer, hot weather beer. Nice wheat backbone, pale golden in color, light foamy head."

"O: Someone was bound to make a watermelon beer eventually, and I'm glad 21st Amendment did. This kind of beer isn't my thing - while it's refreshing, I can think of more enjoyable beers that do the same basic thing. Try it if you really like watermelon, otherwise get something else."

"Overall this is just not the beer I expected. It's not a decent wheat beer and I really only get a TINY bit of anything resembling watermelon or fruit. That being said it's not a bad beer but it isn't much better than a bud or something. I would not recommend this beer as it was a total letdown."

"A perfect beer for hanging out back with a bbq. easy drinking...slightly fruity. Some citra hop presence would have put this beer over the top....it would of complemented this watermelon nice. Go get it."

"Akin to Abita's Strawberry Harvest, the ale underneath the fruit offers tepid support and the fruit, though truly seductive seems a bit contrived. If the balance is off, then it is beautifully off. I have a soft spot on my palate for these types of beer."

"Normally, I stay away from fruit flavored beers because they often come across tasting like candy or are just too sweet for my liking. But not with Hell or High Watermelon. You get a hint of the watermelon and it doesn't over power other parts of the beer. It's actually one of my go to beers to bring to summertime BBQ's at the neighborhood pool. It's very refreshing to drink on a hot summer's day."

"Interesting beer. It is straw colored, with a small head. Faint haze. Vegetal smell...not quite watermelon, but rather a watermelon rind and stem. The taste, though, is very summery, full of farm watermelon. One of the more unique beers I've ever had. Light and dry, but very genuine. Interesting and fun."

"O: Not real good. I finished the glass but didn't really want to. Don't like the watermelon that is there, and there isn't a lot of it. As far as a wheat beer its light and pilsner-like, grainy and grassy and watery. Just not my favorite but not terrible."
"12 ounce can, canned on 6/27/13. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing. The brew smells mostly like sweet and bready malt, along with a bit of watermelon Jolly Rancher candy. The taste is similar to the aroma, except that there's more balance between the malty and watermelon flavor. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's smooth and easy enough to drink. Not a bad beer for a hot day. I only grabbed this since I was able to get a single can at my local Kroger. I wouldn't buy a six pack of this, but it's worth trying if you've never had it before."

"The appearance isn't bad - pale cloudy straw color, 2 fingers of lacing which dies pretty quickly; But I am getting about as much taste as a Miller Lite, maybe with a slight watermelon fruit essence and slight melon odor. Highly carbonated. Was worth one try to satisfy my curiosity, but will never get again."

"Can taste the watermelon much more then can smell it. The watermelon flavors go along with, but also do not overpower the wheat. Many fruit/wheat beers seem to have the fruit overpower the beer but this does not. Watermelon flavor tastes very real at first, but finishes a little more sweet, like a hint of watermelon jolly rancher. Still a very interesting beer, and I think they did a good job using watermelon, which I have not seen in a beer before. Mouthfeel is light-medium, and there is a moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp finish."

"O: interesting, I guess fairly good in terms of the flavor but not particularly exciting."

"Perfect summer beer. Cool and refreshing. Smooth light wheat taste with great real watermelon after taste. Doesn't have that generic fake watermelon after taste like a candy. No bitterness. Comparable to most light beers in wheat flavor but with the additional summer fruitiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Exactly what you would expect a watermelon-wheat beer to be. Though I enjoy how the watermelon is integrated into the beer, I wish it was more flavorful. This does make a very good summertime session beer, as it is very refreshing and drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall: just plain awful. this beer does not work out in any way for me. I have had many people try it and no matter their beer of preference or level of intoxification every one has said it is just plain bad."

""
""
""
""

"Overall Impression: A good beer to quench a thirst on a hot day but not much else. Very simplistic and somewhat watery, this beer tastes more like a watermelon flavored lite American lager than a wheat beer from its very very light body."

"The taste has got a watery watermelon taste, a little sweet, with a flower like geranium finish. A touch of perfume in the mouth it is strangely alluring, very easy to drink but certainly won't win any awards."
""
""
""
"Kind of a let down. Picked up a six pack of this for a really hot day in hopes of sipping at a refreshing summer beer. The watermelon flavor doesn’t really mesh with the beer well. It tastes really artificial like watermelon candy. If you want a watermelon beer I would recommend Thomas Hooker if possible."
""
""
"Pours a nearly-transparent, lager-like golden yellow, with a foamy white heat that slowly evaporates. The aroma is a musty combination of hops and wheat that is contrasted by a fruity brightness from the watermelon juice. The flavor similarly features the light, juicy watermelon character that tries to uplift, sweeten, and freshen the underlying flavors, but the dull wheat and musty, grassy hops keep the flavor on the dry side. The fine, light carbonation gives an airiness to the mouthfeel that also works to lighten the flavors. Overall, this beer is different, interesting, but mostly gimmicky rather than inspiring."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a light, slightly hazy golden amber with a one finger white head that dissipates slowly to a thin cap. Aroma of melon (smells a bit more like cantelope, actually) and light wheat. Flavor is sweet wheat, watermelon (distinct in the flavor) with hints of caramel as it finishes slightly dry with light grassy hops. Light bodied, as appropriate. A pleasant surprise, I was not expecting much from this combination, but the light watermelon add a delicate fruit sweetness to the wheat which worked quite well. I would definitely think about this for lawn mowing. This would have been too light for a witbier, but delivers exactly what it advertises as a watermelon wheat."
""
""
""
"Interesting taste but not enough so to buy again. The smell is about average not very intriguing. The taste is beerish with a nice blend of watermelon fruit lasting in the end - almost like a light beer with a watermelon jolly rancher mixed in. 143 Calories per can with 4.9% ABV."
""
""
"There's not much to this beer yet I feel like I enjoyed it more that my scores would suggest. To put it in context I'm grilling and sweating and it's hot as Hades out here. It was quite quenching."
""
""
""
"I understand this beer may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I like it a lot. If you're looking for a good, refreshing summertime lawn mower type beer, this may be right up your alley."
"Pours a pale straw color with a thin film of head. The nose has yeast and fruity notes. This offering is super light (too light). The dominant flavor is light fruit accompanied by a fake sour essence that is not terribly pleasant. The finish is semi-dry with more tangy sourness. There is not much flavor here in general."
""
""
""
""
""
"(Tasted from sampler at the brew pub)."
""
""
""
""

"The mouthfeel is light bodied. The carbonation is pretty active on your tongue, and the beer leaves a very light residue on the back of your tongue and roof of your mouth. That said, it is refreshing. Another beer good for yard work."

"This beer is a perfect summer beer, and I feel that the Beer Advocate rating does not do justice to this sweet wheat. The first sip is a nice wheat beer, and there is a cumulative watermelon that gradually grows in your mouth. I could drink this beer all day sitting outside on a wharf on the beach. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
"O: Ironically, this beer probably would be pretty good without the watermelon. But watermelon it is and this beer delivers a hefty dose of it, though, in the end, I don't think it improves it."

"I don't think I would have ever decided to try watermelon beer if there were no outside influences. But, I had just read an online article about coming down off your manly beer perch and trying fruit beers. In total wine, a reasonably attractive woman saw me looking at the can and commented that it was very good with a winning smile. These forces combined with my uncontrollable urge to try something new or different everytime I'm faced with the Wall Of Beer (and yes, it should be capitialized) lead me to setting down on the couch to watch Disney Channel with my family with a pale yellow, fizzy conncoction smelling like one of the kids dropped a jolly rancher in my beer. After the first drink, I smiled and examinied my glass again. Hazy yellow, thin head with two scents; a good wheat and candy watermelon. I smiled wider and handed the glass to my wife. ""What does that taste like to you?"" I was thinking that no way should a good beer and watermelon work together....but it did! My better half took a tenitive sip, ""Cherry?"" I'm still not sure how she got that. Bigger swallow, ""watermelon!"" I don't think the normal review would give this beer it's due. Long and short of it is, it tastes good! Low enough ABV to qualify as sessionable, light enough to allow drinking a few and with enough flavor that you want to. Now, I will say that it may be too sweet for some people to session, but give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"For what it's worth... It's better on tap."
"The beer pours a clean, pale yellow with a hint of orange. The beer forms a rocky head of slightly creamy white bubbles. The beers body is nearly crystal clear with just a faint hazing, and the beer’s head leaves a lacing of sticky dry bubbles. On the nose, the beer smells tart and citric with a nice sweet underlying melon scent that gives a touch of grassy hops. There is also a slight jammy smell that is a part of the melon smell, but I assume that is just the fruit in the beer. From the can, the sweet fruit is more pronounced with a touch of vegetal scents. On the tongue the beer tastes sweet with a light tartness and some lovely distinctions between the calmer sweet of the malt and the fruitier sweet of the melon. In flavor the beer begins as sweet bread and then slowly moves into distinct bitter watermelon flavors, which is impressive. There is a light citric tartness underlying the flavors, but the water melon builds into a big, sweet crescendo in the finish, leaving the aftertaste clean with a slight hint of lingering malt sweetness. From the can it tastes more metallic and chemically from the can. It definitely tastes better from the glass. In the mouth the beer feels crisp and on the heavier side of light in body with a touch of citric spritz from the medium carbonation levels. The mouth is left clean and a little tingly with some slight bitterness. Overall, this a great crisp summer beer that incorporates the watermelon flavor beautifully. It is not too sweet, just a touch tart, and just a touch bitter and is great to drink. It is a great fruit beer with not too much overpowering fruit. Try this beer."
"That being said, I was very surprised with this 21st Amendment beer. The watermelon is very poignant and almost tastes like Gatorade. I drank five of these without even thinking about it. Great summer beer."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this watery beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. Not cold enough! The beer was a pee colored concoction but did poor a really pretty big white head. i was hopeful. Slight watermelon smell first then kinda sour smell. Worried. Slightly cloudy looking also. The beer was VERY watery tasting. Kinda like watermelon kool aid that half the flavor packet had not made it into the mix. I will not buy this beer again."
"As far as watermelon beers go it's the best one I've had. Simple flavors and easy drinking."

"Overall: In a world full of mediocre fruited summer wheat beers, I feel like this does at least stand out a bit from the crowd (if for no other reason than the use of watermelon). I thought the melon worked well with the wheat beer base. Not excellent by any means, but if I'm looking for something refreshing on a hot day, I'd definitely get this again."

"Pours hazy with a fair amount of visible carbonation, very little head and a nice bit of oily lacing that persists throughout the experience. I can faintly smell watermelon, but I also know it's supposed to be there. I can definitely taste it, along with some bitter rind and some thin standard flavors of a lesser wheat beer. I'm glad I tried it."
"OK, but not my sort of beer. Refreshing but not a winter beer in my eyes, which is when I had it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a strange one alright, and while I appreciate the watermelon rind tartness going on here, the beer lacks all of the hearty, chewy characteristics I love in wheat beers. I paired this with actual watermelon, and it was easier to drink... But then I realized that the watermelon fruit itself was more flavorful and juicy and muted the beer as a result. The extra graininess, alcohol burn, and thinness does not make this as refreshing as other Spring/Summer alternatives. For fans of novelty beers, do try this, but I can't recommend this as much as I'd like to."

"Can: Poured a light yellow color ale with a small pure white foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of watermelon and light wheat malt is weird and not really enticing. Taste is a mix between some watermelons which is more dominant then expected with some light wheat malt. Body is thin with light carbonation. Boring thin wheat with light watermelon flavours."
""
""
""
""
"Emptied into a Sam Adams glass, a light, foamy head developed which dissipated in short order. Appearance was a straw, yellow with a hazy hue. Aroma was light with fruity, sweet hints and slightly sour on the back. Taste was fruity and did remind me of the white part of the watermelon. Taste was also light with a hint of sour. Aftertaste was very light and a bit sour and fruity. Mouthfeel was watery."

"This beer is weird. I was very excited to try it, and I thought it would actually be a little more fruity than it is. Watermelon is definitely present, but not quite in the capacity I would have liked, and not presented in the manner I would have hoped for. Still reasonably drinkable, and definitely something that I was glad to try, but I don't think I'll be getting this one again."

"O: An odd concoction that would be refreshing on a hot day. However fans of fruit beers probably wouldn't find watermelon a flavor to love, unless it was more candy like and pronounced. I'd look elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Something also on trade...this one a fruit, which I normally don't get a chance to try much. Pours a cloudy pilsey yellow with almost no head, and little lacing. Smells sweet, and green, and floral. Taste is interesting, different from many other fruit beers, surely some watermelon, but only hints. An interesting approach to a fruit beer and one that I was happy to try. Easy drinking, and not bitter and light. Carbonation is only low-moderate. Fun to try!"
""
"The color when poured into a glass was a hazy light yellow with hardly any foam and not lace at all on the side of the glass. The smell of yeasty citrus was evident in the aroma. The taste had of a bitter yeasty watermelon, that was not a pleasant feel on the palate. This is not what I would expected from the beer company. Not one of their better brew's."

"This beer pours a slightly hazy yellow with a pillowy white head and no lacing. The aroma is of watermelon with cake and mild sweet malt. The flavor is watermelon throughout with lemon, cake, and wheat malt notes. There is a good balance between the watermelon and the rest in both the aroma and on the palate. It's mouthfeel is light. 21st Amendment Hell Or High Watermelon Wheat Beer is a good beer, a good example of the style, and refreshing. Recommended."

"Drink- I thought it was tasty and for a fruity beer with a wheat background, I would anticipate during the summer this would taste a whole lot better."
""
""
""
"Overall: Had one of these leftover from summer, and it’s a nice hot day today so figured I’d kill the six-pack. This is probably the only one I poured into a glass to review properly, the rest I drank straight from the can. And I think that’s how these should be enjoyed -- floating down a river or by the beach in a tube with just the can. It’s not a bad summer brew but I think the artificial flavor would turn some people off. My woman didn’t like it and she’s a fan of fruit beers. One of these is great, after two or three I’d probably get tired of the sweet and sourness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the body of the beer is light and the finish is medium. Although, you can't taste the watermelon in the beer, it is a pretty apparent going down. This is a good fruit and herb beer. This beer would be great on a nice sunny summer afternoon."
""

"This brew poured with a one finger white head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing on the glass. The body was a clear, golden-yellow color with mild visible carbonation. The nose was very muted. I only got a hint of watermelon. I remember this having more of a nose the last time that I had it. On the taste, the first thing that hit me was how much more carbonation there was on the taste than what I could see in the glass. The next thing that hit me was that this tasted exactly like a liquid watermelon jolly rancher to me. This was completely saturated with lots of artificial watermelon, which wasn’t all that pleasant. After that, I really didn’t get anything else. Any other flavors were completely hidden by the watermelon. The finish was quick, again with watermelon. I remember enjoying this beer much more…I guess my tastes have changed. I would not rush back to have this."

"Mouthfeel: This is a very light bodied and easy drinking summer brew that may not stand out in a crowd but is a good beer for a day at the lake."
"Watermelon beer? What will they think of next? Very little head that lasted a very short time. I, personally, could not detect any discernible smell. However, the taste was exactly as advertised by the name. Resheshing, crisp watermelon dominates. I like its uniqueness. Hey, does drinking this count as a serving of fruit?!?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, grain, yeast, spices, and some slightly fruit (but not watermelon) aromas. Taste is much the same with a very mild watermelon flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is refreshing but the watermelon presence is mild and hard to pick out in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I expected a lackluster,light bodied, overly fruity, overly sweet beer and what I got Was a decent summer beer. Would buy again for the pool or the beach."
""
"O - Since I think they are trying to replicate the experience of biting into a piece of watermelon, as that's exactly what this tastes like, it's not bad. But as an actual wheat beer, it's not very good. I don't mind fruit in beer, but this is more beer trying to taste like fruit, than it is fruit trying to accentuate the flavors of a beer. I'll give it points for being refreshing, and having a rather nice watermelon flavor, but it's not something I would reach for if I wanted a beer."
""
""
"Cloudy pale gold fluid with a white head that fades quickly leaving no real lace. Smell is wheaty with good amounts of twang and yeast fruitiness. A dry crisp cereal graininess. Flavor is just short of the next score for me. Full bodied wheat core with a perfect amount of watermelon. Juicy body and a dry tart finish that makes it a superb quencher. Finish has a bit of rind and artful hop balance that is mild yet firm. This beer is actually a delicately complex brew. Crisp feel is gently carbonated lending to a great drinkability and refreshing character. One of my new summer favorites and a good choice for the adventurous and open palate."

"Tasted good with normal wheat beer taste up front followed by the watermelon flavor. Leaves not so good aftertaste in your mouth. Below average fruit beer. Seems too artificial."
""
""
""

"This is so much better than last year's can that I had. The cooked vegetable isn't even a memory. I would like this to have a little more interesting hop profile - just a bit of nobles, maybe. But for what it is I'm very impressed."

"O - not horrible but not special by any means. Almost interesting enough to seek out but I don't think I'll be having another. At best a novelty but not enough character to be good one."

"Final Thoughts: This was an average beer. I could see myself having it again at a backyard BBQ or summer get together. As far as summer seasonal's go, it's better than most. It's just complex enough to make it interesting, but not near enough to make it exceptional."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing. Decent summer beer, but that's about it."
"O - I love how they incorporated the watermelon into the beer and it fits perfectly. It is a nice summer, wheat beer. However, I do wish it had a bit more carbonation and body to it which make this one of the better wheat beers out there. Happy to see the experimentation with the new fruit flavors and I think it pays off."

"Average fruit wheat. Not boring, just faulty execution. 3.0"

"A little less than a finger’s worth of gossamer white bubbles, not quite foam, dissipates to basically nothing across the surface, no lacing either. Hazy deep yellow colored liquid, holds light inside well, few bubbles, loosely aggregated, nothing leaps out at you visually. The nose is soft and gentle, wheat cereal, biscuit and, duh, sweet watermelon scents, you get lemon juice as well, ends with an earthy and herbal muskiness which is actually welcome for how it broadens the texture and creates contrast against the fruit. Medium-bodied with fluffy carbonation, has some residual prickle through the finish. The watermelon flavoring is not excessively strong, kind of floats through the mouth. There’s a metallic undercurrent more than wheat or bread, although there’s an adequate amount of the latter. Sour lemon to orange citrus brings added refreshing qualities. At times you might find a spoonful of molasses. Nothing here really distinguishes it but it’s unflawed, not entirely without appeal."
""
"Well done 21st Amendment. And Thank You!"
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm still searching for a quality fruit beer. Not sure if I'll ever find a real good one. But for some reason, I keep trying. Somebody please stop me."
""
""
""
"O: Certainly the best watermelon beer that I have tried as it is not overly sweet and does not taste like a Jolly Rancher. The beer is easy to drink and refreshing but I'm not sure it would be a sessionable beer for me (just not a flavor profile that I loved). Would be good on a real hop summer day."
""
"Hell or High Watermelon poursa somewhat hazy golden yellow. Three or so fingers of white foam cap the beer, but it all fades quickly and quietly. The nose has a bit of a Jolly Rancher watermelon type aroma to it, but there's also another smell that I can't quite place, but it definitely doesn't belong. This is quite simply the worst beer I've ever tasted. The flavor is what I'd imagine it would taste like if you let the leftover milk from a bowl of cereal sit out for a day and then tried to drink it. The body has a weird creaminess to it, only highlighting the awful taste. The carbonation is on the low side. If I ever did a video review of Hell or High Watermelon, it would probably end up a bit like the ""I award you zero points, may God have mercy on your soul"" speech from Billy Madison."

"O- I'm really disappointed. I'm going to chalk this one up to not travelling well and hopefully try it again someday. It cost me less than two bucks, so I'm not disappointed with the price fallout."
"For what it is, its refreshing fruity and unlike anything I've ever had before. It takes a little while to understand it and enjoy it, but its one of the most innovative beers I've had."

"Overall: Between this and Abita’s Strawberry Harvest, I’m finding more fruit beers that I like. These are not pumped with artificial flavors that overpower the beer. The watermelon in this beer is so subtle that it could easily be overlooked if your not thinking about the flavors. Once you start to really dig into the beer the watermelon comes out of hiding and compliments the wheat very nicely."

""
"This is a very popular beer with new to craft drinkers. My brother swears by it and he is a BMC guy, so I guess there is some appeal to the non beer geek to seek this out with the watermelon addition. I need to try this from a can, but my draft score will remain."
""
"Overall, very nice effort from 21st Amendment. As always, I love their cans for convienence sake. An easy drinking beer when you want something just a little different. If you are looking for huge depth and complexity, this beer is not for you. If judged for what it is, it deserves a try."
""
"This is a light, easy drinking beer. It's not very sweet and the watermelon doesn't really shine through. It's drinkability though makes it a refreshing summer beer."

"Very rare is the occasion where I cannot finish a beer, but I had to move on after about half. I'm surprised I made it that far, my friend and I trading various upsetting facial expressions, choking it down trying to figure out exactly what was going on with this beer. Vomit. It reminded me of vomit. Vile, repulsive stuff..."
""
""
""
"Got this on a recommendation of a friend and decided to pick some up try it and drop a review on it... Pours a hazy, golden color head is thin, white, bubbly and gone very quickly... Smell is of a standard beer variety with a slight sweetness. Would not pick out watermelon here if it wasn't on the can... Taste is not very pleasant slightly sour but not much there really... Again in searching for the watermelon flavor I liken it to a watermelon that just never got sweet... Guess that can be expected from a fruit that can either be really great or really uneventful... Was kinda surprised because previous reviews had mentioned an artificial flavor of watermelon and I just don't taste it... Might actually make it more enjoyable. Canned in 4/12 for not very old either only like 3 weeks. Can't say I'll be going back for this one."
""
"Overall: Not for everyone, but it is as advertised. If the watermelon flavor appeals to you, it might be worth having a can on a hot day."
"overall it is a very nice summer beer.. refreshing, crisp, sweet.. perfect for session drinking, mowing the lawn, lounging around getting sunburn on the lawn."
"I thought about just dumping it but it was all I had so after thinking long and hard, I remembered that if you hold your nose you can’t really taste what is in your mouth. It worked, I got it down fast. This is nasty shit!! I wish I could rate it even lower."
""
""
"I'm glad I tried it. It delivers as promised but this won't be repeat for me. I'll finish the six pack as this meets my summer profile of preferring lighter brews."
"At first i opened the can poured it in to a glass and right off the bat ya can smell melon rind. I thought o no this is going to be bad but as it turned out this is my new best summer beer."
"Now the taste is odd, very odd. Corn and watermelon. I never thought id like it, but I really do. If it didnt smell like hell, Itd be perfect. Theres a nice balance of fruitiness from the watermelon but a definite beer base. Interesting to say the least."

""
""

"Overall - ... And yet, this beer is somehow better than the sum of it's parts. I'll never buy it again, but I'd probably drink it if offered. This is now my 2nd 21st Amendment beer, and both have been big disappointments. Dare I try a third?"

""
"The watermelon flavor is more authentic that I expected but the beer overall just doesn't do it for me. The flavors don't blend all that well and I am left with a clash between yeast and fruit."
""
""
""
""
"Medium-light bodied, with lively carbonation, fairly crisp and refreshing. Overall, however, I don’t think I’d buy this one again; the easy drinking quenching appeal of this beer is overshadowed by an unbalanced and lackluster flavor."
"Overall - Yeah, it's a novelty wheat beer and I'm not exactly a huge fan of wheat beers but it's a nice crisy beer. The initial smell makes it seem rather bland while the flavor proves that there it does have something worthwhile to offer."
""
""
"Not quite as complex as I had hoped, but refreshing and perfect hot-day-in the sun brew."
"Not a fan of this beer. A weird aroma and flavor for sure. Finding it hard to finish."

"A good easy drinking beer for the summer months. A little too expensive, tho."
"Overall: I've often seen this sitting on the shelves and being kind of put off by the concept of a watermelon beer, but I'm glad I tried it. It's a pretty tasty light wheat beer that would go great with the summer."
""
"The mouthfeel is thin with moderate carbonation. Overall, I just didn't care for it. The watermelon was too dominating and just not that great. It seemed to have more of a bitter rind, vegetable like quality to it that I didn't care for. A little metallic as well. Not something I'd want to try again."
""
"Overall: I came to enjoy this beer. Don't plan to cuddle with it as it will go flat quick. This would be a nice beer to have on a summer day. A little pat on the back. Worth a try if you like lighter beer."
""
"Poured from a can into a weisse vase, the beer is a cloudy, opaque, pale yellow-gold coloring with no head whatsoever. Aromas of tangy sweet watermelon and toasted grains. Flavors are light and sweet, with a strong watermelon character on the forward tongue that gives you a sugary tart profile atop the toasted grain backbone. The aftertaste is light and quick, with a strong watermelon character and tangy feel. Crisp, light finish. This beer is very easy to drink, and great on a hot day. Also goes well with a wedge of watermelon, as we originally had it at 21st Amendment in SanFran."

"I was in Ohio and we picked up a 6 pack of cans from local store. The beer poured a hazy golden yellow..almost like a farmhouse cider, tiny white bubbly head, with no lacing. There was definitely some melon in the aroma and also in the taste. Malt and wheat balanced the beer in both smeel and taste. The mouthfeel was light in body and good carbonation. Overall a decent beer, probably better served in the summer."

"I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. Typically with fruit beers you'll get something overly sweet to the point that it just tastes fake. Especially with Watermelon beers, they often just taste like drinking a Jolly Rancher. Surprisingly, that was the not the case here, and while there was a ton of watermelon flavor, it really wasn't that overly sweet syrup flavor. Pretty good I'd say, not something I'd get all the time, but I did enjoy it."

"Would I buy more of it? - I wouldn't totally dismiss this beer as it is exactly what it is supposed to be. However, its not a beer that I'd find myself drinking a lot of the time. It does sort of scream to be bought the night before a day of yard work."
"Overall: Watermelon is a difficult beer to get right, and these guys certainly made a good example of it. Yeah the taste isn't going to taste like biting into a real watermelon. Watermelon itself has very little flavor other that sugar. Watermelon flavoring is still delicious though, and being a big fan of it, I found this beer to be great."
"Light in body...I actually thought the carbonation was pretty decent. I might have preferred a little less carbonation only because I felt that it added to the soda-like nature of this beer. Enjoyable in some situations, but definitely not a staple in my fridge."
"Notes - Light mouthfeel which I think could have used more carbonation"
"I will admit to approaching this beer with some trepidation. Watermelon flavored beer? The thougth invoked a shudder, but, I forged on nonetheless. I was pleasantly surpised at how deftly the watermelon aspect was handled. Rather than the Jolly Rancher monstrosity I expected, the watermelon note was quite subtile, just barely there in the background of an otherwise quite clean and light wheat. Some citrus balanced well with the melon, and there was a hint of fruity perfume in the aftertaste. Not something could see myself ordering on any sort of regular basis, but an interesting endeavor by the brewery."
"O: This was a little too soda like. Wouldn't buy this again. I can respect 21st for trying this though."
"O- Interesting idea but I didn't particularly care for its executing. Probably wouldn't seek out or try again."
"O: This beer delivers what it says it would. Perfect for a hot day as it is quite refreshing. Not a brew I would certainly seek out but it was enjoyable."
"Some watermelon flavor, though accompanied by a bland watery character, more like the white rind than the sweet red fruit. Light astringency, the mouthfeel is basically nonexistent. Probably not something i'd revisit personally. Cool new can design though."
"M - Light and drinkable, with no real punch. Just an easy summer beer."
"Not only is this a terrible wheat beer, it is a bad beer with artificial tasting watermelon flavor in it. I never pour out a beer if I can choke it down. This one got dumped after one painful gulp! Usually I can find something positive in most beers but I am drawing a blank with this one."
"If it weren't for the watermelon, this beer would be as exciting as bathwater."
"Served from can into a Unibroue La Fin du Monde tulip. Poured golden yellow with a minimal white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, fruit, and watermelon. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was nothing too exciting. If I'm completely honest, I mainly got this one for the name. The watermelon was definitely present, but really didn't blend well with the other flavors going on here. On the aroma I was unable to isolate the watermelon, but it definitely came through on the flavor. Worth trying to say that you did, but that is about it in my personal opinion."
"O: The beer definitely goes down very easy but has an unremarkable taste. It would be a good choice for a hot summer day when you are just looking for a cold beer but not much else."
"Mouthfeel is light and incredibly refreshing. I think the drinkability is very high. This is a very, light easy drinking beer. Would be great poolside or with the lawnmower. I like it."
"O: Perfect summer beer for the pool or beach. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Glad I bought a sixer to enjoy Labor Day at the beach with college football. It's great to be an American!"
"Overall, an interesting brew, something off in the scent and a little two pungent of watermelon flavor upfront."
"O - Watermelon Wheat is a nice summer beer and it deviates from the normal fruit beers with the addition of watermelon...and besides you can't be it being in a can"
"I think that this would be a great brew to grill out with, very refreshing and a cool concept I haven't seen in many other beers."
"I, for one, ambitiously declare this one of my 5 beers of the summer. And as the last shipment has arrived at the store, I realize that I have survived my first summer in NY, and the leaves are about to change."
"D: A summer refresher for sure. A light fruit flavor on a light and muted wheat beer. A really well done fruit beer overall. And, is there another watermelon wheat out there? Sure, it is a bit one-sided and even gimmicky, but every time I try one of these I am struck by how distinctly it does taste of watermelon."
"O-its not awful, but im not sure it works all that well. The sweet watermelon flavor gets lost with the wheaty taste and it seems more tart than it should be. Not bad but i wouldnt purchase more of it."
"The pour is a translucent hay color with about a half inch of bubbly, white head. The head dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. The smell is perhaps the most off-putting part for me; for some reason, I can't detect anything past a terrible, strong, curdled milk scent. I can't even find the damn watermelon in the nose. I brace for the taste… ah, found the watermelon! There is a dominating, yet artificial watermelon flavor reminiscent of a jolly rancher or some other sugary candy. An odd milk like flavor sits between the melon and a faint wheat base. The mouthfeel is light, and a bit lively from the carbonation. Nothing spectacular, as it is a bit thin. I will be avoiding this in the future."
"On tap at the brewpub. Hazy yellow color with a small white head and a watermelon slice on the glass. Aroma is lots of watermelon. Flavor is wheaty with - you guessed it - watermelon. Pretty sour and almost cidery on the finish. Light on the palate, refreshing but a little off-balance in my opinion."
"A decent fruit beer but nothing worth writing home about. Worth trying once and I hear it's better on tap than in the can."
"While not a bad beer overall, the focus on the watermelon as guest starring ingredient has predictably feeble results - an echo of an already delicate flavour doesn't add up to strong, memorable flavours. That said, agreeable enough for days like this (+30 degrees), where ease of drinkability and cute advertising rule."
"O-MIght make a good beer to have occasionally on a hot day, but I can't get them around here so it will be very occasionally for me."
"O--This is the perfect beer and my go-to for a brew to take with me to South Beach on the weekends. Overall, though, there are better wheat beers out there. I would recommend it for what it is. Something I will pick up again."
"Aromas are good, some watermelon and other citrus with a little yeasty note. Mild and smooth on the palate. Not overly complex, but enjoyable. Much more natural and balanced than most (commercialized) fruit beers."
"D - Very drinkable. The watermelon flavor is very nice, but it just needed a bit more flavor and body. Felt refreshing, but just a bit empty."
"Very refreshing and easy drinking, although the watermelon borders on Jolly Rancher-esque artificial sweetness after a while."
"O - OK paradoxically, I enjoyed this beer, but not because it resembled anything I would call ""craft beer."" I would consider this nice and interesting lawnmower beer. Sort of like the pleasure one would get drinking a Pabst or Natty Boh but with watermelon--which ain't a bad thing!"
"D: overall it did drink real easy, not overly sweet and could really enjoy some of these on a hot summer day poolside. It was a decent fruit style beer."
"12oz can $1.99 Hazy yellow color, looks murky with a pillowtop head. Smells faintly of watermelon and wheat. The flavor was heavy watermelon juice, so much so that it almost felt artificially flavored but I liked it anyway. For me this would be a good hot weather beer but not a session beer since I wouldn't want more than one."
"O: I didn't enjoy this beer. I don't see myself getting this again anytime soon nor recommending this to other. I usually enjoy their beers, but this one is a miss."
"Kind of an average beer."
"O- Nice an crisp beer that is perfect for the summer time and this terrible heat wave we are in. Easily could enjoy one of these after cutting the grass or while cooking out or any other summertime activities."
"As an afterthought, it's ""cool"" flavor paired really well with spicy Mexican food I ate after my initial tastes."
"The beer pours a hazy light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is mainly wheat but I also get a nice bit of light watermelon. The flavor is wheat, juicy watermelon and a light bit of tartness. Light to medium mouthfeel and medium mouthfeel. A nicely done fruit beer that doesn't taste artificial or overpower you with sweetness."
"O: Interesting. I bought a single can of this and it will be the last can I buy. Not bad for what it is, but like I said, I'm not a fan of fruit beers in general and I don't really see the gain in putting watermelon in beer."
"Hell or High Watermelon holds a light body, dry mouthfeel, and moderate semi-spicy carbonation. The clean, crisp authentic watermelon flavor is immediately present at the forefront, and fades into a lighter, sweet melon tang while touches of grainy wheat and malt follow through to the end. The profile of this beer overall is very light, but that doesn’t keep it from being the perfect thirst quencher, especially when it’s 115º outside. As much as I disagree with the current stereotypes of women and (fruit) beer, I think that this could be an awesome first step into the craft beer world for both men and women who are still trying to become interested and want to ease themselves in."
"To those who have bought a 6 pack and don't enjoy it, save one for a BBQ, and give it another shot. For low bitterness/refreshing summer beers, this is one of my favorites."
"Overall, this accomplishes what it sets out to do. A refreshing summer beer that proves itself as an ideal pool lounging candidate that your girlfriend probably won't argue with. Worth a shot if you like wheat beers."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very very pale golden with a few thin strands of bubbles rising from the bottom. A reasonable head formed upon pour, but quickly left just a thin layer that clung just a bit to the sides. Aroma was a bit off putting, smelled slightly sour with a hint of pickles and grain. Taste was of watered down watermelon bubble gum or diluted sorbet. Not a natural flavor, but one that was easily identifiable. Felt thin and watery in the mouth. Didn't coat at all and had just a tad of carbonation while drinking. Overall was a blah beer. Might be fun to bust out as a gimmick while friends are over at a BBQ mid summer, but nothing I would want to drink on a regular basis."
"O: Not a very good beer. It’s a weird flavor that I didn’t expect and really doesn’t deliver the promised watermelon taste. I find it extremely strange that this beer is one of the best sellers at Winking Lizard. I won’t be buying this beer and will stick to other offerings from 21st Amendment."
"D-the former ""drinkablility"" category. I actually would buy this again..it is not great, but it is refreshing and unusual. I dig offbeat stuff, and this certainly is that. Low in abv to pound down in the summer heat...I like a summer refresher that lets me drink more of it."
"Overall, this isn't a beer I'd go back to. I prefer a lighter wheat beer for a summer seasonal, and I'm not a fan of watermelon the fruit, so watermelon the beer probably isn't for me either. Still, its an interesting and commendable experiment."
"overall this one is OK. inoffensive and some good qualities to it, but nothing to write home about - or go out of one's way to acquire. i might buy it to diversify my beer menu at a cookout, but that's about it."
"m: nothing special, high carbonation, watery."
"6 pack of cans from Roth’s Sunnyside Market, S.Salem.$7.99 says 4.9% alc on the can. Appearance? Murkey golden yellow..almost like a farmhouse cider, tiny white bubbly head. Really picking up next to nothing as far as aroma..some hay and dough maybe. Picking up the water melon in the taste right away and its not candy type but real watermelon..after that its just wheatiness..VERY simple. Thin mouthfeel but you cant hold that against it per style. Overall very dissapointed..very very boring even in the heat."
"This beer is a unique take on a wheat-centric beer by adding watermelon, something of which I've never seen done before. And it works quite well. Nothing seems overpowering but the aromas could use some work, as could the flavor profile in the taste. I'd like to see the watermelon stay relevant throughout, but a nice base for a flavored wheat beer."
"O: will not be drinking again. I like 21st Amendment but this is just not very good."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. I could see how this could be a polarizing beer..."
"O- Great fruit beer for a hot day. I'm not one to love fruit beers but this was decent per style. I would buy this again for it's purpose, not to mention the girlfriend liked as well... I'm a bit sick of all fruit beers getting horrible scores just because it isnt the most favored style"
"First, this is a perfect combination of a fruit and beer - the soft watermelon hints pair perfectly with the wheat style. It is amazingly refreshing during a hot day (or while peddling to a brewery). Great level of carbonation too! I would highly recommend this beer to any one..."
"Watermelon! How refreshing! Poured into a glass a large head erupts and loiters for a bit but leaves without a trace. A nice hazy golden wheat body, the beer has got some yeasty and bitter rind aromas going on whereas the taste is sweet with a nice watermelon flavor. It's not hard to pick out, this is apparently a watermelon beer, and a good one at that. It's got a smooth mouthfeel and very easy drinking at 4.9%. I feel like I've been calling a lot of beers refreshing and I'm gonna call this one as well. Good beer. Yay summer."
"Fruit beers can be really hit and miss, but this one works for me. The watermelon is subtle but tasty, nice grainy wheat and sweet malt, and crisp. My local bottle shop (Brew in south Philly) has six-packs of this for $12, and I'll definitely be picking up at least a few more this summer."
"My first thought was this is probably going to be sweet and nasty but I give credit to 21st in that they made the watermelon work well with the style. The nose is watermelon but the taste is wheat with only a hint of the fruit. Actually finishes nicely with a smooth grainy taste with that watermelon on the tip of the tongue. Could have been a disaster but it actually works."
"Overall this beer is right. I wouldn't reach for two in a row but I did enjoy it and think I will have another one in the future...."
"D - Once you get past the aroma, there's a decent beer waiting. Still, not something I'd want to bother with again. Markedly inferior to the watermelon lambic hombrew someone brought to RBWG 2010."
"it was also like a watery pale ale with a hint of sweetness behind it, but the sweetness was watermelon. the carbonation was more under control, but the watermelon was a bit too cloyingly sweet unlike similarly disfavored beers like deschutes twilight ale. it's not as drinkable as similar beers just due to the cloying sweetness."
"Still remember the first time I had this at the annual OBF (where for God knows what reason, it remains a perennial favorite), and how much I was looking forward to trying it (given it's popularity and all the hype surrounding it). I was absolutely stunned by what I tasted (or should I say, by what I didn't taste), and ended up dumping my glass after the second or third sip. I've tried it on several more occcasions since then, on the off chance that maybe there was something wrong with my palate or I'd just gotten an unusually bland batch. No such luck. This beer is consistently bland, boring and basically tasteless. The ultimate gimmick beer (at least in my book)."
"O: This has slowly become my favorite ""tubing down the river"" beer by beating out Butternuts Hefe. The can makes it portable while the lower ABV makes it great for having a bunch while floating and staying coordinated enough to scale the muddy hill back to the car. I wouldnt get this for much of any thing else except maybe a hot day on a boat or maybe a company picnic."
"O: If I was looking for something to have multiple glasses/cans of while spending some time outdoors in the warm weather, this would absolutely be my choice (if I could only get more of it in TN). I definitely recommend it as a summer-time brew."
"Overall it's a beer that's not noteworthy other than the cool can."
"O - Not a good beer, not a bad beer. Not a good beer. Easy to get down, but pretty much of non-consequence."
"Food Pairings: Veggies, Salad, Grilled Chicken, Grilled Pork, Light body Cheeses."
"O: Not my thing. Not enough ""punch."" It's bland and clean, so it may appeal to people who like lighter tasting beers."
"Hazy light golden in body with fading white head. Smells of weak watermelon, wheat and light floral notes. Tastes of light floral, wheat, watermelon in the background, some light grains and a dry ending. Having the watermelon as an undertone makes for a refreshing session. Medium carbonation with light body. Cloying mouthfeel. Perfect for MDW down the shore."
"Body is semi crisp with a lightish medium body, a bit flat on carbonation for a wheat based fruit beer. Which in actuality, seems right on course with many of the other fruit based wheat beer that get cranked out by some of the big macro breweries and micros as well. Nothing I'd seek out really other then trying the hollow watermelon trick at a big Summer picnic or party."
"I like fruit beers but not this one."
"Hell or High Watermelon Wheat may be the perfect summer beer. Light and refreshing, with a subtle fruit flavor that reminds of Fourth of July picnics."
"O: I have enjoyed all 21st Amendment offerings until this. Swing and a miss."
" Hell or High Watermelon is a unique beer in many ways. Not excellent, but not horrible. It's drinkable, and I can see how it could be thirst-quenching on a hot Summer day. I can see what the brewers were trying to achieve, and while it is decent, I think there is room for improvement."
"Overall, this is a refreshing summer beer, but not crazy. Not very much to say about this one."
"D: Overall a decent beer. Probably not one I'd drink again but not the killshot I had suspected it might be (3)"
"I expected much better and really didnt care for the mouthfeel. Not really something I would get again."
"O-Overall this a decent brew. I can totally see myself drinking this during the summer months with a hot dog in one hand and this beer in the other watching the Red Sox."
"Notes: Hmmm, the poorest from what I have had from 21st Amendment. Entry level casual quaff under the scorching sun? Not a terrible offering but having a choice I would stay away from this one. They can do much better than this."
"Pours a very nice looking, white, one and a half finger head, I can slightly hear it fizzing though which isn't a great sign. It's mostly all small bubbles and it has kind of a pillowy look to it. It's not hanging around too long, but better than some beers I supposed. It has decent lacing. The body is a cloudy orange-yellow color, I'd like it to be a little cloudier to be honest, but it's pretty legit, I can't see through it at all. Overall it's a decent look, the lacing could be better and the head could have lasted longer, but for a wheat beer it's not bad. I get two main things on the smell, the first is watermelon, and the second is cheap beer. It's not an overpowering watermelon smell and that is good, a lot of these wheat beers overdo it with the fruit, and this clearly doesn't. The cheap beer smell worries me because it's a pretty clear smell, not much question about what I'm smelling. It smells refreshing, and I doubt I'll dislike it, but that cheap beer smell may cause some problems on the taste. The taste is good, it's mostly just watermelon though, not much else to it. The good news is that it doesn't taste like cheap beer, just a one sided beer. You do get a little bit of a can taste to it, which really pisses me off because all these micro breweries promise that even though they put their beers in cans - it wont taste metallicy, well this does, just slightly, but it does. Maybe the metallic taste was the cheap beer smell I was picking up on. The watermelon taste is good, they for sure didn't overdo it with the watermelon taste and that's good, frankly I'd like a little more, but in these fruit beers it's better to have less than more, because some breweries go nuts with fruit. The wheat aspect is a little different, I mean it looks like a wheat beer, but it real doesn't feel like a wheat beer that much, there is a tiny wheat feel, but for the most part it's too thin. So considering that, the mouthfeel isn't all that great, the carbonation is right, but they skimped out on the wheat, in a wheat beer, so...yeah. The drinkability is good, it goes down very well. Overall on this beer, it's a good beer, it's has some areas that could for sure be improved on, like the head/lacing, and the wheat, but overall it's not bad, it's very tasty and refreshing."
"Can. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a slightly cloudy light golden color with a 1 finger white head. Surprisingly, the nose has decently strong notes of watermelon with some mild wheat notes as well. No alcohol or hops notes to mention. Medium mouthfeel. Starts slightly sweet with a building watermelon flavor and other melon. Refreshing to drink. Minimal lace. Ever so slight bitterness lingers but miniscule."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Definitely interesting, and I'm glad I tried it. I think I'd like it on a hot day."
"O- excellent sessional summer beer. Hangin at the lake. In the heat. Whatever. Taste great. I need more."
"Will I finish the six pack, yes. Will I buy again, probably not."
"Overall I would advise against this beer. I would love to try some of this brewery's other offerings as I have heard some good things. Hopefully this wont affect my perception of their other brews."
"Pours a hazy, really pale, yellow with a one-finger white head. Goes quickly with no lacing. Not a great smell. Smells tart and a little sour, hints of wheat and yeast as well. Flavor begins with some light wheat flavor before a pleasant watermelon and honeydew sweetness rounds out this simple flavor profile. Really refreshing melon flavor, nailed it without making it taste like watermelon juice. Solid fruit beer minus the off-putting aroma."
"O: I like 21st Amendment and most of their offerings, just not into this one. I bought a 6-pack and THANK GOD the wife likes it....she'll be drinking the rest of it alone!"
"I definitely could have pounded my way through this can, but i decided to let the sink handle that instead. Not the worst beer ever, but far and away from the best. In the end, the smell was the deciding factor for me."
"Poured clear golden into a tumbler. Big white foamy head that dissipated after a few minutes to just a thin layer. Aroma (first impression) was stale and unimpressive, and I started having doubts that I picked up a bad beer. Then I took a sip. Watermelon!!! Very distinct, very fruity, but not overbearing or sickeningly sweet, and truly watermelon. Very light and smooth, no acidic harshness that often pervades wheat beers. Light body, easily drinkable. Great summertime beer. I want more."
"Hand carried back from Maryland"
"D-As I said above...I am glad I tried it...b/c I had wanted to for a while...I didn't finish the can I had...left about 1/4 in the glass. I generally am a fan of 21st amendment...but this one just didn't work...though I respect the effort in trying to brew a different beer."
"O: It's interesting. Doesn't taste too great"
"I have tasted a number of excellent 21st Amendment beers. This one just didn't do it for me."
"I couldn't even feel the alcohol in this and as I already stated, this felt like a soda or a mixer that I'd pour into some spirit. Thankfully, I couldn't taste any of the can in the beer like I thought and I'm sure that that's a prejudice that I personally need to overcome. That being said, this beer comes up short and if I wanted something on a hot summer day, I'd choose something with a bit more haze and body in it. This isn't a novelty but it's not that far away from that status either."
"Can. Pours a hazy dark gold with a thick white head. Very toasty, biscuity aroma with a fresh whiff of melon. The palate carries more biscuity malt, with some wheat notes and distinct but subtle watermelon in the finish. Not especially yeasty or wheaty to me, more biscuity and even a toasty mouthfeel, but subtle on the fruit which keeps things intriguing. Finish is crisp and dry. Very different, in a good way. But not enough for me to buy again."
"Overall I'm unimpressed and Thomas Hooker's would definitey be my choice given the option."
"O - Nice, light, sweet and refreshing."
"This is the first Watermelon beer I've ever had. The color was hazy and yellow the aroma was sweet and had the natural aroma of the watermelon. The flavor was a little of te light side. It wasn't that bad but I think that if a watermelon wedge was added to this while drinking that it would amp this brew up and make it a lot better."
"O - While I'm not that into fruit beers this one is pretty good as the fruit flavoring isn't overpowering making it very easy to drink this is going to be a good beer as the weather warms up worth trying sometime if you see it"
"Pours out a nice gold color, small amount of head. Smells like a wheat beer, bit of citrus some watermelon rind? Tastes very light, I can probably drink this all day... watermelon flavor, a bit like watermelon jollyranchers, nice amount of carbonation... definitely refreshing."
"."
"Hopefully my future posts will be for better buys."
"Pale gold with almost no head, no lace, dead looking. Watermelon, fruit, and some faint wheat on the nose. Taste is mostly watermelon with a distinct wheat base. Fruity aftertaste. Very light, watery mouth. Overall this was a clunker. Glad I only have a 6 pack from a variety case. Those will tough to get rid of."
"D- Couldn't handle a few sips, no way will I buy this again."
"D - On a hot day this may not be too bad. Not really my thing, but I can see what they were going for."
"Not a very flavorful beer at all but it sure is highly drinkable and refreshing. It is definitely worth trying but that's about it."
"Overall, this was a fun one to try, a fun one to tick, but not one I ever want again."
"D - Very refreshing. A watermelony flavoured lighter beer great for summertime. Looks like your typical ""light"" beer, not much on the nose. Still its enjoyable."
"D - If this is your thing then pretty high. It's light enough in body and abv to drink a few. Probably a good lawnmower beer. Not really my thing but I might just chalk it up to being out of season as well as a slightly dated can."
"D: If I were in the Caribbean and no beer was around except for this and Bud, I'd choose this. Otherwise, I'd definitely skip it."
"Drinkability: A sad attempt at a wheat beer. A poorly brewed wheat beer with some watermelon juice added is not a good mix."
"M/D - A little sticky and light carbonation on the tongue. Sweet. I wouldn't really want more than one of these despite the low ABV."
"Pours a light honey gold color with almost a greenish hue. No visibility through the wheaty cloud. A white head soon turns into a ring. Smell is remarkably crisp, I get many light green fruit tones, like pear and apple, and some light grains. Taste is very bright and crisp. The watermelon really serves as a nice backing, without too much sweetness and just a little tartness. Finishes dry, with a little hops bitterness and lingering watermelon sweetness. Pretty good, and my favorite fruit-added beer I've sampled. I could drink a bunch of these on a hot day.."
"This beer tasted watered down and that may have been the best part of it. I don't mean to be cruel but so far on this site it had a B-. Someone must have been grading on a curve"
"Taste- Wow, dissapointed, it taste's like spinach. I don't know if this is an old can or what but I feel like popeye should be drinking this; mouthfeel is average. Drinkability is low because I'm assuming that this is supposed to be a refreshing beer. I don't think I can finish this. Maybe it's an old can but I only bought it about a month ago."
"The flavor brings an initial squirt of Starburst-like watermelon flavor, but it's very artificial and doesn't last long. It quickly gives way to stale wheat and a cooked veggie presence. Mouthfeel is bubbly and thin, but nicely crisp and refreshing per the style. Overall, this is an interesting take on the ""fruity wheat"" style, but the base beer is lack-luster. No point in adding watermelon to a mediocre wheat beer. I'd pass on this next time, but it was worth a try."
"D: Yuck! Will never have this one again. Nothing about this beer works for me. I was turned off by the smell and the taste provided exactly what the smell promised: an undrinkable beer. Avoid this one."
"Someone sent me a can as an extra from the West Coast. Hey its an extra and they hadn't thought that fruit beers are not normally my thing. Pours a light pinkish tinge colour with quick fizzing disapearing head. Mild sweet aroma. The taste is acceptable for a few gulps, light mouthfeel. This isn't real watermelon put in the tank."
"Taste is basically a wheat beer with not much watermelon flavor at all. It's basically your standard wheat beer. Mouthfeel is full rich and creamy - quite good. There is some weird off taste that's not great but overall it's a step above a macro, quite easy drinking."
"I had this beer on-tap at the 21st Amendment brewery in San Francisco. I had it during the summer and it was a good summer beer. It was highly drinkable-very light and crisp. There was a strong aroma of watermelon and it was served which a watermelon wedge on the side of the pint glass."
"Can't miss the watermelon in this beer. Drank it with a chunk of watermelon in it, too. Very drinkable, light, tasty watermelon, but it's hardly a beer, really. Good for hot sweaty summer days, but I prefer some more body. Nonetheless, it tastes great, just very light."
"Drinkable for those who like a light lager-like fruit beer."
"D- It goes down easy enough. It isn't awful, but it isn't complex at all. It really does nothing for me. It will go away quickly simply because it doesn't taste bad. Its more that it doesn't taste bad than it tastes good. Very average and boring."
"Light body, some lingering dryness on the tongue. I guess this would be smooth drinking, but the taste is pretty confusing and unattractive for me."
"This flavor is bigger than the smell but very restrained, which works for the style. The watermelon aspect is better than I would have thought. If anything it tastes a bit 'fake' somehow, like how a lollipop approximates flavor. This being said it isn't bad but it feels unnatural. The more traditional aspects are good and the drinkability is high. This would likely be better if it were fresher. Also the more I drink this the more the watermelon flavor becomes watery, rather the sweetness from the impact isn't strong enough to last."
"D: I'm wondering if this was on the shelf too long or something because I had abad experience with this brew. I would have assumed this to be a lot lower rated on here than it is. I would not find this drinkable in a beer situation at all."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color with ha hint of green. The head is an inch in height, and vanishes within seconds. The aroma is of watermelon. There is also a tart aspect to the aroma that isn't pleasing to me. I am sure this beer smells how it is intended to, but it simply smells bad. The taste is of very mild watermelon, and not much else. Really this taste is of virtually nothing. It isn't bad; it just isn't. The mouthfeel is watery with low carbonation (bad for a wheat beer). Overall, this is a fairly bad beer. I will not drink it again."
"D- its nice and drinkable because of how mild it is. I'll never confuse this with an IPA or stout, but its good easy drinking for a warm day"
"D: I have picked up a 6-pack on a few occasions. First, its normally cheap (yay cans) and second, I love watermelon. I imagine if you're not a fan you won't dig it. Something I bring to a party if I have a few extra bucks but not in the regular rotation."
"MD- unfortunatley I samples this beer on a damp autumn night and it was just okay. It would be much better enjoyed on a hot summer day."
"overall - would not recommend this. just not appealing at all."
"D- Light enough to consume easily, but the flavor doesn't really do it for me. Glad I go to try it, but definitely wouldn't have it again."
"D: medium. The taste and novelty just wear out after a while. Had this been colder, or had I more of a thirst for a light refreshing beverage, it might work. On a hot summer day, maybe; on this cool fall day, not so much."
"Would be highly drinkable on a hot summer day and tasted better than expected to me. It's a good novelty summer fruit beer, but not one I would seek out again as I'm not a big fan of watermelon."
"Pours a pale yellow with a thin white head that recedes fairly quickly and does not leave much lacing behind. Nose is pretty one dimensional with watermelon dominaing. Semi-sweet but not overly ripe. Taste is similar, although a bit of the wheat characteristics make heir way through. Feel is a bit light but well carbonated. Drinkability is decent, and this is better than many other fruit forward APWAs."
"I can't believe I still have four left.. ugh."
"Overall definitely worth trying. There are far worse fruit wheat beers out there."
"I don't think a beer gets more drinkable than this. A smooth refeshing wheat beer with a nice light fruit flavor just under the surface."
"D: This beer, despite the seemingly capricious nature of its featured adjunct, demands to be taken seriously. Unlike so many American-style fruit beers, this does not seem as if it was engineered to please non-beer drinkers. In fact, this does not come across as an effortless lawnmower beer--while it is refreshing, it would probably be much too beer-like for the casual drinker of alco-pop or light beer."
"Interesting stuff here: The watermelon works with and contrasts itself at the same time. Perhaps a bit to intricate though still somewhat drinkable. Worth a shot if you are into different kinds of fruit beers."
"Light-bodied with slightly above average carbonation and pretty boring overall on the mouthfeel side. Light and easy to drink, but I wouldn't order a second glass."
"Unless you hate watermelon or wheat, I would strongly suggest giving this one a shot even though it didn't meet all of my expectations."
"D- Not impress with this at all. It need to be sweeter and maybe add some other flavors to enhance the watermelon more."
"I'm probably going to have to drain pour the rest of this. Kudos to these guys for trying something unique, but it just simply doesn't come out very well. It's worth trying to see what it's like, but do what I did, only buy a single."
"This is an awesomely unique beer, with a strong watermelon smell and taste. I'm not sure the beer under it is the best wheat beer I've ever had---a bit grainy, lacking some of the complexity of a good wheat, and a thin mouthfeel, not rich enough--but the idea of mixing watermelon juice and a decent wheat beer is just a really good one, and this is a great, very drinkable summer beer."
"Pretty hazy lighter gold colored brew. Small white head but it lasts a while. Wheat malt scent with a nice dose of watermelon. Nice light wheat taste, nice infusion of the watermelon. Kind of sharp on the tongue, but a lighter to medium bodied brew thats fairly wet. Nice light brew for the summertime."
"12 ounce can. Not decanted. Aroma very hard to describe. I suppose the smell is like sugarry watermelon juice? Kinda unpleasant. Taste is actually nice and interesting and not what I expected after struggling with the aroma. Sort of a nice flavor to add into a wheat beer. Not sure why I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I like this beer...but I do."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, faint wheat note and a small fruitiness. In the taste, well, it tastes like a watermelon Jolly Rancher. A small dry, smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry watermelon Jolly Rancher aftertaste. It kind of reminds me of a average wheat beer and dropping a couple watermelon Jolly Ranchers in there, and then drinking it."
"A very popular beer this summer. It's easy to see why this little man in a can is so appealing to so many, but the purist in me hates gimmicks. Yes, it is drinkable and ""enjoyable on a hot day"" and at parties, beaches, etc. Hell, it's one of the most ""drinkable"" beers ever, a quality owing more to lacking flaws than having virtues that extend beyond a squirt of fruit. Pours a hazy gold with a soda fizz head that dies almost immediately. Aromas are very simple and straightforward: a bit of wheatiness and a lot of watermelon. Not bad by any means but neither is it ponderous in the least. Same for the taste and feel. It takes its name literally and is not nasty in the least, but neither is it interesting enough for me to ever buy again, unless it's for a beach party of the uninitiated."
"Taste is also pretty straight-forward; its clean, finishes nicely. Its medium body is a bit much for the style (wish it was a little lighter), grainy in the back, some sweetness with the watermelon flavor overpowering the other malts and any hops. Its about what you'd expect a watermelon wheat to taste like. The drinkability will vary by how much you like watermelon/fruit beers; for me I could do 3 max and then be burnt out but as I said some could do many many more, some 1 and done."
"This beer would have to be paired very carefully as the watermelon flavor would not play off of strong savory or sweet flavors well."
"Drinkability: I bought a six-pack for my wife, who's a watermelon fiend, and even though she told me I couldn't have one, I'm having one now. I don't think I'll have another one. I imagine, however, that some folks would dig it, under the right circumstances."
"Appearance is a light golden straw with a thick foamy head that sticks around with a lot of bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Smell of light fruit, perhaps watermelon, light honey. Taste is very light, I was honestly expecting more watermelon than wheat, but there is still a faint note having a light graininess to it. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. It's not a bad wheat, nice and light and easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel was light and well carbonated. I could see where this could be quite sessionable for some, and where I *did* enjoy trying this, I feel I would tire of the watermelon flavour after a pint or two. It's not bad, it's just not a flavour I associate with beer. Peculiar, for sure."
"Drinkability. Interesting brew, but one was enough for me, as the watermelon became a little irritating about 3/4 the way through."
"D. I could pound a few of these on a hot day. Not too high in ABV so I could handle this. This is strictly a summer beer though."
"Tastes like bread, grain, watermelon, and a little bit of sweet malt. Not overly sweet, and the watermelon flavor is light, but it is present. Decent carbonation, light to medium bodied, not much aftertaste. I am glad I had a chance to try this. Not sure I will pick this one up again."
"Bought this on a whim while grabbing a few other items at the lolcal bottle shop. Dark orangish in color with a fizzy soda-like had that disappeared quickly. Wheat and yeast aromas with a definite sweet watermelon aroma as well. Syrupy feel with a burst of carbonation in the beginning. Wheat and yeast flavors in the front that taper to sweet watermleon and orange flavors. Much better than I thought it would be. Pretty refreshing and easy to drink on a hot summer day."
"Mouthfeel was zesty with a medium to light body."
"Pours a hazy golden color, with a couple fingers of head. The smell is funky, but not in a good, Belgian sort of way. Instead its a strange, unpleasant smell, somewhat wheat like, but not entirely. The first taste is bitter, although not strongly so. After another sip or two, I start to notice the watermelon flavor, but I'm not enjoying it. I tried to finish this, but it became a drain pour instead. Perhaps its just the watermelon, but this beer simply does not work for me, even though I love wheat beers and fruit beers."
"Drikability is amazing. I could sit there and drink this all day absolutely fantastic."
"It is easy to drink and not very filling. It is slightly more alcoholic than your run of the mill macrobrews making it possible to drink a great many of these at any given time. It's a good beer to give to new beer drinkers. It's an excellent example of how diverse craft beers can be!"
"At the Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell, NJ. It poured a cloudy yellow/gold, with one finger of white, average retention, and average lacing. The nose was surprisingly grassy, herbal, and modestly bitter, with very little hint of the watermelon therein. The taste revealed the watermelon, blended nicely with herbal hop and malt midpalate, and not overpoweringly sweet as in some fruit beers. Also, it didn't fall flat at the finish as in other fruit beers; the balance was apparent in a crisp, somewhat minty finish. I must admit, this was a HUGE surprise of a beer after having two other watermelon beers in recent memory which were god-awful. This was a nice, thin lawnmower alternative for the summer months."
"Not bad, but not a seek it out, must have."
"D: I don't know how much of this I'd actually be interested in drinking at a time, but it's not a bad beer. Quite refreshing and better than some of the other beers that were on tap."
"D- Goes down alright, still, not that great overall."
"Notes: I was so excited to try this beer, since it just arrived into my area. The beer is not bad, but is not memorable either; I think it needs a little more kick in the flavor department."
"T- The taste is reversed from the smell. The watermelon is bold and the wheat is mild. It's like a jolly rancher was put into a wheat beer. Refreshing, but this taste is too candy-ish. I was only good with having two then had to move on."
"Notes: This is a very average wheat beer with some flavor thrown in to make it more interesting than just a bland beer. I don't think the watermelon flavor affects the score really at all, with it the beer is average and I wouldn't have missed it if it wasn't there at all."
"After drinking it I feel that despite it being hailed as a watermelon wheat beer the traces of watermelon are all but forgotten. The beer is light and makes for a good drink on a hot day but other than that not impressed."
"Light body, but not overly fizzy. Watermelon comes across very subtle, without an artificial feel. Easy to drink on a hot day. Not bad."
"This beer was gross."
"overall - won't ever drink this again, i only finished it, since i paid $2 for it. after seeing this beer on a website showing cool beers i should try, name seemed interesting and inviting, and after looking at the ""ba"" overall reviews for this beer, i decided to try it, and man, was it a complete disappointment."
"Drinkability: Sorry, but this one just didn't do it for me. It's difficult for me to be particularly interested in a bland wheat ale with a boring watermelon character. Bummer."
"Drinkability? This is the cud of the beer world. Never again."
"We just had 21st amendment brewery become available here in Georgia; I really liked their IPA and figured I would give this one a try it being summer. Pours a watery yellow with very little yeast though the can was agitated per instructions. White head disappears almost immediately. Smell is rather sour and has hints of not so fresh vegetable matter. Taste is pretty much the same. I hope this is a bad batch because this, to me, is undrinkable."
"D: A good summer beer. One is plenty for me, as I would grow tired of any watermelon beer fairly quickly. Give it a try."
"D- This was a very drinkable beer. The lower ABV makes this a beer that you can drink a sixer of no problem. The fruit flavor is very pronounced and would make it a good for lack of better terms a girlie beer. A good beer that hits the style of what it says it is going to be."
"not getting watermelon in the smell, maybe a wheat cereal type smell, maybe a bit of citrus. not much else. tastes akin to a watery wheat beer with the tasteless white part of the watermelon mixed in. there is a slight bit of acidity to be found, but not enough to make things interesting. fairly light bodied for a wheat beer. not my favorite, i'm glad i only bought a single can."
"Drinkability: The watermelon flavor was there the whole time, and was very intriguing. I wouldn't want more than one though, good for a novelty but average drinkability."
"My can says it's made in MN, so I'm not sure where it's made. Anyway, the appearance was alright, had a nice little head to it, but died out quickly to a thin lacing, then to nothing. Color was a hazy, faint straw. My nose was a little stuffy, but from what I could tell, it was mostly a wheaty smell, with background smells of watermelon, malts, and very little hops. Taste was more wheat in the beginning, but as it went down your throat, the watermelon really showed itself. It was almost as if someone dropped a jolly rancher in my wheat beer, but not as sweet and fake tasting. Great beer for the summer! Overall a decent beer, glad I finally tried it."
"Taste: Overall, lots a caramel and not your typical wheat flavors. Intense caramel just as it touches the tongue which them moves to straw and bread malts up front with a thin, slightly bitter edge. Hints at grape. Tons of caramel in the middle. Smooth but not too sweet though. Tropical fruits in the background. Finish is quite thick with light caramel, bread and long lingering yeast."
"The feel of this beer is refreshing and has a nice crisp feel to it like a larger. Goes down easy and is pretty drinkable."
"D: Easy drinker, would be good on a hot day if I couldn't find any water. Nothing special."
"I poured into a pint glass to one finger of head that was gone before I could discern what color it was. White if I recall correctly. The beer is pale yellow in color. The aroma is sweet and bready with a hint of watermelon. The taste is your basic wheat beer with some watermelon flavor. The flavor reminds me mostly of watermelon rind. It is crisp with a clean finish. it was worth a try and is quite refreshing after working outside 10+ hours in the mid 90's."
"Delicious to say the least. Highly drinkable and easy to put away. I am glad this made it's way over to Ohio."
"Pouring out a light hazy golden yellow. With a tiny white head that vanishes suddenly. The smell is what you'd expect, rather sugary with heavy watermelon and wheat. The wheat is light with a small watermelon back. It's subtle but very much there. Nothing very complex but really I don't want too much in this guy. At 4.9% it's perfect for spending the day hanging out with friends or family without having something that's going to knock you on your ass."
"I imagine that if the flavor was good, the feel would be OK, but the fact that this beer made my mind go down the ""I never want to drink again," path, and I wasn't even hungover makes me unable to give this anything even reasonably good. I think that the remainder of this beer should be donated to attractive young women everywhere in lieu of mace. Holy shit this is awful. Satan himself couldn't spawn something this evil."
"This is good for what it is. If you don't want watermelon in your beer, then don't drink it. If you're seeking a lighter-bodied fruit beer which doesn't overwhelm with its added element, you will enjoy this unique offering."
"D: Very light and quaffable. I could definitely sit out in the sun and enjoy it."
"D - I suppose I see a market for this, but this isn't for me. The watermelon is artificial tasting, and I find the sweetness slightly cloying. I'm not even going to finish what I poured; the wife is going to have to take one for the team."
"It was good, but I don't know that I will be getting it again at the current price tag near me. Good for the novelty of the beer, but nothing else really."
"And while the watermelon flavor is a pleasant and unique twist, the lack of much body or other flavor notes really takes away from the overall enjoyability of this beer."
"Poured this from a can into a pint glass. Kinda of a hazy light yellow. There was a big fluffy white head but it really didn't last long. Gone by the time I finished typing my first sentence. No real lacing. Lots of tiny bubbles floating to the top. I hope this was a good choice to pair with my pizza. I smell wheat and grains but not much watermelon. I really expected more watermelon. None the less, it doesn't smell bad. This beer is pretty two dimensional. Wheat and watermelon. Bubbalicious gum. I feel like I chewed this in little league. Decent mouth feel, the carbonation is great and the watermelon flavor is novel, glad I picked this up. Easy to kill beer, probably great for a hot day. Glad to pair it with my pizza."
"D: Can +1, but not my style. For those fruit/wheat people you may enjoy. Not heavy on the way down and easy to drink. Although does not scream back for another analysis."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Nothing I would purchase on a regular basis, but definitely worth trying. Good for your wife or some of your pansy guy friends. It is actyally kind of refreshing after a long days work out in the yard."
"D: I could drink these all day long!"
"Drinkability: Don't get me wrong this is not a bad beer. There is nothing about it that I fully dislike about it. My issues with this beer is that there is no watermellon aroma or flavor (which is the reason my old lady convinced me to put down that ipa to buy this instead). I enjoyed the wheat & is an ok american wheat with nothing really standing out to set this beer apart from the others. While it's not a bad beer it is not worth the price I paid for this 6 pack. I would rather spend my money on another choice in the same style of beers. Note: if you see a single bottle pick it up & give it a try."
"pours a slightly hazy yellow color with good white fluffy head, good lacing, and average carbonation. i don't want to bash beer, but.... this beer was absolutley disgusting. i don't see how anyone could drink this. now, i'm hoping that maybe i just got some from a bad batch or something. it was brand new in my local bottle shop so i know it wasn't old. it had a nasty fish like smell and taste. so much so me and two other BA's couldn't make it past a few sips. all three beers got poured out. just to make sure i popped the rest of the sixer and it was the same in them all. avoid this shit at all cost!"
"d - A very easy to drink beer but nothing crazy. If you like wheat/bread and hints of watermellon you might enjoy this one more. Probably wouldn't have again."
"This isn't bad, and it's certainly natural, I just really need a bit more strength and depth."
"Drinkability - no problem knocking these back. It gets the full gamut of reviews from the fire pit crowd."
"I discovered this beer when looking for something new at the liquor store tonight. I've always like watermelon beer, so I figured that I'd give it a shot. I wasn't sure about the can but since I poured it into a glass, it didn't really matter. The beer poured with a strong head that quickly disappeared. It's a yellow straw color. The smell is of wheat and watermelon but also of sour popcorn if you can imagine that. The taste makes up for any faults in smell and appearance. It tastes like a light wheat beer with a watermelon aftertaste. The watermelon taste is real and not artificial or too sweet. It reminds me more of actual watermelon and less of watermelon bubblegum. This is a good summer beer that goes down smooth."
"D - Very nicely drinkable. A lawnmower beer for sure. 4.0"
"A: 4.5, S: 4.25, T: 4.25, M: 4, T: 4.25"
"Notes: For some reason, this beer tastes much better directly out of the can. When poured into a glass, some of the creaminess is lost, which I feel really detracts from the overall experience of the beer."
"M/D: Easy to drink, and would probably be better on a hot day outside. I could see myself bringing it to a BBQ or dinner, but I probably wouldn't drink more than one, and would give the rest out."
"D - Sure, its good in that this could be refreshing on a hot day, but it surely does leave one disappointed in the overall package. Perhaps good to bring to a summer BBQ, but not really the type of beer to savor."
"D- Drinks well enough. I would only go for this on a hot summer day, in mass quantities, and served cold."
"I only bought one can but I can see buying more of this."
" Great little summer sipper. I like it and I usually don't like fruit beer."
"D- I didnt even finish my glass. The alcohol is low, this is a sweet beer. People who arent used to stronger, more flavorful beers might like this. Personally I think its a waste."
"On a hot sunny day, my wallet would be the limiting factor of how many of these I could drink."
"D- i got hooked on this stuff over the last week. i'm not much of a fruit beer guy but this is some seriously killer brew and i've had it with everything from fried chicken to grilled veal chops and it always seems to fit.. as a summer beer. on a cold december's night it would be an abomination but right here right now this is one of the most thirst quenching and drinkable things i can imagine. this is a wacky idea done right and the brewer's intentions are firmly clear. and from a can? awesome. that's means i can take em fishin."
"I'll definitely reach for this one again in July and August."
"I gotta tip my hat to the brewers for being creative with this one but I won't drink it again. It is to be commended that the watermelon flavor that was included seemed quite natural and not overkill artificial watermelon flavor like candy."
"I love watermelon but hate American pale wheat ales. Thankfully, the watermelon salvages this brew from obscurity. Thanks to mntlover for the opportunity to try this. Pours a hazy straw amber body with a small white head that quickly disappears without significant lacing. Aroma is faint, with some bready wheat malt and a hint of watermelon. Light medium body has moderate carbonation. Taste has a really pleasant essence of fresh ripe watermelon flesh superimposed on the unassuming wheat ale base. It works for me. Nothing exceptional, but I like it a lot. Best watermelon beer I've ever had!(I've actually had one other)"
"Drinkability: Good summer beer, not too offending, but nothing I'd go out of my way to get."
"Smells kind of funky. Pours a clear straw yellow color with good carbonation. Not really sure about the watermelon flavor. Not really a hoppy beer. Tastes sort of like a rita's water ice soaked in beer. Bought a single can with expectations that it would be much better."
"D - This one is not exactly in my wheel house, but those that like sweet wheat's, this may be OK. I think I will only have one. Certainly not my favorite offering from 21A"
"I didn't know what to expect but some guys recommended this @ Beltway Liquors, here in Baltimore. I'm usually disappointed when it comes to ""novelty beers"" so I did not have high expectations; this one is pretty refreshing, though. Don't expect to be overwhelmed with the watermelon flavor, it's pretty subtle and comes in toward the back of the taste. Almost zero hoppiness, I do detect a little spice in there. Makes for an interesting combination with the watermelon. I think this would be an excellent session beer in warm weather. Would pair nicely with salad or most any kind of fruit. Moderate carbonation--seems like just the right amount for this beer. Nothing remarkable a/b smell or appearance. Cans make for excellent portability and more compact for storage."
"Hazy golden color. Quite lively when poured. OK aroma-somewhat yeasty and wheat like. Moderate level of fruitiness. Rather chemical and industrial flavor. While it might be described as ""watermelon"" I find it to be more like tasting the rind or pith from one. Not overly unpleasant but just does not work. OK body for the style-crisp finish. A bit of a dissapointment. I would tend to think a watermelon beer would be hard to pull off-they didnt get there with this one for sure."
"Pours a hazy golden-orange color, with a minimal amount of fluffy white foam. Not much going on in the nose here, with the exception of the watermelon. Not so much fruit, but more like a watermelon jolly rancher. A little sweetness on the palate, some light wheat, but again mostly the somewhat cloying fake watermelon taste. Nothing special here, just a decent light beer with fake fruit flavor."
"Future outlook: A novel beer that didn't punish me for trying it....worth trying on those grounds, but not really worthy of seeking out."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Light brown, tan color. Scents of dry grass, hay that is slightly fermented. No real watermelon flavor to speech of. The wheat flavor was more like dry toast. No balance of malts or of hops. Watery mouthfeel. Very little drinkable nature."
"Yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head that stays at about a quarter of an inch.Aroma is faint fruit.Taste is malts,wheat and watermelon.Fresh tasty and refreshing.This is good for summer outings.Overall I would recommend and purchase again!!"
"Drinks easy- obviously sessionable- refreshing if it was a hot day"
"Pours BMC pale yellow with very little head. The aroma is slightly fruity, but not in any way identifiable as watermelon. The taste is not overwhelmingly watermelon like. More like a half ounc of watermelon schnapps dropped into the top of my glass. Refreshingly sweet, I feel that this would be a very popular beer if it were a little bit cheaper. As it is, It wasn't terrible."
"Clean, finishes nicely, medium body, grainy in the back, that's fine, some sweetness up front with the watermelon in the middle. Its about what you'd expect a watermelon wheat to taste like. Second taste, mouthfeel is fine, drinkability is fine. Nothing special, I like this brewery but this beer is just OK."
"D-Easy drinking although its not something I'd buy again."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is thin, but average for a wheat. The watermelon flavor is novel, but I'm not sure it'll be something I crave."
"Can, home. I'm not a big fan of most fruit beers and had been putting off trying this particular beer for a long time, and I'm quite surprised to find that I like it. It's not the prettiest thing ever - hazy pale gold with a minimal head. The aroma is wheatier and maltier than expected. Though there's a fairly strong candy fruit flavor to it, but it's not cloying. The feel is a bit thick and viscous, particularly for the abv. The flavor is relatively dry. The watermelon flavor doesn't taste artificial. The base beer doesn't really live up to the watermelon flavor. I'm not really sure what would, though. It's a nice flavor but not very beery. Good beer for a hot day."
"D: No thanks. Might be great for some folks as a summer beer, but there is something right at the front that I just can't get past. It tastes like someone wiped up watermelon juice with a dish sponge and carbonated it. I like their other offerings though, and would love to see more of their beers distributed here."
"This would be a very drinkable and refreshing summer beer."
"- This beer was one of the firstbeers that I just could not finish. I likened itto drinkingbaby vomit. At no point in life did anyone ata BBQ say, ""Hey, I'm eating watermelon, I'm drinking beer, boy would they go good together."" Beer and watermelon, two great tastes that DO NOT go great together."
"D- A great warm weather beer. This has been on my ""to try"" list for awhile, and it doesn't disappoint."
"The drinkability is zero for me. I haven't poured a beer in awhile but this one is going down the drain."
"Drinkability: Meh...This is a pretty bland beer. It's light on flavor and what flavor there is is almost exclusively an artificial watermelon taste. On the plus side, it is exceedingly drinkable and pretty refreshing. Take it or leave it..."
"pours a clear and clean sunshine yellow color with a white somewhat clinging ring.this looked like a mt.dew with some lace to me.. the smell is grain and slight malt and yeast with an unripe watermelon smell..the taste is exactly like the smell its really just average i dont like the unripe watermelon after tatse( although not overpowering to the taste)..and thats what you are left with sip or gulp..this is not a wheat i will buy there are so many others year round and seasonal and i do enjoy wheat beers..this one is below average..not recommended"
"Not a bad brew at all. I'd pick it up again and with the somewhat low ABV this would make a good summer session beer."
"Drinkability: A unique twist on wheat beer. Certainly not the best out there, but worth a look."
"Maybe this just isn't my style, as I won't miss having this again."
"Drinkability is ok not something i would really repeat buy but fruit beers are not my thing but sure wouldn't turn one down on a hot day by the lake or pool."
"I guess this is drinkable, but not my cup o' tea. Worth a try, but I will not be buying this again."
"You guys are tripping... My girlfriend talked me into buying this beer. I went into it with very low expectations...but I was very impressed. I find it to be very tasty for a light beer. I can see myself drinking many off these at a tailgate party or something like that. For not being my style in beer, this was pretty good."
"I will not let this hold me back from trying another 21st Amendment Brew."
"D: i may be slightly off put by flavor of the watermelon, but it is oddly easy to put down."
"Serving type: 12oz Can, no glass, 40 deg"
"Can label reads agitate before opening, what's wrong with waiting to agitate while the beer is in the last couple inches of the bottom. I just had the draft Live Free or Die IPA at Mad Mex so instead of the canned IPA I opted for a six of this and a four pack of the Monk's Blood since I've never seen or heard of that one. This one pours a clouded lemonade esque golden sunshine hue with bright white head forming and dissipating quickly. Minimal speckled lacing is left on the sides of my glass. Aromatics offer up a tame laid back sweetness from the sharp citrus wheat back bone. Fruity watermelon layers with pretty much absent hop additions. I like the low alcohol fruit vibe kick every now and again. A chalky yeast and minimal floral note wrapped within the watermelon puree, this stuff smells inviting and not candy sweet which is definitely a good thing. Flavor is light with juicy edges almost like bubblegum edges to it, but the watermelon puree acts as a refresher in this mix. Some hard mineral water action with a yeast wheat infused malt backbone, really straight forward flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky but not syrupy in anyway smooth ample carbonation levels, it's nice to see this available in the Burgh at Giant Eagle Marketplace. Drinkability was easy going a refreshing summer time beer that I'm sure will go over with the ladies out there. For me it was worth the experience but this isn't something that is going to replace the session IPA or pale ale anytime soon."
"Drinkability: pretty refreshing and moderately drinkable. It's not fantastic, but would do in a pinch on a hot day."
"D-easy drinking and somewhat sweet, suprisingly it shows alcohol with such a low alc beer."
"Drinkability - I'm still a fan of this for hot outdoor events during the summer - it sure beats a miller light! Heavy enough to feel like you're actually drinking something, but light enough that you could have a few because it's easy on the palate. A great summer beer."
"Pours a murky tannish copper color. Small white had which dissipates with spotty lacing. The smell is odd, there is some watermelon but also a heavy, earthy wheat smell that mostly covers it up. The taste is more watermelon, not too bad really but a bit on the watery side. Plenty of wheat flavor here as well. Body is on the thin and watery side. Overall this is not the best fruit beer I've had, the flavors behind the watermelon don't really back it that well, making for a beer where the fruit aspect is good but the rest is not really."
"Not what I expected and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't seek this out on it's own. Now I'm gonna' try this with lunch (a ""big salad"") and it might do quite well with that, otherwise I'd generally pass."
"crisp light mouthfeel"
"My rating is fair but please avoid if you can!"
"This is the worst beer I've had in a VERY long time..."
"I was expecting alot from this one as I've heard good things about 21st Amendment. Guess I was expecting too much. Looked like a really good wheat beer in appearance, and the mouthfeel was pretty good, but that taste of watermelon was truly awful. I know some people like fruit with their beer, bur watermelon is NOT a good mix. Truly a disappointment. Glad I didn't stock up when I saw this on sale for $5 a six pack. Maybe now I know why."
"The best part of this beer is the aroma, it's a pale yellow in color although I did only pour out a small amount for color review and drank it from the can as intended with this brew. I found the taste bland and for a beer hyped on watermelon with watermelon juice added the sweetness is non-existent. The finish is boring not leaving you with much of anything and not overly desire more."
"D= Not a bad beer by any means and I will buy it again some summer day I'm sure but it's a little dissapointing for a wheat beer and the taste is very candyish. Not bad though."
"D- This could be good at a summer barbecue. I will try it again in the summer to see if it has improved."
"D- Wow this is terrible. I sadly report I couldn't finish this one and I actually looked forward to this one."
"Picked up a single at Princeton Liquors. This is my second watermelon beer, but isn't as good as that Roy Pitz I had. While generally clean and interesting, the flavor isn't terribly pleasant - coming off like triscuits and cucumber salad. Sure, it kinda tastes like watermelon, but it's like the rind and seeds got ground up in added into the juice. No fun."
"However if you think you may like a wheat beer with a zing of slightly sour, slightly sweet watermelon. In my opinion the watermelon has ruined a good wheat beer in lieu of complimenting it. Thus the reduced taste rating. However this is largely about my aversion to this style versus a flaw in the brewing."
"Interesting beer. I can't say I'd ever think of combining watermelon with beer (nor do I really enjoy fruity beers), but I was looking forward to trying this one when some friends brought it over. It had a decent aroma.. definitely wheat with juicy watermelon undertones. The taste was like a hefe that had a dissolved watermelon jolly rancher in it! Kind of odd, but drinkable none-the-less. I can't say I'd look forward to having this beer again, but I woudn't turn it down if it were offered to me either."
"I had heard of 21 A and was excited to try one of their beers. This was my first watermelon flavored beer. the pour was a pale thin looking beer with a fluffy almost white head which dies quickly after pouring. the beer smells like (suprise) watermelon. The taste is balanced with a low alcohol content, very little if any hops and a very subtle touch of watermelon flavor. I am impressed that they pulled this beer off."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light, pale and wheat malt scent along with a strange breadiness and a weak watermelon aroma. The taste is decent. It has a smooth pale and wheat malt flavor with a mild watermelon character. It's got a weird taste to it, but I guess it's the fruit. I'm not used to watermelon flavored beers. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average beer, but nothing I would buy again."
"What's not to like about this beer. It is loaded with carbonation, it's a slightly pale golden color, not much head, with a nose that has plenty of lemony floral characteristics, and yes, I think I get a whiff of the watermelon too. Thre is a slightly prickly mouthfeel from the wheat, which adds a bit of texture to what would otherwise be a pretty water fare. The beer is refreshing. The taste is more of a sweet fruity concoction but there is a definite watermelon presence throughout. Watermelon is not a strongly flavored fruit, unlike a strawberry or blueberry, and I think that is true as an adjunct in beer as well. The watermelon is not overpowering, more subtle and well blended with the other fruit flavors. There is no real aftertaste to the beer. It's light, it's fun, what's not to like."
"Overall, I am not a big fan here. Muted flavors make this beer come off a bit gimmicky. I'm sure there are tons of people that like this beer just fine, but I think that one is going to be plenty enough for me."
"D - A really drinkable wheat w/ nice complimentary watermelon taste - not overdone and adds to the overall drinkability - a refreshing wheat/fruit combo."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Sickly pinkish yellow color with a big bubble head that quickly disappears. No lacing. Watermelon is the predominant aroma. And it tastes like watermelon too. If not for the watermelon there would be little if any flavor. Could not drink much of this. Great name and I'm saving the can but I don't think I'll be having any more."
"Possibly the perfect accompaniment to fried chicken."
"This would definitely make a great summer beer, and my lady friends seem to enjoy it. If you know someone who prefers malt beverages or wine coolers, Hell or High Watermelon might be a good way to get them interested in beers. Or, at the least, it'll get them interested in fruit beers."
"Light side of medium bodied...cloudy golden color....drinks nice but I don't think I could handle more than a couple at a time. A nice niche wheat."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells like watermelon with some wheat. Taste like it smells, wheat and watermelon, though not overpowering, good balance. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is an interesting and quality brew."
"Overall, not really impressed, but I didn't have to be. This won't color my opinion of the brewery, as it's the only brew I had and I knew what I was getting myself into. I'll try their IPA before I write them off."
"Hazed sun yellow boddy. Thin fluffy white head. Sporadic lace coats the glass in patches as I drink. Aroma is sweet, bright and melony. Interesting flavor, though it's not my thing. This is the first watermelon beer I've tried and may be the last. I don't get any real specific watermelon flavor other than a juicy sweetness. The wheat base is very average. Nothing really stands out here. Could drink some of these in summer if nothing else was available."
"I could drink a million of these. Nice flavor, but quite light bodied"
"D: Easy to drink. Refreshing. A great start for a summer barbecue or picnic."
"Overall: It's definitely worth trying (at least for novelty sake). It's not a bad beer, but if you take out the watermelon aspect, this is just your run of the mill American wheat beer."
"D- Not something i'd drink all the time but I think it is definitely an underrated beer."
"Drinkability: this one did not do it at all for me as I had a hard time finishing the glass. Some props go out for a fruit beer in a can."
"One was enough for me, no problems at all, just all I wanted."
"D) Nice summer day beer. Would've liked to taste more watermelon."
"If you like watermelon and jolly ranchers, this may be a beer for you. I could though give this one more try on a really hot day."
"Prost."
"I will give this brewery credit for their creativity. I do think it is difficult to get most beer nuts interested when serving something in a can."
"D: For its type, the beer matches up well with others, but the grainy taste and smell leaves a little something to be desired. Crisp and refreshing, and miles above many other ""lawnmower"" beers, but nothing quite worthy of the massive praise it often recieves on certain beer podcasts."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, this a decent fruit beer to drink for a while, but unless you're in the mood for the watermelon flavor there isn't much to this beer that would make me want to drink it otherwise."
"From the can, pours a pale yellow gold with slight haziness. The head fades to almost nothing, which is unimpressive, especially for a wheat beer. Aroma is acidic and slightly fruity with notes of lemon and green apple. Only because I am looking for it do I sense watermelon, but it smells like the combination of unsweet rind and watermelon candy. Fortunately, the flavor is more pleasant, more closely resembling the real fruit. It never strays too far from jolly rancher territory, but it's light and dry. A bit of a novelty, but it's certainly a creative effort with decent results. It's no problem at all drinking this one, so I wouldn't steer anyone away from trying this. I'm not sure that I would buy this again myself, but I was happy to finally get this one."
"Great for an end of summer BBQ while downing spicy ribs and smoked brisket. I could also imagine having this at the beach"
"Considering the light body and low abv, this is a pretty drinkable beer. However the flavor profile isn't enough to keep me coming back for more and more."
"drinkability - Interesting falvor. Not bad for a hot day. Light and refreshing."
"Overall nicely done. I would go here again, why not. A bit light for me to really call it a fruit beer, but I have had some damn nice fruit beers lately. Still more then decent though."
"12oz. can served in a standard pint glass. Poured a hazy straw gold with a quarter inch, loose, white head that quickly disperses into a broken skim with a thicker band around the edges. Some spots of lacing, but weak legs. Nose is watermelon rind and some citrus - very mild. Taste consistent with nose with some wheat notes in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and evenly carbonated - just the right amount of effervescence to give some body while also being refreshing. Finish is fairly dry and clean. Fairly easy drinking beer - not spectacular, but exactly as anticipated for what it is. Much better than the Hooker Watermelon in that it actually taste like watermelon and not like some artificially flavored substitute."
"Had this on-tap at the Rogue Public House in San Francisco. Pours a very hazy golden with a thin, white, swirly cap of a head. Smells vaguely sour with wheat and watermelon rind, a touch of lemon, and a tiny bit of sweetness. The taste is similar, with more white rind flavor than red juiciness, but as opposed to the aroma, there is at least some sweet, juicy watermelon here which adds something to the more sour and herbal rind and lemon flavors. Crisp, refreshing, and worth trying. A fairly interesting beer."
"Not a #1 choice by any stretch of the imagination, but an appropriate choice on this hot August day."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. I recently tried for the first time not knowing what to expect but it was quite well done. Smells of faint wheat and watermelon, and pretty much tastes the same with some malt backbone to round it all out. Nothing it overpowering and it's all very well balanced. For a beer drinker, I liked it and it served it's purpose of quenching my thirst straight from the can on a 90 degree F humid day. Some others that tried it, which I would not call big beer drinkers, actually were hoping for more of the watermelon to shine through. For what they were going for here though I think they did a great job. Very drinkable on a hot day."
"M: Certainly 'drinkable' and, honestly, quite refreshing. Despite a weak feel, the watermelon flavor and light wheat come through nicely; it's a 'summer' beer if there ever was one. Quirst-quenching and extremely easy going down. Not one to rush out and hoard, but certainly worth a try, especially on a hot day."
"D- Easy to drink for sure, smooth and great session beer."
"The smell was a sour note with the taste hitting you with a good wheat malt background with a really sweet juice of watermelon in your grill. It left a tad bit of bitterness but it could not overpower the watermelon. Overall this might be a good one for the woman but pretty darn plain in my tastes."
"A watermelon wheat beer? I didn't have high hopes for this beer, but it did raise the bar a little bit for me. Not exactly a summer treat, but this beer would come through in a pinch if there was no other fruit wheat beer available."
"D: I did not know what to expect with this beer and considering the style and its uniqueness it was very solid. Perfect for a day when you want to drink but not feel weighed down by some of the heavier choices out there. Can lists ABV at 4.9%."
"This beer gets a lot of flack, but I actually really enjoy it. It tastes a little artificial, but it is actually very refreshing. The watermelon is more pronounced than the wheat, but it goes down pretty well on a hot day. It is refreshing and flavorful and I would (will) be buying it again."
"Should have worked better...."
"The body was typical for a wheat beer, perhaps slightly thin. The drinkability took a penalty for the sticky sweetness. Overall, not a bad beer, I could see throwing a few cans in the cooler for a day tubing on the Nooksack, but this isn't something I'll drink regularly."
"Final Thoughts: Bought this beer for my wife to try to get her into beers with a watermelon, but turns out this is closer to a ""real"" beer than a fruity watermelon beer. It has a nice malty and wheaty biscuit taste and followed with some slight hops. I liked it more than her. My guess is Nikko and Shaun tried to make a Watermelon beer that beer drinkers could enjoy too, or as the last step between a fruity mellow beer and an IPA. It's also a great summer drinking beer after a hot day."
"I think the watermelon gives this beer a slightly darker shade than most wheat beers."
"D: I do enjoy Taco Bell (shoot me), but I didn't enjoy this beer. It's not something I'd have again unless someone made me drink it."
"- I could easily do a 12-pack on a hot day and wonder why I would be thirsty still and dehydrated.... a nice sporty brew for a hot day. Put some caffeine in it and it would appeal to some kids..."
"MF&D - Crisp and refreshing. A great Summer choice."
"Beer Advocate calls this a fruit beer but I would put it closer to a wheat. Although there is a slight watermelon aroma and taste it's really not that strong. It's an excellent, drinkable beer and a great summer draft. Might also be accessible to non-beer drinkers, like my wife."
"D: Would give this a decent drinkability factor rating here. Soft fruity nature with a decent crispness lends its way to a decent summer picnic quencher. The balance lets just enough of the wheat malting come through while the fruity watermelon taste comes through but never overstays its welcome. Good for several at a time like I said as a summer picnic quencher or tweener beer to beat the heat and something unique with a twist flavorwise."
"Drinkability is all dependent on how well you like the watermelon aspect. As for me, I found it pretty wearing. YMMV."
"Give it a try if you're looking for a fruit beer that is not overwhelmingly fruity."
"If you like fruit beer or American wheat beers, you should give this one a go."
"D: At first, i'd say despite the lacklusterness of this beer that it was actually pretty drinkable. But about 10 min after i finished, i didn't really feel that great and the thought of another wasn't very appealing."
"drinkability, i am glad i didn't buy it."
"Loved the first beer I had from this brewery.. another cool name and artwork on the can for this one. 5.2% ABV for a fruit beer? Damn, pretty high there. Pours a cloudy yellow.. not much head to it and little lacing if any. Smell is slightly sweet with some pale malt aroma in there. Taste is fairly light bodied with a decent mouthfeel, nice wheaty taste to it with a kiss of watermelon flavor at the end. I appreciate the fact that they didn't overdo the watermelon and make it way too sweet. Also, they didn't make it hidden either and you can actually taste it.. found a nice happy medium here. A pretty solid fruit beer, won't blow your socks off but pretty drinkable and pretty unique."
"Pretty skeptical of any fruit beer aside from authentic lambics, but I'd heard this was good, and randomly picked up a watermelon this afternoon so I thought I'd give this beer a shot. Pours a pale-ish yellow from the can, dissipating head but a nice color and slight cloud to it. Hard to pick up much watermelon in the nose, which to me is a good sign. Mostly pale malts and a light sweetness, which may be the fruit I'm smelling. Taste is actually just about what I was looking for - not too much watermelon up front, but a nice pale maltiness and a touch of wheat, almost reminiscent of a German lager. A nice refreshing touch of watermelon in the finish, awesome. Light yet not lacking body on the palate, and quite refreshing and pleasurable to drink. This is the first fruit beer (like I said, non-lambic) that I've liked in a long, long time. I would actually get this again. And the best part - no seeds! Mwaahahahahaha..."
"D-A decent brew...nothing wrong with it but nothing exciting either. Kinda boring with a bit f watermelon rnd bitterness making it different. Too bad...I have been looking forward to this one for a long time....we have a better watermelon beer right here in south central PA."
"12 ounce can...""Yeast inside-agitate before opening"" nice to see towards the top of the can. Pours cloucy lemony and still, w/o bubbles rising to the top. Quickly departing head and leaves no lace. I believe I do get a slight wiff of watermelon rind on the nose. Light and fruity, some might say watery even...Perhaps a hint of watermelon on the tongue...Lawn mower/very hot day beer..."
"Nice! Nothing fancy here, just an easy drinkin' beer."
"Aroma is very much a wheat, but sweeter. You can smell a fruitiness, but I'm not sure i would have said 'watermelon' if i didn't know. The taste is very fresh and unique and mild. There are flavors of wheat and fruit, but it seems to be more of the rind than the sweet fruit. It is much more clearly watermelon. It's highly carbonated, but easy drinking. A great summer beer."
"This beer is just not my thing. I waited to review until after I drank all six beers over the last week. Just didnt like it. The watermelon turned me off. I think with out the melon it would probably be a great sessionable wheat beer. It was just to weird for me, but I can see how other people might like this. However it wont discourage me from trying their other styles."
"Overall, kind of boring but a good summer session beer."
"D: Refreshing on a hot summer day. It's a decent beer, but not overly impressive. Low alcohol and light body increase its drinkability."
"Drinkability: Well, in the heat of summer with the clothes on the line to conserve energy, perfect! In the dead of winter, coming home from a long day with the freshmen, no so much. Plus, it probably helps if you like watermelon."
"overall: I really don't get what all the hype is about. Overrated."
"Pours your typical sort-of-amberish-golden wheat color. The color is actually somewhat of a surprise as you're expecting perhaps some red from the watermelon. Smell is very, very faint, nothing really to pick out from a hazy wheat body. Flavor is average wheat with the slightest bit of watermelon in there, true watermelon, not watermelon-flavor the way a jolly rancher or other candy is labeled as ""watermelon"" then tastes nothing at all like the fruit. Its a watery (the way the fruit is a very wateryfruit) presence with a hint of sweetness. Mouth and drinkability are also fairly typical of wheat style. Mouth is light and sort of unnoticeable. Drinkability scores it some points as you could probably drink a ton of them, as long as you like the flavor."
"Hazy gold, mildly turbid. Clean, sweet, slightly fruity smell. Taste: sour watermelon, sweetness of a wheat, hops linger. Can see myself craving this as a replacement for a sour beer when sours/wilds are not available. Really good balance among the 3 tastes w/o losing anything. Mouthfeel is light, watery. Drinkability is excellent."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with big foamy white head. Fades quickly leaving no lacing, very little retention. Smells like a typical wheat beer, cereal malts, wheat, spices, and a touch of lemon. Tastes of sweet malts, honey, wheat, clove, coriander, and orange and lemon zest followed by a nice blast of watermelon. Medium light in body with some moderate carbonation. Crisp and sweet with a nice sour melon finish that is semi-dry. Very refreshing and easy to drink, a nice summer session."
"i paired this with some brew free chili (which was amazing) and a siciliana pizza (terrific)."
"Overall a decent summer wheat ale. Not what I was expecting out of a watermelon beer."
"Can. Pours a cloudy gold with a small white head. Aroma of bready, wheaty malt with a touch of sweetness. Flavor is initially sweet watermelon (like the Watermelon Ice Baskin Robbins flavor) with a wheaty finish. Hmm, the tap version seemed a little more watermelon-y but otherwise an identical beer. Delicious as always!"
"Drinks easy, but only about 2 of these even on a warm evening are my limit, maybe worth a flutter again at a future date. I am not sure what the fuss is on this one is..."
"Tastes like wheaty yeast with watermelon. The watermelon itself is pretty good, it's the actual beer that's icky. A Zima lover's beach beer at best."
"A lot of what I read was setting this up for failure, but I'm pleasantly surprised. I expected a sweet Jolly Rancher mess, but the watermelon is done as well as anyone could reasonably expect. Worth a try just because it's probably the best watermelon beer that there is."
"D: Very drinkable. Would love to have this after a long day of working in the yard in the Alabama summer or at baseball game. The melon is just enough to let you know its there and what is up. The wheat base is nice and probably the perfect vehicle for a watermelon flavored brew. Just a joy to drink and it really puts a smile on my face. Look forward to trading for more from Tim. Thanks again, buddy!"
"Definite watermelon in the taste, but not as the dominant flavor. Good wheat base. Light sweetness on the tongue, but this is completely gone in the swallow. Very short aftertaste and very dry. Good body with a solid level of carbonation."
"Drinkability: Great taste for the style, especially if you like watermelons. An awesome summer beer..Bought a six and am happy I did"
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head over the cloudy blonde brew. Head falls promptly, with average lacing. Aroma is earthy and lightly citric, no watermelon I can sense. Taste starts tart and lightly sweet, finally find some watermelon in the middle, and then get back to a wheat close. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is better than average as well. Not sure the wheat and watermelon work that great together, but maybe as a thirst-quencher. We'll see what happens..."
"i'm drinking this on a cool rainy night, but this would be a nice deck/beach/boat beer on a summer afternoon...might also be a nice gateway beer for the ladies out there that don't like the taste of beer"
"Overall- Not bad. A good summer afternoon beer. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability is very nice for a fruit beer. It has a good, real fruit taste but it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the beer. As far as fruit beers go, this is one of the better and more drinkable I have had."
"Pours a pale hazy yellow color with a medium sized white head. Toasty wheat in the nose with the slightest hint of berry and spice. Interesting in flavor for the watermelon note doesnt strike the tongue until the finish. The Jolly Rancher like fruit flavor, to me, is actually quite a breath of fresh air in the world of fruit flavored wheat beers. Good drinkability, very interesting and inventive, an undeniably unique beer whether you love it of hate it. I would have this again, but not in any large quantity."
"Fruity wheat beers are usually a slight miss for me, but this one seems to hit the spot. Very refreshing, and the splash of watermelon is just right. I can imagine consuming gallons of this on a hot summer day. Recommended."
"D- Really easy to drink. Light and refreshing with a really nice flavor."
"At least it is not artificial fruit syrup, and has a bit of (largely washed-out) character. It's a bit too yeasty and thin/watery. Interesting as a novelty (second watermelon beer I've had). One drinks fine, but wouldn't reach for another (even in a ""watermelon mood"")."
"Pours a light, cloudy gold in color. Nice inch of frothy head forms on the pour. Smell is nice, juicy watermelon as well as some wheat. Taste is very nice. Very refreshing and welcome on a hot, humid, memorial day. The watermelon flavor never gets old or cloying. Surprising on how well it worked in the beer and how with myself not even being a watermelon fan, thoroughly loved this beer. I could drink nothing but this on a hot summer day. Very good beer."
"An OK brew. Works by itself on a hot summer day. A good beer to quench your thirst. Worthy a try for fruit lovers, and getting easier to find."
"Pours light straw-golden, almost pale yellow. Minimal lacing and retention. About as pedestrian an appearance as you can get. Smells like sweet wheat, combined with just a touch of melon (at this early stage, can't tell specifically it is watermelon). Taste... there isn't a ton behind it. Like a typical wheat beer, except there isn't a huge yeasty/wheaty flavour. The watermelon blends it in very nicely, otherwise it would be very forgettable. No hop presence whatsoever. Mouthfeel is thin, kind of watery, but I think that's what they were going for. This is my definition of a craft lawnmower beer - light, straightforward, not terrible. Not sure when next I will drink, but it is a neat little change on a warm night."
"single from Whole Foods, Falls Church, VA"
"Too sweet for me overall."
"*Taster's Note: Thanks to thehand for sharing this one."
"D- This beer really works. As it warms the watermelon becomes softer and the caramel malt hints and wheat bread flavors grow. This is a very easy beer to drink and I could have several in a session."
"Almost three finger of fuzzy white head has huge popping bubbles that turn rocky as it slowly fades. Body is a hazy golden straw colored that truely glows when held to light. Nose has tones of citrus, honey dew, fresh dried wheat and sassafras. With first sip you sit back and see that there is this juicy hint of melon that bursts onto the palate. Some pale rustic hops join with the soft wheat feel that leaves a consistent mellow hue on the mouthfeel. the fruit in this one is more like watermelon rind. Super clean and nicely drinkable. Would make a wonderful summer beer."
"I have had this out of a can several times now. Pours a crisp, macro like yellow, with a thick white head. The carbonation on these also is pretty macro-esque high. The smell picks up some candy sweetness, that is picked up in the beer as well. While this is usually a little too sweet for me, it hits the spot on a hot summers day. My wife also really enjoys this beer."
"There was anything actively bad about this but IMO, watermelon just doesn't cut it as a fruit in my beer. It always comes out tasting like someone threw a watermelon Jolly Rancher into a light-bodied Pale Ale. Just not my cup-of-tea."
"Very carbonated and very refreshing. I may drink a couple of these on a hot july day. Try it if you get a chance but I wouldn't go out of my way to get some."
"Label says ""agitate before opening"" - not sure how much of an effect there is here. The watermelon taste is rather natural, there's raw malt and at the pool this thing would fit in quite well."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It's a bit of a novelty, and that wore off towards the end of the can. But it's light, tasty, and would be pretty nice for the summer time. Worth a try, but don't go out of your way to get this."
"Pours a nice hazy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, which dissappears quickly, leaving some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, grassy, very slight watermelon notes. The taste is better with watermelon, malty, slightly grassy. Medium body. Drinkable, tasty brew."
" Recommended on the novelty of a watermelon beer alone."
"Not bad, and quite different, but don't go out of your way. Cheers!"
"D: Unbalanced, odd brew. Certainly not what I'd expect from a wheat brew."
"drinkability is pretty good. this one grew on me a little along the way, but i can't say that i'll be searching out mass quantities of it. still, it was nice and i wouldn't say no to another."
"Pours a lightly hazed golden amber, thick white head forms, thick ring around the glass, some decent lacing sticking around, good retention, looks nice. Smell is neat, very fruity, honey sweetness, watermelon seeds, orange peel, kind of biscuity and toasty, nice and refreshing aroma. Taste is pretty watermelon seedy, biscuity and toasty, wheat, lemon tartness, honey, very fresh fruitiness, some melons, pretty good. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, very refreshing if a little bland, but would be great in the summer."
"Drinkability- Had to finally try it because of the novelty factor. Anyway, no need to try it again. Many better tasting beers of this type out there...maybe not watermelon, but fruit overall."
"Overall a very pleasant beer. I'm happy I noticed it and picked it up. I could think of few better beers to drink during the summer. Kudos."
"Thanks to mymrnngjckt for throwing a can of this my way. Poured into my Chimay chalice a cloudy yellow color with about a finger of white head that quickly fades into a thin layer. Smells of crisp wheat and watermelon candy. Upon my first sip, yeah there's watermelon in here. Having a hard time figuring out whether watermelon extract or watermelon puree/pulp is used is this brew. Not sure you'd get this type of Jolly Rancher flavor from real watermelon pulp. Regardless, this tastes just as the label states which to me, is a good thing since I am a fan of watermelon. Mouthfeel is slightly lacking with bothe body and carbonation coming in a notch below medium. If this was more accessible, I'd have it on hand all the time from spring till fall."
"Really glad I had the chance to try this, but I can't say it is one I will be seeking out anytime soon."
"So in combining the memory of that particular watermelon - so juicy, so refreshing - with my love of a nice American wheat beer Shaun O'Sullivan has created something that for me has unimaginable drinking potential. I really liked this beer and consider it gimmicky if you want but I maintain it would be a godsend on any hot summer day."
"Drinkability: An interesting brew. The watermelon definitely comes through on this one, adding both a few complex fruit sugars as well as a tart, slightly puckering note in the finish. It works decently well with the beer's base too, though the whole package just leaves a little to be desired, in my opinion. On the drinkable side, it's low in alcohol and solidly made. Perhaps a few tweaks with this one - adjusting the malt base to something a little solider and simpler, and modifying the watermelon addition somehow (I know this is difficult, haha) would make this one a really tasty fruit beer. Still glad I got a chance to try it. Plus, it's in a can - another bonus!"
"The taste, though, is actually pretty good as well as being interesting and unusual and it somewhat grew on me. It's odd and different, but pleasant, with a definite watermelon element (a bit like watermelon candy without the sweetness), a general wheat-ale quality of grain, dough, and dryish fruit, as well as cucumber, and light juiciness with a finish of wheat and cooked beans. It's dryish, not really sweet or bitter."
"M/D - easy drinking light bodied beer, but the overdone watermelon is just too much and keeps me from enjoying many."
"D - Drinkability is not very good for this one. The idea of a watermelon flavored wheat brew had me very interested but this attempt just doesn't work for me on almost every level. Not sure if it's the combination of flavors in this particular beer or the idea of watermelon and wheat in general but, I just can't handle it. I'm grateful for the experience but I'll avoid this one in the future."
"D: I guess it has it's place in the world and I am glad I got a chance to try, but this is surely not one I would seek out again or waste luggage space on."
"Drinknability: Not a great beer, but a great niche beer. I would buy a case of it under 3 conditions: it was cheap, local, and during the summertime. Overall, decent."
"Drinkability: I could see how this would be a good beer to just knock back. Especially in a social situation with people who just like easy to drink beers. It was actually much better than I thought it would be."
"Drinkability: What a great gateway beer for kids! Tastes like Jones Watermelon Soda with a hint of malt. I really wonder about a lot of these Fruit / Vegetable 'Beers'."
"Numbeercruncher is certainly one of the most generous traders I've ever had the opportunity of doing business with... Matt... thanks again..."
"This one would probably be better fresh and in the summer!"
"I give them cedit with coming up with a unique, off-beat flavor combination. That doesn't mean I found it to be a particularly tasty or refreshing combination. Pours a bit of a hazy yellow, with maybe an inch of foam. Slight watermelon aroma. The flavor is tart watermelon grafted onto an ordinary tasting wheat beer. It comes across as just odd. Can't see it really pairing with food very well, and not really refreshing. Sort of interesting to taste once but not something I plan to have more of."
"DO NOT WANT."
"Pours a hazy dark gold with a thin white head that fizzes away quickly. No lacing at all. Aroma is an explosion of diacetyl. Huge butter note with a wisp of watermelon. Almost intolerable. Flavor is better in that the watermelon and wheat flavors come through, but there's still a lot of that gross mealy butterscotch. Mouthfeel is a little sticky for what ought to be a refreshing summer beer. Drinkability is not good because of how easy it is to get sick of this diacetyl bomb. This beer needs a reformulation."
"Drinkability- Overall I'm fairly impressed about how much they do get the watermelon to come through. It's a fairly subtle fruit and I can only imagine how many hundreds of pounds they have to use per batch. My problem with this beer is the astringent twang that seems to have nothing to do with the watermelon. I think it's just the base wheat beer they use. Either way, definitely worth a try. Big thanks again to Greg!!"
"Notes from and tasted on 1/5/07."
"Thanks, hoppymeal, for the opportunity"
"Overall: I am happy to have finally had the chance to try this one. Every time I stop by the brewery, they are out, so having my wife find it was a real treat. Although it wasnt what I was expecting, I have no regrets about it. Nice try 21st Amendment."
"Poured a 12oz can into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a hazy straw with a 1 finger head that disappeared within seconds and left no lacing at all. The aroma reminds me of a whole grain bagel with some sort of berry cream cheese. Good for breakfast not for beer. The taste is just flat out strange. The flavor is very grainy. It really reminds me of a Everything Bagel form Einstein Bagels mixed with a glass of water that had a Watermelon Jolly Rancher dropped in. Good for Zima, not some much for beer. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. I'm sorry, but I think I would choose a glass of water over another one of these brews."
"I received a can of this thanks to kplynch and RblWthACoz. I couldn't wait to try this oddball beer, I poured it in my hoegaarden glass and the smell hit me pretty hard, I think you could smell the watermelon on the other side of the room. The taste of it surprised me, I did not get the jolly rancher flavor, it's more like a watermelon rind taste to me. Goes down really smooth, not something I would drink a whole lot of but I can imagine this would be good on a really hot day. It is rather tart and refreshing."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a generous two finger white head that slowly falls to a layer of foam. A fair amount of webbing sticks on the sides of the glass but disapears shortly after. Smell starts spicy and a touch sweet from the wet watermelon. A musty wheat aroma with a disturbing dish soap scent that I can't get past as well. Taste is a slight improvement from the nose. Sweet watermelon up front with lemon and zesty wheat. Some pale malts and an interesting zucchini flavor that I could do without. Crisp and refreshing light body with an aggressive carbonation sting. A bit sweet at times, but I could drink this on a hot summer day. Glad I had the chance to give this can a whirl, but I don't see myself looking for this again anytime soon."
"D: Very unique but not executed extremely well. Drinkable but one is enough for me."
"Pale yellow. Aroma is an awful combination of sweetness mixed with pickled rind and layered with sweaty rotten wheat. Bad combination. Bad idea. This beer fails as a fruit beer and as a wheat beer. The taste was an unpleasant gag fest sour something with a hint of wheat. An after taste lingers long after the beer was poured out. I wanted to cry."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a grainy chewiness to it. Sweetness is a little too artificial for my liking but it does have a simple refreshing characteristic to it."
"It's here! New Seasons"
"Pours a nice cloudy lemon yellow color, decent sized white head fades somewhat quickly, leaves a handful of small patches of lace on the glass. Lots of wheat in the nose, some lemon, but really no trace of watermelon at all....until the first taste. Wow! That's some serious watermelon taste, sort of like a watermelon Jolly Rancher, tart citrus, slight grainy taste. Crisp and refreshing, slightly drying/puckering sweetness. Certainly something different for me, and while it's not something I'd want to drink all the time, I can see this being a good time at a summer BBQ."
"very drinkable. i put back 5 cans and didn't flinch."
"Pours out of than can cloudy with a rocky white head. some cloves, spice, and watermelon rind? No hop bitterness, of course, but there is that watermelon rind again. Slightly tangy finish. Can't say I get any watermelon sweetness-but there is a citrus flavor. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Could drink this all day."
"My wife laughed at me for drinking it."
"Blech! IPA Please! NOT the tastiest beer this brewer makes. Worth a shot to taste the hype."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with a nice white head that diminishes very fast. Nose is pale malt and some slight wheat. Taste follows with slight wheat flavor, and a decent dose of watermelon. It's like candy watermelon though, not real watermelon. The WM flavor is there, but the wheat beer is missing. Mouthfeel is too thin. Drinkability is pretty good. Overall an interesting concoction, but probably one I won't visit again. Their IPA is great, but this one just slightly misses the mark for me."
"D- I feel good about drinking this beer because it is my first experience with any watermelon beer, I love summer, I love drinking beer in the summer, and this beer is refreshing. Definetly not on my session list, but I like it."
"It's gonna be tough to polish off the other 4 cans left in my fridge."
"Hell Or High Watermelon Wheat succeeds because it tastes authentically watermelon-like. That's a good start. Here's hoping that 21st Amendment isn't completely satisfied and continues to tweak the recipe. Thanks to Georgiabeer for the opportunity."
"Not drinkable at all due to the fact that the it's not a good tasting brew."
"This beer was really hyped and did not quite live up to it even though it was pretty good, nice watermelon concept that might work better if it was in a lambic or wild ale, might buy another six pack in a few months but not something I will get every day, recommended"
"Decent mouthfeel, clean and refreshing. I could easily drink this in a warm day when I have a sweet tooth and want something easy to drink."
"Drinkability: I put a bottle of Irony Pinot Noir back once I saw the six pack of Watermelon Wheat. Now I have 5 cans to serve to friends or suffer through. I wonder how the pinot tastes..."
"Overall, Hell or High Watermelon is a pretty average brew that I won't be jumping at to purchase again."
"If this beer were a song, it would be ""every rose has its thorn"" by Poison. Cheesy, yet memorable. It also gave us Rock of Love 2 and daisy."
"Hell or High Watermelon Wheat is another well made beer from 21st Amendment. I wouldn't mind being able to pick this up every now and then when a full day out in the sun is in order and cans are called for; which is actually quite often. Thanks again for this unique brew Brian!"
"Very refreshing, although it still tastes 'synthetic' to me."
"D - Very drinkable, not too cloying."
"Pours a clouded gold. White head. Nose is that almost dirty wheat with fruit thing. Flavor at first is strange. Then it smooths out and the watermelon stays smooth and low. A nice accent to the whole thing. Feel has a fairly and biting carbonation to it. Liquid is good. I usually can't stand these fruit ""wheat"" beers, but this one is actually pretty nice. Great for a scorching hot day."
"as a rule i don't like wheat beers and i hate fruit beers, yet i like this beer. its tasty as hell. i can't explain it, but i like it. when i move to california i plan to keep a 12 pack or so of this around for hot summer days."
"The taste is the same as the nose. Lots of watermelon that mellows out some after a few sips, candy sugar sweetness, some lemon zest peeks through, a little yeast, quite flavourful over all but...I'm not a huge fan of watermelon so finishing the can will be a chore for me. Interesting concept for sure though."
"Spritzy. Bad mouthfeel."
"D: Not bad at all, a great summer beer, the idea of mixing watermelon with a wheat beer base certainly works here."
"D: very nice fruit beer. the metallic tones are a little rough, but I could drink a ton of these."
"Soft wheat flavors up front. Some graininess. Slightly tart fruitiness develops. Smooth banana-wheat background. Strawberry and watermelon flavors throughout, but peaking mid-palate. Mild bitterness and tart watermelon in the finish. Very interesting, and my first watermelon beer. Pretty refreshing with a medium, wheat-protein body. I don't even like to eat watermelon, but this beer kind of hit the spot on this warm summer evening."
"I was excited about getting this beer in a can. Had it few times at the brewery and look forward to it every summer. I have to say I'm a bit disappointed about this. The watermelon taste seems to be very artificial, to the extend that I thought they added watermelon syrup to get the flavor. Otherwise, still a decent wheat beer to drink in the summer."
"D: Easy drinking.... Just wish the watermelon lingered a bit longer."
"Wierd is how I would describe it, not really in a bad way, but its wierd. Intersting, but probably not one I would be in a rush to get again."
"Fun to drink though, very light, summer-y."
"It's a light hazy gold, served in a hefe glass with a slice of watermelon on the rim. The smell is easily watermelon when there's a watermelon wedge sitting right on the rim. But if you take that off and inspect it after the juices have left the rim it doesn't smell like anything more than a standard wheat beer. The taste is the same... without the watermelon slice on top or in the drink it just tastes like a fairly standard wheat. Still, it's not bad for a wheat beer but I don't think it's as unique as people think. The mouthfeel was a bit too spritzy/harsh and grainy for me. I could definitely still drink this if I needed a wheat beer, but it doesn't stand out that much above others."
"The mouth is nicely slick. Nice hot weather beer, another killer crossover beer from this brewery."
"The watermelon wheat looks like any unfiltered wheat beer: amber and cloudy. It has a white bubbly head that thins quickly. The nose is almost all wheat grain. It isn't until the first drink that you get a hint of watermelon. It is subtle, but noticeable, and adds a bit of sweetness to the beer. The closest I can get to describing the flavor is watermelon Jolly Rancher, but it not nearly that overpoweringly sweet. More like someone near you is eating a watermelon Jolly Rancher and you occasionally get a whiff. I was surprised to find that the watermelon is a nice complement to the wheatiness of the beer. Not a beer I would drink every day, but very good; much better than I expected."
"Pours very light colored with a small head. Definite watermelon smell, and taste. Easy drinking, slightly bittered watered down watermelon flavor. Nice in that you get the flavor you're expecting, but needs to be a slight bit fuller bodied and flavored, even for a summer refresher, I thought. Ok, but not as good as I hoped it would be."
"Poured from the 12oz can into a weizen glass. Body is a cloudy golden hue, topped by a bright white ring of creamy head. Aroma of wheat and lightly sweet fruit, along with a touch of adjunct malt. Palate is dominated by a nice, clean, mild wheat character up front. The fruitiness of this beer is nicely understated - only a hint of watermelon emerges towards the back of the mouth, and lingers only slightly on the finish. The body is pleasantly creamy, but still quite light and airy. A very refreshing beer on a warm summer evening."
"D: Good. I enjoyed this beer a lot."
"The body is light but the watermelon aftertaste (more of a hint) leaves a slight sweeter flavor. But not a malty sweet more of a fruity sugar sweet. Carbonation felt low but an interesting wheat fruit experiment."
"D- Very easy on a warm day or when the apartment is hot a little more watermelon would be good."
"It's interesting and quite easy to drink, but a bit one-sided. However, it makes a great summer beer, and would probably be great at backyard barbeques!"
"[Thanks to melbatoast93 for bringing back a few of these from his latest west coast jaunt.]"
"great concept, love the can. what a snoozer though. i have no problem finishing my glass.. but i won't bend over backwards to procure any more brews. thought the watermelon funk at BBF was phenomenal- that's what needs to be done to this beer to enhance its fruitiness."
"I give 21st Amendment props for making this beer. It sounds like something that I would try for one of my homebrews. I'm sure they did a much better job than what I would've attempted."
"Thanks to barleypop for the can!"
"Last swigs: This is trade worthy. Seek and destroy!"
"Not my favorite brew overall but I'm glad I got the chance to try it. I think 21st's small capacity is the best thing this beer has going for it because it keeps people wanting to try it."
"It's slighty hazy and amber, with no head to speak of. The nose is bitter watermelon and not much else. Taste is lots of watermelon, but it's not sweet at all. It's like watermelon vines. Very acrid and metallic. Mouthfeel is ok I suppose, it's a bit watery. The drinkability suffers from the non-sweet punch of watermelon flavor."
"Nice, light mouthfeel. Decent carbonation. This would have been an interesting beer to bring to a cookout. I think most people would enjoy it."
"drinkability: pretty high"
"Thanks to Lou for the chance to try this one. I can see myself trading for a case next June."
"Really an ideal beer to pick up in cans. Perfect for the beach!"
"This is a perfect choice for a nice hot day. If I could buy their new cans up here, I'd get a case."
"OK I'm pretty impressed with this. I really wanted to try it for the gimmick of a watermelon beer but I was pleasantly surprised to find a refreshing beer with alot of flavor. The appearance isn't anything to brag about and the aroma was a little like a capri-sun but the flavor was everything I thought it wouldn't be. Thankfully this is not a sweet beer. If it had been I think it would have ruined the beer by fullfilling my expectation of a watermelon extract/candy alcoholic schnaaps-like drink. Instead the fruit presence is definitely melon but was more cantaloupe than sugary. Highly drinkable... go get some!"
"Overall, mediocre but not offensive. Not recommended."
"Overall: Craft beer in a Can is new to me, and this is probably the first which I have had in fact in the US. Lugged all the way down from San Francisco and gifted to me by Gentleman BA Barleypop."
"Note: I'm giving this beer high marks not because I loved the beer but because I feel that 21st captured the style they were going for almost perfectly."
"I didn't think I liked this brew at first, but it definitely proves itself with subtlety and taste. An excellent pick for a summer seasonal."
"It arrives with a nice head, nice clear color, and a slice of watermelon (instead of the typical lemon). The taste is all beer, with just a hint of watermelon - enough to make a difference without feeling cloying or gimmicky. The draught is very refreshing, cutting through any flavors in whatever food you may be eating and cleansing your palette. Perfect with one of their great burgers, before strolling down to a game."
"overall I have to say that the best thing about this beer is how refreshing it was. It was almost like drinking lemonade. Now whenever I head out to Pac Bell to catch the Giants I make sure to stop by the ammendment for a brew. It is a great way to start an evening of baseball."
"Light gold color. A light bodied wheat ale. Fruit flavor is very subtle, its there but masked. Very smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is neutral. A good wheat beer, but the melon taste is not really noticeable"
