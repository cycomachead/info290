"Pours a hazy golden color with quickly fading head.  Smells of malts with hints of strawberry.  Smooth balanced lager with a mild sweetness from the strawberries coming through at the end.  No bitter aftertaste or malt drink weirdness. Light body with light carbonation that is easy to drink. A good summer beer."
"Not much strawberry going on.  Taste and smell reminiscent of miller light"
""
"Crisp, clean, sweet, simple lager. Almost no strawberry taste."
""
""
"This is a simple, easy-drinking, and pretty tasty beer. Clean, crisp, and refreshing flavor and mouthfeel. It's neither too sweet nor too watery. I probably wouldn't drink it every day, but it hits the spot when it's 85 degrees and muggy outside."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  When I first smelled this I almost forgot I had a strawberry beer.  There is only a faint hint of strawberry but a strong bread yeast smell to it.  The taste is where things get better.  More of a bold strawberry but again not a huge presence.  Suffice it to say I do not find it very sweet.  It is a pleasant beer to kick back and drink with non beer friends.  I enjoy having one of these for an easy drink on a hot day.  I will purchase another 6 pack for such occasions."
"Overall - A very nice warm weather beer, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  The finish was a bit off-putting at first, but the more you drink, the more the strawberry flavors envelops everything.  4.25 paws."

"A great seasonal beer, love it in the spring."
"Recommend highly when available on tap.  Bottle version does not provide same flavor."

"Pours a yellow orange haze, smells of strawberry and of malts.And surprise it has a  strong strawberry taste with a malty finish. A good beer for a hot summer day, i get a six pack every year drink it cold and fresh out of a ten i give it a strong 7.5."

"Tastes like strawberry yogurt. odd"
"Nose of processed fruit, medicinal, faint malt. Taste watery strawberries, malt, faint breadyness, dusty, grainy."
""

""
""
"Pours clear yellow orange with small white head, smells of strawberry malty yeast, tastes of creamy strawberries with slight malt smooth mouthfeel. Reminded me of strawberry captain crunch"
""

"Excellent brew abita.  Mix with andygator or turbodog!"
"Awesome beer with a smooth finish"
""

"Absolutely delicious. Can never wait til it gets released each year."

"After tasting purple haze I was bit disappointed with this one. It's not as refreshing as I expected and the strawberry flavors were a bit muted."

"Nice fruit beer, strawberry notes are not heavy and the beer is not overly sweet. Hops could be bolder, and I guess citrus hops would perfectly match this."

"Overall:  Interesting beer.  Fruity and creamy flavored (but not really creamy in mouthfeel).  Just an interesting beer."

"Pours a fairly clear medium straw color with a decent sized bubbly white head that slowly dissipates to a cap on top. Aromas of strawberry but a bit on the subtle side. Light spice, lemon, and just a touch of yeasty funk. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Yeasty wheaty with a hint of lemon and funk with a solid hit of strawberry to add a bit of complexity. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Nice fruity light easy drinking summer ale, I quite enjoyed it."

"The Abita Strawberry is a really good tasting beer. It is not too strong, or too light. You can taste the strawberry flavor that it has. The smell is really good as well. The taste is not too strong or to light. If you have not had this beer you should try it, if you like strawberry flavored drinks."

"Picked this one up as part of a mixed six at Ye Ole Spirits. I tend to like the fruit beers more than most so I was optimistic going in. The beer looked like a lite beer when poured. Not a lot of color or thickness to it. Not much to offer to the nose which was a little disappointing, no fruit smell and not much else. Flavor was also a disappointment, kinda like rotten strawberries in a cheap beer. From a guy who likes fruit beer this is one that I will not buy again and would only drink if I was on a quantity night."
""
"Overall: Not bad but really nothing notable here. It's a relatively boring base beer with an artificial (though not offensive) strawberry presence. It's refreshing and easy to drink though, so if that's all you're looking for then I guess it's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: It was interesting and didn't offend. Not a style of beer I'd go back to, however."
""
"Strawberries are the most notable flavor, which is as it should be considering what it is. The toasted malts are there and it finishes clean and crisp. This fits into the style well."
""
""
""
"O: Nice and easy to drink with a pleasant fruit flavor and not a lot of associated sweetness. Refreshing and a nice beer for a warm spring evening."

"Flavor: tastes exactly as I would expect a strawberry wheat lager to taste. The strawberry flavor is evident as is grassy wheat, yeasty bread and lightly toasted malt"

"I almost never drink a beer with fruit in it but was assured that Abita had done it really well so I gave it a shot. The first pour was a happy surprise as the beer was a nice golden hue instead of a fake red dye or something. I gave a sniff and was able to pick up on the abundance of strawberries, but also the wheat and barley which immediately screamed spring to me. The taste was smooth with a nice amount of strawberries through out. The mouthfeel was a bit thin but overall I really liked this beer. If you are a staunch opponent to fruity beers than this probably isn't the beer that will change your world view, but it is very nice."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/19/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger moderately dense and rocky light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big ripe strawberry, strawberry jam, wheat, shortbread, cream, and light floral. Nice aromas with authentic strawberry notes and moderate malt presence; with solid strength. Taste of ripe strawberry, strawberry jam, wheat, shortbread, cream, and light floral. Lingering notes of strawberry, wheat, shortbread, and cream on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of strawberry and malt flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a nice fruited lager style. Good balance and robustness of strawberry and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O- This beer has very little flavor and the strawberry character is a bit artificial. It was not that it has lots of bad flavor but it just has no flavor."

"Overall I could drink this beer again. If someone else had some I would drink it but I don't know if its something I would seek out. It's a decent beer but that's about it. Worth the try though."
"Call me a girly girl, but this is seriously one of my all-time favorite beers. I love the light airy quality of all of Abita's beers (as a Louisiana native, I can testify that it has a LOT to do with the amazing water quality in Abita Springs - where their other major industry is bottled water). The clean crisp refreshing flavor of an Abita Strawberry harvest is absolutely delightful. Not to mention the strawberries are fresh from one town over and leave a very strong strawberry aftertaste in one's mouth. I am thankful that this ""seasonal beer"" is usually lingering on the shelves for about half of the year."

"I'm not sure what the rave is about this one. It doesn't taste remotely like a lager, or any kind of beer for that matter. Instead of the fruit collaborating with the other flavors, this ""beer"" really doesn't have much in ways of hops or malt. It has some wheat flavors and grain, but that is all overpowered by the strawberry. The mouthfeel is its main problem though, as this is extremely thin (even for a summer beer) and the carbonation is too high. The only thing keeping this from being a terrible investment is that the strawberry flavor tastes natural (unlike in many overly thin fruit beers) and is not excessively sweet. But when looking at this beer overall, and especially when considering that it costs around $10/six pack, it's very disappointing."

"Golden straw colored in appearance. Just a bit of foam remains after the pour. Looks like a craft brewed lager. The aroma is purely fresh strawberries, not overwhelmingly done. Mouthfeel is very light and smooth. Tastes like strawberries and light malt. More strawberries in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Had a number of Abita's offerings so far and haven't been overly impressed but this one was nice for what it is. It's a strawberry fruit beer and that's exactly what you get. Not too overwhelming with the fruit flavor, nice aroma, nice color, very drinkable at 4.2%."

"A fruit beer that is not overwhelming like most fruit beers out there today. Nice smell very light but you get a good whiff of strawberry in the nose... at first sip the malt Is all there but literally 1/4 of a second later the strawberry kicks in on the middle of your tongue. It also runs down your throat slightly which is nice. Mouthfeel is about normal... nothing superb. A bit of a bite from the hops but nothing major. Overall a good beer and the best and only strawberry beer I've tried. To me a balance is everything and this beer is not overwhelming on any part. Would definitely recommend to fruit beer lovers"

"It is what it is... a strawberry beer. And at that it does a good job."
""
""

"I know when I think New Orleans, strawberries strike my brain first in association... Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear sunrise brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose is an adept recreation in liquid of a strawberry-flavored Pop-Tart, crust and all. The taste generally brings more of the same, though there's more of that crust flavor and a touch of berry tartness near the finish, which, oddly enough, seems out of place, given the pervasive feeling of sweetness throughout. It also kinda stabs out, an unnatural lightning. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an okay beer at best, but one that just doesn't quite sit all that well with me. Thankfully, the strawberry flavor isn't truly an artificial one, but it's not altogether pleasant, either."
""

"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is clean and easy drinking/refreshing. Not something I see myself getting into and buying but it was nice to have a go at and at least say I tried it."
""

" Overall a nice strawberry Lager that balances well with spicy foods like boiled crawfish. But being from Louisiana I may be a little bias"

""

"O: Overall a pretty solid beer nice ."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is one of the better tasting strawberry beers that I have had. Unlike other fruit beers that I've tried, the strawberry flavor is natural tasting and not syrupy or candy-like. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
"O - I love this beer. I dont care what others think. I look foward to its release each year. Its an easy drinking beer. Its not overly sweet and the stawberries and done very well in it."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is pretty one note, but it's a delicious clean, crisp, mild strawberry note. I could put back a few of these with no problem. Very drinkable."

"Note: this is a re-review. A year or so ago I had rated this at a 3.53. I don't know what I was smoking at that time. I really warmed up to this one in recent times, and I now put back almost a case throughout the summer. Working it in that often actually says a lot considering my promiscuous drinking habits."
"T: I was worried this would be too sweet since the aroma of strawberries was pretty heavy. I was pleasantly surprised. It was crisp and fruity and balanced: not too sweet, not really hoppy, but very refreshing."
"Below-average. Hard to finish. Doesn't even spell 'refreshment'. Avoid."
"All in all I thought this was a decent beer and a good example of a fruit beer, it had enough fruit flavor to stay true to the name and they didn't taste overly artificial, it seems to have decent balance also. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, and refreshing, and the flavors held my attention but I think they would start to wear on me after a while, one seems to be enough for me, I don't think I would want another one in a row, What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and very dessert like. What I liked the least about this beer was the drinkability, lagers are usually pretty drinkable, but this one doesn't keep me coming back for more. I might buy this beer again in the summer if I am in the mood for a light and refreshing fruit beer, but it's not something that I would buy a six pack of, I would recommend this to people who really like strawberry's or somebody who is just getting into craft beer. All in all I didn't mind this beer, it's not for everyone but I think it would make for a nice dessert beer, especially at a bbq in the summertime. This is one of the better beers I have had from this brewery but I'm still not crazy over it or the brewery.This beer was ok but I wouldn't seek it out again."

"abita really hooked this beer (malt beverage) up with a ton of strawberry flavor. i like it. this beer pours cloudy. there is a thin white head. the smell is a little sour smelling but not off-putting. taste is really crisp with a pretty huge strawberry finish. i try to pick some of this up every year when its around."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy light yellow-orange with a foamy light khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some earthy strawberry and strawberry juice aromas. Taste is much the same with a flavor on the finish that is almost like a biscuit with butter and strawberry jelly. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is light and refreshing but the smell on this one is better than the taste."
"O: this is a good fruit beer that doesn't have a syrupy fake taste"
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, particularly its strawberry flavors since they seemed unique and didn't have any sweetness."

"This is actually a rather decent beer. The strawberries are pretty much the only flavor that comes through and it's sweet and a bit syrupy. But in both the nose and taste its like strawberries and cream. The flavor reminds me exactly like strawberry ice cream. This isn't a fantastic beer and certainly not one I would drink a lot of at once, but this was a nice, refreshing change of pace for me. I'm glad I tried it. I may pick it up again."

"single finger white head with poor retention on a hazy pale golden body. Aroma of strawberry and raspberry with a grain base which isnt that sweet. Flavors are also of strawberry and raspberry, sweetest in the finish with a very light malt and grain base. Also has orange peel notes. Light body and high carbonation. This one is refreshing. Not too sweet. Not a beer or a style for me."
""
"Upon first pour, there’s a one finger head that dissipates quickly with little to no lacing. Unlike the raspberry beers I’ve been having lately, there’s no pink or reddish color to it. It’s a slightly cloudy light golden yellow with visible, active, carbonation. On the nose is, you guessed it, strawberries, but also a little bit of wheat. On first sip, I remember how easy it is to put these away on a hot day. I was discussing today how I have a hard time drinking heavy beers in the summer, and it’s because of how easy these types of beers go down in the heat. There’s definite strawberries on the taste, but it’s not overwhelming. The carbonation is pleasant. It’s almost like the “beer taste” stands up to the strawberries. It’s not syrupy or sweet like some fruit beers. It’s what I would call “well balanced.” This is probably one of the most drinkable beers I’ve had."

"O: A tasty, light, great smelling fruit lager, Abita's Strawberry Harvest is not too tough to handle and isn't artificial in any way I can sense. I liked the blend of wheat, light grains and faint strawberries throughout the brew. The 4.2% ABV is highly sessionable and I could see have a few on a sunny bayou."
""
"Overall this is a great beer for summer. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Enjoy it for what it is."
""
""
""
"My closest comparison is a warm strawberry muffin. While enjoyed the summery feel to the beer, and its very light flavors, I can't bring myself to drink more than two in a row, as after awhile it starts becoming overwhelmingly sweet, however it's definitely a relaxing beverage. I was especially impressed with the amount of strawberry flavor."

"A friend gave this one to me. It poures a nice hazy yellow color body with a fizzy head that dissappears to a thin lace. The smell is very inviting of sweet strawberry and wheat. The taste starts off sweet of strawberry then on the back of the tonuge the wheat comes to play. The mouth feel is very good, well carbonated, nice and smooth, easy drinking and a nice after taste of strawberries. Overall this is a good summer beer."
""
""
"Overall- Refreshing, flavorful, and easy drinking. A great summer brew for a nice hot day outside while sitting with friend and chatting."
""
"Mystery beer left over by one of the roommates in the kitchen fridge.. no idea how old this guy is, but I'm daring enough to find out. Pours a slightly see thru golden color, some bubbles ascending and some head to it.. well at least it isn't flat! Very faint stale corn aroma. Taste is medium bodied, slightly tart. Some strawberry on the back end, pretty well balanced and refreshing. A nice subtle fruit beer that isn't overbearing like a lot of others, a nice summer beer."

"Pretty good brew. Great summer beer that has nice refreshing qualities and a nice sweetness and strawberry flavor to it."
"O: A decent, thirst quenching beer. It's a lager first, a wheat beer second, and the strawberries are present in a distant third. I'm more impressed by Abita's Purple Haze (raspberry wheat beer)."
""
""
""

""
""
"O=I enjoyed this beer, despite it being lighter in body and flavor than anticpated, and having wheat, which I typically don't care for. Worth trying if you like fruit and wheat beers...not sure that I will purchase again, but I am looking forward to drinking the rest of the 6-pack during hot summer nights."
"Overall: This is a summer-time beer I enjoyed and will continue to enjoy. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a nice fruit flavored beer. Not bad atall. Something that was very refreshing on a hot summer night."
""
""
"O: Heard good things, but not really a fan of this. Would not pick it up again."
""
"O: very good refreshing summer beer - absolutely worth having again"

"Strawberry Harvest Lager is average beer at best. It doesn’t feature very strong aromatics or a notable flavor. It’s not a complete disaster, but it doesn’t do anything very well either. I’m not a fan of the buttery flavor that seems to linger throughout. Eh. Worth a try? Maybe. If you’re into fruity beer, yeah…probably so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Abita Strawberry Harvest Lager is a hazy, sparkling very pale golden lager with a small white head that vanishes very quickly. It has a faint aroma of fruit and grass. It smells like a wet barrel. There's a little sweetness in the nose and strawberries are detected. It's light bodied and lively; smooth with a clean finish. It's very lightly flavored. Strawberry jam is the primary flavor. It's just a little bit sweet and not bitter at all. This is barely beer, but it's fun to drink. This is one of those things you can just slam out in the hot sun."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter body, with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Alcohol is a non-factor. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. I expected an artificial strawberry flavor, but this seemed much more ripe and juicy."
""
"O: well, this is the first beer I've had by Abita, so I don't want to bust on them too much. However, this isn't necessarily a beer I will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: What Abita has here is a great, refreshing beer for someone who says “I don’t like beer.” For me, I’ll pass on another, though I like the idea of fruit-infused lagers; I just wish they were done in a more lambic-meets-Helles fashion."
"I really hope this beer is supposed to be better than this and this was just not right for whatever reason."
""
"Probably the shortest review I've written to date, that's not just a coincidence."
"Tasty beer but it is very much light in flavor and body. An excellent beer for hot weather."
""
""
""
""
"Light. Crisp. Resfreshing. Good summer beer. The aroma and taste wasn't as strong as I was hoping for, but nevertheless, still wonderful. I guess if you don't drink many fruity beers, maybe I can see the bold strawberry notes. I just didn't. For me, it was more subtle. But will definately have this again!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours slightly hazy and a light, reddish yellow color with a two-finger length white head. the head recedes slowly, leaving some lacing on the glass. Some bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass, which seems to indicate adequate carbonation. The smell is of pale wheat malt and strawberry. The aroma is fairly mild and clean. The strawberry flavor immediately hits the tongue on the first sip. The wheat malt also comes through, but the strawberry flavor is pretty dominant. The hop flavor is very mild, but some bitterness is present in the back end. This helps lend a little balance. The body is light and there is moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean. The drinkability is very high. When you have one of these, you can understand why this is anticipated as much as it is. It is a solid, refreshing beer that is much better than their perennial fruit beer offering Purple Haze. This is very enjoyable on a warm day or as an after meal drink. It really cleans the palate well. This is one of the better examples of fruit beer I've tried."
"O - You want a strawberry beer? This is the one for you. Strong strawberry flavors dominate and make this a great beer for those who prefer fruity flavors to the more traditional."

"Had from bottle. Smells like sugary strawberry and lager malts. Tastes like a coors with strawberry added...but its actually way better than that sounds. Its slightly sweet but balanced with the malts and grains. Nice brew, but such a low abv leaves me wanting more."
""
""
"O- In general, this is a very highly drinkable lager that deserves it's place as a highly sought after brew, from what I understand anyways. I did have a bottle while in New Orleans and found it very nice during the humid hot weather and I'm reminded of how good it really is! I recommend this one and think it is a high quality patio beer! I would love to see this one in my neck of the woods one day....maybe, just maybe!"

"not a big fruit beer guy ever, but this one is just really good. pours a very light looking hay color with a small white head and good bubbles. no pink or redness to it really at all, maybe just a hint. smells a bit sweet, like fresh strawberries and pale malts, crisp. flavor is really lovely, tastes like real fruit, nothing artificial or syrupy sweet. very fresh flavors, nice crisp finish. nothing overboard on the malt or hop fronts, just a good balanced beer that feels seasonally appropriate. honestly i could drink quite a few of these. feel is really light in body and very active on the carbonation. down easy, affordable, and yummy. this will assuredly end up in the fridge again this season."

"O-Avoids the overpowering fruit that most fruit beers have. Light and refreshing, not a great beer but a decent fruit beer."
""
""
""
"O- What a pleasant surprise! I bought a single of this not expecting much. I figured ""they make Purple Haze taste decent, I'll give it a shot."" Glad I did. I won't go running out to get a sixer of it, but it's nice to know that there's another good ""chick beer"" I can pull out of my pocket when need be."
""

"I treat this as wine, to compliment dinner or cheese."
"O: A nice, inoffensive fruity beer that you can drink several of."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It is what it is, incredibly mild, almost too much so, smooth, but wish it gave off more strawberry"
"Not that I expected much, but definitely not a brew I'll have often. Fairly flat in flavor and a bit too sweet for me."
"O - What a great job. I figured this would be a drink-once novelty but I'm adding this to my summer lineup. The strawberry level was handled expertly. It's just there enough to notice and appreciate it but not so much as to really taste like a strawberry-flavored drink. It's not particularly sweet or thick or overly strawberry-y. Well done. So refreshing and crisp and nice and drinkable."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer - light and fruity, it seems perfect for warmer weather as a thirst quencher and has a unique flavor with the strawberry juices."
""
"Overall/drinkability- this beer certainly is not hard to drink and the strawberry flavors to kind of grow on you though im not sure its something I would really be searching for again, to be fair fruit wheat beers are low on my beer todem pole but this one is inoffensive and decent, if you are into the style this may be worth look for you, if point its weakness the strawberry at times seems bit forced and strong but its strong point is due to light abv and crisp carbonation its decently refreshing and easy drink"

"Pours a lightly pinkish tinted light brown, mildly hazy. Scent leads with a nice whiff of fresh strawberry but some hints of sweetness pop up making me question will the beer be fruity or overly sweet, light pale lager body, some light caramel. Taste leads with strawberry in a nice moderate quantity, fresh fruit, light lingering sweetness, faint splash of caramel. Medium bodied, lightly fizzy. I normally knock Abita for their light flavored and light bodied portfolio of beers, but this one works."

"This poured out with a light pinkish color to it and a foamy white head on top. The head fades and just leaves a thin film over top of the beer. The smell of the beer has a pretty healthly aroma of Strawberry to it. The taste of the beer is very light, The strawberry is sweet and just watered down it seems. The mouthfeel is also quite watery. Overall this beer wasn't overly impressive, just not for me."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I liked the strawberry flavor of it."
"I heard a couple of good things about this so decided to try when I saw it available. Pours like a Pilsner, clear, yellow body, lots of activity. Smells of strawberry and yeast mixture. The taste is of unsweetened macerated strawberries. It's very prickly, ad soda-esque. I think Abita should go a little sweeter with this one."
"O- its a good beer but not one you would have all the time. A nice change of pace once in a while in the summer time from the ipa's"
"O: Overall, I feel this is a good beer, not great, good. It is refreshing on a hot summer's day and tastes different than many beers."
"Overall – The beer itself is very light, but the strawberry flavour gets tiresome after a while. I wouldn't be able to drink too many of these in one sitting. Glad I gave it a try, but I wouldn't buy this one again."
"The Rest: Good if you like strawberries. There must be some malt in there because it does have a decent body, but there is not hop profile at all, as typical of most fruit beers. Fairly refreshing, I would have to say its one of the better fruit beers I've had."
"O: I was expecting a disaster. Luckily, this wasn't too shabby."
"O: Louisiana seasonal staple! Delicious."
"-JH-"
"I almost never buy lagers because of how light and often tasteless they can be, but in this case the flavors work and the effect is pleasant and refreshing, almost like a very dry cider."
"The flavor is like a beer version of a strawberry frozen fruit bar that you would find in the ice cream section of your local grocer. The immediate flavor is strawberry. Some malt comes through in the middle and remains all the way to the crisp finish, but the strawberry makes a solid showing throughout the whole session. This is actually really delicious. I can never drink more than one fruit beer but if I had to, this would be the one."
"Overall interesting beer. Strangely reminds me of something from my childhood, but can't quite place it. I would drink again, but more than one would be too much. Hard to review because I don't have much perspective on this style or any reference beers."
"Overall - Goes down fairly easily, a great summer time thirst quencher."
"Recurring theme - strawberry and not much else."
"Aroma is crisp and malty with a strong and only slightly sweet strawberry overtone. It pours a rather typical clear straw yellow with a thick, fluffy, white head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Flavor is malty and has just a bit of strawberry taste, less than what the aroma promised. It is also a bit watery. Texture is thick and smooth, barely tingly. OK, but this is not one I will actively hunt out for a second try."
"O- Drink well, but the smell was just odd."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazed, bright, vibrant gold coloring with a thin layer of frothy head. Smooth, creamy aromas of strawberry that are reminiscent of strawberry swirl ice cream. Beer leaves a great lacing along the glass while you drink, and the beer has initial flavors of light strawberry syrupy sweetness balanced with some toasted grain flavors. The beer is light and crisp, and it carries a super-sweet aftertaste that is a light cream and strawberry combo. The finish is smooth and lingering. The beer remains light despite the mid-range body and stronger flavors. Good refresher on a hot summer day."
"O: this is more like strawberry shortcake than short's strawberry shortcake, and a better try at it."
"O: Definitely a beer to enjoy chilled as you kick back in the heat. The strawberries lend just enough flavor to not trick you into believing you're drinking an alcoholic strawberry soda."
"This is one of the very select few beers I have ever had that could be mistaken for soda in a way. Different and not really in a good way."
"Picked up a bottle of this one as part of a mixed six pack a few weeks back, and split it with my wife this evening. Poured a light orange color with a big white head. Very sweet strawberry aromas, seemed to be fake. Light bodied, with lots of sweet strawberry flavors, kinda reminded me of Strawberry Quik."
"A delicious fruit beer. Pours a light golden color, quick white bubbles with no lace. Smells of trix cereal and strawberry shortcake. Flavor is crisp with a sugar cookie malt and a tart hint of fruit on the finish. Overall a solid quaffer for spring/summer."
"Overall - not bad, a little different than the fruit beers that I've had before. Definitely worth a try."
"O: okay. One and done for me. Hard to get past the cloying sweetness, for a lager it's not that refreshing."
"D: Not too many strawberry beers out there, so this is an interesting brew just for that. Decent overall, but the nose is a bit of a weak point. The strawberry is strong, but also sort of odd. It contributes to a fruity pepples / crunch berries impression."
"O: Overall this is a really good beer. It tastes of fruit without being syrupy and is very clean. I would buy it again if I was looking for a strawberry beer."
"D – Easy drinker, good for sipping on a summer day. Clean and crisp taste. Slight sweetness added but nothing over powering. Good brew to try but wouldn’t seek this one out again"
"Bottle. Pours into a tulip glass a clear light straw color with a 1 finger white head. Very sweet strawberry aroma in the nose, almost too sweet and makes me think they used artificial flavors. Strawberry Pez aroma. Medium/light mouthfeel. Sweet strawberry upfront transitions to a watered down berry flavor with a slight bitterness. Minimal lace."
"Overall, this is a fine summer beer, but I don't want to drink one every day."
"Overall: This is a highly drinkable beer. I really could drink this like water. The very subtle flavor(s) is there, and then it is gone, leaving no aftertaste. It is very refreshing and quenching."
"The mouthfeel is light and crisp, perfect with the flavors. The drinkability on this is very good, this is very delicious and goes down very easily. Overall, a very enjoyable fruit beer that shattered my (quite low) expectations. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and snappy. Overall this is a neat beer. It's definitely an original and I think it's cool that it's being made."
"Into a tulip glass on 3.25.11. this pours a very clear and bright yellow golden color with a light film head a-top--has the appearance of a pilsner. Smell is a moderate and pleasant strawberry cotton candy noted one with a light trace of hops. Mouthfeel is a light and smooth but crisp wash over the palate that ends in a somewhat dry earthy strawberry finish. I don't think I've ever had strawberry fruit beer before and I have to say that I'm glad to have tried this...Thanks, Abita!"
"O - Like I said above this beer shines best as a post summer yard work day. The hotter it is outside the better this beer would be."
"Tried this for the first time in NOLA when on an incredible vacation. The food was incredible, the French Quarter was memorable, Bourbon Street was crazy, the Dominican cigars were fresh and enjoyable...the beer brings back all of those memories. The strawberry flavor is subtle and well blended in a very smooth tasting, very summer, and very exciting beer to look forward to."
"Overall this is a solid fruit beer! I am no a big fruit beer guy, but after drinking a 6 pack this will be my go to fruit beer. I actually called Pints o Plenty In forrest VA to see if they could get me a keg"
"Not great at all. Artificial flavor kills this. Glad I only had one. Not horrific, but borderline passable."
"D/M: Very crisp and drinkable. Overall a very good beer for the season."
"Drinking this beer in the rain right now at cellar temperature. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my mouth. Not very appropriate BUT come summer I'm going to drink a case of this while my son mows the lawn. Sweet strawberry smell reminds me of chewy candy. Artificial candy. Taste and body are thin, lighter strawberry but still with a strange creaminess. Despite all these things I really like this beer. In the summer. If you like kissing people who wear strawberry lip gloss give this a shot."
"D: Not too bad. It's nothing to geek out over, but it's good for what it is."
"Light and decently refreshing, super-easy to drink, good malt definition with just a touch of hop finish, I normally don't like fruit beers because they're easy to screw up but this one works out pretty well."
"Pretty good beer overall. Not a dominatingly fruity beer like some others, just a beer mixed with a bit of strawberry flavor. I'll enjoy this 6-pack, but I won't rush back for another."
"Overall an easy drinker that the ladies should love. The only thing to compare it to is Pete's Wicked Strawberry blonde and I'd say this one is the better of the two."
"(12oz bottle). Pours slightly cloudy with white head. Aroma of berries is prominent plus something that reminds me of cotton candy. Taste is sweet and tart from the berries with a bitter aftertaste. Thinner bodied with and oily texture. Bitter finish that seems a bit harsh for the softness of the strawberries. Not bad and probably my favorite abita to date."
"D: Not a ""go-to"" beer, but will finish 6-pack."
"I will say that this was a letdown, but I am not sure what I was expecting."
"I'm sure that this may appeal to people who hate beer but I would not buy it again. It could always be worse, like a chelada. Ick."
"D - Much better than I expected, the strawberry flavor is quite full and convincing. The underlying beer is nothing special, but it serves the purpose of providing a neutral platform for the berry essence. There is a little bit of a sulfuric off note in the aroma, but other than that it is clean and pretty good for what it is."
"M- bubbly, leaves smooth."
"D (Overall effect) - Even though this is not my favorite kind of beer, it is easy to see why it is such a hit in the south. For a good low price, this is definitely one to pick up when you see it since it is a limited release!"
"I don't like this very much, however, I have to give it credit for originality and I could see how this would be good served cold on a hot day. It is light bodied and drinkable, although the strawberry flavor gets old for me pretty quickly (and I like strawberries)."
"Kind of an odd beer. Refreshing, but unusual. Definitely scores some points for uniqueness."
"I typically really like fruit beers (big fan of Abita Purple Haze, that's why I tried this one), Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, Twisted Pine Raspberry wheat, etc... but this one didn't do too much for me. Average."
"D - pretty good beer. Not really my cup of tea but I can def appreciate it and it would be a good one to drink after a workout to cool off."
"It's ok but I wouldn't seek it out or recommend it."
"Pours a very light, golden yellow. A micro-bubbled, white ring forms. Smell is mainly one thing - strawberries - and gobs of them. Taste is the exact thing, just tons of fresh strawberries. A wheatie base. A bit of finishing hops hits at the right spot let you know this is a beer. Feel is a bit thin, and finishes sweet and sticky. Drinkability definitely above average. If you like strawberries, this one is a no-brainer."
"All in all the after taste / smell alone was enough to conjure up good memories from my childhood... not something I typically expect from a beer."
"So all in all, it isn't badly done, and thankfully it isn't anything like a wine cooler or cloyingly sweet."
"The aroma strikes you as you take a drink - like you stuck your nose in a box of Captain Crunch. This year's batch is extremely smooth and the flavor is the perfect balance of sweet and bitter, but again not as sweet as previous years (to avoid the overpowering of fullness)."
"Its a strawberry lager...and it does that pretty well. What else is there to expect?"
"D - Good fruit beer? Heck yeah right up there by Purple Haze! Good light beer? Definitely would prefer this over any light lager any day! Buy it again well... yes I would but only if I could find a reasonable price for a six pack or case. As of now a sixer is around 14 dollars so it's not on to top to drink again but overall try it if you can!"
"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is heavy on the strawberries with some wheat mixed in. The aroma is fairly syrupy. The flavor is strawberry, wheat and some vanilla. The beer tastes a lot like a strawberry Jolly Rancher. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad, a pretty good use of fruit in a beer."
"That being said, if served very cold on a hot summer day, I wouldn't turn it away."
"If rated against other strawberry beers this is well above average. Compared to other fruit beers its well below average. Give this is shot if you LOVE strawberries, otherwise you can skip it."
"D - Excellent hot-day beer, quite refreshing and drinkable."
"Good carbonation balance, quite drinkable. Refreshing."
"this is pretty decent actually, not something i would usually try but it works."
"D) A nice brew for the summer time."
"Every now and then, Abita makes a really decent beer. This is one of their best."
"I'm not big on lagers generally. I'm more of a stout and porter fan. But I have to say I am really glad I picked these up. Easily one of my favorite summer beer I have had this year."
"D - This is one of those light, crisp summer beers that drink like water. This would go down so fast on a hot summer day working in the yard. If it was a little more complex, it would be far more enjoyable."
"D - Excellent summer beer. Could drink these all night on a hot summer day."
"This is my favorite beer by far. I drive 1400 miles to get it every year and fill my little car with all I can fit in and then I keep it cold in my second fridge. There's nothing about this beer that I don't like and my friends love it too! I wish they made it year round and got rid of the Pecan Ale which is not very good!"
"D - Easy to drink, due to low ABV and no real offensive tastes sticking out. Strawberry beers are hard to do, and this is not one I care much for nor would seek out again."
"D- could have an entire case of these."
"However, nothing complex or amazing going on here. Probably will wait for next summer once this pack is finished."
"D: As fruit beers go, this one was decently drinkable, though not the best ever."
"Pours a slightly hazy blond yellow. Fizzy head that settles at about a half inch of flim at the top of the liquid. There is a brief faint hint of beer aroma, but for the most part sweet strawberry is all I smell. The taste is just way to sweet and fruity for me. The few bitter beer flavors that come out don't complement the strawberry flavor. I know slamming a strawberry beer for being sweet and fruity is like reviewing an IPA and saying you don't like the bitterness. It's strawberry beer, this is how it's supposed to taste and smell. They made it right, I just don't like it. That being said, I could not drink it."
"Notes: I feel this is a solid summer time beer but aside from warm weather refreshment I really wouldn't seek this one out."
"It's a nice beer, not really impressed but I could find myself drinking this on a hot summer day down here in Florida!"
"Medium body with a sweet strawberry aftertaste. Its wet in the mouth and there is no carbonation on the palate, second taste. Kind of flat feeling, not really loving this beer. Good thing my wife likes it."
"Mouth feel isn't great. It's a little thinner than I like-- and for something as sweet as this is, I feel like a touch more body would be good. Still though, it IS an excellent mouthfeel for a summer beer-- nice, crisp, and fresh. It's a little low on the carbonation, but it's almost like a bear soda-- you could make a super beer float with this and some vanilla icecream."
"Notes: Good. The first time I had this beer last weekend in New Orleans, it was a lot better (from what I remember). This merits the B-C that it gets."
"D: Reading the hit-or-miss reviews before mine, I fall squarely in the 'hit' realm. Wow, what an easy-to-drink treat. A well-balanced berry fruit melds with a springy wheat ale; it matches my taste buds well. I'll admit the Strawberry Harvest, though unbeknownst to me as of of a couple months ago, will now be a springtime craving. Well done, Abita."
"These are a bugger to find. Released early March, at the end of April it's almost entirely sold out everywhere in New Orleans. Spoke with a large store owner that stated that he was told by his distributor that the lager didn't leave Louisiana this time around. I picked up three six packs to take home to Bama with me."
"Overall I thought it was a pretty good strawberry flavored beer. It almost tasted like a strawberry beverage instead of a beer but it still tasted good."
"I split this bottle with my wife,not expecting to much,and it pretty much filled that bill.Poured a lighter golden color with a half finger white head that is gone pretty quickly.Aromas have some biscuit mixed with strawberry,not overly done,not bad.Flavors seem to be a little watery with the mouthfeel being quite thin,the strawberry flavors are sweetish and dont really lend a big hand,some mild toasted notes in the finish.Eh its ok but not anything I would have again."
"D- This beer is ideal for a break from yard work or sitting on the porch on a warm evening. While this beer would not typically make it into my fridge except for these purposes, it can certainly hold a temporary place on the shelf due to its timely and short lived span on the seasonal market."
"D: Two or three when struggling with the summer sun, more than that might destroy ones palate due to sweetness and tang."
"This is a regular pool beer for me. Every summer I grab a few sixers. Not a got to have brew but a nice summer refreshment."
"pours clear deep yellow with little head retention or lacing. smells a little bland with pale malts and a little strawberry in the back where it should be. The flavor is good and balanced with some sweet maltiness and the strwberry is in the back again where it should be. I'm not a fan of fruit beers but this one is good. very easy drinkin and light."
"I did not like this brew! The apperance was average for a normal lager. The smell was surley of strawberries and not a hint of anything but malt. The taste was not very good at all. It reminded me of how stinky feet smell. The mouthfeel is a little to light for my liking and it does not have a very decent drinability."
"All in all a decent fruit beer. It's not typically a style I really enjoy and certainly not a type of fruit that I enjoy in beer. With all of that said, it's probably quite a compliment that I enjoyed this beer."
"I always try to stock up on this one, but it never works out because I always drink these before anything else I have in the fridge."
"D - If you like strawberries and don't really like beer, I doubt you could find a better brew. Even with this being said, the drink-ability is absolutely superb for nearly anyone."
"very crisp and slightly refreshing...not bad but certainly not great either..."
"Due to the low ABV, I could put a few down, but my palate is telling me one is enough."
"Drinkability: If you like this sort of thing, this is a well-executed fruit beer"
"D: Almost too drinkable. These go down so quickly. Not too sweet, the flavor just keeps intensifying. The taste of this beer changes from year to year, but it is always spot-on and one of my all-time favorites."
"Refreshing beer with just the right amount of strawberry flavoring - not overwhelming at all! In a similar manner to Abita Purple Haze, Abita has managed to create a fruit beer with a pleasing hint of fruit flavor. I would definitely recommend this beer with Boiled Crawfish for a springtime Louisiana treat!"
"Not bad. A fun beer."
"Chuggable on a hot day, not much else."
"Very clean and light tasting. The gently malty beer finishes fairly dry, with a bit of strawberry taste but practically no hops at all. All in all a fairly average basic pale lager with a little strawberry taste. Light bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Easy drinking due to the very light taste."
"Taste... Ehh I had it when I was younger and liked it but now it's just weird. There's lots of wheat and a light hint of strawberry it's really odd. Skip it and get their regular beers."
"Anyways, a crisp refreshing beer for those who like fruit beers. Not as sweet as a Lambic but great for what it is."
"At first, I was a littl e reluctant to try fruity beer. After opening the bottle, the smell was refreshing. I was expecting a very fruity taste, but no. There was a slight hint of strawberry, which was good for me. It went down smooth. I recommend this beer."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- This beer isn't hard to drink I wouldn't say unless your the kind that dislikes sweet beer. A good warm weather beer I wish it was released in march or april and not febuary."
"this is a very drinkable beer. i'd understand if somebody who doesn't like strawberries or a beer that is sweet if they get sick of the taste. BUT i don't. this is a sip outside in the sun beer at its finest."
"Hazy golden cast with a filmy off white head. The fresh strawberry smell doesn't mask the grainy beer smell and is actually quite nice and less artificial than what I expected. Strawberries, cream and barley make up the flavor with faint herbal bittering in the finish. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Surprisingly good beer for the style, I think because it still tastes like beer."
"Drinkability...this is quite the novelty beer, this is a wild card amongst the world of fruit beer , not overtly sweet toothache inducing, a nice natural flow of strawberries pretty well played if your not scared of drinking with your pinkies raised. The carbonation issue was my biggest gripe with this beer until further sampling in the future years that is all for now."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not typically a style that I would go out and purchase, but for one reason or another, this beer intrigues me. If this brew wasn't so fizz-heavy, I'd get a sixer every year."
"A pale light golden color pour with a small fizzy white head , lots of carbonation , little to no lacing left. Aroma is kind of like strawberry cheesecake , with some light grain hints . Flavor is pretty strait forward , like a light strawberry wheat beer/lager , some light grain notes , lightly sweet , not cloying or tart , not really any hop presence , a good clean mouthfeel , light body , very sessionable . This was an enjoyable try but nothing I would buy again for myself ."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, strawberry, and grain. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strawberry up front, then yeast, and pale malt. Overall, a very light and refreshing brew. I could definitely drink a few of these on a muggy summer day."
"D - This one could be easily drinkable with how light and fruity it is...but it's just not my style"
"D - too much of a novelty for much enjoyment, but certainly an interesting thing to try once"
"this was a good summer beer, very refreshing. Being a strawberry beer i was glad to see thats what it tasted like, not a plain beer with some berry hints in it. flavor is good but not over powering. even my dad how doesn't really like beer liked this. If you like sweeter beers, or strawberries, you really should try this."
"Did I mention strawberries?"
"D - For a fruit beer it's very tolerable with the thankful lack of abounding sugar most fruit beers have. Good summer brew."
"Decent beer if you like strawerry flavor. I still like Sam's Cherry Wheat on tap (the fresher the better) or a good blueberry ale better."
"d- drinkability is just ok, probably won't have another, others didn't seem to think it was watery, maybe it's just me."
"Drinkability: Very nice for a fruit beer. The high carbonation makes this feel like a strawberry sparkling wine--moreso than beer. This is better than most of Abita's offerings, but due to the sometimes intense sweetness, I think the max I could have is two."
"Poured gold with a small head and smelled of strawberry. Medium carbonation, very light and crisp with a slight malt taste mixed with a nice strawberry flavor. It's sweet, but not a bad overpowering sweetness and I think the brew is just the right mix of fruit to give it flavor and still be a good beer. This was very tasty and refreshing, went down easy (almost too easy as I drank 2 in 15 minutes), and is the type of beer I could drink all night when it's hot outside. Overall a good summer beer!"
"EDIT: Right after reviewing this, I looked at this beer on Abita's site. On there, the beer is a bright red-grapefruit-flesh shade of amber. This beer actually looks nothing like that, and it'd look so much better if it did."
"Pours a yellow, hazy straw color with fairly little head. I suppose for a lager its fairly standard, nothing too exciting looking though. Aroma obviously has a fruity presence but its not really artificial or overpowering. If asked to blindly-smell it (if that makes sense) I'm not even sure I'd know the fruit was strawberry. This is an attribute of the flavor, as well. It taste like strawberry, but it doesn't taste like strawberry flavoring. It doesn't taste like a strawberry lollipop or such. A strong wheat presence is also detectable. The mouth and drinkibility are where the beer really shines if you are looking for something sessionable, particularly on a hot day. The light-body is crisp with good carbonation and it doesn't weigh you down at all."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a clear yellow color with a foamy head no lace on the glass. Smell is of sweet strawberries and a bit of lemon. Taste is of malt and strawberry just a slight bitterness from the hop character. Overall I did enjoy this and it goes down nice and smooth. Good summer beer."
"This is almost like a dessert beer just because it's so sweet. It's also somewhat refreshing."
"I really enjoy this beer on a hot afternoon or evening."
"D- one will do any more and it get to be overwheliming"
"D: Due to the sweetness I'm not sure if I could have more than one or two but this is well done beer. Abita has left me underwhelmed with other offerings but definitely not this one."
"The pour is pretty, i will give it that, nice head, soem lacing, but thats all that good about this beer. It smells and tastes like you squeezed a pound of strawberries into a glass of simple syrup, cloyingly sweet, no depth, no nuances, horrible beer, avoid it like the plague."
"In general I do not enjoy the fruit and beer combination and am not a big fan of this fruity concoction. I was able to finish it, giving it some credit."
"This isn't my favourite Abita, but it's near the top of the list. I certainly wouldn't decline if it were free. However, I've had better fruit beers."
"Very foamy, three finger plus head as you pour, settles down to one finger of bone white micro bubbles with a decent amount of lacing. Moderate depth to the yellow-orange color, retains its transparency, hue intensity drops off a lot at the rims. Pure strawberry filled nose, no doubt about that, ripe and even laced with powdered sugar, maybe some golden honey as well, can't find much past those strawberries. Light-bodied, here the grain, hops and mild bitters create a semblance of balance, the sour lemon pitches in too. Then it's back to the strawberries, even with less power than in the nose. Tends to cling to the tongue rather than lift, even at its relatively lighter weight. Easy sipper, not overly sweet, almost like an alcoholic strawberry soda or juice or something."
"OK beer in the heat, yet as my palate develops I find I like more richer tasting beers even when its hot (and I live in Dallas!)."
"Drinkability was fine, not really hurt by the strawberry as the beer is certainly not overly sweet. That said, not one I'd reach for under just any circumstance."
"I really didn't expect to think much of this beer, but I recently bought a second sixer. I think it will definitely be a summer favorite."
"*if you swish it around in your mouth, the extra fizz almost makes it taste like you are eating strawberry Pop-Rocks *"
"Pours a cloudy pale orange with a fluffy white head. Great aromas, strawberry, sweet malts and a little bit of floral hop, very nice. Strawberry and malt flavors blend nicely. The higher carbonation gives the beer a creamy quality which of course goes nicely with the strawberry flavors. There is a little hop bitterness and tartness in the finish. All in all a very well balanced beer, only maybe a little bit on the sweet side, can only have one or two due to that."
"D: I prefer fruit beers to be understated, with fruit flavors complementing rather than overpowering the nature of the brew. While the lager base here is pretty average, they avoid overdoing the strawberry flavor and it never comes across as artificial, which is nice. A light, refreshing, fruity beer."
"A good over all beer for fruity beer lovers."
"Pours a light golden color with an average sized head--a very clear beer. Smells quite a bit like strawberry yogurt. This is actually a very pleasant smell, and it is much better than I remembered it in the past. The taste is pretty much exactly like the smell. Nothing unpleasant, but nothing sets this beer apart. It's strawberries from the first sip to the last, so don't expect to anything fancy. The carbonation is spot on for this beer unlike many Abita's. However, it still feels a bit thin. The drinkability is good, but the sweetness gets annoying after a while. If you can put up with it, then it would be easy to sip on a six pack throughout the night."
"D- This is a pretty damn drinkable beer that would be a perfect summer outdoors beer. Recommended!"
"Overall, a good bier that was a welcome find at my local bier store. I would recommend it to anyone who is in search of a refreshing fruity bier. Prosit."
"Pours a light golden color with a very fast slim white head. Really carbonated, stayed bubbly the entire time. Smells very faintly of strawberries and really nothing else. It could just be me but the taste was not there. It had a slight hint of strawberry but other than that, I felt like it tasted pretty much like nothing, just sort of like drinking carbonated water. Because of the taste the beer is really easy to drink, if that is what one is going for. The fruit in the beer isn't overpowering in the least and it goes down really easily. not really all that impressed but wouldn't turn it down if someone offered."
"Strawberry for sure this one is. I like sweet fruit beers but this one is just too much for my tastes. Not enough malt in the wort boil, i think to accomadate the fruit. This is even to sweet to drink 2 in a row. A good beer perhaps for a fun loving lady of the evening!"
"Verdict: In all honesty, I have to say I like this. It reminds of me of Sam Adams Cherry Wheat in a way: it's a fruit dominated beer that just seems wrong, but you can't help but like. Of course, this is miles ahead of Sam Adams Cherry Wheat."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head that was gone in a flash, no lacing. Fruity aroma, strawberry is there but not overpowering, maybe just a hint of caramel and sugary sweetness, but doesn't smell bad at all. Taste is a nice dose of strawberries, sweet pale malts, a hint of bitterness, nice and crisp. I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers, but I do actually like this one and think it would be great on a hot summer day. Very refreshing and not cloyingly sweet or fruity. Thanks to deepsouth for the extra!"
"Overal a very nice fruity beer, perfect for the summertime"
"Wow, nectar of the gods? Strawberry flavor is subtle, yet omnipresent with a nice dose of light malt graininess. It would not surprise me if there was some wheat in here as well, as I get a bit of tartness near the end. This is one helluva refreshing beer. It's delicate, so drink it before any palate wreckers. Great job Abita!"
"D- Decent choice for a beer, great choice for a fruity lager. Paired with a peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwich"
"For a lager , I love it! Strawberry Harvest may not pair impeccably well with crawfish, but with a relaxing Saturday of friends, grilling, and a washer tournament - count me in! Buy this now before it sells out."
"I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers, but this is one that I would drink a couple of on a hot day. Very good example of a fruit lager."
"12 oz. bottle from Frugal MacDoogal's in Nashville. Poured a hazy gold color with a two finger white head. Aroma of strawberries and some malt. Flavor is strawberries. Light bodied with good carbonation. This makes for a refreshing summer beer, or a good beer to keep around for the ladies."
"Medium body with medium carbonation. Pretty refreshing on a hot day so drinkability is definitely up there when the temperature outside is right. Taste imparted by the strawberries is not overdone and it does seem quite fresh unlike some artificial tasting fruit beers. Overall one of the few Abita offerings that might be worth picking up."
"Drinkability: my first bottle was paired with a spicy Cajun salmon. The Cajun spice pairs wonderfully, wonderfully with the strawberry lager. We bought the other 3 cases. We host a crawfish boil and can't wait to try the brew with the crustaceans. Looking forward to enjoying one on the lawmower tomorrow."
"The color is a clear, pale amber. It pours a big, thick head that leaves excellent spotty lacing. Carbonation is lively in the glass. The smell is all strawberries without the medicinal tint of fake fruits or sweeteners. It actually smells a lot like fresh strawberries followed with a light hops citrus finish on the nose. The taste follows the smell accurately with perhaps slightly more of a subtle hops pine in a light finish. Mouthfeel is light; this one is not at all thick with active carbonation. If it's a bit light on taste and mouthfeel, at least one can tell it's all real; no adjuncts or cereal grains, just real strawberry and, though seemingly in fairly low volume, real hops."
"drinkability: a great session beer with low berry taste. Bud drinkers would highly approve. Not a great Beer advocate beer though. I could not drink multiples, just wanted to try it."
"D 4 - A very nice fresh strawberry fruit beer. It's great to know Abita uses fresh LA strawberries and it comes through in the seasonal release. It was a pleasure to try this brew in the fine town of Nawlins, with fine food at Jacques-Imo's. It's worth a try if you are open to fruit beers."
"Overall this is a good fruit beer. I've never had a strawberry beer before. Abita's done a fine job with this lager."
"Overall, this beer is very drinkable and I enjoy it very much. We can not wait to go to the Abita brewery and try this beer on tap!"
"Light and refreshing."
"Poured a slightly cloudy pale straw color in to my pint glass. The white bubbly head settled quickly, leaving a thin layer of bubbles on top. Aroma is very grainy with a candy-like strawberry sweetness. The taste is very sweet, with most of the beery-ness hidden behind the strawberry. The beer was a little bit too flat for my liking, but it did have a crisp and clean finish. It went down easy and would make for a good lawnmower beer."
"D) Light beer, Strong strawberry. The flavor is too intense to taste natural, but it is enjoyable."
"Atmosphere may be more pronounced than taste. The wheat overwhelms a bit, and has a watered-down taste, and the nose just doesn't seem to sync up with the flavor. However, decent quaff overall."
"The body is light and a bit wispy. Carbonation is low but ok. Overall, sure strawberries are hard to do, but there are some other off notes in this beer that just create an off experience."
"D - This beer rates very high with me, the natural strawberry flavors mend well with the Lager style in my opinion, this a very sessionable beer"
"Not my style so it was worth having once."
"Notes from 7/25/08"
"The aroma has a light lager smell with light but real strawberries. The appearance is yellow with a thin head. The flavor is quite refreshing and fruity like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall it's OK but lacks anything special that would make me want another."
"I had this with some spicy Jumbalaya and the spice played well with the sweetness. If fruit beer is your thing, I highly recomend this one it is one of the best I have had."
"I could drink a few of these especially on a warm day. Nothing earth shattering here, but better than most Abita offerings IMO"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Pretty watery overall, light on the palate, but that is to be expected. After drinking real fruit beers such as Founders Rubeas this pales in comparison...and the color shows it...haha. Carbonation is actually pretty low, would've expected it to be higher-to be something more like a wine cooler, but alas no...and thank God its not higher, that would totally bastardize this beer. Real easy drinker, I can almost chug this beer, I mean that totally signifies that it is a poor brew, anything respectable should hold its own and NOT be able to be chugged. This is one you could drink all night, but why.... unless you are trying to get your significant other wasted, and even then it'll prolly take more than a sixer."
"The new version is very sessionable, easy to put back plenty of these... and goes great with boiled crawfish!"
"All and all, not a bad brew. Not my favorite, but strawberries are hard to work with. Probably my favorite from Abita."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very pale golden hue with a thin white head that didn't last long. the head did leave a very small layer the entire beer. Aroma reminded me of strawberry shortcake, but more strongly of strawberry syrup from strawberry ice cream topping. Taste had hints of strawberry, but was mostly bland, possibly white breadish. Mouthfeel was very thin and watery, with heavy carbonation levels. The bubbles tingled all over the entire mouth. Easy to drink, but the carbonation detracted and turned it into a summer sipper."
"Poured this one halfway into a glass and had the rest out of the bottle. Pours a light, golden color. Very little head retention, it fizzled after about a minute, like soda. Has a strawberry candy smell, like a box of strawberry Nerds. Very light on the palate, with a hint of caramel just before the aftertaste. Strawberries come full force in the aftertase. No complexity at all, but very drinkable on a hot day. Definitely had more taste in the bottle than out. A decent fruit beer, not unlike Abita's Purple Haze."
"Pours a very nice hazy golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy white head, with lots of nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, nice touch of strawberries, with some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, some strawberries, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, a very nice thrist quencher."
"Not much head at all and pours a very golden color. The smell is probably the best part of this beer, with a subtle aroma of strawberries. The taste is mild and doesn't offer much bite, and the strawberry taste is minimal. Certainly not a bad beer, and easy to put down a few, but overall not great either."
"Pours a hazy yellowish color with a short lived smallish white head. Smell is sweet malt and strawberry candy, and a bit strange. Taste is like strawberry cereal and reminds me of the milk at the bottom of the bowl. Medium bodied with normal carbonation. Hint of odd sourness. Not that great."
"Tasted on 6/9/08."
"Single bottle purchased from Whole Foods poured into a SABL glass. Pours a crisp bubbly straw yellow with a decent frothy head that quickly diminishes to a ring. Aroma is sweet fruits and malts with just a hint of strawberry. The taste had a bit more of a strawberry kick, maybe too much as it seems to overthrow any beer tastes. The beer is crisp and well-carbonated, but possesses a slight bit of unexpected syruppiness. This one is certainly not one I'll be drinking again."
"The Abita Harvest Strawberry Lager pours light golden with minimal head. It is crystal clear balienced lager with the sent of strawberries. There is mild a carbonation and a gradual building of strawberry flavor. That is subtle and ballenced yet not overwhelming. The malt profile is light slightly sweet but with a bit of a dry finnish. This beer is nice light with nothing much to think about."
"An interesting beer glad I tried it. Don't think I could drink too many of these but It would be fun to have every once in a while. The strawberry flavor is great and refreshing so it is a great summer brew"
"D - I wish I could've drank a case of this in the weekend I was in New Orleans for. I'm dying to drink this again. It's that great!"
"D- Not bad. would not go crazy looking for it, but it hit the spot for me on this very warm day in June."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades fairly quickly and leaving some lace. Clear pale amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Strawberry nose. Flavor is strawberry but is not sweet; well thought out fruit beer. Clean finish. $2.95 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thin but persistent white head. The aroma is moderately fruity, definitely strawberry with a mild grain aroma. The flavor is moderately malty, a bit grainy and a bit sweet. The beer finishes crisp, dry with a nice reserved strawberry flavor. The body is medium and carbonation moderate-high. Overall a very refreshing well-made beer. Recommend."
"I enjoyed this with lunch today at the sterling Sun Singer. A finger of white froth tops a light-to-medium golden body. Nice lacing rings the pint glass. Moderate fruit aroma on the nose, but I expected a bit stronger smell. The taste is sweet without being cloying, delicious if a bit understated. It reminds me a bit of strawberry shortcake. This would be even better with a fuller complement of malt to round out the nice strawberry flavor. The lack of complexity leaves the mouthfeel a bit thin. Yet this is a delicious, enjoyable beer, very refreshing and nicely fruited without being overly sweet. The finish balances sweet with a light tart flavor. Good beer."
"D - This is just about the best non-lambic fruit beer out there in terms of drinkability and plain old goodness. I like this quite a bit."
"overall, this is a beer that look forward to trying each year. this is a nice summer beer that is easy to drink and would go over pretty good with those new into craft beer."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Lots of sourness, particularly in the swallow and the aftertaste. The carbonation is quite low. This is an odd flavored beer; not my style."
"Pours a very lightly hazey straw with a touch og light amber added to the color. A thick ring of foam settles afte the with two bubble columns rising to the top. The aroma reminds me of this particular strawberries and cream gummy candy I used to have when I was younger. I can't remember the name of the candy though. The flavor carries on the strawberry and cream smell with some very faint herbal hops jumping around in the background. The palate maintatins a slow recession of the strawberry fruit flavors. But its light, maybe a little syrpy. But still fantastic on the palate. Great for the summer. Relaxing , refreshing, flavorful, and unique."
"M&D: It's light bodied with a substantial amount of carbonation (too much, in my opinion) that bitters/mellows out some of the sweeter flavors that need more prominent exposure. The beer has a relatively long finish, yet is somewhat crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel diminishes from the flavor and experience to such an extent that I'm docking the drinkability score. While this is a semi-refreshing fruit beer that isn't too over the top, the flavor isn't sufficient to keep me coming back for more."
"Served in a chalice, the beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with pretty much no head at all. The aroma is weak, I can notice some sweet malt and a bit of strawberries. The taste is stronger than the aroma, however it just tastes like they took a macro lager and put some strawberry flavor in it. I don't know if Abita uses corn in their beers at all, but to me it tastes like corn/grain, sweet malt and some strawberries (good thing I like strawberries). There's a lingering strawberry aftertaste that's more like dried strawberries than fresh ones, which is nice. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit watery with above average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it goes down easy and it's not hard to drink. With all that being said, I wouldn't make it a point to seek this beer out. It's not bad, but there's just too many better choices out there."
"Drinkability: If you dig lagers and sweet strawberries, then you could definitely go for this. For me, it was a bit too sweet."
"this is nothing special or spectacular in any way, but it would be decent to drink on a hot day when you don't want something too heavy. it has a very light body and anequally light taste. both the lager and strawberry taste are very mild; the berries smell much stronger than the actual taste."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a light straw, forming a 1 inch white head, that fades quickly. Light spots of lace stick to the glass. The aroma reminds me of a BMC lager, with strawberry added in. Thank God the taste is better than the smell. The only way that I can describe the taste is Captain Crunchs' Berry Crunch cereal. Just like I remember as a kid. Not bad in my opinion. Light mouthfeel. Light mouthfeel and good flavor could make this a very drinkable beer, but I dont know of anyone who would have a second in one night. Overall, not a bad fruit flavored beer. I know alot of serious beer drinkers wont approve of this, but then again, I think its the right beer to start a non-beer drinker on the right path. Worth a try."
"i could see pairing this interestingly to a desert or meat option with some success."
"Our tasters thought the strong strawberry nose and the surprisingly unsweet taste were the strongest points of the beer, but it still lacked the body and complexity of a truly great strawberry wheat. Still, on the whole, it was a good fruit beer that even those of us who dislike such beers could enjoy."
"If you like strawberries and want candy-like beer. Go for this."
"This is a very drinkable beer. In fact, I would recommend this not only to fans of fruit beers or light lagers, but also for people who are not big beer drinkers that may like a sweeter beverage. This is definitely not for people who don't like strawberries."
"D: This would be an ideal beer on a hot, humid Louisiana afternoon. I wouldn't put it at the top of my list of fruit beers, but I found it quite drinkable."
"Strawberry Harvest isn't the kind of beer I'd drink on a regular basis, but I have to admit being a bit charmed by it... it's certainly more interesting than your normal macro lager. If you like pseudo-strawberry flavor then this may be your kind of thing. Worth a 6 pack a year purchase in my book."
"Perfectly clear light yellow with a sparkling head that settled down fast. Smells of strawberry yougurt. A fairly strong strawberry taste with a clean dry finish. An American lager with fruit and no adjunct off-taste. Good. A crisp, bubbly lager, that is a summer quaffer."
"I could drink this for a while, however the strawberry is a little bit much for me, and I may get sick of it after several of these."
"Recommended..."
"This isn't a complex beer, and certainly not a great beer, but a simple lager with nice strawberry undertones. It's nice to have a beer that actually tastes like what's supposedly in it."
"D: Drinkability was decent for what it is. You cant fault a beer by its style, and this is definitely one of the better drinking strawberry wheat beers ive experienced with a nice balance. Fruity, but respectably well brewed and clean."
"Props again to Jason.. one of the easiest trades I've had the opportunity of doing."
"A very strawberry beer. And it really tastes like strawberry, not all syrupy."
"D: Again, I enjoyed this quite a bit. No noticeable alcohol and the crispness was refreshing and not much cloying. This will be a good summer beer, a fruit beer I can actually look forward to more of."
"This lager is brewed for the Ponchatoula Strawberry Festival that is heald every year in April. The color is light golden color, reminded me of the Abita Golden but with a slight strawberry hue. I hope that this beer is made with real Louisiana strawberries. I assume it is. It is a very drinkable beer; I had two whilst walking amongst the crowds at the festival. It did, however, have a slightly off taste. It reminded me of the taste in Sam Adams Cherry Wheat."
"Drinkability - Nothing complex at all about this beer. I usually limit myself to one or two a season. A Sunday breakfast brew in the springtime that would make a great paring with some pecan pancakes. Not a big fan, but is nice for a yearly sample."
"D - It lacked much flavor at all. It wasn't a great brew but far better than their Purple Haze."
"Bottle pours a clear yellow body with an average sized white head. Some patchy lacing clings to the glass. Aroma is cooked strawberries and sweetish malts. Light medium body is crisply carbonated. Taste is dominated by an upfront strawberry fruitiness that to its credit is not at all artificial. Some clean lager traits hover underneath but hop presence is very fleeting. Quite well done for what it is. Pleasantly drinkable for a fruit beer."
"Glad I got to try it, but I doubt I would go out of my way to find some more."
"Nice Beer! ... This one surprised me quite a bit!... very fresh real strawberry flavour and smell, the smell is delicous!....sweet and refreshing, with a light mellowness... if you enjoy fruit beers, this one is very drinkable! ...""about as funny as Sinbad..not the actor but the sailor"""
"D - Definately drinks smooth and chrisp. Would enjoy this as an alternative to sweeter lambics."
"Overall unimpressed. I tried this beer because I liked the Abita Purple Haze but was completely let down. The smell was unpleasant and hard to place and the taste was decent at best. If you see this one out there keep on walking."
"What the heck, I have another bottle, so I may as well revisit this to see if my mind has changed. Nope, not really. It is plenty sweet, though, so be aware of that part about it."
"Pours a slightly clouded gold. Nose is a touch of strawberries over a firm metallic character. Flavor is kind of like a smooth lager with a creamy strawberry presence that is just slight. What ruins it for me is the somewhat harsh aftertaste of metal. Just too much metallic for my liking. Feel is thick with carbonation and fairly standard on the liquid. Overall it is drinkable, yes. Just not so much since there is a lack of firm strawberry and also with the presence of so much metallic."
"Drinkability: nicely refreshing and mildly pleasant. The strawberries are not fake tasting which is a big plus here. Not a bad beer, but not one you would drink all day."
"This is a decent fruit beer. The strawberry is not quite as artificial as is found in so many of this style. It's rather weak, but maintains a ""beer"" quality, albeit light. Rated per style. Better than other fruit beers, but doesn't quite do it for me other than being rather refreshing on a hot day."
"Drinkability- It is very easy to knock off several of these on a hot summer night. The novelty of the Strawberry flavor fades off and one begins to crave other more traditional styles. Which is perfect as it is a seasonal offering, although production doubled this year over last, and I am still able to find this Spring seasonal on the shelves in mid-September). As a fruit beer, it is an excellent representative of the style. I favor it over Pete's Strawberry Blonde."
"I had just walked from the Audobon Zoo to a place in the French Quater on a 94 degree 90 percent humidity August day in New Orleans. (thats about six and a half miles) Needless to say, I was thirsty. I like to drink loca,l so when I'm in New Orleans I drink a lot of Abita and Dixie (although I think that Dixie is being contract brewed since Katrina). Anyway, the bartender told me to give this one a try and it was just right. The appearence of the beer was nothing terribly special, just a nice golden color with only a little head. Aroma is real nice, a very pleasant but not overpowering aroma of fresh strawberries. The taste wasn't awe inspiring, but it sure did hit the spot. Basically, I would say that its a very clean, crisp, drinkable beer and the strawberries come through perfectly in the finish. For a fruit beer, this beer isn't fruity, it is very nicely balanced and very refreshing. In terms of drinkablilty, this one gets high marks from me, I had four of them without even thinking about it. This is truly an excellent beer to drink ice cold on a steamy day."
"Drinkability- OK I found this beer to be actually good. I think this beer would be great on a nice hot, humid Louisiana day. Right after maybe doing yardwork or something. All I know is this beer rolls at work when we get it in. We sell it by the case and we sell everything priced by the bottle! People love this beer and I have to agree with them!!"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but will I have more?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- With a smooth yet prickly entry, this beer softly foams and goes down extremely well. For the style, this ranks near the top of my list for fruit beers. It's light, easy in the mouth, and has a more subdued flavor than Magic Hat #9, for example. I finished this beer with gratitude to have tried it."
"Overall I was very suprised. I really did enjoy this. It was very unique and not overpowering like it could have been. Overall just a really great summer brew. I will definatly purchase again."
"Aroma of strawberries is evident as soon as you pop the top. Not too much head and it dissipates pretty quickly. Crisp and light with thin mouthfeel. Tastes a bit like strawberry soda. Pretty refreshing and easy to drink, but I prefer Abita Purple Haze for fruit beers."
"I was pleased with pretty much everything in this beer, except the mouthfeel. It was a bit too thin and wimpy for me. I'd like something a little more ""coating"" and lasting on the tongue. The smell was very nice, something like those little strawberry candies that your granny had in a bowl. The taste was similar, but also creamy, which made it unique. All in all a great beer to enjoy, especially on a hot day."
"Drinkability -if you're into strawberries, this is as sessionable a fruit beer as you'll find. It has a light body and toned down fruit influence, making easy to enjoy several."
"Not a bad beer. A refreshing treat for a hot afternoon. (95+ here today). The beer is a very light orange with little head. The strawberries are strong in the smell as well as taste. The beer does not have any strong harsh tastes that detract. Smooth all around. Easy drinking and at less than $7 a sixer I will likely buy a couple more for the hot weather predicted here."
"The beer pours a very pale yellow color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale malt scent along with a sweet strawberry aroma. The taste is decent also. It has a light malt flavor that is overwhelmed by a sweet strawberry taste. It goes down easy and finishes dry with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied brew with adequate carbaonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's not that complex or even well brewed (cheap strawberry essence), but it hits the spot."
"Unless things change, go with Pete's Strawberry Blonde. It is not as good as last years Strawberry Harvest, but it is way better than this years."
"The flavor is a sweet and subtle strawberry. Drinkability is good. A nice refreshing drinker on a hot day. I'm willing to bet that the ABV is low enough to pass as a session beer also."
"This beer is crisp and refreshing, with no bitterness to speak of (which could be good or bad, depending on your tastes). The strawberry flavor is ever-present, but don't assume that it's going to make you forget you're drinking beer. This is a fine fruit beer to try on a hot summer day even if you're not usually a fan of such selections."
"Overall, it's a nice strawberry flavor on an average to disappointing beer canvas. It's very pleasant to me as a strawberry lover, but not the best strawberry beer by far."
"Being a fan of other Abita offerings, I thought I'd give this a shot. I'm glad I did. I find it to be very refreshing. I buy this everytime my local beer store carries it. It certainly isn't for everyone. If you don't like fruit beers, certainly avoid this one, because it is strong on the strawberry flavor. If you fancy fruit beers and would like to try something that would go down so smooth on a warm summer evening, then this is indeed your beer. I currently have some in the fridge, which I can't wait to get home to. I drank it last night and it was wonderful."
"Pours a mildly hazed pale brass with many bubbles present, and a frothy white head that holds up well and leaves streaks of lace after each sip. Has a very sweet nose of strawberry and cotton candy with lots of graininess and some odd white wine aromas as well. Flavor is a medley of pale malts, toasted malts, subtle strawberries, cotton candy, and some pleasant supporting grain. Mouthfeel is bubbly, but doesn't stick the tongue too hard. Body is light. This is one refreshing and tasty fruit beer and a great one from Abita."
"I really think this might be Abita's best offering and one of the best fruit beers I've ever had. The base style is a great pick for the fruit, and it scores big points with me for not being wheat."
"This beer poured a clear yellow with a thick head. The aroma is malty with fruit apparent. The taste is malty and sweet with a healthy strawberry undertone. The mouthfeel is full. This is a surprisingly drinkable beer that I would recommend to those who enjoy fruit flavored brews."
"Overall, this one's yet another fruit beer that I am surprised that I enjoyed. It would be too sweet to have more than one of in a sitting, but it's refreshing enough that it's worth revisiting for a pint every so often."
"Body is above light with a crisp mouthfeel and average drinkability. Decent and drinkable, but modest and underwhelming."
"I'll probably get another 6 just to keep it around seeing as this is a seasonal. No regrets."
"Drinkability: This is one of my least favorite styles, so I was pretty impressed with this one. I probably wouldn't want more than one and surely wouldn't make it a session, but I could see some people being fans of this, especially for a light summer brew, which it's certainly come around for (despite all the current rain we're having in Richmond)."
"Despite its shortcomings, Strawberry Harvest Lager is an okay little fruit beer... as long as one's expectations aren't sky-high. More bursting berry goodness would probably make it one of Abita's best."
"Taste is pleasant, with a distinct strawberry note tucked away behind the watery wheat body. Some banana, vanilla, and raspberry as well. Very nicely done, especially when combined with the mouthfeel. It's crisp and light on the tongue, while a great carbonation level gives it a clean finish. Overall, it's fairly tasty, perhaps rivaling Abita's Purple Haze in flavor and drinkability."
"Shared with a friend (thanks, Tyler) at RFD Washington. This is a bit hazy, and relatively flat. Unfortunately the overall impression of this brew by everyone involved was best encapsulated by Tyler (who is a big Purple Haze fan), who described it as ""kids toothpaste in a glass."" Only for the fruit lovers. (#2773, 4/5/2007)"
"Overall impression: Not bad - certainly better than some fruit beers I have tried. It has been a while, but this reminds me quite a bit of Pete's strawberry blonde."
""
"This was an interesting beer to try though I would be reluctant to ever order it. The flavor was basically of dehydrated strawberries, as one would be familar w/ in Captain Crunch ceral. Though not having had any other fruit style beers it is hard to be fair in judging this beer entirely."
"I think this is a highly drinkable beverage. Cheers to Abita and cheers to BRoss!"
"Never before has such a delicate strawberry flavor been displayed in a beer that's decidedly a wheaty pilsner, and then executed to perfection. This is Abita at their best!"
"-UF"
"Single bottle, notched as best by October 5th"
"12oz brown bottle with best before October 6 notched on the back label. Pours a medium gold with a slight pinkish hue. One finger head with OK longevity and good lace. Smells fruity, champagne like, but not much else noted. Creamy with a definate strawberry flavor but not much else. Kind of like a lite beer with strawbery added. Nice neutral mouthfeel and huge drinkability. Not a bad tasting beer, a touch more malt and hops would be nice though."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a descent white head that retains ok. The aroma is where this beer realy stands out, with freshly picked strawberries jumping out of the glass, as well as a sugary sweetness, some biscuit, slight floral hops and fruity esters. The flavor has some slightly artificial strawberry notes, along with some table sugar sweetness, biscuit, vanilla, and some slight herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light and crisp and drinkability is near perfect. A good session brew, not too complicated or radical in its flavors."
"12 ounce bottle, twist off cap."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a solid straw color with a finger of head comprised of big bubbles. This falls fairly fast to a film over top. Clarity is very good, and carbonation is not really active in the glass. Nose is definately all about the fresh strawberry. Its sweet strawberry, but not fake, with a light creamy aspect to it. I think it smells nice. Flavor is not as dominated with the strawberry. The lager base comes through as what I would call a pilsner without the hopping, but is very clean and unobtrusive. This fades into a slightly sweet and very fruity strawberry. I was not expecting to enjoy this one, but I'd rather be suprised this direction than the other. I think the strawberry and the mildly grainey, almost a touch of chalkyness of the base beer compliment each other very well and accentuate the fruit character without it being overbearing. Abita has my attention on this one. Mouthfeel is moderate with a lively moderate carbonation. I think the carbonation level is ideal for the brew. Its not too little, but its not anything that is providing a bite that would interfere with the flavor. Drinkability is great. This one just works for me. Flavors are well balanced and proportioned just right. Excellent."
"edit: Crazy to say, but i have been having cravings for this one lately. I'm really enjoying them"
"Sampled at the Abita Brewpub as part of their select series. Color is light golden with little head. The aroma is of strawberries, fairly fresh smelling, with just a hint of lager aroma. Taste is quite similar to Pete's Wicked Strawberry Blond, just fresher tasting. This is basically a lighter american lager with strawberry flavoring. This is an easy beer to get down, but almost everything else available at the Abita Brewpub is more interesting."
