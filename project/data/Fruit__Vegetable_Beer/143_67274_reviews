"Tastes more of ginger than of grapefruit.  Not bad but, except for the alcohol, I'd rather just have a ginger ale."
""
"Cranberry beer...  Not very good."
""
""
"This is good for what it is, lots of grapefruit, some ginger in the background, very refreshing"
"I won't probably have it again. Taste like bland ginger ale."
""
""
"I love how refreshing this beer can be on a hot day. Crisp ginger flavor with underlying grapefruit notes.  Very light mouth feel with a lingering ginger taste."
"Drinkable and not very sweet."
""
"If it were a bit worse, I might guess it was a mass produced flavored beer."
""
"Good for what it is. Very drinkable."
""
""
"A really well crafted spiced brew.  This is a well balanced spiced beer.  very enjoyable with a small white head and excellent spicy aroma.  A great beer for a hot summer day."

"Pours a clear deep gold producing 1 finger of rapidly diminishing, slightly off-white, champagne-like head that leaves not a hint of lacing. Aroma is remarkably reminiscent of Buffalo Rock Ginger Ale with hints of grapefruit, caramel, lemon/lime & grain in that order. Taste is overwhelmingly ginger (more Canada Dry-like in the mouth) with hints of grapefruit, lemon-lime, caramel & mineral water. Finishes thin & lemon-lime citrusy with a ginger, peppery spiciness. Aftertaste is a shortlived, low level citrus, mineral in a thin bitterness before fading to an afterthought. Mouthfeel is light bodied, thin, watery with lively carbonation, dry, spicy & prickly. I must confess that my rating is based on personal prefence & not on parameters & merits within the style as I not sure that I have ever had a representative of the style that I liked and would drink again."

"Refreshing with a moderate amount of true ginger flavor and spiciness. Similar to a ginger soda in both flavor and mouthfeel which is both a good and bad thing for a beer. For me it is just too watery and soda-like to be taken seriously."

"Outlier detected. Please enter a review."

"The beer pours with a thin fizzy soda like head which vanishes seconds later.  Right off the bat you are hit hard with ginger and citrus on the nose.  It almost smells like some sort of fresh ginger cocktail.  The initial flavor is smooth and on the sweet side, but the sweetness quickly fades as it hits the sides and back of the tongue where it becomes dry and crisp.  The ginger is present from start to finish, and that juicy red grapefruit comes through perfectly in the finish.  It's light bodied and so juicy, but it isn't a sweet fruit beer by any means.  To me it makes a perfect substitute for juice with breakfast, or as a refreshing alternative to a cider on a hot day.  This is a wonderfully crafted unique brew that serves it's intended purpose perfectly."

"Tastes awful...served it at a Beer Festival and waited for everyone to make an awful face...we called it Red Bird Face."

"I miss this seasonal beer, and I love the citrus flavor that is hinted at with the grapefruit."

"This didn't taste it as beer, it sure tasted as a ginger beer. I was expecting a flavorful grapefruit APA, but it came out as a sugary soda drink. This could have been so much better."
""
""
""
"Terrible. There's more ginger in this beer than in ginger beers I have had. The grapefruit adds nothing but an awful foil to the ginger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has a very floral and fruity note to it. Appearance is clear golden as expected. Grapefruit bitterness once you taste and that kinda ruins the  feel. I know some folks like it so I gave it a decent review to help others along."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my ""mowing the lawn"" beer.. or admiring the lawn after I pay someone else to do it... it's freakin  hot in Texas. Easy to love."
""
""
"Taste / Palate: The flavor starts with a light grainy base malt with notes of ginger and mild white peppercorn. Very mild notes of tart grapefruit like citrus move in and lead into the dry snappy finnish. Hop favor seems very subdued but very complimentary to the Ruby Red grapefruit juice and it definitely adds to the dryness. The palate feels light and quite lively."
""
""
"O: not much positive to say; I expect a fruit beer to distinctly smell like the fruit it's brewed with - not the case here; also, even without real red grapefruit, it's so easy to impart grapefruit flavor in a beer with hops; finally, my bottle was poorly carbonated;"
"A great session or nightcap beer. Really light and refreshing."

"Here in South Texas where today the heat index will be above 100 again, this is a great beer to have after sweating. It's relatively low alcohol (4.75%) so you can drink a few of them without getting too intoxicated. It is a very dry and tart beer so it is not for everyone. This has to be served very cold, I have not yet let it grow warm so I'm not sure what it would taste like but I doubt it would improve with a higher temperature. I eat grapefruit often so I love this beer."

"I was expecting refreshing and light. It was light, and there were some interesting flavors brought about by the grapefruit and the ginger, but I didn't find it all that refreshing, a quality I seek in a brew that's billed as a refreshing summer beer. If it needs to be Ice Cold like the can says, then I guess that's a problem for me. I like a good ginger ale. I enjoy grapefruit very much. I'm not overly excited by this particular combination for refreshment. Maybe if it had been more wheat based without the ginger, I would have found it more refreshing."

"Overall, huh, well how about that, when I sit down and take the time to actually take a look at this beer, it's not that bad. Refreshing, heck yeah, I could be wrong but I'm not sure if I could find anything more refreshing in at least Southeast Alaska."

"It tastes like Ginger ale with a hint of grapefruit juice. Not bad for someone who doesn't really like that hoppy beer taste but wants something summery. I had this mid July with chicken wings, I'd say that's the best pairing for this beer. Nothing to write home about but refreshing with a light dinner."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Definitely a unique beer. It is quite refreshing on a hot summer day. Not something I would buy or drink regularly, but enjoyable none the less."

"I love grapefruit and it's my favorite out of all of the various citrus fruits. It would have been nice if the grapefruit flavor was more prominent. I definitely smell grapefruit but I get more ginger flavor than anything else. It's not necessarily a bad thing either. Overall, very refreshing to drink and not too sweet either."
""
""
""
"When I first had this three years ago, I really liked it. Now, not so much. It appears that the ginger has become predominant with the grapefruit taking a lesser role. It’s still OK, particularly since it’s a lawnmower beer. I can also detect a little skunkiness, probably thanks to Wegmans well-lighted cooler. It loses points for lack of head and lacing and for the skunkiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I guess my impression of this was to be a Radler but a bit more beer, instead this never appealed to me. The color and appearance was thin and watery, as was the feel but it seemed to be more nothingness. The taste and nose are acrid and saccharine with an artificial grapefruit. The ginger is sour and earthy, very vegetative, with little malt. Not my favorite."
""
"I've been rapidly tasting craft beers for a few years and this is by far my favorite summer ale.. Grapefruit is f*&%ing disgusting but I was completely blown away by this fantastic beer. Very crisp light enough to drink a ton of em on a full stomach AND plenty of flavor.. This beer is not sissy although it is light. Reminds me of water skiing, the beach, the pool and grilled food. GANGSTA!"
"o: I bought one of these out of a singles bin and then went back for a twelve-pack. Really well done and more interesting than a lot of the other seasonals."
""
"O- its good if you like drinking ginger ale with alcohol. I wont be having another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is something I picked up in a cheap make your own six pack at the grocery store just to give it a try. Honestly I thought it was just a summer seasonal from shiner and didn't see the grapefruit and ginger part of the label, and probably wouldn't have tried it if I had. I'm actually glad I did. Don't get me wrong, by my standards this isn't beer, which makes rating it here kind of difficult, but I gave it a decent rating because whatever it is, it's pretty good. I mentioned reeds ginger beer, which I really like, and this really reminds me of it. Very refreshing after a hot day. I would probably buy this again if I was in the mood for something a little different."

"Pretty Lite beer for a German style, well to serve the yuppie larvae all i can figure. Need some good barley malted ales here cut back on the rice and corn malts and you'll have a winner."
""
""
""

""
""
"Until now I did not like fruit in my beer. I may have to rethink that."
""
""
"O- I was expecting strong ginger and acidic grapefruit... I received none of that. Not good."
""

""
""
""

"This was recommended by a clerk in my favorite beer store when another customer asked about it. It sounded appealing because grapefruit and ginger are favorites and I'm open to trying fruit beers. I bought a six-pack to try and what a disappoinment. I like ginger a lot but the bitter ginger flavor in this overpowered all other flavors. I tried a small serving again with friends a few days later during a meal and it was slightly better with food. Others thought it would be good on a hot summer day but I can think of many other beers I'd rather drink as an afternoon cooler. I will defintely pass on this."
""
""
""
"This is the first time that I have ever heard of this beer and I bought some and It is actually really good. It is refreshing and has a fruity taste to it. I have always liked shiner beers but this one is really good. The smell to it is not that bad as well. I tried it for the first time on vacation and I really liked it. I am hoping that I can find some here at home. Shiner made a good summer beer. It is refreshing and not too strong of a taste at the same time. The smell is actually good as well. It is not too heavy or too light and I like that. For anyone who likes Shiner beers they should try this beer."
"Not a huge Shiner fan but i love this beer despite that most reviews here are not favorable. It's a specific beer for a specific time of year (i.e. on a hot summer day). I find it incredibly light and refreshing. A perfect beer for a hot summers day."

"O: This was a letdown. I'd recently had Harpoon's Big Squeeze, which is a shandy with grapefruit juice and I'd loved it. But this is billed as a fruit/vegetable beer, so I guess that is the big difference. Anyways, not a fan and didn't finish it (cooked with it instead)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was light with low carbonation. No crispness or zing. Overall it tastes like a beer with a shot of pink grapefruit added. The ginger was in the background mostly with a bit of spice in the finish."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, ginger, and grapefruit juice aromas. Taste is much the same with ginger and grapefruit flavors on the finish. However, when the beer warms up the flavors turn metallic and salty. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that smells like a solid ginger beer soda, but has a shift in flavors that make it hard to drink when it warms up."
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer but wasn't one of my favorites. The appearance was light yellow with a nice head, sniffed and found an abundance of grapefruit in the nose. The taste was a little odd with a quick yet intense grapefruit flavor, but then it immediately was gone and overtaken by a sweet, almost molasses, flavor that tasted like breakfast sausage. Interesting but not the best I've tried."

"it pours light to medium gold with a grapefruit citrus hitting you in the face, the hops are lacking like others have commented. The key here is the grapefruit and effervescent quality. So if your looking for an enjoyable summer beer you have one"
""
""
"Pours a amber in color with a pinkish hue that has about a 1-finger off-white head that settles down to just the top. Some spotty lacing was seen. The aroma is of some ginger and citrus with some hops. The taste actually has a lot going on with a good amount of ginger mixed with various hops and grapefruit coming through. Strange finish as it tasty a bit 'soapy' for some reason. Lots of carbonation as is noticed by the small streaming bubbles. Overall, it is different and isn't bad."
"The more I think of it, the more I think the mention of any hops at all on the back label is deceptive advertising. Either fix the beer with more hops, Spoetzl, or print up some new labels that promote this beer for what it really is: a grapefruit/ginger beer."

"Pours a medium amber with a pinkish hue. Zero head upon pour, looks like a glass of fruit juice. The nose feature musty grainy notes paired with notes of wheat, vegetal notes reminiscent of squash, no real discernible grapefruit. The taste is a mess. It starts with tart citric grapefruit notes which are undercut by strong husky grain flavor. No hops to speak of, and no real balance between flavors. Mouthfeel is absent of appropriate carbonation... all I get is a bit of prickle sensation, but it seems out of place. Overall, not impressed. A grapefruit beer with citrus hops would be way more exciting than this, all we get here is an artificial tasting lackluster brew."

"Cant really think of much Grub this would go with besides Fruit & perhaps some Buttery cheeses..perhaps Guda,Edam & Brie may be ok,though probably best as an ""Apertif~Cheers & Peace2All."

"Although Ruby Redbird doesn't appear to be the best formulated beer by any means, Its odd recipe comes together in much the same way that creative mixed drinks to. I just wish that the spice and fruit had more malt support"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too much rind and not enough grapefruit flavor. Although that would be unfavorable, too."
""
""
"The body and taste is ""watery""/thin -plenty of citrus yet is more like a lager than a radler/shandy. I do enjoy the citrus aspect of hops and like grapefruit -which is showcased in this beer but the flavor comes from the fruit and not the hops in the case of Shiner Ruby Redbird. Perhaps as a Pale ale with grapefruit the beer would be more appealing."

"Sure, this was a session beer...but that's only assuming that more than one would be had in a sitting. For me, I could have a few at a time but it's easy to see why most people would only drink one of these before moving onto something else. There's not much to love here and unless you're looking to kick back with a few on a hot afternoon, there's not much to take away from this. This was pretty much a textbook example of what a Summer seasonal should be."
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Dark amber, with rising effervescence that eventually taps out, very slight head, and no lacing. Grains with lots of ginger and some grapefruit. Bitter fruit and raw ginger. Overall, this is a serviceable quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a beer claiming to be the perfect summer beer, this one leaves a little to be desired, it is just average or even below average."
""
""

""
""
""

"O: This is easy to drink but reminds me more of a Radler than anything else. I don't think I enjoyed this one. As another reviewer stated, it reminds me of Fresca combined with ginger ale more than it does a beer."
"Overall: done in by no head. Sam Adams Summer Ale still the summer beer of choice"
"Overall: Look, if the idea of a beer with considerable grapefruit and ginger flavors sounds uninviting, then this probably isn't your best option. For me, as someone who likes ginger and grapefruit, I enjoyed drinking this while acknowledging that it's not complex. It's not the best fruit beer out there, but if you happen to crave both beer and grapefruit on a warm day and are looking for one with only natural flavors, this isn't a bad choice."
""

"Overall - A fair summer brew. The grapefruit doesn't quite shine in the way one might expect from the labeling, but it's presence is certainly not amiss. I'd drink this again if offered, but I don't think I'd buy it again."
""
""
""

"This is my go-to summer-evening-outdoors beverage."
"This really is the perfect summer beer. I found myself googling the 2013 in stores date in the winter. This is my favorite beer and if you have not had it yet then you are missing out. Most bars and grocery stores have it available from March - September so pick some up if you haven't already"
" The flavor has a slight grapefruit flavor with mild tangy citrus tinge and light rind taste with some mild nuttiness of malt, again it seems to follow the nose, not great but not altogether revolting it just is...slight grapefruit soda essence comes to mind, but not sweet and not really bitter either. The overall take is if you really love grapefruit you may dig this, but it is more of a novelty than a serious beer with grapefruit added."
""
"M: Light bodied."
""
""
""
"O: To me, this is a perfect example of a situational beer--and really, that's all you can expect from any sort of seasonal, let alone a summer seasonal. I found the beer very pleasant for a hot day out by the grill--it's tart and refreshing, the hint of spice went fine with our meats and grilled veggies, and the very light character went down really well. With the nice bright tartness, I didn't miss the hops or malt one bit. As long as you keep your beer cold (the experience went downhill considerably as my beer warmed up), it's a great light choice with some character. For any other day but a hot summer day, I'd give it somewhere in the high 2s, but for a hot summer day it got the job done and then some: 3.75."
""
"Overall: Refreshing, but more of a novelty. Drinks too carbonated, like a soda. Glad I only bought a single bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, while it tasted fine, it did not taste like beer. Shiner attempted to do something pretty interesting here, and while a crisp lager with notes of ginger and grapefruit still appeals to me, this unfortunately, is not that beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- While this isn't a bad tasting beer, it is not one I would try again."
""
"Refreshing, I guess. Totally one-note. Works like an alcoholic ginger ale. That's pretty more much it."
"Overall an easy-drinking and refreshing hot weather beer, although it doesn't taste quite like a traditional beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a lifeless deep gold bordering copper, no head or retention. Aroma of grated citrus peel and ginger, light malts. In the flavor, twangy ginger, yeast and sour citrus. Flaccid bitterness and bone dry. Over carbonated, too much grapefruit, not enough balance. Unless you love dry grapefruit juice, I'd select a different beer than this."
""
"RJT"
""
"Pours to a thin white head that falls to a tiny white ring that eventually fades and no lacing. Honey gold color. Aroma is ruby red grapefruit juice and ginger ale. Flavor is a burning acidic grapefruit and spicy ginger with not much else standing out. Mouthfeel is like ginger ale with a slight burning sensation and not like beer at all. Overall, what;'s the point? It's practically ""alcopop"" anyway. It was recommended by the store owner, but perhaps just to get rid of it?"
""
""
""
"O: Not a horrible beer but hardly a beer at the same time. Tastes like someone mixed a little ruby red grapefruit juice and ginger ale and called it good. Good summer beer, I guess. I'd rather an APA or a witbier or a saison, myself. This is more of a quasi-craft beer, IMO. Gateway beer. Not horrifying but nothing special."

"Lots of fruit with a citrus edge. The grapefruit taste is distinct without being very bitter. Actually, it doesn't taste anything like the grapefruit we say big hop IPAs taste like. Tangy ginger flavor gives this a spicy touch. Ginger ale, lemonade, and a Witbier taste. Thoroughly drinkable. From the 22 oz botle bought at Depot Liquor in Brownwood, Texas."

"O: perhaps its just not my cup of tea, and I do enjoy grapefruit juice, and i obviously enjoy beer, but this marriage didn't appeal to me."
"Imagine a ginger ale shandy, but drier, with a slice of grapefruit. Well-balanced but a little peculiar. Certainly refreshing, though I'd be at a loss what to pair it with."
""
""
"i like this beer a good bit and i am gonna pick up some more of it."
"It's a very pleasant and enjoyable beer. I wouldn't mind having a few of these while messing around in the shed in the back yard on a summer day."
""
"Pours a copper ale with brilliant clarity and no foam. Smells like sugar, some grapefruit (way too sweet), some pear and a little english malt. Pretty unimpressed so far. Tastes like a hot dog with some artificial sweetener and a little grapefruit - horrible. Thin with moderate carb and an off dry finish. That is a shitty beer."
""
"O: This 'beer' is really easy to drink, but it's not interesting enough for me to want more than one of these where I would call it sessionable."

"Overall a solid, enjoyable summer beer. Probably my go to beer for the summer. If you dont like this beer, then you dont like summer!"
"I like grapefruit and I taste it some IPA so when I saw this I had to try it. Its not an IPA but its good. hard to describe, similar to a Weiss Bier and fruity. Better than Shiner Bock. Low alcohol. easy to drink. This is good for a hot humid summer night. I just with the ABV was higher."
"I don't care what anyone says, this is a pretty good brew. far superior to the original shiner bock, and with a well executed twist of creativity that I find just right for warm weather sessioning. the appearance is nothing special, an understated pale ale color with a moderate but rapidly fading white head and very little visible carbonation. the nose has some fresh ginger and a medium American malt base. there is also some interesting citrus notes coming from this, I cant yet pick it out as grapefruit, but it absolutely smells thirst quenching. the flavor is sharp sweet red tangy grapefruit right up front. really fresh and tasty, with the ginger taking more of the spotlight towards the finish. a very refreshing beer indeed. only mildly acidic from the grapefruit, and very very light in body with dancing carbonation, this is a beer I could drink all day on the boat or at a picnic. its got that summery vie to it without using lemons or lager yeast or any of the usual suspects really. easily the best diner brew ive had, despite its mostly negative feedback here on BA. ill buy this again."

"Did I mention my new student, named ""Tawny""? What a great name, and I had a dense finger of tawny head with good retention following my pour. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. The nose was AMAZING - I caught an initial whiff of grapefruit, but then the ginger suddenly hit me in the sinus cavity! I actually sneezed in surprise. I am all for truth in advertising, but this was unexpected. The mouthfeel was medium, but it was abrasive in its flavor as I was basking in the ginger on the tongue. I still think that Clove Life Savers were the best I ever had as a kid and this reminded me of one of them. The tart of the grapefruit seemed to be lost until the swallow and its incredibly dry finish. No wonder this is a summer beer - it was like liquid alum. My throat constricted and I began to gasp for air. This wasn't dry, it was downright arid! Wow. I definitely want one at a more appropriate time of year."

"Big thanks goes out to Mississipping and StayWhatYouAre2’s dad for sharing this one at a tasting recently! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to none extremely quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, ginger, and rice. The flavor was of sweet malt, ginger, wheat, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty bad brew. I was wondering why their dad was laughing as he brought this one out from the garage fridge to share. He even got more of a kick when I went to smell it. This was definitely not what I was looking for when I came to this tasting. The ginger on this one was what made it so bad in my opinion. While I usually like ginger, this one presented it in a way that I did not enjoy at all. Definitely would make a rather amusing prank on someone if you feel the urge, so keep that in mind."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with amber hues and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by grapefruit. Taste is tart, grapefruit, a touch of malt, not terrible but not really my thing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is orange and brown in the glass. Soda pop carbonation that due palates hickory to nothing. Mouthfeel is also somewhat flat. Smell is not remarkable - smells like an ale with a hint of citrus. Grapefruit is present on the taste. It is upfront and provides a semi interesting twist to this beer. Probably it's best feature is the low ABV and sessionable nature. Best for a hot summer day served real cold."
""

"Good summer sipper, & this is my own bias but I'm very into ginger late so that maybe gives it an extra little boost for me right now. Half-soda, half-beer."

"Pours a clear golden with hints of orange. Non-existent head. Nice pickled ginger aroma. Taste begins with a big blast of ginger, followed by a bit of grapefruit sweetness. After that is a little bready maltiness. Very clean, neutral finish. Not bitter at all despite the grapefruit flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Overall a pretty good beer, light and refreshing."

"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of grapefruit, but my wife is. So, my review of this has this as a starting point. To start off, it had a nice looking color in the glass but not much in the way of head. You can definitely smell the ginger and grapefruit. It's a very interesting conversation. The taste is an interesting mix of grapefruit, ginger, and beer. I can't say that I preferred the taste, but my wife loved it."

"O/D-Ale brewed with ginger and grapefruit? About $6.75 a six-pack? I guess I'll give her a shot. Bad idea. My girlfriend loved it because it tasted so much like ginger ale. I hated it for the same reason. And boy, when this beer warmed, it really became frightening."

"Overall Drinkability: A fruit beer that actually tastes like beer."
"All in all my favorite summer beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark straw color with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of very light grain and a little citrus, but not that strong. Tastes of grain with citrus flavoring added, not that great. Beer is very smooth with its light body, but has a little too much carbonation. Overall, a very average beer."

"This is my favorite Shiner beer, but I also do like and drink grapefruit juice as well. Despite that fact, I was a bit apprehensive about ""beer and grapefruit"" but it was quite good. The amount and flavor of grapefruit was just right; not overbearing but enough to tell (without knowing the name) what fruit was included. Will definitely buy this again."

"I literally almost got into a row over the last 12 pack last fall, when me and this other guy came into the store at the same time, panicked that it was almost gone. We lamented that this beer is seasonal."
"It was enjoyable, seems to be a nice compliment to TexMex or other spicy foods. A good beer for a hot summer day."
""
"Good light summer beer. Has a nice grapefruit undertones. Nothing spectacular but good for what it is. I keep it out by the pool to enjoy on hot summer days in Houston. It is a bit thin, but part of the summer beer appeal. I drink it straight from the bottle so I can not comment on color or head."
""
"Pours a pretty clear, slightly reddish amber - no head, but that must have been an artifact of the pour. Malty aroma has a dusty tone, like powdered fruit drink. Malty flavor has a fruity undertone, apple and cherry with a hint of pear, and a subtle sour undertone. Texture has about average body and fizz. I didn’t seem to get any grapefruit, but this is a tasty and distinctive beer. Let it fly down your throat."
""
""
"I poured this seriously nasty brew into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The brew (and I'm calling that because its not beer) was slightly red/pinkish and poured a really weak head. It smelled like coca cola believe it or not and was just about as carbonated tasting. The taste was fruity/sour yuk!. I love Shiner Bock but I'll never put another of these up to my mouth."
""

"Another swing and miss by the Shiner folks. Not something I'd want to drink again, even on a hot day as the bottle suggests. No character."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad for what it is. Goes best with hot summer days."
""
"Mouthfeel: Redbird is a rather thin bodied easy drinking beer that I would have liked a lot more if it had a better flavor profile. This is a rather disappointing beer out of Shiner, TX."

"You know, this was interesting, and I'm still not convinced it's actually a beer, but if I were in Texas and it was like 120 degrees out, I bet it would go down easy. Maybe I'm feeling charitable, or I just like ginger ale, but as a mindless summer beer, this was all right."

""
"Overall this was a good, light, thirst quenching summertime beer. Definitely unique with the ginger/grapefruit combo. Wish I could take a growler of this to the pool, great outdoor/patio beer."
"This was more of a ginger beer than anything. I wish the grapefruit had been more bold. Probably won't have again."
""

"Low C"
""
"Overall – Very easy to drink on a warm summer day (which is how I had it). With the low abv and easy drinking style it makes for a good session beer."
""

"Beer shouldn't taste like grapefruit. It should be reclassified as cider or something. I'll never drink it again."

"overall, this is nice for a one-off. i don't think i'd ever get a 6-pk of this (though i did last year but only drank half), even though it's probably the most refreshing beer i've ever had. could use a bit more definition in the appearance, and the smell/taste may be fine where it is. it's pretty subtle for a grapefruit beer (expected it to be IN YOUR FACE)"

"Basically it has a light taste of ginger, fresh grapefruit, lemongrass and other citrus characteristics.It all comes together perfectly.To be honest with y'all,look at all the reviews on tap.Not many huh...but there aren't any bad ones.Where as the bottle has horrible reviews mixed in with OK(& great ones scattered around). Sounds like with the bottle of this beer sometimes there is too much carbonation and off tap that problem has not come up at Bombay bar.I have a 32oz bottle of this in my fridge right now but I'm leaving this review for the ""tap"" because it's simply better and every connoisseur ""knows this"".In my opinion if you thought it tasted like ""bad soda"" then I recommend you look up a bar in your area and ask if they have it on tap,guarantee that shit won't happen to you again."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours light clear caramel yellow wtih a quickly dissipating fizzy white head. No lacing is left behind. The bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass are plentiful. This is very carbonated. It reminded me of pouring a soda with how the carbonation rushed out of it. The aroma is very faint. I can pick up some ginger, though it's pretty faint. There is some wheat in the smell as well. For being a grapefruit flavored beer, I can't really pick that up much of it in the aroma. There flavor is slightly tart from the grapefruit and spicy from the ginger. The flavors of the wheat malt are overpowered here. The grapefruit isn't as forward as the ginger, which is a little overpowering. The excessive carbonation is prickly on the palate. The body is light and the carbonation, as noted, is intense. What should be an easy drinker is actually very difficult to consume. It reminds me of a soda in many ways, but a low quality one. Overall, this is easily one of the worst beers I've ever had. Plenty of other breweries have produced better fruit beer that embraces the fruit while not betraying the beer characteristics. Shiner gets a failing grade for this one."
""
"Ginger picks up in intensity with the flavor of Ruby Redbird. Spicy, crisp, and pickled. Grapefruit is an afterthought, and struggles to maintain relevance behind a drying cereal graininess in the finish. A bit too vegetal for my liking. Effervescent mouthfeel is thin and clean with a lingering sharpness from the ginger root. Overall, one of Spoetzl's more unique offerings. Definitely worth trying, if only for the novelty."
""
"Overall: Definitely more of a girl beer than guy. Light and simple, not bad, but I prefer the traditional bock if I'm going in the Shiner direction."
""
"O-If your are really hot and thirsty, you can pound these like water. Good beer for cutting grass. The fruity taste may appeal to women."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste of this beer is certainly a letdown, but I also have an issue with the appearance. It has very little carbonation and no head of foam, making it look more like a glass of tea than a serious malt beverage. This, coupled with the lack of much body or flavor, make Shiner Ruby Redbird a beer to avoid."

"Light amber color with a white head. Smells slightly citrusy, maybe some of the grapefruit coming though, but the ginger is much more prominent. Quite light overall. The flavor is quite heavy on the ginger, perhaps too much. A little bit of citrus, too. Quite refreshing, actually. Light body with medium carbonation."
""
""
"O - The fact this beer was brewed with grapefruit juice and ginger really jazzed me up for something exciting; refreshing delicious summer knock-around brew, but the flavor and feel were pretty lacking, unfortunately. Refreshing? Yeah, definitely. Will I pick up some more? Sadly, no."

"O: You may forget your drinking a beer here, though it keeps within the guidelines, low malt and low hop profile, clean yeast, with a forefront of the fruit/vegetable highlighted. Has no mention of alcohol, and drinks like a dream if you are a fan of grapefruit juice (of which I am). Labeled as a great summer time beverage, consumed cold on a hot day, hell I will go as far to say this is the ultimate breakfast beverage as you may not be able to tell this apart from virgin grapefruit juice. Overall as a beer would call this worthy per style, and a solid good rating if you’re a fan of grapefruit juice."

"Not very impressed with this outing from Spoetzl."
"O. Even though this brew has a verry strange flavor I liked it I would have to say it would be even better on a really hot summer day."
"Overall this beer serves it's purpose well. Very refreshing on a hot summer day or for grilling out."
"O: I'm kind of torn on how to wrap this up. When I break it apart into the above sections nothing really stands out as great, but overall I thought it worked in a weird way. Especially when this beer is served ice cold on a hot, humid, summer day (which was when I tried it). Sort of a polarizing beer, as opinions on it were divided right down the middle at the BBQ I had it at. But I'll definitely pick some up next summer to give it another shot."
"Overall, interesting, not bad, wouldn't drink more than one."
"All I really get is the ginger flavor. No sweetness or anything else appealing. I wouldn't get this again."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of ginger, pale malt, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of ginger, slight sweet malt, slight pale malt, and hint of citrus. Overall, session-able, not complex, and almost completely a ginger beer."
"Gets off to an unpromising start by topping its orangish golden body with a head as thin and short lived as soda fizz. Aromas are subdued to the point of barely existing. I get a whiff of something like sparkling mineral water, a hint a citrus, and light grains. The grapefruit is only slightly more prominent on the palate. Has flavors of light, nondescript grains, with a few drops of watery fruit punch, with nothing really popping or asserting its presence. I don't detect much in the way of ginger (which the label says it was brewed with). Easily my least favorite of the Shiner lineup."
"O: not a great effort. It could stand to be more flavorful and not quite as cloying."
"Overall: It's like someone combined citrus and a spicy ginger ale - if there is a beer in here it is well hidden. I can see the refreshing aspect to this beer though - especially when the beer is cold and crisp. Definitely would wake you up on a lethargic summer day. But perfect summer beer? No, not quite. Interesting to try but I can't see myself deliberately trying it again."
"EDIT: Based on having a second one out of the bottle whilst hot and sweaty, I've adjusted the scores slightly. Not good, but a bit better."
"O: An interesting beer, if not a good one. I didn't mind drinking it. I wouldn't have another, but I wouldn't say anything against ordering one."
"A very easy drinker, that exceeded my expectations, going down good on a ""cool"" 95 degree Oklahoma evening"
"It's not awful. It's at least different from most light, tasteless summer beers."
"O: Strangely not a horrible beer... I'm thinking I got a bad beer here... The tartness of the grapefruit was a little different from most fruit beers I've had."
"O: After a couple of drinks of Ruby Redbird, I thought to myself, ""Are Texans really drinking this shit?"" Honestly, the smell of freshly grated is such a tease when you follow it up with this beer. Gimmicky, one-trick pony. "
"Pours a light golden color with a minimal white head which dissipates almost instantly, no lacing what so ever, a stream of carbonation forms in the middle, nothing special. Smells are of ginger with hints of grapefruit. Feel is very light but perhaps what you'd expect with a summer beer. The taste is light of ginger with a little bread malts with a grapefruit after taste and not a good hoppy grapefruit, but a rancid rotten one which I hope doesn't linger much longer. Yeah its a summer beer, pretty light and maybe easy to drink (don't confuse with worthwhile to drink), but not at all to my taste. What a disappointment considering how much I love a good ginger beer (the non alcoholic stuff)."
"The taste is so similar to the smell and what I expected after taking a few whiffs. Ginger takes no. 1, grapefruit no.2, and for what Spoetzl intended, or at least what I think they intended, they hit the nail on this one. I love a good ginger ale, ginger beer...so I'm enjoying sipping and drinking this 4.01%abv concoction. I guess it *could* have been listed as one of them there malternatives but like I said it's doing okay for me and I do find it rather refreshing. My bucks wasted on a 6 pack? Nah."
"Pours dark orangish yellow with a foamy white head. The smell is tart, with a noticeable grapefruit smell, but not overwhelming. The taste in interesting, the citrus and grapefruit dominate, with the other beer qualities taking a back seat. The flavors are not as expected, but they do push the limits of fruit beers. This one had light carbonation and a decent mouthfeel. I do not think I would buy this again, the flavor just wasn't refreshing as I thought it would be."
"The basic malt and yeast of a beer are often lost beneath ginger ale elements in this brew, which may or may not be a problem for you depending upon what you are seeking from your bottle. An excellent thirst-quencher with nice flavor? It has you covered. A craft beer? Umm...not exactly."
"the label does say serve ice cold on a hot day...fair enough!!"
"Mouth is bordering thin but zippy carbonation makes it average. Glad I tried it, would only repeat on occasion."
"D; Nope."
"This was a decent beer. It had a strong grapefruit smell which is to be expected from a beer that hinges the flavor profile on the fruit. It often reminded me of Shiner's Hefeweizen, but that may have been due to the citrus notes. It was refreshing on a hot day and I would have it again, but I don't really see myself buying a six pack of it. Not great, not bad. A decent beer."
"I like you Shiner Ruby Redbird, but I don't love you."
"Good mouth feel, if not a little fizzy right? Better try a second to be absolutely sure."
"This is a confusing beer. It is crisp and refreshing, but just tastes out of balance. If they tweaked the recipe a bit, they might be on to something. For summertime concept fruit beers, I'd go with 21st Amendment Hell or High Watermelon or Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy. This is not a repeat buy for me, even though I give them credit for creativity."
"O: Thankfully this was a freebie. There are just so many good summer beers, I'm not sad that this one is available in a store near me. Avoid."
"Okay and great to drink in the summer. Not much of a beer though, more of a flavored malt beverage."
"Presentation: Packaged n a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard Pilsenerr glass."
"It's very refreshing but it barely feels like I'm drinking a beer. I think I could get something very similar by mixing ginger ale and grapefruit juice. It's very refreshing and good for the summertime heat, but it needs to look and feel like a beer."
"Drinkability - these are good. I think pounding through them short-circuits the mild but interesting flavors, yet they are easy to drink down. Toasting this one to my in-laws down in Katy, dodging firestorms tonight. Be safe folks, and to all my Lone Star pals down there, too. Safe home."
"I sampled this beer fairly warm, and I wonder what it would be like ice-cold on a sunny day while cooking outdoors. The cold might make it seem a little more spicy and gingery. And it would cover up the malt a bit more... it's almost not a ""beer"". But OK, it's at least refreshing, and a touch interesting. It's not a beer that I'd immediately reach for or buy again, but I can think of quite a few mainstream American lagers and/or light beers that I'd pass over for this one. I'm not sure I can give this one a ""worth trying", but that wouldn't be the worst thing you could do."
"This beer pours a clear amber color with no head whatsoever. The aroma is strong with Ginger and grapefruit. The taste is similar to a Ginger ale and not much else. The mouthfeel is overcarbonated and dry. Overall an interesting idea for a beer style, but poorly executed."
"This has to be the worst beer I have ever had and I've had some bad ones."
"Love the flavor combination in theory, but this wasn't for me (the wife enjoyed it, though). Tasted like flat ginger ale and dish soap."
"The body was very thin and just a little sticky. Drinkability was OK, but with the beer being so blah, why would you several? Overall, nothing special. Try it if you like grapefruit, otherwise drink something else."
"O: While not a completely horrid beer, it certainly doesn't stick in your mind after you've finished it."
"O: Not on par with last two Shiner seasonals (Winter Warmer & Dortmunder). I worry that I may have gotten a bad bottle from an HEB make your own 6 pack. But no skunk or oxidation symptoms. I totally missed the Munich malt and the Mt. Hood & Cascade hops mentioned on the back label."
"O: Can't recommend this one at all. I don't know what Shiner was thinking. Smokehaus was leaps better than this."
"O: Drink one (or two) after mowing your lawn."
"DON'T GET THIS BEER! If this was the last beer on Earth I'd refuse it. Thankfully I chose not to finish the whole thing."
"Thanks Dave."
"O/D: This beer may not be for everyone, but it's an interesting and I think enjoyable combination of grapefruit and ginger. Better than expected."
"Can you say chick-beer? Give this a pass, unless slightly flavored soda water is your idea of a beer."
"Another oddly spiced seasonal from Shiner. The ginger overwhelms, in fact it could be mistaken for a ginger ale soda, only not as good."
"O- Refreshing summer beer. Pretty decent, I guess. I like the hints of grapefruit throughout."
"Taste-Faint malt note, thin bodied, almost watery. Muted grapefruit flavor. A bit of a letdown to be sure. I had high hopes for this one on a 90 degree day but it was not to be. But hey, a little more carbonation and body to fill this beer out and we could be talking a great summer brew here. But until then, my score must stand. C'mon Shiner!"
"overall: without a doubt the best thing from shiner. pretty damn good on top of that!"
"O) Pretty good on a hot and humid summer day. This beer is certainly not for everyone, but I think Shiner hit the target they were aiming for."
"O - Not a huge ginger fan. I need it toned down and the grapefruit cranked up."
"Overall - well, it's an interesting beer, but I can't say that I love the taste. It's not bad, it just tastes more like a ginger ale soda than a beer."
"Well, if nothing else this is sure to be interesting. This one pours out an orange-gold color with a tiny head, no lace. Smells a touch like sugar-sweet ginger ale, with just a touch of maltiness. The taste is a lot like ginger ale, with some sweet red grapefruit on the back. The taste is nice, the ginger and grapefruit are really up front, with just a little bit of nutty malt on the very backend. A very drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is light and carbonated. This is a pretty solid summer brew that's quite unique."
"Overall: Does not taste like beer and is quite dangerous in that respect. Though the alcohol content is fairly low, it drinks like a good ginger beer and, thus, can lead to unexpected intoxication. It's great as a thirst quencher and balances ginger bite, sweetness and bitterness well enough to be quite effective as a session beer. Except that 4%ABV is sneaky."
"O - While this isn't the first beer I'd grad its still a decent midday beer for a summer day if you like ginger ale then chances are you'll like this one"
"Overall: I think this is one of those beers where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is a different, enjoyable summer beer, very refreshing after a hot day. While I think the grapefruit and ginger flavors could be more pronounced, I enjoyed this."
"Drinkability is average. I could drink 2 maybe 3, but I wouldn't finish off the 6-pack."
"This is a gimmick beer at best...brewed for people who miss Zima or do not even like to drink beer. I'm upset I bought a sixer...wish i'd only bought a single."
"I guess this is what shiner replaced their Smokehaus (RIP) beer with. Smells quite a bit like grapefruit and a hint of ginger. I disagree with other reviewers on here that say the ginger is overpowering, I think it works fine. It doesn't suffer from the obnoxious sweetness that plagues a lot of the fruity beers I've tried. Fairly refreshing. I will miss the Smokehaus though (~~RIP~~)"
"Overall: This beer might be a little too gimmicky to work well. The ginger flavor is unappealing and completely overpowers whatever else might have been in this beer. The grapefruit might've worked on its own if it had been allowed to. Unfortunately, the ginger and grapefruit also take away from this beer's drinkability, dooming it as an effective summer seasonal. Skip this one..."
"This is why I try new beers...even when it's Shiner. I really like this beer. I smell and taste more rosemary than grapefruit, but I can pick out the grapefruit. Either flavor is a bit much on the tongue. Golden in color with, as George would say, ""...a pinkish hue."" Plenty of carbon dioxide, but not much of a head. Zero head, as a matter of fact. Put it in a can, and it'll be my new fishin' beer. Ooooh, I almost forgot, it's got a tangy finish. Genuinely tangy, but not Tang. That would be gross."
"O: Pretty one-dimensional; actually two - ginger and grapefruit. Easy to drink, but why why?"
"I like this brew, it is true to a summer beer for us in the extreme heat. Bravo Spoetzl we love your stuff here in south carolina."
"Overall: Maybe the ladies will like it. I was considering waking up the girlfriend for a sniff and taste (of the beer, you horrible monsters), but I can already hear the ""you woke me up to try some goofy beer?!"" rant, so I'll bypass that headache. Me, I was not a fan of this, but I didn't get too angry about it. That'd be like getting angry at a can of Vernors."
"Poured into a pint glass, i got a thick bubbly head that quickly dissipated and was left with no head at all. There are strong apple, orange and pear aromas that are very pleasing to the nose. Its crystal clear with very little carbonation and is a dark golden/blonde color. Its light bodied with strong citrus flavors (grapefruit and orange mainly) and is tart overall. There’s no alcohol taste at any point when you drink this beer."
"EDIT (10/23/11) : After this long long HOT HOT HOT and DRY summer, it seemd that I could not get enough of this one. Ice cold on a hot days straight out of the bottle, went down several 12 packs."
"A very average beer. Shiner has one really good beer in their line-up: Holiday Cheer. I was hoping for this one to show off Texas grapefruit like the Cheer does Texas peaches, but this is another forgettable beer from the ""little"" brewery in Spoetzl."
"I applaud the brewery's continued efforts to add more beers to their line up. Shiner is a trusted TX brand and these excursions help turn people on to drinking better beer and to not fear exploration. But this one I will not be purchasing again. Can't win 'em all!"
"O - Ruby Redbird is a fairly good at what it does: refresh. If you enjoy a lighter beer on a hot summer day, this is a nice change of pace. Plenty of flavor, but anyone that doesn't care for ginger should steer clear."
"i love ipa etc but this is something different and i'm so glad shiner did it. totally makes up for the smokehaus! i knew you had it in you shiner - now keep it up - GO CRAZY!!!"
"This is the first time I've ever seen this in stores, I wonder if I've just missed it the past few years or if it's really that new? Anyway, I had to try it, being a big fan of regular shiner and their bohemian black. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect, I read other people's reviews that said the ginger is overwhelming, not for me, it's barely there. The grapefruit comes through the most, and honestly it's hard to tell this is a beer. It's quite refreshing and the ABV is low enough that the citrus tastes pretty much drowns tasting any alcohol. The only thing about this beer that isn't superb is the aftertaste... grapefruit always did have an odd aftertaste and it comes through in this. You know the pine-y aftertaste you get from a really deep IPA? Have you ever tried grapefruit seed extract? It's pretty similar. This beer has a pretty heavy, not particularly pleasant aftertaste. It's not horrible, but it caught me off guard. Overall, I like it, it's something new and different and definitely fits the season."
"The one saving grace is, it may make a perfect base for mixing. Grab some dark rum and use it to make a Dark and Stormy and thank me later. Really disappointing, by far the worst Shiner offering to date."
"The beer was a golden amber color with a white soapsy head that disappeared quickly. The smell is mostly ginger with grapefruit backing it up and a hint of citrus peel. The taste is dominated by ginger, it's tart and a bit sour, the aftertaste is grapefruit rind. The beer is very light and spritzy with attacking carbontaion and a nice dry finish. This beer kind of shocked me coming from Shiner, most of there beers are plain and similar but this is very different, but good."
"Then I smelled it... and I should have stopped right there, soapy ginger smell, kinda like pickled ginger but more unpleasant. Tasted even worse to me, overwhelmingly ginger flavored with a bad almost stale beer undertone. I couldn't get past my 2nd sip. Maybe this is right to its style, if there even is such thing, but it sure isn't for me. I have no clue what I'll do with the remaining 5 bottles, too bad, I like most of their other offerings"
"My wife picked up a six pack of this one earlier today, and temptation got the best of me. Poured a translucent amber color with an instantly disappearing tan head. Aromas of tart grapefruit, lemon zest and tea. Light bodied and crackly, with flavors of grapefruit, lemon zest and a little ginger."
"Overall: This would be a great session beer for me. I love the taste, it's refreshing, and it's crisp. It would be nice if it had a bit more complexity but overall I enjoyed it very much."
"Strong smell of grapefruit and ginger. Called the perfect summer beer but I have had many that were better. I generally prefer dark beer and reds but this red didn't work. Taste was unpleasant and fruit overpowered the beer. Bad aftertaste. Prefer regular Shiner to this. Not for me and I like just about any beer.."
"I'm always interested to see what Shiner come up with - sometimes it's a winner, sometimes not. I go with thumbs up for this one."
"The beer pours a clear golden-orange color with a white head. The first thing I get in the aroma is some ginger, but I then get some grapefruit notes. The flavor is more of the same. I get some slightly tart grapefruit, ginger and bready malt. Refreshing. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a great beer, but this is better than some other Shiner beers."
"In six years on BA I have never rated a beer an F. Unfortunately, that string is now broken."
"its a good summer beer from what I've had, grant it I haven't had too many grapefruit beers. Overall, I enjoyed it."
"O- I expected to really like a grapefruit and ginger flavored beer, but I wasn't expecting to be super impressed with a Shiner beer. So I think this met those combined expectations. I like the ginger smell, but the taste is a little too watery."
"O: overall i think this is a pretty good beer. it would be perfect for lounging at the pool here in phoenix. This is intended as a summer seasonal, and i think it fits that pretty well. It is thin and refreshing. i dont think i would buy this at the bar, but i would buy a six pack for my next pool party."
"O - I've never had a grapefruit beer before. The concept is interesting. Did Shiner deliver? Certainly in flavor. Some areas were lacking IMO, but I did enjoy."
"Overall Drinkability - This beer has no redeeming value. It is among the most bland beers I've ever had. Basically a michelob ultra with a worse mouthfeel."
"Overall: Ok, I'm a bit of a fanboy for Shiner, but I could see picking up another 6er of this for a Summer sipper, and one I could see offering to guests. Walks a crazy line, but glad to see Shiner willing to take some risks."
"Opinions are mixed though. Some people really love it, and some like myself feel let down. All in all, I'd at least say give it a try and reach your own opinion."
"Taste is out there, that is for sure. More depth than a ginger beer, but the asian root still dominates for the most part. The grapefruit is a nice addition and the malts are kept light and grainy. Hops are low-key but the bitterness is not really missed with the zesty grapefruit and ginger. If it were my recipe, I would dial down the ginger and dry hop it with lots more amarillo and citra. Having said that, I am really enjoying this seasonal offering and am already on my 3rd sixer of it. It is a very good, refreshing summer beer to go with the hot, humid dog days of summer soon to be here. Say what you will about Shiner’s regular lineup, but their seasonals have been innovative and for the most part quite good."
"overall this might be the worst thing i have ever drank called beer - i got more beer flavor from bud select 55"
"O: Call me crazy, but for a summer seasonal beer, this is pretty good. But I do love ginger ale, so I may be biased here. It's light, refreshing, easy drinking, and not overbearing. A great summer session beer."
"Overall I'm not very impressed, but to some that enjoy their beers brewed with fruit, it could be acceptable."
"When I last visited Sea World several years back (before I really knew much about beer besides that I did not like BMCs) I went to their Anheuser-Busch beer school and learned that beer is made of barley, water *rice? and hops. I'm a little shocked they still use hops. But that's another story. After the beer school they gave us free samples. They were trying out beer infused with fruit (this was before the BL Lime and Miller Chill crap) and they literally poured a Mich Ultra and mixed it with cherry (or whatever) syrup. It was God-awful. My point is that this beer is the closest thing I've tasted to that, since. It should be noted I've never tried BL lime. I was hoping for a light, slightly fruity nod to the IPA bitterness that can taste grapfruity. As a Texas beer drinker I'm also always in Shiner's corner, morally speaking. But this beer was so bad. So bad."
"Taste is overwhelming. Burst of ginger (not fresh tasting) up front and subtle notes of grapefruit. I would have probably stuck with just the grapefruit without the ginger, but it is not awful. A bit of a dish soap taste to it though."
"god help me, i love this beer!!! .. Pours a light ruby tan, low foam .. . light aroma of ginger, grapefruit (weird right?) .. . taste is light grapefruit, and ginger, but i don't like ginger.. what the hell is going on?? this is fantastic!! all i can do is picture cases of this, stacked-chilled and by a pool! .. i can say that the new brewmaster at Spoetzl is really starting to stamp his name on what i thought was a shit brewery- could this be my turning point with Shiner, ..again ... I will be buying more of this... . Someone somewhere wants me crazy"
"I really don't like or understand these novelty beers that have no direction or purpose."
"The mouthfeel is that of a smooth adjunct lager. Highly drinkable. Not over carbonated. This stuff goes down quickly and I've already finished my second in half an hour. Just plain interesting stuff."
"Overall this is a good beer. Not great, but enough to keep me happy during ahot summer day. Well done shiner!"
"I could see how a combination of Ruby red grapefruit and ginger could make for a very nice summer beer. I imagined it in a well-made wheat or Kolsch with at least some quality and body to it. But for me, this was not it."
"Overall: This ain't your normal glass of beer. It's pretty out there, and definitely the most adventurous Shiner brew that I've ever had. It's nice to have a citrusy beer that doesn't taste like chemicals and failure (Bud Light Lime, anyone?) The bottle brags that it's the ""Perfect Summer Beer", and it might be right. I think it would also pair pretty well with asian or asian fusion dishes. It would be especially good with sushi. I'm sure a lot of BeerAdvocate users are going to give this beer poor reviews (""WHY DOES IT NOT REEK OF HOPS?!?!?", they'll scream), because they seem to love rating beers without regard for their intended drinking context. But if you're looking for an unpretentious, unusual session beer - give this a shot."
