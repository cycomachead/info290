"L: beautiful purpley-rusty-red, two-finger, fluffy head that dissipates to thin lacing. S: juicy, tart raspberries, slight scent of biscuits. T: just like the nose - juicy, sweet, tart raspberries; jammy, but not overly cooked; a little biscuity; very much like a baked raspberry tart. Delicious, but a bit sweeter than I like."

"750ml bottle poured into champagne flutes. Dark red opaque body with a finger of red-brown head. Aroma is fresh raspberries, raspberry coulis, tart raspberry. Taste is briefly tart then a rush of sweetness comes in. Some light grainy maltiness on the swallow. Light body, thicker silky texture that is nicely offset by the spritzy carbonation, sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep ruby red, looks like a raspberry puree. Smells like fresh raspberries you can tell it's going to be tart right away. Fruity citric acid makes you pucker up but in a good way. Tastes more like a fruit juice than a beer. Desert drink rather than an everyday beverage."

"was really looking forward to drinking this one after trying the belgian red, and was not nearly as satisfied with it. very sweet, rasberry flavor just doesnt seem to work as well as the cherry did in the belgian red. was hoping for some tartness that wasnt there, just fruity sweetness. not a terrible beer, just not what i was hoping for"
""
"Overall: Some argue that this brew is not supposed to be sour (which it def is not sour what so ever), but the they call it a framboise (lambic) and traditionally the style is a little funky or sour. This was only fruit syrup tasting. So incredibly sweet."

"O: Extremely refreshing and drinkable"

"FWIW, it would be helpful for beer drinkers to log flaws.   That would help establish patterns among producers/distribution chains.."
""
""
"This has an enormous raspberry nose. After the pour I can smell raspberries with the glass sitting on the table a couple of feet away. It pours a raspberry red with a quickly dissipating pink tinted white cap. The palate is all raspberries with the light malt way in the background, starting with a light sweetness and the finishing lemony tart. The texture is very foamy - its highly carbonated but it is not harsh. It is just on the edge of Bartle's and James territory but it manages to step back from the precipice of falling into raspberry soda territory."
""
"Way to sweet.  Like drinking the syrup for a snow cone.  I have no idea how this is so highly rated"
""
"Deserves it rating. Outstanding, but of a particular niche. Doesn't really register as beer at all; drinks more like a cider, or even just fruit juice. The alcohol's so low it's practically invisible. Perfect fare for a picnic, or a kid's birthday party. If in the mood, it's heaven. But you gotta be in the mood."
""
""
""
"Tastes like real fresh raspberries, not raspberry candy like Rubaeus or rasberry cough syrup like Raspberry Eisbock. Once I got past the fact that it tastes nothing like beer, it was very enjoyable. Very sweet but with enough sour to balance. If someone told me it was raspberry soda I'd have believed them."
""
"Extremely carbonated, overly fruity, and lower than desired alcohol content.  Overall this was underwhelming"
"Similar to Strawberry Rhubarb, I just don't get the hype around this beer. Overly sweet, not much tart and very syrupy. Not my style of beer, just feel like sugar overtook any other flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall--This lacks any of the beer characteristics of their Apple Ale; this is more like a soda, or a raspberry wine.  I am not likely to purchase this again, as it does not remind me of an ale whatsoever."
"A bit sweet for me but has delicious raspberry flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm almost sorry I gave myself time to appraise this thing. Once you taste it, it's a slippery slope to chugging it. It's not a 'thinking' beer, but in its simplicity there is greatness."
""
"Pours a deep, deep ruby red with a pink laced healthy head. The moment you open this bottle the raspberry scent wafts across. The taste lives up to the nose here - somehow the tartness does not overpower the sweetness here or vice versa. I get no sour feel here - this is a pure dessert beer. Somehow the mouthfeel and lasting taste here give the sense that you have been drinking a squeezed/pressed bagful of freshly picked raspberries."

"While this beer leans toward the sweet side, there's plenty of acidity from the berries to provide a mouth puckering pop. Pours with a creamy khaki colored head that produces lots of wispy lace. Plenty of raspberry aroma with a bit of grain in the background. Tart to start, leading to a sweet, but not cloying middle and finish. Big raspberry flavor predominates. Clean fruit finish with no bitterness. Medium light body and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"best of the NG fruits i have had so far... trying Peach soon"
""
""
"Raspberries galore in this beer. Smells of the delectable berry with a touch of toast in the background from the malt. Tastes like raspberry cobbler with an initial rush of berry sweetness that's quickly overcome by slight sour puckering and just when you think the beer is becoming too sweet the malt & hop make their grand beer saving entrance and balances everything out. Finishes slick and wet leaving my palate craving for the next sip. Outstanding from the masters of fruit beers"

"To me This tasted much more like a cocktail then a beer. all i really got in the taste was an overly sweet taste that to me was more reminiscent of a raspberry syrup then fresh raspberries.  i got no tartness or malt balance whatsoever."

"Poured a rich reddish brown color with a short tannish/pink head.  The nose and taste of this beer is fantastic and mouthwatering.  There is some toasted malt and bread in there, but the raspberries are truly the star and dominate all aspects of the brew.  There is a hint of acid and some mild hop spiciness to counterbalance some of the sweetness.  The fruit is the true star and this beer is just dripping overripe, luscious raspberries."

"Ugh! Been really looking forward to trying this and I'm pretty sure I got a dud. When poured into the glass it has a very nice looking head that was very thick. Then after inspecting the beer I didn't notice a jewel like sparkle and my nose detected a very acidulous smell. The brew poured very brown and muted looking in color. After the first sip it was obvious that the beer was off. Lots of vinegar and a very acidic burn down the throat. Barely any berries to speak of and just a huge disappointment. I'd love to try it again, but not for $20.00."

"After reading all of the reviews, I was expecting amazingness.  This beer just didn't do it for me.  It was so incredibly sweet, and not in a good way.... it burned the back of my throat.  There was absolutely nothing to balance out the sweetness either.... this was as sweet as Sunny Delight, and I can't stand Sunny Delight."

"O - Usually buy as many as I can when the opportunity presents itself. Also, New Glarus may be the best run business/brewery on their scale... even though they are in the land of Packer nation... everything from their outside area, copper kettles, sanitation. A place for other breweries to learn from for sure."

" Overall: I am blow away by this brew. I've traveled with it for about a month and there is no telling how old it is but it taste so fresh and bright. The framboise body alone would be a world class beer but the fresh berry notes push it to legendary. Bright, fresh, delicate, and artfully brewed. I would feel bad drinking this every night because it's so good it demands to be consumed after a world class meal  or something of that caliber. This beer is outstanding and is well worth the pain of getting it (trust me I had some pains getting it). Get your hands on this beer"

"Stored colder than my beer fridge and poured into champagne flutes.  Effervescent with a thick head that dissipates quickly.  Great lacing and slight head retention.  Clear, but dark red.  Not that it needs mentioning, but fruity aromas and sweet, light crisp taste with a tart finish.  An easy drinker and pairs perfectly with brunch!  Will definitely revisit this classic."

"Poured into a wine glass. A healthy head develops atop a rose colored brew. Scent of berries is pleasant, not overpowering. Tastes to me exactly like whole wheat toast with butter and raspberry jam; not the ""tart"" I was expecting but I can't say I was disappointed by that. Medium bodied and smooth. I could drink this all night."

"Lovely ruby-purple color. The nose is red fruit and sugar. Starts off a bit tart like an underripe raspberry and then rounds out to a sticky, heavy raspberry sweetness. Light enough to drink all night long. This is probably my favorite from New Glarus to date. Perfect summer drinking."

"Pours a cloudy, red/brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-pink color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong and fresh raspberries, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight tartness and slight dryness. Tastes of fresh raspberries, hint of hops, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, the aroma and body of the raspberries is amazing. The freshness is akin the Samuel Smith's Raspberry, but the blend is even better. It tastes of more than pure raspberry juice; tart, slightly hoppy, and irresistible."

"Enjoyed the beer poured very well chilled from a 750ml into a large goblet. Beautiful copper color with a nice fruit aroma with minimal head. Has a very nice balance of fairly slightly sour (tart) and sweetness from the raspberry. Definitely a beer to be enjoyed on a hot summer day."

"Overall: a wonderfully refreshing beer. I just tried my first new glarus beer this week and I already can't get enough. This one is easily the best purely fruity beer I have had. Although I don't think it's perfect, there isn't much to change to get it there"
"It poured a ruddy reddish-amber with great foam. The aroma just pops with a fresh berry punch. It’s the same on the palate, tart and crisp and wildly vibrant. Pucker up and enjoy it. A real treat for this reviewer."

"This beer is delicious. The fruit is impeccable. It was very refreshing as well. My only criticism is it's overly sweet after a few sips. If this beer had a bit more alcohol I feel it would be more balanced. I enjoyed it a bit better after mixing in a bit of a different ale to cut down the sweetness."

"New Glarus nailed it with the raspberries. The beer was one dimensional, but it's an extremely well made and delicious one dimensional beer. If you don't like the taste the raspberries, better stay clear of this beer. If you like well made lightly tart fruit beers, you better make a run for the Wisconsin border and pick yourself up a bottle. This beer kind of makes me wish that I lived in Wisconsin. Big thanks to mnbuffalo for hooking me up!"

"I'm gonna keep this one short and sweet. If you liked Serendipity or Strawberry Rhubarb, you'll love this. As the name describes, this is a very raspberry taste, with lots of sweetness and a deliciously tart finish. Has just enough carbonation to give it an effervescent feel; just awesome."
""
""
"Wow!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What separates this from the average Lindemans offering? The use of real fruit! It barely tastes ""candied"" like the former, and it is simply true joy in terms of maintaining a refreshing and flavorful atmosphere. I'd like a case of this please. If anyone is going to make non-funky, non-soured fruit beers the right way, it will always be New Glarus. This is a prime example of what they do best."

"Hazy dark red burgundy with a small creamy rose head. Aroma is red fruit, raspberry and some sea-like. Flavor is deep sour raspberry, very intense with some lemony notes, and a fruity, acid aftertaste, very nice. Medium palate, start filling but ends dry, complex, refreshing and very drinkable."
"750ml bottle. Served in Teku glass. Pours dark, brownish red. Big fizzy off-white head. Strong aroma of raspberries. Actually like a raspberry Pixie stick. Very inviting. Flavor is tart raspberries, apple juice, grapes and slight vinegar notes. Light with moderate carbonation. Super sweet. Not very complex but a great fruit beer."
"A very tasty beer - very well produced. It is very natural - I don't get the typical adjunct/artificial taste like some other fruit based beers. Hats off to New Glarus!"

""
"Thanks Atoneworks for this amazing beer! Pours a hazy ruby color with a large head that dissipated fast, but did leave a solid finger of thick foam atop the beer. No lacing. The nose can be described in one word: raspberries. The taste isn't very far removed from the nose: raspberries, sweet at first and finishing tart, almost sour. Light bodied with light carbonation. Overall, this is an extremely well crafted beer that is highly drinkable. Balanced, this beer is neither cloying sweet nor mouth puckering sour, it is highly drinkable and quite refreshing. Outstanding job, New Glarus!"

"EDIT - Tried this one again. Super pleasant beer that tastes great and is very smooth and refreshing. I would increase the appearance, taste, and overall by .25-.5 points each. I would give it a 3.9 rating today."

"Let’s face it, this is about as good of a fruit beer as you can get with only the current defunct Belgian Red to rival it. This pours a cloudy, reddish color with a fizzy light pink head. The aroma erupts with the scent of sweet raspberries. The taste is amazing with sweet delicious raspberries. Only downside is that you really do need a drinking buddy otherwise 1 bottle is way too much sweetness for 1 person alone."

"Since the wife likes Frambois and many other fruit beers, I have gone out of my way to try to find beer she can appreciate as much as I do. So, we took a trip up to WI to pick up some NG stuff for both of us. Well worth the quick trip from Chicago. Lived up to the hype"

"Raspberries and a light touch of oak. Some things are more complicated than they need to be. New Glarus' Raspberry Tart isn't one of these things. This brew is bursting with fresh berry flavors with a dry tannin kick that both the berries and the oak help contribute to. It's sweet at first, but nicely tart at the end."

"O) My personal favorite Fruit Beer from New Glarus, and they've got quite a few top notch options, so that's saying something."

"Overall: Really interesting, really enjoyable beer to drink. While I can't say I'm a fruit beer expert, this was really excellently put together and at no point seemed sickeningly sweet, which was my worry before trying it."

"Definitely one of the better fruit beers I've had. I don't think I liked this as much as New Glarus's Apple Ale or Serendipity, but it was still damn good. I prefer this one to Founder's Rübæus just by a little bit. It's a touch more succulent, juicy, and ""fresh", though both beers are nice takes on the raspberry-centric ale. I'd be dropping 10$ for a bomber of this all the time if it were available in my area."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - New Glarus really impresses me with these fruit beers. This is just the most honestly raspberry forward thing I've have ever had that wasn't an actual raspberry. Not as exciting as Serendipity but just as wonderful as the Belgian Red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer and I miss ya, girl, but lets be real: I'm wearing my shoes when I walk inside the house."
""
"This beer really tastes like a raspberry tart. Unlike something like Lindemanns Frambois, this one still tastes like a beer and the hops and malts do come through. Great dessert beer."
"Overall- This is such a unique beer. I'm glad I finally got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer wow'd me and was my first introduction to a real fruit beer. Quite one dimensional, but that doesn't detract at all from its masterfully crafted beauty."
""
"Bottle from a friend in Wisconsin. Wax top 750 ml. Pours a deep dark red with a big creamy pink head. Cool look. Aroma is amazing. Fresh raspberries and more fresh raspberries. More sweet than tart aroma. Wow! Tart up front quickly fades into sweet raspberries that sit and linger on the palate. Tart comes back with another sip. Oh man this is awesome. Some oak dryness and ever so slight bitter keep this from being too sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel--expected lighter--with no hint of alcohol (pretty low anyway). This is pretty awesome."

"best fruit beer i've ever had. the raspberry flavor is powerful, but not overwhelming. Firm tartness. Light and crisp. Moderate/high carbonation and extremely light on the palate. The fruit flavor is the star of the show. Nice color as well, bright red."

"O: very creative well balanced framboise. Perfect for a hot summer day."
""
""
"D: I feel like this is a beer all in its own league. not really a fruit beer, but not really a framboise. certainly has elements of both, but hard to pick a way it is leaning towards more. regardless, very tasty stuff here from New Glarus. refreshing, yet tart and assertive. i would even take more tart and less sweet."
""
"O: Dan Carry really does magical things with sour/wild beers. I know many beer nerds that say they don't like sours but like any other style you need to have a good example.. this is a great place to start."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While I like this a bit better than Wisconsin Belgian Red, it's still a bit too syrupy-sweet for me, especially for being called ""Raspberry Tart."""
"Was somewhat underwhelmed by this beer. Had it at a bottle-share and loved it, so I traded for it in order to try again. Second time around, was just not happy. Way too sour/vinegary, with little to no raspberry (tart) sweetness. Would like to try one more time just to see if I got a bad batch, otherwise I'll pass on this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid fruit beer, the raspberry aroma and flavor and the tartness are really nice, but it loses a few points with me just on sweetness."

"O- This was my favorite of the NG fruit beers besides the apple. I thought it was good, but a little bit too much on the sweet side. I do think having this in my cellar for a few months did help tone the sweetness down a little bit however it was still a little bit too much for my liking. To my liking I could picture this being a little bit better with a year on it (some people might not agree though). Overall I thought it was decent but not something I would seek out again, I can see how a lot of people really like this beer though."

""
""

"For the style absolutely one of the best. Really walks a line of fruit beer and wild ale."

"a very special beer. used this instead of champaigne last night to bring in the new year. thanks to my girlfriend for hooking this up for me! the much anticipated pour was a red tainted pale brown color, mostly clear, with a ton of rising bubbles and a persistent finger or two of fizz. the nose takes you by surprise. its potently fresh raspberries, juicy and lush and overripe. there is also a medium toast malt underneath that gives this one a little more substance than perhaps the belgian red has, which i certianly appreciate. flavor too is heavenly raspberries, this brings me to late summer in the woods picking huge berries and stuffing my face growing up. some tartish yeast in here too adds a slight puckery element to balance the sweetness of the fruit. finish is perfect mix of sweet and tart, with sweet probably just getting the edge. the feel was interesting. its insanely carbonated, much like the champaigne we were replacing with this brew. body is light but not too too light, and the alcohol is of course super low, but to me this wasnt super drinkable. i think the sweetness combined with all the bubbles made it more of a slow sipper, and when we finished the bottle, i had definitely had enough of this. that said though, this is a rare treat to be savored and shared. new glarus has now given me two of the best fruit beers in the known world, so thanks for that!"
""
""
""
"My wife and I actually prefer this to the New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red. I think it's probably the edgy tartness that does it for us. This is an amazing beer full of flavor, tartness, and sweetness."
""
"New Glarus really nails this style, in a big way."
"overall this is a delicious beer."
"High B"
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark amber color with a good, creamy cap. Nice raspberry aroma! And really good flavor. I really like that this is only 4% as I am able to enjoy a lot of it without filling up or getting too buzzed. It’s oh-so drinkable with its really nice raspberry flavor, held up with adequate malt. Good body/carbonation. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall:A good but not overpowering raspberry beer with loads of natural flavors. I would get this again if I wanted a raspberry beer. I was blown away by Wisconsin Belgian Red and while good, I did not get nearly the same feelings from this one."

"Raspberry Tart is a red looking beer, it is on the blood red side of things, not very bright looking. Small amounts of bubbles on top that led to nothing although I think there were some problems with the lines. No lace on the sides going down, swirls brought up. Scent is raspberry to the max, I mean raspberry. It seeps out, with some faint chocolate, vanilla, but mostly raspberry, maybe some malt, it's there somewhere. This is a sweet desert beer and I see it going well with ice cream, possibly a float. Raspberry, vanilla, sweet malt, bordering on cloying, yet a nice tart hit towards the back keeping the balance. Body is quite creamy, tart and stealth for a 4% beer. Tangy delicious and something for the ladies, and gentlemen."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is about the 5th time that i've had the pleasure to enjoy a glass of Raspberry Tart. And quite frankly, the experience hasn't changed, it's an truly amazing beer, its perfectly balanced and one of the first world class beers i've ever had. It's fresh raspberry aroma and taste are insanely balanced and it's awesome to think that a beer can contain flavors like this. One of my favorite beers of all time. New Glarus knows how to do their fruit beers and they know how to do them well.."
""
"O- this is a delicious beer, I saved this one for months as my desert beer for Thanksgiving and it was worth it, not one you want to drink regularly but this is a great special occasion beer"
""
""
""
""
"750mL. Pour is perfect- a clear jewel black ruby with a massive pinkish beige head. Huge retention and wispy, gorgeous delicate lace abounds across the raster tulip. Nose is seedy raspberry smoothie. Taste....wow. So much lactic sourness, seedy raspberry, sweet raspberry smoothie. Palate is ultra silky with a long lactic finish. Mild spice and sharp sting. Perfect blend of sweet and sour. Incredible raspberry character. Impossible for any organic lifeform to not thoroughly enjoy this. Whoa. 11/9/2011 8/5/9/5/17=4.4"
""
""
""
"Overall: A really great fruit beer. Huge real fruit flavor and the sweetness and tartness isn't overbearing. Has a decent body to it so it isn't really a quick drinker. Take the time to enjoy the raspberry."

"Both on tap and bottle were equally amazing."

"Tart, fizzy, and a little bit sour. Like a jolly rancher in a glass. Too sweet for daily drinking, but makes a great dessert beer. Especially if you like your dessert first. Wish there was more bitter and less berry in this, but would still seek this out for a special occasion pour."
""
""
""
"O: A bit on the sweet side for an everyday drinker, but thoroughly enjoyable. Well-made beer, and one I would highly recommend trying."
"The beer pours a clear crimson amber with a thin head that fades quickly. The nose is vegetal with a potent raspberry sweetness...without any indication of alcohol or tartness. The taste is just as sweet as the nose, but much more tartness finally presents itself. The aftertaste (proceeding the mouthwatering tartness) is malty and sweet. This beer doesn't resemble cough syrup, which is an added bonus! A slight yeastiness complements the beer's sweet nose and taste. It's a light bodied, drinkable, framboise-like beer that's slightly lacking in carbonation, but has sufficient malt characteristics to remind me this is actually a ""beer"" I'm drinking. I don't understand why this beer is quite so raved about, but I think it closely resembled blushing monk (which I prefer more) and is worth trying."
"Pours an amber red color with a very small quick fading white head. Smells of sour fruits and not much else. Very sweet smelling. Taste is pretty fruit forward but some sour funk is present as well. Mouthfeel is medium with decent carbonation. Overall this is very unique. Very enjoyable and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Hard to classify beer. If you want a raspberry beer, you've got it here - this thing does it so well that it has to surpass any of those expectations. Of course New Glarus is known by this, so the result makes sense."
""
""
""
""

"This beer is dessert in a glass. It's very fruity and mildly tart."

"Very much a dessert beer, and one of the best out of all of the dessert beers I've ever had. It also has the typical New Glarus signature style of making something exceptional by using an insanely dialed-in balance between relatively few (or minimalistic) flavor and aroma components."
"O: The funk ruined this beer for me, I thought the bottle may have been ruined; but Rutager didn't pick up on the fishy taste I was getting in the finish. Oh well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Got to give laymansbeerfan a HUGE THANKS for hooking me up with so many of these wants. This one was a real treat and worthy of my 500th review."
""
""
"O: Delicious. This is, the fruit beer. If you've had other's and enjoyed them, do yourself a favor, go to Wisconsin (or trade with someone) and buy a few of these. You WILL NOT be disappointed."
"Overall- Not sure why I've never had this before being from Wisconsin but it will become a regular in the rotation"
""
"Doesn't really do it for me. I enjoyed Belgian Red a bit more, but feel these are both overrated a bit. Not horrible, but sort of like drinking fruit juice and not terribly complex."
""
""
""
"O: The berry flavors and aroma have become muted with age definitely more pronounced in the younger bottle. Still an amazing raspberry ale with what seems more like an Oud Bruin than a Lambic base style. 4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is very good, should probably have split it but I'm selfish like that lol. The syrupy feeling makes it feel a little heavier than it is but you get past it really quickly."
""
""
"Verdict: Damn delicious stuff. One of the best fruit beers around, it almost drinks like fruit juice, but on a hot day, or really on any day you are looking for something different, this is spot on."

"Dark red body with a white head, light film and some bubbles retain. Nose is just - wow. Raspberry and rhubarb jam/pie filling. Just like a friggin' pie. A bit of spicing too, but the fruit presented is just brilliant. Tastes just about the same, raspberry and rhubarb pie, light spicing, sweet raspberry juice and some pie-like notes. Gentle tartness in the finish with some peripheral spicing. Medium body, low carbonation. Raspberry hangs around for some time. Overall, brilliant - easily the best fruit beer I've ever had."
"O: A good fruit beer. Borders on cloyingly sweet and fruity but the solid tart flavor is its saving grace."
""
""
"Overall: This drinks more like a fruit juice then a beer. This is not what I want when I want to drink a beer sorry but this one just doesnt do it for me"
""
"M - Medium body, very creamy. Light carbonation. Great mouth feel."
"Amber red colour with about a finger of white head, decent retention with a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is full of jammy raspberry, some malt a little bit of grainy yeast is also encountered, lots of tart fruity scents take over. Taste is all raspberry, tart and just on the edge of full blown sour, malt mixes in as well imparting flavours of a raspberry tea almost, you can almost taste the grainy raspberry its just that real, lightly funky towards the end of the glass. Medium carbonation, sharp dry feel with a medium body. Really, really good stuff, the fact that this tastes like real handpicked raspberries is outstanding, something I will definitely seek out to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Reminds me quite a bit of the Belgian Red from New Glarus but substitute raspberries for the cherries. These beers are equals in my opinion and I really enjoy the how damn fruity this beer is yet still maintaining a semblance of a beer character."
""
""
""
"O: quite a good beer, but maybe it's not my style. Overall it's very good, and I would pick it up at the store for certain people and certain events if it were the right price. Very good, but a little too much like fruit juice for me."
"Beer is medium-light to light bodied with ample carbonation. Still, the carbonation is not pointed enough to be agitating on the palate, instead it helps move this beer on the palate and prevents it from stagnating. Finish is semi-dry, with plenty of stickiness from residual sugars."
""
"Overall a very nice, crisp drink. I can't wait to crack another bottle in the heat of summer."
""
""
""
"Moderately thin bodied with medium carbonation. The lack of spritziness helps to keep this away from soda territory. Very drinkable; would go equally well with a piece of chocolate truffle cake or a BBQ dinner as a clean refresher."
""
""
"D - You wanna know how good this is? My girlfriend, who literally despises beer, not only stole my glass from me but poured the final 4 oz. of the bottle for herself. This is absolutely a reference fruit beer and is about as easy drinking and refreshing as you can get."
""
"O- Really impressed with this beer. Not overly sweet and really highlights the sweetness and tartness of raspberries. This would go perfect with some raspberry cheesecake."
""
""
"Waxed bottle, 750ml. I have been looking forward to trying this one for awhile. The wax comes off easy, and after popping the cap, a really nice waft of fresh raspberries (very natural, no syrupy/chemical/artificial flavors detected) hits my nose. Pours from bottle into my JK Farmhouse glass. Wrong glass for this, but I have nothing else. This is a crystal clear raspberry red color, very little head, but tight carbonation bubbles come up from the bottom of the glass. Smells great, looks great. Taste- What I love about this is that the sweetness and the fruit flavor all is very natural. It has some nice sugary sweetness, but it seems more like real fruit sweetness than some sort of artificial flavoring. As expected, there is a nice puckering tartness to this on the end, and a dry finish with tight carbonation. Really nice beer, will seek this out again."
""
"O - Overall this beer cannot be missed. A delicious fruit beer unlike any other I have had. A great way to show non-beer drinkers what some of the lesser know beer styles have to offer, and a beer I will endeavor to have on hand every time I have guests so I can share with them this wonderful drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - wow. Amazing beer. I have never had a fruit beer that tasted so fresh and ""real."" This is an amazing beer, one that I hope to come across again. Absolutely loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall...yeah, this shit is the real deal. I love a good fruit beer and this fills the void for me. That smell is crazy, as is the flavour. Cant think of anything more raspberry. Wish the mouthfeel and head/retention was better but the aroma and flavours more than make up for them!"
"Could use more tartness, but not bad. If you want an unsweetened lambic this beer is not for you. Pleasant dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As this warms up, it just gets more oppressively sweet to the point that my stomach is starting to get a bit upset. Perhaps if you frequently drink juice and soda and want a beer that's as sweet as them, this is an appealing beverage, but it's not at all for me."
""
"O: Overall, I really can't imagine a better raspberry beer. My personal presence would be a touch more sour, but I really think they accomplished there goal here.  And the smell, oh the heavenly smell!  I could see this as the perfect substitute for champagne for a Sunday brunch.  Very well done!"
""
"O: I like this much more than the Wisconsin Belgian Red but that is probably because I like raspberries more!"
""
"Yum."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the more unique raspberry beers, but I wish it was a lot more sour."
"O: I was expecting for something better, honestly. This is too one-dimensional. The wonderful natural complexity of raspberries is just not here. This is a simple jammy fruit beer. Thank god it's at least the sweetness is restrained."
""
""
"O: I think the lack of phenols and syrupy sweetness is what distances this from the lower quality framboise that I’ve had. An excellent treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I am going to be seeking for more of this and looking forward to trying the Belgian Red soon."
""
""
""
"An excellent light raspberry brew. Received in a trade with Willspeh - I will be asking for more, buddy."
""
""
"Great offering from NG. Both this and their Red are delicious takes on fruit beers."
""
"O-I think this is an excellent fruit beer. Not my first choice of style, but this is excellent. I am glad I have had the opportunity to try it. If this was available all the time to me I don't think I would drink it as much. And for the first time I am glad that I have a botte for myself. I will seek this out again and next time share it with friends. And yes I now want to find more New Glarus."
"A bit of a gusher, poured from the bottle into a Tired Hands stem/wine glass, light brown color mixed with strawberry red, clear, and a large, foamy pink-white head; decent retention, soapy lacing, bubbles came back to life after a gentle swirling. Nose is bittersweet, bready caramel infused with fresh raspberries. Taste is similar, tart raspberries up front (oh, I get it now!), good balance of sweetness. Not straight up juice like a Lindemanns Framboise; there's a good bready malt base in there to remind you this is a beer, a touch of bubblegum, and a leafy finish. Chewy mouthfeel, medium body, medium to low carbonation, with a few little bubbly streams visible rising from the bottom. A very enjoyable beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you were looking for a beer for wine lovers to convert with, give them Raspberry Tart. If you want a great tasting beer with a low ABV, you can't go wrong here. If you want to treat yourself to a beer you won't soon forget, look no further. We have a winner."
"This sets the bar as to what a fruit and, or raspberry beer should taste like. My first beer from New Glarus and I am very impressed."

"O: A very delicious beer. Sweet, tart, funk, and sour blend nicely."

"Well I have had this before but being in WI you just never think about reviewing it because it is always around. It is always around because it is awesome. We here in WI are really blessed to access to the best fruit beers on the planet and they are avaliable all the time!"

"D - Very drinkable. The raspberry flavor is very fresh and rich and works so well in the beer. The strong tartness is excellent as well."

"Bottle poured into Boulevard tulip glasses. Pours a very dark burnt orange with an off white head of about half an inch. The smell is sour, sweet, with a nose of dark fruit. The taste is crazy good. The raspberries shine through tremendously. Slightly sour with sweetness that pulls through at the end. The finish is strong but short. The mouthfeel is perfect with the right amount of effervescence and viscousness. Overall this is virtually a perfect beer of this type and I will for sure be searching this out again without question."

"A huge thanks to my friend Traci for getting this for me. Opened this over the weekend and shared it with a few close friends. The beer poured out as a nice clear looking ruby red color with a cream colored head on top. The smell of the beer floods the nose with a rush of fresh picked raspberries. There isn't too much else on the nose except for a light amount of tart funk, very light though and almost unnoticeable. The taste of the beer is sweet, it's loaded with raspberry flavors that dance on your taste buds leaving behind a tingling tartness behind. The beer finishes dry leaving you ready for the next sip. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a soft carbonation to it. Overall this is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for with this beer, I would enjoy this one over and over again. Very glad I got to have this and hope to have it again someday."

"Generally impressive beer. Well, if you enjoy fruit beers. Loved the appearance with its ruby red hue and nice foamy head. Smelled delicious and had tons of flavor!  The only knock for me was that it got pretty heavy after awhile due to the sweetness and tartness. I recommend this desert beer, but suggest you have someone else to share it with. Overall I liked this a lot better than the cherry ale New Glarus makes. "

"A true ode to the raspberry, though I wish it were just a bit less sweet."
""
"This is simply the best raspberry beer brewed in the US with all deference to Founder's Blushing Monk. Many Belgian breweries would be proud to call this their product. Not quite as good as Cantillon, but on par with Drei Fonteinen and Boon."
""
""
""
""
"A really nice fruit beer, probably the best out there. Bright red pour with plenty of raspberry aroma. The initial taste is very tart but then it is just raspberry throughout. It seems like a mix between a wine and a beer. Very good! Another great beer from New Glarus."

"Big thanks to Tewaris for hooking me up with this bottle! I opened this bottle and immediately the room filled with the sweet smell of raspberries. The body of this beer is clear dark red, thousands of bubbles rise up to form a champaign like head. A purple tinted head rises to two fingers before quickly settling to just a ring, leaving behind no lacing. The only way to describe the nose and taste of this is raspberries. On the label they claim to use wheat and hops, but all I can detect is the sweet sweet berries. Mouthfeel is very lively with carbonation, like a champaign or sparkling wine. Mouth puckering tartness is very well balanced by the sweetness. Don't know what else to say, other than this is worth seeking out."
"O - this was a great beer. i wish the smell matched the taste, but in a sense, i'm glad it threw me off like that because i was shocked when i had the first sip."

"O- Fantastic! This is a great raspberry beer. Wish I could buy this near me, definitely will seek this out again!"
""
""
"Overall: This is the standard by which all other fruit beers are measured. There's so much raspberry it's impossible to imagine how they get it all in there. The slight tartness pushes it over the edge and gives it enough depth that you know it's not just fruit juice. Truly legendary."
""
"Will seek out more of this for sure!"
""
""
""
"O: Another great fruit beer from New Glarus. I tried the Belgian Red the other night and it is pretty much exactly identical except for the cherry vs raspberry flavors. I liked the red just a hint better, and I'm not even sure why. The taste was ever so slightly stronger and more complex I think. Really I would rate them within .1 of each other if I could. Regardless, a must-try if you like fruit beers at all. The pinnacle of the style."

"Pours a nice deep ruby-red with a nice white head. Smells like raspberry preserves/jam (although not as much raspberry in the smell as I thought it would have), and tastes like it too. Love that nice tart finish. How is this beer? It's like drinking candy. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours red with a pink head that doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The smell is of raspberries, cherries, and some candy. Taste is actually good, there's raspberries and some good tartness to it. Although it is sweet, it is not terribly hard to drink. Medium bodied with some average carbonation which works for this beer. I am surprised at how much I liked his given it seems a bit of a gimmick but this is a good beer that I would drink often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes of sugary sweet raspberry preserves with high acidity and slight mellow hop bitterness. Finishes crisp and with a fruity acidic zing. Moderate to low carbonation. Overall incredibly delicious. Probably too sweet to consume more than a serving or two at a time, but definitely a splendid drink."

"New Glarus apparently knows how to make a fruit beer. Belgian Red was great, but this is slightly better. While there is a ton of raspberry in this, it's not particularly absurd. It's just fruity in the best way possible."
""
"Light body with crisp refreshing carbonation. Very easy to drink, and very enjoyable. An excellent beer."
""
""
"Overall a fantastic beer. It's really hard to say which is better between this and its Belgian brother because they are both phenominal."

""
"not anywhere near my preferred style, but it's easy to see why R.T. is at/near the top of the pile. wish i would've had this over a brunch of waffles, eggs, etc."

"Nearly full-bodied and creamy. A great framboise, and an incredible value if you live in Wisconsin. Another smash hit from New Glarus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a nice beer but almost too sweet and a bit too straight forward for me. For what it is, it is a good beer, but I have a bit of a hard time finishing a 12oz serving, let alone a whole bottle. Definitely one to split. Very glad I got the chance to try this, though."

"O: Another very solid beer from New Glarus. I got to try this alongside Wisconsin Red which I liked a little more but this one is amazing too."
"Overall: Having enjoyed NG's Wisconsin Belgian Red (Cherry) recently, I was interested in comparing the two. While raspberry tart seems to receive more acclaim than Red, my wife and I agreed that we liked Red better--but only by a hair. Tart is very well-done, and is one to get your hands on!"

"This beer pours a lighter bodied bright bright red in color with a dirty pink head that turns into lacing around the glass. It smells and tastes of syrupy sweet and creamy raspberries. It's like a smoother version of the Lindeman's Framboise. There is a lot of jam and sugar. The carbonation stimulates all of your taste buds and teases it like you're going to experience some tartness but really all you get is sweetness. It's ok, just a lot of sugar. It's definitely nowhere near Blushing Monk territory. It drinks light with a good amount of carbonation that really fits the beer well. This is a dessert beer first and foremost and would pair very well with chocolates or chocolate cake. By itself, it's a little much."
" ~ This is a great dessert brew with its tart and light character. I would and have recommend this beer to my friends."
""
""
"O: One of the best fruit beers out there. Hopefully one day NG will distribute outside of WI."
"O: Smooth, tasty, and just plain excellent. You get what you expect here – nothing else. Raspberries start to finish and it is very clean. Honestly, I could not drink more than an 8 oz. pour, but the wife enjoys this immensely. As such, going forward, I’ll just indulge another tasty treat while she enjoys this. Overall, a great beer though...well done!"

"O- I'm wondering how something like this does with age. The bottle says it is spontaneously fermented and I'm curious as to whether it would sour up with age or if some of that sharp tart raspberry flavor would fade away. Oh well, I just have one bottle and I'm drinking it now!"
""

"O: A supremely easy drinker, not overly sweet and another homerun fruit beer from New Glarus."
""
""

""
""

"Overall - Good stuff. I just don't know how to rate it. I like it, but it isn't earth-shattering. It's raspberries."
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this experience. This beer has an unrivaled drinkability due to the quality and low ABV. I can say, quite categorically, that New Glarus Raspberry Tart is a phenomenal, incredibly delicious beer. It's a damn shame all fruit beers can't be this good and that they don't distribute out of Wisconsin. Not something I want everyday but it is in a class of it's own and a must try for fans of fruit beers and quality craft beer alike."
"A very nice and easy drinking fruit beer, this is second only to Blushing Monk for as far as being a well balanced tart fruit beer. Definitely a must try for the fruit beer crowd"
""
"Cheers!"

""
""
"D/O: As the third American-brewed raspberry fruit beer reviewed in as many months this beer lets something of a letdown, given its positive reputation. While raspberry flavors are fairly intense, they are also less than credible. The sensory qualities of this beer seem to have been optimized for the palate of the non-beer drinker."

"O: This is extremely drinkable for the first 8oz or so, and then the reality of drinking straight-up raspberry jam begins to hit you. A fruity dessert beer of sorts. So this is probably a 4.25 for the first 8oz and 3.75 for the next Xoz."

"Overall, although its sweetness would become too much to enjoy in large quantities, this beer is light and fruity yet complex, making for an interesting, pleasant drinking experience."

"O: Great, I like these because they're basically alcoholic Italian sodas and in my opinion should be treating as such."
"O: Not a bad beer by any means . . . but it's difficult for me to even think of this as a beer. This is really just carbonated raspberry juice. It's fairly tasty, but is so simple and one-note in both taste and aroma that it'd be hard for me to call this a good beer. I'd like less raspberry and more beer (i.e. hops, barley, and yeast)."
"Overall a perfect balance of taste, with a great nose. On top of that the light abv makes it so amazing there is all this flavor in this drink, just fantastic beer."
"O - A beautiful light fruity beer. Great example of this style. Perfect light dessert beer."
"O - This is a fantastic fruit beer that is sadly only available within Wisconsin. If you take the time to look, there are very few breweries that are able to master the fruit beer - New Glarus is one of them."
"Poured a dark ruby-red with a creamy white head that settles to a thin cap. Luscious aromas of raspberry, oak, brown sugar, and crisp wheat. Taste is similar to the nose, mice raspberry jam flavors with more oak, brown sugar, and vanilla. You can taste the woodiness from the raspberry seeds, such a nice touch! Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, with a medium body and good, crisp carbonation. Overall another amazing NG offering, not quite as good as Belgian Red but still great!"
"Nose was chock full of red berry fruit, with raspberries (natch) in the front. Cranberries, cherry, red currants..it smelled almost like jam. There was another aroma that was hard for me to place - yeasty, maybe, but not like a Belgian beer. The taste was full on sweet raspberry, with twists of maraschino cherry juice, cherry skins and cranberry. Tart, acidic (but not too much), then finishing with a light syrupy sweetness. The body was light and the carbonation was high. Was a wonderful beer to share with my wife."
"Light bodied mouthfeel; crisp and dry with ample carbonation. Taste dominated by tart raspberry, sweet cherry, and hints of vinegar. For such a low ABV beer this boasts some huge flavors -- really exceptional."
"O-nice change of pace type beer that is easy to drink"
"O: I like this beer a lot and will be picking up more very soon. I got a bottle left but I want a couple more after trying this beer."
"O: Good"
"O: Pretty good. Again, I initially felt like something was missing here, though I settled right in and finished the bottle. For all of its sweetness, this beer could use a lot more carbonation to carry it along nicely."
"Overall, unreal. It still shocks me how much fruit flavor they can get in this beer. It's beautiful to look at and tastes even better. It's refreshing, almost like a carbonated fruit juice. The slight tartness helps keep the beer from being overly sweet. It's a beer you can drink all day and never get tired of it."
"I will definitely have this again. Due to the sweetsy nature I could never drink too much, but it's a welcome departure from the grainy malty norms of beer."
"In contrast to what some may think, beer and fruit are a welcome combination. Even more so when it's done this well."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with pretty low carbonation. Very nice and refreshing. Overall, I much preferred this to Wisconsin Belgian Red. It's a sweet beer, but the light amount of tartness does well to help offset that."
"The taste is a full of raspberries and more raspberries, but malt does make an appearance in the taste come in after the carbonation builds nice"
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, good carbonation levels and leaves a slight film on the inside of your mouth. This is crazy drinkable, as expected by the low ABV. Everything goes down so easily. Overall, this is a wonderful brew. Haven't had many fruit beers, but this blows me away. I've heard all the hype and tried to go in unbiased, but still was amazed. Definitely worth seeking out."
"super drinkable, goes down like juice. i find myself gulping it down way to quick. overall, this is a solid beer that i would come back to in a heartbeat. i maybe expected the slightest bit of funk, but there really is none. but thats ok because the raspberry flavors are pure and superb. however, i think i would take a blushing monk over this."
"The Gummy Bears cartoon, meets beer on this one."
"O: For a dessert beer this is awesome but the sweetness--though not cloying--does become slightly wearing"
"Natural, pure, and superbly crafted. There is little else to say. One of the most enjoyable fruit beers in the world."
"A pure raspberry assault. Tasty and better for my taste than the belgian red but a 750 mL bottle of the stuff became a little tiring after awhile. I love raspberries, theyre one of my favorite fruits, but this is probably a beer better suited to split between a few people."
"O: Great raspberry beer, the tartness balances out the sweet raspberries perfectly. Could easily drink glass after glass after glass of this."
"O: a great beer. just enough sweetness, and tartness. finishes a touch dry. the fruit in this beer is amazing."
"Overall: Personally I prefer this one to the Wisconsin Red, but either way I don't think I could ever drink an entire bottle of either. There is a point to where they become too much."
"D: This was a delicious raspberry drink. I guess it's beer? I would have preferred a little more tart/sour character, to help balance the sweet and acidic character. But this still had a great scent and taste and body, and it was very easy to drink. Highly recommended."
"O - Very good. Can't wait to get more."
"Thanks to CenCalMario for sharing this one with me! Pours a brownish red color with a small, white head. Scent is strong raspberry puree smelling...not much else. Taste is TONS of sweet raspberries and cane sugar...not much else. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and leaves a sticky feeling inside of the mouth due to intense sweetness. Drinkability is fair. Overall, I was kinda disappointed by this beer. I thought it would be a bit tart...since the word ""tart"" is in its name. This beer is a bit overly sweet for my liking, but not nearly as bad as Lindeman's Framboise. I guess if I were a fan of fruit beers, this one may be more appealing to me. Glad I got the opportunity to try it though!"
"This beer was certainly a treat to try however for me a single glass was enough. It's very sweet, as one would expect but the flavors are very well done and not overbearing to the point where it's off-putting. If you like red fruits, namely raspberries, this is certainly one beer you absolutely must try."
"O: Very good overall - one of the best fruit beers I've ever had. Very different from Blushing Monk in that this is clearly filtered and very clean, but still has all of the excellent flavor, whereas Blushing Monk is more of a fermented pureed raspberry look and feel to it. Both are very good, but the clean flavors and mouthfeel of this make it more drinkable in quantity - if you're so fortunate as to have a large quantity of it."
"O – Delicious, but a shade too sweet."
"Note from 8/7/11. Thanks to cmillward. A definite step up from the Belgian Red, but I still don’t quite understand all of the praise. Pours a transparent brownish ruby with no head, just a light smattering of bubbles on the surface, at first. Aroma is a nice mix of band-aid, juicy raspberry and earthy almost-funk. There’s less sweetness than the Red, which I appreciate, but still a bit too much, and a similar cough syrup note pops up in the taste. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, probably a shade less than the Red. It’s a beer that I sorta enjoy but couldn’t handle, much less want, anything more than a small glass. It’s probably a good choice for blending with stouts, if you want to explore that."
"MO- A quality beer that I would have regularly if it was available. Thanks to Nick M for schlepping this bottle along back to PA."
"O- this beer is a very delicious dessert beer. Its refreshing and satisfying your sweet tooth. A great beer by new glarus"
"O: OVerall, this is a delicious beer. It is a great beer to have as a dessert beer or during a hot summer's day. Good beer for people who claim not to be beer drinkers and prefer fruity drinks."
"This is a pretty damn good beer that I'm very happy to have tried. The raspberry flavour comes through really well and while I don't normally find fruit beers this sweet to be attractive it is still very enjoyable."
"Overall - You know, it is what it is. If you are looking for a raspberry type wheat beer, this isn't it. It's definitely similar to a framboise with lots of carbonation. This is a great beer to share, similar to a bottle of champagne - great dessert treat or one to drink with others while enjoying some cheese and crackers - hell, it is from Wisconsin after all. I probably wouldn't buy it again, but it's not because I disliked it, just not my favorite style of beer."
"Pours a dark red with a nice pink head. Looks really inviting. The nose is huge raspberry, like a puree. Drinks a balanced sweet and tart raspberry puree set to bubbles and not as heavy. One note, but one fabulous, balanced note. Yum. Heavy body for the ABV, but still refreshing. Overall, split this beer 4+ ways. I've never wanted more than ~6 ozs of this beer, but that is a really enjoyable number. Fits really well with grilled chicken as listed above."
"Pours a pinkish red hue with great carbonation but no head. The aroma is mind blowing. So much raspberries, that's really all I can smell its so powerful and amazing. Taste follows the nose, sweet but not too much, not an everyday beer but a great dessert or special treat beer!"
"The CPJ"
"Definitely not the type of beer I'd usually drink, but this was highly enjoyable. Just enough tartness and carbonation to keep this from being a sugar bomb. Great dessert beer. I actually wouldn't mind trying this mixed with a stout with lots of chocolate tones, and I never mix beers."
"D-this is quite easy to drink, very sweet and a little singular but tasty and could enjoy many."
"O: While I don't like fruit or vegetable beers, New Glarus has definitely upped the ante and made me at least enjoy them. While I probably wont try this one again, I'm glad I did because I'm always trying to expand my horizons and if there is a beer that can sway me I'm all for it."
"murky dark red with a dark pink head that actually holds for a bit and leaves pretty lace. nose is just straight up raspberry essence with a tiny tiny graininess hiding in there. way more sweet than tart, taste is perfectly balanced. although it is a massive wallop of sweet fruit, it somehow seems far from one-dimensional. so sweet, you feel like it is going to be cloying, but comes off clean. awesome if you are in the mood for full-on fruit attack with no trace of artificial."
"Overall, a very pleasant drinking experience, especially as a dessert beer."
"The appearance, smell, and depth all are secondary to the exceptional flavor of this beer. The strong aroma and flavor of rasberry's is delightfully overwhelming."
"Really good beer, worth the price as long as the purchase doesn't become a habit. I think I'll try the Wisconsin Belgian Red soon."
"O - Overall, this is by far the best fruit/vegetable beer I've had. The perfect dessert beer. Go buy it or trade for it!"
"This stuff is delicious and I recommend you get some. Best framboise I've had so far. I'll have to try the Belgian Red next."
"O: Very fruity and very tasty. I much prefer this to the WI Belgian Red, which has too much cherry on it."
"O - A very good beer that was very enjoyable for someone who is leery of fruit beers. Really enjoyed this one and I'd love to get one super fresh."
"O: All in all this is a super sweet raspberry syrup bomb. The thing that really stands out about it is that the quality of the sugars remains high. There is almost no stickiness to speak of, and there's never any question in the integrity of the berries used. This beer does walk a fine line with such low ABV for me, it really could have been a disaster, but it really wasn't. There's no chaos in the crafting of this brew, it's a refined recipe of extreme raspberry sweetness. That said, it's not quite tart in nature. All things considered, quite good, and I would have it again."
"Pretty minimal head that dies off quickly on this one. Has a golden body with a sort of purple glare to it. I honestly got a ton of honey in the nose with it being the dominate note, and some berry-ness tucked in behind it. The taste was to me like raspberry infused honey. It was very sweet, but never hit a super-sugar level thanks to its honey like character, and the raspberry was very natural seeming as present, though perhaps the sweetness of raspberries was played up quite a bit in the flavor. The mouthfeel was superb, with again a honey like slick and smooth quality, but juice like viscosity. It would be very hard to not call this beer delicious and hard for me to say I did not enjoy it thoroughly. I had to knock it down a little though because I thought it lacked complexity and also, at 4% abv, you have a lot of room to make a beer delicious. I think they probably could've tucked more alcohol into this, or at least should've invited the challenge to the flavor. Anyway, for an extremely delicious, sweet low-abv treat, I don't see it getting much better than this."
"Rating: 93 out of 100"
"Nice stuff on a hot day. Crisp, clean in the mouthfeel. Really just plays the raspberry card. No real hop character to speak of."
"O - Excellent beer, very interesting, very unique. I like Belgian Red slightly more but this beer is always outstanding. I love to drink this beer and find it a very outstanding fruit and dessert beer and I appreciate the complexity and craftsmanship of it every time I drink it."
"Overall, try it if you have access to it."
"just an outstanding brew and glad we have a second bottle in the cellar."
"EDIT: I enjoyed a second bottle of this shortly after writing my review - it seemed far fresher, and both the taste and smell were vastly improved. While the appearance didn't change much, I've increased my scores in the Smell and Taste categories accordingly."
"I am hoping that it was maybe my bottle that was just too old and therefore syrupy. I recieved it in a trade two weeks back and was saving it for an occasion with my girl. I kept it refrigerated at 36 degrees. Idk, I may give it another try in a while. For the moment, very dissapointed in my bottle of Raspberry Tart."
"Overall: This is a really nice fruit beer. I would definitely have it again."
"O - Ahh... The raspberries made it back to Oregon."
"On draught at the Great Dane Brewpub in Madison, WI. Pours a deep red and shows a small slightly rosy raspberry colored head that quickly dissipates and leaves very little lacing throughout. The smell gives off a boquet of tarts. It is mostly sugar and raspberries with a hint of oak. The taste is pure sweet and tart raspberry goodness. Not very sour, it is more of a tart flavor, hence the name. Medium bodied with nice sticky mouthfeel. This is a great beer with just about any dessert, highly drinkable, drink it cold. I am never a fan of vegetable/fruit beers, but this one is an exception! Your lady will love this one."
"Narrative: ::TOOOT!!!:: the olde timey steam whistle hissed signaling the end of another shift. The stern overseer, Rose Juiceworthington, kept a watchful eye over the employees of the Smuckers’ canning line and made sure that her will was enacted to the T. “Williams! My office, NOW!” the loudspeaker boomed. Williams, soaked in mashed raspberries had a sweet winsome disposition, but a sordid past. “I have seen you down there, slowing on the mashing. . .what’s so funny?” Williams raised raised her glance slowly, then swiftly smashed a can of raspberry preserves over Ms. Juiceworthington’s head, sending her cascading backwards into a molten pit of bubbling preserves. The gasps for breath made sweet gurgles and Williams nodded a sticky sweet approving nod, not to be confronted again."
"O - A great brew! Must try if you can find one... Worth going over $4$. I could drink one every month."
"O- A very nice brew I will be sure to get whenever I can (not often, but thanks to the beer mule network that brought me this one!) Not sure if the carbonation is consistent between bottles, it's still good enough that I'd search out another bottle to see if it has more carb to it."
"Overall a near perfect natural tasting fruit beer with a perfect balance of tartness and sweetness."
"Overall is just not my kind of beer I guess. I'm a little bummed by that as I was looking forward to this beer for some time."
"O – This was a real treat for me not having experienced many framboise’s. I can’t imagine any of them ever being better than this. Although this was a refreshing beer that usually means to me that its simple and drinkable, this had a rather complex taste and mouthfeel with a crisp yet refreshing flavor that I couldn’t get enough of, couple that with a 4% ABV and you have a very drinkable “beer.” I regret not trading for more than one bottle. I will definitely trade for this again."
"This showcases a fine use of raspberries in brewing but the prospect of finishing the bottle by myself is daunting. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt for quality craftsmanship but still, far too sweet for me."
"The amount of raspberry flavor packed in here is pretty amazing. So much tartness and fruit essence is impressive. Some grainy malt and light caramel give it the beery aspect it needs. I like the beer alot, but I cant help thinking how much better it might be with some lacto and brett. Would make a tremendous base for a sour ale, Flemish style!"
" Love it. Absolutely awesome and every bit as good as their Belgian Red."
"O-my first impression of this beer was a let down, but the more I drink it, the more i started to love it. this is like an addicting candy that i can't put away. though this might be too sweet to drink all night. i wouldn't mind having a few bottles of this to share when friends come over for dinner though."
"Overall: This is a really awesome framboise that, as the bottle proclaims, offers tons of tart raspberry flavor. Also, there is a nice complexity that plays between the tart raspberry and the very subtle caramel undertones. Overall, very drinkable and delicious!"
"Overall, dessert in a glass. Period."
"I probably wouldn't want mnore tha 6-8 oz of this, but itis very well made and would be perfect for brunch."
"Medium bodied with very soft, tight carbonation up front and a very sweet cloying raspberry flavor that dominates lingering into a slightly tart dry finish. There's a subtle earthy oak presence but again tastes mostly like artificial raspberry syrup. Just way too sweet and one dimensional for my taste."
"Overall - its good but hard to finish a bottle to myself. May just be too sweet from me."
"Pours a deep ruby with a big fizzy head that quickly fizzes away. Aroma is fairly mild; raspberries, faint earthiness, and slightly musty. Flavor Is very sweet, somewhat tart, and earthy. Almost no beer-like qualities aside from a slightly toasted oats flavor. Well carbonated with a sweet finish. Really impressed with this beer; lived up to the hype."
"Pours a semi-clear cranberry juice red with a tiny 1/2 light red head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing whatsoever. Smells of raspberries and raspberry puree in cherry/berry juice. There is a slight metallic odor I am getting too. Taste is awesome with sweet raspberries in a fruit juice cocktail. Very sweet yet slightly tart at the same time in a perfect balance. This is a highly carbonated beer that is very crisp and clean in the mouth. This is a delicious fruit beer all around and probably the best raspberry flavored beer I have ever had. Really refreshing and something I could drink a lot of in one night. I will seek out more of these for sure."
"Raspberry aromas leap from the glass with the appearance being a deep red with a faint head on top. As expected it is full on raspberry but the crisp acidity in this makes it perfect for a warm weather brew that doesn't kill you with alcohol. As it warmed in the glass the sweetness came through a little more and became a little too much for me. I recommend drinking this one nice and cold so the bracing acidity makes it easy drinking and not overly sweet. This is not usually a style I go for but would buy this by the case if I was in Wisconsin as I could drink this stuff all day especially as the temperature climbs."
"O: Another really good fruit beer from New Glarus, I might actually prefer this one to the Belgium Red. Drinkability is pretty good, but just like the Red, I'm good for only 10 ounces or so."
"Overall I really liked this one. While it really doesn't have many traditional beer qualities its still one hell of an enjoyable drink. While it is not something I would drink often, it is an excellent choice for the occasional drink."
"O - Excellent beer, very interesting, very unique, would drink again"
"Overall: Outstanding with every food we had last night."
"Drinks fabulous. Every day I'll be wanting another new glarus beer!"
"O: Somewhat under-whelmed, was expecting more. Not bad, but expected more. No date, so I can't tell whether it's old or just an off bottle. Might try it again if I can get it at the brewery."
"Lighter medium body, a bit sticky and syrupy, higher carbonation. Really nice flavor and nose, probably one of the better fruit driven beers I've had. Better as a dessert beer though than anything else."
"This tart leaves the palate completely dry and puckered like a mature red wine. Overall, I can't see myself drinking a full beer and enjoying it. Perhaps after a dessert, yes, but this is only a good beer for offering as a unique tasting to your friends."
"A really stellar fruity beer. The thing that really stands out about it is the balance. The fruit isn't overpowering; it's supported really well by a malt backbone that makes the beer smell and taste full and rich despite the light fruitiness. It's fruity enough to appeal to folks who aren't hard-core beer lovers, but has a ton of complexity beyond that. I bought one bottle to try it out, but I will be stocking up on this and drinking it many more times."
"9.7/10"
"Reveal: New Glarus Raspberry Tart"
" Fruity and floral perfume, strong raspberry and soft oak constitute the smell. The taste is sweet and tart, full of excellent raspberry flavor and stays on lips even after the beer is gone. Oak is certainly felt and complements the fruit well. Very good and very unique if bit of a novelty. Not the most drinkable beer in terms of quantity but very impressive in smaller servings."
"Raspberry Tart is one of America's most special drinks; this little Wisconsin gem has dual honors as being simultaneously one of its most unique and exquisite beers. Traditional and/or technical guidelines may differentiate this from the lambics of Belgium, but it warrants a demarcation unto its own and is every bit worthy of praise and reverence."
"T-very drinkable. Wish I had a lot more."
"Pretty darn good when split two to three ways. I must admit that the tart, sweet raspberry puree flavor overwhelms and I just can't give this one the same marks as some fruit lambics I've had (it's pretty one-note), but it holds its own for what it is."
"m/d - A bit thin and not very beer-like, but totally awesome to drink. This is not something you would drink all night long, but a nice treat of sweetness to mix in...like dessert or to break up some of the heavier beers. This was a big hit and a treat for the night."
"D- Very delicious brew, it's perfect for a desert beer, super rich and sweet, raspberry tartness takes over this beer, but in a very good way. This is one that should be split with another person because of its richness. Very refreshing."
"D-Just lots and lots of raspberry. I hadn't had this beer in a while and I had forgotten how big the fruit gets. Very interesting and tasty beer, its a nice break from the usual."
"Very approachable and easy drinking beer. It is very well balanced between sweet and tart raspberry notes."
"D: I would expect it to be difficult to drink a whole bottle of this yourself unless you really love raspberries. This is a good beer, but one that you should split with others."
"D: This was the first beer we tasted and it started us off with a really good pop. Its refreshing and easy to sip, but I understand why some people might not want to enjoy a whole 750ml to themselves. After awhile it seems it could get a little to much like drinking raspberry puree."
"(98th)"
"This beer pours a dark red color, with a small soda like head that disapated completly very quickly. Smells very sweet, and sugary, and smells like a cheery soda. The taste is very sweet, with a strong raspberry flavor, but then a tart flavor mixes in with the sweet flavor; very unquie. Has a nice carbonated feel, and finishes almost like a wine, and very easy to drink. Overall unquie, I like it, but its not like any other fruit beers."
"While each sip isn't cloying, you can only drink so much before the overall sweetness gets to you. A treat to share, that's for sure. Very refreshing."
"D: Oh man, I would have no issues drinking this stuff for dessert on a regular basis. Hands down one of the most flavorful low alcohol beers I've had, not to mention that it is a fruit beer. A great beer for both the beer geek and the novice, a tip of the cap to Daniel and Deborah Carey, very well done."
"Drink is very meh, sooo sweet, just too sweet and barely tart, bit of a sticky finish and a bit syrupy, some acidity, and jammy."
"Beer pours a deep ruby garnet color with a nice bit of tan foamy head on top. It dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. The smell is raspberry jam/jelly/syrup. It smells like a raspberry pastry...more like a nice danish and less like a jelly donut, but it is definitely a raspberry and sweet bread mixture. It's a very unique smell that I haven't seen in a lot of beers. The taste is pure sweet raspberry with a touch of tartness on the finish. It's fairly sweet, but not in a sugary cloying way. The fruit definitely comes through very well here, and the beer gets much better as it warms. This a great fruit beer that really showcases the flavor of the fruit. The mouthfeel is great and is perfectly dry. I expected it to be syrupy on the finish, but it is very clean. It is a surprisingly slow sipper for the low ABV, but I don't mind taking my time with it."
"Not much to say to summarize, one of two best fruit beers in the world, IMO. Coming from someone who doesn't enjoy fruit beers that's saying a lot. Because while I do love this and Belgian Red, they are not something I seek out on a regular basis. Although the nice thing is, if at any time I do seek it, out I sure don't have to go far to find it."
"D- Not a huge fruit beer fan but this was good. Easy to drink because of the perfect balance and low ABV. I almost finished the whole bottle. It would be nice if they could put this in 12oz'ers because 1 would be perfect. The larger size is almost too much in one sitting (for me). While not cloying....this does stray from the malty/hop beverage I usually prefer. That said....a nice change from wine. Would go great with some chocolatey desserts and shared."
"Drink- Pretty good little beer here. Got this as another beer for the wife to have to see what is on the beer side of life. So Belgian Red was a no. Raspberry tart was a no. So more for me to drink. I'm okay with that."
"I don't know what more there is to this beer than it's name. That's the best description there can be, I think, other than to note that it tastes good, and the flavors are well balanced."
"D: Very enjoyable beer with a full flavor and a low ABV. It was had no problem finishing the bottle and would certainly have another glass if I had it available to me."
"M/D: Not syrupy, light bodied and extremely easy drinking. Unsure if I have had a beer that is easier to drink. Easily my favorite fruit beer to date."
"D - Drinkability is high. My girlfriend can't have much beer, so I was drinking most of this bottle, but I was perfectly okay with that. Luckily the ABV is such that this is a great beer to have throughout dinner, but also pairs nicely with dessert. We had this with chocolate afterward and it was a great combination."
"This won't be for everyone but is definitely worth a try - it's a great representative of this style. Oddly, the second bomber seemed tarter than the first."
"Good stuff. Extremely tart but quite delicious."
"D: By far one of the best fruit beers I've had. I could drink a ton of this. Thank goodness for a 2nd bottle."
"d 2 not interested in having this again."
"I wish I had this on hand year round. But I'd have to move to Wisconsin to do it. So for now I'll try to appreciate New York's trash while remembering this treasure."
"Overall one of the best fruit beers that I have ever had. Can't wait to try the Wisconsin Belgian Red."
"D: One of the best fruit beers I've had. Very fresh and juicy. Highly recommend if you're into this style."
"D- high. This is the perfect example of a fruit beer and will always be highly ranked by me"
"D: super easy to drink like lindens rspberry frambrois with real raspberries"
"Good beer, perhaps only bested (in terms of American fruit beers) by Belgian red. Recommended."
"D: A light fruit beer. First glass was ok, but was too sweet after that. Glad I split this was someone. As a side note, I added campagne to make a delicious beverage"
"I could sip this ALL NIGHT. Its great to share, but who would want to. Insanely drinkable."
"D= Very Drinkable will be seeking it out again very refreshing I'm going to enjoy finishing this bottle."
"Massive thanks to shuajw (extra in past in-person trade) and sproser (Secret Santa '10) for bottles of this one! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a deep dark red with a one and a half finger off-white head with a slight pink hue that subsided to a minimal amount fairly quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and raspberries (duh!). The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberries, slight spices, and a nice tart note. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I opted to drink this one on Christmas Day to de-stress after spending time with the family. Had a very nice aroma and flavor going on with this one. Glad I have another bottle of this laying around so I can share this one some other BAs in my area. This is a must try of any fan of the style or those who are feeling a little adventureous. You won't regret it!"
"Session ale."
"Pours a deep crimson red color with a somewhat thick fizzy white head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of tart raspberries and malty sweetness. Tastes of both sweet and sour raspberries and plenty of sweet malts. Mouthfeel is medium and has a small carbonation. Drinkability is somewhat high."
"Overall, a great fruit beer from New Glarus. Nothing like anything I've had before, but still delicious. Great balance and the effervescence really make this beer feel like something special. Highly recommended."
"Thank you to zizzybalubba for this beer in an in person trade here in the miserable city of Elizabeth City. A day after having the belgian red, this was quite a bit easier to drink. The smell was tame, but the flavor was awesome. It was sweet, but not overly and a very well done fruit beer. I breezed through the whole bottle and loved drinking it. I had hoped to drink this beer for a celebration I was waiting for, but the news never came and the beer stared at me everyday, so I drank it. Well done."
"D: To hell with raspberry cobbler... just give me some of this stuff!"
"D: Goes down dangerously easy, very tasty, not too filling, not much of a kick, and an exceptional example of the style. This is a fantastic beer! I wish that I could get my hands on more!"
"drinkability is perfect - i would drink this every day if i could - low abv and great flavor"
"Drinkability: This gets a strong score from me because of the great raspberry taste. I am extremely tough on fruit beers, raspberry in particular, and this is a great one. This is a situation beer though, perfect to pair with a dessert or brunch"
"This brew is as drinkable as it can get for this style. Reminds me of a very clear, semi tart, not overly pseudo lambic spin off. cherish this one if you get to sample it."
"D: Very easy drinking. Maybe a bit too sweet to drink glass after glass. Would make a great start or end to the night."
"D: Near perfection. Very near."
"Drinkability - We finished the bottle relatively fast, however, it is still a sipper beer despite the low ABV. Because of the sweet/tartness, not huge drinkability, but damn good. A damn good beer."
"D- A sweet and slightly tart treat that is a bit of a sipper even at the low ABV. Makes for a good desert beer. Find a friend or two to share the bottle with."
"D- Sweetness takes away from this, but this is a fruit beer and that should be taken into account. I wish I had another one of these for Thanksgiving dinner, feel like it would fit perfectly and the alcohol level is low enough so you wouldn't make a scene at the dinner table."
"Overall- This is probably the best american made ""framboise"". A bit one note, but the one note is delicious. Finding this to be much more drinkable than the Belgian Red. Highly recomended!"
"All in all, this is a great beer. Best of the style I have ever had. It truly does taste like a raspberry white cake dessert. This would be great blended with cheesecake or a nice thick dessert. Definitely good to try at least once if you're interested in the style."
"D - Very easy to drink, but it's also incredibly rich for a 4% beer. I realize a lot of people would prefer a beer like this on a special occasion, but I would drink this on a very regular basis if I could. The balance between sweet and tart is spot on. My favorite fruit beer."
"D - A very nice aperitif or desert beer, on the other hand, at 4%; it's sessionable.. Well made and packed with flavor."
"O: Absolutely fantastic. Has the ability to completely change the way people think about beer."
"Finally had the chance to try this and upon pour I had no idea what to think. It pours a very very red color with a thin head. Mild carbonation and smells like nothing but raspberries. Believe it or not it also tastes like raspberries with a slight oakiness to it. It does however leave a little prickling on the tongue and mouth which is a tad uncomfortable but it is called raspberry tart. To anyone that likes raspberry soda, you will love this."
"D- Had a whole bottle to myself. If I could get a keg of this stuff, I'd probably drink it as a replacement for juice. Nice low ABV beer."
"An excellent example of a fruit beer. This in not a funky, sour lambic with fruit (which I love as well). If that is what you are thinking, that is a mistake. This is a great beer with fresh fruits. Highly recommended."
"The smell of this ale is extraordinary. The closest thing I can compare it to is a light fruit wine, but its mouthfeel and taste are much more substantive than that. It pours a beautiful garnet color and will become my annual New Year's drink. It's close to perfect for its style. That said, its style is one I only occasionally indulge in, so it will be a treat to have only now and again."
"Pours a hazed ruby brown color with nice cap of slightly tinted pink head, good retention and some sticky lacing. Scent is dominated by the raspberry... good balance between sweet and tart, faint hints of dried grain, wood and earth. First sip astounds... equal parts sweet and tart raspberry with neither overpowering each other or the overall tastes. Modest hints of dried grain, wood and earth in the background as the tongue gets used to the intense fruit. Medium bodied, slightly dry finish, lighter carbonation. Phenomenal beer... the raspberry, while intense does not become to sweet or tart... the perfect fruit beer."
"D - Even with the intense sweetness I found myself longing for another bottle right away."
"D/O- More of a celebration beer than something you want to make a night of. Absolutely adore this and it's brother, the New Glarus WBR. World class beer from a world class Brewery."
"Raspberry Tart is quite possible the best fruit beer. New Glarus knows what they are doing. Intense flavors but easy to drink. This is a beer to serve those who think they don't like beer."
"D: Awesome fruit beer. couldn't drink a whole lot, but certainly would love to have this again."
"D - Very good. Sweet, tart, refreshing and full flavored. This is a well brewed beer."
"D: Eminently high. This stuff is like candy for adults."
"Drinkability: While I'm not a huge fan of overly sweet fruit beers, this one is a pure joy to drink. If I ever needed to convince a wine lover to drink beer, this would be the gateway beer. Need to trade for more."
"D. I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as the two I split the bottle with. I was glad to try it, but I wouldn't be seeking it out again. My wife informed me that I will be seeking it out again for her, which is cool; I'm glad when she enjoys beers enough to have me seek them out."
"Picked this guy up randomly while shopping fer brews at the outset of the Man's Weekend. It pours a deep garnet/ruby/other miscellaneous red-colored gemstones topped by well over a finger of slightly pink-tinted light ecru foam. The nose is an explosion of sweetened raspberries, as though a bowl o' them berries had been sprinkled liberally with confectioner's sugar. Some blueberries may or not be in the bowl as well, and some cinnamon seems to have been added to the sweetening party, though in much less abundance. The taste follows pretty dern closely, but a nice tartness replaces the seemingly sugariness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sticky, syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice bit o' fruity goodness, excessively drinkable and increasingly tart/complex (so to speak) as the tasting goes on."
"This beer as expected pours a nice ruby red color with the slightest of pink head on the surface that fades away rather swiftly. The smell is of tart raspberries (surprised? I know!). It may actually be my imagination, but I believe in the tail end i smell a buttery character. The combined smell is of a nice raspberry pie. The taste, well, I'm fairly certain I'm not drinking beer, but the label says that I am. The flavor obviously consists of raspberries, now the good thing about it is that it doesn't taste of the raspberry extract that many brewers use. It tastes of real raspberries and that is to its credit, you can definitely taste the difference. The mouthfeel is a little too syrupy for my liking, but it does carbonate well. The drinkability for me faded rather quickly. What started as something easy to drink got progressively harder, for it seemed the beer grew more sour on the palate. The caveat is that I'm not a fruit beer guy. If you are, go for it, this is a pretty good creation."
"Taste is all raspberry and nice tart sweet fresh fruit, it's very delicious and sweet. One of the most drinkable and tasty fruit beers i've had. Mouthfeel is light and sharp and very drinkable."
"D - Quite a drinkable beer. Not a surprise after having their Wisconsin Belgian Red. This is one that would be great with dessert or if you are looking for a nice refreshing beer."
"D - For what it is, drinkability is excellent."
"Drinkability- very Drinkable. Definitely something I could sit down and drink this all day!"
"D: pretty high"
"I'm so glad I was able to try this and Wisconsin Belgian Red, as they have really opened my eyes to the potential of fruit beers. Two truly spectacular brews from New Glarus."
"I love this beer."
"Drinks: one-dimensionally. As displays of a particular fruit go in beer, it doesn't get much better than this one. However, I wish more of the beer was allowed to shine through. As it is, it's lacking in complexity and is just a tad sweet and for my tastes."
"This beer is crisp, and clean. So easy drinking the bottle was gone leaving me smelling the glass after. Perfect for dessert, or just a beer to finish this day with."
"d -Great carbonation makes your mouth tingle with this one. I really enjoyed this beer. I would love to drink this on a warm, sunny day. With any luck, I will get another shot at it."
"This is a classic as far as I'm concerned. A beer that will please the uninitiated and the beer geek alike. It is quite versatile as well. It pairs well with salads, it's great with soft cheeses, and it goes nicely with many desserts...or as a dessert in itself. I would always have a couple of these on hand if New Glarus were available in PA."
"D: As with the Wisconsin Belgian Red this is incredible fruit beer. I'm so glad I got to revisit it. I still like Belgian Red a tad more, I think that's because I'm more of a cherry fan than raspberries. But I still love raspberries, this was phenomenal."
"Had some of this last night at a tasting/catfish fry in my backyard, and it occurred to me that although I have had this beer a number of times, I had yet to review it. Poured a nice juicy purple color, with some pink foam on top. Huge aromas of fresh, tart raspberry. More freshly picked raspberry on the palate. Simply put, this is an amazing vehicle for showcasing the beauty and deliciousness of fresh raspberry."
"D: This beer goes down so easily. Wow. I could drink a lot of these. Would be best as a dessert/after dinner beer or substituting it for champagne at a special occasion."
"D- I could drink a growler or two of this stuff. This is one of the tastiest beers I've ever had. I kind of have a hard-on for raspberries, so take that under consideration... but if they're your bag you can't really go wrong with this one. World-class."
"Bottle. Pours a magnificent reddish hued clear color with a nice pinkish head. The aroma is strong raspberry notes with a sweetness I have come to expect for the NG fruit beers. Slight tart as well. Nice balance of sweetness and tartness upon my first couple of sips. This beer is so good. This weekend I had Phoenix Kriek, NG Belgian Red, and this and I have to say this was my favorite of all 3. Light/Medium mouthfeel."
"Drinkability's great if you want something fruity without the excess sweetness."
"750 ml poured into a generic chalice. Ruby red body. Thin off-white head. Sticky but not resinous lacing on the glass. Aroma of raspberries with some funky tartness. Very clean smell. Taste is sweet yet tart in perfect balance. Who couldn't love this beer served at the right time at the right place in the same way? I beg again, how can any one not love this beer? Pretty effing awesome. Thanks Jim, for sharing this treat."
"D: The drinkability is severely limited by the sweetness. Otherwise, this is an interesting and good brew, although it tastes more like a cider than a beer in my opinion."
"A great fruit beer. Would work well with a plate of fine chocolates for dessert. This is a fine example of a beer being exactly what it claims to be. Well worth it for anyone who loves raspberry beer."
"DB- So much raspberry awesomeness. One or two glasses would be enough but they are so enjoyable, very filling. So flavorful, is this really a beer?"
"D- this is a session beer, and it has amazing flavor. I wish I could get New Glarus more often, because I want to have a stable of this in my fridge at all times"
"Infinitely drinkable although the sweetness may get tiring. But a 750ml by myself would be so easy. Not very complex but wow, what a great fresh fruit taste. Lived up to my expectations and then some, a real eye opener."
"Drinkability is off the chart. It's fun, good flavor, light and refreshing, and low abv. In terms of drinkability, there's little not to like about it."
"D - I could drink this all day. I'm blown away by this beer. The mix of sweetness and a hint of tart is amazing. I think I'm in love!"
"This is a very drinkable beer. I'm usually not much for straight up, non-sour, fruit beers, but this one is quite good and at only 4% ABV I can enjoy it all afternoon. The sweetness may cut down on the drinkability eventually, but that's really the only knock against this beer. I'd have to say that I like this even more than the Belgian Red. Nice work on the fruit beers New Glarus."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass while watching top chef last night. Great red color with a pinkish head and no visible lace. The raspberry smell hits you right away and its fantastic. Taste is somewhat sweet and tart but not too much of either. Great mouthfeel with a nice carbonation. Drinkability is off the charts. I can't keep this stuff around for more than a few weeks when I get it, I just love it and really enjoy drinking it. Very refreshing, besides sweetwater blue, it's the best fruit beer I have ever tasted."
"Light berry red clear body, minimal visible carbonation, little head to speak of and very little lacing. The nose is an indicator of things to come, nice raspberry notes with some vanilla (). Taste is, IMHO, superb, a nice sweet, tart raspberry feel, not overwhelmingly tart or sweet, some floral hops, great balance. Mouthfeel is light and very refreshing. I could drink this all night long. A very special beer to be shared with friends at special occasions. My favorite fruit beer, hands down. I am seriously thinking about a trip to Wisconsin, though perhaps Oregon should hold them hostage re send us the beer and we'll send you are berries:) Absolutely superb, highly recommended."
"D: Tastes good. Very user friendly with a strong fruity flavor. Fruity sweet, with low alcohol. On a certain level, it's hard not to like this beer, but at the same time it's not overly satisfying as a ""beer."" This one is great if you are into fruity beers. It's overwhelming if you're not."
"Thanks again, Jim!"
"Lightly tart, 2/10 on the sour scale. A clearly defined raspberry flavor, sweet and juicy, very effervescent. Very lightly puckering, but the sweetness comes in and extinguishes any trace of sourness. Nice balance. One is enough to savor."
"This is a drinkable beer, but you have to like sweet alcohol drinks. This is closer to light wine than a lambic in terms of sweetness. The fruit flavor is nice in that it seems to be closer to natural flavors than artificials or extracts."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and carbonation is high. pretty fitting mouthfeel for the style and beer. Drinkability is very good, it's definitely one of the best fruit beers there is. The balance between the fresh fruit and the tartness really make it very drinkable. Excellent beer overall."
"A: Good layer of foam that dropped somewhat slowly to reveal a thin layer of spotty head, deep red to amber in color, a nice smattering of spots along the interior of the glass- 4.50, S: Intense raspberry on the nose, extremely fruity and sweet almost to the extreme, near duplicate to some of the premium framboise lambics, no noticeable hop aromas - 4.50, T: Like the nose there's a ton of raspberry on the palate and as the name indicates it's quite tart, extremely sweet, though my experience in lambics may be limited this is as good as any I've ever had, no discernible hops, the faintest sign of earthiness in the back of the beer, all around a stellar beer - 5.00, M: Mouth feel is quite silky and medium bodied - 4.50, D: An amazing beer, I thought I enjoyed the Belgian Red but Raspberry Tart is possibly a step ahead, I'm not sure if I could see myself buying another Belgian Framboise after this beer in terms of taste and price, try this beer - 5.00"
"Plus, this is actually the only beer my wife will ever drink- glad I got several bottles."
"d - I thought this was a great beer. The only fruit beer I like better is New Glarus' Belgian Red. Smells and tastes great; I feel like I could drink this all day. Looking forward to having this again."
"I liked this beer a lot and will be trading for more in the future. It is deserving of its top 100 position and should be sought out by anyone looking for something unique."
"D- Just very easy to drink and would drink more if I had some... Do yourself a favor and get a bottle of this beer, you won't be dissapointed."
"D - Ya this stuff is awesome, If you find it BUY IT!. New Glarus just makes amazing beers and this is probably my favorite so far. Great Stuff!"
"This is another New Glarus beer that doesn't disappoint. The Raspberry Tart pours with a nice dark red tint and has little head that lingers. The smell is definitely raspberry, much like you may expect. The taste is also obviously raspberry, but is just slightly sour, nothing too outrageous though. The drinkability is very high on this beer. This beer doesn't really seem like a beer, but I highly recommend it."
"I very much enjoyed this beer though it is a bit sweet for my taste."
"Drinkability: This is a perfect dessert beer or just a rare occasion refresher. I wish I had more access to these. I will certainly seek out and try it again."
"Drinkability -- I knew this was going to be good, but not this good! Rich, deep raspberry flavor on every inch of the tongue. It's so intense and flavorful that it may be daunting to finish a bottle, but it's hard to hold that against it. For those who don't think they care for 'fruit beers,' this will change your mind."
"D- Super drinkable... quaffable... and sessionable! Wonderful warm-weather beer for mixed company!"
"D-Another wonderful fruit beer from New Glarus. As always, not cloying, just the balance of sweet and tart. Way too easy to polish off a bottle of this."
"The beer is a dark and clear ruby color with a light pink foam. The aroma is sweet and fruity, lots of fresh raspberry. It tastes like raspberry soda, just a little tartness to offset the sweetness, no real bitterness. Light bodied and delicious, the bottle emptied quickly. Worth its ratings."
"Overall, a great beer that I enjoyed a lot and will try to get more of for our short summer here in the Fourth Corner."
"Drinkability: Not sure what to saw about drinkability - it's a light beer but the heavy raspberry taste and sweetness would get overpowering for me after one glass."
"D: this has to be one of the best fruit beers I've ever had that is not too sweet, and sourness that balances it out beautifully. Will definitely seek out more of this raspberry bomb."
"This feels very American to me. This beer tastes like November, like Thanksgiving, like an old tradition kept alive."
"Tastes slightly tart with plenty of raspberries. Not a fake raspberry presence either. The mouthfeel is like the sparkling grape juice you get as a kid during Christmas time. Very light on the tongue. A great beer, however unbeer like it may seem."
"That's the best I can do, though. Always wondered how this stays in the 100 while so many barrel-aged barleywines mixed with goat coffee & the tears of Hank Aaron came & went. I have seen the light. Great beer."
"At 4.00%abv, this one just begs to be drank in mass quantities. It is deliciously easy-to-drink also. The sweetness may be a touch too high for a lot of people though, so I can't quite give it perfect."
"D- This is a very good, well put together raspberry fruit beer. Much better, IMO, than the Belgian Red. Very enjoyable and a top notch fruit beer-but somewhat lacking in complexity."
"If you are looking for an intense sweet tasting brew, this is for you."
"Drinkability is good as well, just a touch cloying after a while. Couldn't do a second bottle under any circumstances but love this in small doses. A world class offering from New Glarus."
"Thanks to fear025 for this one. I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into 2 snifters. It pours a deep purple with red highlights. The 2 finger head is fizzy and white and leaves a bit of lacing. The nose is all rasberries. The flavor is a rasberry puree, sweet and tart. It finishes with lingering tart fruit. This one is light in body and highly carbonated and effervescent. It would make a wonderful dessert beer. It is pretty sweet, I don't think I could do a bomber solo."
"This barely resembles a beer. Great pink color, nose is pure raspberry, a the taste is 100% raspberry tart, as described. Very easy drinking at 4%, nice sweetness to balance the tart punch on the tongue. I would love to have this with some angelfood cake or vanilla ice cream. Wonderful dessert beer."
"Really enjoyable, but as I am with the entire bottle this eveing, it might be overwhelmingly sweet, but I'm still looking forward to finishing it."
"Thanks to jojomdma for the trade at DLD for this one."
"5.0 D: I really like it. I have another bottle in the cellar that I'm tempted to open up, but I must resist. Gotta share. The people of Pittsburgh need to know about this one."
"Awesome."
"I prefer the Belgian Red"
"D - Although delicious, it is underwhelming due to its similarity to a Lindeman's/Floris-type Lambic, especially considering the general fanfare surrounding this beer and the frequent disdain for the Lindeman's/Floris-type of candy-ish Lambic."
"wife after a hard day of driving around a different state looking for good beer!"
"D- pretty good I suppose. Like I said b4 not my fav style, however, I could drink a lot of this even though its so sweet."
"The beer pours a medium-dark red color with a large white head. The aroma is strong raspberry. The flavor is sweet raspberries with a nice strong tart finish. Medium mouthfeel and medium, crisp carbonation. This has a more soda-like mouthfeel than the Belgian Red which seems to be more juice like. Overall, an outstanding fruit beer."
"Consumed: 3/25/2010"
"d- as its getting warmer i find i like it better, the more it was cold the more of that metal taste i was getting. it seems the taste gets overly redundant and that sour/tart taste at the end gets harder and harder to put down at the back end of this brew."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is tart and biting but the flavor is so good, I just don't care. The sweetness of this beer makes me glad I'm sharing it with a couple friends because the sweetness wouldn't make me want to drink the entire 750."
"Loved this beer. I'd have to say it's my favorite fruit beer to date. It's tough to get New Glarus around my parts. Hopefully my Navy buddy can come through again."
"Pours a reddish mahogany that is barely translucent, and has a minimal head, which may be an artifact of how it was poured. Raspberry dominates the rich and sweet aroma. Flavor is mainly raspberry, fairly sweet and slightly sour, more like a raspberry liqueur than a beer but still tasty. Texture is tingly, fizzy and edgy so it fairly dances on the tongue."
"Deep raspberry red in color with a pink head with great retention and lacing. The nose is dominated by bright, ripe, fruity raspberries with the classic New Glarus base of brown sugar, vanill and oak. A fruity sourness is apparent, this smells tart and refreshing. The palate doesn't disappoint, opening with a big fruity, acidic bite with lots of ripe raspberries, sugar, jaggery and vanilla. Drying on the finish with a fruity tartness and a clean but mildly solvent-like acidity, this is very enjoyable stuff."
"Thanks Brewcrew!!"
"On tap pours red with a thin white head. The aroma on this beer was amazing. Exploding raspberries was what I got every time I smelled it. And I took a smell each time I drank. It was wonderful. Had a medium mouthfeel with a lot of tiny carbonation bubbles. The taste of this is very subtle, yet complex. High raspberry flavor throughout and is very sweet. I could enjoy this with a nice flourless chocolate cake for dessert and be the happiest person on the planet. This is a great brew."
"Sampled at the Metro Detroit October 09 tasting. Ruby copper pour with a short lived white head. The aroma is sweet raspberries and brown sugar. More of the same in the flavor with a long, juicy, berry finish, a little chocolate, some tartness on the finish with lingering nutmeg and cinnamon. Awesome balance and complexity! Sticky, medium full body."
"Conclusion: Really nice fruit beer. One of the best I've had, period. I actually think I may be in the minority of people who like Wisconsin Belgian Red a bit more than this, but I'll have to try that one again to be sure. I'll definitely pick up a few more bottles of this next time I'm up in Wisconsin. This paired wonderfully with a Parmesan/Cheddar mix soaked in Raspberry Tart and some jam-filled cookies."
"Pours a clear, deep raspberry red with a surprisingly large, light rosy head that has very nice retention and not surprisingly little lacing. If you like raspberries then the aroma and flavor are amazing and probably the best use of that fruit I've tasted in a beer. If you don't, well I guess I can understand you disinterest. Aroma is fresh raspberry puree, balance of tart and sweet with nothing else. Flavor is more of the same, medium thick body, mild carbonation, very dry finish and epic blend of raspberry sweetness and tart. Doesn't exactly fit the ""normal"" perception of what a beer should be, but what fruit beer does? Easily my favorite raspberry beer."
"D- Wow I will pass on this one."
"Drinkability - New Glarus makes several fruit beers of uncommon quality. This one is on par with both the cherry and the cranberry - and that's saying something."
"D - hand down one of the best fruit beers out there, the only thing that possibly topped this was the cheese we were eating with it. wish i had a third or fourth person to split this with as it was a bit wearing after awhile. nicely done!"
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth."
"What makes this so good is the boldness without excess. So flavorful. So good. Taken slowly a lot can be enjoyed."
"D: drinkability is held back by the accumulated sweetness sip after sip."
"Beer is sweet and full of tartness from the raspberries. Medium to low body, lots of carbonation on the palate. Sweetness is up front and the tart is in the back of the mouth. Beer finishes rather cleanly and there is no aftertaste. Its a very pleasant experience and I love drinking this beer. If raspberries are your thing, I would check this out totally. Drinkability high, good mouthfeel."
"Very interesting beer. Impressive."
"D: The sweetness is formidable. A couple of ounces is the perfect amount for me. If you haven't had this before, I recommend sharing the bottle with a few other folks."
"Drinkability:This was alot more enjoyable than expected. I really worried due to the low abv and appearance of the brew in the bottle it was going to be some thin tart overly sweetened juice like beverage. It took pouring this to see it was going to be a suprise. Really sat nicely in the glass and wasn't extremly complex, but none the less was ALOT more than I expected. This is the first brew I can safely say my girlfriend would enjoy and I'll have to make another trip to Wisconsin just to do so with her. I'd much rather share a bottle of this next go around due to the size and sweetness."
"this beer pours a nice clear reddish brown color nice off white head that recedes to lacing with a bit of reddish color as well. the aroma speaks of some sort of bready malt and raspberry, it's a nice clean fruit smell. the taste is where it really hits you this is a worldclass beer. the raspberry compliments the malt bill very nicely and the tart finish really makes this a standout beer. the full body and adequate co2 make this a really good beer."
"The beer pours a beautiful dark red color with a thick frothy pink head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! Just like the label suggests: Tart raspberries. It's extremely fruity with a killer raspberry character. The taste is perfect. It's everything a fruit beer should be. It's way over the top with raspberry character. It hits you in the face with a commanding sourness and doesn't back down. What a great beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a treat. It's highly drinkable and soo soo delicious!"
"Really tasty stuff - highly drinkable and delicious fresh and fruity."
"T: Much, much more drinkable than the Wisconsin Belgian Red. The lack of cloying sweetness is quite a nice surprise and makes this beer very enjoyable."
"D: All of New Glarus' fruit beers are extremely drinkable, and this is no exception. There is no evidence of alcohol, and if I didn't know any better, I wouldn't think there was any alcohol at all in it. Great beer!"
"A red wax dipped 750ml split with my wife. Poured into a pair of wine glasses. The ale appears a slightly murky muted crimson color with about two fingers of light pink foam. Nose and flavor consist of boat loads of raspberry jam, juice, and puree, ever so sour and tart, nice sweetness. That's about it here - real berry flavor and aroma. Decent body with ample carbonation and a dry sweet finish. Time to trade for a few more once the weather warms up."
"Drinkability... what do you think?! Deliciousness in every drop!"
"Overall - If you love raspberries, than this is for you. Some might complain that this isn't a beer, but I find it a fantastic example of a fruit beer/lambic. The raspberries hit you immediately upon opening the bottle, and live on through the last drop. A great beer to split several ways, or with dessert. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This one disappeared a bit faster than the Belgian Red did. A bit too sweet and fruity to want it very often or in quantity, but still a good and highly drinkable beer."
"D: Highly drinkable though I don't know how this could be called beer. It might be the best juice or flavored soda I've ever had but I'd never think its beer."
"Like this one better than the Belgian Red both are exceptional brews but this one is less sweet and a little more pleasing for my personal preference. The nose is incredible raspberry and drink ability to match. This is another great beer to share with family at holiday dinners. Most can't believe it's a beer.. This is for those that say they don't like beer! Worth seeking out your efforts will be rewarded with a pleasant drinking experience!"
"While this is good, we both preferred the Belgian Red."
"D - Great during the holidays and should be split several ways, IMO. I'm almost 100% sure there's no way I could finish an entire bottle by myself. Truthfully, I prefer the Wisconsin Belgian Red."
"D: This is beer? I honestly think that if someone handed me a glass of this I would think it's fruit juice. I could sip on this for a while. It would probably get too sweet eventually, so I'll say 4.5."
"Overall an outstanding beer. I'm very proud to know this is produced in my state. It's a great feeling to know anytime you're in the mood for it. It's never more then a few minute drive to the nearest grocery store to pick it up."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 750ml bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Poured the color of unpasteurized cider with a light swirl of foam - no lacing. Nose is raspberries (duh), with a hint of acidity. Taste reveals sweet raspberries, but not Lindeman's sweet. Mouthfeel is light with an active background effervescence. Very interesting brew - a little too much on the sweet side of the spectrum. Could definitely benefit from a little sour and/or dryness to break up the flavor profile."
"overall, this is a sweet beer reminds me more of a champagne"
"drinkability is great. soft and pleasant, this brew will convert many sceptics to the world of better fruit beers. cheers!"
"Delicious! Everything you could want in a sour fruit lambic style beer. This is probably the best lambic I've ever had, and it's not even from Belgium! Another great feature is that it's very likable by non-beer-drinkers. Will probably serve some of this at my wedding."
"Bottle opened by Torry on 11/22/2009 and poured into a snifter. The beer is ruddy dark red with a fizzy light pink head. The nose is ripe, sweet, sugary, and authentic raspberries. The fruit is amazing in the nose. It reminds me of a raspberry desert. The taste is delicious sugary sweet raspberries. The fruit is ripe and authentic. There's nothing more to say about this. It's a delicious raspberry desert beer. It's quite sweet so 4oz is plenty of this delicious concoction."
"Drinkability is pretty high. I could see myself pounding these all night and not worrying about intoxication or getting too tired of the flavors found in this beer."
"Drinkability: this is one of the best fruit styled beers I have had the pleasure to drink. Easy to quaff and very enjoyable."
"Raspberry Tart is an outstanding beverage. It sure doesn't seem like beer, but it sure is tasty! A magnum is plenty for one person, surprising given its low ABV. A beverage that's worth seeking out, and one that performs better with a portion of Irish Cheddar."
"Had another bottle recently, had to dock it, doesn't have enough raspberry essence."
"D - Amazing drinkability...this is so easy drinking. Sweet and smooth...should go amazing with chocolate desserts. I keep thinking this everytime I have this beer, but don't think I've ever paired them together. This beer just tastes so good on its own. Someday I'll get around to trying it with the cake. Great fruit beer - sets the standard which all others should be judged against."
"this was a year old bottle that sat in my fridge... what a fantastic turn for such a low alcohol beer. the raspberries were realistic. not candy... not dirty... or too sour. some mild earth. some pucker. really something incredible for something this low in abv. not exactly the most complex but still something worth trying absolutely."
"1196"
"Crisp body due to a moderate amount of carbonation. Semi-spritzy, but in a good way. Complements the style superbly. Flavor is unsurprisingly of tart red fruits. Tastes like a cherry cobbler in a glass. Bitterness is absent. Nice sweet finish. Though it is tart, it is not puckering in any way. Just a well-made beer here. I want this on my table for every Thanksgiving and Christmas from here on out. Highly recommend."
"D: Amazingly drinkable and possibly the most drinkable fruit beer I've had to date. It's sweet yet tart, but not overly so in either case, therefore the palate isn't fatigued and there is no alcohol flavor. This really tastes just like a perfect raspberry soda and not anything like what I would have imagined a beer could be back before my foray into craft beers."
"Since it is hard not comparing this one the Wisconsin Belgian Red, I must say that I preferred this one."
"The fact that this doesn't take Gold home from the GABF every year is an indictment of their judging system. I mean...WTF?"
"D - Can drink it all day, bottle after bottle. Normally don't go for the sweet stuff but this is just amazing."
"D - Amazingly high. Just keeps you wanting more, and never gets cloying."
"D: Great. I'd buy again. Best as a palate cleanser or dessert. But it is really nice before dinner on a hot day. A bomber is a bit much by myself."
"The mouthfeel is a little light, not a long lasting flavor. Drinkability is great, can drink this all day."
"D- A fantastic beer, shared one 750ml bottle with buddy, probably all I could have at one sitting, but the tart fresh raspberry taste is great, unique and inviting, will be a great beer to replace champagne as an instrument to a toast."
"The mouthfeel is sparkling and puckering. Beautiful. Really a phenomenal beer, I don't know how they managed to pack in these kinds of fresh fruit flavors in a beer. Highly recommended."
"The beer pours a strawberry red with plenty of visible carbonation and a pink-tinted white head. The smell is one of slight sourness accompanied by overpowering fresh raspberries. The taste is much the same with an added tartness that complements the fruity sweetness of the raspberries perfectly. The mouthfeel is one of a good dose of carbonation on a fairly light-bodied beer; not too different from champagne, but perhaps a bit less carbonation. Drinkability is about as high as can be--with 4.0% abv, I'd have no problem going all night with this one."
"Overall impression: Incredibly tasty brew, one of my favorite fruit beers. Great on its own, but also a delicious mixer for home bartending. Try it with an imperial stout or a dry champagne."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin with a mild carbonation. This is a great beer to top off a big meal. I do get a weird bland finish at the end that sort of lingers. Overall, it's very good."
"I like it - it's pretty irrestible. Yet, I was expecting to give a bunch of 4.5s and 5s. It's ultimately a little too sweet for me to elevate it to those heights. Still very good, though. I'll drink it anytime."
"(D)- What a fun and interesting beer! Never been a huge fan of fruit beers, but this one is a sure winner in my book. The sweet and sour combination create a dynamic mouthfeel and taste. Giant raspberry flavors fit the profile well. A great dessert or apertif beverage; a great crowd pleaser even for those non beer drinkers you know! I could drink this all day!"
"D- Although this is a ""dessert"" beer, I could drink this everyday. There is probably a reason why I make sure I always have a bottle of this on hand at any given time. Thank goodness I live in Wisconsin."
"Overall, a superb dessert beer by New Glarus that manages to uphold a delicate balance between sweet and tart. Doesn't taste artificial in the least and blows Lindeman's Framboise out of the water. Recommend it for a special occasion."
"D - One of the best fruit beers I have had. Very drinkable."
"New Glarus has nailed this fruit style down and produced two fine, fine beers. I think I pick this one over the Red, seemed less sweet, a little more pucker, a little less cloying - though I still think a bottle to myself would be more than enough and I would need to move on to other things - I just feel like there could be another dimension added that would make this even better, a bit more funk perhaps. The marvel of it all, though, is how they pack so much flavor and keep it under 5%. World-class beer."
"Enjoyed a bottle of this last night while camping at Great Sand Dunes National Park. Pours reddish in color with light pink head. Smells and tastes like...raspberries. Like the Wisconsin Belgian Red, what makes this good to me is that it's not too sweet. Though this is less dry than the Belgian Red in my opinion. Mouthfeel is refreshingly high in carbonation - made for a perfect post-hike beverage. Could easily drink a whole bottle of this no problem."
"D - Easy to drink and low ABV, I recommend!"
"a bit too straightforward, without other complexities showing through strongly enough. still, it is what it is - a great fruit beer."
"Overall, every now and then I get in the mood for a nice fruit beer, this hits the spot. Without a doubt, New Glarus has mastered this style. Raspberry Tart and Wisconsin Belgian Red are among the elite when it comes to fruit/vegetable beers. Thanks again Dan!"
"75cl bottle courtesy of photomike. I just want to start by saying that I can't imagine a fruit beer smelling better than this. Every time that I put my nose in the glass, a huge smile crept over my face. I love raspberry jam, and this smelled like just about the best raspberry jam ever. I have no idea how they got such a vivid and intense aroma into this beer. There is a great mix in the flavor of sweet fruit and tartness that keeps the sweetness from overrunning the drinkability. I have to day that I can't imagine the flavor keeping me captivated for ever like the aroma, but this is a superbly done fruit beer in every aspect."
"750ml bottle. Thanks Adam! Pours a slightly hazy, dark red-brown with a fluffy, pinkish head that dies after a bit. Pungent aroma of raspberries; very, very sweet. Sour notes become more noticeable as it warms. Taste is a rush of sugar and fortified raspberry. Cloying, actually. Acidity comes through to balance it a bit, but still finishes very sweetly. Raspberry Tart is a pretty fitting name for this one. The feel is light-medium, but awfully syrupy. As much as I wanted to like this one, it's just too sweet...couldn't actually finish it."
"This is a beer that I find to be really good, but I tend to buy it more as a novelty than an everyday brew. I pick these up all the time as gifts, or to share, but very rarely get one for myself, although I really enjoy it every time I have it."
"D - Drinkability is good my wife really liked this one as well. Easy to drink although I think the tartness of the taste would only to have one at a session but at the same token if I wanted something of this style would not hesitate to drink."
"D: Well, my girlfriend killed her half of the bottle in about 10 minutes all while asking for more. I was a bit more reserved but it was difficult to be so. This is incredibly fresh and clean for fruit beer. It just seems amazing as far as it falls in the fruit beer realm. Easy drinking, amazing smell, great taste. What else do you want from a beer? Incredibly well done and almost exactly what I was expecting. Simply amazing."
"D - 3.5 - it is hard to drink a lot of this because it is so sweet and tart. It is another excellent fruit beer made by New Glarus but I have to say I like the Belgian Red better from them."
"Overall, I am very impressed with this beer. It is surprisingly a big beer with a lot of flavor for how low the abv is. 4%??? That is crazy. I really like it, but I wish the nose would have been a little more flavorful. This beer is definitely worth a try. I had a hard time finishing the last 6 ounces of my bottle."
"The beer pours a nice reddish-purple color, with a kind of thin off white, maybe pink colored head. It's just a little hazy, but nice looking. The smell is very nice. Fruity and deep, not only raspberries, but also some other ripe fruits, an assortment, but the raspberries really stand out. There's also a kind of powdery malt presence, very light, a good sweetness, maybe a little bit of bread. There's also a good balance of tartness to go along with the sweetness. Very interesting. The taste really comes through well with the raspberries. You just get a mouthful of berry, almost like they're fresh-picked, a good juicy sweetness, a wonderful tartness. There not sweet and overripe tasting, but not green. The fruitiness is not really the least bit artificial. And there's also a nice powdery pilsener malt presence, not biscuity or bready, but just nice. The mouthfeel is nice, especially for 4.0%. It's kind of medium, and the sweetness makes it a bit fuller, but then that's balanced and toned down by the tartness. Really nice, and not like cough syrup. The beer is very enjoyable, and at a low enough ABV that it won't hurt you too badly. Though, I'm sure you would have some trouble drinking a bunch of it because of the intense fruit presence. I would definitely buy it more if I could, and the price was not bad, at maybe $8-9 for a 750. Definitely recommended."
"Overall I'm going to come in slightly below the average rating on here, but this is a very good beer. Given the option I am going to opt for it's Belgian Red brother every time, but this is still a damn good beer."
"D: Superb. A very nice beer. Many thanks to mnjeff for the trade!"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is low for me, due to the overpowering sweetness and strong raspberry taste. Overall, I like this one about equally as much as Belgian Red. Very good desert beer, but not one I would session. Good, not great. Skal."
"D: Very, very high. While I'm not a huge fan of lambics in general, I appreciate the craft that went into this one. It was an enjoyable beverage."
"D: A great beer to cool off with and a fine drink to serve to guests in champagne flues with a dessert."
"Well New Glarus, you got me. If I never live in Wisconsin, a good portion of my life will be spent driving there. Once again, New Glarus, you seize to amaze me."
"D. Very drinkable. This is one of the best fruit beers I have had. Very delicous."
"The taste is sweet and tangy with loads of juicy red-berry sweetness. A note of mellow, nutty yeast complements the sweet/tart berry-blast perfectly, and is probably the only indication that the drink in my hand isn't just some succulent little fruit juice cocktail. Crisply tart in the finish, the light-bodied, mildly-carbonated brew is almost soda pop-like, amazingly non-alcoholic in flavor, and highly, highly quaffable until the sweetness grows too noticeable. An incomparably excellent berry beer."
"This is a delightful beer. Cheers Troy for cracking this beaut."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. This beer deserves the high reputation it has received."
"I've not been a fan of New Glarus beers, living in WI gave me the pragmatism to be critical at times rather than to fawn. But this beer is quite good and I'd highly recommend."
"Dues to its tartness this is pretty drinkable. Makes for a great desert all by itself, but would certainly pair well with anything chocolate, especially of the darker varieties. Could also make a killer chocolate desert with this tasty brew, i may have to try this someday. This is the beer for fans of raspberry and a touch of funk."
"D: Perfect as I am sitting outside with a couple of non-BA pals. Both liked it, one loved it..but he is a wine geek, figures."
"Definitely a sipping beer! Very drinkable in small amounts - the sweet and tart flavors may get to be too much after a while though. I shared the bottle with my girlfriend and she loved it. We're both looking forward to having this again."
"Pours a deep plum color with a bright snow white head. Huge amount of visible carbonation and some thin fading lacing. Smell exactly like raspberry jam, with some sweet wheaty notes. Amazing, raspberry domination! Tastes of raspberry jam mixed with lemon sour, with small hints of vinegar. Very ""tart"" and candy-like. Thin mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Satisfying, the 750 needs to be shared in my opinion.... This would make a great dessert!"
"D: Fantastic. This is one of the best damn summer drinkers there is. Generally I don't like to drink a lot of the sweeter beers but this one seems to buck that trend for a while at least by balancing the tartness nicely. Truly world class."
"Awesome throw-in from a trade w/ raoulduke37. Split with friends last night after dinner. Pours a dark ruby red, really pretty color, little whispy pinkish head. Fizzy. Looks like soda, is all I can think of. Smell is unadulterated raspberry. So far so good, but while I dig the raspberry flavor, this is just too sweet for me. A tiny bit of tart in the finish, but I wouldn't venture to label this beer as sour at all. It's fruity, and sweet. Which if you're looking for, you're going to like this beer. Just not really my thing. A bit cloying and sugary. Wish it was a little more complex and wild tasting, a little more natural. Still and impressive brew. Big fan of New Glarus in general so I would still recommend this beer to others."
"PS - Thanks go out to PaleAl for this trade at DLD!"
"Raspberry Tart's a very good beverage. I have a tough time calling it a beer simply because it's barely recognizable as such. That being said, it is a very tasty beverage that has a really nice sweet, tart berry flavor. There's a lot to like. But, I don't love it. It's too one dimensional and after a while the sweet/tart flavors almost become too much. I passed a little of the 750 to the wife and was happy to do so. I might have trouble tackling one alone. It is a very unique and worthwhile experience that's worth seeking out. Every BA should try this one at least once."
"Picked this up as part of a trade at Dark Lord Day. Thanks Mike! To wit, this is fruit beer done correctly. Has a reddish head, tart raspberry smell and flavor, and some tangy hops to round it out. I cannot think of an ale that would appeal to non beer drinkers that I've come across. Wonderful!"
"This is probably the first ""fruit"" beer that I actually enjoyed. I would seek this out again, but obviously not an everyday type of beer."
"Possibly the best fruit beer I've ever had."
"D: Tasty especially if you're into the raspberry flavor, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, although I'm not a big lambic fan, this beer is right up there with the better lambics, sours and wine-like beers that I've had."
"D: Too sweet to drink very many."
"Drinkability is very good, given that I easily drank almost a whole 750 by myself. That being said, the sweetness and acidity, while providing an amazing natural balance, are also a bit wearing on their own. It's a great beer, but not one I'd be in the mood for all the time."
"D - This was a very drinkable dessert beer, and comparing to Lindmann's, there is no comparision, New Glarus is vastly superior"
"750 ml bottle: This one pours a murky browish-red color. Mine had a small fizzy head on it that went away almost immediately. No lacing. Nice nose. It is pretty much tart raspberry and not much else. There is a good body to it, but still a lighter mouthfeel. There is some effervescence in your mouth. The taste is mainly tart raspberries, but it is not overpowering. It is very unique. It is almost hard to classify this as a beer, but it is very good none the less. I would definitely buy this one again."
"Overall the second best fruit beer I've had to the Belgian Red which to me is perfect. We were discussing this one tonight and it's so much better than almost every other fruit beer in the world. Stunningly good."
"D - This is really rich and full of flavor. This truly is an amazing brew."
"Deep red-raspberry color with a pink head that abruptly dissipates. It has an absolutely terrific raspberry aroma. It reminds me of a raspberry pastry. It's flavor is very sweet. Almost too sweet. Has only a slight tart, sour flavor to it. The mouthfeel gives a bit of pucker and tingling sensations. Has average drinkablitily, as the sweetness becomes too much."
"D= The highest. I think this is the most drinkable beer I have ever had. I could literally drink this forever. Amazing beer all around. Not too much else to say about it. Not a fake lindeman's raspberry flavor but a real taste to it. Amazing."
"Despite it being quite sweet, I find the drinkability quite good. Like lemonade on a hot summer afternoon."
"-A rare treat worth seeking out, but don't plan on drinking it alone."
"at the very least to inject into my veins!!"
"Mouthfeel is very very tart, and this beer definitely coats the tongue. This would be a great one for a summer day when there's not too much going on."
"D - This is a dessert beer that I could probably drink before, during and after the meal. It's a bit tart to make it a session brew but I could see giving it a try. If you like this beer style, you'll LOVE this beer."
"My expectations where met."
"D: Pretty good but I could only drink so much in a session but it makes a nice sweet treat for after dinner."
"So drinkable. I'm about to finish this bottle all by myself. I will trade for this one several times just because you got to keep something interesting around for the ladies that is different from the framboise that seems to be the craze among the ladies who know nothing about beer."
"Despite its low alcohol content, I'd say this beer can hold up with a year or two of cellaring. Whether the flavor gets any better is another question, but it does remain delicious."
"D: Delicious. Refreshing. World class. Everything a Wisconsin framboise could hope to be. Enjoy."
"Might be good for a desert beer. Not something I would drink on the regular, but a pleasant surprise."
"Quite refreshing and fresh. Glad I had the chance to sample this unique beer."
"Overall: Easily the best fruit beer I've had, NG has fruits down perfect. Can't wait to try the Wisconsin Red. Well carbonated and not too strongly flavored to drink an entire bottle of IMO."
"Overall- Great drinkablility for how sour this beer is. Delicious, all the flavors work great together. I will be getting this beer again!"
"Drinkability was so/so. I liked their Belgian Red cherry beer better but this was a nice dessert beer. Thanks to Kraft for allowing me to try this!"
"Drinkability - Quite quaffable. low abv. nicely balanced."
"Pours a deep dark red with a thin half finger light pink colored head that disappears to just a ring around the the glass. Some spots cling on the sides here and there, but not much. Smell is, well...raspberries, some sour, some sweet, some overripe. Rhubarb, green apples, and cherries in there as well, great smelling bouquet of aromas. Taste is well, can you believe it...raspberries!!! A bit less sour than the aroma, but still some tartness. Gooey raspberry pie filling, great stuff. A bit dry in the finish as well. Medium body with a very crisp feel in the mouth. This is quite the treat and one that can be enjoyed by all. Very drinkable, very flavorful, and very refreshing. I have a 2007 bottle of ST Choklat I plan on blending with, hopefully it turns out as delicious as it sounds!"
"Wow! New Glarus has really set the bar high for American fruit beers. Unbelievable drinkability for this one. It's really incredible how tasty a fruit beer can."
"Pours a sexy deep ruby-red color with remarkable clarity, two-finger pink head fades into a fine foamy layer atop the beer, a few stray dots of lacing on the glass. Smell is rich, decadent raspberry madness. Tastes like a raspberry sorbet, extreme tartness creeps up on you after the swallow, and zings the back and sides of the tongue like something you'd find in your Halloween candy bag. Tartness and raspberry flavors linger on and on, very finely carbonated and refreshing...you could pair this with all kinds of desserts. Based on this, the Wisconsin Belgian Red, and the Apple Ale, I can't imagine a brewery producing better fruit beers. Just fantastic stuff."
"Poured a dark red/burgudy color with a small pink epervesant head. Aroma was sweet and raspberry was definitely the star of the show. The flavor was quite different: tartness was the king here with sweet raspberries coming in second place. Mouthfeel was smooth and light with carbonation which equals stellar drinkability. Great choice if you like raspberry jam because it's almost the same thing minus the seeds and plus a minimal amount of alcohol."
"Small rosy head quickly dissipates. Very cloudy deep burgundy color. Aroma is tart and sweet. Taste of pureed fresh raspberries and raspberry juice. Body is fairly thick. Start to finish is tangy and full of raspberry sweet/tartness. Slight bite of unripe berries at the very end. Very good fruit beer, would drink this and the Belgian Red all the time if I lived in Wisconsin."
"Mouthfeel was light a crisp...almost champagne like. Carbonation gave it a nice edge. Low abv, nice and fruity, perfect choice to show the ladies that not all beers taste like the crap they hate. Heck, show some of the guys as well."
"If you like raspberries, this beer is definitely drinkable. The tartness and sweetness come together to balance the beer out, making it rather drinkable. Glad to finally try this one, it was a pleasure."
"Drinkability: Unrivaled drinkability. I can say, quite categorically, that New Glarus Raspberry Tart is a phenomenal, incredibly delicious beer. It's a damn shame all fruit beers can't be this good."
" Thanks you new glarus, you made Juneau Alaska just a little more tolerable tonight."
"Another unique & delicious fruit beer from New Glarus. More than worthy of the acclaim it gets."
"D= Very easy to drink and very sessionable. This is probably my second favorite fruit beer behind the New Glarus Belgian Red. Highly recommended."
"This has to be the best fruit beer that I've ever tried. Having had this the Wisconsin Belgian Red is next on my list. All I can say is New Glarus is the shit."
"My wife made a comment on the rating of this and the Belgian Red and how I can rate them so high. She asked if I would rather this and that over a coffee stout or a pale ale. Fact of the matter is, these are a different breed, and bottom line is these are unique and extremely well crafted brews. Hats off!"
"This stuff is awesome - seek it out via trade if you can't hit up Wisconsin yourself."
"9/4/9/4/18 (4.4/5)"
"Overall: weak"
"This beer pours a deep ruby color with a nice pink head. The aroma is of raspberry, and hints of nuts. The taste is a bit more lively than the aroma. Tons of raspberry, and a stronger nutty character. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer, but I prefer the Wisconsin Belgian Red."
"Drinkability: This beer - which does not taste like beer - instead tastes like pie. And I really like pie. New Glarus continues to impress - nay, blow me out of the water - with their handling of fruit and beer, a marriage that, based upon how often others screw it up, seems easy to screw up. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is the best fruit beer I've ever had (the Belgian Red a reasonably close runner up). And at 4.0% abv, how can you afford NOT to down a whole bottle with ... or even AS ... dessert?"
"D: This was as tasty a fruit beer as I have come across. It tasted genuine and smooth. New Glarus is known for these and this is surely evidence of why they are."
"Poured a 25oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a magnificent deep maroon but barely produces any head whatsoever and what head it does produce quickly disappeared into a completely still beer. The aroma is amazing. It encapsulates the essence of a raspberry. Up front the aroma is a like raspberry jam, sweet and sugary but at the end the nose, the aroma becomes quite tart and it makes your nose hair tingle. The taste follows suit to a tee. Sweet raspberry hits your lips and tongue but the more you hold it in your mouth the more the sour/tartness comes through. It coalesces every aspect of biting into a fresh raspberry. The mouthfeel is light and crisp but leaves a sour twinge in your jaw and a dryness on your tongue. I wish I had a case of this on hand at all times. This beer is simply amazing."
"Overall: Its raspberry champaign, but no its still beer. My favorite fruit beer of the fruit twins from New Glarus. Elegant beer that is a simple and delicous. Share it with your lady, she will love it."
"a tasty beer. not for me i would say. im sure that my girlfriend will be pissed that i didnt save this for her. meh. good beer. but as vic said. no balls. and we all know how he likes his balls...onto the isabelle!!!"
"Overall: I usually avoid beers that are similar to this, but I was pleasantly surprised after sipping on this great gift from Mauerhan. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"The fruit beers by New Glarus are very powerful. Heavy in the mouth as well as heavy on the use of fruit. The healthy use of fruit always overpowers the flavor of the beer. But this is meant to be sipped by a fire and enjoyed for it's richness and developing complexity. This is great stuff. But it is prettyy sweet, one glass is plenty, gimme a pale ale."
"D: Big fruit flavors, floral qualities, and intense tartness/acidity creates a beer that is complex on a level that can only be sipped. To be treasured and shared. This is a beer to share for sure, drinking a 750 solo would be a challenge, but this is a beer I would buy frequently if I lived in Wisconsin. This beer can only be described as incredible."
"Another awesome fruit beer from New Glarus, this one is world class and right behind the cherry. A must try."
"D: very drinkable....a 750mL is made for sharing, especially with this one. Outstanding."
"Sample at the Super Terrific Stout Tasting on 02/16/08. This beer pours a deep ruby color with a medium and craggy white head that dissipates slowly. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. Nice bouquet of raspberries in the nose with a touch of sweet malt in the background. Medium-bodied with a juicy mouthfeel and tart raspberry (go figure) character. Touches of malt and dark cherry flavor as well. The finish is lively and fruity with an underlying sweetness. New Glarus has found the secret to making Fruit Beers that I enjoy, which is no easy feat. Very good overall."
"Overall, a very fine brew but more of a dessert beer."
"D - Drinkability is good. I must admit that I was impressed with this one. It is pure unadulterated raspberry. It actually tastes more like fruit soda than beer. Alcohol is just not present or is completely covered by other flavors. Would have been nice to get some kind of ""beer"" flavors but that just doesn't seem like the way New Glarus is wanting to go with this one. Given how sweet this beer is, I'd say split the bottle with a friend if you can. Maybe as a dessert. 750ml could be a bit much for one person."
"Mouthfeel is light, clean and biting, matches the beer well."
"Awesome stuff! I want more."
"D: Let's be honest, I could drink the entire case right now with nooo problem."
"I was very surprised by this beer, as I was not expecting it to be as good as it is. My only argument against it is that I do not feel you could drink a lot of it and it does lack some of the standard beer flavors."
"Just a magnificent use for delicious fresh raspberries. This beer/fruit wine is perfectly tart and sweet, layers of wonderful clear fruit flavor, the hops and wheat in the brew providing a complementary backbone that lets the raspberries shine. I can't think of a more perfect beverage for Thanksgiving dinner."
"If a person loves raspberries they will love this even if they don't like beer. No beer or alcoholic flavor at all. Probably best served as a dessert beverage. Too sweet for continous consumption."
"There is a limit to how much of this I could drink at once, due to sheer sweetness. But it's really an amazing dessert beer."
" If you have relatives or friends who are wary of the crazy craft brews that you drink, give them one of these to try."
"One wonders how they get all of that sweetness in there without it fermenting out --- pasteurization?"
"A wonderful treat unless you happen to hate raspberry or something. There's no reason to waste time and money on wimpy fruit beers when something like this is around. Comparable to Dogfish Head's Fort in flavor, and equally well-crafted."
"M/D - Full bodied and incredibly fruity. SMothers the mouth."
"D- 4% makes it very drinkable and it's decently unique. I'd have it again."
"Mad thanks to Richard for this wicked extra."
"D- It goes down like a shake, without being to filling."
"D - Amazing fruit beer from New Glarus that's easily as good as the Wisconsin Red. Beautiful!"
"Pours a dark crimson red/brown color with a fluffy pink head and nice lacing, into a chalice. Big wafts of fresh raspberry and not much else, but it smells fresh, fruity and interesting. Wonderful on the nose. Sweet, tart, fresh raspberry flavor, sweetness somewhat cloying, but wouldn't expect less from this style. Goes down very smooth, light on the carbonation. So sweet, I couldn't see drinking more than a glass at a time. Excellent Lambic style brew that goes great with a nice big salad on a warm summer day."
"M,D: The mouthfeel is so light and highly carbonated just as expected. The low ABV and high carbonation leaves this feeling like champagne"
"Now, if I ever get my spotted squirrel to taste..."
"Drinks really well, I believe the acidity & tartness would preclude me from sessioning on this. Easily one of the best beers at 4.0% abv, below, above or whatever! Also, easily the best fruit beer I've ever drank!"
"D: Much like the Belgian Red, the sweetness is such that drinking this whole bottle is a pretty good feat. It's a wonderful beer and New Glarus has shown the ability to nail this style."
"There is some tartness in the taste that nicely balances the sweetness of the fruit. I couldn't have too much of this but splitting the bottle with a friend works nicely. If you're up for a fruit beer, this is one to try."
"A big thanks to scoobydank for the Great BIF Race treat...go SINISTER!"
"M/D: Who couldn't love enjoying a huge amount of this beer? I saw on their site that you can get a 1/4 barrel of this. I might move to wisconsin."
"Taste is tart, sweet, dark, wonderful raspberries. A little acidic on the taste as well. Very good beer. As tough as it is to say, I think I personally prefer the Belgian Red to this. Both are incredible."
"and I hate raspberry."
"If you're ever in the midwest, do yourself a favor and bring back as much of this and the Wisconsin Red as you can."
"Don't spill it...it's gonna stain!"
"The beer pours a cloudy burgundy-purple with a pink head that dissipates to a ring leaving some nice lace. The smell is sweet raspberries, along with a touch of barnyard funk. The taste is once again full of very sweet raspberries but is balanced a bit by some pleasant tartness and again brings a touch of barnyard at the end. The beer is full bodied with lively carbonation. Very sweet is the biggest detraction to drinkability, but still one heck of a fruit beer."
"Is this my favorite beer in the world? No. Can I find any fault with it? No. In my eyes, a fruit beer simply cannot get any better than this."
"D- Perfect for after dinner but I could not drink more than one bottle. its a very sweet Lambic."
"Drinkability is ok. I've never been a fan of a lot of fruit beers because well... like this one, they often don't taste like beer. And I definitely wouldn't want to drink a lot of this. But it is very interesting, and very tasty. Well worth a try."
"D - One of the better labics I have tried. Not really a big fan of the style, but this one did not disappoint."
"D- a great choice served chilled on a warm summer night."
"definitely recommended! BTW my wife loved the sample i shared with her."
"750 ml/$12.99/Wine Specialist"
"HV"
"What a beautiful beer! Pours dark ed with a really nice head. Massive raspberry in the nose with the fruit coming through loud and clear and some seediness giving some more tannic notes to the aroma. The taste is sweet/tart with laser-like raspberry fruit flavor and some sweet malt. Really amazing. Super creamy and smooth in the mouth, this is a joy to the drink. Although it is somewhat of a one-note wonder, that note is clean, pure, sustained, and brilliant."
"Drinkability- As this beer warms it becomes quite a bit different. The girlfriend loved it cold and I preferred it a bit more as it warms. I honestly didn't know what to expect with this beer and what I got blew me away. For the most part it's really easy drinking and goes down smooth as silk. It can get a bit raspberry-e after a while but that is about the only negative."
"I dig it!!!"
"Drinkability is moderate, very high on the sweet and tart factor that is hard to handle in large quantities, best enjoyed with friends in smaller sipping glasses or after dinner"
"Bottle (25 oz.): This poured bright red to purple in color with a bubbly head. The raspberry is strong in both the nose and palate with nice sweetness but is also quite fresh and tart. This is very refreshing and a great summertime brew if not the most complex."
"I honestly could drink this all day every day and I would find it impossible for anyone not to like this. ABV is nonexistent. This is truly a beer to behold. Thanks again nflmvp and glad this was number 500!"
"Murky dark reddish brown. Fantastic aroma of what else? Raspberries, also some faint sour notes. Taste of sweet, but not overly sweet raspberry puree. Slightly tart finish. Boardering syrupy mouthfeel, with just enough carbonation. Very refreshing brew. Paired sublimely with homemade cheesecake after Mother's day dinner. Really glad I got to try this."
"The mouth-feel is very soft and well carbonated, neither thin by the amount of carbonation nor syrupy from the amount of sweetness. Extremely easy to drink but it could get too sweet for some people. One of the best dessert beers out there."
"I wish I had a case of it."
"Mildly carbonated, tart acidity feels very juicy. Pretty drinkable if you don't mind the sweetness."
"Poured form the wax sealed bottle into a Sam imperial glass. Intense magenta cloudy color. Definitely not a color I can say I have had in a beer ever. Smell- Rasberry!!! Rasberry mixed with chambord and more rasberry. Flavor is of a Rasberry slush puppy, just better! Completely different than anything I have had (and I have had the belgian red and loved it). great flavor, but I am glad I shared this one!"
"Well, on a night when I just had the best IPA that I've ever tried (Alesmith IPA), I've now had the best fruit beer that I've ever had. And this ain't even close. My wife is begging me to acquire some more of this one and there's no doubt that I will. Kudos to New Glarus for an incredible brew that definitely lives up to the hype..."
"New Glarus has an amazing fruit beer here - one of the best I've had and I've had a few. Raspberry Tart is simply world-class and you should try it. You'll cry when the bottle is empty, but it must be done!"
"Pours a thick and cloudy purply rosy red with a light pink kriek lambic like head. Nose is fresh raspberry and sweet tart. Taste abounds in fresh red raspberries. Super sweet at first, and a very nice tart flavor on the finish. This feels like it should have seeds in it still. like raspberry sorbet! Mouthfeel is pretty much what you would expect, not too thin like alot of fruit beers tend to be. Great drinkability, but the sweetness prevents me from having more than a glass. A very very good concoction from New Glarus. Looking forward to trying more of their beers, especially the belgian red and the unplugged series. Fantastic fruit beer. I think I will break the other bottle out next time a have a lady in the house! Bow chicka bow wow!"
"Happy I got the opportunity to try this one. I think I might try to get another bottle, if someone in WI is nice enough."
"The ABV is quite manageable and this is awesome stuff. Surprisingly it's quite filling! Can imagine only 1 or 2 per sitting to enjoy and savor. Excellent!"
"D-Delectable. It is clear that New Glarus only put in the best ingredients available."
"Anyway, pours out a dense purple and blood red color, with a small pink head. Nose is raspberry jam and malts. Taste is wonderful very sweet zesty wild raspberry pie, with dense honey flavors and almost a spicy zing to it. Malts come through, and it ends up almost like a mead. Mouthfeel is food. Drinkability is fantastic, it's like a sessionable sweet beer."
" If it was in smaller bottles and more available to me I would love to try cooking with this brew"
"Thanks to both kmpitz2 & Pitmonkey for temporarily satisfying my gluttony. :)"
"There isn't much to describe here. As advertised, this tatstes like a raspberry tart. It has the color of blended raspberries, and it pours with a thin, pink, fizzy, head. The fruit flavor tastes incredibly fresh and not in the least artificial. This is a very refreshing change of pace."
"Pours a rich dense and hazy blood red with a lasting pinkish hued head in a flute-like glass. Smell is strong sour raspberries and sugar, and somewhat jam like. Taste is intensely sweet and almost as tart in the mouth. Very fruity, and drinks more like a thick raspberry soda or alcopop than beer, but still has elements of malted grains behind the huge raspberry sweetness. Strong flavor, and syrupy, but the mild mouth puckering tartness helped balance it out enough for me to really enjoy a couple glasses. Still easily one of the sweetest beers I've had, but I tend not to mind that too much."
"The taste is overwhelmingly raspberry. If you're sharing the bottle, that's a good thing, but if you're drinking it by yourself, a bit overwhelming. It's a sweet beer, and the carbonation helps cut down on the overload, but it can be a bit much. The raspberry taste is pretty much overwhelming."
"Reddish-purple, cloudy, with a thin head when pured that dissipates fast. The raspberrys in the aroma are awesome, and they carry over to the flavor. It is tart, maybe acetic, but in a most refreshing way. It is smooth as silk in the mouth, with a crisp finish. I think I get a little bit of anise aftertaste. The low alcohol makes this highly drinkable. It's really refreshing!"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Fresh raspberries, syrupy sweet but never cloying. Juicy and thick, yet remarkably refreshing. The finish is puckering and mildly sour, but ultimately clean."
"D-Crazy good...but you had best love raspberries...that is all this is, and it does it oh so very well!"
"I'm feeling lucky I got to try this beer, but because of the effort involved getting it, I doubt I'll be having another for a while."
"Daughter luved it, but wow, I don't think I could do more than a glass or two, but that's the way of the fruit beers. So it has a nice taste that I couldn't do very much of in a session."
"D:Great desert beer. The sweetness cuts down the drink ability for me a little bit but this is a great treat."
"I did not really enjoy this as a beer. If it were bottled as a non-alcoholic raspberry cider, I would have believed it. IMO, it was a syrupy overrated mess, only slightly better than the WBR."
"The body is sweet with a lot of residuals. The sweetness almost has a unattenuated feel to it. Makes it difficult to really drink a whole lot of. Carbonation is low. Although I enjoyed this beer for its unique qualities, I can't shake the wine cooler aspect of the beer. It is suppose to be a beer right?"
"D- This is by all means a dessert beer & one to split with a few folks. The raspberry & tart are so intense as to prevent quick consumption. This one lives up to the hype."
"This beer pours a dark ruby/purple like color and is fairly opaque with one finger of pink head sitting on top that receeds with no real lacing. The aroma is delicious, reminds me of raspberry jam. Strong ripe raspberry notes. The taste is pretty good. Ripe raspberry, slightly sweet too. I thought it would start to be a little cloying but did not seem to be that way. Some nice tart notes as well. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, slightly syrupy, and gently carbonated. Drinkability is high due to great flavors and low alcohol. It makes for a good dessert type beer. I will however recommend that this beer be shared with at least one other person, preferably more. I openned it to share with my girlfriend and she didn't want any. So I had to take out the 750 and found myself tired of it and slightly annoyed by the end. It was good, but by the end I was craving a more substantial beer. Had to have a weizenbock."
"Looking forward to tasting the Wisconsin Belgian Red next."
"Pours a very cloudy red ruby with a pink, quickly dissapearing head. It looks like a weiss head got stained on its way being poured through all the raspberries that my nose is telling me this is chock full of. Raspberry first, with a sour note among strawberries. Bit o' yeast. Remarkable flavor - thick on the raspberries as one might expect, but in no way one-note. The inital cranberry taste threw me off a touch but blends into cooked raspberries, as if baked into a pie (or tart, duh), followed by fresh picked berries surrounded by a tart flemish red quality and cherries. The sourness practically curls back up the tongue with the help of light carbonation after working its way to my throat, leaving the taste of raspberry seeds to linger. The mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy intially but fades of the tongue quite quickly. I'd describe it as dry if the sweetness weren't keeping my tongue feeling pleasantly coated. As to drinkability, its not something i could drink every day but would be thrilled to have this available to me locally. A fantastic dessert beer and something I'd love to serve to friends who aren't into beer. Huge thanks to mully for the bottle, wish I hadn't gotten ahead of myself and downed the Belgian Red already, want to review it in light of this one. Both phenomenal."
"D:Great!!! Could sit down and have with before dinner, with dinner or after dinner. With a meal or without, this is a great beer."
"Thank you to my friend, Unclejedi, for including this in a trade of ours while in Asheville NC after the Winter Warmer Festival 2008."
"Poured a murky, dark red with a thick, dark pinkish red cap. The foam settled to a thin skim and solid collar of soapy bubbles, leaving lots of spotty lacing on the glass. Smelled of fresh raspberries - when I closed my eyes that's all I could think of. Even the aroma of earthy seeds was captured. The flavour was heavy on fresh raspberry character too, but with added complexity. It started on the sweet side with balanced tartness slowly taking over. There seemed to be a bit of grainy malt just at the edge of perception along with a mild, mellow spicy character. Earthy raspberry seeds and tartness lingered in the finish. Full bodied with a little stickiness, carbonation was lively yet contributed a smoothness to the texture. Finished on the dry side. Great stuff and super drinkable. Definitely world class."
"A ton of carbonation sticking to the edges of the glass at first creates an inch of tan head that fades to a skim in just a couple of minutes. Body is a very deep brown with a bit of a murky hue. A fragrent nose brings about thoughts of raspberry chewy candy and a bit of candied malt. Enters the mouth with a long creamy tart feel. Notes of crisp apples, fresh raspberries, and even end a nice mellow malty sweetness is faint on the end of the palate. A very lengthy fresh sour feel is prominate on the finish and creates a pleasant mouthfeel. I speak a lot of the sour and tartness of this beer but it is not to harsh but well balanced with a touch of woodsy malt sweetness. Enjoyable for the style but drinkability says I still need to share the bottle with a friend. Another beer for the sour, tart brew fans."
"Drinkabiltiy: Very tasty and very accessible. The wife really enjoyed this one as well. Not the kind of thing you would drink several of, but a very tasty treat on a special occasion. Very tasty and sweet."
"Like any good lambic, this can be enjoyed all day long. Pair well with fine cheese. Best lambic outside Belgian and one of the best anywhere."
"Heavy but smooth mouthfeel and definitely full-bodied. Decent levels of carbonation. Once again, the balance here is awesome and keeps the sweetness from hindering the drinkability. The thick and what eventually becomes somewhat syrupy mouthfeel, however, does."
"I really like the melted wax on the top of the btl. Warning this is not Lindemans in any way!"
"Body is quite full, making this an epic dessert beer. The carbonation helps carry the balancing tartness through the palate. A delightful beer that's really easy to drink."
"Wow, what an insanely good fruit beer! The sweet fruit tones are very in your face but are kept in line perfectly by its tart and hoppy character. This was my first beer from New Glarus but by God, it won't be my last. Fantastic!"
"Overall: I came expecting raspberries, but i think it was too much. I wanted to like it but in the end, not so. It's a very well-crafted brew no doubt. Not sure if tartness was too much but there was no sweetness which made it difficult to finish. Smell & initial taste were the best features. I think this would be better served as a small 8 oz. bottle (maybe available?) but i don't think i would seek it out again."
"M&D - all other brewers who attempt a fruit beer should bow at the altar and New Glarus. between this and the Belgian Red they must have sold their souls for fruit beer perfection, dont worry about critiqueing this beer just enjoy it, its so easy too"
"Pours a dark red with an off-white head with some pink hues, short retention, but good lacing. Smells just like raspberry jam, with a hint of wheat. Taste (surprisingly) is loaded with raspberries, with a good fizzy carbonation. There's a light hop presence followed by a nice sour and tart finish. Medium in body with great carbonation that is pleasing on the tongue. Definitely a dessert beer that I could enjoy quite often."
"I tend to cork these bottles and drink them slowly over a day or two. Better yet, I share them. As drinkable as a small glass is, I don't think I'd even want to drain a bottle in one sitting. Great stuff."
"Appearance is red, with a short white head and no lacing to be seen. Aroma is good, nice tart raspberry, not malty at all. Taste is tart raspberry and that really is it, too tart. Over carbonated, almost like a soda very thin . I may have had my first and last of this beer(?) although I am sure I will try it again as my wife really enjoyed it."
"Poured some leftover around French Vanilla Ice Cream. Used a splash in salad dressing."
"A fantastic beer for people who like fruit flavored and/or sour beers. Excellent raspberry flavor, quite sour as sip rolls across the tounge. Not my taste, but a well made beer."
"You could sit down with this one in the spring, summer and fall for a refreshing treat on a warm day. I would also haul this one out to have in the winter to make me think that there are berry days ahead. In other words, this is a good brew for all year round and at 4% ABV you can drink the whole bottle."
"Had a long finish. Good dessert beer. Well worth tracking down a bottle."
"D: Damn! This is so good! Tastes very natural and drinks perfectly."
"Pours from a champagne bottle into a wide mouth glass. A pinkish red color with a medium pinkish white head. A tiny bit frothy in the head; good carbonation in this beer! The smell is clearly raspberry; the flavour as well. This taste slightly sweet and goes down well."
"Pours a pink-ish red color with a small pink head. In the aroma, dry raspberry and a small sour funkiness. In the taste, sour raspberry and a dry pucker feeling. A small sour fruitiness in the mouthfeel and a dry sour raspberry aftertaste. Kind of like pie filling, nice sour and sweet fruit contrasts."
"The finish is all raspberry for me and it lingers on with a long aftertaste. Boy, am I happy I was able to get this in a trade...thanks again, Joe!!!"
"D- This is definitely less than drinkable because of the extreme sweetness but under the right circumstances I would easily drink a couple champagne flutes of this awesome brew."
"Now it is big, so I can very easily recommend that you share with a friend. I drank this late at night and couldn't finish the entire bottle (a travesty I know -- but I got close!). As it can definitely be classified as a case of too much of a good thing, when it comes time to drink the last bottle, I'll make sure there's a buddy on hand. If not, I need to make sure I have a full hour available to tackle the sweet onslaught of one of the finest fruit beers I've had to date."
"Body is medium, playfully carbonated and slippey sweet. Infinately drinkable and I will pine for it until I am lucky enough to revisit this beautiful American fruit ale."
"D - I think more than a flute and a half of this would be too much for me, and I have a sweetooth. The 750ml size might be a little bit of overkill, but find four friends, and enjoy..."
"M/D: It's very spritzy but does have a certain smoothness to it, for a really light beer. The carbonation is very fine. I like sour, I can't take a certain amount of acidity though and this seems to be just around that line. Very good to drink a few ounces here and there, but I couldn't really see myself wanting much more than that."
"Pours a cloudy reddish purple with a pinkish white head that disappears quickly. Smell and taste is raspberries, raspberries, raspberries. Mouth feel is a little sticky, syrupy with moderate carbonation. Has a tart bite to the aftertaste. Descent brew, kind of a mix between a beer and a wine cooler."
"Brought this beer back from a recent trip to Madison. Awesome beer to drink on a Sunday afternoon (when you're recovering from a hangover) or as an aspertif. Pours a dark red into my wine glass. Smells of tart raspberries. Taste is the same. Wished that I could taste a little more of the hops to balance it out, but it is still very tasty. Mouthfeel is light, making this a very drinkable ale."
"Pours a deep red color, almost opaque, with a thin fizzy pale rustic red head that is gone in a flash. The smell, while not being all that forward, is all about fresh raspberries. The mouth feel is well carbonated with a 'no apologies' tartness that is married with an offsetting sweetness that really puts the entire package well within my personal drinkability zone. I had all but sworn off Fruit/Vegetable Beers before sampling both New Glarus products. Full flavored, attention getting levels of sour character with pancake-topping levels of fruit flavor. That complexity alone is off the hook. At 4% ABV it's a really wonderful drinker."
"Big thanks to the greatest trader, NFLMVP, Prosit MK"
"Enjoyed over the summer, during a lazy trip through Wisconsin, review is from notes. Large green bottle with that classy waxed top. Bottle shows no freshness or vintage dating. Pours dark amber, with a short lived head and only minor lacing to be observed. Fruity, smoky and SOUR nose. Pleasingly tart brew, not for everybody, but to my taste buds this stuff makes a fine desert brew for those of us into this type of creation. Rich raspberry notes. Tasty and well worth seeking out if in the Wisc. general area."
"Drinkability- Wow, I wonder if this would have been better fresh. I would love to get my hands on another of these. Will have to get it via trade though. Hat's off to New Glarus!! Thanks for this one Steven."
"Recommended even though it is expensive, I think about ten dollars a bottle, I am not generally a fan of fruit beers, but this one was good, not bad for my first New Glarus brew, still got a Wisconsin Belgian Red in the fridge, would drink again if I got the chance"
"Overall: First of all I really like this one. The aroma and taste is subpurb. It is a finely crafted beer that everyone should search out. I actually like the Beligan Red just a tick better than this one, but that is not to slight this gem in any way. It is a wonderful beer more than deserving of its top 100 ranking."
"Now lets talk a little bit about this one for a minute. I have been wanting to try this forever, and I just recently received not one, but two bottles of this brew. I really did not know what to expect going into it, but have heard it is simply outstanding. So needless to say the red wax coated 750 beckoned me from the start and I popped one open last night. Poured a very nice raspberry colored red with a small pink colored head and very nice carbonation visible throughout the session. The smell was rich with raspberry essence. Extremely strong so that nothing else could possibly come through. Now the flavor was to die for. I have never been the biggest fan of fruit beers in general, but this has just come to a whole new level. So sweet yet tart and sour at the same time, the flavor was so strong, yet not overpowering and not too sweet as to make you sick, it was in a word, perfect. It had the most perfect taste for this style I could have ever imagined. A great light body and great carbonation made it feel like water and there was just no hint of any kind of alcohol in this. This was by far one of the best brews I have ever had. I was raving mad about this all night long and easily killed the bottle myself. I just did not think anything could taste this good, this was fantastic. I would love to get my hands on as much as I could, I have to give it up here. This is one of the best drinks I have ever had, hands down, just wonderful. I would have to recommend this to everyone, go and get some!"
"Pours a cranberry/raspberry crimson with a big frothy pink highlighted head that forms in cascading fashion and dies slow with lacing. Smells of juicy, ripe, delicious raspberries! Taste as it smells. Really nothing to say other than someone took some of the best raspberries, squeezed the juice out of them and somehow hid some alcohol in there. Makes you pucker in delight! I love sour stuff, I love beer, I love this beer. Thicker than I thought it would be in the mouth without much carbonation. An absolute delight, but drinkability is limited to being full, such as drinking a bunch of cranberry juice. Definitly worth a try."
"A dark red, almost bloody color with no head what so ever. It had a very strong odor of raspberries, go figure. The taste was powerful, very, very strong raspberry taste. The feel was kind of syurpy to me, but I don't drink many fruit beers. I would have this again, it is somewhat of a Kool-aid for grownups."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, and leaves a thick coating in my mouth after each sip, and the drinkability is really good, as the beer is just disappearing before my eyes."
"Light bodied with insane carbonation, slight pucker from the tartness of this. It tastes great, but it's too carbonated and tangy for me to drink lots of."
"D- huge for a really tart drink"
"As it turns out, this one might be worth aging awhile...give it a shot if you're fortunate enough to have easy access. I'd love to do a side-by-side. A follow up with New Glarus revealed an expected shelf life of two years."
"Simply amazing looking beer-betwen the deep reddish color and the beautiful pink head it is very hard to believe this is actually a beer. Simply gorgeous. Fruity and somewhat spicy aroma-I think the spiciness comes from thet heavy fruit more then anything. Big malt and fruit flavor-tart and sweet and very, very refreshing. The rasberry character really stands right out. For all the sweetness up front it finishes quite dry and tart. Great body for such a low abv beer. Overall what can I say-just a great, great beer. It is almost hard to call it a beer from the fruit flavor it has. I have to knock it down a hint for the simple fact that it comes across like a sparkling wine and I dont know if I could do it all night. Amazing stuff."
"This is an enjoyable, sweet beer. If I may say so, this would be the perfect end to a light summer meal served with some plain or walnut short-bread. Pair it with a salad or some crusty bread for a winning combo. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family though it would be a real hit with the younger crowd and many of the ladies."
"Raspberry Tart would be a fantastic beer to accompany a meal. Would compliment many pork, and bold poultry dishes. I would not hesistate to serve this beer in place of wine, even to those who do not like beer. It would also pair well with many desserts (especialy chocolate)."
"I generally don't like raspberries or tartness, but this is incredibly well-crafted."
"Got in a trade with jeffkrenner - thanks! Poured from a 750ml bottle with a wax seal and story about the beer on the label. No dating info. The color was a dark ruby red. It had almost no head and that was gone in a blink of an eye. No lacing. The aroma was obviously heavy on raspberries but you could also smell the oak from the barrels. Also had a bit of a ""wine"" smell to it. The taste was really good and not too raspberry as I feared it might. I like raspberries but find that too much is not a good thing. The only downside to the taste and mouthfeel was that it was so tart that each drink made me pucker up a bit. Not enough to be annoying but close. For that reason, I've got the Belgian Red rated a little bit higher. Overall, an incredible beer that you've got to try. Gonna have to find a regular source for this especially since the wife claims half of each bottle. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"Got her in the mail in a trade with umustdrink. Shared this with family after a nice BBQ on a surprisingly coolish Hotlanta evening. Pours a lovely, ruby red with a nice fizzy head. Of course she had an aroma of raspberry, with a full sour mouthfeel. I still cannot get over how balanced this beer was...and I don't even like raspberries! The wheat must balance out the tartness, because the tartness really does not blow you away. One truly exceptional beer."
"Drinkability: Great, great, great. I wish I didn't wait so long to crack open this bottle and I wish I picked up more than one. For those who complain this doesn't taste like beer, just take this for what it is and realize that not all beer tasted like just malt and hops."
"Raspberry Tart is as enjoyable as it is hard to get. If you live in WI and are near New Glarus, I'm definitely jealous! I'm glad to have been able to experience this beer."
"Pours a nice cloudy deep red color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy head, leaves some small islands and some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, nice touch of raspberry, spices, and some caramel. The taste is tangy, slightly bitter, raspberry a plenty, malty, and some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very tasty brew from New Glarus, highly recommended."
"It was very drinkable when I only sipped it slowly. If I drank large mouthfuls or sipped back to back it became too sweet to my palate to enjoy."
"The raspberry flavor dominates, tastes delicious, and has a perfect tart balancing kick, but this beer is just too hard to drink. Really, I suggest splitting a bottle with at least 3 people. It was fantastic paired with some good vanilla bean ice cream for dessert, but I still had a lot left after and naturally I can't let it go to waste, but it's a bit of a chore to drink. Damn tasty, but bring friends."
"drinkability is great. the alcohol is almost completely hidden, and the light sweetness is balanced well against the bit of tart/sour character. very enjoyable."
"Pours a ruddy red/brown, big thick pinkish brown head forms, settles down to a thin layer quickly, leave some nice spotty lacing on the glass, good retention, looks pretty nice. Smell is fantastic, fresh raspberry juice, caramel, bit of floral bouquet, brown sugar, more raspberry, tons of fruity goodness. Taste is sour raspberries, sugar, caramel, very earthy, sweet/sour raspberries, raisiny toffee, some bread, wicked good. Mouthfeel is light bodied, low carbonation, silky silky smooth, very refreshing, goes way too fast. Just an amazing beer. Thanks a ton Chris! This made my evening."
"Drinkability - too sweet for any session, but a special treat anytime. Sure to be a hit for sweet/fruit beer fans (A definite hit with the missus). Thanks to Erdinger2003 for this great beer!"
"Deep red hue with little to no head. Extremely fragrant and smells of..well..Raspberries. Heavily. Mayb e a touch of yeastiness. Great taste for a fruit beer. My favorite yet. Great pure raspberry taste with some sourness as well. Overall this was my favorite fruit beer yet. I'm more into stouts and heavier beers, but this was a great change of pace."
"Light body, not as bubbly as I would think. Pretty simple, and it is exactly as advertised, raspberry. Very enjoyable. This would be a super dessert beer."
"I want more."
"Definitely one you have to try!"
"Crisp at first and then finishes clean. It IS a raspberry beer, so it's not the kind of beer you can easily pair with a variety of foods or can drink all night. Still, it's exceptional in just about every way."
"Ruby red color with a light pinkish head leaving excellent lacing. Rich smell of tart raspberries; reminds me a lot of the raspberry Jell-o my grandma used to make. Raspberries lightly pucker in your mouth, it's really like eating raspberries fresh, only in liquid form. The amount of tartness is perfect, not overly acidic like how some raspberry framboise's can be; sour, without the harsh. Carbonation dances on the tongue, enhancing each flavor. Medium bodied, finishes a bit dry. Incredibly drinkable, if this was in a nonic pint glass, I'd probably end up polishing off the bottle in no time."
"Pours a nice big head (fills the flute and almost goes flows over) that doesn't go away and leaves a rock solid lacing. The color is a beautiful clear dark red/purplish color. The smell is just like a fresh raspberry bush-only better! Really good smell of sweet/tart raspberries that balance perfectly! The taste is a burst of great flavor and it doesn't have the base feel that is malty, I can sense it's still there, but I have to look. The mouthfeel is smooth, smooth and there's nothing offensive about it. Overall I wish every single bottle of Raspberry Tart was this good, I just had to re-review it it was sooo good."
"The raspberries really hit you up front with the first sip. Not cloyingly sweet at all though. It really is the right amount of sweetness. Nice spritzy and leads to a rather full mouthfeel. Fairly tart, but not overly so. Although it has some characteristics of a flemish sour, it definitely is not a sour beer. Overall a very good beer. I'm not a big fruit beer person, but I could drink this regularly. It would pair well with a slice of chocolate cheesecake."
"Poured out a dark purple, with a thin white film. The nose is explosive fresh raspberry, some sourness, a tiny bit of yeast. The taste is amazing! Wow, big fresh raspberries that hit you with a sour bite. I would love to have this with some chocolate cheese cake. Has a tight prickly mouthfeel and is insanely drinkable."
"The low down: there is not much to say about this beer, except it is my favorite fruit beer I have ever tried. The only thing that comes close is New Glarus's Belgian Red. This beer is like you went out and picked a bucket full of raspberries, and squashed the juice into a bottle. It really does taste like you just picked them, I wanted to pick the little raspberry hairs out of my teeth. The sourness keeps it from being too cloying, but it's not some something you would want to drink all day. Outstanding, to be searched out."
"Taste is exactly as advertised. Tart on the tongue and full of real raspberry goodness. The yeast is the only flavour distracting from the berries, in fact the best way to describe the flavour of this beer is raspberry jam on toast. Very pleasant. Sweet but never cloying, as a fruit beer should be. The mouthfeel is very much like sparkling wine, and the finish is puckering and dry. Low ABV makes it very drinkable, but I'd hesitate to have more than a glass after dinner. Drinkability for me personally suffers because I find it's giving me heartburn, but that's my stomach for ya. All in all an exceptionally well done fruit beer and will not disappoint those looking for an after dinner treat that's not cloyingly sweet. Hey, that rhymed!"
"Medium-dark ruby red edges around a black cherry body. Lacy, tight, dirty pink head. Nose is tart raspberries, raspberry candy, vinegar, and a little barnyard. Mostly tart and sweet raspberries though. Tart edges around the palate with sugary ripe raspberry sweetness bursting through. Crescendoes and quickly turns sour. Slightly puckering. Fresh raspberry juice taste stays through the acidic, tart, wild finish. Very nice balance of sweet and sour, with a notable flash of funk. Moderate body with a zippy, refreshing carbonation that goes well with the sparkling, appetizing acidity of this beer. Dan sure knows how to make a fruit beer!"
"Really nice drinkability, but I'm glad I split this up. Its a good beer, but I couldn't have handled the full 750. I can only handle so much sweetness, and while this one isn't over the top with sweetness its still a lot to handle for me."
"Thank You bschmid3 for this and all other New Glarus beers you GAVE to me."
"Sweet raspberry with a tart ending. Very full and up front flavors. Nothing is holding back on this beer. Large amounts of raspberry puree. RS is perfect at around 3.5% (just guessing). Finishes fruity with good length. Nicely carbonated. Not a big fruit beer fan, however this one is drinkable all day and then some."
"Cheers!"
"D: The ale is quite tasty, if not overwhelmingly sweet. Don't look for a lambic edge here, as it doesn't exist. Enjoy the sweetness for what it is, a pleasant berry fruit beer."
"D: You can drink this stuff in a hurry and enjoy it all the way. This being my first fruit beer, I didn't quite know what to think, but I do believe this is exactly what the brewery intended. If you like raspberries and beer, you should have no problem loving this."
"Served out of a bomber on New Year's Eve into a champagne flute. Pours out a beautiful rich red with a pink head. Smell - WOW. What a nose of raspberry! That nose continues into a kick ass blast of raspberry in the taste. Tart, and sour and sweet at the same time. Medium level of carbonation. I don't think they could have nailed it any better for the style. I poured a flute for the wife as well to celebrate the night. It was wasted on her as she just couldn't handle the taste. Very surprising and disapointing, but what are you going to do? For a woman that's been fed Surly Furious, Hop Slam and Stone Ruination, you'd think she would appreciate the tartness for what it is. No matter, more for me. I wish there was someone else in the house I could share this with. I won't chance corking and trying tomorrow- I will just have to bite the bullet and finish myself. I am enjoying this much more than the belgian red, but I think that's just because I like raspberries over cherries."
"Goes great with cheesecake in my opinion and definatly one of my favorite raspberry beers."
"I served it in my Lindemans Flute. I dark red to purple with a very fizzy pink head. Enormous raspberry nose. Sweetart. A rush of raspberry sweetness with a tongue clinching tart finish. Reminiscent of Jolly Ranchers. Medium body. Bubbly. Can a man get a piece of friggin cheesecake."
"Another great NG."
"This is a truly special brew. It's no session beer, as one glass contains enough pleasure and torment for your palate during the course of an evening. I wish that this were more accessible to me, as this one would always be in my stock and ready to go at a moment's notice."
"Thanks to Stonecrusher for including this in one of his metric assloads of beer."
"D- This beer has a big juicy fruit flavor and it is all fruit. There are not a lot of other flavors but there is good depth to the fruit. It would be nice to have some other flavors to balance the sweetness of the fruit."
"Perfect to accompany a Sunday Brunch."
"D: Everything about this beer is pretty much as expected. Very good all-round, but also one-dimensional. Recommended."
"More like drinking a fruit juice than like drinking any other fruit beer, other than their own cherry beer. Huge raspberry flavor and aroma. Nice deep rich red color. Very, very drinkable. The perfect beer to give to a girl who says that they don't like beer, but why bother wasting such a good beer on a girl that you shouldn't be going out with in the first place."
"Damn does this taste great. A little tartness and a little sweetness. Neither fighting for dominance ... both uniting to please the taster. This beer to me seems to be something that anyone could enjoy. As long as you like raspberries that is."
"very similar to the belgian red, with raspberries sitting in for the cherries. as i said about the belgian red, this one's very good, and a nice dessert, but i prefer my beers to be a little more beer-like."
"D: Great flavor - a wonderfully refreshing sipper. Next time I get some of this, it's getting paired with dessert (I'm think chocolate) without a doubt. A very special beer - highly recommended."
"Shared a bottle of this with some friends last night and everyone loved it. We had it with two types of cheesecake. We also mixed some Razz Tart with Young's Double Chocolate Stout to create a fabulous beer dessert. This beer has an enchnating red color with a pinkish head that fizzles away rather quickly. Sourness and raspberry sweetness dominate the aroma. A burst of raspberry flavor comes first, followed quickly by the tart and sour mouth sensations. The sourness is what makes this beer so drinkable and gives it some balance. Without the tartness this beer would not get the high marks it receives around the world. At GABF this is one of the first beers to run out. The body is medium light with the fruit providing something for the tongue to latch on to. The CO2 level is medium high; perfect for the style. The finish is sour and not overly fruity; not cloying at all. Basically, if you want a great fruit beer to go with anything chocolate or as dessert, do yourself a favor and get a bottle of this."
"One of my favorite things of the Tart and Red.. the bottle. Wax dipped and really cool labels. Anywho, into a pint glass, pours red, can it be that red? With pinkish head that kind of fizzles out, just lookin at it you know its going to be tasty. Aroma is a giant heap of rasberry goodness, the kind that you wouldn't mind smelling for the next half hour, very nice sweet/tart balance. Rasberries are by far my favorite fruit, and I'm just overjoyed so far. And then, you taste... perfection. I'll state is simply: there is no way to improve this beer. None. Falling under the category 'party in the mouth,' captures the very essence of the sweet yet tart rasberry, rivaling anything coming out of Belgium, and a real treat for that special occasion. The mouth is great, silky smooth but with a fizzy carbonation, full body, very nice. All in all, I wish I had some fudge or Belgian chocolates to eat with this, but even on its own an exceptional beer, worth all its praises."
"After having the Wisconsin Belgian Red, I had high hopes for the Raspberry Tart, and it did not disappoint. New Glarus definitely has this style pegged, and nobody does it better. A wonderful change-of-pace or dessert beer."
"I don't know what else to say. I've used just about every adjective for 'great' that I can think of and I still feel that my ramblings have been inadequate to describe the... uh... greatness of Raspberry Tart. I hope this beer keeps as well as I think it does because I'll be clearing out Madison the next time I make the trip. Simply stunning."
"A rush of raspberry aroma gushes out the moment you open the bottle. Pours a lovely, almost blood-like, dark red. The aroma is almost intoxicating in a good way. Taste is wonderful. SO much raspberry and just the right bit of tartness. It's balanced by a nice sweetness as well. Finishes dry and sweet. Carbonation is just right. Isn't as tart as say, a lindemanns framboise and that's a good thing. Very drinkable. Great as a dessert beer."
"D: Drinkability would ultimately be average, as you couldn't drink more than 2 pints, or roughly 1 bottle by yourself in a single session. While its a fantastic beer, it's inherently a single glass or two beer. Enjoy the fruits of New Glarus, as this is one of the best fruit beers available anywhere today!"
"Thanks, murrayswine, for the opportunity and to FlandersNed, for the chance to taste a 4 year old version"
"The bottle is great with the wax cap and great description of the contents. Appearance is purplish/red with some transparency at the edges. Smell is 100% rasberry and nothing wrong with that. Taste is rasberry with some bitterness and very little carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth with a dry finish. Drinkability would probably be limited to one bottle not due to the alcohol but the sweetness. This would be great for a sunday morning brunch ."
"Thanks dhchatfield for the bottle."
"I could drink this all night. I must say, this one sat in my cellar for nine months and that too a bit of the tart edge off. I highly recommend sitting on this one for a little bit as it drastically improves in just a short period of time."
"go really well with a chocolate dessert.)"
" I rarely drink the Raspberry Tart out of a strong preference for its big sister Belgian Red but its still a nearly perfectly crafted beer."
"Appearance is kind of a dark cherry color, looks very heavy. Not a lot of head or lacing. Smell is very good, very tart fruit smell (raspberry, imagine that), with maybe a bit of grape. Taste is quite good as well, very fruity and heavy, just not quite as good as the Belgian Red, so I couldn't give the 5 here. Drinkability is exceptional, its heavy but goes down easy."
"I gave it a 3.5 for drinkability only because (like a lot of fruit beers) the sweetness or tartness is too much for more than one or two. Especially in a 750 ml!"
"D: Another good beer from New Glarus. A very nice balance for a fruit beer."
"This was on my list of beers to try on our WI trip and it was the first one i found. Pours cloudy and pinkish-red with a pink head. Smells like freshly squeezed raspberry juice. tastes like raspberry wine but not really any flavor of alcohol. tartness is not overwhelming and the beer (if i can call it that) is quite pleasant as a dessert. not eminently drinkable because its too fruity and sweet, but prety delicious and one of the better fruit beers i've had."
"Damn, these guys at New Glarus know their fruit beers.. Thanks again to badbeer for picking this one up for me."
"Similar in nature to the Belgian Red, except with raspberries instead of cherries. I'd hate to know how much fruit is in each bottle. The beer just explodes with raspberry color, aroma, flavor, and tartness. Sweet, tart, and thickness to the point that it's hard to drink. Sip maybe, but not drink. Belly-aching sweet. Still the flavors and aromas are flawless. Juicy, ripe, rich and full. The beer has a lingering raspberry sweetness that goes on for days. Though I like the beer, it's a little over-bearing and could stand more beer-like qualities. I'm looking for a bit more vineous, woodsy, barley, hop, and drinkability--just a little more dimension."
"The raspberry aromas waft up almost as soon as I open this. Smells of sweet raspberry jam, and like some kind of raspberry-lemonade. Pours blood colored with pink lacing. The tartness comes thru more in the taste and quickly follows the sweet raspberry flavor. An effervescent like carbonation, like a sparkling wine, tingles on the tongue and hits in the back of the throat. Not an everyday drinker, this bottle is definitely one I would share, but well balanced flavors and a great experience."
"Quite an odd one. Pours a hazy pinkish reddish color with only a smaller pink head that reduces quite quickly. Aroma is all raspberry. Really freshly picked raspberry. It's very aromatic too. Taste begins with a bit of raspberry skin tartness but soon the juices flow out. Really sweet, fruit gusher like, juice. The tartness is there but is overmatched by the juicy sweetness this raspberry drink offers. More carbonation, alcohol, anything please. Only the slighest hints of wheat and hops make there way in and really that's only when the beer warmed up on my second glass. A sticky acidic twinge finishes off this beer. Unusual, fruity, high quality in certain aspects but not so high quality in others."
" Taste is of sweet, only slightly tart raspberries, and some pale, maybe crystal malt. Lively, effervescent mouthfeel, thick, like they pureed the hell out of some raspberries and put them in this beer. Along with New Glarus' Wisconsin Belgian Red, this is the best fruit beer I've ever had."
"Redish-brown in color, this superb beer features strong raspberry on the nose. There's also the suggestion of cough medicine, a hint of malt lies underneath. The flavor of partly spicy fresh fruit bursts forth onto the palate. There's a medium tartness mid-palate. Tastes kind of like raspberry cider. This beer finishes with a mild acidity that makes its way down the throat. I must say this is one of the better fruit beers I've had."
"This is like perfectly alcoholic fruitjuice. Wonderful."
"A truely amazing accomplishment. This fanatastic beverage pours a wonderful dark raspberry color. The head is off-white with raspberry tints. The smell leaves absolutely no doubt to the contents of this extremely delightful brew. The taste is complex, yet at the same time simple-it is RASPBERRY! This is a beer to be searched out and savored. There is no room for improvement (except perhaps larger bottles). This is the standard to which all others will strive. A wonderful drink for any occasion (but be sure to save a bottle or two for the holidays). Enjoy!"
"Blood red, cloudy, dark, with a hint of violet. No head, barely any carbonation. Smell is a strong, sweet raspberry flavor, fresh and inviting. Tastes like semi-sweet raspberries at first, the tartness is not what I expected, but the finish does carry a nice tang. Slightly acidic, it becomes more drinkable as you go along. Mouthfeel is slightly thick, carbnonation is low. It is very comparable to a lightly carbonated fruit juice on the palate. Drinkablity is nice. The alcohol is low, and it keeps improving over time giving it staying power..."
"This poured like something from my smoothie maker. Gloppy fruit juice thick with a rich red/raspberry color and even had a diminishing, thumb thick, tan head. Fore is a blast of sweet raspberry and as that fades a kind of grainy oatmeal/wheat maltiness appears that tastes a bit of oatmeal cakes and malt powder. The overall effect is like a fruitfilled cake with malt powder sprinkled on it. This is so fantastic tasting that it is a little hard to believe. While the raspberry flavors are amazing what turly endears me toward the beer is the far aftertaste which is so malty and oat/wheat cake wholesome that it make me feels like a little kid trying a sweet treat for the first time. Truly and amazing creation."
"Really tasty beer that would go great with sweet desserts or sour salads or fruit glassed meats or drink this as a dessert all by itself! A great choice of beer for a brunch menu."
"No hops, no malt. Just raspberries. Medium mouthfeel, and a bit cloying. Quite tasty, but I don't think I'd be able to drink an entire bottle myself."
"i don't think i need to go on much further.i think you get the idea here. RAPSBERRIES!!! this is not a beer for people that don't like fruit type beers."
"Drinkability: While I like the Wisconsin Belgian Red better, this is a very tasty beverage. It is one to break out for a special occasion."
"The first thing that will catch your attention with this beer is the amazing smell. It smells like raspberry jam, but with a wheaty hint to it. It's quite sweet, but not in the same way as fruit flavored malt beers. Its a much more natural kind of sweetness and so it not over powering even for those who are not too keen on sweeter beers."
"Drinkability is terrible, taste more like a bad can of sour raspberry soda than beer. I don't think I would even call it beer. Couldn't even finish it."
"Nice dessert beer. You might want to find someone to share a bottle with, it is a bit too sweet and tart for me to take down a whole bottle. If you live in the area, it's worth picking up."
"Great beer, but the whole bottle was awfully tart for one person alone."
"Go out of your way for this beer. We generally get four bottles of New Glarus at a time when in Wisconsin: Three Belgian Reds and one Raspberry Tart."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer, and one that has no trouble competing with the raspberry offering from Lindeman's. You have to respect the brewer that can get this much berry flavor in a beer. The tart component is as much a part of the natural astringency of the berries, as a soured fermentation. The sourness is reserved and plays a supporting role. These over-the-top fruit beers are nice, but not necessarily my favorite because it is almost like having a fruity drink with vodka or something. That is just my opinion, and that said, I would absolutely still recommend this beer!"
"Maybe I just don't like raspberries as much as cherries, because I liked the Belgian Red much more than this. Then again, I liked the Lindemans Fram-bwaz more than either, so perhaps Raspberry Tart is the weak link in New Glarus' fruit beer chain."
" Again, I have to repeat, this is one of the best fruit beers I have ever drank! It's a great beer, and one that goes down quickly any time, but especially on a nice warm day just after mowing the lawn."
"I love the complexity and uniquness of this beer, but it tastes too much like a wine cooler for me to love. I just can't handle all of the fruit. I'd love to see a hopped up version of this beer. But hey, I'm jaded!"
"Drinkability is good. I think I would still take the Belgian Red over this one but it definitely gets the job done."
"Drinkability: I can't imagine throwing down a whole bottle of this by myself. Definitely one to share or one to savor. Would have been outstanding with some dark chocolate. Wouldn't scratch the beer itch for me on a regular basis but definitely a great brew and a welcome change of pace. Outstanding indeed!"
"If I had more than one bottle of this, I would be drinking it every day."
"Overall a very well-crafted and delicious beer. I highly recommend trying it. Probably, though, this isn't a beer that you'll be drinking a lot of in one sitting."
"Poured a dark purple color with a small pink head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of straight raspberries, very intoxicating. Sour raspberry taste, also very sweet, with grape peel and some acidity. Obviously given the 4%, no alcohol noticed here."
"compared to its competitors, this is a work of art"
"Bottle: Poured a deep red color fruit beer with a nice bubbly pink head with minimal retention. Aroma of fresh sweet raspberries is just incredible and I could spend days just sniffing in my glass. Taste consisted of sweet fresh raspberry (not the chemical syrupy raspberry that are commonly used in fruit beers), slight tartness and a light acidic finish. Its a shame that I cannot obtain this beer more regularly over here."
"Bottle generously provided by Orbitalr0x, super-huge thanks for the opportunity! Hard pour gets the tiniest ring of pinkish bubbles around the inside of the glass. Appears super-dark ruby red...as if it's made of blackberries, not raspberries. Smells...all about raspberries. It's very intense. I've only smelled raspberries like this on two occasions; 1) raspberries fresh off the plant...tasting wild and woody; 2) thick raspberry goo dripping from a chocolate raspberry cake I once had at a very posh resturant. Woody is a great way to describe the raspberries...I wonder if this beer has lotsa tannins from raspberry seeds. Now for a first taste...tart and really rich potent raspberry. Sweet start and dry finish. Raspberry pop tart insides have a flavor this sour, but not as intense and not anything near as fresh berry-like. Wow, this beer is incredible and puts the Kuhnhenn raspberry beer to shame. Cranberry sour and lemon tart. Citric acid tart dry finish with an aftertaste of raspberries that just hangs around forever. The bottle is correct, there is no need to wait for dessert. This is dessert. Pair this with a thick rich chocolate cake (no, not a light and fluffy cake, a thin rich cake so dense with butter it appears like a brownie-like slab of chocolate). Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Though md, the carb seems sharp, amid the raspberry tart. This is not a complex beer, but this is liquid raspberries in a bottle like I never could envision someone ever capturing. Amazing."
"Murky raspberry red/brown colored body. Head is very creamy and has good retention until eventually settling to a smal pink layer on top of the beer. Smell is pure raspberry, with a little bready wheat to smooth it out. Very sweet smelling and tasting. Very tart tasting, a swirl of sweet, ripe raspberries, followed by a little hoppiness to finish the experience. Magnificent dessert beer, I can not think of a better Fruit/Vegetable beer. Perfection in a bottle."
"Mouthfeel was medium, but buoyed by a hefty carbonation. The raspberries linger in your mouth afterward. Nice and drinkable, though I would prefer to have it either with a nice fruit tart or hefty chocolate cake."
"All in all, perhaps the perfect dessert beer, not to mention a world-class conversion beer. Pair this with a chocolate dessert, and your objet d' amour may just wonder how they ever lived without you...and without this brew."
"This beer pours a deep reddish/plumb color. Looks very interesting and inviting. The nose is obviously of raspberries, and not just a little. The taste is all in the name of this beer...Raspberry & Tart. There is also a little bit of yeast flavor in there. Good mouthfeel, high carbonation and full body. Coat your mouth, go ahead. I knocked the drinkability down on this a little because it is so tart that you can't hand to much of this at a time. I recommend opening a bottle and sharing it with a few friends serving it up in some wine glasses. Great beer."
"750 ml bottle. This beer pours out a thickish looking deep purple. The bubbly head fades quickly. Big raspberry aroma. Syrupy raspberry flavor. The raspberries coat the mouth and becomes cloying. Still, the flavor is not artificial, so although it's a bit much, it's still tasty. I do not find this beer to be very drinkable. One glass is plenty. As far as fruit beers go, this is pretty good, but it does not seem much like beer. I prefer the Wisconsin Belgian Red."
"If this had some more spontaneous funkiness this would be a wonderful fruit beer, but it is very solid and worth getting. Great for summer."
"Poured into Rapscallion glass, formed 1"" of Strawberry Quik pink head over the translucent raspberry red brew. Head lasts well, and lacing was good. Aroma is deeply of sour raspberries, as advertised. Taste starts with a mouthful of raspberries, some maltiness in the middle, then switches over to the tartness, which is somewhat subdued, we're not talking Cantillon sour here. Seems like it could just meld the flavors together a tad better, somehow. Mouthfeel is good, but the drinkability is quashed a bit by what seems to turn almost cloyingly sweet raspberry at the beginning of each mouthful. A nice brew, but maybe not quite so hype-worthy."
"most highly drinkable, sweet satisfaction. will be going back to this one anytime i possibly can."
"I've had this a few times. Time to re-review. It pours a brilliant deep ruby, almost oxygenated blood red, with a finger of head that falls to a sparse coat and a small ring over top. The nose is awesome. Fresh picked raspberrys, raspberry jam, just intense fruit. I really...REALLY like it. It has grown on me since the first time I tried it. The flavor is full on sweet and tart raspberry. Not a lot of the beer behind it, but it comes through on the aftertaste as a creamy, wheaty flavor. The feel is thick and slightly syrupy, but not offensive. Drinkability is very nice. The flavors and aroma are intense, but they don't interfere with the ease of drinking this brew. A damn fine beer. I am a huge fan."

"750 ml bottle. Purchased at the brewery. Some may find the fruit to be overwhelming (of should that be underwhelming), but the acidity and fruit balance are skillfully achieved and this has always been a favorite fruit beer."
"A bottle two years later courtesy of Derek. Just as good. What taste for low ABV."
"Appearance is a nice light red color with pink head and some decent lacing. Very inviting looking. Smell is tons and tons of sweet raspberries and a little bit of mustiness. A little overpowering. Not that I don't like my beer overpowering, but I prefer some complexity, even in a fruit beer. Taste is pure mashed raspberry syrup on the tip of the tongue. It does have some faint mustiness and a lingering tart aspect to keep the sweetness in check, which makes me able to finish almost half the 750, but it's still a struggle. Mouthfeel is very nice and velvety though."
"A beautiful reddish body with a purpleish cast is capped by a short head of pink foam that quickly receeds to a thin collar and leaves little lacing about the glass. Fresh raspberries greet you in the nose and beckon you to take a sip! It's delicately effervescent carbonation tickles the tongue; and its medium body gives some girth to its sweet and tart flavors. The raspberry is quite authentic, and it's so juicy and puckeringly tart-sweet that you'd think you were drinking delicately carbonated raspberry juice! It finishes dry with a wash of acidity and some residual, lingering raspberry flavor. This is quite amazing, and it easily matches the intensity of some of the sweeter versions of raspberry lambic from Belgium. Brilliant!"
"There is a good medium body that has a syrupy consistency to it. Goes down smoothly. An interesting beer for sure. Not one I could see myself drinking much of...but a good change of pace. I can see how this could be a love it or hate it affair. I'd say it's definetly worth seeking out...especially if you're a fan of fruit beers. Cheers to New Glarus and I'm glad I have another 750."
"Pours a bright red color with almost no head and doesn't leave any lacing. The aroma is just like raspberry jam - smells really good. The flavor is all about the raspberry. It's not nearly as tart as I expected. Tart, yes, but in a mild and enjoyable way. Very tasty and much better than I expected. Mouthfeel is just medium, but right where it should be. Very drinkable."
"Thanks to Kevin (kmpitz2) for waiting until I was around for this beer! 750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep purple-red color with one finger of light pink head. There's a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of sweet raspberry aromas. There's just a hint of sourness, but it's mostly sweet overall. The taste is very very sweet. Lots of raspberry flavor coming through. There's some tart flavors in there as well. A very fresh flavor. The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy. The drinkability is damn good, especially since it's only 4%. A nice fruit beer."
"Medium to full bodied, I tried it really cold like they suggested, but it's good when warmer it becomes more like a fruit wine than a beer at that point however."
"I am going to be with venom here and be the minority on this top 100 beer, but I couldn't stomach this stuff. I popped this open to celebrate my 1-year anniversary with my wife the night before we left for Maui with our wedding cake (raspberry swirl). I poured this into champagne flutes and it came out a deep purple(good band) color with a pink head of bubbles. The aroma was like a kick to the face with fresh raspberries just picked. At this point I was excited to take my first sip. There was an extreme amount of sugar cloyness that left me reaching for a glass of water. The heaviness of the sugar was not pleasant and there was no resemblence to beer coming from this. I love raspberries more than about any fruit and this was too much for me. It felt like I was drinking a can of oregon raspberries in heavy syrup. I know my opinion doesn't count, but this one is way overrated and doesn't even compare to the Belgian Red."
"thanks to bieristgut for bringing this home. from the bottle. poured what else but raspberry red with a pink head. aroma raspberries juice with carbination, caramel, hints of wood. flavor rasperries with a nice tartness, some sourness this was more like a wine cooler than a beer for me. but still liked this one."
"i was able to go 2 glasses (flutes) when all was said and done."
"Mouthfeel is nice, carbonated, and this stuff is surprisingly drinkable. I split this with one other person, but, I think I could have drank the entire 750 by myself if need be. Very good, highly recommended."
"Notes: I'm not sure why...but towards the end of this beer I kept wondering what it would taste like if I mixed it with some imperial stout. A raspberry-impy stout sounded really good at the time. Must seek out other offerings from this brewer. And thanks again to AKSmokedPorter for this gem."
"Drinkability is very high. Fruit beers are always hard to assess. Generally due to sweet or tart flavors. This beer is an absolute treasure. Well done, NG. Thanks to trbeer for this rare treat."
"This beer is a huge success, as in they accomplished everything that they were hoping to do. Raspberries were really the only thing cohesive in this brew. The malt character? Ha! None. The hop character? Ha, once again! Obviously with the use of aged Hallertau, they didn't want any hop flavor to come through. The raspberries though were just simply utterly delicious and consumed my entire mouth. The tartness balanced the sweetness of the raspberries perfectly. I didn't find this beer cloying at all. What a delight!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Intense scent!! You can smell the fresh raspberry puree aroma from almost 2 feet away! The first sip hits you with an insane burst, it tastes like you just bit into a big overly ripe juicy berry. Reminds me somewhat of sparkling red grape juice. Medium body with a good amount of carbination. I really enjoyed this but personally could not do more than say 2 or so glasses at a sitting, since there is so much flavor, so it would not be a good session beer, but it really is very great tasting!"
"Pours into my glass with a deep pink colored head. The beer is a dark red color that is approaching black (though it has a ways to go). I get strong aromas of raspberries emanating from my glass as I pour this beer. The sweet raspberry notes dominate the aroma, though perhaps a hint of acidity comes through, but not much else. The beer is definitely sweet. It has a full fruity flavor and an almost thick body from the residual sugars that are left behind. It is quite tart in the finish, though it could perhaps use a bit more to balance the syrupy sweetness. I also get a bit of raspberry skin tannin in the finish. The sweetness really over powers that rest of the complexity that might be found in the base beer. This is definitely enjoyable, but is a bit too sweet and cloying to be a 'beer' for me."
"Wow, what can I say. If there's a better fruit beer bring it on."
"Gorgeous.. wow.. gorgeous. An easy scored 5 for the appearance. Fully lasting full pink head over a fully opaque superbly dark body. I'm truly impressed, seduced, intrigued. Mostly sweet aroma, tempting, you can't tire of it, you can't get your nose of that glass. I love raspberries and I'm all set for the cruise. This starts with a pure raspberries attack, will your defenses hold? You bet, keep them coming, hell yeah, I want more. After a few sniffs, you start to graps the necessary subtlety for a perfect 10 in the aroma department. Vanilla accompanies these stellar fresh fruits and who says vanilla often says woody touch which is also true here. First beer that makes me say: ""I know what I'm smelling for breakfast tomorrow"". People are not kidding when they say you taste the seeds, you almost feel them between your teeths. Marvellously crafted fruit beer, perhaps even better than a personal favorite: Quelque Chose. I can't believe a beer to be so full-flavoured at 4% ABV. Unique creation which can only be rivalled by New Glarus Belgian Red and as MartinT points out, once you're there, it's really only a matter of preferring cherries over raspberries or vice-versa. On parallel, I personally prefered the raspberry tart which seems to have more acidity (although it still could have used a bit more imo). This is the best single focus on one flavor I've encountered in my young life, this extreme sweetness never appears cloying, nor syrupy nor fake. Lots of stuff going on, eminently complex, crisp and contemplative. Superb mouth-filling body with enough carbonation to detract from the never cloying sweetness. A thousand thanks Nexxus for this fine pie! Hunt this out before I do!"
"Appearance was a cool looking dark blood red/raspberry with thin rim of pink bubbles. Sweet raspbeery jam aroma with an every so slight tartness. Hey, I might like this beer after all. Taste: all I tasted was sweet raspberry puree. No hints of malt or hops or anything else that makes a beer a beer. ""Cloying"" doesn't even describe the sticky syrupy mess that stuck to my throat. Maybe a little carbonation wouldv'e helped it dance across tha palate a little better, instead it just coated the mouth with sweetness and nothing else. Mind you- there were no objectionable or ""off"" flavors, just one-dimensional sweet raspberry ones. It's too bad that this bottle was wasted on me because it seems a lot of people enjoy this ""beer"" but I found it undrinkable and dumped most of the bottle. The wife even laughed at it."
"A raspbeery aroma that starts filling your mouth with water before you can take the first sip, nice little head, a soft creamy raspbeery taste with a hint of tartness and sourness initially, but the sourness doesn't linger in the aftertaste. And the Raspbeery aroma stays with you till the end.For what it is, its wonderful stuff."
"Something this intense is bound to be somewhat controversial and subject to very subjective judgements. Just walk away if you don't like the fruit equivalent of an ""extreme beer."" But coming running full steam ahead if you dig raspberries or ""dessert"" beers. Because this is IT."
"Raspberries are definitely not my thing, but I discovered this beer had much pleasure to offer. A full 750 would have been too much for me, and probably would be too much for any one person. Fortunately, I had HiroProtagonist and his fiancee with which to split the bottle, and it ended up being the perfect amount. A dark ruby red, with twinges of hot pink both towards the edges and in the small head. Naturally, the smell was overwhelmingly raspberries. The fruit sweetness was undeniable, especially right off the bat, but towards the end of the flavor profile, it turned more tart (tarter?) and led to a puckering finish that was the high point for me. Quite similar to Lindeman's but noticeably less fizzy, more substantial; a rich, fluid, velvety mouthfeel. The entire beer (especially the tart finish) enlivened the taste buds to an amazing degree (better as an aperitif than dessert). What impressed me most was how fresh the raspberry taste seemed, practically fresh off the bush. The lack of any noticeable ""beer"" flavors definitely had me out of my element, and I found a little went a long way, so as to affect drinkability. Regardless, I found much to enjoy, particularly in the skilled blend of sweet and sour."
"Raspberry Tart was very enjoyable, but I felt the beer would have benefited from more tartness, which would have made both the nose more captivating and the taste more exciting and balanced. But other than this problem, I was highly satisfied with this beer, especially the nice capture of potent fresh raspberry and the perfect carbonation. I was very glad to have found this beer being served in Oregon! Thanks Pix."
"An amazing and different take on beer itself hopefully it makes non beer drinkers appreciate good beer even though it's done through fruit."
"Wow...thanks to Bighuge for this bottle. A simply amazing dessert beer, something I could share with a date or with a non-beer lover. It's a shame this doesn't make it to PA, but I'd absolutely trade for this again!"
"750ml capped bottle dipped in wax with no freshness date. Poured a cloudy dark violet color like grape juice. Oh man what an aroma! Big, Big raspberry aroma that is sweet and delicious smelling. Body is much fuller than I expected and really smooth with a sharp carbonated finish. The flavor here although one-dimensional is actually very good. There is so much raspberry in here that flavor of any other ingredient is pretty much buried. Finishes slightly tart and sweet, balanced in that aspect at least. Again, not a bad thing so if you like raspberry you will enjoy this. Also paired nicely with sharp Wisconsin Cheddar."
"Geez, this stuff is close to Alizarin Crimson in color (a purplish red used by watercolor painters). Thin skim of a pinkish head. Laces in wisps on a wine glass. Raspberries saturate the aroma, and being my favorite berry, that's OK. The flavor however is overdone and unidimensional. Berry chokes the palette and the nose concurrently -- and while its not the overly sweet tone of a cheap Framboise, its too much. The tartness is underdone, its more raspberry ""smoothie"" than seeds and stems. The Belgian Red straddles the line, this crosses it. Could also use slightly more carbonation for interest."
"Some may say that this is overindulgence, I call it self-cleansing, and pleasuring. Not a single drop of this beer would ever go to waste on my watch. I don't think I would ever get this much pleasure from eating raspberries, so I shall swear them off and consume them only in the liquid form provided by New Glarus. I need a towel."
"Notes: A perfect tasting fruit beer, real fruit! This is my top pick for an early afternoon brunch tipple."
"Thanks tavernjef!"
"A High 5 to FeloniousMonk for this Beauty."
"I'm a big fan of raspberry flavor and this is a great dessert beer. I didn't enjoy this quite as much as the Belgian Red, but it is still a very good ale. Worthy of its 2003 Silver Medal placing at the GABF."
"thanks to feloniousmonk for this one and the other beers he helped me to sample!"
"Dark red color. Small head. Aroma is raspberry and malts. A big bold raspberry flavor. Malty and slightly sweet. The raspberry flavor predominates this beer. Still beer like, despite all the fruit flavor. As usual with New Glarus its very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet."
"Deep, unfiltered merlot wine color with a bubbly pink head that won't quit. Leaves trails of lace down the flute glass. Beautiful appearance. Nose is dominated by bold, sweet and tart raspberries. Mild mustiness seems present, too, but not much else. Taste is mildly tart and full on raspberries at first. As the brew opens up a bit, sugar becomes a bit more prevalent leading to a cola-like sweetness on the finish, however the original tartness never strays too far. Coats the palate incredibly well. Sharp, effervescent mouthfeel is quite inviting. This is an incredibly tasty framboise-style, but the overall fruitiness prevents it from receiving a perfect drinkability score. As the label states, ""Life's too short to wait for dessert."" I'd recommend taking the brewer's advice and consuming this at all costs."
"It looked like a glass of cloudy merlot. Huge nose & flavor of... Raspberries. These guys did this one right. It's not a beer w/ some raspberries thrown in. It's the sweet/tart taste of raspberries, that happens to be a beer. Great job."
"Not a gateway fruit beer for the uninitiated, but a big raspberry dessert of a beer for lengthy savoring."
"If curious check out my Young's Double chocolate for a blended review."
"The pour is a nebulous deep raspberry red, the head monstrous in size, creamy in texture, and a winsome cherry pink in color, the lace a satiny sheet to conceal the glass. The tart raspberry nose is a treat; the start sweet and sour, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is crisply acidic, fruit tart, the finish is dry and quite a treat from my usual over the top beers. A very intriguing beer, quite different as I never hunt out these types? Well I think I've made a mistake, which will not be repeated in the future."
"Thanks to jeffboo for the bottle!"
"Other than that, perfection!"
"As soon as you open the bottle, you get smacked in the face with the raspberry aroma. Poured a raspberry purple/red with little to no head. Initially, the beer was very reminiscent of a Lindeman's Framboise, but as it warmed it showed quite a bit more character. The tartness really started to come out and a it was evident that the beer was quite a bit more complex than it initially led me to believe. A quite nice beer especially when you consider it's from a US brewery."
"Overall, a great fruit beer."
"Do yourself a favor and try and find this beer. I have heard that they are going to stop distributing all of their brands outside of Wisconsin, so you may have to find a local BA to get it for you."
"A thousand thanks to cokes for hooking me up with this one!"
"All told, I believe that this is a better and more complex creation than the heralded Belgian Red (which is still very impressive in its own right). I tend to dislike raspberries, but I still enjoy this one alot. Fans of the fruit will moan in delight."
"If you serve this to the unprepared, be ready for them to be shocked at first, then curious, then finally addicted and asking for more...."
"Big thanks to Bighuge for the sample of this enjoyable brew!"
"Dark red...nice lace..very very strong raspberry aroma...strong raspberry taste...tart...If it says raspberry tart, I expect that, and I got it with this one...excellent beer if you're into this type...Their Belgian Red gets all the pub but this is almost just as good, if not as good.."
"Pours a luscious dark burgandy color.  Slight head.  The aroma is exquisite.  Smells like sweet raspberry pie.  This beer has a tart quality that isn't overwhelming.   Perfectly balanced.  Not your typical brew.  Great raspberry sweetness.  The malt and hops here are used as a backdrop for the fruity sensations to work their magic.  This is extroadinary.  It is like drinking a liquid raspberry pie with whipped cream.  A great experience."
