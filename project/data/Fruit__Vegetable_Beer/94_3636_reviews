"It has it time and place, a very nice beer for the true dog days of summer, fruit feels and taste very light and natural, not sick sugary  goop"
""
"06/05/13 At Rattle N Hum, NYC, on tap. This is a whisper of a beer. The berries are hiding behind the wheat beer character that is disguised as an alcoholic beverage. As an adult beverage this one may disappoint, but as a refresher, hit it & again, as it will quench. It won't inspire poetry or launch a thousand ships, but it may just hit the spot if it's summer & your thirsty...& have to drive home...but just one."

"Overall: You've probably got a friend who likes dumb fruit macros like Bud Light Lime and whatever Raspberita is and whathaveyou. I'd say hand them one of these; it's approachable and fun and has some nice crafty appeal. It's nothing mind-blowing but it's a fine day beer."

"DATE REVIEWED: June 7, 2014... GLASSWARE: Lindemans flute... OCCASION: Gatsby 2012....bring it on, Baz!...APPEARANCE: crystal clear, faintly tinted in yellow, with rapid effervescence; thick yet bubbly white head...odd, misshapen lacing... AROMA: pungent, offish skunky funk that suggests a fruity failure--not saying any more than this... PALATE: soft, bubbly, thin and drinkable--almost refreshing, but more like weakly flavored water... TASTE: mostly acquiescent light beer malt tendencies, with a tinge of blackberry--rather flat... OVERALLL: a weak, cleansing, warm weather wheat that doesn't distinguish itself; such a slight turn of berry that only faintly offers flavor, and what is offered is annoying...."
"Pours clear yellow into a pint glass. This is now announced as discontinued, so this is my farewell bottle. No noticeable hop or malt profile, but the blackberries remain restrained and it finishes dry and crisp. Ideal for a hot summer day. Very drinkable and refreshing. If we are honest, this beer, at 110 calories and 4% abv, is light years better than any mass produced light beer. It's better than some new session IPAs too and many other fruit/wheat craft beers. Sadly it lacks the hops to sell anymore and so must be retired. I wonder what will take its place as a bridge beer."

"O: Keeping in mind that I do not like fruit beers; this one does what its set out to do. I could easily drink 5 of these without feeling a thing as it doesn't even feel like 4% abv. On a hot day, this would be extremely refreshing."

"As far as flavored wheat beers go this one was almost too good. Long Trail has definitely nailed this recipe. Very good as a post skiing or hiking beer, or even for after eating. I suggest it be served around 40 degrees. It seems to be as good out of the tap/ in a glass as it is in a bottle, so don't worry about that, but make sure you haven't had a dark beer before this (it diminishes the taste). Really one of the better flavored beers I've ever had and 100% worth taking sip of if you're just coming from a fun outdoor sport"

"O: Like I said, I'm biased. To me, Blackbeary Wheat is just the beer that flatlander college students at UVM drink to look cool because they can't stomach a Long Trail Ale. This seems to me a poor example of a poorly made, light beer masquerading as something refined and special. And, like I said, don't get me wrong, I had my Long Trail phase. And I would never turn down their Ale, Double Bag, or anything else--except for this. Try it for yourself, but if you are looking for a respectable, well-made craft beer, I'd look elsewhere."

"Had this from the bottle out of the Long Trail summer mix pack. The concept of fruit beer...is frankly a bit feminine inherently to me, but I like this one, its a bit of a guilty pleasure. The blackberry finish is not too strong, and barely sweet. Nice on a cooler August afternoon. The color is darker for a wheat, nothing special with that or the mouthfeel. One of Long Trail's more original and better offerings."

"the label is cool too if that matters to you"

"The taste also expresses itself loudly with blackberries, which I happen to love, grains, herbs, a hint of citrus, and a clean finish. Very nice for the style."

"The pale yellow-orange liquid pours nicely, with moderate, quickly dissipating head, moderate carbonation. The smell is somewhat offputting with a distinct but faint presence of rotten fruit. The odor is likely stronger when the beer is not chilled to 38F, but I'd be hard-pressed to describe it as ""aroma"". This only gets worse when you taste it. Although not overwhelming, the constant presence of musty black-grape flavor is distracting and bothersome, but is clearly meant to be a ""feature"". The rest of the flavor is missing in action -- taste more like flavored mineral water with a drop of cheap vodka. In some parallel universe it may give Leinie a run for its money--but not in mine (and I can't drink Leinie with a straight face). This alone would make me think twice about buying LT. I was initially unimpressed with LT festival samples but wanted to give them a full try. This appears to be the worst of mediocre lineup."

"The fruit doesn't amount to much, if this is supposed to be a fruit beer. It's not interesting or refreshing enough to be a good quaff. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Whole Foods in Washington, DC"
"Poured into a pilsner glass and developed a full, airy head, which was white to off white. Lacing was good and foam lasted for a short time. Aroma was fruity and sweet with slight gum notes. Appearence was clear and golden. Tast was sweet and fruity, like berries, Mouthfeel was light and clean"

"Overall: Pretty decent for what it is. Not a whole lot of flavor going on, but what flavor is there isn't bad. I'd grab this over a mass produced light lager any day."
""
"Overall - For a light, refreshing brew, this brew is one of the best. This is my go-to brew when I can get it over lighter alternatives that lack depth and flavor. I definitely prefer this on-tap."

"The beer pours kristelweiss clear and yellow, like some very clean dehydrated pee. The head on top is huge and snow white, with finely packed bubbles, but a lumpy exterior. The beer’s body is as clean as a hospital, with a light torrent of carbonation bubbles working their way to the top of the glass. The lacing on the edges of the glass is medium to thick, sticky, and quite patchy. On the nose, the beer smells of damp wheat with a light spice note, and plenty of tart and syrupy sweet blackberry smells. On the tongue, the beer tastes cleanly of wheat bread and sweet black berries. The beer begins with damp and bitter bland wheat before opening into a more welcoming biscuity flavor with a very light spice from the yeast, and then crescendoing with the syrupy blackberry taste that is sweet and pleasing. The close of the beer is far more pleasant than the opening, with light lingering wheat flavors, and a very light sweet tang of blackberries. In the mouth, the beer feels very clean, and of a lighter body, with some very nice velvety carbonation bubbles, and a refreshing kick in the back of the throat. The mouth is left a little dry and sticky, strangely, but the throat is left feeling quite refreshed. Overall, this is a light fruit beer that I really don’t mind drinking a lot of. Longtrails website says this beer originated from the concept of Belgiums lambic beers, but I see it as far more akin to a crisp kellerweiss, and I think they should start marketing it that way. The beer is great for a summer day when you want something a little sweet to refresh the tongue."

"Clear pour. Very, very light. Not surprising. Berry odor comes forth, but not very distinctive. The mouthfeel is extremely thin. The malt flavors are nice for a light wheat beer. Just enough to keep it interesting. For me, the Berry flavor isnt distinct enough. wish it had a more unique flavor. but the base beer is very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It is a staple and a go-to. Nothing incredibly unique but it would definitely be a treat for visitors and I enjoy it more than other 'fruity' beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and would be very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon."
"There is a bitter edge to the beer, sharp on the tongue. Cleans up nicely after itself. Seems like a good upgrade for the light beer drinking crowd, both for clean flavor profile as well as low ABV."
""
"Thanks again to woodychandler for his large supply of beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of blueberries. Taste is also of blueberry, although not sweet, some wheat tartness, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."

""
""

"I was very surprised by this beer. They kept it simple and didn't try to make it too complex. It's a straightforward fruit beer, and it's a good one. Maybe a step behind Sam's Cherry Wheat."
""
"O - A nice wheat beer on a hot day, but left me wanting a little more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A dull, somewhat lifeless wheat beer with some nice blackberry taste. Its crisp and refreshing properties are about the only thing it has going for it. It's the kind of beer I'd chug in lieu of water after a long run on a hot day. Not bad for a lawnmower beer I suppose, but if you expect anything more from it, you will be sorely disappointed."
""
""
""
"The Crack startled me as it was another Craft CAN filled to the brim and foaming up as soon as it was opened. I went with an initial inverted Glug, resulting in two fingers of massive, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled faintly of berries and I remember this being a knock against this beer - not enough Ooomph in terms of its fruitiness. Mouthfeel was light, not watery, but close and the lightness of the fruit combined nicely with the inherent tang of the wheat, but I just felt like it had been dialed down from what it could have been. Finish was dry and refreshing, which may be appropriate for the beach, but I just was not feelin' it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm really not a fan of fruit beers.. so I don't know why I bother buying them. I will say that this one is pretty drinkable; and if for some reason all of the beers in the world had fruit in them, I'd buy this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: I'm not a huge fruit beer guy, but this one isn't too bad. It's still a one and done for me, but it's a decent wheat with a fairly balanced fruit finish."
""
""
""
"Very light in color and fruity. Got it in a sampler pack and would probably never purchase this beer alone. It was worth a try but nothing special IMO."
""
""
""
""

"this is underrated on BA, no doubt. pours a brightly bubbling golden color with a short white head. smell can be a little off-putting at first, with a decaying berry kind of weird fermenty smell. i think it smells like fresh summer beer, but thats just me. flavor is what its all about, and this tastes good. lots of light wheat malt and a healthy dose of fresh berries on the back end. not as all sweet, i think its an amazingly well balanced fruit beer. in a summer beer, mouthfeel is a huge factor, and i like the lighter body and active carbonation of this easy drinker. its one after the other all day with these. you need a beer like that sometimes. good stuff in my book."
""
""
""
"This is a thin, (as in no body...even a Blue Moon has more substance) watery brew, with a slightly bitter aftertaste, which surprises me as I got no sense of hops with my first smell. I'd let this one go by. If your looking for fruit, try a Blue Point Blueberry."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like blackberries, but they seemed to be trying to ""blend"" in too well in this beer. Being a ""fruit/vegetable beer," I thought they would come out a bit more. Still, I'm not sure if I would have this again?"
""
""
""
" The flavor starts out with a wheat taste which is slightly sweet which leads to the berry element which is balanced well here. The yeast is pretty clean which allows the wheat and fruit to be the prominent flavors. Overall I enjoyed this as a nice refreshing wheat.I give it better than average in most categories because it achieves the goal of the brewer - light quaffable wheat with a subtle berry flavor to compliment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm not a fan of blackberries but it was interesting to try this beer. Not bad"
""
""
""
"Overall – Not really my kind of beer. It really doesn’t have anything I found all that enjoyable. The taste and aroma were nothing all that pleasurable, the taste left a rather unpleasant aftertaste in the mouth and the mouthfeel was really quite bland."
""
"Although it's look and feel aren't great, especially if you are expecting a traditional wheat, it doesn't taste that bad. It's light and fresh, and has almost no aftertaste. As long as you know this going in, you can adjust your expectations. Could easily put down twice as many of these than a normal wheat ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - not a bad beer for warm weather.. kind of light flavored, but that's good for a session ale."

"This beer is a gift from my friend. It smells pretty good sort of like a good fruit wine. Looks pretty bad though, a step up in golden color from my cheap college beers. Sort of a tart taste and you can taste the blackberry at the end but it's just an overall eh taste."
""
""
""
""
"This poured out without much of a hazy which is what makes a wheat beer so special in my opinion. It was yellowish gold in color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer has some light hints of berry on the nose and wheat. The taste of the beer is a little fruity but a little bland also. The mouthfeel of the beer is a little watery and just not enough body. Overall It's just too light I think."

"When I first poured this beer into my glass I was a bit confused. The beer is crystal clear (filtered wheat beer booo!) and smelled just like any lager. The taste was just completely unremarkable. The blackberry flavor was barely discernible and the beer actually tasted more like a lager than any ale I've ever had. Another reviewer described it pretty well, it tastes like a lager with an off metallic taste in the end. Would highly recommend avoiding this one."

"Overall: This is just an average beer, really. I would have it again, for sure though. It reminds me of an adjunct lager, but more crisp and better overall. However, it's nothing amazing either, but worth a shot."
"not worth 250 words but i will continue to get the review in. do not try this beer"
"I drank this straight from the bottle. Sorry. I didn't get much of an appearance due to my method of consumption. Soft blackberry aroma and a bit of wheat. Flavor was soft with less blackberry than the nose would suggest. Veeery easy drinking and refreshing. Will try again on a hot summer day."
"O: a sessionable fruit beer, not too sweet but nice, not all that great in any way but decent as it goes"
"O-A disappointing blackberry beer. I love Sam Adams, gave it a B+ and it is one of my highest rDev's, but this beer just way too light and artificial."
" is a much better example."
"A good, light summer brew. An easy drinker. You can really knock 'em back."
"O: I'm not a big fan of the fruit-flavored wheat beers to begin with, but this one reminds me why: too much fruit, not enough beer."
"O: Not much to really say. This is a session beer with a wheat base and a bit of blackberry. It delivers this role just fine. Very light, crisp and plain."
"O: Eh. There's nothing really remarkable about Blackbeary Wheat. Probably a good summer afternoon beer with its low ABV and light body, but there are better fruit/wheat beers out there."
"Ok, so there isn't too much to this beer, but I really do love it. It's totally simple and really tasty. It's awesome for a hot summer day. And it's low calorie...yay!"
"Overall, I just remember this beer differently on tap, more defined and intense flavors. Its still nicely made, but just a little clean for my preference."
"Poured a 3/4"" white head. Clear straw yellow. Smell has the slightest hint of a fruit danish. Taste is actually much more subtle on the fruit than I expected, and in fact if I hadn't seen the label said blackberry I'm not sure I would have guessed that was the fruit. Taste has a slight edge on BMC mass-produced beers and the fruit addition is comparable to pretty much a blueberry beer. There's a mild bitter finish."
"O- Works as a simple session beer. Besides its blackberry note, it doesn't provide too much else tastewise. But if you like blackberry, like I do, it's simple and enjoyable."
"O: I could see my bmc friends drinking this in the summer and calling it ""extravagant"" and ""exotic"" but there is just not enough here for me. Too watery, extract blackberry/soda flavor, lacking in even a minor hop profile. Not a re-buy for me."
"Basically a beery blackberry soda. Light and refreshing, tastes better than it smells but doesn't really bring the blackberry flavor out nearly enough for my taste. Fairly bland overall. Not much yeasty wheat character at all. Quenching picnic fare for a hot day, nothing all that interesting in the end though. Pretty average. Watery body, clean finish. As another reviewer said, not likely to appeal to the BA crowd very much. Just too boring!"
"D - Mostly chose the beer to tick Vermont off my list of states I've tried beer from. I've had a few blackberry beers that I thought were good in the past. This sadly wasn't one of them."
"Mouthfeel is crisp with a slightly dry finish and a light bodied feel. Overall, I expect better from Long Trail. I really enjoy most of their beers but Blackbeary Wheat clearly is not made to appeal to dedicated craft beer crowd (the geeks if that's the term you like). Could be so much better but it just isn't."
"O- Pretty average fruit beer. Honestly I was most impressed that the blackberry wasn't overwhelming. I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't seek it out"
"D - Very drinkable, though very empty. There is not much going on other than some blackberry flavor. There is almost no wheat that comes through, or any other flavor."
"O: The beer is extremely easy to drink and makes for a good selection on a hot summer day."
"M/O: Very crisp but light. Not too complex but still very drinkable."
"O - Very light and boring beer. I suppose it would quench thirst on a hot summer's day."
"O- Nothing against the beer or brewery, this beer is just not my style."
"Very light body and I have found myself drinking a bunch of these. It has the right amount of wheat and flavor."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being average. Drinkability isn't great for me, there just isn't that much to it besides a fruity, extract like flavor. It's very sweet as well and almost drinks like a very light and carbonated juice."
"D: taste like a normal lite beer (even though its not) with a hint of fruit"
"D: Not a big fan of this one, alcohol was low, so was taste, was expecting more flavor since it was a fruit beer."
"It tastes like bubblicious bubble gum."
"body is thin and fizzy. easy to drink, just not very great tasting. very odd choice to include in a winter variety pack, as this seems like a summer beer, thirst quencher type."
"(from notes - tasted Sept 2010)"
"Grabbed one because I liked the label. Pours a light golden color, little head, not impressive. Smell is weak, light biscuity malt with subtle fruit notes. Flavor is light and crisp, a little touch of tart berry on the finish, minimal sweetness and an earthy berry bite in the aftertaste that is much like eating a fresh blackberry. Expected a more wheaty beer, it is refreshingly light and crisp though, with a dry, tart finish. Not one I would make a daily drinker, but as far as the fruit beers go, this is not too shabby."
"Not too bad, not too great. Pretty bland, even the blackberry fades over time not leaving much else."
"12oz. bottle served in a weizen glass. Pours a translucent yellow-gold with a three inch, tight, creamy white head. Head eventually settles into a foamy, quarter inch cap. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose expresses a citrus quality intermingled with berries and a light wheat character. Taste is somewhat bland and watery - the berry flavor is all but gone, with a faint wheat malt presence coming out towards the back. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with a watery consistency and a lively carbonation. Not a terrible offering, but there's just much going on here. I wouldn't pass one up if offered, but all and all, it's a fairly lackluster beer."
"D: Sweet blueberry flavor wears on me a bit, but without that flavor, there is little else."
"D- This is a nice fruit beer and I would probably buy this again when spring rolls around. I feel that if it was not for the blackberry flavor this would be a very boring beer."
"M/D: Very light with good carbonation. Overall, a disappointment, they seemed to miss the mark with this one."
"Overall, the best part about this beer is the label. Which is kind of cute. Unlike Jay Cutler."
"12 oz bottle from a Long Trail variety pack. Pours golden hue with a soda like carbonation. Sweet, fruity aroma. Taste is similar. There is nothing much motre to write about. It is more like a wine cooler than a beer. I did not like this brew at all."
"Drinkability is high. If you don't mind the flavor, these go down easier than water. I am also writing this on our first 20 degree day of the season here in the NorthCountry, and this is definitely a summer beer. In the middle of the summer, on a hot day, riding a boat, I could probably down a 12 pack of these without even knowing it."
"Picked this up on a Friday. Drank a few out of a sixer and didnt really feel anything. Was not impressed with this beer! Didnt hate or love it. It just didn't do anything for me. I guess this would be a craft to drink throughout the night without getting messed up."
"very nice drinkability, great for hot summer days. i would buy this again, im just in no hurry. this would be a nice beer for women or people just making the switch from macro to craft."
"I poured this tasty beverage from a bottle into my mouth, you could taste the blackberry then the wheat, very tasty. I would defiantly buy a 6 pack just to drink for a good tasty time. It is also very smooth, if you cant drink beer good and have money, just buy like 20 of these and slam em for a good time"
"D: This is probably a better beer to have in the middle of summer instead of on a dreary rainy fall day in VT. Not something I would personally seek out."
"This beer pours a bold, clear yellow with a thin fleeting head. It's aroma is of blackberries, of course, with honey and pine notes. Well balanced. The flavor begins with citrus, like a witbier, then follows through with blackberry, vanilla, and dough flavors. Again well balanced with a pleasant blackberry finish. Blackbeary Wheat has a light mouthfeel which contributes to it's high drinkability. Very refreshing anytime beer. Recommended!"
"Carbonation stings the sides of the mouth with a verry slight blackberry tartness up front - little to no sweetness from the fruit, then finnishes with a rounded wheat flavor in the back. A verry nice fruit beer, as the blackberry is very subtle in taste and mainly used for it's tartness, with just a hint of sweetness coming through."
"Mouthfeel is about average for a lager. It is nice and crisp. The fruit flavor is not too sweet or artificial tasting. Drinkability is pretty good. Everything is mild and pleasant. The fruit adds to rater than detracts from the beer. Overall, not bad."
"D-This beer is quite drinkable. No overpowering flavors and the alcohol content is low. Easily able to drink a sixpack. A nice beer to drink when its hot out. Take it for what it is. A relaxed mix of wheat and berry. This beer is waaay better than its rating in my opinion. Its light, refreshing, and has my favorite fruit...nothing wrong here!"
"On the good side there is a nice refreshing feel to this beer and it goes down well. Any negatives are light on the palate and does not stand for very long in your mouth. My least favorite beer from Long Trail brewery that usual makes a pretty good beer. With the recipe adjusted this could be alot better."
"D - One was enough. Interesting I suppose, but something I would try to avoid in the future.."
"I remember this beer being better. Maybe I was dumber, younger or both. But I also remember this tasting much better IN the bottle. All and all it's not bad, just not exciting, but very drinkable nonetheless."
"Meh...it's drinkable, but I am not sure why one would. Many other fruit beers out there that put this one to shame."
"Not terrible just not much of anything."
"I'll have to try it on draught. The good people of vermont swear by this beer."
"Drinkability: What is there to drink? Very similar to a seltzer or sparkling water. Would be good in the summer."
"A clear pale yellow gold with a fair white cover and decent lacing. The aroma includes grape jelly and wheat, berry sweetness with a very Kool-Aid/soda sort of attraction. The flavor brings a firm rice cereal wheat with a tasteful cherry-like berry overtone. Although there is a fair amount of lively carbonation evident, it quickly washes away into a fairly watery feeling brew, thin, very drinkable if you like these flavors. There is a faint citrus hop dryness in the finish that gets your tongue. With the right mindset, this isn't a bad fruit flavored beer, something for the picnic or golf outing perhaps. Not a mouth watering choice though."
"Pours a pale golden hue with a bright white head forms speckled scattered lacing as the spritzy head dwindles. Aroma light biscuit malt and some sharp wheat with a touch of blackberry tartness. A typical American fruit infused wheat ale, this is probably a blackberry flavoring added it's not overly sweet, which is a good thing. Light biscuit malts and a sharp slight citrus wheat tanginess comes together with the berry acidity and tart components to make a decent but boring one dimensional flavor. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation tickles the back of the throat the finish is heavy with carbonation in the back of the throat it pretty much clears the palate of the flavor. Drinkability yes it's a true sessio beer but I wouldn't be entertained with the flavors offered here to stick with this one for more than a beer or two."
"D- I could drink this stuff all night long with no ill consequences. While I wouldn't write home about this beer, I can still see myself drinking a few of these after cutting the grass during a weekend in June."
"Thanks again Eric!"
"This was a favorite of mine for a while, before I got into tasting some real quality micro-brews out there. Long Trial is not a bad beer to start with, get yourself involved, I always thought it was top notch. Having this now, it tastes sort of like Miller Light laced with blackberry flavoring. It's light, good for the summer, but the taste is lacking, there is not much complexity, and the only thing I can really taste is the blackberry. It's ok, an average beer, I like buying the Long Trail mix-pack, and I don't mind that it's in there, but I wouldn't buy a sixer/twelver just for this. It's average."
"D - it's drinkable, but I wouldn't really want more than one"
"D - I had a couple. Nice light fruit beer if you are in the mood for the style."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. A friend brought some back to Ohio for me from New Hampshire, and it was a delicious treat. It was full of flavor, and the fruit taste was not overbearing, as is the case with many ""berry"" beers. It still tasted like a beer, not like some juice drink. I recommend this beer to anyone!"
"Overall this makes me want to go to my fridge and crack a Lennie Berry Weiss."
"I can gaurantee that one bottle I tried will be my last although I will continue to buy longtrail and wish them the best in future beers."
"I will say that this would be a good thirst quencher as the label suggests... so, drinkability would be higher than any other aspect."
"Has a very very light golden color with a small white head no laceing. Besides the weak berry smell not much of anything else going on kind of lackluster. The taste is about the same as the smell for being blackberry wheat you think would be a strong taste of one of the two. Good mouth feel smooth with good carbonation. I find it to be drinkable but would not waste my money on it not worth it no taste."
"D - I've tried it 2 or 3 times now, out of a variety case, but one at a time is enough."
"Pours a crystal clear pale straw color with a fluffy pure white head that settles into a sparse cap. Looks like one of those american light lagers. The aroma is of blackberries and grain. The fruit aroma pretty much dominates anything else. The taste is of the wheat malt, kind of grainy with a vegetable note. This is followed by the blackberry flavor which adds a little sweetness and tartness to the brew. The flavor is very light and not all that appealing. The feel is light and fizzy and finishes sweet. The beer drinks ok but I wouldn't want to try it when it gets warm. Basically a light macro with blackberry flavor."
"This beer would be best suited for a post grass cutting marathon. That wasn't my situation today so I am not really that thrilled about it."
"One thing I will say for this beer is that it is not something that you sip; a few of these go back very quickly (especially if you had some beer you really wanted to drink and you just wanted to get these puppies out of the way)."
"D: Despite the subpar qualities that dominate this beer, it is quite drinkable with the only deterring factor being the desire to drink something better."
"D - I'm going to be glad when this is beer is over."
"T- Like the scent, it's very crisp and has a spicy fruit taste to it, kind of like what a cider gatorade would taste like. Interesting."
"therefore, it's quite drinkable as a session, esp. if somethin salty or spicy is involved. or dark chocolate."
"I thought maybe it was just me, but reading other reviews, I guess I am not too far off base."
"Drinkability: If pressed, I would drink, but I wouldn't buy this beer on my own. I'm upset because the label of a bear stealing a pie and about to be hit by a rolling pin really excited me, and I really wanted to like this beer."
"Drinkability: A nice light lager with a good, but not overpowering taste. Not the most complex beer. A summer treat and a favorite from Long Trail. This is an excellent camping beer that I could have six of in the summer and a couple in other seasons."
"Overall, a good, clean summer beer. Would have liked to see a little flavor, be it from the blackberries, yeast, wheat malt... just something."
"D- I consumed just enough to give this beer a fair assessment... and poured the rest of the bottle down the drain. I'm sure there's someone out there that likes this stuff in the bottle, but I'm not one of them..."
"Other- not my favorite fruit beer (in fact I am still in search for that) but not bad. Good on a summer day."
"D- Insane... keep it coming!"
"Cheers"
"D- A nice hot-weather beer; quenches the thirst well."
"Pours a very light almost clear yellow color with a very little head. The smell is of wheat and some blackberries . The taste is rather weak, there is a grain taste with only a hint of blackberries near the very end of the taste. The mouthfeel is a moderate carbonation. Overall it is an average drinkable beer nothing to make you dislike it, but overall very weak and not complex."
"I must say this was my first drainpour ever."
"Poured from a bottle into a tall ale glass. Finger or two of light tan foam above an medium amber ale. Smells malty and slightly fruity. Tastes more like blueberry ale than blackberry ale. Good amout of carbonation and refreshing mouthfeel. I appreicate the refreshing quality of the beer and it has definate drinkability."
"Cheers!"
"I love blackberries and I'd love it if a brewery could do something with them other than flavor an already existing beer of make a light beer more appealing to non-beer drinkers. A big, bold blackberry stout would be great. Someone do that!"
"It smells sweet, notes of corn, sugar, and faint blackberry. Upon taking my first taste, more of that blackberry noted on the label is coming out. It went down fairly easy and the mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Drinkability is so-so, I decided against having any more of these that were waiting in the fridge. This particular beer seems best suited for someone who enjoys ""hard lemonade"" and other offerings in that niche category."
"Drinkability- This is a beer which I would not go out of my way to drink but I would drink it if it was the only craft beer."
"This beer does not offer much. Lovers of light beers who go for sweet and fruity will like it. This came as part of a variety pack. This was the worst in the pack. The others were OK."
"12oz bottle obtained from Shaw's Supermarket in Derry, NH. Pale yellow in color and crystal clear with a 1/4 to 1/2 inch off white head. The berry dominates the smell with a triscuit cracker like undertone. The taste is similar to that of a Wheat Thin cracker with slight tinge of berry. Initially, the wheat taste is very dominate, but after a few sips the berry taste becomes a little bit more pronounced. Light and crisp mouth feel. A good choice of beer for a hot day. Simple and hits the spot."
"Overall- Light and watery but fruity enough to make this a good refeshing summer beer."
"D - This is a great beer to drink on a hot day due to the refreshing sensation you get while drinking it. I like this beer anytime though. This is not a heavy or too sweet beer. It is a good American wheat. I will continue buying."
"It's a pretty clear yellow color with no head, it does have a great wheat & Blackberry aroma to it which is very appealing, and the taste seems almost watered down compared to say one of Dogfish Heads fruit beers. However on a hot summer day or when you're moving it's a great beer."
"D) A summer-day-mowing-the-lawn type of beer. Wait for summer and it will be just right."
"Pours a clear light yellow color with 1 finger of tight foamy white head that fades fast and leaves a very small amount of spotty lacing. Smells of berries, grain, and a slight hint of lemon. Tastes of fruit berries with some grainy wheat backing and a light hop presence in the finish. Light to medium in body with OK carbonation. Seems to be pretty watery, but still fruity with some crispness. Not really my thing, but refreshing and could be pretty easy to drink while out in the hot summer sun."
"This is fairly drinkable and refreshing. Taste is a bit lacking, but overall, this would be nice on a hot, summer day."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours straw yellow and clear with a thick soapy white head that fades. Smells fruity as expected, though not overly stong. The taste a bit watery with some wheat and fruit flavors. Overall, not that great. Wouldn't drink again."
"Drinkability: This is one of the most drinkable fruit beers I have had. I could easy do 3-4 pints of this. Wonderful fruit flavor without the cloying sweetness makes this one a great desert or regular beer."
"D - Not one that I would crave...I wouldn't mind it in the summer when it's hot"
"Well.. the taste sort of ruined it. Very little malt flavor with no real mouthfeel benefits coming from the wheat. Sudsy and slightly acidic. Sort of like dropping a jolly rancher in Bud Light. This beer went downhill the second it entered my mouth."
"D: A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste makes this beer a nice example of a summer beer. However, I felt that the taste could have used a little work. While the subtle blackberry notes were good enough, I felt that the sweet malts could have been a little more robust for a better tasting beer overall."
"Poured into standard pint glass, literally no head however this one was fiarly flat too.. No date on the bottle. Smell is very light malts and very light berry smell. Taste is watery and malty with the blackberries coming in at the end. Overall a little below average to me. Not good not bad."
"5/4/4/3/9 (2.5/5)"
"(rated Jul 9, 2007)"
"D- Drinkability is OK. It's like water with a splash of fruit beer in it. It's low cal and not bad working in the yard on a hot day. That's about it."
"As far as drinkability, if you like the taste, it is definitely drinkable, it's the same consistency as water! I found myself just drinking the rest of the 6pack because they were there."
"Long Trail just moved this from a seasonal to year-round. Why?"
"taste is average. expecting more blackberry. Litte blackberry and little dry is all i can say. nothing big"
"This is not an awful beer, but it is not very flavorful so the experience is poor."
"Taste is at first a bit fruity, some honey, followed by water. Mouthfeel is also watery but not refreshing. Drinkability is poor because there really isn't anything in there that would really make you want to drink another. This really is a bad beer that you should avoid. No one should pay craft beer prices for beer of this quality."
"D: Good for a very hot day for people moving into beer. Overally lacked body and could be improved with recipe modifications."
"D - Drinkability is not very good for this one. The idea of a blackberry wheat beer sounds good but the execution for this particular attempt is pretty bad. Wheat is hard to pick out. It has the approximate mouthfeel of a glass of water (but isn't as refreshing). A crystal clear wheat beer? I don't think so. Suffice to say I'll not be having this one again."
"D: Not great. It lacks complexity and the mouthfeel ruins the drinkability of this beer."
"Light body and sweet aftertaste that leaves my mouth dry. The wheat and blackberry adds a good note to this otherwise bland summer-time wheat beer. This is one beer that I look for once the warmer days are around. It never fails to hit the spot."
"Usually I'm a big fan of the Long Trail beers, this one, not so much. Is way too weak of a beer, barely any taste or body to it. The blackberries are barely noticeable and as a wheat beer it fails as well. LT should go back to the drawing board for this one as this one is a miss."
"weak in every sence of the word, the wheat is to light, i can berly taste the blackberrys, i am not enteirly convinced that i am not drinking water, i loved this beer in the past, maby this is a bad batch. i do detect sour at the end, at least their is somthing i can detect. i could down this like water or funnel this beer if i wanted to get trashed in a hury, not a top sheilf beer"
"Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy, but in a refreshing way. This is very drinkable, a hot weather beer that I see, if memory strikes me, in cooler weather seasons (maybe they are just cleaning out the cooler). Glad I tried one from a friend's fridge, as I don't think I would seek this out for purchase. But no the worst I've had either. It's ok."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability is good. Better than I thought it would but. I could drink another but this stlye really isn't my bag."
"Notes: This beer has a nice solid flavor with an easy to drink body that makes for a nice hot weather refresher."
"I was surprised by a couple things with this beer. First of all the color was clear golden with a medium head and a little bit of lace. Since this was a blackberry beer I thought it might be darker... The taste is that of berries (surprised?) sweet in the middle turning rather bland at the end. Lighter than I thought it would be. All in all it's not a bad beer but nothing to great either."
"Easy to drink, very light bodied and of course extremely sessionable due to the low ABV."
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, wheaty tones, and a small fruitiness. In the taste, again like aroma, small fruit notes and a dry wheat. A smooth and light to medium mouthfeel, with a dryer wheat with small fruit in the aftertaste. Looks like a lager, kind of has lager notes in aroma and taste. Fruit notes are not the big."
"This was the first LT beer I tried and decided to give it another shot. Poured off the tap at the blue-collar dive turned hipster scene Esox in B-town. My pint was a nearly clear, muted yellow. Crystal clear and full of rising carbonation but very little bleach white head and it showed almost no retention. No lacing either. Aromas were very light, grainy wheat and subtle blackberry notes and not much else. The flavors were weak, wheat with generic berry flavor straggling behind. The flavor is artificial however and it lingered on my tongue. The mouthfeel is very watery. Refreshing? Yes. But this is berry-flavored Michelob. Poor example of a wheat and a poor example of a fruit beer. Would be a good picnic beer on a hot Southern day. But a lemonade would be better. I remembered it much better than this. A shame."
"Don't drink it."
"This would make for a great lawnmower beer, or something that would go down with no qualms on a really hot day. I'd have to reach for something else if those parameters were not set, though."
"I couldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting. I noticed that the label boasted <6grams of carbs and I wasn't sure if they were being sarcastic until I tasted it. I feel that this is a decent light beer, but really just wasn't for me."
"This beer is slightly lacking in flavor. I wish the flavor and auroma was just a bit stronger."
"All in all, a refreshing, light beer, but nothing to write home about..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The initial prickly attack on the tip of the tongue is rough, hell let me shake your hand first. It calms down and improves greatly in seconds and becomes quite smooth. For the style, I would love to have some balance with the other ingredients, especially some wheat and hops. This is too pedestrian on offering for a great brewery like Long Trail... it could be so much more."
"It's indistinct, sparse, and thin, but hey, every now and then there's a spark of interesting flavor. Unfortunately, there's never any real ignition. The light character and crisp wheat make it fairly satisfying, but not overly so. That said, now that I've given it a shot, I'll be moving along, thank you kindly."
"D: These came with the summer sampler and I will have a difficult time finishing the rest. Just not refreshing or flavorful."
"Bottle- Slightly hazy yellow pour topped with a fizzy white cap. The nose is grainy and has some pale malts as well as a slight fruity component, which can be attributed to the blackberries, but it is pretty weak. Sweet grainy straw flavour with sugars and pale malts, with only a touch of fruit and slight bitterness. Fizzy, watery, grainy. Below average."
"Hmmm...while I like the notion of a blackberry wheat beer, I think this one failed to deliver. Pours a clear yellow -- this is a filtered wheat beer -- with a modest head and little retention or lacing. No real fruit smell whatsoever, just some faint yeast and malt. Taste was...boring, frankly. There's a bare hint of something fruity in there, but overall the impression was more of a commercial lager beer -- crisp, but with a slightly bitter aftertaste. The carbonation makes for a more fizzy mouthfeel. All that said, it's certainly as drinkable as any cold, pale beer on a hot day, but I'm not going to be searching this one out any time soon."
"Grabbed a six pack this week to help beat the heat on a couple of these sweltering nights. Figured it might be a refreshing beer. Poured into pint glasses. Bright yellow color, large white head that comes and goes in a heartbeat, and minimal carbonation. There was a tiny hint of fruit in the smell. The first sip hits you with some blackberry, I guess, if that's what blackberry tastes like. Very subtle, bordering on weak. A very thin and watery beer. Not a lot of ""wheat"" characteristics at all present. It would have been nicer if this beer had a bit more backbone and then maybe I would have enjoyed the berry flavor a bit more. It just reminded me of fruit flavored lager. On a hot night, it was a refreshing beer, but that's it's only redeeming quality. Could have just had some lemonade instead. Needs improvement."
"I expected more out of this one, especially from Long Trail. I was expecting a berry flavor that would come about a 1/3rd of the way to a Lambic, but no! The Blackberry flavor was weak. The body was also a bit watery for Long Trail, grainy, and thin malts dominated the rest. All in all, a good hot weather quencher, but that's about it. Usually they can take strong flavors and blend them into a drinkable and subtle brew, but they fell a tad short this time. Back To Double Bag!"
"Not a very good beer. That's OK. If I liked everything, how could I ever choose just one to drink?"
"D: To sweet and fruity to drink much more then one at a time."
"This beer poured a straw-color with small head and a lot of visible carbonation in the glass. The smell is very subtle with a little bit of fruitiness and some wheat. The taste is very watery with some not entrirely pleasant wheat tastes and a bit of blackberry taste in the finish. The mouthfeel is very watery and carbonated, and reminds me of seltzer water. I suppose this beer is pretty drinkable if you can get over the large amount of carbonation, but I'm not really sure why anyone would want to. I grabbed this beer on a whim and I was thoroughly disappointed."
"really not that impressed with this beer. I like everything else I've tried from Long Trail, so this is disappointing."
"Light honey color with average head out of the tap. Smells like a mild wheat beer with a nice aroma of blackberries; subtle. It is what it is - blackberry essence, light wheat beer and that's about it. That's not a bad thing, though - light carbonation; goes down pretty easily. Mild enough to drink more than a couple if the season's right; very smooth."
"Had this one in their sample. Well the appearance was a little dull for me. It just looks so watery from the get go that I had little hope in the beverage. The appearance lacked any vitality but the head was decently sized. I noticed the carbonation was strong, but the yellow color is too light. The smell lacked flavor; I could barely smell any of the ingredients this drink was supposed to have. The general smell of wheat was apparent but where were the blackberries? The taste did have a hint of the blackberries but this was more wheat tasting than fruity. An average carbonation does make this a thirst quencher, but with such dullness the mouthfeel begins to lack its potential punch. Overall, a bit disappointing."
"Still not a bad brew by any means but it needs to up the blackberry total to get more flavor."
"I'd get Beck's next time."
"Beer with fruits flavors are generally not my favorite, and this doesn't help. Pours crystal clear yellow in color almost like a macro lager, quite carbonated too but slightly less so. Smells like artifical berry flavor, tastes a bit better, not overwhelmingly fruity but it's not a exciting flavor either. Thin watery mouthfeel. Overall, a big average. Macro people and folks into fruity tasting stuff may liek this but overall it's dull. It was in a mix pack, I'll chug the rest down first before I get to the better stuff."
"D: Awfully light which makes it drinkable but not all that enjoyable."
"Pours a crystal clear straw with no head. This is a wheat beer, right? Nose is like Captain Crunch cereal. Really. I am not stretching this. Captain Crunch. With the berries. Flavor is like...Captain Crunch Berries in my beer. I might not even make it to two sips here. This is ridiculous. I am sorry. But this could quite possibly be the worst fruit beer I have had...or the worst in a long time. Feel. This feels like a host of macros plaguing my tongue. Drinkable? Sure. If you just want to have a load of boring beer. No great berry character. Obvious artificial flavoring. Drain Pour. Avoid like the plague."
"next up was their flavored wheat ; pours an almost transparent yellow w/ a thin head which dissipates rather quickly leaving little lacing in my nonic ; a sour apple/pear smell, thats it ; a tart rather thin flavor, some hop bite, there is very little of any kind of taste here, an indiscernible mixture of juice maybe, i don't really care for flavored brews, but this one is so weak the flavor isn't the problem ; a very light bubbly beer w/ little residual flavor ; perhaps it would be more drinkable if it was stronger..."
"Smells fruity with a hint of wheat, but tastes the opposite: light and wheaty with a hint of fruit. I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers, but the taste is subdued enough to make this one a good, drinkable summer beer. Feels sparkly on the tongue; goes down easily. It makes a good fruity beer for people who don't like fruity beer."
"Several subsequent re-tastings have proved a little better, but only really cold and from the bottle. And that was only to finish off the rest of the 6-pack. I wouldn't recommend this one."
"Drinkability- I would order this again."
"Very pale colored beer with faint aroma of blackberries.Taste is wheat with an aftertaste of light blackberries.Nice freshness and decent drinkability.I would purchase this product again and recommend it to my friends.Overall a decent drinking experience!!"
"This is an interesting wheat beer. It pours a nice golden yellow with a pure white head. It has a very faint blackberry aroma that is more overwhelmed by the wheat smell. The taste is very much the same. It has a very weak blackberry taste. I was kind of disappointed by the very faint taste, but that's the way it is. It finished clean with a faint wheat aftertaste. Not too bad a beer at all, but I would have wanted more taste for a fruity wheat beer."
"Poured clear as day, just a drop of yellow color, and a minimal white head that dissapeared instantly. Didn't look much like a beer. Smell was pleasant, for the most part I could only detect smell of blackberries, but I might have picked up some malty presence as well. The taste was pretty much all sweet, syrupy blackberry. There was a light splash of hops to try to round out the sugary flavor, but it didn't quite do the trick. The beer was well carbonated with a very light mouthfeel. The taste, plus the mouthfeel, left me feeling like I was drinking flavored seltzer, not beer. It was so light and fruity that I could have theoretically drank 10 of them on the spot, but I definately didn't want to. I would pass on this one, there are better fruit beers out there, if that's your thing."
"D- This is a good ""lawnmower beer"" for people who don't like the taste of beer. A little alcohol and a whole lot of fruit taste are the main selling point on this beer."
"D - Definitely a guzzler. For what it is, a light, fruity drink with a touch more sophistication than cooler, it's not bad. Obviously not a lot of complexity or anything."
"I was a little disappointed with this beer. It is not a bad beer, but I come to expect a lot out of Long Trail beers. Long Trail is one of my favorite Northeastean craft brewers. The Blackberry Wheat, however, is average. Every aspect of this beer is average, except the smell. A very nice blackberry smell releases after the pour. The smell, however, does not show through on the taste..."
"This is a very average beer and not much of a fruity one at that. This is light all the way around: light colored, light bodied, light on the fruits, and light on taste. The smell is fruity, perhaps blueberry, grapes, in addition to the blackberry. The beer is watery and bland with a slight bubble gum taste that it imparts. As the beer warms, some of the wheatiness comes through in the form of a flat nut-like taste. The beer pours with some head and some retention and the color is very pale for a fruity beer. You can do much better than LT if you're searching for a fruity beer."
"The mouth feel is light and crisp. Tastes of fruits, a touch of wheat and rather sweet. Not bad but not worth another look."
"Drinkability- A good party and summer beer."
"It's refreshing as a change of pace beer, not sure I'd make it a regular drinker, though."
"It feels slightly carbonated in your mouth, typical of a wheat beer. This beer is very drinkable, like most fruit beers it goes down easily and is gone before you realize it. Refreshing during a hot summer day, it's a must-have summer brew if you enjoy fruit beer varieties."
"Overall this is good tasting beer. I am usually hesitant to drink fruity beers, because so many of them over do the fake flavor, this one has it down just right , nice smell, mild flavor, tastes natural, very drinkable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/8"" white head over the clear light golden (yellow?) brew. Head is gone pretty quick down to a filmy layer of small bubbles, with minimal lacing. Aroma is lightly fruity wheat, with some slightly off vegetal notes. Taste continues what the nose indicated, but fewer off notions. Mouthfeel is very clean, and drinkability is quite good, with high thirstquenchability. A brew I wouldn't throw out of my fridge, but also not one I'd be filling the fridge with."
"Happens to be one of my favorite beers. Spring time in Vermont would not be the same. Golden Wheat beer in color. Can easily taste the blackberry's in the beer. Is great in warm weather. Does not leave an oily feel in your mouth. Easy to drink as many as you want in a day. Hardest thing is finding it outside the New England area"
"12 oz bottle. Pours a pale straw color with almost no head at all. The brew is crystal clear and very few bubbles are in the beer column. Aroma is strong in sweet fruity blackberries, with a soft wheat behind it. Not a lot going on, but there is truth in advertising. The flavor is more focused on the wheat than the berries, but the berry is still prevalent. The wheat comes across very neutral. I find the flavor to be somewhat reserved. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with a solid carbonation. This one certainly is a fruit beer and I can imagine the market for it. This one is very neutral in the beer base with a pretty mild fruit. I feel that the blackberry could have been a touch more pervasive in the flavor. This is a very easy drinking brew. It is something that will appeal to a wide variety of folks that might not drink many other brews. I enjoy it, but it just feels like it is holding back a little in order to have wider appeal."
"D: A good average thirst quenching summer beer."
"Around here, Blackbeary Wheat makes a good beer for converting people from BMC to crafts. It's definitely delicious."
"One is OK on a hot summer day, but not much else to get excited about."
"pours clear golden color with a frothy white head that fades quickly to the beer with minimal lacing. nice aroma of blackberry nothing that overpowers. taste same subtle blackberry up front with a grainy wheat finish. mouthfeel good and carbonation good. refreshing nice and cold but not a session beer for me."
"D: A very light beer (in color, taste, and flavor). For some it could be a good summer beer, but I would prefer this beer to have more wheat flavor. That being said it is very easy to drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have another"
"Cheers!"
"This beer is just above average in every way. The smell has just ahint of blackberrys and the taste is of blackberrys and wheat with a light clean finish. The mouthfeel is thin and light, nothing but better than average. It is however a very easy drinking beer and would be very good and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Really light, a good quencher but that's about it. The bear pictured on the Summer Variety pack with his lawnmower can keep this stuff for when he's done."
"overall, i dont get why everyone doesnt like this. i'm suprised i did, because i dont really like fruit beers, but this one balances things nicely."
"This is a nice summer thirst quencher for the most part. A couple of minor tweaks as noted could make it much more of a summer staple. As it is, I'd call it drinkable but a bit middle of the pack or ever so slightly above in terms of the summer offerings out there, but still fairly nice overall."
"Poured a perfectly clear very light gold with near two fingers of highly carbonated bone white head that quickly disappeared. After the head was gone it looked like I was drinking apple juice. Smells like, and this is a huge surprise, some blackberries, and lots of wheat. Tastes first of wheat which is then followed by a bit of blackberries which linger into the finish but are joined by a resurgent wheat flavor. The longer I drink this beer the more pronounced the blackberry flavor becomes, at first it was quite subdued, by the end of the bottle it was dominant. Mouthfeel is ok. Considering there isn't much of a standard in this ""style"" I'll just rate on my opinion. Body was light, extremely light. This could very well have been flavored water. Carbonation was excesssive at first but disappated and by the time I finished (just a matter of minutes) it was at a low to moderate level. In terms of drinkability this beer isn't all that bad. It's inoffensive for sure and actually quite refreshing on a hot summer's day. Despite my rating I really didn't mind this beer. I probably won't seek this out but if its offered to me I won't turn it down."
"I won't fault Long Trail for making this beer. Nearly every brewery has some light fruity thing, however, most are better than this one. It's overcarbonated, the blackberry is light and the wheat flavor is a touch sour and unpleasant. This tastes like something from BMC. Maybe this bottle is from last year, but probably not. It probably just doesn't taste good."
"12oz brown bottle. Light yellow crystal-clear body with a quarter inch of white head. Smell hints at blackberry. Tastes like blackberry with hints of diacetyl and malt. Flavor is kind of weak though, slightly watery. Light watery mouthfeel with some carbonation present but not too much. Fairly drinkable thirst quencher, but nothing special..."
"Pretty hard to find, but if your in the Vermont area, I'd suggest giving this one a try."
"A "" fruit beer "" has got to have a subtle flavor for me. I got this fresh from Vermont-bottled date on the carton was 4-12-2007! This one hits the mark. Aroma-Light sweetness. Mouthfeel- The Blackberry is present but not overbearing and I can get that bite of the Wheat malt. Finishes clean Light, refreshing, quaffable even. This beer gets good marks for the flavor profile of the fruit and Long Trail makes great beers. Cheers"
"I'm not a huge fan of fruity beers, but this is definitely one of the more drinkable ones I have tried. The fruit taste isn't too overpowering, and the aftertaste isn't too heavy. It's a shame that many people only visit Vermont in Ski season and miss out on this one."
"Light airy mouthfeel,crisp,pleasing. Refreshing beer great for a hot summer day. Got to drink this out on the deck today. A good beer for the ladies my sis-in-law wheatgirl would enjoy this beer."
"Thanks for the throw in bottle mmrngjckt."
"Bubbly and actually very thirst quenching. It's lagery, watery. Good for what it is, which is a beer for non-beer drinkers. It will go down nicely on a summer day. It's slight, but decent. A gimmick beer, to be sure, but a competent one at that."
"D: I didn’t find it very tasty, but it’s not as bad as many other beers in the style that I’ve had. It goes down easy and isn’t filling at all. This is yet another fruity beer trying hard not to taste like beer, so it’s one that may get non-beer drinkers to drink beer. Overall though I didn’t think it was very good."
"I only tried this because my girlfriend bought it and is into fruity beers. Not my cup of tea. Actually, she was dissapointed as well."
"Pale gold in color with a small, stark white head that did not stay around too long. Filtration must have been used, as this is a crystal clear wheat beer. The aroma of this beer was pleasing, with blackberry jumping out and a slight malty smell. The taste was somewhat boring. There was a subtle lightly toasted malt character to it accompanied by wheat. Midway through, some berry tartness showed up, and it finished with slight blackberry in the aftertaste. Hop presence almost undetectable. The mouthfeel of this beer was very light, and I could sit down and have a few due to the light character of this beer. This is probably a beer that was brewed to cater to the crossover macro drinkers, as it kind of reminded me of a macro lager even though it is an ale. Not bad for a refreshing summer beer."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink; very light"
"Sadly a poor effeort from a brewery I normally enjoy. This taste like the brewers came up with a name and are still trying to come up with a beer that fits. Would pair with any bland vegetables. Can't even recommend giving it a try."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a small thin white head with little retention. Aroma is sweet with blackcurrant being very hard to distinguish. Taste is also very sweet with some malt and some very subtle blackcurrant. Body is way too thin and this beer generally lacks character."
"This is a beer to drink when you're really hot and thirsty, and you don't really care what it tastes like. It's a clear yellow color with a small head. Aroma is minimal, some malt and wheat. It had a sweet, fruity taste, was also a little bit bread-like. Nothing very exciting, and not a particularly good example of a fruit beer."
"I started out drinking this at a happy hour near my work. I was happy to move on quickly. Overall, not a great example of either a wheat or a fruit beer. The fruit taste was mild, but noticable. The wheat taste was hurt by the fact that they filtered this beer well, so it ends up being very clear and you don't get the spice of the yeast used. Don't suggest you try it unless you are in love with Blackberries."
"D: The ale has a very light flavor, maybe good for a post lawn-mowing session, otherwise it is way too bland."
"Mouth feel is light in body and has a lot of carbonation."
"Drinkablity: This beer is pretty easy to drink, it never gets old and is never too filling."
"Medium-light body, moderate carbonation. Very crisp, clean beer....refreshing. Well balanced. Pretty much exactly what you would want on a summer day. Easily sessionable."
"12 ounce bottle without freshness dating given. Pours clear, very light amber, near white, minimal head, that quickly departs, leaving no trace of lacing. Nose is just a hint of powdered sugar. This is a light liguid, with a trace of beer like qualities, including some faint notes of fruity berries. Pricey, slightly fruity, lawn mower beer...."
"Not sure what i expected out of this one but was not happy with the outcome. Color was very light, and clear, think almost a mass produced can beer that might be from Anheiser busch. Not much a berry taste of even a wheat taste at that. Would recommend only to someone who doesnt like beer that much. I.e. my girlfriend drank it and she hates beer, because it only had a very slight taste of anything. And this was on tap at the brewery."
"Pale gold with big white head raised on pouring, that disappears in a flash. Aroma of slight grains and slim tart berry aroma. Taste is fairly blank, with bare, Miller Lite-style graininess and virtually no identifiable wheat flavor/acidity. Slight berry tartness, no sweetness. There's no ""there"" here. Just a weak, uninspired brew."
"D- A smooth, simple, fruity beer. Very fruity. :)"
"A PS, for what it's worth: The friend of mine who liked the Sam's Cherry Wheat said he liked this one too."
"mf/d- The body is kinda weak. Thin mouthfeel that isn't bad but i expected more from teh style. This is still a fairly drinakble summer quencher. But to bea tthe heat I prefer lots of alcohol not 4%!"
"D- A great hot weather quencher, that is about it."
"M & D: It has very little mouthfeel and not too much lingering flavors. Only perceived linger is from sour blackberry flavors. Its very watery but I can't say very drinkable since I would need to be very thirsty to finish the 6 pack I purchased."
"Not many levels, very light and bland. A good summer ale for the beach."
"I usually like Long Trail - have been satisfied by the other styles (at least four come to mind). This one didn't do anything for me (other than finishing it quickly - it wasn't terrible enough to not finish - and move on)."
"Long Trail's Blackbeary Wheat pours a clear golden color (and I do mean clear. I almost thought of a glass of purified water). The head is moderate and lasts for only a short time. The smell is faintly of fruity blackbeary's, not much else. The taste is weak, being only a slight blackbeary flavoring. The mouhfeel is weak, watery, thin. I am a bit bummed about this brew, I had higher expectations. This is not a beer I can recommend, it tastes like an artificialy flavored bud (however, do not let this offering from Long Trail stop you from giving their Double Bag a try. Now that is a fine and tasty brew)."
"I've always respected LT and I've been drinking it for years. I've tried this beer just about every year it's been made and I guess I've never known what to say about it, because it's rather non-descript. The aroma of blackberry is very light, the body is a little thin and the aftertaste doesn't last very long. It's low alc makes it a decent ""lawnmower"" brew, but that's about it."
"Meh. Light enough to have a lot, but too fruity in flavor. Not the worst 'fruit/vegetable' beer I've ever had, but not one I enjoy either."
"The beer pours a light golden color, similar to a macro, but with a nice head that sticks around. I smell a grainy maltiness, with a slight hint of fruitiness. Taste is light and refrehing, like a standard American wheat, but with a blackberry flavor, mostly in the after taste. It has a surprisingly smooth but not thin mouthfeel, and I would say its very drinkable."
"Overall this is an excellent hot weather summer beer that is so quaffable. A thirst quenching fruit beer from one of my favorite New England breweries."
"The aroma and color had me excited about this beer. It pours great with a foamy head, but the taste leaves alot to be desired. I enjoy flavored beer but this one did nothing for me. The blackberry flavor was too strong, drowning out the rest of the ingredients and it left a dry, tart feeling in my mouth after drinking it. I have enjoyed all the other Long Trail beers but this one I dont think I will try again."
"This pours a light yellow with a large white foamy head. The color looks like something out of the human bladder. The smell has a very light blackberry and vegatable aroma. The taste is a small amount of blackberry along with a touch of malt sweetness and nothing else. This is the reason I don't like fruit beers. The m/f is light and weak. Although I really like other Long Trail beers,this is terrible."
"M & D: Not much in the way of mouthfeel except that it's very smooth, but definately a very drinkable beer, especially while sitting on the mower on a hot summers day. I would have a few of the during a hot summer day. Good change of pace."
"D- grr this makes me mad! i like long trail's brown ale and hibernator seasonal, and the fact that i have to say i wont drink this again pisses me off!"
"Drinkability: As long as I don't stop drinking long enough to let the filmy character take over, I could drink this all day and all night."
"I like to drink this beer every once in a whlie... I know many people that claim it to be their favorite (not BAs mind you, but that does say something about it's appeal). What this beer lacks in complexity it makes up for in pure ability to refresh. I'd like to see Long Trail make something like a ""Double Blackbeary Wheat"" that isn't so light, has more blackberry taste, and has more complexity."
"Musings: This is not one for me. I have nothing against fruit beers in general. This one is just not that good. I will stick with New Glarus or DFH Fort if I'm looking for the fruits."
"This Long Trail offering pours with a ghostly head that disappears as a specter would. It is a pale ginger-ale yellow with no odor save for the blackberry. Blackberry and wheat are its only flavors, but lets face it, this beer isn't supposed to have any other flavors. One reviewer put it perfectly, this beer almost drinks more ""like a soda than a beer."" Although its fruitiness and carbonation make it easy to drink, i actually poured it out."
"This beer leaves a lot to be desired.... It is somewhat drinkable if only because there is so little there. Probably good to chug down after mowing the lawn or something as long as it is nice and cold."
"Pours as damn near clear as I've ever see a beer, the palest straw color, with a pretty two-finger stark white head that actually sticks around a bit. Nose of slightly skunky adjunct malt and some blackberries. Palate is mostly adjunct malt, a touch of wet cardboard, blackberries, and, oddly enough, something on the order of a nutty edam cheese. Not patently offensive, but not what I think they're trying for, either. Thin body becomes foamy when excited in any way. Not a keeper."
"Drinkability: In the interest of maintaining intergalactic peace, I'm pouring this beer out."
"Well I was surprised at how quickly I finished my beers, it was close to record speed for a beer I was tasting. This is due to the fact that there was nothing to get over or think about after a sip, and I was always hoping that the next sip would be the flavorful one. So in that sense, it's very drinkable, and this is a rare beer that actually is more thirst quenching in the heat than water. If I were dehydrated in the desert this would be the most drinkable beer ever, especially with the low carbonation, nothing gets in your way. However, there's nothing it offers in terms of long term drinkability ... nothing to find, nothing to analyze, nothing memorable. Just nothing. Especially because I love fruit beers and also enjoy wheats, I am disappointed. To top it all off, this was around $8 /sixpack at beer outlets with normally reasonable prices."
"I liked this beer because it was tart and had a very discernable Blackberry taste and smell. Normally I avoid flavored wheat beers like the plague. I bought a mixed 12 pack while in VT thinking my wife would like the Wheat. She did and suggested I try it. I did and I liked the way it tasted and looked. For what it is it is a good solid beer. I will not neccessarily buy it for myself but for my wife as opposed to the ""malternatives""? You bet"
"Hey, this ain't such a masterpiece but it sure tastes fine when I come home sweaty from a run. Label says <6 carbs, which works for me. It's certainly a bit watery a la Mich Ultra, very light colored, and the blackberry taste is pretty subdued. But if you want a quick thirst quencher or two or three, this does the trick just fine."
"NOTE: Long Trail makes some fantastic beers, but this one definitely has to be the most lackluster of their portfolio."
"Long Trail's crisp and refreshing Blackbeary Wheat offers just a hint of fruitiness, and it's much more of a summer quencher than it is a fruit beer. It's crystal clear yellow body is capped by a decent head of bright white froth that holds shortly before dropping; and it's crisp in the mouth with a medium-light body and standard carbonation. The delicate touch of sweet fruit lends interest to it's otherwise basic 'wheat' nose; and it adds a bit of character to it's delicate malt flavor. It's very lightly hopped as not much is needed to balance it; and it finishes dry and refreshing with a light note of residual fruit that fades quickly away. It's extremely easy to drink but I'm not sure there's enough character there to keep it interesting beyond one or two. Still, on a hot summer's day that first one will be quite quenching! Kudos!"
"Mouthfeel was thin and slightly watery. Midly crisp at the start, and has a short sweet finish with berries and wheat. I finished most of the pint, but by the end I had enough. Drinkability way down here. Interesting to try, but not one I'll seek out again."
"Problem is, or not a problem depending on your perspective, this is ~exactly~ the type of brew that is refreshing on hot summer days. It's easy, it's not offensive to anyone I was with, held well. I'll try it again in winter and see if I dislike it immensly by then."
"lagery in its complete emptiness. terrible."
"I drink more just to give it a chance. The bitterness does mellow a bit, and the sweet flavors of malt and jam come through more. Still, it's rather watery, and just not my cup of tea (or mug of beer for that matter!)"
"Good summertime quaffer."
"The taste follows the head. More wheat than blackberry. It's something I could drink one or two of on tap, but I probably won't get a sixpack again."
"This beer poured a clear, yellow color with creamy, white foam that settled but left a little lace on the glass. The smell was lightly fruity (blackberry) with a touch of wheat (?). The taste was lightly tart and tangy with a good bit of fruitiness (berries). The taste was lightly malty with a light hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was crisp and tangy with medium-light body and medium carbonation. It was dry overall with a hoppy and fruity aftertaste. This was a decent beer -- lightly fruity and easy to drink."
"Sorry Long Trail -- I do really like a few of your other beers, but not this one."
"It is still a light gold color with very little head yet a decent amount of carbonation. The wheat is evident from the start and the blackberry flavor comes through immediately afterwards. It is not an overpowering berry flavor which is a big plus but I felt like this years berry flavor was more faint than in past years. I still do like to get a good berry rush without it being overpowering. It is still a great Summer beer and goes real well with spicy food. The berry flavor seems to cut the spiciness of food quite well. I remember in past years thinking that the draft version was always a little better than the bottled one. However, I am not sure if I will have a chance to try the draft version this year. Still, a real good bottled beer that I wish was more readily available in the Boston area."
"Mouthfeel was crisp and clean like a good wheat should be. A very nice drinking beer for summertime."
"The beer is a pale yellow in color with absolutely no head at all. The aroma has a light grainyness with a hint of berry sweetness. The flavor is a great balance between the berry sweetness and a smooth hop bitterness on the finish. A refreshing hot weather break."
"Although I wonder about their need to promote its low-carb qualities, I found this to be a gratifying summer brew."
"really pale straw color with a decent sized white head. the smell consists of a light malt aroma with a hint of blackberries behind it. the taste is very crisp with a slight grainyness and a little bit of hops. the blackberry hits you towards the finish and aftertaste. i'm gonna give a 3.5 for taste because while it doesn't necessarily taste alot like 'beer' it does taste good. i feel like i could drink it for breakfast. it also that mark on the condition that more than two aren't consumed, because this could get to be too sweet if drank in quantity. the body is watery and seltzer like. this beer could be a lot better. it has a lot of potential, but generally falls short of it's mark. it's a little too unsubstantial to be taken seriously."
"I thought I might give this one a try seeing that I would be able to build my own six pack. I saw this and thought it might be a nice beer to try on a summer day. Well it didn't hold up to expections. Pour out a straw color with some decent size head that settled down eventually. Smell was rather weak. Some blackberries in there but quite light. Taste was light as well. It's almost like a fruit flavored macro. Aftertaste was quite watery as well. Pass on this one. There's much better fruit beers out there during the summertime."
"beers during the seasons, they're worth seeking out."
"I really love to drink this beer during the summer. Smooth blackberry flavor not ot over powering. Light color with a nice white head. This beer is great on tap but mostly served in the bottle. During the brew festival in Burlington thye actually but a fresh blackberry in your tasting glass. Nice touch to finish a great beer. Drinking a few is fine having more than three sometimes gets alittle too sweet. Nice change from drinking heavier malter beers. Don't pass this fruit beer by really nice wheat beer."
"My friend who goes to school in Vermont raves about this beer so I had to see what all the fuss was about. Wheat beer just isn't my thing, but if you enjoy it it might be worth a try."
"A pretty good wheat beer with a strong but not overwhelming blackberry flavor. As with most fruit beers, it is a little on the sweet side, but it is smoot compared to some others. The appearance is flaxen with a bit of a head. The smell is sweet and appealing, and the carbonation level is good."
"very lgiht in color seemingly just a shade of gold to it. thick white head that disapetes quickly but has tiny bubles bursting to the top at a pretty regular pace. as i poured it i got a whiff of blackberries, but once in the glass there is only a very faint odor of fruit. other smells include a slightly sour smell and wet grass smells. very crisp taste with a twinkle of blackberries on the back of your tounge and a an aftertaste more like a cheap lager then a wheat beer. very thin and crisp, good summer day beer, very drinkable, not anything that will confound the senses but enjoyable...very much a long trail type beer, if you like there other offerings this will certainly be up your alley."
"This fruit/American wheat style ale is light straw in color. A minimal head is produced with the initial pour. Aroma is lightly sprinkled with blackberries and faint grain/cereal. Berry tartness greets with the first sip along with some light wheat grain. The finish is dry and crisp. Admittedly, I am not a fan of these light wheat beers. However, even the wife, who typically enjoys this style in the summer, thought this was rather weak."
"Light bodied, would not stand up to repeated drinking."
"Brew poured to a very clear yellow with a limited white head that broke down quickly and left hardly any lacing. The smell of this brew was mostly of berry with a wheat aroma in the background. The taste is not that impressive, mostly wheat with what I perceived as a strong berry tang. At first it seemed to be interesting, but a third of the way threw it lost me. Not a great brew in my books, but fruit flavored brews have never been my thing. So if reading this report please take that into account."
"Not bad, its just not a beer Id go for again. I had a six pack of this in my fridge and I was in the mood for a beer and when I thought about this beer I actually decided to just not drink. Not that its that bad, its just so light that it tastes like a quality fruit beer thats been cut with bud. Ill pass."
"Served a straw amber with a more white than off-white head on top. Much better on tap over the bottled version of this brew. Worth a shot if you get a chance to taste a fresh keg. Nice and fruity and quite tasty, but lacking balance. Still, very drinkable though."
"The beer pours a light gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is light and grainy. It has a wheat zing to it with a weak blackberry scent. The taste is average. It's light and refreshing. There has a wheat taste with a very weak blackberry flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very average fruit beer. My advice: add more fruit and increase the ratio of wheat malts to pale base grains. There is hardly any flavor here. If this didn't say blackberry on the bottle I never would have known."
"LT BBW was the first 6-pack I legally bought on my own. It was a hot, late summer day and these brews tasted excellent. While my friends give me shit for liking fruity beers, this is one of my all time favorites. The flavor cannot be matched by any other fruit brew i've ever tried. It poured with a minimal head but with an excellent amber color. The fruit taste is not overwhelming like many others which makes them very drinkable. I could down a few 6-packs in an evening without getting sick of the taste."
"Nice fruit beer taste. Tart, crisp clean berry taste matched with a traditional crisp, clean traditional wheat beer. Not a harsh metallic wheat ale taste that you get, but crisp and refreshing. Lots of blackberries to finish, sharp tart sweetness on the finish. Light to medium bodied very drinkable. Brought home from New England on our recent vacation."
"Clear appearance with very little head..some slight balckberry smell, but reminded me more of a lager than a wheat. Ok in the crispness category, but with very little aftertaste to remind you of the experience. Easy enough to drink, but mainly due to its light quality. Probably a decent choice for someone who likes a light beer tatse."
"Tastes of bright wheat malt with a cold dry finish. Not much aftertaste. I do like that they have not overpowered the actual beer flavors with blackberry. That being said, it a very light and unremarkable ale. Quite drinkable and refreshing. Does make a good beer for a hot day."
"There are some really good fruit ales out there, this isn't one of them."
"Cheers"
"Very light all around. Light color, light aroma, light flavor. Color was as if someone put a drip of yellow egg coloring liquid into tap water. Head was low and white and left the scene quickly. Aroma was of blackberry, but nothing else. Flavor was of light, sweet blackberry, but nothing else. Wouldn't even have guessed that it was a wheat. No malt or hop profile. Watery mouthfeel, a bit of fizzy carbonation. Disappointing selection."
"There is something about fruit beers that I just don't like. With the Blackbeary Wheat it was the overall taste and mouthfeel. The pour was straight golden with not too much in the way of head and no lace to speak of. Smell was dominitated by Blackbeary, but that is to be expected. The taste was nothing but glorified, berry flavored selzter water. No malts, no hops, no nothing. Just very corbonated water. If I want that I'll buy Poland Spring. I wouldn't mind seeing a fruit beer that had a thicker more maltier taste with just a slight aromoa of the designated fruit. I trust that this beer is not indicitive of the entire Longtrail line."
"with a highly carbonated mouthfeel.Overall average but I think long trail could do better."
"Poured a clear gold color with a foamy white head - plenty of carbonation, looks very light. Aroma is soft and crisp, with a hint of blackberries - not as much as I expected. The same is true with the flavor as the fruit taste is much more slight than say, Pete's Strawberry Blond. The majority of the flavor is like a mix between a pilsner and a wheat ale, with a sweetness of blackberry on the far finish. The mouthfeel is very light and bubbly, goes good with the style. I think an unfiltered version of this would add to the character, but this is a good light drinking summer beer that anyone would enjoy."
"I should start this off by saying, I'm not much of a fan of fruit beers, and this beer did nothing to change my opinion. It poured a very light yellow, with a fairly abundant white head that dissipated very quickly. The smell was very sweet with the blackberries dominating. The taste; well I didn't find that there was much of one. There was a hint of blackberry, thankfully not as strong as the smell, and then there was some malt, but nothing all that interesting. I was hoping for some nice yeasty and wheaty flavor, but I didn?t find it. This particular bottle also seemed a bit flat, and didn't give much for mouth feel. All in all this was a very light bodied, sweet beer, that was fairly crisp and somewhat refreshing, but just not my thing."
"If I saw this in the store again I'd pass."
"Edited 1/21/03"
"Nice crystal clear golden color with just a ring of white foam, although it may have been the pour or an older keg. Wonderful aroma of berries that you can pick almost up as soon as they put the glass in front of you. The taste was crisp and clean, but the great berry scent was hardly evident in the flavor. Beer seemed flat and the flavor, though sweet with a bit of malt and berry fruitiness, seemed a bit weak and watery. Other than the smell, I wasn't much impressed with this. I'll have to try a bottle and see if my opinion changes."
"kick ass for the summertime, this brew is clean and smooth. the blackberry aroma is delightful, but a bit misleading because the beer itself does not have a strong blackberry flavor. that is not a bad thing because it is still a great-tasting brew."
"All in all, this is a very refreshing summer brew. Extremely light and smooth, perfect for a hot summer's day, just as the bottle suggests. In addition, I also find the cartoon on the bottle amusing. Heh heh."
"This beer presents with a nice deep golden color adn a foamy white head that emanates a light sour fruit maltiness.  The flavors meld smoothly in the body.  The blackberries do not overpower the true brew qualities; a very refreshing light brew."
