"Very syrupy. One of Sam Adams worst brew, in my opinion."
""
""
"Not a big blueberry fan and it is also artificial tasting."

"For sure a good summer flavor. Clean and easy drinking lager."
""
""
""
""
"A nice crisp lager where the blueberries shine on the finish.  Not the most complex beer, but clean and it delivers plenty of blueberry taste.  I would pick this up again."
""
"Nice and refreshing. Real nice tart, yet not too sweet blueberry taste. Really is rather weak and watery. However actually really hits the spot on a warm summers day, pretty good for what it is~"
""
""
""
""
""
"Another fine brew by Sam Adams and my very first blueberry beer. This stuff is fantastic! The blueberry isn't too overpowering, everything meshes together nicely. Highly drinkable!"
""
""
"9/14...pours hazy purplish color, some foam. Strong blueberry nose, sweet. Strong fruit taste - light tart, surrounded by bready malt that becomes sweet. Very fruity. One of the better fruit beers I've had recently."

""

"OVERALL: this is the first blueberry beer I've had.  It has a mild blueberry flavor, still a beer taste though.  A good summer beer. Fairly good even with fruit taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I couldn't finish this beer. Ended up pouring it out as the blueberry mixed with hoppy bitterness left me highly disappointed. It had quite the unpleasant after taste and overall I wouldn't recommend this selection."
""

"I have to say, I did not expect to like this beer. My experience with fruity beers had not been positive, but this beer was quite pleasant. Especially for a summer beer, this is refreshing and light. In smell, the blueberries come out overwhelmingly, but in taste, the blueberry notes are far more subtle. Likely not a beer I will buy again, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone interested in trying fruit beers."
""
""
"Single bottle from a summer mixed pack poured into a flute. Color is a hazy orange-yellow amber topped by a moderate amount of creamy white head. Aroma is rather unassuming and perhaps bland: Generic pale malt (a little husky), a whiff of grassy and hay-like noble hops and of course the expected blueberry, although this is subtle. On the palate, the latter comes across like a sweet jam rather than fresh fruit, which is OK in my book although the fruit effect does precious little to temper what I feel are some pretty astringent grainy notes in the background. As advertised, a little citrus emerges (lemon?) ... Highly carbonated and on the thin side, with a finish that is a tad medicinal, grass and bitter green fruit. Finish might be a strong suit here. I'd say the merit here is in the fruit being tastefully executed and the usual Sam Adams expertise with noble hopping. On the minus side of the ledger, I am not feeling the malts ... The grainy metallic note described earlier sticks out like a sore thumb. Not an essential offering from this brewery."
"OVERALL:  this is the first blueberry beer I've had, it was different and enjoyable but nothing special.  I will probably not seek this out again."

"Samuel Adams Blueberry Hill Lager brewed by Boston Beer Company with an ABV of 5.5% This brew pours out cloudy amber color with a small white head. Blueberry hill Lager is a unfiltered brew you can not see thought it. The smell is sweet with blueberries and a hit of grains. This brew is different from most brews on the market as far as the smell. It is not bad it is just different. The taste is mild with blueberries and that is about it. There is not much to the taste of this brew. This brew does go down smooth and clean. The mouthfeel is nice and clean, also refreshing. There is nothing overpowering in this brew; it has an ok balanace to it . I was hoping for more in this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a solid 4 out 5."

"Do not come to this expecting Boston Lager in a fifty/fifty mix with blueberry juice. There is a lot less malt, a whole lot less hops, and the blueberries are well balanced. It's a nice summer quaffer, but not something I'd load up on."

"I was really looking forward to a Sam Adams blueberry style brew. My expectations did not quite meet reality. however, this is still a good beer to have during the warmer months. I poured this brew into a pint glass and the first impression was awesome; a great murky yellow color with a thin head. The aroma was definitely blueberry. I thought the overall taste was a little lacking. I would prefer a stronger blueberry flavor vice a hint of the berry that this brew delivers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Funny thing is that I'm not a huge blueberry fan. The berry taste does not dominate and is light & refreshing. I much prefer it over Sam's Cheery Wheat. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"This is rather a limpid pale gold beer that developed almost no head at all. The nose is what I expect from such things: frankenberry cereal, basically. The flavor as well: sickeningly sweet berryish beer with no other flavors. This is very badly made berry beer ever, way too sweet to finish."
""
""
"O - I like how the hops add lemon and citrus so this beer isn't overdone with blueberry. It is more enjoyable than I thought while celebrating the U.S. of A. declaring its independence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing particularly complex, but hey, nothing off or pandering about this offering either, for that matter. If you like blueberries, and a swinging to and fro sweetness, then this one might be for you. Me, I can appreciate the fruitiness, and the attempt at balance here, so I will certainly pop the other one of these from the mixed pack on my sunny deck in the coming weeks."

"Purchased today, part of a variety 12-pack - Best before October 2014, served from bottle into a 14 oz. Sea Dog Brewing (Blueberry Wheat Ale) glass. Cheers!"
""
" Overall: Not my cup of tea, but if I had to drink a blueberry beer, it would probably be this one"
""
""

"The feel is light with a great drinkable feel and makes for a good summer drinker. The crisp body carries some of the sweetness along and keeps things interesting."

"Sam Adams' Blueberry Hill Lager - Not their best fruit beer, but good nonetheless. Out of the bottle is has a surprisingly hazy hue to it. You can see the carbonation and it pours a thick, white head that has nice staying power and lacing. The odor emitted is simply awesome. A nice mixture of blueberries, oranges, and hops that mixes oh so well in your nose. The mouthfeel was mostly disappointing - too much aftertaste for my liking. Taste-wise it was pretty good - the blueberries don't quite mix as well with the citrus as the bottle tries to lead you to believe, but it's not altogether too bad. Overall, it's almost outstanding, but certainly very good."

"A curiosity I wanted to try from the summer variety pack, I thought this was quite good. The appearance was a very hazy yellow, almost amber with a white hail that dissipated quickly. The smell was all blueberries. I was a bit worried before my first taste, but my worry was quickly gone. The blueberries added a nice layer on top of the lager that I thought made for a nice sweet beer for the hot day. It was very thin for the sweet flavors, but a great beer to mow your lawn with."

"O- a super drinkable fruit beer that is great for summer, the blueberries taste pretty authentic as well, well done"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy gold with a weak flat head. Nose is of articficial and natural blueberries, grassy hops, and 12-grain bread. Blueberry flavor is soft without being muted, allowing the pilsner-like qualities to really shine through. This kind of tastes like a ""Bohemia"" with a couple of blueberries and a squirt of Koolaid in the pint. Tasty, not overwhelming, and mild enough to have you ordering one again in the future."

"I love this beer. It's different, delicious, and satisfying. I could drink this beer all day and be happy. I love the carbonation feel in my mouth. This beer is good for any occasion whether it be mowing or partying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty straightforward stuff. Not complex and nothing spectacular by any means, but it's refreshing and tasty enough for what it is."

"Love this beer to death. I couldnt get enough of this beer in the variety pack. great blueberry beer one of the best blueberry beers i have ever had. I could drink this beer anytime anywhere all day long; Tastes so addictive. Blueberries Blueberries Blueberies what more can i say"
""
""
"O: This beer is ok. I have to say that the women who don't really like the smell of beer in general seem to enjoy the smell of this beer. For that I have to give it a little higher rating. Overall, it is not a beer that I would gravitate toward but it is drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a light yellow color lager with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of fake blueberry syrup with overly sweet malt base. Taste is also dominated by this fake blueberry syrup with overly sweet aftertaste. Body is light with good carbonation. This one is a bit disappointing coming from Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-If there was something in the finish the beer would be greatly improved. But right now it is just some semi-artificial blueberries."
""
""
""
""
"I do not care for this beer at all. It reminds me of orange juice after brushing your teeth--that awful taste. Not enjoyable."
"O - Well it's just like the name suggests. A decent lager with huge blueberry aroma and taste, with the standard corn finish. I could kick a few of these back, and I suspect it would go well with breakfast (waffles, pancakes, pastries, etc)."
""
""
""
"Overall – I am by no means a big fan of fruit beers, but this one isn't too bad. It's refreshing in a way and has a nice appearance in the glass. Worth it to try once I guess."
""
""
"Overall this is better than what i expected. It is sweet but not so much that a 2nd maybe in order. Would make a better dessert beer than lawnmower brew."

"O - It's a grainy beer with blueberry flavor--nothing special."
""
"Honestly, I wouldn't have looked for this beer in the first place, but since it came in the summer sampler I gave it a go. Overall not undrinkable and not terrible. Still wouldn't look for this beer outside of the sampler, and probably won't want another one. Mediocre."
""
"Another ho-hum fruit beer. The blueberry flavor isn't bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Like so many soldiers in so many battles in so many wars, we are going to TAKE that hill. Blueberry Hill. As it seems like exactly the Alpine Spring with blueberry flavoring I would have the same main qualm, which is it needs a bit more crispness."
""
""
""
""
"O - I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. Overall a good summer fruit beer with hints of tartness and bitterness and not overly sweet. Great drinkability."
"O: Another good entry beer for people who do not drink beer often. I feel this beer has a strong fruit base that would help transition people into the craft beer movement. Very good blueberry aroma and taste that the beer blends well with, highlighting the blueberry flavor above all other flavors."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad fruit beer at all and I tend to be a bit wary of the fruit beers Samuel Adams produces. It isn't deep, complex, or terribly exciting, but Blueberry Hill Lager definitely hits the spot on a hot day. I definitely would not turn this down and would probably seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an ok brew, not sure if I would buy it in a six pack. I'm not against fruit beers ( I love the Cherry Wheat, and I'm a HUGE fan of pumpkin ales) but I don't think ALL fruit should be used in beer."
""
""
"D- too bad for the subpar flavor, this beer had a lot going for it. Everything else hit the spot though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as the Sam Adams Beers of Summer variety pack goes, this is, surprisingly, a stand out hit. Not a great beer, but at least it delivers what it promises."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much to write about, fairly bland for a fruit beer or other blueberry beers on the market."
"Overall: A pretty decent fruit beer. Nice blueberry flavor and honey notes that avoid becoming too sweet."
"O: I find this blueberry beer to be better than most fruity beers I’ve tried, but certainly not the best. I would not go out of my way for this beer, but I wouldn’t complain if it was available. The blueberry flavor is nice, I’m glad it is a bit more subtle than a shock top, but it still tastes a bit artificial for my preference."

"Overall: I like this beer. It’s fruity without being overpowering, and nicely balanced with the bready flavors of beer. It makes a great summer beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall...although i'm not sure what ""natural flavor added"" means, this fruit beer wasn't bad. and ""smooth lager finish"" means a little rough around the edges. ok."
""
"Mouthfeel: Nothing substantial to report. Flavor and aroma stays with the beer. Easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Orange in color, and a fair amount of carbonation. The beer is one of the worst blueberry beers I have ever had, but that isn't exactly a bad thing. It is not super sweet like others, and the blueberry flavor is pretty mild. It has a very light body and almost feels creamy in the mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability- I thought it was really good. Strong flavor of blueberries. A cold one on a hot day is great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a creamy mouthfeel and while not the best balanced fruit beer I have ever tried, it is still good enough to earn a passing mark. It does seem like a good summertime brew and it’s a nice addition to the Samuel Adams 12- pack summer sampler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – The look and aroma of the beer were quite awesome, but unfortunately the taste and flavor didn’t live up to the former. Even so it is still a decent blueberry lager and at least is one to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a nice summer beer, and one that goes well with the summer mixer 12 packs. I could personally do with a touch less blueberry, but I think that's more my tastes than anything flawed about this beer. Sam Adams probably nailed their intentions on this one perfectly. Anyone who like blueberries, blueberry beers, or even just fruity beers or lagers will probably enjoy this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Pretty much what I expected, a blueberry dominated easy drinking brew. I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers, but its your typical brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is nicely blueberry, but it's a pleasant natural flavor, rather than a weird or artificial one. Indeed, this one's summery, light, and very enjoyable. Sure, it's not super complex or heavy-duty, and seasoned hop-heads and beer nerds will turn up their noses here, but I like this Blueberry Hill Lager just fine, thanks."
""
"O: Meh, this was alright, not really a fruity beer kind of guy. This was not horrible, it was alright, it just was not exciting or enticing to me. I'll have no problem finishing the pack but I probably won't seek them out again."
""
""
"OVERALL: For a lager, it's full enough. For a fruit beer, it's fruity and fresh enough. Wasn't amazing but I quite liked the bitterness from the Tettnang hop variety used here. Helped the flavor a bit."
""
""
"The beer appears a cloudy orange hue with a half inch of white head. The aroma brings blueberry sweets, sugar, malt, alcohol. Sweetened artificial blueberries dominate the aroma and flavor. One dimensional and unrefined. This tastes like a large batch operation, lacking the beauty that real fruit can bring to a beer. Sweet throughout. my body is threatening me with a headache if i continue. This is perhaps not as bad as I may have made it out to be, but certainly not my cup of tea. If you prefer sweeter offerings, this may be worth a try. A few ounces was plenty for me, however."
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of Blueberry Lager, I'm not the biggest fan of blueberry beers and I think they go best with stouts, but this one was different and I enjoyed it much more than i expected, so far it's the best non stout blueberry I have had so far. This beer had good drinkability, it was very smooth, clean, refreshing, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these on a warm summer day, but the blueberry might wear on me after that. What I liked the most about this beer was how nicely the blueberry was showcased, there wasn't any point were the blueberrys felt artificial. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, it was great for what they were going for and I can't think of anything that was wrong with it or that I wish was changed, it was nice just the way it is. I might buy this beer again if they sold it on it's own, i wouldn't turn down one of these on a warm summer day and I think it would be a nice beer to keep on hand for people that aren't too experienced with craft beer, I would recommend it to anyone who likes fruit or blueberry beers, even the regular lager drinker might enjoy this. All in all I was happy with this beer, I started to expect the worst since I haven't had the best track record with Blueberry beers, but this one was surprisingly nice and it may change how I feel about the style. Good job Sam Adams, you guys nailed what your were going for and I have no doubt that this will make a great gateway beer into the craft beer scene for a lot of people, nice work."

"O- Honestly, this beer is making me a little sick. It really isn't so terrible, but man all together it does not do itself any favors."
""
"Had this out of the Sam summer seasonal pack, poured out of the bottle into a pint glass. The color is pretty nice, an orange-copper with a big head. The taste is...blueberry. It's sweet with just a touch of tart, most of of the flavor comes through with the finish. Again...not a big blueberry beer guy, but there are worse ones out there."
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and blueberry jelly aromas. Taste is much the same with blueberry muffin flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is suite drinkable with a solid blueberry presence in the aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s not the type of beer I typically drink but if I did this wouldn’t be too bad of an option."
""
"Overall it has some decent blueberry flavor, grains are mild but balanced, and its enjoyable. I have one left but I really couldn't see getting a six pack of this."
""
""
""
"Aroma of pale malt with some light citrus accompanying the more pleasant than anticipated blueberry character. Flavor follows suite with a subtle berry grain flavor, a lightly chalky aftertaste followed by a brief cleansing sweetness. Blueberry notes don't come across as artificial and are present yet not overdone in my view. Decent feel with a light grain character and ample carbonation. Interesting brew and not overdone. Subtle and pleasant yet with enough fruit character to keep it interesting. For a while anyway."
""
""
""
""
""
"A darn good beer, wish I could find these in 6er's or 12er's. Don't think they do that, though. One of the few highlights of this year's Summer Variety Pack."
"I just got done cutting the grass and Sammy A's blueberry hill lager is great! The beer pours a hazy orange copper with white head that is lacing. The scent has the typical Sam Adams base with hints of blueberry. The first swig brought memories of blueberry pie...a biscuit base with blueberry fruit adornments. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall I think it is a great fruit style beer with without being over the top!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Creative attempt (and success IMO) at a fruit beer in a lager style. Works very well. The blueberry is present in the nose more so than on the palate - doesn't overpower but melds nicely with the lemony-citrus note from the hops and the cereal notes from the malts. Nothing jumps out but there's an overall understated flavor profile that offers a brew that is easy drinking while still being unique. My first in the Sam Adams Summer pack was a success!"

"Fruity aroma , a bit citrusy. Pours cloudy orange yellow with large white foamy head. Retention is good, with spotty lacing. Taste is more citrusy and biting than berry sweet. Slightly sour acidic aftertaste."
"Samuel Adams Blueberry Hill Lager ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
"M - Refreshing and light bodied with moderate carbonation."
"Probably the best blueberry beer I've ever had (though I'd have to have DFH Black and Blue again to say definitively) . The blueberry comes across as fresh and natural and the lager does just enough to contribute without getting in the way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still, it's drinkable and I actually like a blueberry flavor beer from time to time. For what it is designed to be it is solid enough. Good strong blueberry notes imprinted on a lager like backbone similar to Alpine Spring (which I find enjoyable). I think the quality lager characteristics supporting this make it drinkable. For example: Imagine a blueberry Hamm's? Exactly. This one works well enough."
""

"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. The beer pours hazy golden with a thick white head and lots of visible rising tiny bubbles. The nose is filled with aromas of blueberry. I get some of the malt as well, but it's pretty straightforward with lots of blueberry. The maltiness comes out more in the flavor, which brings some breadiness to meld with the blueberry flavor. There is also some hop bitterness in the back end as well, which provides some nice balance to this beer. The body is light to medium with spritzy carbonation. The finish is clean and crisp. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."
"It had a nice golden amber color to it with a nice thick foamy head very bubbly head dose go down a bit. The smell remind me of blueberry cobler with a little hint of citrus maybe. The fell of the beer was very smoth and crisp great on a hot summer day. The tase of the furit was not too over power and well balnce with the wheet and grains maybe a little hops"
"3.25/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.75"
"Very easy to drink, better than several other Blueberry beers, either ale or lager I've tried. My wife would love this, I will have no problem killing off the other 3 in this Summer variety case. The Blueberry in this doesn't seem forced, a pleasant suprise"
""
""

"Summer sampler complete with token fruit wheat fizzy beer to complement the Boston Lager, and the Summer Ale. This one pours bright golden with a slight haziness large slight off white head flowing nicely, leaves behind fine speckled lacing. Aroma gives off some tart notes of citrus and berry jam, pretty one noted sharp wheat accents. Flavor brings tart berry jam with sharp wheat ale acidity, biscuit dough yeast cake action complements with a hint of citrus in each sip. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with full on flowing carbonation not too spritzed up or overdone in anyway linger natural blueberry flavors between sips. Overall not my cup of tea part of a sampler refreshing summery it fills the quota and there's really nothing too off."
"Overall- Better than a lot of other berry beers and could hit the spot if you are indeed craving some alcohol with your blueberries. But as it verged on some artificial flavors, it could have been better."
""
""
""
"Aroma is of blueberries, hops and pale malt. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is of blueberries, spicy hops, lemon zest and biscuit malt. Finish is long and slightly tart. Nice refreshing brew."
""
"i try and taste any sam adams beer i see...their brewery in boston was the first brewery tour i ever went on, so i hold a soft spot in my heart for their beers. also the first beers i really liked, before getting into some really hoppy beers out there were fruit beers. when i saw this blueberry hill i was pretty interested in trying it. i like sweetwater blue and leinenkugel's sunset wheat- so i was keen on seeing what this one was all about. it pours a cloudy golden yellow. the smell was more hops and less blueberry. the taste is way more packed with blueberry flavor than the smell would let on. also, this beer isnt as sweet to me as the sweetwater and sunset wheat, which is fine. those 2 in comparison tend to get the old head throbbing when i drink a ton of them- which i attribute to the sweetness. i think there is enough tang from the hops to make this a really good fruit beer. i think this one could appeal to hoppy beer fans as well as fruit beer fans."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent brew. I would easily buy a 12 pack of the Blueberry Hill Lager. Wasn't expecting this light brew taste from a Boston Brewery Lager."
""
""
""
"Now, I know what y'all're thinkin', but, no, I'm not gonna make a Fats Domino reference. It's just too easy, man. Regardless, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises syrupy blueberry (y'know, thick and partially artificial without bashing you over the head with it's fakeness) over a carpet of very light biscuit, barely hanging on for dear life against the torrent of berry. The taste proves my suspicions about the artificiality were warranted (if still wrong in full reality) as some plastic weeds its way into the berries. In the background, those touted noble hops serve only to provide a clashing foil of greenery for the berries, muddying the waters into a bayou of unhappiness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thankfully dry and quick finish. Overall, things just didn't go well with this one, as the berries come across as fake and the hops battle rather than bolster the fruitiness. It's not as bad as the horridity that was the Cranberry Lambic, but it's certainly nowhere near good, either."
"O: definitely a novelty beer. liked the smell, but the taste was kind of disappointing. refreshing but i wouldn't seek it out."
"Fruit beer is a difficult thing to get right. It is rare to find a beer that brings real balance, flavor, and drinkability. This beer makes a good attempt, but ultimately falls short of being rally good. It is a slightly heavy, pale golden color. Nice white head. The aroma is predominantly blueberry, with a nice whiff of earthy hops. There is as sweet, pale malt underneath. Unfortunately, its smell reminds me of boo-berry crunch. The taste is a bit ore beer like, with some malt and grain character and some more genuine berry flavor. Soft finish. Light to medium mouthfeel. Not my style, and surely not great, but good."
"and flaver. A very enjoyable brew! The blueberry taste does not give a bad aftertaste and leaves a nice flaver of blueberry, as well as the flaver of a quality lager beer."

"O: a very nice refreshing brew, going to be very nice when the hot summer weather rolls in, really enjoying this one right now"
"Merely okay. Average. How good can a blueberry lager be, anyways?"
""
"Cloudy gold topped by a solid slab of thick foam. Tart, juicy blueberry aromas upfront with a sort of creamy sweetness. A little less blueberry forward in the flavor...berry sweetness, grain, spiciness, and a citrusy touch near the end. Light, slightly acidic, and decently crisp. A decent warm weather drinker, but not something I need more than one of."
"If you enjoy fruit flavored beer, you'll probably like this beer, especially if you're a fan of Sam Adams."

"O: A decent blueberry lager with an almost blueberry pie-like aroma and taste from the malts. Not bad, but I don't see myself drinking this often aside from maybe with blueberry pie during a cookout"

"Not as a good as I’d hoped and I’m a sucker for fruity beers. Good for the summer, but I wouldn’t have it again."
"Overall - Another fruity brew offering from Samuel Adams. If you like blueberries, you'll like this. Not overtly sweet, like some of the other blueberry beers on the market. Not as good as their Blackberry wit, but it beats the hell out of it's summer mix counterpart, Porch Rocker."

"I would take this over many if not most of the other lagers from Sam Adams, or anywhere else I suppose. The blueberry is clearly there in both smell and taste, which is refreshing. The aftertaste provides some barely noticeable tartness. The finish has that familiar lager blandness to it. This isn't a bad drink at all and a little less boring than the standard lager. Enjoy this served quite cold on a hot, summer day. I probably would not get it again."

"Overall an OK Beer. Not something I would buy as a six pack but it isn't something I would pour out either. Picture of an OK Beer."

"FIrst, before I try it, I love Blueberry wine and beer, if done right. We will see soon. Pours a very hazy golden color, with a solid white head. Without trying to seem ridiculous, it has a very blueberry smell to it. It has a bit of activity to it. As of now, trying one, it is very drinkable, very good. I love blueberries. I bought a Sam Adams summer sampler, and while it did snow in Indiana today, it is still enjoyable. Probably would be a good breakfast beer lol. I can't imagine eating steak with this, but if you were at a festival, wanted to drink with breakfast, or in the afternoon with a lot of sun, watching shows, this could be refreshing."

"It's all quite solid, but sometimes I really wish Boston Beer Co. would be willing to diverge a bit from the Boston Lager template. I mean, yes, this is obviously quite different from Boston Lager, but like nearly all of all of SA's beers, it has just about the same body as Boston Lager, as well as the same bittersweet biscuit yeast back end. It works, like I said, but just barely, and deviating a bit could have helped it come together much more nicely."

"Overall- An enjoyable fruit beer with natural tasting blueberry flavor."
"This poured out as a clear golden color with a white head on top. The retention is pretty good and there is a moderate lacing. The smell of the beer is a fruity, there is a delicate aroma of sweet blueberry on the nose. The taste of the beer is sweet, plenty of blueberry flavors. There isn't much depth to this beer, very one dimensional. The mouthfeel of it is lighter bodied, good carbonation but a little on the cloying side. Overall this beer is a little too sweet, I think it will be better in the dead of summer."
""
"I don't think that blueberries work well in lagers. They're better suited to ales and I say this only because I love blueberries and anything flavored with blueberries. However, this isn't as bad as Wild Blue (ugh!)."
"So they did a pretty good job on this one, and the blueberry flavor seems authentic. I still am not convinced that blueberry is an appropriate flavoring for beer, but then I'm not Swedish. From a 12 oz bottle purchased at Ralph's supermarket in San Clemente."

"O - Well, nothing wowing here but i gotta say I'm enjoying it. Blueberry is everywhere with this beer, and although it's a strong taste of it, it's pretty natural tasting to me. Balanced out with that Lager yeast in there. Refreshing as beer gets, i'd drink it again but i can't say i'd buy it again for sure. Definitely worth a try though. Cheers!"
"o: I could imagine a setting where this beer might really hit the spot. Every other time, i would think it's too fruity. This is an okay offering from SA."
"O- Not a huge fan of this beer. It isn't awful, but I certainly will not seek it out."

"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a white head. The aroma has a touch of biscuit malt, but what really comes through is a ton of sweet blueberries. The flavor is more of the same. The blueberry notes add some nice flavor, as well as a good bit of sugary sweetness. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
