"Good beer for GF folks"
""
""
"An interesting little GF beer. The strawberries are an interesting touch and give it some character where it might otherwise be a bit boring. Not too shabby as a dessert pairing."
""
"When I read the label, I thought it was a joke.  When I tasted it, I knew it was.  It looks like either a urine sample or a glass of apple juice.  It smells like liquid hand soap, strong with strawberries.  The taste is....well.....not good.  I bought a 4 pack, split the first bottle with friends at a tasting, and am now wondering how I will get rid of the other three bottles."
"Definitely has a different taste.  Not unpleasant at all.  If I was gluten intolerant this would be a fine choice."
""
"Sweet merciful shit. I'm almost impressed with how bad this is.  Sam and co., sometimes when you're wondering if you CAN make something, stop and consider if you SHOULD. Then never make Tweason."
""

"I never thought that I would say this about anything from Dogfish Head Brewery. This was a bad purchase - sorry."

"overcarbonated, strange aftertaste, just not good.  couldn't even swallow it.  spat it out and drainpoured :("
"First gluten free beer...not trying another."
""
"I typically don't like fruity tasting beer but this one seemed fine to me. It finished well as opposed to other beers that I have tried with fruit in them."
"Interesting brew, worth a try"
""
""
""
""
"Don't understand the low ratings, this is a great summer beer."
""
""
"Surprising good taste.  Hint of sweetness, probably from strawberries."
""
""
""
""
"Really good fruit beer with a nice sour twang to it"
"Refreshing. Sorghum gives a slightly weird aftertaste"
"Not a bad fruit beer, its easy to drink and hides the alcohol well."
""
"Good refreshing specialty beer, just not my cup of tea..."
""
""
""
"I'm not sure but think this may of been a bad bottle. I didn't notice a strawberry smell or taste,p. The taste bwas of  mild tartness finishing with a bland  tingle on the tounge.  will try again and compare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is not a beer for people who love IPAs or drink beers every day. This is the beer that your wife or girlfriend will actually enjoy. Or the beer that you can serve to your gluten intolerant relative during the holidays. It is a full strawberry flavor with a honey sweetness at the end."
""

"Pours a golden color with a tint of red. The foam was very fizzy and did not trail the glass. The smell was full of strawberries to the point where I couldn't smell anything else. The taste was an intense burst of tart from the strawberries which then mellowed out due to the sweetness of the honey. An interesting brew."

"Adding honey and strawberry to mix did make the experience of a sorghum beer better but it's not something I would see myself getting as a gluten tolerant person. The strawberry is more there than Belmont's strawberry blonde but not overpowering. It does leave a weird aftertaste like you ate a strawberry cough lozenge. This is probably from the sorghum. Overall it does have a bit of mediciney vibe to it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting beer. I would not drink it again. Maybe on tap it would be a different feel. Definitely stick with barely based beverages rather than sorghum. Creative beer but overall not that tasty."
""
""
"I was surprised to find this beer's fruity aroma had a mildly tart hint. Part of me wants to session this beer on a lake when it's hot out, but there's something slightly off about the grainy/fruity taste of it, and I honestly don't know if I could make it past two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden copper color. Weak head. Semi sweet, fruity aroma. Clean flavor. Mild graininess. Sweet strawberry jam. Light body. Over carbonated. Not my thing but ok for what it is."

"Bottle: Poured a reddish/brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of unrefined grainy notes with light strawberry flavours is a weird mix and not the most enticing. Taste is also dominated by loads of unrefined grainy notes with some light unsweetened strawberry flavours. Body is light with OK carbonation. Body is light with OK carbonation. I’ll leave this one to people that don’t tolerate gluten."

"Of the gluten-free beers that I have subjected myself to recently, it has been the fruit-infused ones that were the most palatable. An aggro pour produced a brief finger of fizzy, pinkish-white head with minor retention. Color was a yellow-gold (SRM = 4-5) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of green apples and airplane glue, just as earlier reviewers had remarked! Ha ha. At least, it is something different. Mouthfeel was thin, watery and fizzy, like soda water. Taste was palatable, with the strawberry really shining through that apple vinegar taste that is so prevalent in these beers. Finish was semi-dry, again thanks to the strawberry cutting through some of the sharper flavors to round the edges. I am glad that I do not have Celiac, but if I did, it would have to be the fruit-infused beers that I would turn to."

"Light bodied with light fizzy carbonation. Not much to get excited about here. Not worth seeking out again."

"I do admire Sam and DFH for their breaking molds and pushing beer to its outer limits. But still, the beer has to taste good! And when I get burned with beers that don't impress me and usually cost more, I have to say no..."

"O: certainly a unique brew... nothing really ""off"" about it, aside from the complex green flavors... perhaps it's just that shock of tasting something different - it did grow on me a bit by the end... all in all, it's one of the better gluten free (barley free) beers out there"

"Overall: A disappointing entry from one of my favorite breweries. I knew going into this it wasn't going to be the best, judging by its ratings. I've had a few gluten free beers, and a few made with sorghum, and those weren't great. But this one....disappointing. No reason to try this one."

"Poured from 355 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 9/28/2013."

"O- not bad, but that aftertaste..."

"Light, fresh, with a slight fruit taste, this ale from Dogfish Head doens't have quite the wow of many of their other products. However, it is quite drinkable, especially since it has such a light feel and mild taste. Not bitter or hoppy at all. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it again, but if someone offered me one, I'd take it!"

"Has a strong strawberry and honey taste, but surprisingly is not sweet. Has a dry, syrupy feel that reminds me of the Immort Ale. Feels fizzy on the tongue. Despite the strangeness, it is still enjoyable, though not for everyone. For me it’s the strawberry that helps lift it."
"Overall - This is disappointing. Lacks flavor, any type of complex flavor or balance. Tastes like a cheap table wine or some half-assed girly mixed drink at some yuppy bar. Nothing id recommend or revisit again."

"Overall: An interesting and decent take on a fruit beer. Very light but the strawberry taste is nice."
"O- Being a gluten-free beer, this one is drinkable. Not my favorite mix of flavors, but it's not over-the-top sweet to the point of being undrinkable. Drinks somewhat like a soda, but it's nice to see a noble attempt at a gluten-free offering."

"Final Thoughts: I’m not sure this beer was all that fresh but it’s difficult to find any flaws. The fact that this beer is gluten-free is hardly brought up in the flavor. Another good beer from a great brewery. Would I drink it again? Yes, tweasonally."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Screaming with odoriferous emanations of strawberry shortcake, Tweason' ale is an inviting entry into the fruit-beer market; being gluten free is a massive added bonus. Hazy reddish amber with a sedentary head, this brew is quite tempting. the nose has a beautiful essence of the strawberries within, but the malted nose gives it authenticity. Slightly bitter and marginally sweet, this beer satisfies quite well. If you are sensitive to gluten, this is truly a wonderful alternative to those brews with similar attributes which are simply non-potable to the Celiac sufferer. Kudos to DFH."

"Overall: I had no idea what to expect with this one, and it's a very solid fruit beer. I've only found a couple of others that I genuinely like, and I'll now add this one to the list. Nothing outstanding that'll make me search it out, but when I'm in the mood, and it's in my field of vision, I won't hesitate to pick it up."

"O - This is a nice beverage to drink. My wife is gluten free and why we have it around the house. I definitely think of this more in a sparkling wine category vs. a beer category. That being said, for what it is, it is good. In the beer spectrum, its only ok."
""
"Overall: An excellent beer for those who seldom drink or have an aversion to gluten. Very much a warm weather beer that borders on a cider with its strong strawberry flavor. A must for the gluten-free"
""
""
"O - 3.50 - This ""beer"" taste more like wine than beer. It seems more like a novelty than anything."
""
""
""

"Call me crazy (trust me, you won't be the first, nor will you be the last... so I don't care), but this is a pretty right on fruit beer that is also gluten free. I mean, if I couldn't have gluten I would load up on this brew. It's great. Dogfish did a great job on this one, great quality, great taste and all around pretty fair price for a very good four pack. If I see this again I am liable to by more without much thought. I'll be enjoying the rest in the weeks to come, that is for sure."
""
""
""
"This ale is interesting....the liquid is utterly clear, with a thin white head, and a stream of bubbles. The smell is subtle, but multifaceted with fruit...berries. I got strawberry, as noted on the label, but I also thout I smelled some raspberries. The beer is semi dry, with a lot of fruit. There is a slightly astringent, grainy taste. Almost salty as well? Medium body. Although not an exceptional beer, this beer is very engaging."
""
"Flavor is considerably more dry. The honey tastes entirely fermented out, the flavor is more floral, mixed with strawberry. And even though it's dry, there's no particular hop character. Pretty good, but could just as easily be mistaken for a dry flavored cider. Pretty fizzy, but not too bad. Drinkable if not super exciting."
"I am honestly not thinking about this as beer, but as a gluten-free beverage. The problem is that Tweasen'ale is trying to be both a beer substitute for someone who must avoid gluten, and it's also trying to approach the problem through fruit and honey. It doesn't make it on either front: it has no relation to a standard beer and the fruit tastes very candied and artificial in the final product. While I am a Dogfish Head fan, I think they missed the mark here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would like to see what this beer tasted like without the strawberries, they add a bit that I think might just clash with the sorghum, it would be nice to see what it is like without it and perhaps with some other fruit or just no fruit and fermented with a different yeast strain or aged in some kind of barrel to give it some more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours a crystal clear light honey color not unlike an IPA. The aroma is floral and honey. No noticeable head. Texture is watery with medium carbonation. Body is light. Taste is definitely unusual. I am not sure what they are trying to do here. I respect what the brewmaster was trying to do, but it seems like a stretch to call it an ale. For now, this is not a brew that I would come back to often."

"I had this on tap over the weekend at the brew pub in Rehobeth. It was fresh, clear and had a fantastic taste. The color was good and the smell showed the fruit added to the batch. I'd recommend it as a great medium bodied beer for the summer. It wasn't too heavy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love everything Dogfish has but this is the worst beer by far that I have ever had. Hands down, crap in a bottle; for $50 bucks a case I not only feel raped but robbed as well. This should be flushed down a toilet, only I fear that insects may come across it, drink and be just has disgusted as I was. I hope this beer burns in hell for what it did to my mouth."

"Overall I can appreciate the effort but perhaps strawberry is not meant to be in an ale as the sweetness overpowered the rest of the beer."
"This brew is okay on a hot day, I am drinking it on a hot day right now, but there is too much carbonation and not enough hops, like most fruit beers, for me to say that I would like to have this again."
""

"Overall: One of Dogfish Head's most refreshing beers, even if it is a bit odd."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, fruity scent that seems a tad boozy; definitely lacking a malt base. The taste is decent. It has a smooth, yet tart with an apple cider flavor. It goes down slow and easy with a watery, sour finish. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a drinkable, non-malt beer with character. I like it for what it is, but nothing more."
"Overall meh, didn't have high expectations but the wet cardboard cork flavor really hurt the beer even more. If it wasn't for that it would be tolerable, but that just ruins any possibility."
"This beer had a copper color when poured with a thin, light brown head. The beer had a very light mouth feel. The beer tasted like strawberries with hints of honey and molasses. The finish was tart and light. I liked that the beer had a light finish, but I was hoping for a stronger flavor. With that being said, this beer is still far more flavorful than other gluten-free beers out there."

"Pours an orangish color with a thin tan head. Aromas of strawberries. The taste starts with a hint of strawberry, then some musty sweetness, then a tart, light finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light, especially for 6% abv. Overall not a beer that I would seek out again, but decent enough tasting."

"Pours a crystal clear reddish copper with a short-lived head. Aromas are amazing - hyper floral notes of rose petal potpourri, grandma's perfume, and ripe strawberries. Tastes is odd but not unappealing - the best I can describe it is as rose water with phenolic honey hints. Body is thin and watery, under-carbonated. An interesting beer to sample but not to stock up on unless gluten-free is your game."

"O - Gluten free, not that good. Pass if you can. The wife wanted something light, this is all I could offer. Sorry."
""
"For a gluten free beer, this is quite powerful. It's almost like strawberry juice/water. Strong and pungent and I can't really get any subtle character off of it. It's a nice drinker, and for someone with a gluten allergy I would think it'd be nice. But for me, it's way too strong."

"O- This is a fair strawberry mead that is a bit one dimensional. I really like the flavor of sorghum but it doesn’t show up here and there is not much else to taste."
""
"Overall I think it's my first gluten-free beer, and thus it's hard to compare against others of its kind. However, it's tasty enough, although not one of my favorites from DFH."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My wife has Celiac and while she's not a beer fan in general, I got this for her to try. Overall I would not drink this regularly, but at the same time given the reputation of many gluten free beers, I figured if any brewery could pull it off it would be DFH and I was right. Kudos for the effort."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Not a bad beer considering it's unconventional ingredients, but I would think a beer-loving, recently discovered celiac could find a better beverage choice..."
"Poured this Fruit Beer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a clear reddish golden color, produced a thin fizzy white head (this beer fizzed like a soda)- Very poor retention and no lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this ale was dominated by strawberries and honey. Medium in body, since this is a gluten free beer- it lacks much of any malted base- in fact it has none- but with that said, there are flavors of citric oranges, lemons and tart strawberries. Thank God I don't have an issue with Gluten- it was nice to try this brew but nothing that I wold ever buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"If I ever do decide to go gluten-free (and I just might), I wouldn’t hesitate to drink this. In the meantime, I’ll stick to my IPAs and lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a below average Fruit Beer, since this is the only gluten free beer I have tried, I really can't compare it to others in the style, it wasn't terrible, but to me it tasted much more like a sparkling fruit wine, then a beer. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, but the flavor couldn't hold my attention, this might be nice in the summertime, but for now one is enough for me, I wouldn't want to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't that bad and it was the most complex aspect in this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how similar to a sparkling fruit wine it tasted, I think some more hops would give it more beer like quality's. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it just isn't my thing, and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone unless they actually have a gluten allergy. All in all I wasn't a fan of this beer, I didn't know what to expect from this style, but it ended up not being for me. I think it's cool Dogfish Head made a beer for people that normally can't drink a beer, but if your not one of those people it might be best just to avoid this beer all together and be thankful you don't have a gluten allergy. This was a cool concept that really didn't come together as well as I hoped, it was good attempt, but this beer just isn't for me."
"Glad I tried this.. but I won't ever have it again."

"I appreciate DFH's willingness to experiment, but jeez you don't have to bottle everything. If I had to live a gluten free diet I'm looking for another way to catch a buzz."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 4/4/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge honey, tart strawberry, apple cider, pear, light caramel, light bread, and a touch of raspberry. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of honey, strawberry, pear, apple cider, wheat, floral, herbal, earth, and light tart raspberry. Zero bitterness; with lingering notes of honey, strawberry, pear, apple, raspberry, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Good flavor balance, with a fair amount of flavors and decent complexity; quite dry on the finish with zero cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly syrupy and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty nice gluten free sorghum beer. A fair amount of nice flavors with decent balance; and extremely smooth to drink. This was pretty enjoyable stuff."
"If you're one of those Gluten-free types, give this one a whirl. If you're a barley drinker, give it a whirl too, for something different."

"O: I suppose if I really had celiac disease, I might turn to this one every now and then, but since I don't, I won't. The flavor was somewhere between beer and strawberry lambic, but not as good as either. Honestly, this was below my expectations for Dogfish Head. If you must drink a gluten-free brew, might I recommend Estrella Damm Daura?"
"For the customers' and mine own edification (and, let's face it, for the sake of the tick), I felt I should try this new gluten-free beer. It pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises sourdough, light maple syrup, a twinge of stone fruit, and a kiss of chamomile. The taste continues the bread's dominance, though now it's clear this bread was made without a gluten source, the sorghum flavor being not only distinct in its own right, but clearly on display here. This is the major failing of the majority of gluten-free beers, as this none-too-tasty flavor is never properly masked. There's a hint of strawberry here, too, as advertised, but it's faint, an echo in the bready darkness. A honey-like sweetness pervades as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, this is one of the better gluten-free options out there, but it could use more fruit (never thought I'd say a DFH beer needed more of its fruit component), if for no other reason than to mask the sorghum better."
"Overall- I don't remember it being quite this bad the last time I had it, but perhaps the temperature being thirty degrees or so lower is affecting my palette. Better out of the bottle, but I'll leave it alone next time. Not quite a drainpour, but far too close... nevermind, not really worth finishing."
""
""
"Sorry, smell, not that good. Taste, not good. Mouthfeel, not good. Overall. ..you guess."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a light to medium golden amber with a very thin white bubbly head. Left really just lacings almost immediately after pouring. Aroma was slightly sour, with noticeable alcohol, and a hint of strawberry in the back end. Flavor reminded me a sweet slightly dry wine. A small hint of fruity strawberry was hiding in the back, but was very minute. Didn't coat very well in the mouth, and ended up with a fair amount of bubbles despite not having any carbonation. Overall, a bit on the unusual side. Really reminded me more of a wine than a beer, so not at all what I was expecting."
"So this is the type of beer a non-beer drinker would enjoy. Not for me."

"I always respect the Dogfish Head experiments, but this one is just not for me and I'm happy that I’m not restricted to gluten free choices. Glad I tried it, but I won’t seek this out again. The one part of this beer that I didn’t like was the hard to pin-point sour funky taste, which negated the nice strawberry flavor."

"o for a gluten free fruit beer, its really good. for a beer overall... nothing fantastic. definitely a beer for newbies."
"O: This beer wasn't as bad as some other gluten-free beers I have had before and this may be due to the strawberry flavors making things a little more palatable."
""
"Overall-- gluten free or not, I've had worse. Maybe I'm a sucker for a fruit beer, but I don't hate this. It's not one I'll be buying regularly by any stretch, but it isn't one I'd shun either."
"This has to be rated in comparison to other gluten free beers. No gluten free beer is anywhere, compared to ordinary brews. My daughter, who enjoys a beer as much as anyone, found problems nagging her for years were due to gluten intolerance. That Dogfish Head waved its brewing wand and came up with this superior (for gluten free) beverage for people like her deserves commendation. I understand folks who may not have tried other gluten free beers, but this is a fine effort in that genre. Imagine you could not drink your fav brew, or any usual beer again, and you might be happy to down a Tweason’Ale occasionally."

"Poured gently into an Ommegang goblet, yielding a very brilliant tangerine/light maple hue. Transparent, without sediment, and a short lived fizzy white head of 1"". No lacing in the glass. The bouquet is of much fruit, honey, and is there a touch of buckwheat in there? I didn't realize there was actually buckwheat used in the beer until I checked the bottle. Apples, strawberries, maybe a hint of lemon peel somewhere in there. The flavor is sweet in the forefront, with the honey and sweet fruit flavors shining first, then a train of sour apples and strawberries follow, finishing with a lasting sour tail and the slightly earthy tone of buckwheat honey. The grain profile is different for sure, but I can't quite describe it just now. It tastes like there's a bit of wheat in there but I can't really tell. What I do know is that it's quite light, effervescent, and a pleasure to drink."
"Dogfish Head Tweason'ale is a very lively and clear golden brew with no head. It has a sweet and sour aroma with a large dose of strawberry. It's super light bodied and and very lively in the mouth. The finish is a little chalky. It tastes a little sweet and pretty sour. It kind of has a strawberry candy or strawberry gum flavor going on. Some herbal bitterness comes in at the finish, but the sourness overpowers everything. This seems like it would be a light, easy-to-drink affair, but it ends up being kind of a challenge."

"It has a fruity, wine-like nose of strawberries. The smell is very sweet. It tastes a bit odd up front (from the sorghum I'm assuming) but after that the taste of honey is definitely dominant. The beer itself isn't overly sweet like honey, but the actual flavor of honey is predominate and it sticks around in your throat, like you were drinking a cup of tea with honey in it. Surprisingly, I found this offering from DFH really good. I was wary because of the ""gluten-free"" thing along with a beer containing strawberries and honey, but its pretty good. I'd drink it again."
""
""
"Overall: I don't get much about this beer. I understand the gluten-free angle, but there's really not much to mark this as beer. It tastes more like a fruity sparkling wine or rosé. I usually appreciate DFH's attempt to make unique and strange beers, but this just tastes fizzy and artificial. I can't see myself paying DFH prices for something like this again."
""
""
""
""
"O- I dont know what to honestly give this. I mean it is dogfish but i think they may have missed the mark a bit on this one. An average fruit/vegetable beer at best."
""
"I wouldn't lump this in with beers or ales - although it has some origins in that realm. At least it isn't too unbalanced. I can't see drinking a second one and do not intend to buy this again."
"O: This is my first gluten free beer and my first taste of strawberry in a brew as well. Pretty good overall, nothing that really turns me off about the beer. A good beer for chicks, but not bad to try or indulge once in a while."
""
""
""
"O: Not very good at all. Buy only a single if you must try."
""
""
""
""

"DFH got what they were going for, just not a fan of the strawberry. Pours a pretty reddish pink with a small white head. Smell is a straight strawberry and grainy aroma. Taste is too sweet and slightly sour, fake strawberries, nothing else. Slightly watered down, and yet a bit syrupy due to the low carbonation. No real malt flavor that I can pick up. Kind of like a wine cooler. Meh. I guess it's good they offer a gluten free option."
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled on 7/03/12. This pours crystal clear light golden color with a fuzzy short lived white head. The smells are fruity, strawberries, honey, something a little funky. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty bad, I'm guessing its better than other glutten free beers (although I've never tried another one but this), you get a funky off taste, some strawberry, and honey."
""
"O: Very interesting beer, I don't know quite what to make of it. It is very different, I can't get the impression of red wine out of mind. It has a distinct berry flavor and an assortment of other flavors my taste buds cannot place."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, A Unique beer that missed the mark for me. Glad I tried it, but won't buy again."
"Tweason'ale pours a light bodied strawberry water, rosish pink in color with little head but plenty of carbonation. The nose is light and pretty simple. There is just a touch of sweet and slowly tart strawberry and also a tonic water like element to it. The flavors are fruity and sweet up front with plenty of strawberry water. It has a slight tartness as well but has plenty of that tonic element once again. It drinks a little watery with just an artificial aspect about it. For a gluten free though, it's not too bad. It's at least different than most other options."
""
""
"Sure, this was light on the palate but it was only after I finished the bottle that I could tell that there was just a bit of booze in this. I was hoping that Dogfish Head could brew a beer of this style that would stand out from other examples but if these guys can't come up with something that stands out, who can? Take this for all it's worth, which isn't much when placed next to the 60 or 90 Minute IPA."
""
"Overall for a fruit a beer this is not bad. I wouldn't want to have more than one at a time, but I wouldn't say no in the furute to having this again."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall a powdery sweet strawberry flavored experiment that only Dogfish Head could make at least somewhat interesting. Worth trying one just to try. But if I go fruit, I much prefer their Festina Peche.  "

"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of honey in it, as well as some strawberry. The flavor is similar. I get a lot of grain and apple cider like notes, as well as some strawberry and honey. While all of these notes can be good in a beer, they don't go well together in this one. The beer tastes messy and is just not to the usual level of Dogfish Head beers. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"I appreciated DFH's approach to making unusual beers, especially one like this, but this just isn't working for me at all."

"Overall: Every time I try Gluten-Free beer it reminds me of soda. The body, the carbonation, even the bubbles. From the very first pour the head is made up of such big bubbles it looks like soda foam, not the thick, creamy head associated with beer. The taste isn’t much different. The sorghum always reminds me of cream soda in some weird way, not the sweetness level. Just very mildly vanillin. I just can’t get past the lack of malt. Frankly I don’t have to either. Every time I try these it’s a reminder of how good I have it. Thank god for beer…"

"A very unique beer, as mentioned above, very easily distinguished flavors. Enjoyable."
"Bottled on date of 12/21 (almost 8 months ago), but still tastes fresh like I had at the brewery a couple weeks before. Strawberry is present from front to back. Slightly sour style. Smells of strawberries and sugar. Good color - golden yellow with a hint of pink. I don't need gluten free but this is a winner and happy that it is being made to accommodate hot summer days."
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable but a little too sweet for me. Probably one of the better glutton free options I have tried but it is not something that I look for when purchasing beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This would be a good introduction to craft beer for the cocktail set or for the ladies. And this beer is undeniably unique [""Profiles in Courage""]. However unless you seek out fruit beers, I would not recommend this. And please don't judge all of Dogfish Head's brews by this one style."
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably the best sorghum-based fruit beer I've had to date, but that's not saying much. The 6% ABV and complexity of the honey and strawberries on the palate did surprise me a bit, but this brew's a tad too far into a niche outside my wheelhouse. Kinda bummed it's the ""in between seasonal"" brew DFH will come out with 4 times a year. Recommended for a certain sect, but not the masses."
"O- Interesting, I don't think I'll be going back for seconds but glad I tried it."
"O - This was one of my least favorite Dogfish beers...the strawberry flavor was good, but there was a lot of syrupy flavors that came across fake and didn't leave a good taste on my palate"

"Pours a pale golden color with a short lived white head. Smells intensely fruity and sweet. Lots of strawberry and grape, but sort of fake/sugary ones. Not much actual character to it. Maybe some yeast? The flavor is pretty much the same story. Watery but intensely sweet with highly concentrated and sweetened fruit flavors. Lots of grape juice and strawberry. A bit of cardboard on the finish."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Carbonation is on the lighter side as well. The flavors here aren't bad but they die out quickly and the soghum finish kind of turns me off."
""
"Overall – Really not a bad brew. Its fruit flavor is pretty good and hides some of the slightly off sorghum flavors. An interesting brew and actually one I would have on greater occasion."
""
"Overall: Barely a beer. Needs more gluten (just kidding). Pleasant enough, but rather cheap tasting. Fruit from concentrate out of a tin can. I paid $3 for this?"
"Overall: A beer that seemed interesting and I felt like I had to try it, but now I'm somewhat regretting that fact. I mean the beer isn't entirely bad, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone looking to expand their beer horizon."
"I did not enjoy it, I am probably not going to finish it. Weird flavors and smell for a beer."
"Pours a one-finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Almost clear amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Light strawberry nose and flavor is fruity, medicinal and some sorghum. Expensive at $3.20 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
"Overall, if I had a gluten allergy, I'd probably enjoy the fact that this exists. Luckily, it's back to barley for me! The phenolic notes, which may just be what I perceive from sorghum, are overwhelming, and there's not much else redeeming here."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Too sweet for my taste, but it's not as light and sickly as I feared. One bottle of this is drinkable, but I wouldn't pick up another one right away..."
""
"O: doesn't really do much that other fruit beers do. other fruit beers also do it better. really happy I didn't get a four pack of this because I'm happy to tick it but likely won't buy it again."
""
"Medium body and effervescence. Slight warming. Decent but just. Lipstick aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is a Sorghum beer and they all suck. Best Sorghum beer out there, still not good though."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a strange beer. It makes since to put these in a 4 pack and not 6 pack but I would pick up a single just to try."
"I didn’t think that this was bad at all. The strawberries gave this a nice refreshing flavor and this overall had a bit of a dry cider thing going on with it. It’s not super memorable but I have to give Dogfish credit for adding something new to the gluten-free beer market."
""
"O: Honestly one of the best gluten-free beers I've tried, but that being said, certainly not something I'd buy on a regular basis"
""
""
""
""
"M&D - lively, effervescent on the tongue; thin body, candy like sweetness will turn off some, and if you want hops at any level, look elsewhere. Kudos to DFH for branching out and I'm sure GF people will appreciate it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, i've never had a gluten free beer so i don't know what's out there. what i do know is that this beer carries a nice strawberry flavor, but the body is fizzy and seltzer like (and i'm no fan of seltzer). not sure what gluten free beers are like, but compared to non-gluten free, pretty meh. i used to think that a ticker has to tick, but maybe a ticker doesn't really have to tick?"
""
"Not bad. Not bad."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced beer with some good flavor, especially considering it is gluten free. I like the strawberry flavor."
"O: Hmm... I think I'm going to need to give this beer some time. The Sorghum has a different flavor than your traditional malt. It doesn't reach the caramelly or bready depths. It sticks to that unprocessed grain flavor which can be good but you really need just a bit more complexity. All in all not bad but I wouldn't get it again on my own."
"O: Pretty interesting. A strawberry ale with hints of other things, overall pretty good. A nice and easy summer ale."
"O: I don't have much standard for comparison with gluten free beers, but I do not much like this beer. Maybe it's good for people with Crohn's, but that's about it."
"O: Overall an OK beer, although I prefer an ordinary beer brewed with malts over this one."
""
"My first gluten free beer, Pours a pink hued golden with very little white head, Sweet aroma of strawberry, honey, and a touch of grain. Fortunately not a thick aroma because that would have killed it. Flavor starts off sweet strawberry but that dies out leaving a touch of graininess in the finish. A think, not too active moutfeel. Overall, not bad. If I couldn't drink beer I could certainly drink this one on occassion, though the sweetness is not quite to my personal tastes. But really better than I expected."
""
""
""
""
"O: I can't recall having had another sorghum based, gluten free beer, so comparing this to another in-style is tough. On it's own though, and knowing the beer's limitations, it's actually ok. No, I'll not be reaching for this, but those with Celiacs can rest assured that Sam and the Dogfish crew have crafted a rather decent replacement to a stanard craft beer."
""
"This is definitely a one of a kind beer, which was worth a try."
"O-Kinda hard to rate because its very different from any other beer I have had, and I havent had any other gluten free beers. Overall I liked it but its definitely in a class of its own."
"I generally shy away from gluten free beers but I will always buy them for my wife. When I heard DFH was putting one out, I bought it as soon as I saw it. It's oddly flavored. The strawberry tries to add something to nothing but it doesn't balance well. My wife and I agree, I won't be buying this again."
"O- Not liking this one at all. I'll pass on this one for sure."
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a golden color body with a small fizzy head. The smell is strictly strawberry. The taste is sweet of strawberries with a white wine taste. The mouth feel is nice with a very dry finish, almost like drinking strawberry flavored champagne. Defently not one of my favorits, but if i gluten intolerante i would drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a OK beer compared to other beers, but a very good one compared to other sorghum beers I've tried. It felt a little overly sweet and fruity for me, but I'd buy it again if I had to drink sorghum beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the coloring. For a specialty beer, the color was a beautiful solid gold. As far as flavoring, we wish that the strawberries were better integrated, and hit the palate sooner than the finish. What was really overwhelming was all of the wine-like components, with grape flavoring dominating the fruit department. While this is not something we would routinely buy, we can see how it would be a great window into craft beer for all people seeking gluten free beer. A+ and props for the consideration and effort DFH!!"
""
"Overall: Not a very big fan of this beer. I enjoy strawberries, but the rest of the beer isn't very good."

""
"D - An interesting beer... It's nice to see a brewer try to address a whole in the market (gluten free craft beer)... I'm not sure the end result is something I would drink on a regular and that I can recommend to anyone other than someone looking for a gluten free offering..."
"O: it drinks ok but if im going for a fruit beer, its not gonna be this one. not a big fan of the finish or the scent and really didnt find much of the strawberry notes which i had really been hoping would be the brightest note."
""
""
"Pours a typical but appealing clear amber with a thin and not very persistent white head. Strong, fruity aroma has an overtone of strawberry. I love strawberries. Taste is crisp, a little malty, mainly strawberry, almost like what a strawberry cider would taste like. A strawberry cider? Is that possible? It is not too sweet, and has an undertone of - must be buckwheat. Texture is crisp and smooth, a bit thin and only slightly fizzy, but this is still a satisfying drink. One of these days, somebody will brew a really great gluten-free beer."
"Pours a bright and glimmering gold with light bubbling, moderate cap of froth, gone quickly. Scent brings tart strawberry, light honey and a faint faint touch of mint before the entire experience begins to go down hill... Pleasant scent notes end with a strange earth, herbal metallic note. First sip brings über tart strawberry purée before a strong herbal taste comes through, moves into a faint splash of honey and soy and sorghum notes. Earthy with sharp metallic note, wine like taste and acidity. Just odd. Medium bodied, slightly low on bubbles. Overall, the strawberry and honey notes are the most redeeming qualities, but the overall ingredient profile never blends well. I do offer respect for the intent of the beer."
"Drink- It's for some people, not for some people. I happen to be one that its not for."
""
""
""
"I dislike this less overtime. Swirling out the carbonation helps out a lot on that front. All told, this could be a lot worse."
"O - Another good experimentation/concept beer that just doesn't have that wow factor making me want more."
""
"Wow this is definitely a different beer and I'm actually glad I tried it because I like it. For a beer with no malt this is excellent. The body is bulked up by the honey and it also adds some sweetness to balance out the sour and tangy qualities this beer produces. This is definitely not for the typical beer drinkers and definitely for the more open minded beer drinkers."
""
""
"Overall: as with most gluten free beers I have had, it just doesn't hit the mark as a refreshing beer as the dryness is just a bit too much."
""
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, strawberry, cherry, sugar, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Wow, I felt like I was drinking a high ABV wine cooler on this one with all of the fruitiness going on. Granted this was a little bit better than a wine cooler as it was more sweet obviously and didn’t taste like ass. I could definitely see this one being a good choice for that girl that you really like but she won’t put out unless she is drunk. Give her a few of these and she will be putty in your hands. You should at least try one though to say you did."
""
"Drinkability - in the sometimes hit-or-miss world of dfh, there's bound to be a few misses. This one didn't do it for me, but I'll enjoy the last bottle on a nice warm afternoon."
"I love DFH, but man I hope they don't bottle this stuff again. I appreciate them trying sometihng different, that's what they're all about, but damn.."
""
""
"This is a darker golden color with mild carbonation. Smells are filled with sweet strawberries. The taste isn't as pleasant as the smell, still with some strawberry flavor but mixed with some acidic wine-type flavors. This has a lot in common flavor-wise with some of fruit-flavored malt beverages or wine coolers. Pretty different for a beer."
""
"O - A big disappointment. I often find fruit/veg beers to be too heavy on the fruit but this one was the opposite: the strawberry really wasn't there in the palate and this was just sugar/honey water."
""
""
"It is nice that DFH is taking a shot at gluten free. Most gluten free is not very good. I feel like gluten free beer is a message to move on to wine. Tweason is a good time, but there is still a ways to go until it could compete with the 90 Minute. Thank you DFH."
""
""
"D: Not sure I could get through a second bottle considering the acidic quality is the primary focus. Enjoyed the dry and effervescent champagne qualities. In the end though, flavour complexity isn't quite up there with other fruit beers."
""
""
"Tweason’ Ale is not very good beer. I understand that it’s gluten free, and I applaud the efforts to craft such a product. However, it just doesn’t taste very good. One side note – I love the inclusion of nutrition facts on the label. This needs to happen much more frequently. As for the beer – it needs work. A lot actually."
"Pours an coppery orange hue with a small short lived white head. Aroma of berries, strawberries, some honey. Taste is a combination of sweet berries, predominantly strawberry, with a kind of nutty dry weird bitter taste. Palate is light crisp body with mild soda like carbonation. Finish is sweet berries, ending is a rather weird and unpleasant combination of flavors. I did not like this at all, could not finish drinking the whole bottle. Overall I would pass on this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfectly transparent light amber color with a short eggshell white head. Pale malts, molasses, scotch and smoke with hints of strawberries, black currants and honey. The aroma is complex, and like most DFH brews almost smells like a mismatched group of scrap ingredients (which is not necessarily an awful thing.) Initial sip is full of strawberry and over carbonation, almost like a flat 99 cent soda from store24. Flavor rolls into a slightly more complex body with the hints of honey, molasses and dry scotch making their way through. Highly carbonated, light bodied with a dry, pale finish. Quite disappointed with this one; coming from a big DFH fan, in my opinion this might qualify as their worst."
"The body is super light and the carbonation is what it should be. Overall I'm kind of impressed. I went into this one expecting to pour it out but it's solid. I'm sure it will make a lot of people who can't have gluten pretty happy."
""
"I am very impressed and expect this to be a much better beer than RedBridge or Bard's, it almost tastes like a real beer!"
"O: I'm glad that I only bought a bottle of this to try. All I can say is I now truly empathize with those that must stay on a gluten free diet (be it choice or not). For those that can enjoy glutens, your tastebuds will thank you for going elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow... this is different from anything I've ever tried before. If I had been blindfolded and told I was drinking a dry strawberry white wine or a dry vermouth it would make more sense... but as a beer, it really threw me for a loop. For the rest of this glass, I will pretend I'm sipping a strawberry martini... now if only the ABV matched..."
""
""
"O= Glad I didn't waste money on this on-tap at Dogfish Head in Rehoboth a few weeks ago. It probably would have ruined my evening."
""
""
""
""
"Ah, it's immediately clear this is a sorghum beer. The aroma has a pleasant strawberry character—tough to create in a beer. But the flavor has just a hit of the fruit upfront, before the more unpleasant, almost acidic grain sweetness kicks in. My advice if you have a gluten intolerance: Drink this cold. It's easily one of the better gluten-free beers I've had, but no match for a normal wheat and barley brew."
"Overall - this is a departure from beer as we know it but I think it tastes good none-the-less."
""
""
"Big props to Aaron for tracking this one down for us, thanks man!"
"O: Not a big fan of fruit beers, but this one is a little different than the rest and you can tell it has a bit of quality to it."
"Overall I am not impressed. Mouthfeel is watery and the flavors aren't very good. Not a good effort from DFH."
""
""
""
"O-I like the gluten free idea, I like the nutritional facts (wouldn't mind seeing nutritional facts on other beers). However this beer falls flat."
""
"O: Overall it isn't bad, but it isn't great either. It feels a touch watery, and one note. Although that one note is a pretty interesting one."
"If you have Celiac disease, I recommend to skip this offering. I have not tried other gluten free beers. I will continue to jump at the chance to try Dogfish's beers."
"Definitely a unique entry into the gluten-free category, where all to many attempt a beery taste and fall short, this is something different for those with Celiacs."
""
""
"O: I have to give credit to DFH for trying something different in the gluten-free space. I have never understood why so many brewers try to create a sorghum-based pilsner or helles, when other beer styles are much better suited to sorghum and millet."
"O: Overall it tastes like a novice extract homebrew with some fruit in it. On the positive it's gluten free and the alcohol is hidden well."
"Overall: The more gluten-free beers I try, the more deeply I sympathize with the plight of those with Celiac disease."
""
"O: definitely was not a big fan of this brew considering strawberries are like my favorite fruit too. oh well."
""
""
"Light to medium mouthfeel and an almost soda pop style flavor. I'm not crazy about this but give an extra nod to DFH for continuing to push the envelope by trying new and different combinations of flavors."
"Fails in the flavor."
"It's as if a Strawberry Crush soda was watered down just a tad. Not one I'd go back to, but not one to despise either. A decent alternative for those with celiac disease and/or gluten allergies. As for the health-conscious beer drinker, I say eat well and exercise, don't sacrifice your beer choices!"
""
"O: The strawberry flavors are very nice and do not come off artificial. I personally would not buy this again."
"Pours a nice light orange color, not much head on this beer and it dissipated pretty quickly. Other than that, the smell has a slight hint of strawberries and honey. I was expecting those scents to pop a little more but over all its very pleasant. The flavor is strawberry in the front with honey adding the sweetness behind it. It's not a strawberry flavor that comes out and grabs your attention but its not hidden either. Very good balance here. I'm really not a fan of this type of brew but i'm very impressed with this one. Great job from Dogfish Head on this one."
""
"It's a really refreshing beer, but the grains really leave a mark on the tongue at the end, but that's my biggest knock on this one...not a bad thing."
""
"O- I think if you are going to make gluten free, make it interesting. Much better second time around."
""
"Taste-Strawberries and apple cider vinagar. Very tart and sour. Would be refreshing as a hot weather beer."
"O - This doesn't have the best drinkability. It goers down easy and all, but it just doesn't taste that great. There is just sort of an unenjoyable flavor, and I think it is just missing that nice maltiness that really would have boosted this beer in every category. Overall, it is an interesting beer that I'm sure some people will enjoy, but it just isn't for me. I think it is worth trying out though. Cheers."
"Hard to describe but it's kind of like a fruit soda beer or something."
""

""
""
""
"Overall, I don't care for it. Weird chemically fruits with lots of off notes. I've had pops that taste more naturally fruity."
""
"O - A decent fruit beer. A little sweet for my likings, but not bad."
"for once im not super impressed by a DFH brew, and for those of you who say all they do is hop like madmen, here is your proof thats not always the case. this one pours a pinkesh hue of yellow, with an average off white head. smell is fruity and tart, definitely spring like aroma. flavor is the essence of strawberry, without being sweet. i respect that. however, we are missing some gluten here, sorghum just doesnt malt right, and its too visible here. feel is fine, white-wine-like in feel, acidic and dry. im not at all into this one, and i am glad i got a single. nothing redeemable here, just a fruity weird drink. this one might do well for the ladies, but it aint no 90minute for those of us in the know..."
"O - for a fruit beer it's OK. not as sweet as i was expecting, but i suppose it's nice for a change form hop bombs (which i've been on a kick of lately)"
""
"o - Overall a pretty average light beer, but better then Redbridge, probably the most available gluten free beer. Some light strawberry in the nose and even more in the taste. Wouldn't seek it out again but would recommend it to my friend with a gluten alergy."

"I expected better from this beer after the talk of being the best 'gluten free' beer out there. I am not sure I would claim this if I was Dogfishhead."
"O: Not a bad beer by any means – but not a great beer either. It was enjoyable and went down easy. I would never pick this up again – but it was worth a try."
""
"With the rise in requests for gluten-free beers, I'm pleased that Dogfish Head has entered the arena with this clever and characterful version. But like all other sorghum-heavy substitutes, the beer's malt richness is severely lacking and not a great substitute for barley-rich beers."
""
"Mouthfeel is very light. It's in, down and gone before you know it, so some of the flavors took some searching."

"Maybe would pair well with an even more exotic dish. Gotta give them credit for giving the gluten free crowd some different."
"O - for a gluten free beer i was impressed. but i think the bar needs to be regular beer (and i have faith that dogfish and others will get there) so im judging it just like any other beer.."
"Overall: Tweason'ale is another one of those Dogfish ales that while I respect the process behind the beer, the final product just doesn't do it to me. Too tart, too wine-like."
""
""
""
""
""
"Still, it's quite drinkable, reasonably priced, and worth trying."
"Overall: this beer has everything going against it -- a fruit beer made with strawberry, a gluten-free sorghum beer -- however, it manages to do well with its limitations. This is not a great beer, but for a gluten-free strawberry beer, it's pretty damn tasty. Judging it within its limits -- it is a damn fine beer."
""
"Poured into a Black Raven imperial pint glass. Pours a clear golden orange amber. Thin white head that dissipated quickly to a ring around the glass. Aroma of honey, peaches and strawberry. Taste is very dry, dominated by strawberries. Finish very estery and tastes artificial, bitter. An unfortunate light plastic flavor with the strawberry in the finish. Light bodied. This was a rare Dogfish Head miss for me. Glad I'm not gluten intolerant."

"Overall, a very crisp, winy beer. It's the best sorghum beer I've had and compares favorably to DFH Midas Touch. An accomplishment considering no barley--one more reason to respect DFH."
"Pours a deep golden color, with a hint of ruby red. Minimal lacy head that is lost rather quickly. Very interesting aroma, rich in an earthy honey, very natural without a lot of sweetness. Quite a complex flavor. Very sweet right off the bat, filled with honey and strawberry, but that doesn't last long at all. It melds into a sour earthyness that fades away rather quickly. It doesn't last long on the tongue, and leaves you feeling kind of refreshed at the end."

"O/D-Bought only a single. This as a four-pack runs around ten dollars. Not even close to worth it for me. Strange beer. Me no likey."

"the taste is of strawberries with no alcohol smell or taste....the aftertaste sticks with you for a while....i really kind of like this beer....it goes down like water and you can drink it really fast...but very weird"
"I'm not though, so it's just a good fruit beer. It's got nice tart strawberries tempered a bit by the honey. The late taste is this beer's highlight, as it goes down initially there's just a strange sort of sweetness that I'd like to attribute to the sorghum, even though I'm not really sure how it actually tastes. Then the tartness of the strawberries rushes in and keeps things interesting. The mouthfeel is a little bit chalky, but is otherwise well-carbonated and drying. The drinkability is very good, 6% isn't a high ABV by any means, but it hides any hint really that this is alcoholic at all. Overall, a very interesting and good tasting beer. I might go back and pick up a six-pack with the warmer weather we're having in Florida right now. I'm sure I'll get one during the spring and summer releases!"
"O- A decent beer to try. Light and easy to drink, but not much there. Best part was seeing the nutrition facts on the label."
"A good choice for the gluten-free consumer. It does take some getting used to though."
"Had to pickup a brand new DFH beer when I saw it in the store. That being said, fruit-flavored beer is not usually my thing. It pours with a loudly carbonated head, which quickly dissipates, like that of a soda. Smell is pretty good- fruity, slightly boozy. Tastes lightly like strawberries and honey. Not bad. Very light and refreshing."

"This is overall a great beer. If you think fruit in beer is for wussies, Not for you. Personally not my everyday ale but a great taste of DFH for someone who can't have gluten."
""
"O - So it doesnt taste terrible but it's hard to rate this as a beer. It's more like a desert wine. It is a refreshing beverage, its very sweet and easy to drink."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, for a gluten-free beer it isn’t too bad."
"Overall the first Dogfish head beer I ever drained poured. I have only had Lakefronts Gluten free beer and it was at least drinkable but this one is way too dry and tart. Nutrition facts are shocking since this beer is no way worth 170 calories."
"Pours a fairly-clear golden color with a short white head and a touch of lacing. The nose carries some strawberry and a bit of an odd character that I can't quite place. Nonetheless, not terribly enjoyable. The flavor follows down the same path. There's some spice and fruit and nothing really comes together. Light body. Not a big fan."
"O - So, I found this to be a hard brew to rate. It has some positives and some negatives to it. Given the fact that it was designed to be gluten-free, I will cut it some slack here. Obviously, it would be a better beer if it was made out of wheat - there's a reason that sorghum isn't a common ingredient in beer. However, this ale was designed for those who can't have wheat...and for them I can recommend this beer. Additionally, people who like fruity beers will enjoy as well. For me, I don't know if I will revisit this one but I wouldn't mind another."
"Because it was brewed as fruit beer, I will rate it with a 4 overall."
""
""
"I am not a big fan of this style, and this will be my last indulgence in this style of brew. If you like fruit/vegetable brews and dont mind the thin carbonated mouthfeel you will like this one."
""
""
"O- Not a great brew, the strawberry doesn't carry well and the beer itself is half baked."
""
""
"More than half way way through, I think this will be a summer beer. The stank has calmed a bit a though not my favorite taste, it's not bad."
""
"Overall, its the best gluten free, sorghum beer I've had. Tart berries are nice, but missing a sweet balance. Probably a nice summer beer, but a little off for me."
""
"I didn't really enjoy this beer too much. The alcohol presence became too overwhelming to taste anything else, it sort of became ethyl alcohol and soda water."
"D - Not great, even for a gluten free beer. The honey and fruit just come across like apple juice and cheap grape juice. I see what they were trying to do here, and it does at least keep the beer from seeming overly thin, but it isn't very enjoyable in the end. Even if I was gluten intolerant, I wouldn't drink this."
"This beer definitely leans toward cidery, which is not necessarily a bad thing simply because it has no barley or wheat. Its a good substitute for those who have issues with gluten and want to be reminded of beer, but it has some strong cider-like qualities that are somewhat detrimental to the ""ale"" in the title. But that is of course what the brewery was going for here and this is the best (of three) gluten free beers I've tried. It has some really nice flavors as the strawberry takes a lot of the focus away from the lack of body. At least DFH never half-asses anything. I would recommend this to those with gluten allergies for sure. I, however, probably won't buy it again. Definitely worth the try though."
""
"O: I don’t know why I keep trying new beers from DFH. I respect them as a brewery, and I respect Sam for what he does. A lot of people love their beers, and they are great advocates for the craft beer movement. However, I have been disappointed with almost every one of their more ‘unique’ offerings. I’ve passed on most lately since I’m tired of wasting money on a 750ml bottle of grossness. This small (12oz) bottle sucked me in and reminded me why I generally steer clear. Only buy this beer if you cannot handle gluten or love super sweet syrupy drinks."
"O-at first i thought it tasted weird, but then as i had a few more sips, i started to enjoy it, but as i got about halfway through the glass, i really started to hate it. its just an odd beer. i feel like people are gluten intolerant probably want a gluten free beer that reminds them of BEER...not some weird concoction. DFH should've tried mimicking the taste of barley or wheat instead of tart berries."
""
"T: This is my first gluten free beer and I'm actually pretty impressed. Something about it tastes a bit off, but not in a way that totally turns me off. Some tart strawberries and lemons as well as some pink grapefruit flesh. Mouthfeel reminds me more of a cider than a beer, but it's a pretty tasty beer nonetheless."
"O: Certainly the best sorghum-based beer I've had, although I haven't had that many. That can be attributed to the sweetness of the strawberries and honey for the most part. Nice job by Sam and DFH to try to make something that tastes better than pure sorghum in a gluten-free beer"
""
""
"O - Overall this is a damn good sorgum beer. Its jsut hard for me to get into these, the after taste always kills it for me. Still though, this is better than other gluton free beers I've had."
"12 oz bottle from Olive Tree in OB."
"Upon first sip, dry white wine is the first thing that came to mind. A bit of berry and light honey. A bit tart, but finishes very clean. A very bubbly brew that also has a slight syrupy feeling. Not as sweet as the label would lead you to believe, but pretty refreshing. Seems like it would be a nice summer beer to have after doing some yard work."
""
"Overall- This is by far the worst DFH beer I've ever had, but that's kinda like saying ""This one-hundred dollar bill is diirty."" It's a good beer worth trying, but I will not seek it out again."
""
"O- This beer really surprised me, and I am enjoying it more and more. Definitely will pick this up again, I feel that DFH did a good job with this."
""
"Pours an orange ale with the slightest pink twinge to it. Some white foam and spotty lace. Brilliant clarity. Smells like a light beer with strawberries and honey - really simple. A pleasant nose with nice subtly. Taste is interestingly fruity - the strawberries are there, slightly tart and effervescent. There is a certain woody flavor along with the honey, which is slight and just barely perceptible. Thin with hi carb and a wet finish. It's an okay beer, but not something I am likely to seek out again. Interesting concept and reminds me more that I drink the bottle, of the flavor I get in Quaker Instant Strawberries and Cream oatmeal (but WAY more subtle, more like an undertow)."
"Overall much better than I expected - though this is also my first ever gluten-free beer. For what it is I feel it is a success, but I don't foresee myself desiring to purchase more in the near future. Should I ever fall prey to a disease that required I only consume gluten-free food though, well, I suppose that I wouldn't mind sipping on this regularly."
""
"O: This might be my least favorite Dogfish Head beer. It seems like a half-formed idea of a beer."
"Pours a light clear golden color with a small fizzy head. In the aroma, fresh strawberries and a mint like herbal note. The taste is similar, tasty strawberries, gummy sorghum, a touch of herb, spice, bitters, and finishes sweet. Not too beery, but a little alcohol. Comes off a bit winecooler-esque, but a good one. Refreshing flavor. Light bodied, fizzy feel. Overall, this is a great option for those with gluten allergies. Tastes like a more commercial flavored malt beverage, sans malt."
"Actually enjoyed this one quite a bit...maybe a little too strawberry-dominated, but it doesn't come across too artificial or cloying. Gives Festina Pêche a run for its summer money!"
""
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 1/30/12. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like strawberries, honey, and there's also a grainy aroma. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a slight green grape/white wine-like flavor noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, and it has decent carbonation. Overall I think it's a decent enough brew. For a gluten-free beer, it's not bad at all. I'd buy it again, it is refreshing and easy to drink. $8.99 for a 4-pack."

"Overall I like the honey and berry characteristics but I feel like they aren't supported by the malt bill. Very watery on the taste. This is my first sorghum so I don't have anything to hold it up against, but maybe people with gluten allergies just weren't meant to drink beer."
"Nutrition Facts on the label: Holy Shit Sam you've gone main stream...170 calories in a gluten free beer this isn't light beer. Certified Gluten Free, I haven't seen that on the other Celiac friendly beers. This one pours with a very fizzy carbonation forms a white head, while the body is a light pale copper with maybe a kiss of pink showing off the strawbeery juice added. Aroma is tame a hint of fruit, tart fruit but I can't really say strawberry from just the smell...also a bit of generic assorted grains with a touch of honey notes. Flavor wise it's kind of like kissing a strawberry blonde hippie chick that hasn't bathed in a few days there's just something not right about it. A layer of mint or earthiness, a little bit of a dirty layer of beeswax and buckwheat, tart strawberry jame like real jam minus the concentrated sugars. Even bodied carbonation finishes a bit strange and I can't believe it's six percent alcohol by volume, an interesting beer for all of the Celiac patients out there and I think chicks would have loved it if the calorie count was staring them in the face. Overall a nice attempt at a craft version of a gluten free beer that is palatable with a DFH spin."
"O- I wasn't overly impressed with this beer, one of my least favorite DFH beers. It wasn't overly filled with flavor, and the flavor it did have was kind of a watered down strawberry white wine flavor. Not really my style of beer, but I could maybe see how some people might like it."
""
"O: So I guess DFH is going to produce this one several times a year during between seasons (hence the name ""Tweason'ale."" This was good but not great. However, those of you who love ciders as opposed to beer are going to love it!"
""
"O- Nowhere near as good as I hoped and not as bad as I feared. An ok experience but not one to seek out again. Back to the drawing board DFH."
""
"This is interesting, to say the most. Not my style, nor my flavor. I like the effort, and at least it's gluten-free, right? I dunno. I'll just avoid this one from here on out."
"CHEERS"

"O: Great fruit beer, I will be drinking many more of these!"
"Cheers."

"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, dry honey, clove, and a small note of fruit. In the taste, dry honey, sugary, and a small note of fruit, but strawberries stand out. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry strawberry to small honey like aftertaste. A bit dry and the honey seems to be a bit too much."
"O: Overall, I think they accomplished creating a great Gluten-Free beer for people who are left out of a giant array of beers that we who can drink gluten typically enjoy. This still isn't my thing.. but I respect the breweries efforts here. At least I was able to finish the beer unlike a lot of Gluten Free offerings."

"Overall, if this wasn't gluten free I might even enjoy it more, but it's not too bad but I wont be seeking it out anytime soon."
"O- a very subtle, drinkable beer, not like a lot of dogfish beers that focus on being over the top, I could see this being nice on a hot summer day, although it is deffinatley a bit girly for my taste. I am not a silliac, and I kinda wonder how somone who is would enjoy this, seems like it would be a great alternative, especially if you were a girl. Or a guy who likes light, spritzy, strawberryish drinks."
""
"Cheers!"
"Feel is light with a Spritzy feel on the 1st sips, yet this just sort of whimpers away. Feeling this less and less as it warms. Overall, glad I tried this for a go, but won't be seeing it again, just not my bag."
"O: I've certainly had better gluten free beers than this (Mbege and Shakparo from Sprecher come to mind, which I think are vastly underrated), but this has a unique flavour profile which distinguishes it from your everyday hunky dory gluten free beer and all beer for that matter. The flavours are good, the beer is thin, frankly I think some gluten would help it to add some body, but that's not what Dogfish Head set out to do so I will review as such. At $9.99/4-pack, the QPR is not great, but for celiacs I think this is a worthy effort to try, and for the regular beer consumer, it wouldn't hurt to try a single to change up the repertoire."
""
"To fruity for me not a big fan of real fruity beer but if you cant have gluten then mos def try it."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. Not the best but still pretty good. I would drink it again."
"O – I was unsure what to expect but I really liked this and would drink it again. It be interesting to try from the bottle to see if there are any differences."
"M/D - light bodied with some lively carbonation. The flavor is there and is a nice alternative for for a gluten free, actually by far the best choice that i've had so far. For what it is, its a decent beer."
""
"D- Very easy to drink, went down very easy."
""
""
"O: Overall it's a great light flavored beer. It's something to drink when it's really hot out, or when looking for a beer that isn't going to overpower the flavor of something light like a salad or fish. I would buy it again, and I think it's amazing that it's gluten-free...it's going into the memory bank of beers to recommend to people with gluten allergies."
""
"Body was on the light side of medium with fairly high carbonation. Very refreshing beer that I think I would enjoy more on a Summer day than in Winter."
"Poured clear, golden, with a fuzzy white head that receded to a thin layer of bubbles. Sweet aroma, flowery, with obvious hints of strawberry candy...those little candies that have wrappers that look like strawberries. Taste that delivered what was promised, with sweet strawberry candy very obvious, grains, bubblegum, wet grass and wildflowers. Obviously, this is not a beer for everyone, but for what it's worth, I found it to be very nice. Light body, and very easily drinkable."
"Poured a light amber with a slight pink hue and a thin white ring of head that disappears quickly, leaving just a slight stream of bubbles. Aromas is certainly sweet, with a good amount of strawberry, a touch of honey, and an ""off"" grainy character that must be from the sorghum. Taste is spot-on with the nose, very sweet, with lots of strawberry, honey, and an almost apple-cider quality. I don't think I'd immediately guess ""gluten free", but you can definitely tell there's something different about the makeup of this one. Mouthfeel is smooth and nicely drinkable with just a touch of bitterness in the finish. Pretty refreshing, actually. Overall a very unique beer, and a neat experiment, but not really my thing."
"On-tap at the DFH Pub. Apparently it's gluten-free... doesn't make a difference to me but seems to be a selling point to some people. Nice fruity aroma, sort of reminds me of a a flavored wheat ale. Strawberries aren't too strong and is definitely on the lighter side, maybe something more geared towards the female demographic. Finish is a bit tart, it could be hard to have more than one, but easy to drink and tasty, just don't expect anything too crazy."
"Even for a gluten free beer it is pretty far out there ... Strawberries and honey bring a ton of complexity to the palate. Good palate cleanser beer."

"This beer poured out as an interesting orange color with no head by the time it got to my table... No lacing here wither. The smell of the beer has some sweet sugary aromas and some hints of fruit also. The taste of the beer is a little tart and sweet in the beginning, as the flavors settle there is a faint bubblegum flavor in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel has a sharp little bite to it but finishes clean and a bit on the dry side. Overall not too bad, wouldn't need to have it again. Happy to have tried it though."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a cloudy, opaque, peach color with no head. The aroma is overly sweet, with hints of pastry and strawberry characteristics. There is a steady carbonation bubbling, keeping the beer light and crisp while you drink. Highlights of strawberry tartness with a steady citrus and tar backbone, as well. The aftertaste is sweet fruit, both strawberry and citrus again. Very light body and extremely sharp finish, making it a difficult one to drink a lot of. Good blend of flavors, and very refreshing, but overly sweet and crisp for my palate."
"O: Quite enjoyable. It was a hot day and it was very refreshing. Not overbearingly sweet."
