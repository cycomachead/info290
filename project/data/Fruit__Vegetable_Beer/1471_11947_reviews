"Would for sure drink this again!"
"O: The raspberry is not as intense and could use something tart to poke it up a bit."

"This was an okay beer. Probably nothing I would buy again, unless I was really craving a raspberry beer for some reason, and had no access to some Founder's Rubaeus."

"My girlfriend digs the raspberry ales. I figured I'd give it a try. I find fruit beers at their most desirable on a very hot day. Today is not one of those days."

"Not a very good beer. Can smell some raspberry but barely comes through at all as far as taste goes. Horrid aftertaste, gets slightly more bearable as you drink it. Definitely not worth purchasing, maybe worth a try if a buddy's offering it for free."
"booo this beer (if you can call it beer) booo boooo boooooo"

"By itself, this was very raspberry everything... a bit thin on the palate, and a bit cloying and sweet . This might be sacrilege, but I mixed this with a homebrewed stout (very standard and straightforward, bit roasty, generally balanced), and the resulting mix was better than the sum of its parts. About 2 parts stout to 1 part HD Raspberry. This beer does have a place, but IMHO, it is not standing solo. Would buy for this purpose!"

"Light orange body with a good frothy head. Aroma of sweet berries. Slightly bitter taste with a bunch of raspberry flavor. I like it."

"This beer is not too sweet; it has a nice after taste and pairs well with foods more commonly combined with wine. It is also good with heartier foods such as bacon wrapped dates and pretzel puffs with beer cheese sauce. Will buy to serve at summer gatherings at home."

"Overall: For a fruit inspired beer, this is one of the better. However, it can get old and seem redundant after a while--the sweetness becomes slightly overwhelming.. but for every once in a while, it's a great option!"

"Poured from a bottle. Has a clear golden hue with a quickly dissipating white head. The aroma is faintly raspberry, and this is probably the best part of the beer. The flavor has hardly any raspberry, but more of a wheat. Even then, there isn’t much. Carbonation is low to nothing, and the beer leans on the watery side. Unfortunately this just isn’t a very good beer, and I happen to like fruit beers."

"I like this raspberry ale because it has more of a malt base than just white wheat, and while the berry doesn't come through and blow your mind, and it doesn't stand out really in any way, its important to remember that this is good because its different, innovation pays, at least for me. hazy almost amber copper color to this, minimal white head and a pink tint. the nose mixes sweet and tartness of the berry with a sweeter and larger malt profile than usual for a fruit beer, which to me is this beers most redeeming asset. the taste has a surprising amount of front of flavor hops to it, before the fruit flashes in and then the malt finishes it. an odd flavor journey really, filling for the style, and without a ton of real raspberry in the taste. I do like the mix of richer grain and fruit. fuller bodied and rather poorly carbonated, but a cool beer nevertheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent fruit beer, it reminds me of my own homebrew take on a lighter ale with fruit. Raspberry is one to use to get the flavor to come through the beer, also helps to keep the malt/hop profile subdued."

"Raspberry Ale pours a hazy reddish color, with a small lacing head. The Aroma is weak but raspberries are present. The taste has a nice crisp malty backbone, with wheat like flavors mixed in, and raspberry flavors on top. Very drinkable , nice flavors, nothing overpowers. Overall a very nice mellow fruit beer."

"O - Definite step up from Shock Top, but if I want a fruit beer I'll turn to New Galrus. My advice is to only get this if it is very hot outside to quench your thirst at only 5% ABV."
"The main problem with fruit beers is that often the smell and taste of the fruit being employed is simply too strong, drowning out the smell and taste of the malt, hops, and other beer ingredients. Well, here comes a beer that is quite light on the raspberry in both scent and taste. The only problem is that it really doesn't have much else to take its place. Yes, you'll taste some malt and hops, and mostly bread and yeast, and nothing is the least bit offensive. But you won't be blown away by anything. This is a forgettable beer, one that avoids being overpowering but that doesn't have anything to be memorable in the least. No, it's not too sweet or too tart. The mouthfeel is great, as the thickness is right where I wanted it to be and the carbonation is enough to keep it interesting while not distracting from the flavor...but the flavor itself just isn't enough. Instead, consider Thirsty Dog's Raspberry beer if you can find it. Dark Horse's beer just simply doesn't try hard enough. Or, maybe we should celebrate a beer that doesn't surrender to fruit flavors and aims to be a bit more mild. I just don't know, but I do know that I won't go out of my way to find this again."
"O: Not a bad fruit beer, though I feel I'm being a bit generous in my assessment. This reminds me more of an American pale wheat ale or an American blonde ale than a fruit beer. Nothing about it really stands out. I would not turn it down on a hot day, but I doubt I would seek it out again. Though this beer is well worth trying once, there are far better fruit beers on the market."

"Eh, definitely not the worst fruit infused beer out there, but miles from being near the top, too. The raspberry isn't as strong nor as pure as it should be. Overall, a little boring and uneventful, and the flavors that ARE taking place, aren't the best around. Might be good for people who are easing into the world of craft beer, but they'll soon be leaving this one behind them."

"The overcarbonation here really impacts the overall experience of the beer. The bubbles on the palate confuse the taste buds and cover up some of the flavor. It also makes the flavors that do come through seem fleeting. I think it achieves what it set out to do. It is refreshing, it's fruity without being over the top, and it's light bodied and very easy to drink. Unfortunately, I'm unimpressed. This isn't a beer I'd like to have again."
""

"O- Like I said, my staple go-to. Enough flavor that you are actually tasting something, but light and easy enough to just kick back and relax with!"

"This pours a semi-cloudy copper color with a slight beige head. The scent is mostly wheat with some hints raspberries. The taste has more raspberry flavor to it than you would expect from the color and aroma. There is a rush of sweet raspberry flavor that then turns into a strong wheat flavor before finishing kind of dry and chalky. This is a slight step up from Shocktop Raspberry but still has plenty of room for improvement."
"O - refreshing but being a fan of Raspberries, I was a bit disappointed, other than the faint scent, there isn't any real raspberry character to this brew."

"Taste/feel: Unfortunately I didn't get to completely enjoy my beer because my friends were pushing me out the door to the casino, but I got a few sips in where I could think if I liked it or not... and I do. I'm not sure what it is, but this beer just doesn't blow me away like I thought it might. Sure, you get the raspberries, but I couldn't help but feel ""meh"" about it. It's still a very drinkable beer super appropriate for Spring or Summer though, and I'd try another."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger frothy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good bits of foamy lacing cling down the glass. Aromas of tart raspberry, bread, herbal, floral, and light caramel, Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of biscuit, toast, light tart raspberry, herbal, floral, and light earth. Lingering notes of toast, biscuit, raspberry, herbal, floral, and earth on the finish for a bit. Not nearly as much raspberry in the taste as I expected from the aromas. Mostly biscuit and herbal hops. Minimal cloying flavors on the finish and fairly dry. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly syrupy and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming on the finish. Overall, not a bad beer; but it was seriously lacking in the fruit department in the taste. Was very easy to drink."
""
""
"O - Good beer for style, refreshing."
""
"I'm not sure how they brew this, but it drinks like a raspberry wheat beer. It's quite tasty and refreshing."
""
"I rather enjoy the authentic fruit flavors of the beer, but the lack of balance from hops, dryness, or acidity limits its drinkability. For the staunch beer enthusiast, this beer may not cut it, but hey- chicks dig it!"
""
""
"O-Was expecting more, raspberries are yummy and sweet while this beer was leaning artificial and semi-sweet."
"Overall Impression- A decent fruit beer by Dark Horse but expected much more from these guys! It could have been an outdated brew but who knows without the B.O.D. Average when it comes down to it."
"Overall if your seeking a naturally flavored but...put the beer first..fruit beer, this is what you'd want to try. Pretty good, I'd drink another one even though fruit beers aren't really my balliwick."
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is ok.. I wouldn't get it again though."
""
""
""
"O: A good fruit beer. It replaces hops flavor and bitterness with the sharp, tart, and fruity flavors from the raspberries. I would consider this a lambic beer - and one of the better ones. This beer is another beer that will work well when chilled on a hot summer day."
""
""
"Good body. Faintly syrupy at times, with a bit of a dry finish. Good carbo depth though. My standard for ""raspberry"" ales is of course NG’s Raspb. Tart, so I expected a wallop of fruit all over this. That, I did not get. What was there instead was a decent beer with all of it malty goodness, grains, light bitterness, and then a decent zip of fruity tartness on the finish. Huh. This wasn’t what I anticipated, but it held its own nonetheless. I like that the fruit character is more muted than in-your-face. Plus, my wife loved it."

"I can't drink this kind of a fruit beer too fast. It's interesting enough, I guess. A regrettable order at the bar. 3.0"
""
""
"The ale sort of tastes like a light nationally branded beer (ex. Bud, Miller, etc) with a faint raspberry taste. Tasteless really, minus the raspberries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, gives to a fruit pie component with a lingering crusty finish. First whiffs and impressions though are not that impressive, mixing with an appearance that is less than satisfying. No major complaints, but no raves either here..."
""
""
""
"This is a good, easy drinking, warmer weather beer. The low alcohol makes it a great summer session beer."

"o - overall i was looking for a nice raspberry beer. this was raspberry alright...but kind of gross. too thick and chewy. although i was able to get through a small glass of it, i opted to move onto something else and didn't finish it. this one is not for me. there are plenty of tasty raspberry beers out there, so i don't see why you'd go for this one."
""
"2.5 D: Not even close to the worst of the fruit beers, but still not good. I doubt my gender is the target buyer for this."
""
"I like how natural and tangy the raspberry is, but the farm house ale taste doesn't jive well with the fruit. The pervasive fruit separates itself from the more natural beer taste and just doesn't blend. It's still very easy drinking and unique."
""
""
""
"Overall I was looking for more raspberrys but it was a pretty good beer regardless."
""
""
"Overall, I don't expect that I'll pick this one up again, but by no means would I recommend people to pass it by without trying."

"cherries and hints of woody notes. Spices of all kind blended in, rich as all hell, this was more of a cherry ale then a stout, but superb. A Rich, tart and yet sweet cherry notes, peppery and loaded with spice. Such complexity,richness, this was indeed exactly what I was looking for. Smooth, light body with a nice carbonation that was great for an ale, but light"

"Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a smallish white head that shows marginal retention. Smells of raspberries and faint bready malt. Sweet malty aroma with a distinct tartness that I assume is from the berries. Taste is malty sweet with tart raspberries and a hint of Belgian yeasty esters. Medium body and carbonation level with a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. This one was kind of meh. I wouldn't be surprised if this bottle had been sitting for a while before I purchased it."
"O: Honestly not a bad fruit beer. Not fruit soda like a lot of fruit beers. This is more tart and doesn't taste like they just dumped a lot of raspberry syrup into it. Otherwise not bad, just simple and straightforward."
"This is one of my favorite fruit beers. Dark horse uses real michigan raspberries and you can tell in the taste! A very fresh raspberry taste which also tastes like a beer and not just an artificially flavored we made this for you girlfriend kind of thing. Getting this mixed with the black bier is also wonderful."
"O- A good beer for what it is. I am not huge on the style, but this is worth trying, it was enjoyable."
"O: Generally Dark Horse really impresses me, this however is just an average representation of the style from other tastings I've had from this category. I can say I'm glad I've had it. Just not my cup of tea within this style though."
"This is a fruity one would drink again, though only ifI were in the mood."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a frothy white head that stuck around for a bit. This one has a dominant raspberry smell with many sweet characteristics, and some subtle malt presence. The overall smell isn't as strong as expected. The taste is all raspberry from beginning to end. The flavor isn't sweet, it starts out tart with the raspberry up front. Finishes with a kool-aid like taste. This one is a light mouthfeel with high carbonation. Not the best for the style, the raspberry didn't feel like if fit the beer well."
"Overall: A solidly good beer. Nothing outstanding about it, but if you are into the fruit beer, it's absolutely worth a try."
"Pours reddish golden. Huge head that lingers. Nice lacing. Smell: dude wheres the raspberry? Just yeasty here. Slightest fruitiness to it, but come on. Same with the taste. Maybe the slightest bit of spritzerish raspberry to it, but once again, come on! Just yeasty. Mouthfeel is decent. Slightly carbonated and creamy. I opened this before I sent it as an extra, and I'm glad I did for fear of embarassment. Just not very good. Not bad, just not good. Nothing like I would expect a dark horse brew to be. Just no raspberry...at all. Avoid this one."
"Overall, not a very exciting fruit beer. The raspberries taste way too fake. I'd choose a different fruit beer over this one."
"O - I don't really have a strong opinion on this beer either good or bad. Not bad, but nothing memorable either."
"This is a very tasty fruit beer. Not amazing, but very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Random pick to fill my mixed sixer today. Yeah, I'm honest like that. It pours a somewhat hazy straw-amber topped by a healthy finger or two of dusty light-cream foam. The nose comprises stale raspberries, wheat, corn, flowers, and a hint of blueberries. The headliner berries may come off as stale, but the smell isn't yet objectionable -- just not thoroughly fresh. The taste holds notes of medicinal and artificial raspberry, dehydrated strawberry (like the kind you'd find in Special K and other such cereals), toffee, musty wheat, lemon rind, and a touch of weak clove. Okay, it kinda starts off fine, but devolves quickly into tongue pain. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick and kinda grainy feel. Overall, another failure at making a palatable raspberry-infused beer. Why is this so damn hard (asks the homebrewer who has failed all sorts of times before...)?"
"A very good, refreshing beer for a hot summer day when you want something a little different."
"Drank 6 oz's and drain poured the rest. I think more tart raspberry flavors would improve this one. On a positive note the alcohol seemed non existent."
"This beer pours out as a hazy golden colored ale with a fizzy white head. The head doesn't leave much lacing really. The smell is sweet with raspberry aromas billowing from the glass. The taste wasn't as strong with fruit as I was thinking it was going to be from the smell. The taste was on the lighter side that left a dry fruity malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad here. There was a decent carbonation and was rather refreshing. This was good but not my favorite Raspberry ale."
"Overall it was a nice beer, and refreshing to drink. I can't say I'd get it again but it was a good intro to a different style."
"Pretty murky, darker-golden brew, with a fairly small bubbly white head. Nose is sweet malt and some berries, raspberries that is. Pretty similar with the taste, sweet malt front, biscuit, maybe a touch of grass (lawn, not the flower), some raspberry thats pretty well blended. Medium bodied, pretty wet with a bit of sharpness to it. I think in their effort to blend everyhing the beer becomes slightly muted, but overall its certainly not bad."
"O - Its a nice fruit beer, but the fruit just isnt in your face enough to really make this worth while. Its tasty, sure, but kinda the equivalent of a fruit seltzer with some alcohol."
"Pours a murky tan/red with very slight carbonation, little lacing. Smell is distinctly berry, with raspberry notes dominating but slight notes of strawberry and blackberry also present. Some sweet malt notes in the nose, but very faint. Taste is mild raspberry with more pale and caramel malts coming through. Overall the taste is very mild in all respects. Mouthfeel is thin and carbonation light. I could see this being a real crowd please with people who light easy drinking fruit beers, and while I did enjoy it, I do not see myself buying one again."
"Pours out a dark orange body with a nice white head that has decent retention and moderate lacing. The carbonation is good on this one. the nose is very strong in raspberries with some wheat and other grains in the back. The taste has a tartiness from raspberries and a wheat taste in the back that gives it a very nice balance. Has a nice creamy mouthfeel, but than leaves the mouth dry and makes you wanna drink more liquids to take away the dryness. This is a good fruit/vegetable beer to go for when in the mood for one."
"This is exceptionally easy to drink-- with a body that reminds mr of an adjunct lager... Very carbonated."
"Overall I could see why I didn't grab another, and basically it was good marketing to have a cool looking label to get me to buy it (WTF bee's?) One of the more forgettable offerings from Dark Horse. Grab yourself a stout player!"
"O – Light flavor hurts this brew, but would it would be as easy to drink as a flavored sparking water on a scorcher of a day."
"A nice, refreshing summer beer. Enjoyable."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a thick two finger soapy head which gives way to minimal lace if any. The aroma is of sweetness and raspberry tartness along with wheat. The aroma is faint. The taste is of wheat with hints of sweetness and raspberry tartness, refreshing, but slightly artificial. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated and stingy. Overall the beer is okay, the flaws could be hidden in the first beer. It is a very easy drink, but the taste is just average."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale amber color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of raspberries with a faint hint of malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but milder. The aftertaste is of strong nasty artificial sweeteners. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, I will pass on this beer next time."
"Pours a hazy pink-ish to orange color with a white head. In the aroma, small fruit and a hint of a gingerbread like malt. In the taste, small dry berry and a dry malt. Kind of bland though. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry candy sugar and hint of fruit in the aftertaste. Not much fruit and kind of bland."
"Each sip starts out with a bite of crispness that remains through the swallow. This beer's got a light body and is moderately carbonated. It's very dry as well."
"D: I got this as an extra in a trade, so no harm done to my wallet. The flavor is awful and I would never drink this again. I'm afraid this is one of those I poured down the drain."
"drinkability: A refreshing beer after mowing the lawn. Not enough flavor for my taste."
"Overall: A bit weak on the senses, but this really is a refreshing beer to drink. I would try this again."
"Cloudy gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head,looks like apple juice.Aroma is raspberries.Taste is tart raspberries and malt.Definetly not the easiest drinking beer around.Overall kind of bland and boring but by no means terrible.It was nice to try once but I doubt I would ever buy one again."
"D/O- I must say drinkability is low given the extreme raspberry taste of this one...mayyybe would have two in one sitting, but probably not. Would have guessed that going into it. Having said that, I kind of enjoyed this one. Thanks Dark Horse for a fruit beer that doesn't totally suck, seems few and far between anymore."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Coloring was a meidum maber with a tinge of red. A bubbly white head with constant streams of carbonation. No cling at all from the head. aroma was predominantly fresh raspberry, with a touch of wheat. Reminded me definitely of picking fresh berries. Flavor was a bit offputting. Had watery raspberry undertones, didn't dominate, but the main flavor was just not there. Felt very good in the mouth, coated well and nicely carbonated. Easy to drink, but the bland flavor was in sharp contrast to the great aroma and made it not something to want to drink."
"Pairs nicely with Chicken a l'Orange."
"Pours a really strange orangish brown color with a bit of haze and not much of a head or lacing. Nose is a bit strange as well with some raspberries that are a bit tart and sweet. Mild malt backing. Taste is again an odd raspberry combination. Decent feel between the raspbery components. Interesting but not terribly good."
"It pours a murky reddish orange, kind of like apple cider with a slight reddish tint and had a light off white head. The smell was soft and appealing. It features modest raspberry aromas with some light sugary sweetness. The taste is what I would call mellow. The raspberry is not overly sweet or tart but somewhere in the middle. The mouthfeel is soft and not what I'd like it to be. It was a little too smooth. I would've preferred more carbonation and greater crispness. I found this Raspberry ale to be pretty tasty and I enjoyed it. I'd say that this one is pretty drinkable, but I love most raspberry beers."
"(D)- Decent, but when it comes to fruit beers, this one falls short. Still enjoyed it though."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is decent, it shows some nice raspberry flavors to it. It was pretty easy drinking and I can see a lot of casual drinkers liking this beer. It wasn't one of the best fruit beers I've had but it was definitely above average just based on not having a huge extract flavor to it. I probably wouldn't buy it for myself again but my girlfriend would definitely buy it for herself."
"Pours a nice cloudy amber color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a nice touch of Raspberries, slight spice note. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, nice raspberry note, and some kind of spices. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice thirst quencher."
"A: Medium gold in color with a trace of red, there is a decent head and retention seems good, significant lacing as the beer drops - 4.25, S: The initial pour is heavy on the raspberry aromas, actually it is not just heavy but rather it is pure raspberries, there is also some acidity and tartness, fruity sweetness - 4.50, T: Like the nose the palate has a considerable amount of raspberry, I also perceive a decent kick of hops which provide a citrus and earthy punch, individually I enjoy the two tastes but them seem to clash somewhat in the beer, quite dry and slightly astringent - 3.00, M: Mouth feel is pretty moderate - 3.00, D: All around a very drinkable beer, it didn't really tickle my fancy but I am glad to have sampled it - 3.50"
"Overall Dark Horse makes good beer and this is no exception, this would be a great beer to enjoy while playing some disc golf in the summer heat. I would for sure pick this beer up again."
"DB- A decent beer, nothing really jumps out at you from this one. The good aroma led me to think this would taste like fresh alcoholic raspberries. Unfortunately the fruit flavor was a bit of a let down. Refreshing, average beer for a decent price."
"Pretty decent drinkability, but nothing I would go out of my way for. By far, my least favorite offering from the good people at Dark Horse."
"F: Well, at least its a clean on the finish, light and thirst quenching on a hot day. But slightly watery and lingering little raspberry and malt extract syrup."
"D - Easy drinking refreshing beer. If you want a beer that tastes like Raspberries then this would hit the spot. I wouldn't mind having this again but it isn't a must have by any means."
"Comes out of the tap a barely translucent dark honey-golden brown. Aroma is malty with a strong overtone of raspberry - which I love. Flavor is malty and a bit hoppy, again with a firm raspberry overtone, just a teensy bit on the thin side. Texture is smooth, fairly fizzy and just a bit watery. Definitely worth a try."
"Strong raspberry sourness--very tart, particularly in the swallow which leaves a lasting aftertaste. Rich body with a generous level of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel was light to medium and refreshing. I liked the level of carb. Eh, overall this was just decent at best. And I don't think the crossover potential exists since the raspberry is so subdued."
"I also sampled their blueberry stout and was suprised how messy the flavors were. Dark horse's fruit beers leave much to be desired."
"Drinkability:An ok fruit beer where the raspberries are tart but not overpowering. Not as good as other Dark Horse beers. I would pass on this."
"Pours a murky gold and blush pink/purple with minimal off white head. Smell is of sweet and tar raspberrys, freshly dried grains. Taste is of mild pale malt, wheat and just a touch of sweet raspberry - lacks tartness and agressiveness, ends up feeling muddled and dirty. Light to medium bodied, over carbonated. A rapberry beer without any punch."
"Drinkability: Simple, but tasty and refreshing. For a fruit beer (which I often abhor), it is quite impressive."
"drinks ok at best. has the mouthfeel and flavor of a watered-down fruit juice with just enough beer characteristics to be a put-off for non-beer drinkers. though I am not a fruit beer lover, and there are worse in the style as well."
"D - Not bad overall for drinkability. Reminds me a bit of Rubaeus but not done quite as well. Enjoyable,but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to get this one again. Too many other great raspberry beers around to stay on this one."
"D - The higher carbonation with fruit flavor is quite refreshing. On a hot summer day I could see having two...or three."
"D: Unlike a lot of other fruit beers, this one isn't so sweet to the point where you don't want another. Very clean and refresing. Great grass cutting, summer beer."
"D- This is a very refreshing beer that would be perfect during the summertime. I think Dark Horse pretty much hit the nail on the head with this beer. Good job guys. Perfect beer for people who like fruity beers."
"O: The fact that this still tastes like a beer rather than Smirnoff Ice puts it in a category of fruit beers those of us that don't really care for fruit beers. This beer pleases me."
"Overall, a good beer. This is an interesting combination, and is not overdone. I could definitely have a few pints in a sitting. A bit expensive for what you get, though."
"A fruit beer that just misses. The raspberry is very subtle in taste and not there at all in smelll. The mouthfeel is thick and grimy. The aftertaste just flatout reminds me of medicine. I wanted this beer to be a good one because I love raspberries, but I was not excited about this one. Dark Horse makes other beers that are much better than this, and wouldn't recommend this to someone who wants a ""fruity"" beer"
"Reddish copper in color. About a two-finger dense head that retreats kind of quickly leaving nothing stuck to the side of the glass. Smells sweet and tart like, well, raspberries. Yeasty as well. Not much of anything else but I like to smell. I tastes like a decent malty and hopped ale that's being overtaken by raspberries. Bready, tart, a little bit of hop bitterness on the finish. A little creamy in the texture and the right carbonation level. I'm almost at the end of this one and I don't have a really strong desire to open another. Therefore I place the drinkablity a bit lower that the other categories. I'm having a pilsner next..."
"My advise: while this is not a bad beer, there are much better options to look into than this one."
"Don't drink and review."
"My pour resulted in a finger of ecru head with decent retention. Nose was filled with sweet red raspberry! I have recounted many times in my reviews of my late paternal grandmother's raspberry bush in her backyard garden and let this be no exception. Color was a slightly hazy reddish amber. Mouthfeel was medium with an unexpected raspberry tartness, as opposed to the perfumy taste that accompany many raspberry beers. I should be drinking this on a hot summer's day, rather than a chill Thanksgiving morning. C'est la vie! Finish was very dry. Zephyr winds could be heard blowing across the Sahara. I think that I may sweeten this up with a shot of that Labatt's Porter from earlier."
"So their thought of ""beer first, fruit second"" is right on target. Don't be turned off if fruit beers are not your thing, you'll be surprised of how well this ale drinks compared to the fake, cloying sweet essence-ladened fruit beers out there."
"Notes: Probably my favorite fruit based beer."
"D- all day."
"Too light on the palate, feels watered down. The tart bite is minimal; a very disappointing brew, infinitely inferior to NG raspberry tart."
"The taste is a let down, its too sweet and thats all it is. Not a complex, or interesting beer at all."
"A pretty decent raspberry ale from Dark Horse."
"This beer is definitely sweet fruit first, beer second. I don't mind that in my fruit beers, but would like the sugar toned down a little. Not worth it at $10 a sixpack, pretty average."
"Dark amber pour with a finger of head that leaves a bit of lacing as it settles. Smell is biscuit malts and grains and a fake smelling raspberry. Unfortunately the taste is quite fake as well. Somewhat watery and an almost metallic fake taste to it. Medium to light body, don't bother seeking this one out or even purchasing it if you see it. Very average brew from such a great brewery."
"D: Has what I look for in a fruity beer. Well rounded, not overpowering and almost dessert like. I'd have this with food."
"A decent offering from Dark Horse. Nothing special, but something that even a non craft beer drinker could approach and not get scared off."
"Hazed, yet clear honey amber color with a small white head with little retention or lacing. Sweet aroma of raspberry, honey, yeast and some mild hoppy bitterness. Flavor is that of a typical biscuit-y malt-y amber with fresh raspberry added to it, slightly sweet, no tart or sour presence. Syrupy medium body with fairly high carbonation, finish is slightly sweet with lingering fruitiness but slightly watery. Not bad, but merely average compared to other Dark Horse beers or other fruit beers."
"D - pretty decent fruit beer. It is better than most I have tried, albeit having more than a couple would be a struggle. It was definitely not worth the price tag though."
"D: Ok, if you're into fruit beers, but even for a fruit beer, it's not great."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber color with about a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both low. It smells like sweet and tart raspberries (more sweet than tart) and wheat/grain. Not a bad aroma at all. The taste is similar, but slightly weaker than the aroma, it tastes just like raspberries and grain. Mouthfeel/body is light, with good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. Overall I think it's a decent enough beer, but it's not something I'd buy all the time."
"Drinkability is decent not interesting enough to grab a whole six but definitely worth a try on occasion. Betterr than 99% of the other fruity candy beers that are marketed these days."
"Notes: great brewery but not the best interpretation of the style. just a little too dry and lacking in flavor"
"Drinkability: Its a summer beer that goes down easy. Lets face it, its a chick beer. Would ladies drink it? I dont know. I think it is a bit bitter for there taste. But from a guys standpoint, this is easy drinking on sunny afternoon."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. The ale appears a hazed amber color with about two fingers of off white foam. Nose and flavor are of mixed berries, red raspberries, wheat, slightly bitter throughout with notes of sweet malt sneaking in once in a while. Light bodied and adequately carbonated. Quaff able enough I suppose."
"If Sam Adams came out with a beer called Rasberry Wheat, this is what it would taste like. Lots of wheat and artificial fruit flavoring is what this brew is about. Its not offensive or anything, just pretty plain and uneventful."
"D- I see no reason not to have another, but this is probably a better first beer of the night than anything else."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with strong carbonation."
"Pours a cloudy orange colored body, with a whitish head, somewhat lasting. Has a raspberry malty aroma. A light wheat raspberry taste. Has a tart diet sugar taste. Light but pretty tasty."
"I was pleasantly surprised after the pour and first whiffs, but it didn't taste quite as good as the first impressions. Not bad for a fruit beer."
"This is as girlie and femanine as it gets. Too think, I sent this as an extra in a trade...wish I had tasted it prior to sending."
"This was a pretty boring beer. Appearance is relatively bland, straw yellow color with maybe a hint of red. No head or lacing. Smell is kinda fruity, and some sweeter yeast ester noted. Could not pick up any malt or hops. Same goes for the taste, but too much raspberry for me. Tastes kind of fake. Mouthfeel is on par for the style. Drinks like a wine cooler."
"This one was pretty lame for sure. Easily the worst I've had from Dark Horse. All this did was make me want a Rubaeus for a real raspberry ale. Go with that one."
"Pours a cloudy, light brown color. 1/5 inch head with poor retention and no lacing. Smells sharply of raspberry. Fits the style. Smooth, crisp, tartness is apparent. Low carbonation. Tastes of a raspberry with an mouthfeel leaving a tartness and dryness on the tongue. Gets sweeter and less tart the more you drink. A slight malt can be tasted in the background. Overall, sweet enough, not too carbonated, and not too tart to be a turn-off. One of the better raspberry flavored brews I've had."
"First tried a little sample that reminded me of Founder Roubious. On that note I had to try a pint. What a mistake. A little sample of this beer is nice a pint is just too much. A light yellow sparkly pour. The raspberry flavor is nice but that is all this beer has. Nothing is behind the sweet fruit flavor so after a while it felt as if I was drinking some sort of raspberry cream soda. I could give this to my children as a nice treat."
" Pours an amber/copper color,with a thin white head. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful fruit aroma,that matched the initial taste of raspberries and faint hops,later on I got some of the malt flavor to boot. Nothing really stood out in this Ale but I find it to be well rounded and not too tart like some fruit beers tend to be. Nive crisp finish,dry. I buy this once a month or so just for a change."
"Straight up raspberry beers aren't quite my thing but this one was decent. Not exactly earth shattering or anything but it drank well and was fairly pleasant."
"I went after this one because of the other beers Dark Horse has put out, but this one just doesn't make the grade."
"Drinkability - not a total loss but not one I'd take a chance on again."
"This fella poured a darkly and thickly into teh glass and was just raspberries all over from start to finish. The berries were definitely apparent from the smell alone and then upon drinking, it finished with a crisp raspberry bite. I'm not much into the fruity ales, but I would recommend this one to those who are. All in all was well done."
"Pours a very light golden color. Not a whole lot of head on the pour. Smell is raspberry of course with some underlying malt as well. There's a good amount of raspberry in the flavor, but it's not overdone. I love Dark Horse Brewing, but this is rather uneventful and thin. I'll stick with their dark beers and IPA's."
"Poured from bottle on recent Michigan beer trip! Pours a hazy orange with nice white head, minimal lacing and mediocre retention. Smell is of some raspberry, some wheat and a bit of biscuity malt. Taste is good, however I found it to be somewhat bland. There was a nice raspberry element to it and a nice malt backbone but other than that it was somewhat lacking. I think something just needed to stand out more, but it didnt. Mouthfeel was great. Very light and somewhat crisp, slightly oily after-feel. Overall a good beer, I am a fan of the fruit beers so I did enjoy this, just wasnt amazing."
"Overall: not bad at all--a well-realized and restrained fruit beer that might appeal to folks who think strong fruit beers are overwhelming or running amok. It also shows that Dark Horse doesn't have to hit 10% and the flavor of diesel with all of its offerings..."
"Drinkability: I like the fact that the raspberry flavor stays true to the fruit and that the beer is a neutral palate against which the raspberries get to strut their stuff; however, I also wish that there were a bit more bulk and complexity here; its essentially a chick beer that guys can tolerate"
"D - This is a really nice change from all of the crap fruit beers out there. This is how it should be done! Good beer first and foremost, with accents of tasty fruit. I'm impressed."
"D: Drinkability is good for something so...meh. A rare ""just ok"" beer from Dark Horse."
"overall, this wasnt what i was expecting but it was fairly mild it was ok but not anything that ill seek out"
"D - Easy drinking with great fruit flavor. A perfect summer beer choice. Not very complex, but not overly fruity or cloying like most fruit beers."
"Nothing bad about this one, just nothing outstanding in any aspect. The fruit is not abundant or fresh, and the base beer is average."
"Bottoms Up..."
"mouthfeel is creamy from carbonation, glass was well chosen as it really makes this beer pop, smooth, dry crispness, an easy drinking flavorful raspberry ale."
"D- A decent fruit beer. Not a lot drawing me to it though."
"Decent fruit session beer, but I wish it had a touch more raspberry flavor."
"Into a pint glass, pours a hazy amber color with little to no head, no lacing. The aroma is filled with raspberry, grains and wheat. There is some melon in the taste along with raspberry, nicely tart, more grains, stock amber feel to it otherwise. The mouth is full enough, decent carbonation, pretty easy to drink for the odd duck it is."
"Pours a hazy burnt amber color with some floaties. 3/4 of an inch of creamy white head has average retention and leaves some good lacing. Smells faintly of tart raspberries, lemon, straw, and honey. Tastes of honey sweetness followed by some biscuit wheat, then the raspberry presence comes in with a light lemon finish. Medium light in body with good fizzy carbonation, smooth and crisp but a little thin, a nice sweetness combined with some tart and sour notes for a good balance. Not one of my favorites from Dark Horse, but it is easy to drink and refreshing, definitely good to enjoy on one of those hot summer days."
"Tasted on tap at Firkin in Libertyville on 3/29/08. They had just run out of KBS 2 hours prior!"
"D-This one held up well in my cellar. A totally refreshing and drinkable brew. Nice."
"The bottom line: not as bad as some would make it out to be, but Dark Horse's raspberry ale falters mainly for being so mediocre. Good marks on the nose and mouth, and the flavour has potential if they can just work that slight off-taste out of it."
"The mouthfeel suffers more because Raspberry Ale is flat halfway through--a cardinal sin, but not a total surprise with the amazing disappearing head that started it off. This also detracts from the drinkability, making what could have been a fairly good beer merely OK. I'd recommend Great Divide's Wild Raspberry over Dark Horse's version. Ultimately I'm not a big fan of fruit beer, and this is I believe the first time Dark Horse has disappointed me. I'd like to think it was the style more than the brewer. But for beer lovers, stick to the other terrific wares that Dark Horse does, which are splendid. This, sadly, is not."
"If anyone can do a good fruit beer, Dark Horse can. I wouldn't have picked this up if it weren't for the review in BA magazine... cheers!"
"Thanks! Light to medium amber in a kolsch glass with a topping of white lasting head. Smell is a nice shot of raspberry and malt. Sweet, but not overly so in the smell. Taste is rather dull with about equal malt and raspberry flavors. Somewhat light bodied with low carbonation. Overall tastes thin and watery with a little raspberry flavor, but not as much in the nose, nor as fresh and full as I'd like. Easy to drink, still."
"Drinkability/notes: Quite pleasant and drinkable, well-suited to warm weather drinking."
"Tastes much firmer, which is a relief. The yeast is strong for a weak beer, very crisp and not at all lambic funky (a good thing since there's few things worse than identity-less fruit beers that try to be lambics). The malt is there but it's as blank as a white sheet, the raspberry is tame but certainly present and not at all alcopoppy, and there's a very nice beery aftertaste."
"Thanks to Pegasus for sharing the bottle."
"Not much more to say about this one. Refreshing. Quaffable."
"Hazy and murky looking. Deep orange/copper body. Thin dirty white head. Lace is minimal. Smells kind of like canned raspberry puree. Quite sweet. Also a little cream soda aroma. Carbonation is quite lively. Very prickly on the tongue. Medium bodied. Soft raspberry quality on the palate. Backed up by a modest biscuity maltiness. Decent beer here. Probably my least favorite beer, of the 10 or so I've tried, from a brewery that I've really come to like over the past year with my sporadic samplings."
"I wouldn't really recommend this beer."
"I would definitely recommend this drink to everybody, even the doubters of a good fruit beer."
"I must say that I was taken aback by this beer. I threw it into a mixed six pack because I hadn't seen it in the store before. I didn't expect much because I generally don't like fruit beers. I must say that this one has changed my stance. This is top shelf stuff. It is tasty, crisp, clean, and refreshing. I will definitely seek this one out next summer. The fruit isn't overpowering like some other beers."
"D- This beer has big raspberries in the nose but they were much softer in the taste. There were lots of other fruit flavors that were not so interesting."
"Pours a slightly reddish-amber color with a nice ring of white head that settles quickly, leaving no lacing. A little opaque, but mostly clear. Nose is mild raspberries, a little bit of hop presence too. Taste is better: it's not an overwhelming raspberry punch like a lot of fruit beers, but better balanced with the malt and hops. Obviously raspberries dominate the flavor, but there's also some breadiness, some light hops (especially as the beer warms), and a touch of caramel malt too. I'd been looking to try this one for a while but didn't really want to buy a whole sixer of it. I'm quite happy to have tried it on-tap; a tasty beer, definitely good for a change from more common beers and beer styles."
"Pours a cloudy amber, thin white head forms, settles down very fast to a thin ring, no lacing. Smell is bready, fruity, light raspberry, vegetables, bit of caramel. Taste is similar, bread, yeast, vegetables, light raspberry and other fruits in the finish, think this is a bit past its prime as the raspberry has faded out a bit. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Could see this being pretty messy fresh, although still pretty drinkable as it is."
"Overall, this is the most awkward tasting raspberry beer I've ever had. The finish is striking and unpleasant. The tart raspberry taste is nice, but very subdued. It's like a light pale ale with raspberries. Interesting, intriguing, and innovative, but not inspiring."
"D: Good beer for a hot afternoon. Although its deceivingly sweet after a while and probably couldnt do many of them."
"The look of this one is attractive--hazy, honey orange in color, with some active carbonation and funky suspension going on. The head, though, is more like soda than beer--noisy, fizzy, and completely gone almost immediately. The nose is cleanly grainy with some fruit that invokes citrus as much as raspberry. Yow...no doubt about the raspberry in the taste, though. It's actually an uncommonly fresh taste for a fruit beer, though it's still stronger than I hope for vis-a-vis the underlying grains. The finish isn't so good, with the less appealing remnants of both the fruit and the malts both lingering. There's enough crispness in this one to cancel out what might be a sweet, clingy mouthfeel. I'm a fan of raspberry, and this is one of the better fruit beers I've had. Even so, one is plenty."
"A good thing to do at a place where you have the luxury of force carbonating is to mix in some white sugar after secondary to increase the sweetness after the yeast sucks out all the residuals from the fruit addition...yeast would have to be crashed completely, of course. That's the only thing, IMO, that would/could make this better. Other than that, it's still refreshing."
"This brew pours a yellow-gold color with a thin off-white head and spotty lacing. The aroma is like raspberry sherbet. Light-bodied and crisp with tart artificial raspbetry flavor and an underlying bitterness. The finish is fruity with a bit of malt, and the raspberry aftertaste does not last. This beer is passable and unmemorable."
"Marmalade copper haze (yeast? wheat?) with uppity effervescence and a thick, cottony, gauze-white head. Biscuit, wheat, and fruit malts on the nose, with a spritzy, subtle raspberry splash. More tart than sweet. Tangy, slightly acidic raspberry/citrus notes up front. Toasted wheat malt fills out the middle. Soapy, soft feel. Raspberry and strawberry fruitiness throughout. Mildly sweet; more tart than sweet overall. Tangy, yeasty finish. Not bad. Nice and refreshing on a hot summer day no doubt!"
"As far as I'm concerned, Dark Horse needs to retool Raspberry Ale. Who knows, maybe they sell boatloads of it to those who are frightened off by anything that isn't light and fruity and easy to drink. It's all of those things, but I require more than that. I suspect that most BAs do too."
"Pours a very cloudy red-orange with a small head. Aroma is huge raspberries. I was rather surprised at how big the raspberry smell was. Taste follows the aroma with big raspberry with some malts behind it. Mouthfeel was a little on the syrupy side for me. This was too sweet for my preference, although my wife said it's biggest fault was being too easy to drink, so there you go. Not my first choice of beer, but it seems to be good for what it is."
"a very light lager with a hint of pink/purple to it. smell is grainy, with fresh raspberry. the raspberry flavor is surprisingly and pleasantly natural, like a simple splash of fresh raspberry juice. how many brewers would have added syrup or sugar to produce a kool-aid flavor? not dark horse! it's actually a bit understated, resulting in a somewhat watery body. a bit more hops and/or maltiness wouldn't hurt, but that's a minor complaint. refreshing, and easily downable."
"Originally reviewed on 12/29/2006. 12 Oz Bottle. Aroma of rotting socks and old fermented fruit parts. Pours a mucky ruddy-tinged brown. No head. Flavor is a skunky, rotting fruit flavor, with that dreadful off-spritz and a blast of souring malt. No hop presence. No decent fruit character and next to no carbonation. Nothing carries this beer. The flavor is unpleasant. Palate is weak and a tinge cloying. Overall, a real bummer."
"Always seem to be partial to any kind of beer that has fruit in it. The color was a hazey, pale sunshine with some light sediment at the bottom and a very light, thin head at the topThe aroma is a lightly sweet ands hinting at a tart flavor raspberry. The taste is a little hint of tart, and good, natural flavor. Little bit of sweet, pale malt mixes with the natural goodness of the raspberry. Very easy to drink. No overwhelming fruity flavors. Just good for cooling down when you are in the Summer sun."
"Mouthfeel is a bit lighter, with lots of carbonation that rushes across the tongue on the way down. An easy drinkin brew that I could see being good beachside on a hot summer day. Overall though, this one just falls a bit flat for me...nothing to write home about in my book and I don't desire another."
"single bottle from Star in Madison, brought back in a suitcase"
"D - A solid fruit beer. This one would go well on a hot summer day."
"Seriously. There is no rasberry in the flavor either, just rotting hay and vegetables. Not one that I want to revisit anytime soon, but if I encounter a bottle that I am 100% sure of its freshness I might pick one up."
"I'm not a big fan of most fruit beers but if I was, oh man, this would be the one."
"Pours out to a moderately hazed orange color with low carbonation and a small head of white foam that dissipates quickly. Aroma of raspberries is noted, but not much else. Taste is mild, with little evidence of it's contents; light fruity flavors over bland malts and a touch of grain. Mouthfeel was uneventful. Little carbonation on the palate. Drinkability is average. More along the lines of a flavored wheat beer, but it's drinkable. Special thanks to Piecesofflair for the sample."
"The taste is a little tarter than I expected, and actually came as a bit of a welcome suprise. It's decently balanced out and not overwhelmingly fruity. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice, light level of carbonation. Drinkability if pretty good, but one will do me."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Drinkability/Overall: it's no Raspberry Tart, but it's not really meant to be. A fairly standard, yet fairly drinkable fruit ale. Though my girlfriend whinced when she tried it."
"All in all, if you are a Dark Horse fan, try it, but a quality fruit beer this isnt, but I think New Glarus Raspberry tary spoils me. Methinks I shall try another one and pair it with a cham torte dessert."
"Poured a murky brownish orange into a pink glass. Floaty yeast was apparent, didn't realize there was this much yeast in it. Nose was of some floraly hops and very faint rasperry. Taste was of light malt, lighter raspberry and a little hoppy bite. Not too impressed, was rather easy to drink, but didn't care too much for it. I'll see what's next."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially on a hot summer's day."
"This beer poured a murky orange yellow color and formed a pure white head that disappeared quickly. The aroma was of hops, and a small amount of raspberry. The flavor was of hops, raspberry in the beginning that faded near the end. The finish was light and a bit spirte, not really reflecting much of the raspberry."
"The sour mouthfeel leaves for a undesirable texture making this not the most drinkable beer I've tried. I'd pass this one if searching for a good raspberry ale."
"Drinkability: I have only recently started buying and enjoying more fruit beers and this is one I can recomend and will enjoy myself again and again as long as there ice cold."
"Taste; tart raspberries are there, but they're mild and not overwhelming, a bit of oranges, and just a touch of hops in the finish. It's a fairly light and refreshing beer that I think would have been much better during the summer."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale with a slight reddish tint to it. It has a small white head that fizzles down to a ring around the edge of the glass with no lacing. The smell is good, mostly raspberry and a touch of what smells like someone getting a perm. It's strangely nice. The taste is raspberry mixed with the hops of a good pale. Very nice. The mouthfeel is nice, medium body with medium carbonation. It's a very drinkable beer. I recommend it."
"Drinkability is not that grand as this is a fruit beer after all. I cannot see a reason for drinking more than one. Maybe if I was a girl. I can always hope I guess."
"Slàinte!"
"Bottle provided by Eyedrinkale ala BIF20. Thanks much for the opportunity! Pours an enormous three finger fluffy head. Too much carbonation from only half of the beer poured so far. Cloudy and tangerine in color...this beer looks like a wit. Smells raspberry with some sweet and also a waxy that makes me think of a raspberry scented candle. Tastes only mildly raspberry and a little bit yeasty. It's wet sweet and lacks the sour/tart that often is found in raspberry beers. Aftertaste has apricot, mixed berries, and orange melon. Medium-light body and mildy carbonated (must have all been released during the pour). A sweet and fruity drink that's light and refreshing."
"Had this at the Brass restaurant in Mount Pleasant on tapas night $1.00 off so I gave it a shot,pours a hazy blond with the red raspberry tint.Aromas of fresh raspberry puree and wheaty malt,flavors are not as tart as expected more sweetwith a firm dry malt backbone.Not really a fan of the style but gave it a try not all bad for the style but I wont have it again."
"Pours a hazy orange color, topped with a cream colored, rather thin head. Aroma is reminiscent of an American wheat beer. Flavor also has nice wheat crispness, with just a hint of bitterness. Also a hint of coriander flavors in the aftertaste. The raspberry is very subtle, and offers just a hint of fruit flavor. However, the flavor becomes just a bit artificial as you continue to enjoy the beer. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, and this is a fairly refreshing beer. I'm not big into fruit beers, and I must have picked this one up in a state of Michigan beer confusion as I was trying to pare 40 some offerings down to 12 (only got to 21, and I still have thoughts of going to pick up a couple others). However, it is a solid offering, and one of the few fruit beers I would drink again."
"Gotta hand it to them for what this is, a Raspberry beer. Pours a dark straw/amber color, massive head, and decent lacing. Smells like, well, raspberries. I guess that's what they are going for so they nailed it. Taste is purely the tartness of the raspberries and, well, nothing else. No hint of hops or malt. Very clean. Very carbonated, so much so that it tends to explode in your mouth. A good beer for a fruit beer, something for the less hardcore beer drinkers to go for."
"poured cloudy amber small diminising head little lacing. aroma raspberry some malt and a small amount of orange. flavor was weak raspberry I thought by the stronger aroma of raspberry there would have been more flavor to this got hints of lemon and orange.Maybe if I hadnt tasted kuhnhenn eis bock raspberry I might have liked this better"
"This beer bridges the gap between light and flavorful. Manages to be a relatively light beer, but with a nice full bodied wheat presence. This is definitely a beer worthy of quaffing several liters."
"I'll pass on this one and keep buying your stouts. Average through and through."
"A big U.P. thanks goes to trbeer for the many samples."
"On the palate there is ample raspberry infusions charged with silky, windy lines of gas. More neutral than assertive and thankfully not sweet at all. Tangy, buttered grain flavors at the root. Nice that they didn't overplay the raspberry or the sugar. Kudos!"
"Without many fruit beers under my belt, thisone was a nice change of pace. Thanks CJRMellor for the sample. The brew poured a cloudy, hazy orange/copper with a average size, slight fiz, to its eggshell colored head. Lace was good and stuck around. The aroma was faint with a berry malt on the nose. A taste rush of flavored citrus, berry, and of coarse raspberry. Its followed by a watered down wave toward the finish. Just a hint of hop and raspberry leave the mouth dry and tart. A very drinkable fruit beer. Id like to try a cold one on a hot summers day."
"Drinakability is pretty good given a fruit beer but I would like to see more powerful raspbeery kick here."
"The pour showed a light copper color with a decent sized head. The smell was strongly of wheat malts with some raspberry. The taste was equivolent of the smell. Good mix of wheat and raspberry flavor. It had a pretty dry texture to it also. This was a nice easy drinking beer, not real complex or deep, but I don't think it was meant to be that way."
"Just had this on-tap at Ashley's... A pale, yellowish copper in color with light hints of pink. Broad, loose head. Aromas of raspberries and grain. Pretty big raspberry taste -- but somehow thinned or diluted. Tastes like the berries are drowning in water and losing their flavor a bit. Very little backbone and not a very crisp finish, so it feels a bit thin. But this is a supremely easy summer refresher -- went down so, so fast. Works well for what it's supposed to do -- which is provide an easy-drinking summer brew, I'd imagine."
