"Incredible! Tastes just like alcoholic Apple juice."
""
""
""
"Cherry Apple cider, smell is burting With the fruit. Not overly sweet, almost woody. Excellent fruit beer drinks more like a champagne"
""
"Pours a beautiful cherry/cranberry color red. The nose is bramble and evocative of spring days out in the fields. This is such a great beer that it really does bring a lot of memories and thoughts to mind. Outstanding! The cherry and apple elements shine through, with a complexity to the fruit blend and the lively carbonation. The body is full without being too slick or sickly."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: New Glarus is 4/4 with their big fruit bottles. Amazing fruit character, perfect balance and great complexity. if you want a fruit beer look no where else."
"Deep red pour. Super sweet and sticky. Fruit punch, berries and a touch of cranberry tartness. Full carbonation. Definitely a beer to share due to the sweetness but in small quantities its very nice."
""
""
"Just not for me, though I can appreciate some aspects of it including the look and feel."

"Shared at Beachwood in Seal Beach from a 750ml bottle poured into tulip. Red body with an off-white fizzy head that drops quickly to a few filmy islands. Aroma is sweet pixy stix, cherry, apple, and cranberry fruity notes with an eventual tartness. Taste is sweet early with cranberry and cherry notes followed by some pie spice and apple skin before finishing tart over the residual sweetness. Light body, thin texture, fizzy carbonation, and a tart sweet finish."

"O: I was hoping for a bit of funk/sour with the wild fermentation mentioned but it's still a darn tasty beer with pure fruit flavors"

""
"Overall, just an outstanding brew from NG, they cannot be touched when it comes to fruit sours."
""
""
"Nicely Balanced, not too sweet. Apple cider and Tart Cranberries counter the sweetness of the beer, very carbonated. definitely one of the more well balanced fruit beers i've had."

"Pour is a hazy reddish copper with a light tan bubbly head.  Nose is strong red apple, lots of cherry, and a faint touch of cranberry.  Taste has a good bit of red Apple, moderate cherries, like cranberries, and a moderate touch of sourness.  Light body, strong carb, dry finish.  Fruits are extremely bright and really play well together."
"Certainly this is not a bad beer, but it struck me as a bit simple and one dimensional, and was not a beer I could see myself wanting to buy again."
""
"Aroma of apples predominantly but some cherries present. Initial flavor is a healthy mix of apples and cherries. Cranberries are in the finish and resemble the dried fruit variety, texture and all. Surprisingly not tart but more on the sweet side. Very good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"By far the best fruit beer I have ever had.  You can taste the cherries, apples, and cranberries that blend beautifully.  I am not a huge fruit beer person, but this blew my socks off.  Sure wish I could get a keg of this."
""
"Just AMAZING"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not only is this the best fruit beer I've ever tasted its probably the best beer I've ever had at 4% and under, I can't believe how much flavor got jammed into this bottle.  I can't remember dropping a score this high in a long time, I want another!!"

"Simple but amazing fruit beer from New Glarus as expected, sooo drinkable and tasty. No sour funk here, just pure fruit goodness. If a pantheon of straight-up fruit beers existed, it would be Raspberry Tart, Wisconsin Belgian Red, and Serendipity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I hope that New Glarus keeps this fruit beer tradition alive for all of existence. Apple and cherries coat the palate with intensity and it lingers beautifully. This is fruit beer."

"Initially a cherry sweetness hits, meandering into cranberry tartness in the finish. Pretty dense body with strong carbonation.  Sweet overall. Attenuation isn't a priority here.  Syrupy for sure.  The apple might be adding to the cranberry finish, if we're dealing with crabapples or green apple flavors.  Its hard to tell.  It tastes like awesome cran-cherry fruit juice, and not a whole lot else.  I could see this as the best syrup in a great berlinerweisse.  On its own, this is a great dessert after a hefty pot roast or thanksgiving dinner.  It's not crazy complex, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better fruit beer."

"O: I really love this beer. Such a wonderful, unique flavor for a beer, and it gets even better and more juicy as it warms. My only complaint is the same one that people in 49 states have, that its only available in Wisconsin."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this beer is a world class fruit beer. It gives you that juicy, tart fruit without overdoing the overly-sweet aspects that most fruit beers fall victim to. New Glarus has wowed me again and I actually prefer this to the Raspberry Tart. Cheers!"

"Overall this among one of the sweetest beers that I've had and enjoyed more than thoroughly. The reason being that it has those fruit juice characteristics. I'm a sucker for fresh squeezed juice and this is about as close as you can get to it from something pertaining to the beer world. How New Glarus manages to hide all the malt character of the beer is beyond me. But I'm glad they succeed as I'm not a fan of fruit beers that display a malt backbone."
"O) This is another outstanding fruit beer by the experts at New Glarus. I've now had all but Raspberry Tart (on deck for another day) and I haven't been let down by any of them."
""
"O:Very tasty and very sweet.Something you gotta crave in my opinion.I would drink it again if I could but I would not go crazy chasing it.Deff worth the 12$ a bomber.I want to try other NG offerings a little less on the sweeter side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite fruit beer. Sweet apple and some tart cherries. Really nicely balanced. Love how juicy this is without tasting just like regular fruit juice. Great body for a 4% fruit beer, too."

"This is beyond amazing. The best fruit bier from New Glarus (and that's saying a LOT). Just sublime. Each and every time I have this, it's a treat. I've been in love with this one since it was released, and I have no idea why I've never reviewed it before. It's just perfect."

"O. This is probably my 2nd favorite NG fruit beer behind Strawberry Rhubarb. I could drink a lot of it without much issue. Would like to try to age one of these further as it is the only ""sour"" fruit beer in their line up"

"Pours dark red, two finger bone head. Smell is loaded with cranberry, cherry, and Apple of corse. Tastes of the same fruit, but also honey, and fairly sweet as expected. There is little carbonation and the texture is not thin. Overall this is very well done, loaded with fruit flavor and not super complex, just Really delicious. The best part about this beer is how it's not overly sweet, and not syrupy."
""
""
""
"T: Very similar to the smell. Which is a really good thing. There's just so much fruit juice packed into this thing, it's incredible. Tons of apple cider with a lot of juicy red cherry and cranberry juice cocktail thrown in for good measure. A hint of ripe pear, fruit leather and red apple skin on the finish. Just enough carbonation to break up the sweetness, though it could maybe do with just a touch more. This is the most fruit I've ever tasted in a beer. I really love this stuff."

"Overall a very nice sour ale I was lucky to try."
""
""
""
"Overall awesome, nice balance of sweetness and fruity juice with acid, nice sweetness to balance all the fruit juice without getting too sweet like some of hte other New Glarus beers, good apply cherry and cranberry fruits, faintest hint of oak that I kinda wish was a bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep reddish color ale with a nice thick foamy head with OK retention and some minor lacing. Aroma of cherry and sweet apple pie is out of this world and pretty closed to being perfect. Taste is also dominated by sweet apple pie notes with some sweet cherry notes and light malt presence. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Very easy to drink and almost veered into juice category but in a really good way."

"Tastes crisp and crisply tart, cherries and apples and the Great Lakes at the tail end of summer. Love love loved it."
"O - This is an insane concoction that I am falling in love with. An absolute fruit medley bomb that goes together so well. New Glarus crushes these fruit ales and I am in love."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very much enjoyed this beer. A lot of different flavors throughout. Just the type of complexity I like to taste in beers."
"Tasty and a lot more complex than their other awesome fruit beers. That's for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"O: Ultra sweet to the point that it got a bit too much to drink after a while. Greats flavors though. Could be drier. Extremely rich."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a must try beer"
""
"This is a very well-made fruit beer with a sourness that is pleasant. The fruits taste very real and fresh. A solid malt backing gives balance and support. Very enjoyable! Far above the typical American fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"IMO, New Glarus makes the best fruit beers. I've never had a bad one or even a mediocre one from them. Would I drink it again? I sure would! It's probably a good thing that I don't live in WI because is be drinking their fruit beers all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a fairly clear pinkish amber color with a with a huge bubbly pink tinged head that persists forever. The aroma is sweet tart and fruity. Tart and sweet cherries with bits of brown sugar and a touch of apple cider and tart berries with a hint of vanilla and oak. The flavor is quite sweet but the tart and fruitiness from the berries and apples counter that nicely. Very subtle woody vanilla flavors round this one out nicely. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet light syrupy mouthfeel. Nice brew, I would have really liked a bit more tartness, but I still had no problem enjoying this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Easily the best straight up fruit beer I've ever had. Not super complex, but it's not supposed to be. The beer is a canvas with which to showcase the fruit and it does it almost perfectly. This is definitely worth seeking out. If it was available in my area, it would be the perfect beer to stock up on and drink during the summer."

"Some have not liked this as much as the cherry or raspberry versions. This is every bit as good if not better. A wonderful beer."
""

"Bottle courtesy of Dmbforever. Poured into an 8oz snifter. Red amber brown in color with cream colored head. Decent head retention (about a minute and a half). Decent lacing and the head shows back up with each swirl. Aroma of dark sweet fruit (raspberry, cherry, tart apple). Aroma also has some slight funk to it, like earthy yeastiness. Taste is of cherries, raspberry, some plum, and blackberry as well. Very sweet. The tart cranberries are nice, but they don't cut the sweetness as much as I'd like. Good carbonation and medium body wrap the tongue in the fruit sweetness. Definitely another enjoyable brew from New Glarus."

"Overall, this might be the king of full-on fruit beers. As with any fruit beer, there is considerable sweetness, but this one uses the combination of fruits to balance the sweetness with some cleaner, drier flavors. I would gladly drink this one again, were it to fall into my lap."
""
""
""
""

"Shared a bottle of this ridiculousness with the wife. Needless to say, with word of it taking a hiatus shortly, I high tailed over to Wisconsin to stock up. Cranberry and cherry hit you in waves. At the same time, there's never any mistake this is beer, not fruit juice, not a wine cooler. Fantastic stuff. Best fruit beer I've had. Also, the best chick beer extant. If you are drinking fruit beer and it's not New Glarus, you are missing out."
"The palate opens with the bite of cranberries, tart and refreshing , before segueing into the cherry and apple flavors. The apple character is a blend of sweet and mildly tart apples, a blend of Gala and Pink Lady apples, I am tempted to imagine. The cherry character is a blend of dark red and near black cherries, a deep, fleshy flavor. Behind all of this is a mild malt sweetness, a blend of caramel and a little brown sugar. A touch of vanilla is also perceived. Medium in body and With a soft, creamy carbonation, this feels nice on the palate. Just a touch watery on the finish, the dominant lingering flavor is apple. Beautiful stuff, this is more cider than beer IMO. Very highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one pours a ruby hued amber color. There was a fizzy off-white head that didn’t linger long or leave much lacing. The nose is good. It almost smells like fruit juice, but not as sweet. Cherry, apple and cranberries are the most notable. The taste is also very good. There is a tartness and sweetness at the same time. Cherries, cranberry and apple. Somewhat lighter body. This is interesting and wonderful."
""

"750ml bottle: This one pours a ruby hued amber color. There was a fizzy off-white head that didn’t linger long or leave much lacing. The nose is good. It almost smells like fruit juice, but not as sweet. Cherry, apple and cranberries are the most notable. The taste is also very good. There is a tartness and sweetness at the same time. Cherries, cranberry and apple. Somewhat lighter body. This is interesting and wonderful. It is only 5.1%, but you don’t even realize there is alcohol in this."

"O- This is exactly what I like in a fruit beer. To me it should be big on the fruit flavors with a light to not discernible yeast profile, unless we're talkin' lambics of course. If I had the money I would replace soda pop with this stuff and keg it at my house. The thing the surprised me most was how balanced all three fruit flavors are, look forward to trying more New Glarus offerings in the future."
""
""
""
"750 ml bottle poured into small snifter. Low carbonation, some soapy lacing. Light cranberry in color. Aroma includes tart cherry, musty apple, cranberry. Taste is an amalgam of tart and sweet. All of the fruit is noted on taste, a little sweeter on taste than expected. Amazing."

"O - it is Serendipity! This beer is indeed the happy accident that New Glarus was hoping for. I don't know if New Glarus will continue to brew this beer seasonally but I would certainly would make a regular purchase of this beer if they do continue to produce it."
""
""
""
"Overall: If you are interested in a beer that will bring you that Christmas cheer year round, look no further than this New Glarus creation. As far as fruit beers go, the balance and complexity of this beer is second to none. So whether you are a beer veteran or new to the club, it’s almost impossible to not fall in love with Serendipity."
""

"It's a well done beer, but it is a bit too reminiscent of Martinelli's Apple Cider."

"Thanks to cdmillard for the opportunity to try this one. Pours a translucent amber with a frothy, off-white head that dissipates into a bubbly slick. Nose is very much reminiscent of Sucrets - medicinal cherry with the addition of ripe red apples. Taste is sweet and fruity - exactly what you would expect from New Glarus. The blend of fruits is really quite exceptional, but I don't get too much cranberry, although I suspect that its contribution was the medicinal notes in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body, with a bright, lively carbonation. I am not a huge fruit beer fan, but New Glarus always hits it out of the park for me. This beer is so flavorful at 4.0%; however, it is not for the meek as it is really quite sweet."

"This is my new favorite fruit beer from NG. Cheers!"
"Overall: One of the best fruit beers I've ever had. Just right. If I traded, this, Raspberry Tart and Wisconsin Belgian Red would be on my permanent ISO list. I could drink this every day."

"God, I really loved this thing. I'm glad I still have another bottle, and I'm debating whether to open it or not any time soon. The fruits are wonderfully present and robust here, as they should be, and the funky yeast and flavorful oak notes really add extra complexity to something that's already wonderful in its own right. NG has got to be one of the best fruit-infusing breweries in the country - I can't wait to try more from them soon."
""

"absolutely amazing fruit ale. Cherries come through perfectly and up front both on the nose and taste. Impossibly light and effervescent, this ale is a wonerful start or finisher to an evening. Slightly sour and tart finish that lingers cleanly for a bit. REAL cherry soda comes to mind. Must try, fan of fruit ales or no."

"The beer appears ruby to amber with a frothy, off white head. The aroma brings a potent dose of apples, pears, tart cranberries, sweet fruit juices. A typical New Glarus fruit beer. Bold and assertive. Teeming with flavor. Sweet cherries and apples with minimal alcohol. Though a bit sweet for my tastes, there's no denying that this is a terrific beer. Fantastic in small quantities."

""

"The ale is quite serendipitous indeed. Where drier Belgian sour ales often loose their fruit identity and the sweeter ones are sickly- this improvised ale lands right between for full fruit appreciation and without distracting cloying. Its a beautiful beer for most occasions- from complements to summer salads to the most esteemed celebration cheers."

"O- Wow im very surprised, i new it was going to be good, but i dint know it would be this good, apple cider, cherries, tartness, so refreshing, fruity goodness. My favorite of all the new glarus fruit beers."
"Pours a hazed rusty hue with copper high-lights when held up to a light source, tan head with nice lacing. A lot of fresh apples and tart cherries on the nose, the cranberry is noticeable but toned down compared to the others, very slight hint of barrel funk. Just like the nose, the apples and cherries make up a big part of the overall flavor, the finish is slightly tart from the cherries and cranberries with a touch of that barrel funk that was in the nose as well. The mouthfeel is lightly effervescent with small bubbles, silky smooth with a dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty, and not a big departure from New Glarus's other fruit beers."
"Not better than the Belgian Red, but just as good if not better than Raspberry Tart. Plenty of unique points on this one. Plenty light on its feet at 4% abv. A great morning and hot weather beer. Plenty earthy too. Good for blowing minds when people think the only beer is BMC AAL's."

"The folks at New Glarus are masters at making fruit beers, and this offering is no exception. Although some might be put off by this beer's sweetness and seemingly lack of ""beer-like"" qualities, I absolutely loved it and cannot wait to see what other ""accidents"" happen in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber to faint red with moderate lacing. The aroma is downright unbelievable. As advertised, sour cherry jumps to the forefront, backed up by notes of apple and cranberry. The taste is follows suit, with pleasant balance sour cherry sweetness and tartness, along with apple and cranberry. There's also a nice, fruity, spicy heat that follows in the aftertaste. The profile follows well, and is probably best compared to ginger ale for its sharpness. It thankfully has a low ABV (4.0%), or else I'd likely wind up face down on a sidewalk somewhere. For anyone who claims to hate beer, I'd recommend this in order to convert. Great stuff."
"Bottle from a friend. Pours a deep ruby red with off white two finger head. Huge bouquet of cranberry and cherry, sweet and tart smelling. Flavor is more cherry heavy with hints of the cranberry coming through. Very sweet, slight tart. More medicinal than I had hoped but not overwhelming. Lingering tart cranberry that grows on me while I go. Light to medium mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Cool beer, but not as good as Raspberry Tart."
""
""
""

"O - I knew this was going to be good; but not THIS good! I never knew a fruit beer could taste so damn complex, delicious and refreshing. Kudos to New Glarus for making the worlds finest fruit ales!"

""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome fruit beer. Not quite as good as the Raspberry and Cherry versions but it's a very close 3rd. Pretty amazing that one brewery can make the top 3 fruit beers. Magic touch I guess. Wonderful strong flavors from only 4% ABV too. Great fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - New Glarus simply kills it with their fruit ""beers"". This happy accident ale certainly is a happy accident. Belgian Red really impressed me and making up for the lack of cherries with cranberries and apples is just genius. Just the right amounts of sweetness and tartness ."
""
""
"O - Overall - very good fruit beer. So much fruity and juicy character, almost seems like an Ocean Spray juice blend more than a beer. Carbonation is light contributing to the juice character. Alcohol is not existent and doesn't even show its minimal 4% at all. Another outstanding fruit beer from New Glarus."
""
"I would probably takes this over New Glarus more common fruit beers. Hard to believe this was an accident and not a well thought out and planned beer. Sublimely executed nonetheless and all in a low ABV package."

"O: I like this better than Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart, but which seem overly sweet and one dimensional. It has the aspect of a fruited cider, which is interesting. But the drinkability is still limited by the sweet jammy-ness. This is best had in small doses."
""
""
""
"Copper red with good clarity and good general appearance. Aroma is strong on apples and cherries... can't really comment on other aspects. Tastes very tart but the apples sure are noticeable. Cranberries are tart and there's ample dose of cherry at the end. Mouthfeel is medium with full carbonation and the finish is clean but with a lasting tartness. If this is oak aged, then the oak is present only in the tannins, but I am not sure. Overall it's a very good fruit beer but the label hints that it should be an American Wild Ale."
"The taste was very tart - like cranberry cocktail juice and yet very sweet. I noted highlights of different fruits as I tasted it - for certain there were cranberries and apples. While it was fruity, it had a nice malty background which is a reminder to me that it's a beer, not juice nor fruity wine. It's a 1 pint and 9 fluid oz. bottle, yet very drinkable and I did not share this (there wasn't anyone to share with anyway). A relaxing beer to enjoy both during the day (it's only 4% ABV) and in the evening hours. Enjoy!"

"Pours a clear orange-red with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is mainly a variety of sweet fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice fruity presence that makes it super drinkable."

"O- From my past track record for NG brews, I had high expectations. Those expectations were exceeded! Marvelous true Session beer!"
""
"Pours a browned pink with a fleeting dusty rose cap. Smells of apples, cherries, oak and some lactic acid. Taste is cranberry well balanced with apples and cherries. The beer leans toward the tart side of things and helps the flavor profiles balance out like a well blended wine. There is a medium on lightly cloying body with moderate carb and a semi dry finish that makes me want the beer ice cold and in gulping portions on a early summer morning. Really a refreshing beer I believe to be an absolutely fantastic deviation from the normal New Glarus beers."
""
""
"O: Excellent fruit beer. I think this is the best one that New Glarus has made. It's like a mix of the apple ale, the cranbic, and the Belgian Red. All three flavors work together quite nicely. Apple is the dominate flavor, but they all play off one another. Would love to drink more of this on the regular."

"Bottle courtesy of GhostFace, cheers!! Shared at the March 2013 tasting in Santa Cruz. Pours a dazzling ruby amber color with a disappearing white fizz. Explosive cherry aroma with some sharp tartness to it, immediately similar to Jolly Ranchers. Flavor is revelatory, as is the case with most NG fruit beers. An absolute barrage of concentrated fruit madness. Cherries make up the major flavor component, candy-sweet but natural-tasting, with a base of ice cider apple flesh and a perfect cranberry bite on the finish, rounding out the immense sweetness with a divine tartness. This is easily on par with Belgian Red et. al. and arguably better, due to the complexity and synergy thereof. Serendipity indeed."

"Pours a transparent, rose-amber color with a handsome head of fine, khaki froth. Splotchy lacing clings handsomely to the glass as the beer recedes. The aroma smells strongly of green apple and cherry, with a hint of cinnamon. The flavor is pretty comparable to the nose, with the sourness taking center stage up front before a mild, honey-like sweetness comes through on the back end. The first sip really is delightfully puckering. I don't taste the cranberry so much per se; rather, it synergizes seamlessly with the other fruits. The cranberry actually seems to come through a bit more as the beer warms. A tingly, ascetic sourness asserts itself in the finish, kept vital by the perky carbonation. A distinct cinnamon flavor adds an extra element that keeps the melange from becoming too fruity. In spite of the bold flavor, the finish manages to remain mostly dry. This really is a fantastic sour ale that never becomes cloying in spite of its flavorful character. Another winning fruit beer from New Glarus."

"Big thanks goes out to StayWhatYouAre2 for sending me this one in a past box! Thanks Alex! Shared this one at a recent Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a deep ruby red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, apple, raspberry, cherry, and cherry cough drops. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, apple, raspberry, cherry, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I am a really big fan of New Glarus’ other offerings and this one was no exception. Tons of sweetness without being too sweet. Tons of fruit without being too fruity. There is just so much going on in this one with a nice balance to top it off that it makes it incredibly easy to drink. A true must try if you have not done so already, especially if you are a fan of Raspberry Tart or Belgian Red. You won’t regret it."
"O) New Glarus knows how to make fantastic fruit beers. This is no exception."
""
""
"O: Walks a fine line between sweet and tart, a good beer. I was (incorrectly) expecting something closer to a Wild Ale, and this is most definitely a fruit beer, period. Refreshing stuff."
"This.... Now THIS is how you do a fruit beer. Throw an apple, some cherries, and a few cranberries into a blender, bottle it up and call it Serendipity. Almost perfect execution of pure fruit flavors while avoiding all of the off-putting side-effect that commonly plague this style of beer. New Glarus... I like them. A lot."

This one is right up there with Raspberry Tart and Belgian Red. It does get a little overwhelming after a while - I wouldn't want to drink a whole 750, but splitting a bottle is perfect"

"Between this beer, Raspberry Tart, and Belgian Red, I think this is my new favorite. The carbonation is not as strong as Belgian Red, and the sour note as not as overwhelming as Raspberry Tart. I really hope Serendipity sticks around for a while."
"This is a medium bodied offering with a modest amount of carbonation. It is very easy drinking with the alcohol seemingly nonexistent. My only gripe is the medicinal aspect that pokes out at times but overall this is pretty good. You get everything as advertised in this: cherry, cranberry and apple in equal parts.

"Pour yields a reddish-brown colored brew with a short fizzy head that recedes somewhat quickly. The nose carries a strong bit of cherry and cranberry as well as underlying earthiness. Some tartness coming through, as well as fruit skin. Flavor is moderately tart but has far too much underlying sweetness. Body is medium and appropriate, but there's too much residual sweetness coming through. Pretty nice for a fruit beer, but pales in comparison to Belgian Red and, to a lesser degree, Raspberry Tart."
""
""
"Poured a clear ruby red color with tints of amber, and a small fizzy pink-white head that dissipated almost completely. Fruit juice aroma, obvious apple, lesser notes of berry / fruit punch. Taste was fresh and brilliant, apple juice, cran-razz, mostly sweet, but a bit of tartness in there as well, along with maybe a subtle touch of spice, but the apple flavor was clearly in charge here. Light-medium body, juicy, effervescent, and overall quite enjoyable. I'm not sure I'd want to take on a full bottle myself, and/or significant quantities on a regular basis, but it's definitely great in small quantities."

"Crazy ruby tones with an offwhite head. Good retention and lacing. Nose of cranberry and apple pie, some cherry sucker character as well. All three fruits are surprisingly well represented. Sweet malt, but fruits are huge. Taste has all of the fruits well represented, some pie filling, jammy and jolly rancher/lollipop flavours of the fruits in this brew. Medium feel, moderate sweetness and some effervescence. The Carey's hit it out of the park again."

"a lovely treat from new glarus. this one was made thanks to a cherry shortage, so cranberries and apples are added to account for the diminished cherry crop. the result is quite pleasant, and perfect for holiday season. the pour is raspberry looking pink in color, maybe a little darker, with a few fingers of fizzy white froth. the nose is remarkably sweet, like fruit candy, but also tart, a sour beer for sure. yeast is interestingly balanced out by the fruit, smells like sour granola. the taste is cranberry and sour yeast tartness at first, and then gently gives way to a holiday spice complex of apple and cinnamon and warming mulling spices, the spice then dies out and a ton of residual sugar is left over. this exacerbates as it warms. great feel with a ton of carbonation, made even lighter and more airy by the thin malt profile and the low abv. a lot like the raspberry tart in the sense that i dont need a whole 750ml bottle of this for myself, but it was a joy to try. i hope for plentiful cherry crops, but i also hope this beer stays in the lineup, a really nice compliment to some of their other fruit beers. the champaigne mouthfeel goes perfectly with the fruit and the sour. well done."

"O: glad they made this one. I really enjoy these low abv fruit beers."

""
"O- I've come to realize that I'm personally not a big fan of the New Glarus fruit beers. They are just all overpoweringly sweet and not that enjoyable for me. This beer had a ton of flavor, it's just the sweetness makes it almost undrinkable. I probably won't be having this beer again and I'm surprised so many people like it. I'd recommend it only if you like sweet and fruity beers."
"Doesn't impress me as much as the other New Glarus fruit beers. Flavor feels a bit bloated and less clean because of the presence of all those fruits, and I really want some tart or sour to balance out that sweetness. Amazing mouthfeel."
""
"Pours a toffee caramel rustic brown color with a nice white head that dissipates but doesn't fully disappear. Nose is apples, cherries, and the Belgian spicy notes similar to the Belgian Red. The taste starts with a little bit of lemon that moves on to the bombardment of fruits - cherries and apples are upfront and move on to a soft cranberry flavor, mixed in with the spicy NG yeast strain. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Overall, this is another fantastic fruit beer from NG. Glad I got to drink up some Belgian Red this weekend, but this makes a fine substitute."
""
""
""
" I'm so glad the harvest was short on cherries because this beer is the best fruit beer so far for me. I got 3 bottles and I forced myself to hide the other two as they are just too tempting right now. Easily one of my favorite beer experiences as well. New glarus has a great thing going."
"Very drinkable beer and the extra tartness helps keep the beer from getting too sweet which is my main complaint about the Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart. Miles better than either of those and I hope this becomes a staple."
"O - I enjoyed this just as much or more than the Belgian Red. This one is a little bit more sour and tart, but the flavors really blend together nicely. After drinking this, I only wish I had another bottle..."
""
""
"The beer pours a clean and clear ruby color, and it is capped by a thin, off-white head that leaves a decent amount of lace. A big fruit-cocktail of a nose features apple and cherry prominently, with hints of cranberry dancing between sweet and sour whiffs. Amazing nose! The palate receives much of the same treatment, with flavors of sweet and sour cherries, tart dark fruit, cranberries, apple, and a touch of oak creating a wonderfully refreshing and tart flavor experience. Silky in the mouth, Serendipity is medium-light in body and moderately carbonated. Happy accident indeed!"
""
""
"Bummer about the cherry shortage putting Belgian Red on hold, but I've been anxious to try this replacement brew. New Glarus makes fantastic beers showcasing each of these three fruits (cherry, apple, cranberry) so it's no surprise this motley crue of a beer delivers an assault of flavor. Cranberry seems most prominent and provides a real nice tartness. Happy to have more of these bottles in the ""cellar"""

"Notes: This light to moderate-bodied brew has a tart, but not overly dry mouthfeel. Serendipity is a fruit beer with very few flaws, as with most of the offerings from New Glarus. This brew is stunning, and I will certainly be seeking out more bottles. Cheers to the brewery for this fine effort!"

"This is a very good fruit beer. Very nice fruit sweetness and good tartness. The fruit flavors all blend together quite well. (4.0)"
"an excellent one from new glarus. kinda glad there was a cherry shortage in order to have this! honestly not THAT different from belgian red, but it is slightly less artificial ""candy"" tasting and more on the delicious sweet fruit sugars."

"O: What can I say? Yet another excellent fruit beer from Dan and Deb."
"This was great. In fact, I think I like it better than either of the WI Belgian Red or Rasp Tart. Come on guys, WI is the bounceberry capital of the U.S. Make this a regular."
"The beer pours a clear cranberry red with a thin tan head that settles to a ring around the beer's circumference. The nose is very pleasant boasting notes of ripe apples, cranberries and the new glarus house yeast. The taste is sweet, but not nearly as cloying as Belgian red or razz tart. The apple sweetness and slight cranberry tartness works well with the style. The mouthfeel is slightly tart, sweet yet well attenuated, and very drinkable. This is definitely a winner, something I'd try again."

"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a slightly tart and sweet aftertaste, and finishes somewhat dry. Buy this beer, or trade for it if you get the chance."

"True to form, it's another superb fruit beer by New Glarus. It's extremely drinkable and complex."
"Overall this is is a great beer. My roommate picked it up for me; definitely a good choice. I guess this was a one-off because of the drought and low crop of cherries this past season...but it's a great one-off. Way to make lemonade out of lemons New Glarus...or Serendipity out of apples (ahhh get it?)"
"O= This is a world class beer for anyone. From the most novice beer drinker to a seasoned vet this is a beer anyone can drink and say damn that tastes great. It's plain and simple quality ingredients used to make a quality beer. Seek this out and buy many in case they don't make it again."

"O - Fruity and sweet. Cherry and apple fruit salad. This was a great choice for after dinner."

"Serendipity pours a reddish color, with a large red head. Alot of sweet aromas, especially cherry. The taste has a blend of sweet fruits, cherry is profound, with hints of the apples and cranberries. Great full flavor, all the fruits blend together, there is no stages of flavors from the fruits. Not overpowering sweet. Overall a fantastic fruit beer."

"I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers overall but I have had a number of them and Serendipity reminds me that no one does it quite like New Glarus. Very enjoyable. I hope they keep this year round even when they bring back Belgian Red!"
"O – The best example of a fruit beer that I know of. I really don’t know how New Glarus could improve on this. Bravo!"
"Overall: ill keep this simple. this beer is amazing. even if you HATE beer, this beer is for you. perfect for a post-thanksgiving treat to just mellow your night. if you see this beer, buy it. one of the best beers i've ever had in my life. great job New Glarus, keep up the fruit beers and keep them your secret because they are truly a work of art."
"But it's not an exemplar. It's only itself. And itself is perfect."
"Overall: A truly great fruit beer. The fruit flavor is big and bold while the sweetness is balanced and the body is smooth. Well balanced and really tasty."
""
"O - Just a wonderful treat. You can bet I will be visiting this one again while it is around. And I'm not a fruit beer fan but this is really great."
""
"Effervescent bubbles give this beer life! Crisp and bubbly - fits this beer to perfection. Big flavors of cherries and apples. The cranberries really show up on this finish as this tarts up quite nicely. This sets itself apart from the other fruity mainstays from these guys. It's sweet, no doubt, some would say too sweet. But the tartness comes through at the right moment, giving a nice kick to the back end. I think I'd be able to get through a bottle of this one my own, but I find it is the perfect beer to share. Sweet. Tart. Tasty. Thank you, Dan. You work quite the magic with some fruit."
"Thanks to Traci for sending this one out for me to try. The beer poured out as a vibrant red color with a fizzy white colored head on top. The head settles and doesn't leave any lacing or retention behind on the glass... The smell of the beer smell like pure fruit with a little bit of oak in there to give it more of a natural essence. The taste of the beer is like fruit punch, it's got the cherry and the apple and the cranberry all in there at different times. The flavors mix well but really give off a juice-like flavor. The oak is a little on the hidden side, I feel it could have been aged a bit longer to possibly give this one more of that wooden flavor. The mouthfeel of the beer was highly carbonated, it was sharp, tart and crisp. It's was also light bodied for having such a large amount of flavor. Overall I can't complain it's a good brew much like the Raspberry Tart and the Belgian Red from New Glarus. This one just adds a new outlook to what they're able to pull off when nature throws them a curve ball. This beer is enjoyable, it's sweet and juicy and loaded with fruity flavors. It's worth trying if that is what you're into."
""
"Verdict: Another smashing success from New Glarus when it comes to fruit beer. They have a knack for this and this one is no different, I will miss Belgian Red for the time being, but this is a stand out beer and hopefully one that stays in production after Belgian Red returns!"

"Thanks, joshuaseresse, for the opportunity"
"I could drink this all day, and would have no problem slamming a bottle like it was water. Awesome."

"o - Overall a fantastic new fruit beer from New Glarus; I don't like it quite as much as Belgian Red, but it is on par with Raspberry Tart in my opinion, having now had a lot of all three in the last week. I think the reviewer who said this seems like a blend of Belgian Red, Cranbic, and Apple Ale is spot on...tastes like 70% Belgian Red, 20% Cranbic, and 10% Apple Ale. It has a light tartness to it which I loved, though it wasn't so sour that my girlfriend who doesn't like sours couldn't drink it; in fact, she loved it. World class, worth seeking out if you like their fruit beers."
""
""
"Overall: This is easily one of the best fruit beers that I’ve ever had and one of the finest that New Glarus has ever created! This is right at the top of the list with the Belgian Red and the Raspberry Tart. I really enjoyed the combination of sweet red fruit, oak, vanilla and the slight sour character the most in Serendipity. I highly recommend and suggest going out and getting this if you’re a fan of NG fruit ales and if you live in Wisconsin or live near the border."

"Pours a clear black-cherry red with a small pink head. Smells like apples, cherries, and cranberry juice, in that order of strength. Smells sweet. Taste is great. Starts like a sweet cherry pie, then tart, sour crisp apples and cranberries and finishes with a slightly malty finish. Very nice. Mouthfeel is acidic but not off-puttingly so. Clean, and refreshing. Will definitely buy another bottle or two before this beer disappears."

"Poured into a pint glass, the beer was a dark reddish amber color with bright clarity and a frothy head that left a halo of sticky spotty lacing around the edges of the glass. Big fruity aroma of cherries and cranberries, possibly apple too. The fruit is obviously natural with a light tartness to it. Flavors of cherry are most noticeable at first, then the supporting notes of the apple and cranberry blend in afterwards. Also in the mix is a nicely dry wood tannin in the aftertaste that balances the sweet tart quality of the fruit forward notes it leads off with. It's light body is reminiscent of Cranbic a little bit, so is the moderate tartness with a slight sharpness to it. Overall it's very drinkable, worth trying if you enjoy New Glarus' fruit beers, though it's not far off from the existing range."
""

"O- another amazing fruit beer from NG. The fruits blend perfectly together to give mouthwatering flavors and a very nice aroma."
""
""
"I'd say more, but this beer really speaks for itself. I normally prefer Raspberry Tart to the Belgian Red, as Belgian Red borders on too sweet, but Serendipity takes care of this. Rumor has it that New Glarus will brew this again if it is popular, and I hope that is true."
""
"This is definitely my favorite of the 3 fruit beers. They are all a treat, but this is the one of the three I think I could drink a whole bottle of due to the others being quite sweet. Hope this becomes a permanent addition."
"O - This beer works well both at fridge temp and closer to cellar temp. Poured cold it's reminiscent of sparkling wine, as it warms it gets closer to mulled cider with the spices becoming more pronounced. I drank the whole 750 myself over a period of two hours so I could see different characteristics of the beer evolve as it warmed. If you're going to share it, serve it closer to cellar temp. ABV isn't listed, but I would guess that it isn't very high, maybe 4.5 or 5.5%."
"All three fruits involved in this beer are immediately recognizable and full of robust flavor. I was hoping for slightly more sour, but it's a great beer nonetheless. Just not necessarily my particular style of choice."
"Overall - This is another absolute stand-out fruit beer from New Glarus. They seem to have a gift for capturing the authentic flavors of local fruit."
"O - Cranberries seems to be the main focus of this beer. Carbonation help stimulate and imitate the tartness of the cranberries. Glad to have another fruit beer mixed into the usual lineup of New Glarus barrel aged beers."

"O: Hands down the best fruit beer I've ever had. Tart cherry melds perfectly with the cranberry. The apples round the tart flavor out and make it thoroughly drinkable and enjoyable. 5"
"Picked up a few of these during my transit back from Darkness day. Gotta love New Glarus's attitude... Failed Cherry crop? No Problem! Poured into a New Glarus flute glass. Appearance is a deep purple red that is strikingly clear. It appears just like Juicy Juice. Minimal head and lacing. The nose is amazing. First thing that comes through is cranberry with a slight tartness. The apples then pick up and provide a bit of rustic character, and then comes the cherry. The three fruits are so harmonious which makes for a candied fruit aroma that suggests a bit of sweet and a bit of tart. The taste is incredible. It starts with the more candied side of the fruits, again with a nice harmony of the three featured fruits. The sweetness gives way to a nice tartness that takes over the palate. Delicious. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Overall, New Glarus has struck gold yet again with their fruited beer. This is perhaps the most balanced and delicious one yet. If you haven't sought this one out, do it...now."
"Lovely. Excellent."
"This spin-off of the famed Wisconsin Belgian Red is an apple, cranberry and cherry concoction from New Glarus. The beer pores a nut brown with red highlights and sports very little foam. The cherries pull through the aroma along with a heavy dose apples. The yeast also contributes. The flavor highlights the fruit: in many ways it reminds me of carbonated fruit juice with an emphasis on apples and a twist of beery goodness. The cherries nicely compliment the apples. The cranberries contribute tartness. The palate is left dry. This beer is complex with unique character."
"I just loved this beer. It was the first of 3 New Glarus beers I traded for that I get to enjoy and already it was the most intensely-flavored fruit beer I have ever had. It had such intense flavors, it was almost like drinking fruit juice. I suppose that might not appeal to some beer drinkers, but I really enjoyed it. I wish New Glarus beers like this one were available where I live (I had to trade for this one - thanks ABisonEgo). I wouldn't drink them all the time, but I would definitely crack one open every so often. One word of warning, though. Do NOT buy this beer if you don't like cranberries. Be warned!"

"Overall, a big disappointment for me. It is still an interesting beer, but I was hoping for a sour, more complex version of Belgian Red. This ended up being my least favorite of the New Glarus 750ml fruit beers. Maybe I'll age one for a bit and see if the tartness comes through at all."

"I can't think of a tastier fruit beer. At least as good as Belgian Red, maybe even better."
"D - This beer screams harvest. A lot of similar characteristics of Belgian Red but fairly different at the same time. New Glarus can work magic with their fruit beers."
"Overall: Dan Carey is a fruit beer genius! This beer proves it. He is no one trick pony hiding behind his world famous ""fruit twins"" and shows off his originality, creativity, and diversity with this beer. He is a truely amesome brewer who is not afraid to step out of his comfort zone and change it up for the better when conditions are not optimal for making his tried and true Belgian Red. He took all the strengths of the fruit beers (Belgian Red and Apple Ale) that he already brews, adds some cranberries and POOF the next big thing to come from this amazing small town WI brewery! Honestly, I enjoyed Serendipity better than both Raspberry Tart and Belgian Red; Senendipity blows both them both away. Raspberry Tart is now dethroned as my favorite New Glarus fruit beer. Lets keep in mind that both Raspberry Tart and Belgian Red are also wonderful fruit beers with very high accolades. My only request is... Dan please brew Serendipity all year long! Yep, I just said it!"

"This may very well be my favorite fruit beer from New Glarus. All of them are so well done and this is just a unique twist for a fruit beer and it works wonderfully."

"O: Overall this is another excellent Fruit beer from New Glarus, although I wouldn't expect anything less from Dan Carey! This is definitely a beer to seek out, I prefer it to both the Belgian Red and the Raspberry Tart. Both of them are also great beers, but they are a bit one dimensional where the Serendipity is a bit more complex. I hope this one sticks around, it shouldn't be a beer that temporarily replaces the Belgian Red, it should be added as another year round option."
"O - If you've experienced Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart, you'll find yourself in quite a familiar realm with Serendipity but, this beer doesn't only piggy back on their successes, it flourishes with new and delicious fruit experiences! Serendipity proves, once again, Dan Carey is an expert brewer of fruit beer. Buy without hesitation and be rewarded, for this, without question, will be another award-winning beer from New Glarus."
"Overall this may be my new favorite fruit brew from New Glarus. It's slightly tart as advertised but nowhere near Belgian Red or Raspberry Tart levels. The different fruits work so well together. I will definitely be buying much more of this brew and hope that it works its way into a somewhat regular rotation in years to come."

"WOW!!! I've had all of the New Glarus beers, all the Thumbprints, etc, and this is a REALLY special beer. I got 6 bombers of this today and I am enjoying my first glass as I type this. This is really like a combination of Belgian Red, Raspberry Tart and Enigma. That's the best way I can describe it. It has all the flavors of all 3 of those beers all blended into one. In fact, I emailed the brewery to tell them this was the best beer I've ever had by them. This is really an amazing beer. Wow. I can't recommend this more highly than I do. GO BUY THIS NOW!!!! World Class beer by NG."

"Happy accident indeed! New Glarus took the poor cherry crop in 2012 in stride and came up with a new delicious brew. Serendipity pours a burnt reddish color with a slightly pink head. The scent is still mostly cherries but is overall very fruity and sweet smelling giving it that classic sour ale smell. Taste is sweet and fruity with all the main elements (cherry, cranberry, and apple) evident in the mix. Added to the mix was the great decision to age this in oak to make this an interesting, fruity, and delicious sour ale that is supposedly only to be around until Jan 1 in place of their usual Belgian Red. Get it while you can folks!"
