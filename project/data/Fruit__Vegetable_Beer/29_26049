For me that is much preferable to those ""fake blueberry ales"".   But it is very drinkable and is remarkably refreshing.

Surprised to see it was Anheuser-Busch that brewed such an experimental beer.  In my opinion, a true craft beer pushes the limit against tradition, and this blueberry ""lager"" seems to aspire to do that.  But the smell is more on the artificial grape side than natural blueberry.  Surprisingly, the taste is light, sugary, and juice-like even with 8% ABV.  Reminds me of those nasty fruit flavored MD 20/20 liquors they sell at the gas station.  Lots of carbonation, very sweet, fruity, and no hops.  Strange aftertaste.  There is definitely room for improvement, and this style is not for everyone.  Perhaps they should have put the blueberry flavor in the background and brought out more wheat and hops to the surface so that it actually tastes like a beer.  I won't buy another one.","ENogueira","Sep 11, 2014"

Careful though, it's 8%, but you wouldn't know it by drinking it. I've had a lot of different beers, and this one is by far my favorite. Everyone has their go-to beer, and this one is mine. Unfortunately it's really expensive to drink every night, so you might wanna keep this one for some weekends or special occasions.","YaDad","Aug 26, 2014"

Sweet fruity smell (again, grape, I know it is supposed to be blueberry), but also some musty notes in there as well. Sweet berry favor. Blueberry flavor? Okay. I'll give you that. Some nuttyness in there as well. A Tart, astringent aftertaste. Tastes like an alcopop. If you want beer, this isn't it. A little thick and a bit sticky on the tongue, not bad (mouthfeel). Stupidly, I thought this was a Flying Dog creation. I thought, can't go wrong, it's Flying Dog. The label led me to believe so as it is very similar in style to the Flying Dog Beers. This to me is not a beer. I don't like this sort of beer anyway, and I think too many breweries are making fruit beers. I was all proud of myself for stepping away from the IPA's for this review.

Outstanding flavor, I enjoyed this beer very much, plus, it was very easy to drink which was surprising for an 8% beer, this gives it bonus points overall. And it was very reasonably priced. Not sure it is exactly a beer, more of a fruit cider, malt beverage, beer mix with blueberry juice, but I found it very tasty.

Except Blue here has a major kick to it and it's not a good kick! Unsophisticated sweet, syrup like consistency. I can't say anything good about this beverage. If I was underage and I wanted a buzz and had not developed a taste for beer or wine, this would be it. Really, this is just one bad excuse of a ""lager"". The alcohol does not mesh. It's almost like it was fortified with alcohol. The alcohol should complement the beer and be part of the taste experience. I have 5 1/2 bottles of this stuff left and don't know what to do with it. If this was Blue Moon, I could use it to bake an orange chicken. But, I don't want a blueberry blue/purple colored chicken. My wife says it reminds her of a cheap cosmo. I'm going to try it as a blueberry beer float with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it for dessert. If that doesn't work, down the drain. I would not serve this to a guest and I sure as heck won't drink it. Thinking back, this is very similar to Malt Duck and I hated Malt Duck. This stuff is worse than Hop n Gator.","RHWeir","Jun 12, 2013"

This beer has over 250 calories and is so not worth the cost or the health impacts. The alcohol content is also very high --almost 8%. If you like getting buzzed of cough syrup or you're an advocate of sugary wine coolers/kool-aid/grape soda combos then this is definitely the beer for you.

The taste was a real surprise as it tasted pretty good for what it is, I don't care for blueberries in the first place but I wanted to keep a open mind. The berry flavor was just enough but not over the top, on the down side not much Lager came through and that results in a 8% ABV adult juice drink....still have to try the Raspberry sister beer...and I do like Raspberries...I like a little more beer with my beer but I'm glad I tried it.","Bear1964","Apr 07, 2013"

If Wild Red was a purplish-red, then this is a reddish-purple in color with NE-quality clarity. How can it be so bright and still have the possibility of sediment? Nose smelled like blueberry pie, which is to say, blueberry-like and quite sweet. I once really loved blueberry pie, but now I find it too sweet for my taste, so I am not holding out a lot of hope for this beer. Mouthfeel was thin and watery and the taste was unnaturally sweet. I begin to question how much actual fruit goes into these types of beers and how much of it is simply chemically manufactured esters. Finish was candy sweet and although it was not horrible, it was not something that I would want to drink more than one of them. Hell, I may have trouble finishing one without going into diabetic shock ...","woodychandler","Mar 09, 2013"

I’ve docked some good fruit beers for lacking base beer characteristics in the past. Not only does this one lack any base beer characteristics but it also does not smell, taste, or feel good. I wonder how the other offerings in this “wild” series are, but I don’t think I’m curious enough to try them. Stick to the usual adjunct lagers, AB InBev.

I finally read a quote of someone saying it was like ""between a beer and a wine"". That intrigued me because I love wine. I love blueberries. I ignored the bad reviews and took the plunge. I LOVE this beer! It is different! It does have a sweetnesss to it, but it is not the thick syrupy taste, just a light sweet flavor. It does remind me of a wine more than a beer. The flavor is pleasing, light, with a fruitiness that tastes good. Unlike most beers, it has a pretty color of what you would expect from a blueberry beverage, a definite purple. It has a two finger head that does dissipate. Although I resisted even sampling this beer, it has become my favorite! I am wondering since it actually is made from blueberry juice, if any of the healthy anthocyanins remain in the beer? If so, it would be a health beverage as well as just an enjoyable one.","skychaser","Feb 21, 2012"

There was a definite lack of high fructose corn syrup, which I liked - though I doubt I'll ever really know if they use real blueberries like they say they do. Nestled up close to the blueberries were some cranberries and raspberries as well, but they tasted like they'd been cooked down to the bare minimum of flavors. There may have also been a few dark grapes and a very faint maltiness that lingered way underneath, but my tongue was so over-burdened with blueberries that it was hard to find anything else, much like the nose. So, obviously with all of that fruit, it was very sweet and it also managed to keep the carbonation going for most of the beer, despite the bubbles being like tiny champagne bubbles - which made the whole drink reminiscent of a fruit cider. Also, it had a very thin mouthfeel and a rather dry, crisp ending even with all of the big juicy fruit flavors, and tasted something like a slightly carbonated juice beverage that was on its way to going flat. It carried no aftertaste and in the end, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. A fruit beer like this just isn't my style, it's too sweet with not enough sour, and I'm beginning to think that even though I tried not to be a snob about it being a product from Anheuser-Busch, the knowledge (unfortunately) definitely tainted my experience.","Lucklys","Jan 17, 2011"

I think of this beer as more of a lambic than anything if you are looking for a retreat from the more servitude koscher beer flavors than this beer is for you.
