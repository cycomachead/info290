"I know other people have slammed this, but I loved it. My god the nose on this beer is unreal."
""

"On tap at The Bruery poured into a taster by the server trying to entice bottle purchases. Appearance is brown with orange highlights, tan head the quickly settles to a film, and minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet potato pie spices, maple syrup, brown sugar, and malt. Taste is light brown sugar and yam sweetness complimented by the nutmeg, clove, and allspice bitterness. Medium body, moderate carbonation,thick texture, clean finish."

"On tap at The Bruery. Had trouble finishing my taster in the flight, had a really foul aftertaste."
""
""
"Great Belgium fall style, but sets itself part by staying away from pumpkin and turning to yams instead."
"Reddish brown color with nice head.  Smells of yams and spices.  Tastes of yams, nutmeg, and molasses.  Sweet mixed with a strong vegetative taste.  Not necessarily my favorite beer, but I think its pretty well done for what they were trying to do here.  At the very least its unique."
"Red brown body. Nice sized cream head. Yeast Belgian aroma. Hints of banana and fig. Slight tart taste with a banana and maple finish. Has a lot of Belgian style characteristics. It’s ok."
""
""
"Overall:  This is quite an excellent beer!  I love the perfect balance between malt and fruit and sweet and sour.  It’s a great quaff on its own, but paired with food, especially Thanksgiving dinner, it’s absolutely brilliant!"
""
"Not my favorite - ended up trying to finishing most of the bottle myself cause the wife hated it.  Was OK paired with some dark chocolate, but all the unique flavors never really came together."
""
"750ml into a matching Bruery snifter. The brew appears a deep reddish brown color with a yellow cap. The smells of yams is prevalent initially then caramel spice and earth as it warms. As the experience continues its almost soapy. The taste is tart and fruity with some vegetative component that isnt that great. A bit of spice. Inwould not drink this again, its pretty bad."
"Strong aroma has malty, pumpkin and spicy notes. Pours a clear dark amber with a thick, buttery-tan head. Flavor has firm malty, earthy and pumpkin notes with hints of cinnamon and maple syrup. Texture has good body and a fair amount of fizz. Definitely worth seeking for autumn!"
"Pours a medium cloudy brown with small white head. The description is better than the actual experience. There is a complex flavor of maple, pears and nuts, but very tart, similar to an Oud Bruin."
""
""
""
"O - interesting and I liked it, maybe a little more spice to balance out the sweetness would make it even better."

"This is a very complex beer but what is so interesting is that the nose and flavors were so identical. I catch Belgian yeast at first with sweet potatoes, light clove, nutmeg, pumpkin pie, cinnamon, malt, toffee and then an odd turn to bubblegum. Complex and pleasantly different this is a very enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not AWESOME, but i'm not upset I bought it to go with Thanksgiving dinner. Same feeling I get with each Bruery beer I try: it'd taste a ton better if the price point was lower."
""
""
""
"Overall: This was an interesting beer. It really wasn't a pumpkin beer but an autumn beer. I don't know what they mean by yams. I live in the South and a damn yam is not a sweet potato! If it is sweet potatoes then they need to say what it is, anyway, this is an interesting beer and has intrigued me enough to try some of their other offerings which I have heard are much better anyway. It was a good deal for the beer considering the flavors and size of the bottle. I would suggest this one and I might purchase this one again next year. If I decide to even hop on the fall beer train. I am kind of over it at this point and this was the last one of the year and I saved it for the last ""Fall"" holiday, Thanksgiving!"

"Autumn Maple is a great take on the pumpkin ale style. Leave it up to The Bruery to take the road less traveled and create a pumpkin ale-style beer and leave the pumpkin out completely. The yams work nicely on the mouthfeel and likely help this beer achieve the high ABV (lots of fermentable sugars in yams). The beer is spicy, sweet, and alcoholic without overdoing any of those things. Really good stuff."
""
""
"Taste: Fig, raisin, yam, and maple."
""
""
""
"This beer takes an interesting direction with the Belgian qualities, as I thought the ingredients would be much more suited to a dark stout. It mostly works, despite a few hiccups in the form of harshness or flavors that don't quite mesh. In the end, it's enjoyable, but not necessarily a beer I'd have more than one of."
""
""

"O-  A very interested and pleasant take on the pumpkin/yam beer.  I'll certainly seek this out once a year."

"o: a bit disappointed at the prevalence of alcohol in here - however, it is 10% so a little is to be expected.  the reason this works for a fall beer is the mixture of yams and brown sugar - it screams fall.  if some of the alcohol heat was lost this would be great"
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, I was impressed with this Brown Ale. The quick hit of the molasses soothes out to a candied yam finiish. The aftertaste to me was subtle spices that only lasted for less then a minute. The smell was soft and pairable with it's flavors. If you are looking for a brew with flavors inspired from old fashioned Dutch then It's worth a try."

""

""

"It would be better if the molasses flavor didn't overpower the maple. I like it otherwise. Maybe it's a California thing, but he molasses hit my palate first which was not what I expected."

"Interdasting, drank slow, got hot, drank slower, got hotter, delicious spice, sweet, enjoyed."

"Pours a dark, murky brown color with a short lived head.  The aroma is sweet like candied yams, perhaps a touch of fruit and certainly alcohol.  Tastes follow suit with sweet candied yams, alcohol, belgian yeast, stranger dryness and an overall strange profile.  The maple adds to the sweetness and the beer really doesn't go anywhere.  More of a chore than a pleasure to drink, but certainly interesting."

"Pours a dark red brown color with a one finger mocha colored head. Smells like maple syrup, yams, cinnamon, brown sugar,  sweet bread. Tastes predominantly like candied yams with subtle cloves and nutmeg in the finish. Yikes not quite what I remembered from last year. Enjoyable, but too heavy on the yam."

"Poured crisply - had a nice sweet smell of the yams it boasted as well as everything autumnal, but the taste sadly washed down with more of a cough medicine sensation - very sugary, a little too much for my taste.   And the taste lingered for a little longer than I would've liked as well."

"This years version was the highlight on tap but from the bottle not so much. I guess it does makes a difference. You get spice, nutmeg, slightly hot but drinkable. The color is maple syrup brown but the taste not so much. The overall taste is balanced on tap with the bold flavors of liquid yams, spices, sweet mouthful of goodness. The bottle is lack of any of yams and its heat(alcohol)  overpowers it. It's very inconsistent to what I tasted on tap   then from the bottle. Go figure! Cheers."

"I realize experimentaion is how you create new product. This seems like a mistake they brewed to much of and said well.... Lets put it in a fancy bottle with a fancy label and someone will buy it. Please dont. YUK!"

"This is hard to evaluate – it’s supposed to be a brown ale and it’s definitely brown and sweet, but the flavor is so mixed up that nothing stands out except a continual sweetness."

"Took this over to my beer gru's house for a snobbery session. I picked this one up on clearance for $10. At first the taste was void not great but it grew on me as it warmed. Bonus points overall because it is very easy to drink for 10%. Overall it was a very enjoyable beer that I hope to have again, depending upon cost."
"My eager young beer cadet (whom is quite the expert now) brought this one over to split. Its quite different than I expected. Very light for 10% and slightly tangy and tart, almost like a wild ale. Not exactly the strong brown ale with maple syrup like I thought. Overall I really liked this one. Highly recommend."

"750ml (1pt 94 fl.oz.) bottle. Tripel Karmeliet Oversized Chalice glass. Pours brown in color, reddish ruby to the light. Headed by beige crown showing fairly good retention. Toasted & caramel malts, figs, dats, ripe orange pulp hues, nutmeg & herbs are displayed on the aroma profile. Toasted & caramelish upfront. Full body. Soft carbonation. Flavor of molasses, maple syrup notes , brown sugar, slight phenolic touch & anice hints are balanced by herbal bitterness in the middle. Sweet no-cloying finish. Gentle warming, no harsh, kind & sugary ABV through the throat. Ripe fruit apricot-like on the aftertaste."

"O- Next to Uinta's Oak Jacked Imperial Pumpkin, The Bruery's Autumn Maple stands as a close second (Samuel Adams Fat Jack rounds out my top three for pumpkin/gourdy ales). Despite reviewing a bottle ""past it's prime," this beer ages exceptionally well and suits a sub-zero winter just as much as a cool autumn. Along with Uinta and Anchorage, The Bruery stands to be one of my top three breweries in 2013. Regardless of style, I encourage you all to give The Bruery serious consideration...it is worth it! 4.75"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Bruery makes amazing brews and this is one of my favorites. First of all, the Fall is my favorite season and this beer compliments that time of the year perfectly (in my opinion). The appearance is like that of the brilliant maple leaf as it falls from the limb to the ground. Aromas of boozy autumn flavors fill the air and warms my palate as it flows throughout. The best part is that I found this gem in the cooler hidden behind other beers and paid less than $10 for it... Nice!"

"A great twist on the fall seasonal tradition. Loved this one."
""
""
"O: Low overall because I don't think this was worth the price, and it didn't taste or smell ANYTHING like a pumpkin seasonal."
"Bottom Line: I'm not going to bother next year, though I may be in the minority. Can't recommend based on the bottle sampled."
""
"A nice seasonal beer that hits the spot the same way a pumpkin beer does. This reminds me of something made by Southern Tier- good, but definitely a little over the top on the sweet end. Pours a slightly murky amber with little head. Sweet with yams and brown sugar, and moderately spiced with winter spices. Balanced, if a bit sweet. There is also a fairly nice bready finish that is a bit like an uniced cinnamon roll- yeasty,bready, a bit spicy, but not that sweet. All in all, a pleasant experience, especially after the beer opens up for a while. It seems to get less sweet and certainly less carbonated- and breadier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable sweet offering that will pair excellently with roasted veggies and baked chicken, a little too sweet however to pair with some meals, but would make a nice fireside sipper. Nice stand in for a sherry or even a port."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Autumn Maple is an interesting take on the pumkin/holiday ale style. I think I would have preferred it without the Belgian yeast strain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm glad this ended up being enjoyable, in spite of my fears of how this would turn out aged. Can't say the same amount of praise for this when fresh, but I'm definitely interested in trying the barrel aged variant. Not my favorite release of all time during this season, but it's undeniably food friendly, and very good to use for cooking as well. A success overall from one of the most divisive breweries there is."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a slightly vigorous and brownish head that dissipates very quickly and very little lacing is left behind. The beer itself is a clear brown that has a dark copper hue to it. However, seen in the right light, the beer also has bits of red. The beer has a strong maple smell with hints of hops complementing the maple and spices that make their appearance. In addition to the maple, the beer has hints of a banana smell that is probably the yeast and brown sugar, both of which complement the maple. The taste is fairly different from the smell. While the maple does play a central role among the various taste, the hops seem to come out more as an aftertaste. The spices are more distinct than smell. The various spices vary from cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. Overall, the beer has a sugary and nutty flavor with a heavier emphasis on spices than other brown ales. Notes of yam are also present. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation. The beer has a smooth feel but with some texture as it is drunk. Overall, the beer is pretty good and worth getting when available."
""
"O- I really enjoyed this, it's definitely a sipper as the ABV is definitely noticeable. It pairs amazing well with thanksgiving food, especially pumpkin pie. A lot of other reviews stated that it was too boozy, I did not find this. Perhaps the year of aging mellowed it out a bit."
""
""
""
""
"IMHO, the Bruery makes great beers. This is one of the more under- appreciated examples."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew succeeds where most pumpkin ales fail. Most pumpkin ales are thin in body and are too spice forward, where Autumn Maple allows the yams and their texture to shine alongside the Autumn spices."
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer with sweetness throughout. Great for sipping and savoring."
""
""
""

"I was not sure I'd love this beer but I was sure my guests would love it. But it turns out that I knew I would love this beer and I ended up drinking almost a third of the bottle. It's definitely a tricky beer to pull out at T-day (the perfect beer but...) some people just don't love a complex beer like this. Have you ever had sweet potatoes with maple syrup? Yeah. So this is that and somehow better. It takes a moment, but it strikes you that the flavor and mouthfeel of this ambitious T-day beer is rightly balanced. I was sad when the bottle was done, despite all the other beers at my fingertips (I over-prepared for Thanksgiving cuz it was my first time hosting...lots of leftover food and beer!) Thanks The Bruery, let's make this a tradition."
"TOTAL = 39/50"
""
""
"M - medium/lighter bodied. Good carbonation, Would have liked it be more full bodied"
"Tastes slick and low carbonated, with flavors that are vegetable-like (the yams), and a spice blend (mostly all-spice) that works well with the former. Certainly a sweet edge due to the syrup, where maple flavor doesn't come to the forefront quite like the overall seeetness of its sugar. Not complex, although more sipping gives me more of an apple note. A mild burn briefly pops through afterward, then levels off. A sipper. Wish it were better carbonated. Seems perfect to accompany a holiday meal, so as intended, this will be had with Thanksgiving dinner. A different type of beer, and despite not favoring this style, appreciated. Update following meal: score on this brew bumped up by nearly a full point, just because it compliments this type of meal (incl turkey, cranberry sauce, broccoli, hot rolls etc.) perfectly."
""

"The mouthfeel was not that pleasant, and the people with me agreed."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-One glass is enough for me. A big, rich Fall beer. Probably won't have it again but it was unique and worth a pour."
"The pour is a dark orangey brown, with not much head at all. The aroma is heavy in cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. The taste is actually a nice combo of the spices as well. I'm a little disappointed that there isn't more of a maple flavor though. The mouth feel is great, and it hangs around just long enough to let the palate experience the spices."

"Appearance is a muddy brownish copper with golden edges. There is about a half finger of head that dissipates fairly quickly. The nose is complex - maple, pumpkin and assorted fall spices. The taste starts off mildly tart and the flavor builds to include seasonal spices and yams. There are both sweet and dry notes on the finish along with a slight alcohol warmth. This is a pretty complex offering that would be perfect alongside turkey with all the trimmings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is surprisingly drinkable for such a strong beer as it manages to hide its alcohol very well. It's a nice alternative to a pumpkin beer if you are looking for something seasonal to have during the autumn months, such as during Thanksgiving dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a nice, if unremarkable, autumn ale. I probably won't go back to this well, but it's definitely worth a try if you are a fan of autumnal and/or pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
"If this beer was a holiday it would be Thanksgiving. It is full of fall, spicy flavors with a wonderful full-bodied, sweet taste that reminds you of your grandmas sweet potatoes or pumpkin pie."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall: everyone has an opinion...if I could buy this for $10+ or Pumking for $7, I will take a Pumking everyday! Having said that, I would try this again, and possibly hope for more maple flavor."
"The bottle I had this year was a 1.5, the 2013 draft pour I just had was a 4.25."

"O- While not properly a pumpkin beer this is the best pumpkin (or yam) beer I have ever had. Very balanced flavor profile between the spices, sweetness from the yams and maple syrup, and bitterness. Very complex and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A big ""pumpkin"" beer and great for the season. A bit big of alcohol for drinking by itself, but definitely works for dessert or food pairing."
""
"This is a slightly different yet familiar take on the classic pumpkin beer. Similar spices but a good bit more sweetness and depth. Typically a little hot, a year has settled this one down. I'm looking forward to trying the barrel aged version soon."
"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Very classy looking beer, burgundy in color, off white/tan head doesn't last too long. Smell is oak, pumpkin spices, brown sugar, green tea, not much maple. The maple comes out a tiny bit more in the taste but is still disappointingly subtle. The yam I think has a cleaner less punchy flavor than pumpkin which in my opinion is a good thing. Pumpkin can be very pungent depending on the species and ripeness and I've definitely enjoyed a minority of the many pumpkin beers that I've tried; sufficed to say I'm not the greatest pumpkin beer fan. Mouth feel is good, decent amount of carbonation, medium bodied, a little bit of alcohol spice on the finish. The alcohol is actually very well hidden in this beer. Overall I think if you're going to call out the main ingredient in a beer then it should be front and center, the maple is too subtle. But that's about my only serious complaint. The yam works amazingly well as a pumpkin replacement. The flavor is extremely well balanced, the pumpkin spices are not overpowering. A perfect beer to enjoy on a cold evening cozied up in front of a roaring fire."
""
"O: This is a really tasty fall beer offering and definitely one that I will enjoy again - the flavors go great with some German pretzels while watching football, it really makes me think of the autumn. Alcohol is well hidden so I would recommend sipping this one since it could easily sneak up on you. Nice complexity to the flavors with depth."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/25/2013. Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, pear, apple, raisin, dark bread, toast, yam, cinnamon, clove, allspice, maple syrup, pepper, nutmeg, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, pear, raisin, apple, molasses, toast, cinnamon, yam, nutmeg, clove, allspice, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Lingering notes of dark fruit, apple, molasses, cinnamon, toast, yam, nutmeg, clove, allspice, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent spiced Belgian strong ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt, yam, spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
"Dollar for dollar, this was a good beer and a nice representation of a Belgian ale. Maybe a little overpowering in the sweetness category. I'd save this one for dessert. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I thought this beer was okay, I would have enjoyed it along with a thanksgiving dinner but It is not something that an average beer drinker would appreciate. I have had beers that disguise the alcohol content better at a higher ABV. I have had beers that I think do the spice additions better. But as a lover of sweet potatoes I was curious. I think this would be better barrel aged or cellared ."
"O: The spices shine here but in the end overwhelm the remaining components of this beer, particularly the candied yam presence. The flavors here don't quite combine into a synergistic whole. A laudable attempt at creating a novel fall brew but overall can use some polishing."
""
"O- An awesome beer. Sort of like an imperial pumpkin ale but not quite. A different beer and well done."

"O: A good beer from The Bruery. I'm glad they tried something different for their fall seasonal..not sure it really beat the good ol' pumpkin ale though. It definitely got very sweet towards the end. Good beer overall."
""
""
""
"Overall- I really wanted to like this beer... a lot. The use of yams (or sweet potatoes- I'm assuming they used sweet potatoes as yams are actually sparse in US and, I imagine, impossible to find in California) could have been an intriguing contrast to the season's glut of pumpkins. Nice spice and an above average, almost good beer. Still, somewhat of a disappointment."
""
""
""
"I like this. Poured at a good temperature with a small to medium sized, light tan, foamy head that soon settled to a ring and an island with some lace. Color is a clear amber copper with no bubble trails. Aroma is, to me, barely distinguishable from pumpkins, but my snooter don't work so well. Nevertheless, lots going on - spice, malt, sweet caramel starch, fleeting pepper, a wink at hops. Flavor is like nose, tang is up front followed very closely with the malt, starch, caramel, spices and an array of lovely, interesting complexities. Body/carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, true, of good length, and only at the very end do I get the alcohol smack down. I like it!"

"Overall: This is an interesting take on the pumpkin beer by The Bruery. The addition of yams gives this a more uncommon dimension. The price isn't too bad, especially for an offering by The Bruery ($11.99 per bottle in my area). Reminds of a sweet potato casserole, covered with brown sugar and spices. Very nice on a cool, autumn night, or around the winter holidays. One to sip and experience. Really enjoyed this one."

"T/M: The molasses hits the palate first...hard. Where some beers (especially big stouts) infer their notes of molasses, this beats you over the tongue. Upon further sips, the flavors unravel a bit as the big, ripe, fruity esters of the Belgian yeast strain play nicely with the maple syrup. The sweet potatoes not only lend their flavor, but make the brew chewy, a little chalky. Thankfully, there are ample scrubbing bubbles because it's a lot to take down - even with the carbonation there's plenty of sticky residue between swallows. The booze pops in mid-sip to break things up a bit, but man, the molasses really sticks around throughout the sip. I'd definitely tone down the molasses next batch. Finishes long and sweet."

"Overall: the spices aren't overwhelming and although I describe them in sections they run together except for the cinnamon in the finish which lingers for a while. A very nice and complex brew."
"D - Not bad, it is certainly a different take on a fall beer and one that is exactly what you would expect from this brewery."

"O- Was expecting a bit more from this one but I must give it extra points for how incredibly drinkable it is for a 10% beer."
""
"This beer was my first experience with a yam brewed beer. I must say that while the beer description was great, the beer its self was not to my liking. I drank this beer on a cool winter day, and I just could not enjoy this beer. The smell was defiantly a tuber brewed beer, smelling sweet and earthy, but the flavor was peculiar. On initial taste, the beer is overpowering. I suggest letting the beer breath for at least a few minutes. Again, earthy and sweet, not a regular flavor for beer. I believe the intent of the brewers was to have you enjoy one of these after thanksgiving dinner with a piece of pie. Best of luck in your adventures, Z."

"Overall - I don't love the style, but I enjoyed this. Tough to distinguish the yam base. Tasty combination of extraneous flavors."

"When poured, a dark, hazy maple brow with very little foam and absoutle no lace. The smell had a sour/sweet aroma, with maple and spices. The taste had a sweet/sour/salty flavor of sweet/sour/salty spices, maple and candy. This Fruit/Vegetable Beer was to sour/salty for my palate. The flavor was short, but the saltyness just stayed to long on the aftertaste. For me a waste of money and time!"

"O: This is a great holiday brew! Its very balanced even with all those wonderful holiday flavors, looks great, smells and feels good.

"Poured from 750ml bottle into a stemmed wine glass. Cloudy caramel in color, with a very thin tan head, recedes pretty quickly. No lacing. Smells very belgiany, with spices and a blend of the other elements supposedly used in the brewing process: yams, molasses, and maple syrup. Taste is similar, but with some dark fruit added. Mouthfeel is sharp, crisp, and somewhat refreshing with a buttery/pastry aftertaste. It's definitely rich. Overall, not a huge fan of this beer and I suppose I hyped it up myself because I was so interested in the maple aspect. I would be interested in trying this with some age on it. Cheers."
""
"Thick mouthfeel, with medium to high carbonation. Finish is of spices and is sweet, malty and fruity. Overall this is an excellent dessert beer -- very rich, sweet and spicy. Recommended"
"Good beer. Happy to have tried it."
"Overall this is a very nice pumpkin/spice/holiday type beer. A bit high on the ABV for a beer of it's type, but still enjoyable and definitely a different and original take on the pumpkin style beer."
""
"O: Interesting flavor, drinkable, with a refreshing light tartness. Solid all-around."
""
"ADDENDUM: As the beer warms, the flavors blend much more nicely. I'd recommend enjoying this beer after it has warmed in your glass."
"O- i have had this one before but it was an infected batch and tasted like sour apple. Glad to finally try it as intended. It's pretty straight forward and nothing awe inspiring. It's basically a pumpkin ale w/ molasses & belgian yeast. I was hoping for more of a candied yam flavor/aroma, but just got raw yams instead. Was hoping for a creamy mouthfeel w/ low carbonation but got medium body w/ crisp carbonation which was off putting & didn't go w/ the flavor/aroma. All & all a decent brew and i enjoyed it."

"Interesting, but not something I could drink a lot of. Kind of messy with the belgian phenolics and the pumpkin pie like taste."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really original and delicious autumn/holiday beer. I like it better than most pumpkin ales I've had. In many ways it just tastes like a clever, subtle variation on a big Belgian quad or strong ale, rather than the gimmick it might've been given its unusual ingredients."
"O - overall, this is a pretty decent fall offering; seems like it would pair well with turkey and stuffing; unique take on a brown with all that Belgian influence; has the right amount of booze to flavor ratio where I wouldn't want to drink more than a glass and still get my fuzz on wo over committing."

"aged a little but tasted really good"
""

"O: Good but not worth the hassel of finding a website that would ship to me. Maybe ill get another and let it sit for a year."
"Overall, this is a delicious beer. It is a perfect accompaniment to a holiday meal. My only issue with it is that it is very rich and it is difficult to drink a lot of it. Share your bottle with friends and family at the holiday table."
""
""
"O- This is not exactly what I was expecting, but it was a great brew. I personally do wish I could have tasted more of the yams, as I feel like the flavor was covered up almost entirely by the yeast and spices. Good seasonal brew overall though."
""
""
"Overall: I didn't like this beer and I could not get anyone to drink more than half a glass, I think its got to much going on at once. We enjoyed lots of other belgian styled beers and we like them but I won't buy this one again, If you buy this beer do not open it > Wait at least 1 year. This beer is not aged."

"Had this after Thanksgiving dinner with some pumpkin pie, which made for a great combo. The Belgian influence makes for an interesting take on the pumpkin/autumn beer genre."

"Bruery has a winner here!!!! Kudos"
"Poured from 22oz bottle into wine glass for thanksgiving desert. Pours a hazy burnt orangey amber with a half finger of head. Smell is sweet Belgian malts with a hint of banana and clove. Taste is super sweet Belgian malts with a ton of sugar...almost over sweet but has a good molasses and banana note. Its a good brew just a bit over sweet. Nice looker though..."
""
""
""
"Singed caramel and toasted malt up front. Palate quickly fills up with sweet caramel, molasses, rummy fruits, and pumpkin pie filling. Warming toward the finish. Mulled wine and pumpkin pie spices around the edges. Lingering overripe fruit in the finish. Warming, but not boozy. Medium-full body, with a smooth, lightly carbonated feel. Tasty and a very good beer to pair with Tday dinner!"
"This beer pours a nice brown color with a big tan head. There is a very sweet matly aroma with some potato notes. There is a a full flavor with sweet potato flavor some sweet maple syurp lots of yeasty flavors. Good full flavor more sippable then not. Overall a very interesting beer novel taste very enjoyable worth a try."
""
"Overall, this was a really good beer. The Bruery has made yet another interesting and delicious beer. Very glad that I got to have this beer."
"Not bad. Orangey pale hue, like unripe mango. cloudy with a white head that lingers thin on top of the beer. Belgian yeast comes through first on the nose followed by warming alcohol. there is some sweetness, not so much maple, maybe brown sugar and a strong scent of unripe jackfruit. The taste is pleasant but relatively one dimensional. spicy belgian yeast, some powdery fruit and not much maple or yam, which is what got me excited about this. A little thin and undercarbonated for me. All in all not bad, but somewhat dull."
"O- Didn't someone mention something about maple? Maybe if the yeast hadn't taken over, i'd be able to find more layers to this beer, but after splitting the bottle into two servings, and racking my brain both times, my review remains the same. On the other hand, without the belgian yeast, maybe this brew falls in line with everything else, leaving it boring and passed over. I have never tried a beer that taste so different then it smells. If i were blind folded and asked to name the style of the brew by smell, i would say pumpkin ale, if asked the same question by taste, i would say a farmhouse/saison. This beer is very interesting, not too many brews lately have left me wondering."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a burnt orange/brown with a slight brownish head. Smelled sweet and vegetal like some brown sugar and molasses coated yams. Some alcohol showed itself. Flavor followed suit. A medium bodied mouthfeel, not much life to it. Overall, I enjoyed the beer but not sure I need to try it again."

"O - At 10% ABV this is a serious beer. A bit too sweet for my tastes, but it plays the part of a fruit/vegetable beer well without tasting like a dessert."
""
"Interesting and overall pretty tasty beer. I’ve never been big on pumpkin beers, but this one always caught my eye every year, but I never could pull the trigger as I knew 750ml would be just way too much. With a recent opportunity to purchase a 16oz growler, I couldn’t pass it up."
""

"The body was nicely medium and very smooth. Drinkability was good, but I probably won't have another. Overall, I was a bit unimpressed with this bee, but you may like more than I did. Worth a shot if you see it."

"The taste, perhaps, suffers a bit from the high alcohol content, but having said that, it might be a good idea to grab another one, and hold it for awhile, to let it age."
"Overall: a first the booziness was a little off putting but it's only appears at the tip of the tongue and actually melds very well with this well balanced beer. None of the spices are too aggressive. This makes for a very nice take on the pumpkin beer."
"overall, i didnt realize it was classified as a ""fruit/vegetable"" beer. i suppose it would be. it's not as novelty as some of the others i have tried in this category and the 10% abv makes a statement that it's a serious brew, regardless. and you will begin to feel it on a cooler autumn evening..."
"Overall: Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"O- The flavor is there but it only hangs around the palate just enough to make this a fast sipping beer . Great for the holidays! The spices really accent fall/winter. I can see myself grabbing this a lot for a ham/turkey dinner!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll admit I'm biased against pumpkin beers and I was hoping the substitution of yams might make for a better beer. It doesn't. Not only does this beer have the characteristic cinnamon-clove-nutmeg spice component, but it is exceedingly and unenjoyably sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pleasure to try four years of this unique, tasty brew. Out of the four, the '09 and '11 stand out. As expected, the '09 is the best of the bunch. In the '09, every flavor blends to create a very intriguing fall brew. And of course, the alcohol is completely subdued. That's the issue with the other vintages. Too much burn from the alcohol as well as less-developed flavors. Especially the '12. Way too much booze. But, overall, the spices, yams, molasses, and Belgian yeast all play a part unique to each year. Nothing spectacular, though. Just a well-crafted, enjoyable seasonal brew."

"Pouts a deep brown with a creamy head that lasts. Some lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is boozy with some sweetness mixed in from the maple. Taste is great with thanksgiving flavors coming through via spices, maple syrup and others. Taste is a stronger oktoberfest than others. I really enjoyed the flavor of this beer for a chilly autumn day."
"Very good beer. Bruery is really putting out some unique and tasty beers. This is one of them! I recommend it!"
""
"O: I do like imperial pumpkin ales, and this is reminiscent of them - very autumnal, very seasonally flavored and sweet - truly a good beer"
""
""
""
"O - A very nice alternative to the Southern Tier Pumking I typically have this time of year."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice big beer. If you enjoy sweet potato and all the spices this beer has then this is a must try. I was worried it would be too over the top with everything in it but its balanced well, and all the flavors work well and just add nice flavors. Only thing is this bottle is a bit much to drink by yourself so make sure you split it with someone. The bruey is kind of like the west coast verison of dogfish head, but there beers are very well balanced and there unique flavors work well together. Worth a drink for sure."
""
""
"This was fantastic and unique. The flavor is tremendous. The abv is well hidden. I would give up pumpkin beers in a heartbeat if breweries could make yams this delicious."
"O- Strong take on a Belgian style fall beer. Very flavorful and full bodied."
""
""
"Awesome beer, if you don't like pumpkin beers, this one isn't for you. If you don't like sweet potato pie, then you need to go kill yourself. Seriously, I think I'm gonna go put some whipped cream on this mug."
""
"The body is rich and the carbonation is low. Overall, this is a big beer, worth seeking out."
"A great beer from The Bruery and I'm excited to look for more from them! It's like Fall has been captured in a glass."
"O: I really enjoyed this one. Carried an unpretentious ""home-cooked"" feel that reminded me of holidays past. Definitely a seasonal taste, but one I definitely wanted and appreciated. Gotta grab some more!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yams, brown sugar, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Overall, an interesting beer where the concept seems better than the execution. I wanted to like this beer a lot more than I did. The maple notes are barely there and the yams are lacking as well in my opinion, although I've never had a beer with yams so I don't know how qualified I am to judge that. The spice notes wear thin quickly and don't mesh as well with the base beer as I'd expect. I have another bottle and I think a couple years might really help smooth out the edges....hopefully."
""
""
""
"O: I do not like this beer, I feel like it is not very week rounded, the flavors clash, and the Belgian yeast overwhelms just about everything else.... Deffinatly my least favorite offering from the bruery..."
""
"Overall: I love fall beers and this is one of my favorites. It’s not just pumpkin spices thrown into a brown ale and distributed for the season… it’s carefully crafted to compliment this time of year. Well done."
"Overall content with this brew but it's not my ab fav of the Oktoberfest beverages. Hybrids are a seasonal liking for me. Delicious at first then I get fatigued with the cinnamon, nutmeg, spice thing etc...only until Christmas hit the shelves. :o)"

"Although it's slightly different than a typical pumpkin beer it's enjoyable and a nice sipper when the northern winds tend to send a chill around the globe."
""
""
""
""
"O: for what they're going for, a great effort. This is a beer that you can enjoy at thanksgiving after the turkey, but it's so specific that it limits itself as far as drinkability. I couldn't have it every day or every month for that matter, but I think this will be poured come November."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall the flavor is interesting, but a bomber becomes a bit much to tackle alone, best split amongst a friend or two. Drinkability is a bit uneasy, unless in smaller proportions, warming spicy alcohol bite, dry powdery spicing, not bad overall just a bit challenging to consume by the bomber. Definitely not an everyday brown, it does seem to get better as it warms showing a bit more complexity. Take it for what it is, an interesting concoction best shared with a friend or two during the chilly fall months and pumpkin season."

"original review on: 09-19-2010"
"It seems as though some people are using yams in their fall beers as opposed to pumpkins. I can appreciate that, since I certainly don't need any more pumpkin beers in my life. So whereas using different ingredients is cool, it seems to me like the yams just thicken up the beer as opposed to giving it any broad character that will be more than minutely noticed. If one wanted to be negative, one could say it clogs the beer. But it isn't so much a bad thing. Just making a note of it. So overall here, we get a thick dark Belgian ale that is quite hearty. Which makes for a good fall beer and an excellent alternative to all those stupid pumpkin beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one didn't do it for me at all. Too sweet and the low carbonation only enhanced that. Wasn't a horrible beer, but a drain pour nonetheless because it was too sweet to finish even between 2 people."
"O - I was impressed had it on tap and it seemed like that keg was flat but this second time in the bottle it was able to keep a great carbonation and i can't wait to open more of them in the next upcoming years."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Lots of complex flavors that really come together nicely. I like the maple syrup and the yams and I think they really create a great unique flavor here."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, murky brown with a red tint. One finger fine light brown head with little retention, but some lacing. Aroma dominated by yam, with spices, almost cola-like and faint sweet malt. Interesting flavor of caramel, maple and sweet yam; cinnamon and nutmeg. Finish of caramel malt ending somewhat dry with some tannic elements. Body is medium, somewhat creamy. Somehow this works nicely, this is a tasty autumn ale. Could have been cloying, but the slightly dry finish balances the flavors nicely, althouth the tannins were a bit of an off flavor. Overall, I really liked this beer and will buy annually."
""
""
"O- The well-blended flavors make it a bit mute with the iodine molasses brassy character sticking out and not any real malt character or other flavor to grab on to."
"O - I'm glad I got to try it. I don't usually seek out pumpkin/yam beers, but this was a pleasant surprise. Well done The Bruery!"
""
""
"D-Overall this was a decent beer but i was excepting a lot more from it.. It had a nice nose to it but the flavors did not translate. It was very spicy and peppery and was hard to pick out exact flavors. I would not seek this out again but would prob. drink a glass if offered."

"O - Better than I expected but still not one I would seek out again."
""

"P - The Bruery is one of my favorite breweries to serve to company at a meal. I've found a lot of their beers to be interesting enough to keep the beer enthusiasts at the table happy, but still accessible enough for non-craft beer guests to enjoy. The booze in Autumn Maple can be a bit much, but if you pair it with rich foods the booze can become an asset and you might be surprised to find even novice beer drinkers asking for seconds at the table. Think steak with cream peppercorn sauce, cassoulet, ect."

"I can taste the yams. It’s dry, dry, dry on the finish, bracingly dry, with just a touch of maple and molasses sweetness to balance it out. The 10% alcohol is present throughout, and becomes even more pronounced as it warms. The tartness dies down but I started to pick up an almost chalky flavor—the dry finish didn’t work with the alcoholic booziness that became ever more present. Yams and the malty-smokey-molassas notes become more pronounced as it opens up. It took its time to grow on me, but it didn’t excite or thrill me as I had expected (and hoped it would). To be honest I felt it was a bit of a let down. We’ll see how the second bottle is after another year or so of rest."

"Although a tad boozy, it's extremely complex. Not detecting much of the yam flavors but the maple, molasses and funk come through nicely. Very dry finish that is a perhaps a little over-spiced."
""
""
"Nice blend of spice and malt, a pleasing aroma, and just a hint of booze on the finish. Good overall, although the sweetness became a little much over time and I could have used a little more carbonation to keep things less syrupy."
""
"2010/2011- One of the best, and most unusual fall brews on the market! A really deep blend of spice, fruit, and sweetness! Ages really well considering most pumpkin brews do not."
""
"Despite the shortcomings, the short coming rather, this beer really impresses. I first tried this a couple years ago and walked away impressed, this experience was equally as enjoyable. The aroma is simply beautiful and still the flavor manages to put it to shame. Truly an impressive beer, probably the most enjoyable autumn seasoned beer I have had."

"Overall: Not a pumpkin ale, but shares many similar qualities. Very well-balanced overall. This one would go fantastically with a Thanksgiving dinner. With this one being so enjoyable, I can only imagine how tasty the barrel-aged version must be!"
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer reminds me a lot of bourbon sweet potatoes served at a Thanksgiving dinner. Very sweet, lots of alcohol, a gigantic amount of maple syrup, all with roasted yams buried underneath the flavors. Booze stands in the finish amid a molasses and syrupy belgian style brew. Disappointing, rough to drink. Didn't like the balance between the flavors much. This beer could have improved from a different yeast choice. Also, not a fan of maple syrup…. that turned me off a bit."

"HV"

"Overall, this is very tasty and represents the holiday very nicely. However, I would have liked to taste the yams a bit more and not so much Belgian influence."
"D/O: This is a unique and interesting seasonal brew. Lots of crazy unique flavors, all shining through in a seasonally-appropriate fashion. But it's not terribly drinkable for me. I enjoy it as a unique beer appropriate for the holiday, on rare occassion. I will certainly have this beer again... a year from now."
""
"Overall, a different and interesting beer."
"O: A very interesting beer....not what I was expecting, but it is tasty. As it warms, it has more depth and the esters and dark fruity flavors show through."
"O - I found Autumn Maple to be an interesting and delightful fall seasonal. It's the first beer I've had with yams as a major ingredient and I have to say, I'd like to see more beers with yams in them. The maple and caramel gives it a nice, sweet flavor. A great alternative to the usual pumpkin beers of the season."
""
""
""
"O- A very interesting and well made take on the ""pumpkin"" style. The alcohol is pretty well hidden which adds to the drinkability. Worth trying, especially on a cool fall night."
""
""
""

"O: Not bad, kinda like a big pumpkin beer without the pumpkin. The yams are very dominant unfortunately - not very well balanced. If you don't like yams don't waste your time with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty great for the style as I enjoy this much more than the usual pumpkin beers out there."
""
""
""
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, sticky and coating on the tongue. This is a pretty tasty seasonal beer - I was expecting the 10% to be too much, but it managed to stay out of the way enough so you can taste all of the unique flavors. A bit rich, but definitely something I'd have again."
""
"This borders on being too sweet with the yams, maple and vanilla all being suspects. It does make a decent cold weather warmer but it's not something I could have often as I think it might be a bit too sweet for drinking often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've about given up on finding a pumpkin beer that blows me away. I was hoping this one would but it felt short. I have one left to try and then i might just throw in the towel on pumpkin style beers all together."
""
""
""
""
""
"I must admit, it took me about half the glass to adjust to the yam flavor. It was very odd at first. But this ended up being a pretty damn good beer, and it is definitely unique."
""
""
""
""
"I am not one for pumpkin or spiced beers, so I came with low expectations. With that in mind, this is an OK beer, and definitely one of the best spiced beers I've had. Far too often, the brewer gets a little too spice happy when brewing a beer such as this, so I'm happy to see a little restraint from The Bruery. They didn't restrain themselves too much though, since a quick look at the ABV and ingredient list will clue you in that this is not your normal winter warmer. Good for The Bruery for trying something new and doing it successfully, even if it's not perfect."

"Overall this is a nice beer, feel good about recommending this one as a good, lower priced version, of the barrel-aged AM. Will definitely buy more!"
"Overall: Really just not very good. It had some interesting smells, but the flavor was very unbalanced. Nice try, but something I really didn't enjoy. Plus... it's dang pricey."
"Overall: I would say overall the beer is a bit of a let down I was expecting big bold flavors of the fall and I did not get that. The fall flavors are there but are subtle. Good beer for what it is. Definitely worth a try and I will drink this again"
"Overall a nice beer, but not great. An interesting alternative to pumpkin beers."
"D - Managed to kill a bomber on my own, but the final 8-9 ounces were very difficult to push through. I sort of expected this. It's a good seasonal fall brew and feels far better crafted than many pumpkin offerings, so that's worth something. I guess I'd have like a thicker feel coupled with some sort of barrel effect, so I really ought to check the bourbon version."
"O - super good beer. Dark, thick, sweet and all the fall time flavors you want."
"O. Very good for something different and a nice seasonal treat for a special occasion, not sure I would be having or wanting this too often."
"Overall: A complex brown ale where the spices are there but they are muted at times. Unfortunately this one was a bit of a disappointment. While it is not bad, it just did not have the flavor to justify its price. I did not get any maple taste whatsoever but plenty of sweeter brown ale. I will not be picking this one up again."
"Overall, big on yams, which I enjoyed in the beer despite not liking yams much in real life. Some nice supporting spice aroma which doesn't quite appear enough in the taste to really make the beer come together. Not very much maple either, considering the name. In any case, a nice beer to remind you of Thanksgiving, more so than pumpkin beers."
"O - Not really a pumpkin beer, per se, but still amazing. I can't wait to try the BA and 100% brett versions."
"Overall, a good seasonal ale but I really wish they had limited the amount of sugar that comes through in the taste and mouthfeel."
"Medium-full body with fairly light carbonation. Astounding how well buried the 10% ABV is in this one."
"O - A nice seasonal brew, very glad I tried this. Good for a nice cool fall night. Definitely gets better the longer it is in the glass"
"Try it. You'll like it."
"Not a bad beer, the 10% alc packs a punch, but yeast is a bit overpowering for me and the lack of maple hints were a disappointment"
"D: I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes brown ales. It definitely takes it to another level with yams, spices and generous alcohol. Serve it up at Thanksgiving or keep it to yourself on a nice fall evening."
"O: Really delicious, with lots of interesting flavors bouncing around. Tastes like a mix of green apple pie and pumpkin pie, I really liked it. Would definitely get this again"
"Overall: This is definitely a beer to serve during Thanksgiving. Perhaps as a dessert beer. Extremely sweet almost too much so. I would like to try the oak aged one. i bet that must balance out that sweetness a bit with a nice boozy bourbon kick."
"Off-tap this beer was a cloudy copper color with a head that displayed nice retention and left spots of lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, yams, and spices. The flavors were a bit odd in my opinion, semi-sweet malts, alcohol, light esters, hints of maple and a lot of spices in particular nutmeg that seemed to sit on top of everything else. I didn’t get the subtleties I was hoping for due to this element. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation a little low."
"Overall Impression- Such a strange brew(in the best way possible). Enjoyed greatly and if you can, try it yourself! A great brown ale and perfect for the season. Thanks again ipaking67!"
"Overall, this a nice beer, my favorite beer of the fall season so far. The spices and yams just give this beer an enjoyable complexity, and it truly is a nice beer to enjoy on an autumn night like I did tonight."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and hope to try it from a bottle as well."
"D - Nice fall beer!"
"Very sweet but very smooth, heavy but I love having a few of these each fall"
"Overall a nice slow sipping beer for fall."
"Like comfort food, this is comfort beer. A wonderful Fall seasonal."
"O: This beer is wonderful. As a year round it would be ruined, but as a seasonal it is an absolutely wonderful beer. The temperature is dropping and this beer has the flavor and size to make everything a bit warmer and cozy-er. I would pick up a f of these for some of the colder nights ahead!"
"yams and maple syrup? fantastic! was stoked for this one!!! poured a cloudy maple leaf color with a virbant but fleeting white head. nose is sweet and belgian yeasty, alcohol as well. taste is sweet, tangy, and seasonally appropriate. the maple is faint, but its properties are prominent. sugars, sap, this is a cold day beer. it paired nicely with a tomme brule cheese and a toasted whole wheat loaf. for the price i probably will not buy it again, but a unique take. definitely my first yam beer, to be commended!"
"Taste- Malt, sweetness, nutmeg, alcohol warmth, maple... not much yam taste. The yam is more on the nose than in the taste. This is a great fall beer... a little expensive in my opinion... but definitely a unique beer to seek out."
"Overall, an odd beer but there is certainly room for improvement for this style and I'm just not really a fan of maple based beers, but seriously thanks, as always, to Brian but, unfortunately, I agreed with you on this one."
"4.5 D: I usually find that everything that the Bruery makes that isn't hard to get sucks (less Saison Rue), but this is a damn good beer. It's definitely one of the better pumpkin ales available despite not actually having any pumpkin. Solid all around."
"Verdict: Really lovely fall seasonal from the Bruery, worth searching out. A shame most drinkers wont get to enjoy the full experience of having it on a nice cool autumn day."
"Overall, this is a tasty beer. It really drinks more as a belgian brown (which is its base) than a spiced vegetable beer. I would have liked more maple and yam flavor, but this is a tasty brew that does an excellent job of masking the 10% ABV."
"Once again the Bruery comes through with another fantastic offering. This may be best served in smaller servings, perhaps 4-8 oz pours would be ideal.. Nonetheless, a great autumn beer, and one that should be enjoyed with Thanksgiving dinner."
"O- Wonderful beer, I would definitely try it again. It's one of those sweeter, fruitier beers I wouldn't normally try but my friend had a bottle and gave me a glass. I'm usually more into IIPA's and Stouts but this is really interesting. Definitely worth a try."
"Agreed with the top assessment. This is really a beer for a specialty beer afficianado."
"(O) Fruit/Vegetable beer huh? It was really sweet and big on the syrups. The sweetness in the smell almost lead me to think it was almost had some wild ale aspect."
"Overalll I really like this beer and found it very complex with quite a bit going on inside. Very good as an alternative to the standard pumpkin varieties you see around this time of year. Pick it up if you can still find it. Also says on the bottle you can cellar it for up to 5 years so I picked up another one to try next fall or the one after."
"I guess you either love it or hate it."
"It does not look like Georgia will be getting any of this gem, at least from what I can tell from my vantage point. I have another couple Bruery selections in the cellar now for two years - Rugbrod will be next."
"O- Ehhh don't think this is all my style. I was hoping for a lot more maple syrup, but the yams are a tad too much. Not so much a bad beer, but not a good one. I could see the variations being better perhaps, but I'll never her my hands on them."
"Pours a dark brown in my snifter with a nice one finger cocoa colored head. Good carbonation and excellent lacing on this brew. No light escapes to the other side of the glass. Nose is really great for the style. Yams, nutmeg, cinnamon, maple syrup are the primary players in the smell. This beer is aptly named- it's not a pumpkin ale, but it smells like fall to me. Really well put together, and not overpowering. Unfortunately, the taste doesn't live up to the nose's promise. It's not as well put together, and tastes jump out at you and then disappear. It almost suffers from an identity crisis for me... None of the 10.5% ABV is noticeable at all. Mouthfeel is medium, w/ a light sugary aftertaste. OK, but I'd like it to have some more substance and character. A little too one dimensional. Overall, this is an interesting brew, but it's just not put together quite right. Still, I'm glad I had a chance to try it. Cheers."
"O - This has good drinkability. The flavor is nice, and I wouldn't mind having a few glasses in a night. This is definitely an interesting beer. I like that it takes a bit of a different turn than most other fall seasonals. I recommend giving it a try."
"Brown on top-amber bottom and it is thick-colorwise.It smells extremely boozy and it is at 10% but I gotta say it is improving as it warms especially as a Fall seasonal. They just need to get this thing a little more contained and they could have a real classic."
"O: A rating on this one. Definitely a solid A on this one. Probably the best seasonal/pumpkin/yam beer I have had so far this year. Might actually end it with this one. Can't take anymore..."
"Drink- This was a bit different from what I remembered and its pretty good. I remember some of these flavors before being over powering but this seems to have been mellowed for this bottling."
"D-A little sweet at first, but the spice kind of balances out at the finish. A 12 oz. of this would be doable, but a full 750mL of this one is a little much to put down by yourself."
"Fascinating flavor if you're keeping a life list of peculiar beer flavorings, but not very drinkable. For the right occasion it might be memorable, though. Out of the bottle at Bottlecraft in in Little Italy, San Diego."
"as much as i like this brew i'm glad i had more than one friend to share it with because it may be a bit too for myself. now that i know this one i plan on buying it again so i can better mix it into a session. give this a shot, it may surprise you."
"Overall: This was my go to Thanksgiving week beer, but this year since I have the Brett and Bourbon Bal-aged variants the regular version is serving as a good fall beer. A good take on a pumpkin beer."
"Overall this is quite an odd beer but its pretty good. Tt is a different fall seasonal then the usual pumpkin beers and October fests. Well worth drinking and I think I will pick one up for thanksgiving."
"On tap at burger. in Santa Cruz. Pours a rusty brown color with a creamy egg nog head. Aroma is full of spice and alcohol, dark fruits and pumpkin pie. A little solventy too. Flavor has plenty of garnet yams and brown sugar, some earthy notes, a slightly acetic tartness, pepper, cinnamon. Overall on the sweet side, but it would make a good digestif for sharing. Thick and sweet on the palate, with a light astringency that helps dry it out."
"Full disclosure, I drank a Cigar City Good Gourd quickly after this so I may have killed some of the Bruery's flavors too soon. That said, I remember a perfectly balanced beer, the yam flavor mixed well with the sugar from the molasses. A perfect example of an autumnal beer, not too sweet, not too pumpkin-y. Could have many more of these."
"Overall, I hated it. Enough said. You can't make a bad beer good by adding in more sugar. This is too one dimensional."
"O - A solid if not spectacular fall beer and a nice change of pace from the pumpkin ales. It was interesting to taste the different flavor the yams brought to the table as compared to pumpkin."
"I rounded the mouthfeel up and the overall down."
"EDIT: This ended up being a drain pour :("
"O- strange beer, not really pumped on it. Could be really good but i dont think ""its the right combination shit for a m***er to F***Ed up on""- Kat williams"
"Dr: It's priced decently in Southern California, and carries a hefty ABV but is very drinkable. As a strange take on a pumpkin beer, it works surprisingly well."
"T: Brown sugar and some sweet potato upfront with some cinnamon bread following. A slight hint of hops and belgian yeast on the finish. I wanted a little more from this taste wise. It seemed like it should have been a bit sweeter."
"Move aside pumpkin brews, this autumnal brown ale will pack a yammy for your mouth. Slowly filling, it's hard not to think you're having Thanksgiving dinner putting this one down. In a crowded field of fakey-spiced and weak pumpkin flavored beers, this one is a definite must-try. Better loosen the belt a notch!"
"jd"
"O: Outstanding and this beer aged wonderfully over a year or so"
"O - A fun fall beer that is a good change of pace from all the pumpkin beers. Would like to keep a bottle for the holidays."
"I can appreciate this for it's originality, I've never had a beer quite like this. But this is pretty wacky, and overspiced in my opinion."
"O- This is a solid deconstruction of Fall flavors recombined into a sweet thick and mapley beer. While it has the flavors of fall, I think the combination could be combined and tamed into something better. I want some more savor in my sweetness of fall. Overall I will drinking another one of theses while eating left overs of cold turkey."
"Pours a very dark brown/copper color with a small light brown head which dissipates rather quickly into a fizzy top layer, leaving no lacing behind. Wow. The aroma is really strong on this one. This began with a strong aroma of Belgian yeast and burnt caramel, with hints of allspice and molasses. Oh yeah.... and YAMS. The first sip was quite spicy, with a sweet backend, almost tasted like teriyaki sauce. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice all dominate the flavor up front, but burnt caramel and sweet yams to end It. There is also a very noticeable spice from the alcohol content. Mouthfeel on this is kind of syrupy, while displaying a great amount of carbonation. Just like someone mentioned earlier, kind of a medicinal feel to it. I think this is a great, and creative interpretation on this style of beer. Cheers to The Bruery for keeping it creative and different, while maintaining the high-quality we have come to expect from them."
"Pours a hazy very dark brown with dark red highlights when held to light along with a creamy finger of head. The nose carries Belgian yeast spices, a touch of coconut, sweet caramel maple sweetness along with an earthiness. The taste brings sweetness from the maple along with a chewy richness along with an earthy vegetal quality from the yams. Also it has a very strong belgian yeast taste that I didn't really think worked to well with the other flavors. Abv was slightly noticeable and I didnt find it too drinkable. An interesting autumn brew that I feel would work better with a different yeast strain."
"Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy pumpkin and other spiced beers but I am going to say that this one isn't one of my favorites. I had the pleasure to try the bourbon barrel aged version of this and thought it was out of this world. It just seems the regular version isn't quite what I hoped it would be. As I always say, maybe you want to give it a shot and disregard my experience. Just because I don't like this one a lot doesn't mean you won't. So go out on a limb and try something different and see if this is up your ally."
"O- Not a bad beer but kinda mild.  Rather disappointed. Kinda reminiscent of an English brown with a little sugar and spice thrown in. I had expected a much bolder beer with much more maple and fall flavors."
"For the style, I think this one is nearly perfect. I love this stuff!"
"D = medium drinkability, next time I'd split the bottle. I'm not typically a huge fan of Belgian style ales, but knowing this going in to the beer, it's a nice different take on the style. Definitely can see this as a nice one to sip on a cool autumn night, but not an every day beer for me."
"O-i don't know who had the idea to classify this as a fruit beer, but that person was wrong. this is absolutely a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. its also very, very quick hitting, however a whole bottle is still easy drink with much pleasure."
"Overall: A good beer, ideal for thanksgiving dinner. Autumn in a bottle."
"Fresh bottle from this batch poured into a tulip. The beer pours a very dark reddish brown with a off white / light tan head that dissipates very quickly to a lasting ring with some lacing. Looks great. The smell is a lot like a kriek and very sour smelling, the alcohol is very prevalent on the nose with a light hint of sweet potatos and spice. The taste is very strong of maple brown sugar, sweet potato, nutmeg and other spices. Alcohol is very upfront as well. The mouth feel is sticky with a medicinal burn throughout, a very similar mouthfeel to nyquil. This beer has a lot of good flavors working together to create a nice combonation but are in a battle with the medicinal alcohol taste."
"Got a couple bottles at Whole Foods while picking up a bottle of Marshal Zhukov. This pours a brilliant copper color with about a one-finger crown. This wreaks of autumn. You could damn near let this sit out and use it as potpourri. It's easy to take in the hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, vanilla, and so many other subtly nuanced spices. The taste is very unique. You definitely get the yams. However, it has a very strong clove presence...the same way every beer on earth that's brewed with Belgian yeast has that trademark taste/smell to it. This had a nice mouthfeel to it. Nothing about it was long lasting or lingering except a bit of the clove again. Over all, this was nice. I have one bottle left and plan on hanging on to it until I can see my breath outside. Then it'll be perfect."
"Looks reddish brown with a minimal sudsy white head, little to no lacing. Mouthfeel is fine with the carbonation but suffers somewhat from an excess of boozey hotness that dries everything out in my mouth somewhat too much for my taste. The nose absolutely reeks of cloying yams, maple sap, and pumpkin pie spicing....I am shocked to report that this is the first time I have ever experienced a desire for a de-amplification of the nose in my entire beer-tasting experience. Its a great combo of smells which work together well, but the levels are set so high as to be annoying. Tastes like maple syrup at first, but evolves into MEGA sweet potato pie with a boozey alcohol burn to it. Not exactly my cup of tea, but I can see how it would appeal to others. It just....crams *way* too much yam flavor and scent into my head, when I'm only a lukewarm fan of yams and sweet potatoes. If you go crazy for sweet potatoes, than this beer will be right up your alley."
"O: This is a good one, but I'm sure there are better autumn seasonals than this out there. Still, not a bad brew."
"o: as advertised. Too much spice for me. The booze mixes well with the yam flavor, but not so much the spice. The malty maple sweetness saves this at the end and the unique aftertaste of yam provides a nice treat."
"Overall this is a nice fruit/ vegetable beer, probably better enjoyed in the crisp fall weather, I would prefer a good pumpkin beer over this, however, it is a solid beer."
"O - Overall a pretty big disappointment for me. I will revisit this one when I can let a bottle sit for a couple years and see if the extra age on it helps mellow out the boozy bite."
"O: Just a really solid alternative fall beer. A front runner for a breakfast/brunch brew. The savory over sweet aspects make this a thanksgiving master pairing. Let grandma take a swig. But watch that ABV, and don't let her drive. She'll thank you for it, but she might also ask for a fresher bottle for comparison. I can't help but agree with her. As good as this is, maybe it's even better fresh."
"O: Really interesting and fantastic beer. I would love to have this again and try it either aged or fresh, not being sure which one would do better by it. The flavors in this are really distinct, creative, and interesting. I can't not recommend this beer to everyone."
"Overall is good but for what it's comparing to on the bottle I personally do prefer pumpkin beers (DFH-Southern Tier). Although maybe this is just a whole different kind of beer."
"I like this and would drink it again, probably won't seek it out, at least until next fall."
"Bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy copper amber color with a nice white head. Sweet aroma with a mix of caramel, spice, and pumpkin. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet and a little tart partnered with spice. Caramel and some apple as well. Not bad. Overall, I was surprised at how well I liked this beer. The spice works well with the malty backbone."
"O - I love pumpkin/spice beers so I've been after this one for a while. Its pretty unique since it does use yams over the usual pumpkin, but I wasn't feeling this one. DFH Punkin Ale has really set the bar for me, but I'll give this another shot in the fall when its fresh."
"Overall- I like this beer. I wish the finish was a little longer. I could see myself sipping on this while the leaves change in my favorite month of October!"
"O- pumpkinish beers aren't my favorite, and though this isn't a pumpkin beer, it's got a lot of the same flavors as one. It's not bad, just really powerful"
"A really nice beer for the fall, something to warm you up, and fill with flavors of the holiday season. If I could stock a bottle of this year-round, I definitely would. One of my favorites from The Bruery so far."
"Over all is medium. Not a great beer and high ABV makes for an Oscar Blues substitute."
"Vintage 09 on tap at Tap & Table. I had this from a bottle once before and it's better this time around. The color is a really nice autumn brown and very clear. From the bottle it was cloudy and brown kinda muddy. The spices are really well done in this beer the usuage of yams in the batch is great idea as well. It's slightly sweet but mostly spiced. This beer is awesome for the thanksgiving season! Definitely try it."
"Taste, a nice spin on pumpkin beers, this one is all yam. Well not all, but substantially. Covers the alcohol heat very well, would have guessed 7%, not 10.5%. Never feels like a malt bomb, even though a hop presence is not discernable. Some nutty presence to it. Viscosity was slightly sludgy for style, thought it was kinda cool. Hope this one is a frequent seasonal."
"Poured into a chalice a nice reddish color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/creamy light tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast note, very slight tang, cherries. The taste is malty, alittle yeasty, sweet, cherries. Medium Body. Drinkable, a nice brew, glad to finally get a chance to try it."
"Fairly average really to me... One of the main brews I traded for and at least I know now what it's all about..."
"O: Overall, a good beer and definitely better than most fruit/veggie beers. I'd almost consider it more of an imperial pumpkin ale and it's better than most of those as well. Not too sweet or overloaded with spices, this beer is filling and goes down easily."
"This beer pours an amber brown with decent head. The head stuck around for about half of the party but left its drunk friend, lacing, around a while longer. This beer smells and tastes like a kaleidoscope of spices from my pantry. First off, the predominant smell and taste is freakin' yams, no surprise there. Very strong. You can pick up the Belgian yeast more in the nose than the flavour but that is because of the veritable cluster...party...of spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, lots of brown sugar and molasses. It might be me but I didn't pick up too much of the maple, and I know everything about maple syrup, maple leaves, maple trees, etc... This was an easy enough beer to drink, not too hard, slight alcohol burning. I am pretty sure if you drank more than one though, you'd turn into a drunk turkey. I'd give it a go again, but with a side of cranberry sauce."
"Which is a circus-show. Put up a tent, watch the trapeze artists, guzzle some Autumn Maple! Seriously strange. Not good, but certainly not bad; points for boldness, at least. I'm going to call it decent, but no single adjective, verb, interjection, or gerund could possible describe it."
"D: Served this at dinner when I roasted a turkey and what-not (no it wasn't Thanksgiving). It went extremely well with the meal and could easily have 2-3 bottles of this in one night. Great for the fall or any ""feast"" like meal. Highly recommend."
"D - it was ok for what I consider a 'novelty beer'."
"M/D - Medium-Heavy bodied, a bit syrupy, alcohol is hidden well but burns a little in the finish. Still easy to drink but maybe not one i'd go back to over and over again. Finally nice to try this one."
"Taste is both heavy on the sweetness and spicing. Syrupy even. Yeasty, fruity, bready and doughy with a full body. Lots of character here and makes for an interesting quaff, but I am not a huge fan. ABV is well masked, although it is still a sipper. Not sure how many times I would buy it at 12 bucks a bottle, but fun to try at least once or twice."
"D- Very tasty although the abv was a bit too high for me, you dont get weary from this onslaught of winter flavors. Worth picking up if you see it."
"Great mouthfeel . I am only having have of this bottle tonight. I will re-cork it and finish it tomorrow. Not sure of the ABV but the sweetness of it makes it a sipper and I generally guzzle beer and don't sip it."
"D: The Bruery's approach to the crafting of their Fall pumpkin ale by omitting the pumpkin proves nearly infallible. The result is a delicious beer that compliments holiday dinner perfectly. The disparity in intensity between smell and taste is surprising, yet it may be the only mis-step of note found here."
"Great flavors, but drinkability is hurt by a hefty, nearly cloying sweetness. A good Thanksgiving or Christmas dessert beer."
"D: This was certainly a change from the normal autumn seasonal. However, I'll stick to my pumpkin beers. The yam flavor just doesn't work well in beer"
"This is an interesting, full flavored beer that definitely deserves to be sipped."
"D - Definitely has some autumn flavors to it. Not sure I like the combo with the belgian yeast."
"Poured into a Founders snifter, this beer poured a cloudy burnt red to brown in color with an off white head that laced the glass. This smells like a sweet potato covered in butter, sprinkled with cinnamon fresh out of the oven. I don't even like sweet potatoes but wow, this is perfect for autumn. I wish I would've opened this on Thanksgiving. This tastes like sweet potato pie, and that's the perfect description. It is a little sweet but it's to be expected for what the rest of the beer represents. It drinks smoothly and looks like a Belgian dark and is full bodied. This beer is very drinkable but the sweetness can be a little much. I'm not a fan of yams so I'm glad I split this bottle three ways. It's a good beer and different to say the least. I'm glad I tried it. This beer should definitely be split between friends as more than a third would be a little much."
"I'm rating this in comparison to the other fall/pumpkin beers since the yams are really a replacement for that gourd. Based on that standard, I think this beer does quite well. It's not overly spiced and you can actually taste the yams (whereas many pumpkin beers are designed to mimic pumpkin pie rather than actual pumpkin). Not my favorite style or my favorite example of the style, but it is evocative of the season and is worth a try when the leaves change. A worthy experiment from a forward thinking brewery."
"The mouth is way carbonated, to the point of almost being harsh. This smooths out on the finish though. The maple is also absent in the flavor. I expected this aspect to be more pronounced. Some cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and yeast. Yeast is all over the place. I was instructed to take care pouring this one out to leave the yeast in the bottle, but my best try was a failure I guess. Alcohol is hidden well. One glass was fine enough for me. I don't think I'll revisit this one again. Where's the maple? Where's the yams? I had high hopes, but it left me wanting much more out of it."
"Pours a murky brown with modest sized head that is light tan in color. Nose has mixed holiday spices and some bread-like qualities. More bread on the palate, very Belgian-esque, with a funky fruity flavor and kore holiday spices. Alcohol is hidden well. Moderately easy to drink."
"D - Its a good beer, not my thing, but considering the ABV is drinks fairly well. The smell could really use some boosting, as well as the flavor. This drinks more like a winter warmer than a ""yam"" beer. I respect how nicely the ABV is hidden and how long the foam hangs around for but this was still somewhat dissapointing."
"d- not quite sure why but this wasn't that drinkable for me, i couldn't have more than one glass, i even paired it with food - drank this on Thanksgiving. Okay beer, just not up my alley."
"Overall a disappointing beer but not bad."
"D: An interesting beer. A good one to sip on a cool fall evening."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass an almost crisp dark orange with a decent off white head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is a nice amount of spice alongside dried fruits, molasses and a hint of maple. The taste is sweet brown sugar, spice, burnt caramel, dried fruits and molasses, nice and complex. The beer is medium bodied with fairly well hidden alcohol, great for a cold December day."
"D: This was a very nice unique dark Belgian ale. It had a good scent and flavor, with great body. But it did have a bit of alcohol heat, so it wasn't super easy to drink. Not sure if age would help mellow it out. This was a nice change of pace, but nothing I would drink regularly."
"Dark amber color with some haze--much more haze towards the end. Light tan head. Very malty aroma, yeasty, with hints of sugar and spice. Taste is malty and bready, starchy, dry potatoes. Disappointing in that the maple was not very pronounced. Kind of flat. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Lots of sediment towards the end made the beer very harsh and yeasty. Fair overall... I don't mind some trub in my beer, but the high yeast sediment here killed it towards the last quarter of the bottle, making it almost impossible to finish even with careful pouring, and the maple taste was stale and almost not worth mentioning. Very underwhelming."
"I love the concept and refusal to go with the norm (sounds like something Dogfish Head would have brewed), but the execution needs some work. I need more savory flavors and sweetness from the maple syrup and I need a more pungent/earthy flavor of Belgian Brown (maybe a Flander's Bruine) to counter the sweet/starchy base of maple and yams. Though asking the impossible, a guy can dream- can't he?"
"M/D: Medium to full bodied with perfect carbonation, very crisp. A very well made beer, very tasty and was the perfect beer to have with Thanksgiving. I definitely want to get another bottle for next year!"
"D - This isn't really for me, so the sustainably isn't high. The sweetness limited me to a glass, and the other two guys I split a bottle with didn't want any extra after their first pours."
"Overall this is a nice take on the Pumpkin ale, Autumn ale style. Normally beers this high is ABV have questionable drinkability because they are too slick and cloying but this is simple and pleasant on the palate."
"This is a great follow up to the traditional pumpkin ale at the Thanksgiving table. A very clear garnet brown with a decent light khaki head. Light to moderate lacing on the glass after a quick fade. There is some stickiness apparent in the liquid. A deep rich nose full of sweet malts and Belgian yeast. The yams add a thick layer of decadence to the dark breads and malt. Banana is enhanced by them. Dark fruits are sitting on top of them. This is so pleasing to my nose I could smell it for days and still want more. A bit of earth balances the thick sweet breadiness, a light touch of alcohol adds a flourish. Taste is in line with the nose. Dark fruits and large slices of sweet brown bread in the front. Some notes of maple syrup. Earthy mellow hops to balance and bitter the finish. Complex spiciness that makes you wonder if it is spice or the basics. The usual holiday bouquet is here but is so well integrated you just enjoy it without focusing on it. Feel is supple with a light syrup consistency. Moderate carbonation is spot on and just a bit short of creamy when fresh poured. After a bit of time however the bubbles take on a gentle personality and add just enough movement to keep the beer from getting heavy. A nice experience overall on balance. Drinkability is surprising for a BSDA. This went down like a lager almost and with good food a real winner. A great beer for the holiday table as well as anytime Belgian dark urgings. Really good stuff here."
"D- Tough to get through the full pint. Actually tossed a little bit in with my chicken to see if I could get any real pleasure out of this brew. To fruity, and sugary for this guy."
"1 1/2 fingers of tan head, medium dissipation with not a lot of lacing. Nose is pretty complex, molasses, vanilla, nutmeg fairly noticeable, I had a hard time picking up any cinnamon notes. Taste is equally complex, sweetish up front, blackstrap molasses, grade A (light) maple syrup, with the above spice profile. I don't really know what the yams are supposed to add, imagine it adds to the sweetness. Medium mouthfeel, light for the style, light on effervescence, a bit sticky. ABV fairly noticeable, hidden by the sweetness, but not sure I'd want to have more than a glass of this. Could do some interesting holiday food pairings with this. Worth a try."
"Drinkability - I found myself coming back to this growler after the first glass. Drinking this cold seems to improve this offering, as this adds to keeping the CO2 in solution longer. A sipper? Sure. The ABV is high enough."
"D= Tasted pretty good but the heaviness and the abv combine to make this a one and done offering. Would make an excellent beer to cook with...possibly next Thanksgiving!"
"Drinkability -- While Autumn Maple isn't a bad beer, it's by no means a great BSDA. Certainly interesting, a big hit with the family on Thanksgiving, but not something I'll be awaiting eagerly next Fall."
"D - Interesting, unique brew that worked well at Thanksgiving, but I'm not sure if I'd get it at any other time."
"As far as a pairing with Thanksgiving, it was a very good call. It was especially good with the baked sweet potatoes."
"Drinkability - A sipper for sure, but damn appropriate on Thanksgiving. I get almost no alcohol heat or burn from the beer and it is a great pre-dinner holiday beer. Really glad I brought this along to try today."
"Drinkability is above average, thanks to the interesting flavor and smell. The mouthfeel could stand to be a bit less drying, but other than that, I don't really have any complaints. A solid brew from the Bruery."
"Good mouthfeel with its medium-sized body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is also good. The beer was very interesting and unique; something I've never tried before in a beer, especially with the utilization of the yams instead of pumpkins. Definitely gave off a Thanksgiving feel to me while this was being consumed. Worth a consideration for the holiday."
"D - Despite the huge 10.5% ABV, I will give this an above average. It has made me re-think my position on fruit/vegetables in brewing. Very well done!"
"Value: At $10.99, well worth it. The Bruery hits another homerun."
"UPDATE: I had a sample of this on tap recently with appropriate carbonation. Wow. The carbonation brought all the flavors up front and was a far superior beer than the one I reviewed."
"overall: this thing is a very strange and wonderful beer I was not expecting what I got"
"Although it's pricey, I'm glad I picked up two bottles. I'll save the other one for a month or two."
"D: This is a fantastic beer, especially when it warms up so that all the phenolic goodness is there. Wonderful sipper and one of the better Belgian-style brews I've tried, despite it being a domestic brewery."
"D - This unique autumnal seasonal is a challenge even for the experience BA... Not something I would drink on a regular basis, but enjoyable none the less... I have to give extra points for creativity even though it doesn't add much to the overall offering..."
"Served from tap into a snifter. Poured dark brown with a subtle red hue with a one finger light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, and a slight sour note. The flavor was of sweet malt, slight sour, nutmeg, and slight burnt malt after swallowing. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this one was pretty good. Probably one of my favorite seasonals I've had this year thus far. Very nice aroma going on here with a nice complex flavor to follow it up. A definite must try."
"The hot boozy feel severely limits the drinkability. The yams and maple syrup are an interesting attempt at the style, but also get tiresome before my first glass is over."
"Poured a dark brownish red with a half finger of head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. In the aroma you could definitely spot out the yams along with the nutmeg, spice, and belgian style yeast notes. There alaso seemed to be traces of cinnamon as well. Upfront on the palate the yams come busting thru the door with caramel, nutmeg, and spice accents but also has the slight belgian yeast characteristics. The brew was medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, spice, and sticky finish.it drank pretty good and is a solid offering but I also like the different variations of it like the BA version."
"Cheers.."
"D: Awful. On one hand the alcohol was very well hidden, but the flavors are just so crushing that I couldn't finish more than 4-6 oz before I had to hand off the bottle to a friend, who had less than that before handing it off to the drain."
"I can say I've never had a beer like this. It is really good for what it is trying to do, so I will give it props with a solid Drinkability score."
" Would like to try the barrel aged version of this."
"Nice. Interesting. Massive yam taste but pleasant."
"Thanks to jdiddy for sharing this one. Served in a tulip. Pours an auburn/cider color with a swirl of foam and a band around the edges. Nose suggests bubblegum and toasted malt. Taste consistent with nose; however, the flavor profile really opens up revealing an herbal, belgian yeast quality, as well as candied yams towards the middle and a touch of maple, nutmeg and allspice. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation level that is slightly more assertive than optimal for the beer and the style. A really solid fall beer. Quite tasty; however, best shared in small amounts amongst 5 or 6 people. Would make a great Thanksgiving dinner digestif."
"Pretty tasty and drinkable, especially for style. If I had a complaint, it would probably be that this beer does not taste quite as exciting as the ingredients might lead you to think it would. Still, it is a well made beer with some great flavors, and for that I tip my hat in the Bruery's general direction."
"A medium-heavy bodied deep clear amber brew with a highly sweet aroma. On the top end the flavor is fairly sweet, with some alcohol on the nose. The aftertaste may be more interesting with this one - going from sugary sweet and spice to roasty malts to a bittering hop finish. Makes one want another sip. A strange, but interesting brew. The ABV catches up with the head quickly though."
"D: I couldn't imagine having much more than a glass of this stuff. A lot of my friends bag on it by saying it's unbalanced, a bad Harvest brew, etc. I like it and think it fits in line with many other wonderful offerings by The Bruery."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter. The pour is a deep, murky amber with a slight white head. The aroma is very spicy and pumpkin pie like, cloves, cinamon, nutmeg. It starts sweet finishes sweet. Lots of clove and pumpkin pie spices going around. Full in body, light carbonation and it has very well hidden ABV. Too sweet for me, interesting beer, just not for me."
"-i give the drinkability a pretty high score for the fact that it is my favorite ""halloween"" beer in a style i roughly hate. this i can drink though"
"Medium to full bodied. Somewhat creamy. There is a cloyingly sweet aftertaste. I am surprised that the alcohol is so well disguised, especially for being 10.5%. Other than the alcohol being well disguised, this beer is a mess."
"a beer brewed on a ubiquitous amount of squash. an extremely decadent pumpkin fashioned beer with not much of a range in flavor but a very nice more for a ten recent beer. A really nice earth that seems to sit in the wood of the cask and the dirt sweet blends well with the nutmeg. This is an american beer. More so an imperial vegatable beer than anything belgian. A tad boozy but it could be much worse. Not overly sweet but has a lack luster feel as it lacks density in both yeast protein and malt."
"D: Here's the thing, most fall seasonal veg beers sell it way too much on the spice. You end up with a flat pumpkin pie sort of taste, heavy on all the pumpkin pie trimmings, light on the pumpkin (Pumpking, Dogfish Head Punkin being the 2 most notable exceptions to my memory). The Bruary here decided to go for the throat of fall food. Earthy, thick, starchy, sweet veggies. And they nailed it. There is just enough spice to season the yam properly, but the focus is on the flavors of the yam itself, not the spice. Very, Very nice."
"Easy to drink but the spices do get a little overwhelming about 75% of the way through"
"Best meal choice to accompany this beer? Pancakes, perhaps. The main thrust of this beer is a distinctive sugary malt, with caramel, brown sugar and some spicing thrown in for good measure, along with some Belgian yeast phenols. A touch boozy toward the end, with a lasting bittersweet finish."
"Pours an almost-brown, red color with a medium white head. The scent is blasting with caramel, holiday spices, sweet yams, and brown sugar. The smell is very inviting. Taste does not disappoint. A very distinct maple syrup taste with strong hints of brown sugar and cooked yams. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and syrupy, but still very drinkable. I'm not the biggest fan of pumpkin ales or brown ales, but this beer was a real treat."
"D: None of us cared for it; it's not offensive, just ""there."" I could have finished it, but I wasn't excited enough to do so. Most of the bottle went down the drain so we could move to something else. I think I'm just not in the target market for this heavy sipper; won't buy again."
"I don't know why but I love this beer. Pours rich copper color, one finger white head, a small amount of lacing. Slightly opaque. Aroma is faint but I pick up spices, squash, light yeast aroma and yup maple syrup. Flavor is spicy, and yammy a little vanilla. Nice malt backbone. No real hop charecter to speak of. Yeah its a little cloying, and a bit warm from the alcohol. On a cool autumn night this stuff rocks, there is no other time for it."
"D - Not really."
"Smooth, soft, rounded, and tender medium body. Slightly creamy with a small push to some carbonation and warmth, but nothing overwhelming. Great overall breath of texture to it. Tenderly breadish, smooth, soft, and creamy. Yum! The 10% is somewhat hinted at and felt with some late warming attributes, but it doesn't hamper its tone of flavors, body, or drinkability. As it's gone quite quickly due to its quaffable quenching quickness. Excellent Autumnal spirit and core from The Bruery with this one. Yum again I say! Yum!"
"This beer is a meal in itself. Share this one with friends!"
"Overall, a pretty good brew and perfect for the fall months!"
"I think this will age v. nicely"
"DB- A mix of good Autumn flavors with a strong Belgian yeast flavor. Very strong to me, but nice and seasonal. Better than most autumn ales."
"D: this is a slow sipper with its big ABV, I am a bit disappointed as I was hoping for a much more festive/autumn type beer. All I really got out of it was a big boozy spiced up BSDA. I would not purchase this again."
"Very unique ""Belgian Brown"" take on a spiced pumpkin beer - definitely worth a try if you like these sort of seasonals."
"A great alternative to the many pumpkin ales available this time of year, and one of the most unique and memorable brews I've had all year. As the label notes, this is indeed perfect for chilly autumn nights. It's potent, but one that works best taken in with patience. I found the complexity impressive, although the syrupy sweetness/spiciness wore thin just a little too quickly. I stand back looking at it from more of a distance than I'd like, but with the utmost respect. Would pair extremely well with the Thanksgiving meal."
"I figured this would par nicely with the Wisconsin evening during Man's Weekend, and I don't think I was proven very wrong. It pours a hazy dark garnet topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose, as many in the room said, elicits memories of Thanksgiving dinners past: candied yams, sweet potatoes, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, candi sugar, and Belgian yeast. Only the last couple (especially the yeast) were absent from my past November meals. The taste isn't as delectable, but still holds notes of maple syrup, orange zest, ginger, banana, clove, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel apple. This ain't as much of a meal, but still sits nicely in the tummy. The body is a light-ish medium, with a moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a great brew, one I was more than happy to share with my buddies after a long day o' fishin'."
"I shall continue for every bottle to thank our provider, TMoney2591 for the NMW beer. This one pours a nice cloudy darker red color the smell is of pumpkin or sweet potato and there is plenty of clove to go around as well. In addition the finer notes seem to me to be orange zest and grapefruit (probably from the hop aroma). The taste is of Thanksgiving. There's sweet potatoes, brown sugar, and citrus zest. There is a distinct syrupy boozy taste to it as well which some may claim can go with Thanksgiving as well. It's reasonably smooth and drinkable in the right settings, i.e. late November."
"D - It's a sipper and it's interesting but it's a brew I'd really have to be in the mood for. The alcohol doesn't really show through at all which is really good but I'm not all that fond of it personally. Maybe after a year it could be awesome."
"Tasted with a dinner of Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin and Sweet Potatoes. Good beer. I plan to buy several bottles. Paired very well with the sweet potatoes and tenderloin."
"medium-bodied, medium to low on the carbonation. this is one of those beers that is definitely a unique and tasty take on the style, yet the sweetness of it reins in its drinkability. that said, IMO this is a great autumn BSDA that i'll be looking to buy again - maybe when the leaves start falling."
"D- at no time can you feel the abv till your liver processes it. A fabulous brew a little different for the style but great all the same."
"D-Overall, a bit of a letdown. I was looking forward to a big maple, yam, Belgian pumpkinfest and got a leftover caramel apple. Oh well. Not a bad beer by any means, and I will approach the other bottle in the cellar with tempered expectations."
"M- Sharply carbonated. Finishes spicy with a moderate dryness. Alcohol is felt, but only slightly."
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is very nice, but it is very strong. I get a ton of sweet potatoes as well as some assorted spices which include nutmeg and brown sugar. The flavor is more yams, brown sugar, alcohol, nutmeg and cinnamon. The yams come off very similar to pumpkins, making this beer taste like a top-notch pumpkin ale. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I love the use of yams in the beer. Very creative and very well done."
"Not the best beer The Bruery has ever made but it's a nice twist on an Autumn seasonal. I just wish the yam flavor would pop a little more because that is a very unique and seldom used ingredient in beers."
"I was expecting something else. This is a big alcohol bomb with some maple and sweet potato flavors, but not enough to keep it interesting for me. Doesn't need to be 10%. At all."
"750ml/tulip - pours a beautiful dark amber red, with a generous 2inch off white head, which dissipates somewhat fast. nice lacing on this one, creeps down the glass. Aroma - Metallic, brown sugar, dirt. Tastes of sweet maple, mild spiciness, and dark fruits, very unique and hides the 10% abv amazingly. very smooth over the palate, 0 alcohol burn, very little carbonation, a nice sweet malty finish. Overall this beer is surprisingly light bodied and very drinkable. this could get dangerous...."
"D: This brew has a very boozy taste and is very sweet, therefore I couldn't see myself having more than one regardless of the 10.5% ABV. Overall this is a pretty good beer and I feel aging would do this beer very well."
"Overall, I loves me some Autumn Maple, considering it's very similar to drinking a Trois Pistoles or Maudite but with a higher sugary content, and of course the spicy, yammy goodness present throughout. Very much a dessert beer that's rich in flavors, but, surprisingly I could drink at least two of these per session."
"Overall- This is a well crafted brew, with alot of different flavors going on, but nothing ever over powering the next. Fairly boozy as it warms, it should mellow out with some aging."
"Pours mahogany, with little head retention or lacing. Smells of maple and spice. Malty, almost apple-y flavor. Maple in the aftertaste. Taste is immediately a tempered malt sweet with what I would describe as pumpkin pie spice. The Maple flavor weaves itself in through the secondary part of the flavor profile, and sticks around till the end where both aspects are well balanced. Alcohol is not apparent until it warms up."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a murky copper/brown color with some tints of ruby red, and has about an inch and a half tan head. Head retention is decent, but not much lacing at all. Aroma is molasses, yams, and sweet spices. It tastes mostly like spices, candied yams, and some molasses along with a little bit of maple. I do think this brew is spiced too much for my liking as the spices seem to overpower the other flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it certainly goes down good enough. I think it's a solid beer, but I also thought I would like this one a lot more than I did. With that being said it's certainly worth a try, and I would try this again in the future."
"d - An interesting beer I was glad to try. Some nice spices, maple, and fruit in the smell and taste. Would give another shot."
"A fruity pear entry, oily, medium bodied, with pronounced alcohol heat signaling the entry to the finish. Medium carbonation and decently balanced. Spicy hop flavor, a tad earthy, all starting with a Belgian candi-sugar entry. Sadly this beer is just too hot fresh as it noticeably hinders drinkability."
"Drinkability: While this may look a little lower compared to the rest of the numbers, I assure you it's only because of the higher ABV -- this is really an outstanding beer and I'll be picking up one to age."
"Drinkability:This makes a great dessert beer with very complex flavors."
"Overall, this brew says its a Belgium Brown Ale, BA classifies it as a BSDA, but I'm saying this brew happens to look and drink like a Belgium Dubbel. With a more hefty mouth feel,I'd definitely bump up the scores."
"Bottle, thanks to HogtownHarry. Aroma of maple, wood, yams and cinnamon. Similar to whiskey. Flavor is wood, molasses, somewhat tart, with a maple finish . Palate is creamy with lively carbonation. Very flavourfull and aromatic but could they could be more integrated. Still interesting, enjoyable and unique."
"I simply wanted to love this beer. Sadly it will probably never be bought by me again."
"I liked this beer, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. Poured a ruddy dark brown with some tan head that receded quickly. Nose is good, can definitely pull out the yams, the spice, and some darker malt. Like a rye pumpkin bread if that makes any sense? The taste follows through with similar notes, but also with an accompanying sweetness from the molasses. Belgian yeast notes are apparent as well. Mouthfeel could use a little less carbonation and a little more body, IMO. A good sipper, definitely reminiscent of fall. Not a bad beer, thought it was a steal for $7."
"I found this most delicious as a beer to enjoyed in the fall as a an alternative to pumpkin brews which I do not enjoy. Nice dark caramel and molasses notes with a well done mild dash of spice. This molasses fwd brown ale with a dash of Thanksgiving spice."
"Nice beer. poured a dark brown, not black. Nice head retention. No overly sweet and good use of maple. We paired this with some Leige waffles with chocolate drizzle. Very good belgian strong dark ale."
"An excellent beer for the season. Would go great with thanksgiving."
"I would bet that this will also age well in the cellar, but probably only for a couple years. Its balance and spice makes it perfect for food pairings. Try roasted chicken or turkey, cheese plates, tomato pastas, shrimp, and BBQ."
"Interesting beer that really is different than others."
"D: This is a damn fine beer, well balanced, bold, and bursting with complex flavours which are perfect for the season. The only thing that MIGHT hold it back is the very seasonal nature of it. To me, it's a Thanksgiving beer and anything beyond that wouldn't be quite right."
"D: This is a really nice beer to enjoy a glass of when it starts getting a little cooler out (though that won't happen for some time here in Southern California). I always look forward to this beer."
"D - Decent. A really nice brew that I can take in small servings, but it's not my favorite style. I'm gonna give it a few extra points, though, because this is my girlfriends favorite beer, she can (and has) easily put an entire bottle away by her lonesome. Thanks, Bruery ;)"
"D: Flavorful and interesting. Strange balance that took me all the way to the finish."
"Found these notes on my old iPhone from last fall, and decided no time like the present. Do I like this beer? I do. It fits in well for the season, and it might even go well on a short stack. That said, the sweetness and overall busy personality keep it in place for an occasional indulgence as opposed to a go-to dependable. Also, the bold ABV is present and pushy, perhaps more so than I'd want in conjunction with the spinning flavor wheel in place. Yes, I'd drink another, but just one, and then, sparingly."
"O-One of the better Autumn seasonal releases."
"I've been disappointed several times searching for a good autumn seasonal ale. This one fills the bill nicely. While it's definitely a niche beer those who like this sort of thing will be rewarded. Next fall, I'll be popping the cork on more of these."
"Pours a rather murky, muddy medium brown color, with a little bit of brownish foam. Aromas of maple, candied yams and pumpkin spices. This one tastes like Thanksgiving dinner in a bottle--more yams, sweet potato pie, pecan, brown sugar and maple syrup. A pretty solid offering, but not one I'd drink a lot of ."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy brown/amber color with a ton of yeast left in bottle. Nose is maple syrup. Flavor is sweet maple syrup, malts, spices, hints of yam and alcohol. Not cloying. Pricey at $12.45 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. the spice and funk is well balanced and mixes well against the base beer. i'm generally not fond of spiced brews, but rather enjoyed this one."
"This bottle is worth finishing, but with so many superior versions of this style, this is realy just a curiosity. When looking for a sipping beer, avoid this one, as the aroma is a turn-off, and certainly holds back the flavors as well."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation. ABV is well hidden. Not bad, but doesn't hang with the rest of these."
"This is worth trying, though not my favourite of the Bruery beers."
"Good, but not as complex as their other stuff and outclassed by its barrel-aged brother. Sits uneasily in this category. Glad I tried it, but there's way better to come."
"D - Interesting and different. Overall I like this beer, but the spices are a bit much to have a lot of...split this bottle and this made it the perfect amount in a session. Definitely would go for this again, in moderation...maybe sided by side with the BA version I have in my cellar next time."
"Pours medium murky hazely brown, with a great looking lighter hazel head. Really looks good in this glass. Smells belgiany with everything the label promises. The spices dominate the smell with the smell of what must be yams in there too. Taste again is exactly as promised. Maple, molasses, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, nutmeg etc.), and what has to be yam all with a distinctive belgian strong dark ale backbone. No flavor dominates in an unpleasant way. A very complex sipper as you work through the layers of flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some warmth. Surprisingly I was able to finish the bottle on my own throughout the course of cooking and eating dinner."
"My tastes are slightly different from the average beer connoisseur but I would drink Fall brews all year long. This fine brew has good carbonation, nice body and is very drinkable. I brewed a strong pumpkin ale that this comes very close to in flavor. Will be looking forward to stocking up on these next fall."
"(D)- A very interesting & unique brew that really suits the fall & early winter season. The yams used instead of pumpkin creates a nice rustic feel to the beer. Full-bodied & rich. Tons of flavor; alot more than your average brown ale/pumpkin beer. My new personal favorite for the fall season. . . now if I can just acquire more of this somehow. The only thing that bothers me is that this is under the Belgain Strong Dark category. . . doesnt fit it really at all."
"Body is medium, carbonation is a little on the high side. A little too sweet to be highly drinkable, but it's sippable and I wouldn't at all mind giving it another try. It's similar to Ommegang Adoration, but not quite as good."
"Poured lovely deep mahogany with a bit of off-white head. Sweet, light brown sugar, lots of caramel. Well spiced, like Christmas yams but without the nasty yam flavor. Little bit of cinnamon or allspice with some marshmallows. A dose of sweet maple in the finish. Very good, I will consider this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's pretty smooth and drinkable for the abv %. It's one of the better spiced beers I have had, but I probably won't be drinking it often. It was great to try, very interesting and a very nicely made beer, it's just not a style I enjoy that often."
"overall to much vegetable for me."
"Drinkaiblity is pretty high. Very enjoyable flavors with a little sharpness from the alcohol."
"Overall, this is my first brew from The Bruery and I think it is well done for an autumn ale / Belgian. The bottle says you can age this up to 5 years, so if I see a bottle next year I'll probably pick it up and put a few years on it. Go check it out when it's in season."
"75cl bottle. Lightly hazy brown-red with a medium off-white head. Lots of spice and some alcohol in the aroma, with nutmeg and sweet potato standing out. The flavor is sweet and spicy with a boozy kick in the back and a dry finish. I'm going to have to say that this has breached the upper limit of pumpkin (yam) ale. The alcohol is just a little to dominant in the flavor profile, with some complimenting maple and spice. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Nice, but a little to ambitious."
"Poured into a Harpoon tulip, formed a 1 1/2"" tan head over the clear dark copper brew. Head falls slowly, with random chunky lacing. Aroma is yams and spices. Taste is somewhat harsh upfront, spices in the middle, and the alcohol and yams come together in the close. Lingering afterburn warmth. Mouthfeel is rough for me, not smooth at all, and drinkability is okay. Not as good as I had hoped."
"D- Decent drinkability, just not enough carbonation, needs some time for the alcohol to mellow down."
"Hazy, tawny amber with a thick beige cap that was quick to settle. Not much in the way of lacing. Interesting aroma of sweet gourd, yam, or pumpkin, some bread, and mild spicing (cinnamon, cloves, allspice), plus faint alcohol as it warmed. Mild bitterness with the same sweetness as in the aroma. Raisins and dried fruit, brown sugar, and lingering spices. Medium to full bodied with smooth, fine carbonation and light warmth. Pretty good, sort of like a super pumpkin ale."
"drinkability: a little hindered by strength"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Nice creamy beginning to this beer. It goes down smooth and balances all of the flavors that are in it. Very good brew."
"D: Pretty good winter brew but the ABV will get you. I shared this with family on Christmas Eve and probably would have trouble drinking more than a glass."
"D. This was great with food. the peppercorn's spiciness was well balanced by the sweetness of the beer. I don't think that i could drink two of these in one sitting because of the overall flavors becoming more overwhelming as the beer warms towards room temp."
"Wow! This was one of my top beers for 2009. I was really hoping for something big, malty, and sweet. This delivered. The candied yam and maple taste covered the alcohol pretty well. That's why this could be a dangerous beer if you're not careful. I would have liked to have had this on tap. I will def have to try the other Bruery beers that are available in the Chucktown area."
"Drinkability stretches as far as your taste for the spice flavor. I read in someone eles's review that they drank it with Thanksgiving dinner, and that sounds perfect."
"the appearance was great, let me explain it had a transparencey of orange and brown, I could see the carbonation, I was drinking it from a Duvel tulip glass, the smell was great i could smell the sweet syrup and yams. the taste was clear almost not heavy in which the ingredients indicate. Mouthfeel was great i could take slow sips, i could savor the flavor. the drinkability was not heavy on the stomach, enjoy."
"the drinkability is good in the respect that the alcohol is well hidden, and there are some really nice complexities, but it's a tad too sweet and tangy to get a solid 4.0 in that category. overall all though, a very nice effort by the brueryy, they've introduced something new and most welcome to the fall seasonal category. a good after dinner sipper, might even go well with the right dinner."
"D - Great quaff, but cannot drink a whole bottle if I wanted too. It's just too rich."
"NOTE: Having this side by side with BA Autumn Maple I really think this one is better. There's more subtlety to it, but I'll get into that in my review of the BA version."
"d- probably one of the fav holiday beers very complex and all the flavors go great together"
"D: Fairly easy to drink, definitely a dessert beer, could sub for pie really. Tasty and a beer I'll look forward to each fall. This beer would be an excellent gateway beer. It tastes like straight up pumpkin pie, and that would go over well with just about anyone."
"My 750 ml bottle unleashes a dark brown torrent. Carbonation roars skyward in a mushroom cloud of foam--then crashes down and disappears before I can jot a note about its creamy, off-white color (I have a good memory). So where's the head? Did someone slip Diet Coke into my beer bottle again? A sniff reveals maple syrup. My first sip finds more maple syrup chased by sweet potatoes, brown sugar, and spicy Belgian yeast. Its body is light with cola-like carbonation. An intensely sweet brew, but aside from that, there's not a ton going on here. The flavors don't kick you in the teeth and shout ""taste it!"" the way a Chimay Blue or De Dolle Oerbier does. Autumn Maple simply didn't linger long on my palate."
"Uncapped and poured into my trusty Duvel tulip glass. The ale appears a mildly murky crimson chestnut color with about two fingers of fizzy, quickly fading ecru foam. A nice looking pour. The flavors and aromas are of cinnamon, nutmeg, a pungent bitterness that I'm guessing is coming from the molasses, a good amount of maple sweetness, banana taffy notes, spicy cracked black pepper, caramel, roasted sweet potatoes/yams, belgian yeast. Medium bodied and I'm glad to see the carbonation problem that plagued last years release has been resolved. This ale is quite effervescent and the spiciness from the pepper and/or yeast lingers well after each sip. The alcohol is well hidden as well. Overall, this is something I'll look forward to each fall. Put me down for a bottle next year."
"EDIT: I had a very hard time finishing this beer. I shared some with friends and still could hardly finish this."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Would compliment a Thanksgiving dinner very well. If you like a lot of flavors bouncing around your pallate, then you might enjoy this one."
"Overall this was certainly an interesting experience and a pleasant autumn treat. There was just something about it that seems a little off and perhaps unbalanced/unrefined, but as this was my first occasion with Autumn Maple, I will see what another bottle brings. Recommended."
"Drinkability - I rarely say this, but I would dissuade anybody into devouring a 750ml on their own. For me, this is an exclusive moment to where a compartmented pour is doubtlessly most ideal for a serving. The old saying of ""less is more", couldn't be more true!"
"This is a flavorful, rich beer. Drinkablity is high, but the booziness makes it a sipper. Goes well with multiple foods. I had it with Thanksgiving dinner, and it went well with roasted turkey, sweet potatoes, and cranberries."
"Pours a mahogany with an off-white froth and decent lacing. The nose is soft and complex with aromas of Belgian yeast, Yams/pumpkin, molasses, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, dark fruit, slight funk, & a slight tart character. The flavors cover everything listed above with a slightly tart finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly dry with some weight and a long finish. Overall, this is an amazing beer that I was happy to have last Thanksgiving, thrilled to have this Thanksgiving, and look forward to having at my next. An absolute must try!"
"Pours a beautiful dark orange with a nice white billowy head. It smells spicy with a touch of yams and alcohol. The flavor is spicy and dominated by alcohol. I could detect some yam flavor, especially when it warmed up. It has a nice flavor, but it seemed hotter than other beers. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The drinkability suffers somewhat to me due to booziness of this beer. Don't get me wrong I think this is a very good beer and it didn't disappoint, but the alcohol was a little too much for me. I would recommend this beer and I hope to try other beers from The Bruery sometime soon."
"The pour is very attractive, crimson in color with excellent clarity. A thin, tan head rises briefly, receding to a disk. The nose really is a melange of rich sweetness and spices, with cinnamon and nutmeg being quite prominent. Molasses and maple syrup are apparent, but the yam character is rather whelmed by the high level of spices. Yeast character is present, but again, plays second fiddle to the spices. The palate opens with a rich sweetness with brown sugar, vanilla and maple syrup with a definite molasses component. The spices really dominate the mid-palate and the finish, big and prominent. The yams aren't particularly noticeable Drying on the finish with a touch of alcohol, this medium-bodied beer is quite perfectly carbonated, it's soft and smooth on the palate. I drank about 8oz of this beer, and could have consumed more, but it's a beer I will drink about once a year."
"Overall, this is a nice sipper for a cold fall evening. A bit of complexity, if not the most well-rounded flavor. They definately capture the essence of fall, though. A good job."
"D - The drinkability is good, and the sweet potato fragrance and taste goes well with the brown, nice sweet flavors to balance the spices and the drinkability while good, is not the type of ale I would be interested in drinking more than 1 of really not beneficial given the strength"
"The Bruery has a nice fall beer here. It's certainly something that could be built upon and improved. I don't have any real problems with the flavor. It's good. But, the alcohol taste is too strong and a little warm. More bubbles all around would help, too. At the end of the day, I like Autumn Maple. It's certainly worth checking out. With that said, it needs a couple of tweaks. I suspect this release is a tad better than last year's due to the carbonation issue. Keep working on it, guys. You're getting there."
"An interesting brew with interesting ingredients that work well with the ""Belgian-esque"" character. Creative, and enjoyable as a unique autumn brew."
"Not a bad beer. A different take on fall beer compared to all the other pumpkin ales, but I think it misses the mark."
"D: 750 ml bottle is good for 2-3 people easily. I'm glad I tried this, but I probably won't get it again, as there are so many top notch Belgian ales and spiced autumn & winter seasonals that I enjoy much more."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body, but a full flavor. Mild carbonation and very smooth. Very easy to drink"
"Drinkability is OK, although it's honestly a bit disappointing. I don't know if it's aged pourly or if it was too late in the night when I had it the first time, but I've got 4 more, so I hope it improves! Right now it just tastes a bit to heavy and sharply flavored."
"F: Still finishes a little sweet, I was hoping it would dry out a little more as I have to go through the whole 750ml by myself. It adds more of the rich creamy roasted malt and toffee flavors at the end as well. A little more molasses and maple flavor linger a bit, but not too long. A couple burps bring back only maple flavor. It's pretty bright as well on the finish. A little more alcohol spice and warmth. I think I'm starting to get some spice and vanilla long after the swallow. Spice such as nutmeg, and a touch of vanilla, an interesting addition."
"D- A great beer in general, but really nice to have around for Thanksgiving."
"Mouthfeel features good body and density to go with substantial flavour, a bit acidic and a bit gassy, a solid ring remained and head was easily regenerated to the very end of the tasting."
"750ml into my ol' workhorse, the dogfish 22oz snifter. Pours out a deep auburn/reddish-brown, slightly murky, 1/2"" head falls to heavy fog and a solid ring. Slow falling lace. The aroma is pretty muted, beer might be too cold, so I'm gonna give it a minute to warm... Ok, so not a huge improvement in the smell, I'm getting a sweet Belgian aroma, some spice, both yeasty and added, perhaps some hints of orange. I'm not picking up a whole lot of malt character, which isn't awesome for a brownish beer. The flavor is an interesting maple-milk chocolate, nice and round with a slight alcohol character, this definitely tastes ""young," and I could see this aging wonderfully. The spices are nice and mellow, but there. The bitterness is good and strong with an interesting cinnamon bite. I'm not really sure what the yams bring to the table. The mouthfeel is pretty good, although the alcohol is definitely there, which hurts it. The finish is nice and clean. Overall this beer drinks pretty well, only really hindered by the alcohol, which I figure is going to smooth over with a little time. I'm gonna grab a pair of these to throw into the cellar, I'm super pumped these guys are in Ohio now!"
"This is a hard one to drink without a wingman. The beer has a great deal of depth and promise which is why I score it well, just needs time to age out and have alcohol blend and fade."
"This is one interesting take on a ""pumpkin"" beer. I think it works pretty well with the Belgian yeast and all. I may have to pick up another bottle to share with the fam. on Turkey Day."
"D: Drinkable but spiced beers inevitably have a limit with me. Will split another 750 by 2 or 3 people. Nice autumn offering. Different with the yams etc, so that was a nice change over the typical pumpkin offering. I enjoyed."
"Tried the 2010 version, it was carbonated but smell and taste are worse."
"D: An interesting take on the belgian strong dark. Worth a try for sure. I am not sure how much, and how often I'd like to enjoy such a dense beer."
"D- This is a nice brew that's easy to drink. It's definitely a change of pace from your usual fall seasonal pumpkins. I had no problem finishing off a 64 oz. growler and was left feeling nice with the 10.50% ABV."
"Notes: I love beer diversity and a yam based brew is really welcome, but when its use does so little to be different than pumpkin, and in fact seems to pick up exactly the role of that vegetable I don´t think that bragging about how you don´t use it is necessarily an asset. And in that regard while calling it a pumpkin ale is inaccurate is not entirely off the mark, sure there is a sense of BSDL there but the overall effect is of seasonal autumn pumpkin-like beer, a rather good at it sure. However, the price and large serving does only make really suitable for sharing on a table since otherwise it ends up feeling a bit dull. Maybe I could find such an occasion, on the other hand when I think of big brews to share and maybe surprise this is not one that necessarily comes to mind."
"odd looking belgian dark. a diaphanous medium brown, with no real head. the nose is strong and delicious, but not really much of a belgian dark strong happening here. the taste is pretty much the exact same for pumking, except they do not use as much maple syrup, so its not as sweet. the feel is really off, way to thin an undercarbonated. the sweetness is too much for a belgian dark strong, and I would never come back to this for a belgian of that style. ooh foxy lady."
"D- Very good. No sign of the ABV, this beer is a delight to drink. I'm snagging a bottle to bring home for Thanksgiving. A great beer!"
"D: Highly drinkable and an incredible mouthfeel makes this a very enjoyable beer. Kinda like ST Pumking but with a distinct not-quite-pumpkin taste."
"Drinkability: An execeptional but ultimately flawed beer, to my palate; great look and feel, but the molasses is just a bit too much and overwhelms the palate; if the sweeter elements were a bit more subtle, this would be extraordinary"
"Drinkability- Two would be too many for me."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again, it reminds me of a cross between southern teir pumpkin and leviathan quad. I recommend this to someone who opens with an intense malt profile with tangy and spiciness which workd well as an earthy middle emerges with the malt and tangy profile finish."
"Drinkability: Pretty darn good. Sure, there's a little bit of heat - sort of that typical Belgian beer-esque heat that's farther back in the throat, warming without being hot, and any ""heat heat"" is covered up by the spices - but it's not too bad. Sure, it's fairly high in abv% - at 10.5%, you're gonna feel it unless you're a tank. And it's fairly impressive enough combination and collection of flavors that it manages to withstand the force of both of these. Kudos to the Bruery - work on that retention, enhance those aromas ever so slightly, and you'd have a real serious winner on your hands."
"D - tasty...10% but i could see this being better with more yam/maple flavor covering a barleywine base."
"D-I thought this sounded pretty unique and I am glad I tried it but it is a one-time thing. Maybe a once a year thing. I couldn't see this being a staple in my fridge but a nice unique offering."
"D- Well, this brew is what it is. Very appropriately named Autumn Maple but maybe an even better name could have been Autumn Maple Yams."
"A fair amount of carbonation, but the alcohol just makes it tough to drink more than a few ounces of it. Like I said, a pleasant taste, but very hard to drink."
"Overall, a decent and interesting dessert beer. Very aptly named Autumn Maple, and if you're into sweet fall dessert beers, this is definitely worth a shot."
"Overall not bad. A sipper for sure, & I'm not sure it delivered as heavily on all the fronts it purported to (didn't detect any maple, for instance). It seems very similar to a lot of big, alcoholic American-Belgian styles. Had I no context & didn't know all the ingredients, I'm not sure it would have made much of impression. I'm curious how it might age."
"D - Perhaps for dessert - this is a slow-sipper, especially given its high ABV. I'm not a fan of this style so I'm trying to be fair."
"EDIT: On tap this beer carries more weight and is a better experience."
"Overall this is an interesting beer that has an earthy character I'm not averse to but that I'm not a huge fan of. Still, a different kind of beer for the autumn months that's worth a shot."
"I expected this one to be a malt bomb. Far from it, however! It ends up evenly balanced and is an intriguing sipper to usher in the changing od the autumn leaves."
"This is a really unique beer that I enjoyed drinking - though what I was really craving was a well spiced pumpkin beer. Still, hard to fault the integration of yam into a balanced, drinkable beer. Well done."
"D: This is a decent, drinkable American version of a Belgian beer."
"Overall, not bad, but I don't think I would need to revisit."
"It's light to medium bodied with a good deal of carbonation. Again, not quite what I expected. This beer suffers in the mouthfeel category in my opinion. Drinkability is good nonetheless."
"Overall - Lots of potential that just didn't click. Unfortunately this beer sounds much better; or even much more interesting, than it really is."
"D - Easy drinking, even if the alcohol is rather noticable. This is a pretty interesting hybrid of Belgian meets pumpkin ale, but I wouldn't mind a more substantial mouthfeel."
"I almost want to drive the drinkability score up to 4.5, but it falls a hair short due to the carbonation. That said, this beer is in the upper echelon of pumpkin/yam/fall harvest beers. Should Wisconsin start getting the Bruery (and I hear we might), this beer would be a welcome guest for fall and winter festivities."
"A rather enjoyable beer, recommended."
"Pours light chocolate brown color with honey highlights; a rather small tan head that quickly settled into nothingness. The aroma is of nice spicy belgian yeast; banana and clove, brown sugar, and figs. The maple aroma comes through as the brew warms. The taste is vinous, a plum fruitiness, an earthy spice tone, light lemon tartness. The molasses and maple syrup add the sweetness to the brew but are fairly subtle and blend with what I imagine is the yam. Not much yam flavor but I pick it up towards the end. The feel is moderate to thick, light carbonation"
"Very nice orange hue to it though a tad hazy/muddy looking. Nice aroma-somewhat bready and biscuit like. Decent level of spices going on. Pumpkin like aroma is definatley there-yeah I know it isn't a pumpkin beer! Solid malty taste up front. Again a nice ""pumpkin like"" flavor-can I tell the difference between a yam and pumpkin? I doubt it. Moderate caramel and sugary sweet taste. Yeasty and earthy notes come thru in the finish. A Belgian pumpkin beer for sure. Good body-sweetness may make it a bit slick overall. Very drinkable and enjoyable. The initial booziness I found rapidly faded into more of a spice quality. My gears are turning for next years homebrewed pumpkin beer after this one. Well worth trying."
"D-Much better than all of those over spiced pumpkin beers out these days. Actually a nice base beer with a bit of spice underneath. Alcohol is a bit too high to have more than one."
"Pours dark brown with random blocks of red and is topped with a dense quilting of tan lace which recedes at a medium pace as small bubbles pop here and there on top. When all is said and done a thin sheet is left on the surface and a few specks of lace cling to the glass. A sweet malty aroma floats to the nose upon initial inspection. Beneath that is some spicy funk and some mild ester fruitiness. Way down below exist some notes of pumpkin and brown sugar. Tastes spicy and a bit yeasty with a pleasant, balancing bitterness in the end. Feels a little dry going down, but there's a small core of offsetting creaminess. Mouth-feel is medium and a slight alcohol heat sticks to the back of the throat. Really enjoying this beer, but might wish for just a bit more umph in the taste department."
"750ml. Cloudy dark orange pour, nice off white head and some lacing. Aroma has some pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice with sweet potato fries. Not really any aromas you'd expect to accompany a beer. Taste has some of the aroma, but also has a sour note that just lingers throughout. Candy sweet, no maple or malt sweetness. Fairly clean though, light bodied, right at the end of the spectrum of acceptable carbonation. Alcohol is not real apparent. I'm going to really struggle finishing the whole bottle. Sweet with sour and the Belgian yeast really just doesn't do it for me. Definetely one to share with others. Interesting and worth trying, but I think there are many reviews here that want this to be better than it really is."
"i would have called it a quadruple, but that's neither here nor there. such a strange and interesting fun beer. its seems as though the ""extra"" ingridients mimick the flavors that would already be present, and amp them up making every single character shine. dark sugars, maple, dark fruit, rum soaked raisins, burnt toffee, caramel, and creamy oh so good candied yam. it's almost like the yam stays in the middle and the rest dances around it as the strong, boozy elixer goes down. creamy, full, long, warming, boozy finish. really need to be able to step back from the crowd to enjoy this one, and it is also a serious sipper, so drinkability goes down a bit. not for the faint of heart."
"Drinkability- Well in all honesty its not 100% what I expected but saying that, I still really enjoyed it. The nose really makes this smell like a typical Pumpkin brew and has that great Autumn brew nose. The taste is a bit different as the potatoes are fairly influential but that's what makes this brew interesting right? Good stuff from The Bruery yet again and huge thanks to Jeff!"
"Bottle Pours a murky brown amber with a good light tan head. The head is lasting and laces okay. Has a sweet aroma of yams, spices, and maple syrup. The carbonation is good. Has a good flavor with spices and a slight burn. Has a full body. The texture is watery but it is the best watery beer I have tasted. Has a good finish and a nice aftertaste. This is a good beer."
"Pours a moderately clear deep amber color. The head is decent sized, but it fades fast, leaving only a bit of a ring, no lacing. Alright looking. Smells like candy and sweets upfront. A bit of orange zest, starchy sweet potato casserole with a little burnt bits, a bit of toffee, a tiny bit of syrup. It's nice, a little too sweet smelling for me, not enough beer, but nice. The taste is pretty good too. Very similar to the smell, but it's a lot harder to distinguish everything. It's just a rush of sweet candy flavors A(though the beer itself isn't sweet and syrupy) with a mildly spicy finish. I'm interested but not impressed. The alcohol is a little too strong for me. It's not very heavy for a 10.50% beer, which is surprising. The carbonation bites on the finish. Not bad, but not a whole lot of fun. And for the strength, I'm surprised that it's so easy to drink. Though it reminds of a whiskey drink or something a little bit. Interesting enough to try."
"Maybe it's that I find the idea of quitting your day job to start up a brewery with your family in Orange County to be romantic, but I've fallen in love with just about every beer the Famille Rue puts out there. I appreciate their creativity and respect the difficulties of successfully making those visions reality. This brewery has had some quality control issues in the past but if this year's Autumn Maple is any indication they've got them sorted out."
"Thanks again Jeremy... This was still a pretty enjoyable experience."
"The beer is murky dark copper color with a finely celled tan foam that starts at about 4 fingers thickness. The aroma is a little weizenbockish with pungent phenols, it smells a little aggressive. I get a lot more complexity out of the taste, I really like how all the flavors come together. To start with there are the weizen flavors of sweet malts and some light banana, but on top of that is a gourd-like quality which must be from the yams. Maple syrup is there but I wouldn't know it unless I expected it, and to finish it all off there's a hot alcoholic burn. The body is full and the carbonation, while light, is evident enough and proof that the Bruery fixed the problems they evidently had last year with this beer. This is more a sipper than chugger, and is a great beer with that in mind."
"D - It's a nice slow sipper. Not completely a dessert beer tho very enjoyable. This would probably go well with Thanksgiving dinner rather than Thanksgiving desert. It totally drives home the thoughts of Autumn leaves, and the changing seasons."
"Very enjoyable beer. I am not eating food with this but I get the sense this would go well with Thanksgiving dinner."
"The highly overspiced cinnamon makes this really not very drinkable unless you have your face in an apple pie."
"Come on ""The Bruery", I hope you're not just sending us the dregs."
"Murky brown, cider like color with a fluffy bubbly tan head that quickly fades to nothing, very still appearance, no lacing. Aroma is fairly mild, a little disappointing that it isn't stronger given the ingredients in this beer. Very earthy, vegetable-like and Belgian-y aroma, with mild sweetness (the maple I suppose but I can't actually identify that specifically), some peppery and cinnamon spices. Doesn't really open up much more as it warms up sadly. Flavor isn't that much different than what I imagine an Unibroue pumpkin beer might taste like. Well, you can tell the difference between the yams used instead of pumpkins, but as for what the spice and maple contribute there isn't anything that unique. Full bodied, syrup like, with high carbonation (seems like issues from last year's batch didn't carry over in that regard). Taste starts off like a dark Belgian ale, before the spices come in, cinnamon, light clove, etc. Finish has both an earthy, vegetable taste (the yams) and a slight sweetness (the maple), but neither is overpowering and are nicely balanced. Alcohol has a warming presence, but never burns or is found in the flavor. Overall, a very nice balance of flavors, and a nice alternative to the glut of pumpkin beers on the market this time of year, but slightly disappointed that if you're not paying close attention as you drink it's just another dark Belgian."
"I liked this. The combo of the yams, maple syrup, and spice made for a pleasant Fall-like feel in the mouth, and the higher alcohol guarantees you'll get warmed up on those cool Autumn nights. This was definitely a sipper but a damn tasty one."
"Autumn Maple tastes like a sweet yam casserole with brown sugar, black pepper, grape juice, lemon, and a multitude of spices. There's definitely a lot going on here. The beer is spritzy in mouthfeel but it's thin too. This is a good fall beer, but I think I prefer the taste of pumpkins in my beer over the taste of yams."
"Incredibly smooth and full on the mouthfeel. I'm really digging this beer!"
"D-Tasty and unique. I really enjoyed this one. Certainly a sipper of a brew. To be enjoyed as it transforms as it warms becoming more and more earthy and aromatic. A fitting tribute to my favorite season of the year."
"Out of a 750 ml capped bottle. Pours light chocolate brown color with honey highlights; a rather small tan head that quickly settled into nothingness. The aroma is of nice spicy belgian yeast; banana and clove, brown sugar, and figs. The maple aroma comes through as the brew warms. The taste is vinous, a plum fruitiness, an earthy spice tone, light lemon tartness. The molasses and maple syrup add the sweetness to the brew but are fairly subtle and blend with what I imagine is the yam. Not much yam flavor but I pick it up towards the end. The feel is moderate to thick, perhaps a touch syrupy and sticky; light carbonation and quite noticable abv. An interesting brew, needs to tone down the booze so that the other flavors come through. Perhaps some aging would do the trick."
"These guys are something else, I look forward to the opportunity to try anything new from The Bruery. Yam beer, here we go. This one pours an awesome orange/brown hue that screams the season, a small tan head rests atop. Lots of sweetness and gentle breezes of alcohol in the nose, sweet potato malt? This beer is difficult to review because there is so much happening here. Thanksgiving in a bottle really, the light maple syrup note works well with the sweetness and mild spiciness of the brew, the alcohol content is detectable but it cuts right through the flavor in a way that enhances the experience rather than hurt it, this beer is hot in a good way. Im really enjoying this, Thanksgiving in a bottle."
"The abv level is a bit high. While I don't taste it, I am certainly starting to feel it, at the halfway point in this 25oz. bottle. Other than that though, it's super tasty and easy to drink."
"Brownish oranage in color, frothy plume of white head, good lacing. Smell is dominated byBelgian yeasts, dark fruits and earth. Hints of fall spices such as nutmeg, cinamon and clove. The taste is also dominated by the Belgian yeast and dark fruit. The seasonal tastes follow on the end - cinamon, clove, nutmeg, hints of maple brown sugar and a slight candied yam/sweet potato flavor. Medium bodied, ample carbonation. Good, but not great, dominated by the Belgian Ale part of the equation which doesnt let the seasonal tastes come through enough."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation, a bit more that I prefer, but still great."
"Drinkability: While chilled it's really quite unique and interesting. Only as it warms and you progress through the glass does the spicing really appear. So, pretty damned drinkable!!!"
"Beer is clear but if not careful, the yeast will dislodge from the bottom of the bottle and the last sips will be yeasty. Overall the beer is well balance, especially when you consider the high ABV (10.5!). It finishes a little dry, but the complexity of the flavors come through. I'm not sure what I expected from a beer made with yams, but it was pretty good. I don't pick up much of the maple character, but I'm not sure how much I should. Good beer, interesting, check it out."
"I highly recommend this beer for the fall. The beer creates a perfect equation for fall and winter, all you need is Autumn Maple(+)Friends(+)A Fire(X)Cold weather and you will be sure to have a good time."
"Poured a leather brown with a huge head from good carbonation that dies slowly. An intense smell of cinnamon, clove, peppers; the spices in this beer outweight the smell of yams and there is some minor sweetness in the smell of maple and molasses and also a little yeast smell. The sweetness from the yams and maple is evident but the spices, mostly cinnamon and clove is what I am picking up, is just a tad too powerful. A full-bodied beer that is thick, sticky, and smooth and finishes slightly dry due to a minor citric hop bite on the backend; could also be a very minor ABV burn. A very good if not great beer that is pleasing to sip on and I enjoyed it thoroughly; only wish it could've been a little sweeter."
"Drinkability: Definitely a good beer to sip on on a cold winter night. It smells like a pumpkin ale, but tastes like a Belgian brown. I'm not really sure how to best classify it. My nose says one thing, and my tastebuds say another. It's a beer I definitely would have to be in the mood for, and I might pick up another one for when the weather cools."
"I like Pumpkin Ales, and especially the Imperial variety, so I found this to be quite drinkable and a terrific Fall seasonal."
"D: Quite drinkable, especially for the style. One of my new favorite fall seasonals."
"It's a little too carbonated I think and comes across just a touch too thin. Overall a very fine brew and I can't wait to try more from The Bruery!!!"
"D- I really enjoyed this, exceeded expectations as im not a big pumpkin guy and the amount of it in this beer is why I like this so much, there is so much more going on in this beer. The 10% is very high so splitting a bottle with a like minded friend is the way to go. I'm going to pick up some bottles for thanksgiving, it's sort of a no brainer. The Bruery is doing big thangs for such a young Bruery."
"As far as fall offerings go, this guy has a rich and unique character that goes a really long way."
"I have been looking forward to trying this beer for quite a while now, so what better time to try it than the first day of Fall? Decanted in to a tulip glass, head rises very quickly to produce three fingers worth. Color is a murky maple orange/brown mix. Heading is slow to fade, and does not leave residue on the sides of the glass. Spicy nose full of cinnamon and clove, along with some nutmeg, and light pumpkin spice. Funny that none of the ingredients mentioned on the label I can pick up in the smell. Taste is a different story, as the brown sugar and maple syrup really show up. The yams I wish I could taste, but I think the fact that I have never had yams may have something to do with it. I also get a slight hint of juicy fruit in the taste, which may be a result of the higher alcohol content. Speaking of the alcohol, it really works with this beer in that it can be felt and tasted, but it complements many of the flavors. All of the spices really give your palate a full slide show of tastes. As far as drinkability goes, I will need to get another bottle or two while they are still around, as this might be the perfect beer for this season. Next time I pop one of these, I will make sure I am in the middle of some real Boston Fall weather, so that the experience is all the more appropriate. So far, this is my favorite beer from the Bruery."
"Large bottle, w/o any freshness info. Pours dark brown and murky, dark khaki head, moderate collar and fairly minor spotty lacing. Spiced up nose, with sweet malts, and vanilla also coming to the party. Thanksgiving spices, sweat potatos, pumpkin, plenty of dark and sweet malts floating around. Rich, sweet, nice for fall, warming and tasty. Perhaps too sweet for my tastes, but still a nice fall offering from Bruery. Has thanksgiving dinner desserts written all over it."
"Recommended Music Pairing - Wilco - Being There"
"I bought the barrel-aged version in a bottle as well, so I can't wait to compare the two."
"I understand that for the most part BA exhibits similar characteristics to Harvard in the grade inflation department. Personally, I've been trained to see a ""B" rating and I think ""holy crap, this must not be good."" Autumn Maple is a non-inflated B+. Maybe better. Complexity, innovation and a great deal of pleasure out of this brew. It's carting a few extra L-Bs but it's damn good. Congratulations, Patrick, I see you've done it again...another fine job."
"We had this on-tap at the pb taproom. It was poured into a chimay goblet, medium brown in color with very little head. Not really a very strong smell to speak of. The taste was heavy on the fall spices with especially strong nutmeg. Really too heavy with the spices but nevertheless very smooth despite the high abv. The malty brown ale base was quite tasty with some discernable belgian esters and phenols. Tough to finish the whole glass with all the heavy spicing."
"This is yet another interesting, unusual beer, one with a very complex flavor profile. While good, this is yet another beer that I cannot see myself drinking more then one small glass at a sitting."
"Although it's brewed with yams, this is one of the better Pumpkin beers I've had. Is it a must try? Not really. It's more of a must smell type of beers. This beer was so good that I could really see me opening a bottle or drinking another growler of this in the fall or early winter."
"This is a very unique complex beer in which the extreme variety of flavors balance each other out quite nicely. Never to spicy too yammy which is a good thing. It kind of reminds me of a liquid Thanksgiving."
"The beer pours a hazy amber/red color with a thin offwhite head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is good. It has a really nice yam aroma with a hint of molasses and pumpkin spice. There is a warming dryness that I equate with the maple syrup. The taste is decent. It has an overly complex taste. There is a little too much going on with this one. It has your typical pale and crystal malt flavor with yams and spice. This would have been adequate enough. On top of this you have molasses which adds a buttery/syrupy taste and you have maple syrup which adds alcohol and a nasty dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel is average. It is a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a nice attempt, but I would be more willing to try a scaled down effort with more carbonation."
"Overall: Nice try. It is unique, and if is wasnt so overpowering, it might be good. As it is, it is way too sweet."
"D: Tasty as hell, can't believe people don't rave about this one."
"Bottle: Poured a light burgundy color ale with a very thin bubbly head with no retention and no lacing. Aroma of yams is dominating with some sweet malt. Taste is also dominated by yams with some sweet malt but absence of carbonation and overpowering of sweetness renders this beer quite gross. Body is very thin and somewhat oily with no carbonation and alcohol was not apparent. I must admit that I am very disappointed by this one - no carbonation and grossly sweet makes for a total mess. This is surprising considering the very good beers I had from the brewery previously."
"This ones quite sweet and will be difficult to finish the bottle with having no carbonation to liven things up."
"Tastes dry spice. Lacking 'lighter' spice characters over darker brooding spices. Baker's chocolate, drying booziness, pumpkin is mild. There is a little bit of brown sugar or maybe grain-based fruitiness (raisins). Md-light body. Not very impressive, but I had high expectations, based on the oak aged Levud I had a while back."
"This is an interesting beer from Bruery who is doing lots of creative things. I wouldn't put this up with the best pumpkin-style beers or Breury's best but it's still tasty. I think a little more carbonation would have helped things a bit."
"I do enjoy this beer quite a bit more than the Black Orchard. The flavor of this is complex and unique and it's quite drinkable. The 10% is very nicely hidden. There's an over-riding sweet quality to this beer, but it never becomes cloying. Rather, it's quite enjoyable as an entity unto itself. This is the kind of beer I'd crave especially in October. This has autumn written all over it. Some juicy and rich malt tones. Belgian like candy tones with plum accents. It's also got some vegetal qualities and sugary yam, maple and brown sugar/molasses. They do a nice job taking all these sweet indgredients and creating a unique and flavorful beer that is not too sweet or cloying. Good work. Pump up the CO2 a tad and we've got a solid beer all around."
"Drinkability: Fairly good. It's definitely unique, which is never a bad thing, and with a few tweaks here and there, particularly in the carbonation department, The Bruery could have a real winner on their hands."
"D: it is what it is but not my style"
"It's really interesting, I think if it was more carbonation this would be great."
"May not be fair since the bottle had been roused quite a bit before opening but poured a hazy brown with some definete yeast sediment. Aroma was that of maple sugar and raisins and roasted malt. Had a little bit of red hue to it. CO2 was on the light side. Belgian yeast flavor followed by brown sugar and some other spices. Mouthfeel was ok but could have been better."
"Drinkability- Managed about half the bottle before I had to drain pour it. Flavor was fine...and for someone who loves low carbonation and cask conditioned ales, I couldn't do this one. Could be a very good beer. Take notes Bruery as this isn't the only BA that has encountered this."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"Overall, not especially pleased given the price, but I like supporting local beers. So will try again next year (if its around) to see if problems solved."
"PS: The very faint hiss when uncapping and the generally flat appearance/feel leads me to suspect an issue on the bottling line. Purchased only a couple weeks ago, a fall seasonal certainly within the time frame of freshness. Worth noting that this ale seemed anything but 'fresh' from the bottle."
"Pours a rich woody-red color with virtually no head. Aroma of pumpkin spices. Big flavor of yams, which works surprisingly well, spice, and some notes that remind me of rum-raisin ice cream. For all of that, the body is on the thin side, and combining that with the lack of carbonation, the beer is somewhat unsatisfying. There is less alcohol warming than I'd expect for 10% ABV. Tasty, but not really in a beery way. A worthwhile experiment, worth trying, but not something I'd likely buy again."
"750 ml bottle purchased from Beverage Warehouse for ten dollars, tasted on Thanksgiving, reviewed from notes, also had on tap a few weeks before, poured into an oversized wine glass, color is a mix between copper and dark orange, minimal 1/4 inch creamy off white head that leaves a little ring, minor lacing, smell is yams, pumpkin pie, numerous spices, molasses, and caramel, flavor is mostly brown sugar and spices, nice malt backbone, the aftertaste is where you really see the yams and surprisingly it works, never thought it would in a beer, but nice flavor that was perfect over the holiday, mouthfeel is thick, malty, spicy, and chewy, taste lingered a long time, need a lot more carbonation, medium to full bodied, could not drink this whole bottle, strength is there but hidden well, it is very heavy on the stomach though, look forward to seeing how this ages over the years, congratulations to Patrick on brewing another very unique brew, try this when possible"
"Overall, I liked this beer ALOT when i had it on tap at the br(ue)ewery, I think it loses a little of its character in the bottle with the light carb. I found myself really enjoying it in 4-5 oz. increments but not wanting more than that."
"D - I think this beer would be wonderful if properly carbonated but it is not and that makes it a little hard to handle"
"Pours murky brown with absolutely no head. Maple syrup and pumkins are prevalent in the nose, as is molasses and spice. You can really taste the yams, and I'm not sure that's a good thing when it comes to beer. Heavily spiced, nutmeg, cinnamon, and very sweet due to the maple syrup. The flatness of the mouthfeel really detracts from the beer as there is no carbonatin at all. I applaud the attempt but I will not be gettign this one again."
"Find this one on tap where it's properly carbonated for a true treat. Try it in the bottle if (like me) you know what you're getting into and don't want to wait until next year to try it. Hope The Bruery gets their carbonation issues worked out (the word is their house yeast simply couldn't handle the higher alcohol content of this beer to carbonate it)."
"D: Interesting but flawed. I'd love to revisit with a properly carbonated example. Very odd..."
"I like that the spice character is quite subtle, it is hard to guess what is spice and what is fermentation derived here, which is exactly how I prefer it. The beer itself is not too bad, it definitely really needs the texture and vitality that carbonation would bring to it. I definitely am looking forward to getting the next, carbonated batch of this."
"A very interesting beer! My first sip made me ""Wow!"" with all the flavors to take in. You can definitely taste the yams and it's fairly spiced but very drinkable. Cinnamon, ginger and allspice (i think) jump out at me. The color is light amber and the head was well formed. I hear the bottles have a carbonation problem, but it works well on cask because you don't expect much. It tastes like what a autumn amber should taste like. I wouldn't drink it every day, but I would gladly grab a bottle next autumn to enjoy."
"My first Yam ale. Very nice balance, with a lot of flavor. Notes of yam, candied pecan, cinnamon, ginger and all spice. Very simple nose, with sweet malt. Autumn colored ale, with a long lasting head. Interesting, well balanced flavor. Sweet, strong. Pretty nice."
"I saved my only bottle of this for thanksgiving. Poured dark brown with absolutely no carbonation. Smells and tastes very nice. Perfect thanksgiving flavors - yams, spices, maple syrup. Really creative idea. Unfortunately the near total absence of carbonation makes this practically undrinkable. It's like a syrupy yam juice. Very disappointing to spend $15 on this, especially since I seem to recall reading that the brewer has acknowledged the carbonation problem. The price should be drastically cut. Couldn't even finish a glass of this, so we used the remainder in our turkey gravy - a task for which this beer is much better suited. The gravy turned out great. Highly recommend using this beer for cooking."
"I hope if they brew this again that they adjust the carbonation of this beer. If they do I would highly recommend this one."
"Overall, this beer was memorable, but for the wrong reasons. I applaud the Bruery for their creativity, but in my (admittedly) novice opinion, the Autumn Maple just doesn't work. If they can get the carbonation worked out, I would be curious to try a small glass on tap next year, but I will not be buying another bottle. Ever. I am looking forward to the Bruery (hopefully) redeeming itself in the bottle of Saison Rue that I will be opening shortly."
"I was very excited to try this beer since it was brewed with yams, spices, and maple. However, I was very disappointed when the it poured with no head whatsoever. Little to no carbonation. Great aroma and flavors going on, but it tasted like a beer right after fermentation - flat and sweet. The beer is bottle conditioned so maybe I got one that just didn't carbonate. Gave it a 1.5 on drinkability because my friends and I had to dump it down the drain. Sad."
"D: Overall, this beer lacks a feel and carbonation, which kind of spoils it. There is 10% ABV in this beer, but it is so tasty that I cannot detect the slightest bit of it. Kind of tastes like a pumpkin brew you left open and out all night that somehow retained all its flavor but not its carbonation. Its still very drinkable, just half as enjoyable as it would be with some body."
"I knew about the carbonation issue prior to purchasing this 750 ml bottle. I pulled the trigger anyway because the thought of a yam-based Belgian brown ale with a 'pumpkin ale' palette of spices sounded too good to pass up. If The Bruery fixes things with the next batch, look out."
"One last note--I'm not sure why this is classified as a pumpkin beer when the label states that there is no pumpkin used in the brewing."
"a very drinkable fall brew, for a 10% plus brew."
"On tap at the brewery during AHA rally. It's thanksgiving in a glass. Orange amber color with a creamy tan head. Aroma is spices like pumpkin pie meets candied yams. Taste is rich, full malt, some sweetness, and yes you can taste the yams! Some alcohol. Full bodied and smooth for a beer that strong."
"I think the beer may have been a little cool and that I had some unfair expectations of what this beer was and should taste like. It was a good beer just not what I expected."
"On tap toronado SD, would love to try a bottle after a year in storage. As the toronado staff noted, this would be awesome with thanksgiving meal. A bit sweet, some spice but with great texture. Really interesting nose and sweet and lingering finish. Like a thanksgiving meal wrapped up into a brew. Very enjoyable. I don't have a lot of experience with this style brew."
"Overall, I am looking forward to getting this one again next year, as this years batch has suffered far too greatly from lack of carbonation. It just felt lifeless and dull, which is a shame as this may have been a remarkable brew otherwise."
"Awesome beer, awesome brewery. Like whats going on there and look forward to many future offerings."
"**I just found some tasting notes on this that appear to be about a year old! In any event, repeated bottles demonstrated that the lack of carbonation was an endemic problem. Even on-tap, only mild carbonation, but really flat out of bottle. Will update review/scores."
"It does feel nice in the mouthfeel department. Full bodied an syrupy with very little carbonation. This beer packs a bunch at 10.5% ABV. It's a very interesting brew that's big on yams but I can recommend to try, but in the end, it's not my cup of tea...and I'm a big pumpkin/spice ale fan"
"The head went away quickly on my sample, the color being a dark russet orange. The aroma is maple syrup at first, then as the beer warms the assorted spices (clove, nutmeg) and yams really come out. If you try this, allow this to warm up to let the overall flavor shine. Yams, yams, and more yams here with assorted spices. (Dark) Fruity Belgian yeast is very noticable. The alcohol can't be found, the carbonation is at a perfect level, it has a full body...I like the feel. Sip and enjoy with a Thanksgiving dinner, or in my case a bratwurst and German potato salad."
"D: A beer that drinks as if it had much lower alcohol, but it still contains some heaviness making it more of a sipper. Best of the style I have ever had, I can't wait 'til it comes out in bottles, I know what I'm drinking this Halloween."
"Easily the best ""pumpkin"" ale of the handful I've ever had, though it has it's own unique take with the yams, Belgian yeast, and any other secrets in it. I don't think I'm the biggest fan of the taste of pumpkin ales traditionally, so it says a lot for this one to score so high for me."
