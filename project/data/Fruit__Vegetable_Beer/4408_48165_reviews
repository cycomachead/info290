"Tastes a lot like peach water"
"Meh.  I tried this on a hot day in Florida since I thought it might hit the spot and its just not doing it for me.   The aroma and taste were like the syrup from a can of peaches, which I personally don't find appetizing.  I understand it says real peaches but I just wasn't tasting a fresh peach there.  Maybe it was just not the right batch."
""
"Poured a hazy orange with a finger of white head and some sparse lacing. Smells of peach obviously. Tastes more artificial/rotten peach than fresh peach. Feels good in the mouth but the taste overpowers anything good. Overall not a fan of this wheat ale."
""
"Great Peach taste, MUCH better than I could have imagined."
""
"Wonderful cool peach flavor that's not overpowering or phony tasting. A bit dark for what I'd expect a peach ale to look like, but comes through clean and smooth."
""
""
"Had a very artificial peach character to the aroma and flavor, not something I'll be revisiting."
""
""
"Smell and taste of the best peaches you can buy in South Carolina.  The best summer brew available! Phenomenal beer!"
"Strange bitterness at the end"
"not a fan of this beer"
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with touches of amber.  Medium collar, great lacing, good wisps and decent head.  Aroma is great; like a fresh juicy peach with a some wheatiness to it as well.  Taste is where it falls off a bit.  I get the peach, but it tastes manufactured.  Peach up front, wheaty banana in the middle and some odd bitter spiciness at the end.  Medium body, low carbonation and a slightly grainy mouthfeel too."
""
"O: I could see this being an extremely refreshing change of pace on a hot summer afternoon. Not something I would drink regularly, but interesting and worth a shot."

"Quite possibly the most pleasing beer by smell I've ever encountered.  The taste was light and peachy - very sweet. Can barely taste the wheat beer. The wheat gives it a very creamy finish which compliments the flavor. Overall, an outstanding fruit beer."
"Overall, this beer looks and starts well but the finish and flavor are off putting, too dry and not balanced, possibly a bad batch?"
"Too much peach here. Too much sweetness for me. The peach is huge in the nose. There's some hop character toward the end but not too much and the alcohol is well masked by the sweet peach flavor."

"Good if you like a sweet fruit beer"

"I like this beer; the peach flavor keeps it from being too hoppy. Not pretentious, just a good beer. And the 5.8% doesn't hurt either."

"O: I would have liked a more intense peach flavor;"
"M - Other than the lingering sulfuric finish, the body is appropriately light and well carbonated"
""
""
"Meh not that great. There are better fruity wheat beers. I had this at Packs Tavern in Asheville.  How long foes the comment length need to be to be acceptable ? I feel like I ant up if just for the hell out of it.   Just get a lambic if you want fruity; or AllagAsh White for a better wheat."

"This is medium to lighter bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. This is a pretty decent fruited wheat - nothing more or less. I suppose it should be noted that this packs about as much peach character as you can 'naturally' get in a brew with only a slight perfume-like ester going on in it."

"10/12/11 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Good balance. Not sweet, not bitter very little hops, which is to my liking."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really good beer. If you like peach flavored drinks then you will like this beer. It has a gloden look to it. Their is not that much head like some beers have. The smell is really good. The taste is also really good as well. Tou actually can taste the peach flavor that it has. It is not too strong like some beers are. It is not a heavy beer, but it is also not too light at the sametime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazed orange color. Smells like a peach creamsickle. Vanilla ice cream and peach preserves in the flavor. Really bright and peachy. Little bitterness, some toffee flavors to go with sugary peaches. A bit on the sweet side. Light to medium body. Overall, this is a solid peach ale. I'd do it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured on-tap in a shaker pint, the beer is a deep, vibrant, caramel-gold coloring, with a frothy, white head. Aromas of sweet peach fruit forward, on a subtle bread backbone. Flavors of sweet peach forward, with a toasted grain backbone, and subtle citrus highlights. Simple, well balanced, and damn tasty. Smooth, mid-bodied, with a toasted and subtle tangy sweet aftertaste. Smooth, clean finish. Great warm weather beer."

"I had this beer on a whim. I saw it in the cooler at work as a special craft night beer. I popped it after hours and took a few sips. I figured it would be nice and refreshing and boy was I right! It was so sweet and perfect. Pale ale and had amazing peach hints through the whole experience. To me it would be an amazing summer beer. I loved it so much our local Sam's Club sales local beers and I stocked up!!! Favorite for now!"

"Overall: An above average peachy ale that has enough bitterness to balance out the fruit. Nothing groundbreaking, but I could see myself finishing off a six pack quickly during the warmer months."

"After this beer was done, I made a mental note to get a good Belgian white with no fruit. Time to get back to basics."
"O - The best fruit/wheat beer I've had to date, outstanding use of peach in this one. On tap its a bit better, but still this is a great sessionable fruit beer."
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium peachy golden amber with a huge white head with decent retention and lacing. Aroma dominated by fresh peach juice with hints of biscuit malt and wheat. Flavor follows aroma with peachy biscuit malt and wheat, a light hop and malt finish. Light to medium bodied. The peach is nice, but this leaned more towards a light amber ale profile than a wheat ale. I think I would have liked this peach melded with a more distinct classic wheat ale. High scores on the deft use of peach juice, but less so the underlying body."

"O- As a first experience, this was not a bad one for seasonal beer. I would certainly drink this again given the opportunity but at the same time i will not go ape-crazy for it when i see it on tap. If you're into fruit flavored beer, this might be right up your alley."
"Bottom line: UNFINISHABLE"
""
""
"174 calories per bottle at 6% ABV. Not a bad fruit flavored seasonal. The peach taste is not too lite or too strong. I could last through a 6'er with this one. The best part is there is no over dose of sweetness and the aftertaste is works, which seems to be main problem with a fruit flavored beer. I would buy again."
""
""
""
"Thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
""
"The nose on this beer is awesome. Just like a fuzzed up peach. The rest of the experience is not so interesting. I am sure these beers have an appeal in the mass market, but I am looking for other things."
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. While it has heavy peach flavoring, it's not sweet at all, so you can have more than one and not OD on the sweetness that is the downfall of many fruity beers (in my opinion). Give it a shot and see if you like it. I've definitely had MUCH worse. I'd buy this for my home (I originally had it at a bar). Happy tasting!"
""

"would not buy again . heavy on peach. not so great on the beer flavor. i mixed peach schnapps and apricot brandy with it to make it palatable so i could finish the remaining 5 bottles. my brother didn't care for it. oh well..abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwkxyz.:("

"Overall I will return to it cause I'm certain I tasted an old or just plain ol bad batch.. but if this is what this beer is than I am mortified... sad to say but Id pick a big brewery beer over this one."

"Poured into a weizen glass. The beer pours hazy golden with a thick, creamy white head and lots of visible tiny bubbles. The aroma is strongly of peach. I also get some of the malt. The peach is also strong in the flavor. There's some balacing bitterness from the hops, but it's not very strong. I also get a nice malt backbone. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is fairly clean. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."

"Overall: you get what's advertised. Very nicely done, peach wheat. Refreshing, clean and I dig it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An easy drinking beer, great with food or on a hot day. Wish the peaches came rhrough a little more tart instead of sweet."
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Peaches!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If only the ale could have carried those tantilizing aromas through to taste and texture as well and we could have something special. But the beer is worth the purchase based on aromas alone!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
" This one can be a chick beer or a summer favorite ..."
""
"O: If this was not a $3 special I would have complained and sent it back. I'm highly disappointed in this considering how many people rave about this beer. I hate being so negative but I liked nothing that this beer had to offer. I wouldn't put this on your shirt list."
""
""
""
"My angry pour resulted in a finger of bubbly, tawny head with decent retention. Unfiltered, indeed! It was a cloudy orangish-amber in color which made me angry. I feel a mean drunk coming on. Nose was as peachy as Georgia and trying to decide how much of that was ""real peaches"" and how much was ""natural flavor added"" just made me angry. Mouthfeel was soft and the peaches almost had a preserve-like sweetness that was thankfully offset by the wheat or I might have been angry. Finish was slightly tart, but definitely peachy. It all added up to a beer that made me mean and angry enough to fire the empty bottle through my neighbor's window. Now, I've got the fuzz to boot!"

"Not a very pleasant experience. This beer should be dialed down to about 4% and feature a stronger wheat profile."
"O: A drinkable if mundane fruited American wheat beer. It has neither the fruity intensity of a peach lambic, nor the refreshing flair of a Bavarian hefeweizen, either of which I'd choose over this beer any day."
""
"Overall this is a refreshing beer that almost pulls everything together. It is a bit thin to be great, but definitely worth picking up on relaxing Southern summer day."

"Nice use of fruit. Balances well. Smells like deliciousness, but drinks a little shy of that goal. Bonus points for being refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my favorite summer time brews. I find it refreshing after cutting the lawn or relaxing on my patio. This years offering had a lot more floating around in my glass. Kinda weird watching those chunks working around in there. I look forward to this brew every summer."
""
"Served this beer on tap, in a pint glass. Poured a cloudy, golden color, produced a nice white head, great retention and left ample amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of malted wheat, and Peaches! Medium bodied, the base of this American Wheat Ale consisted of soft malted wheat, clover honey, and fresh Peaches. Sweet and semi tart, there is not any noticeable hop flavor. The Peach aroma is stronger then the taste- it actually is a very nice balance of peach and malted wheat. There is a fine line when adding fruit to a Wheat Ale and RJ Rockers did a good job of not crossing it with this ale."
""
""
"Overall- A very good fruit beer. If you are a fan of this style then you must try this one."
""
"O - This type of beer is not for everyone. The massive amount of peaches steers many away. I really like it. It is quite different, but refreshing. It packs a punch for it's style at around 6%. Not an overly fan of wheat beers, but this one works for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great tasting peach wheat ale light in color with an amazing taste very sweet goes great w a salty pretzel ,but I only like to drink one because it's so so sweet most fruity beers are I only wish I like the rest of RJ Rockers beers which don't do,anything for me and my beer buddy's"
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy yellow-orange with a giant foamy head that takes several minutes to settle. There was great lacing and retention before settling. There is heavy sediment and cloudiness. The nose is sweet with a huge amount of peach fruitiness. The taste doesn't follow the beer's nose with a slight amount of peach and a big amount of wheat and yeast. The mouthfeel is as expected, not too thick/thin, but there is an odd aftertaste that deviates from my expectations. I would probably drink this beer again, but I'd opt for an Ithaca apricot wheat instead."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Carbonation a little more. Not much of a finish. Tastes slightly artificial when it's all said and done. Still I gotta give it props for being a pretty decent beer in what I view as a somewhat bland style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the most interesting beers I've ever had. Not too big on wheat beers but this is really good."
"Overall in the nose department it's amazing and everywhere else it kinda falls off and disappoints."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how authentic and robust the peach aroma and flavoring was. At no point did it feel synthetic or overdone. The nose sung of summer peaches and cream, while the taste followed through nicely with nice even sweetness, and a bitter finish at the way end. We wish that the sweetness had remained just a bit longer, to help better balance the sourness and bitterness of the final flavors. This is a highly refreshing beer, but due to the glorious peach insanity, this guy will remain for special occasions."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I wasn't impressed. The odd medicinal flavor through me off. But even that aside, nothing seemed to meld together and the flavors were all over the place. Not a good effort."
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice hazy orange color body with a very small head that doesn't hang around long. The smell is like smelling a fresh peach, also with some faint wheat notes. The taste is of a nice peach flavor with wheat in the back ground. Also has some hop bitterness to it also. The mouth feel is great, goes down easy and is refreshing. Overall i think this is a nice and tasty summer beer."
""
""
"O-Glad I tried it. Above average....not bad but nothing I will buy again....would be a better beer at a lower ABV in my opinion..."
""
"Overall Impression- A decent brew by RJ Rockers but came a bit short in my books for this style. Too artificial and you can definitely find this in the mouthfeel... Would still order again because of its refreshing aroma and beginning of taste but not going to be on my top 100 list anytime soon."
""
"O - An okay beer that isn't too bad on a hot summer day. The bitter flavors are a bit offputting and seem to make it have a bit of and off flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with an inch off-white head that didn't stay around for too long. There's a small amount of lacing left on the glass. The beer smells mostly like peaches and peach syrup, and a bit of wheat. I like the aroma of this brew a lot. However, the taste isn't quite as nice. The peach taste seems more artificial to me, and there's a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and has a good level of carbonation. It's a decent enough brew overall. I think it's also overpriced at $10.99 a 6-pack, but I won't have any problems finishing it. I would buy this again, but just not at that price."
""
""
""
""
"Strong aroma has a very firm overtone of peach - it really does smell like a freshly cut peach, and I love peaches! It has a wheaty hint as well. Pours a hazy, nearly opaque honey golden with a thick and rather persistent palest honey-tan head. Wheaty flavor has a firm and somewhat sweet, but not too sweet, overtone of peach. Got me thinking - is it possible to make peach cider or peach wine? Well, the Japanese make plum wine - pourquoi pas? OK, enough digression. Texture has good body and good fizz, definitely some peach in the finish. If you love peaches, you should love this beer."
""
""
"O: The flavors in this beer are very nice. If you like peach beers then I would recommend this one. It differs from others in the fact that it finishes dry which I like. Some others can be over the top sweet."
""
"This is a decent beer that's refreshing and easily drinkable. It's worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Light and easy to drink, along with being refreshing. I was a little disappointed by how light the peach flavors were though I appreciate the fact that the beer was not overly sweet or artificially flavored. The smell of this beer is very inviting."
"O/D-Tastes better than it sounds. Wouldn't order it again. Would expect this Peach Beer to taste worse."
"Appearance is a cloudy gold; the thick white head has good retention. The smell is very nice with a noticeable peach scent, perhaps a bit of lemon in the background. The taste has typical wheat beer flavors of lemon and coriander, but with a touch of peach as well to make it interesting. It strikes a nice balance; slightly sweet but not overly fruity. I haven't had too many fruit beers that I've cared for, but this one was very good."
"O - This one really surprised me. This is really tasty and a great summer-style beer. I really love peaches, so I look forward to having this one again. It's very peachy and could become one of my regular summer rotation beers, enjoy!"
"I have had this beer both on tap and in a bottle. It is completely different on tap! The bottle left me with a bad after taste and sort of stale. On draft, the beer is very smooth with a burst of peach flavor! Overall, I enjoy the beer, but prefer their Black Pearle and Fish Paralyzer. I had this at the RJ Rockers Brewery"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not a huge peach person, but this was a very solid peach wheat. Sure it was overpowering, but it was over powering in a good way. Would love to try it on draft."
" I can definitely taste the higher abv in this beer. It has a somewhat bitter finish, but think it's a great wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - For those who love Peach. Seriously. It dominates everything else."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall well I can't get this locally and really don't want to drink it again. Was different that sweeter, artificial flavored peach beers."
""
""
"Pours a cloud peach amber with a quickly fading soapy off white head. Aroma is canned peach syrup with light wheat and straw. Grainy wheat body with surprisingly not as much sweetness as expected. Still artificial peach sweetness dominates throughout and syrup lingers through the finish. Syrupy, medium thick body with low carbonation. Well, I enjoyed this more than I expected and it had less Jolly Rancher like quality to it than others have attributed, but still not something I'd return to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-not bad nothing to get too excited about though but makes a nice refreshing brew for something a little different"
"Appearance is gold with particles a floating, the way a wheat should look. Smell is peachy, which it should have seeing it is named son of a peach. Mouthfeel, bright and evervecent on the tongue. Taste is nice, if you like peach. The right balance, reminds us of that syrip in canned peaches. Overall as wheat beer it is ok, your typical ""style"" beer. Will go well with pie and whipped cream. Ha.. Oh throw in some southern BBQ."
"O - This is a variant of what Cigar City does with Peach Jai-Alai. I think this is equally as good though as a different style. Really enjoying these folks from SC."
"When you get a whiff you don't want to stop smelling this beer. It smells like someone opened a can of sweet Cling peaches and poured a little bit of golden ale into it. This is addictive and I wish the taste had followed suit. The peach is still there, but dried out. The wheat helps to bring peach cobbler to your thoughts, well without the cinnamon. There is an acridness that doesn't kill the experience but I do wish it wasn't there as it messes with the mouthfeel. Otherwise this is a pretty nice beer."
"I will say that this is outstanding for the style, a real lady pleaser to boot."
"O: The beer is quite light and refreshing. Despite all of the peaches, it’s not that difficult to drink because the flavor isn’t artificially sweet."
"This brew poured out as a clear golden colored brew with a white head on top that hung around for a good amount of time. The smell of the beer has some nice peach aromas mixed with a touch of wheat as well. The taste of the beer is a little tart at first, catching me off guard. The more I drink the sweeter the taste of the peach becomes and the less sour it is. The mouthfeel of this beer is pretty nice, it's lighter bodied and refreshing in the warmer months. Overall this beer was enjoyable for me, I wouldn't drink it all the time but having it on random occasions wouldn't be bad."
"O - I actually had high hopes for this beer after hearing about it...it came across as just another average fruit beer...the peaches tasted as if they were concentrated and a big caramel dipped peach flavor kept coming back"
"This is what happens when you try to get cute with beer. I had such high hopes for this stuff. Heard it was the iconic beer of RJ Rockers. Looked great. Smelled great. Everything seemed to be going well until I took that first sip then . . . . I'm not sure what they have done to this beer. The peach flavoring must come from the peach pit. It doesn't taste much like peaches. As much as it pains me to say it, Bud Light Lime is much better. I'm just thankful I didn't buy a growler of it."
"O - Passable, but not near the realm of ""good"" wheat beers. Would pass on this in the future."
"O: This smelled really great, but the flavor was not very good."
"I had this in Asheville, NC at the Thirsty Monk South. Happened to try this when a buddy ordered one. Color is amber/red. Aroma is of wheat and peaches. I'm not a huge peach fan, but this beer is refreshingly tasty. Fruit comes through well and is just sweet enough to be refreshing without being cloying. Would be a great beer on a hot day."
"O - Overall, this was a very enjoyable beer. Unique for sure."
"A very simple beer, not much going for it. I'm not much for mixing beers, but this one cries out to be cut by a standard pale ale or a wit. Pours a pale amber with a thin head. Smells of unfiltered peach juice, heavy on the skins, and some soapiness. The taste is similar- starts pretty well but turns a bit tannic and acrid. Lacks some depth."
"O - a very peachy ale: a good candidate for the official state beer of SC."
"Friend of mine got this and asked me to taste it. Murky orange pour with a small white head that fades fast. Huge peach aroma with a big syruppy peachy taste. Left a bit of an aftertaste that was hard to shake. The mouthfeel was pretty good. Overall, both my friend and I weren't big fans of this. I don't like to give bad ratings, so this was a tough decision to go ahead and rate it at all."
"Rich, smooth and delicious. Medium effervescence with q fuller than medium body. Peachy aftertaste but not overwhelmingly so. Drink one, it makes a great dessert."
"O- I was expecting a overly sweet beer, but am pleasantly surprised how drinkable it is. Not sure if I could have a ton of these, but it is a nice summer brew and above average for a fruit beer."
"Flavor is sweet and fruity up front with fresh peach notes leading the way, but it fades too quickly into a halfway-decent wheat ale with a slight tinge of hoppiness and mineral water. Mouthfeel is crisp and well carbonated with a light body. Easy drinking fruit beer, this. Give 'Son of a Peach' a try if you happen to cross paths."
"O: A nice beer, the smell and flavor do a nice job, a good choice for a hot summers day. Worth a try."
"Good god was this a fantastic and enjoyable summer beer! Fantastic! I found a case at the Piggly Wiggly off of Kiawah and may buy another to take back to Pittsburgh with me. If you find it, buy it!"
"O- this is an incredibly quaffable session beer for the summertime. I wish it had more dimension to it, like some tartness or hops, which would really round out this brew."
"Cloudy off orange pour with a small white head and minimal lacing. Artificial peach aroma, artificial peach flavor. Really not much else here. If you’re gonna make a peach brew at least make it taste like real, fresh peaches, not cheap, sticky sweet ones. As you may have guessed, didn’t think too much of this one. Sticky sweet finish and average carbonation. Can't believe this is their most popular beer. The girls must love it. That's probably the only market for it. The kind of girls that used to be a high school parties with wine coolers."
"The CPJ"
"Overall, this is an average to below average wheat beer that is slammed with extract. It's one of the reasons many beer drinkers are not big fans of fruit beers."
"Overall an interesting experience and something I grabbed in Delaware because it's not available in NY."
"O: Overall an interesting beer, but it is quite one-dimensional and not terribly complex. Definitely worth a try though."
"Poured a hazy orange/honey color with a good amount of sediment floating around. Thin white head. Too thin. Strong aroma of sweet peaches. Taste is mostly of peaches as well, but from a can. The kind you would taste with all the syrup. There are some bitter hops in the finish which combine weirdly with the peach flavors."
"O: An OK beer for hot weather relief. They definitely hit the mark for a peach-tasting beer, but is not one I would seek out again."
"D: I know wheat beers don't typically rate well on BA, but this one is pretty good. I typically don't like peach flavored things (including beer), but this is done pretty well and is crisp and refreshing. It's not one that I go to often, but it's really enjoyable on a hot summer day. Fruity, crisp, clean, and refreshing ... they're easy to put down and fun to have around."
"Beer is super thin and tastes like candy has been dissolved in the beer. This worked in the aroma for me but not in the flavor. It is sweet and peachy and not much else. I'd be interested if this was sweetened artificially. Oh well."
"O: Overall I didn't like this beer. It has a peachy smell and taste which is nice, but it's flat! I would not recommend this beer, and will not buy it again."
"Thanks to jpmclaug for setting me up with this!"
"Overall, its refreshing and it delivers on exactly what you would expect from son of a peach. Beats my expectations, but not by much."
"Okay, this is what I don't like about certain fruit beers. The brewery goes overboard. It becomes a liquid candy. It becomes less like beer and more like an Orange Crush or something. This one is a Peach Crush though. It's a wheat appearance. Cloudy and with small wheaty particles floating. The smell is overpowering peach. The taste is the same. The mouthfeel is okay with good carbonation. But, overall, if you like peaches... chill one and have it. This is less a beer and more like a mountain dew of peach beer."
"O - Overall, not bad. This isn't my favorite style, but I enjoyed this one."
"ours a slightly-cloudy peach color with a small white head and a few spots of lacing on the way down. The nose brings peach character that is reminiscent of a Jolly Rancher. Very artificial. The taste is the same way, except it tastes like artificial sweetener as well. Too sweet and that's in a bad way. Not a fan at all."
"Despite the low-ish ratings, I don't think this is a bad beer and don't regret trying it. It's probably a good ""beer for people that don't drink beer"" sort of beer, but not as much for regular beer drinkers."
"Overall: a little one-sided in complexity with peaches dominating every sense. Very light and refreshing though and a nice flavored thirst quencher"
"D - Very tasty and well balanced. Might get a bit too sweet after a while, but I still think this is very impressive for a fruit beer."
"Picked up a 6pack. It was pretty pricey so I figured it must be really good. Not so much. The appearance was a hazy golden wheat color. The aroma was of peaches. Okay, good on both accounts. The taste bothered me. It was a sweet-swill. I get that it is a fruit beer, and its probably my own fault for buying it. But, I thought it was going to be more peach than sugary sucrose. The mouthfeel was fine. Overall, I would probably tell people to steer clear of this particular beer. I like some fruit beers, but this one missed the mark for me."
"Okay, as a woman I was told that I had to, had to buy this. That I would love it since its a 'girly beer,' i.e. a fruit beer. Well, let me dispel the myth. Not all women like 'girly beers.' It had an wheat gold appearance with head when poured into the pint glass. It smelled like a peach, but I'm not sure it that was artificial or not. The taste was average for a wheat beer part of it.The mouthfeel was fine. Overall, it was average. Also, had a friend order this on draft recently and re-tasted it, and the feeling was the same."
"Overall very drinkable, but maybe a little ""girly"". Finally I may have found a beer my wife will like. I'll have to see if I can find some bottles of this to take home."
"Overall- I love most fruit beers, and I love peaches, but the weird aftertaste hurts this beer. I also wish the peach flavor was just a bit less, but peach is a pretty powerful aroma and taste. Definitely interesting and worth a try."
"D/O: Slightly heavy for a summer beer but very drinkable This manages to balance the beer/fruit thing very well while not turning into a flavored malt beverage. Very enjoyable beer for summer."
"Mix half and half Son Of A Peach and a Milk Stout (I had Duck Rabbit). What results is just the smoothest, maltiest, creamiest, peachy, mocha flavor. Highly Recommended. I typically do not enjoy a fruity beer, but another patron insisted that I try it, and even offered to pay for it if I didn't enjoy it."
"D - very drinkable if you like fruit beers and in particular peaches."
"HV"
"MO- As far a fruit beers go this one is pretty good, a nice change of pace. I don't know if I would go looking for another one though."
"Pours hazy orange in body with fading white foamy head. Sweet aroma of peaches and fruit juice. I'm yearning for some malt or hop complexity with this aroma. Astringent flavors of peaches, peach skin, vanilla extract, and then the hops I'd hoped for in the aroma make an unwelcomed appearance; bitter and strange. Then the drink tries to finish with peach syrup but it's too much of a turn around from the hops. Light-medium bodied with light carbonation. A drink with no direction and strange, acrid flavors."
"D: The peach is just too much for me. I can't take a whole glass of it."
"Overall impression: A refreshing and unique take on the style. Easily recommended."
"Notes: I do like peaches a lot, but this beer is straight up peaches with a huge sweetness. If more hops and malts were added to the equation, this would be a much better example. Good, but not balanced enough"
"D - This is an okay wheat ale. The peach isn't overpowering like some fruit wheats can be."
"D - This one starts out strong in terms of appearance and smell, but quickly goes down hill thereafter... This one seems a bit forced and I'm not sure I would accept an invitation to drink this again in the future..."
"I didn't really like this at first, but it has grown on me. The feel is certainly decent. I'm not the biggest fan of peach flavor, but this isn't too bad. This is really easy drinking despite the giant sweetness that creeps up on me. I do wish this had a little tartness to it to cut through the sweet, but alas... I guess I just need to buy some more Festina Peche."
"F: Finishes semi bitter with more hops attacking. Grassy and earthy hops with a slight floral hop flavor. Most of the hops go well, but there's a slight unpleasant hop bitterness almost like hop extract that doesn't play well with others. It is mostly dry at this point as well, but has a slight sticky lingering sweetness like the syrup from canned peaches. Most of the peach flavor is gone as well but hints of remnants that I just chewed on peaches, but without skins and threads stuck in my teeth. Very crisp and refreshing beer, and the peaches are all up in your grill on the nose, but more subtle and juicy on the taste and even more so on the finish. So the nose is really where I would like overpowered peaches, and def not on the flavor so they hit that well."
"I don't necesarily enjoy peaches, but this is not over the top or under the radar. It is what it is and an excellent recipe!"
"Drinkability - a fine summer brew, very smooth and easy to knock back. Popular with all but the the most diligent of fruit beer nazis, lol."
"D: I really enjoy this beer in the midst of a blazing summer day. It's refreshing and very tasty."
"That peach looks awfully mean. Still, this beer pours a cloudy orange (almost axactly like the meat of the color's eponymous fruit) topped by a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises peach (bestill my shocked heart), wheat (whoa now, more surprises?), and a nice, creamy vanilla. The taste holds notes of wheat, rice, peach skin, and a vanilla-esque cream. Honestly, I was hoping for a bit more peachiness, but at least they didn't go overboard (I guess). The body is light, with moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. One of the better fruity wheats I've yet had."
"Drinkability: Had several of these, served in mason jars, very tasty and very drinkable. Crisp, clean, and refreshing. It is peach season here."
"d - Ok, but too sweet for me. If you like peaches and sweet, fruity beers you might like this one. Wouldn't really look to try again."
"Medium bodied. More heft than I would have guessed. Low carbonation. Kind of slick texture. Great summer beer. Some good flavor, and a very easy drinker. Of course, I'd expect no less from a beer brewed in South Carolina, the real Peach State. Suck one, Georgia."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Poured a yellow-orange with one-finger white head that reduces and stays throughout. Maintains decent lacing. The aroma of this one is dominated by peaches. The flavor starts out with subtle peach with some grainy notes with the peaches intensifying upon swallowing. Overall, this is not my favorite beer from the RJ Rockers brewery. Has a nice peach followup that is quite crisp, but also has a poor flavor up front. It is not horrible, but I am not a fan."
"Drinkability is pretty low for me. If you're going to do a fruit beer, do it right - see New Glarus. This is a mediocre attempt at best in my opinion."
"Overall: Other than the over-carbonation, this is an alright American Pale Wheat ale, and the peaches make it especially light and refreshing, though it lacks some of the toasty rich malts I have seen elsewhere in this style. This would be nice with lunch on a hot humid day in the South. The billowy head was quite nice as well and worth noting."
"I'm not sure this is entirely indicative of the drinkability but after finishing the bottle I found myself wanting more - if only to further figure out what the heck is going on with this beer. With all honesty I can say I've never had a beer quite like it. I really can't imagine it would something I'd drink frequently, but I'd like to give it another shot sometime. Recommended for the oddity factor alone."
"D: A lightweight, drinkable beer, but not something I'd return to."
"I thought this beer was just ok. Don't think I'd purchase it again unless I wanted to introduce a new craft fan into some different fruit beers."
"M&D--Typical hefe or wit mouthfeel--thin and spritzy. Easy going. Insanely drinkable. And this is coming from a guy whose closest tolerance for fruit beers was pumpkin ale. Fruit beers generally piss me off. This one is tasty. Strong summer refresher in the wheat beer category. Kind of like an American Wit."
"RJ Rockers, you are capable of making good beer. I admit it."
"Pours a hazy, bright orange with a nice looking white head. Smells strongly of peaches, which is a good thing, and also a faint aroma of wheat, just enough to let you know that this is indeed a wheat beer. The taste is something to get very excited about. The peach flavour comes through very strongly, without at all being off-putting. After a few minutes pure amazement at the peach, my head returns from the clouds and the rest of the taste comes through, with a lot of other fruity and flowery notes. The aftertaste is a very sweet peach. The body is not too full but not too light either, very good for this type of beer. The all-around greatness of this will keep me reaching for more and more, especially during the sweltering summer heat."
"Perhaps my favoite beer of theirs I have ever had. This was just sublime at times. A great, great beer."
"Overall: I was so impressed, I had a second. Very drinkable. Not sure I would want more than 1 or 2 in a sitting, but it was a nice ""walking around"" beer at the Fall For Greenville ""festival""."
"Drinks pretty easy but still a bit too fruitty & sweet to session on, but 2 or 3 would not go amiss, not bad"
"It is fruity, and it does have relative strength, so that makes for a weird type of drinkability judgement. I wish they'd make both a more powerful and a more subtle version--somehow add more carbonation with less ethanol production (move towards Festina Pesche) with a more pungent-peachy alcohol bomb (move toward something like Fort or the upcoming Sweetwater Blue Balls). RJ Rockers has something here, and they should roll with it."
"Better than I was expecting. Good enough to give it a try, but I probably wouldn't by a sixer of this unless someone asked for it."
"Pours a cloudy maize color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of amazingly fresh and strong peaches, yeast, and sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a low carbonation level. There is a strong tartness/acidity associated with this brew. Tastes of peaches up front and throughout, tart malt, yeast, slight sweet malt, and very slight hop. Overall, the peaches taste really fresh and strong, but they are either overpowering the other beer flavors or this beer lacks complexity."
"Is this a good beer? No, not particularly. But I could see it being refreshing on a hot, steamy day. It is fruity enough to hook beer novices, but well-crafted enough not to offend the more experienced drinkers. And it avoids the worst offense of many fruit beers, and that is to taste like it was brewed with frozen puree or artificial flavors."
"Taste is sharp peach extract, a wheat undercurrent, and slightly tangy metal/spice flavors. Average mouthfeel. Nice for a fruit beer. The peach and wheat go well together."
"The drinkability is nice if you are looking for a hot summer beer. This is perhaps a gateway beer, but not really my style. Sometimes I buy single beers just to have fun/taste and review. Sometimes I am upset I didn't get more. This is NOT one of those times. Unless it's the only beer in the house, I'll never have this one again."
"Creamy mouthfeel with lower carbonation for the style. I could handle mybe two of these but the sweet peach flavor would get old in a hurry."
"I didn't expect to like this as much I as did. I usually approach fruit beers with a certain degree of trepidation but I'm glad to report that this one worked nicely for me. The placement of the peach flavor was right on, being strong in the aroma but then being more balanced in the taste. Fresh, crisp, tasty, and most of all easy drinking, this is a great summertime beer."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation."
"Drinkability: A refreshing wheat beer that could satisfy all kinds of beer drinkers. The peach is authentic without being too candy-like. I'd reach for this if available."
"Drinkability: Very good for this, wheat beer with a good fruit flavor thrown in. And the fruit flavor isn't overwhelming. Recommended"
"Never really heard of a peach flavored beer that wasn't a lambic so I thought I would give this one a try. It pours just like most wheat beers....light golden, unfiltered, medium head on it. But what got me was the smell of this one, it reeks of fresh peaches and smells of peach cobbler. It was pretty impressive and very nice. So I thought that drinking it would be way too overpowering with peach flavors, but it was actually the opposite. The peach flavor wasn't too strong and had just enough so you could get flavor of the peaches and didn't take over the beer's flavor. Overall it finished very light and easily drinkable. It is a good spin on a wheat beer with a good flavor profile. Don't know if I'll have this one again, because I'm not too into fruit beers, but if you are then this one I would say is a must try."
"The low alcohol and great flavor makes this fruit wheat beer a joy to drink. I only have 1 but I'd gladly put away two or three of these bad boys."
"3.5 D: I imagine this would be good on a hot day, but some others would be better."
"Drinkability: I was reluctant at first to try this beer. I've had a bad time with fruit driven beers in the past. This Pale Wheat is the perfect summer refresher. I highly recommend it not just for the girlfriend, but the craft beer enthusiast. It tastes fresh, and could be very enjoyable as a session beer. For the witbier/hefeweizen drinkers - take a step out of your box - this beer's a crowd pleaser."
"Well done RJ Rockers, another tool in my culinary arsenal"
"Drinkability: A fine, fruit-flavored wheat ale for a pint's worth, particularly if you're a peach aficionado. Though I can't help but hold it aloft with a wink and declare it one for the la--HAHA, ah, that Ding. With only 7 reviews currently entered, he's already beaten me to that conclusion. Well, I still stand by my verdict -- Son of a Peach is one for the ladies! Which, now that I think about it, isn't a half-bad name for a beer to begin with."
"The mouthfeel is well carbonated with a light crisp body, I could drink this on a hot South Carolina summer day without a problem. Another solid offering from a solid brewer."
"Finally able to try this one on tap and was very excited. I've reviewd a couple Rockers brews before, and since they are my local beer I may be a little biased, but this one was really unique. It has a cloudy color, obviously unfiltered; I'd compare its appearance to an apple cider (which was cool). Aroma is full of peaches. I've tried a lot of fruit beers (namely blueberry ales) that smell ""fake", but this aroma seems really authentic. Taste has a little peach to it, but not as much as you would expect going off the aroma. Just a little bit alcohol as well which I didn't expect. I'm told the abv is 5.8%. Overall a very refreshing, interesting beer and one that I plan on drinking by the 6 pack over the summer. Can't wait for its release in bottles."
"	An easy drinker and something worth saving for hot weather mingling and such."
"Overall Impression: we have here a harmonious marriage of fruit and beer. The choice of peach is the perfect compliment to the American wheat beer, and it is well-presented. Perfect spring and summer beer."
"This beer ""technically"" hasn't been released yet, but I've managed to get my hands on it twice so far. Once from the tasting wall at the brewery, and once from a limited trial at Terry's a couple weeks ago. I know I've said Buckwheat was my favorite by RJR, and since I've only tried Son of a Peach twice I'm not going to refute that right now, but let's just say I am EAGERLY anticipating the release of this one! It pours a cloudy peach color with very little head. Aroma is dominated by peach which I think makes it seem like you taste more peach than you actually do. Not sure how or when they added peaches during the process, but it's certainly a unique blend of aroma and taste. This one is not overly sweet at all, especially for a fruit beer. There is a little sweetness at the end, but certainly a beer you could continuously down. Carbonation levels leave this beer crisp and refreshing. I'm sure there are some beer geeks out there that won't give this one a fair shake, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Nice job!!!"
