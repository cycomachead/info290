"Its Apple alright.. LoL I wouldn't consider this a beer more like hard cider like many others have commented about this beer. I got a six pack for free from a friend and wanted to see what the hype was about. This beer is for the folks who want to drink a beer that doesn't taste like a beer. Not a fan of this one. I hate to give this  beer a bad rating but I just don't like this type of beer. Think of it as apple juice mix with a little sour sour apple and carbonation that's what this beer taste like."
"Just too much going on to drink more than one"
"I can't see why anyone would want a apple flavored beer ever! but this beer has just a hint of apple flavor, all the flavors are good the apple, strawberry, tea, all of them good the only thing bad I would say is that you can only buy the specialty flavors in a variety pack and if you want to get drunk you would need more then the 12 pack to get there"
"One of my favorite beers"
""
"Like many others, I do like this beer although it does lean more towards a hard cider. One or two at the most are enjoyable within a short time span."
"This stuff is absolutely garbage"
"Strange taht I kept going back for more trying to taste the alcohol.  Could not find it.  Very good apple drink.  The hidden alcohol is cleverly hidden by sweetness and apples.  I better stop now.  That swishy way is goes down to easy is bad.  I could drink these fast if I didn't know better.  Too easy to drink fast."
"Awesome taste. Goes down like apple juice"
""
""
"very nice, very refreshing, clean crisp apple flavors come across simple non complex in flavor, enjoyed several of them and would buy again, not a typical beer, more like a hard cider"
""
"My drink of choice anytime"
"It's not the best beer, okay? It doesn't quite taste like a beer, it doesn't quite taste like a hard cider. But y'know what? It's pretty good, for what it's trying to be: a sweet alcoholic beverage that tastes like apple, but isn't just another cider. It does that pretty well."
""
""
"Overall- I did not enjoy this at all.  But I haven't had a good apple beer out of the three or four that I have tried."
""
"I got this on a lark, just because I wanted something a little fruity, and as I was at a diner that serves beer, and everything else was your typical light beer fare, I thought I'd give this weak Miller product a try.  The color is a light golden, very fizzy, with no head or lacing.  The smell is of tinny apple, and the taste is similar, very light and carbonated, with a watery mix of water and... beer... maybe?  Actually it tasted all right for what it is, not awful, not good either."
""
"I would have a hard time calling this a vegetable ale, or even a beer at all. However, as a Swede living in America, I've been looking for something that tastes like a Scandinavian-styled cider for quite some time. This might be it. Very sweet. Sufficiently tasty. Incredibly carbonated. Awful beer. Good for what it is."
""
"This is a glorified fruit/vegetable beer at best, reminds me more of a Seagrams more than anything else.  It's certainly better than it's strawberry ale counterpart, but not by much.  Overall, it's tasty, not much of a beer really, but it does go good with some Fire-bally."
"uhhhh....it tastes crappy. like a stale apple juice with a kick"
"Crappity crap crap crap crap"
"Overall: While it is not a very good ""beer", it does taste good enough to drink if you are looking for a cider or something similar. Probably better than the other options."
"Smells just awful, to quote another reviewer, "" like a bad yeast starter"" I am reviewing a pint can and it is super carbonated and just too sicky sweet for me. I recall having a sip of this on tap a few moons ago, but either I was drunk or it is just waaay worse in a can. Like Apple juice malt liquor."
"Not the worst thing I've ever had, and not even particularly bad aside from the aroma.  But I'm a fan of the style, and more open-minded than most, and this is just not a very good fruit beer."
"This is a decent Hard Cider"
"Looks meh but feels, taste and smells good"
""
""
"I guess it's okay if you're into this kind of thing."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a light golden color with no head and lots of carbonation. Smell is like apple juice. Taste has some tartness up front, sweetness at the finish, lots of apples in between. Feels light in the mouth and overall is more like an apple soda than a beer, but is highly drinkable."
""
""
"Great hard cider. Crisp refreshing taste. Very high drinkability definitely recommend"
""
"I personally like this beer out of its general light flavor and my accustomed taste to its sort of sweetness, although I'm well aware of the fact that this is not a high-class brew"

"I think it's a great beer for what it is; a fruit beer. Or as I think of it, a fruit ""beer soda"". It honestly tastes like a beer you'd give a child if that was a legal thing to do. I think it's a perfect beer for someone who doesn't like beer. It's a beer that should be enjoyed under a 90 degree summer day at noon when it's really bright."

"You know, this isn't really all that bad. Better than a wine cooler in my opinion. Sort of like drinking apple juice with a faint hint of beer. I have friends who don’t care for beer, but drink a ton of this. They plan on having some at there wedding, and I’ll have no problem drinking it."

"With all due respect. This isn't a beer. This is an apple flavored wine cooler disguised as an ale to trick grown men."

"The beer flavor is upfront with some cider taste as well. I like this as its got some flavor to it. Really good tasting and was refreshing in todays heat. I have never bought this but now i would."

"O-Really good apple ale/cider. I could easily polish off a case. I'm sure there are better ones out there, but for me this is great by my book."
""
"Overall (3.93) - This is my first review on the new rating system which I am not really a fan of. That being said, even though I'm caught off-guard with what I usually rate with, I'll have to give Redd's a good score. It is a refreshing and fantastic beer for those days you're not feeling like craft but you don't want a macro corn-fest. This beer goes great with anything."

"It’s ok, aroma is like apples but it reminded me of church wine. It tasted like apple juice. I had no idea I was drinking a beer when I had this. A terrible beer all around, skip this if you can. Sam Adams Angry Orchard is much better style and I recommend that highly"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If apple flavor is what you're after, find a good hard cider. This tastes like apple flavored Miller Lite, and it lacks the complex apple flavor of a respectable cider. Hell, you'd do better throwing some yeast in a few gallons of store bought apple juice and leaving it in your garage for a few months."

"i really like fruity drinks and tea and stuff like that anyway. I was always partial to smirnoff ice as a drink anyway. But this is like apple cider. and it is absolutely delicious. I was surprised to see it was made by miller. It has a strong apple cider taste and is quite possibly the best vegetable/fruit beer i've had. havent had many though. i drink stuff like 4 loko and wine too, so this was really easy to drink. would drink this again."
"Overall - it's drinkable and worth a try, but the apple is artificial feeling and smelling and more so than other apple beers I've sampled. Maybe worth a try. Ut you can probably pass on this."

"My overall opinion of this one ain't high. Wondering why it's included on the site, because it's more of a malternative than a beer."

"O: Horrible."

"I love Redd's. I hate the calories. THEY need to make REDD'S Light with about half the calories and the same flavor and taste. THEN they will have a true WINNER!!! I would also consider getting it in more places. Like Cruise ships and ball games. THE price is a bit too much as well. Be more along the lines of the rest of the beers. THE cider prices are out of line. They would make it up in volume."

"A very simple and tasty fruit beer. Slightly better than Shock Top's Apple Crust in my honest opinion. I haven't tried the Strawberry Ale to compare this to yet. Definitely has a sweet taste and I wasn't disappointed in it."

"Pours a completely clear golden with zero head. Smells like apple pie, quite fragrant and pleasant. Taste begins with some cloyingly sweet apple, then some cinnamon, and then more apple. Does not taste like beer at all. Mouth feel is ok. This ""beer"" tastes ok, but it tastes like an apple cider,not beer. I'd rather have a real cider if that's what I was after."

"O: I had quite a few weekend warriors order this at the bar this past weekend (we don't carry it, or any other alco-pop, for that matter)... the other bartender offered Unibroue Ephemere to one guest, and I laughed as I watched the couple make childish ""yuck"" faces, passing the glass back and forth before the guy, all watery-eyed, slammed back the last half, then they both bolted... I can't really compare this to any other apple-flavored beer because this is more a fruit-flavored malt beverage - I wonder why BA hasn't removed this from the site... I can't lie - it was tough not to finish the whole glass"
"Wouldn't recommend it"

"For the first few sips, the beverage was acceptable. But before the bottle was half empty, the taste became undesirable. A couple of more drinks and the hiccups started. Two hours later, I was still trying to get rid of the hiccups. I poured the remaining half of the bottle out."
""
""
"This is probably the closest thing to a soda pop beer that I've ever experienced. But, I can't rag on it. It's really not too terrible, but you'll be disappointed if you're expected beer and/or cider. The apple flavor is surely contrived to a degree, but nothing too repugnant. In comparison to the other fake fruity malt beverages or bad wheat beers out there, this isn't half bad. I might even buy one of these again sometime. It is what it is and I yam what I yam."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great summer cider. You can smell the sweet apples as soon as you crack open a bottle. Once you take a sip of this cool cider, you will be hooked. The taste of refreshing apples can cool you down on a hot summer day and make you want to drink more"
""
"O: A sessionable cider when you're not in the mood for a heavy beer or ale."
""
""
"I do not recommend this ""ale"" as mentioned by many others, this is not a beer. It seems like a product that is really intended for underaged conumers that hides the alcohol to help kids get drunk. I saw it and thought I would give it a chance, frankly it was a waste of $1.75 because I purchased only a single 16 ounce can. I feel this would be something you buy for a girl who likes it to get her drunk and increase your chances of getting lucky with her."
""
""
""
"Gross. Flat sour applejuiceish (apple juice is better) taste. Not very good.tasted like rotten apples. Not something I'd choose or even drink if it was offered to me. If you like flat gross Apple juice and don't know the difference between GOOD craft beers ( stone, flying dog, Avery, or any other craft beer) dont buy."
""
"Pours a golden yellow with NO head and no lacing either. Lots of tiny streaming bubbles are seen rising from the bottom. Looks like a glass of carbonated apple juice. The aroma is of apples of course with a hint of grain. The taste is about the same with a good crisp apple taste with a hint of beer. Goes down easy and very drinkable anytime of the year. I like this one as well as their 'Strawberry Ale'."

"I have to say, I was surprised. I bought this thinking I was gonna get a strong ale beer with little apple taste. This holds true to it's name, and I can taste the apple like it's fresh from the grove. It has no (Zero) beer taste at all. I do like reg beer but I also like carbonated wines. And that's what I feel like I am drinking is a carbonated wine with a kick. Over all, I love this. And will buy it again. The look and color is very light. And I think that's why I bought it. I don't care for strong dark beers or ales. At 5% alcohol it will only take two to get that happy fussy feeling we all love. Good job Redds!"

"This is hard apple cider brewed like ale. You can't compare it with beer or traditional ale. As a hard cider it has an excellent flavor and finish. It tastes like fresh batch cider before it begins to get bitter with age. I personally can't compare it with beer or ale because they are completely different animals. As a cider it is wonderful but as a beer it is terrible. It's like expecting steak and tasting shrimp."

"Redd's Apple Ale from Miller Brewing Co. This brew pours out of the can with no head at all. The color is a nice golden amber. You can smell the apple. The taste is sweet but not too sweet. You can taste the apple. It goes down smooth. Over all this is a good brew. Better than what I was expecting."
""
""
""
"O: I am reviewing a beer, so I'll knock this particular brew for lack of malt body, no balancing bitterness, and watery fruitiness. However to me it was also crisp and refreshing and light and didn't seem artificial. It just seemed...like a macro cider."
""
""
""
"Wine cooler in disguise of an ale. People have listed it with brewed cider. But it doesn't have that crisp apple taste that cider has. Tastes a little like Boones Farm. If you like really sweet drinks like Bud Lime. You would enjoy this. Should not even be listed as an Ale,but as a flavored malted beverage."
""

"I had one sip. blah. Had to wash the taste out of my mouth with a GR8 Lakes Monster (now that is beer)"
""
""
"I was skeptical, like many, but that all changed yesterday. I had a Redd's for the first time and it was delicious. It was deceptively appley tasting, but you could tell it had an alcohol kick to it. Wonderfully different. I highly recommend this to anyone who isn't into the traditional ""beer"" taste of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"As far as apple ales, this one is one is on par with wood chuck.... I would definitely not recommend redd's to anyone. There are other apple ales such as angry orchard and magners, that blow this watered down version away. Real shocker it comes from miller brewing.... Anyone who gave this 5/5 is drunk."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent is all I have to say about this. It has good flavor but is hardly a beer. I pours very pale in color and is headless. The flavor however has pretty enjoyable however it contained little to no qualities of beer. It is a nice beer for maybe a cook out or something like that but I would not buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"way worse than the honeycrisp from shock top, this is at least a step below, hardly beer. pours an headless pale straw color with soda bubbles popping. it smells like fake red apple, sweet and syrupy, very little grain or hops in this, if any at all. the flavor starts for just a second with some decent fresh apple, but its quickly overcome by an onslaught of sugar thats too much for me. im missing the essential beer elements again, and it feels more like a low budget apple juice with heaps of carbonation than beer. finish is all sugar, turns the stomach. the flavors are good but the sweetness is through the roof, rendering this undrinkable. apple definitely has a place in beer, and this new trend has me thinking and inspired, but this is a far cry from well made beer, its a soda pop. hopefully i wont encounter this one again but given its witty add campaign and instant popularity, thats not looking particularly likely."
""
""
""
""
"You'd be hard pressed to actually categorize this beer as beer. Based on nearly every quality about this apple ale, it should more likely be grouped with Mike's Hard and the like. Upon tasting, flavors had almost no complexity or bitterness. It is very sweet. I would call Redd's a hard cider, or maybe even a hard apple juice."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a very nice ale. Smells good like apple juice with some alcohol mixed in. It is pretty carbonated and orange in color. The taste is crisp and of apples and easy to drink. Although this is not something i would get drunk on terrible hangover and after mourning taste of pure coffee it has happened more than once to me. It is perfect for a hot day or occasional drink the price is good to so i do recommend this ale."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall - a decent apple beer, an easy drinking beer."
""
""
"I drank all sorts of beer,did for years ( darks,lites,full flavor and less filling ) and noticed that all domestic beer started to taste the same so I began buying the foreign brews . I tried Redds apple ale this past weekend expecting wine-cooler copy but was pleasantly surprised. The taste was crisp from start to Finnish and is one I will continue to buy and turn my friends and family onto."

""

""

"Redd's apple ale is awesomely refreshing. Taste best with a glass of ice while taking nice hot bubble bath. I don't drink anything else. If you want to get drunk, It gets the job done without making you sick. It taste great and doesn't hurt your tummy like other beers. It must have real fruit because it keeps people regular as well. I don't a beer gut, or a hang over the next morning."
""
""
"Pours a transparent yellow color with no head and no lacing a lot of fizz like a soda. Smell is rank like rotting apples in a field. Taste is sweet apples with no complexity, spice or bitterness. Absolutely no hop taste. This not a beer but more like a hard cider soda."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, to me it seems like a cider with carbonation. Overall, there aren’t a lot of beer-like qualities to it and therefore I didn’t score it very low."

""
"O - Overall i did not care for this Ale. It was week tasting and seemed watered down to me. Despite being weak the mouthfeel stuck with me and took over everything else. It left almost a film in my mouth. The apple taste wasn't terrible but certainly not excellent. I wouldn't care to have it again."
""
""
"Looks like carbonated apple juice. Is it weird that the carbonation bubbles are sort of spiraling upwards instead of heading straight up? No head to speak of. Good clarity. Smells VERY sweet. Think Musselman's apple juice. The taste? Musselman's apple juice with an alcoholic kick. Mouthfeel Is fairly carbonated. Fail."

"My Girlfriend decided to bring this home one night wanting to give it a try. It tastes like an extremely sour beer from a rotting corpse. The taste of this ""Apple Ale"" is more like ""Asshole smell"". I do not recommend this ""Apple Ale"" to anyone."

""
""
""
"If you like apple then this is worth checking out. It's good. it's cheap. And it's incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day."
""
"Clear very light golden color, no real head to speak of. Smells like apple cider and a skunks ass. Tastes really artificial with apple sweet tarts or apple antacid being primary with a stewed grain aftertaste. No hops to speak of, no real ale character, what character is there, remains a despicable apple tinged disaster. Slightly heftier than light bodied, spritsy carbobation. Cloying, artificial, yet insanely popular. Hard apple cider is fine, but this is a totally different concoction. Avoid."
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a smooth very light bodied beer that goes down easy if you can handle the apple flavor."
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not."
""
"O: Ok fruity drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank this straight from the bottle. Appearance was a clear pale yellow. Smelled like an apple cider. The taste wasn't that bad. Tasted like cold apple cider. It was kind of refreshing on a hot summer Indiana day. The mouth feel was thin and fizzy. Overall, it is nothing to rave about but if I was in the mood for something with a different taste this isn't a bad choice."
""
"All in all, I tried to keep an open mind. But I don't think this ought to be marketed as beer. It ought to be in the same vein as Mike's Hard or Smirnoff Ice products. I'm sure it has it's audience, but as a beer, I rate this bad."
""
""
""
""
"Decided to try this because it was on sale. Not necessarily a good reason - I understand that - but I'm glad I did. While this has the apple aroma and apple juice taste I expected, I must admit that it is also quite refreshing when imbibed ice cold. The mouth feel is light and crisp. The finish is much more pleasant than a cider and is great in the Florida summer heat."
""
""
"O- This is a pretty tasty drink, but it's not beer. It couldn't even be a gateway for people to get into 'real' beer because it has no beer flavor to speak of. A fruity, crisp refreshing drink that is mislabeled and advertised as 'ale.'"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I did not care for this beer at all. It smelled of apples, but as soon as you take a drink it tasted like apple juice. Very disapointed in this beer. Just goes to show, just because there's a big flashy advertising campaign, you can present a turd in a golden wrapper, but it's still a turd."
""
"I tried this ale with no research going in. After the first few sips I thought it wasn't to bad, but after this ""ale"" warms up to room temperature the flavor becomes disgusting to me. I found that I have to finish these quickly due to the better tasting part disappearing so quickly. The smell is that of sort sort of chemical mixed with low quality apple juice. Just by reading some small print at the bottom of the sticker on the bottle, one can see that Redd's Apple Ale is an ""Ale with natural apple flavor and caramel coloring."" Immediately this made me realize that I'm most likely drinking unhealthy high fructose corn syrup (Just speculation), and most likely some sort of strong apple concentrate. However, I would recommend this to someone who wants the alcohol content of beer, but can't stand the taste. It falls into the same category as a Mike's Hard Lemonade, but I personally believe that it doesn't have the flavor to compete."
""
"Easily my favorite ""cheap"" beer. Many cheap beers have a bitter taste even for beer. This one, has a fairly sweet and crisp taste to it. Like an apple. To me it pretty much does look like a normal beer, a yellowish color and all, but don't let that fool you. It's one of the tastier cheap beers out there."
""
""
"12 oz bottle into a lambic flute...because I'm a loser. BB DEC0913. Pours a crystal clear light amber body that sort of resembles apple juice? Plenty of rising carbonation but with zero head. Aroma is that of stale sparkling apple cider with a lingering unidentifiable chemical. This was not meant to be smelled. Taste is at least pleasing. Apples like the freeze dried kind found in Quaker oatmeal mashes up with some light malt sweetness and a faint spice. It's not horribly fake tasting or at all offensive. It's actually somewhat tasty and drinkability is high. Mouth feel is crisp with flavors fading away quickly. Unlike ciders its not syrupy or too sweet. Smells awful, tastes all right. It's not the worst thing ever."
""
""
""
" alcoholic drink I would much rather have an Angry Orchard hard cider."
"Not a bad alternative option from miller coors. Saw a single can where i play lottery and figured 'what the heck.' poured into plastic cup halfway thru. Much better out of can chilled. Will buy again when i want something different. Paired well with takeout pizza from Casey's."
""
"I tried this in a pick 6. This in no way resembles an ale. It's sort of hard cideresque, but more like apple juice meets Zima. There are no hops at all. It's pretty sweet. The only qualities it shares with ale is that it has bubbles and is golden in color. All that said, it's not a bad warm weather beverage. It is moderately refreshing and a happy little buzz."
""
"Ice cold on a hot day this can work but otherwise I'm staying away."
""
""

"Hot day on the golf course and an ice cold Redd's! Excellent! Plus it is going to help save the Apple industry. Anyone thinking that it is going to taste like a regular ale did not read the label for Apple. It may not be your every day always go to hear but it is extremely refreshing what you are hot and cold. I would guess that nine out of 10 people that I have had try it enjoyed it also and they are true Dear drink. Don't be afraid to give it a try you will enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"not bad, just confused. clear bottle (?), pours thin, no beer-like head or lacing. goes down like a carb'd apple cider. sweet. a bit too sweet for my tastes, but not necessarily unpleasant. i don't see or taste any beer qualities whatsoever. my friends insisted i check this out (""it's awesome!""), so i finally tried it, with reservations. i'm not sure why it says ale on the bottle, it clearly (pun intended) isn't, but on a hot summer day, it might hit the spot. i'm rating it against what i think miller is trying for, because if i reviewed it as an ale, it'd be a flop."
"This tastes like a carbonated cider with artificial flavoring and no actual beer quality. It leaves one perplexed as to how to rate it because it is sweet and easy to drink and if one was looking for easy inebriation this will do it. As an actual ale, perhaps brewed with apples it is not but a drink to get your girlfriend drunk, it's a sure bet."
"Atmosphere is fair. Lots of effervescence but no head or lacing. A little sour apple and that's it. Similarly, light and crisp body with a light sour apple flavor, and synthetic sweet finish. Overall, this is a serviceable quaff."

"This beverage surprised me. Its not overly flavorful which works to its advantage. It tastes like diluted carbonated apple juice. Its not heavy like cider and it doesn't taste like a beer at all. But, it goes down easy and is very refreshing. This drink will fill a similar niche as Mike's Hard, but for people who prefer apple flavoring to lemon. I had mine out of an ice cold bottle. I enjoyed it. I won't be stocking my fridge with Redd's but who knows I might be ordering one at a bar next time I'm sick of light beer."
"Best served ice cold. Appearance isn't bad since it does have a nice golden color but smell is somewhat like baby wipes and apple juice. Reminds me of a day care. Taste is like a light lager beer flavor with a cider-apple taste mixed in and mouthfeel is like water. It is smooth and thin and goes down easy and best of all, no bad after taste. It's certainly not the craft style beer they try to make it out to be but on a hot summer day or after yard work, this might be a nice refreshing way to cool off. I most likely won't buy it again but at roughly $1 a bottle, it wasn't a total waste."
"O) Not very good, and quite frankly I can think of no reason that I wouldn't plunk down a few extra bucks for a real fruit beer option from New Glarus Brewery."

"Redds Apple Ale is delicious, but I will never buy it again. I admit to feeling fooled by the ""ale"" label. Let's be honest- it is a cider. Another reviewer said it best- it is carbonated apple juice. I expected a mildly fruity apple BEER, which is not what I got. This is the same reason I hate Nutella- I really hate being lied to (Nutella because it claims to be ""healthy"" but I digress). If I want to enjoy a refreshing bubbly cider, I will pick up some Angry Orchard which at least has the decency to mix it up with interesting flavors. I wanted beer, not the equivalent of Mike's Hard or Smirnoff Ice. I did give it a high score for mouthfeel because I loved the bubbles on my tongue. It was delightfully carbonated."
"saw a special for 2 pint cans for like $3, so i figured i'd give it a go. i'll say this: redd's is not a fruit beer...or if it is, there were some serious missteps made to ultimately put this in the same league as mike's hard beverages, smirnoff ice, and so on: ""malt beverage"". it tastes like carbonated apple juice, which isn't a bad thing if you just got done doing yard work or any time you're trying to cool off. not a beer, but not wretch-worthy like some folks are saying. it tastes like juice...last time i checked, a cup of juice never made anyone go on a rant."

"One of my favorite Beers from Miller Co. Even that I'm a huge Coors fan!"
""
"Thin and watery with too much carbonation. This is terrible. I'm sure it would seem even worse if I drank it side by side with New Glarus Apple Ale, which I like very much. This beer isn't even close to being as good as the New Glarus offering."
""
"Overall it is Miller Lite and Apple Cider, I fail to see the point."
""
"Overall- This is not beer and should be marketed as a cider. That being said the flavor wasn't bad."
"Redd's is HIGHLY drinkable, but nothing about this reminds me of beer. It drinks like hard apple juice, which isn't a bad thing, but as a beer, it's awful. I prefer this to something like a Mike's (I find that to be way too sweet), so that's saying something."

"Bottom line: I know this isn't supposed to be ""good", but I'm not going to apologize for drinking it once in a while."
"This could have been really good. We had a cider press when I was a kid and threw the old apples in and squeezed the juice out and let them ferment. This could have had that kind of taste but missed it. Not bad on a hot, summer day, but could have been so much better."

"Well, stale bread is what is used for panini and ""rotten apples"" is the smell of cider so I'm not sure how that stands as a complaint. I feel like beer advocate has a lot of folks lining up to prove themselves to the beer community but this is a weird place to do it. This beer is drinkable in the right circumstances but hardly the new bold flavor we beer snobs are seeking. Still, I don't get all the hate."

"12oz bottle, drank from the bottle. The ale is caramel in color, aroma smells like apple juice, some faint grain. Tastes very sweet, much like apple juice, a bit cider, very faint caramel, grain, and yeast, overly sweet, especially on the finish. Mouth-feel is very thin. Overall, I'm glad I didn't purchase this myself, but I was curious to try it. I did drink the entire bottle, but I didn't enjoy it too much."

"As i finish this review there are good points to this beer the color is good as well as me being able to hold it down. However the taste and smell of it would make me drink a Red Dog. I'm not saying its a good fruit beer nor is it a bad one but they could of at least tried to make it the way the market it."
""
"O: You could have a light beer, or you could have a hard cider, or you could have a Four Loko but Miller thinks you'll choose this. Good luck Miller."

"Redd's Apple Ale ---2/5."
"I think I overrated this. This is horrible. Is this beer or a sweet fruity malt beverage? I'm leaning towards the latter."

"Here we go Redd's the commercials are funny the beer is an apple ale a combination of an ale with natural apple flavor and caramel color. Fizzy white head dwindles to nothing in no time at all, large bubbled fizzy carbonation disappears in literally no time at all, apple juice looking body. Aroma apple hand soap or shampoo with tart sliced natural apple flavoring, no real signs of beer. ""It's not a cider"" (in my best Arnold from Kindergarten Cop ""it's not a tumor"" voice, it's Redd's Apple Ale, dammit...the flavor is of stale beer and natural apples is not overwhelming nor is it beer it's pseudo cider. When I grow up I want to be made of real Fuji apples not some concentrated apple flavoring that was naturally made in a chemistry lab. Body is light with fizzy carbonation really not offensive I wish I could tell you this was as tasty as any of the Angry Orchard or more established ciders out there however, it's just not...it's a Miller fabrication brewed by Redd's Brewing Co. in Albany, GA."

"Rating this as a fruit beer? What a joke."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a pale apple juice amber with very little head, but a ring around the glass. Aroma is a light apple juice and an unidentifiable, somehwhat off-putting vegetable odor, it might be the light malt interacting to the apple in a way that I was not expecting. Flavor is mild hard apple cider mixed with light sweet malt. The same oddly flavored interaction between the malt and the apple juice flavors affects the taste as well. Light bodied. The flavor combination did not work for me, but fortunately, it is all so attenuated in flavor that it is not difficult to finish. I was also lucky that we got our first really warm day, so a cheap, light tasting 16 oz. can filled a niche in the day. I was fooled into to buying this beer from the ""new"" brewery ""Redd's Brewing"". I now know this is one the of the many BMG fake brewery names. The good news is that at least I have reviewed my first Miller product. Tick. Glad I did this one after mowing the grass, it was at least refreshing while dehydrated."
""
"At first taste, I was disgusted. But it was because I was expecting almost like a very sweet wine cooler. But I was hit instead with what tasted like somebody mixed a miller with apple juice. It takes a couple swallows to get used to the taste. After a bit the flavor starts mixing a lot better. Definitely tastes like a cider. I like the sharp feeling carbonation, making the mouth feel rating for me very high. Nothing great overall, but it's not half bad."

"The Redd Apple Ale was a light coloring an smelled fruity especially of apples and a little kick of citrus. I liked it because it did not taste exactly like beer and it was very sweet. It had a good cider taste to it and the mothfeel was good as well."
"This was another single bottle purchase I notices at Kroger. I would not buy this again because I'm not a big fan of sweet and/or fruit flavor beer and this was just that. Personally I would/could drink no more than one or two in recession. I am also unaware of the nutrients but I would imagine it would turn me further away."

" If I have anything good to say about it, it's that the appearance was good enough to get me to buy it. I'm glad I got it on sale. I'll keep it in the fridge for when my brother in law comes over; he'll drink anything."
""
""
"This is what it claims to be. It's apple through and through. It's a bit tart and tastes exactly like apple cider. It achieves what it set out to achieve, but I'll definitely pass in the future."
""
"Overall – I am not sure what part of this is actually an ale. This tastes exactly like a sweet hard cider to me. Not bad, but more sweet cider like then beer like that is for sure."
"Overall its really not as bad as I had anticipated. Refreshing for the summer but still not as good as a cider. Drink it before it warms."
"If you want a cider: get a better cider. If you want a beer: don't get this. It's not so bad that I don't recommend you ever try it, but I can't say that I will get it again."

"Pass. Why is this even considered beer? If you want something like this, go with a higher-end apple cider or perry, not this apple flavored ""ale."""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, straw coloring with no head and a ton of carbonation bubbling. Aromas of apple sweetness, with not much else behind it. Cloying, oversweet nose. Flavors of apple tart and sweetness, with a slide unbalance to the sweet side. Leans itself more towards a cider than an ale based on the palate. The aftertaste is slightly spiced with light cinnamon, but the apple tart and sweetness overtakes anything as you drink. Sweet, cloying finish that is lightened by the carbonation. The sweetness builds as you drink, which can overpower and make this beer difficult to session."
"The beer pours a normal macro pale yellow color with an almost non-existant white head. It smells like a regular light beer with lots of adjunct and a hint of apple. Tastes like someone poured apple juice in my keystone light, that's about it on the flavor. It has a light feel with moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Well, I could drink more of these, but wouldn't really want to. The guy that owns my local beer store suckered me into to buying the 16oz can."

"Overall: I was excited about it and hyped up due to the positive appearance and smell but it stops there. If you are looking for a beer to look at and smell without the intention of drinking it, I would definitely recommend Redd's."
"Thoroughly disappointed, will not buy or drink again. Shame on you Miller for tricking me into buying a nasty hard cider."
"O: Not sure why this is not a cider or malt beverage (like Smirnoff Ice) as this tastes and smells just like apple juice without the slightest hint of alcohol. I would likely never have another one of these as it seems like it is not a beer at all - even though they market it as a beer with the crispness of apples. Very easy to drink and I could see this being dangerous to folks how get it knowing they do not like beer."

"my girlfriend says it tastes more like an apple wine cooler than a beer. I agree."
"I know, I know ""On a hot day..."" Sorry I'd rather have a chilled glass of real apple juice. Avoid."
""
"Overall, an average/slightly less than average brew. I might not turn one down when offered, but I seriously doubt I'll ever buy it myself. If I am looking for the apple flavor, I'll stick to Woodchuck or Angry Orchard."

"I give this a 1.25 overall because it doesn't taste terrible. I can see non-beer drinkers or people who opt for sweet, gross mixed drinks when they go out giving Redd's a try and enjoying it. As for everyone else, skip it and go for a hard cider or something if you are looking for an apple fix."

"O - not enjoyable."

"Overall, very unimpressive, and not very refreshing. If you want sparkling apple juice, there are much better options than this. If you want beer, this isn't going to do it for you."

"Saw this beer as a Super Bowl ad and was surprised to see it in the store the next day. The beer in my bottle looks nothing like the beer on display here: Mine is a bright golden color. The smell is of cider. It tastes like perhaps an apple shandy, that is, it tastes like cider and beer mixed together. It was not unpleasent, but I enjoy beer with more body (and hops)."
""
"O: There are really no beery qualities to this whatsoever. Even as a cider it's fairly awful. The cider market does seem poised to explode, but really this is solidly in the malternative category anyway. Why market it as a beer at all? It makes no sense to me."
"Overall: Not a great smelling or looking beer, but has an ok, if sweet taste. Obviously trying to capture some of the non beer drinking crowd. For that purpose, get a real cider instead of this one."

"My wife picked up a single bottle as part of a make-your own six pack. She was almost interested in trying it (she doesn't like beer), and then I opened the bottle, took a whiff, and the overwhelming stench of apple cider vinegar assaulted my nose. I allowed it to come up in temp a few degrees, and the flavor got far worse. Way too fizzy, pale yellow, and like one other reviewer stated, I think it actually gave me a low grade migraine. I only rated it at a 1 because there isn't a 0 or less than a 1. Ugh, I rank this in the 'why did we waste the money' category."
""
""
"I'm not sure what possessed me to make this purchase, but here we have a brilliantly clear deep golden liquid with a small smattering of white bubbles that disappears almost instantly. The aroma is initially sulfur and apples with a hint of brown sugar and cinnamon. Its hard to find anything ale like in the aroma, this smells like an alcopop cider. The flavor is wow pretty bad actually. Brown sugar mixed with apple flavoring and a headache inducing artificial sweetener flavor that I can't get out of my mouth. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet sickly artificial mouthfeel. I couldn't finish this."
"I was interested to try this beer and wasn't surprised to discover it was Miller after I'd had it poured for me. For the masses into bland, weak and watery beers, this works if cider's too much."
""
""
"O - Redd's Apple Ale barely passes for a beer with apple flavor as opposed to a cider with a splash of malt (which it basically is). New to the scene, this ale drinks like a lager, and hops on the trend wagon of ciders but, without a memorable, unique product, all that's left are their ads and I have a feeling people will move on. That's not to say it's a bad product, Redd's Apple Ale is just forgettable."
""
"Taste is very cidery, but less sweet than most, and a slightly more ""beer-like"" finish. Not horrible to the taste, but I wonder about all the seemingly artificial ingredients, and still question how this qualifies as ""ale""."
"Goin' for my third apple ale, the second with the focus being more on the apples than the malts (ostensibly...I mean, who know how far they went with ""flavoring", right?). This stuff pours a clear pale amber topped by a a half-finger of short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose is a blast of watered-down apple juice, with a vein of mild caramel in the distance. The taste pretty much brings more of the same, but with an increased sense of blandness. Honestly, I expected a cider-like quality of apple with some spices or something, but this takes the spice-less path and them some. To sum: watered-down apple juice that wasn't all that great to begin with. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a feel I can only describe as sorta/kinda creamy. Overall, I just didn't get this beer. It certainly eschews the cider route, but it also goes away from the apple-y beer route as well, coming across as, like I've said before, a watered-down version of apple juice. Not my thing, this."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a pale amber color with only a momentary head as it basically looks like slightly carbonated apple juice. The scent is mild with the standard apple cider aroma. The taste starts off with a decent apple flavor but quickly turns kind of sour as it finishes. If you are looking for a good, easy to find cider then go with Angry Orchard. If you are looking for a good apple beer, then go with New Glarus Apple Ale. This beer leaves a lot of room for improvement in volume and in taste."
""
"Redd's Apple Ale pours out a clear golden color with plenty of visible carbonation, but a small head that drops to nothing quickly. The aroma is a strange mix of apple cider-esque note and adjuncts. It works, but just barely. The taste is really just like a sweet apple cider at first, but it brings in just a bit of a beery kick on the finish. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, a decent change-up on the cider formula that brings a bit of beeriness into the equation. Still not as good as many other ciders, but at least it tastes good."
"Presentation: Packaged in a clear glass twelve-ounce glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice. To judge by billboards that I have seen in Texas, this beer may also be available in forty-ounce bottles."
