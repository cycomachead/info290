As a go-to beer, many people will probably by-pass this as it just doesn't satisfy the taste buds like either a light summer beer or regular lemonade would by themselves. You get more of a slightly sour, past-its-prime skunky beer flavor more than anything else. I don't know. Why ruin a good malt beverage by adding lemonade to it?

3.44,4.9,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Single bottle from a craft beer "pick six" setup poured into a flute. Not my preferred beer style but the completist (or obsessive) in me wanted to try every offering in the current Sam Adams summer pack and rumor has it that this tastes at least somewhat like a real beer as opposed to some limp dick 30% beer 70% juice blend (sorry, that's a cooler, not a beer). A darker than expected yellow-orange gold rather like ginger ale, with an initially large frothy white had that dissipates almost instantly. The aroma is not bad (!), some of the rich cereal notes one expects in a Helles, the expected lemon rind and oil and even a faint whiff of grassy noble hops. On the palate the lemon is tastefully done, not overwhelming the light malts, and there is also a subtle candied ginger vibe, and the hops seem to combine with the fruit to yield a sweet lemongrass tea effect. Not particularly sour. A bit heftier than expected in terms of body, accompanied by a pleasingly moderate degree of carbonation (although one's biased expectancies do yield a slight desire for more fizz). As mentioned, not a shandy guy but this is a nice revelation, even if I would not purposely seek out this brew again. Its a candy beer but one with some grain to shore it up.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 12, 2014"

It is a light beer that has been lightened even more with some lemon soda or at least lemon flavors and water. Why? I don't know and I won't be looking for this one again. If I want a shandy, I'll mix my own and at least not have to pay full premium beer prices for something that was conveniently watered down before I bought it!

I can definitely taste lemons, which is something that's not found in many beers. After my taste buds got over the shock, I must say Its one of the best I've had. I poured it from a bottle into a British pint glass. It has a small white head that faded quickly but has left some lacing. The color is clear amber. This beer is perfect after a day in the sun.

With that said, Samuel Adams' Porch Rocker is a near flawless example of a Radler; a well-made beer blended with lemonade that's neither artificial or overpowering. It's crisp and refreshing aroma make for a lively smell that leads right into a light kiss of lemonade tartness balanced with a bright and malty helles lager in the flavor. Still beer-forward, it's hard to ask for a more refreshing or sublime marriage of the two.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 17, 2014"

This was not enjoyable as I expected. I have had other 'radler' type beer mixed bottles before that seemed like a better hybrid than this - I prefer something with more beer and less lemon soda in the taste.","Slatetank","May 03, 2014"

Couldn't see it working in anything below 60 degrees outside. Carbonation good, beer neither too light or too heavy. I'd say my score goes up 1/2 grade on this beer when its 90 degrees or above outside.","Beerandraiderfan","Jun 12, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth and refreshing, but the flavors couldn't hold my attention, I could probably drink a few of these on a warm summer day, but the flavors don't really keep me coming back for more. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, it really needs to be toned down in this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, I would rather have Summer Shandy since it isn't so sweet, I would recommend this to shandy lover who don't mind some sweetness with a shandy. All in all i wasn't that into this beer, there was just to much sweetness for me and it ended up being too overpowering and it made this beer drink much more like a lemonade than an actual beer. I appreciate the attempt but it just didn't come together as well as it could have, better luck next time Samuel Adams.","StoutHunter","May 30, 2013"

The head quickly disappears, and long chains of bubbles rush up through the brew. The smell is notable even from a distance. Huge Lemon scents....It smells more like a lemon soda than a beer. If you hunt, there is a bit of malt underneath, but but not a lot. The taste is similar...very reminiscent of lemon soda, with a little hop finish. Interesting...not bad...but not quite beer either. It's got huge flavor...lots of lemon, some grass and grain, hops in the mid-taste through the finish, and a little malt underneath. Interesting, but not my style. Light in body.

The mouthfeel is a little weak, smooth, but no necessarily in a great way. The taste is maybe just a little to fruity for my taste. I would like it to be a little crisper, and a bit more subtle. The bottle says the inspiration was from German cyclists who mixed beer and tart sparkling lemonade. This Porch Rocker was inspired by that. I wish it would have been crisper, a bit more tart, that would have added a little more substance to it.","justincolts","Apr 03, 2013"

Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is mostly lemon peel and lemon candy (like lemonheads?), along with a bit of sweet malt. But it's mainly an artificial lemon aroma, not that it smells bad at all. The brew tastes like slightly sour lemon candy, and there's also some sugar substitute noticeable. Tastes a little worse the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's easy enough to drink, I guess. Mostly average overall, I only tried this because one of my friends gave me a couple bottles.

I'm not sure what happened, whether to blame a taste-change or the brewery, but each Samuel Adams I try is filled with an unbalanced mixture of hops and malt. The lemon in this tastes very unnatural. I was disappointed with the Whitewater IPA this year as well, and Noble Pils hasn't tasted the same to me either. I will not be purchasing this again. It sits low in the fruit/vegetable beer category, and I would much rather drink a Leinenkugels Summer Shandy when it comes to a refreshing summer drink spiced with lemon.","Jesse13713","Jun 17, 2012"

Givin' it the ol' college try: It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of short-lived fizzy white foam. The nose comprises lemon peel, light cardamom, and what may or may not be cracked wheat. The taste leads off with a stark and somewhat artificial lemon flavor, followed quickly by a somewhat wheaty apparition that intertwines with the lemon for the duration, the two toning each other down a bit whilst working their conjoined way down the gullet. It's not necessarily bad, but not something that stands out as being particularly tasty, either. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation (bordering on fizzier) and a slightly watery feel. Overall, an okay neo-radler at best, something I wouldn't purposefully reach for again, but also something I wouldn't really spurn if offered to me in passing.","TMoney2591","May 18, 2012"
