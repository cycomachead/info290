3.76,-1.1,3,3.75,4,3.25,3.75,"So my rating of this is based on what it is, not what other beers are (kinda how it should be, right?). What we have here is the perfect summer day beer (which I tried in the winter...). A beer that shandys likely were designed to emulate. My rating is also a little all over the place. First off, the beer looks tragic. Barely fizzy piss. Perhaps drinking straight from the can is a good route to take.  Get past the look and take a whiff to find a pleasant fruity fragrance that seems far less contrived than most shandys I have had.  Move on to taste and it is light, fruity, refreshing and crisp. All this at 2.5%!!! As for finish, here's another bonus - not cloyingly sweet as the taste may suggest!  Look, this isn't something you will crack open and have an intellectual moment over, but if you have a summer drinking marathon in your future, you have GOT to get a few of these. Especially if that marathon starts before noon!","gopens44","Mar 03, 2015"

Scents of grapefruit flesh, with just the slightest hint of sweet malt. Not much to the aroma, but it isn't bad, I do love grapefruit. Taste begins with a big hit of sweet grapefruit soda, still slightly sour as one would expect, but sweetness balances it. This prevails throughout, with a little bit of a bitter grapefruit flavor on the finish, though extremely faint. Aftertaste is sweet and faintly bitter grapefruit flesh. A good flavor for a radler, very fruity, full of grapefruit flavor and refreshing, though lacking in the beer flavors. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a slightly tart, puckering feel. The after swallow feel is like after eating grapefruit flesh. Quite nice and very refreshing. Overall this is a good beer for what it is, a radler. It is refreshing, fruity and crisp and does its job well. Not bad.","Auraan","May 16, 2014"

Truly, what it's intended to be... two-fifths beer and three-fifths summery non-beer drinker's delight. Notes of lemon flesh and green apple fight to be tasted. Very refreshing. I'm drinking it on a warm, muggy evening; but I think the beer would look and taste better if it had a golden stream of sunlight shining through it. My only complaints are that it's a tad too carbonically acidic, it lacks much depth of flavor, and it's a bit of a burpy nightmare.

What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, I think it would be a little better if the sweetness was toned down a little and let more of that grapefruit tartness shine through. I would buy this beer again, but I think I would mainly get it in the summer since I think it's very fitting for the season. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fruit beers, shandys, or grapefruits. All in all I was happy with this beer, it had all the makings of a good radler and besides the higher sweetness I thought it was pretty sessionable. This be made for a decent first impression of this brewery and I'll have to keep an eye out for more beers from them, nice work guys.","StoutHunter","Nov 03, 2013"

The balance between beer and fruit juice is pretty heavily on one side. But it is pretty clean and drinkable. I could imagine on a hot day next to a lake this may be a pretty favorable choice and a good crowd pleaser especially when there are people who may not drink a lot of beer around. Also the low ABV is nice, you can have one or two and feel good. Continue about your day without feeling sluggish. I won't go to grab more, I was satisfied enough to try it though.

Stiegl Grapefruit Radler isn't the sort of beer that is going to be knocking many BA's socks off, but it's still a fine radler that stands strong when compared to most other light, sessionable fruit beers. With its aerated, spritzy mouthfeel, miniscule alcohol content and a flavour that reminds me of a good (non-aspartame-sweetened) version of Fresca, this stuff barely even qualifies as beer - but it's still delicious, and I must therefore give it some well-deserved props. People buy light fruit beers because it's hot as hell out and they want something tasty to quench their thirst - not to experience the complex range of malt or hop flavours/aromas typically found in beer. This particular brew is a very solid choice for anyone in the aforementioned situation, and if you handed me one after a day of sweaty, exhausting work, I'd be one happy panda, that's for sure.","thehyperduck","Sep 09, 2013"

I would not rush out to buy a six pack for a single sitting, but its a great palet cleanser for a night of beer tastings. Its also extremely refreshing for hot summer nights. One can, or pint will usually do you good for 3-4 other brews. My wife likes beer, and loves this beer, so it is a little girly if you ask me.

Mouthfeel was thin, not watery, but very effervescent on the tongue. The taste was more sweet than tart, which was a negative for me because I like tart and not sweet. Finish was closer to tart, but I was still left with a sugary sweetness. I would CANsider this more of a novelty than a beer, but on a hot summer's day, it could be quite refreshing.

The first thing to hit you is the fresh grapefruit smell. Just like slicing a grapefruit in half and sticking your nose right in. It's summertime in a glass. I got the sensation I get when I bring a gin and grapefruit to my nose. It's amazing how much this smells like real grapefruit. The taste is light, sweet, very intense grapefruit (without the sourness) and a nice, extremely light beer finish. The aftertaste is light and short and leaves you wanting more.

3.87,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured from a 330ml bottle(?). Pours a cloudy orangey-white, like a hefeweizen. The smell is like fresh-cut grapefruit and grapefruit peel. Very natural smelling. It has mouth-filling carbonation which is nice and refreshing. There's not much typical beer flavour, but it has a nice tart finish to it. WIth the low alcohol content, it would be easy to drink a lot of these.","CookstLiquor","Nov 29, 2012"
3.17,-16.6,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall: not exactly my bag, this radler. The aroma is pretty enticing, but once you get into the flavor it kind of falls apart. Perhaps it would be better on a really hot day or something.","flagmantho","Nov 10, 2012"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Very bubbly, clean & light. Lots of grapefruit aroma and flavour. It doesn't have the sweetness of an alco-pop, but the beer-like flavour is certainly watered down. The grapefruit is a nice twist on the classic Radler. Really drinkable thirst-quencher.","Derek","Oct 27, 2012"
3.6,-5.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I knew I wouldn't turn down a free pour of this (hell, I'm one of the apparent few that actually likes the lemon version), but I didn't think I'd actually be offered said pour. Fair enough. This stuff pours a lightly hazy golden-straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose is a dead ringer for a can of Squirt or something, though faint hints of barley and grass sorta try to get themselves implied as well (with varying degrees of success). The taste brings in more of the same, though the grapefruit actually is tempered by a general sense of malted grain, keeping things less sweet than they could otherwise have been. The body is a very light medium, with a fairly active carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, it is what it is: a grapefruit-flavored pre-mixed radler. Yeah, it's sweet and carbonated like a soda, but it somehow doesn't overdo things too much (it definitely makes you rethink where the brink is/was/will be). I can say with some confidence that I (somewhat surprisingly) enjoyed this stuff.","TMoney2591","Oct 22, 2012"
3.47,-8.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy bone colored head that fades to nothing. Tiny dots of lace slolwy drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grapefruit juice, sugared grapefruit, and some slight malt aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight sourness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite refreshing but not too beer like in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 19, 2012"

3.27,-13.9,3,4,3.25,2.25,3,"11.2oz green bottle, pours a fizzy, hazy yellow color with a thin white head that dissipates as quickly as a soda - maybe because it is half soda. Aroma is actually pretty good with a zing of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Tastes are tart and refreshing with grapefruit juice being the dominant flavor. Some biscuity notes come through from the lager with some lager yeast present on the finish. Mouth-feel is thin and fizzy, overly carbonated. Overall, not my favorite by any means, but it is definitely refreshing. It is a summer staple in our house as it is one of my wife's go-to's.","barnzy78","Sep 06, 2012"

I love grapefruit, and grapefruit hops notes, but the few grapefruit juice infused beers I've had have been terrible. Here, the light, almost airy beer married very well with the grapefruit. Exceptionally hazy, like a super-yeasty hefeweizen. Clean grapefruit juice aroma. Moderately sweet, balanced nicely by the grapefruit bitterness and slight acidity. A nice example of a low alcohol German quaffer - it cries out for a hot, lazy day.","Brent","Aug 18, 2012"

Nice and light on the palate. Refreshing and crisp. This is a tough beverage to review. On one hand, it's simple, easy, lacking depth. Almost like a soda. Mediocre. On the other hand, it's highly drinkable with a tasty grapefruit quality and it's especially suitable for the summer months. I could definitely make my way through several of these while playing bags, darts, watching football, or doing some equally distracting. I would certainly have this again.","Huhzubendah","Aug 12, 2012"
