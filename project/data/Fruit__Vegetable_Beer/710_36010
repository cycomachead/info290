Lemon beer sounds like a hideous combination admittledly but this is good stuff.  I usually like beer from a glass, but here I prefer drinking from the can or bottle.  Technically, this isn't good beer but a good shandy and should be judged as such.  This is much better than the 72 rating would suggest.","Urizen","Oct 17, 2014"

Perfect for drinking by the pool side or in the hot sun. So much better a choice than a BMC IMO. As the sun begins to set, so too, set this aside for something more robust and interesting. But in the heat of the day....very cool.","Sipchue","Aug 01, 2014"

Its a Lemonade flavored light beer but very disappointing. I thought it would taste like beer and Lemonade mixed but instead it tastes mainly of Lemonade with a slight hint of beer taste. I have tried other flavored beers such as Samuel Adams Blueberry beer and its right on. Its equal alcohol and blueberry taste. I will stick to plain, non flavored light beer. I recommend this beer to anyone who doesn't like the beer taste yet wants to drink a beer. I would drink this again as long as its free but I won't buy this again.","snitsky","Jul 28, 2014"

3.66,16.2,3,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Overall: I'm surprised by the overall rating on this beer. I think this beer is fantastic. It think it's the ideal party beer for both craft beer lovers and ""non-craft"" beer drinkers. I think this beer can be appreciated by the masses. It's not amazing, but it's LEAPS AND BOUNDS, better than all the lime flavor lagers produced by the big guys. This was one of the beers that made me start to appreciate the finer beers.","EvoRich","Jul 02, 2014"

The smell was mostly lemons but with a little bit of malt. The taste was similar with a lot of lemonade but a subtle finish where you get a little bit of hop and malt to make the end of the beer not so sweet. A fine shandy to drink on a hot day.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 28, 2014"

I swear, you could sell this stuff at a lemonade stand and kids wouldn't know the difference. It tastes like lemonade -which is fine if you like your beers sweet and artificially flavored- but I don't. I bought a 12 pack of these and now I feel obligated to drink them. Maybe I'm being too harsh, the beer is great for being lemonade flavored, but why did I just buy lemonade-flavored beer?","colinlikesbeer","0"

Its a strange combination, like it doesn't know it it wants to be a beer or a mike's hard, but if this is the type of flavor you are looking for you will probably like it.

3.17,0.6,4,3.75,2.75,3.25,3,"Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy (2013) - I'm a big fan of the Shandy and summertime is the perfect time of year for this typical part fruit juice (normally lemonade), part beer, and a dash of honey brew typical of turn of the century Eastern European brewery's. The beer goes down much easier than it is to pronounce. Excellent thick foam head and strong lacing. Deep Weiss wheat yellow color. Full and cloudy body. Carbonation is good but not rising. Frothy in nature. Typical lemon shandy aroma. Minute maid with a dash of hops. Crisp light mouth feel. Very light beer in nature. Honey and lemon nose. Lemonade and lager mid-palate. Good hops skunk. Well lagered but ""lightened"" by the juice over tones. Back palate its all sugar water and just a hint of malt. A little oak. Not crisp. Dare I say wet. Almost too watered down on the aftertaste. My home mixed Shandies tend to have more bit on the palate. More malt. A thickness associated normally with the syrup of soda. Less wet. More sour. Maybe I'm picking a bit heavy here, but the Saranac Summer Shandy in this case from 2011 was much better. I would still pick this over a Mike's Hard Lemonade which has that ""manufactured"" feel to it. Too much sugar. Not enough beer. 3 out of 5. Okay. Needs improvement. Saving grace is a good lemon to honey balance along with high drinkability. I would kick this back while doing yard work or maybe just sitting by the pool. BBQ will wreck it and over power it-- Be forewarned.","digitalflood","Jul 08, 2013"

Pours a cloudy lemonade color with a couple finger head that doesn't last, almost no lacing as the glass goes down. All lemon on the scent. More lemon on the taste than I would like for the style, I expected a Weisse with a lemon hint not a mixture of beer and lemonade.

I love how real the lemons taste, not artificial at all, and I think the proportions are right. ive been recently appreciating the shandy style, and this one is sort of the original in the united states. I like it much better than many other leiny offerings, and would be happy to have this constantly on deck all summer, especially in the mornings and early afternoons. really this is pretty good.","StonedTrippin","Jul 01, 2013"

However, I will give it high marks for being quite drinkable and refreshing. Otherwise nothing special.","damndirtyape","May 27, 2013"

Very soft and wet, with just a hint of carbonation. The taste is light and is comprised of lemon, honey, and melon. Not overdone on the fruitiness like the vulgar Magic Hat #9. I'm enjoying this beer by the pool in Las Vegas, which is how it was meant. The low reviews this beer is getting, I regret, are from folks who are too serious and not regardig the context in which they make their reviews. Lighten up a little. Get it?

Flavors are very lemon heavy, with a tart, effervescence that hits the sides of the tongue and the roof of the mouth like someone poured a Fresca into a wheat beer. Smooth, roasted wheat backbone that supports the lemondrop sweet main palate. The aftertaste is tangy and syrupy sweet, like you just ate a bag of lemon Jolly Ranchers. The finish is smooth and light, with a slight effervescence to it, as well. All in all, I can see how some people like this, but it is definitely not my mug of beer.","GarthDanielson","Aug 23, 2012"

The retention was only so-so though it did stick around as a collar and the lacing was scattered.The aroma was of lemons with hints of floral hops behind that. The flavors too were dominated by lemons but as it warmed up I tasted some crystal malt and a light note of bready malt. It started sweet but finished dry helping it to be a highly refreshing beer/shandy. The body was medium/light, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation a bit prickly.","thekevlarkid","Jul 27, 2012"

Not bad, but definitely a summer beer. Not something I can drink all the time. Carbonation was off, and the taste was on the ""watery"" side.

Hints of wheat maybe? not sure if it is brewed with wheat or if my brain just wants to think so. Sugar water with a slice of lemon on the side, a grainy corn is on the after taste.

Smells heavily of lemons, but there is general beer malt in the smell as well. Tastes of a lemonade mixed with a good adjunct lager, but not offensively. This light bodied beer is very smooth, carbonated correctly, and quite a bit could be consumed without realizing it. Overall, a slightly above average beer.","cyclonece09","Apr 05, 2012"

Overall what can I say - I like this as a summer quencher and could probably enjoy this year round it is really decent if you enjoy arnold palmers or tea coolers depending on what you refer to them as. The malt is mild and the lemony flavor refreshes in a natural way. I consider this pretty decent for what it is.","Slatetank","Aug 06, 2011"

This reeks of lemon zing to the point that I get little else except a whisper of fresh hops and grain. But I gave it a 3.5 on the aroma because it didn't smell artificial.

Short of that, this beer didn't have the typical flavors of a good unfiltered wheat ale, which it tries to resemble. I liked it better than their Sunset Wheat, which was too sweet and cereal tasting for my liking.

However girly it may be, it is a delicious and refreshing beer that manages to eliminate all of the negatives of a malt beverage like Mike's Hard or a flavored beer like Bud Light Lime. There's no lingering sweetness, and isn't harsh on the stomach acid wise. You can taste the beer and the lemonade, but neither are bad. The flavors don't taste fake or forced. Great refreshing beer for a summer barbeque.","Ahoyhoyindeed","Jul 11, 2011"

I'm not sure how well it compares to them as I have not sampled Blue Moon in many moons and Shocktop has never touched these lips.

3.6,14.3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a 3/4"" white head. Hazy lemonade yellow colored body. Smells like lemonade. Taste is pretty much as to be expected half weiss beer and half lemonade. Although there is some lemonade sweetness I don't personally think it was even a fraction as sweet as a typical off the shelf lemonade. Plus if it had instead been predominately beer with just a little lemonade spike it would be been more like one of those BMC's with lemon or lime twist.

It smelled like it, too, that or Lemon Pledge. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was a sugary lemonade. I would have preferred it to tend more towards tart and/or dry, but the inherent sweetness was not to my liking. Finish was still too sweet for me to really get behind it. I am a member of Leinie's Lodge, but I am not putting this in my canoe (unless Pocahontas is coming along and she would like to drink it, in which case ...).

The flavors too are of premixed lemonade with a light and dry malt finish. There isn't any complexity but it is what it is. It's insanely light and easy to drink. This is a great summertime option if you're wanting something non-BMC and with some flavor.

The taste of the beer is again a lot of lemon with just a little bit of grainy malts in the distant aftertaste. The mix of Lemonade and beer for me don't really mix too well. I'm just not a big fan on Lemons or Lemonade for that matter. I can see someone who enjoys those beverages may enjoy this a lot.

In that respect, the main difference is the appearance. It's a shandy, so it is what it is, it's simply not a well-made one given that the lemon aspect overtakes all but the slightest inkling that this is a beer. It's a lemon soda with slight beer character. Shandy's not a beer purist's dream come true, but pick up a Stiegl (sp?) if you're going to get one.

Its a cloudy beer but it has some creamy head and lace. This would hit the spot after mowing the grass in the hot summer sun. Serve this one cold. It says it is Weiss beer with lemonade and that is exactly what it taste like. They get an A+ for nailing what they set out to do. This should be graded by its style which is a style of its own.

This beer is exactly what it's name implies, a Shandy, and thats how I grade this beer, not as a typical fruit beer. This is the only commercially available Shandy I have seen, most of the time Shandy's are DYI recipes, so I like the fact that it is already mixed and the fact it comes in cans helps also. I tend to keep this in my fridge all summer for those afternoon disc golf games, they are nice and refreshing and don't get you too buzzed, it just has great drinkability.

It pours a hazy white grapefruit topped by a half-finger of short-lived white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, wheat, and what could theoretically be construed as coriander. All of these elements come through very meekly. The taste holds notes of lemonade, grapefruit juice, lemon peel, and slightly funky wheat. It all comes across as something akin to a crappy bottle of Squirt or something. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a grainy-ish feel.

Now if I am looking for an actual ""beer", than I am not going for the Shandy. That is the point - the Shandy is a beer made perfect for specific conditions. It is extremely easy to drink, so it's a good session beer. The color is perfect for summer - a nice cloudy yellow with a white foam head.

A wheat malt balance attempts to balance out the lemonade character, but falls a bit short. Looks timid on the wheat with a slight haze, fizzy head formation and low retention levels. Straw colored and over-carbonated; quite spritz-y. Flavors are dominated by the lemonade sweetness and tartness with, again, lacking wheat beer flavors. Lightly bready, underhopped, and a timid barley / wheat base malt flavor keeps the beer acidic and one-dimentional. Textures are light, crisp, and a bit thin, but certainly refreshing and thirst quenching. Finishes, well, lemony with that mild bread base. Palate cleansing and ready for the next sip.

3.15,0,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale wheat scent along with a citrusy lemon zest. The taste is average. It has a very light wheat flavor. It's a bit watery and is covered up with a lame lemon essence. The lemon flavor is weak and doesn't lend itself well to the rest of the palate. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is not a very good seasonal at all. It should have more lemon flavor as well as more malt content. This comes across as a weak wheat ale with an even weaker lemon content.","WesWes","0"

Taste is likewise - this one's nearly lemonade it's so overwhelmingly lemon. Less wheat than the flavor. I guess a hint of spice, although that might be being generous. Body is medium, solid carbonation. This one's about what you'd expect; a simple, overwhelming flavor. I guess I could throw back a bunch if I needed to.","soupyman10","Sep 07, 2007"

I can smell a bit of lemon, and a small bit of the weiss part of spices. Taste is at first a carbonated weiss beer with lemon, and spices but then the faint, watered down taste of lemonade pops into the senses. Not really a very welcome taste when I am trying to drink a hefeweizen. I will say the crisp carbonation is refreshing on a hot day, but the beer is not my favorite.

In the nose you can easily notice wheat, and the zesty, sugary lemonade. That's what you taste, too - lots of citrus, and enough lemonade to be pretty refreshing. In the mouth it's OK, a little dry. Overall, it's not what a serious beer drinker wants, but it does the job it's set for, and it goes down really easy.

3.4,7.9,3,3,3.5,3,4,"This one pours a hazed pale lemon-tinged yellow color with a bubbly white head and sporadic lacing in the tall pilsner glass. The nose is of light wheat grains and lemonade powder. Not bad at all, just unusual for a beer. This smells of summer. The palate is actually considerably better than I anticipated. A solid American wheat beer with lemonade accents that, in my mind, could have easily been overdone. They're not. Subtle lemonade flavors intermingle with the light, palate-friendly wheat beer to create a summer refresher. I'd wager this is what Leinie's had in mind. Mouthfeel is light and unchallenging, as expected of the style, but it's not to a fault. The easy mothfeel and finish, with only a slight citrusy bitterness, add to the clean cool attitude of this beer. Exceedingly drinkable; this beer is made for the summertime. This is one you can drink on the cold side and not lose a lot of flavor, since it's really pretty staightforward in terms of flavor profile. I have to say I've been impressed with a couple of Leinenkugel's beer of late, but none more than this one for it's sheer ease-of-use and originality. Enjoy this one at your next summer party or picnic. If you're looking for a world class beer, this aint really it, but if you want something that is a unique change of pace, you might just dig it.","beerphilosopher","Jun 07, 2007"

The taste was bad enough to make Kool Aid Man gag. It tasted of the most artifical lemon flavor mixed with flat soda water. The mouthfeel was terrible as well, because the carbonation was doing a nasty number on my tongue. The overall drinkibility was awful.

The head was almost non-existent which could have been operator error on the part of the kids bartending. But all in all it was refreshing on a warm day which is its intention. It wasn't overly sweet even though it was incredibly flavorful and it didn't have the astringency usually associated with poorer versions.
