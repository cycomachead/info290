It's not the greatest crafted brew I've had and the taste devolves/diminishes shortly thereafter, but its stays alright.

The aroma is very pleasant and is like a fresh blueberry tart. The taste is pretty much the same with the blueberries and wheat right up front. Not as sweet as you might think though. Very smooth with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. A very refreshing brew with a great flavor for most anytime of the year, though the warmer months might be a tad better.

Tastes about as sweet as it smells, a little on the sweet side, but not what I'd call overwhelming. Doesn't have that syrupy taste of some other fruit brews I've had. I have to say, the blueberry tastes like it's well blended in the malt, doesn't taste artificial or like it was added after the brewing process. If you're looking for hops, though, look elsewhere. I personally enjoy this one, I'm a bit partial to blueberries. Great choice of a dessert beer, or paired with fruit.","thefullmontiii","Jun 12, 2014"

Lacing is minimal. Well, it definitely smells like blueberries. There is a slightly acidic aroma as well. Malty taste when you first sip, followed by strong acidic taste and heavy blueberries. There is not much else but blueberries to taste. Not really my style. If i remember correctly, I didn't really like it the first time I tried it either.","jngrizzaffi","Jul 20, 2013"

As far as blueberry beers are concerned, this one is slightly better than others I've had (for instance, it didn't have actual blueberries floating around in it when it was served to me). Anyway, the color is pretty enticing with a deep gold and a short, soft head. The berry flavor is a bit strong for my liking, though. Just a little too sweet.","MarkQ617","May 21, 2013"

The nose has plenty of blueberry aroma, with a light bit of wheaty grain to keep things interesting. The flavor profile features the wheat a bit more, and the blueberry tastes very artificial. There's plenty of it there, but it noticeably comes across as being a bit fake. I'd be shocked if all the blueberry here come from anything besides some kind of extract or artificial flavor added right at the end of the brewing process. The mouthfeel is fairly decent, with just a little bit of fullness to the body and enough carbonation that the word ""sparkling"" comes to mind while drinking it. There's definitely an audience for Blue Dog Wheat Ale, but having had several beers brewed with real fruit, and made one of my own, something like this just doesn't cut it for me.","axeman9182","May 03, 2012"

Light malty taste, with blueberry and more blueberry flavor going on, with the most subtle touch of orange zest. A little bitter from some floral-seeming hops, giving a dry and somewhat bland aftertaste. Wheaty, but not too harsh or acidic, which is good.

It's not baked goods, it's not real blueberries, it might be a blueberry candy. It could also be the berry flavor from Captain Crunch. It's tasty regardless. The beer is crazy thin, even for a wheat. It's drinkable though because it's very tasty and flavorful. I could probably drink a bunch of this. It's very sessionable. I like it enough.","aasher","Apr 14, 2011"

There is a heavy sweet blueberry nose, with toasted cereal characteristics. The blueberry smells are real fruit, too...not syrupy. The beer is semi-sweet, with blueberry and slight citrus flavors highlighting a toasted oat flavor in the forefront. The body also has some wheat characteristics. The body is very light and creamy smooth, yet crisp. The aftertaste is sweet and tart blueberry, with some cereal/oats characteristics, also. The finish follows suit with the fruity theme, but the general sweetness lingers a little bit longer, eventually giving a clean break on the palate. The sweetness makes this a low-number consumption beer, but great on a hot day.","GarthDanielson","Mar 07, 2011"

Atlantic Brewing used to have the best 'Blueberry Ale' when it was actually brewed in Bar Harbour, Maine, but now that it has reappeared in recent years, I believe it has lost it's quality through the contract brewing process.

Light to medium-bodied, crisp and heavily carbonated, not very sweet even taking into account the bodacious blueberry presence.

Bitter and almost a slight metallic edge to it. No strong wheat characteristics to it at all. Feel is like standard beer with just a little more bubble perhaps. I can't say it is overly drinkable due to it's lack of grace or any smooth qualities whatsoever. I love blueberries, but this is not something I really enjoyed or would go hunt out again.

No sythentic or syrop detected, true blueberry profile. For sure they must add them to the mash. Left me with the taste of blueberry pancakes/muffins all day. Mouthfeel with a lot of barnyard/farmhouse presence, slightly dry and perhaps a little musty. Not ""fruity"" in the sense of fruit-lambics, nothing ""fruit juicy"" about it.

The liquid is clear, unobtrusive gold color with a negligible head. No hop aroma (or at least its not discernable through the berries).

Cloyingly sweet...I'm pouring blueberry flavored syrup into my mouth. In the middle of the taste, more traditional beer tastes assert themselves, namely hops, but are quickly chased away by the sickingly sweet blueberries in the finish. The aftertaste is like sucking on a blueberry. Drinkability is horrible due to the overwhelming blueberry sweetness. I've had blueberry beers that I've really enjoyed (Bar Harbor, for one), but this is not one of them. I like the blueberry flavor to stay in the background as a nice subtle flavoring.

Not surprisingly, blueberries were the prevalent olfactory note, with a light undertone of malt as well to prop it up. On the palate, the blueberries cannot be ignored, but there was also a touch of lemon as well as a light cherry note, strangely enough.

However, the wheat flavor is such that it cuts through the sweetness so as not to allow it get cloying. Mouthfeel could be a bit heartier, for a wheat brew, and drinkability is good.

The singularity and artificiality of the blueberry in this beer is a bit much to get me really excited about it.","Stopper","Nov 17, 2003"
3.69,7.9,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Well I bought this for the other half and she really liked it,me well it was ok.Poured light golden color with a almost non-existant head,aroma was Boo-Berry cereal in a glass artificial blueberry and toasted malt aromasNow saying its artificial doesnt really bother me it actually smelled decent I think,flavor was of malted wheat and blueberry not to overly bad but I wouldnt get again I dont think.","oberon","Oct 30, 2003"
2.81,-17.8,3,2,3.5,3.5,2,"Tastes of blueberries of course. Leaves a bittersweet aftertaste. This is similiar to their raspberry wheat ale but the blueberries are tart and offer more bitterness, adding to the complexity of the taste. Medium bodied with a decent aftertaste. A decent ale but I will probably leave the rest for my wife.","ViveLaChouffe","Sep 04, 2003"
3.62,5.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a thin, white head that doesn't stay not leaving any lace. Pale golden color. The nose is a strong, sweet blueberry and taste is a strong sweet blueberry with the malts and some hops. Nice clean crisp finish. Very good fruit beer, light bodied.","jdhilt","Aug 16, 2003"
3.32,-2.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Normally don't drink the fruit beers but this was in the fridge and I said what the hey lets give it a shot. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Straw color with a medium white froth. Smell was just blueberries I couldn't get any other type of smell from this. Taste was of sweet malts and blueberries, not a bad taste. It was a tad too sweet but after a little while you get used to it. All in all it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.","Running4beer","Apr 17, 2003"
4.14,21.1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Normally I turn my nose up at fruit beers, but in this case I will make an exception. The reason for this exception is simple... I can mix it with Guinness! For those of you who have never tasted a ""black and blue"" as some call it, treat yourself. It mutes the Blueberry beer's normally overpowering sweetness and becomes an entirely different animal.","ChrisBowers","Apr 12, 2003"

2.74,-19.9,3,4,2,2,3,"The only good thing about this beer was its nose: definitely blueberry. As far as taste, it might as well have been a bottle of bud light with an essence of blueberry. There was really very little special about this beer. I wouldn't waste my money on this one again.","Admiraldinty","Nov 18, 2002"

3.34,-2.3,3.5,2,4,3.5,3.5,"The flavor is blueberry all the way through, in good proportion to the wheat & malt. Definitely grows on you as you drink it. The finish is a nice blueberry - wheat grainy malt balance. A very tasty fruit wheat beer, once you get past the nose. Definitely better straight from the bottle IMO.","sponberg","Sep 28, 2002"
3.8,11.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Same straw color as the raspberry beer. Thin faint white head, lasted a little longer. Smell was more subtle on the fruit side and better defined beer wise. Some noticable malt taste, then big blueberry kick. Grainy taste is also less noticable. Stands alone better than the raspberry beer. Light bodied and refreshing. I suggest mixing this one with a stout as well, makes for a nice summer refresher with some body.","StevieW","Sep 09, 2002"
3.55,3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: A pretty good fruit ale with some character on the side.","Jason","Apr 17, 2002"
