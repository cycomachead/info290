Aroma is sweet, raspberry, strawberry & faint cranberry (in that order) in a malty background with a hint of plastic. Taste is medicinal, very raspberry (jam like) & other red fruits, caramel malt, reminiscent of mineral water, cherry cola, Luden's Wild Cherry cough drops. Tart, bitter & musty finish with a phenolic, raspberry, black cherry & bitter aftertaste. No hop presence. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, wet & drawing with a little prickle.

4.15,-1.9,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"2015 vintage. Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a deep, vibrant, ruby coloring with a tall, frothy, pink-tinged head that quickly settles out into a frothy surface coating. Aromas of richly sweet and subtly tart raspberries, almost identical to the smell when you are making Jell-O and add the hot water to the powder. Really all encompassing the nose, but if you dig there are some hints of candi sugar and a bready backbone. Flavors are all raspberry forward, richly sweet and with a subtle tart character that puckers your mouth just a bit. The beer is big, with a dry undertone that makes you want to drink more. Really smooth and tasty. Some subtle bready and sugary notes are mixed in the palate, as well, and work as perfect accent notes. This is an insanely drinkable beer. The ABV is extremely hidden. The aftertaste is a subtle linger of the raspberry fruit notes, leading into a smooth, lingering tart and dry finish. This is a tasty damn beer!","GarthDanielson","Beers"

This beer has nice drinkability, it's smooth, slightly refreshing, the alcohol is hidden well , it's not too filling and the taste does a good job at holding my attention, I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, but I might attempt to drink a whole bottle.  What I like the most about this beer is that  it showcases the raspberry in all it's glory.  What I like the least about this beer is nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change.  I would buy this beer again if they release it again and I got a few bottles in the cellar to see how it changes over time.  I would recommend this beer especially if you like raspberry beers.  All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I though rubaes was pretty damn good, but this one just raised the bar another notch and Founder did everything right with this beer.  It's not a favorite founders beer, but it is my favorite non sour raspberry beer.  Great job guys, this is one awesome beer, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 19, 2015"

Great nose that let you know what you were going to be in for.  Taste was raspberry.  Great raspberry taste that was not overly sweet or medicinal.  It tasted pretty natural to me.  What I found interesting was that with the sweet nose and taste it ended pretty dry which made it a lot more enjoyable to me.  There was some carbonation almost fizzy like.  I was really impressed by this considering I am not a huge belgian fan.  I did not think the alcohol was hot rather I thought it was well masked.  I brought a growler of this that night.  It was a great beer to sip by the pool yesterday!  I will get this again and pair with some chocolate cake or something similar for a desert!","VTR","0"

4.3,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2/2015. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lightly tart raspberry, red grape, plum, apple, pepper, candi sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, raspberries, and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big tart raspberry, red grape, plum, apple, pepper, candi sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness and yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raspberry, red grape, plum, apple, pepper, candi sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, raspberries, and moderate malt sweetness; with an awesome sweetness/tartness/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible imperial Belgian fruit beer. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, raspberries, and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2015"

It pours a beautiful ruby red with minimal head.  Then the first taste...light, delcious and full of real raspberry taste (unlike my lucious experience).  No crazy bitter after taste and was truly a delight for my tastebuds.  I would most definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a raspberry ale.  one thing I really like is that even though it's got a high abv (9.2%) it doesn't taste like it.

Sweetness comes crushingly across the palate, wiping most other things away.  Do NOT expect anything sour or tart out of this guy, aside from the natural bite and pucker of the fruit itself.  The only thing that could catapult this to the next level would be if they would barrel aged it, or deepen it with a darker, more chocolatey malt bill.  That would be just craziness though, so ignore that.  It is superb as is, don’t get us wrong.  As a bit of commentary, we find it entertaining that we our only now getting to try the 2011 effort, as they ramp up to rerelease Blushing Monk next month, in March of 2015.  We should have waited to do a side-by-side, but something tells me the memory of this beer won’t soon fade from our minds.","TheBrewo","Feb 02, 2015"

I never give a 5 for appearance, but I have to give love to a beer that is movie scene blood-red. While pouring from the bottle, one gets a big nose of raspberries. The initial taste is raspberries. One really get the tart of the raspberries and can almost sense the skin of the fruit on your tongue. If I did not know it was a beer, I might have trouble recognizing it. There really are not many of the elements of beer present. There is not much carbonation or maltiness. One might get a hint of wheat. In this respect, It reminds me of the New Glarus Belgians. However, I still detect beer in the New Glarus line. The tart raspberry continues into the aftertaste. The beer is one-dimensional, but I still enjoyed it.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 01, 2012"

The beer is very sweet (at least the perception of sweetness is there from the berries), but there is a nice tartness to balance it out.

The more I drink the more I think it tastes more like a raspberry liqueur than a beer. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, heavier than I would have imagined and fairly sticky. It's a nice fruit beer, but I would prefer something a little lighter and not quite as sweet.

The mouthfeel was light and I definitely wouldn't have known this was a 9.2%abv beer if it didn't say so on the bottle.

Random chunky streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. A very striking looking beer. Smell is of raspberries, raspberry juice, other berries, and some malt notes. Taste is of raspberries and other berries, berry juices, and a subtle malt flavor that ties everything together. Some tannin-like aspects in the flavors. This beer has a very wine-like mouthfeel with a coating quality in the mouth. The carbonation is nice and the beer is dry on the drink down. Overall, this is a good fruit beer with a nice raspberry/berry presence. I think the smell on this one is better than the taste though.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 25, 2011"

4.27,0.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Bottle: Poured a cloudy deep red color ale with a large foamy head with good carbonation and some good lacing. Aroma of freshly pressed raspberry with light sweet note is quite incredible and close to the New Glarus beers in terms of aroma. Taste is also a super good mix dominated by loads of pressed raspberry with light tart notes and a well balanced sweetness level. Malt backbone can be felt though doesn’t’ play a huge role. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I wasn’t expecting this much from a fruit beer and couldn’t understand the hype. I know do.","Phyl21ca","0"
4.1,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Bottle. Popped open a bottle by my lonesome tonight as I really wanted to try this one and it sitting in my fridge was way too much a temptation on a friday night. Pours an extremely dark rosie, red color with a deep reddish pink head. Hmm, ever so slight belgian yeast esters upfront that then gets dominated by a hard core raspberry aroma. I have a feeling on this one that the taste is going to follow the nose. Raspberry, raspberry, and a touch of additional raspberry. Head settles to form a pink collar around the glass. As with the nose, their is a slight belgian flare to this that quickly transitions to a full frontal assault of raspberry flavor. Tart and sweet. Slight bitter in the end. Leaves the mouth feeling like it just ate something really sweet. Medium mouthfeel. I need to try this next to New Glarus Raspberry Tart to see which I like better, but this is really good as a sweet fruity beer.","kbutler1","Oct 22, 2011"

4.2,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to jdiddy for pulling this out of the cellar. 750ml bottle served in a chalice. 2006 vintage. Pours a brilliant, translucent claret hue with no head. Big raspberry aromas, as well as a slight, earthy character. I cannot express how much raspberry you get off the nose. Taste is fantastic - raspberry dominates, but there's also an easy, pleasant tartness, some acidity and a slightly medicinal quality. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a crisp carbonation. This is an amazing and dangerously drinkable beer (the earlier vintage weighed in at 12.6%). Having tried the 2011 vintage immediately following, I have to say that age has done some wonderful things to this brew. If you can pick up a couple bottles, definitely cellar one for several years.","Jwale73","Sep 25, 2011"

Overall, this is pretty good but suffers a little on the drinkability due to the heavy dose of raspberry and the syrupy body.

With the flavor as well, there was a lot of raspberry with a bit of belgian character. This beer is to raspberries what cerise wishes it could be to cherries.

Juicy sweet taste, raspberries aplenty--you can almost feel the grit of the seeds between your teeth--tart sensations on the tongue, grassy, with subtle hints to the malt and yeast at play in the distant background.

3.38,-20.1,4.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Blushing Monk pours an impossibly deep plum. It's almost solid when held to light, with only very faint ruby highlights shining through. The first pour yielded barely two fingers of foam, while the second pour manages to churn up a full three fingers worth. Retention is alright, and there's a fair amount of lacing, but the color of the head is what really grabs attention. It's the offspring of lavender and a dark pink/light red shade, and it's much more vivid than the head from any other fruit beer I've ever seen. The nose is quite potent, and it screams raspberries, with just a little bit of sugary sweetness present as well. The flavor is just as one note as the aroma, and it really gets old as I make my way through the bottle. The flavor is exclusively of sugared up raspberries, and people referring to to the beer as alcoholic raspberry soda aren't off base at all. The body is a little flabby, especially for a Belgian brew, but the sparkling carbonation is perfectly suited to the beer. This is one that would be much better served by a smaller serving size, as the all out raspberry assault quickly gets old.","axeman9182","Aug 15, 2011"
4.15,-1.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is an extremely interesting and, in many ways, excellent beer. The raspberry character is fantastic and dominates the flavor and aroma. It's almost a little too much, in fact; a little more "beer" character might be nice, although the Belgian yeast helped with that. The sweetness also could be a bit much at times, so I would recommend this as a dessert beer. Also, although it hides the alcohol well, this is a strong beer and best split between two (or more) people. All quibbles aside, though, it's very nice and a good bet for a special occasion or change-of-pace beer. Recommended.","vtfan77","Aug 15, 2011"
4.03,-4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pretty maroon-red color with nice purplish-pink head on top. Nose is not as overly sweet as some describe, but a blast of tart, fresh raspberries hits. With more exploration some of the malt comes through with a bit of alcohol, but really this is just a fruit bomb. Flavor is quite good, not cloyingly sweet, but sweet nonetheless. Just robust fruit flavor here, like fresh raspberries. Somehow it is balanced out so as to not be overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium, not too heavy and sticky, but not too light like a champagne or something. Moderate to full carbonation helps to keep this one from becoming too sticky. Overall, I like this beer, but I don't think I would want more than one. It's good, and a damn fine fruit beer, but not a beer that I'm going nuts for.","LordAdmNelson","Aug 14, 2011"

4.38,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep, blood red with about an inch or so of bubbly, purple head. The body looks nearly black in the glass, but retains an ominous red glow when held to the light. It looks absolutely stunning. Smells, as one might suspect, of raspberries; crisp, refreshing raspberries - without the artificial sugar scent - dominate the nose, but some yeasty, belgian-like scents escape the depths and are vaguely noticeable. Taste is very similar, being primarily of fresh raspberries, so much that it reminds me of homemade raspberry jam. It is slightly sugary in the mouth, but the carbonation helps it from being overly-so; it also seems to bring out the tiny bit of belgian pale character that lies beneath the surface, as some yeasty notes can be found rather readily after the raspberry punch subsides. A small amount of warming alcohol lives at the end. The carbonation is great, and helps the beer finish slightly dry instead of sticky/sugary. Overall, this is the best fruit beer I have ever had, and I feel fortunate to have been able to try it.","eclipse54","Aug 08, 2011"

It pours a deep, dark ruby topped by plenty o' relatively short-lived dark pink foam. The nose comprises rich raspberry, light black cherry, and red grapes. Damn, now that's a lot o' raspberry, fella! The taste holds notes of straight raspberry (as though you're biting into a bunch o' fresh ones), very light cherry, cranberry, and currant. A light tartness pervades, but doesn't get very strong at any point. At some point, the cranberries seem to take over. I never thought I'd say this, but there might be too much berry-ness in here... The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, I get that this is supposed to be a berry bomb, but I think they went too far this time. There is no semblance of any base beer, or of any Belgian character, for that matter. Just berries, berries, and more berries. I thought I liked berries, but this was nearly too much for my own good.

First sip was pronounced raspberry, almost cloyingly sweet at first, and then rapidly shifting gear to moderate tartness. Belgian character of beer was largely overshadowed by the fruit flavor, with candy sugar being the most noteworthy contribution. The fruit flavor was simply overwhelming - the sort where a little bit goes a long way. Perhaps as an after dinner digestif this would be good, but no quaffer here.","Brent","Jul 31, 2011"

It tastes of sweet raspberries, first and foremost, with a moderate tartness and a Belgian yeast finish. It offers complexity in terms of raspberry, offering every aspect of the fruit, but the beer itself is dominated by the raspberry. It is delicious and is like an imperial framboise.

Half the glass and my palate was numbed, I wasn't pulling anything else of this glass at that point. Normally it's the alcohol that's numbing, but in this case it was the ingredients. That said, if you are a raspberry freak; then my friend, the eagle has landed. Outrageous raspberry fruit beer, but I would have liked some more complexity.

Interesting, dark pink head(never seen that one before). Smells strongly of sweet fruit, like rasberry (duh) or strawberry. Tastes a bit like a wine cooler (not that I've ever had one!), but something holds the fruit back from overpowering. Part of that must be the mouthfeel, which is a little thicker and less carbonated that a wine cooler. Geez, the alcohol is well hidden. This is not my favorite style of beer, but it is tasty and refreshing on this extremely hot day (meanwhile, I'm sitting in A/C).","DrStiffington","Beers"

A little fruit seed in the flavor as well as some very light tannin. The more I sip, the more this justs tastes like fermented ripre raspberries. Yum. I have to say, for the style, I prefer New Glarus Raspberry Tart at about half the cost and constant availability.

There is some slight yeastiness on the backend of the flavor, but for the most part this is just a raspberry assault that is absolutely beautiful. Some light earthiness, especially in the feel.

The taste closely follows the smell, with the sweet raspberries more apparent on the initial taste, and a more tart, drying finish…quite pleasant. This is a brew that I couldn't drink regularly, but as a dessert beer (cherry/peach cobbler come to mind), or maybe even paired with fruit salad, this beer would be perfect.

Some strong malt flavors as well. Very faint alcohol taste. Nothing to complain about in mouthfeel. Overall this is a winner. It's a big burly fruit beer with a high ABV and perfectly balanced.

The brew smells like fresh sweet raspberries, raspberry jam and a bit of tart raspberries. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like sweet raspberries and raspberry jam along with some tart raspberry, too. Also, there's a little bit of bready yeastiness noticable. But this beer is definitely all about the raspberries! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has moderate carbonation. It's smooth and very easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, it's certainly one of if not the best raspberry beers I've ever had.

The nose is of fresh raspberries, and that is about it, not artificial smelling either. Flavor is very sweet with raspberries, and again, that is about it for me, but this is not a bad thing by any means. Medium mouthfeel, and the alcohol is not present at all.

Actually, the alcohol is hard to pinpoint which is pretty shocking for a beer of this stature. A good idea might be to share this brew.

You'd never guess it's over 12%. For a fruit beer, it's good stuff. If you're into the style, you'll probably really like it.

Notes of raspberry jam, tart raspberry jell-o, raspberry puree, sweet -n- sour raspberry flavors. medium in both body and carbonation. extremely drinkably, especially after about a year in the bottle. The alcohol is just about non-existent. This one goes down very well. Sure, it's pricey, but IMHO, worth the $ for a once a year treat.

When shaken up and swirled halfway through the head comes back but it is more foamy than at first. Smells like raspberries, raspberries, raspberries. At first this is all I can smell and I can smell it from acroos the room. After a bit some alcoholic sweetness pokes into the nose and almost a banana scent. As it warms more, the cloying sweetness becomes more pronounced. Tastes like raspberries and a bit of tartness, this is definitly more sweet than tart. Has a bubbly mouthfeel at first upon a bit of swiling the bubbly mouthfeel moves toward a thick, syrupy, sweeter mouthfeel.

4.35,2.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thin head settled quickly, darker red than the Rubaeus, more like a raw cranberry juice. The aroma was pretty heady I thought: a strong black cherry smell that gave way to a yeasty odour and then a pink grapefruit flush. The taste was balanced and pleasant with tart, over ripe fruit, muted acidity and teasing tartness counter balanced with the sweetness of a european honey. Both this and the Rubaeus are raspberry-based and this is like the higher-alcohol big brother to it with a more substantial mouthfeel and texture. The only slight distraction, I thought, was a more abrupt after taste, possibly the malt following on the heels of a very pronounced raspberry-beer experience. The high alcohol is very well hidden, I would never have guessed this was over 12%. Highly recommended.","ThatWineGuy","Jun 01, 2008"

A minerally vegetable laced sweet and sour battle ingages on the back of the tongue. This has been called a bigger version of Rubeaus, but this really is its own unique brew.

I like it, but I can see how it wouldn't be everybody's cup of tea. The mouthfeel is tart, but not too much so.

Smell is a spicy fruit, but not necessarily raspberries. Strawberries, sour cherries, and blueberries all fill the nose. Sour wine aromas make a strong presence. There is a pretty obvious alcohol smell too. Sweet syrupy raspberries up front followed by a sour bite. Some pepper and a faint wood flavor emerge as well. Aftertaste has a bit of alcohol with a sour apple like sting. Mouthfeel is a medium body with a steady carbonation.

Almost an inch of soapy, bubbly, pinkish red colored head formed. Pretty quickly faded into a small ring in the glass. It did leave small spots of thin lace on the glass. A big nose full of raspberries, and plenty of dry alcohol. Almost Chambord like. Taste was pretty much the same. Tons of thick fresh raspberry flavors, sugary sweet with almost mouth puckering sourness. Finishes rather smooth with quite a bit of throat and body warming alcohol, and pretty dry. Has a nice, full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Plenty of tingly carbonation felt on the tongue. Pretty good drinkability, but I choose to enjoy it sip by sip. Pretty damn good in my opinion.

The color is a deep pink, a mix between magenta and ruby; the blush of the Blushing Monk. Very small head. The taste is clean, sweet and fruity, but not too sweet, with a dry quality, very reminiscent of a rich red wine. The flavor was full enough to hide the strong abv. I sampled this beer at Extreme Beer Fest 2006 and had been searching for it since.

Winelike, although very sweet. A nice mix of random dried fruit as well. Feel is excellent: crispy, biting, refreshing high carbonation. Body is medium, maybe a little thin but good with the carbonation. Overall, I liked this one, although it's not the most complex beer in the world (standard for the style).

Aroma is boozy and very powerful, consisting mostly of raspberries. Very tart and boozy flavor of raspberries. Full to the point of being heavy. Raspberry flavor is out of this world but its one dimensional, not that that is necessarily bad. I think this beer is exactly what the brewers were going for. Its really quite astounding. Personally, however, I am not very happy with it. Its just too big, too strong, and too much of a good thing. I also dont like that the body, at least to me, seems to come more from alcohol then from raspberries. Impressive it is, simply for being so big and so fruity but I really did not enjoy it and had a tough time finishing the bottle, even with a little help.","DaPeculierDane","Sep 12, 2007"

Aroma is a mix of sweet raspberry puree along with a lemony tartness. Taste is much the same, like a not quite ripe, tart raspberry, there is some raspberry sweetness underneath that slides across the back of the tongue, but the tartness is dominant. Carbonation at first is a bit sparkling with a crisp effervescence, this dies down as it warms but there is still a bite at the back of the throat. Reminds me very much of another tart raspberry beer except for the alcohol content. The alcohol on the chalkboard at the pub stated 10.3 and it is almost non-evident, very well hidden/balanced.
