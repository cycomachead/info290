"O: Basically a light American lager with some raspberries thrown in. This is not a bad thing just what it is. I like picking this up from time to time to have on hot days."
""
""
"I like this beer. Great for summer days on the golf course. Not to strong but the taste makes up for it. Recommend"
""
"Great taste, just a hint of fruit.  Best served on draft."
""
"Not a fan of fruit beer"

"Recently enjoyed at FishBar Manhattan Beach March 21, 2015."
""
"honestly this beer smelled horrible. like somebody got sick. had two already and both were the same so it wasn't just an off beer. it pours a pale lavender color almost no head. taste is fruit and berries at first then malt and clove and that artificial banana type flavor you get in some wheats, which I like, but the combination of that with the berries makes it almost undrinkable for me. I'll finish the six but will never think about buying this again."
"Nice mouth feel, nice raspberry flavor. Easy drink."
"Very fruity taste. Popular amongst the ladies"
""
"AT. Good at the end, light, the strong taste of fruit disappear."
"Basically a decent beer, but not much else. I do like the fact that they tried something different here, but nothing really stands out as being outstanding. Would be a good beer for a hot day, other than that, nothing overly outstanding."
"Overall : somewhat underwhelming but still fairly tasty. I'd have it again but it's nothing exciting."
""
"Underrated beer. Very creative and refreshing, but still tastes like a beer and not a girly substitute."
"Bottle of purple haze drank."
"Overall: won't drink again, perfect beer for the type of person who would normally drink twisted yea or Mikes hard over beer."

"Great light beer for out on the boat, just easy to drink"
"This beer tastes like artificial flavoring."

"it made me vomit, gross"

"My husband bought me this and I was like UHHHH Thanks I guess grape beer! Well he told me it was raspberry which I love and was still thinking gross sweet syrupy. Nope I was wrong. It was a light raspberry taste, great for summer. Very drinkable. Drank a bunch and now I need more!"

"For a much better raspberry beer, try Founders Rubaeus (spelling's off, because the ""u" has the German umlaut, and the a & e are combined in the old Latin ""aesc", but you can find it searching Founders brewery)."
""
"At least when you get a macro, you know what to expect."

""
""
"Not too bad of a beer"
""
"Great look, smell & taste. Great beer with a hint of raspberry"
"Reviewing this as a raspberry lager.  Nice golden color with little head.  Smells like slightly sour raspberries.  Smooth balanced lager with a good tart tartness from the raspberries. Easy drinker that is exactly what it is labeled."
"Great chill beer. Maybe a scarface or marvel movie relax beer."
"Not clean enough for a ""clean"" and not sour enough for a sour. Not my favored beer, yet this has a strong following."
"Not bad. Very available and sometime is not as good as others. Be sure to check bottled on date."
"My favorite craft beer on the market!!"
"Nice taste of with a hint of raspberries."
"Raspberry flavor i could pick up on. My girlfriend could not. I think the beer is great for what it is. Good raspberry flavored wheat beer"
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad brew, i would take it over anything adjunct anyday. However not my typical brew. Low ABV and IBU's, along with a very light almost diet raspberry taste. Glad i tried it but doubt i will purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great fruity undertones but not overpowering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit too berry and the aroma not so pleasant, but was enjoyable overall"
""
"I like the haze better mixed with other abita beers"
"Cool label and the color of the beer in a clear glass it neat, but nothing special about the beer's taste. No raspberry flavor at all."
"I was a bit underwhelmed by this beer"
""
""
""
"This is a little different but a very good beer, give it a try."
""
"Really good if you enjoy raspberry."
""
""
""
""
"Nice color, decent head, really nice fruity flavor. Strong fruity wheat flavors"
"Very good with a nice raspberry flavor."
"This was just truly horrid."
""
"Nice fruitiness with the raspberry purée added after fermentation; wheaty finish with a nice hazy color"
""
""
""
""
"Damn good."
""
""
"This was the first Abita beer I've had and it's still my first love. Sweet, refreshing, and just an all-around tasty brew. It's great out of the bottle but outstanding on tap!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice, clean beer with a hint of raspberry. Good for relaxing on your summer deck."
"The bottle and label makes this beer look like some kind of daunting stout but don't be fooled! It pours into a pale honey colored and you can definitely taste the raspberry flavor (little artificial tasting but I enjoyed it)."

"One of the few beers I can say is too light for me. I like the idea of it, but it sorta just tastes like sugar free Juicy Juice with a hint of beer. Very refreshing though."

"Good Beer i had this on a evening with they guys at my old job in a sushi eatery/pub.. taste good.. but leaves more to be desired..."
""
"Body feels watery, carbonation is much too low."
"Honestly, it's not as great as all the hype that was surrounding it when I had it, but it is worth a try and very easy/enjoyable to drink!  Smooth, light, quite crisp, refreshing and probably palatable/drinkable to anyone who tries it - i especially appreciate the raspberry puree that was brewed into it."

"Overall:  This is a very, very, good raspberry ale!  Great balance between the fruit, some honey-like sweetness, wheat, malt and slightly bitter hops.  Delicious!  I’m certainly getting a few of these again this coming summer!"

"P - pairs best with adventurea in Bonton and Sookie Stackhouses' Fae alternate reality."
""
""
""
"And I'm listening to ""All Along the Watchtower""...  Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises dry wheat, raspberry syrup, and a touch of corn.  The taste leads with the corn before immediately getting blindsided by the very artificial-tasting raspberry syrup.  Then everything returns to a bland corn-y situation.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this beer ain't my jam (no raspberry pun intended), what with the artificial taste and one-sad-note offering.  It's not horrible, but I'll likely never drink one again."
"What I would call a nice after dinner beer. The pour is dark red/purple with an off white head. The smell is full of berries, specifically raspberry. The taste is similar although a little more reserved. Very sweet which made it a bit hard to pair with most food besides deserts though. Overall a very nice beer."
""
""
""

"Overall: Not outstanding, but good by my standards."

"I was very surprised with this one! Usually I don't go for flavored beers because they tend to be very sugary. However, this one seems to have that perfect balance! Its amber colored with a white foamy head and looks great. My first smell I assumed it was going to be very sugary because it seemed very sweet and had light raspberry tones. Luckily I was proven wrong! Its light to medium bodied and has a great fruity feel finishing with strong notes of malts and wheat. Its well balanced and layered wonderfully!"
""
"pours golden amber in color with a small white head. Some spotty lacing is seen but not a lot. The aroma is is of wheat and raspberries. the taste is the same actually with the perfect blend of bot the raspberries and wheat, where not one was over powering at all. Not as sweet as you might thing and finished with a slight tangy finish. Overall a tasty brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Average beer, not too much taste or aromas going on. The raspberry is present but is not overpowering which is probably a good thing. Easy to drink. But not something I would go out of my way to have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a fairly decent lager, however it does not live up to its name. There should be more fruit flavor and a bit more sweetness. The label goes as far as to say you may even see some fruit pulp...I'm not buying that. Mildly refreshing. Could use improvement."

"nice aroma, good berry wheat flavor although it tends to lean a little to the artificial flavor side. Good drinking beer with a great aroma, decent head and color. Will drink again but wint go out of my way to get it, Decent on tap but better out of the bottle. Nice effort and a unique beer"
""

"O: Easy to drink and would be a good gateway beer for people that are just getting into craft beer - also appeals to non-beer drinkers. Refreshing but not interesting enough for me to want to have another."

"It's crisp up front and doesn't fall off too much at the end, though a little. The body is light but verges on being thin, though it avoids that as well. Smoothness is moderate as a touch of dryness sneaks into the finish."
"BBD 01/13/14. Pours a clear light amber with just a touch of purple shading. The bottom of the bottle pour is hazy from pulp. Light head that diminishes in 2 minutes with little lacing. Very light nose of raspberry. Light bodied with some pulp. Normal carbonation level. The weak flavor profile is raspberry, but you have to look for it since there is very little flavor present. The finish has mild effervescence that brings raspberry more forward with a bit of tartness."
""
"I only tried this because of my love of Abita, and raspberries. I didn't expect very much when I tried it and was really surprised by how much I like it. In reality, just think about your other preferences. If you don't like fruit beers, raspberries, or the like, you probably wouldn't like this. If you're like me and a raspberry fiend, and like beer, you'd enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I have another 23 of these cans to go, and I do enjoy this beer... One of the first Beers that got me into craft/micros."
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably one of the better fruit beers that I've had. You can definitely taste the raspberries and it's a cool purple colour. Interesting and worth a try, but I'm not really big on fruit beers so I probably wouldn't go out of my way for one again."

"This is the perfect beer for lady's who don't like beer. This was one of the first beers I gave my wife. She liked it but now that she has acquired the taste of beer she can't stand it. What makes this beer cool is that it has a fruity essence without a sweet fruit taste. This is a beer I would never drink myself but keep on hand for those inexperienced beer drinkers."

"Purple Haze pours a darker reddish color with not much head. There is an aroma with a pale wheat note, and a strange sweetness. The taste is much the same, pale wheat undertones, with a weird strange out of place sweetness from the raspberries. Awkward flavors, and rather too fizzy. Overall its light, fizzy, and way to sweet, and the flavors don't mix that well."

"O - This would be nice enjoyed on a warm summer day - Easy to slam back and the alcohol would make it session able."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Summary - To me, this is not a beer. Maybe a raspberry cider or something? It's just got this weird feeling to it, and it's so fizzy. I suppose it isn't a bad drink, but for me, it is a bad beer. I was hoping for a lot more depth than an alcoholic raspberry spritzer."

"Abita Purple Haze is a crisp, American style wheat beer with fresh raspberries added during secondary fermentation. Subtle coloration, fruity aroma and tartly sweet taste. Some may not care for unfiltered beers, but most would enjoy this anyway as it is still crisp and cleansing."
"Over all - light, easy drinking beer with a light fruit flavor."
"I know this seem bias me rating it as high as I did however, this was an excellent beer to me. It had JUST the right ammount of bitternes and flavor. I don't do very strong beers and thats why I liked this one. It was the perfect balance. I have had it both in bottle and on tap. The best part about the bottle is the actual raspberries floating in t."

"Overall Not a Bad Fruit Beer @ all,however not a GR8 One either,has a nice smooth,easy drinkability and they slide right down,but just not enough flavor,you know you are drinking a fruit beer 4sure,but it just doesn't quite make the cut ,and falls just a bit short for me,I Like it as a whole...but for almost 10 bucks a 6er,I Can buy much better Fruit Beers for a lot less,if perhaps it was 6~7 bucks a 6er,I would think about buying it again, because Ice Cold on a really Hot day this a is decent really refreshing beer,and the low ABV [4.2] mixed with the lightness of this Brew makes it a gr8 summer time session Beer,it won't fill you up or hammer you into oblivion when it's hot a hell out,maybe this beer is just really priced extra high in my Area [OC Maryland],and thats too bad,because as I said I would buy it again if it was priced a bit less,but it just is not worth 10 bucks a 6er~cheers and Peace to all:)"

"Im not a huge fan of fruit beers but I continue to try them hoping to find one that is amazing. Purple Haze is good...but its not amazing. The beer pours a hazy golden with thin white head with no lace. The scent and taste are accented by raspberries. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it ok...lawn mower beer for sure."

"O- Did not meet expectations. Good for one or two, but would not buy another 6 pack. It's an attractive beer, but it's exceedingly simple."
"I tasted no flavor at all. Not a bad beer, but not one I would buy again. very disappointed. After two, taste did not improve and I felt nothing. Bottle has nice design, catches your eye, looked good in glass, but had no flavor whatsoever that i could detect."

"Unfiltered appearance (raspberries added after filtration) almost orange color with moderate carbonation and mild head. Very fruity and sweet aroma--you can definitely discern the raspberries. Tastes almost like raspberries dropped in a light beer. Not exactly in a refreshing way. Not much depth. A little tart which is nice. The beer fails for us not on the raspberry inclusion but on the beer portion itself."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 6/5/2013. Pours moderately hazy and cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart raspberry, wheat, cracker, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with big strength of raspberries that smell very authentic. Taste of raspberry, wheat, cracker, floral, grass, light pepper, and floral earthiness. Lingering notes of raspberry, wheat, cracker, floral, grass, light pepper, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of raspberry, bready malt, and hop notes; with a decent amount of robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good fruit beer. Good balance of fruit, malt, and hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. I definitely enjoyed this as a nice session-able brew."

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, developed a light head, which had little retention or lacing. Appearance was cloudy with an amber / honey color. Aroma was strong of berry, and not much else. Taste was light and also of berry, not much else. Maouthfeel was light and watery with a light, sweet aftertaste, also with pronounced berry flavor."

"Poured this Fruit beer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a golden purple hazy color, produced a creamy white head, decent retention and it left an average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of raspberries and malted grain. Light to medium bodied, a foundation of malted grain, tart raspberry, and some earthy hop bitterness. Overall, decent fruit beer, the main plus for me with this one is that there is not a sticky artificial fruit flavor that many fruit beers have. Nice session beer."

"O: Overall I thought the beer works really well as a refreshment or something to to drink with a very light dessert or light meal. It would make a good lawnmower beer. This is very reminiscent of Abita's Strawberry Harvest Lager, so if you enjoy that beer I believe you will enjoy this one. I enjoyed drinking it."

"I'm usually not one to enjoy raspberry, fruity beers. However, this one had a very subtle fruit taste that was very dry. Had a nice, off-white head and was very refreshing. The only thing I did not like about this was the dryness. I enjoyed about 2 of them and, by the 3rd one I was growing tired of the dry mouthfeel. But, overall, the fruity aroma, refreshing taste, and inviting appearance was pretty good."

"as the fruity beers go, i like this one because it doesnt taste artificial or overly sweet. the pour is a tad unnatural, with an odd purple hue to an already cloudy brew. there is about an inch of slowly dissipating white head. the nose is like muddled raspberries, fresh and tart, with the sweetness only coming in the taste. there is a light wheat malt to this as well as some american pale malt, which give it more body than a lot of beers in this style have. the taste shows some hopping toward the finish, which tames what would otherwise be a punishingly sweet conclusion. i like the freshness of the raspberries though, they taste just picked to me, and it makes an excellent summer drink. i see this as an early tee time brew, low alcohol, juicy, and sessionable despite the sugary vibe. great carbonation gives a light and bright mouthfeel, down easy. not my thing in the winter time, but ask me again on a hot golf course around 10:30am sometime this summer and i will have an entirely different opinion. one of the more palatable abita brews ive come across."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best before 12/28/12. This pours a slightly hazy light brown/golden color with a massive wheat beer sized head which has a long retention. The smells are similar to a pilsner, some grass hops, wheat and a hint of raspberries. The feel is medium to a little thinner. The taste is okay, more thin and light than I was expecting, you get some wheat, very faint hop bitterness (almost none) and a very light raspberry, far lighter than I was expecting."
"I am impressed with the name as it could not describe the appearance any better. Hazy and yes, purple, this wheat beer is quite pretty. I smell berry on the nose but it does seem a bit manufactured. The taste is nice, raspberries and wheat, the raspberries seem to be more from a bottle and less real. I'd call this a ""cheer beer"" but I liked it enough that I drank two. It won't set the craft beer world on fire but it will sell a lot of bottles of beer."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a good sized whit head that slowly dissipates to a cap on top. Funny, but for a beer brewed with raspberries and called purple haze, I was definitely expecting more color. The nose holds a bit of tart raspberry along with a spicy wheat and bready malt aroma. The flavor is sweet with mild raspberry flavor that peeks in and out of a bready honey like spicy wheat malt base. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet watery and slick mouthfeel. This is just so blah. The berries feel weak and artificial and the underlying beer is uninspiring as well."

"The raspberries don't really come through in the aroma, but I've never really had a rasp-brew that has, so I'm not surprised. It doesn't really have a strong armoa. The cool part is that the berries come out and sucker punch you once you take a sip, and then it fades quickly, getting replaced by easily detectable wheat malts- yet the raspberries linger more than the malts in the overall aftertaste. It makes for an interesting experience and it's one I'd do again!"

"O: A decent beer, but not much above average. Flavors were well-executed but lacked complexity. I was pleased that the blend of ingredients and flavors were such that the sweetness of the raspberry did not overpower the beer. This brew's reputation preceded it, but it didn't quite live up to expectations. If offered as a selection at a gathering, I'd keep looking."

"The brew poured with a two finger white head with an orange, cloudy body. There was no visible carbonation due to the cloudiness. There was a lot of fruit, mostly raspberry, on the nose, which is to be expected. There is some lacing left on the glass. The first sip is a lot of raspberries, but a lot of carbonation. I’ve had this before, and this is not what it tastes like. Something is missing. It almost tastes like raspberry seltzer. There is definitely something wrong with this beer. It’s so watery and weak. This pint is definitely not reflective of the beer itself. Normally, the beer is a nice mouthful of raspberries with a hint of wheat mixed in. It goes down quick and it goes down easy. Not this one. I think perhaps I got a bad pint. Anyways, Abita Purple Haze is an easy session beer with some great flavor. Just don’t try it at Court Jester in Freehold."

"Pours a clear reddish-yellow with a foamy bone colored head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, grain, and some slight berry aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight perfume-like flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but not something I would seek out again."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a cloudy clear pink like water, piss, and strawberry juice. It definitely has a slight purple haze. There is little to no head, but a ring around the glass that is soap white. The beer is quite hazy and clear amber, which is a strange color for beer. The beer smells like sour bread with some nice wheat wafting and a salty stale bread smell as it settles and it almost reminds me of buttered toast. The beer tastes heavy with wheat malt, with an oh-so-subtle hint of raspberries. Overall it seems to give a taste of flavored water with a lot of wheat. The aftertaste brings the tart fruit a little more forward, but still it remains quite mellow. The mouthfeel begins a little uncomfortable with carbonation, but settles out into a thick and oddly creamy feel, and is really quite drinkable and watery. This beer just can’t decide what it is. I don’t get enough malt and not enough fruity flavors for me. It sits uncomfortably in the middle and thus doesn’t seem to really claim a category and leaves me at a loss to label it. This is a meh beer."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice orangish straw color with a bubbly white head that dissipates very quickly. Smells of sweet berries, but with some balance with the grain. Has a bit of a tart taste, but it is very good and balanced with the rest of the beer. This light bodied beer is a bit over carbonated, but still goes down real smooth. Overall, an above average beer."

"Let me start out saying this. I've been on beeradvocate for close to 4 years and i've never felt obligated to review a beer. However, this thing they call a beer so disturbed my taste buds i couldn't help it. My girlfriend who will put down bluepaw and milk stout all day said she couldnt even smell it. It tastes like moldy rainwater at best. I would rather have to snort milwakees best."
""
""
"Interesting combo of fruit and lager. Nothing sensationable but fresher tasting than most other fruit beers. Also to add another note, this is a fruit beer I could have more than just one of, not too heavy one fruit and not loaded with wheat."
""
""
"Once I got home, I poured one in a glass, and was immediately taken by the color. The pale yellow tinged with a ""purple haze"" was truly unique. The head was on the thin side, but no beer is perfect."

"You get the raspberry flavor but it's not that strong. Much less fruity than most fruit beers. It's an inoffensive, pleasant tasting, slightly fruity beer that is fine for a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"Thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has an amberish color wiith a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sour, berries. Taste is tart, lots of berries, a bit of grains and malts. Feels light in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The head was still a pinkish-white, but retention was much lower in this case. Color was a deeper reddish-amber, but not as hazy as from a bottle. Nose was still filled with raspberry, but not as cloying as from a bottle. Mouthfeel was about the same - slightly on the thin side. The taste was not as prevalent as from a bottle, more muted. Finish also lacked some of the oomph that the bottle imparted. Bottom line: if somewhere that both are available, go for bottle or draft, but if hiking, camping, going to the beach, reach for the CANned version. That, or if they begin putting fresh puree in CANs, then it will render the point moot."
"Overall: I bought a pint just to review it and honestly not worth my time nor yours. It looks good taste maybe alright but I have had much better from Abita not to mention better ""fruit"" beers. Salud!"

"I've had this in a bottle and on tap. I prefer it on tap but not bad either way. It's a crisp, refreshing beer. I don't think that it's overly fruity at all and don't really find that it has a distinct raspberry aroma. It's not at all bitter and on the whole, very enjoyable."

"Initially, the taste was amazing. Sweet raspberries are upfront, but then they fade to the dirty flavors that Ive come to hate with American Wheat Pale Ales. Its almost like BL, Bud Heavy, and MGD. It does so well, then it loses it when those awful flavors come through. Wish they didnt have it, because it would be in the realm of Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat, good in context."

"Pours golden with a white head. The beer is slightly cloudy due to the raspberry pulp. The smell of raspberry comes through in the aroma as well as the wheat. The raspberry flavor is not too sweet. There are flavors of wheat. The hops aren't very pronounced. This is a light bodied beer that is crisp and well carbonated. It's a refreshingly good beer."
"D: Easy to drink, but then there is not much there. Everything is rather minimal & insipid. Sort of a yawn. I remember it being better on tap down south – more fruity raspberry and more wheat character. Maybe it needs to be fresh? Are they changing it for stability in the mixed packs?"
""
""
""
""
"O: Purple Haze just simply doesn't cut it in the flavor department. It's not all that focused."
""
""
"Served in a pint glass, brew pours a pale golden color with a light mist of semi-filtered ""haze"". Nose is bright and crisp with the promise of a refreshing fruit taste. Raspberry fruit flavor shines through nicely in a zesty sweet and tart feel. Carbonation really quenches the palate up to a lightly sticky earthy raspberry finish. Something I'd love to try pairing with a goat cheese salad and/or grilled gulf shrimp."
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall this is a pretty good beer. It could go for a little more hops or so as it tasted a little watery but the wheat really stood out in this beer."

"This is not that bearable. I'm on my second, and struggling. I WILL win this glass, but at a price. Somebody pour me a Yuengling, please."
"O - Overall, this is an average beer. I used to drink alot of this back when I bowled in the pregaming sessions. You can do worse, but you can also do quite better."
""
""
"Overall: I really don't understand the name of this beer; the raspberries are barely discernible. If you want an extremely light flavored fruit beer, this is for you."
""
"To me this beer is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to try a different tasting beer for a change. The name of this beer says it all. The look of it is a faint yellow with decent head, the taste is that of faint grape mixed with other fruit. And the smell is fruity."
""
""
"Overall I would say that this beer is a nice, light, and refreshing beer that is good for a 6-pack night drinking with friends."
""
""
""
"A light, very drinkable but flavorful beer. Nose is raspberries with some biscuity malt. Very clean lager taste, w the raspberries offering a not-at-all overpowering tartness; faint bit of spiciness from the hops. The beer is a little sweet, balanced mostly by the raspberry tartness. For what it is - a relatively light American lager - I can't think of many other beers I'd prefer to drink when that's what I'm looking for. It's real raspberries, not some nasty flavoring, and it's executed extremely well. If it weren't for the price, I'd buy this a lot more often as a solid session beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A perfect summer beer but at the same time, I could probably enjoy this on a regular basis. Would love to see this in my area, as it's well balanced, the alcohol is hidden very good, and there is a freshness about it that puts it in it's own class amongst fruit beers...nothing artificial tasting about this one. Great job to Abita!"

"I don't usually like fruity beers especially one's involving raspberries, in fact only apricots are a fruit that I liked in my beer. Purple Haze is a little different. I had it a while ago and still remember the name. I finally found a place that carried it in bottles. The smell is not overwhelming but the taste is perfectly mixed with a beer and raspberries. It's not overbearing and does not leave you with a fowl aftertaste. It's even good at room temperature. Definitely recommend this brew."

"Pours light, slightly darker than straw color. Small bright white head adorns. Aroma is bready malts and a tinge of fruitiness. You get the raspberries on the taste more than the aroma, which adds a slightly sugary sweetness over biscuity wheat. Very light in body, crisp. It's a fruit beer, what can I say. I always drink these last when I get a party pack..."

"Overall, like a magic hat but with raspberry instead of apricot"
"Overall, not a bad fruit beer. It doesn't taste artificial like many fruit beers but the balance just seems a bit off."
"O: The best fruit beer I have had hands down and at a price that can't be beat."
"Overall- It is sort of boring despite the awesome raspberry flavor. It just needs to beef up the nose and the raspberry profile on the tongue could be better."
"Good carbonation, light feel overall. It wasn't terrible, but definitely not something I would want to try again unless I was perhaps having it as a soda rather than a beer."
"Yeah, this is a needless and pointless fruit beer. It doesn't help that it's a very bland and rather unpleasant base beer, but the fruit addition makes it even worse. It feels senseless and cynical. Very unimpressed."
"D ~ Ehhh...not as bad as I remember it being, but really not one worth getting again & again...or ever again for that matter. An alright fruit beer with no bells, no whistles."
"Overall: Not the monster people seem to make it out to be, but really not that great either. Its below average for fruit beers, but not particularly offensive. ""Meh""."
"(I have also had it on tap, and I recall enjoying that even more, but this review is for the bottle version I have at hand.)"
"O: Good for the style I guess. However, its a bit to much like wine cooler or somthing for me. Refreshing nonetheless."
"O/D-The whole 'Purple Haze' thing turned me off from this beer. But once i found out it was a raspberry beer I needed to try it. I enjoyed it quite a lot. It was $8 at my local store. I enjoyed it more and more with each sip. Catches some flak but I am a fan. Love those raspberries. Not as good as Blackbeary Wheat by Longtrail however."
"B (3.7)"
"cons: dont have space for all, but the fact i will pass it by next time."
"Too thin and one dimensional; definitely not for me."
"call me a sissy but I could drink a few of these while the heat is on"
"O: This brew is certainly not of great craft beer caliber but is a fun drink and a pleasant experience, though not for the beer aficionado expecting a premium, complex, craft beer."
"The color fits the name ""purple haze"" a nice hazy raspberry color. It's a nice crisp beer with a sligght sweet/tart flavor. It is not overly sweet or ""artificial"" tasting. It's a great lighter beer that fits in well with the hot/humid Louisiana climate!"
"RJT"
"Nice name though. I like the concept, but it was not one of my favorites."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid beer, highly recommended for those looking for a strong fruit taste."
" Honestly, not a bad beer! Certainly not my favorite, but thumbs up."
"This is a beer my fruit beer loving wife enjoys, as for me it is okay."
"Overall - Not a bad beer but not a particularly good one. Let's call it an average beer with a great name."
"Overall: Not very good, as beer goes."
"I'm not completely sold on this one, mind you, but I'm willing to admit that it wasn't anywhere near as cloyingly, nastily awful as I was expecting, and in fact would go over fairly well with some vanilla ice cream. Beer float, anyone?"
"The Rest: A decent fruit beer that is pretty light and crisp with a body on the thin side of medium. The aroma, however, is a bit off-putting which lowers the overall rating of this beer."
"D: Very unique taste in a beer that I have enjoyed several times and would drink again."
"O- I was disappointed with this beer, not what I expected. It was just too bland. Great for a session beer and very easy to drink. This will not be a regular for me and I won't be buying this again anytime soon. Maybe for a back yard summer party where I'm gonna be drinking for several hours."
"Poured into my Zero Gravity pilsner glass, a slightly cloudy golden yellow, with a definite pink-purplish tint, and a small off-white head. Nose of grains, wheat, and coexisting citrus zest and raspberry. Light wheat beer profile on the taste buds, with a raspberry sweetness that's just strong enough to overtake everything else that might be present. Light mouthfeel, and quite drinkable on a relaxing summer day."
"The beer is a murky dark yellow/ amber color with a fluffy white head, the beer and head had a very light lavender tint, it left a lot of lacing too. The aroma is faint with wheat bread and just a hint of raspberry. It tastes a little bland to be honest but I did pick up mostly wheat, with a slight tartness of raspberry with a bready finish. The beer is light, fully carbonated and has a dry finish. This is just a little above your average wheat beer with a little twist to it, a slight twist but still a twist."
"O: This is a halfway decent beer! A nice crisp, refreshing brew that I can enjoy on a hot summer day."
"the color of purple haze is right in line with it's name, a hazy purplish, which I find pretty nice. The smell is slightly citrus and fruity. The taste is not as sweet as I expected, but that adds to the drinkability. Over all this is a really drinkable and unique beer."
"M/O: The beer has a great balance and is very crisp and drinkable. Its perfect for a hot day. These beers are tough because the question is whether its artificial flavor or too overpowering. This really walks the line of being a drinkable beer that has real flavor and doesn't punch you in the nose with it."
"Overall- Good for a hot summer day. Easy to drink if you’re into a fruit beer. The tartness make it kind of a quencher."
"Purple Haze had to be one of the first fruit beers I'd ever tried. This beer was the bottled list at the Kaystone Pub a while back when I was just starting to explore the beer world. The reason why I bought it was because the name made me think of Jimi Hendrix's song, so without hesitation I got one. The beer poured out as a slightly hazy golden color. The head was fluffy at first before it vanished. The smell of the beer was sweet and had a good amount of raspberry aromas in there. The taste I found to be a little on the light side. Not as much flavor as I was hoping. The mouthfeel was light and fairly refreshing. Overall it wasn't a bad gateway beer for me. It gave me an idea of what a fruit beer was and shed some light on the style."
"It was obvious it was some attempt at a sort of fruit beer, but I had no idea this was supposed to be a wheat-raspberry fruit beer until I read through a few these Purple Haze reviews just now."
"This beer is quite liked by a couple people I know, and it's definitely got a niche it fills. Pretty drinkable. Great summer beer."
"O: I've had worse but I really don't enjoy this beer. I could see it being a good lawnmower beer or going good with fried foods. Honestly, there's better choices out there for that."
"all in all this is a good beer it kind of reminds me of a beer cocktail or a beer and soda but not a bad beer and definitely nothing wrong with it imho"
"Contrary to my initial belief, there’s no homage to Jimi Hendrix here. Nor is there an incorporation of marijuana, not that I can tell yet, anyway. What it does have is raspberries. I never read the label, I just drank it, and I liked it. For a fruit beer, this one fills niche quite nicely. Now, excuse me while I kiss the sky."
"O ~ something I wanted to try. Glad I didn't buy a 6er but was offered one at a friends house. Will not really search it out again. I do like Abita's other offerings, but this is just not one fore me."
"D- while i could probably drink a couple of these in a night (or afternoon) I wouldn't go for this beer back to back. It's a bit too sweet for me to drink as a session beer but a nice end, or start to the night."
"O - Over the years this beer has been surpassed by many others. But kudos to Abita Brewing for continuing to make this beer consistently good and even after the rebuild of Katrina. I'll always look foward to some Purple Haze. Geaux Abita!"
"Not the worlds best beer but by no means a slouch. Much better than the Shocktop Rasberry Wheat that is being marketed as it's competition."
"A cloudy beer more the color of a pale ale than a wheat with light purplish hues. Decent head and a touch of lace here and there. Smell is tar and wheaty with a wonderful rasberry scent. Taste dry and grainy with a delectable berry tartness. Very crisp feel with spot on carbonation and medium light weight. A great fruit beer. Usually not my cup of tea but this is a highly quaffable and enjoyable beer. Top notch"
"Overall- Enjoyable beer! Its funny because the last few Fruit/Veggie Beers I've had, the Aroma is HUGE with flavor and whatever fruit is being used but in this one the Raspberry comes through as the dominant attribute. Could drink easily more than 4 but like always, going to move on to new and more interesting beers!"
"O - I enjoy ""well done"" fruited brews and Purple Haze falls just short. A very disappointing brew. It doesn't quite know what it wants to be... A Sour or a reserved Raspberry Pale/Lager??? I won't seek this one out in the future, not a drain pour, but nothing to remember."
"My buddy Mike (also a huge beer geek) thought it sucked but within it's style this is pretty good. Not something I want to drink all the time but this is good. I would find it hard to have a session with this. It's a bit too sweet for me."
"Thin and watery with decent carbonation. So far nobody has made a raspberry beer as good as New Glarus Raspberry Tart. This beer pales in comparison, which is too bad."
"This beer pours a pinkish yellow reminiscent of a pink grapefruit with no head or lace. The aroma has hints of wheat and citrus with a tiny bit of raspberry showing through. The flavor is like bubble gum with a tart raspberry note. It has a light mouthfeel. Abita Purple Haze is an okay beer, slightly recommended."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a hazy, blood tinged gold that is almost opaque. The pour starts out with a huge, robust, three inch foamy white head that settles quickly into a thin film. Initial aromas are very similar to a framboise lambic, with very tart and sugary raspberry smells, but they are balanced with wheat aromas, as well, with some toasted cereal characteristics cutting the sweet towards the end. Smell is a bit strong, and a tad sour with the tart. Sharp and carbonated mouthfeel cuts the raspberry and wheat flavors. The sweetness is not overpowering, but the tartness does come through strong. There is a light fruit sweetness to the aftertaste, with a filmy and clingy finish. The increased carbonation makes the beer a little on the sharp side, but the flavors are light compared to how strong the aromas were to start. Interesting blend of flavors, but balance gets a little out of whack at times."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow, with a white head. In the aroma, wheat like notes and kind of like asiago cheese. In the taste, dry wheat notes and a small fruit note. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry wheat and small hint of fruit in the aftertaste. Kind of icky with a bad aroma, and really lacking in fruit presence."
"Enjoy!!"
"poured into pint glass, has a cloudy grapefruit color with one finger of foam that quickly disappears. smells of raspberry tartness and wheat. taste pretty much follows the nose, raspberrys upfront then turns to a wheat beer. mouthfeel had a good amount of carbonation and a slightly creamy texture. overall a delicious beer."
"It's not a terrible beer but it's certainly not great. I do like that they're experimenting with fruits at Abita."
"Overall - One of the most boring beers ever. If someone gave you a blind taste test, you'd think this was Vitamin Water"
"O - This beer is incredibly misleading. It smells and looks great but it doesn't deliver in any other areas. Probably won't drink again."
"The feel of this beer is light but smooth and goes down with a nice easy drinkable feel."
"Very good."
"D: solid, nothing spectacular. You could do worse. Nice summer and newbie beer, the ladies may enjoy the sweetness."
"Overall: I had this a few months ago and forgot to review. I definitely liked it."
"M - Drink this one with food pairing. Difficult to drink quickly or a large amount; you will become overwhelmed. This is a decent American wheat beer. Good for hotter temps and can be served cold."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 6/24/2011, bought as a single at World Market. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with a half inch white/light pink head. Lacing and head retention are both OK. Aroma is sweet raspberries and wheat. Taste is mostly wheat and bready malt with some raspberries. However, the raspberry flavor isn't nearly as strong as I thought it would be. Mouthfeel/body is light, with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a slightly above average beer, but I wasn't impressed with it. Wouldn't be a bad choice to have on a hot day."
"I expected this to be kind of a sweet mess, but I was definitely wrong. Straightforward, and nicely balanced."
"D- Very refreshing beer that goes down quick. Would be great in the summer."
"Drinkability: I first sampled this beer and tried it later on based on the sample. It was very easy to drink as it was not too heavy and had a good flavor. Then again, this kind of beer is right up my alley."
"Very light and actually kind-of watery, some good carbonation, a bit of the malt hangs around for a relatively clean finish. Certainly very easy to drink, and for the audience to whom it is targeted I bet it goes over well, but hardly the kind of thing I would put much stock in. Not really for the average BA, I'm guessing."
"Poured a cloudy pinkish-yellow with a small white fizzy head that was fully diminishing and had no lacing to speak of. The aroma was very weak with notes of bread malts, a doughy yeast and a slight hint of raspberry. It tasted lightly sweet with a mild acidic characteristic from start to finish and had a slight hint of raspberry at the end with the flavor disappearing from the taste buds almost immediately. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with the carbonation being quite lively. Overall a nice light refreshing brew with a just a bit of raspberry flavor. Great on those hot summer days when you feel like having more than just a few."
"DRINKABILITY: I suppose I might try this beer again under the right circumstances, but there was nothing in particular about it that stood out. It was easy to drink in the same way that flavored water is easy to drink and I guess I might buy it again to satisfy someone who likes just a hint of flavor in thin, watery beer. I won't be buying it for myself, though."
"The CPJ"
"Opinion: Well, I'm not as big of a fan of this particular beer as my brother is, but to each their own. He doesn't care for Korbinian, so we are different individuals. That said, this is one of the better ones from Abita. Their Amber rocks when you are in New Orleans, and I have had some good beer at their brew-pub/cafe in Abita Springs...but as a regular offering, this is one of their better ones and worth a shot."
"D: I know I've mentioned it a couple times already, but the taste is weird! It's definitely not my cup of beer in any shape or form."
" Finally, the taste was described as wheaty and fruity in taste that fades to a tangy raspberry taste."
"A cloudy gold to orange color with very little head when poured. Not seeing any purple here. Scent was definitely raspberry. Taste was clearly raspberry, but not overpowering. A pretty well balanced fruit beer. Nothing outstanding about this one, but nothing offensive either."
"Drinkability: I can certainly see myself drinking this cold during summer and maybe spring but certainly not during winter. I think Abitas has a done a good job creating a decent fruit beer with actual raspberries instead of artificial flavoring. I probably won't touch my other bottles until the VA humidity and heat roll in around May or so."
"D: The beer is definitely very easy to drink, although I wouldn't call it particularly thirst quenching."
"Poured into a common bar pint. Interesting amber color with a golden and red. SMells of sweet fruits. Tastes of cranberry and raspberry cocktail involved with a wheat beer. The fruit is not overpowering and for a fruity beer, I would say this is among the better I've had. It shows a light body with a stringent syrpy feel, and small carbonation. I would recommend this to your old lady or sister."
"The taste follows the nose initially, and begins pleasant but soon becomes overpowering and sickly sweet/fruity. The nice wheat base malt is completely lost amongst the sweet/sour berry flavors. Reminds me a little of a white wine mixed with raspberries, really awful actually. The best way to describe this is a good wheat beer with raspberry juice and confectionery sugar added. Gross. Overall this may be tolerable in the heat of summer but not in the middle of the February during worst winter in recent memory. I've had good fruit beers and this is not one."
"D - If I was in an easy drinking mood and didn't want to much going on in my beer, this would be excellent. Good thirst quencher here."
"Abita is a great company that not a lot of people know about. No one would think Louisiana would produce a quality beer in my opinion. Purple haze has a flirty tint to its color and it is great for fruit, whit, and wheat lovers. Alady that is new to the beer world would love this as her first try especially since I try to get people to try something other than Blue Moon. However. I do like it."
"Overall, I might have gotten a dirty hose but I'm not impressed."
"Poured a golden in color with some haze in the glass and a head that diminished to a thin layer on top. smell is predominately raspberry, tart, light yeast, and wheat. taste is better than i would have thought. comes over the tongue on the thin side, light flavor of malts and mid taste yeast, and finishes with a raspberry tart flavor. does not have the artificial taste or smell that a lot of these do, i give them points on the raspberry puree, best drank right after it is poured, almost like a light lambic."
"D- This beer is good cold. I know that sounds stupid as it mutes the flavors. Once it warms the beer takes on a different not really good flavor. ABV is low to make it more sessionable but they need to work on the overall flavor more I think."
"Served in a plain glass, it boasted a two finger head of fluffy foam, with good lace cling. Color was a reddish brown, with a little bit of haze to appearance. Smell of raspberries, apple, and malt. Taste of raspberries, caramel, molasses, apple, and malt. Good texture and body in my mouth. Not a beer that I could drink one after another, a little to sweet and fruity, but one was great."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thick for how subdued the brew is, but is otherwise alright. And it's a fairly drinkable beer, the simplicity makes them easy to kick back. This is just about an average beer - Sam Adams Blackberry Witbier does everything this does better, but it's still enjoyable to drink."
"OVERALL: Good, not great. Purple Haze is a little too bland for those who enjoy a lot of flavor, but the light body and refreshing qualities would make drinking a few a breeze."
"Say whatever you want about this beer but it is a very drinkable and refreshing offering from Abita."
"D- For a fruit beer this is a more drinkable brew. Also, there are a number of beer mixes which some people love and Purple Haze is typically on that list."
"Poured my bottle into a mug. Next to nothing for head, but what was there was white. The smell was bread/hay-like with a tinge of fruit. The taste was fair at best. The wheat, and raspberry tastes were both very muted. Their was no bitterness, but has a slight sour taste at the end of drink. It is easy drinking, but that's because it seems watered down."
"3/3.5/3.5/3/3"
"It did have a light fresh taste and due to it being a light beer you could drink more than one easily (if you can stand fruit beers)."
"D- If you like raspberries then its easy to drink. This was hard to grade. Was it a good beer? No. Was it a good beer for people that don't like beer? Yes. It was also a good raspberry drink."
"Looks like a darkish amber wheat beer with a touch of purple (big surprise). Smells strongly of raspberries and some malt. Taste is somewhat disappointing, as the raspberry taste is lighter than expected and the beer flavor is very weak. Mouthfeel is light but has an almost tingly finish. I could probably drink a six pack of these as long as I had something else to break them up. I will not be buying this again."
"D - It's a very drinkable beer. If my girlfriend who hates beer thought that, ""it's not bad"" that should tell you a thing or two. It goes down very easy and it's definitely a beer I would like to have, and enjoy again."
"Amber and hazy, a quickly dying head with no retention. Little to no lace. Rapsberry predominates the aroma. Carbonation bite up front. Rapsberry comes next followed by a flat middle. Adjunct grain popcorn finish. Too heavy a mouthfeel for the style, almost chewy."
"Light bodied, soda like carbonation, and a clean aftertaste... It could certainly be refreshing down in the bayou, but for now I'm good with one."
"12 ounce stubby bottle. Gotta love the Jimi Hendrix reference. Let's see if this beer can stand up to my love of all things Hendrix. Pours a flat and hazy straw yellow with no head. Hmm. Not a great start. Aroma is subtle, like raspberry compote mixed with some basic lager beer. Initial impression of the taste is ... strange. Lots of wheat character in this, almost like drinking raw wheat. Very little raspberry character in this, it's overpowered by the wheat. I've had a lot of wheat beers and hefeweisens over the years, but this one may have the most wheat character of any that I've had. And if you like wheat beers, this one may be your thing, because it's like chewing on raw what. I however, am not a fan."
"It finishes clean, berried and sweet, with some tartness. It's as drinkable as any other beer of its style, just mostly indistinct from the others."
"Most likely wouldn't pick up again, but wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"I have been converted! One of the things that I have always thought is that fruit and beer fight, rather than complement, each other. This beer has proven to me that exactly the opposite can be true."
"Quite drinkable and quite accessible to the average consumer since the beer is not so extreme."
"Not the most interesting beer out there but for what it is, it's not too bad. Smooth, drinkable and refreshing."
"{minor revision with new OVERALL rating on 5/7/11)"
"A very flavorful and drinkable beer"
"Overall, an OK beer. Not great, but drinkable due to the low ABV and the taste is not offensive."
"D:"
"Final Thoughts: Would recommend, but would probably not buy again."
"Ordered at a favorite local restaurant - dining outside on a hot, humid evening. Was looking for something light and refreshing. I felt a little cheated with this one. Tastes like a malt beverage pretending to be a craft beer. Avoid!"
"Poured with disappearing head. There was a faint pink-purple tint to the hazy beer, and the raspberry flavor was very authentic - it didn't taste like an artificial additive or preservative. The beer had a lightish flavor, and with the subtle fruit flavor, I could see having a few of these."
"It actually did pour a slight purple hue but was mostly golden with a half finger of head and left a little sticky lacing on the glass. On the nose I got the raspberry aromas right away along with grain and wheaty bready notes; pretty basic but fruity. Upront the raspberries dominate the palate and also came with grainy and wheat accents like the nose. The brew was light bodied with a low amount of carbonation that had a fruity grainy crisp finish and was quite enjoyable. It drank very good and was really good paired with some southern style BBQ."
"drinkability: almost like drinking a fruit drink that has been watered down. its easy to put down, but ehh."
"Overall, I enjoy this beer. It's not my favorite, but I enjoy it every once in awhile."
"Abita Purple Haze pours a light, light, hazed whitish yellow. A very small head is present but seems to be hanging out for a long time. The nose on this beer is huge! it almost smells like Welch's juice. The first sip is like biting into a raspberry filled jelly doughnut. The wheat is present only on the finish by scratching the back of my tongue. The beer is extremely easy to drink. It's not too sweet but seems more like something to have with breakfast. If breakfast is too early for you (on your days off of course) maybe with some cheese cake topped with fresh raspberries after dinner. I'm was going to rate this beer a solid B- but it seemed to become flat as I continued to drink it. So my rating is a middle of the road C"
"Hazy gold beer that has some carbonation bubbles with a medium head that lingers for the drink. Smell is rich in rasberry, not much else. The taste is like fruit juice. It's definitely rasberry heavy, pretty smooth, little carbonation bite. Light bodied with light carbonation. It's a light beer that tastes like a fruit drink. It's not bad but just not for me."
"This has so much promise and just fell flat on its face on the first sip. Many friends have warned me that Abita brews unremarkable beers and I have now experienced it for myself."
"Overall, not a bad drink to get ppl interested in craft beers, but as far as I'm concerned, this is not beer."
"Well since I'm from Louisiana I have to show a little bit of favoritism. Pours cloudy orange with a 1.5 to 2 finger head that dissipates at a leisurely pace. If you smell the beer before you try it the first thing you will notice before you bring the rim of the glass up to your nose is the raspberry aroma of the beer. But at first sip the taste is not quite as obvious as the smell. This beer does have a fruity raspberry taste but not enough to rule out that you're still drinking a beer. It has mild hoppyness and mild carbonation. A good beer for a hot Louisiana summer."
"Overall I recommend this beer to anyone looking for something different. Most people I have asked say they don't like this beer, but I just tell them they're crazy because I honestly think this is the best beer I've stumbled upon for some time now."
"D- It's not a bad beer. For a fruit beer, it's actually pretty good. I enjoyed."
"Drinkability: I don't really understand why this beer is reviewed so badly- I don't think it's THAT bad. This isn't something I would go for all the time, but I'd be willing to have it again. If nothing else, this would make for a great refresher to have in the fridge."
"D- real easy to drink but nothing special to make it a repeat"
"Overall- Probably not something I'll buy again. Just goes to further reinforce my dislike of fruit beers. I can see how the BMC crowd might enjoy this one, but its not for me."
"It almost came off as a pale ale with the nice wheat taste, but it all worked together very nicely. I'm definitely adding this one to my faves."
"Probably better on tap because this one was good and I've remembered drinking some of these that have not been memorable to say the least."
"Pours a hazy grapefruit like color with a one finger frothy head which gives way to nothing with no lacing. The aroma is of raspberries with a slight floral note, there is really nothing else to smell. The smell is inviting though. The taste is of tart raspberries but it is kinda weak and very subtle. It could stand to be a little more present. There is a hint of a wheat backbone. The carbonation is lighter. The drinkability is okay. There is nothing to dislike but i cant say there is anything to make me want more."
"Overall, I'm not sure I would pick this up again, but I know some people that may love it. It's certainly drinkable, and would not refuse it when offered one, but not what I'm personally looking for."
"Notes: One of the best ""fruited wheats"" that I've ever had! Really well done. Crisp, clean and tasty."
"I still cant get over the crap floating around in there...Something ain't right."
"Yep, this is pretty much similar to No.9 in terms of appeal to a specific audience (perhaps non-beer lovers?). Not horrible but I could find a local example that's much better and slightly different in style at VT Pub and Brewery. Still, not a bad thing to quaff if you don't feel like impressing your taste buds."
"Slightly watery feel up front, warming in the throat. A light effervescence, lightish body."
"Poured with a great huge white foamy frothy fluffy head and lots of lace. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is weird: raspberry and skunk. Got this at a quick mart type store and even given the brown glass, who knows how this beer was stored. But, by the time I got to drink it, it had warmed a bit and I can't imagine how that improved my experience. Flavor was similar to aroma. Body is thin and carbonation is ok. Finish is like flavor and diminished by body. Am looking for the sedative effect of alcohol right now prior to my trip tomorrow and cant finish this beer. Wa."
"D: not a terrible ale by any means, but I didn't finish it. A decently crafted yet uninteresting fruit beer. I'll pass in future."
" myself drinking this again"
"Drinkability: Not horrible, but there isn't much going on with this beer. Maybe on a hot day, this beer would taste a little better, but so would a Miller Lite"
"D: A somewhat refreshing, low-ABV fruit brew to either liven up a dessert or be a designated fruit beer during the summer months. A little too tart to pair with a lot of foods coming to mind, but as its own fare, it's simplistic and good enough for what it is."
"Drinkability 3.5: I could most likely drink 2 or 3 of these in one sitting, but there is nothing extrordinary about it to drink anything more."
"M - enough carbonation to keep the interesting flavors on their toes, but just an average light ale otherwise"
""
"D-extremely sweet with a nice light body. Pretty one dimensional but still very sessionable and easy drinking."
"Bone white, frothy head of tiny, airy foam which starts off over three fingers but is gone before you know it, close to zero lacing left behind. Hazy golden orange color with lots of fruit bits visibly floating within, more strongly translucent than opaque. While the raspberries are clear and distinct in the nose, overall the array of scents are light, mostly lemon peel, light honey or pancake syrup, generic malts, not really getting much wheat. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation is leaden enough to add weight rather than create a lighter sensation. Sweet comes mainly from the raspberries and, again, vague maltiness. More wheat and field grasses here as the mouth texture allows for added tactile dryness. Yeastiness softens the finish some, clean enough ending. Monochrome enough that there's not much more to say but easy drinker."
"D- very drinkable. The scent didn't bother me at all when I was drinking, and the alcohol can't be tasted at all. Solid session beer."
"Side note: Does everyone love this or Berry Weiss more?"
"The mouth-feel of this Abita is pretty consistent with other brews I've had the pleasure of sampling from this brewery. Refreshing, light, crisp, and dry are all adjectives I'd use to describe this offering. The drink-ability is also fairly good if the consumer likes raspberries. If not, I would wonder why one would partake in this brew to begin with."
"D- Although there isn't much to savor here, it certainly is refreshing."
"Drinkability: Basically budlight without the corn aftertaste with a slight raspberry flavor on the backend. Great for summer beach drinking but far from a flavorful beer."
"Not my kind of beer. It is crisp and refreshing, but the flavor and the nose aren't what I'm looking for in a raspberry wheat."
"Drinkability: After first sip, I wanted to glug the whole thing down. Of course, I had also just come in from working outside and was thirsty! I like the tartness of this brew. It reminds me of juice spritzers. I'd definitely have it again."
"Very good drinkability. The raspberry presence is assertive, but not overpowering. This would be an excellent beer to enjoy on a hot summer day."
"D: Sue me, I like this beer...it's light and easy to drink; it als brings back terrific memories - both old (first craft beer sips) and new (classmate at my 20th HS reunion who knew I liked 'good' beer and bought some just for me). I'd drink this all day, to be honest..."
"This was very easy to drink, but it didn't really seem like I was drinking a beer. There was no flavor of hops at all. It was very uninteresting."
"D: I would enjoy this one again it is a good beer, it is crisp and refreshing."
"D: Too sweet and becomes too flat too quickly to want more than one."
"D - not a bad brew. Very sweet, a pretty good raspberry wheat beer - one of the better fruit wheat beers I have tried."
"It's easy drinking and it's got a remarkable wiezeny body, but this is the epitome of a toss-off fruit beer."
"Tastes pretty much the same, medium carbonation, semi-dry finish."
"D: High, with really low ABV and nice fruity taste. Not overwhelming."
"= this is obviously a well crafted beer, but the overabundance of rasberry make it difficult for any real flavor to come through"
"It's very fruity and smooth. It's yummy to drink and leaves you wanting more and more and more"
"Pours very hazy, with a color somewhere between orange and pink, a small white head up top that quickly disappears. It's largely without aroma except for faint notes of berries. The berries come through more prominently on the palate, adding a tartness to the sweet wheat. Finishes clean, nothing lingers. Overall not bad."
"Overall: not a bad fruit beer, though pales in comparison to Lindemans Framboise"
"Drinkability: not bad, just nothing impressive."
"This is a good wheat beer with the addition of raspberries. Not sweet, but just the hint of berry that is subtle enough to create a nice taste. It has a good head, and decent lacing. This beer is excellent served with Cajun food, like Jambalaya, Gumbo, and even with Spanish Paella. It reminds me of a Belgian beer, in a un-sweeten Lambic, style."
"Wheat is more noticeable on the taste up front, segueing to a fruitiness come mid-palate. Seems a bit like fruit flavored cereal at this point. Finishes a bit watery but not unexpected given the style and the light ABV, and yet does offer a slight coarseness in texture. Offers a decent and steady carbonation maintaining a soft presence and good drinkability. Light bodied and unobtrusive, yet inspiring it is not. Would be a quaffable accompaniment to a salad with dried cranberries or mandarin oranges."
"The smell has some nice hints of some sort of berry I can't quite place, and some wheat aroma as well. The flavor is a bit of the same, again the berry flavor backed by wheat, although I wish the berry made itself more present, if it did it would be a lot more enjoyable. The mouth feel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. It is a decent beer that is fairly drinkable, but not quite what I was expecting."
"Drinkability: a pretty drinkable beer. I don't think I'm going to go out of my way to get this again, but if presented to me in the right context (say, dining outdoors on a warm day), I'd be glad to drink it again."
"This beer is probably better than a C, but not by much. It pours a cloudy dirty blonde hue. There are yeasty particulates floating about if you pour the entire bottle into the glass. There isn't much head to the beer. The nose has a nice strawberry and raspberry aroma. The taste is a bit thin and weak. This tastes of an average lager with some raspberry flavors added late in the brewing process. It's a refreshing beer that is light bodied, fruity, sweet, and just okay."
"Smooth, not a big aftertaste, some subtle notes, no bitterness, a little sour maybe, I'm not getting a lot of fruit in the palate, beer is thin (fine stylistically). The beer is unoffensive but its not very impressive. Just average. Drinkability is fine, nothing special here."
"D-Very easy going down. Nice summer beer. Chicks will dig it."
"A hazy light amber color body with a small frothy off white head , leaving little lacing , medium carbonation . Aroma is slightyl malty with light notes of raspberry and a hint of straw . Flavor is quite subtle , mostly sweet with a light berry flavor , a little wheat tang , no bitterness , a berry finish , light body with a watery mouthfeel . Quite sessionable but lacks any real flavor or aroma that I am looking for , a fun try though"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability I won't even get into. Drain pour."
"M/D- slightly overcarbonated for a Witbier/Fruitbeer. feels more like a crisp lager. saying that it does wonders for the drinkability and goes down as smooth as something like the ""King of Beers"" aka Budweiser, aka false advertising."
"More like pale orange haze. Doesn't look especially great but i give it chance because of the name, i expect a cloudy, hazy, beer. Smells like a wheat beer, but the berry smell just doesn't fit, it makes me actively weary to taste it...I was right it's your average wheat beer with an out of place raspberry taste, that makes for an unpleasant tart. It feels okay, but by this point i just want to finish it so I can move on to something better"
"Overall it's ok, and I would buy it again, especially considering its price. If only it tasted as good as it smelled."
"Way overcarbonated, I've never been able to drink two. Even when I was swilling Steele Reserve between rugby matches, I could never finish more than 1 of these."
"A little bonus for nostalgia's sake... had plenty of fun with Purple Haze in the college days."
"Notes: Not entirely disappointing but quite a weak wheat fruit beer. I feel, and all too often see, a prejudice and much sexism around the notion that there are beers for women and some for men, which often ties fruit beers to females. This common marketing strategy seems to have worked, and in an unfortunately male dominated beer culture that is often the trite criticism. The issue here is not whether ladies will like or not this beer better than others. Truth is that while not horrible this is not too great a beer, and lady or not this is not something that I will be serving at home to any guest."
"Drinkability: Not that impressed with this one. Tastes too artificial. Go elsewhere."
"Pours an orangish colored cloudy body, with a small whitish head, diminishing. Raspberry aroma, wheaty. Not too strong an aroma. Raspberry wheat taste. Some funkiness in the carbonation, almost tastes like soda water. Not too fruity, okay. Reminds me of a diet soda. Just okay, but a little too much to be refreshing. Has a taste to it, like mos of Abita's beers. Maybe it's the spring water? The mouthfeel is definitely different with their beers."
"It's certainly refreshing, but that is about all this beer has to offer. ~"
"An old favorite of mine, its easy to fine, and good to drink;several. Its biggest weakness is that it could stand to feel a bit more loftier in terms of mouthfeel, it is sort of light. The color is pretty good, a light golden color with very little head. The smell is fine, but the razz part doesn't stand out. Great flavor though, easy to drink a lot of them."
"The beer looks a bit on the lighter side,and has a smell that tricks one into thinking it will taste different."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Left about a half inch head with a small amount of lacing. The head quickly fizzed out to a small bubbly layer. The color is a very cloudy blond/orange. Lots of sediment floating around. The aroma is nice. Not real strong, but a pleasant balance of raspberry and yeast. The taste is fruity raspberry with light malt. The fruitiness doesn't completely dominate the taste. It's a little more subdued, which is nice. A very small amount of bitterness comes through in the end. It's got a light mouthfeel and is real easy to drink. As fruit beer goes, this one is pretty good. It's a little more balanced instead of just trying to bonk you over the head with fruit."
"Pours a hazy, orange with a modest white head that dissipates quickly. Some lacing that clings to the side of the glass. The aroma is jammy and wheat like, almost faintly like toast and jelly. Definite raspberry flavor but weak and watery. All in all, not bad but definitely not great. Perhaps a good introduction to fruit beers for the novice drinker which is probably why it's so popular, at least in my area. Anyway, worth a try if you've never had this style before but I wouldn't order it."
"At 4.20%ABV (heh, what a coincidence) you could drink this all night. Personally, I can't do wheat beer for an extended period. Gives me a headache. Aside from that I could probably drink a couple of these without the taste getting old. I could have another of these in the future."
"Always saw this beer at the store, finally got around to giving it a purchase. Pours a cloudy golden color, nice head to it that stays all the way down the glass, pretty good lacing too. Medium body to the beer, nice mouthfeel. Not very fruity of a smell for a 'fruit beer'. Taste is faintly tart but not lip puckering here. Nice subtle raspberry flavor. Finishes a bit dry, but overall not a bad beer. I like it isn't overbearing with the fruit flavor and seems pretty well balanced, but a but a bit bland still. AN above average fruit beer, which isn't saying much giving the pretty crappy beers in this category, but solid none the less."
"This beer pours a golden/toffee color with a one finger creamy head that recedes to a film that sticks around. Lots of sediment floating around in this brew and streaky lacing coats the glass. Nose is slight raspberry, wheat and some macro adjuncts. Taste is of adjuncts up front, filled out by wheat in the middle and a raspberry aftertaste - artificial raspberries. Light body, low carbonations, somewhat watery and thin with a very sweet aftertaste. It's easily a poundable beer, but there isn't much to it for enjoyment."
"A: Fair amount of thick, dense fluffy white head, a very light straw color, no signs of true lacing - 3.75, S: Raspberries dominate the nose, behind all the berry jam aromas there is also some dry graininess - 4.00, T: Raspberries play only a minor role on the palate, the wheat provides a crisp and refreshing touch, flavor profile is quite thin and uninspiring - 2.50, M: Very light bodied and smooth palate - 3.00, D: Quite drinkable in a lawnmower day sort of way, a refreshing beer but not one I see myself drinking again - 2.75"
"Its a medium bodied beer that poured a golden color with a purple tint. It was a mildly hoppy flavor with a hint of raspberry. I enjoyed it at my favorite pub but I dont have to have it again. Im not big on fruit wheat type beers."
"Notes from my honeymoon at Disney world. The beer had a hazy orange color. Decent lacing on the sides. Pretty fruity aroma. Dense florals and really ripe oranges are dominant. Average balance of sweet-sour with the flavoring; nothing too spectacular. Wish it had some of the aroma hints mirrored in the tastes. However, the carbonation was quite good and led the beer to be quite refreshing. Overall, pretty good."
"Drinkability- This is a decent beer, in general not really my cup of tea, not really into a very fruity wheat style beer, to me its just not a beer, this would have to be a desert beer that you could really only have one of, its got a nice flavor just not something I could visit to often,"
"M/D: Light-bodied, but that being said, but rarely am I able to drink fruity beers for a session, and this one is no different."
"D: Eh. Not really one that I enjoyed, but I manned up and finished off the mug. Good thing it was a draft special and it was cheap.  The fruit presence in this beer was too fake/artificial tasting and the base wheat beer itself wasn't anything to call home about. Can't say I'll approach this one again."
"Poured a light golden color with a decent size head. The raspberry smell was quickly noticed. Very overwhelming at first. The smell went away and so did the head. I took the initial taste expecting it to taste like medicine. But I was wrong. The raspberry taste wasn't as strong as I expected as well as the tart taste I've read about. The mouthfull was very watery and left a very watery finish. Just about no taste after it hits your palate. The taste gets worse as you keep drinking. I only had 3 and the last one was like drinking water. I'd only buy this if I were gonna chill with females who want to try something different."
"Drinkability: I mean, it's got very little alcohol so that's a plus I guess if you're putting them back, but I know bigger beers that drink easier than this. All in all, I'd say it's an avoid beer, and I was hot and thirsty when I drank it. If I wasn't probably wouldn't have finished it."
"D: Avoid."
"D: Light bodied and a little watery. Expected a little more, but still good."
"What was I thinking. Drain pour."
"Not a bad beer, but I can only drink one before it started to upset my stomach."
"this is not my favorite abita by any means, and their strawberry harvest is one hell of a fruit beer."
"I remember this was one of the first beers that I drank back in the day. I liked it well enough at the time, and I suppose it is still ok."
"I'd never order this again."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a rather hazy peach with a massive head that dissolved into just a thin line around the inside of the glass. I was rather surprised with how quickly the head disappeared. Also a crisp carbonation continually sticks to the inside of the glass. The aroma is a bit muddled. Sweet raspberries up front but help snuff out the aroma of a very weak wheat that must be the base beer. Other then that, not very much. The wheat malt adds this odd underlying tartness to the aroma. Not a good aroma because it doesn't accent the raspberries very well. I wish the tart raspberries would have been more prevalent. Would have worked better with the tartness from the wheat. The flavor is much the same. Just flat average. Smucker's sweet raspberry jam mixed with a very ho hum wheat. The berry sweetness really comes through on the tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is ok. Crisp carbonation with a slight dryness. This beer is OK. I think it might be a decent gateway beer for people."
"I was actually hoping for more raspberries aroma and flavor which I didn't get."
"D - Very easy going. Delicious summer beer or lawnmower fruit beer with out the syrupy, sugaryness to it."
"overall - I was hoping for more pronounced raspberry here. Sure, it's noticeable, but it's kind of fake and doesn't comprise much of this one's flavor profile. Drinkable, but hardly amazing."
"Tastes more like an American wheat beer with a moderate raspberry infusion. Fruitiness is in no way overpowering and is not really sweet at all. A good example of having fruit in your brew while still maintaining a 'beer' flavor profile. A refreshing summertime drinker. I like it and it seems to be one of the more popular Abita offerings."
"D= decent. It tastes so much like water but I don't wanna drink water I want beer... so decent turns to average."
"D- Very drinkable, i finished mine in about 10 minutes. Light alcohol which is always a plus. Purple Haze has a good taste but is nowhere near the top of what fruit beers can offer. I would tire of this quickly. Great to bring to a party though."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable summery, lawnmower beer but nothing that's really going to impress."
"Final Thoughts: As a beer with raspberries as the main selling point, this is nothing short of disappointing."
"Final Thoughts - One of the better fruit beers I have had in a while. Nothing spectacular, but better than some. I might have a few of these in the summer. Otherwise, I would think twice about getting it."
"drinkability: easy to throw many of these back, but the metallic taste is frustrating"
"I wouldn't call this a raspberry wheat beer, I would call it a malt beverage with raspberry flavor added. It just seems too artificial a melding. There you go."
"Very drinkable. Good complex flavors without too much sticking to the palate for a long time. Easy to make a night of drinking this stuff. Not the greatest, but pretty interesting and a good brew."
"Hazy golden orange color with a small white head that fell quickly, lacing is light. Aroma is pretty wheaty without much raspberry to speak of. Nothing really good going for it on that front. Flavor is light, with a bit of artificial raspberry extract. Almost candy-like, with a bit of Flinstone's vitamins thrown in. I don't think it's horrible tasting but it's not very good. Like liquid kid's cereal. Crunchberry, anyone? Light bodied, crisp carbonation. Second beer of the night that I will not be seaking out again."
"Not as over the top with the raspberries as some... but a very nice summer brew."
"This beer would have earned more points if the raspberries were not so hidden by the wheat. As it is, I don't think I'll have it again."
"This is a drinkable beer & would be rather refreshing after a warm day outdoors. However, it's definitely not something I would want to session with because it's kind of lacking in taste/smell."
"D: I think I could do a couple of these in a sitting but would tire of the fruit pretty quickly when I want beer. But could be a good hot summer day beer."
"Pours a hazy amber with thin but dense white head. Smell: pale malt, a mild wheatiness, and frozen raspberries, ever so slight veggie smell as it warms. Taste: pureed frozen raspberries (ever made a raspberry shake?), pale+wheat malt, a decent raspberry tartness mixes with a slight wheat tanginess. Mouthfeel: light bodied but with a nice crisp active carbonation, a little sticky sweetness in the finish. A nice, simple and refreshing fruit beer and quite sessionable as it's not too sweet."
"Nice, doughy white, two finger head after the pour. This recedes to a very thin film and eventually to nothing. Hazey tawny with lots of yeasty suspension. Tart fruits and faint, fresh rasberries stick out in the nose the most. Crushed aspirin mixed with some light rasberries and some blackberries too. Very yeasty beer accentuates the dry fruity malts. Great Summer beer with its fruity flavor,talcy dryness, and somewhat watery finish."
"Drinkability:Maybe this is just the wrong time of night for such a light beer. Maybe I'll try again on an upcoming hot Florida summer day."
"12oz screw-top bottle from The Liquor Shop in Tyngsboro, Mass. Pours a hazy amber yellow with a quickly dissipating thin off-white head. Smells grainy with touches of caramel and biscuit, with a fair bit of raspberry. Grainy and sweet, with a touch of citrus, obviously a strong undertone of sweet-tart raspberry. Light in body with moderate carbonation, and fairly quaffable. American wheat and fruit beer are not my favorite styles for sure, but this is a reasonably solid example of both. Worth a try."
"D - Moderate drinkability. Very light ABV combined with a fairly easy drinking flavor profile are pluses. On the negative side, I find the carbonation getting a bit old."
"Taste is very refreshing yet quite malty, with a good but not overpowering amount of flavor from the raspberry. I enjoy the wheat character a lot. Sometimes these kinds of beers come out so thin and watery that it's barely a beer, but this has the light crispness of wheat but with a solid flavor as well. Raspberry compliments the malt character nicely, adding a little sweetness to the light malt and peppery carbonation. Light body, extreme drinkability. This is what should be on those big budweiser signs. I could see myself having about 10 of these on a nice spring day. Unfortunately, it's 1 degree Fahrenheit here right now so I guess I'll just have to pretend."
"cloudy orange. 2 finger head. smells like malt liquor, like a 40 oz. taste, the same except with raspberry syrup added. has an unpleasant twang. i believe i will pass on this one in the future. i dont believe i would even take one for free. well not if there was any other option available that is."
"Drinkability: Light and refreshing with no lingering aftertaste. This could be a very decent session brew, especially at 4.2% ABV. I will be buying this one again."
"Something about this beer just doesn't work; the flavors seem somewhat unbalanced, and everything is just sort of out-of-whack. Somewhat refreshing, but not as much so as one would think; perhaps the raspberries just aren't one of those fruits that make a good fruit beer."
"D 4.0 - more body than I remembered but still a bit thin, nice for a mellow raz wheat, good balance for a fruit beer, not to overwhelming on the raz notes. I have good memories with Abita & PH, so I am always willing to drink one of these!"
"D: Superior drinkability, as in I polished it off in about 15 minutes (in between cutting and cooking my dinner). There's not a lot happening here in terms of taste, but I'd probably have another, especially on a hot day or with pizza."
"Abita Purple Haze is a cloudy golden ale with particles. The elastic white head has good retention and lacing. It has a very raspberry aroma with notes of lemony wheat and dough. It is light bodied; smooth and crisp, with a clean finish. The flavor isn't dominated by raspberry like the aroma is. There isn't really any bitterness to speak of. There are notes of lemon and dough to reflect the aroma. There's is an appropriate amount of raspberry, but it seems a bit artificial. Drink this when it's hot and humid."
"This beer goes down easy and at 4.2 can be sessioned."
"Blech."
"poured a foggy light orange/yellow. Not alot of head. Faint and sweet smalls of raspberry. Slight rapberry biterness, sweet tones, also yeast. Not over falovored with raspberry...still tastes like a beer. Very easy to drink, refreshing and tasty. Would make a great summertime beer bc its light and goes down very smooth. Def good nice and cold. Fun bottle and I would def recommend this if it was on a beer list at a pub. It offers something a little different. I like it."
"Mouthfeel was adequately zesty and finishes slick/smooth. A little thin in the body. Pretty refreshing."
"D: Being brought up on fake fruity drinks (like kool aid), I'm not too averse to fruity beer. But I have to be in the right mood, like a tropical feel. If i'm in that kind of mood, it really hits the spot and becomes quite drinkable."
"Solid atmosphere, an okay flavor and feel. Light and refreshing. Overall, a decent quaff for a nice change of pace."
"Drinkability: If this was a wheat wheat, I may give it higher marks, but the raspberry is very faint...There are way better fruit beers...This was really disappointing..I really do not like the finish and will be passing on this one"
"Crisp and refreshing, this is easily drinkable and an overall enjoyable experience for a fruit beer. My sister, who basically hates all beer, will at least finish one of these and mostly enjoy it. Another example of an Abita beer seemingly geared towards drinkers new to the craft scene and therefore a potential turnoff to veteran craft drinkers. Still, on a warm day, probably not a bad beer to session...this is really the only Abita flagship I would want to buy a sixer of during the summer besides Jockamo."
"Pours a hazy (who would've guessed?) light amber with a slightly pinkish hue. Medium white head that dissipates very quickly and leaves no lacing in a properly cleaned glass. Aromas of standard wheat malt but with a slightly-too-pronounced, tart raspberry presence. Tastes like weak weizen with light, sweet and sour, fruity overtones. Strange, almost skunky character at the end, though it's not very offensive. In the end, Purple Haze just seems ""fake"" to me in it's sweetness and fruit character."
"A very tasty spring water brew. If I'm ever in Louisiana, I'd like to visit Abita Springs to see the brewery."
"Pretty typical wheat with some fruit. Fruit taste isn't overly apparent, but adds a little to the beer. Nicely carbonated and light bodied. Very refreshing, which is what I look for in a wheat. If you want a wheat with a little fruit taste this is pretty good for a low price."
"D - Good drinkable brew. Nicely balanced and flavorful without being too much if a ""fruit beer""."
"Notes: not a bad beer. if you like wheat beers and raspberry you should like this. the raspberry is present enough to offer balance and flavor without being overwhelming"
"Cloudy yellow beer with a head that goes to about one half inch/Aroma is a very very faint raspberry.Taste is raspberry and wheat.Not a particularly great beer although not awful either.Probably worth one try,although I doubt many would come back for seconds!!"
"Got this beer on tap at Times Bar & Grill. I've also had it numerous times in the bottle before as well. It pours a cloudy golden color with a slight maroon hue. Small head and minimal lacing. The raspberries dominate the smell with a slight smell of malts. The taste is the same as the smell, except it is a bit more hoppy than the smell. Definitely a wheat beer by the taste. The beer is a bit watery, but this is the case with many Abita brews. The beer is quite drinkable as well. It is much easier to have a few of these at the bar than other beers you may see on tap."
"drinkability: very very easy and smooth and easy to drink. I was very suprised. One of my favorite wheat beers and proably my favoite fruit beers."
"Just not good. Really watery tasting. Needs some complexity and something else, maybe beer? Appearance is by far the best part of this beer. The idea of a raspberry witbier isn't bad, but needs more beer qualities."
"If you really must have a raspberry brew try Celis Raspberry or a Raspberry lambic."
"The smell was a great preview for this brew. Quite tart."
"Anyone find this on tap??"
"Drinkability is good if your tastes run to fruit beers. Abv must be about 5% would be my guess."
"Was definately a little light on the body. Carbonation was good.from a drinkibg standpoint the low quality lowered the score although it was drinkable. I could imagine this to be a girly training beer."
"This is an easy to drink wheat ale with little infusion with Raspberry. I thought the fruit flavor would be more pronounced. Honestly, it left me a bit disapointed. I could probably drink a ton of these if I were sitting poolside in the summer. Maybe, I should have had it in the summer instead of in autumn. It is a nice, yet unremarkable, drinkable beer. I would certainly prefer a Hoegarden or Alagash if I wanted a wheat ale. Additionally, a wheat ale with fruit influence - try the 3F Gumballhead."
"D: Definitely something to throw a girl at a party if she doesn't like the taste of beer, as my roommate put it. I concur. A light beer with a mild fruity taste. Above average."
"MF & D- light and fizzy with above medium carbonation. leaves an off flavor on the palate with the feeling of artificial sweetener or diet soda however the overall lightness and mild emptied this glass in no time."
"This is a great looking beer. There is lots of white head and tight lace. It has a golden body with a good amount of small carbonation bubbles and if you look close you will see some small sediment. It is hazy but not purple. The smell is wheat like and grass, maybe a little bit sweet. It has a spicy mass produced lager taste at first. I know it is ale but that is just how it tasted to me. This beer is crisp and only has little raspberry in the aftertaste. It is refreshing and I could enjoy a few of these."
"Average fruit beer."
"Notes from 9/19/04"
"The drinkablility of this beer would have been much higher if not for the ""fake purple"" taste. I probably won't return to this one any time soon."
"Aroma is sour with a slightly fruity smell. Appearance is similar to a cloudy, pink wine cooler. The taste is bitter and has quite a lot of malt but very little raspberry. Somewhat dry finish with some wheat flavor. Overall, It was a letdown. Maybe more fruit flavor would help."
"D - This beer would have been a perfect summer beer, but the amount of carbonation packed into this beer did not make it very drinkable to me, and the raspberry taste was more artificial to me than natural"
"It wasn't as sharp with carbonation as I'm used to, especially with wheat beers; but it was decent and I drank through it pretty quickly."
"This beer pours a golden orange color with a fizzy head that quickly disappears. Smell is citrusy with faint raspberries. Tastes of tart rasberries with a dry dry taste in the middle. The mouthfeel is light to medium body. Fruit beers are not my favorite, this one is okay for the style."
"I'd enjoy another."
"D - This is the perfect summer craft brew. Even your gf will enjoy this tasty drink. Above all its drinkable and in the end I would do a sixer any given night combined with some burning trees."
"Did I mention that I love raspberries?"
"If the beer refused to pour, I dont mind, this beer isnt' a 6, or a 9"
"Poured from stubby brown 12 oz. bottle to a Weizen glass a hazy golden amber (no Purple at all) with a half inch of white foam head with some spotty lacing. Smells of berries and wheat. Has a mild sweet rasberry and wheat flavor, somewhat watery. It is a light and very drinkable beer. I have had this many times before and will continue to. It may not be one of the best ""fruit"" beers but it is a nice change of pace if you are having a session."
"Appearance is average, with a straw yellow color, a bit of head and no lacing. Smell is decent with some nice raspberry notes and decent malt backbone. The taste is almost all raspberry, didn't taste like it was meshed really well. The brewer said this could be due to the fact that its mixed in after fermentation. Mouthfeel is medium to light in body. Drinkability is very good."
"D: Abita is one of my favorites so this review is not free from bias. I think it is very drinkable and I would always love to have some on hand in the fridge."
"As a former fan of other adulterants how could I not give this one a whirl? Out of the bottle (in Flagstaff AZ of all places?!) this was light amber with a faded plum/pink hue visible in good light. The nose was tart raspberry and some light malt. The flavors were fruity and sweet but the raspberry lacked definition. It was more general fruit sweetness with wheat beneath that. Not much else though. The mouthfeel was light and a little over-carbonated. I felt like this was a good theory that was poorly executed similar to Long Trail's Blackbeary Wheat."
"Overall-again, a decent fruit beer, somewhat subdued but refreshing."
"It was very light and refreshing. I would definately buy the occasional sixer of this."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, even among beers of its kind, I wouldn't select this one over most others."
"The name and bottle promises much. Poured out a muted, murky, yellow, gold color. Medium head. Smelled of sweet raspberry. Tastes of a tangy malt background with a slight hop finish. The most noticeable attribute of course is the sweet raspberry. It's not often that you hear a beer bottle advertise a certain flavor and then have that flavor so present that it makes you forget it's beer. In my opinion, raspberry flavoring is one thing, but the raspberry was a bit too much in this one. It tasted like I had accidentally poured beer in a Welch's or something."
"Overall I can't see myself buying this again, I would probably turn one down if offered, but that's just me. It is what it is, expect lots of fruit."
"Poured a golden body with some purplish tints, hence the name. Not very impressive. Miniscule head that died quickly but left lace patches. A quasi-sweet, I'm assuming from wheat twang, smell mixed in with a very fruity smell (more like tropical fruits than citric ones you'd find in a hefe). Light bodied, to me, it is a tad watery and slick but does pack a fruit punch power. Unfortunately, it felt like I was drinking punch and I couldn't really taste any hops or malt and it didn't feel like a beer. I prefer my ""fruit"" beers be beery. My non-beer drinking wife liked it, so I guess that's there demographic (non beer drinkers, not just my wife)."
"Overall, this isn't a bad bet for somebody who doesn't particularly care for beer flavor but doesn't mind fruit. However, I have had far superior fruit beers."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a golden/orange with very little head. Smell is nice, citrus/berries/grain and more berries. Tastes basically like a wheat beer with artificial berry flavoring added, just too much flavoring. Better on tap when I had it before. Still not even close to my top."
"D- I have no idea why I revisited this one. I'll pass on this one. Seems like more of a wine cooler than a beer."
"overall, this is a decent beer, but i dont think ill buy it again"
"Hmm. I had high hopes for this one. One of the most expensive sixers on the block. The purple hue was pretty cool. Not much else. Tasted like a typical wheat with a tiny tiny bit of raspberry flavor. Nice and drinkable but not quite worth what I paid for it."
"A little too watered down and unassertive to me..."
"Could drink this no problem, but not really what I was expecting."
"D-A light and refreshing brew that is not going to catch your attention to much. A good way to introduce women to beer or sweet tooths in general. Nothing special but glad I took a revist to one of the beers I drank during my Beast days."
"D: It goes down easy but has some issues with the flavor profile."
"D: I'm conflicted about this one. On one hand, the fruit flavors were not overdone or cloyingly sweet as in some other beers, which was definitely refreshing. Still, there wasn't much about Purple Haze that screamed ""drink me"" - it was a nice flavor and a good change of pace beer, but not something I'd really drink more than one or two of if there were other choices available."
"Serving - Bottle to glass"
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium foamy head on a cloudy, clumpy golden body. I was a bit amazed at how thick it appeared, with the bottom of bottle sediment (yeast?) literally suspended in the brew. The raspberry smell was obvious, but not overpowering. A hint of staleness and hop bitterness in there as well. Taste starts out raspberry, shifts to wheatiness, then back to raspberry to finish. Again, raspberry not overpowering, but, in fact, a bit watered down. Didn't feel nearly as thick as it looked. I'm going to have to give this another go, just to see if that thickness is consistent."
"Drinkability: Fine enough for a fruity flavored beer if that's your thing."
"Overall a smooth beer, but the combination of raspberry and orange was not quite a combination I really enjoyed."
"Drinkability: I'm surprised at such a low rating for this beer. They say, at least, that real raspberries are used, and though it's not drippingly fresh or anything, the raspberry adds a nice, balanced flavor with the wheat without being too sweet. It's not my new favorite beer or anything, but I found it pretty nice for the summer and enjoyed a few of them quite easily."
"I've had this beer many times on tap and many times from bottle. The raspberry flavor is mild but gives the beer a nice slight hint of fruitiness. The wheat aspect seems much more apparent in the flavorand aroma. mouthfeel is light and increases its overall drinkability. Its also nice to drink beer made from the natural Abita springs in Louisiana. Aside from these qualities few things stand out about the drink. Its not bad, but nothing too impressive either."
"D - Ok for a lawnmower ale, but not a wealth of flavor here and modest raspberry stays out of the spotlight which seems to defeat the purpose of a beer called Purple haze. I might try this on draft, but this is not something I would seek out any time soon."
"Was suprised by this beer. Or should I say, lack of this beer. Took a whiff after I opened the bottle, was expecting to smell something of raspberries, but all I could smell was straw. The taste was bland, and the carbonation minimal. Not a very good wheat brew, much less a wheat brew with fruit flavor. Not worth having again."
"D - Good drinkability, the sweetness does get a little old after a while but would be a nice beer in warm conditions. This beer was not my favorite."
"Poured into a pint glass. Hazy brown-orange with an off-white head that leaves a little lace. Aroma is obviously raspberryish with some wheaty esters. Flavor combines the insipidness of banana pith with the saccharinity of raspberry syrup. Those two aspects even out into mediocrity. Really light and drinkable, just not interesting."
"Suffice to say, I didn't like it, I didn't even finish it. Maybe I got a bad one, I don't know, but I expected much more out of it."
"Taste is almost like stone ground corn meal with some grain as well. Raspberry flavors in this one are nearly non-existent, and very faint, with some slight tartness on the finish. It might be a freshness issue, the freshness date on this one is of the notched kind on the label, but none of the numbers are notched on it. But still tastes crisp and refreshing. I would like to try it again sometime with a visible freshness date to see if it is any different."
"Overall, not a A+ brew but not deserving of a C either! Its a refreshing and enjoyable brew!"
"D - An OK fruit/wheat. Could go either way on the raspberries - I like my fruit a bit stronger, but I can see how some people would prefer this subtler touch. Good refreshing summer beer."
"M,D...Mouthfeel is light with great carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, being light...could have 6 or so"
"Mouthfeel is ok for a wheat beer. Not too watery but not the smooth crispness I want in a summer beer. Drinkability is ok. Wouldnt turn it down, but I wouldn't seek it out either."
"D: Well, it goes down so damn easy that it has to be at least a 4. There just isn't a ton of flavor here, however. It's smooth, but only because there isn't anything that can be off-putting about it."
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2008/05/twelve-pack-review-abita-party-pack.html"
"All in all not a real drinkable brew in my book, more a curiosity than anything. If you like this style beer it's probably worth a try, but nothing I'll be buying again."
"The body is closer to moderate than light. A bit high on carbonation in feel as there was a light carbonic bite. Overall a little to fake for me but very easy drinking. Come on it's a fruit beer what can you say."
"I would not recommend this beer."
"This would be a good hot summer day beer. Easily sessionable and not so fruity as to drive you away from it. Maybe not a bad jump for someone who is considering venturing out."
"D: I am not a fan, so I can't drink it. One of my buddies swears by this beer, but this one is not for me."
"Served to me cloudy and, well, hazy. A yellow-orange color, with a white 1-finger head that quickly fizzles away. The smell a bit too strong and syrupy for my taste. Plenty of raspberry, but more like the manufactured, processed raspberries. I found some grassy, pale malts hidden in there too. The taste, however, it much better, with more muted flavor than the smell. The taste is still dominated by raspberries, but it's more balanced between tastes: fruit, pale malts, wheat. It's got a crisp little bite to it, but it's certainly not from any hop presence. The beer is well carbonated, and is quite refreshing with a long, sweet lingering flavor. I first had this beer when living in Mississippi, and after moving to New York, I was thrilled to learn that a bar near Times Square called Bourbon Street had it on tap. I can assure you, on a hot summers day in the South, this beer is a perfect thirst-quencher. But on a warm day in the Northeast, it's pretty tasty too."
"Poured small out the bottle with a one finger head. Smelled like a fusion of grape and a good hefeweizen. The grape was somewhat dominant in the taste but not in an overbearing way and i thought it was quite tasty. Mouthfeel was a bit weak and it went down rather smooth but still enjoyable. Overall all a tasty brew, nothing to knock other people over to get at it if they are in your way but quite good none the less."
"Raspberries and grapes in the flavor, a little bit of hops come through in the end, with a little bit of added spice as well. This beer is tangy, medium bodied and noticeably carbonated. The taste is good, but it's a little watery overall."
"Overall a very drinkable brew. It is smooth and quenching; I was worried the berry quality would make it a sweet and overpowering experience, but instead they were subtle and complemented what would make a very nice session-beer in warmer weather."
"I started out giving the drinkability a 4.0, but in the span of half a beer it's gone down by half a point. The fruitiness gets to be too much after one... I'll stick with a good hefe!"
"No after taste . Not a beer I really enjoyed."
"Grapefruit-colored pour into a pint glass. Translucent with lots of bubbles rising to meet a thick layer of white head. Aroma is half raspberry / half metallic. Almost reminds me of a sweet tart. Taste is small on the raspberry/fruity notes; it's wheaty and a bit watered-down. Feels light and not as bubbly as the appearance lets on. No aftertaste, yet very refreshing. As for the drinkability, it has little to no complexity, but it's incredibly easy to drink"
"This is a raspberry wheat brew. It was unfiltered like all wheat beers, so it had that kind of clouded texture. But it had a very strong and distinct fresh raspberry flavor, with very little bitterness. Not bad for a specialty beer, but it was definitely girly."
"Pours a hazy orange peachy color. No head, no lace. Well carbonated, bubbles rising throughout the life of the beer. Slightly tart aroma in the nose. Crisp tart rasberry taste upfront. Not overly sweet or strong fruit in flavor. Bready flavor as it finishes. Highly drinkable, seems like it would quite refreshing in the summer."
"D- I couldn't imagine wanting to have another one of these."
"D- its an alright beer and quite easy to put down. A nice beer to sit back with and consume. I wasnt overly impressed though."
" No surprises here, this is exactly what I expected, it's not bad, but you find me drinking another."
"D - Light, crisp, and refreshing. A good beer for a hot afternoon. I would have again. If I ever want a light beer I would grab this one."
"GOOD NIGHT NOW!"
"But since I have had one, I don't feel the need to try it again. Not bad though."
"D - Too fruity and sweet for my taste."
"Has a best before labeling system but is not utilized on the bottle. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very slightly cloudy straw color with no head to speak of. Small amounts of bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Smell is underwhelming, slightly of wheat and a hint of raspberries. Taste is only slightly better, skunky lager mixed with fruity raspberries, finishes grainy - decently balanced. The mouthfeel is light with a stagnant carbonation. Overall drinkability is low because I didn't like the beer really at all, making it difficult to drink. Disappointing with such a cool name."
"Appears a clouded grapefruit like hue with a bright white head forms thick even streaks of lace. This is an old favorite from my early days of beerdom. Aroma contains tart raspberry with acidic sharp wheat and mild yogurt tanginess, not overly sweet like most fruit infused wheat beers these days just natural tart raspberry puree'. Flavor has creamy but tart raspberry sweetness with lingering citrus frit and sharp wheat notes sticking around on the palate. It never gets too cloying with the sweetness, a nice mix of tart and mild creamy raspberry infused yogurt with that classic lactic character. Mouthfeel is creamy with even carbonation slightly sticky with a small amount of residual sugars clinging to the palate, body overall is medium to light textured. Drinkability, a solid refreshing fruit beer that I could dig in moderation in the summer time heat, I will always hold a special spot for this one since I discovered it while living in SoCal after my freshman year of college."
"O: refreshing and gentle... two good things that all fruit beers should try to emulate. otherwise pretty boring"
"Came to the table with a decent golden coloring (no purple coloring at all), but little head and no lacing. It has a crisp, slightly fruity scent. The same for the taste, but it was hard to detect what kind of fruit was in there. It also had characteristics more like a lager than a wheat beer. It went down smooth, although there was an immense amount of carbonation for a wheat beer. I would never turn one of these down, but I won't buy any more for myself, either."
"D: i choose bush"
"D: Not a good drinkable amber, drank like over-carbonated grape juice. ugghhh!!!"
"I could see this drink being good for a real hot day, Light and tasty, or maybe as an after dinner beer."
"very cloudy yellow in the glass with little to no head the smell is light fruit i guess raspberry but it reminds me of sam adams cherry wheat also, a bit of light grain in the smell as well. Taste is fairly sharp, it starts like an average american wheat beer but then comes the fake fruit which stays pretty one dimensional and average at best. Mouthfeel is decent light and effervesent but the fruit flavoring leaves a slick sweetness that is a bit unpleasant. Decently drinkable, not very challenging and not too sweet that it is cloying, but it is tough to drink when you have better options."
"D- I can drink this beer all day long. It is one of my favorite fruit beers and up there with my wheats. I believe the closer you get to louisianna and the brewery the better the beer gets. Do a six pack its a great beer."
"I'd pass on this one. There are much better fruit wheat beers out there. Believe me."
"D: One of the better wheat/fruit beers out there, not a taste sensation, but it would make a excellent summer beer on a 90 degree day."
"Cloudy pinkish, pink lemonade like pour with a bright bleached white head that doesnt last. Smell is a bit wheaty, and mostly raspberry as expected with a touch of a metallic smell that lasted after the head faded. Taste is mostly raspberry and a bit of wheat in the finish, but its slight. I didnt like this as much as I remember liking it when all I drank was bud light and hard ciders. Its an ok beginner beer Id say, as my girlfriend liked it, and so did I when I hadnt tried or gotten used to many of the different styles or bolder flavors that I really enjoy now."
"Fresh."
" ~ I wouldn't classify this beer as a session brew or a one and done. I don't think it's a dessert beer or a breakfast beer either. If you're going to have one, have one around lunchtime. Just like I did. I don't see anymore Purple Haze in my future, unless it's rolled up in paper."
"Drinkability is nice."
"I was impressed by the taste, beer is pretty drinkable, but I'm not sure I'd want more than one or two in an evening as it is pretty fruity."
"The taste on this beer is extremely lacking and its probably one of the worst beers I've had in some time. I normally enjoy fruit beers and understand their role in the beer world but this beer doesn't even live up to those standards. Its extremely watery with zero body and the raspberry tastes very fake. I'm actually having a hard time finishing this one and I certainly won't be buying it again."
"Nose is extremely metallic with a grain edge to it. Flavor is actually pretty smooth with the fruit. Robust wheat body with a smooth and seemingly natural berry influence. Feel has a real strong large bubble hitting the tongue and a pretty standard liquid feel. Overall pretty drinkable. I will say that it is oddly earthy and robust and delivers a not so foo-foo-ey fruit beer experience. May not be the most beautiful example of the style, but it is surely interesting."
"Poured nice from the bottle, with good color to it. The aroma of raspberries wasn't very strong in my opinion, but overall the smell was good. The body was in the light to medium range, and I found it to be fairly crisp and refreshing. The raspberry flavor was present, but not overly strong which I liked since it didn't overpower the rest of the tastes. In the overall, I think its a good fruit infused wheat that I would definitely drink again."
"I only recently started enjoying ""fruity"" beers. UFO's Raspberry Hefeweizen being one of my favorites so I thought I would give Purple Haze a shot. It pours nicely but the head was quick to dissipate. There is only a small hint of raspberry in the beer which was disappointing to me. There also isn't much body to the beer. I would certainly drink this beer again, but there are many others that I would choose before I came back to this one."
"It's a good beer to have on a warm summer day, but not something to sit and drink one after the other."
"The flavor is not as bad as I feared. There's no harsh syrup taste, little medicinal flavor, and the wheat flavor gives it a nice balance. It's still a little too soda-like for me, and I have had better fruit beers, but I have also certainly had worse. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy, as expected. As Mr Burns would say ""I know what I hate... and I don't hate this."" On the contrary; it was actually a decent surprise. Worth a try if you're into fruit beers."
"Initial aroma of hoppy wheat and raspberry was amusing, but this quickly faded to a taste that was not tart, but rather flat. Wheat taste and nose tried to make itself known, but was masked by this raspberry-like presence. I enjoy some fruit beers, like the Belgian Krieks and other Lambics, but will pass on this American version in the future."
"12 oz single. Hazy pale golden with a large ,tight,bubbly white head, good laceing. Loved the aroma of this one, the raspberries are really well highlighted and as i love the smell of raspberries thats enough for me. The raspberry isnt quite as pronounced in the taste, its rather subdued and in the background to the, wheaty,grassy flavours. Palate lets this one down, very watery. Too limp. Overall a mixed bag, but i suppose OK."
"I find some fruit beers too over the top and artificial tasting at times...this feels and tastes real and refreshing...I could see this one being quite popular in the heat and humidity of Louisiana..pretty nice beer overall."
"D- Easy to down the first 2, but after that, becomes a little too fruity. If the girlfriend or wife is around, she will love it. All in all, a good one!"
"This beer didn't offer what I usually expect from a wheat/fruit beer. The raspberry flavor was no where to be found. It did have a nice smell but the taste didn't match it. A friend recommended it to me and needless to say I was not impressed and will not be trying it again,"
"Could drink a good amount of these, a pretty light brew overall"
"The mouthfeel and drinkability aren't great as it may be overcarbonated at times and really fizzes in your mouth."
"I don't like fruit beers; my wife does. We're visiting our daughter in Houston and my wife made me buy this for her. She thought it was great. It was a hazy orange color with a medium head. The label says the raspberry puree gives it a slightly purple tint. Yeah, right. Very sweet, fruity aroma. Sweet, cloying taste. My wife can drink the rest of the 6 pack."
"Well, this didn't work out, did it? If it weren't for the raspberry flavor, this would be a very boring beer. Because of it's boringness with a hint of fruit, this might make an alright introduction beer to somebody. Otherwise, I would frogleap this one."
"This is a beer that my wife likes alot, so I thought I'd give it a try. Pours out of the bottle a hazy golden color with a white foamy head. The head has minimal thickness (about a half inch) which diminishes quickly. The head that remains just barely clings to the side of the glass with a large void in the middle. There is very little lacing and even that has a hard time hanging around. The smell is good. It resonates a sweet raspberry smell followed by a slight hop and malt presence. As far as taste goes, I prefer an ale to a lager in the way of fruit beers. However, the taste is pretty good. A tart taste hits the back of the tongue followed by a very light bitterness. The aftertaste is more concentrated on the sweet raspberry flavor than anything else, leaving a candy like component in the throat. This is a very effervescent beer with a mouthfeel that reminds me of a domestic light beer. The sweetness leaves the drinkability at one beer per session. More than that and you would be likely to end up with a stomach ache."
"This brew pours a hazy, pale whitish-orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into thin lacing. The aroma is of raspberry, and V-8 juice. It is not a pleasant aroma. The taste lacks the nasty vegetables of the aroma, but almost completely lacks the raspberry too. There is a faint hint of it but nothing much. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with unnaturally high carbonation. Overall, this is a disappointing brew. I cannot see myself drinking this again."
"D: If you're a fan of raspberries, I could see drinking this frequently. Personally, I'm not, so I likely won't be drinking this one again."
"There are some fruit beers I like as a warm weather beer, and some I can't stand. This is one of the former. I can't see getting excited by this at all, but it would make a decent beer on a hot day, particularly if you are sharing with someone who doesn't like beer the way beer is supposed to taste. It's a little too sweet for session drinking, however."
"A nice smooth drinking beer. The tartness of the fruit isnt evident at first but toward the end of the brew it kicks in giving an authentic fruit character. No hops per style. Very clean. Very drinkable."
"Light crisp feel very tangy. Very good served cold making it a good summer choice. Not a beer i would buy, good for the ladies. Just couldn't get by the syrupy feel didn't want another."
"Initial head was crazy huge, but it did settle down to just above a film. Color is a cloudy gold with a touch of orange to it. Smell was rich and bready, sweetness undenearth that and a touch of sharpness. Flavor seemed bready and yeasty, with the malt coming in afterwards. The hops are there and just a touch of berry that came in mostly toward the end and in the aftertaste. Berry flavor doesn't come off as sweet, but more like what you get from those ""lightly flavored"" unsweeted waters. Aftertatse is quite dry with the berry flavor there a bit and the grains kicking around. Mouhtfeel was rich and drying but not heavy. Low carbonation. Drinkability was so/so. It wasn't really my kind of beer, but it wasn't bad or off-putting."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an unfiltered golden orange color with a thin fizzy white head. The aroma is bready malt and raspberries. The taste is pretty thin with some malt and a hint of the raspberry flavoring. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and fizzy. Overall, this is an average fruit beer that is worth a try, but I will most likely not purchase again."
"Not too bad for what it is, it was a change of pace kind of beer that I wouldnt mind trying again some time."
"Pours a hazy orangish-yellow color with a good head that dissipates quickly and leaves very little lacing (poured from a bottle into a mug). Has a fruity, wheaty aroma to it, the raspberry certainly sticks out. The raspberry is the strongest part of the taste, too, but not too overpower like Sam Adams Cherry Wheat. After the raspberry taste, the wheat is also very apparent. Has a moderate mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall a very interesting beer, while at the same time not overpowering. Worth checking out."
"Poured an attractive golden color with white head that dissipated quickly. Very smooth and flavorful, fruit flavor is much more evident than in other beers I've had. Kind of a thin mouthfeel, which seems to be a common characteristic of Abita beer. I think this is a very refreshing beer, but not something I would sit down and drink 10 of."
"Pours a dark, cloudy gold with a somewhat dusty head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are light, somewhat cereally malts with a dominant red raspberry note. Initially sweet on the palate, with a healthy amount of wheat- and fruit-derived acidity, the fruitiness is only forward during the beginning and the end. There's a bit of a sour, tightly bitter finish, though, that ruins things a bit. Fresh and lively with acidity on the tongue. Overall, this is a decent fruit/wheat beer, with good fruit flavor and some crispness. Uncomplex but refreshing, it's nothing deep and doesn't have to be."
"Drinkabilty-I enjoy this beer. As fruit beers go this has a nice taste to it. I would recommend this beer to a friend."
"Foofoo factor is high, drinkability is ok for a summer evening. Nothing I'd seek out again."
"This is something that you have to consider basic tastes as wheat beers, and especially fruit flavored ones, may not be for everyone. After having had a Frambozen recently, this was a pleasant contrast in being just a subtle raspberry flavoring. Perhaps along the lines of how the apricot is to #9. This one had a solid cloudy look typical of a good wheat beer, yellow with a medium head. You do smell the rasberry most notably, but the flavor seems a little less obvious with a sour quality. This is a nice option for a wheat beer but not hugely compelling."
"Purple Haze Wheat Brew has a fresh raspberry puree that is added after filtration. I was served Purple Haze in aon tap and clearly noted visable bits of raspberry pulp floating both in the beer and lining the bottom, where it had settled. Purple Haze is a light brew with a slight purple tint from the raspberries in the color. When I first smelled the brew, I thought it smelled more like a grape drink instead of raspberry. Once I tasted it, I definitely got a mouthful of sweet raspberry ale."
"Best by 9/21 notched on back."
"Poured into a glass with a pinkish tint, very cloudy (hazy I suppose) but not due to any identifiable yeast. The head is thin with very mild carbonation. Smell is faint, fruity, obvious raspberry. The mouthfeel is horrible, very thin, I wanted it out of my mouth right when it touched my tongue. The taste is fruity but mostly overpowering malty flavor, very little hops. Almost tasted like stale fruity macrobeer. Didn't like it. No sir, not one bit."
"Really quickly, they should send out some cheaper kegs of this stuff, maybe $75-80 a half-barrel. At a party this stuff would be awsome if it was for a good price and would beat all other kegs priced the same. I don't see too many sparkling reviews for the bottles of this stuff and college chicks could totally get into kegs of this stuff. Just a thought."
"Pours a slightly pinkish tinge on your standard wheat beer. Nose is strongly raspberry, without much else. Taste is a better mix of raspberry and wheat. Feel is a little thin, but alright. I guess I give it a slight edge because it is uncommon in terms of its raspberry flavor. However, it doesn't really do anything interesting or special with its flavor, so in my mind, it's just average. I guess check out Pynk by Yards, if you want an interesting take on the raspberry flavor."
"D-one is definitly enough"
"Eric"
"D: Super easy to drink because it has almost no taste but is smooth enough to keep the mouth happy."
"Tried this at a beer tasting. It poured a cloudy amber with a pink hue and a thin head. Smelled and tasted somewhat like bubblegum or berry-flavored hard candy. No lasting finish to speak of - though Im not sure I wanted one. I would not purchase this beer."
"poured a light hazy pinkish color with a one finger white head and some lacing. weak raspberry smell. no wheat malt, weak raspberry taste, watery mouthfeel with little carbonation. it was like drinking a watered down fruit juice. definitely skip this one if your looking for a raspberry wheat beer."
"Ugly pinkish purple color, but with a respectable head. The smell is not terrible, very wheaty. Taste is very subtle with the raspberry. I was a little afraid of this when my friend brought it over, because I don't know of a non-Belgian beer that doesn't butcher fruit beers, so the subtlety of the raspberry was welcome. The mouthfeel is okay, but thin, and this is not a beer I would track down for any reason."
"Thoroughly unimpressed with this beer. In all honesty, this beer tastes like newspaper which I have tasted before so trust me on that."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date on back label. Had a light grapefruit color with a small bubbly head that quickly went away. The smell was awful. It had the standard Abita skunk base with a sickly fruity smell on top of it. The taste was even worse. Really don't see the appeal or reason for this ""beer"". There are several fruit beers that I love but this ain't close to being one of em. (1.5, NA, ML, N)"
"There are much better wheat beers out there."
"D: Not great, not that bad. Somewhat thirst-quenching quality."
"Watered down malt and wheat taste though very pungent. Nasty skunky aftertaste. Mouthfeel was overcarbonated. Wasn't a drinkable beer. I had trouble drinking the entire bottle. It had a value macro-lager rather than a flovored wheat beer taste to it."
"Had this on a whim, and I don't regret it. Wispy head, with a purplish-amber color to it.Slight smell of berries and a tartish-berry taste to it. Simple- not overpowering, light, refreshing, enjoyable. I'll have this again for sure."
"d: not bad, but smells better than it tastes"
"(sorry gals)"
"Taste is small on the raspberry/fruity notes; it's wheaty and a bit watered-down. Feels light and not as bubbly as the appearance lets on. No aftertaste, yet very refreshing. As for the drinkability, it has little to no complexity, but it's incredibly easy to drink (in bulk, too, if need be)."
"This poured to a a plum color with a light, lacy body. The little head that it had disappeared quickly. It appeared thin and watery and a bit muddy. There is a hint of tartness and the raspberry flavor is not overwhelming, but subtle. It has nice flavor. It seems to get better with subsequent sips. I wouldn't a lot of these in one session, but the beer is a nice change of pace."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. A nice, light amber color with a pinkish head whihc was quite interesting. Okay retention; not too fast but not slow. A very nice, raspberry jam-like smell that was quite appealing and intriguing. The first taste was a little rough on the palette at first (probably due to the tartness of the reaspberries) but settles down to a nice, raspberry tasting brew that it just pleasant and easy-going. Mouthfeel was okay; maybe a little on the thin side, not much to really brag about. The beer, however, is very smooth going down and is pleasant to drink. The fact that it's a raspberry beer makes it a very fun and interesting beer. Haven't had too many fruit/vegetable beers, but this one is quite nice and enjoyable."
"Tastes of a very light, lager almost beer. Hard to say that this is a real wheat beer. The raspberry comes through in the mouth, but not very much at all. A light hoppy bitterness to follow. I would prefer it to have just a tad more raspberry to help highlight the fact that this is a wheat beer. A little to filtered as well for wheat. Will make a great summer beer."
"This brew is decently carbonated and promotes a wet frothy head that sticks around for a bit and leaves behind a little lacing to the end. The body is only slightly hazy and has a slight purple tint to it. This gives off a very syrupy and slight raspberry aroma. I can detect characters of the yeast too. This brew tastes very watery. I can't really detect the raspberry flavor, except for in the aftertaste. This brew is a bit too wet for my taste, too wet."
"One of several beers that I got from my brother-in-law, when they had to move. Its funny, because I bought this in a 6 pak a few years ago, during my Miller Lite days, and didnt like it, so I gave it to him. He ended up not drinking it, and now its back to me, which I'm glad, since my taste in beer has radically changed since then. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light pink/purple color, forming a very slight head, that left very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is all raspberry. If there's anything else there, its covered up. The flavor is very much the same, being dominated by the raspberries, but maybe with a hint of hops in the back. The mouthfeel is light and smooth. Overall, this is a very tasty beer, but not one that I could drink more than one or two of at a time."
"Even though the mouth is ok I'm in no rush to buy this again."
"Dirnakbility: good, a decent session beer if you would like."
"would get this one again...with food...not a solo beer"
"Had this one at barleys tonight. Poured a hazy amber with a decent head. Smell was over the top fruity. The taste was as well. For some reason I thought this would have been a bit more mellow. Slight hoppiness in the finish, but all I really could get out of this was the fruitiness. Won't be going back to this anytime soon."
"A decent american wheat beer. I believe the scent of this beer is one of it's best qualities. I enjoy a fruity brew every so often. Fruity brews also go well for the ladies. Keep that in mind. Overall, the rasberry flavor was gone as soon as it came. It didn't stick around. If you're impressed with a Cherry wheat (sam adams) then you're not going to be real impressed with this. High notes are: Smooth, not a heavy beer, exceptional aroma."
"I had this at the bar while watching the game. I never had it before, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a great amberish color and the smell was fruity and nice. The proof is in the taste, and this one tasted really good. It wasn't overly heavy and so I was able to woof down some food whilst drinking it. Overall, it is an ok beer and one I suggest when you want fruity beer."
"i got this in a party pack and thought i would try it first.as the name indicates i think this one was aimed at kids. the head quickly disipates and there is no lacing.cloudy appearance.i cant hardly discride the appearance or the taste.this is not one that i would have bought on my own nor will i be persuaded to buy this in the future.its not so bad that im going to pour it down the sink and i will drink the other one but this beer is not in my future."
"Drinkability: This is a smooth, easy drinking beer, perfect for sitting around in the summertime. Not the best thing to have in mid November, but the weather has been warm lately."
"Poured out a yellow golden color with a small off white head. The nose was sweet, with some berry, raspberry, cassis, and sugar sweetness. Not much in the taste ofthe beer, some malt, a slight berry flavor, but tastes more like macro lager than anything else. Has some strong carbonation, and a dry finish."
"I got this 12 ounze bottle from an Abita Party Pack and poured into a pint glass. There was no head at all, and no lace to mention either. It poured a nice cloudy goldish color. There was a complete absence of aroma. The taste was that of ""purple."" I didn't get much raspberry flavor, just the sense that I was drinking purple, which wasn't bad at all (I quite liked it actually). The mouthfeel was kind of rigid. Decent brew, not awsome. Don't drink and review."
"Pours pink. A lovely colour too. Because of the lack of head this doesn't even closely resemble a beer, even fruit beer, at all. Very hazy. Lovely appearence. Smells like a lager, with trace syrop flavouring. My first impression was of a freezie, the fruit flavour was clearly artificial. That artificiality would be consistent in the taste as well. Mouthfeel was high carbonated, lack of texture. Who's kidding who, this is just a macro lager with some artificial flavouring. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but it's far from something I'd call a good fruit beer. That overlooked it's rather enjoyable."
"No offense, of course!"
"Notes: In the end its fairly crips but nothing about this brew is all that interesting."
"Purple Haze pours a hazy orange with a small white head, but very active carbonation from a brown twelve ounce twist off bottle. You can smell the rasberry, but this beer doesn't smell good in my opinion. The taste is light, raspberry followed by a good wheat flavor. Not bad, not great. Worth a try."
"Overall - Definitely drinkable (putting down several in one sitting would not be hard), but not something that I would go out of my way to buy again."
"Poured bottle of Purple haze into a pint glass. Head was very fizzy and was gone pretty quickly, beer is a hazy orange with heavy carbanation. Smell is of corn and raspberry also some sweet nectar smell as well. Taste is of cabonation, with a slight rasberry taste to it, really other than the carbination there is not much going on in here, it kind of taste like selzter water. I would drink again but I would never pay for it."
"Drinkability/Overall: an easy-drinking, ho-hum flavored wheat beer. Nothing great, nothing offensive. It's beer. Girls might like it."
"This beer poured a hazy golden color with a quickly dissipating head. The smell is overwhelmingly berry like and slightly floral. The taste is delicate and fruity. The mouthfeel is thin. This is a smooth beer which I can seeing enjoying from time to time."
"Mouthfeel is refreshing but too watery and the aftertaste is bland and boring. Taste is light and wheaty with a brief hint of berry juice. In fairness, lacing has appeared at this point. I wouldn't say there's too much carbonation, but what little there is outweighs the lightweight taste. I dare say Jimi wouldn't travel by dragonfly to drink this watery, confused, wannabe MH # 9."
"pours a hazy peach/orange color with no head and very little lacing. Raspberry is the most noticeable aroma, but there is a hint of wheat also. Taste is bland. The raspberry flavor I expected from the smell is very muted. There is some bitterness also, but it doesn't seem to be like the hop bitterness I taste in other brews. Decent carbonation but maybe a little watery. Probably an easy drinker on a hot summer day, but I was disappointed with this one after enjoying many other of Abita's beers."
"edited to add: it occurred to me that since it was on sale, it is possible that the keg had been around for a while and thus influenced the taste. So, take this as a warning to both drinker and brewer alike that some bars may be doing your beer a disservice."
"Tastes like rasberry sparkling water with a slight beer flavor added. Clings to the mouth decently. Easy to drink, but would want a different brew after a couple."
"Drinkability - I enjoyed this brew for what it was: A wheat beer with a rasberry hit. Don't make it out to be something more, and you won't be depressed."
"D: There you have it"
"Drinkability: It did make for a nice decent Fruit beer, but I don't think I would buy this again (I'm not even sure I bought this one) because there really wasn't much going on in this beer. If you like malted wheat with a subtle taste of raspberries, then this is your beer!"
"A bar pour into a straight pint glass yields a head consisting of only a glass ring. The beer's body is mildly transparent, and is a dark hazy copper. Smells of sweet malt, prunes, cinnamon, caramel, apples, and also a bit sour. The taste starts at raspberry tartness, moves through malt grain to a sweet froot loop aftertaste, combined with a good biscuit flavor. The mouth is very light, and highly carbonated. This is a fun, easy to drink beer, that has a bit of complexity to it."
"Nice color too it, scent is great. Smells fruity and has a sweet taste too it. Goes down smooth and easy. Very good stuff if you are just looking to enjoy a beer and not actually taste ""the beer."""
"Drinkability - To each his own I guess, this isnt one I would get again, I havent had too many american wheat beer's I have cared for, but this one just couldnt do anything for me. The only appeasing part was the smell which was very misleading. A fancy label and name sells the beer, not the beer itself."
"Overall, an overly simple raspberry beer."
"Not a horrible beer, but there is much better choices out there."
"Thin but very crisp feel. If this only tasted better, this could be the best hot-weather brew I've ever tried. Incredibly refreshing, but the flavor is jut too shallow. I don't know why this is the only Abita brew available at every decent liquor store in Southern California, I'm sure they've got something better than this."
"This was almost like drinking fresh water with a touch of raspberry. It goes down easily, but so does water. Overall - too watery and boring - IMO."
"Lavender stained nectarine. Short but long lasting head of fine white bubbles. Steady walls of carbonation race upwards. A few angel hair threads of lacing are left. Dry, wispy raspberry note with some sharp tartness fills the nose along with just a bit of wheat. Initially, the raspberries rise, but in a suggestive rather than forceful way. There is a tart, crisp component that compliments as well as a slight lemon pith taste. The finish is dry and maintains the lightness, while being crisp and refreshing. Medium-light body with mouth scrubbing carbonation which works well. Drinkable, enjoyable, and refreshing on a hot, sticky Virginia afternoon."
"D: Not bad, not good. I wouldn't hesitate to bring it to a house party with Bud/Miller drinkers, especially if women will be there. However you'll never see me showing off at the homebrew club."
"Rarely do I enjoy a ""flavored"" beer. This one is a bit different. It looks like an old beer or that green tea you get at a chinese restaurant or something when you pour it to a glass. Its got a purple tint, not much head either. The smell has some raspberry scent w/ a woodsy type smell behind it. Now, the taste is different, not the typical beer, but not bad. Its actually pretty decent, but I wouldn't drink it all the time. Still, it is ok and I have nothing against it..."
"Glad I tried it, now all I can do is hope that the other Abita beers are more interesting."
"I like it. I would surely drink it again if offered, and may even buy it again someday if the mood strikes."
"Drinks okay for the style ( fruitty beers aren't my thing). Won't knock it too much, this stuff went down pretty easy when I was in Auburn Alabama. This & the amber were the only thing of interest I found..."
"I generally don't like fruit beers. This one is better than SA Cherry Wheat, but not something I would get again."
"Its a peachish-orangish-pink but not purple. The color is fairly ugly in my opinion. The small, white, foamy, quick-to-diminish head didnt help. It smells like a wheat-flavored SweetTart, with fruit juice and berry being most notable. Tastes of sweet raspberry, wheat and some weak grain with a lightly tart finish. It has a medium-thin body, watery texture and low carbonation. I guess its sort of refreshing in some way, but definitely not satisfying to me. Rather boring and weak, and flavors that werent really weak were unimpressive. This is the kind of beer for people that dont really like beer."
"I don't get this one. Pours out to a medium orange / pink hued color with an initially large head of white foam that quickly calms to a small layer of bubbles over the beer. Medium to medium high carbonation. Aromas of raspberries, malt, grain, biscuts. Taste is boring, but not offensive; weak malt, a drop of fruitiness, some light grain, and that's all folks. Mouthfeel was slightly bubbly and rather light. Drinkability is fair at best. What was Abita going for with this one?"
"Pours a pale yellow with a strong pink tint, nice white head;strange looking beer. The aroma has some notes of raspberry puree, wheat, yeast and some cane sugar...interesting. The flavor is wheaty upfront with some raspberry and sugar notes in the background, along with some yeast. The mouthfeel is light and drinkability is excellent. A very drinkable wheat beer with some mild fruit flavors...solid."
"d: easy enough to drink, although i don't think i'd really want more than one at a time. intense fruityness, but because the hops and malt are dulled out, it makes the beer an average one."
"All in all this is a pleasant summertime brew. The lager could have been a bit lighter, the beer could have been fizzier and the color could have been at least -somewhat- purple but still I'd enjoy drinking this while swinging in a hammock..."
"Musings: I buy just about every fruit beer I can get my hands on for my wife. This is one of the better ones. Dry, clean and simple with true to life raspberry taste."
"Pours a hazy peach color, very slightly lavender I suppose. Thin rim of head. Huge berry / flower smell. Excessively fizzy. Crisp body, not exactly dry, but light and bitey. The berry flavor is definitely prominent, but it's not syrupy. Actually, there's almost not enough raspberry; lindeman's Framboise this is not. The wheat and malt flavors still show through, along with a slight hop bitterness, and it's not necessarily a winning combination. Still, it's a blazing hot day in Southern California, this is a light, tasty beer, and I wouldn't mind a couple more."
"For the New Englander: basically a thinner MH #9 except raspberry. This beer is pretty drinkable, and it is also pretty tasty. It has a raspberry tartness upfront, and finishes with graininess and raspberry syrup. It is a little thin, but there is nothing objectionable here, and it is very drinkable."
"This is a strange little beer that pours a cloudy amber color with traces of purple. The head is short lived. It smells a bit like a blow pop and beer combined and that is exactly what it tastes like. if you are into speciality beers and like fruity tastes, go ahead and try it. If the idea of drinking a beer while eating blow pop turns you off, I'd go ahead and skip it."
"It pours a very pale color and is quite cloudy. The taste is not nearly as yeasty as expected, but the fruit flavor is prevailent and masks the taste of the beer itself leaving a bland aftertaste. This is not to say that the beer is quite drinkable, because it is. A great choice for a summer brew on a hot day and especially for the ladies, and, dare I say, the ""guys"" who insist on anything but beer."
"A weird pinkish color makes me seriously wonder if I'm drinking grapefruit juice. I understand this is a ""raspberry wheat beer"" but this just looks like something a kid threw together. Not much to smell here, but maybe that's the bar atmosphere (not that I'm complaining, I love the Flying Saucer). The taste was similar to the smell, just nothing there. I could get a very slight yeasty front followed up and finished with a very tart sweetness that pains the stomach. The mouthfeel was very thin which made this easy to drink, but doesn't make it very drinkable. The fire sale has screwed me again."
"Pours a dull cantalope color with a small white head. Smells mostly rasberry and citrus with a little doughy smell in there. Tastes the same, mostly rasberry with a strong wheat finish. Not a lot of carbonation which brings out a good amount of flavor. A very inviting beer that is good for all to try. A good mouthfeel and overall easy consumption. This isn't the most amazing beer, but definitely worth a try. It has subtle flavors and a great balance. Check this beer out if you get a chance."
"This is an easier drinking, more balanced brew than I was ever expecting. I thought I'd have a sip or two and have to swear this one off forever, but I'm happy to say that I'd gladly sample this one again, and it'd certainly be a nice change of pace brew in the summer."
"M & D: slick mouthfeel. Goes down pretty smoothly with a bit of bitterness at the back of the tongue. Drinkable, but there are other ones out there that I would have first."
"This one could be a decent refreshing summer time brew."
"Pours pale orange, very cloudy. Peachy-purple tinted head of dense foam reaches one finger in height and holds well leaving a few specs of sticky lace. The aroma is very weak with just a hint of raspberry and wheat and the taste is similiar... pretty bland IMHO. The aftertaste hints at dryness but with no hop flavor whatsoever, just a lingering but mild raspberry taste that manages to be not sweet nor tart. The finish is mostly clean, but the fruit pulp becomes somewhat chalky, and leaves a scummy film. The mouthfeel is otherwise decent, with a medium crispness and smooth body. The drinkability isn't necessarily harsh, but this really dissapoints as a summertime fruit beer."
"The bee empties from the stubby 12-ounce brown bottle a hazy brown color with a modest sized off white head that after its demise leaves a thin but concealing sheet of lace. Nose has a berry like sweetness, hints of cracked wheat and a nice fresh crispness, start is sweet, the grain profile pleasant and the top light in feel. Finish is light to medium in its acidity, the hops light but pleasant, the aftertaste dry, a nice refreshing beer."
"tastes like it smells. the raspberry recalls more of the seeds than the fruit and the wheat character matches the grainy aroma you might catch in the elephant house of your local zoo"
"d: could drink it all night, like an american light beer though. i would recommend other wheat beers and other rasp. beers, but together, this one is not bad, but not good either"
"Drinkability: Probably PH's strongest attribute. Thin, bright and light, this one is a great summer quencher. Could line up a few for a day out in the yard. There are, however, many better tasting beers with these attributes."
"Drinkability/mouthfeel: I am one that like carbonation, especially in the summer, and it makes this an easy to drink wheat lager. Extremely refreshing. It might even be a good beer to help introduce someone to a fruit/wheat beer(or craft beer in general)."
"Pours a orange pink haze with a white cap that was gone fast. Faint bouquet with wheat, fruity esters, and malty sweetness. Faint raspberry. Flavor was a musty biscuit with a sour citrus and very light raspberry notes. Very fake sweetness flavor that just gave it a very bland empty feeling in the mouth. Watery with med-light carbonation. Finished with a dull dry feeling. I hope I don't have to go through this again."
"Not really a bad drink, but in many ways more like drinking a bottle of flavored selzer or soda than it is a beer. Probobly great to drink on a sorching hot summer day."
"I've never been impressed with any Abita beer, save the Restoration Ale, but this is the worst offering from them I have ever tasted. Seriously, what the fuck?"
"Really only good on tap..."
"Drinkable, but I simply dont want to. I remember this beer being alot better... oh well... glad I stole it from my girlfriend's stash =D"
"Pours a hazy gold from the bottle with not a whole lot in the way of noteable carbonation. It's not noticeably purple... The raspberries really dominant the aroma of this, can't detect much besides raspberry, besides a little mild wheat. This fruit beer manages a fairly good balance in the taste department. It's not overpowerlingly fruity, but the fruit definitely comes across. For me, not very drinkable, but I bet a lot of girls would like this one."
"Body is between light and medium, is well carbonated. with a soft, wheaty mouthfeel and somewhat grainey texture. Although one -dimensionable, it's very unassuming and easy to quaff."
"I've had a few of these, and no two pours have yielded the same color scheme. So far I've seen a light purple and a orangish/reddish pour; both had nice foamy heads. I love raspberries, so the lingering smell was delightful. Tasted very fruity...definitely an after-dinner or desert beer for me. Mouthfeel was good...very smooth with little carbonation."
"Hazy amber, dont see much pink tint, but the lights were a little low. Not really any head or retention. Smells like sweet adjunct ala Rolling Rock, bleck. Taste is fairly smooth, but I'm not getting any fruit out of it. Again, there's a definate adjunct factor here. Its a smooth and easy drinking beer, but it tastes like a dressed up corn-macro."
"The appearance was a bit off setting. I don't like seeing plum color to my beer even if it is suppossed to have fruit. The smell was of a good lager with a hint of the berries, very nice. The taste like I said was very good. I think I liked this better because instead of being made with too sweet of a fruit flavor that let the berries replace some hop bitterness with a tart flavor that was very good. I would still rather have a regular beer but this was pretty good."
"I find that a single beer has two identities.... one on tap and one bottled. This is a beer that is better on tap. Pass if you see it in the bottle but it may be worth a try on tap."
"Poured with a hazy light pinkish/purplish color into an average pint glass. Has a pretty average smell to it, with a hint of the raspberry flavor that is contained within. Has a clean taste, with a bit of raspberry flavor that reveals itself to you slowly as your drink it. The mouthfeel of this beer is crisp and clean, its a perfect beer to take the edge off a hot summer day(or a hot meal). I wouldn't call this an amazing beer, but it definitely has its place in my beer fridge."
"It poured a very odd color, a purple haze, as the name suggests (well actually it was more of a murky pink - but there's no Hendrix song they could attached that to). It wasn't very appealing. It had a wheaty aroma with hints of raspberry. The taste was somewhat sweet, somewhat watery - more iced tea than beer. It is tart with a light body. The small 6 oz. sample was plenty, this wasn't something I would drink often."
"I can't believe i wasted 15 bucks on their party pack. So far full of dissapointments. And halfway through last nights i ended up with a migrane. I blame it on the brew."
"It pours an off-color red with a good sized frothy head. The nose is malty, with hints of fruit, quite nice. But then it falls flat the taste is rough and sorry to say kinda just falls flat then the hops hit like a train wreck. I am not sure what the fuss is about with abita but this is just kinda average to bad"
"Appearance was just slightly hazy, but very clean looking for a wheat style beer. Color was an apricot honey shade with an interesting light purple shade around the circumference of the glass. Head receded quickly, but cling was nice. Aroma was of artificial raspberries, bread, dank hops and yeast. Taste was of raspberry flavor mostly, but much like it smelled with a bready aftertaste and dank hops suspended in the brew. Mouthfeel was smooth to watery. I wasn't sure what to expect before trying, but really not bad."
"You know this is one of those beers that I shouldn't like but I do. Normally, I don't gravitate to fruity American beers - that are not Belgium-styled or Lambic in nature. What can I say, it's quirky and I like it. It has a very high drinkability. It pours cloudy amber with very light reddish-pink (yea maybe light purple) hazy look. It smells like a breakfast cereal with a light fruity smell. It has a light head in my mug with little carbonation going. It tastes light and refreshing with an overtone of raspberry almost like a candy-raspberry. It's almost like ""beer cool-aide"". Like I said, I shouldn't like but I do. On days I'm not too serious and want to just quaff a few pints of a light beer I sometimes make it Purple Haze."
"The beer is very drinkable, I'd say it's just as drinkable as Bud, Miller, or Coors. Since it goes down like water how can it be hard to drink. I probably won't ever buy this beer again. I just hope that my homebrew is better than this. I don't think that it'll have much of a problem tasting better than this, the standard has been set pretty low with this one."
"Not a great head, but an exceptional beer. Goes well with any cajun food and is GREAT on tap. It is a raspberry beer, so don't expect anything traditional. But it is a bit stronger than an average beer and has a great taste. It is not incredibly complex, but as far as raspberry beers, it is the best. But then again, I am from LA, but I would say it goes best w/ crawfish etouffee. Solid w/ LSU football. Order it at the CHIMES in Baton Rouge and relax. Very sentimental beer for me, considering I got my first one when I could drink LEGALLY AT 18."
"Cloudy golden colored with a hint of pink. No head just a laced circle around the rim of the glass. Smell was part fruity and part grainy. Didn't have the raspberry ""omph"" that I expected. Taste is wheat up front with a fruity medicine like aftertaste. Felt thin and a little syrupy in the mouth. I simply just did not like this beer. If you like it you could probably throw a few down. Maybe would be better on a hot summer day."
"Tastes like iced tea with a slight raspberry flavor. Poured a hazy orange with a tinge of (you guessed it) purple. Not much of a head. Mouthfeel was fairly flat but it was expansive on the tongue. Aroma is little bits of wheat and raspberry--but not lots of either. Flavor reminds me of iced raspberry tea. Little bitter but more sweet from the frit and the wheat. The raspberry is also more of the sweetness of the fruit than the bitterness of the fruit."
"($ / 6-pack)"
"from biglove. poured true to its name a hazy light purple with a small withe head. aroma sour fruits witha touch of sugar added, raspberries, sligt hints of malt, flavor sour raspberries and other sour fruits, dry. this is another one of their beers that would be good on a hot summer day and you want to throw down a few"
"Not an every day thing but good enough to be in the outer rotation."
"This isn't really my favorite style, but overall I'd say it's an OK beer. Kind of odd, but refreshing in its own little way."
"Pours a cloudy amber color similar to other hefeweizens. Copious creamy white head that fades slowly. No precipitating carbonation, but a slight amount of yeast residue. Barely-there nose primarily of wheat. Definite blueberry flavor on the first taste, yet not too sweet. This is the predominate flavor. None of the usual citrus flavor associated with other witbiers Ive tasted, or any other ""bite"" for that matter. Watery, mildly bubbly mouthfeel. No discernable aftertaste. Drinkablility is excellent; it is tasty and refreshing. However, overall, too much is missing, making it an above average but hardly noteworthy brew. Probably a good beer to get your macro friends to try."
"Drinkability: Except for the nose, I actually like this beer; I wouldn't drink it regularly but it is very refreshing on a hot day"
"This beer gets a lot of criticism among serious beer lovers, yet it's one of the best selling micros out there. Having reveiwed it once before, I am revisiting the growler version. Looks like grapefruit juice. Poured a cloudy pinkish color and released a dainty white head that laced well. Smells sweetly berrylike. Has some sour notes from the fermentation-green apple like. Tastes mildly sweet of berries and adjuncts of corn or rye, citrus grapefruit, and tart raspberry and green apples. Mildly spicy of corriander. Low hop flavor, but moderate bittering that chases into the finish. Body tapers from creamy to thin in the finish. Finishes cleanly bittered (grapefruit rinds). No presence of alcohol and a light aftertaste. This one is growing on me, although you won't see it in my cart anytime soon."
"Cloudy,straw colored with a touch of pink. No real head present. Low, fruity aroma. Slight rasberry smell but it doesnt scream at you. Some malt flavor but the fruit comes thru more so. Tart. Sort of one dimensional. Average body-weak,almost watery. Very ho hum overall-theres definately better fruit beers out there. I dont even see this one a decent hot weather beer."
"Purple Haze, the non-purple beer. It pours a pinkish orangish color- looks like juice. The very white head looks striking against the juicyness, and the bubbles, they never go away! It's great. Smell is sweet, fruity, mostly raspberries. Taste is fruity and berry as well, but... a weird off aftertaste- garbagey- like stale soda. It's not overwhelming, but it definitely makes me hesitate in opening another. Mouthfeel is light, but a little watery. Overall an okay beer, but the aftertaste kills it for me."
"A decent summer type brew that may appeal to ""non beer drinkers""."
"Pours a dull hazy orange with a thin cap of head and a little lacing. Smell is a light rasberry over a wheat background and little off skunkiness. Taste is pretty malty upfront, but then a rasberry tartness hits you at the end. Not very strong rasberry, but what's their is too sour and articificial. Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied and rather fizzy. Picked this beer up because I liked the name, and can't say I'd do it again."
"-UF"
"poured a light rasberry color with large white head. Smell is of berries. Taste is a tart berry flavor that causes a dry fell in the mouth. Not much to talk about with this beer. Seems like I could do the same by adding a little cranberry juice to my beer."
"D&N: A beer that a fruit beer lover like myself could quaff all day. Super easy drinking, nice flavors and aromas. If you like fruit beers, don't pass this one up."
"It's ok, dog."
"D: For the summer, this beer is a simple and smooth drinker. Refreshing and crisp in the taste, and well represented in the mouthfeel. One of the better fruit beers on the market."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" bright white head above the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head lasts well, and laces excellently for a fruit beer. Aroma is lightly fruity, with a sweet malty, almost adjuncty tinge to it. Taste is light malts with a crisp fruitiness, and a dry finish. Seems like it would be somewhat thirst-quenching. Mouthfeel is smooth, but the drinkability falls off a bit due to the fruitiness perhaps getting old after a bit."
"Notes: The raspberry flavor is a little to artificial tasting."
"Hazy orange color with some raspberry highlights around the edge of the glass. Head starts off good but then sizzles down to a small lace. Probably a result of the acidity raspberry juice added. The aroma is dominated by raspberry tartness and soft grains. The first thing I notice in the taste is a raspberry tartness, but not over done however. Soft grains follow afterwards and a semi-dry finish. Has a light to medium mouthfeel that is a little acidic. I am not a fan of fruit beers but I must say I enjoy Purple Haze. This is because no flavors are over done or come off as fake."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a little carbonation and a thin lace of head. Smell is all raspberries and is pleasant but nothing special. Taste is is quite bland and a little disappointing because it's weaker than the smell. It's a a little dry and could be a little sweeter. Mouthfeel is outstanding. It's perfectly carbonated, slightly dry, and you can actually taste the beer before you even swallow it. Drinkability is only a little average because it has great mouthfeel and smell but the taste is a little disappointing."
"This beer pours a light orangish color with a weaker fizzy head. Aroma is cereal grainy and a slight fruity undertone but I couldn't describe what fruit it was. I didn't know this was a raspberry beer until about midway through which shows how subdued the raspberry character was. Much more of a wheat beer than a fruit beer. Fruit seems like syrup and a little artificial but not terribly cloying. Lighter bodied and a little fizzy. Finish is moderately acidic and rather forgetable. I could drink about two of these before getting bored and moving on."
"I could have maybe two of these max in one session."
"Maybe it was the 95 degree heat outside, but I found this one to be a refreshing easy drinker. I would have no problem having one from time-to-time"
"Drinkable, especially ice cold."
"Thanx 4da beer Biglove."
"Picked this up from ""To Your Health"" (Coralville) so I could compare a raspberry wheat I recently made to a commerical example. Poured a two finger pure white head over a very cloudy light dirt rust liquid (I stirred the sediment and poured it in). Smells were limited to raspberry with an acrid quality about it. Taste was smooth and sweet. Cool and nicely raspberry. Raspberry started from the get-go and was a gentle presence throughout. Clove was hidden beneath the raspberry. Aside from that all I could get was a watery flavor and maybe some pear on the tongue. Md light mouthfeel and mild to moderate carbonation. This would be easy drinking on a hot summer day. Nothing to get exceited about, just a pleasant beer."
"Overall impression: Thanks to BigLove for the chance to try this one. Nice light summer brew - good berry flavor without being artificially sweet."
"One of my friends came over with a new beer tonight after I had already had quite a rough session of my own, including another new beer. This one was a somewhat dark for a wheat, but still looked the part. The smell was of wheaty malts and rasberry, as was the taste. Nothing exceptional, but merely what the name delivers. Decent, but not something I would likely spend a night with."
"a bit odd in appearence. def. hazy though so they got that right. lightly wheaty in the aroma and sure theres the little fruity notes. taste wise...lightly wheaty and lightly fruity, go figure. balanced yes, just not a very flavorful beer. refreshing as all hell and crisp in the mouth finishing with a well carbonated tingly bite. a good beer for what it is."
"Did I even get the right draft sent to me? I had no idea this was a raspberry flavored brew until reading this site. It makes sense with the name (which I really like), but nothing reminded me of similar beers of the style. Definitely disappointed, a bit hoppy on the tongue. Paid $3.50 at the Mellow Mushroom in Atlanta."
"Give it a shot."
"I admit to not being a fan of non-lambic fruit beers, but this one is slightly better than most I've tried."
"Received as a part of the Confederate BIF from BigLove, this beer came is a brown 12 oz. bottle with a psychedelic label. The beer looked cloudy, and fizzy. The head was foamy and left some average lace. The aroma did not emphasize fruit, but instead this smelled more like a yeasty wheat ale with some sour mash. The taste was light with raspberry flavor coming through in a very subtle way. Unfortunately the malt base backing the fruit was very bland and flavorless, which was all the more surprising since the body was not too thin. Hardly any hop presence. I had seen this beer for a while on the shelves and had been avoiding it, since I am not a big fan of fruit beers. This one is not awful, but it wont change my opinion about the style."
"I will stick to the Abita Amber, which I think is quite nice."
"Overall I was hoping for more from this beer. The promise of a wheat beer combined with raspberries made me look forward to trying it, and the appearance certainly hinted at that. The taste fell a little short. It had a nice raspberry flavor to it, but was lacking in wheat-beer character."
"The taste was quite weak. There was a slight raspberry front that fades in and out through out the beers trip across the tongue. A nutty hop finish hits strongly at the end, and a sleight hop taste is present throughout. Although very effervescent, the beer is on the thin side. All in all, a rather hum drum experience."
"Drinkability  This wasnt really that bad of a drinker. It delivered on what it promised, thats for sure."
"Caramel color and poured up very cloudy with lots of sedement. Big frothy head faded fast. Bland aroma that doesn't really go with flavor. Malty taste quickly gives away to rasberry flavor. I wasn't really impressed with this beer. I was more intrigued by the name. Perhaps it would be better with Jimmy. Probably wouldn't recomend it."
"After reading some positive reviews by others, I'm wondering if I just drank a skunked beer. Maybe I'll pick up a fresh bottle and give it one more try..."
"12 ouncer, has a hard to comprehend, consume before date notched onto the label. better then nothing but not much. this one pours a cloudy cantaloupe melon color, moderate carbonation and body. Nose is subtle fruityness. this is litely flavored wheat like concotion. Soft malty up front, notes of fruit, sweet berries, flowery. Slight hop bite in the finish. Light, fruity, sweet and refreshing, worth a try if you like em on the light, mild, fruity and sweet side. Good for light fare and dessert."
"Easy drinking fruit beer, not especially exciting but I'm sure it would be refreshing on a hot day."
"Good for a raspberry wheat, but nothing to kiss the sky about."
"The foamy lace was thin and the beer was a cloudy orange-red color. I did not particularly enjoy this brew at all."
"Drinkability- Nope. Stay away. It's unlikely we got two bad batches over a year apart. My number two worst beer. I don't think it will be suplanted any time soon."
"Comments - I was a little surprised by this beer; it was better than I thought it would be. Drinkers of heavy, complex Belgian beers will probably want to look elsewhere. Many folks seem to be unimpressed with Abita, but I would suggest that this beer is a pretty good showing."
"Sampled on draft, Flying Saucer, Ft. Worth, Tx. A hazy orange beer with a minimal, white head. Raspberry and floral aroma. Raspberries dominate the flavor to the exclusion of practically all other ingredients. Smooth and easy-drinking. The cool name outshines the quality of the beer."
"Overall Impression: (4) Easy drinking thirst quencher. Ive fond memories of many, many, many mugs of hazy on Bourbon Street watching the timeless exchange of beads for pleasure. Its hard to be impartial. Still, while this isnt a BA kind of beer, it is a nicely done fruit lawnmower, the value of which should not be undervalued until you feel the sauna that is the Gulf Coast in August."
"An inch and a half of white fizziness sits on the hazy, orange-gold, blushing beer. There are peanuts (of course) and overripe raspberries in the nose. Raspberries abound in the dry (but not tart) front. The middle is thinnish, fizzy-tingly and sweetish with raspberries. Finish is again mostly berries, but also grainsy and a little bitter. It's not bad. The raspberries are a nice offset to the Abita peanuts."
"Weak bodied and overbubbled. There is very little to this beer, and even less that's enjoyable."
"Purple Haze. Such a cool song, such a cool name and such an uninspired beer. Abita owes it to themselves (and to us) to brew a kick-ass raspberry wheat that bears this name. I'm waiting..."
"Pours a two-fingered white head leaving little lace, reddish/amber color. Medium carbonation, light bodied. Slight raspberry nose. Starts with raspberry overtones with the wheat right behind it, very easy to drink. $1.49 for a 12 oz bottle from Liquor Barn, London, KY."
"Not even a summer refresher, or a lawn mower beer. I doubt I'll have it again."
"Pours out a hazy, copper color. A small head appeared and quickly disappeared, leaving only a tiny ring around the edges of the glass. Smells quite interesting. I definitely detect the smells of a typical wheat beer (mostly bananas), but can also detect the underlying fruit. I'm not sure that I'd be able to pin it on raspberry if the bottle didn't tell me that's what it was... but it does smell fruity at least. Taste is fair to middling... faint wheat taste with faint raspberry and some twang. Finishes sort of bland. Mouthfeel is thin... not overly carbonated, but still doesn't really have much body. This is fairly drinkable... no better than an average craft beer.... but certainly much better than a macro. Nothing I'd recommend to anyone seeking a new wheat beer though."
"An interesting brew. Very light, delicate and well-balanced. A difficult beer to pull off correctly,but I need a little more ""Oooomph"" in my brew. About as good as you can get when it comes to cross-over brews. Ok, sue me for being a pig, but this brew is for sissies, and I mean that with the utmost respect:)"
"Overall a dissapointing beer."
"Abita's Purple Haze is a raspberry flavored beer that is fairly easy to find in Lousiana and Texas. Purple Haze pours a fittingly hazy dark peach color with a pretty large head. Smell is fairly standard with a sweet fruity finish. Taste is really smooth with notible raspberry finish. Overall Purple Haze is a very drinkable fruit-flavored brew, but it isn't something I'd want to drink a lot of in a single session. I see Purple Haze as a quality novelty brew and well-worth a try for beer enthusiasts."
"A sweet linger for such a dry product.."
"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy light peach color with one finger of head. There is a little lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly fruity, with hints of wheat and yeast. Not a very strong aroma though. The taste is light and fruity at first, and is then overran with diacetyl. It's like they tried to make a butter flavored beer. The mouthfeel was only fair, and the drinkability lacked some due to the horrible diacetyl taste."
"impressions: interesting, but this is one of the few beers that seems to NOT get better as the glass is less full."
"Not terrible but not impressive either, this beer tastes more like a soda than a beer. Very light and watery, not much of a head to speak of, dull orange typically cloudy wheat color. You can really taste the raspberries at the end, tastes like they flavor this after and not during the brewing process. A shallow wheat beer with no standout characteristic other than the raspberries, and too watery for my taste. This might make a fair summer beer depending on your taste, goes down easy but so does a cool glass of water."
"Pours a hazy orange-honey color. Nothing purple about it. Low off-white sinking head. Low aroma of sweet fruit, a little grapey, but no malt or hops. Mouthfeel is watery and tingly, too much like soda. Flavor is juicy, pretty empty upfront, and all in the finish, where the raspberry finally makes itself known. The raspberry lingers in the aftertaste a bit. Flavor also has no malt or hops. This one has no depth, and is out of balance."
"Drinkability: If my next bottle was free, I'd probably pass on the offer."
"This beer poured a hazy orange/gold color with a lot of carbonation and practically no head. There was a very fine film that formed. The aroma was merely average as well with just a hint of raspberry and malts. The taste was fairly wheat-filled in the beginning, before giving way to a slight raspberry flavor with some other fruit tones lingering in the background. Overall, the drinkability is moderate at best and I don't think I would buy it again."
"Very pale yellow brown color, after the pour you see alot of big bubbled carbination. the head went into nothingness. You do not see alot of carbination while it is sitting in the glass. I catch mainly a citrus smell and flavor, but nothing really presents itself as overpowering. Heavy water taste with alot of carbination hitting your tongue, slight champagne memory-but maybe one that was hit with seltzer? Very light taste and feel, good for warm days or warm bars, beer gardens. Smooth but nothing that jumps at you with a main flavor, the raspberry seems like an afterthought, which is not a bad thing, but the beer itself does not have anything to compete."
"Nope... it's not really purple! Pours a hazy pale yellow, with maybe a hint of a pinkish color. Small white head disappeared quickly. Smell was pretty nice, mainly raspberries with a little wheat. Very light malt flavor with raspberries noticeable, but not as prominent as in the smell. Watery mouthfeel, fizzy carbonation. Not bad... just not exciting! I don't think I'd buy this again, but I wouldn't refuse it if offered to me!"
"Beer is good. Happy Beering."
"Great aroma, smells like fresh raspberries, with a skunky hop aroma underneath. Light tan colored head fades fast to a film. Hazy, light golden colored beer. Clean, light, and refreshing beer. Crisp raspberry flavor sits atop a light wheat base. There's really not much to the beer, and the finish is clean. It's toward the lighter end of the fruit wheat beer spectrum, but there's not much to complain about."
"Pours a hazed orange color with barely any head at all. The smell is that of a light hint of tart fruit and light burnt grassy notesodd! The taste is of light malts, faint hops, and a hint of alcohol and fruit and a sharp carb bite. This is a very, very light bodied beer that has a watery mouthfeel. Kind of strange, but I was expecting it after having other beers from this brewery. This strange brew is middle of the road to me. Cheers!"
"I did happen to like this beer better than Pete's Wicked Winter brew, another raspberry wheat. The flavors in this beer were not bad, but it just wasn't terribly interesting. This might be good as a hot weather brew. Drinking this was an underwhelming experience. I doubt Jimi would drink this beer if he were around today."
"Very drinkable, about the same as iced tea."
"Appearance was just average IMO. Hazy orange with virtually no head and no lacing whatsoever. The smell was also just average, barely a hint of the raspberry flavor inside. The taste was where this beer shined though, and I guess that's a good thing considering it's really the most important thing to consider. It had a crisp wheat flavor with raspberries and other fruit undertones. The raspberry was not artificial tasting at all, very nice. Mouthfeel was good, reminded me of a wit, very crisp. Drinkability was good as well, went down very smooth. this would be a nice beer on a hot summers day. Give it a try of you like fruit beers."
" Nothing purple about this one. In all fairness to the brewery, I will assume my bottle was several months past the freshness date, but don't know this for certain. If this was a fresh bottle, I don't know how they could sell much of this."
"The beer pours a hazy pinkish gold color with a spotty lace head. It's not a very good looking beer that's for sure. The aroma is weak, but smelling of raspberries and pale wheat malts. They could use to increase the raspberries used in the brewing of this one. For one, it would increase the ""purple"" color and the aroma of the fruit. I had to stick my nose practically in the beer to get a wiff. Also, the flavor would be more pronounced. Brewers always pussy out on the use of fruit. Anyways, the taste is average. It is quite watery with a slight raspberry aftertaste that hangs on your tongue. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks fair. I liked this beer until I looked at it critically."
"Yellow-peach in color with chill haze and aggressive, bubbly carbonation. Small and short-lived white head. At the forefront, the aroma is the citrus-like tang of a wheat bear. Faint berry aroma is there as well. I wasnt really impressed with the smellits sort of underdone and artificial. Taste is essentially that of a sub-standard wheat beer with a little raspberry. Watery, thin, and overly carbonated. This beer really didnt do it for me."
"I found it to be very drinkable and am looking forward to drinking more of it when I can find it."
"Have bought this for my wife many times as she came to like awhile back,pours a hazy orange with a light puple tint to it usually not much head pretty flat lookin.Aroma has a graininess to it with an artifical raspberry tinge to it.Taste is up and down has some decent raspberry flavors to it with a light wheaty malt flavor vut it really sputters out about half way down the glass.After one bottle I normally cant drink anymore its cloying,the sweetness really comes up fast on ya."
"For girls, at least that's all I see drink it. I'll steer another direction."
"It is sticky in the mouth, but carbonated. I have seen people order a pitcher of Purple Haze and come back for more. I guess it is an aquired taste, for me one was plenty; for a lifetime."
"Notes: Two middle fingers up; would only redrink this under threat of force."
"12 oz twist-off with freshness date notched on the back label. It's not purple, but there are tints of it. The raspberry aroma is quite potent, but the raspberry is a more subtle with the flavor. It's there, but not overpowering. It's pretty crisp, like you'd expect from a wheat beer. I think it's a solid effort, but certainly not extraordinary."
"This beer just screamed coolness to me. Named after a Hendrix song and a cool purple label. Big let down. First it poured a bland yellow color (I wasn't really expecting it to be purple, but the name fooled me into thinking it would be non-boring). Had a medium quickly dissipating head and left no lacing on the glass. The aroma was a little grainy and there were a few fruits, but mostly just the normal mass-product smell. The flavor was boring as well. A little malty with a tiny tiny bit of fruit in the flavor, but not enough to even mention. Big disappointment."
"Hey! I like Jimi Hendrix! And here's a beer named after him! Maybe I'll like the beer too! <pours> Hmm. Not much to look at. Clear gold in color, with an uneven head that reminds one of what Jimi's fro would have looked like if he'd stuck around long enough for a splotchy baldness starting setting in. How bout a sniff? Ugh. Well, let's see. Hippies smelled bad, so maybe they're trying to make some sort of a statement here? I would have preferred patchouli oil, however, to the rather skunky blend of raspberry and tart wheat that I found here. I'm not looking forward to the taste, but, surprise! It's actually not horrible! The raspberry works well, and the malt actually lends a bit of a chocolate undertone to the beer. Still, however, the flavor is a bit one-dimensional, and the hops are quite muted in the finish. More like the many cheap imitators that would follow Hendrix than the original deal."
"Overall not a bad beer. Not what I expected at all. Very malty and easy drinking with a touch of raspberry."
"Fizzy dull dark yellow, not quite the shine to be golden. Small white tight head, faded fast. Mixed smell of fruit punch, faint raspberries, and grains. Sweet syrupy taste breaks through, then fades. Some more raspberry flavors settles in. Flat, light carbonation and prickly sweetness. Not very refreshing. Overly slick. Sampled 2x while in Birmingham. Maybe there is a bad batch out there, but this one was a dissapointment."
"Started out with a good looking head that reduced to almost nothing.Has an appealing color with a thin white head,Very cloudy with tons of junk floating around.I hope its wheat and not dead yeast.Very pungent raspberry nose thats very tart smelling.Color is a straw yellow.Foaming mouthfeel that leaves a ""full"" feeling in the stomach.No traces of lacing left.The raspberry flavor isnt that good.The aroma of raspberry makes the taste a big let down.Crisply carbonated thats easy to swallow.Its OK in my opinion.I wouldnt buy it again nor would I reccomend it.Maybe real raspberries instead of raspberry flavoring would make it better."
"I seriously think I could have thrown some rasberry extract in a glass of PBR and gotten the same results. The ""wheat"" mentioned on the label is barely detectable, much less delectable HAHAHAHA... ugh. Where am I going with this... Oh yeah, if I was in the mood for something fruity I'd eat a banana, dangit. I was really disappointed with Purple Haze, but maybe I expected too much. It's a cheap beer with a very slight rasberry taste. Nothing more, perhaps a little less."
"Purple Haze poured a cidery brown color, clouded with unappetizing chunks of sediment, and a weak, foamy white head. Aroma is light, a tiny bit of raspberry and banana. The taste is also very light, nice and fruity without being too much so, with a slightly sour aftertaste. Not extraordinary for a rasp-wheat, but not bad either."
"This is a murky amber brew with a minimal white head that dissipated much too quickly leaving only small hunks of lace on the glass. The aroma is definitely impressed with a raspberry presence and this carries through into the taste, a fruity presence that overlayed the wheat base. This is an ejoyable beer that fruit beer drinkers will enjoy in the good old summertime."
"Pours a light and murky amber color with a medium off-white head. Decent lacing. Aroma is raspberries of course, but really nothing else. It might have something to do with the fact that I was building a deck in almost 90 degree temperatures, but I found this to be pretty easy to drink. Light bodied and very crisp, and fortunately the raspberry flavor is not as overwhelming as it is in other beers of this type. Clean finish. Nothing award-winning in my book but a passable summer beer."
"That does the trick sometimes though, and I'm sure this would be quite a hit with the ladies at the beach."
"This Purple Haze pours a nice light golden yellow. A fat head gave away to a thin lace. The aroma is raspberries, nothing else. The aroma is not overpowering like most fruit beers. The taste is a touch of wheat with the raspberries and a bitter finish with hops. The raspberry flavor washed away to nothing after the swallow. It started out nice but ended up watery. I was hoping for a bit more fruit in the taste. The watery finish doesnt make me want to drink more so it is low in drinkability. Overall not bad, average or a bit above."
"This beer poured into the glass peachy in color that was fairly cloudy. It produced a minimal head that lasted a whole two seconds then formed a slight skim and ring along the surface. Very little lace to none was found on the edges of the glass. The aroma was fairly light. Noses of tart fresh raspberries, wheat grain, bread and a slight malt at the end. The taste was also fairly light and simple, flavors of light raspberries, wheat, grains, bread and bitter hops all were present. The over all feeling of this beer was it was watery and the flavors were overly diluted. I liked the raspberries and wheat combination just wish that they were combined better to give a crispier feel to it. Drinkable, but there are better fruit beers out there to try first."
"Color is cloudy pale yellow, white fizzy head faded fast leaving a skim of whisper light white haze on top that stuck around the whole glass and had some very small spotty lace. Smell is mostly wheat, pretty sharp with a very slight note of raspberry. Taste completely mirrors the smell with lots of malted wheat, a tad breadish with a ever so slight presense of raspberry. Has a zesty sweet sharpness thats dulled a bit at the start and then airs out with a mellow smoothness. Feel is light to medium bodied, a bit zesty and grainy. not bad, drinkable, ya sure, but where's the raspberry?"
"Orange in color on the pour, with little-to-no head - what does show up is gone quickly. I expected better. The smell is alright - yeasty with a hint of raspberries. The taste is crisp and malty, fading to a light hint of raspberry flavor. The mouthfeel is all over the place, finishing up with a tingle of raspberry at the back of my mouth. Drinkable, but I'm slightly disappointed."
"Thanks to Morris729 for the bottle!"
"Indeed they don't, as this isn't the best fruit beer I've had by a long shot. Pours a cloudy golden color with a pinkish hue. Aroma is of tart raspberries and yeast. Raspberry flavor is pretty mild which is good-it doesn't overpower the other flavors. However, there arent many other flavors. Wheat flavor is present, but the aftertaste has a nasty malty macro thing going on that isn't too great. This beer is refreshing, but for a fruit or wheat beer, there's much better out there."
"Very little raspberry taste, more wheat tasting than anything. I dont really care for fruit beers - fer fruits only I guess. Golden-yellow hue. Sticky small white head. Nose of light rapberry, sweetness in the backdrop, dry palate, acidic finish. This is nothing I will seek out."
"F."
"Hazy pale straw color with tinges of lemon yellow at the fringes and an interesting suspension of sediment. A substantial head upon pouring, though it dissipates quickly. Nose is underwhelming with just a mostly clean grain smell and the slightest hint of fruit. Very watery mouthfeel with a taste that is grainy and weak, much like the nose. Sweet at the start, turning crisp, and then getting very smooth. Not unpleasant, but neither strong nor memorable. This one is certainly drinkable, but only because it is very smooth. Not a great beer but an OK beverage."
"Mouthfeel: also like raspberry soda-water, very thin bodied, tight carbonation"
"The body is fairly light and it has a very crisp mouthfeel that would make it an exceptional summer brew. The fact that it is 3 degrees outside and we are due for 12 -20 inches of snow is not hurting it though. Lots of raspberries hit the tongue, and you are then presented with a nice wheat flavor that really balances it out. This is a pretty good fruity brew that could give you a little variety from time to time."
"Pours yellow, slightly cloudy, no aroma to speak of. Thin head that does not last, no lace. Thin berry taste, more malt than fruit. Very little hop finish, tinny aftertaste. Not very good, one was enough."
"Medium gold color, slightly pinkish and slightly cloudy. Small to no head. Aroma is raspberry at the start but fades to a little maltyness. A fairly typical and very average fruit wheat beer. Berry flavor is mild and pretty subdued, it is also a little too sweet, so it just as well the flavor is mild. Pretty average. Mouthfeel is neutral. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Not a bad little bayou beer. Had a frothy head to it and orange/yellowish color to it. I like Dixie beer, so I thought I would give it a shot. Wasn't disappointed. I was happy with my six of it and couldn't keep my buds from stealing it! Now I have to go get another six! This time I'm gonna hide it. Anyways, it went down smooth and had a semi-dry finish to it. You can definately smell the raspberry in it, but the fruity taste is a little more faint. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed ya'll!"
"it ain't purple, but it sure is hazy...a hazy orangeish color with no head and lace. slight grain and big raspberry aroma. crisp grainy tastes, followed by tart raspberries, sort of artificial. finishes crisp and grainy. i can see where this would be mighty refreshing in the middle of a brutally muggy and hot louisiana summer, but for a beer to enjoy and savor, it's bad. too much like a malternative."
" I like the good mix of raspberry and wheat !"
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is sweet malts with notes of raspberry. Taste is light and crisp with tart raspberry flavors and a dry finish. A nice fruit beer."
"Hazy gold appearance with a slight rasberry aroma. Very thin in body with a dry finish. I really thought this beer was horrible, maybe I got a bad batch but certainly would not pay money again for this."
"dry."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a decent creamy white head that sinks a little too quickly.  The nose has some slight yeast qualities to it but is mostly a sweet raspberry aroma.  Decent crisp wheat tastes start off this brew before it goes to a sticky, syrupy raspberry taste that is too overpowering.  The brew is a bit thin for being unfiltered but is fairly refreshing and fairly drinkable.  I would drink this again if offered from someone else but I won't be purchasing it again.  Not a bad brew but it is too much sweet raspberry and not enough wheat beer."
"This beer was an almost pinkish orange color with a small white head that didn't hold and left little lace.  It had a light aroma of grain and raspberry.  The flavor was lightly of raspberry and a bit tart.  The finish was light with a bit of the tartness.  A fairly weak beer for this style, but okay for a summer session brew I suppose."
"You may remember the good times from N'awlin's, but that's about all this beer has going for it! I really don't understand it's popularity. Not much aroma but it has a nice malt base, a slight raspberry flavor. The fruit also gives it a gentle tartness which works pretty well. But overall, it seems kind of flabby - not out of balance in any way, just unexceptional in character. One more thing; I need to dispel the myth that this is a woman's beer. It's a fact guys - a sad and sorry fact - that more men drink this than women!"
"Cloudy orange brown color with lots of suspended sediment, quite large rocky head when poured, settles to a thin layer with moderate lace.  The raspberries are quite prominent in the aroma, also has the distinct grain notes of wheat beer.  Flavor is quite crisp and tart, begins with malt flavor, then tart raspberries, with slight hops towards the finish.  Very refreshing, a good choice for summer in the warmer climes."
"Notes: Simple and pleasant, no cloying sweetness or artificial fruit flavour. A great pick out of the numerous American brewed fruit beers."
"Take Abita Amber and give it just enough raspberry flavor to be noticeable and you've got Purple Haze. Kind of odd, actually. Amber is preferable."
"Passed on this beer a number of times because the name sounded too much like one of those cursed ""malternative"" beverages.  According to the label, raspberry puree is added ""after filtering," so I'm not sure if the raspberry is a brewing element or a flavoring adjunct.  Lots of yeasty sediment which decanted in spite of a careful pour, and flakes swirled around in my glass like a mineature blizzard.  Up front the flavor was a pretty typical wheat, reserved but reasonably crisp.  The raspberry was not at all prominent, and I got very little in the flavor, mostly showing up as a post-swallow aromatic.  Overall, nothing bad about this beer, but not terribly impressive, either.  Might be better on a hot day sitting in the shade (but what beer isn't?)."
"A decent, very light, fruit flavored brew."
