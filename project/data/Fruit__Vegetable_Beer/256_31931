I have been to Lost Coast Brewery and it was a great experience. However Tangerine Wheat was anything but great. I hope it was an old bottle or my glass was used to clean a toilet. It was very very orangey but after about a second I had to force a swallow and drain pour the rest. I'll try it one more time and see, but as of this review. Avoid!","Beer21","Jan 07, 2015"

A near headache inducing experience after one beer. I once bought a sixer several years ago when it first hit the scene. I couldn't get through two before I gave the rest of the sixer away. I swore I'd never try this beer again, but once I began to review beers I knew I'd have to give it one more round before putting it to rest forever. It's a shame, this could be a great beer if it were toned down and given considerably better balance. As it is, it's awful.","TheSixthRing","Mar 24, 2013"

However, evaluating the beer for what it is (fruit beer) I think it hit its mark quite well. This beer is well crafted and is defiinatley an above average fruit beer. The beer needed a thicker head with more lacing on the glass and lacked complexity to be considered a nop notch beer. This beer would be an excellant picnic beer or hot wheater beer. It would also be an excellant entry level beer for someone new to craft beer. Overall I enjoyed the beer. It is definatley interesting and worth checking out.","halfgermanhalfirish","Sep 14, 2012"

The first few sips were ok, but the more I drank through my pint, the more and more it started to taste like Tang. The Tangerine is way too strong in this beer without any other flavors to complement it. It honestly didn't taste like a wheat beer, let alone a beer at all.

Delivers what it promises in the taste, bready wheat malts, tangerine and more tangerine, from the pulp to the peel, mild pithy bitterness in the finish. Light-medium body, a bit chewy, and moderately refreshing. No surprises here. Not too bad overall.","Rifugium","Jul 15, 2012"

Tastes of light tangerine, wheat, slight yeast character, floral notes, an underlying dry hop character is quite refreshing as well. Tangerine lingers on the palate in the aftertaste. Light body with some fizzy carbonation. Much better than expected. Refreshing and balanced for a fruit focused beer. It doesn't go over the top in it's tangerine direction.","JRed","May 16, 2011"
3.08,-9.4,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Saw this at By The Bottle in Vancouver and said ""summer is upon us, time for wheat beers"" cracked it open after work today and so far, I am pleased. It pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with some visible carbonation. Head is about 1/2 inch tall in my imperial pint glass and it fades quickly, eventually it recedes to a ring around my glass and a slight bit of film over the top of my beer. When I smell it the first thing I get I tangerines, sort of an orange candy sort of smell. As I taste it I first catch the wheat, but the tangerine taste takes over quickly. In general I would describe the taste as being similar to an orange creamsicle. The tangerine taste lingers for a bit, but I wouldn't call it much of an ""aftertaste"". Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but I think that gives it a refreshing feel. Overall, this beer is okay on a summer day, and if creamsicles are your thing, then this is right up your alley.","gkunkle","May 09, 2011"

4.11,20.9,3,4.5,4,2.5,5,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, this beer pours with a smell like you are actually peeling a tangerine. I'm impressed so far. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold color with a thick, foamy, dense white head. Picture perfect for a Wheat. As I said before, it smells like an actual peeled tangerine. When you get your nose deep in there you get some effervescent versions of the citrus smells, and the constant flow of bubbles also shows a high level of carbonation. In mouth that carbonation makes the beer a bit sharp, but the flavors are made to be crisp and light. Full flavors of light malt, oat/cereal, and a surprisingly light citrus highlight. With the nose of this beer, I was almost expecting a mouthful of Orange Crush, but the citrus aspect was a nice balance rather than an overpowering ogre. The beer stays light and crisp throughout drinking, with a minimal citrus aftertaste on an extremely quick finish. This beer is super-easy to drink by the bucket, and on a hot day I would absolutely fill a cooler with this brew.","GarthDanielson","Feb 23, 2011"

Nothing impressive, but what it's lacking in appearances, it certainly makes up for in nose. This was probably one of my favorite beers to smell if only because it was pure sweet, freshly-peeled clementine and tangerines - a nicely sweetened orange citrus juice with plenty of sugar and zero bitterness; I almost want to say it reminded me of some sort of cleaning agent, minus the hospital smell. Had I not been at an event for beer tasting, there is no way I would have known this was a beer purely by smell, as the alcohol was nonexistent in the nose. Even in the taste, it was like an off-kilter orange soda. Sipping it made me think of sucking on a clementine splashed with tangerine. The mouthfeel was medium with quite light carbonation that kept it from being fizzy. It ended nice and clean and very fresh - a summery, fruity drink by all measures.","Lucklys","Nov 01, 2010"

The smell is pure, fresh tangerine rind and orange candy. The flavor is incredibly fruity like a shandy or radler, half pale wheat beer and half diet orange soda/tangerine juice. Light bodied and creamy. I guess the drinkability depends on how much you like fruit flavor in your beer, it's a little much for my liking.","biggred1","Jul 02, 2009"

This is a better orange beer because the carbonation level is on the lower level and they don't knock you over the head with the Tangerine taste. It pours a kinda cloudy peachy dark gold colour with little head.The beer itself is a pretty good wheat with the tangerine showing up in the midbody and the finish.I added a lime slice and it helped the acid on the mouthfeel and then I added half a Whistler Wheat to added a more Hefe flavour. I ended getting a real nice summer beer but really the intial product is just OK","canucklehead","May 28, 2009"

First, it is sharp and sour tasting with the overcarbonation. Also, the fruit taste, the ""tangerine", feels like I'm drinking a flavored Diet Soda - just a little fake. The beer passes somewhat smooth and finishes clean, but it is rather pointedly tasty and not for the better. I don't see myself drinking this again.","clayrock81","Apr 30, 2009"

3.97,16.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Lost Coast Tangerine is a hazy and sparkling ale that lingers between light amber and deep gold, with a hue leaning toward peach. It has a small white head that fades to a film and stays put to leave nice lacing on the glass. It has a bright tangerine aroma, with a note of lemongrass. It is medium bodied, quite bubbly and extremely smooth. The finish is clean. Tangerine is quite prominent in the taste. It is moderately bitter and well balanced. It is a nice, sound, refreshing and satisfying wheat ale serving as a backdrop for tangerine. There is a clean, short, tangerine peel finish. What a great idea. Rather than just trying to emulate citrus with hops, they just went for it.","yesyouam","0"

It didn't seem like many fruit flavored beers that taste like beer with some fruit extract dumped into it after the fact, was a well blended combination and a pleasant suprise.

Taste like you would guess, a wheat beer with tangerine flavoring. I do have to say I dont mind an orange slice in a hefe every now and then and this was similar to that, just similar though. Mouthfeel was light and crisp due to the high carbonation. Overall I cant say this was terrible, but I probabyl wont seek it out again.

It only went away towards the bottem of the glass. The smell was of tangerine extract, definitely not fresh tangerine, and it completely masked any scent of beer. The taste was another step away from beer, as it tasted entirely like tang. The carbonation helped this out a bit and made it seem a little more like soda, but nothing could make this actually seem like a beer after such an intense fruit smell and taste. It may be easily quaffable if you aren't looking for beer to drink, but for me, I like my beer to taste a little like beer.","dbalsock","Nov 19, 2006"
