"O: absolute delight! May replace moon man as my favorite brew from NG. Wonderful brew and must have"
""
""
""
""

"One of my favorite fruit beers easily.  Just unreal strawberry goodness!"
"The fruit is all there. You must like strawberry/rhubarb to enjoy this beer though."
""
"I love natural fruit, non-acidic styles and this takes the cake."
""
""
""
"I usually love NG fruit beers but this one didn't do it for me."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky amber red with a frothy head.  Smells like pungent fresh strawberries and berry preserves with a touch of rhubarb tang on the end.  Doesnt smell artificial in any way, just packed with freshh berry.  Taste pretty much follows thebnose here.  Again hust bursting with strawberry preserves, although I wish it had slightly more tartness from the rhubarb, it is incredibly well balanced.  Moderate carbonation, light body, and creamy.  Nrw glarus just nails fruit beers and this is no exception."

"O - a very good fruit beer. If sweetness is your thing, NG is one of the better makers of these types of beer."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall: massively drinkable and tasty, I've never had a strawberry beer that was this successful.  Wonderful stuff."
""
""

"Beautiful, deep reddish brown color with a medium sized head that retains well. Smells of freshly squeezed strawberries, honey, sweet cream and tart fruits. Tastes of sweet strawberries, tart fruit comes through at the back of the palate and it balances out the sweetness well. Pretty rich and full bodied for such a low alcohol brew, but it works well. Just a damn good beer overall. Sweetness is matched by the tartness of the rhubarb and the light alcohol is matched by a full, creamy body with a crisp finish. Probably my favorite beer."
"Too fruity and tasted more like champagne"
""
""
""

""

"I thought this beer was pretty good."

"O: Wow, another fantastic fruit beer by New Glarus. I don't even like rhubarb and I'm not particularly a fan of strawberries for that matter. But the combination is stellar. Smooth, refreshing mouthfeel leads to great drinkability. Great balance of tart and sweet only makes it drink even better. Top, top, TOP tier fruit beer. The only competition I've ever had is other NG fruit beers (big surprise, I'm sure). Obviously I can't give it top marks for complexity or something like that but it is a perfect example of the style."
""
""
"Aroma if strawberry jam, candy sugar, jolly rancher. Taste jammy sweet strawberries, slight tartness.  A little too sweet for my taste."
""
""
""
"Really didn't know what to expect in this. My first try of any NG beers. Visually not super appealing with the murky brown tinted red color. Great smell on this, fresh strawberry and red fruit. Taste was fine, I would've been more on board if it had some tartness going on. Rather it left me thinking strawberry jam."

"750 mL bottle from Wed., 12/31/2014 (Niciu 3rd Annual NYE Party) purchased at the brewery on Fall 2013 vacation, unknown brewing/packaging dates (2014 vintage), poured into plastic cup, drank over ~30 minutes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another winner from New Glarus. Follow the advice on the bottle and drink a bit colder than cellar temp. IMO it would creep closer to 5s if the rhubarb & its acidity were closer to the intensity of the strawberry though still fantastic and no complaints as is"
""
"O- a fruit beer that is true to it's description, it's pretty sweet and best shared, but a nice switch up from the usually mundane world of fruit beers"

"My favorite of the New Glarus fruit beers. It also helps that I love the tart sweet taste of rhubarb..."
""
""
""

"Yep. Strawberry & rhubard... its there. Yum. Just a bit on the sweet side for me, but still another awesome New Glarus beer."

"I wish I had more words to say besides strawberry but that describes it very well. Once again, New Glarus captures a fruit flavor better than anyone else."
"Very good and authentic, but a little more cloying and not as drinkable as their other fruit 750s. A small pour of this one is best I think. Still probably the best (only?) straight-up, non-sour strawberry ale around."
""
"Overall: another killer fruit beer from new glarus. This one works out well with both the tartness and rhubarb to balance out the super sweet strawberry candy like flavors."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. It falls in line with all the other New Glarus fruit offerings, plenty of fruit and sticky sugars. Yet somehow balanced and not too over the top. I could never see myself drinking more than a half glass of this but it certainly is my wife's jam and she can rock this back like its nothing."

"Brownish purple in color. Fruity, sour, kind of soapy smell. Nice sweet taste. Tartness from the strawberries, but still sweet. This is good, but the cherry one us better."

"I'd like this a lot more if I could glean something other than strawberry from uncapping to finish.  It's just a strawberry sugar bomb that's not unpleasant, just not suited for 750ml quantities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is a murky copper with some ruby edges and a tight tan head. Nose is earthy up front, root notes, strong strawberry fruit rollup comes in behind.  Taste is more clean strawberry jam with a faint earthiness to balance.  Really soft body and fairly assertive carbonation with a semi dry finish.  A hint if tartness in back as the bright strawberry jam lingers."

"Fairly clear medium brown with a gray tinge from the rhubarb, it's not a pretty beer. Strawberry dominates the aroma, but the rhubarb is the star in the flavor, adding a tangy tartness. Fairly good balance reminiscent of the pie. Definitely a dessert beer, a bit of a guilty pleasure."
""
"Overall, great freaking beer, but a little sweet for my taste."
""
""
""

"Poured into a wine glass, a murky brown with little to no head. This kind of looks gross. The smell is AMAZING though. The smell is straight up Strawberry Preserves. Go to the store, pick up a jar of Smuckers Strawberry preserves, open and inhale and that's what this beer smells like. Taste perfectly mirrors the smell. Not getting much of the rhubarb, but I really don't care. The only complaint I guess is that the sweetness starts to naw at you after about 4 ounces. It's like getting too much of a good thing. In small doses, this is amazing."

"New Glarus Strawberry Rhubarb ---4.5/5"

"Incredible sour that taste just like the name says."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The outpouring of strawberries in New Glarus' Strawberry Rhubarb is by far one of the best examples of a strawberry beer actually tasting like fresh fruit, not artificial flavoring, which is stellar. When it comes down to the brass tacks though, Strawberry Rhubarb, as fantastic as it is, still doesn't measure up to New Glarus' other award-winning fruit beers. I'll still opt for a Serendipity!"

"This is a strawberry rhubarb sweet and sour beer. There is strong carbonation that can be compared to sparkling champagne. You can't see through the amber brown color. It smells like a sweet bruised apple. This is a good beer to introduce people to craft beer and it is also one that experienced beer connoisseurs can enjoy."

"O: Really quite enjoyable – a great dessert beer with tartness and sweetness in balance. Not so much funk, not a sour bomb, and not the most complex beer ever. But really quite enjoyable. I don't know how they pull these fruit beers off, but New Glarus is quite good at them. Recommended for sure. Just don't look at it first."
""
"Pours earthy brown, murky, touch of white foam on top. Strong fruity smell very strawberry. Bursts forth. Rich fruit taste, some tart but evolves into a sweeter fruit. Full mouthfeel, really flavorful. Another winner."
""
""
"O - This is a very tasty brew and very enjoyable. I paired it with my mom's homemade strawberry and rhubarb pie. Awesome pairing!"

"O - Overall, I am somewhat new to this style but the naturalness of the flavors really caught me by surprise. This was refreshing and definitely a treat. Will be looking for more fruit beers from NG in the future"
""
""
""
"I would consider this more of a dessert beer, but I could see enjoying this on any hot summer night - whether I've had dessert or not. New Glarus does such an excellent job with their fruit beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sticky sweet, overripe strawberry nose. Color is a dirty red. Luscious, huge berries that are very sweet, a touch of rhubarb tartness. This is definitely on the sweeter, fruity side than tart and astringent. This is pretty straightforward, but it's wonderfully light and refreshing. Perfect summer sipper."
""
"Verdict: Absolutely delicious fruit beer from New Glarus and in my mind, the pinnacle of their fruit program. Wonderful tart rhubarb flavor, nice complimenting strawberry flavor, just the amount of each I'd like, rhubarb in focus, my favorite fruit (yes it's a root, but I like it more than any other fruit)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a light murky brown/reddish color ale with a sizeable foamy head with OK retention and no lacing. Aroma of tart rhubarb notes with some lightly sweet raspberry notes. Taste is a lot more tart than I had expected with rhubarb notes being more dominant than the strawberry notes. Taste is more tart than the sweeter side associated with some of the New Glarus beers. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. I enjoyed this beer quite lot but this is definitely more complex and bit less drinkable than I was expecting."

"O: I like strawberry, so this was a win for me. Would have loved a bit more balance from a tart rhubarb character but I'm nit-picking really. Awesome stuff."
""
""
""
""
"o - had this beer back to back with westbrook's rhubarb remix. i love new glarus and this beer hit me just like their others. an absolutely delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wish more of the tart rhubarb was present and less of the cloyingly sweet strawberry. As sweet as this was it’s not as sweet as Serendipity. Good but not great. I’ll cellar my other bottle for a few years and see if it even out. Thanks again for this bottle, Matt!"
""
""

"It is another well-made fruit beer from this brewery! It tastes like the fruits that it is brewed with. Nice sweettart character."

"Pours the murkiest light grey brown color with a hint of head on top. Huge aromas of juicy sweet strawberries and a hint of earthy and tartness. Hops yeah maybe. The flavor is rich and sweet with lots of sugary sweet strawberries with just a hint of earthy tartness to not make it cloying. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet just short of syrupy mouthfeel. Another great fruit beer from New Glarus. Cast from the same mold as the other beers with a different fruit and the same wonderful results."
"Poured a clearish rusty-red color with a fizzy off-white head that nearly completely disappeared, some tiny carbonation bubbles blipping from the bottom of the glass; no real lacing to speak of. Wafts of strawberry from the glass before I even held it to my nose. Unlike other NG fruit beers I've had, this one came off really strong and really artificial, like those little strawberry hard candies. The taste was similar, very sweet, loads of strawberry, with any rhubarb tartness being incidental and/or overwhelmed by the candy sweetness of the strawberry. Artificial and nearly medicinal, yet still strangely alluring. Body was medium, mouthfeel was syrupy and cloying. I didn't hate this, it had its charm, but it was just way to one-sided, sweet, fake-tasting for me to want more than a sample at a time."

"i love all of the new glarus fruit beers, and this one is awesome too. its sweet, but its supposed to be, more strawberry than rhubarb in both nose and taste. hazy wit beer color with a good inch of white head. a little tartness but a lot of jammy sweetness from the berries and rhubarb. a simple wheat malt base lets the fruit shine strong in this. i love the aftertaste the most, where the tartness of the rhubarb comes back to fight the sugar, a very cool sensation on the tongue. prickly carbonation and a lighter medium body keeps this drinking easy, but its not a bottle i want to tackle alone, it is far better shared. very authentic use of fruit, something of a special occasion beer, but one of the better uses of strawberries in beer out there. all of the new glarus fruit beers are killer, and i am thankful for the opportunity to try this special one as well. i had hoped for more prominent rhubarb, but it still works very well with a low dose of it."

"Pours an unassuming murky reddish brown with one to two fingers of dense and fluffy head that settles nicely.back into itself. Absolutely amazing nose. Incredibly intense strawberry character that borders on fresh jam. Ephemeral berry sweetness and light tartness with a touch of earthy notes. Very light berry sweetness in the flavor with a bit more acidity than the nose lets on. Light bodied and tart with a dry finish."
"Reddish orange with highlights of ruby, Strawberry Rhubarb leaves a thin, white head that provides plenty of sticky lace. The expectant aromas of strawberry and rhubarb are joined by a cascade of other notes like brown sugar, wild yeast funk, and earthiness. Overall, the aromas create a delectable pie-filling like wonderment for the senses. The strawberry flavors open on the palate and are quickly met with less pronounced notes of rhubarb tanginess that helps to cut the sweetness of the strawberries. Lurking under the main flavors, a slight aceticness creates hints of sourness that blend wonderfully with the overall impression of homemade pie. Creamy and lightly carbonated, this medium bodied ale proves that Dan and Deb are truly the king and queen of fruit beer."

"O= This is an awesome beer. The looks are pretty nasty but the flavor is awesome. Check it out fo sho."
""
""
"I am glad I got to try this, but give me the nice, tart bite and general funkiness of a good Belgian fruit lambic over this any day. Maybe some age would help lessen the strawberry taste and let some of the tart shine through more."

"Bottle shared with Dad for the holidays. Pours a slightly murky brown with some red hues and a brownish off white head. Smell is big time fresh strawberries and some tart rhubarb. Flavor follows with up front sweet strawberry followed by a tinge of malts and a tad of sour rhubarb to finish. Light mouthfeel with high carbonation makes this super easy to put down the gullet. I was worries I wouldn't like this as other strawberry drinks have not been up my alley. But as usual New Glarus hit it on the nose with another fruit beer. Very nicely done. This was a hit all around."
"O: Just not my cup of tea. The Serendipity is my fave of the series, this is by far the sweetest and least drinkable. Almost a caricature of a beer"
""
"Where the Rapberry Tart, Belgian Red and Apple Ale are obvious leaders in their class, they strike me as being overly fruit (if ever so slightly). But this Strawberry Rhubarb may be the best fruit beer to have ever grazed my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am a fan of fruit beers and this is exceptional and should be other fruit beer fans Holy Grail."
""
"O - Actually tastes like strawberry. Earthy, dirty and not overly sweet. Nice."
""
""
""
"The body is medium to full with a bit of a cola-like mouth-feel. Overall I like this. I generally prefer fruit beers that are a bit more tart, but this is not too sweet and the flavor is genuine."
""
""
"Overall: One of the best beers I've ever had. New Glarus fruit beers are perfect."
""
""
""
""
"New Glarus makes great fruit beers. Everyone knows that. This is great, even for their high standards. I've had pies with less flavor."
"It's a New Glarus fruit beer. Do yourself a favor and buy all of it and send it to me."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Lighter side of medium. High carb."
""
""
""
"Overall, another marvelous fruit beer from New Glarus. I don't think this one is as good as Raspberry Tart or Wisconsin Belgian Red. The flavor is milder than those other two beers, but it's still highly enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another home-run by New Glarus! I don't think they can do anything wrong with fruit and this beer is up there with the best. Try this if you can!"
""
""
""
""
"I am not the biggest strawberry/rhubarb fan, but this is an astonishing beer. I think they have done the best of the rhubarb beer attempts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to jdiddy for breaking this one out. Pours the color and clarity of unpasteurized cider with a loose, cream-colored head that dissipates into an oily slick. Nose is reminiscent of strawberry preserves. Taste consistent with nose; however, the rhubarb cuts the sweetness and keeps the flavor profile from being too cloying. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a light, even carbonation and a slight acidity. Overall, another awesome fruit beer from NG. It's amazing how much flavor is packed into such a low abv brew."
"This is another soon-to-be legendary fruit creation from the masters of the style! Way to go New Glarus!"

"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and strawberry pie aromas. Taste is much the same with strawberry and rhubarb pie flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite sweet but tasty and easy to drink."

"There is plenty of carb in this bottle. Really makes the presentation impressive with the foamy white head. The body has a cloudy light brown color like cooked rhubarb. The smell is tart strawberry. Really inviting. The taste delivers the strawberry flavor like no other beer I've had. The beer finishes with a light tartness that does give the tang of rhubarb. This is like a clean, crisp version of strawberry rhubarb pie. Really delicious fruit beer and easily the best strawberry flavor I've had."

"O: Yet another successful fruit beer from NG. Easy drinking, fun, and fresh. Not overly complex, but the beer manages to taste just like the name says without any artificial quality to it in the least."
""
""
""
"Thanks to Atoneworks. Pours a murky brown with red highlights and a thick fluffy white head that fades quickly. OK lacing. Smells like a slice of warm Strawberry Rhubarb pie, it's safe to say that I've never smelled a beer like this! The taste is tart with lots of strawberries. It finishes with a sour aftertaste that lingers, very refreshing. I've never sampled a Flemish Red, but this is how I imagine it would taste. It's got a lot of flavor for such a light body. Crisp carbonation. Overall, an extremely well crafted fruit (if rhubarb is considered a fruit) beer that makes a perfect aperitif or accompaniment to a salad on a warm summer, or early fall, evening."

"O - Might be my favorite new Tart from New Glarus Brewing... Strawberries are almost always a gimmick or failure, but in this beer they actually work. Haven't had a bad fruit/tart beer from New Glarus yet. World class indeed."

""
""
""
"Overall, a fantastic fruit beer. I can't say it's my favorite out of the incredibly broadly-defined style, but it's certainly up there. They manage to make the fruit the focal point of the beer without creating something cloying and overly-sweet. Rather than making it mouth-puckeringly sour with bacteria, they've tapped into the natural tartness of strawberry and rhubarb, to excellent results."
""
""
""
"overall impressive nose..maybe the best of any beer. recommended"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great fruit beer; just love the way this one tickles the tastebuds"
"Pours a burnt orange color with a slight haze. A prominent beige head with a bit of stickiness. Aromas of jammy strawberries are strongest. A little of that distinct rhubarb aroma if you look for it. Taste is fruity for sure. Strawberry (fruity, a bit seedy and fresh) with a bit of astringent sour rhubarb noted too. Light bodied with medium to slightly high carbonation. A bit of tartness to balance the upfront sweetness. Overall a refreshing easy to drink tasty beer. Yet to have anything but a super fruit beer from New Glarus. Good dessert beer/strawberry rhubarb torte-like"

"O: As with all New Glarus fruit beers this one is dangerously drinkable as it borders on a nice fruity juice. Nice balance of fruitiness and sweetness. Extremely fresh and juicy. Would enjoy again."
""
""

"I know a 5'er when I smell/taste one. Honestly I can't think of how this beer could be much better. I'd like to see it funked up a little but I suppose that would be a different beer entirely. Phenomenal ugly beer."

"Hopleaf tulip. An odd looking beer - dark garnet, extremely cloudy. New Glarus are the undisputed (not open to debate) champions of the fruit beer style and its really exciting to see the line of 750's expand in the past year or so. Strawberry is an ingredient I have rarely seen translate well in a beer, until now. This is bursting with fruit flavor - a little tartness from the berry and a little sweetness from the rhubarb. This is an instant-classic and an incredible summer beer."
""
"O: Really good beer. Fantastic actually. Like I said earlier it tastes A LOT like strawberry yogurt. The only problem I have with New Glarus's fruit beers (and most of their regular beers) is that they ABV is so damn low. If I wanted a soda I would drink a Pepsi."
"PHENOMENAL; TRY SOME!"
""
""
"O-One of the best fruit beers out there. Had alongside Serendipity and Raspberry Tart. Not as good as Serendipity though."
""
"Taste is great, sweet and tart strawberries are upfront wild an earthy tart vegetable rhubarb flavor. Some straw like malt adds some complexity in the finish and there is a pleasant residual sweetness and tartness."
""
""
""
""

"This is another good fruit beer from New Glarus but it seems the flavors are a little muddled. This opinion is based on their other fruit beers, which are near perfect for that style, so with that said Strawberry Rhubarb is still one of the better fruit beers out there but my least favorite of the New Glarus bunch."
"Thanks to the gentlemen from the Midwest for the hookup of NG goodness."

"The rhubarb comes into play in at least one way, and possibly two ways. Rhubarb is tart, so it is probably contributing to the beer's sour profile, but it is a sour ale, so it is hard to tease out the rhubarb's contribution. However, it lends a tannic finish to the beer that causes the insides of my cheeks and tongue to pucker a bit, which makes me want to have another sip. For me, this means that mouthfeel is integrated into the beers profile in a positive way. If you don't mind sweet with your sour (and I don'!), you'll find this beer delicious and quite drinkable."
""
""
"The beer appears mildly hazy and a grapefruit pinkish color. The aroma is classic New Glarus. Sweet and fresh fruit abounds. Teeming with strawberry and rhubarb, akin to a homemade pie. Just delicious. Quite possibly the best beer I have had from this brewery. As with other beers of this ilk, I prefer to enjoy in small quantities, as the sweetness can become cloying. Overall, this was fantastic."

"another winner from new glarus. if you are not a fruity beer person stay away from this beer but for everyone else this is wonderfull nice balance between the sweetness of strawberry and just the right amount of tartness from the rhubarb. I would buy this beer all the time if i could but unfourtently i live in north central minnesota which is about a two hour drive from where i can buy new glarus but if you are ever in wisconson defintly pick this one up."

"If this had more tartness, I don't know if I couldn't have given it an even better rating."

"Dan Carey is just a master of fruit beers. They've come out with two new high-production ones (this and Serendipity) in the last year or so, and both have been amazing. Really delicious, and really impressive."
""

""

"O) This was a pleasure to drink. The flavors really played off of each other with near perfection. I know I'm in the minority here, but I enjoyed this even more than Serendipity..."
"O) Well, i am not trying to knock this beer. Not Dan's best fruit beer or ""sour"" I don't know if any Brett was used tasted like it. Overall, try it I enjoy Serendipity more than this one."
""
""
"This phrase is usually a curse, but here I use it with admiration: perfectly balanced. I don't know how New Glarus makes these magical potions without veering into cloying or nauseating, but I hope they never stop. Excellent, & gets damn near to elite status."

"Appearance is somewhat cloudy with an orange/brownish color, minimal head, and some lace. The aroma starts with bright and fruity strawberry with notes of tart rhubarb and mild oak. The strawberry is very nicely represented here, the best strawberry aroma I have encountered in a beer. The taste is full on ripe strawberries which presents a very fresh juicy flavor. This is wrapped around a hint of rhubarb and finishes very clean. Not quite the tart bite that I've grown accustomed to with other New Glarus fruited brews, but the clean finish is very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, another amazing New Glarus fruit beer. Not sure how the Carey's do it, but they know how to incorporate fruit into beer!"

"Color is a cloudy brownish red until you hold it up to the light when a light cloudy ruby red color comes through. Aroma - Light strawberry with some caramel malt and light acidic character from the sourness. Taste - Again strawberry but not as strong as other New Glarus fruit beers. Medium malt sweetness with some sourness maybe some from the rhubarb. No noticeable hop flavor probably from aged hops. My favorite New Glarus Fruit beer by far."

"I'd probably rank this as my lowest of the big 4 fruit beers, but it's still a nice diversion and gets big points for creativity."

""
""
"O: Don't let the appearance of this beer mislead you: it's damn tasty and not quite as cloyingly sweet as Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart."
""
"So good."
"D - Amazing the strawberry/rhubarb flavor and aroma in this beer. Only complaint is it is a bit Snapple like."

"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. This beer is another definite winner from New Glarus. Nobody makes Fruit Beers as good as they do, as consistently as they do."

"O - Dan Carey is my brew-idol. He NEVER cranks out a disappointment. Seek this one out, especially if you love fruit beer/strawberries/rhubarb/pie/NG."

"The beer was poured into a snifter and appeared a cloudy brown color with a reddish tint. There was not much of a head on this beer, but there really is not supposed to be. The highlight of this beer seems to be the aroma as it smells much like homemade strawberry jam. If I could not see it, I might not know it was beer. On the initial taste, one gets an incredible amount of sweetness like strawberry jam. I am told that the tartness in the background is the rhubarb. To be honest, I do not know what a rhubarb tastes like. So in regard to the rhubarb, I am just going by the word of others. The sweetness of the strawberry fades as the tastes continues from sweetness to a more seedy berry taste. It makes me curious as to whether the aroma's impact on the initial was exaggerated. The sweetness continues into the aftertaste and is allowed to linger because of the thickness of the beer. The fruit dominates the taste in this beer. I would not say it is better than Belgian Red of Serendipity, but it is another strong effort by New Glarus."

"Overall this is a good beer. Not too sweet and easily drinkable. Right now I'm somewhere on the fence with the tartness. While it's certainly tart, I'm just not sure how like it, seemed a little bit abrasive. However this could be bias due to my cough. I look forward to trying this again."
"Overall: Another great fruit beer from New Glarus. Great strawberry fruit flavor with a good balance of sweetness and tartness."
"Overall, I put this up as an equal to Serendipity, which is above Raspberry Tart and below Belgian Red which is still king in my book. New Glarus produces probably the best non-sour fruit beers in the country so this follows in the same tradition of the others. Delicious, refreshing brew for sure. Recommend trying this at least once."
""

"Overall: Of course I had high expectations from this brew and it did not disappoint. Like I said above, this beer feels a little off balance in the strawberry to rhubarb ratio. The fruit accents are incredibly bright and vibrant, like no other fruit beer in the business."
""
"O: An amazing fruit beer, surprising me as someone who isn't normally a fan."
"Pours a nice light red strawberry red. The nose on this beer is amazing! Like fresh pressed strawbeery jam, sweet and sugary. This one starts of with a nice quick tart punch from the rhubarb, fallowed by the sweet juicy strawberries. The flavors compliment eachother amazingly. Almost like drinking a strawberry fruit roll up! Has a slighly filling mouth feel, def one to share with your lady friend! Overall another fruit beer homerun from New Glarus!"
"This pours a reddish amber color with a fluffy cream colored head. There is a very strong aroma of strawberries. The taste is a sweet clash of strawberries and rhubarb. It basically reminded me of a strawberry fruit roll-up from when I was a kid only in a beer form. I don’t see this having quite the hype as Belgian Red, Raspberry Tart, or Serendipity but its still quite good."

"O - Outstanding. Frothy head retention last entirety of beer. Fruit flavors are excellent. I did hope the rhubarb brought a much higher sourness while its only mildly tart. Low ABV makes this an superb choice as a desert beer. Very refreshing. If your lucky to get your hands on one - it won't be a let down."
""
""
""
"Overall: Another masterpiece by New Glarus. This guys are doing amazing things with fruit beer. Serendipity and Strawberry Rhubarb within less than a year apart... New Glarus and company; we are going to expect even more fruit beer experiments since you nailed the last two that you brewed. I highly anticipated this fruit beer from Dan and crew...I gotta day that I am not dissapointed!"
""
""
"Overall, this may be my favorite of the New Glarus 750's. I was expecting a sugar bomb like Raspberry Tart and Belgian Red. Instead, I get a well balanced and slightly tart beer that tastes like strawberry pie. Wonderful job!"
"Tart and creamy, big strawberry flavor with acidic tartness from the rhubarb. Light and spritzy, lingering fruitiness in the aftertaste. On par with the other fruit beers they make, about as tart as Serendipity, the strawberry taste is pretty assertive."
""

""
""

"On point with Dan and crew's world reknowned fruit beers. Exceedingly we are able to cross off the list of fruits that haven't been blessed to be brewed in New Glarus, WI. Don't stop now."

"O - Another outstanding fruit beer creation by New Glarus and Dan Carey. Keep them coming!"
