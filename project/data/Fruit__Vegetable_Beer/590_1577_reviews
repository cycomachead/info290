"This beer is just packed with cherries. From reddish hue to cherry nose and tart cherry flavor. Some deep malt and wood flavors in the background."

""

"Fantastic sour.  Great cherry taste!"
"Cherry Pie in my mouth. A touch sweeter than the Raspberry Tart as the nice malted finish is a bit lost however the beer finishes clean and dry."

"This beer is a cherry bomb through and through. It is absolutely delicious. The cherry flavor, aroma, and color is very authentic and not cough syrupy like a lot of commercial cherry beers. Beer is not very sour but just tart enough in the finish to give the impression of tart cherries."
""
""
"I have never had a beer that was so singular in flavor profile that was so absolutely delicious!  This brew is a psalm to cherries from start to finish. The dark brown-reddish body, the tan/pinkish head and the blast of cherries in the nose and on the palate all scream ripe, red, juicy cherries.  It also achieved an impressive body and mouthfeel at only 4%.  Truly delicious!"

"I'm a sucker for a cherry bomb, and WBR didn't disappoint.. straight cherries all around. Comparable to Lindemans but a little less sweet and more full body. If you like a lot of cherry flavor, seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Went to New Glarus Brewery a few years ago and fell in love with this beer.  It just royally sucks that we cannot get it here in Oregon.  It is the best tasting cherry beer.  The cherry is fresh, tart yet sweet and the bubbles are amazing.  It is a beer I still talk about to this day, very worth while."

"Beautiful garnet clarity, indicative of the fruit from which it was made. Reminds me of red wine, perhaps a red zin. Smells of tart cherry, with a bit of candy sweetness. Not at all reminiscent of flavoring. It's the real deal. Flavor is as good as you could expect from a cherry beer. Tartness wins in the end, but there's a great sweetness."

"Poured into a tasting glass. A dark, ruby color with a finger of creamy looking white head. Smell is pure cherry. A malt sweetness is lurking in the background, but it's hard to detect anything behind the huge cherry presence. The taste is only cherry juice. I'm not sure this can be called beer. I could drink this in the morning with my toast. Like with the other New Glarus beers of this ilk, I'm finding the 4 or so ounces I consumed to be a good amount. The sweetness and one noted-ness was just getting to me by the end. Still an absolute killer offering."

"O - Much like the rest of New Glarus' fruit beer lineup; I am blown away. This might be tied with the deliciousness that is Serendipity. I am a huge sucker for cherries, and this beer is no exception. I am so glad to have finally tried this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really good beer."
""
""
"O: amazing beer. Slightly better than serendipity."
""
""
"O: Really good. An amazing fruit beer. Not something you drink often but definitely worth savoring when you do."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An incredible fruit beer that delivers on it's promise... the cherries are definitely the focus of this beer, as opposed to a beer with a faint cherry character. Very nice."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy ruby red with a thick, quickly dissipating red head. No lacing to speak of. Lots of sweet red cherries on the nose with hints of light malt. On the palate, more cherries. Finishes slightly tart. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, possibly the finest example of a fruit beer I've yet had!"

"Pours a cherry red color with an off white head. Aroma is full of fresh ripe cherries. Exactly. Amazing to just breathe this beer in. The flavor is big on the tart, delicious cherries. Doughy malts back the full on sweet cherries leaving you feeling like you just ingested the best cherry tart in liquid form. This is exceptional fruit beer. Medium bodied brew with soft to dry cherries. Overall, an American classic, made with care in small batches as long as the local cherry crops allow. Almost impossible to find outside of Wisconsin and surrounding areas."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Belgian Red is one of my favorites from New Glarus' line of Fruit Beer. This is great on a hot day or picnic, even a great dessert pairing beer. Nonetheless this beer is great definitely recommend to any lambic/fruit lover."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Very similar to the smell. The juicy cherry flavor just explodes in your mouth with each sip. Red apple, just a touch of oak spice. There's an absolute ton of cherry sweetness in here, but luckily the carbonation is on point and keeps this from getting syrupy. A definite must try if you like fruit beers. Amazing stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great beer for after a meal. Very unique and a wonderful change of pace."
""
""
"O: This is a very unique and exciting beer. I absolutely believe every beer connoisseur should try this offering. In fact, this is a beer that people who hate beer will enjoy (for instance, my wife). If it pleases the boss, that says a lot. Well done New Glarus!"

"O) A fantastic beer... New Glarus brews amazing fruit beers. Just amazing. The fact that I can go get some solar salt at Walmart, and grab a bottle of this for $8.99 almost makes tolerating Wisconsin's shitty winters worth the trouble. Almost..."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - This is a well executed fruit beer but I prefer NG's strawberry rhubarb to this. That said, it is better than the raspberry tart. All of NG's fruit beers are amazing though, so I'd drink any of them gladly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Like other New Glarus fruit beers, it is much more sweet than sour, but the sweetness is not artificial at all."
"O: Pretty nice. Sweet cherry character isn't cloying but dominates the nose and palate until the tartness shows up on the finish. A very well executed cherry beer, yet more tartness would have been awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is an exceptional brew. Again, the brewery created a fruit beer with no artificial taste. It has enough malt in the back to let you know it's a beer. Not too sweet, not too tart. A great dessert brew!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle with friends. Nice carbonation and warm cherry color. Nose is of a big red wine full of fruit. Smoooth stuff, Rich, ripe fruit but without the sugary sweetness. Lingers on and on. Don't know if this could be a regular consumption, but I'd like to try!"

"Overall- Very sweet and cherry-forward, no acidity. Most certainly the best in the fruit beer style, and one of Wisconsin's best beers that isn't an one-off (looking at you, VSB). Clearly New Glarus has the market cornered on this category."
""
""

""

""

"O: Nice beer with a ton of cherry flavor. The bottle says there is a pound of cherries in every bottle and you definitely taste it. I know its a cherry beer but was hoping for a bit of other flavor that I could not seem to find. Still a very good drink."

"Jesus, this is glorious. Still my favorite New Glarus Lambic of them all. The cherry flavor is bold and delicious, and I don't really like cherries that much...which says a lot."

"O - New Glarus' Wisconsin Belgian Red is not only one of the greatest cherry beers available anywhere, it's also one of the most quintessential fruit beers on the planet. Packed to the brim with fresh cherries, this beer smells and tastes sublime, finishing semisweet with a perfect level of tart cherry skin acidity!"
"Overall: A really great fruit beer. One of the best American takes on the style. Great taste of real fresh cherries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Cannot help but love these masterpieces from New Glarus. No other brewery I've had can bring out the fruit character more potently and perfectly. Their sweetness is always kept from going too far. These are an absolute must try."

"O: I will admit I found this bottle after it had spent at least a year in my cellar, shame on me... it was still fantastic. Now I need to find another to try it fresh, I'm sure it will be fantastic"
""
""
"O: The cherry flavor and aroma are so vibrant and fresh it isn't even funny. Perfect balance of sweet and tart. Infinitely drinkable. Maybe the best fruit beer I've had."

"Medium cherry amber color, 1"" head that slowly drops away, strips of lace. Like the best krieks, starts with straw and malt, followed by real tart/sweet cherry taste to burst in quickly and smoothly. This continues blissfully through the finish. Surprising taste for 4%, and somehow delivers the fruit without cloying. Highly recommended."

"Bottle from brewMane. Thanks! Shared with beastmaster. Pours deep opaque ruby red with cream and Reddish one finger head Huge cherry aroma omfg style. Flavor is straight up jolly rancher cherry. Then more cherry. Bit of sour and mostly sweet. Light mouthfeel with medium heavy carbonation. So obvious these are actual fruit and not some flavored syrup. Over the top cherry and very good fruit beer. Still not as amazing as Raspberry Tart."

"One of my favorites from NG, this is definitely a cherry bomb. While not mouth-puckering, this beer has just enough cherry tartness to be considered a ""sour"". Drink it out of a flute and admire it's beauty. And at 4% it is a perfect replacement for the mimosa at the breakfast/ brunch table."

"Shared this with the neighbors, and only managed about a four ounce pour. Wish I could have had more than that! It tasted like cough syrup, but in the best way possible. Like a bunch of those really good Luden's cough drops melted down in beer form. Mouthfeel was ok, but smell and taste were borderline perfection. WIll have to try this beer again (and not share next time!)"

"Cherry this and cherry that. This review sounded like a broken record. I'm sorry, but this beer was just tart cherries and nothing more. No malt, no raspberry, no hops. Just tart cherries. This was an extremely easy drinking beer. The ABV% won't sneak up on you. It was hard for me to put this beer down. I wish I could find a steady supply of this beer. Big thanks to my good BA friend Meatyard for hooking me up with this delicious beer."
"A perfectly sweet beer to have for desert. Best during the holiday times or when you happen to enjoy other's company. This brew is perfect for sharing with those who love wine to test their beer-boundaries and bring them over from the dark side with beer force. Besides the quality and enjoyment of this high gravity fruity wonder is the overall look of elegance and class with this beer's offering of a champagne style container with dripping red wax covering the neck of the bottle and capped top. And, only available in Wisconsin! My home State now!"

"Overall, a terrific American take on the Belgian Kriek style. Not quite a sour as a Belgian Kriek might be, but attribute that to the lack of a lambic base. Glad I got around to this before they ran dry in Wisconsin, but sad to here that we'll be without it this year."

"I kinda enjoyed this, but I have no idea how to rate it or what I would do with a bottle if I had one. That said, I would like another small taste to give it a fairer shake. Pours a brownish red color. Fairly cloudy. Small beige-pink head. This beer was quite sweet and tasted like concentrated cherry pie filling. Good cherry pie filling, though, and no artificial fruit flavor. That said, there’s a strong cough syrup flavor in there, too. The feel is less sticky than the taste would suggest, but it was still a bit much, at least coming to the beer without any foreknowledge. Little to no oak was evident. This is a beer that I might enjoy a lot more in specific circumstances, like as a compliment to a fancy dessert, but I can’t say that I loved it on its own. It definitely gets an entry in my list of beers to revisit."

""
""
""
""
"O: This is the definition of a fruit beer. Utterly incredible. Could drink at least one a week. Divine stuff."

"O- This was definitely an interesting beer that I enjoyed trying. Probably the fruitiest beer that I've had and extremely sweet. I enjoyed drinking it, but it was definitely a little bit too syrupy and fruity for my taste. If you like really fruity beers then I definitely recommend checking this out."

"Pours a hazy dark reddish-brown with a thin pinkish head. Smell is awesomely cherry, like a cherry pie with a great mix of both sweet and tart notes. Taste follows the nose and is really quite excellent. The cherry pie flavor is incredibly well done, and it's got a bit of tartness happening here too. The beer manages to be sweet without being overly so, and actually is rather well-balanced and drinkable, which is what separates this from most other fruit beers. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is probably the best fruit beer out there, at least that I've ever had. It's incredibly well made and is much more complex than you'd expect from a cherry beer. The only thing that keeps this beer from getting a higher score is that it's not something I'd want to drink with any sort of regularity. This makes for an excellent dessert pairing beer, but I have a hard time seeing myself just sitting around and drinking a glass while watching a football game."

"750mL red wax on numerous occassions. Pours a bright, translucent deep pink to red with a small, pink, creme head. Aroma is cherry Sucrets, cough medicine, thankfully moving to maraschino cherries and clafoutis/cherry pie. Taste is sweet, black cherries, cherry pie, rich and viscous with a major spiced note of cinnamon and nutmeg. Palate is rich, creamy, dessert like, not oily or watery. It’s not the show stopper that NG Raspberry Tart and NG Apple Ale are, but it is evident that if you like true cherry beer and aren’t in the mood for kriek, this is the ultimate non-sour cherry fruit beer. Just impossible for anyone to compete with New Glarus in the fruit beer category."
"Overall, an outstanding beer. Very fruity, nicely-balanced, and guaranteed to put a smile on your face (and a pucker on your lips). It probably won't appeal to all beer fans, but I thought it was delicious."

"It pours a dark maroon color with a slightly pink, bubbly head. The scent is rich with fermented cherries giving it a very sweet aroma. The taste is rich, sweet, and fruity with an overall great cherry flavor. It’s smooth, refreshing, delicious, and slightly tart. One of New Glarus’ signature brews that is regarded as one of the best fruit beers one the market. Definitely something you have to try."
""
""
"O: This is very good. It seems to clearly be a dessert beer, and not a drink that I'd grab out of the fridge on a regular basis. But at the right time & in the right mood, this is excellent."

""

"O: Delicious and refreshing. Tastes like real cherries, not like a lot of other fruit beers which are syrupy and overly, fakely sweet."
""
"This is one of my favorites and could easily be considered a gateway craft beer for some. Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the red was a murky maroon color with a very modest off-white head. From the top of the glass, one can detect a waxy cherry aroma that alomst brings to mind penny candies. I wonder if the wax top of the bottle affects the aroma. The initial taste brings a tall shot of tart and sour cherry, the best qualities of a cherry. The taste really grabs the attention of the sides of the tongue, making them tingle with delight. A backbone of a biscuity bread allows the cherry to shine, while still having a subtle quality. This Beligan certainly has some thickness to it, almost like a beer milkshake. Mildly fizzy, the carbonation and the thickness allow the taste to linger for several pleasant minutes. A sour cherry aftertaste continues the fun, not straying much from the initial taste. However, I find the aftertaste slightly more sour."

"O: This beer is a cherry bomb all the way. It surprised me that the cherry profile was still potent even after I sat on this bottle for 2 years; trip out."
"O: This is a really nice beer, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try it again. If you like cherries/cherry pie/cherry cheesecake, give it a whirl. It won't disappoint."
""
"Yeah, I don't remember liking this as much as I did today. My last bottle was medicinal, yet today's sample was a well-crafted example of craft brewing. Would love to grab another bottle, preferably un-waxed :)"
"arguably the best fruit beer ive ever had! it pours hazy pinkish pale red with a lovely white head on it. the nose is sour cherries, tart and a little sweet, with some funky yeast and a light malt body. my friend i shared this with took one whiff and declared, call them up and order me 50 cases. he hadnt even tasted it yet! positively wisconsin this beer says to me, with a cherry taste you cant get from washington state. over a pound per bottle it says, and i believe it. the taste is puckey from the cherries, almost like a sour beer, but this isnt one. theres also some other fruit esters in there, green apple and pears too, but this isnt fruit punch. there some bitter hops on the tail end, and a rounding cystal and pale malt body underneath it all. the carbonation is gloriously bright, while the body is just as big as it needs to be. i am in awe of this, one of the best fruit beers ever. drinkable and interesting, but unfortunately unavailable in our state of colorado for the time being. never ever pass this up if you get a chance to try it, youll be blown away."

"Pours an amber color with a 1/2 inch quick fading bubbly head that leaves some lining on the glass. Smell is full of cherries.. not much else going on. Taste is full of cherries as well. Very sweet but delicious. Mouthfeel is fully carbonated while light bodied. Overall this is delicious. Pretty cherry forward but still very delicious."
""
""
""
""
"O: Phenomenal! Honestly, after having New Glarus's offerings on Fruit beers, now sure ill be able to go drink any others. Buy it. Drink it. Enjoy it!"

"Overall:This sets the new bar for me in fruit beers. I love the depth of the cherry flavors. This one is borderline wine-like, but still has some beer flavor. The fruit seems natural and not in any way artificial. When I am back in Wisconsin next year, I will bring back several. One of my favorite beers in any style."
""
"O-amazing amount of fruitiness. Hard to believe there isnt cherry flavor added but with a pound of Cherries in every bottle I guess that is the ticket. A wonderfully unique delicious beer"

"This is a fantastic beer. I was lucky enough to get a bottle from a friend of a friend who was going to Wisconsin. Very flavorful and easy to drink. It's a dessert in a glass!"
"The beer pours a a rusty brown/ maroon with tan-red head that fades quickly without lacing. The nose is very bright with notes of cherries, plumb, cane sugar, and slush puppie. The taste is similar to the aroma--a huge cherry sweetness that sugar-coats the palate followed by a very slight tartness to keep things interesting. Honestly this beer tastes and feels like a cherry soda...not nearly as attenuated as I'd hoped. However, it's been such a long time since I've had a beer like this that it's still enjoyable... I don't foresee myself getting this beer again, but it's still a great beer to suck down on a hot summer evening!"
"Maintains all of the juicy cherry pie sweet-tartness in the flavor as well, in fact I would dare say that oak wood shows up even more around the edges in the flavor than on the nose. Just an amazing dessert beer, especially when considering how it never gets medicinal or cloying at all despite how beefy all of the fruit aspects are."

"O- I've throughly enjoyed both the Raspberry Tart and now Belgian Red from New Glarus. Fruit beers are not typically a style I enjoy, however, NG has succeeded in making a fruit ale with a nice balance of sweetness and tartness."

"Wisconsin Belgian Red pours a very nice polished ruby red, with gorgeous cherry highlights. A little more than two fingers of bone colored foam crown the beer, with minimal head head retention and lacing left behind. The nose has a huge ripe, sweet cherry skin aroma, with just a bit of earthiness behind it. The flavor is an absolute cherry bomb. It's still predominantly sweet, but there is a bit of a tart cherry edge to things as well. There's a slight malty sweetness present at the open, and the earthiness comes through in the finish. The body is on the light side, though with a little more heft than I might have expected for a 4% beer. The carbontion, while on the bubbly side, does let the sweetness mellow for a second or two before really kicking in. Wisconsin Red is, outside of one or two sours, the best fruit beer I've ever had. Fantastic all the way around."
""
"Verdict: This is a fantastic fruit beer, probably the best fruit based beer you can find other than the fruit lambics that we love so much. New Glarus has hit a home run with this and almost all their fruit beers, hell, all their beers are dynamite, but this might be the star performer of their line."

"Lighter medium body, slightly higher carbonation, smooth yet bubbly on the tongue. This is easily one of the better fruit (not sour) beers I've had in recent memory."
""
"O: Overall, good not great.  As far as fruit beers go, this one is far better than most, but in my opinion the raspberry tart is much better.  This one seems much more artificial and generically flavored than the RT, which literally tastes like you are drinking fresh raspberries.  Certainly worth a try, but I probably wont seek it out again.  "
""
""
""
"O - If you have access to this, pick a bottle up. My favorite fruit beer, period."
"D - Not quite as good as Raspberry Tart but as excellent as I'd hoped."
""
"Ruby red, with an offwhite head. Some retention and nice lacing. Nose holds loads of the beautiful Wisconsin cherries, dark fruit notes, spice and lots of jammy/pie filling characteristics. Taste of cherry pie filling, spice, pie crust and cherry jams. Dense feel, full and just an immense amount of flavour packed into this beer. Another brilliant NG fruit beer. Next to the Raspberry Tart as one of the best fruit beers (and any beer) I've ever had. Wisconsin cherries are fucking boss."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I actually quite enjoyed this beer and would drink again"
""
"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
""
"Finally got my hand on this while on a family trip to Milwaukee. 22 ounce bottle sealed in red wax, $9.99. My expectations were very high and at first, I thought they were met. However, after the third sip or so, I realized how overrated it was. Worth trying for sure, but there's great fruit beers that are much easier to find."
""
""
""
""
"O: I prefer Raspberry Tart over this (Raspberry tart is more refreshing, although less complex), but NG never disappoints. World class beer for sure."
"O: not really impressed with this, but I thought it was better than the raspberry tart even though I don't like cherry flavor too much."
""
"O - Overall this is a delicious fruit beer. Very very cherry without being cloy. I love this."
""
"D/O: To many, yeast and its metabolites are what distinguish Belgian-styled beers from those inspired by other brewing traditions. Despite being called Belgian, this fruit beer lacks any detectable Belgian yeast qualities. It, like New Glarus' other famous fruit beer Raspberry Tart, is a delivery vehicle for fruit qualities. This beer gains an advantage over its sister, projecting more honest cherry that the other was able to do for raspberries. Pair with dessert and women."
""
"M- Medium to full bodied, slightly syrupy with a low carbonation."

"Flavor is sweet candi sugar and cherries almost like a ludens cough drop. Nothing but sweet fruit and a bit of tartness on the finish. No booze, no hops anywhere. Sticky on my lips and sweet but still fairly good drinker, next time I will split the 750 though."

"Overall : I really enjoy this beer very solid fruit beer.Kind of reminds me of Blushing Monk."
"Overall: I recall liking this quite a bit when I've had it before, but this was too similar to cherry cough syrup. The Raspberry Tart blew it away."
""
"It's also gulpable due to the medium, slick body being nicely cut by the carbonation. The low alcohol content makes it sessionable (if you can get it) and is probably why it doesn't come off as a cough drop."
"Delicious brew. SImple yet refreshing and well crafted. Very nice."
"O-not an overly huge admirer of the fruit beers, but this one is pretty good. very smooth."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a Tired Hands stem/wine glass, a mostly clear, cherry red color tinted brown, with a 1-2 finger puff of pinkish-white head that receded to a wispy layer and left decorative lacing throughout the session. Aroma of cherries--naturally--and distant biscuity malts. Tasted pretty much spot on like cherry pie, black cherries, and doughy malts, good balance of tart and sweet, with the sweetness taking a slight edge and the breadiness of the malt keeping everything under control. Medium body, slightly chewy, moderate carbonation, very good overall."

"Sweet and vaguely tart, it's like a Chinotto spritzer but with pie cherry, definitely Door county in origin. Straight up cherry pie, crust and all, sweet cherry hard candy, with a soda spritzer level of carbonation. At the riverside brewery, this used to be aged in large oak foeders, not sure if that's still the case as it doesn't have much oak character at all. Mainly an apertif with cheese, or paired with a dense chocolate dessert. Not something to put down solo really, more of a crossover for wine cooler drinkers."

"Overall: Drank this beer many time, just finally reviewed it. I really love this fruit beer and the raspberry tart is just as tasty. New Glarus is known for the fruit beers for a reason! They are World Class!"
"Poured into a champagne glass. Thick cream colored foam on top of a light burgundy red beer. Slowly dissipates to a ring with nice lacing. Smell is sweet cherry reminiscent of candy. Taste is more of a sweet darker cherry. Not very complex.  Light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall a very nice cherry ale. Not overly sweet and easy to drink. I've not found anyone that doesn't like it. "

"Thanks to Crass3000 for this one!"

"Overall - It's not hard to see why this is one of the top-rated brews from New Glarus. They've most definitely hit the mark for providing the drinker with a true taste of cherries at their finest."

"Well, this is just a little embarrassing. I held on to this for a long time. Probably longer than I should have, since I got this bad boy about 8 months ago, and who knows how long it was around before then. Hoping for the best! Pours a very hazy red color with a tiny head that drop fast. The smell? Dear GOD that smells good! Cherries! There are cherries in this beer. Lots of cherries. I love cherries. This smells very good. It also tastes like there's cherries in this beer. It does a great job of balancing the sweet and the tart. The mouthfeel is crisp and light, and the drinkability is amazing. Why did I wait so long to pop this one? This is seriously a world-class beer. If you like cherries, you will like this beer. No way around that."

"D: This was basically one-dimensional, which was somewhat disappointing to me. It had a terrific natural cherry taste, but nothing else. It must be sipped, since it's so sweet. This could go well with vanilla ice cream, but it's challenging to drink a full glass by itself. Nice to try once, but I probably won't have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is unique. I very much enjoy a few sips, but the drinkability isn't terribly high as the tartness/sweet cherry flavors get overpowering by the end of the glass. Still a solid beer, just not great."
"I normally like fruit beers, but this one to me is just one dimensional and starts to taste like cough syrup to me. Not totally digging that. I enjoyed the experience, but I won't seek it out again."
"I have been wanting to try this for a while. The beer pours an interesting dark red to mahogany color with a nice cap of foam. The aroma of the beer is dominated by cherries with an air of dryness to it. Some earthy tones linger around as well. Carbonated and light on the palate. Clean cherry sings through. The sweetness is beautifully balanced by the tartness of the cherries. For such a cherry-laden brew, complexity abounds. It has wonderful depth and makes me want to keep drinking."
""
""
""
""
"O-with the carbonation in this it tastes pretty much like cherry soda, not bad but a little too sweet and fizzy for me"
""
""

""
""
"The website boasts ""Over a pound of Door County cherries in every bottle", and I believe it. Just a terrific beer. Really teh best example of a fruit beer that I have ever tasted."
""
""
""
"Medium body, slightly syrupy with some light tingly carbonation. Would have like more carbonation, to be honest, as the beer gets a little sticky on the tongue. Bits of cherry flesh in the beer as well, which is fine by me. Very easy to drink as it is a low abv beer, but packed full of flavor."
"Perhaps the best dessert beer I've come across. Massive amounts of sweet cherry up front turn to slightly sour notes on the back end. A sublimely pleasant experience - enough to please even the most hardened IPA drinker. It can be tough to work through a full bottle on your own, but don't share with more than 2-3 people, or you'll feel shorted on your share."

"Overall: VERY DRINKABLE!!! Shared with my wife, who not only loved this one, but agreed that it was hard not to pound it like a soda! We also received a bottle of Raspberry Tart from the generous trader mentioned above, but Belgian Red edged Tart out by a hair. Highly recommended--especially for anyone who ""doesn't like beer"". To adapt a cheesy line from a commercial, ""my wife doesn't usually drink beer, but when she does, she drinks Belgian Red""! (sorry, couldn't resist...)"
""
""
""
"I received this as a gift from a Wisconsin friend. The pour was beautiful, a slight head that dissipated into a thin foam of carbonation. The color was a beautiful auburn red. Gorgeous for a beer. With a fresh, not too harsh, smell of tart cherries, the beer had an inviting aroma. With the first sip it was absolutely, completely, CHERRY! There is very little hint of malt, or even hints of beer characteristics. The smooth taste of the beer itself is full of fruit. With heavy notes of cherry, dashed with punches of tart this beer is refreshing, to say the least. The hint of tart and sour lingers in the back of your mouth. Within a few sips you can almost wish there was a crust to finish your cherry pie. Great use of fruit in a beer. Definitely a beer for those that appreciate a sour beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- If I could get this beer regularly I would drink it all the time. Probably the best fruit beer that I have ever had with it being tied with Blushing Monk IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
"I received this as an extra from a very generous individual from whom I do business with regularly. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a 9oz. Cigar City snifter. This pours a cloudy, cherry red color without any semblance of a head whatsoever. The beer is plenty carbonated, but you wouldn't know it from the way it pours. The nose is loaded with cherries...in a Loudon's cough drop kind of way, minus the medicinal aspect. I know that's odd to say, but it smells really good. The nose leave's NO doubt this is a cherry based beer. The taste reminds me of the gelatinous part of a cherry pie. Seriously loaded tart cherry flavor profile. Absolutely fabulous. The mouthfeel is tart, with that lingering cherry pie aftertaste. This is just unique all around. This would be a perfect summer beer. It's light, very enjoyable, and would also complement a good meal or even dessert."
"O: A decent beer, but like their Raspberry Tart, it's so simple that I can't call it a great beer. I just want more depth and complexity than pure cherries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty brew, not one I would have often, but great when you are looking for something sweet."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Very sweet and sticky if the carbonation wasn't there it would be almost hard to drink."
"This is the fruitiest fruit beer that I've ever encountered. The smell is a little intimidating, but the flavor is excellent. Bonus points for the style. I would love to share this with a group of people that think they don't like beer. I'll be making efforts to acquire more!"
""
"O - yep it's a fruit beer. I'm glad I tried it? I will not be seeking this out again. Could not drink more than 1/2 a glass, just too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall verdict, this was a mixed bag for me due to the aroma and the flashbacks it caused. Still a good beer, but I definitely think Raspberry Tart's the better choice."
""
"Edit: Tried this again with a year on it, no longer as much carbonation but a lot of sour fruit going on. Very delicious, the way it aged made it smooth out but didn't get rid of the fruit, IMO holds up to some of the best cherry krieks. (A)"

"O: Well, if they were trying to make a beer taste like candied cherries, I'd say they nailed it. If you were expecting any tartness to the flavor, you're going to be disappointed. Remember, this is a fruit beer, not a wild ale or a lambic. That said, this is excellent."
"O - Hands down the best cherry beer I've ever tried. The aroma and mouth feel are excellent, but the taste is a bit too tart for me. Amazing stuff here!"
"Even split a few different ways, more than 8 ounces of this was starting to really get to me. In terms of drinkability, this isn't very high - it's just very sweet and the flavor profile starts to wear you down. Personally, I'd split this with as many people as possible and when not forced to drink a lot to finish the bottle, this is good."
"Like the Raspberry Tart which I'm in love with, the Wisconsin Belgian Red is tops in its class. Any doubter of fruit beers should take a look at the offerings that New Glarus is producing, which are beautiful beverages to drink. The next mission will be securing a full bottle to myself."
"This ""beer"" is so tart and fruity, it's more fermented fruit juice than it is beer. The tart and sweet are so strong that they are almost too much; I have to sip this slowly to avoid pucker face as I drink this. While I'm sure this is a really good fruit beer for those who live fruit beers, this is just a little much for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly creamy but still with a bite on the tip of the tongue. Overall, a great beer. The fruitiness is something different, but the cherries come through in a great way. The tartness finishes off each sip perfectly. Couldn't be much better."
"Better than the bottle? Very possible, though absence does make the heart grow fonder. I’m totally enamored of this beer, and actually can't fathom that there's a better representation of the style. Forever ISO this work of art."
"This one pours a medium bodied bright cherry red in color with an off white lacing around the snifter. The aromas are of sweet cherries and not much else. It's almost medicinal. It's kind of like cherry pie. The flavors too, of cherry pie. You get a light tartness with a lot of sweet cherry. It's to the point and not overly complex. It does taste ""good"" but is just so straight forward and doesn't offer a whole lot of complexity. It drinks pretty light in body but due to the sugar, is pretty sticky. Overall it is a decent beer but just so sweet. It's hard to get past the cough syrup."
"This beer's body is medium with a creamy heft and plenty of depth. Just crisp enough with a steady carbonation, this beer goes creamy smooth and heavier without getting too filling. I'd take down the crispness an almost infinitesimal degree."
"O: I'm growing to like this style more and more. You have to go in with the understanding that it's not your traditional beer made of malts and hops, but it sure is refreshing"
"I dragged this back from Wisconsin last week. It seemed like a great value, but now I'm not looking forward to finishing it. Throwing it out would be alcohol abuse."
"D - This is one of those beers that everyone likes, even if they don't like beer at all. If I could buy this locally I'd have it all the time - it's delicious, low in alcohol, and pleases even the most disparate palates. The only knock is that I like Raspberry Tart more."
" ~ Easy to drink. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, desert. This is a beer that has stood and I imagine will continue to be on the brew calendar for the folks in Southern Wisconsin. (4.5)"
"O- Not a huge fruit beer fan, other than lambics, but this is an awesome cherry beer! Wish it could have a bit more tart/sourness too it, but still a very good beer."
"I have been really trying lately to not rate beers all 5. This beer is unlike anything I have ever tried. Pours a murky red with a nice sized slightly pink head amazing lacing. Smell is nothing but cherries and cranberries. Taste is a nice tart cherry which mellows down to a great fruit taste. Mouthfeel and carbonation are wonderful. Could drink this stuff by the truckload. Overall one of the best beers I have ever tried."
"This beer is very tasty, as close as a desert beer as I would think you could get. There is really no malt characteristic to this at all, Its like you are drinking a fruit soda, that is the only downfall"
"O: A very drinkable and refreshing beer, I wish I had another one of these. I was kind of hoping this beer was going to be a little more tart and sour, since the label indicates the style is a Flanders Red. From that point of view, I'm a little disappointed. However, overall I was impressed by this beer and look forward to trying more from New Glarus."
"Make no mistake, this is an easy-to-drink, lightly sweet, pleasant drink. The light, soft carbonation keeps the sweetness from overwhelming, and this beer can almost be considered refreshing. In the end, though, I was expecting a world class beer and instead got what tasted more like a world class soda."
"It leaves a nice lacing as you go down but I feel the head can be a bit obnoxious at times. Especially towards the end because you really do savor and enjoy every sip of this beer. Fantastic."
"Sweetness hurts the drinkability a touch but not enough for me to consider leaving any in the bottle. A classy brew."
"O - Awesome brew from New Glarus. Never been to Wisconsin before but made sure I tried this before I left. Wish we could get this out East."
"O - Such an amazing beer, this completely blew me away! Thanks again, Shane!"
"The taste matches the aroma wonderful cherries sweet and real flavor. The carbonation is sweet and wispy wonderful and fills the mouth"
"Again, like Raspberry Tart, this is not a sour per-se...but simply encapsulates and elevates the fruit with subtle craft and pure (largely local) ingredients. Well done, and likewise well worth seeking out (unless you dislike cherries)."
"Solid, slightly cloudy red; not much of a head. Pie cherry aroma, hints of forest floor. Super cherry flavor, very clear and fresh. Moderate effervescence keeps this from being cloying despite a definite sweetness."
"O- its a very good beer for its style. I enjoyed it and would like to have some time again."
"O: Overall, i love this beer. Very easy to drink and pleasant taste."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with a very nice amount of carbonation. It goes down quite easily. Overall I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, though less than Raspberry Tart. Still, definitely one of the best fruit beers you can get in the States. A should try, for sure."
"O: Lots of cherry flavor from start to finish, but I am not a fan of the artificial tasting cherries in this opposed to the natural cherry flavor of a kriek."
"Overall is pretty good but maybe a touch too sweet for me."
"Overall: I was surprised with how much I enjoyed this one. I was expecting it to be way to sweet for me."
"I am super impressed. An exceptional beer. Makes me look forward to their Raspberry Tart with much more anticipation and longing."
"750 ml bottle poured into Efes tulip. Thanks Cheesemoose! Leathery brown in color, small head, low retention. Clear, sticky lacing. Aroma dominated by cherry (of course). I suppose that it would be easy to screw this flavor up but its done perfectly. Not medicinal, not cough syrup. Splendid. Taste is fascinating, unique and certainly delicious. Cherry sweetness and tartness is front stage and center and just awesome. Amazing and unique beer."
"Overall, I'd suggest you get one of these bottles immediately, and drink it. You won't be disappointed! Wow, this is a great fruit beer right here."
"O: Sweet and very fruity, but without seeming syrupy or overly sweet at all. Dry and somewhat tart without being sour. Pretty much as balanced in flavor as an actual ripe black cherry."
"Poured from a Bomber bottle into a tulip glass. The body of this beer is red with light red or pink along the outside of the glass. It leaves behind great lacing. It smells of fresh tart cherris. The taste of this beer is of tart cherries with a seetness through the whole taste. Not overly sweet so you are easily able to finish off the bottle. Overall this beer is delicious. If you are a fan of cherries you cant deny that this beer is king."
"I'm just okay on this one. It's a bit overly sweet for my tastes, and the Cherry notes are somewhat one-dimensional, especially in the nose. Tastes more like Cherry Soda than a complex Belgian-style kriek."
"Overall, this is a great tasting beverage if you love cherries. My only real problem with it is that it doesn't really remind me of beer and a 750 ml bottle can be daunting if sweet drinks overcome you fast. But, this is the best cherry flavored beer I've tried to date."
"Having had this beer after New Glarus's Cran-Bic, I feel like this is just the inversion of sweet/sour I wanted. For me, Cran-bic was maybe .75 sweet to .25 sour. Switch those two values around, and exchange the cranberry for cherry, and you get this stellar Wisconsin Belgian Red. After having loads of Belgian Kriek's, this is an awesome response from Wisconsin."
"O- This is a fantastic fruit beer, but as others have noticed, it isn't something that you'd want to drink a lot of or super regularly. It is more like a desert than a beer. Nevertheless, it is full of flavor and a wonderful beer."
"Pours a dark red color with a finger head that disapates quickly. Aroma is pungent cherries, slight medicinal notes, slight oak Taste follows the nose, lots of cherries a bit of a medicinal taste but not off putting. Crisp, tart and refreshing. Different in the beat possible way, tasting back to back with the raspberry tart and I must say I prefer the tart."
"The CPJ"
"Oh my god. Poured from bottle into goblet. Poured a cherry red with a touch of amber, almost no head. Nose is alll sweet cherry candy and vanilla, some roses mixed in there. The tongue matches well to the nose. Sweet cherries, vanilla, no sour its all sweet. I cannot stress enough how sweet this is. Mouthfeel is good, could use a bit more carbonation, but it might take away from the sweetness. Overall, awesome beer, I want more."
"O - Strong cherry, but not overly sweet. Surprised how much I liked this one."
"This is a wonderful offering. Complex flavors, body and fantastic nose. I really, really wish this was available closer to home!!"
"O: This beer is extremely good, and honestly for me is preferable to Raspberry Tart. I think both are great beers, but after having them side by side tonight I think this one is a bit more of a revelation. I think I've seen other beers go similar places to Raspberry Tart in the use of raspberries (perhaps just not as well); however, this is a first for cherries. I didn't know they could be so light and candy-like. I was really impressed how this stayed away from syrupy qualities; which is where I see this being divergent from Raspberry Tart. I wouldn't say grenadine flavors aren't in here, but most certainly the mouthfeel avoids stereotypical coating syrups. It's juicy, it's concentrated, but it's not syrup. I don't even like cherries that much to eat as a form of food, but I'll be damned if I don't drink them again sometime."
"I adore fruit beers, so my opinion may be biased. However, i liked this very cherry beer because it was not too sweet, as other fruit beers can be. However, it almost had that cough syrup thing going on, but it is not quite at that cherry level, it was just delicious. Very smelly of cherries, not too dark in color, just very red. Not too fizzy when poured either."
"O.Fantastic,light ,fruity, cherries really come thru,crisp a great early morning riser due to the low alc% gladly pay 20$ to get a bottle shipped now and then."
"I'm glad I tried both of the New Glarus fruit beers (Raspberry Tart). They seem to have a good brew crew over there capable of creating something different while still making it approachable. Both of these beers will be on my list again next year."
"-GFunk"
"Overall the best fruit beer I've ever had, hands down. It makes all others look weak by comparison."
"wow. what an impressive, well-made beer. purplish, dark, dark red with a pink head that holds for a bit. nose is cherry pie, cherry, cherry, and dark cherry with a malt backbone that comes off to me like fresh-baked pie crust with cinnamon. everything awesome about WI cherries is hiding in here, and the essence seems to be near perfectly captured. some nutty, pitty notes, and a bit of earth/dirt for good measure. incredibly clean with not a trace of artificial. taste is clean, sweet cherry pie, but tartness comes in and balances everything out. so much so that it doesn't even seem tart... or sweet. brilliant in that aspect. this is a fruit bomb, and one of the only times i think i have used that term positively. medium almost medium-full body. sweetness is almost sticky, but delivers itself cleanly. great beer from New Glarus here. a modern classic!"
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours a nearly opaque, glowing deep ruby with a bubbly, fizzy pink head. Tremendous cloudlike, chunky lacing. Aroma of Luden’s cough drops, pure dark cherries, pie crust, brown sugar, and notes of subtle, buttery yeasty dough. Medium to slightly robust bodied with a mellow, creamy, sweetly tart mouthfeel. Spacious, slow, and tangy finish. Not my favorite style but would suit any fruit beer lovers extremely well in any case!"
"O: Even better than their Raspberry Tart, the cherry flavor really sings. When it comes to this style, New Glarus really knows what it's doing."
"This was a very balanced beer. My Christmas present came early when I discovered a family member who travels to Wisconsin on a regular basis. We now have a standing order."
"very glad i got to try something out of the ordinary."
"O. Probably one of the best fruit beers I have had yet. Just a real natural fresh taste that most breweries are unable to pull off. This beer is all about the fruit, and I can't imagine a better showcase than Belgian Red. New Glarus is a top notch brewery."
"Overall this is pretty easy drinking, an immense flavor profile, unique, and so refreshing. Well done."
"Overall by far the best cherry beer i have had..Easily top 5-10 fruit beers I've had. If you can get your hands on it please give it a try."
"This is a really outstanding fruit beer from every angle. It walks a fine line between beer and wine, and it walks it very well. New Glarus has a real command of brewing fruit beers, and this is one of the shining examples of that expertise. Pairs great with a lot of foods, especially rich cheeses. Not to be missed."
"O-- Reminds me of the Thorogoods Apple beers but with the ABV toned down, drinkability higher, and obviously being cherry. Closer to sparkling apple cider in the fruitiness of this and the drinkability of it. Stunning beer for summer."
"O: One of the more complex and well-rounded fruit beers I’ve consumed. I enjoyed putting away this whole bottle."
"O- Very outstanding! Easily one of my favorite beers. The beer is so unique and so well done that I sometimes am stunned that a cherry beer could be this delicate, fresh, and such a fun drinking experience."
"Thanks to ThomasHardy for this 750ml bottle, poured into a LaChouffe tulip. The massive cherry pie aroma more than makes up for the pedestrian appearance. Just the right level of carbonation to keep the rather oily body from becoming too sticky. Multiple layers of cherry deliciousness. Light biscuity malt and light caramel sweetness bring crust to mind; you might as well be drinking cherry pie. Quite a treat on its own, and fun to blend with a nice stout as well."
"Wow! Big thanks to TATURBO for this beautiful beer. The beer was perfect for the holiday weekend! This brew pours out as a nice looking brownish red color. The smell was of fresh cherry juice and a little bit of malt. The taste was wonderful, the cherries were sweet and just a little tart on the back end. Really well done flavor. The mouthfeel was nice, smooth and dry not a lot of carbonation. Overall the I found this beer to be damn near perfect, it's leaves a great impression on me and I'm very excited to try more from this brewery."
"O - My girl LOVED this one. She was reluctant to even try it but boy did she rave. Me, I loved it as well. I am NOT a fruit beer guy but this one is just exceptional. I could drink this all summer long"
"Overall: A very nice fruit beer, like this slightly more than the raspberry. Surprisingly, not too sweet."
"D/O- I've had many a beers in my day but this remains one of the best beers I've ever had. Light and fruity, its an easy drinker although I find myself taking small sips just to savor. The epitome of ""world class""."
"This beer is a great example of a brewery reflecting their local suroundings in the beer that they brew. The appearance is ruby red, with a one finger head and good lacing. The nose is CHERRY with a little oak and almond. The flavor is great at first.... but am I alone by saying that this is Slushy sweet? I mean It's well done and maybe I should have shared the 750 ML with 8 people instead of one. It would be good in a 6 oz glass and I respect the craftsmanship but too much for me. Good Day."
"O- I thought this was well crafted, while I didn't think it was a stand-out for me, it was quite good. I prefer the raspberry tarts flavor profile, but this one had better carbonation."
"O: I normally do not like fruit beers or sweet tasting beers, but this guy really struck a chord with me. I wouldn't be able to drink it on a regular basis, but it was nice to have after a good dinner. I'm interested to see how the raspberry tart I've got in the fridge compares."
"O: This is a good, interesting beer; I am not sure I would drink a ton and as it warms it gets a touch on the medicinal side but I still like it"
"Overall, this is the epitome of a fruit beer. Well balanced, vibrant, and beautiful. I can only hope other American breweres are taking notes."
"This bottle dated back to Summer 2004, I believe. The pour was lacking any sort of discernible head. Color was a deep red with a slight cloudiness. Nose was like standing in a cherry orchard in the summer and taking a deep breath. I was transported back to the days of my late grandmother's lattice-top cherry pies or making preserves in the early fall. I had some cherry preserves from Traverse City, MI while I was stationed on Diego Garcia that were intense, but this beer ... Holy Cherry, Batman! This left no room for survivors. To say dry would be an understatement. Arid! And cherry! Breathtaking! Mind blowing! Forget other mind-altering substances and put some of this in your peace pipe and smoke it."
"O: What a ""beer"". I'm really glad I was able to try this but I'm really sad that it's not available where I live. This is a great beer on a hot day and a great beer pretty much any time. Bravo New Glarus. Bravo."
"Poured from a 1pt. 9 oz bottle. Pours with a quickly dissipating pinkish white head, that leaves behind next to nothing in terms of lacing. Beer is a pleasing, hazy brownish red color. Smell is dominated by tart cherries, with maltiness lurking in the backround. Taste is also dominated by cherries, with maltiness still lurking in the background. Mouthfeel is quite nice and tight with decent carbonation. Overall, though it's not a beer I would drink quite often, today is the hottest day in Chicago in five years, and this beer is incredibly refreshing and is really hitting the spot."
"O-this is definitely more complex and better balanced than its raspberry brother. its definitely sweet, but not overly sweet that it sticks to your mouth like many sweet beers. i could actually drink this all night. this is much more sophisticated than any other fruit beer i've had."
"I love this beer, despite it being almost more of a cherry cider than a beer. This beer is all about the cherry, although the base beer must be solid to build the cherry goliath on top of. The cherry aroma, taste, sourness, and sweetness are all there, so intense it borders on medicinal but it is NOT, it's a natural/real cherry taste that is so enjoyable and refreshing. I could guzzle this stuff by the gallon and never tire of it, can't think of a negative except maybe there are more complex beers out there. I wish they made a sour variant of this, but they should never change this beer, it is exceptional on its own and for what it is; a cherry beer."
"This bottle pours a deep red with a pink head. The smell of the cherries is really potent and nice. The taste is like cherries with a bit of candy in it. Alcohol is undectectable. I don't really like ""fruit"" beers but this is a nice take on it that you can have for dessert or share with women."
"Overall an amazing refreshing sweet yet tart fruit beer. One of the best beers I have had recently. I could drink this beer all day."
"If I had but one wish it would be that New Glarus somehow made this more sour. It would be my favorite beer in the world. God bles you, New Glarus."
"Sampled at Hellbilly’s Hellraiser courtesy of Hellbilly via Bockyhorsey!!! ""I can not tell a lie," this was like George Washington placing his right hand on the trunk and left hand on the branches of a cherry tree...and ringing it out like a towel just above my glass. INCREDIBLE!!! Pours a soft red with small rose foam. Washington cherry blossoms and freshly baked pie tease the nose. The flavor combines buttery flaky crust, sweet ripened fruit, and cherry tartness. This beer is distinguished, legendary, and should be celebrated!!!"
"Overall I wanted to like this more. It is pretty tasty, except for the slight medicinal notes, but this is something I wouldn't want too much of."
"D- I thought the Raspberry Tart was good. This is better. Amazing beer, I will be looking for this again!"
"o: most fruit beers have a tinge of fruit in the beer; but this fruit beer has a tinge of beer in the fruit. it tastes incredibly fresh and just has a ""realness"" to it. it feels like it was assembled and came together naturally--not just ""flavored"" with something new and different like so many other ""unique"" beers. A lot of great beers can't really be appreciated by people that aren't beer connoisseurs but this sweet, crisp, low-ABV, refreshing beverage could be enjoyed by anyone."
"Absolutely beautiful brew. It bears repeating: New Glarus could teach the world a lot about fruit beers. The only remaining question is: better than Raspberry Tart? That warrants a side-by-side. Good excuse to have another glass of each. Excellent."
"Just awesome all around. Every drink was delicious and I awaited the next."
"O.) - Won't find a fruit beer much better than this. Picked up a bottle of this stuff at a liquor store 5 minutes from my house. Fortunate to be in Wisconsin where it is available. A good brew for the summer months. I see myself sitting on a lawn chair in the sun and going through 2 of the wine-style bottles myself. Mild, unique and utterly delicious."
"Pours a murky cranberry juice red with a tiny 1/2 light red head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing whatsoever. Smells of fresh sweet cherries in their own juice. A very fresh and mouthwatering smell. Taste is very much like the liquid form of a cherry flavored Jolly Rancher. Very sweet yet slightly tart at the same time in a perfect balance. This is a very carbonated beer that is very crisp and clean in the mouth. Overall, an awesome fruit beer all around and probably the best cherry flavored beer I have ever had. I will seek out more of these for sure."
"First off, this should be a soda made by Jones. I can't believe something this tasty is a beer. Smell of cherries fills the air the minute you open this bomber. Tart, sour, and sweet taste of cherries is experienced throughout the drinking process. Beer may be too sweet to have more then one bomber, but when the taste wears out, you crave another sip to satisfy the sweet cherry flavor. If only I was drinking this on a beautiful summer day instead of cold ass Chicago winter."
"Overall I thought that this was an amazing example of a fruit beer. It smelled good and tasted good as well. If you are not a fan of cherries I would stay away as cherries dominate almost all aspects of the beer. Also there really are not any ""beer like"" qualities to it but if you want a good fruit beer you couldn't go wrong with this one."
"D - Really drinkable. Super bold flavors that just feel well balanced and never feel out of control. The fruit flavor is excellent in this beer. Finish is really nice, and not as palate blasting as expected."
"Overall: A nice little treat that doesn't disappoint."
"Saw this bad-boy on tap and HAD to have it as the bottle I had before was quite excellent. Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. poured red with a three finger very light pink head that subsided to one and a half very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, and slight sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, sugar, slight tart, and slight sour. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew is nothing short of excellent. Really can't believe I got the opportunity to try this one on tap. It was really just as good as out of the bottle. Everything in this one just WORKS! Nothing at all missing for the style and is likely my favorite brew of the style only compeating with Raspberry Tart. If you haven't had this brew before regardless of the serving type, you need to do so as soon as you possibly can."
"D: Really enjoyed this as a special and unique brew. Desert anyone?"
"D: This is pretty darn tasty if you're into cherries. A bit hard to finish the whole bottle, unless you really love cherries. Very good stuff. Try it, at least!"
"O: This beer is not for me, so, in keeping with my previous methods, when reviewing a beer that I would never drink again, I am rating this beer as straight 3's."
"Hail New Glarus!"
"Don't get me wrong - this is overall more likable than most Lindemans, but they're more similar than some would have you think imo."
"Incredible."
"This is pretty much the holy grail of fruit beers in America, maybe the world. Blows away any other beer w/ cherry in it, here, the cherry is so dominate, don't even think of trying this beer unless you really like cherry. Not for hophead only guy. You can't understand the cherry dominance in this (but again, the nuances of everything else make it work even better) until you try it. Next time I'm in Wisconsin, I'm getting like 10 of these. Hopefully the fruit don't fade. Fresh is definitely very good here."
"One of a kind brew here! Pours a dark ruby color, with a pinkish foam. You can smell this is bursting with cherries the minute you open the container. Its unlike any fruit beer I have ever tasted, They say theres a pound of cherries in every bottle ( 20+ oz bottle) And I don't doubt them for a moment. This beer just rushes to the palate. Its quite bubbly, but that works wonderfuly with the flavor, which is cherry, cherry, and more cherry. If i could put cherry pie in liquid form, this is what i'd come up with. Simply amazing."
"I'm slightly confused about the difference between this and sparkling cherry juice. Since it is beer, it seems like an example of some exceptional brewing skill. Some may find the medicinal character to be objectionable, but I don't."
"(750ml bottle courtesy of Alpar!). Pours hazy red juice color with minimal head. Aroma of maraschino cherries. Taste is sweet. Medium bodied with a luscious, ripe fruit finish. Man, this is a delicious beer...Thanks for sending this out Alex. Awesome stuff! This is the holy grail of fruit beers."
"It smelled like a juicy red cherry sweet-tart, with a twist of lemon and a hint of wheat. The taste was a direct continuation of the nose. Tangy candied cherries up front that leave you with a little pucker. The beer had a medium body with a medium-high (but well balanced) amount of carbonation. It felt mildly creamy, and had a somewhat acidic finish. I ended up drinking the majority of the bottle, and didn't grow tired of it through 4 smaller glasses. Was a very refreshing beer."
"9.1/10"
" Aroma is very sweet, loaded with cherries and some softer floral notes. The taste is similar, but stronger: very sweet but in a light and tart way, with a bare hint of hops at the end. Lip smacking good. Medium bodied with good carbonation, but not enough to scrub the sweetness off the palate, or it could be the temperature of the beer, which has gotten warmer. Overall a very good and unique beer."
"poured a ruby red color into a snifter. the nose was overwhelmingly cherries but with a hint of sweetness. the taste was the same but with the slightest tartness just to balance out the sweetness. the mouthfeel was silky smooth. i could have easily drunk the whole bottle but was glad to share it with some friends."
"Thanks Levi!"
"This beer pours a dark red color, there was no head at all. The smell is very sweet, strong of cherry. The taste was very carbonated, very sweet, and a strong cherry falvor, just a small bit of a malty taste is present at the end of the flavor. Very easy to drink, and drinks like a champange. Overall a really good fruit beer, different, and it will only be liked, if you like cherries."
"As much as I've gone on about how not sweet this is, it still is sweet enough that I wouldn't want more than a bottle, that being said this is phenomenal!"
"I could drink this all day. I love me some cherry beer!"
"Very drinkable for such an intense beer. Easily my favorite of the New Glarus fruit beers and one of the better examples of the style out there."
"EDIT: after having this a few times, the thing that takes it a notch below Raspberry Tart is the odd cough syrup sharp medicinal aftertaste that occasionally comes in. I don't always get it, but when I do, it takes me aback. Eliminate that, and this would be in the tip top tier."
"Rating as a fruit beer: 4/5.0/5.0/4.0/4.5"
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer but preferred the Raspberry Tart. This one was just a bit too sweet for me. I'd never be able to finish a bottle by myself. I could with the Raspberry."
"5 minutes in and I'm sick and tired of the syrupy flavor. Palate is flat and super sticky. I wanted to like this beer so bad, but in the end three of us ended up drinking a quarter of the bottle. I do believe it will make great ice cream sauce."
"D: Absolutely a digestif for a warm afternoon. Slowly sip while reading a book. Very nice."
"D - Drinkability is high. New Glarus isn't far off by describing this as the marriage between beer and wine (and maybe fruit juice). Incredibly easy to drink without having the cherries dominate. Would be a nice beer to have on special occasions but probably not something I'd seek out for everyday drinking."
"This is such an easy beer to drink. It's not easy for me to obtain and I couldn't see myself drinking it every night, and that's coming from someone who likes things on the sweet side of things. A delicious beer overall though and a great example of the style"
"The best non-sour fruit beer I have had to date- absolutely phenomenal- seek this stuff out."
"Hands down the best fruit beer that I've came across so far, living up to the hype. I really can't see anything wrong with it. It is one of my favorite styles too so I'm scoring this one very high."
"Pours a slightly hazed ruby tinted brown color, nice cap of offwhite head and good lacing. Scent is an amazingly bold rush of tart and lightly sweet cherry with a grahmn crackery malt background... thats about it and thats all it needs to be. Taste again brings the cherry... tart, lightly sour and lightly sweet... and the faint hint of grahmn crackery malt provides some balance. Medium bodied, good mid to high carbonation level, no heavy lingering after tastes. Another fantastic beer from New Glarus, im partial to raspberry so ill give that one a nod overall, but they are both the best fruit beers available."
"D: I could drink this all night. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this beer. Amazing."
"D- I thought the Raspberry Tart was good. This is better. Amazing beer, I will begin to demand it to seal the deal when making deals with guys from the midwest"
"D: A very nice sipping beer. Not an overpowering taste, but one you want to keep tasting. Gotta find more krieks!"
"Poured a nice deep reddish brown, not much head but very bubbly. Smells heavy of cherries, very good smell. Taste is just as heavy with the cherries. Nice light, tastes more like juice than beer but it's definitely a nice taste. Very flavorful and a nice change of pace, but I probably can't drink more than a glass at a time."
"Overall: As a native Wisconsinite, New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red is in nearly every grocery store. I've had it before, but this is my first time rating it. The appearance is really great, deep scarlet, almost blood red. The taste is extremely heavy on cherry, but not unpleasant. There are hints, although faint, of barley, and the smell is quite nice as well. Give it a shot for its uniqueness!"
"Drink- For something so different this was a great tasting beer to enjoy on a nice 70 degree So. Cal day while cleaning the house. Looking forward to that Raspberry tart I traded for as well now."
"Drink is surprisingly well for all the craziness of this beer. Lots of bite from the tingly feel and acidic bits, but the carbonation and sweetness balance that, and the tart plus sweet candy flavors really give your mouth a rollercoaster ride it keeps wanting to board. It's like that kid who gets beat up on teh rollercoaster, but as soon as the ride ends he wants back on. I can barely put the glass down to type a sentence before I need to take the next sip. Sessionable."
"This is a fun beer to drink and truely unique. One of the best fruit beers I've had without question."
"D: Extremely drinkable. I have no desire to share the rest of the bottle I opened with anyone. Yes I will have this beer again."
"D- Overall this beer is very tasty. It never becomes cloying, it never burns out in presenting flavors, and it is something I'd drink again. Probably one of the better fruit beers out there."
"I'm usually not the biggest fan of dessert beers but this is delicious and extremely quaffable. Much better than he Raspberry Tart."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with a nice carbonation feel. Very clean and crisp. It is very sweet, but extremely drinkable. One of the best fruit beers I have had. Wish I could get my hands on some more of this."
"OUTSTANDING!"
"If you don't like cherries, or sweet beers. . . don't even bother."
"Cherry pie in a glass, that is all!"
"D - it's pretty smooth and enjoyable, but the tartness that lingers in your mouth is again hurting this category a bit."
"Wouldn't drink more than a few oz's at a time. Too sweet to be considered a session-able beer to me."
"Fruit is not my favorite style but NG does this nicely in an unthreatening way. I wouldn't have another by myself but would share one with some wine loving friends."
"Nice brew. Very big on sweet cherry flavors and a very nice sipper."
"Poured a gorgrous dark red. Small white head doesn't last for more than a few seconds. Aroma is HUGE! The fresh juicy cherry aroma is massive. Perfect level of tartness, more so than the raspberry tart. Feel is light to moderate with a light tingle from the carbonation. This is brilliant. Super juicy drinkable."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer a lot and will be seeking it out to drink it myself."
"The bottle looks great with its red wax seal over the cap. The beer pours nice with a decent head. The color is a burnt orange red. I would opt to drink this over many desert wines. It is not the type of beer that I would want to drink in larger quantities. I was surprised how strong the cherry flavor was until I read they put a pound of cherries in every bottle. Honestly I would have liked it better if it tasted more like beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good. If you split the bottle with another person, you're in good shape - any more than that, and the sweetness of the brew might start to wear on you."
"Drinkability- very drinkable. Like drinking juice... Very very good juice"
"Thanks to zizzybalubba for this one. Pops good with a bit of bubbles. Smell is cherry candy and all cherry. There is no doubt this is a cherry beer. Thick and full of flavor and pretty sweet. Tates like a kids drink or something like that. Very different beer, but for a fruit beer, this is awesome. I drank the bottle and was wore out doing so. I think the first glass was great, but at 4% I thought I would be able to do this on my own. The last glass was starting to get to me, but the first glass was wonderful."
"drinkability - i want to give this beer a 5 the flavors are so mind blowing but the way it stings my mouth i will deduct .5 - this beer went right back oback on my want list"
"D: It felt like drinking a bowl of cherries, which is heaven for some people, but just sort of cool for me. As I said before, I was expecting a little more from a ""Belgian"" red. The pink head is cute!"
"This beer pours a muddy ruby with a nice 3 inch cap that disappears into just a thin ring around the inside of the glass. The head lingers and leaves decent lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is undiluted organic cherry juice. No added sweeteners, no preservatives, just cherry. The flavor reminds me of organic cherry fruit roll ups. Concentrated tartness intermingled with cherry sweetness. Tasty, tasty stuff. For some reason, I also pick up just a hint of chocolate. Maybe some chocolate malts are added. This beer is utterly fantastic. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy for me but really, that's a little thing. I don't know if this is the best American fruit beer (because that distinction could go to Raspberry Tart) but its damn close."
"D- This stuff is great. I dont mind having extra bottles around."
"Drinkability is good. A bit sweet and one-dimensional, but a fun beer to drink and only 4% ABV. Definitely seek this out if you love fruity beers and/or cherry. Also a great beer for those that aren't really into beer."
"D: I don't know if I can drink a single 750ml in a single sitting, but it makes for a good beer to share with friends. I can see me drinking it in the summer by the pool or in the winter next to the fireplace."
"D: Certainly not a gulper, but it's not too strong to declare it strictly a sipper. My first glass I finished very quickly and my second glass I nursed a bit more, tasting all the nuances as it warmed."
"2. Might be too sugary to have more than a bottle yourself. I could drink this all night but not sure my stomach would agree with me."
"All in all, this is a fantastic brew. So easy to drink. This of a very well balanced cherry pie. Definitely try this once if you like fruit beers and low ABV brews."
"D: Truly enjoyed this beer. This is the first fruit beer I've really enjoyed and wished I had a second bottle. Easy to drink and amazing flavor."
"D- I appreciate everything that they were going for, but it is still a bit of a sipper. Simple and kind of reminded me a fruit soda. Still, it is well executed and unique."
"[D] Overall, this one deserves some serious credit. It probably is THE BEST fruit beer I may ever enjoy, as its blown away its predecessors. I would have loved to crack another 750 behind this one, but unfortunately I only picked one up. Not at all artificial, or hard to put down, as I find most fruit beers are."
"Drinkability: A M A Z I N G. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"
"D. Incredibly drinkable - I wasn't a big fan of the raspberry tart so I got these for my wife not expecting to like them too much. It looks like I'll be trading for some more of these in the near future."
"O: Tried this one back-to-back with Founders Cerise, and there was no competition. This represents nearly everything you could hope for in a cherry fruit beer."
"This is a beer with a lot of hype that can commands a premium on the trade forums and actually deserves it. It deserves at least one shot."
"D: Incredibly drinkable, I'd be a happy camper if I could drink several glasses of this."
"Edit: Share this with a friend or two, I made the mistake of opening this up by myself. About half way through it feels like it is ripping the enamel off my teeth. It is great, but I wouldnt want to try to drink this bottle alone again!"
"Overall, a fruit beer that really is so much more. Immensely enjoyable for me and approachable for anyone. A really nice beer that lives up to the hype."
"After having this numerous times, finally getting around to reviewing it. Poured a reddish color into my trusty old shaker glass (yeah, I should've used a flute but what the hell?). A small head rises quickly and disapates nearly as fast, leaving a bit of lacing with plenty of tiny bubbles that might remind someone of champagne. Aromas of cherry and sweetness. On the palate, a little bit of malt and tart cherry. This is a delicious brew from Mr. Carey that is great by itself, or mixing it with a good stout and/or porter. VERY quaffable."
"I'm going to easily finish the bomber and will actively seek out another but its not exactly sessionable due to the intense fruit flavor."
"I really do like this. A very nice fruit beer, but does not compare to the Raspberry Tart. Very much worth a try however."
"Taste does a fruit beer as well as I've ever had. It's medium bodied, carbonated, feels thick. Extremely drinkable. I could have this all day."
"D: I was expecting to be overwhelmed with an overly sweet cherry bomb explosion in my mouth. But after a few sips, I found myself quite pleased. It's a nice change of pace from the beer world I've grown accustomed to. I think I may explore a few other fruity/sour beers in the future. Thanks to my girlfriend for sharing her bottle."
"The taste, however, is not bad, heavy, heavy on the cherries with a nearly cloying sweetness and not much else. As the beer warms, it becomes more tolerable, the cherries become more lively, and the experience much more pleasant. Maybe, again."
"Drink: I wasn't a huge fan of New Glarus' other major fruit beer, Raspberry Tart, but this one is stupid-good. Glorious balance of sweet and tart, complex while still allowing the cherries to lead the show, and good-looking to boot. Hands-down, the best fruit beer I've ever had."
"D: This beer is easy to drink, but I feel that I would get sick if I drank this too fast, or if I had more than one bottle due to the high level of residual sugar and the carbonation."
"Very nice overall!"
"And so falls the last of the Man's Weekend beer acquisitions. It pours a straight cinnabar topped by about two fingers of almost pinkish ecru foam. The nose is unsurprisingly heavy on the cherries, though a furtive little vein of medicinality seeps its way through to the surface. The taste tones down the medicine and ups the sweetness a notch, making the cherries pop all the more fiercely. It's pretty damn good, baby! The body is a nice medium, with a light carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, an extremely drinkable blast o' fruity goodness. Get some!"
"The appearance is a nice blood red color with the slightest of pinks adorning the head on the surface. Despite the cherries on the label the initial aroma that I gathered was of raspberries, and fresh ones at that. Accompanying the aroma is the sweet smell of cherry syrup. Now in describing the taste, there is basically a red fruit salad before me. Cherries, Raspberries, and hints of Strawberry to boot. The best part about the flavor of this beer in my opinion is that I actually can taste some beer maltiness behind it. That's really a pleasant surprise for me as far as the flavors are concerned. The mouthfeel is a tad too sweet for me to drink too much of but it's really a very solid fruit beer. One I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for said genre of brew."
"D: I can't think of any other beer in their arsenal that encapsulates NG's attention to detail and exemplifies their desire for high quality. I constantly remind myself that the beer contains no wild yeast....just plain old awesome old-fashioned brewing. Gotta love it for that!"
"Like a great dessert, this is best enjoyed in small quantities. After about 4 ounces, I have had my fill and the beer begins to become cloying."
"D - I could easily drink several of these. Not too sweet like I thought it would be and quite a nice refreshing beer to have. Would go great with desserts."
"One of the most complex beers in the US to date, yet still very approachable and drinkable. Excellent balance of sweetness to tartness. It's a beer worth driving to Wisconsin for, or at least finding a friend to ship you some. A mild yogurt cheddar cheese with tart apples sounds like a great pairing."
"D: was excited to try this, but somewhat let down. a darkish cherry 7-up mixed with some children's cherry cough syrup would be an apt comparison. hopefully this review (with it's high rDev and low score on a high rated beer) won't get deleted."
"D: high. just really solid, and a low ABV"
"Drinkability is no good on this one, maybe if I was a child drooling for candy, but after a while this makes one sick. I'll revisit this again sometime but it's not too appealing to me as of now."
"D- So drinkable. Sweet but not cloyingly so."
"D: Goes down ridiculously easy, not too filling, mild kick, this is a great beer that I could have again and again."
"Overall, this is easily one of the better fruit beers out there. Number 1? There are some poorly-executed cherry beers out there, and this trumps them. I'm glad this is a pretty regular NG offering, but perhaps its rank is just a bit high--but only a bit."
"Cheers and New Glarus this one is a staple."
"O - Very glad I got the chance to try this. I could see it as a fantastic dessert beer, but it would definitely have to be split among the entire table."
"Dark, cherry russet brown with a creamy pink tinted tan head that settles slow and leaves sheets of lace on the glass. The aroma is stunning.. big cherries, and not artificial cough syrupy cherry either, more like a freshly baked cherry pie with mildly toasted oak. Velvety smooth tart cherry flavors with a soft, caramelized oakiness. Full bodied and creamy with seltzery carbonation. Finishes sticky. This is really nice, proof that great beer can be under 5% ABV."
"This is the same beer as Raspberry Tart, only with cherries. They have similar malt profiles and similar levels of spices. If you like one then you will like the other. And trust me: you will like one."
"This stuff is phenomenal. One of all-time big wants since I started on BA, and no disappointment here. I could drink this everyday and be happy. So good."
"Pours a murky, dark red. Very small pinkish head. Smells like cherries, I should say like real cherries, wow. Taste is cherries, tart cherries, kind of like a homemade cherry pie, very, very good! Mouthfeel and drinkability are exceptional on this one. This beer lives up to all of it's hype. My girlfriend and I got done this bottle and just sat there, sad that we couldn't just go and buy another one. I would LOVE to get more of this and try pairing it up with some desserts and maybe some entrees. Seek this beer out!"
"D - Nice cherry flavor. What a fantastic brew. However I think I liked the raspberry tart a bit better. This has a slight artificial taste but it's still good. Definitely would have this as a constant in the fridge if it were readily available."
"I pretty much got the same taste as I did smell. It was like cherry pie all the way through, with a nice sweet taste to it. Not a fizzy carbonation or anything like that either, just a very fruity beer."
"D - its only flaw is in its simplicity."
"The ulltimate cherry pie beer. Poured with a huge, foamy, frothy, thick, light tan head and a little lace. Color is red amber. Aroma is malt, sour cherries, and spice. Flavor's exactly like nose. Body is perfect and carbonation is the ultimate and cuts through the flavors exactly right. Finish is fairly long and exquisite. Not a session for me, but a great beer for desert or on a picnic."
"Bottle. Pours a clear reddish brown hued color with a slight red head that pillows to the top of the glass. Honestly, the aroma is strong smell of cherry fruit punch! When you drink this I think it would be totally possible to not really know it is beer. Ever so slight tart beginning that transitions to a full boddied cherry flavor. Very clean tasting. Light/medium mouthfeel. You do not taste the alcohol at all! For a fruit beer this is just outstanding. Full of fruit flavors AND alcoholic. mmm"
"D- if youre in the mood for a cherry beer and youve had this before, there probably isnt a suitable substitute. its truly one of a kind. low enough ABV to be sessionable, but im not sure how much i could have before needing a change of pace."
"DB- This and the Raspberry Tart give me a reason to go to Wisconsin some time, absolutely awesome beers. Amazing flavor with a great sweet to tart balance. A eye-opening experience."
"Quite drinkable with a lively level of carbonation. Overall a fine example of the style. My only gripe is that I find myself half way through the experience drinking it faster just because it starts to get a bit too acidic and agitate the back of my throat."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable but definitely not as much as Raspberry Tart, crazy carbonation, kind of hindered it for me. Not sure which one I liked more, the flavors for this one had a bit more complexity which I dug. What can I say, another amazing fruit-hard-to-believe-it's-beer from New Glarus."
"D-this is just tasty, it isn't complex or adventurous, its just tons of delicious cherries with a light to even moderate amount of sourness with a great feel to it and enough malt body to give it some balance."
"M/D: Normally, I would say you couldn't drink more then one or two of these throughout the course of a night, not this one. It has a nice rich body with perfect carbonation. I really want to drive the four hours to Wisconsin to buy this again right now. For my first beer from New Glarus I would have to start the slow clap and build up to a thunderous roar..."
"You don't feel like you are drinking beer, but get rid of those preconceived notions and this is an absolute treat. Highly recommended."
"D- This stuff goes down so incredibly well. I never would have expected so much aroma and flavor from a lower alcohol beer. Perfect for hot summer weather. This is definitely one of the biggest treats I have experienced all year!!!"
"D: for a 5% beer its not crazy drinkable compared to others but this is just different from others. it will take me a minute to kill the bottle but I opened it on a hot day and was in the mood for this so the beer is just what i wanted. if you're not in the mood for big fruit then you wont like it"
"Had this when I was in Wisconsin. Man This beer was a eye opener. Smell great with the tart cherries and the drink was smooth as wine. The taste was great. Not what I aspected from a beer but it was great.They are on there game. New Glarus have fans out on the east coast.Wish they could at least shipped to PA."
"Flavor is tasty...very sweet, high carbonation, light to medium body. Flavor is mostly cherry...and not much else. This is a great dessert beer. Even though it's not your every day beer...it's a great alternative if you're in the mood for something similar to a fruity champaigne. Nice fruit beer!"
"D- Really easy to drink this beer. Wife had a few sips but I finished the bottle very easily. Very refreshing and mouthwatering, highly reccomend."
"ISO more! Amazing beer I would enjoy frequently if I lived in Wisconsin. Track this down and drink it now! You will not regret it."
"D: This is a good beer! Definitley a sipper. I'm gona have no problem finishing this one on my own! Glad I got another one in the cellar waiting for me!"
"D: Refreshing and delicious. Having an entire bottle to yourself proves to be a bit too much but it is great to share with friends."
"D - The flavor of this is just outstanding. New Glarus is very quickly becoming one if not my favorite brewery. Everything I have from them is really good. Definitely don't pass this up if you get a chance. For $8.99 for a 750 it is just an absolute steal too."
"Very good :) Though a bit sweet for my taste."
"D: Low in abv and enticing flavor make this a very enjoyable beer and a good choice for a celebratory beer with friends."
"This is a drinkable fruit beer. It's sweeter than a lambic but much smoother. If you don't love cherries, you'll probably not like it, but if you are a cherry lover, this will be quite a treat. It goes well with chocolate or any cherry dessert."
"Drinkability: This beer is a superb dessert. I could have one every night if I could afford it and it was actually available in PA. I think this might be better than the raspberry tart."
"Pours a lovely reddish color with a small white head. Aroma is sweet cherries. Taste is the same but insanely intense and potent with some additional tartness coming through. Very bubble and lively as you sip this is a delicious and unique beer. Would definitely drink this again. YUM!"
"MF/D: an intensely fruity beer with the smoothest carbonation possible (considering how much it has). not a fruit beer kind of guy, but i could practically be content with a case of this for the night."
"Drinkability - For fruit beers, quite so; for normal drinking not so much. Granted, I would not drink this just for the hell of it. This is a very tasty desert beer, or just a beer to enjoy around the holidays. I have another one of these coming via a trade and look forward to pairing it with some dark chocolate and/or brownies. A very good beer."
"If you haven't had this, get on it! New Glarus is my life..."
"Oh yes. tart cherry juice, your hired, all others need not apply. The tartness matching with the sweetness is what makes this beer as amazing as it is, that and the dry and fine tight carbination playing around. I wish i could say more about something other then cherries...but i can't, and really there is no need to have anything else in this beer."
"Love this beer. Can't wait until we meet again!"
"Drinkability -- The flavor is one-dimensional, but so perfectly captures the flavor of ripe cherries that it is easily overlooked. Drinks easy, but I probably couldn't do a whole bottle. This is a worthy beer for one who loves cherries."
"I was quite surprised at this beer, surprised and disappointed. Normally I am a fan of all things new glarus but this beer was just too damn fruity. It smells like cherries, it tastes like cherries, it's cherry red. I mean, I like cherries and all but this stuff is like cough syrup. I wanted some beer with my fruit salad. One glass was enough, one bottle was far too much. For a brewery that ordinarily makes such well-balanced beers, this cherry thing has gotten a little out of hand. If I wanted juice, I wouldn't be drinking beer."
"The aroma is strongly cherry and not much else. On the tongue the cherry flavor is backed up by a bit of a grain taste.The body was very effervescent and crisp, sweet without being sticky. Drinkability will depend on how you like sweet and fruity brews, I loved it and would lots more if it were available to me."
"I don't know if it's possible to improve upon a beer like this... absolutely delicious. I wish I'd brought another back from WI after my last trip. Kudos to New Glarus."
"Drinkability: This is not the kind of beer I would normally think about sessioning, but it has such a great balance of sweet and (mostly) tart cherry flavor that this could be a surprise addition to my regular stash."
"This will be a staple of our future tastings with the neighbors!"
"EDIT on 11/09/12: Have had this many times over the years, most recently last weekend on 11/02/12. Possibly my favorite fruit beer ever; this beer is amazing."
"I fear this one doesn't live up to the hype for me. I was especially let down because I had just had New Glarus's Unplugged Cranbic the night before which really impressed me so I had especially high expectations."
"M/D: Medium to fuller body. Lots of zippy, small carbonation. A very rich fruit beer. Drinkability is hard to rate for this one. Its easy to drink, more like a pop than a beer, but I couldn't do much of this. Split a 750 and that is plenty. Good overall."
"D: Great beer and representation of the style."
"Poured at a recent BA tasting event. Someone said that these NG beers are what you give to people who say they don't like beer as a way to convert them and I can easily see that. This pours a hazy auburn and smells overwhelmingly like maraschino cherries. The taste is like drinking a cherry dum-dum pop. Very sweet. Light on the tongue but the sweetness for me was overwhelming and I didn't want any more than about 2oz of it. Warrant would love this beer."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into 2 snifters. It pours a fizzy, quava color, with lots of white head and lacing. The smell is pure cherries. At first the cherry flavor is a bit much, and overly sweet. But by the second sip the cherry flavor really comes through making it very refreshing. The beer is highly carbonated, light in body and very wine like. For me this is more of a sipper. The best fruit beer I have ever had, IMO a must try for any BA."
"D- In short I didn't really like this beer at all. I drank one lambic glass full and gave the rest away-which is easy because this is a very popular beer. To me it gave the impression of cough syrup without the medicinal aspect (which would have been an improvement...IMO). I really respect that this beer is all cherry without being artificial...which is why I am trying not to slam it too much...but this brew is just not for me."
"Bottle. Pours a hazy, reddish-cranberry color with a small frothy off-white/pink head, good lacing. Aroma is cherries mostly with a hint of caramel malt. Flavor is sour cherries, a hint of oak, and some wine/grape flavors. Mouthfeel is medium, sour and a fairly active carbonation. Very drinkable beer."
"Overall thoughts are I can't believe I passed this bottle up so many times. I will be in WI again this week and will definitely be on the lookout for another bottle. This may be a good gateway beer for the right person. Great alternative to someone who likes wine coolers."
"I really doubt there is any alcohol in this beer, but New Glarus insists there is. I feel kinda stupid enjoying this juice box so much, but it is great, a nice after meal treat..."
"5.0 D: I need more of these fruit twins. This is the PERFECT dessert beer for both beer aficianados and BMC guzzlers alike. I'm both sad and disgusted that I only have one bottle left."
"A near perfect fruit beer for my tastes in most every regard. Aroma and flavor are dominated by rich, complex and completely natural fresh cherries. Thick, syrupy body with fine carbonation and a long lasting sour and tart cherry finish. Appearance is murky, thick rust and blood color with a large cream colored head with a light rosy tint. Long lasting retention and thick rings of web like lacing. Only thing keeping this from being all 5s for me is that I would prefer a little more tart to sweet cherry flavor, but it's a minor concern."
"This beer poured a lovely, hazy, deep ruby red with a white cap that had the slightest pink in it. The body is a shade darker than the Cranbic. Lots of cherries (Bing and Maraschino type) and a hint of apples. The flavor is so similar to the aroma that the only difference is that I discern a touch more tartness in it. Overall very sweet. Smooth texture, light and bubbly. A great drinker all around."
"D - Great stuff; it was enjoyed by all."
"All parties agreed that this brew would be best for either a hot day or a brunch. It was really great for what it was, but I couldn't drink more than one goblet of this in one sitting, whereas I happily drank the entire bottle of Raspberry Tart in a short amount of time."
"But it is not a total loser... It is enjoyable for what it is...It is a fruitbeer afterall."
"I really liked this beer. It reminds me of Samuel Smith's Organic Cherry. It pours a dark red and smells like cherry, of course. The taste is great, sweet like cherry but not too sweet. I highly recommend this beer for anyone who likes fruit beers, Samuel Smith's Cherry, or New Glarus beers."
"As far as fruit beers go, amazing...but not like typical beers. There were definitely moments where I just wanted to tip the glass back and chug, so be careful and refrain from doing so."
"D: This was good, but I'm not crazy about it to be honest. It reminded me a bit of table wine: very sweet and appealing to drink in small doses. After I was about half-way through the bottle, however, I'd had enough. It just got a little too sweet after a while. I wouldn't drink 750 ml of fruit juice, and that's basically what this tastes like. Despite this, it's still a very respectable fruit beer. The Red Raspberry is much better IMO."
"Overall, a great cherry inspired fruit beer. Can lean a little towards sweet at the end of your glass, but it never struck me as an artificial fruitiness. Give it a shot"
"Overall I really loved this beer, but I absolutely love cherries. Cherries are probably my favorite fruit and this beer really tastes like real cherries instead of the fake extract in a lot of cherry beers."
"D- I could drink this for days."
"M/D - Medium carbonation and body. The taste lingers with you and gives you time to think about it for a minute or longer after having it. One of two perfect beers I have ever had. I need more Wisconsin Belgian Red!"
"D - Very drinkable, could session this all day but for the limited distribution. However, just because you could doesn't mean you should..."
"Bright ruby red in color. Looks like a red wine with a soft pick head, while short-lived has lot's of body and texture. Smells like you're walking through a cherry orchard. No malts, hops, ect..., none needed, the cherries do the job. I could sit here and smell this beer all day. Flavor follows the aroma. Cheeries. Not cough drop cherry flavoring. Real fresh cherries with all of the sweetness and tartness that cheeries have. Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium with great carbonation. I wouldn't call this a session beer but it sure is easy to get this one down. Thanks brewcrew!"
"I love this beer! First you have to consider the elegant packaging... the green 750ml bottle, the red wax, even the label is classy. Then you pour... aroma is a blast of fresh pie cherries. And the color, a hazy beautiful dark pink-red complete with a light pink head which fades quickly. Taste is a refreshing, sweet-tart, complex sour, acetic, cherry flavor. Not for amateurs! My friend and girlfriend didn't really care for it and they gave me theirs. She said the tartness and carbonation reminded her of the inside of Zots candy. More for me! Just one drop of this beer is loaded with flavors."
"Pours pink/red and slightly hazy. Fizzy champagne bubbles. Aroma is amazing. No harsh chemically or plastic aroma. Spicy cherry aroma. Warm inviting cherry flavor, alcohol, spice, aged wood. Dry, warm finish. Lingering tart cherries. Just enough background malt ot make it a beer. #2 New Glaurus fruit beer, just behind the Raspberry Tart."
"Ruddy red colored pour with a small loose head. Tart cherry and sweet pie aroma with a hint of funk. Sweet tart cherry pie flavor with slight cane sugar, vinegar, apple cider and biscuit. The body is sticky, medium full with lots of effervescent carbonation."
"Nice effervescent body. Carbonation level is spot on. Smooth finish. Wow. Flavors of cherries abound! Finishes tart and slightly drying. Mild bread flavors. Bitterness is low. This is all about the fruit. I could drink bottle after bottle of this stuff. The low ABV makes this extremely accessible. Splendid beer. I could have this and the Raspberry Tart for any celebration. Great job, NG!"
"Overall: Not the most balanced beer (to say the least), but again...the flavor profile is out of this world. I highly recommend acquiring a bottle or two. Man, am I glad my girlfriend brought me back two of these bad boys! Cheers!"
"This was worth the wait and will be worth the effort to track down another."
"M/D - The feel is medium to full with a slick syrupy feel left behind. The strong sweetness brings the drinkability down a notch and I certainly wish I had one or two people to share it with. I would still take Raspberry Tart over this one, but this is one of the best fruit beers I have had."
"Now I may have to try the Raspberry brew!"
"Its less like beer and more like cherry soda."
"Overall, this beer is fantastic. I have had it multiple times and it always delivers. It is just so amazing. This is a beer I love to have access to. Very drinkable and it packs a huge fresh flavor."
"I had this beer to celebrate my brother moving into his new house and I was anticipating this to be the greatest beer ever. When i saw the beer It wasnt the most impressive beer i have ever seen, but i felt that when you make a cherry beer it would look like this, in that aspect the brewer had gotten exactley what they wanted. The smell was wonderful. When you are making a cherry beer you should smell Cherrys and nothing but. That is exactly what i smelled. The taste hit me as medicinal. I dont like to ever speak bad of beers but i could not shake the fact that it tasted like cough medicine. The mouthfeel was an exception to the taste. The beer seemed to be perfectly carbonated and didnt give me any reason to review it as bad. The drinkability of this beer was not good FOR ME. I emphasize for me because I know that there are people that could drink this like crazy but i am more of a beer guy and never drink wine. I feel bad to ever give out a bad review but to me this beer was like a fine painting that would never look good in my house but I can thoroughly appreciate the effort and time put into it."
"D: Like juice. This is so appealing to me that I could drink it for breakfast. Just tart enough that the sweetness does not dominate at makes this the perfect fruit beer."
"This is a very interesting beer, and it reminds me very much of some fruit infused lambics I've tried (would be interested in trying this beer side by side with Lindeman's cherry lambic). However, the intensity of flavor in this beer really impressed me, and sets it apart from most Belgian fruit lambics I've tried. Good stuff!"
"An excellent brew and a definite must try!"
"The beer pours a rosy red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding! It has a killer cherry scent that's so tart and refreshing. I love sour cherries in beer. This is very much like the aroma of Lindeman's Kriek. The taste is perfect! It captures the essence of what a fruit beer can and should be. It's bold and refreshing with tons of tart fruit character. The mouthfeel is perfect as well. It's medium bodied with good carbonation. This and their Raspberry tart are by leaps and bounds the best fruit beers on the planet. I only wish it wasn't so hard to get my hands on them. Thanks to Tim and Mary Anderson for the opportunity to try these."
"D: each sip keeps you coming back for more, this beer is expertly balanced between sweet and tart and is the best fruit beer I have ever tried. The abv is undetectable and the drinkability is through the roof"
"D: I dont think I would be able to have more than a glass of this becaus it does get to be a little bit on the sweet side and i typically like my fruit beers to be sour"
"D: Very enjoyable, but certainly only one in a sitting and it should be shared. I will certainly be enjoying more of these in the future."
"Pours reddish-orange with a white head. Aroma is unmistakable, lots of sugar, cherries and something that reminds me of red wine. The flavor is more cherries, with a ton of sweetness. This tastes like cherry filling inside of a fried pie. Mouthfeel is syrupy and carbonation is medium-low. Easily the best fruit beer I have ever sampled."
"Get this one and make yourself popular."
"Pours a brilliant, bright red color with a couple fingers of pink colored head that dissolves into a thin ring around the glass. This beer actually does have a cherry like appearance. Fantastic. The aroma is strictly tart fresh cherries. The flavor is the same, straight up cherry juice with a little lambic flair. Its light-medium bodied with a prickly amount of carbonation and finishes dry. The simplicity of the aroma and the flavor is what makes this an amazing beer. Another top-notch fruit beer from New Glarus."
"Wow what a sweet syrupy beer.. If you want to know what this taste like get a Hostess Cherry fruit pie and eat the filling puree inside of it and well you get the picture. This is without a doubt a desert beer and would be awesome for any after dinner treat..Worth the effort!..recommend"
"We preferred this beer over the Raspberry Tart which seemed a bit dryer when swallowing."
"Feel and Drinkability: Spritzy and fine carbonation, almost like it burns, it attacks the palate and fills the mouth in a most pleasing way....but not like soda and yet it doesn't interfere with the beer's flavor. Body is a bit heavier than I expected, medium in body going toward heavy. Very champagne like. This is one that I'd regularly celebrate with if only I could get my hands on it."
"Drinkability: Not excellent, for me anyway. Too sweet to really be consumer en masse, but not bad, either. Paired with the right dessert, I'm sure it's exquisite, and with the right lady, I'm sure it's even more so. An experience for sure, and worth trying."
"A shining beacon for fruit beers in an sea of otherwise extract-laden crap. I don't know how they do these, but the beer world would be a better place if more people knew."
"D: Fuller bodied than most other fruit beers which really works here. A bit more complex and the silkiness ties all the flavors together. Deserving of the hype in its style."
"A great beer, one that I hope to have again. New Glarus definitely has their ducks in a row when it comes to these fruity tart beers!"
"Great beer that I look forward to enjoying again."
"Great fruit beer. Its nice to have a pure fruit beer and not a beer with fruit. A little drier and more carbonation and this would be perfect."
"Drinkability - Fruit beers are, for me, generally a fairly unimpressive category. New Glarus does these right, though. Really captures the essence of the fruit."
"D: I found this beer impressive, though I've got to admit I think it takes more like fermented cherry juice than it does like beer. Being sweet and loaded with cherry flavor, I found this one to be a very easy drinker. However, being sweet and loaded with cherry flavor, I don't think I'll be making this a regular beer anytime soon."
"Move along, this isn't the fruit/cherry beer you're looking for. I'm certainly surprised at the ratings around these parts."
"Overall, it's kind of one-dimensional (cherry!), but I liked this a lot."
"drinkability is good. the brew is pleasant and drinkable; the only complaint here is that it could be less sweet and a bit more acidic or tart. oh well."
"I feel their Raspberry Tart is a much better fruit beer than this one."
"I'm really impressed with this one. I poured it out and I could already smell the fresh cherries! It looks like a Belgian dubbel, but with a bit more burgundy color to it--decent off-white head that fades to wisps on the surface of the beer. Aroma is outrageous--straight fresh cherries! It tastes pretty amazing too, with big sweet and tart cherry flavors, followed by a spicy wheat/malt backbone with some cinnamon spice. It tastes almost exactly like cherry pie. A fantastic cherry beer here, medium mouthfeel, creamy carbonation. My only complaint is that it is a bit too sweet for me, definitely tough to move through the whole bomber, but a great beer to share with friends after a meal."
"FANTASTIC! The aroma is full of ripe, sweet cherries with a hint of malt. The flavor is absolutely full of cherry flavor perfectly balanced with a wonderful malt/wheat backbone that makes it taste like a fresh cherry pie, including subtle spices that remind you of cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. One of my favorite beers!"
"I know it's hard to make, but keep it up, Dan!"
"Drinkability: this one goes down easily despite the sweetness. Great after dinner beer."
"D- Way to sweet for me. Glad I got to try it and split this one with a few others."
"Got to try a bottle of this last summer thanks to a beer trade friend. The colour was cloudy and amber with a temporarily thick head. The aroma was cherries, cherries and more cherries! On the palate, it was like getting a cherry pie in the face, and thoroughly enjoying it! Loads of pie cherry flavour, and even pie crust with hints of cinnamon and baking sugar. What a nice beer!!"
"D- Refreshing and delicious. The kind of beer my mom(or anyone who doesn't like beer) would and should drink."
"The mouthfeel is light and its very drinkable despite how sweet it is."
"D-A good special occasioned beer. I really enjoyed this one very much as an after dinner treat."
"D- This is one of most easy drinking beers I've had, even with the sweetness. Whenever I take a drink, I just want to keep drinking."
"Drinkability: i think this is a well crafted beer, but not my style. i would like to try it with ice cream or other dessert. i think people who appreciate fruit beers would definitely enjoy this one."
"Because it's just so overloaded in sweet cherry, it's just not something that should be enjoyed more than as a dessert beer. (as I was left to enjoy the entire bomber by myself)"
"D: A good beer. The taste is better than the smell, thankfully. Impressive flavors considering the low ABV. I could really see this one working well as a dessert or coupled with dessert. But it's too sweet to drink a lot of."
"Overall, this is a perfect example of what a fruit beer can and should be. New Glarus has many beers worth making the hour-long trip from my home to Wisconsin, and this is certainly one of them."
"D - could drink over and over fantastic !!"
"D - Drank the whole 25 oz bottle. Wanted more. Easy to drink. Fantastic."
"The pour is quite gorgeous, hazy and turbid ruby red with a large, dense off white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is pure cherry juice, fresh and refreshing with a delicious blend of tartness and sweetness. Mildly jammy, this is glorious! The palate is similar, with sweet cherries, rich and pure. Mild tartness is present and the acidity and funk are very restrained (almost non-existent) for a beer that's supposed to have wild yeast and bacteria. The finish is a touch disappointing, with the sweetness fizzling out rather rapidly. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is a treat, but my 8oz were sufficient. I would never turn this down, though."
"D: A really great and tasty beer. I don't think I could drink the whole 750ml though, as it is very sweet."
"Pours a very hazy red color - and I mean red, not amber, but like ripe cherries or pomegranates. The head is thin and fizzy, with loose bubbles - white colored, kind of fades fast and only leaves tiny bits of lacing. Looks pretty normal for a fruit beer, but not extremely exiting. The smell is just full of ripe cherries. There a not unsurprising tartness, probably both from the fruit and the yeast, but the fruit is incredibly dominant, which is what is supposed to happen here. The smell isn't like candied cherries, or like cough syrup (well, maybe only a little bit), but the cherries smell amazing. When you taste it, you can kind of sense the beer in this - slightly bready, with a little bit of pale grainy sweetness. But still the cherries are allowed to shine, and enhanced by the yeast profile. The cherries come out first, like the tart orange/yellow cherries - rainier cherries I think, then it becomes like a darker, deep red, fully ripe sweet cherry - like bing cherries, then it takes on an aspect of black cherry cola with a rush of carbonation, and finishes with a yeasty tartness, still mingled with some cherry sweetness. Really a nice fruit profile on this. The body on this is nice and light and crisp, but the fruit actually makes it feel a little more full, but the crisp bite of carbonation keeps it in check. A very enjoyable beer. The depth of fruit is very interesting, a bit slowing, but not cloying. And at barely over 5%, you could stick with this for quite a bit."
"(D)- I could drink this all day if I could. A great dessert or apertif beer that would even please and surprise those non-beer drinkers that you know!"
"Fruit beers don't get much better than this one. You can tell that this is a truly artisinal beer that goes above and beyond the usual fruit flavoring added to these types of beers. This is one that would please most crowds."
"D- Could drink this all the time. Plus I would choose this over wine every time. This beer is deserving of all the praise that it gets."
"D - Very high. I could easily finish a big bottle of this."
"D: This is the best fruit beer I've ever had. I could drink this forever if it wasn't so rare. New Glarus took the time and fermented real cherries and it shows in the taste, there's just no substitute for the real thing. With all the artificial flavour out there in the fruit beers today, you've got to look to New Glarus for the best. If I ever get to Wisconsin I'm buying a case of this stuff, and I've never bought a case of anything in my life. I've been wanting to try this forever, and it did not disappoint. Wow!"
"D - This is an exceptionally drinkable beer. Alcohol level is low, and it's presence is undetectable while drinking it. Very much like cherry champagne. This would go great with any kind of dark chocolate based dessert."
"Its a great fruit beer if a bit sweet."
"750 from the last Wisco voyage"
"Acidic right off the bat, very tart cherry. Nice sweet malts uncovered with no hop presence. Bready tastes as well. Not as thin as I was expecting which adds a really nice texture to this beer. Very easy drink with slight wine characteristics. Very acidic again on the end. This was an easy drink, and to all you young cats out there trying to get your groove on with some honey, pop one of these and let the night begin."
"HV"
"75cl bottle, thanks to photomike for bringing both this and the raspberry tart to the August SC tasting! This is another great fruit beer by NG, but I'm afraid it suffered a little bit being tasted along side raspberry tart, which is hands down the most amazing fruit beer that I have ever had. Maybe it's just my preference for raspberries though, because the beers were almost the same except for the fruit flavor. Red color with a small head. The aroma is just a surge of cherry pie, almost leaning toward maraschino cherries in a fake way, but managing to tip-toe the line and come across a little more like pie-filling. The flavor is pure cherry pie with a light tartness and surprising and welcomed lack of sweetness in the finish. The aroma doesn't burst with quite the amazingness of raspberry tart, but this was quite good in its own right."
"Bottle pours dark red color with a head that looks tan colored. Aroma is cherry candy. Has a medium mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Flavor is sweet cherry and not much else. This reminds me of a cherry candy I used to eat when I was a kid. That's what the flavor is to me. Overall its what I expected it to be."
"Stuffed with great cherry character. I enjoyed this."
"I've found it pairs well with good, dark chocolate."
"D: Highly drinkable as I can down sweet beers, but this one could be too sweet to drink a whole lot of. This has good flavor and not really any alcohol flavor."
"As I contemplate drinking more than a share of a bottle I lean towards thinking that the sweetness was a little too much, I would struggle to finish a bottle by myself. I would prefer a little more tart, perhaps a little more dimension. That said, this is a phenomenal, world-class beer that I am making a point to get more of - especially because it is wife approved!"
"The taste, mouthfeel and drinkability are all harmoniously welded. The balance between sour and sweet is incredible. Each receptor in your tounge is overwhelmed with flavor. Once you start to quaff this elixer, it's hard to stop. The body just demands more and more. If Belgian Red was sold by the gallon that'd be fine with me."
"D: As tasty and unusual a beer as I've had yet one best kept in small doses; I recapped the bottle in hopes of enjoying later, with dessert. Absolutely worth trying/seeking out, certainly one to be shared."
"An amazing beer, i just can't understand how they get so much cherry flavor in the beer. But personally it's too sweet for me."
"So, what's the verdict on Wisconsin Belgian Red? Well, it's without question a really impressive fruit beer. But, it is a fruit beer. I like it, but I'm not quite in love with it. I'm not sure that I've ever 'loved' a fruit beer. Just not my thing. It's very sweet and is probably best appreciated in concentrated amounts. But, it's easily one of the better fruit beers I've encountered. It's not very beer like, but has a strong enough flavor to be an overall success. From me, that's big for a fruit beer. Trust this. Definitely pick up a bottle if you have the opportunity. Just keep in mind that you're getting a fruit beer."
"This beer pours a beautiful blood red with a tiny bit of head and lots of little carbonation bubbles that float to the top. The smell is of rich cherries. There's a slight whiff of alchohol and a little earthy grassiness. The flavor is so intense with cherry you swear you were drinking a glass of s straight cherry juice. I get a mild alcohol flavor more akin to wine then beer but it's faint. The flavor comes on sweet and tart and finishes so smooth it's scary. The carbonation dances with every gulp. Gulp is the proper word too. You find yourself taking drink after drink because NG made it so damn enjoyable. I've yet to meet anyone who can't enjoy this lambic."
"High drinkability, however the big bottle would be better shared than drank alone. My palate usually gets a bit fatigued by the end of the second glass. But a small price to pay for such a terrific beer. Cheers!"
"I have to say, I am a much bigger fan of Raspberry Tart, but this is still a more than stellar offering. Highly recommended and it definitely earned it's spot in the Top 100."
"D) I could probably have the whole thing but I'd feel bad about not sharing - it's too good to hog."
"D: A very nice fruit beer. Not quite as good as the Raspberry Tart, but a great representative of the style. Many thanks to mnjeff for the trade!"
"D and overall impression: For me, it is too sweet. I really enjoy the flavor component, but I had to share the bottle with a good buddy of mine. So it doesn't get high marks here. Overall, I think this could be a beer my wife would like,(she's not a craft beer lover). I like it, just don't love it. Skal."
"Overall: Great drinkability, nice smooth feel, nice faint tartness to balance out the strong sweetness. Nice dry feel toward the end. The cherry flavor is NOT artificial which I was a bit worried about, but the cherry flavor is very sweet like really ripe cherries."
"Taste is fresh, sweet, very cherry and clean and at the same time a little earthy. The sweet and earthy seems like an impossible combination. The mouth feel is like sweet tarts. Lots of bite. This is such a refreshing beer for a summer day. Best served cool. The only reason I discounted the drinkability is the sweetness. It may be hard to drink much of this at once. I would be hard pressed to find a better beer in this category. It is easy to see how this beer won the Belgian beer contest IN BELGIUM!!"
"D - This is the best fruit beer I have tried without a doubt"
"D: I'm not the hugest fan of fruit beers, so I won't go out of my way to trade for this. But I'm glad it was suggested to me as a trade, because it turned out to be damn good. If I saw it in person, I'd get it again."
"From a 750 ml bottle this poured a very rich and dark cherry head with almost no head. The nose is very strongly cherries and some hard to identify spices. Very lively mouthfeel. Flavor is sweet with the cherries dominating. This is a remarkable fruit beer."
"would have liked just a touch more acidity and even just a trace of funk or farmhouse. oh well. still, this is nice, although the sweetness keeps the drinkability from scoring higher."
"The liquid pours a creamy red with a quick-dying head. The smell was of sweet cherries and the taste was exactly the same. I expected this and enjoyed it for what it was, even though it bordered on coy for me. Personally, I would have *preferred* a beer I could see through, lighter body and a bit cleaner on the finish. But the effervescent tingle in my mouth after each sip was wonderful."
"Overall, very nice taste and quite drinkable. I wouldn't call this a typical kriek, but it is good nonetheless."
"D- One or two glasses is pleanty for me so a whole bottle is too much. The tartness and fruit flavors become too much for my palete. I enjoyed this beer when it was cold, like fridge cold, it was fun to taste it as it warmed but I found it better cold. Also I really regret not pairing this beer with some food or cheese."
"The drink is crisp, medium-bodied, and quaffable with a snappy spritz of refreshing carbonation. A super-easy drinker on a hot June afternoon."
"Pours an almost clear brown with red hues. Very thin tan head that doesn't stick around. Nose is cherry juice. Flavor is much of the same. Tastes like cherry cough syrup almost. Almost seems like a touch of apple cider on the back there as well. Eck. Feel is much like the flavor. Syrupy. Carbonation is a bit lower I guess. Good lord. What a disappointment. I think this is going to be a bit of a challenge to drink. I put this on the level of all those overly sugared fruit beers from Belgium. This just makes me miss Liefmans Kriek even more."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Another outstanding effort from New Glarus."
"Cheers Troy!"
"D - Goes down really smooth. No alcohol detected at all. But that's not really a surprise."
"Fruit doesn't belong in beer. That being said, this was a pretty good fruit beer."
"D - Split this with my girlfriend but probably could have easily split this three ways. We finished it easily, but my craving for this type of beer has been satisfied for a while."
"D: Too much fruit for one person to finish off a whole bottle, but, found it to be a superior after dinner drink. Nicely done, Dan!"
"Another excellent desert brew from NG. Much like the Raspberry Tart this would pair well with anything chocolate. Highly recommended to any fan of cherries and tart and funky fruit brews. Ill be enjoying this one again soon enough."
"Good for after dinner or a single drink, I believe it may be too syrupy to have any more than a single glass. I'm glad (and she's glad too) that I shared this with my girlfriend. She loved it. Looking forward to more of this stuff!"
"D: Absolutely sublime. If I were able to get this at all times, I would never have a mimosa ever again. The perfect fruit-flavored concoction and a wonderful almost-summer treat. So long lawnmower ales, hello Wisconsin Belgian Red."
"overall this is probably one of the better fruit beers i have had the joy of drinking. very nice."
"This gets a bit much towards the end. The flavor is fine, but man you start to really feel the sugar. This and the Raspberry Tart are so close when it comes to preference it's almost ridiculous; the Tart may have a slight edge in taste, but not much. Both fantastic beers."
"Overall Impression: Cherries! Dessert in a glass."
"d: Thanks to imperialking for this one. Very good, but I prefer the Raspberry Tart."
"Pours a fairly clear reddish brown that's appears to be carbonated like a cola. A small white head clings to the side of the glass. Smells of world class cherries a not much else. First sip is tart full of cherries with a tad of oak and vanilla note present but lacking in malt. Very lightly carbonated. Super sweet - closer to wine than beer."
"Cloudy ruby color with a small head that lingers for a long time. Smell is dominated by tart and sweet cherries, with a little bit of malt in the background. Taste: cherries, delicious cherries. The perfect balance of tart, sour, and sweet. Whatever beer flavor is in here is very subtle; think of Wisconsin Belgian Red as more of a fruit wine than a lambic. So while the beer-lover in me might wonder what the hype is about, my tastebuds will not deny how fantastically delicious this is. High sugar content makes for a slightly syrupy mouthfeel, though high carbonation keeps it from being unpleasant. Sweetness limits drinkability, but yummy cherry flavors beckon me for another glass."
"what a great brew! and my non-beer drinking wife thoroughly enjoyed it as well (in addition to my wine drinking only neighbors)."
"D - A beer I'd want to drink around Christmas instead of those shitty macro Christmas beers."
"D - This is a very enjoyable beer for special occasions or holidays and one that can be used to supplement or replace wine. The cost alone makes it a beer I couldn't have frequently, but when the moment is right I certainly wouldn't pass it up. I could put a bottle of this down rather easily."
"Conclusion: Perfect. Dessert. Beer."
"D: Very drinkable beer, I wish this was available in CT all the time. Really not what I expected and I was blown away."
"Not really a fan of fruit beer or cherries but this one still tasted good to me, so if you are a fan of either you will probably be in love with this beer. The only knock I have on it is the drinkability because, like I said, I haven't gotten into the style yet."
"Poured from wax sealed bottle into New Belgium goblet. Pours a clear medium ruby red with about 1/2"" foamy pinkish head that settles to a bubble film with some sticky lacing. Aroma is very strong sugary sweet but very tart cherries. Cherry is the only thing I can smell in this beer, but that's ok because I love cherries. The aroma literally makes my mouth water. Taste is intensely rich, sweet and tart cherries. I love it. It's like liquid cherry pie. Medium bodied, high carbonation, feels a little sticky sweet. The sweetness limits the drinkablility just a tad, it's a little cloying, but this beer is so delicious, I can't put the glass down. Couldn't drink this beer very often, but it makes a great treat once and a while."
"D= Amazing. I would expect nothing less. This beer actually tastes like cherry pie and is a delicious dessert beer. Great brew."
"This may be the best fruit beer on the planet. I know I haven't had a better one yet, but it is very delicious and ANYONE beer drinker or not should seek this one out if they get a chance. This could convert some non-beer drinkers to start."
"If I would have one compliant about this beer, is that it is too sweet to drink more than a glass of. I tried to sit down and drink a bottle by myself and couldn't finish it. Plan to drink this with friends (especially non-beer lovers, who may be converted with this sweet nectar)."
"This is an amazingly drinkable beer. I have had it more times than I can count. Every time that I have this beer I am amazed by how good it is."
"Yet another excellent brew from New Glarus. I like the Raspberry Tart better personally, but this is crafted just as well. Seek this one out if you are a fan of kriek."
"Not at all complex, just an exquisitely crafted fruit beer that has exceptional drinkability. Fans of cherries and/or fruit beers should seek this one out. Thanks to dancinwillie for the opportunity to savor this Wisconsin treasure."
"D- This 5% beer would fill my fridge if I lived near NG. This is great on it's own or paired with some dessert or with other beer's. You really can't go wrong with it. Probably would be a great hit with the ladies as well."
"M & D - Finishes dry and crisp, leaving little aftertaste. Can't taste the alcohol at all in it. I think this is a highly sessionable brew, if you've got deep pockets. Some people don't like the sweet brews like this, but I think I could drink this one all day long."
"D: Great, if you can over the cough syrup."
"Pours a deep, ruby mahogany red. Head appears but goes away quickly. Beautiful color. Smell is not surprisingly of cherries. Big, dark, perfectly ripe cherries. Only knock is the lack of other aromas, but this beer is what it is, and it does it well. Taste, again, cherries. Not complex in the sense that other beers are, but just fantastic. Not at all syrupy or overly sweet, just intense cherry flavor. What can I say - I absolutely loved it. Would not want this every day, or even every week, but this beer at the right time and place is simply amazing."
"This is probably the first beer I could drink with a meal. Incredibly tasty and I will seek this out any chance I get."
"Overall, very crisp, fresh and fruity. As stated before, this would be perfect on a summer day outdoors. Plus, my wife, who is not a big beer fan enjoys it alot too. Plus one for me!"
"D - Drinkability is good. This is a one-dimensional brew but the Wisconsin Belgian Red really does the cherry profile very well. The cherry flavors come through as fresh and in no way artificial. The alcohol stays completely out of the way which also helps this category out. Very nice brew from New Glarus that is easily recommended."
"D: The consummate libation to savor while enjoying a cherry-hued, Door County sunset."
"Overall: Excellent beer, and I was kind of leery of this going into the tasting. Ended up being something that I would maybe by one of on visits to Wisconsin, but this is defintely a dessert beer."
"My complaints are no real complexity (It tastes like cherries. the end.) and it could use some oak."
"D: Outstanding. If this stuff was more readily available for me I could drink it all night long. This stuff is liquid desert. An absolute treat for beer geeks with a sweet tooth."
"D - Low ABV and not cloying at all. It's a keeper. Hey. maybe I will learn to like sour beers yet!"
"Drinkability is excellent."
"Poured into a taster glass, pours a ruby red with little carbonation bubbles and a nice pink head. Smell is simply amazing but you must like cherries to enjoy, this litterly smells like fresh warm cherry pie. Taste is very similar to the smell nice heavy carbonated cherrie flavor, this reminds me of a liquid cherry candy. A bit of tart in the middle and a nice smooth finish. Overall this is the best fruit beer that I have enjoyed to date. I could easily drink a few bottles of this at one time which could be a dangerous thing. The master crafters at New Glarus really know how to make impressive fruit beers."
"Drinkability wasn't too high. I'd have a hard time drinking an entire bottle. Good thing I had a buddy to share it with."
"Overall- Delicious fruity beer much like a champaign or sparkling wine. Great as a desert beer."
"Overall, I preferred the Raspberry Tart a little more, but this is a great beer nonetheless. Very easy to drink and could drink one for dessert all the time."
"Everyone should try this beer."
"Pours a brilliant and beautiful deep cranberry color, nice fluffy pinkish head hangs around for a bit, and leaves a few spots of lacing. Thousands of tiny bubbles rising to the surface. The smells and flavors are just perfectly in sync: big, robust, tart, and rich cherry insanity. Wow. Sticky sweet moutfheel, tartness zinging the tongue and taste buds. This is just an absolute treat, and the beer drinkers in Wisconsin are extremely lucky to have a brewery like New Glarus."
"D: Pretty drinkable if you are not diabetic, I enjoy the occasion sweet, good desert beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat slick with a touch of a syrupy quality to it from the residuals sugars of the fruit I assume. Quite an easy drinking beer that the girlfriend enjoys as well. I could probably drink the whole bottle though too! The top tier of fruit beers for me and one I always enjoy drinking. Worth a trip to Wisconsin - grab some Raspberry Tart as well."
"Syrupy mouthfeel. Lighter carbonation when compared to the Raspberry Tart. The sweetness knocks this one down a rung for me as far as drinkability is concerned. Very different, yet enjoyable. I do prefer the Raspberry Tart over this one, however."
"Attractive bottle with wax melted over the cap. No dates of any kind. I sort of wonder if I got an older bottle. Read on... Pours clear cherry red with thin head that almost immediately dissipated to a thin film. Obvious sweet cherry aroma with a little sour yeast. Taste follows smell - almost like an alcoholic cherry soda but with a somewhat pleasant lingering aftertaste of candied cherries. Not at all complex. I feel like this beer could use a little more balance, maybe a little more in the hops department. I couldn't taste any as it is. Medium bodied, light carbonation, sticky syrup. Overall, this is interesting and worth a try, but I would recommend splitting the bottle between four people. Try it with something of considerable contrast like salty rye or pumpernickel crackers and mild cheese like gouda."
"Thanks to ThirstyBird for sharing. Served in a tulip. Poured a bright maroon with some light penetration. Pour revealed a quarter inch, wispy, thin off-white head that quickly dissipated into a soapy swirl. Nose was cherry Sucrets and cinnamon. Taste follows nose with some additional cinnamon heat. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium with very little carbonation. This is by far the easiest drinking fruit beer I've ever had. Extremely flavorful (without being sickeningly sweet) and low abv makes it a great dessert beer."
"I'm enjoying this. Will definitely buy again -- it's a nice addition to the fruit beers in the fridge."
"7/4/8/4/16 (3.9/5)"
"Bottle at the GABF. I feel so lucky to have tried this beer. Poured a dark red color, with a thick creamy reddish head. Smelled sweet of cherry, tart cherries not sweet ones. Tasted just like cherry pie, not overly sweet and sticky though, just the actual taste of cherry pie. Probably one of the best beers I've ever had, and it makes me sad everyday that Colorado can't get it."
"A: Murky amber to dark copper, something akin to a reddish cider, half of a finger of foam which quickly dropped, after the initial burst there are no signs of lingering carbonation - 4.50, S: Intensely aromatic of cherries, smells like a cherry pie filling, ever so slightly sour - 5.00, T: Like the nose this beer is overpoweringly cherry, a hint of champagne sparks/bubbly, beyond the cherry is a touch of what I perceive as prune juice, intensely sweet - 5.00 M: The sweetness seems to hang on the tongue like a syrup, otherwise medium bodied - 4.50, D: This is one special treat of a beer, one of the best dessert beers out there, a standout if you are a fan of the fruit beers - 4.50"
"D- Although this beer is absolutley delicious, it's certainly not super-drinkable. Its somewhat heavy and the sugar content is a bit excessive. I felt like I got a sugar rush and then crashed after half a bottle. Overall: make sure to share because one bottle is a lot for one person, but a very good beer with a really fresh flavor and smell."
"Pretty drinkable beer, but something you will mostly sip because of the big flavor. I finished the whole bottle myself, but it didn't go quickly."
"D= A world class beer for sure and deserved of all the hype. Easily my favorite fruit beer ever and one I will gladly have again and again."
"Poured into a champagne flute as recommended this brew is a wonderful sparkling ruby red with a pink head that bubbles to the top of the glass and settles to a paper thin cap. The aroma of this brew is amazing with strong cherry and a sweetness that dances in your nostrils. The taste is bold as the carbonation tickles your throat and the bold cherry flavor explodes with every sip. The tart aftertaste is a great balance of the sweet cherry taste. Even a hint of dark chocolate on the back of my tongue. What can I say, it has taken me too long to try this beer. Everyone who has pointed me in this direction was right!"
"Light bodied and it really leaves a nice, sweet cherry slick on your palate. A perfect amount of carbonation, I think if it had less carbonation it would be too syrupy. This is very drinkable, with the low ABV and refreshing quality, these go down like nothing. Bears little resemblance to your typical beer, but all around a really good brew. Easily one of the best fruit beers available, anywhere really."
"I find this beer similar to the Red and White from DFH - an interesting melding of flavors. I would consider keeping this in the cellar for when guests come around for something different as a dessert drink."
"D- I mean its not really like drinking a beer. There is little resemblance of a beer. So very easy to drink but I think I might get sick of it. This is a weird drink, but weird done perfectly."
"Overall, a truly awesome beer that I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try."
"highly recommended. about as perfect a brew as one can think of. it's more than a fruit beer; it's the nectar of the beer gods."
"Big thanks to jonstubb for this beer. Poured out in to a wine glass a murky dark pink, with lighter hues towards the top, and a small white/pink head. Smell is of fresh cherries and other fresh red fruits, jolly rancher, some vinous properties, hints of oak and wine. Flavor is composed of luscious cherries, pie crust, more oak, bits of tart funk here and there, but overall more sweet. Body is light, with wonderful carbonation that prickles the tongue ever so slightly. It is hard to believe that this is made up of malt and hops, as the fruit is so damn prevalent. Drinking this is far too easy, I could probably go through two bottles. This is close to being a perfect beer for me. If I lived in Wisconsin this would be in my fridge at all times."
"I saved this to open on Thanksgiving as a dessert beer. I half expected that this would be a cloying, sweet, syrupy cherry overload. Thankfully it is none of the above. Nice red color with lots of carbonation. Smells and tastes, as everyone has already noted, like tons of fresh cherries. Amazing that New Glarus was able to pull off a fruit beer that has tons of fruit flavor without hampering drinkability. Low abv and light to medium body plus fairly high carbonation make this chuggable."
"D - I couldn't drink this everyday, but it truly is a great drink and would never complain when I get my hands on a bottle. If you have friends who don't like beer get them to try this it should open their eyes to the versatility of beer styles."
"D: New Glarus's fruit beers are a testament to why we should all move to Wisconsin, or at least befriend someone from this great state. Already famous for its cheese, I think beer is a good pairing. I would buy this beer often and drink it on many occasions were I able to. Drank half of a bottle, savoring it all. The only thing slowing me down drinking this was making sure to savor every drop. Strong acidity is the only drawback, but no problem here as this is a perfect beer to share with friends and family."
"Huge thanks to Jeremy (drseamus) for sending this my way. This may be one of the first beers of mine that my fiance actually approved of. Definitely a must try!"
"Brewed with Montmorency Cherries (purportedly a pound of whole cherries per bottle), locally grown wheat, and Hallertau hops, the beer is then left to mature in 12 ft. tall oak tanks. Okay, great, let's get to it. Murky ruby-hue capped by a flamingo-pink head appearance and harbors an aroma reeking of unabashed cherrynicity, there's nothing fake or artificial about this beer. With a taste reminiscent of fruit leather, the flavor is certainly aggressive in it's sheer determination to cram that pound of cherries down your damn throat. It deftly walks the fine line between sweet and tart and carries with it a jolt of juicy, cheek-pinching acidity. The malted wheat and hops definitely take a backseat to the deep, strong cherry fruitiness. God, I hope you like cherries. The high level of carbonation in the beer does well to bring a much-needed levity to what otherwise would be a heavy body. You do like cherries, right? Overall, a deliciously unique beverage, though I suspect some may be left angrily shouting the catchphrase ""Where's the Beer?"""
"I bought two bottles, will let the other age a bit and hopefully the sweetness will relax a bit. Glad I had the young one, but won't likely have another till the second bottle ages 6 months or so."
"Overall: a great treat"
"Thanks to DontCallMeSurly for the trade!"
"Pours a light orange color bordering on pink, with a light amount of foam into a brandy snifter. Nice waft bright tart cherries and not much else in the nose. Do you need anything else when they use a pound of WI cherries per bottle? Taste is tart cherry, a nice base beer flavor, semi-sweet and somewhat dry on the finish. Medium bodied and oh so very tasty. Probably the best fruit beer I've ever tasted. So much cherry goodness in this one, but it's hard to drink more than one glass at a time. Perfect for dessert with a slice of cheesecake."
"I prefer the Raspberry Tart over this because this one is a little shallow to me. It is good though and I will likely purchase it again."
"Drinkability is good, limited by sweetness. As I do not have much of a sweet tooth, I would not want more than about half of one bottle at a sitting."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Perfect carbonation with a fizzy and smooth feel. Fizzy upfront but in the back nice and smooth. This beer could be drank all night long. Absolutely fantastic."
"Overall this is one fantastic brew. Glad to have tried this and sorry to see this bottle empty. I knew I shouldn't have shared this with my girlfriend and her mother."
"d: Super easy drinking. Just enough tartness to balance the sweetness. Best damn fruit beer I have ever had. My favorite beer of the night and that is saying something."
"Overall, it is similar to the raspberry tart by New Glarus, because it seems to lack some of the beer flavors. However, it is still a great beer and deserving of both its rank. I will definitely drink this again."
"Captures the flavor of cherries but I would of liked more beer qualities. The bottle goes quickly and the low ABV helps drinkability."
"A surprisingly fluffy two fingers of light tan head sits on top of a murky brownish red body. Nose is amazing like crisp suger glazed perfectly ripe cherries. Wow! is what comes to mind with first sip. An interesting combination of cherry pie filling, fruit wine and malt liquer. It is just bursting with juicey cherries and even a hint of raspberry. A hint of tartness balances out all the sweetness nicely. Mouthfeel is lush and you really cant stop drinking, so split the bottle or drinkability would suggest maybe you keep it all to yourself. I would love to see how this beer blends with a good smooth porter. So many possibilities with this one."
"Big thanks to unclejedi for sending this as part of my Powerball winnings."
"D- I will definitely drink this again. It's easily drinkable. One of the best fruit beers I've ever had."
"You can tell it's a well built beer though."
"D- Well crafted but I can barely drink 1 glass. Way too fruit forward for me. I like fruit beers a little more subtle than this."
"D- I will definitely drink this again. It's easily drinkable. I'm glad I'm moving to WI so I can have more of this."
"New Glarus Belgian Red poured a brownish reddish color. Smell was all of cherries. Very sweet nose. The taste was sweet and sour cherries. Tasted close to a Belgian Flemish Red. Not overly sweet, and a nice tart aftertaste. Mouthfeel was ok, a bit thick. Drinkability was nice. Overall a good beer. I wish that New Glarus would send some of their beer to Illinois."
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for including this beer in a very generous trade and giving me the chance to have this again and finally review it. This beer is even better than I remember it- extremely rich and spicy with laser-like cherry flavors. Almost tastes like a slightly less spicy version of a Gluhkriek there is so much spicy goodness in the beer. Pours a hazy red leaning toward brown a bit. Smells of sour cherries, cream, spicebox notes, and a slight cheesy funk, probably from the aged hops. The taste is downright magnificent. Glorious sweet and sour cherries with an almost vinous finish, a touch more of that cheesy funk, and lots of spice- clove, allspice, pepper, cinnamon. Complex, deeply flavored and long, and with a nice creamy mouthfeel that ends in a spicy snap. More proof that complex Belgian style brews can be masterfully done in the U.S. A wonderful beer."
"Absolutely superb, and worthy of the ""Belgian"" in its name. New Glarus went all-out with this one. A must-try, even for those who claim to dislike fruit beers. This one could completely change your mind."
"Although I preferred Raspberry Tart to this beer (the bright pink head and tartness in flavor gave it a slight edge), both were truly phenomenal products. Now, if they only did distribute this outside of Wisconsin."
"The appearance of the beer is simply gorgeous. A shade of brownish red, perhaps a mahogany red. Whatever color you would call it, it is beautiful and not far short of perfect. Wonderful smell, with cherries and oakiness, a touch of hoppiness and malt coming through in harmony. The taste is even better. Cherries dancing on the tongue with the smooth oakiness balancing perfectly. A touch of sourness adds some contrast as well with the traditional beer-like tastes of hoppiness and malt delicately coming through towards the end. A long and smooth finish that is about as delicious and drinkable as beer gets. Exquisite."
"Notes: My girlfriend and her sister fell in love with this, only to have their hearts crushed finding out it was from Wisconsin. Looks like another trade shall be in the works. Thanks DrDogBeer ;)"
"I consider it the best fruit beer I've ever had. A must-try for anyone who can get their hands on it."
"Drinkability: As a fruit dessert beer? Outstanding. A very impressive natural cherry flavor that I imagine was pretty tough to achieve. A completely manageable abv, as well. You gotta be in the mood for this one though, as it's definitely all cherries, all the time. Give it a go."
"Drinkability.. now, if you are someone who doesnt like beer... drink this, doesnt taste like beer at all. Would be perfect as a New Years Eve toast rather than champagne, or a wedding toast, some special occasion such as that. I could easily suck it down fast like my morning orange juice, but when i want a beer this just wont be a go to one. Give this one to your friends who dont like beer, they will like this one for sure. I will attempt to keep at least one bottle on hand, though, for occasions as above. Nicely made beer for what it is."
"This beer pours a ruby color. The head is small and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of cherries, with a ton of tartness, and an underlying nuttiness. The taste is a lot more sour than the aroma. There is a lot of cherry, some nuttiness, and a lingering tartness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a wonderful dessert beer. I will certainly drink this again."
"Look for it and enjoy."
"Drinkability: A great beer, definitely off the beaten path. Like a liquid version of sour cherry jam. Very refreshing."
"interested in trying some of this brewery's other concoctions"
"Pours a slightly hazy red with dark orange hues. 2 fingers of fluffy pinkish eggshell head has good retention and leaves beautiful lacing. Smells of sour cherries, brown sugar, cinnamon, and light bread, much like fresh cherry cobbler. Tastes of brown sugar and light cinnamon along with pie dough and a huge dose of sour cherries, with a touch of grass. Medium in body with great fizzy carbonation, almost champagne-like. Very smooth and creamy with excellent sweet fruitiness and a nice punch of tartness. This is definitely among my top dessert beers, and wouldn't mind having it every week with Sunday dinner."
"Overall- Another great dessert beer. Exactly like Cherry pie! (Thanks Scott!)"
"D : Extremely drinkable. This is one that I could have any time and have no problem drinking."
"Big thanks to Ughsmash for breaking this out at the RBSG 08 Grand Tasting. Poured into my Chouffe glass, the color of the dark end of a tequila sunrise. Solid pinkish beige head leaves streaks of lacing. Aroma is dead-on cherry pie. Flavor is cherry pie filling. This beer embodies the sweet/sour dynamic that makes cherries so good. Phenomenal dessert beer."
"I was greatly surprised to find that this offering by the folks at tiny New Glarus Brewery had the kind of national following that it does. It deserves it. Try it at least once."
"Shades of a Flanders red are apparent."
"D- a great choice served chilled on a warm summer night."
"750ml bottle. Pours a deep dark cherry red color with a light pinkish colored head. The deliciously enticing aroma is filled with cherries, not the typical artificial cherry flavoring in most fruit beers, but a really fresh cherry aroma. The taste is sweet but not overly sweet, with a good dose of cherries. Wow, this is a really great beer that I enjoyed quite a bit. Definitely not overly sweet and artificial like your typical fruit beer. Would make for an awesome dessert beer. Highly recommended."
"This beer was tasted in a wine glass from the 750mL bottle. The beer pours a hazy pinkish red with a white head sporting a hint of pink as well. The head dissipates without leaving much lace. The smell is straight cherry juice. The taste bursts forth with more cherries and a bit of tartness to keep the sweetness in check, but the cherries really dominate. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation. A nice fruit beer displaying the cherries very well. Just a bit too sweet and overwhelming for me."
"This is an unusual beer, no doubt, and perhaps too unique to return to every day. It's certainly interesting though and quite delicious. I'll pick up another bottle without question."
"Pours a murky apple cider golden brown into a snifter. Short one finger head leaves spotty lacing. Smells of cherries. Shocking, I know. Bits of caramel and spice here and there, bit the cherries almost completely dominate the nose. The first few sips are like liquid cherry candy. After a bit of warming, the caramel and spice pull out for a better balance. I kinda wish I hadn't chilled it at all. Medium body & carbonation make for a smooth drink. Too sweet to want more than one bottle, but the one is damn tasty. A very unique brew, perfect for a summer evening."
"D- I could drink this one all day long at a slow pace, not something I want in a six pack for tailgating, rather slow small glasses during a party."
"I love this stuff. It and it's raspberry brother are the best fruit beers in the world. I'll never quite understand why fruit-beer hating geeks love these as they're the fruitiest of them all...but who cares? This is GREAT."
"Tasted on 5/31/08."
"Bottle. Poured a cloudy reddish-purple color with a light white head. No lacing. Aroma is very strong with a nice sour cherriness to it. Mouthfeel is excellent as it is very smooth. Flavor is a nice tart cherry taste with a nice sour aftertaste. An excellent beer."
"D: Drinkability isn't as high as it could be because of the heavy sweetness, but that's really nitpicking. I am not the biggest fan of fruit beers, but this is, without a doubt, the best one I have ever tasted."
"Pours a deep cloudy read, with a nice white head with a slight pinkish head. Nose is of some cherry and a bit of tartness. Flavor is a deep red tart cherry flavor. Almost a spritzer type quality in the mouthfeel. A very refreshing, but extremely sweet beverage to be enjoyed for desert on a summer day. Excellent brew, one to be admired. I still prefer the raspberry tart, but this is defenitely the second best cherry beer I have ever had, and the best cherry beer of this style I have had undoubtedly. Thanks again to Dana for letting go of this one."
"D: Very drinkable."
"EDIT: After a couple years of drinking both the Tart and the Red, the Red is much better. Scores reflected."
" A classic, shame about the lack of head retention & lacing, but I'd have this in the rotation if I lived in the Dairy State for sure!"
"Appearance is hazy orange with red and pink hues. A rocky white head settles after a moment to a thin layer. Aroma has cherry pie upfront but behind that there is some nice malty notes and other interesting finds like buttery graham cracker crust and cheesecake. Flowery hops dance around the malt and cherries. Very complex nose. Right out of the gate in the taste is fresh Door-county cherry pie! What follows is an interesting mix of malt and rose-like hop flavors. Hop bitterness, however, is fairly restrained and it could be ramped up a bit to balance the moderate sweetness. I'm shocked this is only 5%ABV because the mouthfeel is like a Belgian Strong Ale. A very complex beer that you could spend all night finding new things to discover within. Don't miss it!"
"Deep yet bright ruby in color with thin lacing when swirled. The nose shows off an abundance of rotting cherries. This continued into a medium-bodied palate with lots of carbonation and crispness. While simple this is very well-balanced, refreshing and enjoyable."
"This is one of those brews that you savor, enjoy... and rue over when its gone. I have got to trade for more of this... Its too good not to have more of..."
"Great great great... and something I wish I could always have a bottle or two of stowed away. And of course... the lady loves it."
"Drinkability is very high with me though I have been told by friends that they could not drink alot if this because of the sweetness. But for me I could drink the whole 750ml bottle. I stocked up on this after my first taste. Awesome brew that everyone should seek out. Can see the ladies liken this one..."
"D: Tons of flavor for such a small beer. As a brewer this is one of those beers that toally blows my mind. How did they do this?"
"The body is hard to pin down with a moderate feel but with the sweetness that lasts into the finish gives it more of a fuller texture. Because this is so sweet it deters from drinking too much and leaves a lot of aftertaste. Overall a fun beer and must try at least once."
"Taste is tart, fresh, juicy cherries. Not a whole lot of carbonation, but I prefer it that way. Surprisingly non-cloying and doesn't get old or tiring to drink. Very enjoyable beer."
"This is a great fruit beer; just thinking about some other fruit beers that I think missed the mark (Southern Tier's Raspberry Porter comes to mind), this beer is right on. The sweetness is accompanied by a thick, full body and enticing tartness that makes me want to keep drinking."
"D: The 750ml was way too much for me. It's very tasty, but in small doses. I'd say splitting a 750 with 3 other people would be perfect for my liking. Also, it /completely/ changes as it warms up."
"I love the color of this one, it pours out a sexy cherry (really!!) with hints of mahogany around the edges. There is a medium amount of head on this one as it doesn't leave much lacing either. A very powerful tart cherry character is present. Taste is pretty much the same; a lot of tart cherries with a slightly sweet finish. This bottle had a very bitter aftertaste, which I don't recall from previous batches. Maybe my palate was off. There's a lot of carbonation to this and it's kind of similar to champagne in mouthfeel. I enjoy the hell out of this one and look forward to drinking plenty of this in the upcoming summer months!"
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew, nice sourness"
"Cheers to jw347 and scoobydank for sending bottles my way"
"Overall a good brew that I'd like to have the chance to try again."
"Since i do most of my drinking in Wisconsin, I have become a big fan of New Glarus. This Beligian red was very tasty. Nice ruby red color with a pink head. perfect tart cherry flavor, not overly sweet and not too tart. This served with a good cheescake or even a sorbet would be the cats ass. New Glarus did a fantastic job with this one"
"This is a pleasure to savor but drinks much easier than other offerings crafted at this level of excellence. Great stuff."
"D - I wouldn't call this the ultimate fruit ale...yet, but it ranks very high. It has so many flavors and doesn't hold back. It tastes fresh, sweet yet is something that can be sipped and savored for hours. New Glarus has really made a fine Cherry beer - I will definitely seek this one out again"
"All in all, you must get this beer. Great job, Mr. Carey."
"D: I could drink this stuff all day. It's fantastic. Not as sour or tart as a kriek lambic, but rich in flavor, and quite tasty. I wish this came out to the east coast!"
"Poured from bottle into a chimay goblet. Totally different look from what I was expecting. I should have taken that into consideration for the rest of the experience. They say they put 1 lb of cheeries into every bottle, I believe them. Funky pinkish hue to the beer, with tons of carbonation. tastes the same as it looks- almost like drinking cherry champagne. The smell is amazing- something out of my childhood- candy or something similar, but I cant put my finger on it. I will never drink a fruit beer and not compare it to this one!! New Glarus impresses me once again!!"
"D-Best kept quite cold. I was hoping my wife would help with this one but she doesn't like it. It's decent, and something I'm glad to try, but only once."
"Utterly sublime."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Sweet and juicy, the cherries really take over this beer; it's like liquid cherry pie. Low acidity and very mild sourness. The malt backbone is soft, barely noticeable to my palate. Full-bodied yet spritzy. A clean finish without much residual sweetness makes this a lot more drinkable than most sweet beers, but the sweetness does still become taxing after a while. One glass is plenty, but it's one highly enjoyable glass."
"Pours a hazy brown with ruby hues. No real head is produced on the pour. Aroma is nice, and fairly gentle. Notes of tart cherry, and tangy wheat. Taste is also quite nice. Tart cherry and tangy wheat mostly with a bit of a drier finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very lightly carbonated. Drinkability is fairly high as low alcohol and good flavors make for easy consumption."
"I did not really enjoy this as a beer. If it were bottled as a non-alcoholic cherry cider, I would have believed it. IMO, it was a syrupy overrated mess."
"Overall: As with the Raspberry Tart, i must admit to being overwhelmed by these brews. They are high-quality for sure as the taste is clearly natural & not artificial but not for me which is strange because i actually like many fruit beers but i guess these particular ones aren't for me. I am grateful for being able to try them though."
"Pours a rich, murky maroon color with a creamy pinkish hued fluffy head. Smell is a great big rich fresh sour cherry aroma. Thick, full mouthfeel especially for a fruit beer. Taste is slightly mouth puckering sour cherry tartness. Very fresh and enjoyable. A touch acidic and very reminiscent of a certain sour cherry juice I grew up with. Finishes with a touch of drying almost tanniny experience and a touch of barley grains letting you know this is still a brewed beer. Overall an amazingly drinkable and delicious drink that went perfectly with Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks so much Tyler!"
"Flavor is thick cherry without ever feeling like a cough syrup.. tastes very natural albeit concentrated.. I honestly believe there are a pound of cherries in every bottle... Sweet for sure.. but it is a sweetness that ties it together. Almonds show with room temperature. High carbonation works to cut through the sweeness.. I am getting quite a bit of dough and vanilla.. touches of cinnamon. I could drink this for days before getting tired.. but I do see an end of the tunnel. 1/2 a bottle was fine for tonight.. just enough to make me want another.. but I will really need to be in the mood. Moreover, it makes me want to share it with friends again. I had 3 bottles of the WBR after my trip to Madison in '06 .. I drank them way too fast with people who didn't appreciate the brew. It will not happen again."
"Poured into Rapscallion glass, formed 1"" of creamy light pink head over the murky deeply red brew. Head lasts, a novelty for many fruit beers I've seen, and lacing was good. Aroma is deeply of cherries, but the real thing, not those sickly sweet maraschinos or anything, with corners rounded with some malt presence. Taste is starts off with somewhat sweet cherries, smooths with some light malt input, and then the curtain rises on the sour, with none of the preceding overdone. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent, just as I had hoped for. Look forward to revisiting this one again sometime, for sure."
"This is a delightful beer. I think that it would be excellent served as a dessert beer or paired with a nice sharp cheese. This is excellent, I reccommend trying it if you have a chance."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, the label tells me ""You hold the marriage of wine and beer."" I'll certain give it that. Although these kind of beers typically don't appeal to me, it's one of the better fruit-infused beers that I've had and I can definitely see where, if you're into this type of thing, you'd probably really like this beer."
"The mouth is also delightful, an almost full body with a fine carbonation and slightly tart, puckering ending that nevertheless stays sweet and satisfying after every drink. Truly, this is must have for all fruit beer fans, and to so thoroughly satisfy a guy who doesn't even particularly like cherries, its just great, this beer is worth every bit its rep."
"Will search this one out again, I really want more. My wife even had a few glasses with me and she is not into beer at all."
"Drinkability - what a fruit beer. Too heavy for sessioning, but awesome for sharing and tastings."
"Great stuff, well balanced for the amount of cherries used. One of the best fruit beers ever."
"Much like the Raspberry Tart, this is just a magnificantly made Fruit Beer and hugely drinkable despite a big does of sweetness that would indicate it shouldn't be. You Wisconsinite Bastards are very lucky. Very lucky..."
"D-This is one damn fine fruit beer. You had better like tart cherries, which I do! This beer balances the fruit sweetness and sourness perfectly."
"Certainly worth a try. I don't know that I'm really a big fan of fruit beers, but this one is nicely done."
"Overall I really do not have enough good things to say about this one. Every aspect of it was fantastic and I would gladly welcome a steady supply of it into my home. It is one of those things that are perfect for a special occasion or just sitting around watching a movie. Truly unique and in a world of its own, these New Glarus beers never cease to amaze me. I must start setting up some trades for this one ASAP."
"D - One of the best fruit beers I've ever had. Perfect balance of fruity sweetness and tart sourness."
"Taste was cherry filled, sweet, sticky. Phenols make the cherries feel fake and syrupy. A thick feel to it with a small bite in the back to soften the syrup feel. A good brew, but not very drinkable to me."
"Very unique beer and a lot of fun to try, but not something I would regularly drink. I can barely identify this as a beer. Similar to a lambic possibly. I think it would be great as an after meal drink similar to a dessert wine."
"This is also more of a refreshing drink you could have all year round. There is more noticeable lacing as I consume the beer. I do not think I would want to consume a lot of this at a time as the taste could become tiring after a while but for now it is enjoyable. Tasted better with food later on."
"Prosit, und Zum Wohl. MK"
"This is an interesting offering. If you like cherries it is probably pretty tasty. I don't have a strong opinion of them either way so this creation (it isn't really beer-like) just seems interesting to me. I will say that it does have a very real cherry flavor to it that is far from artificial, or medicine-like. It's well done, just not for me."
"D - downright delectable."
"Outstanding beer experience."
"This is a superb beer. It's nice to be able to enjoy a full bottle at home, rather than the 2oz. samples I've gotten in the past at the GABF. My only complaint is that they don't distribute outside of Wisconsin."
"This brew is well worth the effort to acquire. I still this the size is too much for one person, but I had my sister helping me out with this one. Thanks New Glarus for a lambic to remember!"
"D: Awesome!!! Certainly a great fruit beer."
"Wow. This was good. Poured from a champagne bottle; it has a garnet color with a small slightly pinkish head. The beer is light in carbonation although this meshes well with the sour and sweet tastes that are imparted from the cherries. Has a tremendous and complex cherry taste. This bottle was gone way too fast."
"Pours a light pink to reddish color with a small white head. In the aroma small sour cherries. In the taste, cherry, very cherry with a small sourness lingering behind. A smooth medium body mouthfeel and a dry cherry aftertaste. Cherries feel a bit medicinal, kind of like cough drops. A small tartness, and big in cherry."
"No bubbles and hardly any no head. But the color is just a dark, cherry red. Reminds me of fruit punch and wine mixed together. The aroma is almost a buttery cherry aroma. Very unique, and still pretty funky. The taste is a medium tart cherry juice. A little odd creaminess somewhere upfront, but very quickly fades. Strong, funky cherry flavors hit the mddle hard along with a slow lasting sweetness."
"Drinkability: Very high. This is a tasty, smooth beer with a nice complex fruit flavor. Not a beer that you would drink several of but a good sweet beer to enjoy after a meal."
"I enjoyed this beer but I could probably only do one of these every now and then. Any more than one in a sitting would kill my tastebuds."
"D: So easy to drink. What an incredible beer!"
"Best fruit beer I have had so far. I look forward to trying the Raspberry Tart and hopefully the Apple Ale (2008 release?)"
"Body is medium and slick with juice. Just the right amount of carbonation. I could drink gallons of this beautiful example of beer."
"Bottom line: This is a world class brew that hits my palate on all cylinders. Like I said before I got this in a trade and it certainly won't be the last time I trade for it. Thank again, Joe!!"
"Pours a rusty looking murky red with a nice pink head that takes its time. Smells mildly tark, the cherries come out to play along with some sweetness. Taste is mostly the sweet cherries, mildly tart with a smooth finish. Medium in the mouth, flat on the finish and a sipping fruit beer too enjoy."
"Deep red body with a small white head. The body is very opaque. The aroma is outstanding. Sour cherries blast out of the glass. The flavor on this beer is crazy good. Good sour cherry flavor with a bit of carbonation which seems to make the flavor pop. Ends on a pretty sweet note. The body is a bit heavy for the flavor but it's pretty light overall. This is a great beer. If I ever get married, I'll use this in place of champagne for the toast."
"D: This was an excellent after Thanksgiving Dinner treat. This is a beer with real good balance of sweet and sour, perhaps too sweet to drink the whole 750ml bottle at one time, but a great beer to share with friends. After the first few sip I had to break out some dark chocolate just to see.chocolate covered cherries! Every trip to Wisconsin will require at least one or two of these beauties coming back with me."
"This is definitely a beer that deserves to be towards the top of the list on the Best of BA"
"Pours a reddish brown color with a creamy, and frothy brown head on top that remains for quite a while with plenty of lacing along the side. Smell is strong on cherry, and a cider type smell fills the nostrils. Taste is ridiculously sweet, with some sour tart notes finishing. Mouthfeeling is filled with carbonation making this seem like a cherry Italian soda /cherry cough syrup/cherry wine cooler. I have not usually liked the tart, wild ales in the past, this one finally works for me. Maybe I'm not a huge fan, or maybe I am finally used to this hybrid type style."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, but limited a tad because of the sweetness factor. Still blows most cherry beers away."
"Thanks to nflmvp for the two bottles of this. Served this chilled from a waxed 750ml bottle, into a tulip. Poured a murky, thisk, ruby color that had a brownish tint to it. Beer was capped off by a half inch of thin, tannish white head. Head faded almost immediately, and left virtually no lace behind. Smell was made up of mostly tart cherries. Black cherries, red cherries, dried cherries, they are all present in the nose. The taste was very one sided as well, but in a good way. All strong tart cherries. Definitely cherry pie in a bottle. Excellent tasting beer in my opinion. Had a nice thick, full, syrupy, tongue coating mouthfeel. Carbonation was right on as well. Awesome drinkability. Glad I have another bottle on hand. Another great New Glarus offering."
"Overall: Wow, thanks HimerMan for a great beer. I love it, and so does MrsOStrungT. I would always have a bottle of this if I had access to it. The only problem is that it might just be a bit too sweet."
"Pours a ruby amber red color with a thin off white head that left quickly. Smell is overwhelmingly cherries yum! Dried fruit/prune in the background. Taste is tart cherries has almost a sticky syrupy feel to it. Leaves a tart cherry aftertaste. My mouth literally was watering with every sip. Not exactly a kriek as its not nearly that sour, but a damn fine brew nonetheless."
"Sample courtesy of a travelling fellow beer lover. This brew pours a lustrous brownish, purplish red with a medium thick and fizzy beige head that dissipates steadily. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet cherries blended with other tart fruit, sweet spice, and wheat. Medium-bodied with a complex fruit character of fresh cherries and strawberries along with spices and malts. Light wheat and yeast undertones at times. The finish is richly fruity and tart and leaves a lingering cherry aftertaste. Quite simply the best Fruit beer I have had."
"For my 29th birthday, I had 48 bottles to give out to all my friends, but we could not drink them all. 4 months later... I have a 12 pack left."
"Too sweet for regular drinking, but very nice as a dessert and could be good with certain foods, maybe roasted chicken."
"This stuff is pure cherry juice. It seems less tart than before, and sweeter."
"About an inch of head. Strong deep smell of cherry. Reddish brown in color. Slightly tart. No hint of alcohol. Cherry pie filling flavor. Very good beer."
"hard to beat for this style of beer."
"A cloudy rich red color. Poured aggressively, a full finger off white head that fades quickly, light lacing remains. The smell initially came across to me as being very sweet and similar to maraschino cherry syrup. The aroma really led me to think that what would follow would be as sweet. Full bodied, the mouth feel is lightly carbonated and complemented by a cherry sourness that flows through the mouth like a syrup. Full flavored, the big cherry taste reminds me of a tart cherry pie filling. This is way too easy to consume."
"Very drinkable, I am glad I live where this is easily available."
"A cherry treat."
"D - Best fruit beer I have tasted. A great balance of sweet and tart."
"Reddish orange in color, a little lighter at the bottom...very opaque. The head is about 1/2 inch thick, light tan color. It falls quickly, leaving decent lacing behind. The major scents here are cherry and cinnamon. There is also oak and sugar with a deep spice character. The taste is much the same, cherry and oak, sherry, hops, sugary-malt, fruit juice...tangy with bits of citrus. Highly carbonated, but incredibly smooth and balanced, slightly syrupy...dry finish. This is so freaking good - easy to drink, wonderful, but not an everyday thing by any means."
"Overall: I have come across many beers that I love Westy 12 and KY Stout most notably. This one here is a whole different matter. It's pure sex in a bottle. I love this beer. The aroma, the flavor, the enjoyablity is off the scale. New Glarus, YOU RULE!!!"
"Stylistically, very well done compared to other fruit beers I've tried. Unfortunately, not to my taste. Glad to have had the opportunity, though."
"Thanks, jrdegriselles, for the opportunity and to Schmittymack, for the chance to re-visit"
"Its a bright red beer with a nice pink head that doesn't stick or lace but doesn't dissipate that quickly. The aromas of straight up cherries hit the nose right from the start. The phenols from the yeast and fruit are blended in there but make it rather nice. The taste of cherries is really strong and sweet, but balanced out by a slight bitterness. There really isn't any malt to speak of, since there are a pound of cherries in each bottle. The mouth feel has a certain fullness to it, but goes well with style of beer. All in all, a very easy to drink beer. Very sweet, but a very tasty sweet."
"Yes...yes...I love it."
"Bong Bridge. Wisconsinites are lucky, lucky lucky..."
"Its color was not as pleasant as I expected (more of a red brown than a brilliant ripe-fruit red), and aroma was just so-so, but that flavor was a big punch of flavor that I really enjoyed."
"Overall, holy fucking cherries! I'm happy I shared this with semi knowledgeable beer friends, because it was great, but also there's no way I could have drank a whole bottle. It's just too much cherries. One glass is a great treat though. Cherries."
"D - This was really good. I generally have not enjoyed many cherry brews, but this was quite good. It even reminded me of a sparkling cider."
"D - Buy this. Buy a case of it. Ages well and I doubt many people will not like it. I couldn't put this one down. There was sooo much flavor to this beer that I couldn't wait for the next sip to try and figure everything out."
"A wonderful beverage, but I struggle a little to rate this, because it really doesn't have a lot of beer-like qualities. It takes a pretty vigorous pour to get much of a head. The aroma is a hedonistic cherry immersion, and the flavor is more of the same -- tart, fresh, delicious. Malt and hops are undetectable, as is the alcohol. Actually, even a little bit of an alcohol burn would push it to a higher level for me. Recommended, definitely, but I do have to rate it in the context of a beer."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking sweet beer. Not to tart or sour. Allmost champagne-ish."
"This is a gorgeous beer. Albiet not for everyone, but I love cherries. This is the best fruit beer I've ever had. I dare someone to try to one-up this one. Good luck."
"Drinkability is good. This isn't really my favorite style. But it certainly is an interesting and very well crafted beer."
"D- im using it now as a sipping beer for a long lazy afternoon and its great, a dessert beer as well."
"D - Amazingly refreshing with no alcoholic effect, thus its quite drinkable. Not syrupy or overly sweet like most fruit beers. A must try and something I would often return to were it more available."
"I don't think I got a bad bottle, the the beer store had this one in the fridge, I just think I'm not a fan. It did look gorgeous, I've never seen a pink cascading head before. The aroma, however, just reminded me of Juicy Juice, not a fine beer. The taste was a little more complex with a mild tartness and sweet cherry flavor. I really couldn't find much depth here. I'd go back to the Raspberry Tart before this one."
"Pours a brownish color with definite red highlights. Small ivory head quickly dissipates to a ring around the flute. Smell is incredible, like opening a jar of fresh cherries. Very enticing smell. Taste is pretty much like cherry pie filling, with a lot of tartness and sourness. Not as sweet as I expected. Medium body is nice. One glass is great, but two glasses is too much. A nice dessert which is best shared with 3 friends, not 1 spouse."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full. Mild carbonation, slight slickness. A world class fruit beer."
"It's a fruit beer, so what? It tastes so good and is absurdly easy to drink. This the first beer that worries me about having my kids get into and starting a habit. So good."
"Drinkability - This is an outstanding beer. The cherry is just fantastic. One of the best beers I have had in awhile. I would highly recommend trading for it!!"
"A very well made and delicious beverage. Still, it left me wanting more, something more mouthpuckeringly sour, something horseblanketly funky to play off these amazing cherries...the clear cherry flavor recalled my enjoyment of Drie Fonteinen's Schaerbeekse Kriek. Will the capable NG brewmaster try to make a true lambic someday? I certainly hope so!"
"This beauty displays a thick ruby red hue with a thin head that dies down to a thin lacing soon after pour that remains throughout tasting. Smell is of what else, fresh cherries. The bottle claims they use over a pound of cherries in each bottle and I don't doubt that for a second. No alcohol on the nose at all, scary good odor. A bit of acidity seems to tickle the senses too. Taste is once again of what else, cherries. Starts off sweet and smooth and ends up tart and sour. I also detect a bit of bready malt in the flavor which helps balance some of the acidity. I think this beer tastes better than any juice I've ever had. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with a generous amount of carbonation bite. Drinkability is pretty good and goes down fairly easy but the acidity got to me a bit. If I could fill a pool with this beer and swim around in it, I would be the happiest man alive...I would be like Scrooge McDuck in Ducktales swimming in his coins. Well done New Glarus, can't wait for the Raspberry Tart."
"I want to be buried with this beer. Or the raspberry, that'd be fine too."
"Overall: Give kudos to a small brewery like New Glarus for creating such an unusual taste treat. It rightly deserves a place on BA top 100 list. Even if you're not a fruit beer fan, this one is well worth your time to sample."
"I strongly suggest giving this beer a try, even if fruit beers aren't your personal favorite. You will not be disappointed."
"Another insanely tasty and well crafted fruit beer from New Glarus. I have no hesitations calling this and their Raspberry Tart two of the best beers (overall, not just fruit beers) I've had the pleasure of trying. They are remarkably well made and so damn pleasing!"
"Pours a cloudy reddish/brown color, some carbonation, nice litty fizzy head, basically no lacing at all. The nose is of malts, cherries, tangyness, and slight spices, maybe some caramel. The taste is much better than I was expecting it to be, nice tangy/sweet bite, with lots of cherries thrown in, slight cinimmon, very tasty thirst quenching brew. Medium body, a nice complex brew. Very drinkable, I really like this one, highly recommended."
"I love this stuff. I could drink it every damn day, all damn day. It's damned delightful."
"O - I must say, the syrupy stickiness is a bit too overpowering and the malt a bit too under-powering for my tastes. I have real trouble trying to figure out how this ends up as the best beer in WI according to reviewers on this site. Overall, I think this has much more in common with soda (or sweet champagne) than it does beer and that's probably why it gets such great reviews. Everyone loves pop. I'm not a big fan, so I don't think this floats my boat as much as the next geek. However, it does have an amazing affinity for food and, approached from that standpoint, I find it to be quite useful and amazing. Either way, it's certainly an interesting brew and still leagues beyond most ridiculous attempts at this style."
"Thanks for sharing this Viggo!"
"This pretty much looks like a bottle of wine, and the whole red wax seal thing was kind of interesting. Poured a cloudy redish orange brown. Kind of the color of rust. Pretty big fruity smell, mostly of cherries and maybe a little hint of citrus. What little head there was dissipated very quickly. Very lively on the tongue. Both sweet and tart with a nice cherry fruit taste. Be sure to lick your lips after taking a drink of this one, because the taste you'll find there is delicious! Carbonation was just right, and the balance was perfect with the tartness offsetting the sweetness. Not sure I detected much hop flavor. Overall a very drinkable beer, which is good with such a huge bottle!"
"Pours a very murky red/brown, thick off white head forms, settles down to a think layer and ring, nice lacing on the glass. Smell is amazing, rich real cherries, very earthy, toffee, brown sugar, nice sourness from the cherries, quite amazing. Taste is cherry cake, toffee, nice sour cherries through the middle, spices, some ginger, more cherries and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is full bodied, very thick, silky smooth low carbonation. Fucking amazing beer, just insane, I can't wait to try again! Thanks Scott, I owe you for this one!"
"This beer is just a complete treat to drink. If only it was available in Ohio. New Glarus has a complete knockout here."
"drinkability is excellent. this is a truly excellent beer."
"Cheers!"
"Wow, this is a fantastic fruit beer. Once I got started on the bottle, I couldn't stop until it was finished. Truly a pleasure. Not a daily drinker, but certainly one to enjoy on a regular basis. I've never tried anything that I could even remotely suggest as a substitute."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks to my blond friend Sarah for bringing this to me from a trip home to cheeseland recently. Poured out a brownish red brick-like color with a small segregated chunky greyish pink head. The nose is cherry, sour, more cherry, a little bit of cherry, some sour cherry, some ripe cherry, some fruit punch, some super concentrated cherry. You get the idea. The taste was better balanced, but still hit you over the head fruity cherry. This is more like sucking on cherry pits with just a little cherry meat left. Not exceptionally complex on the palate, but really fun to drink. Has a slightly prickly mouthfeel, and finishes exceptionally smooth and fairly clean. Tremendously drinkable."
"D: I think that one dinner bottle of this is enough. The sweetness is pleasant in small doses but could easily overpower the taste buds."
"The bitterness/sourness in there makes it easier than most ""sweet"" beers, quite easy to drink."
" Poured from the 750ml bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. Body is a strange, opaque pink-brown hybrid with just a few wisps of creamy white head. Very sweet aroma of cherries, cherries, and more cherries, with maybe some confectioner's sugar mixed in. Palate is again thoroughly dominated by sweet cherries - this almost comes across like a soda rather than a beer. A mild hoppy bitterness emerges on the finish, but there is still plenty of residual sweetness. Body is smooth and creamy, which does provide a little bit of an indication that this isn't in fact soda. A bit too sweet for me to drink in large quantities, but still a very unique and enjoyable brew."
"D - Overall, I really enjoyed this beer...just not sure I could ever handle more than one, which sounds like it might contradict my high taste ranking. I'm liking the juicy sourness, but the fruit is more than I'm used to. That being said...it's still the best fruit beer I've ever had."
"D: Quite probably the most enjoyable beer I have had to date. Gave my parents a try and neither of them who really cares for beer both said that 1 they would go out and buy. I know if I ever get the chance to get more of this, I will stock up. This beer is a must try for anyone especially if you enjoy cherries."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle with no freshness date. The bottle has a wax seal on top and the label has a story about the beer and the cherries in it. The color is a cloudy ruby color (wife called it blood plasma). It had a small head and tons of initial carbonation that quickly dissipated. The aroma was heavy on cherries obviously and also had a noticeable wine smell. The mouthfeel was mild and went down smooth with just the right carbonation on the tongue. The taste was amazing. It had the expected cherry taste but was perfectly balanced to not be overpowering. Granted I wouldn't want to have more than one and not all the time but having this every couple months would be perfect. Highly recommend unless you don't like cherry. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"Drink-Ability: I really enjoyed this brew but I could not drink a lot of it."
"Bottle sampled with rudge75 and my friend Reid. Dark red in colour with hints of brown. Low to medium carbonation. Huge sweet cherry aroma with additional notes of vanilla, and some pale barley malt. Very large in the mouth with the cherries obviously taking centre stage, along with a bit of other red berry fruit. As sweet as it is, there are more dimensions than sweet fruit to this beer, with notes of vanilla and earth. Its smooth on the palate, yet theres enough earthy bitterness to keep things in check. Not something you could knock back a lot of, but this is one heck of a dessert beer."
"The beer pours out with a white head that falls right away. The deep red color is cloudy and very inviting. The smell is slightly tart, but very fruity. The taste is a blast of cherries, just wonderful stuff. I have had at least 6 bottles of this beer and it never gets old. The aftertaste is of slight barly once it warms up, deep down it is a beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and nice. Overall this is a great beer and I will continue to enjoy a lot of it."
"Served into a champagne flute. Poured a murky red color, slight head and lacing. Smell is hard to describle- kind of a musty sweet smell. I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer and it met my non expectations. Wow- what a different flavour! Huge cherries, with a really sour finish, but yet sweet at the same time. the sweetness seems to be like a honey flavour. Good mouthfeel and carbonation. I'm not a huge cherry, so the flavour of this beer is probably wasted on me. I due to have to give credit for an awesome effort and a very complex brew. I am very glad I had a chance to try this, but probably a one time try."
"Final verdict on this one Is that although it's a delightful brew, and would be a great after-dinner beer, I had a hard time finishing my half of the bottle because as with most fruit beers they give me some nasty heartburn. That said, don't let it stop you from trying this one, just share the bottle with a few friends after dinner, you don't need more than one glass."
"This is a perfect after-dinner or dessert drink. I could also see serving this as a wine substitute during a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. This is the best fruit ale I've ever tasted, but it's certainly no session beer."
"Surprise! This beer rocks! From pour to taste it is an unadulterated, incredibly balanced beer which screams real cherries used! I felt as though I might actually be snacking on a ripe, fresh from the tree bowl of cherries! Best of all, this is done in a very complimentary beer and yeast combination. No worst case, no fruit cooler here. Just a wonderful blend of malt, yeast and cherries. Enjoy if you can get it!"
"Served in my Lindemans flute. Pours very murkey and muddy orangy-red with a tightly bubbled creamy pinkish head. You can smell the tartness and acidity of the cherries. Very nice. Some yeastiness. Absolutly spectacular flavor. Sweet up front. Tart at the end. Slight drying affect. Full luscious body. Lively carbonation. I bet I could get in a lot of knickers with this beer."
"Many thanks to Faro for sending me this bottle in our trade earlier this fall. Murky scarlet, almost like watered-down blood with a thin dusky-pink foam cap. The aroma is almost an exact sensory replica of the scent one detects when opening a can of naturally sweetened (i.e. without high fructose corn syrup or any other goo) organic cherries; pure fruit, thick, pulpy, skins-and-all. There's a hint of tartness, too, so it's not all just a sickly-sweet mess of fruit. The flavor is more of what the aroma foretells: thick, chewy cherry pulp, intensely sweet but not syrupy with a tart, dry edge at the finish. There is little in the way of grain flavor; perhaps only a little funky tartness from the wheat malt. A small and indistinct spice note weaves in and out of the middle as well, sort of like faint cinnamon. Dry and tart on the palate; not too puckery, but the intense sweetness is all fruit and no residual sugar syrupy crap. I don't know that a cherry-flavored beer that isn't a lambic could be done any better than this. Very nicely done fruit beer, and very special beer generally speaking. This paired quite well with the vegan chocolate mousse I had for dessert tonight. My wife didn't like it too well, but she's a hophead."
"The thing I love most about this brew is that it is subtle and delicious, without being over-the-top or too pretentious. Yeah, it's brewed with a whole lot of real cherries, but the fruit is used to accentuate the beer rather than to overpower it. Perfect blend of beer and fruit, and by far the best fruit beer I've ever tried."
"Medium bodied, fairly thick for what I was expecting. Nice amount of carbonation to keep it bubbly. Incredibly easy drinking. Like I said earlier, like drinking cherry kool-aid. Truely an exceptional beer experience."
"A 750ml bottle I picked up during one of my many runs over to Wisconsin. This was a definatly great beer that I think my beer hating girlfriend actually enjoyed. It poured a ruby red juice like color into the glass. A very small developed but soon turned to film. The beer smells of cherries, naturally. But it is very sweet and tart even smells borderline oak. Tastes of huge cherry flavor with a nice balance of sweetness and tartness. There is nothing to complain about here. This is a very nice quality beer that should be enjoyed by all."
"Drinkability: You're not exactly going to drink this down fast, to be served in small doses. Definetely a beer for non-beer people, and the big fruit beer fan's holy grail, just not for me"
"More like drinking a fruit juice or drinking a liquid cherry pie than like drinking any other fruit beer. Huge cherry flavor and aroma. Only very slightly sour. Nice deep rich red color. Very, very drinkable. The perfect beer to give to a girl who says that they don't like beer, but why bother wasting such a good beer on a girl that you shouldn't be going out with in the first place."
"This is a good one to spring on someone who is not expecting to like it. My wife usually doesn't go for beer -- she was happy with this. Try it because it is different, because it is delicious. Pair it with dessert. Drink it one special ocassions. Like birthdays. Mmm."
"I could drink an entire 750 of this, and that is saying quite a bit for its drinkability considering how much I usually dislike fruit beer. But when done well, they are great."
"On the palate it is very similar to the usual Kriek counterpart but this one is more cherry-fresh tasting. The cherry component is just more ripe. Very good."
"Medium bodied. Nice dry, refreshing finish. Not syrupy or watery; just right. This ain't no kool-aid! Very drinkable, provided you wanted a cherry bomb. I thought I would get sick of the cherry taste, but I wanted more. Maybe a little too easy to drink."
"I've had this bottle sitting around since my trip to Madison over a month ago. Finally decided to crack it open tonight, and it was well worth the wait. New Glarus has certainly produced a beer like no other beer I'm familiar with. Great beer for something different and I can't imagine a better example of the style. Well worth any trouble you have getting your hands on this one."
"Great nose, great taste, but so much so that it's hard to say more than one full glass is possible. I'll certainly look for this again for dessert."
"Notes: This is a great beer because my girlfriend also like it who at other times usally described beers as too beer tasting... not that I ever understood that. So its worth a try unless of course you hate cherry then don't bother."
"Yowsa. So sweet that it is best enjoyed in moderation. I will keep a bottle of this stuff around to haul out after dinner now and then -- or as a trap to snag the ""But I don't like beer"" people."
"It's good for it's style but not really my cup of tea."
"Mouthfell/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer is well carbonated. The beer has a bit of acidity that aides in drinkability. This was a very easy beer to drink. I couldnt see sessioning this beer. If you find your self in Wisconsin make sure to find some of this beer."
"One of the true greats brewed in the US. I have had it 4 or 5 times, always in a 750ml bottle. This beer pours at a deep ruby color with a fantastic cherry aroma. This is a beer that deserves to be served in a large snifter style glass, or something similar to a wine glass. Did I mention the aroma? Very tart cherry flavor that you will want to sip and savor. The flavor is not at all sweet as some might expect when they see the cherry on the label. This isn't an everyday beer, and it definitely isn't a session beer. This is something that is great for a nice meal or after dinner."
"If you are into fruit beers at all, this one is a must...even if you are not, you should find enough in this brew to at least be impressed with its creators."
"A delicious dessert drink. The only thing that affects the drinkability for me is that it may be a little too sweet to drink more than one bottle. Well maybe two or three, but definitely no more than that."
"definitely see drinking a few of these."
"edit 1/23/07: well thanks to nflmvp, i got a few more bottles of this divine nectar, and it is even more amazing than i remember. if you do not live in the Wisconsin area, contact a BA from round there and trade for some of this. it is worth its weight in gold. try nflmvp, he always seems to be up for a trade."
"Edit: 7/28/07 Another bottle. Fuckin A-simply great. Outstanding flavor and body. Move me to WI..."
"I can't drink too many fruit beers but if I had to this would be the one."
"light mouthfeel with a light carbonation. powerfully sweet cherry taste. impressive that they can get this much sweet cherry flavor without any syrup or extract; just cherries and beer. light feel avoids any cloying, and even the big bottle was gone pretty quickly. an impressive brew, even if it doesn't quite match my tastes; with no hints of alcohol, malt or hops, i'd prefer it to be a little more beerlike."
"Champagne bottle brought back from WI for our anniversary. Thick, brownish red and opaque. Nice head turns creamy after a couple of minutes. smells like cherries and wine. Tastes like a liquid cherry pie, not very beer-y but some malt can be picked up on the finish. Texture of liquified fruit with heavy carbonation. Very nice overall. Best of the best as fruit beers go, I would say. New Glarus has the type down well...what with Raspberry tart on their menu as well."
"Well this is official not a favorite beer of mine. Far too sweet and sour this is something like over sweetened Kool aid with tobacco thrown in it. Not recommended."
"D- this is a dessert in a bottle, sip it"
"I was expecting this to be good, but I had no idea it would be this nice. I am blown away, and can't wait to try some other things from New Glarus."
"D- This beer is big fruit but it has a great amount of depth to the cherry flavor. The fruit is not to tart and not sweet at all. They have a really great balance of sugars and a good depth of complexity. Very nice beer."
"D: Perfect balance of sweet, sour and tart. Friggin amazing"
"It is amazing that anyone could capture the smell and taste of this beer. The beer is ruby red in the glass with a smallish white head. The smell is purely cherry like pie filling or marachino (sp) cherries. An amazing smell for a legitamate beer. I absolutley love it. The taste is largely sweet, and quite tart in the finish. Possibly some slight hops in there but mostly just cherries. The mouthfeel is quite creamy and good very nice. If you can get your hands on this one...try it. It is what it is and it is damn fine at that. Drink it after a big meal and you cannot help but be satisfied."
"-UF"
"It's basically a desert. Every bit as full, thick, and rich as a Framboise. And must be sipped like one. The tart aromas become mouthpuckering immediately. Sweet cherry scents come across as vigorously as a Yankee Candle. Flavors are intese cherries. That's it. It's basically cherry puree. Maybe with a little belgian beer to thin it down to a drinkable level. All the flavors are worthy of a 5 rating. I just wish there were bigger 'beer' flavors in there to ease the drinkability. Very full and rich on the palate. Another savoury brew. Finishes very sweet and tart. Great taste, just less beer-like than I wanted."
"Muddy, reddish body with a whispy white head. The aroma is lots of cherries, some sour notes as well. The flavor is moderately sweet, a touch sour, cheeries, vanilla, caramel and a hint of lemons. When the beer is allowed to warm up, a hint of chocolate begins to comes through. Champange mouthfeel, light and lively. Very tasty, but a good one to split with a friend."
"Pours muddy brown in color with hints of red and orange. Very murky and opaque. Mmm, smells like a freshly baked cherry pie. Damn, I can almost smell the crust too. Sweet cherry jam and lemon/green apple tartness aromas in there too. Taste is like a sweet cherry-apple cider with a tart finish. Effervescent-tingling on the tongue, carbonated like a sparkling wine. High points for uniqueness and although I couldn't drink many of these back to back for the fruitiness, this beer is quite the experience and and an incredible fruit beer."
"Thanks again go to badbeer for the bottle."
"Though I couldn't drink a lot of this on one sitting, it's so delicious I wanted to gulp it down, lest it should disappear before I could finish it. A tremendously tasty treat."
"Overall Impression: Burp! Wow thats good. My wife loved it as well. Great beer, great drinking. Big props to Goldorak who graciously brought this one out from his cellar. Strongly recommended! Wish it was available in Texas."
"D: Not an everyday beer, of course, but very good. The cherry flavor isn't obnoxious like in some fruit beers, but rather you get just the right amount of flavor. Highly recommended."
"Due to the sweetness, Im glad my girlfriend was willing to drink the other half -- a whole 750ml may be too much at one time."
"Amazing beer!!!! Bright hazy, reddish color, very small white head. Lots of carbonation, very little lacing. Looks like some kind of fruit juice. Fantastic smell!!! Smells exactly like fresh cherry pie filling. Yummy!! I can't believe this is beer! Very sweet and tart, a true pleasure to drink. Light and slightly fizzy mouthfeel. My first offering from New Glarus, and the best fruit I've tried so far. Only available in Wisconsin, so do whatever it takes to get this beer. You will not be disappointed."
"Reddish-brown in color. I take a whiff.... WOW... cherry! Smells like delicious, fresh-baked cherry pie, big time! Oh, and the flavor? Stunningly delicious-- tastes like the most wonderful homemade cherry pie filling with the slightest hint of spice. Can cherry beer (or any fruit beer for that matter) possibly taste any better than this?? Oh I surely would bet not! This beer is so smooth and lusciously drinkable... simply remarkable."
" Initial the taste is sweet cherry, this soon gives way to sour cherry, delicious, and more complex than I can adequately describe. Malt is there, but completely blends in with the cherries. Mouthfeel is smooth and lively, the bubbles are tiny. I believe this qualifies as a session beer under BA guidelines, if only I had another one or ten or so, I'd drink them all now."
"Pours like Champagne into flute. Murky red liquid topped by a quickly disappearing thick rose head. No lacing. Cherry aroma (duh) not too overpowering. Glad to see this. So often the aroma in fruit beers is too much. Taste was fruity with yeasty finish. Moves between sweet and sour while on the tongue. Cherry Pie in a bottle."
"A grand and glorious fruit beer."
"Notes cannot describe my complete disgust with this beer. Ive tasted it several times and I am still flabbergasted that people actualy enjoy it. I can't stand the sweetness and I dont want to taste pie crust in a fruit beer. I do love the raspberry tart though, but that is very balanced and succulent."
"I wasn't sure about the drinkablility at first, but nearing the end of the glass I was surely ready for another. Excellent..."
"Ohh my god that is the best smell in the world. Rich ripe, sweet cherries and cherry puree. It smells like the filling of an expensively made cherry pastry. Its just fantastic smelling thats all that can be said. Faded pink/light red in color with a thin white film of a head. Jeez this brewery makes increndible fruit beers. Fore is full of cherry, spritzy carbonation, mild acidic citric notes toward the finish. The middle has ever so slightly sour notes, some nuttiness and a smooth icing laden fried, flaky sweet dough flavor that carries into the finish. This really is a liquid Cherry Fritter and it is utterly amazing. This is the kind of beer that gets you excited all over again about what beer is and can be."
"Eagerly anticipated. Pours rust in color with little head. A thin ring of carbonated foam remains after a few minutes. Aroma is of cherry juice and dark red cherries. Sweetness and a slight sour aroma. First sip reveals a slightly acidic and not as sweet as I anticipated. Not as tart as a kriek. Cherry flavor remains on tongue for half a minute after sipping. Not thick and syrupy, light on the tongue. Easily drinkable. Thanks to shippos for trade. This was worth getting."
"Incredibly full wheat body. Almost chewy. Very refreshing, I could literally drink quarts of this."
"Delicious! Absolutely delicious! This is so easy to drink and just dripping with quality and care. Theres a quality here that makes me wish there was a NA version of this available to have with breakfast every morning. I think Ill never be able to tolerate fake cherry flavors ever again. This is hands down a fantastic beer! The only shortcoming on its drinkability is the sweetness. Its necessary for the flavor, but I wouldnt want to split more than one bottle at any one sitting."
"Edited from: 4.5, 4, 5, 4, 4"
"Opinion: Even though the fruit beers aren't my favorite, this beer goes down really smooth. It is a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but I prefer the fruit Lambics...especially Cantillon. I have had this bottle for about a year now, so I thought that the sourness would increase with age. I am pretty satisfied that isn't the case, so I will have to try a fresher example next time."
"Pours a murky brownish-red, completely opaque and delicious looking. As soon as the wax is cut and the bottle opened, the room is filled with luscious cherry. A closer whiff and I'm blown away by the intensity of fresh fruit - cranberry, some apple, but obviously cherry takes center stage. The flavor somehow eclipses the nose in sheer gravity. Fresh, mouth-puckering cherry and cranberry puree with some subtle hints of vanilla and oak. Mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Indulgent. Lightly carbonated. Reminded me of a fresh Door County cherry cider with a tart alcoholic bite. The sour and sweetness of the fruit balance each other nicely and make for an easy-drinking desert beer that I could see myself downing a couple bottles of in the course of an evening. It was hard to share it with my lovely girlfriend, but it's the Holiday Season. A truly magnificent fruit beer from New Glarus, how lucky to have them in my backyard."
"Drinkability -- Outstanding drinkability. This is a really impressive beer. It's so different than what I'd expect in a beer. Very good find. This would taste fantastic outside on a crisp autumn day. I plan on seeking this one out again."
"What a nice tart cherry taste with this. I could not get enough of this taste and the aftertaste that lingers in the mouth. The best part of this particular experience was giving 3 or 4 relatives the chance of trying this beer that they had never had before but now love. Too bad we are too far from Wisconsin to get this often. Thank god I have about 5 bottles of this and the Raspberry cellared away."
"750ml bottle. I really liked this beer, from the red wax on the op to the very last drop. This one pours a definite reddish color. There was some haziness to the beer. It pours with a big head that drops to nothing almost immediately. There was some champagne-like fizzy carbonation that continued throughout. The nose is somewhat like a cherry pie, just not as sweet. It was sweet, sour and tart all at the same time. The taste was really nice. Cherries were the main component. They were somewhat tart, with some sweetness at the same time. Something of a medium malt body hiding back there. Very nice!"
"Drinkability: Since it is so sweet, I don't think I could handle more than a few glasses of this... but what a pleasure to savor slowly after dinner. I will definitely buy more when I return to Wisconsin for the holidays."
"Drinkability was great - we intended to share a bottle, then move on to something else, but finished both of the bottles I had and could have emptied another if It had been there."
"This beer poured a dark dirty cherry color. It doesn't look exactly like a fruit beer but not really a normal beer either. Fizzy white head, medium in size, not really too much lacing. Aroma is exactly like cherry fruit gushers. I mean it's identical. I can't really get past it, I like it but in my beer? Taste once again has that cherry fruit gusher quality to it. Cherries aren't as tart as I expected. They're more sweet and almost taste fake. Body is somewhat thick and has a nice fizzyness to it. The first glass of this bottle was good but the second glass was tougher. Started to get cloying and too much cherry. Reminiscent of cherry juice. Sorry, I didn't care for this one."
"It smells and tastes distinctly of...cherry! Not sickeningly sweet cherry syrup like in a kiddie cocktail, but like real cherries, still sweet, but also tart. As a result, the mouthfeel has a cool puckering effect to it. This beer isn't very ""beery," but tastes extremely good--if you like cherries, of course."
"Moreover, the beer was a perfect pick for the colorful fall day. It feels very much like a homemade cider and this makes it fit naturally with changing leaves and fire pit conversation."
" These guys really get it right with their fruit beers. They seem to find a perfect balance where so many other breweries fall short. This beer is no exception. It pours a beautiful redish brown, cloudy, but in a way that enhances it, not detracts from it. The aroma is all about sour cherries. The flavor follows through with the cherry theme, with just a hint of yeast and underlying grain to remind you that you are drinking a beer. Like the Raspberry this one tastes like real fruit, not syrup or artifical flavoring. These guys take their fruit beers seriously and it shows. These beers rank up there with some of the best beers in the world, IMHO."
"Drinkability: With the low ABV and the fruit taste, this one goes down easy. I can't say that I would make this a regular occurence. It really doesn't scratch the beer itch for me at all. But for what it is, it's very well done. Recommended."
"Very complex and amazing beer. Not too drinkable for me, as I like the drier and funkier fruit beers. Nevertheless, an American Classic. Bravo."
"Drinkability is low, I don't think I could drink to much of this one, In fact finishing off the 750 I opened was starting to be a struggle."
"Just a great great beer. Without question the best fruit-based beer you can get in America. I'd take this over Lindeman's any day of the week ending in a ""y"."
"Drinkability: This all depends (as previously mentioned), on your tolerance for cherries. What makes this beer truly great, however, is that you can share it with almost anyone (yes, the boys got a wee nip and were suitably impressed) and they will generally enjoy it. That said, a little cherry can go a long way. My wife and I have done two of the 750 ml bottles of this at once, but that's about all I'd do."
"drinkability: quite tart, 1/2 a 750ml bottle is plenty"
"Pours a rich red color with a pinck head. Whole lot of lace lining my chalice. Aroma is very sweet and fruity--all cherries. Thank God not marachino cherries though. Flavor is almost all cherries, but I am picking up some sweet spice as weel and just a touch of hops at the finish. Cherries came across as pie filling very sweet and tart. The tartness clung to the inside of the mouth, but did not coat it with a scummy feeling. Mouthfeel is very full flavored. Finish is just slightly dry and some cinnamon. Very easy to drink the bottle."
"thanks to bieristgut for this. had this a few months ago. poured a nice bubble red with a pink head. aroma I know this will make bieristgut upset and maybe others but it smelled like a wine cooler, but it was good got cherries, spices, and a little bit of hops. flavor, wow those cherries come right out and grab your taste buds, like a lot of other reviews tart cheery pie. normally I am not into the high carbonated fruit beers but this one was good"
"This poured a ruby red with an off-white head that fizzled down to a foamy island in the middle of my glass. The smell was an abundance of cherries. Smells amazing. The taste is tart and with an incredible amount of cherry flavor. There is also a light decection of alcohol. The mouthfeel is good, swish it around a bit and nurse those flavors. This is a great beer to drink with friends. I highly recommend it."
"750 ml capped and waxed bottle."
"some residual sugar in the aftertaste, overall a simple brew. nothing special.. except.. well, it's totally unique."
"Really nice dessert beer, but it also maintains a refreshing quality, leaving it as a summer drink too. So nice all around."
"Incredibly drinkable. I kept coming back to get more of that cherry taste. Slightly sour."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light pink/red color ale with a huge bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of delicate sweet cherries is enchanting; I could spend hours smelling this beer. Taste is perfect with nice balance mix between naturally sweet cherries and malt. Subtle sourness at the end brings everything together for a perfect close. Carbonation is perfect for a fruit beer as well as carbonation and level of sweetness. Truly the best fruit beer I ever tasted."
"Dusty red with plenty of foam that falls to a pale pink ring. Nose is cherry pie filling or toasted cherry pop tarts. Taste is liquid sugary cherry with some carbonic bite and a hint of hops (it is a beer!). Finish is acidic from carbonation and cherry skins. Mouthfeel is medium. This is certainly drinkable, none of the tart and funk of decent lambic here, so it will appeal more broadly to most drinkers. Pour this into a footed pilsner glass with two scoops of vanilla if you don't want to drink it straight. Definitely a desert brew. Tasty."
"Not overly sweet like Lindeman's soft more deft hand at blending the Cherry flavor with the gentle malt. Smell is of Marichino cherries that are a little soured with some maltyness in the background. That is much the same but with a slightdry sourness in the finish, not like a true blended Lambic but I think the sour and dryness comes from the cherries themselves. It has a decent body with light carbonation and it is very drinkable, but it is best to share this bottle."
"I took another BA's suggestion, and mixed this with some Young's Double Chocolate Stout, and it was one of the richest and flavorfull beers I have ever had."
"Finger licking good!"
"Striking dark red appearance. Just a bit of head. One sniff gives away what this beer is all about - cherries. Real ones, and plenty of them. The flavor is a wheat beer body with cherries throughout. Not those canned cherries, not cherry juice. If the flavor was just a little more tart, and not quite so sweet, it would be perfect. High carbonation helps prevent the sweetness from becoming cloying. I really like this beer, and I don't usually like fruit beers."
"Medium bodied, good drinkability, it's a dessert beer not something you would base a session on."
"WBR seems to be a 'love it or hate it' kind of beer. I recognize that though it's beer in the technical sense, it doesn't much resemble beer in the classic sense. I've decided to judge it on its own merits with my enjoyment as the sole criterion. It's hard for me to imagine a fruit beer in general and a cherry fruit beer in particular that is more delicious than Wisconsin Belgian Red. I've waited quite a while to taste this one and I have to say that it has exceeded my expectations with room to spare."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this bottle with us. What a beer. It pours a bright red color with a small ring of pink foam around the top. Leaves some lacing on the glass as well. Very strong aroma of cherries with just a tiny bit of sourness. Nice. The flavor was unreal. Lots of cherry flavor all over the place. Slight tart character, but very slight. Love the flavor of the cherries in this one. Spectacular flavor. Drinkability is wonderful as well. I MUST seek out more of this beer."
"Wow, my 500th review. About 2 years ago I would have never guessed that I would ever try this many beers in my entire life. Oh well, here's to even more beer! I am forever in debt to Kevin (kmpitz2) for sharing this brew with me. 750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a slightly hazy medium burgundy color with two fingers of slightly pink head. There is a good deal of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very very strong, with me getting my first whiff with the glass about 5 feet from my nose. Strong notes of maraschino cherry juice (one of my faves) and just a slight bit of sourness. Amazing. The taste is full of cherry as well, and just a bit of tart flavors going on. It's very sweet as well. I enjoy it, but not nearly as much as the aroma. The mouthfeel is decently strong and smooth for a fruit beer. The drinkability is superb. I could surely drink a few bottles easily. A remarkable drink, a wierd beer."
"Reviewed from notes of a 750ml bottle sampled on 1/15/05. The bottle was dipped in red wax. About an inch of light red head formed over the murky dark red body. Some lacing was left as the head stayed in tact. Strong cherry aroma hits you first with a bit of tartness backing it. There is a slight malty sweetness lingering in the back as well. A sweet tart like flavor hits the palate first before all the cherry flavor rushes in. The cherry flavor is great in that tastes like real cherries not sweetened cherry juice or something artificial. A good amount of tartness that lingers for bit rounds this one out. About a medium body to it with an effervescent feel to it. Pretty much what you would hope for with the style. This stuff is hugely drinkable with the tartness being very present but not overpowering and the other flavors complementing each other so well. This would be a regular for me if it was local. Thanks for the bottle slander."
"I would have to say that this is by far the best cherry beer that I've tried. I certainly wouldn't pass up a chance to try it again."
"Edit: I still love this beer. So good. So balanced. A fine beer."
"Symmetry! Oh my goodness is this fruit beer balanced. Clear soda red with a thin cap of khaki-pink foam. Powerful aromas of cherry on the branch then some blossoms and finally a bushel full of aged and macerated fruit. The taste is sublime with a perfect blend of malt, fruit, acid and bitter. Yeah it's sweet, but in no way cloying as the tart and bubbles wash all that off your buds before it gets a chance to negatively root and then there is even a slight lingering bitter finish and the pull to renew. I'm not sure what critics of this beer think it should be but I think it's damn near perfect in its current form. Worth seeking out by travel or trade."
"Again I must thank Clark for bringing this in. This beer pours more of an auburn in color tan a red (which you'd expect from a beer with cherries on the label) and an whitish head. The aroma is all cherry ""fruit roll up"" as one taster put it, and a slight tartness. The flavor is very sweet, little to no malt flavor, and then some tartness. This has some body to it but there is a little harshness in the finish. Overall for a Belgian style it is very drinkable, if you like sweet beers."
"This is a truely an amazing beer. It pours a dark color with red hints of the cherries contained within the beverage. The head was more than descent and lasted long enough to enjoy. The smell was an olfactory delight. Yum, the taste was absolutely amazing: first thoughts are of fresh homemade cherry pie. While rather pleasantly strong, the sweetness is nicely balanced by the hops. This is a beer to enjoy with friends after a nice meal. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability: I finished all 750 ml of the bottle, and it was great..."
"A truly enjoyable beer. If you know about lambics and belgian beers, you'll appreciate this all the more. I wish I had another bottle!"
"This is certainly an odd beer. It doesn't even taste like one even. I'm sharing the bottle with family, because I don't think I could drink a whole bottle alone. Nevertheless, this is quite tasty, certainly the bridge between beer and wine."
"Not much more needs to be said about New Glarus' Wisconsin Belgian Red. It's easily and without a doubt one of the best cherry beers in the world. It reeks of cherries, it tastes like cherries.... it is cherries! A pound per bottle, in fact. And it's completely authentic, there are no extract flavors here! It's rich and sweet and somewhat tart. And unlike some other examples (ie. Gluhkriek) it's not cloyingly sweet or too full-bodied to be enjoyed as anything more than a dessert beer. Excellent!"
"It's really amazing that this is beer. It tastes almost exactly like liquid cherry pie. While not the deepest beer, it certainly does have appeal and character. I don't know if I'd buy it again, there's certainly no way I could drink a whole bottle in one sitting, but I'd immediately think of it when introducing people to the world of beer. I'd bet it'd turn a few people into good beer."
"Thanks to Chip (faernt) for the chance to try this long sought after gem. It was as good as I had expected!"
"Thanks to trbeer for this gem."
"Mouthfeel is nice and rounded."
"What a beer! Big bottle with wax opening into a champagne flute with the aroma of Door County. A pie crust colored head appears and grows to colossal size on top of a slightly brownish red body that looks like cherry jelly. The taste is sweet and then tart bringing me back to chopped cherry preserves on toast. It's like breakfast. The mouthfeel is lighter than expected but if it were heavier the jelly thing would take over the experience. This is a very drinkable beer. I don't like fruit beer much but this is always on hand."
"Poured a copper, amber color with a small slightly off white head and some light lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet fresh cherries. Taste is sour cherries, alittle yeast, but the cherries are extremely fresh! This was not sickly sweet artificial syrup taste. Hey, I may need another one of these"
"Notes: Excellent, almost perfect."
"Smooth, rich and bold in the mouth, I'd call it a medium-light body. Goes down easy, probably too easy. Try and drink one alone and you'll feel sorry, and lonely. A top of the line fruit beer who definately deserves its reputation. Pair it with a nice chocolate dessert or another rich sweet, but I'd say having it with cherry pie would be going overboard."
"The beer itself is quite sweet and refreshing, though reasonably viscous with a medium body. As a beer I might not have to much respect for this one, but it is damn tasty and a perfect desert beer. Has a sour, tart, fruity, tannic-cherry stone thing going on. The aroma is so intensely cherry, it is quite wonderful. I am gonna have to say that this would be much better, more authentic, if they had used a beer such as La Folie as the base beer. I really can't get over how intense the cherry flavor and aroma are. This is certainly quite an experience. As a desert it is a 4.6, but unfortunately my biases and prejudices come into play."
"Bottle 8.3 years later asnd just as good."
"Well this is very sweet, but damn, one can't help but help it and anyone who hates beer would love it. Just decadent pie flavor with restrained oakiness. My only complaint (severe judging) is that the acidity could be more pronounced as this is extremely sweet. It tasted like it was baked.. spicy with vanilla notes. And a ""wow"" creamy velvety body with a surprisingly above average carbonation, biting actually. Legendary beer from the world's best non-lambic fruit flavored beers brewer hands down. Thanks again Nexxus."
"I like pie."
"Ah, yes: 200 review time! What better way to commemorate than with a top 50 brew (one I know I like at that!). Shared this with my girlfriend Sus over our Valentine's Day dinner. Was this fine concoction a suitable aphrodisiac? Why yes it was. Poured a muddy, ruby red with a small off-white head. The smell of rich, fresh sweet and sour cherry pie just pours off this beauty. Amazing! How did they get this to not smell like cough syrup (like SA cherry wheat)? Taste is...guess what? Yep cherries. Sweet at first with a pie crust maltiness. Sourness kicks in and finishes nice and tangy. Delicious. Nice bubbly mouthfeel (think cherry champagne), that I could drink more often than I can afford to!"
"Appearance: Pours a deep murky ruby red pink grapefruit tone with a nice white pink tinted head leaves nice fine evenly dispersed lacing nice and intricate. Aroma: A full on flail of cherries nice tart and sweet with a candy like tone to it, but what makes this is the creamy edge that surrounds the fruit bouqet. Taste: A parfait dessert like tart cherry tone very sweet and creamy, just so good. I am by no means a fan of fruit infused ales but this Wisconsin bred cherry beast is definitely a winner definitely based off of legendary Belgian style ales lacks some of the farmhouse and woody cask aged flow of a Cantillon but delivers something a Lindemann's isn't capable of. Mouthfeel: A fuller bodied creamy textured heavenly dessert beer. Drinkability: I just polished off a bottle and I didn't think I was going to drink it all, but once I started sipping on it the bottle emptied into my snifter faster than anticipated it was excellent, not ready for a second but extremely satisfied."
"Huge thanks to tavernjef for the trade."
"Wisconsin Belgian Red was served from a wax sealed 750 ml bottle into a champagne flute. The beer was a lovely orangish-ruby hue, and murky like fresh unfiltered cider. Topping this off was a fine and ample whitish head, which left excellent lacing. It looked beautiful in the champagne glasses. The nose was curious and seducing, with notes of fresh tart cherries and cinnamon spice. I don't believe I have ever experienced such a marvelous combonation. The peak of enjoyment came with the flavor. The beer starts with a massive sweet and tart cherry bomb, hitting the palate with tingling fizzy delight. This sensation smoothly transitions into a semi-dry finish with delicious lingering flavors of cherry and subtler winey cinnamon. All of this is perfectly balanced but charged with life, with perfect carbontion and a sleek mouthfeel. The tartness level was much lower than a kriek, but in this case was just right, leaving me completely satisfied and ready to drink another bottle of this if I had one. This is a phenomenal fruit beer that completely blew me away. Endless thanks to ngandhi for ""deliverating"" this into my possession."
"A fine accomplishment from a fine brewery. Even better than the Raspberry Tart, as the cherry seems to fit the beer much more. Simply fantastic, and one I'd give to someone who didn't much care for beer. Thank you to Bighuge for the bottle."
"Murky, opaque red liquid topped by a moderate cream colored head. Aroma is very much like cherry pie filling, with a noticeable sweetness. Taste is also much the same, but with a sharp tartness on the finish. This beer is so acidic on the finish it tasted more like strong cherry lemonade at first. Even after 40 minutes of sipping on this, I still get occasional chills from the sharp bite on the finish. Every once in a while, a slight medicinal bitterness comes through, only to get smacked into submission by the sourness. Mouthfeel is good, with a medium body a supple carbonation. Drinkability is average. It seemed to take me forever to finish this beer. While I'm not trying to question the ingredients in this beer, it just tasted somewhat artificial. I don't know why, but to me it just does. It's interesting, and I'm glad I tried it."
"Cool artisial green bottle with red wax seal over the cap and neck. Murky, dingy reddish-brown color. Pink tinged beige rocky head. Fades to a nice thin sheet over the beer. WOW ! is right, incredible full, fresh cherries. Earthy, stems, skins, the whole damn thing in there. Unbelievable aromas. Taste is tart, sweet, and chock full of fresh cherries. Liquid cherry pie. Sweetness shines more that sour, although there is a sharp sour after-taste that finishes up, but doesn't distract. Full cherry taste is every sip. Tight full carbaonation. Medium to light bodied, but more medium. Very good, either as a refreshing guzzler or a sipper. Wow an impressive beer and a treat to be sure. Thanks to bditty, I think this is the last beer of our blockbuster trade last year."
"Pretty ruby red color surprisingly long lasting head, cherry vanilla aroma and then it goes downhill. A taste so sour you could never serve it with food, if it had been a little thinner, sour cherry might work, but this had a thick texture. Maybe if you pour a very small amount, you could work with this."
"The color on the pour is a deep black cherry red with a Brobdingnagian sized head that is semi-creamy in texture, the color a light tan tinged with red and as it evanesces the lace forms a thick and clinging curtain to obscure the glass. Nose is that of ripe cherries, and sweet malt grains, tart and crisp, fresh an appealing like homemade bread fresh from the oven. The front is ambrosial, loaded with malt, the top rich and full, what a treat. Finish has a meaningful acidity with the hops present and delicate in their spiciness, cherry sweetness and flavor carries to the somewhat vinous and dry aftertaste, what a Hoot, and once as with Lambics I shunned this style of beers. Thankfully Ive had a reclamation and now see the errors of my ways, and thanks to tavernjef, another opportunity to sample a great beer from a great brewery."
"ng"
"thanks to feloniousmonk for this one and the other beers he helped me to sample!"
"Pours a deep burgundy hue, prety spritzy at first, but the head dissipates quickly. The mouthfeel is fuller than a typical Belgium kriek. Upfront there's some tartness, followed by an intense burst of real cherry flavor, almost like a baked cherry cobbler. Finishes with a surprising flavor of spiced plums. A really fantastic interpretation of a classic Belgium style by an artisanal American brewery."
"Looks like a liquid cherry! A beautiful, cloudy red beer with a pinkish head that won't give, except for some lacing. Smells predominantly of cherries, obviously, with some spice. Even though it really does not taste like a beer (is there alcohol in this? if so, you can't tell) it tastes wonderful. Sour spice and, again of course, cherry. Very smooth on the tongue. Delicious aftertaste that lingers for just the right amount of time. Once it's gone, you want another taste. Very drinkable, all of it's strong qualities make it so, but the fruitiness keeps the drinkability from being perfect."
"Well-carbonated and lively to start, it loses a little punch as you drink it. It's not bad -- just different from its initial feel. What starts as a lively lambic feel drifts to the Dutchess, which is hardly a bad thing. Just interesting...a mouthfull of red satin sheets. Nonetheless, it's very drinkable. It's sweetness limits its drinkability a tiny bit, even for someone with as big a beer sweet tooth as I have. Highly recommended, though."
"A cloudy orange red looking ale with an initially towering head that subsides rather quickly to a thin disorganized layer of froth. Outstanding aroma of whole cherries with a touch of cinniman in the mix. Has an almost full body witha tart crispness to it.Flavor is sour and crisp with a big cherry flavor and a dry mouth puckering finish. Wasn't sure what to expect with this one but am extremely pleased. A very flavorful ale and paired nicely with my gorgonzola and chicken salad."
"Another great beer from New Glarus. Please search this one out!!"
"Another brew that lives up to its hype, this kriek-style ale pours a deep red/amber color with a frothy, sparkling wine-like pinkish head. Very impressive looking in a flute glass, this one leaves trails of lace. Smell is tart and almost acidic at first, with some true fruity sweetness coming through thereafter. Taste is similar, but totally unlike any Belgian kriek I've had. Big, monstrous cherry notes hit the palate at first, with a dry, tart and acidic finish. The best way for me to describe it is like cherry pie filling. Cherry pie as in that which your mother would make, not Hostess. Wow. Very complex and if nothing else, divine. Mouthfeel is prickly and effervescent at first when chilled, then somewhat syrupy when it reaches room temperature. Moderate in alcohol, somewhat sweet, somewhat tart, but overly satisfying, this Belgian-style ale drinks incredibly well. Would pair incredibly with the aforementioned cherry pie as an appropriate dessert brew. Better yet, enjoy it by itself. An awesome creation from New Glarus."
"A huge ‘BigDog’ Thank You to fellow BA xlperro for being extremely kind enough to share it with me. It was very much appreciated, & proved to be an excellent start to the days beer activities."
"Reddish (purple?) brown and cloudy with a pinkish cotton candy head. Resembles many mass market fruit Lambics. Good cherry aroma, not at all artificial but with an accurate sense of sweetness and sourness that you taste in real fruit. Some yeasty bready notes, as well. Flavor is very well constructed macerated cherry with skin in a very natural tart state. An accompanying bit of wheaty grain makes for a nice velvety mouthfeel and well matched sense of astringent drying for the finish. Much better than over mass market sweetened Lambics and American fruit Wheats. An overalll winner (still a little too sweet), I am still hoping against all odds that New Glarus one day sells on the other side of the Wisconsin border."
"Overall I find Belgian Red more of a special occasion dessert beer than anything else. For me it is a bit sweeter and fruitier than I normally like. If I could change anything it would be to make it a bit tarter and a wee bit maltier."
"573"
"Great fine carbonation scrubs sourness away at the end of the incredibly long finish. A lick of the lips results in waves of sour cherry echoing across the palate. A tremendous beer."
"A well crafted brew to be sure, but one I can't see myself drinking all too often. I will keep the other bottles I have for special occasions though, since they are no longer available outside of Wisconsin."
"Origianlly sampled 7 October 2002. This baby has a beautifully complex nose of cherries & cinnamon. The flavor is chocked full of cherries. It has a very nice red color. This beer is a great thirst quencher w/ its cherry sourness. A very nice example of a sour ale."
"Yep, liked it. Extremely fresh. Soft texture, with a wonderfully lightly tart, soft, natural cherry sourness. Never candyish, always natural (except the aroma kinda smelled like lollypops or soemthing). Mix the cherrys in with some light oak and mayne some nuttyness. If i had one complaint it would be that its not assertive enough (more sour, more stink), but hey, the balance couldn't really be any better right? Thanks Feloniousmonk for this truly classic beer."
"Reddish brown color, hazy. Small to no head. Aroma is cherry and malt. WOW.. AND I DO MEAN WOW!! I had this beer several years ago, and while I had no notes on it. It tastes exactly the way I remembered it. Medium bodied. Intense cherry flavor, sweet, sour and tart. There is some malt sweetness as well as hop spiciness as well. Complex and intense flavors. Extremely smooth. Not very beer like, closest style might be a lambic?? But, who cares it tastes amazing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is clean and sweet. World class beer."
"I love this beer! First you have to consider the elegant packaging... the green 750ml bottle, the red wax, even the label is classy. Then you pour... aroma is a blast of fresh pie cherries. And the color, a hazy beautiful dark pink-red complete with a light pink head which fades quickly. Taste is a refreshing, sweet-tart, complex sour, acetic, cherry flavor. Not for amateurs! My friend and girlfriend didn't really care for it and they gave me theirs. She said the tartness and carbonation reminded her of the inside of Zots candy. More for me! Just one drop of this beer is loaded with flavors. Medium body with a medium, brisk, carbonation accentuating the tartness. I look forward to trying it again at the GABF."
"From tiny flower on a tree to a ripe red fruit for use in this wonderful brew, the cherry has not been featured quite like this before. The whole cherry is the star here, skin,fruit,pit, probablly even stem. Poured into a rounded glass, it's the color of ripe cherry red with a very pink and creamy thick head. The aroma is bursting with ripe whole fresh cherrys, pits and all- nothing artificial about it. The flavor follows suit with a sweet and tart whole fresh cherry flavor with a toasted oak finish. It is medium body holds a very rich but refreshing drink. The carbonation is mellow not bubbly, allowing the complex cherry flavor to stand tall.It could have hit a ""5" in taste with a little more malt in the backround but I'm not complaining. This is good stuff !! This isn't what you may have had in other fruit beers, this is unique- try it."
"Wow...this was perfect, and I felt that the 750 ml wax finshed bottle was a bit stingy! Hook me up to a keg of this stuff!"
"Taste is a heavenly nice sweetly sour and tart cherry thats easily smooth and a bit like a fruit juice or wine cooler but much nicer flavor. It's medium body and generously carbonated with a huge sweet feel in the front, then just lays down smooth and slightly drying to the finish leaving a great sour tart bite in the back of my mouth. Take a cherry lambic and lighten it up a bit and here ya go, a very interestingly, very drinkable treat of yumminess."
"750 ml bottle, capped coated with red wax, pours a deep reddish brown in color that has a big head that doesn't last, sweet, fruity cherry aroma with a sweet and lightly sour taste of cherries, very carbonated on the tongue, finishes clean and fruity."
"Hazy, cherry red with a slight tawny influence, white head, reached about a ¼ inch before it faded away, soapy remnants, some sporadic spotty lace. Powerful cherry nose, very real in aroma, lively an underlying hint of yeast/wheat can be found, doughy as well. Surprisingly balanced, equally tart as it is sweet the cherry flavor dominates but with faint hints of dough and wheat. Surprisingly dry, cleanish finish with a pleasant aftertaste -- alcoholic cherries. The carbonation is perfect. Wisconsin Belgian Red is truly mouthwatering good. Purchased in Madison, WI."
"Pours a hazy, red-amber with good off-white foam that leaves nice lace down the glass (a flute, in this case). The smell was very pleasant: cherries, citrus, and a hint of spice. The taste was sweet and tart cherries with a little hint of cinnamon. Not too sweet, not too tart. The mouthfeel was creamy with medium body and moderate carbonation. This was a very nice and refreshing cherry ale. I enjoyed it very much. I can see why this is an award winner."
"I kind of liked the bottle. Label even looks kind of old fashioned like a early 1900s european wine ad. Hazy medium red w/ ok head. Aroma is big fruity cherry and floury wheat. Big juicy cherry up front, tart finish. Very active carbonation tingles the tongue and complements the cherry acidity nicely."
"Pours a cherryish,hazy dark brown with a head that is quick to come and go. Aroma is intoxicatingly filled with cherries and a underlying sweetness. I was hoping this would not be nearly as sweet as the Lindeman's kriek and was quite pleased to find out it is the opposite. Cherry and sweet flavors lay on top of what is a quite pleasing sourness. The sourness does just enough to make sure that the beer does not end up tasting to much out of whack. A great feat by the brewer. Drinkability is a little low due to the intense flavors on this beer."
"This is the perfect beer to replace wine at the dinner table with Thanksgiving Turkey. Or great to share with a loved one on Valentine's Day. Wisconsin Belgian Red is an ale that's meant to be savored and enjoyed. Perfect for special occasions, and holidays, yet it's great beer to have on hand and serve anytime."
"Pours a hazy brownish red with a reddish white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is awesome. Smells like a Cherry Crisp fresh out of the oven; tartness of the cherries mingled with the sweetness of the brown sugar and cinnamon. I could sniff this one endlessly. Taste is dominated by cherries, but a wonderful balance between sweet and tart has been struck. Medium mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Drinkability is maintained by the balance between the sweetness and tartness; my 750ml bottle was gone too quickly. While I'd still prefer a good IPA or porter overall, this is a very good beer that is excellent within it's style and can make for a nice change of pace."
"This is a nearly perfect example of what craft brewing can produce, given the skills of an expert brewer, the use of exceptional local ingredients, and a daring to try something unique. New Glarus deserves all the awards they have received for this tremendous ale."
"This is by far the best fruit beer I have tried. Pours red...cherry aroma...high carbonation. The sweetness and carbonation give a great mouthfeel and I love the sour tart finish of the Door County cherries. I can't image getting any more cherry taste in this beer. Good with chocolate too."
"For a while, I had heard how great and unique this beer was...the many awards...the constant critical praise, etc. Now that I've tried it, all of it is fully deserved. In true Belgian style, it stretches the bounderies of what beer is and can be. Objectively speaking, this is one of the best brews I've ever encountered."
"Easily the best fruit beer I've had (along with it sister, Raspberry tart). This will now take the place of champagne. I am glad I revisited it."
"Big, huge thanks to Bighuge for the bottle!"
"Mahogony/cherrywood color...bubbly lace...smells of cherries(surprise)..great aroma...heavy cherry taste with a hint of brown sugar..tart finish...if you want a fruit flavored beer this is it..a CLASSIC....nice carbonation keeps from tasting syrupy."
"Luscious cranberry-like red hue.  Unbelievable aroma.  Great cranberry/vanilla sweet smell with quite a bit of cherry too.  It's a sweet aroma, but not a malty sweet aroma.  Fruity sweet.  The taste is exceptional.  Woody, vinous, dry and of course, loads of cherry.  This is one of my all-time favorites and it never fails.  Every time I have had this, it has been exceptional.  A true classic."
"Beautiful dark tan with a hint of red color, bursting with cherry aroma. Taste of tart cherries, balanced by the sweet malt. Better than a cherry wine."
