3.94,-3.9,3,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it was very fruity just as I expected, but the it still had a little bit of complexity to it and that made for a pretty tasty dessert beer.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, a little refreshing, not too acidic, not overly sweet, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, a whole bottle might be a little too much for me, but a couple glasses of it would be nice.  What I like the most about this beer was that it wasn't overly sweet and it was a little complex.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it just wasn't a great looking beer.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes cherry beers.  All in all I liked this beer, I was expected it to be overly sweet and it wasn't, I really liked that and the added complexity was nice.  This made for a good first impression for this brewery and it's one of the better cherry beers I've had.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Jan 20, 2015"

4.4,7.3,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dark amber-ruby color. Dense haze blocks most light.  Sweet cherry aroma. Fresh cherries hit the tongue right away. Mostly sweet and only mildly tart. Almost no hop character. Just the slightest hints of wood in the finish. Extremely well balanced. Medium bodied and somewhat sticky from the sugars. Sharp, snappy carbonation adds a dryness to the finish to contrast the fruit. I am not a huge fan of fruit beers but everything is so well put together in this one that I just can't put my glass down. This would be a great beer with just about any dessert, especially those made with chocolate or berries.","bnes09","Oct 14, 2014"

4.5,9.8,,,,,,"2011 vintage from bottle. Pours deep reddish brown with a fluffy white head that has a reddish hue to it. Smells very strongly of cherries with a hint of other dark fruits and earthiness in the background. Taste is very tart cherry, hard to describe as it is a strong taste of cherry but mellow at the same time, there is some darkness to the taste too in the end like plums and figs, but the cherry is the star here. The mouthfeel is way above average for a fruit beer, it is very smooth and creamy, not highly carbonated; a great aspect of this beer. At first I was worried that I picked up a 3 year old fruit beer, but this came out very well, the cherries toned down and some of the Oud Bruin came out, simply delicious!","wonothesane42","Oct 03, 2014"

A vigorous pour generates a small head on top of this dark, ruby-tinted beer, but it quickly disappears--hard to give it a fault there, since lambics often have side-characteristics that make head retention difficult. The aroma offers plentiful sweet cherry aroma, with a moderate tartness. So much for the hope of a real lambic. The taste offers moderately sweet cherries, with a pleasant tartness. It might be a little drier & less sweet than the Liefmans kriek, but I haven't tried any in several years, so not sure. It's not bad, per se--there are certainly sweeter lambics.

4.03,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a medium bodied reddish brown with bright red highlights and a barely pink one finger head. It really does look like Goudenband mixed with a Kriek. It smells of slightly tart cherries, cream, and it has a nice cherry pie like sweetness as well. It could be confused for a light Kriek. The flavor is of sweet cherry pie with ice cream or whipped topping with a barely tart finish. It is very flavorful and really does draw you back in for more. The sweetness is well maintained and the tartness is ever so slight but they work well together. It doesn't drink as sticky as it could, which is a good thing. It is medium in bodied and drinks really well. I've been told that this one is ""really, really sweet"" but I didn't think it was too sweet at all. I consider it well balanced and I really enjoyed it. I love Goudenband and this one isn't too shabby at all. I highly recommend trying the Cuvee Brut.","aasher","Jun 07, 2011"

The aroma was overwhelming with the scent of cherries and a definite sour or tart odor. It tasted moderatley sweet with a strong cherry flavor in the beginning then became a bit tart with a nice sour finish. Mouthfeel was light in body and dry in texture with a very fizzy carbonation.

It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Ovearll this was a pretty nice brew. Definitely had a great flavor profile going on here.

Tart cherries within a blend of oud bruin and Goudenband. Excellent blending here tart cherries with hints of wood aging, mild soft oak. Flavor is so balanced with tart cherries/with a brown aged ale going strong underneath. Big bold tart cherries, aged sour brown ale blends, bring out layers of complexity. Not a candy sweet cherry, real tart cherries oak aged notes with a mellow breadiness. Tart lactic acid hints of yogurt but not so sour that it turns your stomach.

Aroma is mostly tart and sweet cherries along with some wood, funk and vinegar.
