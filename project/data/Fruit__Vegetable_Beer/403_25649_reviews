"Light bodied, crisp, moderate carbonation, easy to drink."
""

"Fruity.  A great Spring or Summer beer you could drink every day."
"I don't like drinking more than one of these at a time, but it's a decent enough beer.  The apricot flavor doesn't taste contrived and the residual sweetness is more apparent than real.  I could see this as a refreshing hot weather beer."
"This is an overly sweet fruit/vegetable beer that is just too much for me. It's only suitable for drinking very sparsely. I didn't really like it but a lot of people do."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost like a dry apricot cider. Nose is sweet. Taste is less so but still very fruity. Not a subtle apricot. It is very much there. If you like apricot and lighter beers you will love this."
"Nice Apricot smell and taste. This would be a great beer if it wasn't for the horrible bitter aftertaste on the backend."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer for a summer day by the pool. Easy to drink with a light apricot taste and a smooth finish."
""
""
"VERY fruity. The apricot flavor is a bit overwhelming. Not terrible overall though. A bit hinting of banana and belgian-y yeast flavors."

"This was my first fruit beer and it has remained delicious all these years"

"Overall, not a bad beer, jut not anything to go bonkers about."
""
"Smooth and delish"
""
"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is not a very good beer."

"O: I think it is a good fruit beer. It tastes exactly what it is supposed to taste like. That being said: this is not a beer that I would gravitate towards. However, I have learned that having a beer party where there will be several people who are not beer drinkers or women that are not really beer drinkers; fruit beers are a must. I would have this one on hand then."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy orange color. Smell is pretty much all apricot as expected. Taste is similar to the smell, fruity taste. No bitterness or hop presence detectable. Fair carbonation, crispy after taste. It's a little better than I expected it to be, not bad for a fruit style beer."
"Overall, Worth it. Please enjoy one and think for yourself."
""
"For some, it might get too peachy after a while. It also might be a little too carbonated for some (it feels a little like Mountain Dew, at times). It's really purely subjective if either is too much, or just right for you."
""
""
"On tap in Omaha, NE. Frosted mug. Hazy amber orange appearance. Head stayed for a little while. Smelled like apricots and sweet malt. Maybe a touch of seltzer. Went down exceptionally smooth. Mouthfeel was buttery and smooth, ended refreshing. Just the right amount of malt and sweetness. Almost everything was right here. Definite apricot. reminds me of apricot candy without being artificial or non-beer like. Great beer on tap!"

" This beer was decent for what it is. I almost feel like I'm drinking a wine cooler as they have removed any characteristics of an beer from this. You can taste beer but I would liken it to the most ultra-light beer you ever had. Not bad drink but I expected a beer."
"12oz bottle with no discernible freshness date. Sort of hazy yellow, lots of lacing but a filmy head. Aroma is mild apricots and wheat. Flavor is wheat and mold apricots, easy to drink but really falls short in comparison to Dry Dock's apricot ale. I'd take that beer over this one every day of the week."

"Pours a hazy golden orange in color and really doesn't head a head at all. Some very light spotty lacing was seen but not much. Perfect carbonation. When first opened the aroma of fresh apricots hits your nose right up front with some wheat. Very nice! The taste was even better with just the right sweetness with good wheat to balance out the flavor. No bad aftertaste and goes down very easy. Available year around."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours to a thin white head that lingers as a ring around the tip of the liquid. No lacing. Aroma is apricots and clean American wheat ale. Flavor is of course fruity and slightly sweet but with a sharp bite of wheat to balance the sweet. No significant hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and slightly ""juicy"". Overall impression (see above)."

"O: Meh. How many different ways can you say 'chick beer'?"
"Overall- A delicious summer beer. My only complaint is the carbonation needs to be a little higher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer works if you like apricots, beer and are brave enough to think outside the box, that the two together might actually be flavorful. I say well done Pyramid. It makes me want to try your other offerings!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like apricot chapstick. Mouthfeel is weird and acerbic, hard to get past the chapstick though. Cannot recommend to any but the most diehard apricot fans."

"Overall â€“ This is a brew big on apricot flavor with much less of else taking away from its center stage presence. Rather tasty and refreshing and a good go to if you feel like something apricot or fruity. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Was a nice change from the usual beers that I drink. The apricot aroma was nice, so was the flavor. Not sure that I would go out of my way to buy or consume this one."
""
""
""
""
"I really like this beer. It does taste like apricot but it's not overly sweet. I like that isn't a hoppie beer. For me I don't care for a hoppie beer. My friends and I have had this beer with baked cod and steamed California mix veggies. We have also drank this with Mexican foods. For me it cleansed the palate well with foods. Tonight we had it with pecan crusted tilapia and asparagus very nice with both."
""
""
"O: This wasn't a bad beer because the apricot flavors seemed natural and not syrupy or artificial. I wouldn't mind trying this one again."
""
""
"I think most people seem to prefer bitter beers so they rated this beer down. I can't drink real bitter beer (like IPA) so I found this refreshing. This is a solid apricot beer, no complaints. It's not too fruity either, pretty balanced, with a medium-light body. Some reviewers felt the aftertaste wasn't good, I disagree I feel the aftertaste was fine. Just shows that taste isn't universal. Great for a spring/summer day."
""
""
""
""
"For its style, I love it. Great on a warm, yard work day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had it on draft before and I'd probably a cold one on draft will get a half a point boost in every category."
""
""
""
""
"A well done fruit beer, easy drinking and refreshing. I see this as a good fit for a warm summer day spent outside."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am a fan of this fruit beer, and I usually don't like fruit beers. Although I love apricots, and this has a very natural apricot flavor. This is a nice change of pace from the average wheat beers out there, and a really great spring/summer refresher. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O=Honesty, I was a bit disappointed, but enjoyed it...I would try again on tap, during the summer."
""
""
""
"Blech. I love apricots, but this beer is far from it. The aftertaste is very near the point of being downright nasty, and the beer really has no redeeming qualities. Stay away from this one."
""
""
"Overall it's very enjoyable, although not the best fruit beer I've had. I would not be disappointed if I bought a sixer of it though, it would all get drank!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"nothing special here, just a decent summer beer to bring to a bbq. i can see non-craft beer drinkers liking this.. so i guess it may be a good gateway beer."
""
""
"Pyramid makes a good hefeweizen. I would recommend picking that up."
""
""
""

""

"Pours a cloudy lifeless orangeish color. Looks like fruit juice, a few shades darker than orange juice. Zero head present. Nose is full of citrus, orange zest, and apricot. Very fruity with absence of any malt profile. The taste is more of the same with heavy candied apricot character. Not much else going on than carbonated orange and apricot juice, this borders on malternative territory. Mouthfeel is thin and well carbonated. Overall, the flavor isn't bad per se, but it certainly isn't good for a wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is like the smell...too much so. The high sugar levels make the liquid thicker. The carbonation cannot overcome the cloyingly sweet flavors. The aftertaste is like peach cobbler. Not my style."
""
"Overall not very good, but not as bad as I expected... lots of fruit but it's all fairly syrupy fake tasting, light carb doesn't help, and sticky sweet kinda icky feel brings the bad beer back to where I expected it to be."

"Poured this fruit beer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a hazy orangish color, produced a decent off white head, below average retention and left little lacing on the glass. The aroma of this ale was full of fruity apricot and peach- Light in body, this beer had a base of malted grain, sweet apricot and peach nectar. There is a somewhat of a sour , medicinal taste that is not well balanced. The aroma of this brew is quite appealing, packs a very nice punch but the apricot flavor does not follow the lead. Thin, watery- This beer could be much improved with a bit more body and apricot flavor that matches the aroma."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of strong apricot, slight pale malt, slight wheat, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of apricot, slight wheat, hint of pale malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, decent body and blend, but the appearance is very weak."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I go back and forth on how I feel about this one ... Clearly it's no Aprihop as the apricot line of beers go and the smell can overwhelm ... but I like apricots and kind of like drinking this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was pretty bad. All apricot, no beer. Is there a demographic that will drink it? Yes, definitely, so it will probably sell fairly well. The wine cooler crowd will undoubtedly eat it up. This is the ultimate ""bitch beer," if you'll pardon the expression. There are far better fruit beers on the market. This one just left me feeling gassy and bloated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As other have noted, very little head was produced from the pour. Color was a hazy orangish-amber. Nose was redolent with apricot to the point of perfuminess. Mouthfeel was slightly watery and the taste of apricots was prevalent on the tongue. Finish was likewise like liquid apricot preserves. Meh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good, light beer for the fruit beer drinker or for someone that's getting into the craft. Otherwise, it's disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer as a summer/hot weather drinker. The apricot is not overly sweet and has just the right tartness. I'm glad they kept this one unfiltered like traditional wheat ales."
"Overall - this is a great seasonal drinker. I will have to try more pyramid products to see how I enjoy them."
"Overall - I'll give this a good rating because they made the beer well, although I would not drink on this. Way too sweet.."
""
"This apricot ale pores a dark yellow color with a modest cap of foam above. The aroma reeks of apricot. This high apricot flavor continues in the flavor. The mouthfeel is quick and smooth, but it is apricot all the way with this thing--there is very little else to it. If you like apricot, this beer is for you. If you don't, you won't make it through the bottle. For a fruit beer, a fairly average stab."
"O: In all honesty, not a bad beer, and I'm not one to give much breathing room to apricot ales. The 5.1% ABV is sessionable for what you'd expect from a fruity wheat and the apricot flavoring isn't as overpowering as Ithaca's version. Not the best in the bunch, but not one that I'd automatically pass on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Full of apricot flavor, but could have used some other flavors to balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O â€“ A nice fruit/wheat beer. Probably wouldnâ€™t rush out to buy it again as they arenâ€™t really my thing, but I drank this on a 101 degree Arizona day, and it did refresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent all-around, but the sheer sweetness of the apricot can wear on you fast. Not sessionable, unless super fruity apricot beers are your thing."
"Not a bad brew. The apricot went a bit to far. It masked all the flavours this beer could have had. An average beer."
""
"O: a change of pace: more like a lambic than a 'typical' ale. Fans of Magic Hat #9 should definitely give this a try."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy peach body with a thin yellowish head. Nose is bursting with apricots. Wow this thing is an apricot bomb. Thin crisp and light body. Some grainy husk flavors lie below the apricot. Apricot presence huge throughout. Drinks more like an apricot cider than a beer though. Cool and refreshing and beats out magic hat #9 for sure. Some spicy orange rind flavors give some balance on the finish but its a sweet beer. Not cloying though."
""
"Overall: A pretty interesting and tasty take on a wheat beer. Nicely sweet and fruity without becoming too sweet. A good easy drinking beer for the summer."
""
""
"Murky apricot colored ale with a sheet of white. Smells like a cheap american weisssbier knockoff with a hint of sweetened apricot juice. Flavor is watery and empty. Some apricot hints and plenty of plain wheat flavor. Brutally thin and with lower carb and a semi dry finish. This beer is poorly conducted."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's rare to find a beer this good. Wow, damn,....gnarly... this beer is both refreshing and nourishing feeling. It's got a lively moderate freshness feel. Chatoe Rogue Single Malt Ale is the toppermost of the poppermost, but Pyramid Apricot Ale is its slightly mellower Apricot cousin,... and it's superbly balanced, not too sweet, not too bitter, but lively and fresh. Btw, the bottle and six pack just labels it as 'Pyramid Apricot Ale' unfiltered wheat ale. No mention of 'Audacious' is listed."
""
"Overall this is one of the nicer apricot wheats I will def look for this again."
""
""
"O: Would be a good warm weather brew between the fruit and the lighter mouthfeel. Not amazing but not bad, drinkable and I would go back. Personally not very familiar with wheat beers but I like this."
""
""
"O: a little too fruity and one sided, a good beer for people who don't like the taste of malt and hops though"
"Overall I'm not an apricot fan so maybe this beer just isnt for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good, straight forward, sessionable beer. It's what you would expect."
""
"O-Overall this is a decent ale of its kind. Not my style though so I will probably pass on another one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"- Nice to get back to this beer after so long, and after so many other new various craft beers. This still holds up as one of the better craft beers of all time in my opinion. Perfect spring and summer brew, and one which I think could still be used to get a lot of people into craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a 1 inch foamy off white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace slide into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, subdued apricot, and some buttery aromas. Taste is the same with the butter coming through on the finish. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer. It's decent for what it is but I wouldn't get this one again most likely."
""
""
""
""
"Wow. This has wonderful apricot flavor. It doesn't really feel like a wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: Decent drinkability. Fair price ($4.00). Limited quality. I remember liking the bottled version a lot better; perhaps the keg lines are dirty."
""
""
""
""
"mmm! pours a slightly blurry peach color with a diminishing white head. smells like fresh ripe apricots from the farmers market. beautiful aroma, punchy and sweet/tart. taste matches, fruity for sure, but more refined than say a magic hat number 9. fruit dominated but there is a hop presence somewhere back there. mouthfeel is weakened by the overwhelming fruitiness that sticks to the teeth, wouldnt maybe have 5 of these, but its an excellent pint. one of the better pyramid brews ive had, cant get over how fresh the fruit is in this, like a centerpiece not an afterthought. its really good"
""
""
"overall - a decent refreshing fruit beer, sessionable, nice on a hot day, crisp"
""
""
""
""
"O - Fruit beer is not exactly my thing. This sort of tastes like beer, but it also sort of tastes like sweet apricot juice. I suppose it's right on for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What an interesting mix. I love some fruity beers but often I can't drink too many as they give me sugar-induced headaches. When I drank this Apricot-flavoured beer, I was amazed at how smoothe it was - if I didn't know any better, I could have thought it was a cider, it was so smoothe. Very delicious, crisp, and light, without being overly sweet (but sweet enough to ensure you know you're drinking something fruit-based). I enjoyed, and would definitely enjoy this again - preferably on a beach on a hot day somewhere in the tropics."
"Not good. Does not taste like beer. Unless you are into sweet, fruity drinks, avoid this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very refreshing and pleasant beer; nothing knocks your socks off but it is pleasant with just the right amount of apricot"
""
""
""
""
""
"I wish more people would make Witbiers with fruit instead of the usual spice and peeling. At the same time, this Pyramid beer would benefit from a little Belgian yeastiness. It's cheap, it's available, it's better than a lot of fruit concoctions, so enjoy!"
"O: A solid choice among fruit beers; quite refreshing, but with the tartness keeping you craving more."
"O - I didn't like this beer much at all. Very doughy smell and flavor; The apricot was overpowering and almost imitation tasting"
"Pours cloudy gold. Muted apricot notes on the aroma with a matching flavor. Itâ€™s sweet, with a nice apricot finish. Call it another â€˜gatewayâ€™ to craft beer. Simple enough, it delivers on what it promises and does it well. Real easy drinking, this one."
"D - The apricot perfectly compliments the beer as a whole without being overpowering. I think the beer as a whole could be built better, but is a good stab at a fruit/wheat and is one I'd have again."
"Overall: I thought this was decent when I had it at the brewpub across the street from Qwest Field in Seattle. Unfortunately, I do not feel the same sitting in my bedroom in Illinois. This beer is a dud. I get the artificial apricot thing first then a bad wheat beer."
"Overall Drinkability - Does what it sets out to do, I suppose. Otherwise, a very unimpressive and uniteresting beer. Might make a half-decent gateway beer for people used to being under the assumption that beers are either flavorless (BL) or absurdly hoppy (many IPAs). More like a very watered down mixed-liquor drink than a beer."
"Pours a clear orangish color with a small head that dies down quickly. Aroma of sweet apricots and some sugary malt. In the taste, very sweet, sugary apricots, alittle wheat malt flavor, and finishes cloyingly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and syrupy. Overall, if you like sweet beer and apricots, I could recommend this one."
"I've noticed eBay has a lot of the keg handles for the beer up for sale. Maybe this is falling out of favor with people. Hmmm."
"I wouldn't buy this beer."
"O: I usually don't dabble in the Fruity beers, but I was pleasantly surprised with how refreshing this one was."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the wheat with some apricots. Somewhat one-dimensional and not that impressive. The flavor is is more of the same. Other than apricots and wheat there is nothing else going on. I guess that is what you get from a beer named Apricot Ale. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"It is the color of an apricot, it smells like someone crushed a bunch of apricots up and put them in a glass and drinking it tastes like drinking apricot juice. There is no subtle to this beer, yet it works for what it is. There is nothing special about it, but for a one off drink on a hot day or as something to give a non beer drinker it works. Just don't expect anything but apricots."
"Poured from 12-oz. bottle into a pilsner glass. Looked similar to Pyramidâ€™s Hefeweizen - gold and a bit murky. Had about Â½-inches of head. Good-smelling beer full of apricot, peach and maybe dates. Sounds like a pretty good Jolly Rancher flavor. Plenty of flavor in first sip. Apricot is the first thing that comes to mind whether that is the case or not. Seems to be a terrific summer brew, but not something youâ€™re going to order all night at a bar. Really a good combination of not too wheaty, not too fruity. Fairly carbonated. Pretty good beer overall. I donâ€™t know if I could stick to this all night, but itâ€™s a nice beer away from the norm."
"Flavor is mild and wheaty, sweetened with apricot flavoring, that reminds me of scratch & sniff stickers of all things. Slightly sweet but not overwhelming, allowing some of the grainy wheat notes to come through. Light to medium bodied, mellow carbonation, some mild astringency. Nothing too exciting here, a flavored American Pale Wheat, simple and somewhat artificial, though probably a good gateway beer for the craft novice."
"This poured out as a hazy looking golden color. The head was foamy and white. The aroma is very strong with apricot and rather inviting. The taste of the beer is fruity with a nice apricot and wheat finish to it. The mouthfeel is light, perfect for the style. Overall it's a very fruity beer but since that's what they want then it's great. I enjoyed it."
"Another Bliss-ful tasting, this time focusing on ""Summer beers"". This one pours a mostly clear golden straw topped by a finger or so of ever-so-slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, flowers, and fake peach. I suppose the peach could actually have been apricot, but it certainly seemed more like peach to me. The taste brings nothing new to the table, and the ""apricot"" flavor not only comes off as more fake, but also more armpit-influenced. Boo. The body is a hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I was not a fan of this beer. In fact, no one at Bliss was. I can't imagine why..."
"Pours a very solid two finger head into a wheat glass, the head is completely white and very pillowy and creamy. It's hanging around for a bit as well, not skimping away too fast, it's leaving pretty good lacing as well. The body is pretty impressive (considering some of the wheat beers I have had lately) it's very very cloudy, and there is not much visibility coming through this beer at all, it is a really solid looking wheat beer. I'm shocked at how well this head is sticking around, I really am. The carbonation looks about medium-high, maybe too high, we'll see about that. The color on the body is slightly darker than a traditional wheat beer, but held up to the light it looks standard - a cloudy orange. Overall I'm really impressed with the way this beer looks, the head has finally died down, but it gave me a lot more than most beers do. I've had this beer before and I don't remember it looking this good, I'm close to giving it a 4.5 on appearance, but I don't think it's quite there. The smell is very simple, fresh apricots and a little wheat, not much in the way of malts are hops, if there is much in here it's not noticeable. The smell is very nice and it smells very refreshing, pretty one sided with the apricot, but I don't think I'll mind, it smells really good. Well this is a thousand times better than I remember it being, maybe it's just because I haven't had a wheat beer in a while, but this is really hitting the spot. There is a slight cheap beer taste to it, but other than that it's pretty dang good. It's just really really really tasty and refreshing, maybe slightly over powering with the apricot, but I don't mind that much at all, it's a fruity beer, just like it should be. Not much in the way of hops, maybe a tiny tiny malt note in there. Overall it's really simple, but very refreshing and easy drinking. Mouthfeel is good on this beer too, I could tell by how cloudy it was that it wasn't going to be skimping out on the wheat, and it really didn't! The mouthfeel is full and the body is big and full of wheat, carbonation is not too big, a little on the high side, but it works in the beer. Drinkability is through the roof on this beer, it's tasty and refreshing, and only 5.1%. I'm not a huge fan of Pyramid, but this was a really solid beer. Not much else to say, tasty, refreshing, good fruit beer!"
"O - Not bad at all. Pretty sweet and very easy to drink. I can see this being a nice and light summer time drink. I might actually seek out some more."
"Overall STILL impressed with how this one can deliver great fruit taste but still have a solid wheat and lemon taste of a weizen. Even though it's a bit warm from the drive and old (had a nice bit of sediment in the bottom of my bottle) it still drank pleasantly. Can't wait to try there Haywire Hefeweizen."
"D- This beer surprised me. I'm not usually a fruit beer fan as it generally tastes and smells too fake. The aroma could be better, but the flavor was surprisingly enjoyable."
"Final thought - this is a must have for the category"
"Overall- Very sweet, easy to put down, but have never tried to enjoy more than one. I would say this wouldn't be an issue but I would certainly get tired of this Apricot taste all day. Much better than their Haywire beer! I would recommend this one and will enjoy again at a later date!"
"D_Extremely drinkable. Big fruit flavor hides the 5.1% ABV very well. As refreshing as any beer I've ever had."
"Plenty of apricots make it through to the taste and some grainy wheat tang also comes out to play. I could do with a little less sweetness, maybe a bit more crisp on the end would be nice. I do have a soft spot for fruit beers, and this one is plenty enjoyable and fairly unique. Makes a good summer brew for outside consumption."
"Overall, they make this beer for money, and the new branding shows. People will buy the packaging."
"8/10"
"D - This isn't bad beer, but it isn't a great beer. It's kinda in the middle. Pyramid doesn't botch the flavors, but they're too strong to be natural. Overall, the wheat beer underneath all the flavor gets lost. What saves the beer is the color and mouthfeel. If you're looking for a peak of apricot, you might be better off just knocking back a few Magic Hat #9's."
"Overall- Not my favorite style, but as far as fruit beer goes this is a pretty good one. I'll probably buy it again eventually."
"Overall - very drinkable a decent brew. Not complex at all, but good-tasting and nice body."
"T: If nothing else, it's ridiculously easy to drink. Goes down like candy. Taste-wise, it's not exactly at the top of the class but it's not pond scum either. Light body and mouthfeel and a lot of apricot flavor. To me, it feels kind of watered down, but not to the point that it destroys the beer. An easy beer to drink, but not one I'd particularly want to drink a lot of."
"D: it's a fruit beer, so i got exactly what i expected from a beer labeled ""Apricot Ale"". big apricot flavor over a light, unfiltered body. definitely a good summer day drink."
"The sweetness lingers on the palate, reducing the drinkability factor."
"Overall a decent fruity brew with a nice wheat feel, a great beer for those days relaxing on the deck in the summer..."
"D: too sweet to drink a lot, but for a 1-drink beer, it's fairly good"
"D: With it's rather low carbonation, I found this beer to be highly drinkable, and had drunk two and was considering another when I realized I may ruin my dinner appetite."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2001) - this used to be called Pyramid Apricot Ale. Pours to a hazy pale orange with thin white head that disspates quickly and leaves no lacing. While I don't particularly care for apricots, this had a very pleasant fruity aroma that hit me immediately and stuck through most of the glass. Unfortunatley, this was by far the highlight of this beer. Mouthfeel was thin and slightly tangy, although it seemed artificial. Likewise, the apricot that was so prevalent in the nose was lacking in the flavor, and what was there seemed to be medicinal tasting."
"If you like hefeweizens give this a try. If you like flavored/fruity beers, also give this a try. Overall I think it is a well executed beer. Not my favorite, but still pretty good."
"D: I'll admit, wheat beers and similar styles aren't usually what I prefer, but this one works pretty well. Fairly pleasant flavor, the crispness, and the lack of overwhelming alcohol make for a rather drinkable beer. Not bad."
"It is one of the better fruit beers. Just can't drink a lot of it. Only so much fruit beer a man could handle."
"Picked a six pack up in a local supermarket beer section. Personally I am a big fan of wheat ale of any kind. This one had a nice apricot aroma and was very good. Smooth and great flavor. The carbonation was right on and the drinkability overall was above average and pretty much as expected."
"This beer pours a clear, bold, gold color with no head or lace. The aroma is mainly apricots with a bit of dough thrown in. It's followed by a strong apricot flavor with some malt sweetness and a faint taste of apricot wine in the finish. It has a medium mouthfeel and drinkability is only limited by the strength of the flavor which might be overpowering after one or two. Overall Audacious Apricot Ale is a good beer and very refreshing. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly refreshing and enjoyable, albeit simple."
"Drinkability-I wanted to like this. But, it's simply awful to me. The fruit taste reminds me of artificial chemically produced fruit flavors and it hangs in my mouth far too long. I'm having a hard time remembering a beer this unpleasant. Someone must buy it or they wouldn't brew it, right?"
"Pours a hazy golden color with a hint of orange and small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is STRONG apricot. It smells like a fresh opened bag of dried apricots...which isn't a bad smell, just not sure how its gonna taste in beer. Trying to get other aromas, but all I really get is the apricot. Taste is initially a bit tart, then followed by TONS of apricot flavors. Theres a hint of wheat flavor, but not much else...very one-sided beer with almost zero complexity. Much more like a wine cooler. Mouthfeel is quite a bit over carbonated. Very fizzy and reminds me more of a wine cooler. Drinkability is not very high. This beer is not absolutely terrible, but I could definitely only drink one of these. I have a feeling my girlfriend would love this beer, cuz it doesn't taste like beer at all."
"Pours a pretty orange yellow color with a hazed tint and thick soapy white head and tons of lacing. Smells of tons and tons of apricots and some wheat. Tastes a little like apricots with plenty of sweet malts and a little hops to round it out. I noticed some strong sour notes upfront as well but they seem to mellow out with each sip. To be honest it really tastes pretty much like an wit with a little hit of sourness and some faint hints of apricot. Not a bad beer, just not a ton of apricot flavor like they would have you think. Mouthfeel is medium with a high amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty high. I could take a six pack..."
"To me there isn't much in the way of drinkability. This might as well just be alcoholic apricot drink. No beer flavors here. Some people will like it, I don't, but I can't really say its all bad. I would just rather have a beer that tastes like beer."
"D- The beer is drinkable. That's about it. If you like apricot then you want this. If you don't like it well then I would stay away."
"D: As fruit beers go, this one pretty drinkable."
"Pour a moderate golden color with a bit of apricot (surprise!) coloring. White head and some mild lacing. The nose is light apricot and peach and light grain. The taste is very slight wheat and a bit of apricot. The feel is light with good carbonation. Overall, there really isn't too much to this other than light fruit, but it drinks well, especially in the warmer months."
"Pours a cloudy golden color color with a 1 finger white head. The head remains for a short while, then recedes to a thin foam on top of the beer. Smells simply of Apricots and Wheat. The taste starts with the apricot, then you taste the wheat and almost has a sour finish. This beer is sweet, but not in a sugary syrup way. Some of that sweetness comes right from the wheat. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Overall, pretty drinkable beer, I'd like to try more fruit beers before I come back to this, but I'd consider it."
"To me the drinkability was hindered by the predominence of the apricot aftertaste, which though dry, prevented resonance of hops and seemed a bit artificial. Quaffable, forgettable...but something a little different."
"D: It's the best fruit beer I've had to date, but that's not really something to write home about."
"D: Not as horrendously sweet as I remember, but still approaching that level. I don't really know how much of this I could drink."
"Drinkability and taste often go hand in hand, and this is the case here. Barely able to finish it."
"At first glance and glug - a fairly one-sided affair, to be sure - ya gotta like the apricots to like this one. OK, once past that, this beer shimmers with the fruity balance of the sweet and adequately acidic, almost fruit wine-like in its bearing. Good stuff - once again, if you're suitably acclimated to the guest ingredient."
"D - Yum"
"I usually don't like fruit/vegetable beers but have stumbled on 2 fairly good ones lately. Long Train Blackbeary and this one. The key to both is that they are understated in the fruit department. The weakest part of this beer is the appearance. You only get a head with a very hard pour - white and bubbly, but it fades almost immediately. No lacing on the glass. The color isn't bad- it is after all apricot!! The smell is aromatic, primarily apricots. Tastes pretty good. Apricots predominate but there is enough beer here to cut the sweetness with a bit of finishing hops. Mouthfeel is rich enough for a light style. Drinkability is not bad. It is refreshing and the apricot is understated enough where you could drink a few."
"A good girlfriend beer. This is well made, just not for my tastes."
"Bought this one for my wife, who was looking for an easily accessible apricot beer. Poured a medium orange color, with a good finger of rocky white head. Fairly potent and artificial apricot on the nose, as well as on the palate. A little malt, but mostly apricot. Drinkable and somewhat refreshing, especially when it still 90 plus outside."
"d-not sure i'd go for it again. but worth trying, i suppose. for a bigger macro, not terrible. good enough summer beer."
"For what it is I will say this is a good beer, but I will likely not buy it again."
"I gotta say I dont mind a good fruit beer but I had a real hard time with this one. Luckily it was just part of a sampler pack so I didnt have too many. Pours a murky yellowish orange with thick creamy head. Smell was of fruit, presumably apricot but I dont know because it smelled really fake and syrupy. Taste was about the same. Honestly it reminded me of eating a kids cereal. It had that fake fruit flavor to it. Didnt really notice too much else, couldnt get past the sweetness and syrup. Mouthfeel was fine, no complaints there. Overall a beer I wouldnt revisit again."
"I can see where this might be a good and flavorful beer. This was flatter than Ally McBeal. It was like drinking watered down fruit juice. I think I picked up a bad bottle. Will try it again."
"Pyramid Brewing Company--Pyramid APRICOT ALE--Unfiltered Wheat Ale--Refreshingly Unfiltered Apricot Ale--Malt Beverage With Natural Flavor--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 5.10% ABV. 10 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) Foamy lacy thin head. Cloudy apricot amber orange color. Big sediment pellicle. Delicate Apricot wheat ester front. Mild sweet slightly cloying gentle apricot flavored malty wheat body. Balanced mild fruit citrus clean smooth end. Well made mellow fruit wheat. Sampled 9/19/2010. 2 Bottles purchased for $2.50 each @ Ken's Market--Phinney Ridge, Seattle on 9/15/2010."
"The taste is all apricot, not much else going on. Hints of wheat at the finish, but this is a no-questions-asked fruit beer. As I drank more, my mouth got accustomed to the harsh sweetness, but trust me when I say this beer isn't for folks looking to get into fruit beers."
"This is a great fruit beer to drink on a summer day. Very drinkable and friendly for those who only prefer the macro-lagers. I am not a big fan of wheat ales or fruit flavored beer in general, but really enjoy drinking this beer. If you like the taste of apricots, you will love this beer. Only apricot flavored ale that I would ever purchase on occassion. I have had this numerous times at the Brewgrass Festival in Asheville, NC and it is usually well liked among our group."
"This is a very non-threatening beer. It definitely gives what it advertizes although perhaps a little too much. Almost overwhelming in the apricot area, it does have some good wheat and hops in the background. It's very sweet, almost as if it were part juice which is why one is more than enough for me."
"D - This would not be my everyday beer, and I probably will not try it again, it was too sweet and artificial tasting. However for those of you who enjoy fruit flavored beers you might find this one to meet you fancy."
"Orange to copper in color. Large bubbles of prickle that are pretty active. Malt and fruit hits the nose with hints of the apricots lingering in the nostrils. The initial attack of the beer is fresh and fruity. There is a strong presence of the apricots that presents late and hits the palate like a syrup. The finish is still relatively clean despite the high potency of the fruit flavor. There is a slight aftertast that is reminiscent of peach schnapps."
"Drinkability: This is a slightly above average fruit/wheat beer. It's very drinkable and quite refreshing on a hot day. I wish there was more depth of flavor to it but, hey, for what it is, it's not half bad."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. Fruitiness is rather heavy-handed, but it definitely delivers what it advertises. One of these in the middle of a session on a hot day might do well to break up the monotony."
"D - Good to try, but not a lot!"
"If you like apricots you will love this brew as it has the most intense taste in that department I have ever encountered. Smell is strong of appricot as is the taste although it does kind of end a bit lighter then I would have hoped, in fact almost watery but the first contact with the tongue is sweet appricot, it goes down with no struggle."
"Worth drinking for the aroma alone."
"While it was an interesting beer, I doubt I will get it again. There wasn't much going on with it other than the overpowering apricots. Great for summer months if you just want to kick back on a sunny day, but just not my cup of tea."
"D - Eh, easy to drink, just gets too sweet, I wouldn't drink it again."
"I honestly wouldn't want to drink more than one of these. At least I can say I've had it, but this beer is pretty awful."
"Pours light hazy orange with a full head that dissipates quickly. It holds a strong apricot, lemony smell maybe a tad bit of a lager yeast smell as well. The taste is sweet semi artificial tasting apricot flavor with a lemony bite. The yeasty taste of a lager is underlining it. The sweetness cools out in the end because of the mild yeasty taste and is not to overbearing. This is a good beer to get if you see it on sale and you're mowing the lawn. Nothing amazing but it is light and refreshing."
"D - I could drink these all day ling sitting in my Adirondack chair on my back porch looking out into the foothills. A great Summer beer."
"This beer taste on lager attributes. It pours an off orange with a white head. It smells of fruit, sweet ester, and a lager yeast almost. The taste is a bit watery with an upfront ester that fades into a drawn out lager zest. It has a mouth coasting sweetness to it like a soda and wasn't particularly kind. I am sure the ladies love it but for a BA it wasn't a great experience. I was let down."
"I poured this perfumed beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a big white head that was gone real fast. The beer was also very cloudy. The s,ell was soapy like some kind of apricot chick soap. way too much apricot fake tasting stuff going on here. I will not ever try again."
"Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale pours a finger of creamy foam over a spritzy, slightly cloudy orange brew. Massive carbonation delivers a clean wheat and apricot nose. Hints of vanilla behind the fruit remind me of those orange sherbet push-ups. Flavor is fruity up front falling away into nutty, crackery wheat, with a peppery note off the back. Mouthfeel is round, creamy, and soft. American wheat ales are pretty neutral on their own, but they do make for a nice canvas for other flavors, especially bright assertive ones, as with the apricot in this case. I do like these vaguely Leroy Neiman inspired labels Pyramid has been bringing out lately. Many thanks to the delightful Anj for hooking me up with some!"
"D: This beer didn't do a whole lot for me. Apricot is certainly a unique fruit to pick, if nothing else. Goes down easily enough. Perhaps a good fit with a warm summer's day."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkablility is fair, but I wouldn't buy this beer again."
"This is a sweet, simple, easy to drink fruit/vegetable beer. The head dissolves to nearly nothing in a few seconds (like diet soda) and produces no lacing whatsoever. Perfume-like sweet apricot highlights the nose, which is similar to the flavor. Hop presence is nearly nonexistent, but some malts do show up near the end. Overall this is a mild sweet beer which a dominate apricot flavor (though this is not over-powering). If you like milder beers, give this a try. I would drink this on a hot day in the summer to recover from a hard game of ultimate Frisbee."
"D- This honestly reminds me of cough syrup. Not appealing and not worth the money."
"Overall, I think this would be much better if it didn't have that artificial taste to it. Maybe it's not even artificial, but it sure tastes that way and it's a turn off for me. Still, a decent brew but not one I would cross state lines to specifically seek out."
"O - This is one of my favorite fruit beers. This beer is not for everybody, but if you like sweet apricots and beer, you cannot go wrong with this one."
"i didn't particularly like this apricot ale, but at least the apricot flavor wasn't over the top like many fruit beers out there. i would recommend it if you love apricots. if not, skip over this one. this being the third pyramid brew i've tried, i have to say i'm not very impressed."
"It's about as substantial as I would expect a flavored beer to be--thin, light, and refreshing, although it has a sticky aftertaste (corn syrup?). The carbonation is pleasant. I suspect it would be a pretty good beverage if they turned down the apricot."
"d-wouldnt want this again ever.."
"Drinkability: Excellent apricot flavor. This is sweet without being overly sweet and a nice fruit beer. I could have three of these, but a six would be a bit much."
"A little bit of false advertising...far, very far from audacious"
"The apricot assertiveness definitely limits this one's drinkability. Unless you're really into apricots, this is pretty much a one-bottle deal. Good every once in a while, and refreshing, but simple, really sweet, and not very subtle."
"I found this beer well-crafted. Not a stand-out, but enjoyable to drink."
"This was a different beer for me and definitely a welcome excursion into fruit/vegetable beers that I don't take very often. The fruity notes were not overpowering, but not too subtle to not give it character. The nose was very floral and piny, perhaps a combination of the fruit sugars and hop aromas. I wouldn't mind kicking back with one of these on a nice night out."
"Give this beer a shot, pretty appealing in my book. I buy it occasionally when it is on sale, just an easy drinking tasty fruit brew."
"Drinkability: A good BMC conversion beer. I like it. Would be nicer with a bit more apricot punch."
"The Audacious Apricot Ale maintains an ABV of 5.1% and given all of the overwhelming apricot that is present both in the smell as well as the taste it is quite muted. Though it might have been in theory crafted to be a good session beer ideal for the summer time, I cannot think of one reason as to why I would ever go back to this beer again."
"Awesome drink. Buddy and I were at a bar in DC and I saw this as one of the selections , and told him we had to try it. Were both glad we did , it was everything I wasnt expecting , and so much more. And to think I just wanted to try it for the sake of just wanting something out of ordinary and new."
"Has a lightly sweet and short finish on the apricot but a decent full body vs. what a witbier base might yield for example. At about half strength when mixed with Haywire, there was a subtle apricot nose and flavor that allowed the wheat to participate as well. By itself it's still decent but like most fruit beers, it just tries too hard with regard to the 'fruit'. Enjoyable nonetheless."
"Clear copper color and not much head on the pour. Very fruity aroma coming from the glass. The apricot taste is certainly present but not overwhelming. It is not very sweet either, which I consider a plus. There is also a wheat taste to it. Not bad but I don't see me trying it again. I think if you like fruit beers you will like this."
"overall not impressive."
"I do have to say one thing though about pyramid....I can't say I like the marketing plan of just renameing several summer beers and seeing what happens...Although I will give props for being on all of my Alaska flights."
"Drinkability - Pretty decent if unremarkable fruit beer. Thankfully avoids being cloying. Not worth too many return visits though."
"This one's very sessionable and is a very solid example of the style."
"Not my style of beer, but very easy going down and a champion of this style."
"A pretty good beer all in all. If you don't like a fruity beer then stay away, but for my tastes, this wasn't bad. It would be another thing to continue drinking these in a night, but a nice effort from Pyramid."
"Other comments: Way too fruity and floral for my taste. This is as ""Audacious"" as getting slammed face-first into a fruit cart."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, really enjoyed the apricot, would definitely drink it again. My girlfriend and mom also really liked it."
"The good news is that the rebranding ensures that the beers hit the shelves fresh. Under the Apricot Weizen name, the beer seemed stale, uninspiring, and oxidized. Fresh, this beer does fare much better but you have really got to like fresh flavors of apricots to enjoy this beer."
"I poured into a pint glass to very little head. You cannot deny the apricot smell. The taste is just like the smell. Its actually quite refreshing on a warm day. It is quite drinkable although the fruitiness gets to me after 4 or 5. Overall, it is a nice summer brew."
"Overall, a well-made fruit beer that is rather easy drinking. I can appreciate it even more now that I have tried to brew a fruit beer myself (this beer being far superior)."
"...But in all seriousness, one of the most underrated of the category, and most surprisingly enjoyable. Time after time, when it's on tap at festivals/events along with the other 3 styles Pyramid contributes to the tent, this one always has the longest line and is so worth the wait. And, I hear they use the same delicious and all natural essence of apricot as those cooky, crafty Magic Hat brewers....right on."
"D - For a fruit beer it's not overpowering. It has plenty of flavor but is decently balanced making it a pretty decently drinkable beer."
"D - A decent simple fruit beer that serves the purpose of being refreshing and tasting more like fruit than beer. The fruit isn't overbearing or artificial, and while the beer behind it may not be very interesting, it's at least unoffensive and doesn't interfere with the overriding apricot flavor. Though I haven't had Magic Hat's #9 in quite a while, Apricot Ale reminds me a lot of that brew with a creamier and improved mouthfeel. Even if you hate beer but are into apricots, Pyramid's offering is more than worth a try."
"Overall, a good release from Pyramid, as expected. Great beer for women, too."
"D- Very Drinkable."
"All in all, nothing terrible, but nothing to seek out either. just blah"
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. I would definitely buy it again, especially to enjoy on a hot day working in the yard."
"The aroma is sweet and fruity with apricot and wheat. The appearance is cloudy orange with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma and just a bit harsh. The palate is smooth. It's interesting but I am just not crazy about it. This is still worth a try."
"naturally my wife really liked it too"
"Drinkability - Easily could have downed many of these."
"Appearance, dare I say has an hazy apricotiness to it with a thin head and no lace. Smell, Apricot is first and foremost. Taste has a definate apricot flavor with some background malt and hops. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Not much on fruit beers, but this is not bad, maybe one every now and then."
"D - Not a bad offering from Pyramid. This could be very sessionable in the Summer, especially with the low ABV."
"The taste is almost of an apricot spritzer. The ""beer"" of it is fairly weak and the weizen element is all but obscured. Despite this I'm compelled to acknowledge the somewhat embarrassing truth that I enjoy this fruity beer. It's too thin in the body, but the flavor is deserving and the fragrance is charmed. I wouldn't want to drink it every day, and I don't know how it found me in winter. (It's anything but a winter beer.) But Pyramid's effort is worthy of the concept of an apricot weizen, should that concept mean anything to you."
"Pours cloudy amber with a two finger head from a fast pour. Modest amount of lacings. Aroma is mostly apricot and some spices. Taste is tangy apricot with the usual Heffe flavors. I think I detected a touch of lemon as well. There is a touch of bitterness in the finish which must be the hops. This bottle tasted much better than the last one I tried. According to the enjoy by date (5-08-09) it is about a month old. Pretty tasty all in all, and quite sessionable if you like Heffes and apricots."
"Overall, this isn't half bad. It has a more robust mouth feel than I expected for a fruit offering."
"With the thought of champagne in mind, this sweet beer puts the imbiber in the mood for a celebration. You can celebrate a great meal and have this beer at dessert with, say grilled peaches? One can also celebrate that he has successfully opened a bottle of a light treat, making this a beer that can and should be celebrated with by having another."
"My first venture into the world of fruit brews. It might be that I just don't have the taste for it yet, I'm not giving up on these, but I didn't like it. The peach flavor was stronger than I expected an that made it taste like a juice box. Poured a nice color and the smell was amazing. If you know your fruit beers, go for it, it seems very popular. On the other hand, if your new, you might want to stay clear of this one."
"D: Huge apricot flavor and smell that is pretty natural but has no support. The rest of the beer is light.... Very drinkable."
"I poured this brew from a 12oz bottle in a pilz glass and observed only a bit of lead that left then scene quickly and left no ring. Color is a slightly hazy copper. Aroma is all apricot. There could be a bit of hops or maltiness there but you really have to sniff hard. Taste, well is just like the nose. This really isn't for me and It's tough to judge objectively when that occurs. It would be better if the fruit flavor was about a third of what it is and let the other ""beer"" flavors come out. This particular bottle poured almost flat, so I'll have to try the other 5 to be sure."
" ~ This is something I hope to have again. This would be a good beer to have at a cookout or out on the boat."
"Overall one of my favorite, if not my single favorite, fruit beer. Just the right amount of apricot flavoring and not too sweet."
"D= high. Despite how girly this beer is I'm very happy to say I tried it and it wasn't bad. I actually liked it a little. Good brew."
"""Judge a beer by its cover"" would be the perfect slogan for this Pyramid beer. You get exactly what you'd expect. Although it isn't my style I enjoyed it and look forward to having it in the summertime. Very good for its style!"
"D - This would be the perfect brew to be sipping on in the summer...it's pretty one dimensional...but I like it"
"Maybe not my daily cup of tea, but this would be great for a picnic on a hot summer's day. ABV is session-friendly too. I stayed away from this one for a long time, and I'm glad I was given this bottle by a friend, because it's not bad at all."
"D- Aside from the soda-pop-like carbonation, this drinks pretty well. The apricot doesn't get in the way when you pound it"
"D - This beverage would be great on a hot summer day at the beach. I could handle two or three at once through a funnel."
"D- would be a great summer brew, another good fruit beer that i can slam on down."
"D: I think this would make a crisp summer beer or a fitting thing to serve when you plan to down many."
"Pours clear gold with a billowy white head. Apricot and stale wheat aroma. The best description I can give the taste of this beer is that it tastes like iced tea with apricots. Some wheat and malt flavors, but the apricots overwhelm anything else that may be in there."
"The beer has an overpowering apricot taste. There is no balance with the flavor of the beer. The finish has some hops bittering it but the Apricot is strong all the way through. I think that this would be a great beer if they could balance out the wheat and apricots."
"Tasted 8/4/08."
"Pours a cloudy dark orange color, very strong apricot aroma overpowers anything else, medium-sized head quickly diminishing, got some sediment when I poured it, let it settle a bit before I drank, finely carbonated apricot flavor, overpowers other flavors, light taste, refreshing, slighty bitter aftertaste."
"D- If you like apricots and a light wheat beers this would be a worthwhile offering. Tasty and refreshing."
"Cheers"
"It tastes like apricot. I'll give them that. Unfortunately, it tastes more like apricot syrup and cough syrup than beer. This bottle is a bit older than I'd prefer for the tasting, but it certainly isn't old enough to excuse everything and still within the enjoy by date. The beer pours a cloudy and uninspiring gold. The head puffs up a bit but disappears very quickly. The smell is cough syrup and canned apricots. The taste is similar with abysmally little beer flavor. A hint of malt is all I got out of it. The feel is soda fizzy. It's not entirely undrinkable if you try to see past the flavor, not exactly the highest compliment I've ever given."
"Very simple, drinkable summer beer. Tastes great would defiantly recommend picking up a 6 pack of this"
"D: Not too bad, but not so good either. Yeah, there's 'apricot' ( a flavor which I typically like), but little else to build on; I'd pass on this if offered again..."
"Future outlook: Possible, though unlikely that I would pick this up again as there are other choices in this general realm of brew that I prefer. I'll drink it again if it shows up in my hand, but won't go out of my way to get it."
"Not something I'd want to drink a 6-pack of, but a great after dinner beer."
"My buddy who is a big fruit beer guy wasn't too big on this one, but I'm going to be open-minded about it. Pours a cloudy light orange with some sediment rolling around at the bottom. Nice big 2+ finger off white and fluffy head recedes at a mediocre pace. Little lacing is left behind. Smells of malt and a good dose of apricots up front with a lingering, medicinal essense enveloping it all. Tastes of tart apricot candy with a bit of orange peel and maybe even some underlying chalkiness. Mouth-feel is creamy and smooth, and sits just right on the palate. Wasn't really big on this one at first, but then again I'm not a big fruit beer kind of guy, and it kind of grew on me after a while."
"Great unfiltered light amber beer. Pours with a very little foam and light wisps of lacing. Has a wonderful apricot taste. It is a little fruity not overwelming but excellent reserves of taste. Very little hop taste its the malt that makes this beer a excellent tasting sitting around enjoyable beer."
"Something I would consider a closer beer and I enjoyed this beer with a Rothschild cigar by Arturo Fuente. Also followed it up with some Hookah with molases tobacco."
"D- Overall, the cloying sweetness and total lack of complexity really killed this one for me. It ended up being a drain pour after only being able to drink half the beer. I could see this being a girl beer, but then again, there are girls who DO have a taste for quality beer."
"Comment: This is my first review and I hope to find better beers to rate in the near future. This beer just tasted ""fake"" for some reason."
"This fine ale is a golden/orange hue color when poured in a pint glass, with a big white head. There's a wave of apricot scent to please your senses . Light-to-medium-bodied. There's a lot of fruity goodness to this beer. There is some malt and yeast to note, but the apricot flavor is the one that stands out to me the most. A long time fan of fruit beer I am not, but a friend of mine was just in love with this and so I decided one day to give it a shot...and yes this is kickass."
"Heard it was good and grabbed a sixer. Out of the bottle this one was a hazy golden orange with a small white head. Decent retention and some lacing. The apricot aromas is bright and appealing with hints of wheat buried underneath. The flavors were again mostly apricot though it is dry which is the wheat character, some yeast can be detected too. Little malt or hops distinction. The body was heavier than I expected, medium as opposed to light and the mouthfeel is a little rough. I like the flavors but this one needs a little work."
"D: Definitely drinkable, not sure I would want to have more than a few at a time but could definitely see myself having again."
" This is a beer that's perfect for this time of the year. It's not terribly hot out, but summer isn't over yet and something is needed to help enjoy the remainder of the season. This is that beer. It's not going to win any awards anytime soon...but it's a lot better than the macros that are out there. This is mellow and subtly solid but just falls short of a session beer, only because it's a bit more filling than your average ale or pils. Cheers to Pyramid for flavored unfiltered beers that can withstand the pressure of the cold bag in my trunk for weeks on end!"
"D. This is a nice beer very fruity and sweet but i couldnt see myself drinking this more than acouple times in my lifetime. It almost tastes like a apricot soda, not a beer."
"D- Very drinkable, especially if you like the taste of apricot. A little on the sweeter side, but there is a slight bitterness midway to help it from becoming too cloying. A summer beer definitely worth trying."
"The best by date is smudged on the bottles so it's hard to tell if the year is '05 or '06 either this sixer is past prime or has some time left. Either way this beer is a golden orange (rather interesting) color with an extremely thin head moderate carbonation and zero lacing. The aroma is primarily apricots sweet and inviting. The taste is filled with apricots that lead way to a bit of malt, interesting to say the least but well done. The mouthfeel is sticky and empty a real let down. Fruit beers can definitely be a challenge and this one pulls it off successfully but there is a lack of mild complexity that could really set this one apart."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured big, thick foamy head on cloudy light yellow. Apricot indeed! Came through like a rocket, yet soft and pleasant. Same deal with the taste...obviously the apricot was dominant, but not overly so. Smooth and thick on the mouth. A pleasant surprise, a fun fruit beer, easy to drink, but more than a bottle or two might be pushing it."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Poured into a pint glass and got a good looking one finger thick head that quickly vanished into a thin layer along the side of the glass; there is very little lacing, but it still looks refreshing. It has an extremely cloudy orangerown body with some very active carbonation. The aroma is very strong and sweet, the apricots really come through in the smell, there are some hints of green apples; it really smells like a life savers candy or a Welch's Grape Juice. Its really bitter/tart taste that mellows out in its aftertaste, but the strong apricot taste that you might expect after smelling isn't there; it has a medium to light body and is really smooth with no hints of alcohol. This would be great with a sweet or semi-sweet desert with lots of fruits."
"Drinkability is not too bad, a good gateway beer for non-craft drinkers, but the fruit, even though natural, gets tiring pretty quickly. This one is just above average, as the apricot and wheat is a nice match, and while it's not my cup of tea, it's a big crowd pleaser for summer bbq's."
"Drinability is good."
"D: Very high. The apricot is very refreshing and leaves me wanting more. 6-pack? No problem."
"D: Though I probably wouldn't drink this all the time, it is a break from the norm. I can see this as a very nice alternative for the ladies or anybody else that isn't a huge beer fan (Mikes Hard Lemonade anyone?). Definitely a gateway beer."
"Recommended as an excellent depiction of a fruit / vegetable beer..."
"Drinkability - It's hard to define but I would classify this (like in wine) as a dessert beer. It is good but very sweet which, for me, would be hard to drink several of them. I would buy again to occassionaly one to satisfy a sweet tooth craving."
"If you're into fruit beers then this one is pretty drinkable. This isn't my favorite style, but for what it is, it's done pretty well. Try it if you're into this sort of thing."
"Drinkability: Good. I went through my first bottle faster than I meant to. The flavor remains consistent and enjoyable throughout. Drinking two or more at one time would be neither difficult nor unpleasant. Goes well alone or with the right foods."
"This brew pours a hazy golden color with a lacking whitish head. The nose has some wheat malts but is mostly of apricot juice. This has an apricot syrup taste that doesn't go down well. The body is light and has heavy carbonation that fights the palate. I had a few sips and gave the rest away."
"Try it!"
"Nice apricot aroma upon pouring. Poured sort of a gradiant yellow-oragne color in the glass with a decent white head that persisted for a while. Found the apricot flavor a bit strong, and a little overpowering the white beer, which was nice a yeasty. Very slight hop kick at the finish. Generally liked this but thought it would be better if the apricot puree was a little better balanced with the rest of the brew."
"D - Nice drinkable beer."
"Obviously smells of apricots. But that's it. For taste, it starts with a light zing of carbonation with a bit of apricot flavor throughout. It finishes with some sweetness of apricot. It's not heavy on the tongue, and is overall a decent beer."
"Looks more dense than it feels. Goes down really smooth. This is surely a sixer you go solo on and catch a real nice buzz off. I'm not really fan of fruit beers, although anything apricot turns me on- this one is alright in my book."
"Mouthfeel is light and has a crisp carbonation, but the artificial fruit flavor has an unpleasant after taste. Alcopop"
"The taste is tart, dry apricot with fizzy mineral water at first with a really long, cracker finish along with dry apricot. It gets tiresome fast and it's downright awful with food, which causes the unpleasant apricot-mineral water taste to completely take over. Alone, it's a bit refreshing, but otherwise I shall avoid it."
"D= I was pleasantly suprised by this beer and would now consider it an excellent hot weather refresher. The balance of flavors and the not-too-sweet apricot notes make this one shine."
"I think a combination of the medium body, ample dryness, reserved sweetness, and citrusy hop element bring this all together into a brew I can rally around. Even a notch better than the Magic Hat #9 apricot brew which I rated a 3.3 yesterday."
"T: not bad at all. bam in your mouth apricot... not too much of a surprise its very clean though. not much beyond what youd expect a clean beer with apricot, its basic but does it well. its a little too fruity for me to drink alot of, but would def recommend to a friend looking for a fruit beer"
"Golden orangish with white head. Smell is mouthwatering vibrant juicy apricots bursting out of the glass. Taste is smooth, prefectly sweet with intense apricot flavor making this an overall very nice fruit beer. Very light wheat taste noticeable, but much less so than other wheat/fruit beers. Worth a try for sure."
"Pours a misty orange with a white head. The apricot smell is huge, very aromatic, and sweet. The taste follows, like drinking juice with hints of beer, but still a good beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, good carbonation, the fruit flavor is the most prominant here. This is an easy drinker, probably couldn't have more than a few due to the sweetness and flavor, but still worth checking out."
"Drinkability I would say is high. Feels light on the way down, smooth, pretty light & Very refreshing. This is what I call a Hot day Beer!"
"Drinkability - disappears fast. Fruity, foofy, but easy to drink during the hot summer I reckon."
"Overall, a nice fruit beer. The apricot is the large dominant flavor in this beer, yet i dont think it is out of control...i think it has it's own place and is quite refreshing."
"Smell, of course, is Apricot. A tad bit fruitier than I normally like, but not bad. Some wheat and malt. Good finish, OK beer."
"D- This beer has a huge apricot flavor and smell that is pretty natural but has no support. The rest of the beer is a bit light and watery."
"hazy dark honeyish with a little white head that disolves quickly and leaves no lace. smells okay. like apricots, and dull wheat. tastes like a wheat/apricot spritzer, which i guess it should. not much else going on here. just beyond light body given the weight it takes on from the wheat and such. easy, sort of refreshing drink that would for sure go over well with the fruity loving, summer fun in the sun having, most likely female crowd (ba sisters please don't take offense, i'm sure you know what i mean). Not bad, but not my cup of tea. or beer. or whatever."
"D: A good American wheat, I liked it, well made, and the apricot adds an extra kick and interesting quality to this ale."
" Overall I have to say though that this was not bad by any stretch. It was a nice surprise and a good lively little effort of their part. I could see myself having one every now and again, however one would defiantly be enough for sure. If it is around I would defiantly say give it a shot, it is in the same kind as a Lindemans, however it has a little bit more of a punch. Pretty decent offering and good enough to get me to look at Pyramid again in the future."
"Recommended."
"When Pyramid says this is an Apricot brew they ain't kidding. It's a cloudy orange in color so it looks a bit like apricot juice. The smell is pretty much apricot all the way and, other than a slight hint of wheat, apricot is pretty much all you can taste. The aftertaste is, you guessed it, apricot. I mean, you hardly taste anything BEER in it but a whole lotta apricot. A lighty carbonated apricot malt beverage maybe...but not a straight up beer. The thing is though is that the apricot tastes artificial."
"Very dull...not a very good combination of flavors. I wouldn't want to drink this one again. I feel a little bit sick after drinking 1/2 bottle."
"Ok, so it's not the most finely crafted and complex beer, but it's the best fruit beer I've ever had... even if it is made with extract. I'll buying this every spring as soon as I see it on the shelves."
"Very drinkable, though the fruit flavor may get tiring after a couple pints. Decent beer, not strikingly special."
"Yellow to orange in color that's cloudy. The head doesn't retain well on this one, even for it's style. Nice balance of fruit and wheat in the smell, neither one overpowers, complimented with a touch of cream. In the taste, the apricot is mixed with some cheerios and other light cereal flavors. Neither one is overbearing, which is a good thing. It has a nice crisp mouthfeel. A nice nightcap for me, though it might be better suited for the afternoon."
"Pours a translucent yellow/orange color, heavily carbonated, creamy white head settles fairly quickly. As you would expect, apricot smell is very apparent, also some faint grassy aroma. Tastes like apricot s, with a respectable malty backbone. Mouthfeel is fairly medium bodied, not terribly drying. It's a relatively nice beer to drink, and im sure it's a fine example of the style, but i'd prefer my beer to taste more like beer. As a result, i don't think i'd drink this again."
"D: While it is not as complex as other beers I've tried I am not affraid to admit that that does not matter so much for this beer. It's label says Apricot Weizen and delievers that promise. Very good beer that I would recomend to everyone. Also I could see this beer as a nice stepping stone for someone who is looking to get craft brews."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light on the tongue with a light body and light carbonation. This is a brew that goes down easy, and could be drunk all night, however, I don't think I'll come back to this one for a while, nothing all that great about it."
"drinkability is good. an excellent summer drink. very refreshing. i'd love it even more with just a touch less apricot."
"Not chewy enough to be anything above average although the carbonation level is steady. Goes down easy although the apricot flavor grows tiresome eventually."
"A little over the top with the apricots, but still very drinkable and probably and good cross over for the ladies."
"Drinkability - Easy going, very drinkable, could chug this all day long on a hot summer day, would guess it goes with any pairing of food"
"Drinkabilty - I don't like apricots, so I didn't care for it. If you like wheats and apricots, give it a whirl."
"D - Pretty good here. It is a mild fruity concoction that contains alcohol - so it screams sorority girls. It is widely available and commonly found at parties, so I will likely have it again - but I will certainly never buy it again."
"Had this before playing some golf today...not by choice or anything but it was offered so I accepted. Poured a couldy golden orange with a large head that quickly faded with minimal lacing. Pretty good smell, mostly of apricots. Thought I smelled peaches but I guess that's close enough. Taste was something I'm not used to but really not bad at all. Sweet, fruity, and satisfying. I can understand why people could drink this every once in a while. Near average mouthfeel, though the flavor doesn't last too long because it seemed a little thin and light. Overall I'd say this is about average for what Pyramid has put out here. If you're in for something other than the typical choices you might want to try this."
"Pours out a cloudy apricot (HEY!) body with tons of carbonation, a thick, creamy head, and some rings, sheets, and splotches of lacing. There's an underlying wheat aroma to the candy-like apricot presence, and I don't pick up too much yeast character. Tastes like a really uninspired American wheat beer that overcompensates with the apricot flavoring. Still, it's better than that Sam Adams boysenberry wheat. Mouthfeel is light, bubbly, and just about right on. The apricot could get tiring, hindering drinkability."
"Great summer session beer."
"I gave this a favorable review because the label clearly stated that this is a fruit beer. Though it has ""weizen"" it did not seem to claim that was the main character of the beer."
"Drinks pretty easy despite the sweetness. Pair with BBQ chicken or ribs. These fruit beers are not my cup of thea, but this one works enough to have 2 before moving on"
"This one pours really thin, no haze, very little head and what's there doesn't stick around. Very little lacing. Sweet orange fruit aroma, a little yeasty, probably unmalted wheat. The flavor is a little sugary and loaded with apricot flavor and wheat mouthfeel, high carbonation. Not bad, might be a better hefeweiss. Not my favorite of fruit beers, but more innocuous than many cloyingly sweet ones."
"Not entirely sure why I bought this... actually it was on sale and I bought it just to try and write a review! Anyhow, it might be fine for someone who likes fruitier beers, though even if that were me I'd still have some major objections. Not enjoyable... best avoided."
"Recommended."
"Poured from bottle to my tasting glass. Pours cloudy, golden/yellow with a pale head that dissipated leaving little to no lacing. Smelled of strong apricots but not overpowering. Tasted like a good wheat beer with a light apricot taste - didn't taste as strong as is smelt. Not a strong alcohol taste (5.1% ABV). It felt light and smooth - a little high in carbonation. Very easy to drink. I would drink this again."
"I had been wanting to try this for a while, and finally took the plunge. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a very hazy yellow, forming a 1 inch thick white head, leaving medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sweet apricot, and thats about it. The taste is just as good. Sweet apricot flavor, along with a little hops, and maybe a slight wheat flavor. Light mouthfeel. Overall, I find this to be a very enjoyable fruit beer. I would definitely drink this again, but I couldnt see drinking more than one or two of these in a night."
"This beer poured out a nice orange, very hazey, mild head and lacing, good carbonation. Smell was nice and fruity, with a good wheat mix as well. After that just OK. Taste and mouthfeel very mild, very light, and somewhat disappointing I thought. Perhaps a beer to return to in the warmer months?"
"Pours a cloudy light orange color with little head at all. Smells like umm, apricots. Taste is apricot and slight hops. Not a whole lot here. Not a big fan of fruit beers, but this is ok. Much more drinkable than some. A little light. The taste is a bit muddled as well. Does quench your thirst though. So, that's something."
"I think this would be just fine at a party where shorts and a kiddie pool with iced down beers. I have to say it's one of the better Pyramids from a bottle that they're currently brewing."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow. Thin and weak 1/2 finger head with dismal retention and no lacing. Strong apricot and peach aroma and a distant pale malt scent. Flash of malted wheat and pale barley sweetness, followed immediatly by a blast of zesty fruit cup flavor. The apricot is apparent but there are also some tart fermentation by-product tastes similiar to pear and peach, which works nicely here. Drying aftertaste with mild american hop bitterness and possible grapefruit rind hop charcter and light tropical fruit phenols lingering breifly. Very crisp and refreshing mouthfeel, with a light body that shows some texture from the fruit pulp. Finishes with a touch of weizen yeast and not overly sweet; only of hint of apricot remaining. An interesting blend of two styles, though the weizen character is hidden and barely perceivable. This could make a decent alternative when you want something highly drinkable and unique, or a great transitional beer for people who like foo-foo drinks."
"A decent tasting beer. I should say if you like apricots then this beer is probably a good bet for you."
"[ serving type: 12 oz bottle ]"
"Pyramid's Apricot Ale is, in my opinion, one of the best fruit beers on the market today. It offers a beautiful nose of sweet apricot that's remarkably authentic (although I'm sure it's from extract). The body is a bit hazy, and has a golden-orange color similar to that of an apricot. The creamy white head holds fairly well before dropping to a wide collar, and it leaves some spots and splashes of lace behind it. In the flavor, the same apricot fruitiness returns, and it's just gently sweet and not overdone. Some malt flavor backs it, and it's perfectly balanced by a firm bitterness that's just enough to keep it ""beer", and leave it dry and refreshing. Some mild apricot flavor lingers in the aftertaste, nagging at you to take another sip. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth - again, kind of like an apricot - with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation and medium body. It's enjoyable year-round, but I really think it's perfect on a warm summer day outside. Very nice!"
"This beer gets pluses for staying true to what it was trying to accomplish. I think the appearence could use some help though. Overall I think its nicely complex for being a simply apricot beer."
"Really only for apricot lovers because there really isn't much else here."
"Poured out a golden reddish color with no head whatsoever. The nos eis overbearinlgy strong sweat apricot, I can't freaking tell if there's nything else in there, it's just... so... damn... apricotty. My god man. It's like someone jabbed a bunch of apricot up my nose. Lots of them. Yeeesh! Ok, what the f*ck? The taste is like apricot syrup. I am not against fruit beers, bring it on, but it's fruit beer, not 'fruit.' Can I throw up now? This is like drinking the syrup out of a Shoprite packaged fruit can. On sale and expired. Seriously. Bad stuff. Le's just get on with our lives now."
"This is a very nice fruit beers. A lot of fruit beers have a soda type mouthfeel IMO, but this one is great. The apricots really come out very well. This is a beer anyone can enjoy. The apricot smell is alluring. The only thing not so great about this beer is its appearance. Could have a lot more head and retention. I will definetly pick this up again when I am in the mood for a nice apricot fix."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin ring leaving no lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Strong apricot nose. Starts with a sweet strong apricot flavor, hints of hops at finish. Its too cold now, this beer would be much better in the summer. $1.69 for a 12oz bottle from Chalet Party Goshen, In."
"Pyramid Apricot Weizen was a hazy golden color with a white head. The head was small and soon dissipated to a ring. The aroma was all apricots. The taste was apricots over a light malt and wheat base. It was not overly sweet and balanced out nicely in the finish. It was medium-full bodied with plenty of carbonation. Dinkability was about average. It's alright for something different, but one is enough for me."
"The drinkability is quite high. I would say that this is a great beer like Blue Moon for non-beer drinkers."
"this beer to me seemed very poor in quality and did not have anything in my book going for it like i said i could not finish it due to its sweetness but like i say give it a try but ill tell you there are way better interpretations of this style"
"D - drinkable, might work as a session beer in the hot summer"
"I donÂ’t really like it, the meld of apricot and wheat just doesnÂ’t do it for me. IÂ’m not a huge fan of weizens in general, if I were this might be more palatable. Valiant attempt here Pyramid, but IÂ’ll stick with your wonderful Thunderhead."
"Could be good drinking on a summer day but doesn't pack enough flavor for much else."
"Drinkability: Unimpressive flavor limits one's eagerness to consume. It is uninhibiting and not very filling however. A middling beer experience."
"Hazed, dull amber. Thin dirty white head. Specks of CO2 cling to the walls of the glass. Aroma is apricot and more apricot. It doesn't really overload the senses, but there's not a lot else going on here. Still, a nice aroma I think. Juicy apricot plays over a dulled wheat base to give this beer a little character. Spritzy mouthfeel and refreshing. Decent enough beer...especially on a hot summer day I would imagine."
"Overall: I do not like this beer. I only have it because my mom, who does like it, bought some and left it at my house. I guess if you like your drinks to taste like apricot, you might like it."
"D-Very easy to drink.It's the beer you buy forr girls when your at the bar."
"A decent offering for what it is. Flavor is certainly on the sweet side, but still a drinkable brew, especially refreshing on a hot summer day. Worth a try."
"Not to bad as long as you like apricots, very one dimensional."
"Poured into a pint glass - little head and cloudy peach-bronze in color. The haziness was expected, being an unfiltered weizen beer. The smell was not too intense but definitely of apricots. The initial taste is of the apricot sweetness, followed by a kiss of kiss of hops that balance the beer nicely. As far as the mouthfeel, this beer has a sort of medium creamy body with good carbonation. Overall, this beer is pretty good. My first apricot beer, and I wasn't disappointed."
"Not too often that an apricot beer comes across the palate, and it's good for a change from the usual. It may also be a good choice for those that don't enjoy the banana, clove, etc. flavors of German hefe's but want something more exciting than an American wheat."
"drinkability: This is more akin to soda than an ale, but an interesting change of pace for the warmer months, or for those who have a hard time enjoying beer."
"It pours a cloudy golden color with a semi-thick head. Smelled only slightly of apricot...seemed dry with a little hoppiness. Much lighter than I expected..the fruity-weizen taste goes down well. Would be good on a summer day, but I'd sooner reach for a #9."
"I have not had this beer in years, but my wife saw it while walking through Trader Joes, and I figured what the hell and picked up a six pack. Ever since I started drinking beer, and even during my period of not liking any type of fruit beer, I have always found this beer to be nice, quaffable and enjoyable. A work of artistic brewing, perhaps not, but it is a great beer to have well chilled in the fridge when it is 110*F (45*C) out."
"Like the other reviews before me, I'm not into fruity beers. After pouring it into a pint glass I noticed a rust orange color with a small head which disapeared in about a minute. The smell is of a powerful apricot odor which almost turned me off immediately. The first taste was smooth with a distant apricot finish, a lot less than the strong smell of the beer. The beer had a smooth mouthfeel with a higher drinability than most other fruity beers. I would only recommend drinking about 2 because of the lingering apricot taste it will leave in your mouth. I would prefer to drink an American Hef and add my own garnish of fruit."
"It was drinkable, I guess, if you really have a thing for apricots in particular. I won't be buying it again. I bought a six-pack, and the final three sat in my fridge for a month until I was out of everything else."
"Orange in color, maybe a little amber-ish, decent sized white head bubbles up. Aroma is of course of apricot, but with some bready wheat in the background. The taste is very much the same as the aroma, sweet and tangy apricot, but not an obnoxious amount, bready wheat helps balance and subdue it. Simple and sweet. The mouthfeel is maybe a little cloying, but not in a bad way. It is what it is, an apricot beer, I don't have anything against them. It was awesome on a 96 degree and humid day."
"PyramidÂ’s Apricot Weizen pours a deep golden hue. Holding it up to a light, I noticed it is slightly cloudy in appearance. The head dissipated quickly, but tracings clung in minute amounts to the sides of the glass. The aroma was a very subdued apricot scent (compared to my expectations) with a touch of grass. The flavor of the beer naturally brought to mind apricots, but was slightly bitter. There was a significant aftertaste considering how little taste appeared while drinking the beer. The mouthfeel was unimpressive; this beer looks and felt like a slightly thicker macro. Not bad for a different kind of beer, but certainly nothing I would seek out again."
"Average golden color. Fruity aroma-doesnt scream apricots but they are definately there. Definate apricot flavor-fairly fruity. Nice crisp tang to the finish. Ok body. A decent enough beer. I dont find any real weizen characteristics to balance the fruitiness. More then 1 or 2 would be too sweet for me. Worth a shot."
"A good fruit beer, and one that can really introduce people to the style."
"I have had a few fruit beers and this one is not bad, worth a try if someone you know wants to drink something that is not very strong. Worth the smell alone."
"Overall it lives up to its name. Apricots definitely are the main point. Probably wouldn't have more than one or two in a sitting due to tiring of the apricot flavor."
"anyway...this is nice beer. my wife liked it, too."
"Apricot Weizen is a hazy orange with a small ultrawhite head. Retention is weak. The aroma is a very full, fresh sweet-tart apricot with a bit of underlying wheat. A sip begins with tart apricot which quickly sweetens with the additional of malt and wheat flavors. The apricot flavor is mostly sweet towards mid-sip when it's flavor peaks. The yeasty hefe character is minimal here, apricot and wheat flavors dominate. Overall, Apricot Weizen is a nice fruit beer, perhaps a little sweet for my tastes, but still a good example of how to combine beer and fruit flavors."
"But maybe not for someone who doesn't like apricots."
"Highly drinkable on a hot day, I'd wager. But it'd have to be pretty hot for me."
"Had to try it and get a bottle of the regular Apricot too. My fiance loved them both I was not so enthralled. This orangish concotion was better than the regular apricot. Decent head on this one but it only throws up apricot/peachness with a bit of bread. Taste is smooth not as cloy as the other one, the aftertaste lingers. Still too sweet and not a more than one a sitting beer."
"Drinkability...easy to drink for a summer brew."
"From a pretty hard pour, a small white head forms and dissipates just as quickly as it came. A nose with a moderate amount of ripe apricot and not alot else. The taste is slight tang sourness with a mettalic quality in the middle that is not really pleasing. Not much happening with this beer. The mouthfeel is about what you'd expect from a wheat beer. I imagine this beer can be pretty refreshing on a hot day, but what taste there is wasn't really pleasing due to the metallic quality."
"i really like this beer, i'm not a usual fan of ""fruit beers"" but this one is done right. even and balanced."
"Overall: A pleasant surprise and a damn good fruit beer. Not over the top like so many in this category. Just the right amount of apricots and a good wheat backbone. I'll go back to this brew."
"This is a drinkable beer. Not being a big fan of fruit beers I donÂ’t think IÂ’d buy this again, but thereÂ’s no reason not to drink it. ItÂ’s a very serviceable beer, and a bit of a novelty, which makes it fun."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Crisp, refreshing beer....pretty appropriate for a hot sunny afternoon. Sweet, but not too sweet, and that makes it something I could probably drink one or two of in a sitting."
"12 oz bottle poured out an orange color with next to no head. Obviously it smelled and tasted like apricot. Also it has wheat flavor, but the apricot flavor was overpowering. It had a fizzy mouthfeel. I wouldn't really call it highly drinkable. I had such a hard time drinking it, that I let my wife finish it."
"Delicious! This is my first apricot beer. The flavors blend quite well, at least with Pyramid's. Yes, the scent and taste is dominated by apricot, but the flavor of the fruit goes well with beer in my opinion. It pours out a cloudy gold/orange. The smell is pure apricot. The taste is nearly the same. Little bit of fizziness and a lingering cottonmouth aftertaste I could have done without. Very drinkable and quite refreshing."
"This is a fruity summer beer. It's drinkable, but very one dimensional. The taste will appeal more to malternative drinkers than beer drinkers."
"Not a big fruit beer fan myself but Ive heard good things about this one. Poured it into my pint glass and noticed a nice head dissapear into less than a thin film. The color was a light orange with a slight haze to it. The smell was with out a doubt apricot. I couldnt smell anything else. The taste was much the same all apricot. It wasnt an overpowering flavor either, I think thats why I enjoyed it so much. It was very smooth with a nice body to it. Just right. I couldnt drink more than one in a sitting since the flavor of apricots lingered for so long."
"Drinkability: I like fruit beers as a change of pace and this one is very drinkable; it could be a lot better with a bit more character and hop balance"
"This is an orangish beer with a thin brittle white head that basically smells like peach air-freshener. The taste is a light, but nonetheless artificial tasting candy (reminds me of jolly ranchers!) peach, apricot flavor that overwhelms any discernable malt flavors. Very floral hops enhance the trick nicely and a hint of yeast in the finish makes a futile attempt to dry things. This beer is a bit artificial tasting for me but the fact that I tasted both hops and yeast in it impressed me somewhat. Lifting carbonation is pleasant. Cloying qualities kept me from wanting more. Some people love this stuff. You should try it once."
"Although I'm not crazy about fruit beers (not counting cantillion and the like) this beer is better than I remembered from past experiences. It looks nice in the glass, although the head is weak and fades fast. This beer definitely delivers in the apricot department. The smell is all apricot, with the faintest hint of malt, or maybe it's my imagination. The taste is all apricot, with hardly any of the 'weizen' flavors coming through. I noticed that 10 minutes after I finished this beer, the apricot flavor still lingered. I really was impressed by the mouthfeel, a nice medium texture. The carbonation seemed just right, not too fizzy, but lively enough for the light flavor. Anyone who buys this beer looking for apricot flavor will no doubt be satisfied."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a smooth apricot scent along with the standard weizen aroma. It's dry, yet quite fruity. The taste is decent. It has a wonderful apricot presence that refreshes and is quite enjoyable. However, it also has a dry earthy finish that seems a bit sour and clovey. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer. It's just not my favorite fruit/beer combo."
"Smell is of a multitude of different fruits. Apricot is very noticeable, but without a doubt there is a strong presence of pear and/or mango. Although there are fragments of fruit contained in the bottle, pour is smooth with a nice dark coulour. Head is thick in complexion; retention is also longer than expected, and a fairly thick lace remains after the head has fully disappeared. Taste, as expected, is very fruity... possibly too fruity. Many different flavors are present at the same time, so it is a bit overwhelming. Overall this is a nice try for those unfamiliar with the category. This very fragrant beer is probably even better on tap."
"Smooth flavor, light effervescence all over tongue and palate, a touch dry & tart with a pleasant apricot/malt aftertaste that lingers nicely and fades slowly & evenly. Medium-bodied. definitely worth a try, good stuff."
"By the way I am new to reviewing beers, I'm sure I'll get better at it."
"I gave his girlfriend a couple of weizen glasses a few months ago, so I conveniently have the proper glassware. It pours light orange with a frothy white head that shrinks fairly quickly. I feel like I'm opening a bag of dried apricots when I smell this beer. The taste sure doesn't disappoint. It's actually better then it could have been. The flavor is filled with apricots, but it tastes like beer rather then some sweet concoction. There is a faint, but noticeable hop presence upfront, which is followed by light wheat notes. Again, the apricots are everywhere so you should probably pass on this beer if you don't like apricots, but if you do like apricots, this is a very good beer. I look forward to picking up a six-pack real soon."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. There is a good balance between the hops and fruit. This is not a syrupy sweetly sticky beer. This is a very tasty well made sessionable beer."
"If you feel that most beers that use fruit go overboard to the point that they ruin the beer characteristics, this maybe one that you want to give a try."
"D- this is one of the beers to get beer haters to drink. Not my thing though. It was wirth trying, but i doubt i'll be looking for this one again."
"If you like apricots, or maybe mangoes, you'll love this beer. It doesnt taste much like beer, I guess I'd call it a beer with a ""chick twist"". They really should market it towards young women."
"Drinkability: A decent fruit beer and I'd like to compare it to the apricot ale to see if it is any different. I can't recall from memory what the apricot ale tastes like, but that's what my wife thought it was when she bought it."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability? Total drain pour. I give the drinkability rating a little leeway, because I think I am drinking an outdated (possibly oxidized?) bottle. The bottling date on the label is blurred, so I do not know how old this is."
"Easy to drink. ItÂ’s not breathtaking, but itÂ’s pleasant. The kind of thing that would be perfect in a restaurant waiting at the bar for the rest of your party. Nothing thatÂ’s going to destroy your pallet for later on, but still something youÂ’ll enjoy. Something to drink slowly. While thereÂ’s a lot of subtlety in the flavor and smell, the flavors and smells you really notice are simple and immediate. Worth analyzing once, but not going to get much out of a second try that you didnÂ’t get the first time."
"Crisp and fairly smooth. Definitely drinkable if you like apricot."
"Drinkability- Didn't carry with it the weize drinkability as do others. Plus the flavor was so faked, I might be able to fit two beers for an evening and thats it."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, small head forms, no lace to speak of. Smell is all apricots, with a little bit of honey sweetness and floral/citrus. Taste is sweet and apricot, fruit, some floral, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium carbonation. Not bad, not good."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a subtle creaminess and plenty of carbonation...quite refreshing really. I could see this going great on a hot summer day, it reminds me of O'Fallon Wheach. Worth looking into if you're a fan of fruit beers, apricots or both. Unfiltered as well!"
"The amount of apricot taste this beer has is pretty impressive and even more impressive is the smell. I was actually a little afraid of what it was going to taste like before trying it. It has a pleasent sweet taste, but the sweetness is not excessive or overpowering. Probably a bit more refreshing than alot of the other fruit beers I have had. I'd recommend this ober most of the fruit beers I have had."
"Nice, tasty, light, what I was expecting...thanks Pyramid!"
"Really not terrible for a fruit beer. The apricot taste is remarkably unoffensive and I could probably grab another after I was finished with the first one. Probably not one I'd buy on a regular basis, but there are much worse fruit beers out there."
"My first fruit beer. Pours a cloudy yellow, nice carbonation, no head. Nice lacing throughout. Scents of wheat, sweet apricots. Very nice taste, sweet and mellow. Light bodied, nice aftertaste. This goes down like kool-aid/water, could drink quite a few, but watch out for the alcohol content."
"Drinkability is really quite good. Tasty refreshing wheat beer that would be good as a summer thirst quencher or a Sunday brunch beer. Not sweet enough for a dessert beer, but this would go very well with a salad or fruit."
"Overall it is a good beer but a bit one sided, the fruit side. If youÂ’re into apricots then you will dig it."
"I've been curious to grab a sizer of this for about a year now. Am I glad I picked this single out at a wine shop instead. Not good at all. At first this one poured nice, looked appealing, smelled great. That was all. The taste is bland with the slightest hint of apricot. Sour and thin, this one was one of the biggest disappointments I've had in a long while. For the first time in months, I left a quarter of it in the glass. So much for my beer quote on my profile."
"not the apricot ale but an apricot weizen? never seen it before and in vegas its hot so it sounded like a quencher. pours a cloudy sunset with a weak head. ok. smells fruity, grainy, beery? taste is refreshing to say the least. def. not a powerhouse of taste explosions but tastey nonetheless. crisp and refreshing like their usual weizen (american wheat beer cough cough) but with a nice apricot smack. lightly tart with a nice finishing bite. light and refreshing, almost a bit creamy, this is a decent brew. hell forget decent, its a pretty good brew. good hot weather grab."
"Body is rather thin, but slick and thirst quenching nontheless."
"Medium body and mouthfeel that was dextrinous and semi-slick. The hops (never bitter but clearing the sweet apricot flavor) persist till end. I would like a crisper finish. If possible I would describe the apricots as cloying (not the sweetness) Feels like I fell asleep under the Apricot tree and somehow all the fruit was shaken off and covered me at the bottom of the pile. I would expect this to attract bees on the deck on a summers day."
"Pours a very appealing cloudy copper/amber with golden yellow highlights around the edges and a small white head which lasts for a minute or so. Looks like a cross between an amber and a hefe-weissen. Smell is dried apricots right up front, quite sweet, with some grainy aftertones. Taste is more apricot with a steady balance of wheat grass, not particularly malty or hoppy, but the bitter wheat balances out the sweet fruit quite well. Reminded me of a apricot version of Tommyknocker's Jack Whacker Wheat. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, I like a well-carbonated fruit beer. I could definitely see myself drinking quite a few of these on a hot summer evening."
"Cloudy golden-orange with a nice fluffy off-white head. Aroma is candy sweet apricots- it really smells fresh and juicy. Some malty wheat character is there too- this is still a beer after all. Apricots are just as prominent in the flavor, with a strong and unique sweet/tartness. The classic weizen malt character is present to some extent, though other hefeweizen flavors such as banana and clove are absent- they would taste pretty screwed up when clashing with apricot, I imagine. Tartness affects drinkability to some extent, but it's still quite a tasty and refreshing brew. So far I've hated most fruit beers I've tried, but I have to give this one a strong recommendation."
"I like this beer because the apricots know their place in the body of the beer. The colour is a pretty pinky brown and the nose is like a bowl of apricots. The beer part is pretty ok but the fruit part is what really makes this work . Easy to drink more than one and food friendly this is one of their better beers."
"Drinkability? Not for me. While I haven't tried other apricot flavored beer, I'd prefer raspberry. Maybe if it was a stronger apricot..."
"As far as fruit beers go, this is tremendous. The smell is strongly of sugar and apercot, not much more there. The taste is simply the same thing, just sugar and apercots... the mouthfeel is almost like you are biting into the fruit itself. They must have a special way of harnessing the taste. Great for summer!"
"The nose is all apricot. The apricot taste hits hard and is followed by a bready flavour before the apricot reasserts itself with a very slight hop finish. This is refreshing and rather as one would expect. It is too sweet for a session beer."
"This old friend is back in my state after a hiatus of 4 years. Time has not hurt this brew and tastes as good as it did the first time I had it. Beer pours a hazy orange with a decent foamy head. Beer smells of apricot/orange. Taste is fantastic a fusion of wheat and apricot that makes this a must have for summer. A session beer in my opinion."
"Nonetheless, I found that I couldn't drink more than 1 because it was too fruity and sweet."
"Pours a cloudy, yellowish-orange color with a thick white head that dissapates quickly. Smell is dominated by apricots, with a fruity esters background, but still the apricot smell is slightly overwhelming. Taste is your basic american wheat beer with an apricot theme, interesting but not exactly a great beer. The apricot flavor in a american wheat is intriguing because it's more refreshing than you'd expect but im not sure it was a good decision anyways. Definately something slightly different to try, but not really a sucess in my book."
"Pyramid also has a brewery in Berkeley Ca. It's on Gilman just west of San Pablo. I think I'll pay them a visit next time I'm in the Bay Area."
"Light and billowy in the mouth with soft and easy carbonation. Not a whole lot to grab on to here, but better than most attempts at a fruit infused beer."
"Pours a hazy golden color, smells of ripe apricots and a slight grassy hop aroma as well...tastes like apricots, as expected, but not overly so. There is a discernible hop flavor that lingers towards the finish, which is clean and slightly dry. This is a very refreshing light fruit beer. I am kind of bummed that I have only found singles in Spec's so far. A somewhat different, but very good, brew."
"The beer escapes the 12-ounce brown bottle a limpid amber color with a modest sized frothy light tan head after its decomposition the lace forms a thin concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is heavy on the apricots, fresh and crisp, sweet with the start sweet and the malt profile decent, the top fair to middling in feel. Finish has a pronounced acidity with the hops light in spiciness, the aftertaste tart and dry, a drinkable beer, but nothing I would drink on a regular basis."
"drinkability is average at best. i could drink it again, but the apricot flavor could get old eventually"
"Light-medium bodied, lots of carbonation. Taste is pretty straightforward; it's all apricot. Some sweetness comes in but never gets to be too much. A pretty easy-drinking, non-complex fruit beer."
"I barely got through one bottle and I doubt I'll ever try this one again."
"Too sweet a beer for me (as apricots are mostly too sweet a fruit); I admit my bias. For fans of the fruit, I imagine this is a good beer."
"Ratings say ""worth a try"". I say ""avoid""."
"Edit: This was the original Apricot Ale. Need to try the new name and see if it is Audacious"
"This beer came to me a golden brown color with orange highlights on the edges, decently carbonated and had a slight haze to it. Head that was created was white, thick, creamy, and on the sticky side. Patches of a foamy lace were present but not in my opinion a true lace. Simple aromas came from the glass Â– lots of apricots, wheat grains, and wisps of hops. A beer that is what the label states. The flavors were just as the aromas, fresh picked apricots, some sweet malts, wheat grain tones, some sugar, and citrus hops from beginning to the end. Aftertaste was light. The body was on the medium side. Smooth and creamy beer, was rather pleased and happy with this beer, not one I would drink in quantity but a nice treat and would drink again especially during dessert."
"Drinkability- I'll still continue to try the rest of the Pyramid line, but this is not my taste for a beer."
"Apricot Ale tastes pretty much as you'd expect; it tastes like apricots. It's a sugary, honeyed nectar with enough wheat to make the beer cuttingly refreshing, despite its abundant sweetness. But on the whole, it basically tastes like sucking down the syrup out of a tin of apricots. I suppose it might work in a dessert setting, and it could probably be used in a killer recipe, but it completely fails in scratching that beer itch with which we are all familiar. I will say this, in defense of fruit beers: apricots (and peaches, pears, squash, pumpkin, and apples, for that matter) work much better with beer flavors than berries -- or cherries. It's just a better marriage... or it could just be a personal preference. Dogfish Head made a good beer with Aprihop, which succesfully married the sweetness of the apricot with the citric bitterness of the hops. It worked well, and I would recommend that one over Pyramid's abundantly sweet version. However, if you're an apricot nut with a severe sweet tooth, or some sort of bee or fruit fly, you will probably prefer the Pyramid."
"Pours a clear and bright golden-orange in color. Fizzy layer of dying white head clings to the glass. Aromas are pronounced apricots, maybe with a spoonful of sugar on them. Not much else, but the smell sure didn't need it. Very nice. Flavor is also loaded with apricots, with a bready/doughy finish to it. There's barely any bitterness to this beer. Apricots remain on the palate long after the finish. Decent mouthfeel and drinkability. Great summer beer."
"Hazy apricot color (what else?) with a thin white head that lowers quickly and flattens out to nothing. Smell is sweet apricots, almost candy-like. Mouthfeel is a little thin, leading to a flavor that is sweet apricot, maybe too much like apricot and not enough like beer. The wheat flavor is diminished by the apricot. No hops come through, although there is a tingly bite in the finish, but it's not hoppy, sort of tannic. A bit like apricot juice."
"Average body and it went down nice and smooth. Really a nice little treat."
"Overall- not a bad summer brew. Magic Hat's #9 is better though."
"Beer is good. Happy apricot beering."
"Pours a clear, dark gold with a foamy white head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves no lace. The best part of this beer is the smell... about as close as you can get to fresh, ripe apricots. The taste is also dominated by apricot flavor, but it's surprisingly not as sweet as expected. Wheat and malt flavors are also there, but the apricot is dominant. Minimally hopped. Slight sour aftertaste. I'd recommend that anybody try this beer at least once. It's a nice novelty. But, I don't think it will be one of my regulars!"
"Served up in a stubby pilsner and poured a golden wheat color with heavy carbination. Very light head reduced to a light ring. Heavy fresh apricot scent- WOW! Tastes of frest fruits and of apricot nectar, but not too sweet. The flavor stays with you. Yeah, it is kind of girly sounding and may scare of alot of the guys, but if you buck up and try it, you may find that you actually like it. If you are one for the fruit beers it could work as a nice session beer."
"Small head is almost white, coarse, noisy. Beer is clear and a slightly orangey gold. A couple of small spots of lacing. Sweet, sweet apricot in the nose. Not much else of note. Apricot in the front. It's sweet, but not overly so. Fairly light, fruity middle leads to a nice, nutty, grainsy finish. Not a great aftertaste, though: a little sour, a little chemical. But I like it. It's a light, fresh, fruity, sweet-but-not-cloying beer."
"I probably couldn't drink too many of these in one sitting."
"Apricot Ale is not good beer, either in a general sense or when judged against other fruit beer. It needs to have a more substantial body and it needs to replace a large portion of its sourness with sweetness. Pyramid missed the mark with this one."
"Pours a clear honey tone color with a nice 1-1/2 finger white dense head. The smell consists of sweet apricot (of course) and a very faint grain, but not much else going on. Actually in a blind smell test, I don't think I would have known it was beer. The taste is again strong apricot with only a hint of malt, a very slight touch of hops, and a lot of carbonation. This is a very light bodied and is almost overwhelmingly sweet but still manages a tart dry finish. Not bad, but definitely not great. Cheers!"
"This beer has some great qualities. I like a few fruit beers and this is one of them. Have this on tap at Pyramid before Mariner games. The apperance is a reddish honey with a white head that dissapears but on tap this had great lacing throughout. The smell is of apricots and honey. Hops are sublte but are there. The taste is not to bad, sort of a citrus and apricots with malty aftertaste. Fells fruity but dull in the mouth. Can drink a couple of these but a little to fruity than I would like. One of the best Pyramid all year beers though."
"Overall and interesting and unique brew. A little too in your face for my liking, (sweet apricots). I've passed this beer numerous times in the beer isles throughout the years and glad I finally gave it a try. I would be very curious to taste this baby in the Pacific NW on tap, I'm sure I'd be singin' a different tune."
"Poured a semi - cloudy pale golden yellow with a small head. Beautiful aroma of sweet, ripe apricot nectar with a touch of zesty lemon. The taste is light and is undeniably flavored with apricots. Light in body thatÂ’s sweetened with fruit. ItÂ’s wonderful how the fruit flavor is incorporated into this beer. ItÂ’s done perfectly. Not overly sweet, nor underdone. A sweet nectar tang is left on the tongue. Light, fruity and a very refreshing treat of a beer. Very nice."
"This was one of my first ""favorites", many years back when I was first breaking into the wonderful world of decent beer. I picked up a a single and conclude that while this is a good beginner's craft brew, it lacks in character overall. Pours a cloudy, warm honey color with sparse carbonation and a weak, white head. No lacing is apparent. Smell is of apricot flavoring with a malty warmth that barely tickles the nose. Not too impressive. The taste is thankfully somewhat better. With the same sweet, yet odd, apricot taste in the forefront. There is a decent bready backbone here and a finish of citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is likewise refreshing, and the low-ish carbonation level allows a nice, though hardly complex, suite of flavors to be expressed. A note of pineapple and a creamy smoothness react interestingly on the palate. Drinkability is decent, but it's really more of a Summer beer. Refreshing and overall of satisfactory quality. No more, no less."
"Drinkability: Unbelievably good beer. This is a beer that could dethrone my beloved SA cherry wheat as my fave fruit beer. This beer seems to have it all, good fruit taste that isn't just a sugar coated syrup taste, a nice ""beer"" flavor that is complemented by the fruitiness. Wow."
"OK, I don't generally like fruit beers, but I like apricots -- so I gave it a try. Apricot colored, apricot smelling, apricot tasting -- right down to a sweet, syrupy film on the lips -- I'd have to say that you'd BETTER like apricots to drink this beer. If you do, however, you should be pleased, as I was. It was a little thin in the mouthfeel department, but otherwise a very enjoyable brew (assuming the like of apricots, of course)."
"It poured an orangeish haze into my glass with an off white head. I could smell apricots, but it seemed more like peaches to me. The taste was actually pretty good. Peaches and apricots, not too sweet with a touch of tang. It was pretty good, I would drink this agian."
"Very nice."
"Let me preface this review by saying that this is my girlfriend's second favorite beer (behind Rogue Imperial Pilsner). Pours a golden orange with an off-white head. Sweetish apricot malts dominate the palate, with some light tanginess. Not too bad. Taste is more of the, you guessed it, apricots, but with a crisp, tangy wheat side. Not too sweet though (good), and actually quite enjoyable. Surprisingly much better than several of the other Pyramid beers I've had."
"12 oz dark bottle says ""Enjoy by 12/12/03"". Pours a murky golden color into the glass. Head quickly leaves. Aroma of fresh apricots is very pronounced. Mouthful is very well balanced between apricots and carbonation. Some hoppy tingles as well. No lacing on the glass. This is a very good tasting wheat beer that matches well with the fresh apricot dominance. Not at all syrupy or cloying. Don't bother with this one if you don't like apricots. The hops continue to tingle the tongue to the very end. Clear finish and pleasant aftertaste. Feels light like a summer weiss. Very drinkable. This would be an excellent summer ale."
"A very good fruit beer. Personally, I have never had an apricot in my life, but this apricot beer was very light and tasty. They got it right where Leinie's BerryWeise got it wrong. Beer first, fruit second. I got this in a US microbrew sampler pack, and I would like to try more from Pyramid."
"A decent fruit beer. The apricot and wheat go together nicely."
"This beer comes out a hazy orange color, with a white foamy head on top. The smell is totally apricots. That goes for the flavor as well. This goes with a tangy feel up front. Its got a pretty smooth feel to it, but i cant say i would want more than a couple of these at a time."
"Golden brown, medium head. Apricot nose. Wheat ale with and apricot flavor, slight hoppyness. Mild slightly sweet apricot flavor, yet maltyness of beer still is evident. Definitely a fruit beer, and not something you would want to drink everyday, but it is a beer that should at least be sampled once. It is light and refreshing and sweet. Good for a desert beer."
"Give this beer a try."
"Appears a golden orange apricot hue with a bright white creamy healthy sized head that leaves annular rings of lacing between sips. Aromatics are sweet candi like apricot jam along with a light bready characteristic to it, low on hops but very nice would classify as a dessert beer for myself. This style of beer fruit wheat, usually rubs me the wrong way but this one I am definitely enjoying the apricot flavor is not overbearing but it glides with a tangy citrusy zing and just blends well together very nice beer kicks Pyramid Hefeweizen's ass. Touch of hops and keeps it sweet with a sour edge from the citrus like tones not cloying in anyway, the mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is just right can't complain here. Drinkability not bad not a session brew but a nice treat wasn't expecting much here, es muy bueno."
"I had this on a summer evening on a buddy's front lawn. It is a very pleasant beer that is well balanced. The apricot was not overpowering for me, more of an added taste in the mix. A very fine beer on a very nice night before going to see a free concert in the park. Personally I rank below this Dogfish Aprihop and Magic Hat No. 9. I recall the Dogfish having a nicer hop finish while retaining great balance. Pyramid ranks 3rd for me, but getting a bronze isn't bad."
"Pours a yellow/orange color with very little head to speak of,the aroma is very up front of apricots or apricot puree.The taste is also very apricot like with a slight wheaty taste in the finish.A little light in the body but also very drinkable.Iam not a big fan of these kind of beers but it was worth trying."
"Overall this one's about average. Not great, but not bad at all. I would give this one to people who aren't really in to beer in the hopes of turning them on to other micros. I'd say it's better than Pete's Strawberry Blonde, not quite as good as Sam Adam's Cherry Wheat."
"Sampled from a bottle dated 9/28/03. The aroma for this beer is amazing - very sweet apricots, with a hint of tartness. Pours a hazy/clouded orange with a little bit of sediment at the bottom of the glass. Small head. Pyramid Apricot is warm and sweet initially, with a sour aftertaste - maltiness and a little bit of hops. Unfortunately, as this beer warms, the carbonation becomes very noticeable (seltzer-like?) and the apricot taste fades into a more sour, unpleasant flavor. Average mouthfeel. At $5.99 for a six-pack at my local store, this is a great beer to bring to parties or to use to introduce friends to better beer. I probably won't buy it again for personal consumption, but its worth having a six pack on hand."
"I was told this was a good beer by a friend of mine. I told him that I didn't like apricots too much and he said that it didn't matter because it was such a good beer. I don't know what the hell he was thinking. It looked fine on the pour nothing great but decent enough. But the aroma was all apricots. And so was the taste. It reminded me of apricot jam. I don't taste any beer here. Is this supposed to be a beer? Slight notes of bread in the flavor. Finishes a little yeasty. But there's too much apricot for me to handle. I will never drink this crap again."
"This is a surprisingly good fruit beer. The name is very descriptive as the color is that of apricot, the nose follows suit, and the flavor is heavily apricot, but not in a sugary or overly sweet manner. The look is a cloudy apricot with a moderate off white head and nice lacing. The body is medium and the beer finishes quite crisply with a nice, dry letoff. This is an easily drinkable beer that could serve as a steady date on lazy summer afternoons."
"I was cajoled into splitting a pitcher of this at my favorite local place last week. Fruit beers, although good by the glass hardly ever move me to purchase an entire pitcher, especially on blind faith. Let me say however, that I had no problem reaching for a second pint of this beer. The taste is very smooth and the first sniff is of sweet apricots and subtle zest. There is a decent hop character that is never prevalent, but does nicely in the aftertaste. I was expecting a heavy sweetness, but it is not here. Pyramid has done a nice job with creating a flavorful fruit beer that is easily drinkable and refreshing."
"Nice apricoty sweet smell. Poured a gold color with some slight orange highlights. Head is large but fades quickly. Wheat is evident in the front of the tongue. As beer slides back in the mouth, apricot comes through only slightly. On the back of the tongue, a tangy bitterness was perceived. Light-medium mouthfeel. Overall a very drinkable beer that should have as much apricot in the flavor as it does in the nose."
"This is a great summer beer to relax by the pool or on the porch with."
"12oz bottle. Poured out the color of apricots, with a massive head. That slowly receded. Aroma is apricots, with some malt thrown in there, with a little hops. Taste is slightly malty, slightly hoppy, but definetly apricotty sweet. A little too sweet for my taste. Not bad, but not something I could have very often."
"Like I said, I've gone back to this beer over and over again, over the years, and I probably will continue to do so. I'm a sucker for apricots."
"Though weak in some departments this is an extremelly drinkable beer..when your dog tired."
"Poured a nice orange color and somewhat cloudy. Not much head but the high carbonation kept the bubbles coming. The smell is impressive, nothing like I've ever smelled in a beer before, somewhat sweet aroma. The taste is exceptional. You can taste the sweet apricot flavor allthough not as strong as you'd expect in an ale. The mouthfeel is just as good as the taste, if not better. You're left with the nice sweet apricot flavor after each sip. This is a great beer, now one of my favorites. I will definately have this again soon."
"F."
"The taste of this beer is so interesting with a great blend of sweetness and hops. Its hard to figure how long it must of took to get the recipe so balanced. I love the apricot feel on the tongue, like eating an apricot or pear. Gets tiny little bumps of almost fuzz like things covering your tongue. Very interesting. Very crisp, smooth, and a hoppy aftertaste that fights with the apricot, but in a good way. This a very good, interesting beer, I recommend it if you like any other kind of fruit beers. But if you don't like apricots or pears its best you don't try it. But who doesn't like those?"
"Living in Berkeley for the past 4.5 years, you cannot avoid trying a Pyramid brand beer. This is what I call a Chick Beer because those are the folks you usually see drinking it, them and the folks who drink Smirnoff Ice.. The color is a nice amber and looks good in a glass. The aroma is overpowered by the apricots, not much else there. The same can be said for the taste. A little too sweet for me, almost wine-like in taste. Pretty much what you taste is the apricot. Good thing to try but only if it is free at a party. It is good but I won't ever spend money on it. If you have a lot of non beer drinking girls coming to your party you should serve it up, they should like it, but keep the ""real beer"" for yourself."
"Cloudy, ""dirty"" orange color beer pours with a very nice, creamy head that slowly fades to a layer of thin foam. The nose is prety much all about apricots. I tried hard to smell something else, but that's all there is. The taste is again very much apricot up front, but a nice wheat crispness shows up behind it. A slightly sour finish was surprising, as I figured all the apricot would be too sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, even for the wheat beer that this is based upon. However, the very fine bubbles of the carbonation help offset the thinness a bit. The drinakbility is good, but I don't think I'd want too many of these. I had avaioded this beer a bit because I was unsure of the apricot ale label. I wish I had tried it sooner, becuase it isn't all that bad. Everyone should try it at least once."
"$1.49/12 oz single"
"When poured, it had a hazy reddish golden color with very little foam. The smell was of apricots and malts, with a hint of hops. The flavor of apricot dominated the taste, mixed with malts and citrus. The sweetness that was supplied by the malts and citrus. The correct bitterness supplied by the hops, which balance out this fruity beer was interesting! Must try it just once at least!"
"Pours a lovely hazy golden color with a creamy white head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is dominated by fresh apricot. Taste is sweet malts with fruity notes of apricot, banana, and citrus. Finish is crisp with a bit of a sweet aftertaste. A very refreshing brew that would make a great summertime beer."
"Prosit!"
"Unfortunately, the beer craft is sparse, as the flavors disappear in a hurry. Although that might be a selling point. Flawless, if uninspiring."
"Pours a reasonably attractive apricot color, slightly cloudy with a sparse head and persistent yet sparse carbonation.  Aroma is dominated by apricot scents.  Where is the beer?  The taste does not answer that question either, as the sweet apricot taste overwhelms the underlying wheat.  Only toward the end does one get a hint of a little dryness--too little, too late.  Mouthfeel is fine, but drinkability is poor for a beer.  This might be a fine drink, but it's not a fine beer."
"There is a hops presence, but it is so muted as not to warrant much mention at all."
"Let's see. I like beer. I dislike apricots. Apparently I dislike apricots more than I like beer. Hazy apricot color with minimal head. Points for color that matches the flavor though. I am generally not a fan of fruit beers."
"I like fruit beers and this one is very good. I am leery of recommending this type of drink but if you have never had a fruity-beer this one would be a fine choice to start with."
"Pyramid Apricot: Cloudy, tan beer.  Aroma is nothing but Apricots.  Taste is surprisingly well balanced, and the apricot does not overwhelm the rest of the beer, at all.  Fairly highly carbonated, with a sweet aftertaste. This is a shock, a fruit beer that I do not hate.  Worth a look."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Murky, chunky bright orange color.  Fast rising small bubbles that keep restoring a thin head.  Smells like, well, apricot.... Flavor is more subtly apricot, with a carbonated impression that releases the most at the back of the swallow. There was a carbonated water impression to me in mid-mouth.  Wheat tastes are minimal and just the slightest of bittering at the finish.  A controlled fruit beer but I can't highly recommend it because of the carbonated water taste.  I honestly prefer this directly from the bottle, it seems to concentrate the apricot flavors (if fruit is your thing)."
"Not bad as fruit beers go."
"The apricot flavor is a little too strong for me.  But it is refreshing"
"Very nice apricot aroma - like fresh juice had been added to the ale.  The fruit element is well balanced, lending a softly sweet, fruity note without taking on the candy/soda pop sweetness I seem to find in most fruit flavored ales.   A good choice as a pre-meal drink."
