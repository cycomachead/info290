"As for the taste, the pumpkin spices seem emerged in the cherry or juicy fruitiness.  Again, it could be due to the past-freshness of this bottle."

"not overly spicy, faint pumpkin taste, very drinkable"
""

"Pumpkin Lager pours a copper color with a very small but lacing head.  There is a nice mellow pumpkin aroma.  The taste has a nice mellow but noticeable pumpkin flavor.  Good body and good feel.  Overall its not over the top, its just a very nice pumpkin beer."

"Overall:  Decent pumpkin beer.  The lager smooths things out too."
"Heavy on the spice, not so much on the beer"

"O - Definitely spiced, definitely pumpkin, and definitely a lager.  This beer feels slightly lighter but keeps a creamy body despite the easy drinkability and never feels overpowering.  The high(er) ABV lends a bit of warmth to the finish and is reminiscent of classic Marzen-style lagers.  Not an earth-shattering experience, but a very nice take on the style and lends enough uniqueness to outshine others in this genre."
"O - This beer was better than I expected. Good beer, quite drinkable, a good place to start for pumpkin beer newbies. While it's not at the top of the pumpkin beer list it's a good representation of the style. I'd drink it again."

"I really enjoy the clean pumpkin flavor on this easy drinking lager, a little lighter in flavor than most but I like that it's different"

"A pleasant spiced seasonal pumpkin brew, you pretty much wouldn't know this was a lager unless the label said so - I've had plenty of lighter-seeming pumpkin ales.  Perhaps a bit drier than the impression I have thus far given, which makes this something that I could see having a few of, come time to dole out the goods to the trolling neighborhood kiddies."

"Edit, I'm eating a tuna sandwich now finishing up this beer. It actually pairs well with that, so it's not a totally ""by itself"" beer. This one was easy to finish. Bottoms up!"

"Overall:  Too light, too sweet and too much spice relative to the underlying flavors but I guess that's what happens with a pumpkin lager; not a fan"
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange-yellow in color with a small white head. Nice 'ring' lacing is seen with each sip and sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin. Pretty much for the taste as well with LOTS of good flavor. Medium bodied and perfect carbonation. Goes down easy and really tasty! A EASY '9' if not higher for this one. You can actually count the number of 'rings' from each sip, which turned out to be 11! Love it! :)"

"O - This is a decent pumpkin beer. The mouthfeel is watered down though."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. I like the crispness of it and the well balanced spices."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing special here. It's not the worst pumpkin beer I've ever had but t's also far from the best. The spice overload is a bit too much to enjoy."

"I like beer, so this should be right up my alley! I gave it a good heavy handed pour, resulting in two fingers of creamy, tawny head with great retention. Color was a pumpkin-like orangish-amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. I know that 8 is between 7 and 9, but my card does not have that shade. Nose was VERY spicy, cinnamon, clove and ginger being prevalent. Mouthfeel was much fuller than the Stoudt's pumkin lager, giving this one a creamy aspect. The spices were just right, not overwhelming and by closing my eyes, I could imagine drinking a cool pumpkin latte. This is a great pumpkin lager, but don't tell Linus or he might be panicked! Get it, a Great Pumpkin lager? Finish was semi-dry, but because they showed some restraint at the spice shelf, it was not as dry as it might have been."
""
""
"I'd rate a cider with these properties higher, but I expected more from a beer..."
""
""
"O: This beer has a really nice flavor to it and is quite enjoyable - nice combination of pumpkin pie spices, pumpkin, and cardamon. Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol. Definitely recommend this one for a quite enjoyable brew for a fall evening. Great with ginger snaps after dinner."
"I believe that ales are always more flavorful than lagers and the only mistake that Lakefront made here was to introduce this as a lager. I find real flavor and appeal it's just too weak."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: i think this is just mediocre in all aspects. Not above and beyond in any particular way, but more a bunch of okay aspects that make for an okay beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy peachy copper with a white fizzy foam that retains well. Light aroma of pumpkin spices and bready lager yeast. In the taste, crispness of lager yeast upfont, spices mid palate, and finishes with pumpkin flavor. Light cinnamon and allspice. Crisp, solid pumpkin lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"So many better fall/pumpkin themed brews out there...."
""
""
"This is a much better pumpkin beer than I was expecting. It is an amber orange color with a small but respectable white head. The aroma is sweetish, with a grainy lager background ans a sweep pumpkin pie forenose. Spice, honey, pie, reminiscent cream, and crust. Interesting and enjoyable. The sweetness could get a little overwhelming, but in small volumes, this is great. Smooth and flavorful. I would easily have another."
""

"O- This is actually much better than I thought. I had a beer tasting the other night where eight of us sampled 21 pumpkin beers. This was the onl;y lager and I was very surprised. I am drinking a full serving tonight and enjoying. I expected a Molsen Canadien that tasted like it had allspice and nutmeg mixed in. I was very wrong. This can stand up to the ales, and in some cases beat them any day. Try this, it is a different approach, but a good one!"
""

"Average pumpkin beer - I don't think I would purchase this again."
""

"This is a fairly decent pumpkin beer, no more no less. I wouldn't buy this again."

"O: 3.25 this is a good pumpkin lager, very crisp and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this to be an easy-drinking pumpkin beer that has a good balance between the pumpkin flavors and spices. It would make for a good beer to pair with an autumn-themed dinner."
""
""
""
""
"I absolutely love this one. One of two (Southern Tier ""Pumpking"") pumpkin biers I will drink. The addition of pumpkin to the mash allows this lager to showcase the pumpkin with a clarity that is unparalleled. This bier made me like pumpkin pie. When I drink this, I know it's Autumn."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I wouldn't recommend this one for someone looking for the ultimate pumpkin beer. But if you wanted a taste of the season without getting full, then this would be your beer."
""
""
"O:One of the lower rated pumpkins I tried in 2013."
"Overall - not a bad fall pumpkin beer, but perhaps if it wasn't a lager some of the spice smell and flavor would be stronger"
""
"Overally -- a nicely balanced pumpkin beer. Not much going on other than some malt sweetness to balance out the spices, but that's what I like from a pumpkin ale. I'd buy this again."
""
"Taste- Spices up front light cinnamon and cloves stand above the rest. A bit of grassy or hay like flavor with a tiny bit of malt character of bread and caramel. This is a lager so finishes pretty clean."
""
"O - Lakefront Pumpkin Lager is a exceptionally crafted pumpkin beer that takes the richness of pumpkin ale and drops it back a few notches, creating a great start-of-fall beverage that's still drinkable and refreshing in warm weather but, with the pumpkin and spice, remains great when it cools down. Also a good ""beginner"" pumpkin beer for those who want to get their feet wet, and one of my personal favorites of the season!"
"A excellent beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours an orange-red, totally clarified, with a waifish head that fizzles away quickly. On the nose you've got cinnamon first and foremost. If you really get in there it's like a stick of Big Red. Underneath that is that is an earthy, leafy aroma. Smells sweet and spicy. Man, you can really taste the pumpkin in this, and the spice, and I think I'm getting the alcohol coming through pretty prominently for...what is this, a six? Sweet and a little malty otherwise. Nice mouthfeel, good flavor but light and refreshing - I think you could have a few of these without getting burnt out. I like this one quite a bit, really goes down easy. Not like an amazing pumpkin beer, but worth picking up for the season. I'll probably buy some more while it's out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have tried other beers - pumpkin ales (not lagers) - that seem to fall short in pumpkin flavor that I'm looking for; it seems it only add a tiny dash of pumpkin pie spice and nothing more. However this may be what it's supposed to be and maybe my preferences are different than others who enjoy pumpkin beers. This beer never fails to please me."
""
""
"O: yet another over-spiced pumpkin beer, and this one is of the more subtle lager variety, making the imbalance more of an issue. Nonetheless, the well-chosen mix of spices will appeal to those who like spicy pumpkin beers."
"This pumpkin ale is pretty average. A little heavy on certain spices, but a decent beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an ok beer. Nothing bad and its different but doesn't push any boundaries."
""
""
""
"Lakefront is better than some pumpkin beers I’ve encountered. It has an easy drinkability and smooth mouthfeel, but is lacking some of the depth that these beers deserve."
"basically just another pumpkin beer, nothing special though refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A simple tasting pumpkin beer with a good taste and even better palate. Check it out if you get the chance."
""
"O: Not going to bowl you over in the end, drinkable, spiced enough to give you some appreciation of that pumpkin feel and easy enough balanced for multiples. worthy a single try."
""
""
""

""

"Poured into NB Globe. Appearance is a clear orange with a layer of white head. Some lacing present. Nose pairs familiar pumpkin spices along with a grainy lager base. Cinnamon and all spice come through the most. One significant difference between this and other pumpkin brews is having a lager as a base. This provides a grainy and bready profile instead of a sweet base. The taste features some brown sugar sweetness along with cinnamon. The spice is present but not in your face. The flavor tapers off and has a dry bready finish. Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Overall, I prefer my pumpkin brews in the form of ale, but this isn't a bad by any measure."
""
""
"Overall, a unique take on a pumpkin beer but the spices are a bit too much. I think if the spice was toned down it would allow more subtle characters to come through. Really nice job by Lakefront."
""
"The weakness here is we got a lager. This is better than the average lager, but the lager has weaker flavor compared to the good ale pumpkin beers. However, this would do in a pinch. I would like this beer on a hot summer day. It's very refreshing. Goes down well with summer jazz fest music like Joe Zawinul music."
""
""
""
"The spices outshine in this one and the ginger really in my opinion shines the most. Its good but just wish it was a bit less tart. It was an interesting beer that'd I'd have again next year at Halloween time no problem."
"It's like a pumpkin pie baked by a middle school home ec class. It's edible, since it's pumpkin pie and honestly I'd eat pumpkin pie that had been dropped on the floor. But the seasoning hints towards a complete lack of experience on behalf of the people who baked it, like they just raided the spice cabinet and started pouring things in all willy nilly."
""
"O: This isn't amazing but it was better than the couple of pumpkin ales I had the other night. The pumpkin and spice aroma is great."
""
"Overall: An average pumpkin beer that smells really good but the taste does not follow up at the same level. Not bad, but nothing out of the ordinary. I will pass in the future."
""
"Color is a clear amber with an average head. The smell is a mix of spices that's hard to pin down - maybe nutmeg, maybe some cinnamon. The taste is slightly sweet, but not overly so. Cinnamon seems to come through the strongest, with slight grass and bread flavors typical of a lager. Not very complex, but nothing offensive either. Thin mouthfeel. Not too bad, certainly drinkable, but nothing memorable going on here."
""
"Overall, I'm not blown away by this, but nor am I offended. It's actually a pretty sessionable affair, and the mouthfeel really is nice. I get cinnamon the most here, and it's got a nice spicy kick to it."
""
"Pours a clear orange, with a medium off-white head. Smells slightly of stewed veggies, with some pie spice. Taste is an initial candy sweetness, followed by a bit of cinnamon and vanilla. There is a bit of grain after that, and some nutmeg in a semi-sweet finish. Mouthfeel is nicely rich. Overall a pretty good beer."
""
"Most pumpkin beers are ales, but this lager offering is a nice spicy treat that is light enough to be sessionable at a Halloween party."
""
""
""
"Pours transparent amber in color with a minimal white head that soon disappears completely. The bouquet is actually quite nice, with healthy doses of pumpkin and cinnamon, with some nutmeg. There is also a tartness to the aroma, the origin of which I am curious to discern in the palate. The flavor largely matches the aroma, but is more subdued. The pumpkin takes a bit of a back seat to the spices, but the blend works well nonetheless. I think the tartness detected in the nose may actually be afforded by the cinnamon, which is not a spice I have much familiarity with when it comes to beers. The mouthfeel could be a little more substantive, but on the whole this is a well balanced and easy to drink brew, and one of the more palatable pumpkin beers I've tried."
"Overall I would drink this beer again. Not great in the same light of a lot of imperial pumpkin ales, but pretty damn good as far as a lighter pumpkin brew goes."

"O: A middle-of-the-road attempt at a seasonal style; it doesn’t really make me want another, and to be honest, it’s not making me crazy about seeking out other Lakefront beers. I’ll probably keep my eyes open for some though, especially their IPA – I heard it's worth a look."
""
""
"This beer is exactly what a lager is in respect to smell and taste. The appearance was close to a light orange/dark gold consistency. The beer had little aromaticity in regard to the being a pumpkin beer. I caught a hint of some spices. I honestly would expect to be able to smell the pumpkin or some floral/nutty undertones. This beer did not have that aspect. The taste was like a smooth a normal lager style beer. It didnt have much bite back and was very smooth. Overall, I just wasnt impressed with the beer itself. I think pumpkin beer should at least have scent and taste of pumpkin."
""
""
"Nice to see Lakefront beer in my area now.Poured one and a half bottles into a 1/2 liter stein,deep burnt orange with almost no head to speak of,just a thin off white sheet.Alot of spice in the nose,mainly cinnamon and cardamom I pick up,not much different than many pumpkin beer out there.Spiced with a dryer than expected malt base wich kept the sweetness in check but the finish lacks any real depth.Alot of cinnamon flavors but the thinner feel to the beer actualy keeps it from being overbearing,in saying that it's pretty average and light."
""
"Overall - Really like this one. It delivers what I want in a pumpkin lager. The pumpkin and spices are there but they aren't overpowering. It all sits very well. This is clean, refreshing and very drinkable. I'd certainly pick this up again."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Pretty good. Started out better than HornyCopia, which I was sampling along with this. Lacked a good finish."
""
"Overall: I tried about 5 or 6 of these over the last few days and they all run together and seem to taste the same with subtle differences. This is on of the more bland ones, but still just another pumpkin beer."
""
"O: Pretty good pumpkin beer, probably overlooked due to the lack of art work and familiarity with the brewer. But this beer is spot on for the season purpose, not the best pumpkin, but far from the worst."
"I poured thsi beer into a pint glass, it has a nice deep, rich coper color body, with a small tannish head that hanged around for a little while. The aroma is mainly pumpkin pie spices with a little bit of pumpkin flavor. The taste is almost like a pumpkin pie but has a little more malt flavor towards the bakc of the tongue. The mouth feel is good and overall a decent pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
"Overall- Lakefront does another quality job with a spiced beer. A pumpkin lager that gives a spot on representation of a warm pumpkin pie. The slight warming is a magnificent touch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I feel this beer's best quality is it is visual very attractive. Great color, clarity and good head for the style. Next is mouth feel smooth with a spicy bite at the end. Not surprised of the lack of pumpkin in this beer. The rest is solid but nothing to write home about. Overall average not my favorite as far as the pumpkin category but ranks high in my lager category. I'm just not a lager guy."
""
"There are better pumpkin brews."
"This poured out as a Clear looking amber color. The head was a little on the soapy looking side. The lacing was minimal and the retention wasn't overly impressive. The smell of the beer has some lager yeast aromas as well as the traditional pumpkin spice notes. The taste of the beer has an earthy spiced flavor through that mixed with the sweetness of the malts. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side with I feel it should be heavier. Overall this isn't a bad brew, just not one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M. Lighter side of medium body, heavier side of medium carbonation. Crisp feel overall."
""
""
""
""
"A very well-spiced Pumpkin Lager. Oh yeah … it's a lager. Easy to drink for what it is. When it comes to spiced beer, it's pretty subjective on whether you want more than one—but we could see having more than one. There is depth, but lightness as well, two worlds that should have met a long time ago perhaps."

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a slightly orange, dark yellow straw colored. Very slight haze as well. Started with a 2 finger off white head that faded to none after a few minutes. Aroma was a sweet pumpkin with small hints of spice, mostly like a pie puree. Taste was slightly sweet, but fairly bland, akin to a bland bread. Felt a bit over tingly in the mouth, but coated well. Overall a middle of the road pumpkin beer. Nothing outstanding in any direction."

"This beer is not too sweet and not too savory this beer can go well with savory foods such as turkey and be a great dessert beer or just to drink around."
"Overall: This beer is very well-blended and mellow. Nothing is overpowering or out of balance/proportion. A rarity among pumpkin beers!"
"Overall- As far as pumpkin beers go, it starts out really promising. It smells good, but it doesn't translate on the palate. There is an adjunct wheat quality in the finish that throws this thing off kilter, and the spices are not nearly noticeable enough."
"O: This is one of those inoffensive, mostly forgettable beers."
"Notes: It's spiced so well all the way around what a tasty beer. Cheers."
"bummer. my first pumpkin beer of the season was brewed in wisconsin? purchased in golden, colorado. the flavor was entirely too spiced, like pumpkin in a can, and the beer had a filling malty element to it. i cant say i hate it, because i dont at all, but i had higher hopes for the inaugural brew of the season. dont think i could do a 6pack of this, the drinkability wasnt there. at least my palate is ready to go now!"
"O: Not a very good beer. It isn't offensive, but it's bland and lacking any depth."
"O: Like others have said, far from the best pumpkin beer I've had but also far from the worst. Overall I enjoyed it."
"O- Not terrible but it didn't really taste like a pumpkin ale."
"This isn't the best pumpkin ale I've ever had, but it's far from the worst. If you see it, give it a go and see for yourself."
"Honestly, I think this is the first time I've seen a pumpkin lager before... Regardless, it pours a mostly clear bright brass topped by a finger of pale off-white foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, light white bread, light caramel, sweet flowers, clove, and a touch of mildly tart orange flesh. Nice and spicy, baby. The taste brings in more of the same, with the bread coming in lightly toasted, the orange toning down the tartness, and the caramel coming in a bit stronger. There's not much actual pumpkin in here, if at all, but the spices are definitely present in spades. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a surprisingly tasty and drinkable brew, one that really embraces the spicy side of pumpkin beers without going too far with it. Well done."
"Sweet but not cloying, definite holiday spices, some heavier malts, which is good, less pumpkin than other beers yet more flavor overall than most. Medium body, tingly carbonation, and some stickiness is delovely. Yup delovely. Like it a bit. Recommend it."
"O- Seems like a routine fruit beer. Nothing made me think of pumpkin really, and there is certainly nothing objectionable about it."
"M- sweetens with time, easy to drink but the flavor and scent are difficult to pinpoint. Very floral but not pumpkin."
"Drinkability: Not enough body for me and the fact that this is a lager takes away some of the balance that I want out of a pumpkin. The flavors are a tad too flat for my liking. I haven't had this beer in a number of years and my remembrance of the taste has not changed."
"O- Overall, this is my first pumpkin beer of 2011 and it was a nice one to start the season out with."
"(O) This is what pumpkin beer should taste like. One of my favorites. Just like pumpkin pie. It's right up there with Pumking, in my opinion. One of the top pumpkin beers on my list."
"Pours an orange amber color with a thin off white head. Aromas of baking spice, a little bready and finally some vegetal/pumpkin on the tail end. Spices dominate this beer, especially the cinnamon. I still am able to detect some pumpkin on the palate and as this is a pumpkin lager as opposed to the more popular ale it finishes pretty clean. Overall a nice pumpkin beer and the first one i have had in a couple seasons."
"Overall: I did read from some of the other reviews on here that some people did pick up on almost a crust-like flavor in the background. I do get that impression from this one. All in all, this is a good seasonal selection. personally i would like it if this was an all year beer instead of a seasonal."
"Serviceable pumpkin beer, served Labour Day weekend t the brewery. Light colour,lacey with almost no head. Spicy pumpkin and cloves. In the style and better than some pumpkin beers, though not the best representative. OK drinkability, must be in the mood to finish a half pint."
"I am not a fan of this beer style, it seems like it is just some novelty that grew out of proportion but this isn't bad."
"O - ok. Not bad. But it will do in a pinch for a nice fall beer."
"Overall: Lager + pumpkin = interesting combination. The crisp nature coupled with the fall spices plays out like an homage to summer gone and fall coming. It's stuck somewhere in the middle of good and meh."
"O: Too much of the lager comes through without enough of the pumpkin. The spices are there, but it's not the greatest balance or combination."
"O) I have found most of the pumpkin beers I've tried to be a little to spiced for my liking. This one really hits the spot. It pains me to say this, but... Paul, you were right."
"This one pours a very light bodied bright copper in color with a one finger off white head. The aromas are very sweet and full of spice. It has the generic pumpkin vibe and is kind of syrupy sweet. The flavors again are all spice, a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg with a moderate amount of sweetness and a somewhat artificial pumpkin flavor. It's ok but doesn't really resemble pumpkin pie or anything like some other pumpkin beers do. It drinks very light and smooth. For being a lager I expected it to be a little more crisp. The flavor is decent but overall this one doesn't compare to other pumpkins."
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to an oily film. Small areas of lace slide back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is very spice heavy with cinnamon and cloves being most prominent and some light pumpkin pie aromas. Taste is cinnamon forward with some light malt and somewhat artificial pumpkin flavors on the finish. Aftertaste is pretty much like you get after chewing cinnamon gum and then spit it out. A higher level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good pumpkin beer. Interesting to see this is a lager and therefore doesn't quality under the pumpkin ale category."
"Overall: Not too bad for this style of beer, but not that great either. Easy to drink, but lacking the big flavors that other pumpkin ales have. As of late, it seems they divide these pumpkin beers into standard ones like this ale, and the imperial pumpkins which are bigger and more complex. Cheers!!"
"Overall: Not bad for a $1.49 however it does lack flavor"
"For my first pumpkin beer of the season its a little disappointing- tastes more like a lager with a bit of pumpkin versus a full-blown pumpkin ale. Nevertheless, not bad."
"Overall a decent pumpkin beer that is enjoyable but nothing amazing."
"D/O- Aside from the mouthfeel complaint this isn't a bad little pumpkin beer, especially for a lager. Quite refreshing. Would have been better to have this one and a couple more perhaps in the fall."
"Drinkability - Decent brew for a relatively standard Fruit/Veggie beer. I would rank this one and Wassatch's Punkin Ale up there with the best of the Pumpkin beers that I've tried."
"The taste has some slight pumpkin character in the background, though it's not all that sweet like many pumpkin beers. The taste is light ginger plus some caramel, nutmeg, allspice, and clove. Mildly bready as well. Fairly-light body with a carbonation level toward the low end. Light and not terribly drinkable."
"moderate carbonation and medium body. alright, if average brew to fill your spiced autumn brew needs."
"D-Don't ever need to try this again."
"Drinkability: Actually not as bad as the other features, but to be quite honest and not to bash the beer completely I'm not exactly the biggest fan of fruity toned beers, but other pumpkin style beers I had encountered so far since fall began has been nothing but good. Maybe next time, but I must say this brew is not for me for the time being. Cheers!"
"D/M: Nice crisp carbonation but the head really doesnt stick very well."
"Overall a pretty tasty, enjoyable brew."
"This is one of the better Pumpkin lagers i've had yet. They did a nice job on this beer, and the ABV is perfect."
"The finish is quite sweet: malty with a hint of creamy pumpkin. All in all, I'd put this lager up there with the more well-balanced, highly drinkable spiced beers."
"D. While you don't really get much pumpkin out of the beer, the spices are enough to make you think of fall. All in all I have to say that this is one of the more solid pumpkin beers I've had this year, which is saying something considering this is my 8th or 9th pumpkin beer."
"D: While this one doesn't stand out in the vast sea of pumpkin ales on the market, the Lakefront Pumpkin is underappreciated compared to the previous reviews on BA IMO."
"Lakefront Pumpkin Lager Beer (awful name btw) is a good pumpkin beer for people who love pumpkin spices. It is not very balanced and it has virtually no actual ""beer"" flavor. I will never understand why this is so popular, but who am I to judge. Its not for me and that's why I offer so many alternatives at the shop."
"Drink this isn't much of a drinker. 1 at a time is really enough for me even though I did have 3 in a sitting last night. Kind of became too much the spices really take over after the first one."
"D - This beer works for me, its a well made lager, as Lakefront is known to do. Manages to avoid being flabby like most pumpkin beers I've had, while still having the spice to make me think fall. The only complaint would be the apparent lack of actual pumpkin flavor, although I'm not sure if it's possible to naturally add that without taking away that characteristics that I love about this beer. Anways, best pumpkin beer I've had in a sixer so far, although still not quite as good as St. Ambroise The Great Pumpkin Ale and that nice light one.. what was it? Oh yeah, Pumking."
"D: This is an OK pumpkin beer. A good autumn offering from Lakefront."
"Drinkability: Overall, this beer has improved with aging in that the spices and the malt have softened and blended together well. It doesn't surprise me very much because Lakefront's Holiday Spice is also much better with a few years of aging than it is fresh from the brewery. This beer was just a big ""wow!"" when I opened it earlier today."
"drinkability is not good since there are plenty of other good/great pumpkin beers"
"D: Easily drinkable, just not very special. Would benefit from a little better balance."
"Generally with pumpkin ales/lagers the spice is done improperly and leaves me with a distaste. This is one of the few exceptions. Not something I'd seek out, but I drank the whole thing."
"Drinkable: No more than 1-2, kind of disappointed. Pumpkin and beer are 2 of my FAVORITE things; this beer was ordinary."
"One of the better pumpkin beers out there just because while the spices run the show, they aren't overwhelming. The sourness in the finish also helps to keep things moving, too."
"Having a bottle that's a couple years old so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. Very slight pop when opened and small tan head that quickly disappeared and no lace. Color is a hazy orange amber with a little sediment. Aroma is pumpkin pie spice with some natural pumpkin and malt. Flavor is like aroma but with some sour. Beer is turning/turned. Body is ok but carbonation is going flat. Finish is like flavor. I've had these fresh many times before and they're much better."
"The problem with the beer is the consistency between bottles. I have some that were awesome and some that were meh."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a ring, leaving traces of lace. Almost clear amber color. Pumpkin malt nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is a malty pumpkin, some sweetness. Bottled Sep 2009. $1.90 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"That levity brings a great finish/aftertaste to the beer, pumpkin spice maintains, you may even detect a sprinkling of vanilla? I dunno, but whatever it is, I like it. Remains drinkable, but I can't see having more than 2 in a sitting, due to the sweetness."
"Drinkability is good. Overall this is a pretty solid pumpkin beer. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Just beery enough and spicing is controlled, clean and drinkable for a spiced beer."
"Overall a very nice pumpkin beer. Granted it's the only pumpkin lager on the market so it's hard to compare. This is one of the least offensive pumpkin beers I've had."
"Overall a nice offering at a pumpkin. A good job by Lakefront"
"If you like pumpkin beers I'd suggest this one from Lakefront."
"The body on this one is a little thin, but this aids in drinkability as this is quite refreshing. This is a very good pumpkin beer. The pumpkin is there, but not overpowering in any way. The spices are muted as well. There's a very pleasant honey-kissed bready aftertaste that I really dig. I think this is my favorite pumpkin-flavored beer to date. Thanks again, Andy."
"Picked up a single bottle for a couple bucks at Princeton Liquors. The beer looked great after pouring - clear pumpkin orange with a tall white head. The aroma and flavor are heavily spice, like most beers in the style, but not over the top. It can be a bit hard to pick out the pumpkin in between the nutmeg and cinnamon, but it's here with a creamy candy pie taste. It reminds me of a slightly better Jack's Pumpkin Spice from A-B. All in all, a respectable pumpkin ale, but it could use more actual pumpkin flavor."
"D- Not my favorite of the style, but not bad either...I'd try it again..."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, not the biggest fan of pumpkin beers but this one as drinkable as any other I've had."
"Final thoughts: Pretty boring pumpkin beer, with light tastes, lots of syrup like tastes and flavorings, semi sweet, low carbonation, low spices at least, and it's so called lager but I really don't get much for lager tastes or crisp refreshingness."
"Drinkability: While this is (IMO) a very balanced pumpkin brew, I was hoping for a bit more of a sweet pumpkin taste as that is my preference. That being said, this beer is rather drinkable, however not my number one choice when reaching for pumpkin."
"A very drinkable pumpkin beer. Perfect for a crisp fall afternoon."
"Pours a clear orange-amber with a one finger head that dies down very fast leaving nothing behind, no blanket and no lacing at all, looks like a glass of juice after a few minutes. Smells of pumpkins, fruits and malts, maybe some nutmeg too. I get a hint of funk/kriek for some reason too. Tastes of pumpkin, malts, nutmeg, some strange citrus/fruit taste that makes the beer taste more artificial, some sweetness too. Mouthfeel is a bit light with a pretty large carbonation bite and no alcohol warming. Drinkability is alright, not the best taste, not a bad price, the taste seems to die down after a bit and go to very sweet pumpkin taste, probably wont get this one again."
"I had this beer at the Institute in Philadelphia on draft. I have to say this was hands down the best pumpkin beer I've had this year (which includes, Southern Tier's Pumking, Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale, and a couple others that escape my memory). Lakefront's pumpkin beer is smooth with a real pumpkin flavor without being too sweet. Most of the others were only vaguely pumpkiny with the alcohol and spices drowning out the pumpkin flavor. this one highlights the pumpkin flavor without overburdening it with high alcohol or choking the flavor with spices."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours an clear, orange-amber body with a thin white head that leaves a decent cap. Aroma is spicy with pumpkin, cinnamon and ginger the most discerable scents. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. This beer is sweet and malty with the pumpkin and spices coming through in the finish. Good drinkability on this one."
"Coppery orange in color, minimal head and lacing. Smell is dominant of malts and grain with pumpkin pie spices and sugary fruit. The taste is lead by bready malts, pumpkin pie spices add a nice touch, but there is too much of a candied sugar taste. Medium bodied, decent carbonation. Interesting, but the candied sugar taste distracts from the balance."
"Taste is dough, pumpkin pie, grain/biscuit finish, pumpkin pie element is light but firm and well-integrated into the overall doughy-bready beer character. It has hints of both fresh pumpkin and pumpkin-pie spices. It’s very good."
"Lighter body, with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty smooth, with a few highlights. Not bad."
"Drinkability: It's definitely refreshing and a nice beer, but not what I'm looking for in a pumpkin beer. It is way to light on the spices and pumpkin, instead offering a really tangy and strong taste of fruit. I still think its a good beer, just not what I would go for as my first choice in pumpkin beers."
"would not drink again"
"A taste two years later is compleely different. Over spiced and under pumpkined. What's up with that. Not recommended for a re-taste except maybe on my swing through the region next month, if it can be found on tap."
"Mouthfeel is medium with some creaminess to it."
"This isn't a bad pumpkin beer. Anyone who can't detect pumpkin in this one should get over their cold, put less stock in their palate, or get a fresh bottle. Just saying."
"Fizzy copper orange hue this beer had a raucous amount of carbonation it sounded like rice crispies as the head was dwindling, no lacing left behind. The head was an off white fizzy spectacle. Aroma is hitting hard with the pumpkin spices with nut meg, allspice, and cinnamon. Not much gourd going down in my glass as far as the smell of it. Flavor tart tongue raping experience, rotten pumpkin sourness with the flavor that you get before you want to vomit. This is an utterly disgusting brew that is the first drain pour I've gone threw in quite some time. Again no pumpkin tones just heavy acidic spicing levels kills the palate and numbs your cheeks, mouthfeel is fizzy carbonated water with a cloying level of acidity. Drinkability like a said previously, this one's going down the drain. I like most of the Lakefront offerings, however this sucks ass."
"drinkability is decent. any BA who loves pumpkin pie spices will like this brew, but for those looking for a balanced pumpkin beer, this is not good. pumpkin beers should be treated like ESBs, where it is all about balance. too many end up as over-spiced fall beers that are not very drinkable, and this is no exception."
"D - refreshing and different but not really tasty. this is your Bud Light of Pumpkin beers. too bad."
"D: If you really like the flavor, its good, if not, not so much. A beer that could go either way."
"Not a good pumpkin ale at all as it warms up! It smells good at start, and deceives the drinker that a good ale will follow. But the finish is absolutely downright awful and the flavors of citrus negate any of the good spices and pumpkin flavor a good ale of this style should have! Avoid this beer!"
"3-3.5 overall probably not worth having around when there are such good pumpkin beers available. i do think i'd rather drink this than post road (brooklyn) though."
"Aroma is strong and malty with a good overtone of pumpkin and cinnamon, rather appetizing. It pours a clear coppery amber with not much of a head. Pumpkin flavor is strong, but does not overpower the malt; there are hints of cinnamon and hops. Texture is glass-smooth and just a little tingly. A good fall beer, but enjoyable any time of year."
"D - A bit different then other pumpkin lagers in taste, but in a good way. The mouthfeel unfortunately kind of ruins the positives of the taste and smell"
"Hazy orange amber with a soapy off white head, no real lace present. Smells savory,like pumpkin pie spice, honey and buttery grain. Tastes like pumpkin pie but still retains enough real beer flavor to be palatable. Crisp and refreshing with a dry finish. One of the better beers of it's ilk, it is what it is, if you like pumpkin beers this isn't a bad one."
"Not bad...drinkable and all but a bit too heavy on the spice."
"There's a light cream head stitting on an amber body. Strong sent of spices. There's a light to medium body with some strong maltyness. The spices are not a strong as the inital aroma suggests. The All spice cinnimon and ginger contribute to the toasty munich malt and meaty pumpkin flavors. Every flavor has it's moment on your pallette. Over all this beer is highly drinkable and easy to enjoy. Try with a baked squash or corn sufflet."
"Well, as you can see, this didn't work for me at all. Way too overspiced and cloying at times. Maybe if there had bit a bit of Lager like crispness, this would have gone down easier but nope. I won't be visiting this again."
"Bottle from Pauly's. Orange in color with a minimal white foam head.Ginger,cinnamon,and nutmeg spice aromas. Tastes like grandma made pumpkin pie with some lager in the mix, very nice very subtle. Nice mouthfeel, some lacing. Solid offering."
"Drinkability: Worth a bottle or pint. A solid, easily drinkable pumpkin brew, though liking pumpkin beers may be a prerequisite."
"D= Pretty high but I think the ketchup smell would turn me away before I had to many but the taste is right on"
"Overall impression: This was my first pumpkin beer (and my first attempt at drinking a beer for a review -- I joined a review group and pumpkin beer was first on the agenda)) and I will say it was interesting. The initial aroma was far and away the highlight for me and I found it less enjoyable as I went along. It is definitely more pumpkin PIE than straight pumpkin, but that may be standard for this type of brew. I am a big fan of pumpkin pie, but had never had the desire to try a pumpkin beer. While I probably won't pick this one up again, it WAS enough to get me interested in trying other pumpkin beers."
"D: Very sessionable. Its subdued spiced nature and crisp, refreshing character make Lakefront Pumpkin Lager a worthy harvest beer."
"Drinkability: this one is not fake in flavor like some other pumpkin beers, and with this being a lager is a lighter and somewhat refreshing. Worth trying this one."
"Overall- Light easy drinking. Sessionable and modest."
"Notes: The malts were too mild,but it was a fine beer and worth it. I suppose that while this beer lacked in spices/malts it made up for in balance."
"Pours a clear golden amber with 2 fingers of foamy white head. Ok retention and some spotty lacing. Smells of bread and lots of pumpkin pie spice. Tastes of light citrus up front then bread, cinnamon, and pumpkin. Medium light in body with good carbonation. Good pumpkin and spices, malty yet balanced. Not too intense on any of the flavors, but nicely paired. Pleasant, easy to drink and not tasting too high in alcohol, making for a very nice sessionable pumpkin ale for the fall season."
"This is the best pumpkin brew I've tried. And I find it very interesting that it's a lager. That explains the rich smooth quality. Very different from a pumpkin ale. Doesn't have all the complexity that you can get with an ale. Instead the quality of the ingredients and the simple character really shines."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a very intense pumpkin scent along with an equally intense cinnamon aroma. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry, pilsner and light crystal malt taste with a huge pumpkin and cinnamon flavor. It's nothing great for sure. It's just lots of fruit and a very dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good pumpkin beer, although they should back down the fruit flavor and add some nutmeg."
"Pours a pale copper color with an average white head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of pumpkin pie, not strong but noticable. Nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon are predominate, some buttery malt and pumpkin. The taste has a strong grain quality, with weak pumpkin pie spice flavor. The feel is light and crisp, plenty of carbonation, finishes slightly sweet and spicy. An ok pumpkin bre at best. Some pumpkin flavors there but they are overpowered by the grain and carbontion. Easy drinking though."
"D: Glad I only grabbed a single of this. Much better pumpkin beers out there. Not terrible just not something I would seek out again."
"Overall, I really liked the smell of the beer - the flavor, not so much."
"Here is a time that a beer started off very promising and couldn't quite pull it off, in the end. I wanted this to be so much more. I'm not in a hurry to have another one."
"In the taste, the first thing I notice is the very high level of carbonation--think pumpkin soda. I'm almost tempted to throw in some ice cubes, except that it isn't very sweet. More sour than ""pumpkiny"". This one is difficult for me to drink. Sorry, a clear miss."
"It is very drinkable. The smell may seem more powerful than the taste at first but it is very enjoyable. A great seasonal beer."
"Clear orange to amber in the glass, with a nice cream-colored head that dropped quickly, but left a subtle lacing on the glass. Malty spice (cinnamon/nutmeg) in the nose. Flavor was malty with the fruit and spice you'd expect, but this was unique because it offered the smoothness of a lager (rather than the ales typically ""pumpkin'ed"" at this time of year). As the glass warmed, the alcohol came out a bit in the flavor; but the spice kept it in check. Not bad. Enjoyable."
"Light amber to red in color with barely noticeable prickle and a faint wispy head. Very mild nose of pumpkin, spice and ""chalk water."" By ""chalk water"" I mean it smells similar to the water in a bucket after washing the blackboard in grade school. Mild attack. Flavor of pumpkin and malty grains. Clean finish but mildly sweet grain aftertaste. This is a very complex beer compared to many pumpkin ales and lagers. I would say pretty good and call it a B."
"I've had two pumpkin flavored beers (Blue Moon's Harvest Moon the other), and this is far and away the best of the two."
"An avergae pumpkin flavored beer. Nothing bad, nothing great."
"Drinkability is good. This will not be my ""go to"" beer, but I'll grab some next fall when foods accented by these flavors will be featured at Thanksgiving and the like. Worth a try."
"d-very good seasonal beer, but its not something that i will look forward to next year, if you are ever in Milwaukee, YOU NEED TO TOUR!!"
"Poured a cloudy golden-orange color, aroma of cinnamon and pumpkin. Small white head that doesn't last, not much lacing either. Pumpkin , ginger, cinnamon and butter bread flavors, Medium body body with a buttery mouthfeel, finishes pretty sweet, I had a tough time finishing the bottle."
"Dry finish is memorable, the nutmeg and spices takes centerstage, but is balanced by light caramel in the taste. Pumpkin is there, not only alluded to with spices, but in natural pumpkin ""squashy flavor"" as well. Better than many, in terms of authenticity, certainly more balanced than DFH Punkin. If this wasn't my 4th beer, I would have drank the hell out of it."
"One of the better pumpkin beers ive had, but it has nothing on DFH (so hard to find here)"
"D - Not impressed at all. I've been spoiled in that I used to live closer to Deleware and had DogfishHead pumpkin all the time. This is not even close."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Edit (10/2/11) - Had this one much fresher, some I'm upping some scores."
"Still, I enjoyed this one. Recommended."
"Pours a cloudy gold color with only a thin lace of head around the edge of the clear. A lot of floaties in this one. Aroma is pleasant with hints of nutmeg. The taste is full of spices, especially nutmeg and ginger, but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is a little harsh, seems quite carbonated and doesn't go down all the smooth, but not much bitterness here either. Although the appearance is lackluster and mouthfeel isn't anything to brag about the aroma and taste are what make this beer stand out. Overall this is a decent beer."
"Another interesting take on the pumpkin thing, and it works well. The mild spicing is enjoyable and works well with the clean and dry lager base. Especially good on these 80 degree October days."
"Throughout the experience, this beer was very uncharacteristic for a lager. Almost no carbonation and an odd grainy texture. The starchy malt lingers on the palate. Probably my least favorite of the dozen or so pumpkin ales I've tried this fall. I will however try it again next year and reevaluate."
"Pours a hazy orange amber body with a small offwhite head. Good patchy lacing. Standard pumpkin beer aroma of pie spices. Cinnamon, ginger, and clove mostly. Medium carbonation and a light medium body. Taste is nicely balanced. Some genuine pumpkin flavors mingle with the dominant spicing and some spicy hops to create a pleasantly drinkable lager. I prefer this one to most of the pumpkin ales I've tried. Not bad."
"Overall a decent spiced pumpkin lager. It seems to me that the fuller body of an ale is better suited for the style."
"d - nice and easy sipper."
"Lighter in color than I expected, an almost golden amber. The aroma is very strong, and suggests pumpkin and cinnamon. Before trying this beer, I was never quite sure what ""mouthfeel"" actually meant. But this beer has a definite mouthfeel that, to me, is dry and almost powdery. Almost as if the spices are floating right on top. The taste is okay and definitely Pumpkin, but the dry feeling is tough for me to get past."
"Why why why why do they keep making beers like this. I know there is a market for this but there just so damn bad. There is really only 2 pumpkin beers that I think are even decent and this is not one out them. It looks good in the glass. I would probably drink it off of looks. The smell has nutmeg and cinnamon to it. The taste is kind of like a red beer that they drug through a wheat field. There are nutmeg and odd spices that dont really sit well with me."
"Tastes very simple. Dry and spice. Pumpkin rind. Orange flavor late and dries with a carbonaton that acridly clears the palette. peppery zing. Md mouthfeel and stingy carbonation that I found distracting."
"Drink-ability : Didn't do anything for me. It went down easy but I did not enjoy drinking this beer. Glad I tried it and I'm glad it was part of a gift pack."
"Apparently this one varies wildly from batch to batch, and this particular batch (bottled second week of Oct. '06) seems a solid version of the style, but still would like to feel like I licked the inside of a pumpkin guts-and-all. Real good, but still searching for that perfect pumpkin ale..."
"This beer starts with a medium-strong spice aroma of cloves and nutmeg. Deep copper/orange color is great for this style. Medium-full bodied with a big pumpkin taste and med-low spices to balance. Again diacetyl detracts from this beer, mostly in the finish."
"Drinks okay, basically one or 2 & that's it. We're having a halloween paty, I'm sure I can foist these on some unsuspecting guests...I messed up (again)"
"A bit different because it you drink this too cold, its worthless. But its a lager and you dont really want it to warm up too much. Semi hazy amber bronze color. Smallish white head atop dwindles instantly. Not much of a sign of carbonation after the initial pour. Once warmed a touch, there's a solid pumpkin precense. Lots of spice in the aroma but the spice array is a bit more indescript than other pumpkin beers I have tried. Decent pumpkin beer all around. Smoother than most yet with a nice array of flavors. Finish is a tad too spiced. Solid for one, I don't think I'd really care for another."
"Overall impression: Meh - this beer is not quite right. I won't be looking again."
"Eric"
"Slainte!"
"Love the round mouth. Easily drinkable."
"also to note: i agree with the person who mentioned that some batches are different than others. i was elated with this last beer i poured out, but would not give as high a score to other batches i've tried. still, lakefront's pumpkin lager won me over the first time i tried it... and it's something i look forward to every season."
"drinkability: decent"
"Purchased bottle in Menomonee Falls, WI. This was a decent fruit/vegetable beer, except for the overpowering nutmeg, cinnamon, and other spices added to pumpkin pie. This is much like Leinies Apple Spice in that the motto seems to be ""The More Spices, The More Flavor"". Well, more isnt always better. As opposed to Blue Moons far superior pumpkin beer, Lakefronts lager is too overspiced. The beer looks good, a cloudy orangish color. It smells like Thanksgiving at Grandmas. The flavor was overpowering as previously stated, too much perfume/sweetness in what could have been a nice autumn brew. Definitely not up to Lakefronts quality standards."
"D: Average to slightly below average pumpkin beer. This is a lager and not an ale, so the brewery is trying something different here. It's too bad the results aren't that spectacular."
"First of all, I have to say I love fruit/spiced beers. And this is my favorite pumpkin beer. It does vary a little bit between batches, some being better than others, but usually it is very good. The aroma is nice, with the spice coming through. The pumpkin flavor is nice and balances well with the spices used. Kind of like a slice of pumpkin pie."
"Pours with a good head, a hazy, cloudy orangish amber, with no lacing. That pumpkin beer smell with nutmeg and cinnamon for the smell, not bad not great. Pretty good pumpkin beer with the nutmeg and cinnamon and ginger. Really isn't that extraordinary a beer, just doesn't really work out that well. Good attempt, poor execution I'd say."
"My advice: go to the brewery for a truly exceptional, one-of-a-kind brew...but treat it just as that--one-of-a-kind, and not to be found anywhere off the premises."
"This sample is all cloves, cinnamon, and pumpkin. Its delicious but...still not for me."
"Pours an uninspiring orange/amber with a bubbly head that doesn't stick around for long. Smell is heavy on the all-purpose pumpkin pie spice assortment, mostly cinnamon and nutmeg and some sugrary sweet caramel notes. Taste continues with the canned spice extract and sweet pumpkin/caramel malt, but unfortunately entertains an astringent, medicinal bitterness that turns it all foul. Mouth feel is thin but slick. There's just a lot going on here that doesn't mesh together. It's all a little artificial, no real substance. Dogfish and O'Fallon are oth far superior to this timid offering."
"Hmm....A Pumpkin Ale called Pumpkin Lager, that's odd. Hazy copper body, yellow around the edges when held up to the light. Head is small from the get-go, never getting more than a small layer on top of the beer. Smell is sweet and spiced with your typical pumpkin pie spices, that's about it. Taste is terrible. Nothing like a pumpkin beer should be, sweet and funky, tastes almost infected. The beer was bottled the 4th Week of August, so it is well within it's freshness range. Yuck, I will struggle to finish this one, I thik Shipyard has the ebst pumpkin ale I have had so far."
"I have tried several beers from this brewery, and wasn't particularly impressed with any of them until I bought a six pack of this one. I really like pumpkin beer, and this one strikes a fine balance between pumpkin pie spices and pumpkin flavor. It is medium-bodied and sturdy enough to support the spices and remain smooth and drinkable. The amber color reminds one of an Oktoberfest, while the flavor mixes dried fruit, pumpkin, cinnamon and perhaps some clove. All in all an enjoyable tasty brew that's perfect for the harvest season. I'd buy this one again."
"Lakefront's Pumpkin Lager looks pretty good, a slightly cloudy, suitably orange color, capped by a fine white head. Smells yeasty, with hints of the promised pumpkins and spices, but not much. The taste is yeasty as well, kind of musty, a little bit of pumpkin in the finist. The mouthfeel is a little harsh. Certainly not a very pumpkin-y pumpkin beer."
"Drinkability -- I can only drink this beer once in a sitting. This will most likely be my last Lakefront Pumpkin for the year, although a buddy of mine tried it on tap at the Landmark 1850 and he said it was awesome. He had three in one sitting."
"Drinkability - the taste and medium body are nice, but the lemon wash ultimately has me seeking something else tonight."
"Pumpkin Lager Beer is as two-dimensional as they come and is, quite simply, abysmal beer. I have never homebrewed, but I have no doubt that I could do better than this on my first attempt. I will now have serious reservations about trying any more beer from Lakefront. You, however, at least with regard to this particular beer, have been sufficiently warned."
"Cloudy golden-orange color, aroma of cinnamon and pumpkin. Small white head that doesn't last, not much lacing either. Pumpkin , ginger, cinnamon and butter bread flavors, Medium body body with a buttery mouthfeel, finishes pretty sweet, I had a tough time finishing the bottle."
"Overall not a horrible beer...i like some aspects of it and will enjoy the other two bottles I have but the sour/green apple notes bring this score down(even though they are not AS strong as some of the Lakefront litter I have tried)"
"Hazed dark golden tone. Just a skimming of a white head. Lacing is minimal. Nose is all about the spices. Pumpkin Pie spice, clove, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg. A little sweet malt underlying everything. This beer's got some spice on the buds, but it's pretty weak in the malt department. Pumpkin taste is lacking. It's a little phenolic/medicinal as well. Not really that enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel was like most standard ales, sparkling and fullfilling. I'd drink again during the season."
"A nice pumpkin beer, though there's a bit too much cloves for my particular tastes. Still, probably one of the better ones out there."
"Drinkability and overall: I found this one very quaffable. I haven't been a big fan of pumpkin ales but this one works well for me. A nice seasonal offering."
"and soup made a fantastic combination that would have warranted a 4.0-4.5 rather than a 3.0. Brewpubs should offer this mix of food and beer as a special for the month of October."
"I really liked this beer and look forward to trying more of the style. There is a great deal of complexity possible in this style and I believe this beer does a nice job of accomplishing this."
"Orange in color with a brown tinted head. Lightly spiced, and sweet aroma. The big and malty flavor holds the spices in check and the body makes this feel like a meal. The smoothness makes me feel like I'm drinking a regular beer. This is very well balanced. One of my two favorites in the pumpkin beer category."
"Completely clear sub-amber appearance, 1/4 inch head diminishes to large bubbles on the surface in a minute. Laces in very random spots. Not much other than pumpkin pie spice to the aroma, slight sense of white pepper maybe. Low carbonation (too low), mouthfeel is felt-like and a little sub-par. Flavor starts predictably, vegetal in a pronounced cooked celery and carrot sense with cinnamon, sugariness and nutmeg combining in an early statement but giving up to a watery close. Spice attenuates the aftertaste. A little obvious and with no aspects to balance it out. As a pumpkin beer overall, the mouthfeel makes this one less than average for me."
" I enjoy this beer, but there are better pumpkin beers out there"
"Clear golden with an orange hue. Head is small and reduces to just a thin white film. Has a nice spicy aroma of cinnimaon, allspice and nutmeg that resembles pumpkin pie well. As others mention, a bit over carbonated and thin. Flavor isn't all that bad but could be fuller. Doesn't match the aroma at all. A little bitter. I haven't had a good pumpkin Ale in years and the last good one I had was BB's several years ago."
"I was surprised to find this at Frog Bear Wild Boar, a bar/club not really known for the beer selection. Amber color with an off-white head. Aroma is almost spicy enough to make your eyes water. Ginger absolutely dominates, with a little pumpkin and malt crying for attention. This was a little hard to drink because of how robust the spicy flavor was. I would have welcomed more hops or malt to balance out the spice assault. Dry finish. An interesting attempt but not something I am going to search out again."
"A good autumn brew to be had if not just once a year. A good looking appearance with its hazy orange color and fluffy white head. The two-inch head fades quick to a thin film with little lace. The oder was its down side for me. The taste of pumpkin and spice, mainly nutmeg & cinnamon was good. Mouthfeel is left very dry at finish.Overall a pretty good seasonal brew."
"Pours a hazy brownish-orange with a thin head that disappeared in a few seconds.  Aroma is of sweet pumpkin pie and nutmeg.  I wasn't sure what to expect of the taste, but surprisingly the spice, pumpkin flavor and mild hop taste were refreshing.  Pumpkin Lager is a somewhat gimmicky beer, but nonetheless a good Fall and Thanksgiving beer to try."
"A refreshing seasonal lager that I look forward to every year.  Pours hazy orange with a soft white head with heavy carbonation.  The aroma is nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spices, along with some malty notes.  The taste is the aforementioned spices, blended with a faint pumpkin body and limited hop bite.  The body is a bit thin, but overall this is a very good specialty lager that signals the beginning of fall in Wisconsin."
"Grab a cup, scoop some up and enjoy."
