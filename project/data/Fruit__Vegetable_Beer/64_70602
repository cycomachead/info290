An aggro pour produced a brief finger of fizzy, pinkish-white head with minor retention. Color was a yellow-gold (SRM = 4-5) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of green apples and airplane glue, just as earlier reviewers had remarked! Ha ha. At least, it is something different. Mouthfeel was thin, watery and fizzy, like soda water. Taste was palatable, with the strawberry really shining through that apple vinegar taste that is so prevalent in these beers. Finish was semi-dry, again thanks to the strawberry cutting through some of the sharper flavors to round the edges. I am glad that I do not have Celiac, but if I did, it would have to be the fruit-infused beers that I would turn to.","woodychandler","Jul 28, 2014"

Hazy reddish amber with a sedentary head, this brew is quite tempting. the nose has a beautiful essence of the strawberries within, but the malted nose gives it authenticity. Slightly bitter and marginally sweet, this beer satisfies quite well. If you are sensitive to gluten, this is truly a wonderful alternative to those brews with similar attributes which are simply non-potable to the Celiac sufferer.

I mean, if I couldn't have gluten I would load up on this brew. It's great. Dogfish did a great job on this one, great quality, great taste and all around pretty fair price for a very good four pack. If I see this again I am liable to by more without much thought. I'll be enjoying the rest in the weeks to come, that is for sure.","Misanthropy_Sipping","Aug 08, 2013"

I got strawberry, as noted on the label, but I also thout I smelled some raspberries. The beer is semi dry, with a lot of fruit. There is a slightly astringent, grainy taste. Almost salty as well?

And even though it's dry, there's no particular hop character. Pretty good, but could just as easily be mistaken for a dry flavored cider. Pretty fizzy, but not too bad.

2.02,-34.4,2.75,2,2,1.75,2,"I am honestly not thinking about this as beer, but as a gluten-free beverage. The problem is that Tweasen'ale is trying to be both a beer substitute for someone who must avoid gluten, and it's also trying to approach the problem through fruit and honey. It doesn't make it on either front: it has no relation to a standard beer and the fruit tastes very candied and artificial in the final product. While I am a Dogfish Head fan, I think they missed the mark here.","Libationguy","Jul 31, 2013"

The aroma of this ale was dominated by strawberries and honey. Medium in body, since this is a gluten free beer- it lacks much of any malted base- in fact it has none- but with that said, there are flavors of citric oranges, lemons and tart strawberries.

This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, but the flavor couldn't hold my attention, this might be nice in the summertime, but for now one is enough for me, I wouldn't want to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't that bad and it was the most complex aspect in this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how similar to a sparkling fruit wine it tasted, I think some more hops would give it more beer like quality's. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it just isn't my thing, and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone unless they actually have a gluten allergy. All in all I wasn't a fan of this beer, I didn't know what to expect from this style, but it ended up not being for me. I think it's cool Dogfish Head made a beer for people that normally can't drink a beer, but if your not one of those people it might be best just to avoid this beer all together and be thankful you don't have a gluten allergy. This was a cool concept that really didn't come together as well as I hoped, it was good attempt, but this beer just isn't for me.","StoutHunter","Jan 02, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge honey, tart strawberry, apple cider, pear, light caramel, light bread, and a touch of raspberry. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of honey, strawberry, pear, apple cider, wheat, floral, herbal, earth, and light tart raspberry. Zero bitterness; with lingering notes of honey, strawberry, pear, apple, raspberry, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Good flavor balance, with a fair amount of flavors and decent complexity; quite dry on the finish with zero cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly syrupy and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty nice gluten free sorghum beer. A fair amount of nice flavors with decent balance; and extremely smooth to drink. This was pretty enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Nov 19, 2012"

3.15,2.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"For the customers' and mine own edification (and, let's face it, for the sake of the tick), I felt I should try this new gluten-free beer. It pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises sourdough, light maple syrup, a twinge of stone fruit, and a kiss of chamomile. The taste continues the bread's dominance, though now it's clear this bread was made without a gluten source, the sorghum flavor being not only distinct in its own right, but clearly on display here. This is the major failing of the majority of gluten-free beers, as this none-too-tasty flavor is never properly masked. There's a hint of strawberry here, too, as advertised, but it's faint, an echo in the bready darkness. A honey-like sweetness pervades as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, this is one of the better gluten-free options out there, but it could use more fruit (never thought I'd say a DFH beer needed more of its fruit component), if for no other reason than to mask the sorghum better.","TMoney2591","Oct 31, 2012"

A small hint of fruity strawberry was hiding in the back, but was very minute. Didn't coat very well in the mouth, and ended up with a fair amount of bubbles despite not having any carbonation.

Apples, strawberries, maybe a hint of lemon peel somewhere in there. The flavor is sweet in the forefront, with the honey and sweet fruit flavors shining first, then a train of sour apples and strawberries follow, finishing with a lasting sour tail and the slightly earthy tone of buckwheat honey. The grain profile is different for sure, but I can't quite describe it just now. It tastes like there's a bit of wheat in there but I can't really tell.

There is just a touch of sweet and slowly tart strawberry and also a tonic water like element to it. The flavors are fruity and sweet up front with plenty of strawberry water. It has a slight tartness as well but has plenty of that tonic element once again. It drinks a little watery with just an artificial aspect about it. For a gluten free though, it's not too bad. It's at least different than most other options.","aasher","Aug 30, 2012"

The sorghum always reminds me of cream soda in some weird way, not the sweetness level. Just very mildly vanillin. I just can’t get past the lack of malt. Frankly I don’t have to either.

As far as flavoring, we wish that the strawberries were better integrated, and hit the palate sooner than the finish. What was really overwhelming was all of the wine-like components, with grape flavoring dominating the fruit department.

First sip brings über tart strawberry purée before a strong herbal taste comes through, moves into a faint splash of honey and soy and sorghum notes. Earthy with sharp metallic note, wine like taste and acidity. Just odd. Medium bodied, slightly low on bubbles.

But that is of course what the brewery was going for here and this is the best (of three) gluten free beers I've tried. It has some really nice flavors as the strawberry takes a lot of the focus away from the lack of body. At least DFH never half-asses anything.

There is a certain woody flavor along with the honey, which is slight and just barely perceptible. Thin with hi carb and a wet finish.

Flavor wise it's kind of like kissing a strawberry blonde hippie chick that hasn't bathed in a few days there's just something not right about it. A layer of mint or earthiness, a little bit of a dirty layer of beeswax and buckwheat, tart strawberry jame like real jam minus the concentrated sugars.

3.38,9.7,4,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,"O: I've certainly had better gluten free beers than this (Mbege and Shakparo from Sprecher come to mind, which I think are vastly underrated), but this has a unique flavour profile which distinguishes it from your everyday hunky dory gluten free beer and all beer for that matter. The flavours are good, the beer is thin, frankly I think some gluten would help it to add some body, but that's not what Dogfish Head set out to do so I will review as such. At $9.99/4-pack, the QPR is not great, but for celiacs I think this is a worthy effort to try, and for the regular beer consumer, it wouldn't hurt to try a single to change up the repertoire.","Halcyondays","Jan 29, 2012"

3.97,28.9,4.5,5,3.5,3,4,"O: Overall it's a great light flavored beer. It's something to drink when it's really hot out, or when looking for a beer that isn't going to overpower the flavor of something light like a salad or fish. I would buy it again, and I think it's amazing that it's gluten-free...it's going into the memory bank of beers to recommend to people with gluten allergies.","teromous","Jan 05, 2012"

3.85,25,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured clear, golden, with a fuzzy white head that receded to a thin layer of bubbles. Sweet aroma, flowery, with obvious hints of strawberry candy...those little candies that have wrappers that look like strawberries. Taste that delivered what was promised, with sweet strawberry candy very obvious, grains, bubblegum, wet grass and wildflowers. Obviously, this is not a beer for everyone, but for what it's worth, I found it to be very nice. Light body, and very easily drinkable.","Rifugium","Dec 18, 2011"
3.35,8.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a light amber with a slight pink hue and a thin white ring of head that disappears quickly, leaving just a slight stream of bubbles. Aromas is certainly sweet, with a good amount of strawberry, a touch of honey, and an ""off"" grainy character that must be from the sorghum. Taste is spot-on with the nose, very sweet, with lots of strawberry, honey, and an almost apple-cider quality. I don't think I'd immediately guess ""gluten free", but you can definitely tell there's something different about the makeup of this one. Mouthfeel is smooth and nicely drinkable with just a touch of bitterness in the finish. Pretty refreshing, actually. Overall a very unique beer, and a neat experiment, but not really my thing.","jsanford","Dec 11, 2011"
3.48,13,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"On-tap at the DFH Pub. Apparently it's gluten-free... doesn't make a difference to me but seems to be a selling point to some people. Nice fruity aroma, sort of reminds me of a a flavored wheat ale. Strawberries aren't too strong and is definitely on the lighter side, maybe something more geared towards the female demographic. Finish is a bit tart, it could be hard to have more than one, but easy to drink and tasty, just don't expect anything too crazy.","oriolesfan4","Dec 10, 2011"

3.55,15.3,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured out as an interesting orange color with no head by the time it got to my table... No lacing here wither. The smell of the beer has some sweet sugary aromas and some hints of fruit also. The taste of the beer is a little tart and sweet in the beginning, as the flavors settle there is a faint bubblegum flavor in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel has a sharp little bite to it but finishes clean and a bit on the dry side. Overall not too bad, wouldn't need to have it again. Happy to have tried it though.","Knapp85","Sep 10, 2011"
3.36,9.1,2.5,4,3.5,2.5,3,"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a cloudy, opaque, peach color with no head. The aroma is overly sweet, with hints of pastry and strawberry characteristics. There is a steady carbonation bubbling, keeping the beer light and crisp while you drink. Highlights of strawberry tartness with a steady citrus and tar backbone, as well. The aftertaste is sweet fruit, both strawberry and citrus again. Very light body and extremely sharp finish, making it a difficult one to drink a lot of. Good blend of flavors, and very refreshing, but overly sweet and crisp for my palate.","GarthDanielson","Aug 08, 2011"
