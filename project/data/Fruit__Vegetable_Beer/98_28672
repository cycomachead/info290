I got this as a single, so really I just picked it up for the raspberry. Once I opened it, I took a second look at the bottle and realized it was Harpoon.

Taste is all raspberry from start to finish with the wheat coming through at the end. Minot much else going on, a decent flavor but could have more depth. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, easy drinker, flavor doesn't get overwhelming. Overall a decent beer, nothing amazing going on here, but not bad.","wingman14","Jul 05, 2013"

Raspberries introduce themselves to the nose immediately with more muted bready malts and clean crisp mildly hopped character. It smells like it would be a great way to cool off on a hot day. The body is light to medium. The flavor has a lot of raspberry which tends to overtake everything else. Still it ends tart and slightly dry.","puboflyons","Feb 14, 2012"

3.27,-8.7,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Found at the Four Points hotel bar in Revere, MA, this brew shows a dark amber glow with yellow edges, a modest white head that dissipates quickly and leaves little sign of lacing. The aroma gives off mild tart raspberry and sweet grass. The flavor brings a sour raspberry with lemon wheat. There’s a dry citrus hop finish in this somewhat thin bodied summer brew with tiny bubbles to tickle the palate. It has a watermelon-like quality but to me this gets old fast. Not my favorite fruit beer. Could use more grainy substance to balance out the fruit tart theme, but it probably would make for a decent change up during the summer, served ice cold and refreshing.","Durge","Dec 20, 2011"

It tastes great to, I'm not a fan of fruit beers but this one is good. I tasted tart raspberry right from the start, it kind of makes the mouth pucker, there is a lot of wheat and a hint of lemon. This beer is light and the carbonation attacks the tongue. It finishes very dry.

3.85,7.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D: I like fruit beers made with real fruit. It adds a roundness and well integrated complexity that really sets them apart. Instead of being annoyingly cloying (at worst) or just mindlessly drinkable – you get an interesting quencher. The brewery says natural fruit flavor rather than real fruit, but it seems authentic even if it is not real whole fruit.","SickGnar","Aug 18, 2011"
3.79,5.9,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured on tap at a local irish pub, the beer was served in a pint glass. It pours a hazy, cloudy, red-tinged color, almost peachy, with a thin, foamy, dense layer of filmy head that coats the top of the beer, as well as any part of the glass it touches. The aromas are heavy raspberry sweet, with a deep, dark sweet aroma, like when you are mixing raspberry Jello with the boiling water. Flavors are surprisingly well blended, with an initial toasted grain flavor that is quickly followed by a strong, but not overpowering, raspberry tangy sweet character. The aftertaste is a bit of the toasted and a bit of the tangy sweet, but light overall. The finish is a bit tart, with a slight coating left behind. Tasty brew...great on a hot day.","GarthDanielson","Aug 08, 2011"

3.7,3.4,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured a bit purple-ish amber. Average head and wheat character, with a nicely crisp body. Even though the lable notes that natural raspberry flavor is added, it had a tinge of artificiality to it, and rang of flavoring adjunct rather than brewing component. Sweetness was well moderated so that it did not come across as a fruit cooler, but not the most impressive example, either.","Brent","Jul 29, 2011"

I guess I was hoping for more raspberry all over this one. A little bummed out that it wasn't a strong flavor. The mouthfeel was soft and mild, light carbonation.

Also present and noticeable is the nice wheat scent. The flavors where very nice, strong raspberry flavor that has a slight tart feel to it. The wheat flavors take a back seat in this one but based on the berry flavor I think that is ok. Nice carbonation that helps add a slight spiciness with what I guess might be some hops in the background?

Amber-pink in appearance and somewhat cloudy. I've had varying experiences relative to the visibility of yeast in the glass; guess it depends on the batch. However, my expectation is that there should be some residual yeast floating in the brew. Nice subtle smell of raspberry, but not overpowering. Very pleasant in the mouth. A little bit of a tingle on the tongue, with a slightly tart finish that leaves the taste of raspberry on the taste buds. Very drinkable and refreshing.","Jwale73","Sep 23, 2007"

It has a smooth hefe taste with loads of fresh raspberry flavoring. It's quite fruity and refreshing. The taste is decent. It has a light hefe flavor that goes down down quick and finishes crisp and fruity. It's dry and tart with a lingering raspberry flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I wish the taste was as fruity as the aroma. It's a bit too dry for me. All in all, a fine fruit beer.","WesWes","Aug 20, 2007"

3.77,5.3,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"I guess it was a no-brainer to take the classic UFO and add raspberries for a summer seasonal. Beer fares well with the additions. I have always found the base beer (UFO) to be a bit sub-par compated to good German classics, but the fruit flavors contribute a ton of raspberry character. The wheat malt nose is dwarfed by strong, ripe, raspberries, tartness, and a bit of an earthy acidity. The color shows a typically hazy appearance with a ruby-red grapefruit color and fair head retention and fair lacing. The flavors are also dominated by berry sweetness and tartness, leaving a hint of wheat malt, bready, estery flavors to fight through late. Moderately full body, with a thinning tartness and mild astringency if the finish. I like the beer, but it is not as subtley flavored as Purple Haze and many other Raspberry Wheats.","BEERchitect","Aug 05, 2007"

Aromatics contain tart raspberry with a mild citrus sharp sweet note coming about with a bready biscuit malt presence along with those mildly acidic wheat notes yeast tone gives it a funky mix as well. Flavors blend decently because the brew doesn't show off any sugary sweet concentrate kinda of like a nice tart raspberry puree here with the yeast, wheat, and malt components leveling out the vibe a bit, I actually dig this more than the UFO Hefeweizen still no clove and banana action b/c this is an American Wheat but it does the trick in delivering a fruit beer without candy sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium to light in body with enough carbonation to tickle the back of the throat with each sip overall not something that seems like a smooth sipping brew.

I gotta say Im not such a fan of the regular UFO offering, but maybe the raspberry aspect will spruce it up a bit. It poured into a Magic Hat Hocus Pocus weizen glass a pale, somewhat murky light pink. Heading was thin and minimal, but not altogether unappealing looking. In the aroma were light sweet raspberries, a bit of lime...very similar to how a fruit flavored gingerale smells. The raspberries become a bit more tart when tasting, with some green leaf flavors, more citrus notes, and maybe a bit of watermelon. Mouthfeel was light, crisp, and very refreshing. I could definitely make a session with this beer, especially on hot days like today. This might not be the best fruit brew i've tasted, but its a solid offering.
