The aroma and taste were like the syrup from a can of peaches, which I personally don't find appetizing.  I understand it says real peaches but I just wasn't tasting a fresh peach there.

I figured it would be nice and refreshing and boy was I right! It was so sweet and perfect. Pale ale and had amazing peach hints through the whole experience. To me it would be an amazing summer beer. I loved it so much our local Sam's Club sales local beers and I stocked up!!! Favorite for now!","Brandi123P","Feb 09, 2014"

3.58,0.8,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium peachy golden amber with a huge white head with decent retention and lacing. Aroma dominated by fresh peach juice with hints of biscuit malt and wheat. Flavor follows aroma with peachy biscuit malt and wheat, a light hop and malt finish. Light to medium bodied. The peach is nice, but this leaned more towards a light amber ale profile than a wheat ale. I think I would have liked this peach melded with a more distinct classic wheat ale. High scores on the deft use of peach juice, but less so the underlying body.","LiquidAmber","Aug 22, 2013"

The aroma consists of malted wheat, and Peaches! Medium bodied, the base of this American Wheat Ale consisted of soft malted wheat, clover honey, and fresh Peaches. Sweet and semi tart, there is not any noticeable hop flavor. The Peach aroma is stronger then the taste- it actually is a very nice balance of peach and malted wheat. There is a fine line when adding fruit to a Wheat Ale and RJ Rockers did a good job of not crossing it with this ale.","GossageBrewery","Sep 13, 2012"

The nose sung of summer peaches and cream, while the taste followed through nicely with nice even sweetness, and a bitter finish at the way end. We wish that the sweetness had remained just a bit longer, to help better balance the sourness and bitterness of the final flavors. This is a highly refreshing beer, but due to the glorious peach insanity, this guy will remain for special occasions.","TheBrewo","Jul 29, 2012"

However, the taste isn't quite as nice. The peach taste seems more artificial to me, and there's a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and has a good level of carbonation. It's a decent enough brew overall.

Got me thinking - is it possible to make peach cider or peach wine? Well, the Japanese make plum wine - pourquoi pas? OK, enough digression.

Most of the peach flavor is gone as well but hints of remnants that I just chewed on peaches, but without skins and threads stuck in my teeth.

After a few minutes pure amazement at the peach, my head returns from the clouds and the rest of the taste comes through, with a lot of other fruity and flowery notes.

The peach flavor wasn't too strong and had just enough so you could get flavor of the peaches and didn't take over the beer's flavor. Overall it finished very light and easily drinkable.

I've tried a lot of fruit beers (namely blueberry ales) that smell ""fake", but this aroma seems really authentic.

It pours a cloudy peach color with very little head. Aroma is dominated by peach which I think makes it seem like you taste more peach than you actually do. Not sure how or when they added peaches during the process, but it's certainly a unique blend of aroma and taste. This one is not overly sweet at all, especially for a fruit beer. There is a little sweetness at the end, but certainly a beer you could continuously down. Carbonation levels leave this beer crisp and refreshing. I'm sure there are some beer geeks out there that won't give this one a fair shake, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Nice job!!!","southernbelle09","0"
