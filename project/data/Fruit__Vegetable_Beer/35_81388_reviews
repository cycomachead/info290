"Refreshing, light taste. Nice kick of lemon. Definitely a more summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a good all around summer brew."
"An OK summer beer nothing more"
"This, right now, is my favorite summer beer.  Not too sweet or fruity, but nice enough to sit in the hot sun by the pool."
""
""
"It tastes exactly like lemonade. Pretty solid for the summer."
""
"One of my favorite. Spring yo summer. Goes really well on the east coast."
""

"Light, citrusy, refreshing. Good intro or summer beer."

"Very similar to Leinenkugel Summer Shandy, but I wouldn't say it's quite as good."

"Very similar to their Summer Ale, but better IMO."

"Refreshing summer beer.  I prefer this over the Sam Adams Summer Ale."
""
""
""
""
"Has a sweet lemon taste, easy drinking."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a ""pint"" glass. Pours orange with a small head that disappears almost immediately. Smells of sour lemons. Tastes of wheat with a nice blends enough lemon flavor to make a nice blend. Beer is nice carbonated very drinkable, light bodied. Overall a good beer."

"It's the 7up of beers..."

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle, served in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager Sensory glass."

"As a beer and lemonade combo, this is probably okay. As a go-to beer, many people will probably by-pass this as it just doesn't satisfy the taste buds like either a light summer beer or regular lemonade would by themselves. You get more of a slightly sour, past-its-prime skunky beer flavor more than anything else. I don't know. Why ruin a good malt beverage by adding lemonade to it? I don't get the appeal..."
""
"OVERALL: I enjoyed this beer. Good Summer beer. It's a good beach beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste has a bit too much lemonade-esque flavor and the lager a bit to biscuity, bordering on light toast. Id like a less sweet version with a more neutral malt profile. This is far from my favorite radler and Id probably rank this below Lienenkugel's Summer Shandy on my request list."
""
"OVERALL:  this is the second Radler style beer I've tried, I enjoyed this beer, it would appeal to people who do not normally like beer because it tastes like a soft drink, the modest 4.5% ABV means you can enjoy more than one.  I would not drink this often but it's a good beach party beer."

"Single bottle from a craft beer ""pick six"" setup poured into a flute. Not my preferred beer style but the completist (or obsessive) in me wanted to try every offering in the current Sam Adams summer pack and rumor has it that this tastes at least somewhat like a real beer as opposed to some limp dick 30% beer 70% juice blend (sorry, that's a cooler, not a beer). A darker than expected yellow-orange gold rather like ginger ale, with an initially large frothy white had that dissipates almost instantly. The aroma is not bad (!), some of the rich cereal notes one expects in a Helles, the expected lemon rind and oil and even a faint whiff of grassy noble hops. On the palate the lemon is tastefully done, not overwhelming the light malts, and there is also a subtle candied ginger vibe, and the hops seem to combine with the fruit to yield a sweet lemongrass tea effect. Not particularly sour. A bit heftier than expected in terms of body, accompanied by a pleasingly moderate degree of carbonation (although one's biased expectancies do yield a slight desire for more fizz). As mentioned, not a shandy guy but this is a nice revelation, even if I would not purposely seek out this brew again. Its a candy beer but one with some grain to shore it up."

"O - Now that I read the bottle label (after starting the review), I see that this beer perfectly matches its description. It is a light beer that has been lightened even more with some lemon soda or at least lemon flavors and water. Why? I don't know and I won't be looking for this one again. If I want a shandy, I'll mix my own and at least not have to pay full premium beer prices for something that was conveniently watered down before I bought it! This is a mega-brewer tactic that is not worthy of Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I haven't had many radlers and perhaps I was spoiled by the SIxpoint Rad I had a few weeks ago, but I really didn't like this due to the sugary sweetness; I find it amusing looking through the reviews that some said it leaned toward having too much beer in the mix and others said there was too much lemonade; personally, I would side with those that said there was too much beer but whatever was blended really throws it off for me"

"I just poured my first Sapooro down my drain, and opened this hoping it would take that horrid taste out of my mouth. It certainly did! This beer is WONDERFUL! . I can definitely taste lemons, which is something that's not found in many beers. After my taste buds got over the shock, I must say Its one of the best I've had. I poured it from a bottle into a British pint glass. It has a small white head that faded quickly but has left some lacing. The color is clear amber. This beer is perfect after a day in the sun. I highly recommend that you try Porch Rocker!"
""
"O: Not bad, the lemon almost seems forced and instead of being more nuanced and playing a supporting role it is more the star of the show. It isn't terrible but it could be better."

"Sam Adams ""Porch Rocker"" is a GR8 Choice for a super hot,Hazy,Humid, Summer Day,Ultra Refreshing,with a zesty Lemon kick,and a drinkabilty Factor that is quite Honestly Through the Roof,perhaps more of a full on Beer than most Radler's tend to be,..but I myself like that,a very,VERY well crafted Brew with plenty of carbonation and well off the beaten track,I will be drinking a LOT of this Beer this Summer~gr8 stuff! Cheers."

"This Porch Rocker . . . Rocks!! It had a great look when I poured it into a pint glass. the aroma was inviting but not overwhelming. the big hook was the taste. This beer was truly meant for summer. it was an excellent pour that was matched by its flavor. it had a great fruity zip that was a perfect match for summer. the color was a perfect golden yellow. this is now on my list for summer enjoyment."

"O - Very good lemon beer. Stay away from Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy if you're a beer lover. Porch Rocker puts it to shame. Great session brew on a hot day or whenever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a bright gold crystal-clear beer with a small airy head. The nose--smells like lemon-fresh pinesol or some other countertop cleaner. Ugh, just sniffing it reminds me I need to clean my counter tops. Taste is sickeningly sweet with a sweet fake lemony flavor. It's not even tart and acidic. Just sweet. Pouring the rest out. Limited release? Good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad-tasting lemon-lime (gah, I'm getting tired of writing that) flavoured German-style lager, however, its plainness puts it up against the full fruity beers out there, as opposed to the simple half-and-halfs of the proclaimed style. Nothing really worth seeking out, for that reason, and instantly forgettable."
""
""
"Pours a golden honey in color with a thin white head that leaves some spotty lacing when sipped. Good carbonation. The aroma is of of hops/grains with citrus. The taste is the same with some floral in the mix as well and ends of a strange tangy finish from the lemon. Overall, it was just OK."
"Would be a much lower rating except my wife liked it, so at least the two bottles from the Sam Adams variety pack didn't go to waste. Lemonade beer is definitely not my thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Whenever I get a bottle of Miller or InBev mass-produced beer, I typically add lemon or lime juice to make it palatable. SA Porch Rocker tastes pretty similar and goes down smooth on a hot day. Not offensive-tasting but not tasty either, just an easy-drinking beer that reminds me of light beer with lemon. Although I've never understood the point of the Germans taking good beer and diluting it with lemonade to create a Radler."
""
""
"O- A bit lacking in the flavor but still enough to keep the relaxation in motion on a hot summer day. Sit back and drink em down. Can hold up enough to drink a couple."
""
""
""
""
"Thought this would be a great beer like the summer ale for the summer. Everything is there but very lack luster. this is the only Sam Adams that is a pour and drain. Very disappointed in this beer in thinking this would go along with the summer ale for my summer beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The Radler style doesn't seem to be very popular among the hardcore beer crowd and there are a few solid arguments I could see supporting that but, when a brewer is after a blend of lemonade and beer, one must to go into the experience expecting what the brewer is after, not something else. With that said, Samuel Adams' Porch Rocker is a near flawless example of a Radler; a well-made beer blended with lemonade that's neither artificial or overpowering. It's crisp and refreshing aroma make for a lively smell that leads right into a light kiss of lemonade tartness balanced with a bright and malty helles lager in the flavor. Still beer-forward, it's hard to ask for a more refreshing or sublime marriage of the two."
""
"The feel if the beer pretty light and goes down easy. It's low ABV makes for a good session beer if you enjoy the almost candy-like flavor that is the driving flavor of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : I had better fruit / vegetable beers then this one. It is just to much tart lemon lingering for my taste."
""
"Overall: I came into this brew with at least some decent expectations, considering Sam Adams brewed this. Was deeply unimpressed, tired of that word already. However, on the finish, I did notice SOME hoppiness flavors. I would not recommend to a friend, unless they enjoy those shandy beers, then you're on your own. Cheers!"

""
"Anyway, a dang good beer from Sam Adams. When they say it hits the spot on one of those hot summer nights, plenty here in F-L-A, I can tell you - it does. About the only thing I didn't like was its smell - the lemon scent didn't quite mix well with the hops. But other than that, it was fantastic. I was particularly impressed on the taste - crisp, refreshing, just the right hint of lemon mixing well with slight ale flavor. Definitely one of my new favs for Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a golden color with a half inch of foam. It has a slight lemonade smell to it. It has very slight lemon taste to it and is not over powering. It has a very fizzy mouth feel that doesn't really linger. Overall it is a good beer and is worth drinking on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma ifs one dimensional with lots of lemon and weak grains. Flavor follows the nose. Lots of lemon, hint of citric, leafy hop. Light and smooth. Crisp flavor and finish in the end. Pretty refreshing. A solid session beer or for a hot summer's day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- it's an easy drinking beer that will only appeal to most on hot summer days, which is what it was intended for. For that, I'll probably drink a few this summer"

"Overall: A refreshing beer for warm weather. Goes down easy."
""

"O- citrusy flavors are ok, as subtle as they were I think the beer would be better if they were taken down one more notch"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty solid beer from Sam Adams"
""
""
""
" The flavor is more lemon soda than lager with a light lemonade-like sweet flavor with fizzy soda-like taste with mild malt flavor in the background with a slight yeast accent that accentuates the lemon soda sweetness toward the end giving more of a cooler-type flavor. This was not enjoyable as I expected. I have had other 'radler' type beer mixed bottles before that seemed like a better hybrid than this - I prefer something with more beer and less lemon soda in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Extremely refreshing, a little too sweet if you aren't drinking this with food, but definitely my first approved summer favorite of 2014."
""
"Overall: Not really a whole lot going on here. This is pretty straightforward stuff, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Strictly as a beer this would rate lower, since the lemon component is really the most prominent, but for the hybrid sort of beverage that it is, it works well."
""
"Overall: I don't have much to say about this beer. It's pretty decent. A good beer for a hot day, very crisp and refreshing. It's pretty adequate, and I'd gladly drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like a shandy every now and then, especially in warmer weather. However it is always hard to rate them because it is a blend. The appearance was a nice hazy yellow with a smell of a lot of citrus. The taste is a pretty standard shandy with a very light feel to it. If it's a hot day and you need something to cool yourself off, this is a very refreshing beverage. However, don't go into this thinking that you're going to get something groundbreaking."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a nice session beer, refreshing, not much character, but totally refreshing and perfect for a hot Summer day."

"My favorite summertime beer. Not quite a shandy, though not far off. The lemon flavor is evident and I like how, at least to this point, they haven't tried to do too much to it. No other fruit or spices to take away from the German Lemonaide makes it very enjoyable. It is just an excellent, refreshing, summertime beer that I look forward to every year."

"O-Just a bad beer. Maybe if Shadys are your thing try it, but everything seemed to be off on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent selection, and might be a nice choice to introduce a non-beer drinker to craft beer (or at least micro-brews, if The BBC is still that)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of light lemon notes with lightly sweet malt. Taste is also dominated by lightly sweet lemon notes with some lightly sweet malt notes. Body is light with average carbonation. Bland shandy."

"Summary - This is technically a Radler. It's inoffensive, but very lemony. This is really like 50/50 lemonade/beer. This is not a bad beer, but I would only have it on a hot Summer's day."
"O: kickin' it with the ladies?...take this to the party = you'll earn brownie points"
"Overall, not a bad beer. Definitely good on a 105 degree day in Phoenix."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a decent enough beer concoction. not my favourite style wise. it has it's place among summer quenchers."
""
"If this were the beach it might be a different story - I could see it being pretty refreshing on a hot day - but sitting in my house it's a bit too much. Not super bad, just not really my thing per se. I could see non regular beer drinkers really liking this... In a league with Shock Top/Blue Moon, etc."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow, with a big frothy white head. Aromas of light grain, and some lemon-lime sodapop. Taste begins with big lemon-lime flavor, followed by a dry cracker malt middle, and a lime peel, clean finish. Mouthfeel is a little bit light. Overall a decent tasting beverage at first, but it gets REALLY cloying after about halfway through, as its just too sweet and alcoholpop tasting."
"O - Fruit beers are not really my thing. This one turned out pretty much as I expected. Tolerable, but I figure I may as well just buy a bag of Lemonheads."
""
""
""
"At first I thought this was OK, but as it warmed it got bad. I don't want one of these again. Thankfully all I had was one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this is a good entry beer into the world of beer. A nice mix of lemonade and beer might help get non beer drinkers into drinking beer. Very refreshing lighter beer that is blended well with lemonade. A good beer for the style."
"O: If nothing else, this would kick ass on a hot day. As a rule of thumb, though, I don't rate beer/something else hybrids or malternatives highly; this being no exception. I'd drink it over commercial ciders, BMC, or the like in this weather - but NOT over a well-done pure lager. Which incidentally, Sam Adams has a few of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a refreshing summer beer although the sweetness limits drinkability somewhat. i would get it again, though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Porch Rocker pours a clear golden color, with a small lacing head. There is a hint of lemon citrus like note, but smells more like lemon pledge cleaning wipes. The taste however has a nice crisp malty backbone, with a nice strong lemonade like aftertaste. Nice blend of beer and lemonade like flavors, very easy to drink. Overall WOW, a very good refreshing beer that is perfect for a summers day."
""
""
""
""
"D- shandies, radlers, etc easily my least favorite style. At least this one has a decent base beer beneath it."

"Pretty much a lemonade beer, not much else going on, but that's the point I suppose. ""It is what it is."""
""
"O: As I have been to Germany, I would not consider this a ""Radler"". This comes across as a Shandy with too much ginger ale, not bad but not what I crave on a hot Summer day"
""
"Overall: An ok fruit juice beer. Does what it sets out to be, a hot weather thirst quencher. More lemon soda like than beer but its a decent soda/beer."
""
"Overall: I’m not a fan of this beer, mainly because I don’t like shandys. That being said, the flavors are interesting and I’m assuming that it’s a pretty good example of what a shandy is supposed to taste like, and I think that it would be a great beer to use to try to convert those BMC drinkers, or Landshark drinkers or Corona drinkers to American craft beer."

"pours a light golden in color less than a finger head and no lace to speak of. nice strong lemon citrus aroma with a bready wheat like lemon taste. light to medium mouthfeel that ends very clean. its 90 degrees today and this beer is doing the job very well."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, best before November, served in pint glass. Crystal clear and pale yellow, with small bubbles rising to the surface, and a vanishingly small white head. Marginal aroma. Flavor is lemonade all the way. Refreshing and natural, but sweeter that it should, and with absolutely no hint that this is a Radler as opposed to a straight up hard lemonade (gotta disagree with Jason on that one...). The body is pretty thin and as a result it's hard to taste anything but lemonade here. But it's refreshing and would probably be quite enjoyable if that's all you were looking for. Not as fun as Kronenbourg Blanc, and only marginally less gimmicky."
""
""
""
"O: Ive had quite a few shandys/radlers, though regarded as a fruit / vegetable. This is the respectable, crisp, refreshing hardly tastes like a beer, a good thing or bad thing? its all up to the consumer. A refreshing pool side, tart lemonade quencher that will make satisify the thirst on a hot summer day without being weighed down."
""
""
""
"The beer was smooth with some after taste of mostly lemon but overall this was a solid beer that I would have again. I prefer the Summer shandy from Leinie but this is a good one as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle. Interesting beer. Drank first half ice cold and was not very impressed. The beer starts to taste a little better as it warms up though. Not too carbonated which I was ok with. It has obvious lemon flavors that are somewhat refreshing in the summer. It reminds me of a hard lemonade and beer hybrid, but leans more towards beer. It is worth trying, but I think cider fans will appreciate it more."
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this beer, although the lemon is a bit artificial tasting. The sweetness, while not cloying, is also a bit too much for my liking. But I do like the simplicity of the beer, and would be a great choice on a really hot summer day."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is strong of lemonade. Taste is the same, lots of lemons, a touch of tartness, refreshing. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a unique beer worth trying once, but I wouldn't want a steady diet of it."
""

"Yellow color and heavy moderation. Heavy citrus aroma. Initially tastes like carbonated juice or soda. As it moves over the palate you're hit with sweet citrus beer. Really refreshing yet at the same time the carbonation can be overpowering. A great summer beer for those who like or don't mind a lot of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- an interesting try at a Radler but not worthy, imho, of any revisits."
""
""
"Porch Rocker is a lemon- accented beer and it ranks as one of the least- bitter brews I have ever tasted. It certainly has some redeeming qualities as a summer beer, but it isn’t the type of taste I go for on a regular basis. I might try it again when the heat and humidity of summer are at a peak, but other than that, I will likely pass on this one more often than not. The sweetness and taste of lemons are not beer qualities I want in an everyday beer."
"Overall: A refreshing beer I could really only have a couple due to all the sweetness that this beer is characteristic of beer."
""
""
"Poured this 12 oz fruit beer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a bright clear golden color, produced a nice white head and lacing that stuck to the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh squeezed lemons and fresh baked bread. Light in body, the ale had a foundation of light fluffy bread, lemon and i mean- a heavy dose of lemon. Very tart, crisp , smooth , refreshing- One of the best summer or lawn mower beers i have ever sampled. I will have to pick up a full 6 pack of this."
"Absolutely one of the best beers I have ever had by Sam Adams. Can definitely drink this all day every day. Taste is outstanding and the aroma is overall exceptional. Perfect for a hot summer day sitting on your porch...just as the name suggests. Overall a perfect beer. Top notch panty dropper"

"Still nothing I would drink more than 12oz of in any given 24 hour period. Its a nice beer to start out or have early in the drinking experience. Couldn't see it working in anything below 60 degrees outside. Carbonation good, beer neither too light or too heavy. I'd say my score goes up 1/2 grade on this beer when its 90 degrees or above outside."

"The taste was a lot like drinking recently squeezed lemon juice mashed in with pale malts and barley. I guess that's the way it was supposed to taste considering the style. This will find a definite audience because it would be refreshing on a hot and humid day. Maybe if I try it again in mid-July when it's 90 degrees I might appreciate it better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's tasty but isn't fantastic. A nice light addition to the summer 12 pack tho, I'll certainly enjoy the other bottle as well as this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, middle of the road - not a total wash out, but no blazing success for a style I actually enjoy. The lemon is very pleasant at first but wears out its welcome with the aftertaste. Maybe needs to be dialed back just a touch on the flavor addition or spend a few more days in the fridge."

"Love me some porch rocker reminds of a shandy. I picked some up at shoprite wines & spirits in little falls for 9.99 a six pack. I also realized you can get locally delivered from there website at shopritewine.com. They have so many craft beers over 400 you guys should check it out."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty mediocre beer and an average example of the style, this beer was going in the right direction till i got to the sweetness, if that was toned down some I think this beer would be on par with most Shandys. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth and refreshing, but the flavors couldn't hold my attention, I could probably drink a few of these on a warm summer day, but the flavors don't really keep me coming back for more. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, it really needs to be toned down in this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, I would rather have Summer Shandy since it isn't so sweet, I would recommend this to shandy lover who don't mind some sweetness with a shandy. All in all i wasn't that into this beer, there was just to much sweetness for me and it ended up being too overpowering and it made this beer drink much more like a lemonade than an actual beer. I appreciate the attempt but it just didn't come together as well as it could have, better luck next time Samuel Adams."

"3.0 D: This is an alcoholic soft drink. That said, it isn't really a beer, so I didn't know how to rate it."

"The beer is orange with a small off white head. The aroma brings wheat, fruity sugars, grain, lemons. The flavor brings lemon candies, fruity pebbles cereal. Really sweet with artificial fruit flavoring. Like a wine cooler. Not my thing."

"O: All in all, this was alright, tasted good at first but afterwards the ricola feel kicked in and my feelings were mixed. I'd say its worth a try, not horrible and I could defiantly drink more, I'd save for when I have a cold, lol. ."

"Summer beers? Look no further. I didn't even feel the alcohol in this and I could have downed a bunch in a sitting had I had that many around. Maybe some wheat would have livened this up a bit but for now, this is worth a go once just to see what else is possible in the vast array of Sam Adams products currently on the shelf. Not likely to disappoint as long as your expectations aren't terribly high."
""
"O - Really depends on the situation. This will never be a beer I'll sip when I'm in the mood for quality, strong tasting brew. But on a hot day, or any other time your thirst calls for a beer refreshment, I can see myself going for one of these. I guess to summerize, this beer is good for what it is."

"Strong lemon aroma through and through. Light malt character and mild hop character through some foam with a more simple lemon oil/pledge after the beer settles. Flavor is decent and not quite overwhelming in the lemon department though it is certainly well represented and more notable on the finish. Decent body for a style within a stlye, easy drinking and perhaps even robust for a Lemon Shandy given the ABV. Overall a bit sweet to have a few of and might actually do well over ice. Would prefer a more robust carbonation otherwise. Cheers.."

"My pour created several fingers of french vanilla-colored head, but its inherent fizziness led to relatively low retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity, like liquid sunshine in the glass. Nose was very lemony and it brought a slight pucker to my mouth in anticipation. The mouthfeel was light, not thin, but more towards unobtrusive and the taste was fully lemonade. Finish was semi-dry and completely refreshing. I know that SA is making the move to CANs and if they were to CAN this beer, it would be great at the beach."
"This taste like someone poured lemonade into a slightly above average helles. Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. The color is a bright gold that I'm not certain should exist from natural elements. The mouthfeel is mellow, as expected for they beer type, but doesn't add. It's a bit sweet and the fruit is a little overpowering for me I guess."

"It mentions a radler. I don't think it is, but it is a lemony lager. Not bad if you want a basic beer with lemon flavor."

""
"Pours brilliant gold with fast fuzzy bubbles. Swirls out to just liquid. See through. Helles nose, some citrus notes. Crisp lemon tart taste that fades into a chalky lager. Really smooth. Half lemonade half beer all the way. But real good. Refreshing summer beer."

"Tastes too sweet and citrusy, overly tangy. Good idea but either reduce the lemon or add some hops, Jim! Cloying aftertaste!"

"More malt flavor and sweetness than expected, but it delivers on the citrusy lemon promise. Grainy character is slightly offputting, and I would actually like the lemon character to linger more."

"A lemony beer soda, which it is supposed to be. Its tough to rate just due to the style. This is not a real style on this site. The lemony flavor is very enjoyable but it really doesn't have enough beer characteristics. I guess a good change of pace beer during the summer."
""
"An unsung hero of Cinco de Mayo. Straight from the bottle with this. surprisingly refreshing. it's not nearly as sweet as a "" beer with natural flavors added"" sounds. way better than leinenkugels summer shandy. tart. crisp. a crowd pleaser. great for what it is."
""
""
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. The beer pours clear golden with a finger length white head and an enormous amount of tiny bubbles. The aroma is of fresh lemon and some malt. It's pretty straightforward. The taste follows the nose, which is lemonade meets beer. There's the crisp lemon flavor that mingles well with the light malt profile. The body is light with strong carbonation. The finish is clean and crisp. The beer is very refreshing. For what this is, it's a good refreshing summer beer."
"The appearance is good, but not much head or aroma to speak of. I bought this in a sampler pack but it's definitely worth buying on its own."
"Scores reflect for what it is designed to be. Personally I would not buy this."

"The beer has a nice golden color with a snow white head that diminished quickly. The beer had a fruity aroma that reminded me of peaches. The beer is somewhat sweet and lemony with a fruit loop kind of finish on the back of the tongue, quite refreshing. This beer is light on the palate with almost no aftertaste and would be nice to drink on a hot summer afternoon."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty strong. Giant, foamy head and solid head. Nose is very light malt and lemon. Flavor follows suit with a very light flavor with a bit of lemon...not so much as to overwhelm though. Overall, this is decent quaff."
""
""

""
""
"Although I've never been a real Radler fan, kudos to Boston Beer for making a valiant attempt at a drinkable version. It's a clear, utterly clear, light golden color. The head quickly disappears, and long chains of bubbles rush up through the brew. The smell is notable even from a distance. Huge Lemon scents....It smells more like a lemon soda than a beer. If you hunt, there is a bit of malt underneath, but but not a lot. The taste is similar...very reminiscent of lemon soda, with a little hop finish. Interesting...not bad...but not quite beer either. It's got huge flavor...lots of lemon, some grass and grain, hops in the mid-taste through the finish, and a little malt underneath. Interesting, but not my style. Light in body. I bet this would be a thirst quencher if it were 90 degrees and sunny."

"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours pale straw with white, long lasting tall head and soda like carbonation, some lacing. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is lemonade and pale malt. Finish is short and unremarkable. This brew does not resemble beer."

"Easy to drink, refreshing. good for what it is. I would never buy a sixer of this though, I prefer my beer to taste like beer"

""
"This beer has a very light color and a light taste that gives you a feel of taking another sip before you even finish the sip you just took. I really like the fragrance of this beer, it hits you as your nose enters the mug as you tip to sip. I get a nice citrus flaver in my mouth after each and every sip I take. Love it!"
""
"D- It's enjoyable, but I'd prefer to mix my own radler and make it as beer heavy as I prefer. I also typically mix radlers using american wheat beers."
""
"Needs more lemon. Or less. As I see it SA could have gone two ways with this - a great Helles with a mild hint of lemon or a lighter beer bursting with lemon. They took the middle and the beer and the lemon compete rather than merge."

""
"Overall - Meh. Tastes like someone spiked my beer with sprite. In a way, it's kinda what they did. Waaaay too sweet. Think Bud Light Lime with stronger 'beer' character, and you've got a general idea of what this beer is all about. Not a fan."
"I'm really digging this one. and am pleasantly surprised. It's tough to pull off a beer like this that isn't one dimensional and unbalanced. I would definitely buy it again. A perfect beach beer, and because of the lower alcohol, something that won't ruin your day as you enjoy it."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this. It doesn't pack any spectacular punches, but it is rather refreshing. The smell and taste both compliment the same, citrusy lemon effect. I think this would be best enjoyed served quite cold on a very hot day. Give this to a non-beer drinker as I did. She said, ""This doesn't taste like beer at all!"" I would possibly get this again."
""
""
"Overall- Not bad tasting but not what I would call a ""beer."" If I was blindfolded a given this, I would never guess this was a beer. Reminds me more of a hard lemonade."

"Overall more soft drink than beer, not a favorite."

""

"It has been years since I had a lemon-flavored Snapple but after one gulp of this, it was like I had one yesterday. Lemon iced tea is the main flavor, though apparently there is some beer here. The citrus flavor is not unpleasant, just too much of a good thing. Lemon peel aftertaste with some bitterness. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Ralph's Supermarket in San Clemente."
"Pours a nice golden color with a decent head that sticks around a little while. There is a lot of activity. Has a pretty solid smell, my olfactory is always messed up so take it at your own risks, but a subtle lemon crisp scent is there. Man, this beer is still active as I type this. The mouthfeel is a little weak, smooth, but no necessarily in a great way. The taste is maybe just a little to fruity for my taste. I would like it to be a little crisper, and a bit more subtle. The bottle says the inspiration was from German cyclists who mixed beer and tart sparkling lemonade. This Porch Rocker was inspired by that. I wish it would have been crisper, a bit more tart, that would have added a little more substance to it."

"Poured out as a yellow golden color, very clear looking with a white head on top. Thin retention on top and a light lacing. The smell has plenty of lemon on the nose. Definitely smells like a shandy. The taste of the beer is sweet and has plenty of lemon flavors in there. The malts are hidden in this beer, you can't get too much from them. The mouthfeel of it was decent, lighter bodied, nice carbonation. Overall this needs to be enjoyed in the heat of the summer for sure, I think this beer will be much better on a hot day."

"O: [2.75] This is a high (for style) ABV radler with, I think, more lemon flavor than average. I feel it is a little too sweet, with lemon flavor that seems too artificial. In addition it lacks sufficient balance from hops."

"Not bad for the type, certainly not the worst I've had and as advertised, a good summer drink. Low alchol and palate-stripping clean taste make for a decent drink."
""
""
""
"The pour is a clear golden straw color with a short lived white head. Definite lemon on the nose with a strong sweetness. Light tartness, so sweet bready malt, and a very light floral hop aroma. Very fresh lemon note to this. The taste is actually very lemonade like. Sweet and sour flavors with some hints of grass, light bread, and a touch of hop flavor. Ever so slight biscuit malt notes, too."
""
"Overall, it's hard to grade this -- it's just kind of a unique beer. If you're the sort of person who can't get enough lemon, you'll be in heaven. If you like your beer to just be, you know, beer, it might not be for you."
""
""
""

"Overall / Drinkability: I've not had a true Radler before so it's hard for me to rate it according to that style so let me comment on it as a beer with a lot of lemon in it. It works for about half a glass, and then it kind of loses its charm. I think it would be better if it was hotter or I was outside enjoying this. Inside and after a meal it's just okay and not that drinkable - one is enough."
"Pours a clear golden color with a 1 inch foamy bone colored head that fades to nothing. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain and lots of lemon, lemon juice, and lemonade aromas. Taste is of malt/grain, yeast, and lemonade flavors on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer mainly for the fact that it's crisp and refreshing even if the aromas and flavors are not all that exciting."
""
""
"O - tolerable, especially if its super cold and it's very hot out. Otherwise, I would steer clear."
"Pours a clear light gold with a sudsy white head that settles to a thin cap. Moderate aromas of fresh lemon, crisp grain, and slightly doughy malt. Very crisp and fresh. Taste is similarly lemon-forward, nice and fresh, with more light, grainy malt and clean yeast. Lemon flavor is nice and authentic, not sweet and fake like other Shandys on the market. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a thin body and good carbonation. Overall a very refreshing and welcomed addition to the Sam Adams line-up. Hopefully this will be out again next Summer!"
"This is probably one of my least favorite beers that Samuel Adams has brewed. I have tasted this kind of beer before but I can't remeber which brewery....maybe Magic Hat....either way...very fruity, some spice. Definitely a summer beer. Just ok for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This isn't a true Radler...there isn't any lemonade in it. It's a lager with a bit of lemon zest and lemon flavoring. However, I would say that I enjoy this more than, say, Leine's Summer Shandy. There's a bit more depth and complexity here."
"Overall: Very Enjoyable beer. Found myself a new favorite."
""
"Clear straw yellow with a fizzy white cap. Some lingering foam, scant lacing. Big lemony aroma, zesty with notes of less harsh citrus (a bit of tangerine sweetness perhaps). Slightly peppery with slight wheat sourness. Lemonade character really overpowers the flavour, but it's tasty and refreshing if you like that sort of thing. Bitterness was lowish up front but lingered, and there was a hint of white pepper in the finish. Mild maltiness throughout and wheat character. Light bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly sticky and sweet texture. Overall, it was interesting, but not something I'm likely to go back to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Almost like they took a watered down Boston Lager and spiced it with a bunch of lemonade. Some of the taste is full out lemon sugar drink, but there is easily enough beer in there. I could have several in a row, but could not see myself stocking this as an everyday beer."
""
""
""
"Super drinkable. Not thirsty for another one but it was pretty refreshing."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a smooth whit head that quickly minimized to a thin layer. Smell is lemony and sweet, and that mainly dominates the nose. The beer tastes slightly tangy and sweet, it's lemony and the malty profile kicks in second with some bread and a hint of caramel. It has a medium body, not as light as I thought it would be. There is a perfect amount of carbonation and a clean finish."
"A very good summer beer!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Guess the Boston Beer Company wants a piece of the Radler/Shandy pie. They're going to have to do better than this if they want to compete with Miller and AB. Really a lackluster attempt."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not much for shandy-style beers. It's usually the artificial, syrupy qualities that throw me off. This one is better in that department, but it's still noticeable. It does exactly what it advertises. It's a light bodied lager with a distinct, lemonade flavor throughout. I'll pass in the future, but anyone enjoying this style should give it a try."
"If you like the lemony taste, drink the Summer Ale. The Summer Ale this year I have found to be particularly refreshing. The Porch Rocker just didn't cut it for me."
""
"Thin bodied and highly carbonated, I think this would be an easy beer to drink for a first time initiate to beer. But to serious drinker, this is a clearly, overly sweet offering. It's still tasty and easy to drink."
""
"O: Very solid summer beer, pretty smart on Mr. Koch's part to introduce this for the season, especially after the disappointment that is the Summer Ale."
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent summer offering. Seems like Sam Adams is really pushing the lemon zest in alot of their beers lately. Time to stop."
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing beer that is just a little too sweet to be a session. Good for summer time, and one of the better shandy styles I have encountered."
"Overall - Reminded me a bit of a bud light lime. It's better though.. but not by much. It's drinkable but not something I'd buy again. It's probably good for the style."
""
""
"Not much depth and does not pop like a Radler does obviously due to this being pretty much a full on beer. Perhaps if the body with lightened up a bit and a crisper carbonation this would be great."
"i'm reviewing this based on what its aiming to be: a summer thirst quencher. this would be a giant F if i were to rate this as a beer, but as a refreshing beverage it seemed to have accomplished its objective."
""
""
""
"Overall: not a fan of this one at all. simple and not really a beer. more of a mike hard watever variety."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Nice pale color with lots of carbonation. The smell was for me of grass and lemons. Taste was good, for a lemonade, but this is beer? If I want lemon I'd buy a Mike's. For a beer, this didn't do it for me, and I don't even understand the point of brewing this. The mouthfeel though was pleasant, and as a drink in the summer, I did like it. I however am reviewing this as a beer, I think?"
"12 ounce bottle, best before November 2012. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is mostly lemon peel and lemon candy (like lemonheads?), along with a bit of sweet malt. But it's mainly an artificial lemon aroma, not that it smells bad at all. The brew tastes like slightly sour lemon candy, and there's also some sugar substitute noticeable. Tastes a little worse the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's easy enough to drink, I guess. Mostly average overall, I only tried this because one of my friends gave me a couple bottles. I wouldn't pay for this brew, but I wouldn't turn one down if someone gave it to me, either."
"I really enjoy these beverages but on a completely different level than beer. This Sam Adams version is perhaps less sweet and slightly more beer-like than most but it's still a beer coctail and likely deserves separate criteria."
"Overall: Not bad, but I'd rather have a Leinie's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I thought this beer would help Sam Adams replace Coastal Wheat but that beer is better. This reminds me of Bud Light Lime, same soap taste."
""
"Overall - Another disappointing 2012 seasonal from Samuel Adams this year. To be honest, I loved the seasonals right up until last years Oktoberfest. I'm not sure what happened, whether to blame a taste-change or the brewery, but each Samuel Adams I try is filled with an unbalanced mixture of hops and malt. The lemon in this tastes very unnatural. I was disappointed with the Whitewater IPA this year as well, and Noble Pils hasn't tasted the same to me either. I will not be purchasing this again. It sits low in the fruit/vegetable beer category, and I would much rather drink a Leinenkugels Summer Shandy when it comes to a refreshing summer drink spiced with lemon."
""
""
""
"Taste/overall: Lemonade meets lager, with some saccharine stirred in for sweetness; now granted, I know this doesn't sound all that exciting, but for what the beer is, it works. I would be more than happy so spend four hours on a hot saturday afternoon mowing a lawn, just so long as I had a six pack of this to plow through."
""
"O: Again, not a bad beer for the style. Serves as a nice alternate to Leinie Summer Shandy or even to Corona at a cookout."
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is, as advertised, effervescent. I expect this beer to be light, which it is, and crisp, which it is, but it gets too filling and is a little difficult to swallow with all that effervescence. It tones down a little pat of the way through and gets smooth, but it also thins a little at that point."
"Drinkability is nice on a balanced beer. Other radlers are dominated by lemon tastes. Porch Rocker has a wheat base that balances the refreshing lemon very well. This is a limited beer and I would grab it if you ever get a chance."
""
""
""
"Flavor is well-balanced with the lemon being not so forward as in other similar brews I've had. Enjoyable."
"Overall it drinks much better than their ""summer ale"" might consider getting a six next time I am at the shop."
""
"Overall bleh, fake tasting beer that I would expect from a macro company, not sam adams, but then again this is probably more to get the ladies from leinenkugel to switch to this, but not my cup of tea."
""
""
"Side note: I think this should be a different style in itself, with all the different ones coming out on the market. It's difficult to rate it as strictly a fruit beer, but that's just my opinion."
""
""
"OVERALL: More or less a Radler, with a more American ale feel. Good lemonade flavor with a beer, pretty tasty. Samuel Adams delivers another decent summer option."
"Pours a pale helles like golden color with a bright white head forming thick, this one seems to do the style justice, even talking visually by itself. Aroma has citrus zest pale biscuit malts, really smells like lemonade, but there's still a beer in there somewhere. Flavor speaks better of the actual beer brewed here, refreshing hints of lemon zest with quality biscuit toasted malts and mild light herbal hops in the back end. Mouthfeel is light with moderate to strong carbonation flowing forth, a bit of bitter zest left behind on the palate but nothing too sweet or cloying in this beer. Overall, a quality refreshing beer that goes down smooth, bubbly drinking summer beer blended with lemonade."
""
"Overall – It is refreshing, but not something I am typically looking for in a beer. It is much better then something like a Mike’s hard lemonade, so if you are in the mood for something of that like take this instead."
""
""
"O: Was expecting more flavor, got a pretty flatline taste.. drinkable beer however, just not very BAM! to the point where it stands out vs. the competiton. . . only way Id try it again would maybe be if it was on draught ever."
""
""
"If you are looking for a crisp, refreshing, summer beer on a warm day this one certainly hits the spot."
""
"Well I could see myself with a six pack of this on a Saturday afternoon after a grass cutting session. Definately recommend for a summer beer!"
""
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very heavy on the lemon with some wheat notes thrown in. The flavor is similar. This tastes more like lemonade than it does a beer, but there is a little bit of wheat and biscuit malt to make it somewhat beer like. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not much to like here, but I guess it tastes about like what the brewery was going for."
"The beer is pretty decent but has some off flavors on the finish of band-aids and wet cardboard but their faint and don't take away from the beer too much. In my opinion much more drinkable than other fruit beers. Sam Adams has allowed the fruit to still be the star without overpowering. Not my cup of tea but for what it is, pretty refreshing and well brewed."
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has a nice golden yellow body with a quick dissolving head that leaves nothing. The smell is of fresh lemons and some hops. The taste is tart of lemon and with a little bit of hop on the back of the tongue. This beer is well carbonated and the mouth feel is great and overall a really good summer beer."
""
"A pleasant beer to drink on a hot day. Still not as good as its Geman counterparts but a good effort by the boys in Boston."
"Overall I like it. Its very different and good for what it is. Way better than Shock tops and even better than Leinenkugel's summer Shandy."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like it. Can't say that I'd rate it very high but if you must sample this style, go with this over the Saranac example. Of course, I'm expecting the Shock Top example to fall flat. Radler, Shandy, call it what you want."
""
"Taste-Lemon zest/honey, very light-bodied. Becomes a bit cloying upon warming. Best served well-chilled. Very shandy-like. Not great by any means but kudos to S.A. for putting different style out there."
""
"Surprised to get this when I did today, and I'm a bit skeptical about it, despite my love of radlers (damn you, time in Germany!). Givin' it the ol' college try: It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of short-lived fizzy white foam. The nose comprises lemon peel, light cardamom, and what may or may not be cracked wheat. The taste leads off with a stark and somewhat artificial lemon flavor, followed quickly by a somewhat wheaty apparition that intertwines with the lemon for the duration, the two toning each other down a bit whilst working their conjoined way down the gullet. It's not necessarily bad, but not something that stands out as being particularly tasty, either. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation (bordering on fizzier) and a slightly watery feel. Overall, an okay neo-radler at best, something I wouldn't purposefully reach for again, but also something I wouldn't really spurn if offered to me in passing."
