"Very easy drinking fruit beer, which I'm not typically a fan of. Sour apple is certainly forward. Sweet, but not overpowering or puckering sweet."
""
""
""
""
"O.  A nice take on an apple ale.  Very easy to drink.  Great on a hot summer day.  Not too acidic or sweet that you can only have one.  Would have no problem drinking again."
""
""
""
""
"Nice straight forward apple ale. Not too sweet. Not as complex as some of New Glarus' other offerings, but definitely enjoyable."
""
"Straight up Apple juice.. With malt."

"Apple Cider assault on the senses. Wonderful rendition of a fruit beer. Best cider alternative I've had"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's pretty good, but apple just isn't an interesting enough fruit for me."
""
"Such an amazing apple flavor.  It is not artificial at all.  Nice and sweet with some mild tartness.  New Glarus can do no wrong with fruit beers."
""
"Kinda funky. Like sweet apple candy. Just too sticky, sweet for my liking."
""
""

""
"Instead of an apple ale I feel like this taste more like an apple cherry raspberry sour.  Really good!"
""
""
"Delicious! This is how I always wanted hard cider to taste, but it never does. Tastes and smells like actual apples and is not too sweet."
"love this beer.. amazing with cinnamon whiskey as a sidekick"
""
""
""
""
"Light copper color, strong fresh apple smell and taste. Would not describe this as a beer but rather a carbonated apple juice. Very refreshing and slightly on the dry side which is nice because it's not overly sweet like apple juice or cider typically is."
""
""
""
""
""
"perhaps I just wasn't in the mood as I LOVE all NG fruit beers, but this one was just a hopped up apple juice to me."

"Overall: this is a sweet and appley beer.  I like it a lot, but it's a bit on the sweet side to just quaff all day."

"Overall: Another excellent fruit beer from New Glarus. So much clean, crisp fruit character and incredibly easy to drink. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance."
"12 oz. bottle purchased at the brewery, unknown brewing/bottling date, poured into my New Glarus flute-style glass, drank over 30 minutes"

"Sourish apple juice, authentic, swear i can taste the peel shavings. Flavor leaves a sour, creamy feel. This one left me a lot on the fence and a few days after, i still can't quite seem to make up my mind if i l would try it again or not. Interesting for sure."

"O: I'm not sure what to make of a beer that tastes this much like apple juice - if that's what you're looking for, you might want to go as high as a 4.5, but for me, as a stand-alone product, for which I had no expectations, it was a good-tasting, easy-drinking ale that went real easy on the abv, but not necessarily what I'm inclined toward in an ale."

"Pours light copper with little head. Smells like apple cider. Very fruity aroma. Interesting flavor. Lots of apple flavor. Very tart. At the same time, lots of malt flavor. If you can imagine a nice amber beer with tart apples, blended oddly very nice, because it sounds horrible, but is actually great, this would be it. This is definitely not a cider. This is a must try if you want something different."
""
"A beer with strong cider character."
""
""
""
"Overall - So there is excellent apple flavor here. But If there is a brown ale base used here it has been overcome by the apples. If you like apples, you're going to love this, as the apples are bold and natural flavored. I'm glad to have tried and rated this but I will not seek it out again."

"Brilliant deep copper writer a lingering, frothy cream head. Aroma is dominated by red apple flesh and green apple skin. Slightly floral, and I don't know if it's just suggestive, but I get a little cinnamon. Flavor is the best apple product I've ever had. I'm not a huge apple fan, but that lingering apple flavor is balanced nicely between sweet red and a sour note reminiscent of an oud bruin. Pleasantly surprised with the complexity. Wish I had bought more."

"2013 bottle. Pours a clear golden color with 1/2 finger bubbly white head that dissipates quickly. A tangy apple bite comes through in the nose, maybe a little caramel in there too. It smells like cider in a way that no other ale does: right up my alley. Taste is appley and tangy up-front. The sides give a little pucker. It's pretty much apple until the finish, which has some malty wheat flavor. After the apple fades (5 mins or so) there's a vegetal aftertaste that I don't recall from the previous bottling. Mouthfeel is medium with lots of carbonation, which tingles the tongue and the throat on the way down. Overall it's well-made, lots of apple, some acidity, some tanginess. It isn't very complicated but it's very, very enjoyable. It tastes a bit like cider, but it isn't, so I give it extra points for the style. Here's hoping this special edition brew continues to make a regular appearance."

"O: Very similar to a cider, maybe a bit thicker and maltier than most. Overall good, but not NG’s best."

"A very delicious and refreshing brew that stands up as a beer instead of a cider."
"Not amazing, but Raul likes it. Yep!"
"Pours a clear amber brown with bubbly tan head that settles pretty quickly into a medium tan collar. Aroma is of warm apple cider: brown sugar, cinnamon, some faint clove. Taste is wonderfully the same; apple, sweet caramel and some spice. Fairly carbonated and medium body. Another amazing beer from New Glarus!"
""
"Overall: ehhh, i can't say i am disappointed because i didn't expect much from this one. overall it just tastes like cider and there isn't much else too it."
"O: Geat representation of style They sure know how to make fruit beers in wisconsin and would sure like to get more for those warmer days ahead. Next time I will have to try this ala mode."
""
""
"O- Tasty and refreshing, but I could've used some more carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Impressive beer, takes the apple ale game to another level. Flavors are reminiscent of the best apple ciders, with enhanced body and malt backbone. Suggestions of caramel malt lends a nice layer of complexity, but this beer is really as straightforward as the name. Well done."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"High A-"
""
"O: I'll admit I'm not a fan of hard cider's, so I wasn't expecting to be wowed here. But this stuff is solid, New Glarus just can't do any wrong with fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Its like apple juice as a beer. New Glarus does a very good job with these fruit beers."
""

""
""

""

""

""
""
"Quite a delicious beer, much more substantial and full then a hard cider. Malt adds a warm sweetness and bready flavor, coupled with the light spice notes this tastes like a delicate apple tart"
""
""
""
""
"Beer is light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensit, resulting in a lightly foamy (1/5) and otherwise smooth (4/5) mouthfeel that's a bit watery overall. Closes dry, with substantial sweetness clinging to the palate."
"Overall- Basically apple cider that happens to be beer. Solid, good for the fruit beer style but not something I'd go out of my way to secure again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - New Glarus just nails fruit beers every time. While not my preferred style, I can totally respect what they do with these because they're delicious and super easy to drink. Apple Ale is a fun, sweet and refreshing take that I really enjoy, well done!"

"Another outstanding entry in New Glarus' ``Thumbprint'' series. This is the third one I've had and have thoroughly enjoyed each one of them. My hats off to this amazing little brewery that's been around longer than many people realize (and thanks to Ri0 for hooking me up). I really envy our Wisconsin BAs for being able to get these outstanding beers so easily."
""
"This beer smells and tastes like apples, almost to the point where it is hard to remember you are drinking a beer. The apple flavor was very smooth though and it was enjoyable to drink."
""
"O- A very well done apple ale by New Glarus. They have this corner of the market nailed down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden color, with splotchy lacing, and little to no head. The nose is a brown sugar and of course, sweet apples. Slightly viscous with light carbonation and a lingering finish, but I wish the finish was a little bit longer. I'm going to keep the other three that I haven't tried them when the weather warms up. I will certainly look for more in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The beginning of this brew is so wonderful but just does not have the gusto that New Glarus other fruit beers have. More of a gimmicky feel then a truly great fruit beer. Would be a good choice for a cider fan."
""
"Honestly, this couldn't be any more delicious if they tried. It's adult apple juice basically. It's better than any cider I can recall having."
"overall another absolutely amazing fruit beer from New glarus!"
""
""
"Apple Ale is another good beer from New Glarus but, in my opinion, should be done away with in the Thumbprint series. The fruited 750s are much more enjoyable and the limited number of Thumbprint releases would be better served leaving this out of the yearly lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I can get used to this New Glarus fruit beer thing, haven't been let down yet."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an ever so hazy golden amber with some flimsy white edging. Aroma is clearly apples, a nice blend of tart and sweet. A bit of wheat and spice on the end. Taste is similar, very tasty and fresh apple juice with a grainy/wheat finish and a lingering sweetness. Crazy delicious. Crisp and medium bodied."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very much like Dan's other fruit beers, sweet and clean. This one is somewhat cider-like but with palpable notes of malted wheat."
""
""
"Another win for New Glarus, and it's no surprise it's yet another fruit infused beer. I could hoard this stuff in my house. It's flavorful and simple, but there are some undeniable complexities that come straight from the yeast and brewing process used. Beers already taste good when there's actual fresh fruit added, and they taste even better when there's a spicy, funky yeast to back it up. Wonderful, tasty stuff overall."
""
"O- Dont have much to compare this one to but its spot on with what it clams to be. Lots of apples, crisp and juicy. A apple ale."
""
"I really enjoy this and want to try more new glarus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall awesome apple ale. Better then any apple cider I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The ladies AND guys will be surprised at how good it tastes."
""
""
"Pours a light apple cider hue with a surprisingly lasting head. The smell is all apple and is crisp and fresh. While this ale has a fresh apple taste, it is well balanced with some tartness. There is a lingering beer taste underneath the heavy apple flavor. It is well carbonated as expected. Overall, this is a great apple ale - fresh, sweet but balanced - but without letting you forget that you are drinking a beer. Another fine brew from New Glarus."
""
""
""
""
"A fun drinking beer lots of sweetness. Sour apple aroma with slight sour taste more sweet tasting to me. Little to no hop aroma and taste. Slight cloudness in glass. Might be fun to mix this with a sour lambic to see what you got. Over a refreshing beer that I would try again."
"This is pretty unique and fun to try. It's not entirely my cup of tea, but I can see this being a popular choice for many people."

"Pours a hazy gold with a broken white sheet atop. Smells like apples! And maybe a bit of cherry juice as well. Flavor is sweet apples with just a hint of tartness on 'em, some caramelized sugars, some bits of grain. Medium on thin with prickly low-mod carb and a semi dry finish. I like this beer, I bet it's cheaper than the Lindeman's also. I wish there were more of these apple ales, I quite like them when done well."
"Apple Ale? They weren't joking. This is one of those beers that didn't have a variety of flavors. It had one big delicious flavor and that's it. Extremely drinkable. I would drink another bottle. Big thanks to fellow BA mnbuffalo for hooking me up with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Another great fruit beer from New Glarus, no surprise there. This is really sweet, and could probably benefit from some tartness. Regardless, the amount of apple flavor here is amazing. I hope to drink this again. Repeatedly. Perhaps out of a juice box."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not something I'd drink every day but an interesting cider / ale hybrid. It's like apple pie in a glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very tasty. Like grown up apple juice. It certainly echoes hard cider to a degree, except for the fact that the apple notes here taste wholesome and fresh as opposed to chemically induced. Additionally, the beer doesn't wander off into a syrupy sweet mess. Booze isn't detectable, though I'm not getting a lot malt or hop presence either. Pretty impressive (and tasty) effort here if you are a fruit beer fan."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from trade. Pours cloudy orange brown. Smell is all apple cider, some fermented apples, and more apple juice. Prickly carbonation up front. Apple flavors and something else I can’t put my finger on. Light caramel comes out as I get deeper. Very effervescent. Dry finish keeps it from being a very sweet cider. Neat beer, but really teetering on regular old cider. Don’t get much malt presence here. However, I am not complaining as this is quite yummy."
""
""
""
""
"Duplicating the flavor of a cider is an interesting feat, but it is not what I am really looking for in a beer. I would drink this again, but I have enjoyed New Glarus' other fruit beers more."

"O-a great fruit beer, great blend of flavors and while it has easy drinkability, I don't think I would have more than one at a time"
""
"Amazing flavor for 4%, Flavor wise it tastes more like 10%!"
"Fantastic. Fruit beer done right. Sweet without being too sweet - one of the hardest things to accomplish. I didn't want this one to end - needless to say, I'll be getting my hands on some more New Glarus stuff, pronto. Those guys know what they're doing up there in ol' Wisconsin."
"O-This beer is delicious and I would love to have more at my disposal. Thanks again for the experimentation New Glarus."
""
""
""
"the beer poors honey gold with a wispy white head. the nose is diacetyl buttery apple pie candy. same killer fresh baked apple pie taste with a tart dry finish. light bodied drinkable, tons of fresh apple, tart apple finish. damn, this is a very tasty beer that is exactly as described/expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's apples in a bottle with booze. A bit too sweet overall and lacking that tart edge I like with other New Glarus fruit offerings. Solid nonetheless."
"D - It's akin to Braggot substituting cider for mead, and I'm not sure if there's a name for this style. The freshness of the fruit and perfect balance are outstanding. I do wish there was more malt character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I'm pretty surprised by this beer. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but New Glarus definitely delivered again! I don't think I could drink more than 12 ounces of this beer, for being only 4% I'm finding it pretty sweet and rich. The way this beer blurs the lines between an ale and cider is pretty unreal. Keep doing what you do New Glarus!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well hell. It's hard to rank beers like this. It's basically pure apple with some caramel and some wheat. It's simple but very tasty and easy to drink. And it does exactly what it intends to do, much like New Glarus' other fruit beers. Top notch for the style, IMO, barring their red/raspberry ales which are glorious."
"O - I'm loving this beer much more than I initially thought I would when I purchased it. It delivers such a balanced flavor without being overkill. These guys definitely know what they are doing with fruit beer."
""
""
""
"O- This is definitely the closest to apple juice that I've experienced in a beer, even more so then hard apple ciders. In my opinion it was well executed, very good for an apple ale, and probably my favorite out of the NG fruit ales. If you like apple juice and beer I'm sure you will love this."

"O - i am really upset i didnt buy more than a 4 pack of this. hopefully i will be able to find again next time i am in Wisconsin. I could drink a bunch of this in warm weather, very refreshing. I might even include in a cider tasting to do some side by sides."
""
""
""
""
"I am a big fan of cider, but in all honesty, New Glarus Apple Ale is better than ANY cider I've ever had. Like I said, that malt finish replaces the low-point of cider with one of the high-points of bier."
"O: Very unique. If I didn't know better, I would just guess that I was drinking the best apple cider I've ever had. Doesn't taste of beer or alcohol at all. Simply lovely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great first impression of New Glarus. I have their other fruit beers, and this just gets me excited to try those. Drinks like a cider, yet the grain at the end proves that this is indeed a beer."

"excellent unique beer from what is rapidly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Big thanks goes out to StayWhatYouAre2 for sending this one my way! Served from bottle into a New Glarus flute (also from StayWhatYouAre2). Poured a golden yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, green apple, pastry, bread, sugar, and apple pie. The flavor was of sweet malt, pastry, green apple, sugar, apple pie, and subtle wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Upon first investigation of this one I was knocked back by the aroma of apple pie. I couldn’t believe what I was smelling! This beer smelled like America! So right out of the gate I was excited to try this one. The flavor even carried over on this one with the same components. I’m really glad this was the case because usually a lot is lost between the two when I really enjoy the aroma. Really well done on this one New Glarus!"
""
"O - This was pretty good and definitely interesting. That said, my expectations for this was that it would be an apple version of WBR and it didn't live up to that."
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, one of the better straight up fruit beers I've had. Great apple flavor, effervescent sparkling apple, light mulling spices and sweetness, overall quite nice. I could drink tons of these."
"Very nice beverage. Definitely something that my significant other enjoys. Will seek out more next autumn...New Glarus..if you read this..please make a Brett-ed version of this. I feel that it could turn out incredible!"
""
"Pours dark brown/black copper, hazy, no foam. Strong apple cider smell. Pronounced. Taste is all apple, some cinnamon notes. Strong apple. Finishes with a mild malt that switches back to beer. Otherwise, its very cidery. Smooth and light. Good if you want a well made hard cider knock off. Really clever."
""
"Hazy orange with a finger or two of white head - retention is minimal but there's some lacing. Nose has some apple flesh, and some mild spicing vaguely resmebling some apple pie. Malt is semi-sweet, and almost resembles a cider. More cooked apples and spicing that further resembles apple pie, sweet malt and a sorta-dry finish. Fairly high carbonation that I wasn't crazy about, but a few swirls took this down to an amazing level. New Glarus does it again - best fruit beers around."
""
"Overall: Now this is a great apple ale. the only other type of apple ale i have had is Shipyard applehead, and this new glarus kicks it out of the ballpark. This is exactly what i was looking for in a fruit beer. New Glarus hits a homerun on this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is really fantastic. Imagine this, your wife and kids are making Christmas cookies and drinking hot apple cider. You're looking to join in, but instead want something with a little kick instead. And you wonder to yourself, ""What should I go buy?"" BAM! New Glarus Apple Ale, that's what. This is a great fall/winter seasonal. Pours like pressed apple cider with a beautiful sour smell. I mentioned to a good friend that this makes me feel like a cross between Father Christmas and a Founding Father, as I imagine this style was big in the mid 1700s. Sour apple taste, that's it man, apple, no malt, no hops, just apples. A little tingly on the tongue, but nothing special in the mouth. High drinkability due to low ABV and a great taste. I should save a couple of these for Christmas Eve, but they won't last that long."
""
""
"Like most New Glarus fruit beers, this isn't really what I was expecting, but it's a welcome and delicious surprise. My biggest problem with it is that it's like drinking apple juice, with a small chaser of beer. I wish there were more beer in it. I'm conflicted - as a fruit drink, it's freaking delicious. As a beer, well, it doesn't really strike me as a beer."
"Tastes very much like it smells only just a little bit gleefully alcoholic. It tastes like fizzy apple cider with just a tiny bit of booze burn near the back, and then the aftertaste is a chewy yeast that's similar to the one they use in their fruit beers. I pick up no nodes of brown ale but I absolutely don't need to because this gets the job done just fine."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting and pretty tasty take on a fruit beer. Its like fresh apple juice but has just enough malt presence to make it a beer."
""
"O. This was a great representation of an apple cider beer. I love that it had a lot of carbonation and was full of fresh apple flavor. It is sweet but not overbearing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is on the fence about fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sooo fresh and inviting. I could drink this stuff all day!"
""
"O: I love this beer. I need to get more of it. Extremely sessionable and something I could drink with dinner. New Glarus, how are you this good with putting fruit in beer?"
"I give this one 7 green bananas."
"O - A delicious apple fruit beer that isn't the garbage that is out there from the Macros. Get some!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer. I had no idea what I'd think of it, but holy crap...I need to get more."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm glad the base brown ale malts still have some say in the taste and it doesn't come off as a cider. A nicely put together beer with the main focus being the apples. Definitely a nice fall treat."
""
""
""
"O: good beer even though I'm not the biggest fan of apple-related products all the time. Thanks a lot too Treebs for giving me this as an extra!"
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There are many ciders that lack the depth and intensity of apple aroma and flavor as found in this beer. The age may have slight softened the beer but it still an outstanding ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a clear amber-gold with a slight white head that fades to a thin ring and a small island of haze. Absolutely lovely apple aromas emanate from the glass, not quite real, but not quite fake. Reminds me a bit of an apple schnapps by Dad drinks. Taste is obviously apple-forward, but a much more identifiable ""Red Apple"" flavor as opposed to the generic ""Apple"" aromas. There's a touch of light grain, some honey, and an almost cinnamon-like quality in here too. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy, with a fairly thin body and good, carbonation. Overall an entirely enjoyable brew that 100% lives up to my expectation. I feel that a six-pack of this would disappear quite fast. Cheers to The CPJ for sending it my way!"
"O - Overall this was a delicious beer, love the sour apple/green apple/candied apple flavours and aromas going on."

"O - Sweet candy apple. Wierd, but good."

"Definitely worth a try."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the sweet apple flavor."

"Cost: $2.99 for a 12 oz bottle or $10.99 for a four pack."
"Pours a clear, light amber golden color, well carbonated with a wispy white head. Nose is heavy on green apple, slightly tart, bready, mild honey, and leafy earth. Flavor is surprisingly well balanced between a golden ale, bready malt and dough, with a slightly less artificial than Jolly Rancher green apple sweet/tart flavor. Medium full body, strong carbonation and a sticky, doughy finish. Wasn't pleasantly surprised to enjoy the entire bottle alone, despite some initial hesitation that this would turn too cloying."

"Pours a clear golden color...almost pilsner or BMC like...medium white head. Scent is WOW...a fresh orchard of red apples...red and fuji apple aromas. Not the typical green apple aroma I get from most Belgian beers. Very unique. Hints of cinnamon. This smells better than any apple cider or sparkling cider I have ever had...and the fact that it's a beer absolutely blows my mind. Taste is initially sweet red apple...which somehow changes to a VERY mildly tart green apple. I know I read reviews of this beer tasting like a green jolly rancher...and they are absolutely right. That is my favorite jolly rancher, and now, it's in beer form. This is weird, because this is not a beer that I would drink on the regular, but for the style being a ""fruit beer""....this is the best I've ever had. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and sparkling cider-like. Drinkability is extremely high. Overall, this beer is tasty...I don't care who you are, if you are a fan of apples, you will love this beer. The fresh-apple flavor is like nothing I have ever experienced... other than fresh-squeezed apple juice of course."
""
"This beer blew me away. It tastes nothing like a traditional apple cider would, instead this is literally an apple ale/beer. There are so many wonderful apple qualities and flavors here to keep me coming back again and again. I'd love to drink this year-round."
"The reveal: New Glarus Apple Ale. Well this is a great beer to send in this BIF, if only because it is so polar in all accounts. Reading the label it says they used green apple juice, I'm wondering if it was concentrate."
"Overall Impression- Quite interesting! Caught too much artificial flavors in the mouthfeel though... Will still be giving this one an above average rating. Not sure I've had an apple ale like this ever before! I recommend picking this one up along with the others from New Glarus."
""
"A very smooth and easy drinker. Warm or cold weather, one can consume a lot of this complex fruit beer. I only wish this were a regular beer by New Glarus"
"poured a light clear golden yellow with a little bit of a foam around the brim. as soon as the bottlecap pried open my face was hit by a curtain of apples. i've had plenty of cider in my days, and i have to say the only one that ever tasted like real apples was harpoon's - but this is just out of this world. you can tell they used a few different kinds of apples for sure. the taste was not as sweet as i expected, which is great! i think maybe they use their base recipe for spotted cow on this one. same mouthfeel with the fizziness and crisp. this is a great experiment by them, and i am glad i have 3 more to save for the summer months."
""
""
"O) If you don't like apples, then it should be obvious, this is not the ale for you. If you do like apples, then you will likely enjoy this immensely. New Glarus knows how to make a good fruit beer, and this offering does not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - NG does fruit beers better than most others. This is a great anytime beer, but 1 per sitting is good enough because of the sweet apple nature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was another good fruit beer from NG; I've yet to have a bad one from them. This was exactly what I was expecting/hoping for, as it tastes a lot like hard cider/apple juice. While I enjoyed the NG Cran-bic more, if I could buy any of these fruit beers off the shelf I'd always have some in my fridge."
""
""
"O- this is a delicious fruit beer, clean and crisp, however no more than two or else your stomach will start feeling it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Excellent fruit beer, I would not expect less from New Glarus, and one of my personal favorites of the style. It never lets you forget you're actually drinking a beer, either. Must try if you're a fan of fruity beer or apples, and recommended if you wanna try something new. Good stuff."
""
"Thanks to Spdklz for this great extra. Another great fruit beer from New Glarus. Nothing overly complex, but this is just a delicious liquid embodiment of tart apples. Starts out slightly sweet but finishes fairly dry so that it's not cloying. Light to medium bodied with fairly high carbonation. Quite a refreshing brew. Would love to get more of this."
""
"Cheers."
""
""
""
"I couldn't see knocking back an entire 4 pack to myself, but I think a few ounces of this stuff during a drinking session really hits the spot. They add enough other stuff to it to make it right up the alley of apple pie (crust, cinnamon)."
"O=Recommended try, especially when it first comes out, on hotter days, and well chilled."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A real fun beer to drink."
"o - a pretty good apple ale... Enjoyable"
"This beer pours a very light bodied and clear rusty copper in color with a very light and quickly dissipating off white lacing. It doesn't look like much. The aromas are of slightly buttery, spiced caramel apples. It smells great, like roasted apples with cinnamon. The flavors mimic the aromas with more of an apple juice/cider type flavor than the roasted apples. It has nice flavor and isn't cloying like Lindemans Pomme. The closest thing I could relate it to is perhaps Leinenkugels Apple Spice that they used to make. It drinks really light in body and has nice flavor. At four percent, this is incredibly drinkable. My fiancé would love this."

"Well, Apple Ale looks lousy, tastes great. Insert your own misogynystic joke here, I suppose. I liked this slightly better than Raspberry Tart even, but like RT, due to the sugar/sour experience, I couldn't ever throw down a huge amount at one sitting. But I will be buying it."
""
""
""
"A really nice apple beer. I wish it was just a touch more bitter and a bit less sweet, but I'd only be nitpicking. I love this stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
"My hat off to Dan as usual (probably the only exception was choco-abbey... man, what was that about?)"
"O- Not anything like I was expecting. Hard to classify this one as a beer, more of a hard cider I would say. Nonetheless, I will see if I can get it again!"
""
""
"Drink- Damn this was tasty. Between all their Fruit beers, they really should move out to all parts of the country. They are killing it with this style. This would be a great summer beer here in So.Cal. I would love to have this one again."
""
""
"O-This is a decent beer, but reminds me more of a cider or even a ""Cidral"" (Mexican cabornated apple soda). For 11.99, I would seek another beer, but I was suckered into it since the likelihood of finding this beer in Illinois is rare."
""
"I really like this beer. I have never tasted a beer quite like this before. As mentioned before it's like drinking a sparkling wine or champaigne. I also like that this is a beer that I could sit down and drink with my wife, as she really enjoys it as well. New Glarus Apple Ale is hard to come by in my neighorhood but I will again go through the effort to find it again."
""
""
"Couldn't drink more than one in a sitting, but this is an excellent fruit beer."
""
""

"O: NG is the king of fruit beers and this one is no exception. I would love a case of this to pull from on the days I feel like a break from big, boozy stouts and barleywines."
""
""
""
"Taste is pretty sweet. It has a lot of apple flavor (obviously). Beer flavor is light, but it works well for what it is. It is a fruity beer and lives up to that designation. Overall a good specialty beer with some interesting flavor and is different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O- Strike it up as another world class fruit beer from Dan and company. My only (minor) complaint is the head retention. I could see how some would say this becomes cloying after awhile but I think it's great. I'd really like to see this be a year-round 750ml offering from New Glarus, right along side it's cousins....brothers?"
""
"O- This one reminds me of a cider or wine cooler or better yet a glass of apple juice. Too sweet and has no taste or anything that I enjoy from beer. I do however understand how some people enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: This blows ciders away, massive apple flavors but nice touches with the biscuit and spicing that is so easy to drink, refreshing and flavorful. Such a great take on beer."
""
"Dan proves, once again, that he is the unabridged king of fruit beers. This is a must try for anyone living in the state of Wisconsin, and an envy of anyone living out of state."
"O: This is a sweet beer I could drink over and over again. Its a very attractive beer with lots of apple flavor and smell and highly drinkable with a small abv. Delicious."
""
"Since I like apple candy, I like the beer. As a homebrewer and cider maker, I realize how difficult it can be to make fruits really shine in a beer the way they do here, so I really appreciate the effort. But as a guy who loves the diversity of apples on the planet, I wish this beer had more character."
"O- It's good, it tastes good. I am disappointed, am I wrong to want more complexity, something else going on? Not something I am going to go out of my way to try again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent brew. The fruit is balanced nice with the malt. Normally I'd be disappointed by the absence of hops, but not with this one."
""
"I love this beer. This will forever remain on my wants list!"

"6/6/2011"
""

"Overall: A savory drink. Very clean apples with a nice finish. I really like the concept but I wish they would have increased the malt and hop profile to make it a bit more well rounded. It is a bit too sweet for me and tastes more like apple cider than a beer....a great apple cider, but wished it had more of a balance."
"O: Goes down very easy, tasty, not filling, low kick, decent representation of style. This isn't a beer. It's a great lil drink though I feel more goes in the line of cider than beer....but I would hit it up again."

"A buddy brought home a bunch of Unplugged beer from New Glarus. The Unplugged Apple Ale pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the apple pie. I get all of the notes I expect, with some cinnamon, apple and bready notes. The flavor also doesn’t disappoint. I get cinnamon, apple and crust notes. This beer tastes like an apple pie. Awesome. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. There are lots of breweries out there, but I don’t think anyone does fruit beers better than our friends from Wisconsin."
"Easy drinking and tasty. "
"Overall, this is as advertised. Nothing that blows me away but nothing that makes me run back for more."
"Overall: I don't know how New Glarus does it, but their fruit beers are great. This is another success from this brewery. I would have another."
"CHEERS"
"o - very close to a cider and another very enjoyable fruit beer from new glarus."
"I have to imagine that the apple qualities of this beer have faded over the past several months. At this point, it is still a very tasty and sweet drink, albeit one that's a tier below other New Glarus offerings of the style."
"I love everything from New Glarus. I'm fortunate to have loving relatives in Wisconsin, but would love to have more regular access to their offerings. Very solid lighter beer and very unique."
"O-wow. So good. "" liquid McDonald's apple pie"""
"Another very nice beer in the Unplugged series."
"Even given my excellent experiences with new glarus I wondered how they would end up capturing apple in a beer. To get to the point, they didn't disappoint. This is straight up the most excellent applesauce you've had in your life.. in a beer. Spicy apples in the nose, spicy apples in an ephemeral taste. This is delicious, and might even trump the cranbic. I'm very happy I got to try this and would recommend it to anyone within a many-mile radius of it."
"O- this is awesome. I love it, and wish I had better access to New Glarus"
"Really interesting brew, a bit of a novelty, but definitely something unique and neat to try."
"redone for 2012, tasted less like apple juice and more like a beer. increased the review."
"A terrific little brew here..."
"One of the best, most refreshing beers I've ever had. The light ABV is incredibly refreshing. Had a bottle of this from an extra in a trade. Pours a cider-like, amber color. A thin, whispy head that dissipates quickly. This wreaks of apples in a good way. Wow. The taste is PURE apples and some spice. Almost like a sparkling apple cider, but you know this is a beer when you drink it. The mouthfeel is crisp and effervescent. You can't wait for the next face full of this stuff. Can't wait to have more."
"O- Pretty one dimensional tasting beer, but overall really tasty, I love New Glarus fruit/vegetable beers and this one does not disappoint."
"I can't say I would want to drink this beer more than once a month, but on a cool fall day this sucker would be completely phenomenal. Spot on."
"O- I've had this one before, and I enjoy it immensely every time. This is a great beer to change up my drinking routine and get me out of a rut. Tastes of pure apple with nice carbonation and amazing crispness."
"O: Very easy drinking. Thought the aroma was better than the flavor profile, and wish it tasted like it smelled. But it was still good and a beer I would gladly drink again."
"Overall: Awesome to see beers this far down the spectrum of sweetness and even being away from most qualities of beer. You'd think this was a cider though after a few sips some malt comes through."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the apple pie. I get all of the notes I expect, with some cinnamon, apple and bready notes. The flavor also doesn’t disappoint. I get cinnamon, apple and crust notes. This beer tastes like an apple pie. Awesome. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. There are lots of breweries out there, but I don’t think anyone does fruit beers better than our friends from Wisconsin."
"O: not a bad effort from one of the best breweries around. I will caution you however too let it age a bit before drinking. The scent and flavor really represent themsleves in much truer fashion."
"Yet another amazing fruit beer by New Glarus. They make some of the best fruit beer out there between this, the Cranbic Ale, the Raspberry Tart, and the Wisconsin Belgian Red."
"Thanks to TATURBO for this one! This beer poured out as a lightly hazy golden color with a thin white head that doesn't do much but form a ring around the glass. Not much lacing here. The smell of the beer had a pretty good aroma of apple to it. It starts to smell better as it warms up. The taste is like a blend of cider and apple juice with a good amount of spices in there too. The mouthfeel was almost medium bodied and had a good carbonation to it. Overall I can't say that it was my favorite Apple flavored beer, as much as I love these beers, I think it was a little too tart at times. I would drink this again for sure."
"New Glarus just plain rock all the time, and I'm about ready to declare that an irrefutable fact."
"I employed a very gentle pour, resulting in mere wisps in terms of head. Color was a slightly hazy light-brown with amber highlights. It did, indeed, resemble freshly squeezed apple juice. Nose was very much driven by the apple juice employed in its production. Mouthfeel was on the thin side and the taste was of lightly spiced apple juice. If I had the proper equipment, I might consider heating this in a double boiler as a sort of mulled cider-type of drink. Finish was a pleasant admixture of apple and spice, the latter most likely cinnamon. Very tasty cold and would be welcomed as a hot drink also."
"O: I'm not overly impressed with this offering from New Glarus, but I'm glad to have tried it."
"o - overall, new glarus continues to impress. their takes on vedgie beers are pretty awesome and they do it second to none. for a fan of apples, vedgie beers, and things different, this is another must try."
"Pours a crisp reddish brown. A touch of white head. The pour is not impressive. Smells heavily of apple but in a very bland boring way. The taste is considerably better. Lots of apple and a touch of light malts. The apple flavour is top notch. Solid well carbonated mouthfeel. Overall very tasty but more like a cider than anything else!"
"I'm pleased that it's not full of ""apple pie spices", cinnamon, whatever. Just clean, juicy apple. Bravo."
"Poured into my bruery tulip, copper in color with no head. Aroma of apple cider, almost an apple pie aroma. Taste follows the nose, sweet, tart apples with some malts in the back. Smooth and hides alcohol well. Tasty and different, a great change of pace, very good, if not great!"
"O- really loved this beer, wish I had cases for the hot SD summer."
"O - It's good, and it's really great for what it is. Doesn't taste like a beer, but the ladies will love it, and I don't mind."
"O- This beer delivered on what it said it was going to be. Actually I found this beer to be better than most ciders who wish to taste somewhere close to this style. The apples in this just blew my tastebuds out of the water. Very fine job New Glarus...I really enjoyed this beer!"
"SkÅL!"
"O - Slightly all over the board, but still solid and a great brew to a great trade! Super brew. Very glad I got to try this one."
"Overall, outstanding. It's really impressive that they could get this kind of flavor from apple juice since apples don't have a very strong flavor compared to most fruits. The vanilla flavor I noticed reminds me of some barrel aged beers I've had. Another New Glarus fruit beer that you could just sit and sip all day."
"Overall, I think that this is pretty much liquid apple pie. I have never tried one of those ""apple pie liquor"" shots that seems to be trendy these days, but I suspect that they may taste much the same as this brew. But that would be a job for another website. It is worth emphasizing that this is NOT a sour, so don't go in to this brew expecting lacto. Expect delicious apple pie instead."
"Pours a crystal clear apple juice color (obviously) with a very small 1/2 off-white head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace stick around the glass on the drink down. Smells deliciously of fresh apples, apple sauce, and apple juice. Apples are the only smell from this beer and to be honest it doesn't even smell the slightest bit alcoholic. Taste is of all of the apple products in the smell along with some spice flavors that remind me of apple pie. Carbonation level is fairly high which makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a delicious fruit beer that is up there with the Raspberry Tart and Wisconsin Belgian Red. Liquid apple pie in a low ABV, easy drinking, very tasty brew!"
"650"
"O.) - If you really want your beer to taste like beer, this might not be one for you. Sweet and easy, it one goes down like juice or cider. Would be a great session beer for fall or summer--I'd want this by my lawn chair or my campfire. As it is, I'm not sure anyone is doing fruit beer as well as New Glarus. Another winner, but I would love to try it if it had a little more kick. Up the apple tartness and the carbonation."
"O - This is quite a delicious fruit beer, though I must says that of all of the beers I have ever had, this is probably the most un-beery."
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with a white fizzy head. Faint white ring forms as the beer settles. Aroma is straight apple pie filing and caramel apples. Very sweet and fruity beer. Again with the apple pie and caramel dipped apple. Doesn't really remind me of a cider as it lacks the acidic/tart character. Almost no hops at all. Moderate to low carbonation with a silky mouthfeel. Sweet and sticky finish."
"O: This is an excellent take on a fruit beer. I am eternally grateful to beerwolf77 for the extra as New Glarus is not sold near me. Which is too bad because this is a beer I would love to have a lot of. I had to try really hard not to drink it really fast."
"Up for review is a 120z bottle of New Glarus Appel Ale. Poured into a pint glass at room temperature. Tan color with a beige head. Has lots of fresh apples over a nicely balanced brown ale. Nice cider flavors as well. Clean, crisp body. Another great fruit beer from Danny."
"Arrived just in time for a small little get together from burnheartsMKE, thanks man!! This has to be one of the best tasting fruit beers I've had in a long time. Took me right back to childhood memories of smelling apple pie at grandma's house for Thanksgiving. I will search this out again for sure."
"9.5/10"
"Overall, this is a great apple beer! NG always does a great job of showcasing the fruit in their beers and this is no exception. I'd love to have a six pack of this in the fall. Better than the majority of ciders out there. Worth seeking out."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty cool beer, they really got the apple flavor to come out pretty nicely. It was a little on the sweet side, but was still pretty drinkable. Interesting beer, as well as a pretty good one too."
"Overall, pleasure to sample and for what it is it is very good. New Glarus hands down makes the best fruit beers in the US, they really have it down. At 4% ABV and reminding me too much of apple juice, not really my cup of tea., but not a bad brew."
"O - Man, this is disappointing. I really wanted to enjoy this, but the diacetyl makes it impossible. As much as I don't want to, this is going down the drain. I'm guessing I just got a bad bottle or batch, so I'll have to acquire another and revisit this review. But for now this is it, dammit."
"overall - the best apple beer i have had and could throw back a few of these in a session if it was sold in my area"
"The CPJ"
"D- This is a good beer overall. Pretty much what it advertises to be-apple. Because its made with six separate apple varieties nothing in particular stands out."
"Poured a transparent copper/amber color with a little bit of white head on it. Smell is nice and fruity. The apples really come through. Taste is the same, heavy on the apples with a little bit of malt. Light mouthfeel, this is a smooth, easy drinking beer. Overall another great fruit beer from NG. This is a really good beer."
"Drinkability is good but this comes off less then a beer and more of a cider. I could drink a couple more but won't seek it out."
"D - It's a bit sweet for me to be too drinkable. Would make a fine drink to get someone started into the craft world."
"Poureed a clear golden color with aromas of light malt, crisp apples and apple juice. Light bodied and crisp, light malt and apple juice."
"O: Goes down fast, its very tasty and refreshing. I couldn't have a lot but definitely good stuff here. A great fruit beer."
"Overall an interesting beer. Pretty tasty. I might have to get more of this to keep around to show people what a beer can be."
"Thanks Bry."
"Drinkability: Another enjoyable beer from New Glarus. I was surprised with how much apple flavor came out in this. The name of this beer doesn't disappoint; it's exactly what it's called."
"I must admit I like it. Very apple-y and with a nice mid body and palate. Sweet through the finish with apple rind like mouthfeel and flavor in the middle. Again caramel and cinnamon add to the flavor profile. Great balance and way to drinkable."
"This beer pours a clear dark amber color, with very small head. The smell is very sweet, and full of apples. The taste was also sweet, and full of apple flavors. A nice amount of carbonation, and a nice flavor, not much like a beer however. Overall if you like apples, this is very enjoyable, like a less sweet hard cider."
"Kind of like a light pumpkin ale, made with apples instead."
"The beer pours a beautiful golden apple juice color with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly to a thin layer that sticks around for quite some time. The smell is of freshly squeezed apple juice with a little bit of a cinnamon raisin bread smell in the back. It definitely could pass as a piece of toast with apple jam spread on it. Very nice. Taste is a pure shot of fresh apple upfront with a very nice sweetness that turns tart as it lingers, followed by a hint of spice...maybe nutmeg. After that, the taste lingers with a bready finish not unlike pie crust. The mouth is slightly prickly with carbonation, but balanced by a smooth slickness. The finish is dry and pleasant. Overall, I can suck this down very quickly and at the low alcohol I could definitely have a few. Very nice beer. Disclaimer: I love apples."
"My first beer from New Glarus, very good stuff."
"Good crisp body that is sharp and clean. Fresh apples all over the flavor. Mild sour notes, but this is much sweeter than expected. Honey-kissed bread noted as well. Slight dry note on the finish, but it is fleeting. This may very well be the most drinkable fruit beer I have ever had. I think I like this better than their RT or BR. I loved this. Thanks again, Andy."
"D - Light, crisp, refreshing. Seems perfect for a warm late summer/fall day...like the last one of the year before the cold sets in for good. Almost dessert like in a way too. Goes down like water...at only 4% it is extremely sessionable. Not sure how to really put this into a style for comparison to other ""peer level"" beers - haven't really had anything quite like it that the brewer is calling a beer. That being said, it is an excellent low alcohol, easy drinking, gateway potential, fruity beer."
"D: im loving it for this one glass, but its not something i could repeat again real soon. as a first beer of the night, or just a treat here or there, this is a sure hit, because the flavor just rocks."
"D - Easy drinking. I cold put away a ton of these. That being said I enjoy some of their cherry flavored concoctions more."
"Wow! This is a great fruit beer. When poured a beautiful amber/butterscotch color appears. A little fizzy head appears, but dissipates quickly. Apple tart comes in the nose with a sweet sugary smell to accompany it. Also a cider scent is pretty prevalent. Taste is similar to a candied apple, but not overpowering at all which is pleasant. You don't get sick of the sweetness, at least after one bottle. Malts work well to counter act the sweetness and to keep you wanting more. Mouth feel is light to medium with good carbonation. Very drinkable. It is a fruit beer so easy to get down. But for someone who usually doesn't like fruit beers, this is very well done."
"D-a little sweet and thins out in the back on the flavor but not the body. singular but knows what it is. Talk about an awesome halloween beer. this would be great for a halloween party!"
"I had about 3 ounces of this beer and it was probably all I needed. This beer has the potential for syrupy sweetness and while doesn't get there I still could only drink so much"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew was light colored (like apple cider) with a white bubbly head that dissipated quickly similar to soda carbonation. The aroma was definitely apple with hints of clove and some slight malt. The taste was exactly what one would expect, sparkling apple cider. It has mild spice of cinnamon and some clove but not much else. I am not one for a spiced brew but this was OK for what you would expect. I think a little sour and more alcohol content would do wonders for this brew, but obviously that was not the intent here. Good for style but not my taste."
"Mouthfeel is great; it has a good level of carbonation. Crisp, clean, and delicious. Exactly what you think it would be and exactly what you would want it to be. Overall I really enjoyed this beer; it's certainly a change of pace with its lighter body and sweet caramel/honey flavors. I would certainly drink this beer again, preferably in the middle of Autumn."
"D- really can only drink 1 is fairly sweet and taste to much like apple cider..good to try but not one i will seek out soon"
"Wow, I'm impressed. Good job New Glarus."
"Overall- Straightforward taste, exactly what you would expect. Drinks very easy, you could have multiples with no problem. If you like ciders, highly recomended."
"M/D - light to slightly medium bodied with a nice zippy carbonation. The drinkability is high but might be enough for me after a few. Sort of want to get back to something a bit hoppy."
"D= Off the charts drinkable and so refreshing. I wish this was available to me by the case in the heat of June-August. So tasty and worth every good word that has been printed about it."
"This comes pretty highly recommended from VDubb (which is saying something for a fruit beer), so I'm lookin' forward to this libation. It pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of loose white foam. The nose is a swift reminder of cold, yet fragrant, apple pie, crust and all. So, apples, cinnamon, pie crust (you know the scent), a touch of nutmeg...yeah, the basic apple pie deal. A touch of light wheat sits in the background, an old dunce's cap firmly thereatop. The taste ditches the pie to focus on the filling. Straight up, apple pie filling all the way here, with heavy emphasis on red apples in particular. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet finish. Overall, a very nice fruit beer that delivers exactly what it promises. Not much more than that, though."
"High on the drinkability if you like apples. I'm tempted to chug these."
"Drinkability - New Glarus is without peer when it comes to authentic fruit flavored beers. This is a nice addition, but not in the same league as Cranbic or the Belgian Red."
"I think the moment I realized beer was really amazing was when I tried the New Glarus Raspberry Tart, so this brewery has a special place in my heart even though, living in New York, I very rarely have the chance to enjoy their offerings. But my boyfriend got his hands on a couple, and since he knows I like this sort of thing, he offered one to me. It pours a very clear copper shade, with a small head that dissipates quickly; a great deal of carbonation is visible at first, but soon disappears. The nose is rather light, with just a hint of that slight apple-and-vinegar scent one finds in some ciders. The taste, too, recalls apple cider, and as far as I'm concerned, this beer is absolutely delicious. The dominant flavor is sharp, flavorful apples; the light carbonation really allows that flavor to stand out. I have a feeling I'll be trying to steal the second one of these from my boyfriend's closet ..."
"Search this one out if you would like a fruit beer that lacks cloying sweetness - the dooming factor of most fruit beers to me."
"D: I'm really enjoying this beer as it's certainly a change of pace with its lighter body and sweet sugary flavor. I would certainly drink this beer again."
"D: If you like apple cider, you'll love this beer. I like apple cider and I like this beer. I could drink this all day on a hot summer day."
"Thanks Jason as always for throwing some my way. Always a welcome treat for sure."
"The body is nice a thick, not heavy though, much like syrup. There is a little carbonation that lightens the sip at the end, preparing the pallette for the next sip. The refreshing quality of this beer, low alcohol content and great flavor make this one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, I wish it were a regular offering so I could make it my dedicated session beer. Terrific."
"Pours looking like apple cider, the smell is all sweetness and apples too, yum. The flavor is where I was blown away in the second tasting. The BR is all tart cherries, the Apple Ale has a lot of apple flavor and a crispness in it but there is this butterscotch flavor that dominates at the end that is like nothing I've ever had. I didn't recognize it the first time I had it but it was the most obvious thing the second time around and made for a wonderfully complex flavor. The mouthfeel goes right along with the flavor, buttery. As for drinkability it's crisp, yet that butterscotch flavor was wonderful. I want more, great drinkability. I loved this beer, best thing NG makes in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Easily drinkable as it's akin to apple juice and it's very refreshing. Low in alcohol makes this one very easy to drink. Very good take on a fruit beer and one I would happily drink again. Kudos to New Glarus, you just made a fan. This would be great with a salad."
"This pours a frothy apple juice color (this shouldn't start a trend, but might) white head fades to nothingness. The smell is mostly of, surprise, apples. There is a floral apple blossom note to it and I must admit it's not too bad. Though it is sugary sweet smelling. The taste is mainly of spiced apple cider, there is an allspice and cinnamon note that you would find in cider. I really must admit it's rather tasty, but I really don't consider it to be much of a beer. This has a nice nip to it with the carbonation and the drinkability of this is good, but this beer's sweetness can get to you over the duration of a glass. Not a bad fruit beer."
"d- I could drink this all night. The beer to me other than the appearance is perfect. I am a big fan of this beer and would reccomend it to anyone of you bas out there."
"The session beer craze is going to hit the craft scene hard here in America at some point. The magical things done with fruit by Dan Carey is already big in Wisconsin and could possibly be lessons learned for brewers who want to be part of the forth coming craze. I want so bad to see more beers like this done by other brewers but for now, New Glarus is king and second place isn't even close."
"4.5 D: This drinks as easy as apple cider or champagne as well. I could drink plenty of this in a night, but would eventually like to mix in something more typical."
"Overall: We in the Midwest, especially Wisconsin, are spoiled by New Glarus' Unplugged brews. Apple Ale is like carbonated apple juice with alcohol. Though that description does it no justice, it's fairly accurate. It's good, not great. I love the apple scent and taste, both are extremely unique and tasty. But it doesn't taste much like beer. Also, it's a bit too sweet for more than one. Certainly one I'd recommend, but I probably won't buy another 4-pack."
"It is what I expected it to be, definitely delivers on the name. Found it pretty good, but wouldn't really want more than one of these..."
"It's drinkable though. Tart, sweet, light and crisp - this is an interesting brew for sure. Its only problem is that it introduces something not often done, and the combination seems to slightly overshoot the sweetness."
"Overall: Very sweet, probably couldn't drink more than 1 or two of them in a sitting due to sweetness."
"Nice apple beer. Very well made."
"D: About as easy to drink as a glass of apple juice, which, for me at least, means I couldn't drink more than one of these at a time. An interesting beer that might be appropriate for dessert or as a snack, with almost no resemblance to the typical beer."
"Am going to have to pick a four-pack of this up before it disappears."
"Drinkability - I could drink these all day, no joke. No cloying sweetness at the end as one would expect. I'm glad I got two four packs of these."
"appearance is more of a clear gold then brown. smells like apples and sugary water syrup. way closer to a cider than a brown ale but it has much more drinkability than a cider. low carbonation and sticky sweet. this was cool but i wish i had more than a third of a 12 oz bottle!"
"Seek this out, newbies may really enjoy this."
"D - I wish I had more. My girlfriend really liked this, and remarked that she loved the apple flavor and appreciated the lack of aftertaste. I know that this isn't all that fair of a comparison, but when I drink Belgian Red or Raspberry Tart, I only ever want a small pour, but with Apple Ale, I want to take my girlfriend's pour back. Also, my burps now smell DELICIOUS."
"Medium to light in body with a modest level of carbonation. Quite easy drinking, if you enjoy apples or hard cider this is certainly a brew to give a try. First impressions of this brew are pretty hard to swallow. This brew was quite tasty in a back-sweetened cider sort of way."
"If you love any of the other New Glarus fruit beers, gets your hands on this one as well!"
"I really enjoy this beer, and really wish this was distributed outside Wisconsin as this would make a wonderful autumn beer. Incredibly drinkable."
"Flavor brings quite a bit of spools and some sweetness plus some nutmeg and other spices. A bit too sweet. Feel is prickly with a lot of carbonation. Overall, quite a unique beer but I really am enjoying this."
"Light bodied, bubbly and refreshing. Drinks so well, and the alcohol is nonexistent. For a straight up fruit beer, this pretty much nails the apple flavor, although if you don't like cider, I can see this missing."
"This beer rocked. Complex and delicious."
"D - very drinkable especially if you like apples, as I do."
"D - At 4%, very drinkable, but a little too sweet to drink more than one bottle at a time."
"D- Just about sickeningly sweet. It leaves that cider twang in the back of the throat that I can't deal with."
"A much talked about New Glarus beer. It pours a golden amber color as you take in the scent of apple cider. Upon tasting there is a strong apple tartness to it. It takes a few sips to get used to teh tartness but after that it drinks rather smooth since there is not much carbonation to it. One of the more interesting beers you will find."
"D - The only two fruit beers Ive had have been this one and the Wisconsin Belgian Red and both took me by surprise. Both very good beers, New Glarus certainly does fruit beers well. The light and not so overpowering sweetness combined with the low abv and light body make this one highly drinkable."
"Taste is all apple, very sweet, a little too sweet. The apple is way over the top. Again, it's not bad but it's like fermented apple juice."
"Medium bodied and sweet, with low carbonation. Another truly great fruit beer from New Glarus. I could easily drink this beer again and again."
"D: As with the other New Glarus fruit beers I've had this is incredible. The top 4 fruit beers of my life, they're all New Glarus, can't say more than that."
"Beer is thin to medium bodied and apply. Its sweet and cidery with mild spice and some grain acidity at the end. It's not super enjoyable as I hoped. I doubt I would drink more than the 12 ounces I had."
"A tad sweet, but I could easily drink several of these."
"Opened the bottle and it had a slight fizz sound. Poured into the glass and it foamed very briefly. Nice gold/brownish color, very clear no haze what so ever. The smell of apples and spices was very pleasant. I thought it would taste like a cider, but it surprised me and didn't. More like a apple infused pale ale. Not much hop flavor, primarily apple. But very clean and crisp, no heavy after taste. Would be a great beer for lounging out by the pool during the Florida summers."
"Drinkability: New Glarus nailing a fruit beer....who would have thought that! Another fruit beer that I've had from them that is insanely good. Very nice beer at a low abv makes this a very drinkable beer."
"Edit: As I get further into the bottle it becomes harder to drink due to the sweetness."
"Pours a solid copper orange color with no head and no lacing, even despite a hard pour. Bottle says it's a brown ale base, but there's nothing brown about the look. Nose is mostly apples and light spices. Not getting much of a base beer aroma, but it smells excellent. Taste is very reminiscent of apple cider, which is to be expected I suppose, but I'm just getting anything in the way of beer. This thing is very sweet, but not cloyingly so, and is basically all apples and spice. I'm honestly having a hard time picking out which spices in particular were used (cinnamon?), if any at all, but it's all very well balanced, with no bitterness from hops. Body is medium, carbonation is perfect. All in all, this one tasty brew, but it doesn't really taste like beer. It does, however, taste better than any hard cider I've ever choked down. An interesting ale, and very nice for the holidays."
"Easy drinking yet flavorful."
"D - this a delicious fall treat. This is the first apple ale I have had (although I have had many hard ciders) and was pleasantly surprised. Due to the sweetness, 2 would be my max, but it was very enjoyable throughout."
"D: Could drink this all day. Perfect in fall, will be perfect in winter, and I could see cracking this on a hot summer day as well."
"This is one of those beers when you hate to see the bottom of the glass. Ironically, its so easy to drink that it happens very quickly. Its simplicity and variance makes it alluring, yet highly drinkable and enjoyable."
"(D)- Move over hard ciders! This has a great feel to it with a great crisp apple profile. I could drink this all day long if I wanted. Yet another winner for the style for New Glarus."
"[Note as of 02-10-11 - If you can still find this (it's at most places) get it. The beer is changing nicely and drinks just as well, if not better than fresh!)"
"No alcohol to the taste. Drinks a lot like a sweet cider, but there's a complexity there that you'd normally only find in a good dry cider."
"Bottle. Poured into a NB tulip type glass. Pours a clear copper color win a slight bone white head hat quickly coasters around the rim. The aroma is that of straight sweet apples and really nothing more. Clean, crisp apple flavor takes center stage on this one. Light mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Really there isn't too mug to say other than this is an excellent easy drinking sweet, apple flavored beer."
"A nice beer, but I feel the apples are overshadowed in it. You can taste it, but the malty sweetness overtakes it. That same sweetness takes the drinkability down for me as well. I think one of these would be about all I would want in one sitting."
"Pours a nice chrystal-clear amber copper color. The head is thin but it sticks around for the duration. Nice thick sticky lacing. Great fresh apple smell. Thats the only smell at first, but I pick up some more subtle bready, hoppy beer scents as I smell more closely. It's a fantastic smell. I was expecting it to have the fall baking spices added like pumpkin beers. I'm very glad it wasn't. The taste is much like the smell. Very crisp, juicy fresh sweet and sour apple flavors, with just a hint of bread and hops to make you realize this is a beer. That's kind of my problem. I love beer, and I love apples, but does it make either better to put them together? I really like Woodchuck hard cider as a change of pace. This tasted a lot like that except it had a bready, malty base that didn't fit with the apple flavor. That really kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it? I did like the flavor. It's one of the more enjoyable fruit flavored beers I've had. Someone used to cider or wine who is crossing over to beer would be a good audiance for this. Overall, it's a unique and pleasant tasting beer."
"I love NG and I love this beer. It's got apple but it's not over the top. Its not sour apple but its not overly sweet."
"A straightforward, nicely done apple beer. I'll buy this whenever I can - tasty stuff."
"D: New Glarus really knows how to preserve the delicate flavors of fruit and translate them to beer. This one nearly taste like a sparkling cider, I almost forgot this was beer."
"If you are lucky enough to find this, don't hesitate to pick it up. If you don't like it (doubtful!) you wont have to go far to find someone who will."
"This is the epitome of drinkability. So fresh, so accessible and low in alcohol, and so pleasant to drink on a rainy fall afternoon. Thank you, New Glarus."
"I wish this beer was released a few months ago....a perfect fall beer! New Glarus Apple Ale pours a golden cider. VERY pleasant sweet tart apple taste mixed with cinnamon, mild malt, and the hint of alcohol is nice. I could easy crush a 4-pack of this on a crisp fall day."
"D: One of if not the most drinkable beers I've had to date. I will be stocking up on this one. No more need to bust out hard ciders for all my non beer loving friends. This one will do just fine."
"D- With it's low ABV and great balance of flavors, this one is high. Hell, it took me two bottles to write this review because the first one went so quickly. This one is going to go well with a Thanksgiving meal."
"Pours a brilliant copper color with a thick white head and generous lacing. You can smell the beer from the second you pop the cap. Smells of fresh baked apple, cinnamon, and sweet malts. Taste is actually not overwhelmingly sweet. Good sourness notes with cinnamon and a little nutmeg with tons of tasty apples in every sip. Mouthfeel is medium with good body and tons of carbonation. Drinkability is fantastic."
"D: Sort of like a more complex sparkling cider (non-alcoholic), plenty of sweetness and apple flavor. I'd like to try this one fresher, but still good as it is."
"Such an amazing beer, a complete contrast to where the more hyped beers are going, yet still extreme in its own way. Easily a stepping stone beer and without a doubt a non-beer drinker's conversion key."
"semi-refreshing, although a bit sweet. it's ok - interesting, but just not as bold, bright, fresh, and complex as some of their better fruit beers."
"D: Like an apple cider... but better in every way. Great taste and crispness. Extremely light, smooth, and drinkable. This is the epitome of a summer beer and a shining example of what New Glarus does best and what all fruit beers should strive towards... amazing. Seek it out!"
"What a unique beer! i was expecting a green apple tart brew, but i took a sip and it was golden delicious all the way. This tastes like a strongly carbinated cider, with some cinnamon and spices thrown in. It's really amazing how apparent the juicy red apple is. Even the mouthfeel has the same viscosity as apple juice. The drinkability of this is funny in that it is related to the season,lol. During three seasons it would be easy to drink a few bottles, but during fall it would be easy to drink a 6-pack! sigh....it is a shame this is retired."
"Drinkability: While this is a very interesting creation, in the end, it winds up being just a bit too sweet for me; I would have prefered a bit more tart apple in the flavor profile"
"D - Amazingly refreshing, goes down super easy and tastes amazing, New Glarus needs to do 2 things, make this beer again and distribute it to Michigan (my house specifically)."
"Drinkability: VERY drinkable--though also filling. Would love to have this over and over again."
"D: I love apple juice and I love beer. Therefore, it stands to reason that I love this drink to a geometrically greater degree. I don't see myself drinking this all day long but as a one-off treat it really hits the spot."
"Drinkability is astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this used the exact same base recipe as Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart. Delicious beer. I'm disappointed that the low appearance score hurts this as much as it does, so I'm artificially bumping appearance - this is easily an A beer."
"I've had this a few times now and have enjoyed ever sip. I'm kind of upset that I discovered this beer after it's very hard to obtain. This is one of those beers I'd love to let non-beer people try. New Glarus are easily the kings of producing fruited beers here in the US. I'd love to see them revisit this as a seasonal offering."
"Overall, I am not really a fan of fruit/vegetable beers, but so far Dan has hooked me up with two of the best I have had...this beer and the Raspberry Tart. I had to carefully watch my glass as my wife tried to steal a sip here and there. There's a fine line between a cider and a beer and New Glarus managed to find a spot right up against it. Well done."
"Conclusion: This is one fantastic fruit beer...in no way is this fake, sugary, or artificial...it's got emphasis on the fruit over the malt for sure, but it's more complex than a cider...feel lucky to have gotten to try this one...paired wonderfully with baked brie with raspberry honey and almonds"
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth with good carbonation....again along the lines of a carbonated apple cider. Overall, a darn tasty apple ale that is straightforward and hits the spot when you need something different. I hope they brew this one again."
"I really enjoyed this beer -- my experience with fruit beers is that they tend to be either very thin or taste like the fruit has been ""added"" in some way. This was right up front & defined by the apples without losing the body & malt that makes a great beer. One of the best fruit beers I've had."
"I love how they used the hops and spice to counteract and compliment both the tartness and sweeter components of these fruit beers, and this is just another great example of that. They really need to make this a fall seasonal during apple season. Very nice!"
"The drinkability is quite good as the beer doesn't have an overwhelming apple sweetness, but is more geared toward the apple tartness."
"drinkability is good. for a fruit beer, there is not much 'beer' in the profile, but the flavors present come together into a very pleasant composition, though it still could use a bit more yeast or malt character. cheers!"
"I bought a bunch of these for my wife and I had a few too;) I was pleasantly surprised by how good this smelled. It was closer to apple juice than an apple beer. The taste was something like a 50/50 mix of cider and juice. Couldn't detect any hops or alcohol at all. I wish I knew the ABV on this one. I have a few of these left and my wife had one last week and said it's held up very well. Hope they hang around till this fall to have a few more."
"Haha. This is something that can easily be served at the peak of autumn and would be a great hit! Purchased while visiting a friend in Duluth, MN. Poured into two open mouth red wine glasses. Pours a beautiful sunset gold. Smell is overwhelmed by the essence of fresh cut macintosh. Just a slight malty hint. No sign of hops. Taste is simply stated as very good cider. Can notice almost nothing of a bitterness and as in the smell only a hint of very light malts. Mouthfeel is great, very smooth. This in my opinion which gives this beer its own. A medium body, silky almost which lingers for a good minute after drinking. Far too easy of a ""beer"" to drink. Overall though a very nice drink. I very much enjoyed it."
"12 ounce bottle received in a trade with mikesgroove, think a four pack of these run about ten dollars, poured into my Duvel tulip glass on Tuesday, reviewed from notes, color is a light golden yellow, actually a bit cloudy, 3/4 inch bubbly head that did not last long, small amount of lacing and retention, green apples but not quite granny smith because they did not smell too sour, mild citrus, sugar, and white wine, starts off with a variety of apples, flavors from both red and green ones come through, sweet with sugared candy in the middle, finishes with more apples, not much else going on flavor wise, would have been even better is some tartiness showed up, still not a bad fruit beer, sweet, sugary, and light mouthfeel, thin to medium bodied, high level of carbonation, taste did not last long and what did was a little sweetness, more along the lines of Lindemands in this case, could have drank a whole lot of this stuff, alcohol is not even there and supposedly this stuff is below four percent, went down very easy, quite sweet without overdoing it, inviting and light, not the best of the Unplugged series but still a good beer overall, would drink again, worth trying"
"A nice offering from New Glarus whose best offerings incorporate fruit in the brewing process such as this one."
"RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting. Pours golden orange with a frothy white head. Big bruised apple aroma with sweet dough. Smells like fresh apple pie. Huge ice cider apple barrage, really robust fresh pressed apples. Almost tastes more like apples than apples do. Pretty delicious."
"Pours a clear gold with some caramel hues into a pint glass. 1 pinky of white head fades quickly and leaves only the slightest bit of lacing spots. Smells primarily of green apples, but also a bit of brown sugar and some malt. Tastes of tart green apples, cinnamon, brown sugar, lightly toasted malts, and a touch of citrus. Medium in body with nice fizzy carbonation. Tart and fruity with a bit of a sour pucker. Quite easy drinking, almost cider-like with the amount of apple presence, but the sugars and pie crust-like malts help remind you that it is beer. Delicious stuff."
"Bottle at PPRBSG09. I had been hoping to try this beer for a long time, and it didn't disappoint! Pours a clear light orange with a small head. Aroma of sour apple, cheese, and apple vinegar. Flavor of fresh apples, sweet apple cider, apple vinegar, and some sour apple notes. Very nice!"
"This beer is something a good bit different than what I've had before. It strikes me as a mix between a fruit beer and a spiced beer. Although I typically don't like either of those styles, here the mix certainly works."
"D--Not really something that interests me overall, it tasted O.K. but I don't want any more."
"I could drink a dozen of these. The alcohol is nowhere to be found... apple concentrate beer equals an incredible, unique drinking experience."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. great apple blend. nice beer-apple mix. good stuff!"
"Pours a crystal clear light amber, some orange highlighting, thick white head forms, drops to a thin ring around the glass and a thin layer, some nice chunks of lace stick to the glass. Smell is real neat, like apple juice, caramel, lightly sugary, toasty/biscuity, treacle, pears, cider, very malty, quite sweet, but really interesting maltiness, and real nice apple aroma, definitely unique. Taste is similar, lots of apple juice character, very fresh, lightly tart, great maltiness, caramel and honey, toast and biscuit, very rich and full, very fresh and juicy, this stuff is great! Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth, real nice tartness. Insanely drinkable, I could drink a lot of this stuff!"
"Mouthfeel: Very crisp dry in the finish. Would be really nice on a cool day."
"D- Like juice"
"New Glarus Unplugged Apple Ale pours a thin head over a clear amber brew. Carbonation is steady, the nose ripe, slightly funky apple. Flavor is more apple with notes of funky English Ale yeast a little tart but also sweet. Mouthfeel starts a little crisp, trending a little syrupy with more apple in the aftertaste. Except for a touch of yeast funk, this is pretty indistinguishable from a sweet hard cider. Not bad for what it is- a nice dessert beer, or alternatively, a component in a cocktail. Nevertheless, a little disappointing since New Glarus's Unplugged series has been pretty spectacular in my opinion."
"Pours a clear, golden/amber color and a lighter golden along the edges. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells strongly of apples and only very slightly of cider. Fits the style a Fruit/Vegetable beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes strongly of apples, not so much a cider flavor, but actual apples. This is a first for me, and I quite enjoy the fact that a good apple flavored beer is out there. Can't pick out very many other flavors besides the apple, though."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack chalice. This beer pours a golden caramel copper with just a slight off white head that receded into just a thin line around the inside of the glass. As the beer disappears from my glass, no lacing is present. As somewhat of a cider aficionado, I definitely expected a slight haze from the apples but to my surprise it poured completely crystal clear. The aroma is fresh off the tree golden golden delicious apples coated in sweet caramel eaten off a stick at the fairgrounds. The flavor is exactly the same. It completely reminds me of a fresh artisanal caramel apple. It's completely amazing how they bottled that flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and just finishes a little to sweet. New Glarus, in my opinion makes the best fruit beers. There is nothing better then a fruit beer from New Glarus. Amazing."
"Mouthfeel is thick and sugary. Only a mild carbonation. I know it's supposed to be beer, but all of my senses say it's a cider"
"Apple Ale's a hell of a nice surprise. I tend to be hard on fruit/vegetable beer, but this is a rare exception that's a good, solid beer. Yeah, it's not exactly deep or complicated and it doesn't have a wealth of beer-like qualities. But, Apple Ale is a very nice change of pace beer that has a hell of a unique, enjoyable flavor. Take it for what it is and enjoy it. Oh, and if you like apples, you simply must find a few bottles."
"This is a fantastic brew, all the better for being an unexpected star in a constellation of mediocre or downright sugary annoying messes of fruit beers. I'd suggest this to anyone who likes beer, fruit, or water."
" ~ One and I'm probably done. That's usually all I can do when it comes to the fruit line."
"Regardless, for a fruit beer, top notch. I would love to have easy access to this for hot summer mornings :-)"
"HV"
"a good beer for beer drinker beginners ."
"It pours amber, genuine amber, with a fast-dissolving head, leaving some nice lacing. To smell? Yep. Apple cider. Exactly. There's a hint of wine-iness there too. To taste? Yep. Apple cider through and through, with a good deal of sweet red pears. I can't imagine that this beer has too high of an alcohol content, and unfortunately, I can't seem to find any info on this. Clearly, NG was going for apples, and they nailed it. I kinda wish it had something else to it, though....But I do give them credit for the bullseye on the apple motif. A good amount of carbonation, though not in a palate-shredding way. Drinkability? HIGH. This is DEADLY in drinkability, due to its exact likeness of a sparkling apple cider."
"D- This beer has a big apple flavor without being sugary candy or chemical tasting. The apple flavors have some nice bright fresh fruit flavors and a soft bit of support from the malt. This beer is easy to drink and the best example of apple beer I have tried."
"D - Wow, what a refreshing brew. The flavor and aroma of fresh apples is unmistakable. With a background toasty malt character, I'm reminded that this is indeed a beer. Aside from the beer being a bit sweet-tasting, drinkability is spectacular. No trouble finishing up this entire bottle. Delicious."
"Drinkability: This beer is drinkable! I could see myself drinking a ton of this in one sitting. This would be quite refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Thanks to Taturbo for this one!"
"Nicely drinkable. Glad I tried it, but not sure it would be something I would seek. I'd like to try it with a pork dinner."
"Pours clear copper colour with one finger white head. Smell - sour apples. Taste - well it is more apple juice than a beer, strong honey flavour as well. This a great beverage - very crisp, refreshing, very tasty, it is just not a beer. I will rate it pretty high because I really liked it, i took me 30 seconds to finish a glass, but just so you know, there is nothing really related to beer here. I guess I'll need another one to figure this one out."
"d: Thanks to imperialking for this one. Not bad, just not for me."
"D - This brew has a very high sessionability factor! Not sure what the ABV is here, but is has to be below 5%. I'm gonna be going out and picking a bunch of this up while it's still on the shelves to ensure I have plenty available for the Summer! If you like this beer style, this is a must try! Great job New Glarus!"
"D - I don't know how this can taste like such fresh apple juice/cider unless it was back sweetened after fermentation. Either way, very tasty if you like apple juice/cider."
"I believe I got a few bottles of this from hogwildliquor, so thanks! Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. Appears a crystal clear golden yellow color with barely a finger of eggshell colored foam. The foam dissipates within minutes of the pour settling into a thin layer. Smells of tart apple cider initially and then upon giving the glass a swirl, notes of golden delicious apples come out. The flavor is obviously dominated by apples. Fresh pressed apple cider, apple skins, sweet and tart apples, candied apples, and I swear I smell a touch of cinnamon. Is my brain tricking me into smelling cinnamon? Who knows. This skates a fine line between beer and cider. Very well done. Medium bodied with a light, crisp carbonation, again very cider-like. Check this one out if you have the chance."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a slight chewiness. Very easy drinking. No real resemblence to a brown ale (which the bottle claims to be the base). An excellent fruit beer and another great and very intriguing beer from New Glarus."
"Pours out a light transparent copper with a light head that's gone pretty quickly. Smells of tart green apples, slight spices, and more apples. Taste is a very refreshing apple flavor with a slight tartness to it that balances very well. Slight maltiness in there makes it not taste completely like a cider. Very nicely done, not as good as the Raspberry I don't think, but still very spot on and delicious. Wish they would make this one year round too."
"D: Uncommonly drinkable. If you liked apple juice as a kid, this ale's for you. Grab a 4-Pack while they last."
"D: This is an amazingly balanced fruit beer. I wasn't sure what to expect, but after reading a couple of reviews of this I decided to try it and managed to pick up the last 4 pack of this at the Brat Stop. What an awesome score!"
"Clear, light coppery amber with a white collar and skim of fine bubbles. Some lacing, good retention. Definitely some apples in the aroma, lower tartness and more of a baked apple or applesauce character. Mild caramel. Tons of apple in the flavour, nice balance of sweet and tart apple character. More cider than apple juice with just a bit of caramel sweetness in the background. Lightish body with average carbonation. On the dry side without being bone dry. Crisp and refreshing. Highly drinkable, especially if you like apples."
"Drinkability: New Glarus triumphs again as the undisputed masters of fruit beer. This one doesn't quite rise to the level of the Belgian Red or the Raspberry Tart - I doubt any can, though perhaps that's just my preference for those two fruits talking - but it's still an amazing brew. Lord knows what the abv% on this one is, but I wouldn't imagine it's high, which just enhances its drinkability, though I don't imagine this one would ever be ""dangerous."" Just a really nice, drinkable, authentic, tasty, aromatic brew. Highly recommended."
"Light to medium mouthfeel. Though this beer seems pretty filling. Its definitely drinkable though I don't think I'd enjoy bottles back to back."
"D - the most drinkable apple ale I've tried. Never gets too sweet, great for a hot summer day. So glad that New Glarus re-released this exceptional beer."
"pours a light copper, mostly clear with fluffy white head that is quick to leace. very nice lacing. aroma is a bright bouquet of various apples, tart and sweet. flavor is tart then sweet and tart again. Very little malt or hops to speak of, this is like a tart apple cider. Beautiful front flavor and finish is semi dry and very clean. excellently crafted."
"Notes: The NG Unplugged series has proven to be some of the more interesting and unique beers out there. This beer is one of them and pushes the definition of what a beer is."
"This has a nice bourbon(Maker's Mark) look to it, a nice amber gold and in my vast experiance, it's a good sign. This pours smooth with a brief, lacey head. Little carbonation a.k.a. not much bubble action but to taste it the carbonation is fine. The smell is sour apple, light citris and a hint of molassas. The taste is really nice with, of course, apple but not overwhelming. Some spice with notes of grain (rice)"
"I think this actually getting better with a little age on it. I bought it as soon as it came out and had a couple which I thought were very tasty. Now it is sublime. pours a very clean copper with a small head and moderate carbonation. The aroma? Well the aroma is probably the most natural smelling fruit beers I have encountered. A little tart. A little sweet. Hints of spice. Flavor started out on the sweet side but seems to be getting more tart as it warms a little. Again. It is such a natural flavor compared to some other fruit beers. I saw this for sale as recently as a week or two ago and now I am kicking myself for not buying a few more four packs."
"Drinkability- The very first time I had this beer on tap was a bar in Kenosha Wisconsin. Before I even realized what was going on, I had 6 of these delicious treats under my belt (By the time I was done I cashed the keg and could have bought an entire case from the brewery with how much I spent). I always drink these WAY to fast and it's about the most drinkable ""beer"" I've ever had. I use beer loosely since it's more like cider than beer but who cares. Amazing amazing stuff that they need to put on there regular lineup just like the Belgium Red and Raspberry Tart."
"D. Superb, easily a session beer"
"Another great fruit beer by New Glarus."
"The cap popped off with the sent of warm apples. The head was robust and tall over the crystal clear brownish amber body. There is a charge of tartness that sucombs to brown sugar. You get Granny Smith apple farm richness with the malt blending with sweet and tart apples. It's fall in a glass and it reminds me of the fruit farm I went to as a kid back in Northeast Ohio.(Paterson's) How could you not love a beer like this."
"Very good combination of apples and beer with the apples predominating."
"This beer was a serious treat."
"Thanks Beerbeagle!!! Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a tulip. Very clear dark orange. Virtually no head and little carbonation. Looks like a sugary fruit juice. My wife says ""that looks funny!"" Anyways...Smell is of kids apple juice out of a juice box or something. Really sweet smelling. First couple of sips taste almost exactly like a good, healthy apple cider and juice mix. Not real sugary sweet, but really fresh and natural. After the first few sips it mellows a bit and I get a more active mouthfeel to it. More bite and carbonation. It tastes more like a beer and less like the apple juice towards the back of your tongue. really interesting and tasty beer. Smooth yet crisp mouthfeel. I could suck this beer down really quickly, but I want to enjoy it. One is enough, though. A little too sweet."
"This is more like a cider than a beer, but it is very well done. I could definitely have more than one if these were available outside Wisconsin. Another solid offering from New Glarus."
"Overall: It's very well carbonated and the taste fits the style very well, although I'm not sure I could have guess that I were drinking a beer if I were blindfolded. As I said it tastes great but isn't something I'd drink a lot of, it would either get overpowering or old."
"This is another great fruit beer from New Glarus who certainly know their way around these styles. The drinkability may be slightly limited due to the massive sweetness, but it's still a great fruit beer."
"12oz bottle courtesy of ughsmash, light orange color, looks like apple juice. First whiff is apples and apple juice, surprise! Smells really sweet, not sure if I like it. Very strange taste, like the malts are wrestling the apples for control of the beer. Not a bad beer at all just very, very weird."
"Overall, this is a very refreshing beer."
"This is the most apple-forward tasting ""beer"" I've ever had. I am certainly glad I had the opportunity to try this extremely easy drinker. New Glarus did this one well. Good work, fellas."
"Great up front flavor of ripe apples, rich and smooth, with a slight backbone of the brown malt that makes it finish right between sweet and dry. Perfect, leaves you wanting more, and as an unplugged it's very nice, will have to try it with my remaining Berliner Wiesse, should be interesting, can't leave all these to the wife. Definitely better than any hard cider I've had."
"Not exactly what I was expecting, this beer is half way between a cider and an ale. It is better than any cider I have tasted, so it might be especially good for someone interested in cider. That said, it has a rather crisp golden yellow appearance with a white head that clears away quickly. It is rather carbonated and has an apple and floral aroma. It goes down very easily and tastes a little sweet, a little sour and went down very easily."
"Way to go New Glarus!"
"D - The only drawback to this beer is the apples. If you love the apples this would be great for you. I could only have a few of these in a sitting."
"This straddles the line of a fruit beer and a cider, but it works very, very well. I expect nothing but excellence from the guys at New Glarus and this was no expection. A wonderful beer that I am happy to enjoy!"
"Tried a 50/50 blend with the Unplugged Berliner Weisse, and it was better with just about 1/3 Berliner Weisse added to 2/3 Apple Ale."
"D - Ridiculously drinkable. If you are looing for apple, this is it. Simply put, New Glarus brews some of the best fruit beers... period."
"New Glarus does it again. It is a different monster than Belgian Red or Raspberry Tart, but just as tasty nonetheless."
"Pours a light amber with a frothy white head. Aroma is very sweet with candy and cinnamon. Flavor is sweet but also has an apple tartness at the same time. Light bodied, very sticky texture. A very good beer, the fruit is not overpowering but instead compliments the malt, yeast and hops."
"I have not had many apple Ales, but this on sets the bar very high, it will be tough to find a better one."
"Another great New Glarus fruit brew! Wish I'd grabbed more of this when I was in Milwaukee."
"Overall, this is an amazing fall brew; worth a pilgrimage to Wisconsin."
"D-You want drinkability? If you enjoy hard cider you will love this. As good as or better than most ciders I have had. I was told that if you like apples you will need to get at least a case of this stuff...well they were right! Wish I had more already! Truly a beer work or art! A job well done Dan...Thank you!"
"I plan on following the suggestion of a previous reviewer and heat one of these up like a hot cider."
"Incredibly drinkable, and perhaps the perfect breakfast ale. Another incredible Unplugged offering from this great brewery. The alcohol is almost hidden by the sweet, aromatic, and slightly tart apple juice. Im lucky to be able to make frequent trips to Wisconsin. I suggest you head to the land of the cheeseheads and pick up a few four packs before they are all gone."
"Light apple tartness up front. Ample apple sweetness follows and dominates the palate. The sweetness seems very apple-y though, and not artificial. Apple skin tartness picks up near the finish, along with caramel and pie crust. Finish is full of lingering apple sweetness mixed with apple peel bitterness. Medium bodied with a sparkly feel. A very interesting beer, that somehow avoids tasting too cider-y and keeps its beer character. Worth trying, even if you're not a fruit beer fan."
"Pours a crystal clear light copper hue with a quick one finger white head. A small ring of foam remains with little to no weibbing left on the sides of the glass. Smell is unbelievable. Sweet McIntosh, Gala, and Red Delicious apples dance in the nose, I don't think anyone could tell the difference between this beer and real apple juice. A sweet malty undertone with a tea like aroma as well. Taste begins with sugary sweet apple sauce and a a touch of cinnamon spice. Some graininess and caramel malt midway with more sweet apples. Aftertste is slightly dry with a cider like flavor. I just wish there was a touch more sour on tongue, but really, this beer (and I use that term loosely) is delicious. Light body with a crisp feel and mild carbonation. I drank apple juice like it was going out of style when I was a youngin. I don't detect any alcohol in this what-so-ever and could easily enjoy this every morning with breakfast if it was available to me. This is a must try for any beer geek, I need more!!"
"It drinks as well as apple juice. Heck you could almost mix up a cup of sparkling apple juice with a cup of this. Hats off to New Glarus!"
"Received this lone bottle recently from milwaukeeclassic (thanks, Duane)."
"D- Very drinkable, this really should be a regular beer for new galarus it would compliment their other fruit beers well."
"D-I was extremely impressed with this brew, a great combination of top-notch flavor and lively mouthfeel. I'm not usually big on this style, but I will definitely buy this again. It pairs well with crepes, and drinks well on its own. Sweet, but not cloying."
"Not much of a head atop this clear cider colored brew. Very little bubbling. Apples hit the nostrils, then some apples mixed with just little cinnamon and brown sugar, then more appples. The palate fels very juicey at the first sip and throughout all twelve ounces. Clean macintosh apple juice with a little suagr. Not sweet but fruity, I think the light amount of hops added just cuts the sweetness just enough. So this juicey beer stays sweet yet very drinkable."
"If you like fruit beers, get it. If it's not available by you Beer Mail me."
"drinkability: insanely drinkable for me - i love fresh apple cider"
"Another winner from NG - Wisconsin's most creative brewery and arguably its best brewery."
"A great cider type beer, very flavorful and about as great as you could expect an apple centric beer to taste. nice to actually have this come out again to retry it."
"Makes me want to open the one bottle I have left from the last batch brewed about 4 years ago to compare."
"bottle courtesy of ThomasHardy (thanks! You seem to be the US distribution of NG Apple): Pours like apple juice it has that distinct cloudiness that you get with apple juice. Aroma is like apple juice infused with yeast. Taste is sweet apples almost like an apple cider. I almost believe this could be good warmed up. New Glarus really knows how to do the fruit beers. This beer tows the line of beer and apple cider. You can still get a yeasty, alcohol (very light), dry finish. It's like apple juce with a little extra. Good."
"Poured a dark golden amber color with a nice white head that retained quite well. Smell is like smelling a crisp apple. Nice and tart, perhaps like smelling apple juice with slightly overripe apples; almost like stepping into an apple orchard. Taste is like biting into a mixture of different apples and moves into the taste of the apple skins, without the astringent tastes of actually biting apple skins. Light-medium carbonation, lighter side of medium bodied with a crisp, dry finish. Excellent drinkability, I'd be drinking plenty of this if it were still produced. This bottle was three years old and still held up remarkabley well, I can only imagine it was more powerful when it was fresh."
"The beer pours out a little head which falls leaving a real lacing and a slight head with good retention. The color is beautiful, goes from a golden color to to a cider brown color as it gets deeper towards the top. The smell is very crisp apple with some slight sweetness to it. There's also some tartness to it and it has some slight sulfur smells like in a lager. The taste hits you with a very sweet apple juice-like taste and then the tartness hits the tip of the tongue and after that the lager-like sulfur flavors come in to finish up the taste. It's a very light bodied beer. I also taste some smooth malty flavors that can be found in Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart. The light lager smells kind of go to backround and aren't as noticeable after a while. The mouthfeel is very nice and doesn't give me any problems whatsoever. Overall I would definetly have more of this, but only for a special occasion or if Dan brewed more of it."
"got this in a trade but I cannot rememer who sent it but thanks. poured a cider color with no head. aroma, apples, sweet, apples, apples some wheat, apples. flavor, just like apple cider with a little alcohol thown in. kind of tasted like a wine cooler."
"Drinkability: Despite the sweetness, i love apples, and I love the taste. Like I said, I'm a bit tore up that I won;t be getting any more of this stuff."
"Pours a pretty copper/amber color, crystal clear with a short foamy head that disappears in a few seconds. Nose is...APPLES. Delicious homemade apple cider. Yummy. Taste is....drumroll....APPLES. Slightly tart, sour, but still very sweet apple cider. This is one damn tasty brew. Probably too sweet for a lot of BAs out there, but I don't mind sweetness in beer usually, especially in a fruit beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly like champagne. Insanely refreshing on a hot August night. I could have drank a gallon of this stuff, but sadly I had but a bottle. If you can find this stuff and have an open mind toward fruit beers, I HIGHLY suggest you give it a try."
"I originally thought this beer was a seasonal of new glarus, but it is in fact what new glarus calls its unplugged series (hence the red foil) which means they make this beer pretty much whenever they feel like it, no specific time of year or anything. They brew it with actual apples, not apple juice, and I have heard that due to the complexity of the brewing process (and the pain of the apple chunks clogging pipes and such) that New Glarus has considered to discontinue it. But its a rumor. Reguardless I suggest socking up on it whenever you find it."
"D&N: If you like fruited beers, and you like apple cider, this beer will be a wonderful experience. I love it."
"Acquired this brew in a trade with battlekow."
"pours, well, candy-apple red. slight foaming and neat lacing. not much fruit aroma while pouring, but the snifter perfectly captures a huge apple juice bouquet.. not like the green apple tart commonly associated with belgian dubbels.. instead, sweeter and more cidery. the sugar here seems more derived from the fruit than the fermentation or malt. champagne-like dryness in aroma and a slight hint of something. hops? eh? taste is overwhelmingly apple, like faux grocery store passover champagne. supposed brown ale base shows no character. not much beer here, save for a malty note to build body. mouthfeel is a bit syrupy for me, but this beer far outweighs any cider around. moderately drinkable, very satisfying after a spicy thai meal."
"Taste: Banana nut muffins with a side of apple sauce, a bit too sweet for me, I like my fruit Beers on the tangy side better. It did remind me of a defunct Québec Beer that I used to love, Hopps aux pommes from Brasal."
"Medium bodied, and very drinkable. Thanks to stonecrusher for this sample. Even my girlfriend liked this one."
"New Glarus' Apple Ale smells and tastes astonishingly like fresh apples; and it's dark amber body with golden highlights is also reminiscent of cider. There's little head, and only a thin collar remains of that; and lacing is limited to just a few tiny spots here and there. The taste is of apples, although a touch of malt can be found if you look close enough. It's very delicately carbonated, and surprisingly much fuller in the mouth than might be expected. It finishes sweet with some lingering maltiness. It's certainly not your average beer, and I see it as somewhat of an apertif or dessert beer, but it's delicious regardless."
"A big thanks to Kev (kmpitz2) for sharing this brew. 12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a medium copper color with just a little bit of large bubble foam. There is no lacing. The smell has lots and lots of apple, and even a touch of cinnamon. It smells just like an apple pie, like grandma used to make! The taste is very sweet and cider-like. More cinnamon floating around. I bet Johnny Lieberman's apple pie beer tastes like this! The mouthfeel is very very heavy for a fruit beer, very nice. The drinkability fairs well also. A damn good apple beer."
"A strange brew tis true. One thats either a 'love it' or 'hate it' thing. I'm right in the middle, I don't particularly like it all that much, but it doesn't bother me or uninterest me either. I probably won't buy it again but I'm glad to have tried it. One of those types of brews."
"poured witha creamy dense white head, lacy on a almost clear amber sicer colored body. waffs of apples and some dense sugary malt, freshly squeezed apples and fresh apple skins and some residual sourness form the apples. oh my god...shocking and absolutly amzing first taste. sugary at first the some tartness hits followed by a tongue lapping sweetness that coats your lips followed by a very tart almost spicy prickly carbonation or acidic character. well pronounced tart sharp acidic character. no off flavors whatsoever very very well crafted...these guys are just amazing. for me though one bottle was enough, kind a wish i had a few more for further down the road."
"A nice change of pace beer...I would think about ordering it as a desert beer or perhaps with some pancakes for breakfest but that is about it....just real overwhelmingly sweet."
"I found this to be much better than woodchuck, which i didn't much care for when I had it many years ago. But, it is kind of difficult to remind one's self that this is beer, and not cider, whilst drinking. Nonetheless, a tasty and enjoyable enough beverage."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/4"" of eggshell head over the dark amber brew. Head was short-lived, quickly fading to a layer of small bubbles, and lacing was minimal. Excepting the head that was present, looks like cider. Aroma is deeply of sweet apples, with a tinge of sour here and there. Smells like cider. Taste is pretty much cider as well, but as much sour component, and this incorporates the slightest of discernable malt character, adding a smoothness at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability okay, but this one's just too sweet for what I would expect from a apple beer. Now if it were a cider, that would be a different kettle of fish, so to speak. Worth a try for fruit brew lovers out there, nonetheless."
"Not what I like, but it's sure to suit plenty of tastes out there...here's to them!"
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for bringing one of these for tasting. This one pours an amber color with a very small head that dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. Awesome aroma. Apples and more apples. Not tart or sour, but just a nice apple smell. Not sure how they did that and avoided the sourness. The flavor is excellent. Lots of non-sour apple flavor with some caramel. Wish I knew how they did this beer because I would brew it as my house beer. Loved it."
"Picked this beer up near my inlaws over turkey day. We're having it along with some apple pie just to accentuate it. The beer pours an amber color with hints of golden in there. The nose is full on apples. Not a lot of the tart apple, but I think I like it. DAMN. What a nice flavor. I wish my apple homebrew was liket this. The apple is up front and in my faaaace (for you Chris). The finish is caramel sweetness from the malts. No detectable hop really. Feel is moderate, but what I expect on this beer. Drinkability is huge. I want to drink more and more and more. What a great beer. I really like it and will buy more of it if I find it when home."
"Pours golden with a slight red hue. Little head with decent retention and lacing. Smell of a freshly cut apple. The taste is of biting into a fresh Macintosh apple, finish with malts and hints of cinamon. Remeniciant of the Belgian Red, supstitute apples for cherries. Very good brew, what I would expect of New Glarus."
"Deep orange robe, almost clear. Diminishing beige head. Direct apple compote nose overwhelms the senses. Shredded apple flesh thrown up the nostrils in a sweet fashion. Riped delicious (the brand) apple crustade, pie crust. Nice warming medium body, very comfortable, low carbonation. This is definitely interesting, but not in the leagues of the raspberry tart for instance. Maybe Im just more of a raspberry guy, but this seems sweet and simple, which Im aware the other one is also, but it fails to take on me and surpass futile concepts like caring about the complexity rather than overall enjoyment. Here, rather than smelling like a fresh harvest, it appears a bit oldish (which it sure isnt). I fear this wont age well at all, but Im very glad to have sampled it. Cheers Barry!"
"Nice looking copper appearance. Slight off-white head leaves sparse lace. Quite the inviting juicy apple aroma. Very pronounced and nicely blended. Maybe a little cinamon as well. Malt is in the background too. There is a great, juicy sweet apple taste to this beer. But also ghostly tartness as well. A blend of Cortland, MacIntosh and Jonathon apples was used. Slight cinamon character. Some light barley notes in the back and a bit of a drying character coming from the hops. Easily the best apple beer or cider I've enjoyed. New Glarus has got a handle on fruit beers."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown ale with medium head with very little retention. Aroma is, without any surprises, comprised of sweet apple. Taste is also overtaken by the apple juice taste, which is great since the apples that were incorporated in here are fresh, sweet (but not too sweet) and with just enough sourness in them. Malt and hops are very hard to taste. Body is just above average with some light carbonation. This is one fine fruit beer, well balance and without the concentrated feel to it."
"This stuff slides down like silk with little resistance. Some concerns that this isn't much of a beer, but I think if you add the bitterness of hops and a stronger malt body, the taste would completely fall apart. This is sweet enough to be a dessert beer or enjoyed alone by itself for you to discover its nuances. Combine this with a slice of fresh apple pie and vanilla ice cream and you've got a perfect match."
"Apple Ale is my first New Glarus beer and it's a winner. Apples and beer. A match made in heaven? Nope, Wisconsin."
"I enjoy the Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart quite a bit, but this is hardly drinkable for me. It maintains the fruit, but lacks the nuance. It's just not in the same league."
"Well, New Glarus has done it again, these guys just cannot miss on the fruit beers. True, I probably couldnt drink more than one due to the inherant sweetness. But I must reccomend this beer to everyone that can get their hands on it. It is pricier like all the NG fruit beers, but that is understandable because you can tell they dont skimp on the fruit. Get it while you can!"
"One thing to note, this is exactly as the label says..an Apple Ale. If you do not like apples or cider in general, you will be wasting your time with this one."
"I could drink this stuff easier than I could water. This beer is cutting it close, and is right on par with their other fruit beers, mabye even better. Wow, this is tasty, tasty stuff."
