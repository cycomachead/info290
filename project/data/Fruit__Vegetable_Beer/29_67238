The sour wheat comes in full force and drives away the raspberry and forces you to swallow because you don't want it in your mouth anymore. This is a nice beer once in a great while...but honestly, I gave most of my six pack away to friends and family. One and I'm done. Maybe not even that. Try it, but don't buy a whole sixer, you may find yourself trying to pawn off the other five to your friends. "Here, try this...it's...interesting."","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Jul 24, 2014"

This is closer to a cooler than beer. Taste is a mix between some grainy wheat malt notes with quite a bit of residual sugar and way too much of the awful raspberry syrup.

Average amount of bubbles streaming from the bottom and sides of the glass, so pretty middle of the line carbonation. The aroma hits you right of front which of course in raspberries with a hint of grains. The taste is of the same with lots of raspberries, with a sweet but tart finish.

I am surprised at the authenticity of the fruit in this beer, I thought itd be all syrupy and sweet, and it just isn't. the wheat malt is nothing special, but it is fresh too, and the yeast comes across a bit generic, but the raspberry is the intended star here. this is like the lemon shandy and the apple version were at the brewery, very potent and fresh. its hard for me to knock this, because at the source it really is worth drinking. a little sweet, a little thicker than it needs to be, but for a macro, its quite good when its fresh.","StonedTrippin","Jun 14, 2013"

Typical AB... make a cheap beer and put raspberries in it... I have to say this Is a good beer y time pop can bring with you to a party/beach and pound a few down easy. Very easy drinking and for what it's worth I didn't love it but would not be surprised if I was drinking it again. To me the raspberry taste was not aftificial and not overpowering.

Better beer sells itself due to the self-evident quality of the product.

3.01,7.9,4,3,3,3.5,2.5,"At the very least, this is a good looking beer. It's got a nice cloudy white-golden body with a large white head. The aroma is very heavy on raspberry with just a bit of grains and wheat in the back. The taste really isn't that bad. It comes on strong with a rush of raspberry that can't help but wind up tasting a bit artificial. Some more tartness would really help here, it's too sweet. The raspberry washes away to a toasty, grainy finish that is fleeting, but still rather nice. The mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated, with a bit of stickiness. The drinkability would be good, but the artificiality is wearing. A more realistic raspberry note over that finish would make this an excellent fruit beer. As it stands, it's just about average. I'd still drink them at a party or if offered to me.","shand","Jun 12, 2012"

It poured a cloudy yellow color, a thick white head, retention was excellent and it left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was very much dominated by Raspberry's, citrus and malted wheat. Light in body, this Wheat Ale had a malted wheat base, a splash of citrus (lemon), syrupy raspberry and coriander. Overall, this brew has mass produced written all over it. It is not the worst thing i have sampled from AB but it is also evident that high quality ingredients are not being used. The raspberry flavor is very much artificial. Decent attempt at intimidating a micro brew- but overall- not something I would buy another 6 pack of. Prost!","GossageBrewery","Jan 31, 2012"

Almost reminds me of the scent of a brand new box of fruity pebbles. The taste is smooth and mellow and there is definetly a wheat and a raspberry taste to it. The first part of the taste is much better than the last half as it starts sweet like a lambic and finishes like a dry cheap beer. An interesting concept but definetly needs some improvement when compared to other micro-brews but for an Anheuser-Busch product, this isn't too bad. Something to try once and that's about it.","Lemke10","Sep 22, 2011"

This one poured out much like the normal Shock Top, kinda hazy with a golden color to it. The head leaves no lacing and has very little retention. The smell of the beer is a little perfumy, almost artificial smelling. The taste of the beer has a pretty nice flavor to it. I was actually please with the raspberry flavor in this one. The mouthfeel was thin, nothing too stunning here really. Overall this brew was drinkable, I didn't mind having a second one right after the first.

In contrast to the aroma, the fruit juice flavor starts to become more and more unpleasantly artificial with each sip. The mouthfeel tries to help, with a light, smooth body and only a mildly tingly carbonation. In the end, however, this just doesn't taste like beer. Light and very fruity, it's more of a fruit juice spritzer than a beer. It's actually somewhat pleasant when viewed from that point of view, though, making it a potentially fine summery change-of-pace or a first stepping stone towards beer for a wine cooler drinker.","devilben02","Beers"

The taste starts out with a fake raspberry taste that follows some wheat and some hops that are hard to taste with the bad raspberry taste in my mouth. The aftertaste has the bad raspberry taste along with a soapy taste that makes me want to grab another beer to wash the taste away.

The taste doesn't change anything, much to my chagrin. The more I drink, though, the more medicinal the raspberry becomes. Why? This is just kinda mean, now.

It's like cracking a bottle of Clearly Canadian Raspberry (if you have that around you). Super watery feel in mouth, with slight smoothness at the last second, but that may have been my palate recovering from the shock (pun intended).

Mouthfeel is watery with quite a bit of bite from the carbonation, has a clean feeling on my palate, and a slight raspberry after taste. The sweetness takes away from the refreshingness of the beer.

Aroma has upfront tart raspberry jam notes with sharp wheat notes and a hint of citrus. Flavor was a bit too candy with the raspberry addition, the regular Shock Top isn't bad but the natural raspberry flavor added doesn't do it for me. Not sharp wheat just soft bready layers with a bit of chalky yeast flavors going on, minimal spice additions hard to pick up any one aspect of the spices. Look girls will love this stuff, but I'm not sold. Why do the next fruit infused wheat beer, when they could make a real craft style? Mouthfeel is slightly creamy lively carbonation not bad other than the cloying sweetness from the raspberry flavoring.
