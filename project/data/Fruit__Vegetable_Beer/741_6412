This beer feels slightly lighter but keeps a creamy body despite the easy drinkability and never feels overpowering.  The high(er) ABV lends a bit of warmth to the finish and is reminiscent of classic Marzen-style lagers.

Color was a pumpkin-like orangish-amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. I know that 8 is between 7 and 9, but my card does not have that shade. Nose was VERY spicy, cinnamon, clove and ginger being prevalent. Mouthfeel was much fuller than the Stoudt's pumkin lager, giving this one a creamy aspect. The spices were just right, not overwhelming and by closing my eyes, I could imagine drinking a cool pumpkin latte. This is a great pumpkin lager, but don't tell Linus or he might be panicked! Get it, a Great Pumpkin lager? Finish was semi-dry, but because they showed some restraint at the spice shelf, it was not as dry as it might have been.","woodychandler","Nov 10, 2013"

Cinnamon and all spice come through the most. One significant difference between this and other pumpkin brews is having a lager as a base. This provides a grainy and bready profile instead of a sweet base. The taste features some brown sugar sweetness along with cinnamon. The spice is present but not in your face. The flavor tapers off and has a dry bready finish. Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation.

The flavor largely matches the aroma, but is more subdued. The pumpkin takes a bit of a back seat to the spices, but the blend works well nonetheless. I think the tartness detected in the nose may actually be afforded by the cinnamon, which is not a spice I have much familiarity with when it comes to beers.

The mouthfeel is on the thinner side with I feel it should be heavier. Overall this isn't a bad brew, just not one of my favorites.","Knapp85","Aug 17, 2012"

3.97,13.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Honestly, I think this is the first time I've seen a pumpkin lager before... Regardless, it pours a mostly clear bright brass topped by a finger of pale off-white foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, light white bread, light caramel, sweet flowers, clove, and a touch of mildly tart orange flesh. Nice and spicy, baby. The taste brings in more of the same, with the bread coming in lightly toasted, the orange toning down the tartness, and the caramel coming in a bit stronger. There's not much actual pumpkin in here, if at all, but the spices are definitely present in spades. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a surprisingly tasty and drinkable brew, one that really embraces the spicy side of pumpkin beers without going too far with it. Well done.","TMoney2591","Sep 28, 2011"

3.28,-6.3,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Lakefront's Pumpkin Lager looks pretty good, a slightly cloudy, suitably orange color, capped by a fine white head. Smells yeasty, with hints of the promised pumpkins and spices, but not much. The taste is yeasty as well, kind of musty, a little bit of pumpkin in the finist. The mouthfeel is a little harsh. Certainly not a very pumpkin-y pumpkin beer.","battlekow","Sep 19, 2005"
3.49,-0.3,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability -- I can only drink this beer once in a sitting. This will most likely be my last Lakefront Pumpkin for the year, although a buddy of mine tried it on tap at the Landmark 1850 and he said it was awesome. He had three in one sitting.","ClearDog","Sep 15, 2005"
3.07,-12.3,3,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Drinkability - the taste and medium body are nice, but the lemon wash ultimately has me seeking something else tonight.","brewdlyhooked13","Jan 19, 2005"
2.07,-40.9,2,2.5,2,1.5,2,"Pumpkin Lager Beer is as two-dimensional as they come and is, quite simply, abysmal beer. I have never homebrewed, but I have no doubt that I could do better than this on my first attempt. I will now have serious reservations about trying any more beer from Lakefront. You, however, at least with regard to this particular beer, have been sufficiently warned.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 17, 2004"
2.14,-38.9,2,3,2,2,1.5,"Cloudy golden-orange color, aroma of cinnamon and pumpkin. Small white head that doesn't last, not much lacing either. Pumpkin , ginger, cinnamon and butter bread flavors, Medium body body with a buttery mouthfeel, finishes pretty sweet, I had a tough time finishing the bottle.","maxpower","Nov 24, 2004"
3.16,-9.7,2.5,4,3,2.5,3,"Overall not a horrible beer...i like some aspects of it and will enjoy the other two bottles I have but the sour/green apple notes bring this score down(even though they are not AS strong as some of the Lakefront litter I have tried)","ZAP","Nov 17, 2004"
2.73,-22,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Hazed dark golden tone. Just a skimming of a white head. Lacing is minimal. Nose is all about the spices. Pumpkin Pie spice, clove, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg. A little sweet malt underlying everything. This beer's got some spice on the buds, but it's pretty weak in the malt department. Pumpkin taste is lacking. It's a little phenolic/medicinal as well. Not really that enjoyable.","Bighuge","Oct 30, 2004"

4.03,15.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I really liked this beer and look forward to trying more of the style. There is a great deal of complexity possible in this style and I believe this beer does a nice job of accomplishing this.","filabrazilia","Sep 26, 2004"
4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Orange in color with a brown tinted head. Lightly spiced, and sweet aroma. The big and malty flavor holds the spices in check and the body makes this feel like a meal. The smoothness makes me feel like I'm drinking a regular beer. This is very well balanced. One of my two favorites in the pumpkin beer category.","redmosquito","Sep 10, 2004"
2.48,-29.1,3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Completely clear sub-amber appearance, 1/4 inch head diminishes to large bubbles on the surface in a minute. Laces in very random spots. Not much other than pumpkin pie spice to the aroma, slight sense of white pepper maybe. Low carbonation (too low), mouthfeel is felt-like and a little sub-par. Flavor starts predictably, vegetal in a pronounced cooked celery and carrot sense with cinnamon, sugariness and nutmeg combining in an early statement but giving up to a watery close. Spice attenuates the aftertaste. A little obvious and with no aspects to balance it out. As a pumpkin beer overall, the mouthfeel makes this one less than average for me.","ADR","Aug 29, 2004"

3.14,-10.3,3,4,3,2,3,"Clear golden with an orange hue. Head is small and reduces to just a thin white film. Has a nice spicy aroma of cinnimaon, allspice and nutmeg that resembles pumpkin pie well. As others mention, a bit over carbonated and thin. Flavor isn't all that bad but could be fuller. Doesn't match the aroma at all. A little bitter. I haven't had a good pumpkin Ale in years and the last good one I had was BB's several years ago.","BierReise","Oct 15, 2003"
3.04,-13.1,3,4,2.5,3,3,"I was surprised to find this at Frog Bear Wild Boar, a bar/club not really known for the beer selection. Amber color with an off-white head. Aroma is almost spicy enough to make your eyes water. Ginger absolutely dominates, with a little pumpkin and malt crying for attention. This was a little hard to drink because of how robust the spicy flavor was. I would have welcomed more hops or malt to balance out the spice assault. Dry finish. An interesting attempt but not something I am going to search out again.","Dogbrick","Feb 02, 2003"
3.61,3.1,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"A good autumn brew to be had if not just once a year. A good looking appearance with its hazy orange color and fluffy white head. The two-inch head fades quick to a thin film with little lace. The oder was its down side for me. The taste of pumpkin and spice, mainly nutmeg & cinnamon was good. Mouthfeel is left very dry at finish.Overall a pretty good seasonal brew.","chilidog","Dec 01, 2002"
3.07,-12.3,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a hazy brownish-orange with a thin head that disappeared in a few seconds.  Aroma is of sweet pumpkin pie and nutmeg.  I wasn't sure what to expect of the taste, but surprisingly the spice, pumpkin flavor and mild hop taste were refreshing.  Pumpkin Lager is a somewhat gimmicky beer, but nonetheless a good Fall and Thanksgiving beer to try.","Winter","Nov 10, 2002"
3.95,12.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A refreshing seasonal lager that I look forward to every year.  Pours hazy orange with a soft white head with heavy carbonation.  The aroma is nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spices, along with some malty notes.  The taste is the aforementioned spices, blended with a faint pumpkin body and limited hop bite.  The body is a bit thin, but overall this is a very good specialty lager that signals the beginning of fall in Wisconsin.","brakspear","Oct 10, 2002"
