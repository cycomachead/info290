T: just like the nose - juicy, sweet, tart raspberries; jammy, but not overly cooked; a little biscuity; very much like a baked raspberry tart.

Pours with a creamy khaki colored head that produces lots of wispy lace. Plenty of raspberry aroma with a bit of grain in the background. Tart to start, leading to a sweet, but not cloying middle and finish. Big raspberry flavor predominates. Clean fruit finish with no bitterness. Medium light body and medium carbonation.","LittleDon","Dec 25, 2014"

Tastes like raspberry cobbler with an initial rush of berry sweetness that's quickly overcome by slight sour puckering and just when you think the beer is becoming too sweet the malt & hop make their grand beer saving entrance and balances everything out. Finishes slick and wet leaving my palate craving for the next sip. Outstanding from the masters of fruit beers","oldmankoch","Dec 22, 2014"

Then after inspecting the beer I didn't notice a jewel like sparkle and my nose detected a very acidulous smell. The brew poured very brown and muted looking in color. After the first sip it was obvious that the beer was off. Lots of vinegar and a very acidic burn down the throat. Barely any berries to speak of and just a huge disappointment. I'd love to try it again, but not for $20.00.","ThePaleRider","Oct 16, 2014"

The framboise body alone would be a world class beer but the fresh berry notes push it to legendary. Bright, fresh, delicate, and artfully brewed. I would feel bad drinking this every night because it's so good it demands to be consumed after a world class meal  or something of that caliber. This beer is outstanding and is well worth the pain of getting it (trust me I had some pains getting it). Get your hands on this beer","BergBeer","Sep 24, 2014"

Clear, but dark red.  Not that it needs mentioning, but fruity aromas and sweet, light crisp taste with a tart finish.  An easy drinker and pairs perfectly with brunch!  Will definitely revisit this classic.","toolbrew","Aug 30, 2014"

Smells of strong and fresh raspberries, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight tartness and slight dryness. Tastes of fresh raspberries, hint of hops, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, the aroma and body of the raspberries is amazing. The freshness is akin the Samuel Smith's Raspberry, but the blend is even better. It tastes of more than pure raspberry juice; tart, slightly hoppy, and irresistible.","Tone","Jul 07, 2014"

4.54,4.1,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Thanks Atoneworks for this amazing beer! Pours a hazy ruby color with a large head that dissipated fast, but did leave a solid finger of thick foam atop the beer. No lacing. The nose can be described in one word: raspberries. The taste isn't very far removed from the nose: raspberries, sweet at first and finishing tart, almost sour. Light bodied with light carbonation. Overall, this is an extremely well crafted beer that is highly drinkable. Balanced, this beer is neither cloying sweet nor mouth puckering sour, it is highly drinkable and quite refreshing. Outstanding job, New Glarus!","JohnG190","Sep 24, 2013"

4.88,11.9,4.75,4.75,5,5,4.75,"Let’s face it, this is about as good of a fruit beer as you can get with only the current defunct Belgian Red to rival it. This pours a cloudy, reddish color with a fizzy light pink head. The aroma erupts with the scent of sweet raspberries. The taste is amazing with sweet delicious raspberries. Only downside is that you really do need a drinking buddy otherwise 1 bottle is way too much sweetness for 1 person alone.","Lemke10","Aug 20, 2013"

Fresh raspberries and more fresh raspberries. More sweet than tart aroma. Wow! Tart up front quickly fades into sweet raspberries that sit and linger on the palate. Tart comes back with another sip. Oh man this is awesome. Some oak dryness and ever so slight bitter keep this from being too sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel--expected lighter--with no hint of alcohol (pretty low anyway).

I do think having this in my cellar for a few months did help tone the sweetness down a little bit however it was still a little bit too much for my liking. To my liking I could picture this being a little bit better with a year on it (some people might not agree though). Overall I thought it was decent but not something I would seek out again, I can see how a lot of people really like this beer though.","jaasen64","Feb 22, 2013"

4.12,-5.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"a very special beer. used this instead of champaigne last night to bring in the new year. thanks to my girlfriend for hooking this up for me! the much anticipated pour was a red tainted pale brown color, mostly clear, with a ton of rising bubbles and a persistent finger or two of fizz. the nose takes you by surprise. its potently fresh raspberries, juicy and lush and overripe. there is also a medium toast malt underneath that gives this one a little more substance than perhaps the belgian red has, which i certianly appreciate. flavor too is heavenly raspberries, this brings me to late summer in the woods picking huge berries and stuffing my face growing up. some tartish yeast in here too adds a slight puckery element to balance the sweetness of the fruit. finish is perfect mix of sweet and tart, with sweet probably just getting the edge. the feel was interesting. its insanely carbonated, much like the champaigne we were replacing with this brew. body is light but not too too light, and the alcohol is of course super low, but to me this wasnt super drinkable. i think the sweetness combined with all the bubbles made it more of a slow sipper, and when we finished the bottle, i had definitely had enough of this. that said though, this is a rare treat to be savored and shared. new glarus has now given me two of the best fruit beers in the known world, so thanks for that!","StonedTrippin","Jan 01, 2013"

Small amounts of bubbles on top that led to nothing although I think there were some problems with the lines. No lace on the sides going down, swirls brought up. Scent is raspberry to the max, I mean raspberry. It seeps out, with some faint chocolate, vanilla, but mostly raspberry, maybe some malt, it's there somewhere. This is a sweet desert beer and I see it going well with ice cream, possibly a float. Raspberry, vanilla, sweet malt, bordering on cloying, yet a nice tart hit towards the back keeping the balance. Body is quite creamy, tart and stealth for a 4% beer. Tangy delicious and something for the ladies, and gentlemen.","BARFLYB","Nov 24, 2012"

3.88,-11,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a clear crimson amber with a thin head that fades quickly. The nose is vegetal with a potent raspberry sweetness...without any indication of alcohol or tartness. The taste is just as sweet as the nose, but much more tartness finally presents itself. The aftertaste (proceeding the mouthwatering tartness) is malty and sweet. This beer doesn't resemble cough syrup, which is an added bonus! A slight yeastiness complements the beer's sweet nose and taste. It's a light bodied, drinkable, framboise-like beer that's slightly lacking in carbonation, but has sufficient malt characteristics to remind me this is actually a "beer" I'm drinking. I don't understand why this beer is quite so raved about, but I think it closely resembled blushing monk (which I prefer more) and is worth trying.","ThePorterSorter","Oct 20, 2012"

Pours from bottle into my JK Farmhouse glass. Wrong glass for this, but I have nothing else. This is a crystal clear raspberry red color, very little head, but tight carbonation bubbles come up from the bottom of the glass. Smells great, looks great. Taste- What I love about this is that the sweetness and the fruit flavor all is very natural. It has some nice sugary sweetness, but it seems more like real fruit sweetness than some sort of artificial flavoring. As expected, there is a nice puckering tartness to this on the end, and a dry finish with tight carbonation. Really nice beer, will seek this out again.","lnashsig","Jun 07, 2012"

4.23,-3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A bit of a gusher, poured from the bottle into a Tired Hands stem/wine glass, light brown color mixed with strawberry red, clear, and a large, foamy pink-white head; decent retention, soapy lacing, bubbles came back to life after a gentle swirling. Nose is bittersweet, bready caramel infused with fresh raspberries. Taste is similar, tart raspberries up front (oh, I get it now!), good balance of sweetness. Not straight up juice like a Lindemanns Framboise; there's a good bready malt base in there to remind you this is a beer, a touch of bubblegum, and a leafy finish. Chewy mouthfeel, medium body, medium to low carbonation, with a few little bubbly streams visible rising from the bottom. A very enjoyable beer overall.","Rifugium","Apr 03, 2012"

The taste is crazy good. The raspberries shine through tremendously. Slightly sour with sweetness that pulls through at the end. The finish is strong but short.

The beer poured out as a nice clear looking ruby red color with a cream colored head on top. The smell of the beer floods the nose with a rush of fresh picked raspberries. There isn't too much else on the nose except for a light amount of tart funk, very light though and almost unnoticeable. The taste of the beer is sweet, it's loaded with raspberry flavors that dance on your taste buds leaving behind a tingling tartness behind. The beer finishes dry leaving you ready for the next sip. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a soft carbonation to it. Overall this is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for with this beer, I would enjoy this one over and over again.

The body of this beer is clear dark red, thousands of bubbles rise up to form a champaign like head. A purple tinted head rises to two fingers before quickly settling to just a ring, leaving behind no lacing. The only way to describe the nose and taste of this is raspberries. On the label they claim to use wheat and hops, but all I can detect is the sweet sweet berries. Mouthfeel is very lively with carbonation, like a champaign or sparkling wine. Mouth puckering tartness is very well balanced by the sweetness. Don't know what else to say, other than this is worth seeking out.","match1112","Jan 29, 2012"

3.58,-17.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a lighter bodied bright bright red in color with a dirty pink head that turns into lacing around the glass. It smells and tastes of syrupy sweet and creamy raspberries. It's like a smoother version of the Lindeman's Framboise. There is a lot of jam and sugar. The carbonation stimulates all of your taste buds and teases it like you're going to experience some tartness but really all you get is sweetness. It's ok, just a lot of sugar. It's definitely nowhere near Blushing Monk territory. It drinks light with a good amount of carbonation that really fits the beer well. This is a dessert beer first and foremost and would pair very well with chocolates or chocolate cake. By itself, it's a little much.","aasher","Dec 06, 2011"

The taste was full on sweet raspberry, with twists of maraschino cherry juice, cherry skins and cranberry. Tart, acidic (but not too much), then finishing with a light syrupy sweetness. The body was light and the carbonation was high. Was a wonderful beer to share with my wife.","surlytheduff","Oct 23, 2011"

Overall, I was kinda disappointed by this beer. I thought it would be a bit tart...since the word "tart" is in its name. This beer is a bit overly sweet for my liking, but not nearly as bad as Lindeman's Framboise. I guess if I were a fan of fruit beers, this one may be more appealing to me.

Pours a transparent brownish ruby with no head, just a light smattering of bubbles on the surface, at first. Aroma is a nice mix of band-aid, juicy raspberry and earthy almost-funk. There’s less sweetness than the Red, which I appreciate, but still a bit too much, and a similar cough syrup note pops up in the taste. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, probably a shade less than the Red. It’s a beer that I sorta enjoy but couldn’t handle, much less want, anything more than a small glass. It’s probably a good choice for blending with stouts, if you want to explore that.","popery","Aug 15, 2011"

There is almost no stickiness to speak of, and there's never any question in the integrity of the berries used. This beer does walk a fine line with such low ABV for me, it really could have been a disaster, but it really wasn't. There's no chaos in the crafting of this brew, it's a refined recipe of extreme raspberry sweetness. That said, it's not quite tart in nature.

4.37,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pretty minimal head that dies off quickly on this one. Has a golden body with a sort of purple glare to it. I honestly got a ton of honey in the nose with it being the dominate note, and some berry-ness tucked in behind it. The taste was to me like raspberry infused honey. It was very sweet, but never hit a super-sugar level thanks to its honey like character, and the raspberry was very natural seeming as present, though perhaps the sweetness of raspberries was played up quite a bit in the flavor. The mouthfeel was superb, with again a honey like slick and smooth quality, but juice like viscosity. It would be very hard to not call this beer delicious and hard for me to say I did not enjoy it thoroughly. I had to knock it down a little though because I thought it lacked complexity and also, at 4% abv, you have a lot of room to make a beer delicious. I think they probably could've tucked more alcohol into this, or at least should've invited the challenge to the flavor. Anyway, for an extremely delicious, sweet low-abv treat, I don't see it getting much better than this.","Klym","Jul 11, 2011"

It would be nice if they could put this in 12oz'ers because 1 would be perfect. The larger size is almost too much in one sitting (for me). While not cloying....this does stray from the malty/hop beverage I usually prefer. That said....a nice change from wine. Would go great with some chocolatey desserts and shared.","Brunite","Feb 04, 2011"

Poured a deep dark red with a one and a half finger off-white head with a slight pink hue that subsided to a minimal amount fairly quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and raspberries (duh!). The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberries, slight spices, and a nice tart note. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I opted to drink this one on Christmas Day to de-stress after spending time with the family. Had a very nice aroma and flavor going on with this one. Glad I have another bottle of this laying around so I can share this one some other BAs in my area. This is a must try of any fan of the style or those who are feeling a little adventureous.

First sip astounds... equal parts sweet and tart raspberry with neither overpowering each other or the overall tastes.

It pours a deep garnet/ruby/other miscellaneous red-colored gemstones topped by well over a finger of slightly pink-tinted light ecru foam. The nose is an explosion of sweetened raspberries, as though a bowl o' them berries had been sprinkled liberally with confectioner's sugar. Some blueberries may or not be in the bowl as well, and some cinnamon seems to have been added to the sweetening party, though in much less abundance. The taste follows pretty dern closely, but a nice tartness replaces the seemingly sugariness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sticky, syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice bit o' fruity goodness, excessively drinkable and increasingly tart/complex (so to speak) as the tasting goes on.","TMoney2591","Oct 06, 2010"
3.75,-14,4,4,4,3.5,3,"This beer as expected pours a nice ruby red color with the slightest of pink head on the surface that fades away rather swiftly. The smell is of tart raspberries (surprised? I know!). It may actually be my imagination, but I believe in the tail end i smell a buttery character. The combined smell is of a nice raspberry pie. The taste, well, I'm fairly certain I'm not drinking beer, but the label says that I am. The flavor obviously consists of raspberries, now the good thing about it is that it doesn't taste of the raspberry extract that many brewers use. It tastes of real raspberries and that is to its credit, you can definitely taste the difference. The mouthfeel is a little too syrupy for my liking, but it does carbonate well. The drinkability for me faded rather quickly. What started as something easy to drink got progressively harder, for it seemed the beer grew more sour on the palate. The caveat is that I'm not a fruit beer guy. If you are, go for it, this is a pretty good creation.","Vdubb86","Oct 05, 2010"

If you like raspberries then the aroma and flavor are amazing and probably the best use of that fruit I've tasted in a beer. If you don't, well I guess I can understand you disinterest. Aroma is fresh raspberry puree, balance of tart and sweet with nothing else. Flavor is more of the same, medium thick body, mild carbonation, very dry finish and epic blend of raspberry sweetness and tart.

The smell is one of slight sourness accompanied by overpowering fresh raspberries. The taste is much the same with an added tartness that complements the fruity sweetness of the raspberries perfectly. The mouthfeel is one of a good dose of carbonation on a fairly light-bodied beer; not too different from champagne, but perhaps a bit less carbonation.

Like the Wisconsin Belgian Red, what makes this good to me is that it's not too sweet. Though this is less dry than the Belgian Red in my opinion.

Every time that I put my nose in the glass, a huge smile crept over my face. I love raspberry jam, and this smelled like just about the best raspberry jam ever. I have no idea how they got such a vivid and intense aroma into this beer. There is a great mix in the flavor of sweet fruit and tartness that keeps the sweetness from overrunning the drinkability. I have to day that I can't imagine the flavor keeping me captivated for ever like the aroma, but this is a superbly done fruit beer in every aspect.","bulletrain76","Aug 23, 2009"

Sour notes become more noticeable as it warms. Taste is a rush of sugar and fortified raspberry. Cloying, actually. Acidity comes through to balance it a bit, but still finishes very sweetly. Raspberry Tart is a pretty fitting name for this one. The feel is light-medium, but awfully syrupy. As much as I wanted to like this one, it's just too sweet...couldn't actually finish it.","philipquarles","Aug 21, 2009"

4.47,2.5,3.5,4,5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a nice reddish-purple color, with a kind of thin off white, maybe pink colored head. It's just a little hazy, but nice looking. The smell is very nice. Fruity and deep, not only raspberries, but also some other ripe fruits, an assortment, but the raspberries really stand out. There's also a kind of powdery malt presence, very light, a good sweetness, maybe a little bit of bread. There's also a good balance of tartness to go along with the sweetness. Very interesting. The taste really comes through well with the raspberries. You just get a mouthful of berry, almost like they're fresh-picked, a good juicy sweetness, a wonderful tartness. There not sweet and overripe tasting, but not green. The fruitiness is not really the least bit artificial. And there's also a nice powdery pilsener malt presence, not biscuity or bready, but just nice. The mouthfeel is nice, especially for 4.0%. It's kind of medium, and the sweetness makes it a bit fuller, but then that's balanced and toned down by the tartness. Really nice, and not like cough syrup. The beer is very enjoyable, and at a low enough ABV that it won't hurt you too badly. Though, I'm sure you would have some trouble drinking a bunch of it because of the intense fruit presence. I would definitely buy it more if I could, and the price was not bad, at maybe $8-9 for a 750. Definitely recommended.","taylorhamrick","Jul 27, 2009"

Gooey raspberry pie filling, great stuff. A bit dry in the finish as well. Medium body with a very crisp feel in the mouth. This is quite the treat and one that can be enjoyed by all. Very drinkable, very flavorful, and very refreshing. I have a 2007 bottle of ST Choklat I plan on blending with, hopefully it turns out as delicious as it sounds!","BeerTruth","Feb 01, 2009"

Smell is rich, decadent raspberry madness. Tastes like a raspberry sorbet, extreme tartness creeps up on you after the swallow, and zings the back and sides of the tongue like something you'd find in your Halloween candy bag. Tartness and raspberry flavors linger on and on, very finely carbonated and refreshing...you could pair this with all kinds of desserts. Based on this, the Wisconsin Belgian Red, and the Apple Ale, I can't imagine a brewery producing better fruit beers. Just fantastic stuff.","corey0212","Jan 31, 2009"

The flavor was quite different: tartness was the king here with sweet raspberries coming in second place. Mouthfeel was smooth and light with carbonation which equals stellar drinkability. Great choice if you like raspberry jam because it's almost the same thing minus the seeds and plus a minimal amount of alcohol.","deliriumfest","Jan 19, 2009"

This beer pours a magnificent deep maroon but barely produces any head whatsoever and what head it does produce quickly disappeared into a completely still beer. The aroma is amazing. It encapsulates the essence of a raspberry. Up front the aroma is a like raspberry jam, sweet and sugary but at the end the nose, the aroma becomes quite tart and it makes your nose hair tingle. The taste follows suit to a tee. Sweet raspberry hits your lips and tongue but the more you hold it in your mouth the more the sour/tartness comes through. It coalesces every aspect of biting into a fresh raspberry. The mouthfeel is light and crisp but leaves a sour twinge in your jaw and a dryness on your tongue.

Still easily one of the sweetest beers I've had, but I tend not to mind that too much.","JDV","Apr 06, 2008"

It is tart, maybe acetic, but in a most refreshing way. It is smooth as silk in the mouth, with a crisp finish. I think I get a little bit of anise aftertaste.

I thought it would start to be a little cloying but did not seem to be that way. Some nice tart notes as well. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, slightly syrupy, and gently carbonated. Drinkability is high due to great flavors and low alcohol. It makes for a good dessert type beer. I will however recommend that this beer be shared with at least one other person, preferably more. I openned it to share with my girlfriend and she didn't want any. So I had to take out the 750 and found myself tired of it and slightly annoyed by the end.

It looks like a weiss head got stained on its way being poured through all the raspberries that my nose is telling me this is chock full of. Raspberry first, with a sour note among strawberries. Bit o' yeast. Remarkable flavor - thick on the raspberries as one might expect, but in no way one-note. The inital cranberry taste threw me off a touch but blends into cooked raspberries, as if baked into a pie (or tart, duh), followed by fresh picked berries surrounded by a tart flemish red quality and cherries. The sourness practically curls back up the tongue with the help of light carbonation after working its way to my throat, leaving the taste of raspberry seeds to linger. The mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy intially but fades of the tongue quite quickly. I'd describe it as dry if the sweetness weren't keeping my tongue feeling pleasantly coated. As to drinkability, its not something i could drink every day but would be thrilled to have this available to me locally. A fantastic dessert beer and something I'd love to serve to friends who aren't into beer. Huge thanks to mully for the bottle, wish I hadn't gotten ahead of myself and downed the Belgian Red already, want to review it in light of this one. Both phenomenal.","grandq","Mar 08, 2008"

Smelled of fresh raspberries - when I closed my eyes that's all I could think of. Even the aroma of earthy seeds was captured. The flavour was heavy on fresh raspberry character too, but with added complexity. It started on the sweet side with balanced tartness slowly taking over. There seemed to be a bit of grainy malt just at the edge of perception along with a mild, mellow spicy character. Earthy raspberry seeds and tartness lingered in the finish. Full bodied with a little stickiness, carbonation was lively yet contributed a smoothness to the texture. Finished on the dry side. Great stuff and super drinkable. Definitely world class.","DrJay","Mar 02, 2008"

Body is a very deep brown with a bit of a murky hue. A fragrent nose brings about thoughts of raspberry chewy candy and a bit of candied malt. Enters the mouth with a long creamy tart feel. Notes of crisp apples, fresh raspberries, and even end a nice mellow malty sweetness is faint on the end of the palate. A very lengthy fresh sour feel is prominate on the finish and creates a pleasant mouthfeel. I speak a lot of the sour and tartness of this beer but it is not to harsh but well balanced with a touch of woodsy malt sweetness.

I really did not know what to expect going into it, but have heard it is simply outstanding. So needless to say the red wax coated 750 beckoned me from the start and I popped one open last night. Poured a very nice raspberry colored red with a small pink colored head and very nice carbonation visible throughout the session. The smell was rich with raspberry essence. Extremely strong so that nothing else could possibly come through. Now the flavor was to die for. I have never been the biggest fan of fruit beers in general, but this has just come to a whole new level. So sweet yet tart and sour at the same time, the flavor was so strong, yet not overpowering and not too sweet as to make you sick, it was in a word, perfect. It had the most perfect taste for this style I could have ever imagined. A great light body and great carbonation made it feel like water and there was just no hint of any kind of alcohol in this. This was by far one of the best brews I have ever had. I was raving mad about this all night long and easily killed the bottle myself. I just did not think anything could taste this good, this was fantastic. I would love to get my hands on as much as I could, I have to give it up here.

Really nothing to say other than someone took some of the best raspberries, squeezed the juice out of them and somehow hid some alcohol in there. Makes you pucker in delight! I love sour stuff, I love beer, I love this beer. Thicker than I thought it would be in the mouth without much carbonation.

Fruity and somewhat spicy aroma-I think the spiciness comes from thet heavy fruit more then anything. Big malt and fruit flavor-tart and sweet and very, very refreshing. The rasberry character really stands right out. For all the sweetness up front it finishes quite dry and tart. Great body for such a low abv beer. Overall what can I say-just a great, great beer. It is almost hard to call it a beer from the fruit flavor it has.

It had almost no head and that was gone in a blink of an eye. No lacing. The aroma was obviously heavy on raspberries but you could also smell the oak from the barrels. Also had a bit of a "wine" smell to it. The taste was really good and not too raspberry as I feared it might. I like raspberries but find that too much is not a good thing. The only downside to the taste and mouthfeel was that it was so tart that each drink made me pucker up a bit. Not enough to be annoying but close. For that reason, I've got the Belgian Red rated a little bit higher. Overall, an incredible beer that you've got to try.

4.8,10.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Ruby red color with a light pinkish head leaving excellent lacing. Rich smell of tart raspberries; reminds me a lot of the raspberry Jell-o my grandma used to make. Raspberries lightly pucker in your mouth, it's really like eating raspberries fresh, only in liquid form. The amount of tartness is perfect, not overly acidic like how some raspberry framboise's can be; sour, without the harsh. Carbonation dances on the tongue, enhancing each flavor. Medium bodied, finishes a bit dry. Incredibly drinkable, if this was in a nonic pint glass, I'd probably end up polishing off the bottle in no time.","badbeer","Apr 07, 2007"

The smell is just like a fresh raspberry bush-only better! Really good smell of sweet/tart raspberries that balance perfectly! The taste is a burst of great flavor and it doesn't have the base feel that is malty, I can sense it's still there, but I have to look. The mouthfeel is smooth, smooth and there's nothing offensive about it.

This beer is like you went out and picked a bucket full of raspberries, and squashed the juice into a bottle. It really does taste like you just picked them, I wanted to pick the little raspberry hairs out of my teeth. The sourness keeps it from being too cloying, but it's not some something you would want to drink all day. Outstanding, to be searched out.","dfried","Mar 28, 2007"

The yeast is the only flavour distracting from the berries, in fact the best way to describe the flavour of this beer is raspberry jam on toast. Very pleasant. Sweet but never cloying, as a fruit beer should be. The mouthfeel is very much like sparkling wine, and the finish is puckering and dry. Low ABV makes it very drinkable, but I'd hesitate to have more than a glass after dinner. Drinkability for me personally suffers because I find it's giving me heartburn, but that's my stomach for ya. All in all an exceptionally well done fruit beer and will not disappoint those looking for an after dinner treat that's not cloyingly sweet. Hey, that rhymed!","trevorwideman","Mar 25, 2007"

Fresh raspberry juice taste stays through the acidic, tart, wild finish. Very nice balance of sweet and sour, with a notable flash of funk.

That nose continues into a kick ass blast of raspberry in the taste. Tart, and sour and sweet at the same time. Medium level of carbonation. I don't think they could have nailed it any better for the style. I poured a flute for the wife as well to celebrate the night. It was wasted on her as she just couldn't handle the taste. Very surprising and disapointing, but what are you going to do? For a woman that's been fed Surly Furious, Hop Slam and Stone Ruination, you'd think she would appreciate the tartness for what it is. No matter, more for me. I wish there was someone else in the house I could share this with. I won't chance corking and trying tomorrow- I will just have to bite the bullet and finish myself.

We also mixed some Razz Tart with Young's Double Chocolate Stout to create a fabulous beer dessert. This beer has an enchnating red color with a pinkish head that fizzles away rather quickly. Sourness and raspberry sweetness dominate the aroma. A burst of raspberry flavor comes first, followed quickly by the tart and sour mouth sensations. The sourness is what makes this beer so drinkable and gives it some balance. Without the tartness this beer would not get the high marks it receives around the world. At GABF this is one of the first beers to run out. The body is medium light with the fruit providing something for the tongue to latch on to. The CO2 level is medium high; perfect for the style. The finish is sour and not overly fruity; not cloying at all. Basically, if you want a great fruit beer to go with anything chocolate or as dessert, do yourself a favor and get a bottle of this.","beersabound","Sep 25, 2006"

With pinkish head that kind of fizzles out, just lookin at it you know its going to be tasty. Aroma is a giant heap of rasberry goodness, the kind that you wouldn't mind smelling for the next half hour, very nice sweet/tart balance. Rasberries are by far my favorite fruit, and I'm just overjoyed so far. And then, you taste... perfection. I'll state is simply: there is no way to improve this beer. None. Falling under the category 'party in the mouth,' captures the very essence of the sweet yet tart rasberry, rivaling anything coming out of Belgium, and a real treat for that special occasion. The mouth is great, silky smooth but with a fizzy carbonation, full body, very nice. All in all, I wish I had some fudge or Belgian chocolates to eat with this, but even on its own an exceptional beer, worth all its praises.","objectivemonkey","Sep 23, 2006"

The beer just explodes with raspberry color, aroma, flavor, and tartness. Sweet, tart, and thickness to the point that it's hard to drink. Sip maybe, but not drink. Belly-aching sweet. Still the flavors and aromas are flawless. Juicy, ripe, rich and full. The beer has a lingering raspberry sweetness that goes on for days. Though I like the beer, it's a little over-bearing and could stand more beer-like qualities. I'm looking for a bit more vineous, woodsy, barley, hop, and drinkability--just a little more dimension.","BEERchitect","May 15, 2006"

The tartness comes thru more in the taste and quickly follows the sweet raspberry flavor. An effervescent like carbonation, like a sparkling wine, tingles on the tongue and hits in the back of the throat.

It's very aromatic too. Taste begins with a bit of raspberry skin tartness but soon the juices flow out. Really sweet, fruit gusher like, juice. The tartness is there but is overmatched by the juicy sweetness this raspberry drink offers. More carbonation, alcohol, anything please. Only the slighest hints of wheat and hops make there way in and really that's only when the beer warmed up on my second glass. A sticky acidic twinge finishes off this beer. Unusual, fruity, high quality in certain aspects but not so high quality in others.","granger10","Apr 21, 2006"

Mouthfeel is slightly thick, carbnonation is low. It is very comparable to a lightly carbonated fruit juice on the palate. Drinkablity is nice.

The overall effect is like a fruitfilled cake with malt powder sprinkled on it. This is so fantastic tasting that it is a little hard to believe. While the raspberry flavors are amazing what turly endears me toward the beer is the far aftertaste which is so malty and oat/wheat cake wholesome that it make me feels like a little kid trying a sweet treat for the first time.

You have to respect the brewer that can get this much berry flavor in a beer. The tart component is as much a part of the natural astringency of the berries, as a soured fermentation. The sourness is reserved and plays a supporting role. These over-the-top fruit beers are nice, but not necessarily my favorite because it is almost like having a fruity drink with vodka or something.

I've only smelled raspberries like this on two occasions; 1) raspberries fresh off the plant...tasting wild and woody; 2) thick raspberry goo dripping from a chocolate raspberry cake I once had at a very posh resturant. Woody is a great way to describe the raspberries...I wonder if this beer has lotsa tannins from raspberry seeds. Now for a first taste...tart and really rich potent raspberry. Sweet start and dry finish. Raspberry pop tart insides have a flavor this sour, but not as intense and not anything near as fresh berry-like. Wow, this beer is incredible and puts the Kuhnhenn raspberry beer to shame. Cranberry sour and lemon tart. Citric acid tart dry finish with an aftertaste of raspberries that just hangs around forever. The bottle is correct, there is no need to wait for dessert. This is dessert. Pair this with a thick rich chocolate cake (no, not a light and fluffy cake, a thin rich cake so dense with butter it appears like a brownie-like slab of chocolate). Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Though md, the carb seems sharp, amid the raspberry tart. This is not a complex beer, but this is liquid raspberries in a bottle like I never could envision someone ever capturing. Amazing.","mentor","Aug 17, 2005"

Taste starts with a mouthful of raspberries, some maltiness in the middle, then switches over to the tartness, which is somewhat subdued, we're not talking Cantillon sour here. Seems like it could just meld the flavors together a tad better, somehow.

Fresh picked raspberrys, raspberry jam, just intense fruit. I really...REALLY like it. It has grown on me since the first time I tried it. The flavor is full on sweet and tart raspberry. Not a lot of the beer behind it, but it comes through on the aftertaste as a creamy, wheaty flavor. The feel is thick and slightly syrupy, but not offensive. Drinkability is very nice.

At this point I was excited to take my first sip. There was an extreme amount of sugar cloyness that left me reaching for a glass of water. The heaviness of the sugar was not pleasant and there was no resemblence to beer coming from this. I love raspberries more than about any fruit and this was too much for me.

The beer is definitely sweet. It has a full fruity flavor and an almost thick body from the residual sugars that are left behind. It is quite tart in the finish, though it could perhaps use a bit more to balance the syrupy sweetness. I also get a bit of raspberry skin tannin in the finish.

This starts with a pure raspberries attack, will your defenses hold? You bet, keep them coming, hell yeah, I want more. After a few sniffs, you start to graps the necessary subtlety for a perfect 10 in the aroma department. Vanilla accompanies these stellar fresh fruits and who says vanilla often says woody touch which is also true here. First beer that makes me say: "I know what I'm smelling for breakfast tomorrow". People are not kidding when they say you taste the seeds, you almost feel them between your teeths. Marvellously crafted fruit beer, perhaps even better than a personal favorite: Quelque Chose. I can't believe a beer to be so full-flavoured at 4% ABV. Unique creation which can only be rivalled by New Glarus Belgian Red and as MartinT points out, once you're there, it's really only a matter of preferring cherries over raspberries or vice-versa. On parallel, I personally prefered the raspberry tart which seems to have more acidity (although it still could have used a bit more imo). This is the best single focus on one flavor I've encountered in my young life, this extreme sweetness never appears cloying, nor syrupy nor fake. Lots of stuff going on, eminently complex, crisp and contemplative. Superb mouth-filling body with enough carbonation to detract from the never cloying sweetness.

Fortunately, I had HiroProtagonist and his fiancee with which to split the bottle, and it ended up being the perfect amount. A dark ruby red, with twinges of hot pink both towards the edges and in the small head. Naturally, the smell was overwhelmingly raspberries. The fruit sweetness was undeniable, especially right off the bat, but towards the end of the flavor profile, it turned more tart (tarter?) and led to a puckering finish that was the high point for me. Quite similar to Lindeman's but noticeably less fizzy, more substantial; a rich, fluid, velvety mouthfeel. The entire beer (especially the tart finish) enlivened the taste buds to an amazing degree (better as an aperitif than dessert). What impressed me most was how fresh the raspberry taste seemed, practically fresh off the bush. The lack of any noticeable "beer" flavors definitely had me out of my element, and I found a little went a long way, so as to affect drinkability.

Berry chokes the palette and the nose concurrently -- and while its not the overly sweet tone of a cheap Framboise, its too much.

4.32,-0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"As soon as you open the bottle, you get smacked in the face with the raspberry aroma. Poured a raspberry purple/red with little to no head. Initially, the beer was very reminiscent of a Lindeman's Framboise, but as it warmed it showed quite a bit more character. The tartness really started to come out and a it was evident that the beer was quite a bit more complex than it initially led me to believe. A quite nice beer especially when you consider it's from a US brewery.","jreitman","Apr 26, 2003"

4.55,4.4,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"All told, I believe that this is a better and more complex creation than the heralded Belgian Red (which is still very impressive in its own right). I tend to dislike raspberries, but I still enjoy this one alot. Fans of the fruit will moan in delight.","cokes","Dec 13, 2002"

4.77,9.4,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Pours a luscious dark burgandy color.  Slight head.  The aroma is exquisite.  Smells like sweet raspberry pie.  This beer has a tart quality that isn't overwhelming.   Perfectly balanced.  Not your typical brew.  Great raspberry sweetness.  The malt and hops here are used as a backdrop for the fruity sensations to work their magic.  This is extroadinary.  It is like drinking a liquid raspberry pie with whipped cream.  A great experience.","Bighuge","Apr 21, 2002"
