"Wouldn't buy again, but not bad."
""
"taste is pretty bland, slight dry cherry taste. it tastes better than it smells, i was expecting something different once i smelled it. i can definitely see where people have said it's cherry cough syrup + dr pepper"
"I had such low expectations with this beer, but despite the overwhelming cherry aroma, the taste is actually good, a nice weizen with a hinch of cherry, not bad at all."
"I had this beer a few months ago. Thank goodness I didn't buy it. A friend brought a six pack over to the house. Thought it was a good idea due to the fact I'm from Boston originally. Back to the beer taste horrible don't know what Sam Adams  was thinking. Just not my swag at all. I am not into any fruity beer period. I like the fact the company tried an experiment, but epic fail in my opinion."
"Cough syrup and Dr. Pepper."
""
""
""
"Overly sweet and fruity. Not something I would ever buy again."
""
""
"i can only drink one bottle of this at a sitting. more than that and the fruit flavors start to get sickly on me. but that one first cold bottle for me is a good one. the cherry is brightly fruity and pronounced. the wheat is decent but i suspect could be better"
"This beer is revolting. It's like someone mixed a wheat beer with Dr Pepper. I got sucked in by having bought and enjoyed Samuel Adam's Cold Snap (which is pretty good) but when it ran out this took it's place. Yuck. I am on the ground with minimal sight and following the lights to the exit. GOOD DAY."
"So I used to think this was just OK until I took a tour at Sam Adams, my sister had given me a goodie from her law school and apparently most of the tour guides were law students they let us stay after the tour and when they ""washed"" out my sample glass they poured me the cherry wheat on draft and it blew my mind. It's upsetting that the stuff outside of boston comes from a diffrent brewery."
""
"This is one of my favorites. I've tasted many fruit flavored beers and Cherry Wheat does it right."
""
""
""
"It's a great beer because the cherry taste is very well assimilated. I am impressed with the company lately and they are one of the bigger ones that can pull novel beers like this off. The taste is not medicinal or anything other than a natural overtone. I liked it. Not my favorite, but it's good."
"Surprisingly on the darker side, with a definite cherry taste.  Not as fruity as one might think though."
"Tastes pretty much like cherry coke, I will buy one every now and then."
""
""
""
""
"O: I am so torn on this because I want to like it for the concept. It does do a few things right. There are some great subtle flavors in there like the biscuit, honey, and malt, but they are just overpowered by the impending robitussin-esque combination of Cherry and alcohol. I mean, it's not sink pour bad, but I would definitely only use it as a last resort beer at a party you didn't want to go to but are now stuck at for several hours. Bit disappointing since Sam Adams has always been one of my favorite craft/major brews, but not everything can be outstanding."
""
"Appearance 4.5, Aroma 3, Flavor 2, Palate 3.5, Overall 3.25"
"One of my favorite Sam Adams beers, good mix of wheat and cherry, cherry a little more present. Good aroma. Refreshing break from my last IPA binge"
"Come on you guys, it's not great but its not that terrible."
""
"If you take the artificial cherry taste from cherry coke and put it into a beer this is what you get."
""
""
""
"Great beer. Love the taste"
""
""
""
"I enjoy this beer a lot"
""
"Tastes a bit like cherry cough syrup added to beer, better off with a kriek or lambic."
""
""
""
"This is probably my favorite beer of the Samuel Adams line. Excellent flavor, and nice cloudy appearance as a wheat beer should have. Not available everywhere I've been, though, which is unfortunate."
"Drain pour! Tastes like cough syrup."
"Maybe the worst beer I've ever had.  Love Sam Adams but this is cherry robitussun with some malts & hops."
""
"Just, No, stop. Too sweet and taste like cough medicine"
"Cherries and beer don't really mix for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd buy a sixer of this and store it in my fridge. It's about like Blue Moon in the way that it would probably go with any similar food pairings. I like it."
""
""
"Not being a fruit beer lover, maybe I am not giving it a chance. Fair flavor but too much cherry, not enough wheat."
"Nice cherry flavor, hops and pilsner upfront with a nice mellow cherry sweetness in the back, not cloyingly sweet; just right."
""
""
""
""
"The blend of cherry and wheat beer is a perfect balance when you're looking for a good, honest, fruit-forward beer."
""
""
"Great in the summer. Mixed with Guinness is a fun mix up."
"An obvious classic. Any time of year, any food pairing. Pairs well with Cosmic Fog Milk and Honey ejuice. Pleasant aroma heavy of cherry , thick creamy white head that dissipates quickly. The viscosity is a bit thick with a hint of carbonation. The artificial cherry flavor stings your tounge slightly but the hoppy wheat like flavor kind of balances it out . An easy drinker . Great beer overall."
"Best of the Samuel Adams brand. I don't like fruit in my beer, but I love beer and I love cherries. I love this beer."
""
""
"Ahhh... Sam Cherry Wheat... a guilty pleasure of mine for years. As a more refined beer drinker, I'm not supposed to like this... but I do. Perhaps since it is brewed with MI cherries and I am a son of the mitten state.  Maybe because it brings me back to my youth, with cherry cough syrup nostalgia. Or possibly because it's just a unique and flavorful beer experience that conjures fond memories. Poured in to a tulip glass, it fills with a hazy, golden honey color and one inch of white froth. The head dissipated quickly, leaving only a thin ring atop the nectar-like liquid. Maraschino cherries and honey sweetness in the nose. A touch of cereal grain and subtle noble hop character. There is certainly ample cherry flavor that brings a medicinal quality, but it is washed away in the finish with a wheat thin like aftertaste. The hops brighten the beer with only a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is average, but suits the brew well. It is deliciously drinkable for such a polarizing concoction. This is sure to turn some people off with its cherry lozenge likeness, but to others it's a perfect pleasure that can be savored on occasion. I typically crush these pretty quickly, so maybe savor is the wrong word.  Maybe I drink them fast because it has a relatively tame ABV and it's refreshing. Or possibly because I want to hide the evidence as quickly as possible. Either way,  I will continue to enjoy these from time to time."
"Great first sip. After that it really tastes like cough syrup"
""
""
""
""
""
"Anyone that buys a beer that has a fruit in it's name and then complains it just plain ignorant. The label tells you exactly what you're going to taste and for what it is, it's darn good."
"I didn't realize they were doing a collaborations with robitussin. Could not finish it. Gave it to a guy I didn't like."
""
""
""

""
"My favorite Sam Adams. A friend in Michigan told me about this years before I could find it here in the South and it did not disappoint. This a beer for people who say they don't like beer and a nice dessert for beer lovers. It smells as sweet as it tastes but is amazingly fresh! And the sweetness doesn't taste artificial but genuinely seems to come from the cherries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like Sam Adams with Cherry cough syrup poured in it. Not for me."
""
""

"Mouthfeel is average richness but not much else.  IT goes down easy enough but there is not enough here except the cherry flavor.  Sub-par."
""
"I like Sam Adams and have had many beers from them, and I tried this with high expectation as wheat beers are one of my favorite styles and bought a six pack. Smell is cherry cough drops almost and sugary with a little hop and yeast smell. Color is light red maybe almost a darker pink. Head disappears quickly to almost nothing but with lacing. The taste is light medium feel and a sugary artificial cherry flavor to a little bit of hops and then the wheat beer comes through. I forced finished one and later on could not finish the second because the flavor just became unpleasant and ended up dumping the rest."

"Actually like this one unlike many others. The smell and taste is a sweet cherry flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Like most fruit beers, it's OK as a weird change of pace. Curious if you could cook with it - desserts, maybe. Otherwise passable."

"Now keep in mind, I've only drank this warm when I was 17 and we took some from a parent..."

"Ugh. Undrinkable on its own, it really shines when paired with a Guinness or Young's Chocolate stout in a half n half. Try it, you may be surprised. Never drink it alone though. That's a recipe for sadness."

"Of all the wheats I have tried, this one is the only one I'd actually buy a 6-pack of in the summertime.  Maybe it's because I like cherries so much, I don't know.  But this one was quite enjoyable."

"Too much cherry flavor and too filling--not a sessionable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has to be the worst fruit beer I've ever had. totally unbalanced. Very tart to begin with but soon over powered by the excessive hop bitterness.  I do not like bitter things. It may be a fruit beer for hopheads but I'll be pouring the second bottle down the sink. I don't dislike anyone enough to give it to them."

"Overall: I have a few other miscellaneous Samuel Adams offerings lurking in my fridge that I can't wait to try, but I really enjoy this beer all around, from its unexpectedly different appearance to the taste it leaves in your mouth after you've finished it."

"Poured a cloudy golden color with a slight reddish tint and three fingers of fluffy white head that slowly receded to a thin cap of foam leaving moderate lacing down the glass. Quite nice looking. Scents of cherries, a bit of cream, not much else. A simple, fruity aroma. Flavor is rather subdued, but pleasant, beginning with cherry with a faint medicinal hop undertone. In the middle wheat malt graininess joins the profile and hop flavors are grassy and slightly medicinal. Finish is sweet with notes of cherry and low levels of grassy hop bitterness. Aftertaste is grassy hops and grainy malt. A nicely fruity, fairly refreshing wheat beer flavor profile. Mouthfeel is creamy with moderate carbonation and a slight acidity on the finish. Refreshing and quite easy to drink. Overall this is a fairly nice pale wheat with a nice refreshing, fairly simple, flavor profile."

"DATE REVIEWED: June 13, 2014... GLASSWARE: Lindemans flute... OCCASION: post-baseball banquet unwinding...APPEARANCE: hazy, cloudy off-yellow body; slight effervescence; nice, thick, somewhat rocky snow white head; reasonable, patterned lacing... AROMA: tart punch of cherries, yes--slightly malty, bready scents underscore the equally understated hops--but mostly, cherries... PALATE: medium-bodied, fizzy, carbonated--not as refreshing as expected, but more body too... TASTE: malt profile disrupts the cherry prominence, as does the honey which forms a funky, unsettled finish...some cardboard notes further damn the experience... OVERALLL: things were going well for this wheat--which is much better than Sam's cherry lambic--until I actually tasted it: a medicinal introduction, a drag of an aftertaste, and not really much to savor in between...."

"This beer at first sip taste a little bitter, like cough medicine, but it goes away almost immediately and as one continues to drink it, it tastes smooth and refreshing. I don't think it is a beer that will appeal to everyone since one has to get used to the taste, but it is a good beer overall, and although it is not a style that I purchase too often, I do buy the ""cherry wheat"" every once in a while for a different taste."

"The obvious and must abundant ingredient it the Cherry flavoring. I enjoy a little bit of fruity taste in beers. After my initial taste I could also detect a small trace of honey in the recipe that really made for a smooth blend that was light and crisp."

"Cherry Wheat is in my top ten of Samuel Adams brews. Has good flavor, not over-powering. Great wheat flavor. Not too filling. Has decent cherry aroma, with slight wheat aroma. Too low of alcohol content for me. When I have a beer, I like some what of a kick. Cherry Wheat did not have much of one. To sum it up, I'll probably drink it again if offered, but not too often or any time in the near future."

"A decent tasting wheat. Very refreshing. You can definitely taste the cherry but it over powers the wheat flavor just a hair to much for me. Little to no head. Has a very good smell, you can really smell the cherry. A solid wheat beer but not my favorite of the style either. Would be great on a warm day."
""
""
"overall: Extremely unique, definitely a session beer, delicious, but would like to taste more malt."

"Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat ---3/5."
""

""
""
""
""
" Pours a light golden hazy amber in color with a good 2-finger white head that settles down to a thin layer on top. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip.. When first opened, the smell of cherries and wheat hits you right in the face, or actually nose. The taste doesn't live up quite to the aroma but is very pleasant overall. Smooth to drink with no bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat Pours out with a small white head. You can tell it's a non filtered brew. The Color is a dark amber. Smell right off the bat is Cherry. There is really nothing else to it I can't smell anything else. The taste is also cherry nothing more than that. Not much else to say but CHERRY. If you like cherry you may like this brew. This brew is not for me. It looks good but the taste is too much."

"Blech. Fruit beers just aren't for me. However, my husband loves the crap out of this beer. To me, this tastes like a mix of bad cherry candy or cough medicine, mixed with a decent wheat beer. If the cherry flavor was a bit more subtle, I think I'd like it a lot better."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle with a clear golden color and a nice white foam head. Aroma is distinctly cherry. The mix of wheat and cherry makes for an enjoyable flavor. I’ve had some beers where the fruity flavor ruins it, but there’s just the right balance of cherry and wheat beer in this brew."

"I was disappointed with the appearance. Was hoping for at least a reddish tint. The smell was redeeming, smell of natural cherry. Taste is a nice cherry at first but the wheat takes over and is overpowering. Mouthfeel is great. Perfect amount of carbonation. Not a fan, would not recommend."
"If you don't like cherries and still want to give this a try... Don't."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A good dessert beer. The wheat character isn't quite what I would like, but it overall is still pretty good. Would also prefer if it was unfiltered, maybe more like a cherry hefeweizen."

"I was never a beer drinker until my boyfriend introduced me to Cherry Wheat. This is the best beer I've ever tasted! I would say that compared to other beers that this has a very smooth taste with subtle hints of summer and an introduction to fall all mixed into one. It smells fruity but still has that distinctive smell of beer with the presence of hops giving it a rustic feel. I am now hooked on Sam Adams! Shame on me for not getting more interested in beer in college!"

"Pours a light amber with a nice head and lasting lacing. Wonderful nose of cherry. Light medium body with a smooth feel. Low average carbonation. Crisp with a good burst of cherry flavor. Lightly hopped as it should be. My SA favorite and one of the reasons I started homebrewing. I've been drinking this beer since 1995. When you get a good bottle (very crisp finish and tart cherry flavor), this one is hard to beat. However, over the years, they have had quality problems. The last few years they have been more consistent."

"I honestly cannot understand the widespread appeal of this. In the same manner of Twizzlers and cough syrup, this is far to sweet and cloying under longterm consumption. There's not much balance to this, and while this *could* be refreshing, it would have to be pounded to avoid the cloying sweetness from creeping up to room temperature. Really weird stuff - I actually love cherries (and krieks, even those that are sweetened), but rather than being dessert-like or robust, this tastes unusually artificial and candied. I might as well get a cheap wheat beer and fill it with homemade cherry syrup (in the same vein of Berliner Weisses). I'm starting to wonder by now if ANY wheat beer infused with fruit flavoring is worth my time. We shall see, until my palate gives up."

"I used to really like this stuff when I first started drinking beer...not so much now."
""

"O - The appearance and smell are extremely deceptive. The taste just does not stand up to expectations. I had a hard time making it through one bottle, and couldn't even think about a whole six pack. I've had some wonderful tart cherry beers, but this one just doesn't work. They should have made it a Berliner weisse. It may have been a little more tart then, but at least it would have a clean, refreshing flavor. I usually rate Sam Adams in the upper end of mediocre, sometimes above, but this is a definite flop."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes of tart cherry and sourdough bread. A little off putting and first drink felt chalky in my mouth. I really like cherries but this was hard to finish and I can't really put my finger on why. This beer is not terrible, and I will probably give it another try sometime, but cannot honestly say it will be anytime soon."

"This beer smells delicious. Very strong scent of cherries and very strong taste of cherries. Quite refreshing but a little overpowering at times. The only thing that is not satisfactory is that the beer stains the lines at bars and whatever is put on after the Cherry Wheat ends up having a faint(old) taste of cherries. The cherry taste is delightful but a bit too boastful."

"This is not beer. This is why I can't buy Sam Adams' variety packs. I always end up with 3 of these nasty bastards. Sorry for that profanity...but it is appropriate here. Don't waste your money, even if you your looking for something that's a flavored brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: still tastes the same after all these years - amazing!....I loathe to admit it, but it's not all that bad a brew.... quirky and gimmicky - yes.... but, despite the quasi-artificiality of the cherry flavor, the balance and flavor profile is quite fine and, I dare say, I could have another...Lord knows, I downed a six pack just about day before noon on that spring break...."

"Poured this Cherry Wheat Beer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy golden color, produced a small white head, average retention and an ample amount of lacing was left on the glass. The aroma consisted of soft wheat and maraschino cherries.- Aroma is outstanding. Light in body, the foundation contained malted wheat and tart cherries. For a fruit beer, crisp, refreshing and a nice session beer."

"Buuuh. Save yourself the trouble with this one. The cherry is just way too overdone and overpowering, nearly to the point of being undrinkable. And it's not the ""fruit-lambic"" kind of cherry. It's more of a ""take your medicine"" kind of cherry. Definitely not for me."

"O- Way to sweet for my taste buds, but I might have found a beer my girlfriend would like! Seems way to sweet for a cherry wheat as if it’s jam packed with cherry artificial flavors rather than the natural tartness I was looking for."

"Poured into standard beer glass, light head, and light amber color. Excellent aroma, refreshing and flavorful. Taste is just like the smell, great wheat base with the crisp cherry notes. The perfect ratio of beer to cherry, not to much, not to little. A great beer to have year round."

"This beer is amazing. The flavor is very sweet which I don't usually enjoy, but in this case it seems to be done wonderfully. I had it on tap, into a pint glass and it was one of the better beers I have ever had. The appearance is like a light weizen, not red like I expected. The smell is beautiful with a bright cherry scent. The taste is brilliant cherry - as I said sweet, but not overbearing. The mouthfeel is nothing special, not bad, but nothing to write home about - definitely nothing left over but a great taste. Overall, I highly recommend it - even for a flavored beer."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a hazy light golden amber with a fine, thin white head and light lacing. Aroma dominated by cherry juice, wheat and a hint of biscuit malt. Flavor is light wheat, bready malt and cherry juice. Cherry is not as dominating as in the aroma. Finishes dry with light hops and sour cherry, slightly astringent. Nice medium body; surprising light creaminess for a low ABV wheat beer. I liked this better than I thought I would, the initial flavor is well balanced and different. Finish is a bit unbalanced and sharp. Interesting."

"If the cherry flavor wasn't quite as medicinal, this wouldn't be a bad light beer at all. With each sip the fruit flavor just seems to feel more and more fake."
""

"The beer pours a surprisingly yellow with only a slight oranging to suggest the cherries. I sits in the glass as a murky gold with some nice bubbles of carbonation. The beer pours with a nice white head but this mellows down into just a scrim, though it does regenerate when agitated. Lacing for this beer is negligible. The beer smells like cherry coke. The cherry is far too sweet and cloying for natural cherries, but reminds me of a maraschino cherry, which is a nice smell. I’m not expecting this to be the most natural beer, but the candied smell is definitely intriguing. The malt body, hops, and yeast are all overpowered by the cherries except for the smallest ghost of a suggestion of biscuitiness. The beer tastes like a bready cherry cola. The aftertaste is well built with buttery biscuit and only a faint cherry sweet that goes slightly vegetal. The initial sip, however, was heavy with sweet cherries, though the very initial taste is surprisingly heavy with the biscuit malts, but the cherries quickly wash them away to suggest cherry cola. Mouthfeel is a little prickly with the carbonation, leaving a slight tingle, but thick and creamy in the initial sip which that mellows into a watery feeling. The mouth is left with the cloying feel of sweet cherries but little of the flavor and a slight dry burn on the back of the tongue which tingles beneath the light trickle of saliva your mouth works up. Overall this is a strange beer. Its smell and flavor are actually quite good, but the mouthfeel really pulls it back in scoring. It is actually quite good for what the company was going for, as this is a refreshing and tasty fruit beer that is easily mass produced. I compare this more to a cherry cola than to a beer, and I really wouldn’t drink a lot of these due to their cloying nature but one on a hot summer day is not a bad thing to sip when you are looking for something a little different."

"Poured hazy gold with a small white head with minimal lacing. Aroma was cherry and bread. Taste was cherry (surpise!) up front and strong with some grain, and an acidic/metallic flavor. The beer finished with a cherry flavor lingering for quite a while. I like cherry, so I thought it was pretty good and would drink again."

"I am going to ignore the mostly poor ratings by others, although I admit to be a beer taste rookie. I really like this beer, but I am a fan of cherry flavor (Cherry Coke, Dr. Pepper, etc.) as well as wheat beer in general. I found the amount of cherry just right though the mouthfeel was a bit heavy. I'd definitely buy it again."
""

"Pours a clear light reddish-orange with a foamy tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of wheat, grain, and some artificial cherry aromas. Taste is much the same with an almost sickening medicinal cherry flavor that lingers long after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a poor beer that is pretty gross and undrinkable."

"Surprising cherry smell, it was completely unexpected. By far the best Sam Adams I've had. I like the slightly reddish tinge to the dark colored beer and it poured a good head. Overall, I was pleased and would definitely spend some change to have this beer in my fridge again."

"Had this on tap at Atlanta airport. Nice presentation with an interesting amber clouded clour. Adequate 1+ finger white head that stuck around a bit. Smell was a bit of some dulled cherries and some yeast. Nothing remarkable. Taste was pretty decent. I will preface this by saying I grew up on Michigan cherries and enjoy that tart over the top taste. That being said, I didn't get the medicine taste as others have pointed out. A definite fruit beer that IMO is a good combination and quite drinkable. Feel was a good bit of carbonation and medium body. Overall- I think it a pretty good effort from SA. I like the tartness and blend of the hops that evident. Probably need to really enjoy cherries for this one to go down smoothly. An interesting blend that I would drink again-"

"So, all in all, not bad, and if fruit beer is your thing, go for it. If you're a strictly beer or malty, bready type like me who prefers that a hop or fruit overload stay out of his mug or growler (or even a single/double/triple IPA guy who would eat a handful of hop flowers on his own free will), reach for another beer at the 7-11. This one is too much fruit, not enough beer."

"A very interesting beer. I recommend you try this out. As much as people seem to dislike this beer (A 70 rating on this site for a Sam Adams' beer is really quite low), I have a feeling this is one of their top sellers. I don't KNOW that, I'm just taking a guess... I feel it's super popular among women. I could be wrong though."

"Cherry wheat should have been tasty, instead it tastes a little bit like medicine beer. Medicine like the liquid stuff my mom used to feed me when I was a kid. Once you get passed that odd taste, the rest of it isn't so bad. Maybe I just have some sort of bad association with that particular flavor."

"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a murky gold with a one finger head, Leaving no lacing. The smell is of faint cherries and Robitussin. Nothing else. The taste is of cherries, And somewhat of light toasted barley and malt. Absolutely nothing else. The mouthfeel allows the complete medicinal flavor to come through, Seriously tasted like Robitussin Nighttime if you let it sit for long enough. Oh well, I didn't pay for it so whatever. A terrible offering by Sam Adams, Even worse than the Summer Ale."
""

"Just wow. I picked up a mixed pack and this was the worst of the bunch."
"This is incredibly pleasant, despite the fact that it makes little celebration of hops and malt. I think this is meant as a tool to get people interested in different beers. For that, I like it. It's a bit one-dimensional, but tasty indeed. It might be fun to cook with this. Hey! It's in a SUMMER pack, after all! Lighten up."

"Great Fruit Beer. I keep buying this without the intent of getting it because I like to try many different brews. But for some reason, I really enjoy this beer. To me, its got a great summer cherry, nutty flavor that goes down easy and smooth. Great brew while cutting the grass or working in the garage etc... I like it."
""
""
""
""
"O - I feel this is a really good cherry beer, a little heavy handed in the aroma but a great flavor profile. Like many of their beers, a bit too much carbonation. Nice to have if you are in the mood for a fruity beer."
""

"these are unkind reviews. this is actually a pretty damn good fruit beer. it pours rather plain looking very clear golden color with a small white head. smells like fresh black cherries, floral and juicy, with plenty of wheat malts and a fairly mild yeast strain. flavor is major cherry all the way through. not dissimilar to the cherry vanilla yogurts ive seen around in the groceries. its got that sort of sweet fresh fruit element that i really like, it bitters for a second and then rounds out at the end. id like so see a more funky yeast get into the mix, saison style or something, i think that would give this beer a real kick in the crotch, but its tasty as it is in my opinion. feel is light and gassy, good in summer and also with a certain holiday appeal."
""
""
"Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat is a refreshing brew and it makes a good choice for a hot summer day. I know that some will be turned off by the fruitiness and while I generally do not go for fruit beers myself, I find the medium body and tartness sufficient to enjoy this beer and recommend it for your next encounter with hot weather."

"The beer pours a hazy golden orange color with a white head. The aroma has a bit of wheat, but what really comes through strongly is a ton of syrupy cherry notes.

"Overall I don't like this beer and I thought that is was an average example of a Cherry Wheat beer, I can see why some people like it but to me not enough good beer qualitys shine through. This beer doesn't have good drinkability, not that smooth with the high sweetness and medicinal flavors, one is more then enough for me, there's no way I would want another. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, if looked pretty nice and had some good head retention along with a nice color. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness and the artificial cherrys in the flavor and aroma, to me they hurt this beer and were not enjoyable. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own and I hate when they throw this in their variety packs, when they do it's always my least favorite of the pack, I don't recommend this beer, there's much better fruit beers out there. I wasn't impressed with this beer and never have been, but for some reason this beer appeals to a lot of people so there's no chance of it changing anytime soon. If I am in the mood for a fruit beer, I would much rather have a Short's Soft Parade, I think it's a far superior beer. This beer just isn't for me, hope the next one I try from you guys is much better."

"I cant really get down with the taste unless Im in the mood for it.Its a light American Wheat base, but damn its got cough syrup cherry flavors everywhere. It gets more balanced as I drink it. I get more adjunct (corn) grains and less of that cherry flavor, but that cough syrup cherry flavor still stays at the forefront."

It’s one of the weaker beers in the Sam Adams catalogue, but definitely still drinkable."

"Cloudy overall with a nice head in my weiss glass. Decent lacing with a lingering cover of white foam. Smell is very cherry with light wheat malt twang and a touch of breadiness. Taste is not bad with a strong dose of cherries and mild bitterness, a touch of a metallic edge that lingers in the finish . Feel is light with a nice amount of carbonation and quenching dryness. Overall a decent beer. If you like cherry flavors this is better than decent. It brings the taste and drinkability of a good summer quaffer with the cherries driving the beer bus. Worth a try either way as it kinda grows on you if you like wheat styles like hefe or wit."
"Overall - A simple cherry beer. If you like cherries, you'll at least like it. If not, then probably best to avoid. It's nothing special, but I do dig the flavor."

Also, don't drink this if you don't like your beers a little on the sweet side... And that's an understatement. It might get low ratings, but I for one enjoyed it.

I'm not usually a huge fan of fruit beers, however there are a few good ones out there. The Cherry Wheat unfortunately is not one of those. It is not terrible, it is decently sessionable, but definitely not a beer I would drink a lot."

"This is a unique beer and the first of its style for me. It smells very strongly of black cherries, it really dominates on the nose but you can pick up other smells like brown sugar. It drinks just as it smells, black cherries. The taste isn't as strong as the smell but the cherry flavor is still dominant. It also has some light grain and wheat flavors. This beer has a surprisingly full mouth feel, its not the ideal beer to drink a lot of but the texture is all there. It has a dry and cherry flavored aftertaste which is really take it or leave it to me. This is a decent offering from Sam Adams, certainly not their flagship beer. Its decent for what it is and is good enough to spark some interest in the style for me."

"Overall I think the thing that really made me not care for this beer is it got progressively worse as I made it through my glass, almost to the point where I didn't want to finish it. I thought the execution was poor, but it was interesting to see what they were getting at."

"Pours out a hazy golden orange color with a single finger of white fluff for a head, smells of tart fresh black cherries, almonds, and light amounts of wheat. Flavor contains more of the same as the nose, but also a faint finish of herbal hopping at the very end. Body is somewhat thin but carbonation is alright. The main flaw in this beer that I can pick out is that the cherries are right up on the edge of getting too cloying sweet / cough syrup in nature..."

"It's not world-class, but it's certainly refreshing. I could drink a few of these on a summer day and be plenty happy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Kind of underwhelming. No need to avoid it, and if this kind of thing appeals to you I imagine it could be somebody's favorite. Definitely not mine. I wish it was better because I love fruit beers and wheat beers - this should have been a slam dunk. Oh well."

"Thoughts: While I am generally not a big Samuel Adams fan, I have been trying these out of respect to my fellow connoisseurs. So say this is one of the best, other wont touch it. As I do BBQ using a cherry wood, this helped bring the taste out a bit more. Nice combo..."

"O: This is a decent fruit beer, but I don't feel that it pulls everything together. The brewers at the Boston Beer Company really should have used fresh cherries only, and not included natural flavorings in this brew, as it could benefit greatly from the melding of cherry and wheat tartness that would likely result. As is, it's just a tad too sweet, and the natural grainy tartness of the wheat clashes with the sweetness of the cherries and cherry flavoring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good beer, though it's hard for me to call it that. It seems like a cherry-flavored mixed drink with bread. It's something I'll remember to pick up in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-If I had this blind I might doubt that it was beer, not a good beer, because it is more like a fizzy alcoholic beverage that the ladies like to down."

"Bottle poured into tulip glass a light golden hue with a small creamy head. Smell was distinctly wheat malt with a dry tone. Very drinkable with a nice cherry twinge in the back. Smooth on the palate and goes down well. I have already gone thru a couple of cases of this in the past few months."

"When opening the bottle you really get a strong cherry scent which was somewhat misleading because the cherry flavor is not very strong. Color-wise, it a standard wheat beer color with a slightly redish hue. I really like this beer for the fall/winter."
""
""
"O-this is average. Maybe if I was a cherry person I would say different. I am being generous due to me not liking cherries. Pretty light beer. I will say they did a very good job of making a fruit beer though. One of the better ones I have had in the sense of blending the flavor with beer. Most the time it seems to taste artificial, or not mix well, or not have much of the fruit flavor."

"The beer looks good. It leaves a fair amount of lacing and foam at the top, and lots of little bubbles rise to the top. The bubbles are hard to make out because the beer is opaque which is surprising because of how light gold the color is. The smell is unlike anything I've had in a beer before. It's crisp, light and hoppy, but the biggest characteristic is the cherry sweet smell like juice, but it isn't a dark cherry. More like rainier cherries. The taste is pretty simple. There is malt-cherry sweetness and the other taste associated with cherries: a tart quality. It's a very accurate, and rich cherry taste (like cherry pie or cherry liquor) and not at all like a artificial/candied flavor. Extra points for nailing the ""cherry"" part of the beer, although the beer gets sour the warmer it gets. The mouthfeel is above average. Smooth enough, but the beer really is as light as it looks."
""
""
"Look, it's not stellar, but I don't know why so many are hating on this beer. It's not like they gave up on the beer aspects and just went for gobs of cherry."

"O- If I had no taste buds this would be a wonderful beer. Great smells and mouthfeel to it, but I cannot get over that medicinal taste. Take a halls cherry cough drop and remove the menthol part of it and you come out with this beer."

"Overall: An alright beer, not something that I'd seek out again, but if offered I wouldn't turn it down."
"O: good beer to get those malt drinkers over to the beer side, yet I would still have it again."
"This isn't a bad beer, but it's syrupy and medicinal at times. The cherry flavor is faint, and overall, this is a one dimensional, easy drinker."
"Overall: I was not a fan of this. Its tough to make a good fruit wheat beer, and still every brewery thinks they can do it. This is pretty rough stuff and lacks the balance that Sam Adams usually gets down."
"O: Not the most complex of beers but I thought it was pretty refreshing and enjoyable. Would drink again in the summer."
"Overall - This is my first ""fruity"" beer that I've had and I have to say it's not too bad. Seeing previous reviews I expected this to taste like cough syrup like I had previously seen but the cherry flavor is quite tame compared to the expectations I had for this beer, but in a goof way. Pretty drinkable beer overall."
"As far as Sam's offerings, most if not all are fantastic. Cranberry Lambic is by far their worst beer, but the cherry comes in a close second. I wouldn't seek it out again."
"My bestfriend went on a Sam Adams binge and bought this beer. I poured this beer into a glass and looked like your average beer. The smell was very nice with some cherry and some malt. The taste on the other hand was rough. It had a lot of cherry and just seemed like cherry soup to me. I cant think of anything good to say about the taste. The mouthfeel was average and overall I think this beer is below average. I just dont know what to say...."
"Overall, as a fruit beer, this is a C+. As a wheat beer, this is actually a B. What can I say, I'm a sucker for fruit beers!"
"Local Meijer Grocery Store carrying a six of Cherry Wheat....WHAT!!! Gots to try that. The appearance is a clear light amber with reddish hues. There is a thin white head with little foam remains, with active bubbles. The smell is a robust cherry smell that is fantastic. There is a distinct Sammy A taste to every beer...this one has a cherry, wheaty malt twang. The mouthefeel is ok...I think more than one is tough due to the sweet Cherryiness to it. Overall good beer, especially for the summer."
"This is definitely a unique flavor that seems very challenging to perfect, but I feel like a small down-tone of the cherry would make it almost too good. I would definitely recommend this for a unique taste, but there are definitely other ""unique"" brews out there that are more worth your try."
"It wavers kind of sickeningly between confection and medicine - after a few too many sips, I couldn't finish it."
"Dr: Average ABV and easy drinkability make this well-priced beer one to try, but its lack of complexity holds it back."
"When i saw this beer i had to try it.I drank this straight from the bottle , but did check its color , which was a light red. The smell was good , and was acually the best part about this beer. I couldn't stop smelling it, becuase i was impressed with how ""cherry"" it was. Not much of a mouthfeel , a little watered down for me. Taste was great at first, because cherry's are good , but it quicky got old.Just way to sweet , no balance at all , after taste was of sweet cherrys , would have liked a tart cherry after taste."
"uh.. i'm drawing a blank.. look, smell, taste... what else is there?.. oh right, mouthfeel: uh, feels bubbly and full of flavors.. in my mouth"
"O: Not impressed, maybe I let this bottle sit too long, or maybe I didn't get the best batch, either way, either way this is a brew I didn't really enjoy. The flavors are nice and pronounced, and the cherries do an adequate job as a hop substitute, but It was one I didn't really enjoy, the flavors were rather balanced and I did enjoy the aroma, but all in all this was a pretty average beer at best."
"{re-visited in May 2014}"
"Pours an orange/amber with a thin, wispy, white head. Smells of almond paste and sweet cherries with a bit of crisp, lemony wheat in the background. Tastes sweet and quite almondy with sweet cherries following and the same lemony wheat. A hot of sweet cherry liqueur on the finish. There is a bit of tartness to check the sweetness, but no denying that this is a sweet beer. I like this a bit more than most, but I can have a sweet tooth at times."
"This is one to serve to friends , family, colleauges, strangers!"
"O: I’m surprised this ranked so low, I thought it was rather enjoyable and refreshing. With that being said, I could only drink this once in a while. But it was nice to try something different for a change."
"O-Decent summer refresher that is easily found. I found it drinkable enough to get another six."
"O - If you can get past the aftertaste, this would be a nice beer to enjoy on a summer day. I found it pretty refreshing."
"Overall - Had high hopes for this beer, because I like a good sweet fruit beer once in a while. But this was just dry, astringent, and kinda weird. I can imagine it might go good with specific food pairings, but doesn't stand on its own as a straightforward beer."
"Overall – I actually kind of enjoyed my first few sips, but the taste started to become too sweet and artificial after a while. It's not undrinkable, it's just not something that I would go out of my way to have again."
"O - Flavour as advertized, a pleasant summer sipper, glad I came across this by chance in an airport lounge"
"O/D-I flat out do not like this beer's artificial, cloying flavor. Had to try it once. I actually think I may regret it. I am not sure if I have said that before."
"Appearance is a hazy orange gold with a thin crisp head leaving spotty lace. Smell has a dominant maraschino cherry aroma or even a cherry coke. Taste again of cherry coke or cherry cream soda with wheat as the backbone. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Not bad brew if you like cherry coke."
"Pours lightly cloudy and has a sweet and tart flavor. This is one of the better fruit veggie beers that is not overly sweet or tart. This beer maintains a smoothness and has a slight hop flavor. But definitly will not give you a great name for having street cred."
"Good for summer activities."
"overall, this beer catches a lot of flak, but to me it's a reasonably enjoyable fruit beer. maybe i'm biased from cherry wheat being an old favorite, and while i wouldn't drink more than one or two in a sitting, i find it relatively tasty and refreshing - a decent summer brew."
"Overall good beer, especially for the summer."
"Pours a clear bronzed yellow with a finger of delicate white bubbles for a head, which dissipates quickly. Scent of bitterness and maraschino cherries. Wheat and more cherries in the taste, with a touch of honey. Cherries aren't too overpowering. Can be a tad harsh and acidic, but overall not too bad. Light-medium mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable."
"O: I had this beer about ten years ago and remember not liking it then, looks like my tastes haven't changed."
"O: This served as a gateway craft brew for me a few years ago and it was nice to revisit. Don't understand why so many hate on the cherry flavors in CHERRY wheat. I didn't think the problem is authenticity so much as the lack of balance makes the cherries overpowering and extract-like. Average beer recommended for sessions or begginners."
"Very disappointed with Boston Brewing comp."
"mouthfeel: its like eating jolly ranchers till you die."
"This was not good. It poured a cloudy pale yellow. Smelled vaguely of wheat, no cherry scent. It tasted manufactured, artificial. Not the worst I have had, but this one needs to be worked on. Mouthfeel was grainy? not the best. Overall, one should expect more from Jim."
"O:This beer has good color and aroma but lacks the impressionable taste and feel to go with it making this beer good if you liked flavored beers but nothing special to try if you don’t."
"Overall / Drinkability: No, I don't see myself having this again. Too much like a cherry, um..., well, it's not a beer. I can't put my finger on it exactly. It sort of looks like one, but doesn't smell, taste, or feel like one. A weird beer and I'm not sure that I like it. I'll stick to cherry flavor well blended into a Belgian or into a cobbler or pie - not as this beer. Oh well - not everything can be great."
"O. Overall I am no longer as interested in this beer as I have been in the past. It's rather light and the flavor slips away as quickly as you can swallow it, leaving no real impressive aftertaste. Would make a decent session ale if the cherry flavor were more authentic and the ABV went down one point. As it is, it can be enjoyed in multitude on a hot day if you're not overly discerning with your taste and you have a decent tolerance."
"A little too cherry and quite filtered, but it's worth a shot...seriously, it was immensely quafable while taking a hot shower!"
"D - Well, it tastes like cherry, but it thoroughly proves that such a flavor does not have to be a good thing. It seems like a generic American wheat beer with cough syrup added for depth. It tastes very medicinal and the phenolic cherry is impossible to ignore. Just bad, I can't imagine why they would keep brewing this... really."
"O: Overall I would not buy this beer or go out of my way to drink it again. I have not had many cherry wheats, and do not really know how to compare this to other cherry wheats, but in general I think this is an average beer."
"Aroma is full of cherries....but not medicinal, but more like the cherries in a can that you use to make a quick cherry pie. Actually, this is just like a cherry coffee cake, with loads of vanilla and cake aroma. Taste does not taste very wheat-like. Light, pils-like malts and slightly tart cherry, and a touch of pale malt. Mouthfeel is very light-bodied, sweet and sour on the palate. Not a bad sessionable beer, but too heavy in cherry."
"The cherry wheat is exactly what it is advertized as, a beer that has the flavor and aroma of cherries. I was surprised by the beer, however, i am not a fan of cherries and could have done without sampling this beer. I would recommended the beer to fans of cherries."
"Hazy straw color with bubbly white head that fades fast. Sweet aroma of cherry purée, candied syrup, and subtle wheat. Tastes of unripe cherries, wheat, subtle light fruit juice, some fruity artificial flavors that linger on the palate. Light body with high carbonation. Focuses on cherries but without a solid backbone of a wheat beer. Tastes artificial and cheap."
"Not a bad fruit beer. It's a nice summer beer for sure. Smell of sweet cherries is definitely the highlight here."
"Most days I'd give two Schlitz for Sam Adams Cherry Wheat."
"O - This is the kind of beer that makes me wonder how many people actually like it. Apparently, this is popular among college girls and yuppies... Well then, it's got a right to exist, but as for me, I've definitely had better fruit wheat beers..."
"Overall - Probably not a beer I will be revisiting, but given the flavor profile I'm sure there are those that will really enjoy it."
"I always get giddy when I see these hit the shelves. If you are a cherry and beer lover then this is a perfect match for you. If you don't like cherries then don't even bother with this, plain and simple. This beer is not as bad as people are making it out to be."
"I've been ragged-on recently, but I will continue to force-pronounce the ""h" in ""wheat"". Think Stewie Griffin and Cool Whip... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of solid white foam. The nose tries to hint at a bit of dry wheat, but things are thoroughly dominated by a half-medicinal, half-artificial cherry smell. Not exactly my bowl o' fruit, so to speak. The taste intimates toward a wheat-y revolution, but the malevolent iron fist of the cherry junta maintains a constant vigil, keeping any subversive characters under an ever-present threat of violent reprisal. Worse, a mineral-y, tinny flavor caps things off at the finish. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a decided miss. the cherry character just doesn't work at all. 'Nuff said."
"This beer is pretty fruity, but is still really good! It seems like a great summer beer, something I would like to drink while just relaxing. Obviously it's not the most manly of beverages, but another great beer from Sam Adams in my opinion; in fact one of their best seasonal beers"
"Any relation to 7-Up ends at the taste. It's buttery with a very unsatisfying bitterness in the aftertaste. Bready with a hint of hay and salt-less saltines. Reminds me of the crackers you get at communion, bland and tasteless. All of it is over powered by an artificial cherry flavor. Judging by the color, I'm guessing they use extract. Might make more sense to have a cherry beer that is actually red or reddish."
"This was very disappointing for a samuel adams beer, and maybe my expectations were too high. I do feel I'm echoing other people's thoughts though, it's not a good beer. It have a terrible robitussin taste at first, though it improves as I drink it. It is a thin beer and whatever hops or wheat that was used in the brewing process is absolutely shadowed by intense cherry flavor."
"I would probably pass on this beer if ever offered again. Not worth getting one for free."
"Thin mouthfeel."
"Cherry Wharton has got to be one of my 5 top Sam Adams releases. This beer is really great on it's own or as a dessert after a meal. The beer is on the lighter side, the color is golden. The head sticks around for a bit. The cherry flavor is super sweet in the beginning but trails off near the end when your taste buds are getting used to it. The aroma of this beer is wonderful. This beer is great if your just having one. If you start to have two or three back to back it starts to lose it's intensity. Very good though!"
"Overall/Drinkability: This is a beer that I will drink again."
"Well, the tap SAID cherry wheat, but alas, the cherry is CHERRY and the wheat is, well, um...well, just not there. I like lambics very much, and I like fruit beers overall; but I wanted something more from this one. Looked nice (20 oz draft at Chili's) and went down as smooth as you could possibly ask for, but the cherry was a bit over the top. My daughter dipped her finger in and said ""UMMM", right before she attacked the chocolate molten lave cake, so you know where her head was at and how this beer fit right into it. After a few first sips, I thought this might be a good session beer, as I was watching some March Madness, but the fruitiness might disallow this."
"D: I would definitely buy this again if I was in the mood for a cherry beer. This is a once in awhile specialty though. I couldn't drink more than one in a day though because they are just so overwhelmingly cherry and your taste buds just get overworked."
"D: The beer is easy to drink but there's no way that I would have more than one of these at a time because the smell and taste are both one-dimensional."
"Poured amber-orange in color with a small fizzy head that dissapated rapidly with nice lacing. The aroma was overwhelming with cherries and a hint of sweet yeast. It tasted sweet with a very strong cherry flavor. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture. Overall nothing special, nice on a hot summer day."
"Unfortunately this wasn't what I would expect for a cherry wheat - maybe just a hint of cherry would tone it down and bring more of a wheat taste overall."
"I realize that fruit beers seem to be a very polarizing style. I enjoy them, but not with a flavor this overwhelming. I could barely stomach a glass but if you prefer a fruit beer with intense, in your face flavor this may be right up your alley."
"Poured bottle into a pint glass. Nice amber color, showing obvious signs of a fruit beer. Sweet smell, but not over the top. Head fizzles down quick. A real easy drinking beer, that seems to lack the carbonation of most beers. Pretty good out of a bottle, but better off a tap. This is a beer that goes well with a salty snack (wings or pizza). Easy to drink a few."
"D-Too one diminesional with the cherry. That really brings it down."
"All in all this is one of the better fruit beers I have tried, and I usually pick up a case of these on a nice hot summer day."
"D-This is very drinkable if you love cherries. I like cheeries but don't love them. With this had alittle more boozey flavor. Overall a good beer but too much cheerieness"
"Nice drinking beer with a steak on the grill."
"D: Hmmm...again, at first it was very enjoyable but there is definitely something in the aftertaste I am not ecstatic about. Good, I think but not something I'd go after again or drink more than one of at a time."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. For how light this beer is, it is actually pretty filling and it took me a while to finish. The cherry flavor is refreshing at the start but turns a bit for the worse as it warms."
"It is probably the amount of (cherry wheat flavoring ) that is in the beer. If it was a bit lighter then it might be improved."
"Despite the gripes, it's drinkable enough for me, as I like cherry and I feel like the cherry here is natural-tasting enough. It's the other traits that bother me. This really drinks more like a soda than beer."
"Overall not one of the favorite offerings from Sam Adams, but a decent beer that I come back to every now and then when looking for a fruity beer"
"D: I guess I wouldn't be pounding down a 12 pack of this, but it's not a bad beer to have once every so often."
"From random notes: Pours a slightly hazy dark golden with a small but lasting white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma of cherry cough syrup and light notes of wheat. Taste is the same as aroma. Medium thin mouthfeel with a mild amount of bitterness. Like drinking watered down cherry cough syrup. Not a good beer for me."
"This was my last Cherry Wheat left, and probably will be the last one that I'll have for quite a while. This has been a beer that I have almost always kept on hand, however I think that there are probably better options out there. While I won't be buying anymore in the near future, I certainly wouldn't pass one up if it were available."
"If that cherry ""type"" of smell and taste is your thing you'll love this beer. For me though it isn't that great cause I prefer real fruit taste and this isn't it. But it does have characteristics of a solid wheat ale almost and that makes it at least drinkable."
"Mouthfeel sucks. Just like being forced to take some cough syrup, you scramble for a cup of water to wash your mouth out. I hate this beer. I don't throw around the work hate too often but I hate this beer. Don't ever drink this."
"I'll be the first to admit that fruit beers are not usually my thing so it would be something special for me to want to continue drinking one. I am not sure I could force myself to drink another one of these."
"D- This beer is a little more off putting than great tasting. Alcohol in this is more than enough and lingers well into the aftertaste. The ABV is low enough to enjoy but the alcohol and fake cherry taste I can not get past."
"GRADE: B+/A"
"Verdict: Best taken with a grain of salt... or a basket of cherries, I suppose. Nothing subtle about this beer, it's very straightforward. What you see on the label is what you get in the taste, which is pretty nice if you enjoy predictability. The overall super sweet taste was a turn away for me in addition to the lack of any complexities that might distinguish this beer from... Cherry Coca-cola and some wheat. Don't get me wrong; Definitely worth a go no matter who you are in the beer field, but I found several notable flaws that will make it difficult for me to return to this beer anytime soon. C (2.85)"
"This is a beer that I feel is below me, but it really is good! Sometimes I'll tell myself this beer isn't anything special, but it kind of is. Definitely one of Sam Adams' better year-round offerings."
"The only two good things I can say about this beer are that it has a nice amount of wheat in it and it has a decent color. I hate beers that skimp out on the wheat when they say they are in fact wheat beers. This beer does not skimp out, but that's about all it has going for it. The taste and the smell are just bombarded with cherry's, the taste even more than the smell. It's almost to the point where you don't want to drink it, but at the same time it's just cherry's, so it isn't THAT horrible. It just didn't really taste like much of a beer, more like a cherry soda. Just not a very good beet in my book."
"Honestly, it tastes a lot like a basic lager with cherry juice in it. Not that it is a bad thing, though. It is pretty tasty, even if it is rather simple. It gets my stamp of approval."
"Had this on tap at the Newark airport, waiting for my flight back to Toronto. I knew this didn't have the best ratings, but the other selections were a couple other Sam Adams, plus typical macro lagers. Pours a pinkish-orange colour with thin white head. Smells of very sweet artificial cherry, similar to cherry candy. Some faint wheat aroma is there too. Quite a sweet flavour. Medium body carbonation. Easy to drink beer, just too sweet to have more than one in a row."
"Just a big fan of this one."
" I found Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat tobe a versatile beer. Sweet enough to function as a dessert beer, but enough of all the the other things that make a wheat beer enjoyable!"
"d - Ok but too sweet in the smell and don't like the metal in the taste. Also way too carbonated. Not Sam Adams best work, wouldn't look to have this one again."
"D: Crisp and clean.A great combination of wheat and cherries."
"D: Very drinkable and lower in alcohol. Not a go-to fruit beer but drinkable enough."
"Pours into a golden body with a whit head that has good retention and decent lacing, carbonation is decent in this beer. The smell is a very strong cherry flavor along with some wheat, and yeast. The taste is a strong cherry taste that stays from beginning until the end along with some hints of wheat, yeast, hops, a little citrus, and some banana at the end. It has a creamy smooth mouthfeel with a little stickiness and it is a drinkable beer, but not as drinkable as I'd like it to be since it is a beer that is filling compared to others I recently tried. This is a good beer to check out if your in the mood for a cherry flavored brew."
"** edit - ok , i've had the second bottle at proper temp - only a marginal difference for the better -"
"D: Gets to be too sweet towards the last of the bottle, definitely wouldn't drink more than one in a row. Still a pretty good beer though."
"D - The drinkability is decent. It goes down fairly easy. This is a decent beer, but if I wanted a cherry beer there are a lot of better ones out there to choose from. Worth a try though."
"this drinks pretty good, but it is definatly a chick beer. i, being a guy, still very much so enjoyed this. i dont go out of my way to buy this, but when its offered, i never refuse."
"Beautiful amber color and pours well. Not quite a lambic, but similar. Easily one of the best American flavored beers Ive ever had. Sam Adams comes through yet again. Without a doubt, Boston Beer Co is the best American brewery."
"Drinkability - Despite the cherry flavor it's easy to keep drinking. Great fall beer."
"Quickly one of my favorite fruity beer."
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with a white, short lived head. Aroma is of mostly cherry with some grainy notes. Medium, crisp, creamy body. Flavor is of herbal, earthy hops, cherry and creamy wheat. Hops are actually dominate the palate over cherry. Long, earthy, dry finish. Interesting, somewhat unusual brew."
"Pours a golden/orange hue with a thin short lived white head. Aroma of cherry and slight wheat. Taste is wheat, some malt, a little bitterness. Palate is light body and crisp. Flavor ends with a light malt, light hops and kind of nutty after taste with some lingering cherry taste. Not much else going on here. Overall a ok and refreshing summer beer."
"Usually Sam Adams has quality beer. Thought this beer would be better. Appearance was great. Redish color. Smells nice. Taste like cherry cough medicine. Mouth is about as good as cherry cough medicine. Drinkabilty isn't bad, but could be better if it didn't taste like cough medicine."
"This beer pours a cloudy almost copper color. The moment you open the bottle you smell cherries. The beer tastes of cherries, and a malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is a light almost medium feel to it. I would consider this a very drinkable beer. Almost like a dessert. Very balanced for using fruit."
"Sam Adams seldom disappoints, so this one's a ""can't lose", right? What we have here is a cloudy golden ale with a strong cherry nose -- instantly appealing and unusual. My initial taste revealed, not surprisingly, tart cherries with a smooth honey undertone. Cherry wheat is balanced on the palate, and not too sweet or artificial-tasting (as are so many fruit-infused beers). Enjoyable."
"Not as good to me as their Blackberry offering. Lots of wheat gives way to cherry. However, to me the cherry is a bit overpowering and drowns out other aspects of the beer, at least to my palate. Seems a little thin in the complexity area. Wouldn't hesitate to drink them if offered but would probably seek out something different in the store unless nothing else were available."
"D - Na I will not seek it out but if it was ever in a variety case I would not pass it up. Still it was OK at best."
"A very good and unique offering from Sam Adams that has spawned many imitators. C'mon, try it!"
"D- Crisp and clean. Easy to drink if you like cherries. If you wanted a hint of cherry you will be disappointed. This is cherry with hints of beer. The wheat and cherries are slightly off. The cherry flavor is powerful in this beer. I couldn't finish more than one."
"I like the taste of cherry and taste of wheat beer so this was a must try for me. It pours a cloudy golden color with a heavy smell of delicious cherries. Upon tasting there is first the taste of cherry, not too strong but not too wheat either. I was then left with wheat as an aftertaste. Overall I thought it was very nicely blended and tasted quite nicely."
"D/M: Very crisp carbonation really helps you experience the cherry flavor. It is slightly sweeter and is not necessarily balanced with the malt flavor. But this is a very refreshing beer."
"I'd have this again because, well, I like cherry. IT was interesting to say the least but not in any way offensive."
"Here we go. Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint, it's a hazy honey color with a one and half finger off-white head, tiny bubble rise to support it. Smells of cherry almond paste, tastes of cherry almond paste. It's a marzipan beer. Very interesting. Appealing all around, if you like candy tasting beers. It's nice, a good fruit beer."
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dark cherry, almost like a cough drop. In the taste, dry cherry and wheat notes. A fruity bite and medium to light mouthfeel, with a dry cherry fruitiness in the aftertaste. I think it is like a couple Ludens cough drops dropped in a mediocre wheat beer."
"Big head from this one, a good three fingers of thick very light brown suds. The color of this beer rates a 9 on the SRM Chart. Smells like Marciano cherries. Taste is sweet cherries, wheat, yeast, and malt. Nice present finish, sort of like a gush of filling in the back of my throat. Rich, smooth mouthfeel, like light pudding. This beer has a present flavor, far from the run of the mill beers. Maybe a little too sweet for any heavy drinking, and not real compatible with many food items, but would be good to serve with a desert."
"Pours a light reddish brown color with a bit of an off white head. Nose brings loads of cherries. Seems a bit artificial, but not too much. Taste is some more super-sweet cherries that start to get quite a bit cloying. Light caramel, crusty flavors in the background. Feel is medium with quite a bit of sugar body. Quite cloying, which really affects the drinkability."
"Drinkability- This beer is a good drink on a cold fall day. It is an entertaining experience from the moment the thick head rises over your glass to the to the moment that the cherry and bread flavors mix on your palate. My only problem with this beer is that the taste quickly becomes confusing to the point where I cannot tell the different between the cherry, malt or hops. That being said, each sip ends with a light, crispness that does not ebb as you continue to drink."
"Drinkability - Good enough brew if you like cherries. A little more filling, so maybe not worth drinking a lot of at one time. Interesting enough, but maybe a little cliche for this brewer."
"I really can't believe how much we liked this stuff and how aweful it tastes to me 10 years later. Then again, compared to 'the beast' I'm sure this is out-of-this-world tasty."
"D - really depends on if you're in the mood for it. it can be refreshing at times, but after buying a 6er of this I tended to avoid it until I was looking for something light, and still sort of grudgingly accepted it. I can't see myself enjoying more than one at a time. I will also add to drink this cold right out of the fridge, as it is absolutely WRETCHED when at or near room temperature"
"All in all I do like this beer. I do not think though I could ever sit down for a full session of drinking it."
"Also if you order at Applebees make sure you tell them to leave the cherry out of it. I don't need fruit in my beer"
"Highly recommended. No, really recommended."
"Drinkability: The flavor actually isn't that bad given how predominant the cherry is. Cherry dominates the smell, and almost dominates the flavor. The subtle return of earthy malts and citrus hops saves the beer."
"D - This one is by far the best cherry flavoured beer I've tried, but the cherry is a little on the synthetic side. With a bit more maltiness, I think you could get over the synthetic feel this one has to it, but it's a little too strong to overlook. Worth a try, for sure, but not to my liking."
"Drinkability was ok but not being a huge cherry or wheat fan i wont seek it out."
"Appearance is golden, some material suspended in the beer. Pours with a 1/2 inch white head. Smells of cherries, almost like cherry syrup. The smell is actually too much, it overpowers any other scent in the beer. The taste has some cherry in it, but I was hoping for it to taste a little more like a wheat beer. Mouthfeel is a little syrup-ey. A little thicker than I expected, and not a lot of carbonation. Drinkability is okay, but not something I will seek out again."
"the drinkability is above average, but I probably won't drink this again."
"While it was not hard to finish the bottle, I did find it hard to go back for another. I think the cherry was just too much. I do like the Sam Adams Summer Ale which is a regular wheat beer (I also like many of the other Sam Adams brews as well)."
"This is one of my favorite wheat beers and certainly my favorite fruit wheat. This sets the standard in my house for wheats. Everything is measured against it. Great fruit in the nose and in taste. Carbonation is perfect, good head when poured. You can't ask anything more from a fruit wheat. When I introduce new people to wheat beer this and leinenkugel sunset wheat are the two I reach for."
"Drinkability is average. I find myself buying this one about once every six months, one sixer. I wouldn't want it all the time, but it has its moments."
"D: Very good drinkability. You'll definitely want to have a few of these."
"Not impressed by the drinkability. One was ok, but no more. expected more from Boston Brewing."
"M: Refreshing at the beginning, then the bitterness and a little stinky at the end."
"It's a good carbonation, fizz, weight, and alcohol content. I think I do like this one, but I need to try some more. Which is a good thing for Sam Adams."
"A decent beer that's a nice change of pace, but not one that I could drink all night. Worth trying at a bar, but not worth buying a six pack."
"D) An alright brew. There's very little about it that makes me want to keep drinking."
"Not a bad brew by the Boston Beer Company. I understand their reasoning for trying to stretch their beers to different fruits. This beer is mainly geared toward the summer months, as evidenced by its presence at beer distributors. Give it a shot if you're a fan of SA."
"Pours out to a slightly hazy orange, forming a modest white head with good retention and sparse lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The aroma is of cherry life-savers or jolly ranchers dropped in a domestic light beer. Hops are hidden in the nose. The mouthfeel is smooth and round with a medium body. The taste opens with a whoosh of sweet cherries, followed by a lingering sweetness, a very mild bitterness in the finish and just a touch of woodsy malt husk. Goes down easy. It tastes sweeter to me today than it has over the prior years. I suspect some recipe tweaking over the years. Overall, it's a decent dessert beer, but it's quite sweet so 1 or two of these is plenty. It's strong enough that it would be good to mix in with a dry irish stout, a dopplebock, dunkleweizen, weizenbock or scotch ale. Try it out!"
"I do not recommend this one to anyone!"
"M/D: Decently drinkable, but on the whole it is average at best."
"That said, and memories aside, this beer doesn't do a whole lot for me. Somewhat refreshing, and at least this one is an over-carbonated, sickly sweet concoction like some of the other fake fruit flavored beers out there. Not bad, especially in this ninety-plus degree weather."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a boston lager glass. The appearance and aroma are probably the most alluring parts of this beer. It pours solid amber, perhaps with hints of a cherry color, with a solid head you would expect from a wheat beer. There is no hinting cherry in the aroma. Cherry is the aroma, which is actually a perfectly natural breeze of strong cherry scents. I do feel as though I am sticking my nose into a bag of fresh cherries from my farmers market, rather than a big whiff of cherry grenadine or something of that nature. Unfortunately for me, the flavor profile doesn't deliver in quite the same way. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, if slightly watery. And the carbonation is a little aggressive for me. The cherry flavor and sweetness are very one note and reminiscent of a cherry 7 up, which isn't a positive factor for me. The commercial description mentions that they added honey for additional sweetness. It wasn't necessary. Overall, this beer is a little too cloying for me to consider drinking more than one. This is sad, because the use of Traverse City cherries earned points with me before I ever even tasted it."
"The body is crisp. Carbonation level is moderate-to-high. Could tame this down a bit. Flavors of tart cherry, and some thin grains. Bitterness is low. This is different. I've had some great fruit beers, but this one fell way short for me. Won't have this one again."
"d- good cherry flavors and smooth clean aftertaste make this a good refreshing beer"
"D - Sessionable for sure, a decent brew for a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: The brew's aroma is too artificial to really be able to enjoy drinking it that much."
"Drinkability 4.0: Could very easily drink several of these in one sitting. Compared to other beer, Cherry Wheat is very drinkable and I would recommend it."
"Pours a golden color that leaves a 1 1/2 finger head that leaves a nice amount of lacing. The smell is mostly cherries. Very very sweet, Im not sure if im picking up on just the cherry sweetness or a little bit of malt sweetness. The taste is pretty much all cherry also, with a small bit of hop bitterness. A very light beer, yet fairly flavorful. The only thing i have against it is its extreme sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice as is the drinkability."
"No way I could drink more than one of these a night. This is not what ""cherry"" beer should taste like."
"Overall: It's an average beer. I do like the cherries but this needs something else. Not hops, but maybe malts."
"Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat poured a bit of a light golden color, with a small head. It had a sweet smell, and the cherry smells are very present. The taste is very intresting and novel. It has a sweet taste, and a very strong cherry taste, with a beer taste supporting it. It was pretty light, and tasty, and very easy to drink. Overall I felt it was a very good beer, however I also enjoy cherries, I can see many people disliking this beer as well."
"If you like SA and you like fruitier beer, go for the Blackberry Whit, that is actually one of my favorites by SA now."
"12 oz bottle to glass. Yellow-gold hazy appearance. Smell has some wheat beer smell but the cherry aroma made me worried, kind of fake smelling. Taste was really bad for me, the cherry was very, very strong and fake for me, like anything from store labeled ""black cherry flavored___ product."" Maybe it's all real cherries and this is what it taskes like and it's all me, but I was turned off."
"Drinkability: it was much more drinkable colder which is a bad sign, overall a light and somewhat refreshing beer as long as your not expecting too much."
"My first Sam adams, and not sure if I wanna ever try another I feel betrayed by this wannabe brew. Tastes like straight up cherry cough syrup, not like cherry soda but like cherry cough syrup. Its a real artificial bitter cherry flavor not sweet like soda but nasty bitter makes you wanna puke cherry medicine like beverage. There is no real fruit in it, its not a craft beer its not worthy of being called a beer. At $ 8 bucks for a six pack, I would not drink it if they gave it away for free. My suggestion don't buy this, you will regret it. Sam adams needs to take this one off the market, its a waste of shelfspace and makes them look bad. I am sure they make some really good stuff but this has to go."
"That was my first thought when I smelled the glass and it persisted all the way through. The base beer is grainy and weak and doesn't hold up to the artificial cherry--maybe a stronger base with some punchy yeast would have made this better? I'll be skipping it from now on."
"D - It started off easy and pretty refreshing. By the end of the 12 oz, though, the cherry flavor was a bit tiresome. Definitely don't want two in one sitting. I think this should be consumed quickly, before it gets a chance to warm."
"Smooth finish, aromatic long-lasting head. I smell the fruit, and taste the wheat.. for an $8 6-pack, I'm rating this as a solid B+ for a buy-it-anywhere SA beer."
"Taste is more reminiscient of a totally different style, like a lambic or diet cherry coke moreso than beer. None of the usual indicators that this is a wheat beer either. I'd say if you like fruit, go lambic or saison, if you like wheat beers, get a normal wheat/white/wit for that kind of thing."
"This tastes like alcoholic cherry soda, not beer. Really simple, direct, and a little too sweet. It's drinkable, but if I wanted a malternative, I would have bought one. There are much better fruit beers out there. This is the first time I've been disappointed with a Sam Adams brew."
"Overall, a dissapointment. I was expecting better when I saw on the label that Michigan cherries were used. The cherry flavor that I got was artificial and medicinal, and too pronounced for me to be able to enjoy this beer. Pretty unbalanced all around."
"I like the idea but not the results. This beer is 100% sweetened. There is no wheat to be mentioned. Huge, unbalanced flavors of sweet cherries that has no sort of tart backing. The beer taste the exact same from start to finish, warm or cold. A long lingering slimy, soda feeling is left on the tongue and teeth. If feels like i'm drinking a crude cherry flavored soda. Not recommended and I hate that this is the ""fancy"" beer at most parties."
"Wish I had seen this on tap in more places."
"I really like this beer. I've been drinking it for years. I suppose it's my guilty pleasure. It's not the greatest beer on earth, but I dig it."
"D - This is a good brew but the tartness really eats away at me, I couldn't drink alot at one sitting."
"Ehh. This is not a good beer. The cherry doesn't taste good at all in this beer. Hits you as soon as it touches the tongue and then again on the swallow. The wheat makes an appearance but only to say hi. I don't think the medicine tasting cherry helps this beer in any of the reviews. Won't drink it again, and won't recommend it to anyone."
"Drinkability> noooo"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very strong of cherries. Taste is cherries, some wheat, easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable warm weather beer."
"Mouthfeel isn't thick or syrupy, it's actually quite pleasant. Carbonation is just right. Drinkability is probably the best part of this beer, as long as you don't mind the cough syrup it's easy drinking."
"but the flavour...no. quite simply. too confronting, and with a sort of artificial feeling ""cherry concentrate"" or something. too strong for me and certainly out of context with the beer. thick bodied and good wheat-bitter finish though. but i won't be buying this one again anytime soon (provided there's so many great things out here!)"
"(d) Drinkability is another area where this beer is lacking. If im going to be limited to 2-3 beers you bet your ass its going to be with an Extreme American Ale. This beer is like too much desert, halfway through the second helping your immediately reqretting your decision to pick up the damn fork. (2.5/5)"
"O: A decent brew, but probably not something I'll try again. This brew's aroma is way too artificial and it's other aspects are just average. Someone must be buying this and Cranberry Lambic, but I don't know who. While I'm a big proponent of Sam Adams, I am not sure why they insist on making these underwhelming fruity beers—especially in such large quantities."
"Tragic."
"Cherries are tough. Too syrupy and it tastes like cough syrup, too sugary and it tastes like cough drops, too natural and it's really sour, etc. This beer does a good job with'em."
"Yeah, this isn't my favorite. And I like cherry cough medicine and Jolly Ranchers. Too much, frankly."
"Another solid brew by the Boston Beer Company. True to it's form, it has a nice head with good lacing. Very sweet cherry scents, woody, and wheaty on the nose. A true wheat beer, with high cherry accents and a slight twingy hop finish. A really nice change of pace, but hard to drink more than one or two in a session, because of the style."
"I do not plan to buy this beer again."
"This has to be one of my favorite Samuel Adams beers. I like that there is a wheat base, with that hint of cherries. Kriek style, almost like their specialty beer after the Belgian take on a Lambic. This beer is ok, out of a bottle, but an even better way to enjoy this beer is to have it poured into a int glass from either a bottle, or of course on tap. On tap this beer is phenomenal!"
"The texture was good but unless someone buys it for me or it happens to be the last beer in the fridge I don't plan on drinking this again anytime soon."
"Overall - Another favourite"
"D- A decent fruit beer, but I there are much bettter options"
"When I poured the SA cherry wheat into my glass it had a light golden color to it with a thin white head that dissipates into a think white lace. I smell a very nice aroma of cherry and wheat. A very nice taste of cherry and wheat that leaves a little bit of an after taste on the back of your tongue. I think it is a very drinkable beer that would be good as a dessert beer. I couldn't drink them all of the time but once in a while for something different is cool with me."
"D: Is like the chiclocentro of the tutsi-pops with beer."
"I believe the Cherry Wheat was the first Sam Adams brew I ever had. It makes for one of the perfect dessert beer. It brings a much sweeter taste than you might expect, but that isn't a bad thing. I'm not huge on fruit beer, but I would recommend the Cherry Wheat."
"Overall- Pretty good, but cherry flavor makes it hard to have more than 1 or 2 in a setting. Decent summer brew that would be tasty with thick cut pork chops, cheese cake, salty/rich cheeses, and maybe even cherry pie (if you are a glutton for cherry punishment)!"
"I have tried this beer twice and that is enough for me. It has a weird somewhat cherry after taste that on the first sip is ok but by the end of the bottle was enough. I have had worse beers but for Sam Adams I would have to rate this one the lowest. It is easy to drink and it has a good smell to it so I'll give it that much."
"(D) The beer is very easy to drink, my wife had one for herself and enjoyed it, and she is not a beer drinker at all. This is an excellent beer to pour for your non-beer drinking friends to open them up to the possibilitys of the better beers that are out there."
"(D)- A beer for those seeking something different. Its alright, but I would much rather grab a better tasting fruit beer than this when the mood hits me for this style. Someone who isnt a beer drinker might like this though. . ."
"B+"
" ~ This is a decent fruit brew. I recommend a try, but not a six pack."
"This beer is highly drinkable. Very refreshing and easy to drink. I remember the first time I had it, the flavors were off putting, but that was probably ten years ago when I was just getting into craft beer. I remember having it again at a beer dinner with some cherry cheesecake about 5 years ago and how well it went with the dessert. I haven't had it since and this time around I like it very much."
"Cherry aroma hits your nose immediately, after pouring into a pint glass...nice frothy head...first taste: sweetness of cherry hits the palate first, then a nice crisp finish. I like this beer. Can't drink it all the time, but only because my taste buds get used to it, and get jaded...I really think this is my all time favorite beer. My anytime beer: summer - great thirst quencher. Fall: great to go with any Autumn dish. Winter: well, hell, whatever holiday we're in, gimme a Cherry Wheat - it's a celebration in my mouth! Spring: a celebration of the season! I love this one. And maybe that makes my review a little less relevant, but for the record: I don't have any ties to the Sam Adams brewery. But I know what I like."
"drinkability low. i find this cherry wheat similar to the blackberry wit i reviewed a few weeks ago. too much fruit, not enough beer. i think Boston Brewing would do better with these types of beers if they learned to tone them down a bit and ramp up some of the other flavors. i'm not impressed."
"This is not my favorite beer due to the extra sweetness but it is definitely better than Purple Haze."
"Drinkability: I enjoy this beer a great deal and could drink sixer after sixer of it."
"d- easy to drink, as long as the cherries aren't too tart"
"The cherry flavor really overpowers everything in this beer. I've had it on tap at the brewery and it was much better. Great beer to drink in hotter weather because it's reminiscent of summer and can be considered refreshing. Some malt and carbonation in the finish but cherries throughout. It has some body and can be respected fruit beer, unlike the Cranberry Lambic."
"Overall: If this style is your thing then youll truly enjoy, if not.. well why are you considering."
"I get this on tap at a local eatery and they serve it up with a cherry in the glass tasty."
"Pours ruddy orange with a thin off-white head. Aroma is big on cherries, but rather than the normal cherry beer debate of whether it is an artificial or natural cherry character, the only question here is which cough syrup it most recalls. My choice is DayQuil. The beer has that almost stinging quality to it, making it plainly difficult to drink. Avoid."
"Cheers!"
"This beer's only flaw is in how literally it takes the ""cherry challenge," but even so, I think it is tasty. Pours an attractive hazy gold with a bright white head. Smells of cherry flavored gumdrops, perhaps a bit medicinal. The wheatiness is surprisingly surpressed in favor an interesting tartnesss. The cherry comes out on the finish. Medium bodied and all-around okay."
"God help me, I kind of like this. I consider myself a purest, beer should taste like beer and any added flavors don't belong. But this is kind of ok. Smell is only of cherries. Artificial cherries like in cherry coke. I like the smell of cherry coke. Cloudy, golden color like a typical wheat beer. About one inch of sticky white head remains after pouring. The taste is incredibly smooth. Fruity, sweet, a little tangy definately a lot of vanilla presance. Cherry vanilla Dr Pepper with the typical sour twang of a wheat beer. The sour twang was actually the least pleasant part. I like cherry vanilla dr pepper, but i'm not sure if those flavors belong in a beer. It does taste good, so how wrong can it be? This is way too sweet to have more than one. This is a once every six months change of pace kind of beer. This is a better choice than smirnoff ice or one of the other sweet, not really beer concoctions. I think that is the audiance for this stuff."
"I don't see myself knockin more than one of these back a session."
"D - Sadly, just nothing here to get excited about. Not even a session type beer...might as well drink tea...it'd be stronger. Just toured the SA brewery in Jamaica Plain...glad this wasn't one of the brews we sampled!"
"Drinkability: I could down a few if I had a set of boobs, but that is not the case."
"overall good for a fruit beer, cherry is not overwhelming, and the wheat comes through nicely, a little too sweet though."
"Cheers!"
"I had this years ago and didn't care much for it. To include this in the Sam Adams Harvest Seasonal mixed pack seems like a summer after-though. I don't associate cherries with Fall really and this isn't thirst quenching enough for a summer offering or comforting enough for a Fall Seasonal."
"D: Better than Cranberry Lambic, but that's not saying much. Should be retired from the SA lineup -- tastes like cherry cough drop soda."
"M&D- A bit of crispness initially from the carb, but that dies as this warms. Cherry wheat is a step below medium bodied with a O.K. feel. For a fruit beer I expect the cherry flavor to stay with me for a bit, but this just kind of vanishes away. A low ABV and a decent taste make this good for two bottles, I would not go farther than that though."
"Notes: Not as good as I remember it being out of the bottle. I'll admit though that I've never poured it into a glass, and I've learned that it can make a big difference. Once the flavors are allowed to develop some real errors appear. One of Sam Adams weaker beers for sure. I'll still have this occasionally because I like it out of the bottle."
"Drinkability: This is really a type of beer that must be had with food and it should be a desert. Even with that said, I found it hard to go through my whole pint because the bitterness of the beer really got to me. So it's sort of good for novelty sake, but can't see myself drinking more then one in a night."
"I liked this one. It was well balanced and enjoyable. Not the overpowering cherry tart I was expecting...I pleasant surprise."
"Taste is smooth and easy, pleasant cherry taste and not anywhere near as sweet as it smells. Decent malt balance, a touch of yeast, and slightly more than average carbonation make this a genuine entry for a fruit flavored beer instead of just dumping in some fruit juice at the end and calling it so. A good beer to have with dessert and a fine session brew for the fall or spring."
"First impressions are good; cloudy wheat-gold color with a pillowy white head. The nose is a little off-putting; wheat, with a strong air of unpleasant cherry-robitussin scent. Taste is initally very poor; like a bitter cherry pill. The wheat seems to become a little more evident after the first few sips, but it's still nothing special. The beer has a bitter, medicinal aftertaste that lingers after each sip. Definitely the weak link in the sampler pack."
"The mouthfeels is alright, but I could only swallow about 4 ounces before I gave the rest to my wife. She liked it, but I did not."
"Somewhat syrupy in the feel, and oddly filling. I would not enjoy following this up with another. I remember liking this beer way back in my initial foray into craft, say 12 yrs ago or so. It probably has not changed, but my tastes certainly have."
"This is actually a very good-looking beer, an ordinary hefeweizen hazy orange with a slight, sunsetty tinge of cherry rouge. The head on top is no slouch, puffy and cumulous and white with fantastic retention. The aroma smells like cherry kringle - not much depth, but it smells nice. The flavor is tart with cherry, which dominates, but there is a sort of wheaty tang and some bready notes underneath, plus a snap of hops in the end. Nice mouthfeel with very soft carbonation and a solid dryness; there is a bit of sweetness to this beer, but the overall impression is one of balance. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer! The cherry flavor is fresh and robust, but not overwhelming."
"It would seem at first that, as similar to soda as this beer is, that it would be easy to slam these all night. However, from experience I can tell you this beer loses its novelty fairly quickly. While one of these on occassion is a light and unchallenging treat, drinking more than one in a session proves a challenge."
"Tastes mostly like a crisp American wheat beer with a healthy dose of sweet and sour cherry flavor. It is a bit thin, and maybe even leaning towards watery, but I am enjoying this beer more than I thought I would. Not sure if a six-pack purchase is in my near future, but I'll happily drink these as part of the fall sampler pack."
"Light bodied with a high, foam-in-your-mouth level of carbonation that just makes it harder to get down. I can drink this single bottle I have unleashed upon the world, but thankfully this is from a sampler pack and my brother will drink the other. One of Sam's worst."
"Drinkability - Very easy to consume, lawnmower or beach bum beer, i.e. great for the summer. Not sure why it's in the Fall sampler pack."
"I'm generally fine with most of the Sam Adams products, especially those that are a little out of the ordinary i.e. imperial pilsner. However, their Cherry Wheat misses the mark. The look is fine - nice, golden color with a nice white head that leaves some lacing. The smell is not so great - maraschino cherry syrup; very sweet and cloying. The taste is not so cloying, but still nothing good - too sweet when there should be some tartness. Mouthfeel is like soda bordering on harsh. Yeah, this isn't my cup of tea, but I could see people enjoying this one. It's like beer, but not. Recommendation to avoid."
"Picked up the Sam Adams fall sampler to try some more from their vast line of products. The cherry wheat follows the other fruit-infused wheats they've put out over the years, but tastes more artificial than the others. Not too good."
"D: The cherry taste on the palate is very refreshing and flavorful, but the rest of the beer isn't comparably good. The strange yeasty malts will probably be the factor that deters me from having another."
"One of the first Samuel Adams beers I ever tried, it did not fail to impress (as most Sam Adams would from then on). An unusual idea for beer I would think, cherries amongst a wheat beer proved to be a pleasant surprise. From the aroma, to the exceptional taste, right down to the craving of the next sip, Sam Adams Cherry Wheat is always a recommendation I make when people are looking to dabble into new beers."
"Overall, I don't think it's a bad beer. It's just not great. It's easy enough to drink one, but I think a second might be overkill. It is a nice change of pace every once in a while though."
"D= a pretty good fruit beer. Very well thought out and use of fruit and malt. Based on style this may be the best fruit beer I've ever had."
"I love Sam Adams, so I hate to rag. However, I still regret this beer. To each his own."
"D: This beer isn't as bad as people make it out to be. The cherries give it a nice balance of sweet and tart. Not something I would drink everyday, but a decent beer."
"I don't really know why anyone would drink more than one of these. Sure, it smells great, but the taste certainly disappoints. A sweet-smelling brew but terribly unbalanced taste-wise. You'd be better off with a kriek if you want some cherry in your beer."
"I was in the mood for a cherry beer, but I picked the wrong one with this offering. I love cherries and have brewed with them myself on occasion. This is not a good cherry beer, by any measurement."
"Drinkability- really good, exceptional cherry flavor, will drink again, my girlfriend couldn't really handle it so she gave me hers which I certainly did not refuse."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"Pours with a fluffy 1/2 inch head, lots of lacing. Moderately strong aroma of cherries in the nose. Taste is crisp with an upfront tartness from the cherries. The cherry flavor dominates the taste, but the malt makes it presence known on the back of the initial cherry flavor. More tart than sweet, a pretty refreshing beer on a hot day. I could only drink one or two of these before moving on to something else."
"D: Wasn't too impressed with the aroma, but otherwise this is a fairly-enjoyable beer that would be even better on a hot day. I couldn't drink more than one or two, as the sweetness may become too much."
" If you are offered a sip of this beer for free, take it. Other than that... don't bother unless you are trying to turn a bad day worse."
"Not a bad beer actually, i was expecting the worse. The cherries are nice, producing a decent flavor (although kind of artificial) without bringing any sweetness. I think the wheat complemented nicely. My only gripes being the taste fell pretty flat compared to the taste and the mouthfeel was pretty thin. Not a bad effort."
"D- a very drinkable beer, one of few fruit beers i've liked"
"Mouthfeel is a thinner than I remember, and with a lightly grassy, bitter finish that gets a little sticky, this is the low point of Cherry Wheat for me. If it wasn't for that bitter finish, I'd consider Cherry Wheat very drinkable."
"I'll try a black and tan with the remaining cherry wheat in the mix pack, but if it's anything like the b&t I tried with cranberry lambic, this will be another SA mix pack beer to feed my drain."
"Drinkability: Not necessarily bad, but it is a bit weird. I would recommend it because it's different and worth a taste, but this isn't something I would get excited about drinking."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not that good either. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it."
"Drinkability: One of my least favorite Sam Adams, but I can have one once in a while, but too sweet for my palate."
"one is fine but any more would be overkill."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet and artificial to be truly drinkable. If real Michigan cherries were used, why does it remind me of maraschinos? Not really bad, but not interested in having it again. Sam Adams worst beer, although I never tried the infamous Triple Bock."
"Good beer for a really hot day."
"Taste: The carbonation seems slightly high, especially in a wheat but there is a nice sweetness with only a slight cherry taste."
"Drinkability - It doesn't really wear on you, so I'd imagine it would be a good beer for casual drinking. I liked it and I could drink it again, but I also wasn't wowed by it."
"I'm not sure I would like to drink many of these beers, not that it is a bad beer by any means. I think this is one of those beers you either love or don't care for. It's the latter for me I'm afraid."
"I had a six pack of this wheat beer. It does have a rather sweet aroma, though, it smells like cherry candy, very artificial. This beer is slightly cloudy, much like you would find in average wheat ales. The flavor is a change from the norm, and in hot weather can prove to be quite refreshing, just be sure to keep you other favorites nearby as this one has a bitter cherry aftertaste like you would find in cough drops. The palate leaves much to be desired, just serve this one cold to avoid complications. Overall, this beer is an ""OK"" beer that is best served cold and consumed rather quickly. Just remember this is a wheat beer and can be quite filling as well."
"On-tap at Mr. Goodbar's. Synthetic tasting cherry aroma and taste. Grapefruit body and a bit of soapy head, some lace. Looks OK, average mouthfeel. Nothing special to drink or taste. After some cherry lambics and wild yeasts recently, this didn't cut it."
"Not a bad beer by any means, this is a beer that gives you exactly what is advertised. Very refreshing and easy drinkability make this one a solid choice for the hotter months. A good beer to have every once in a while, but not something that I would keep stocked in the fridge."
"D - The more I sip at this, the less I want to drink it. It's aroma caught me right away followed by the appearance but the flavor and mouthfeel began turning me off quickly. Not something I'd want more than one of and definitely one of Samuel Adam's weaker offerings."
"Drinkability: I personally couldn't handle more than one of these in a sitting, just because of the sweetness. If you're into fruit beers though, this seems to be an agreeable, light, peppy beer to usher in spring."
"Drinkability: I tried to be as objective with this beer as possible. If you like the taste of cherries, you will like this beer; if you don't, then you won't like this beer. I belong to the latter, and therefore did not care for this one."
"D- This stuff is just plain refreshing, and strikes a great balance between sweet and dry."
"If you like cherries or cherry flavor you'll love this!!! Some of the reviews I have read seem a bit harsh and I sense that maybe these folks may not particularly care for cherry flavor? I have been a fan of this stuff since it came out many years ago and have had it on tap as well. Most of the time it is great but there is some inconsistency with batches so if you get a bad six pack or draught, definitely try another single or on tap. I can say that this particular bottle, even though it is over a month out of date, is still excellent. As a plus, I believe it is now bottle conditioned for longer shelf life."
"app is hazy gold amber with slight foam head and clearer near the bottom, when shone in the light red can be seen, kind of cool. Smells bad though , like nothing but cherry cough syrup and carbonation. Taste is similarly terrible strong cherry medicine like from begginning most of the way through , although the end is very wheat like and gives a decent mouthfeel , but still this is a hard drinker for me, but then again I don't like cherries so what do you expect."
"Very drinkable, and I recommend you follow your instincts to finish it quickly. Unlike many beers, this gets worse as it warms."
"Maybe if I was on a desert island and had nothing else to drink, if that was the case; I'd want a pistol and one bullet."
"D- This is a decent summer time beer if you can stand the flavor. Best served very cold in my opinion."
"Sam Adams Cherry Wheat pours a light gold with a thin head. The aroma is sweet ripe cherries, almost artificial, like cherry ice cream. The flavor is sweet and slightly tart cherry with crisp dry wheat flavor. The finish is slightly bitter with a sharp, tart flavor from the wheat. This is an alright fruit beer, but the cherry flavor does not meld well to me."
"D - Average fairly easy drinker, if you can get past the taste"
"The foam was light wheat in color, smooth, thick and lacey. The color was orange golden amber with dark honey highlights. The smell had a extremely potent cherry pit overtone with hints of wheat. The taste was the mirror image of the smell. Mouthfeel - light medium-bodied with a semi-viscous feel. Drinkability - there is a very dominate and powerfull bitter cherry characteristic that hides the wheat taste. Ok session."
"Drinking the beer after smelling is definitely a let down. In the nose there was nothing but cherry, now on tasting it's mostly your standard American Wheat Ale with a tiny bit of hop bitterness mixing with the cherries, and finishing with a slightly bitter cherry aftertaste. While the cherry may not carry through as advertised, it is a very drinkable beer, just a let down on the promise of cherry and wheat."
"Its taste very much like cherries, I like having this beer as a chaser after something strong, but its not great after food."
"D - Refreshing, not overy sweet and a different class of fruit beer from other brands. A very guilty pleasure."
"Body approaches medium. Carbonation is light & fine. Feels creamy without being heavy. It's easy enough to drink, I just don't think I'll ever buy this again."
"D: A bit of a misfire from BBC. There's hardly any wheat characteristics at all. The cherries take over everything."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of head. It is golden and clear. It smells like maricino cherries. It has a sweet cherry taste with a solid wheat backbone. It is a great beer for enjoying after a day of weeding the garden. It really hits the spot."
"Wow, the cherry element in this beer is done very well. I'm normally not a fan of wheat beers, but the wheat portion is so nicely blended, it makes it almost like a cherry sprite! Very easy to drink - almost dangerously easy."
"On tap at the Coolidge Corner Clubhouse. Ordered one because I haven't had one in years. Not much head on the pint glass. Hazy yellow color, with medium carbonation. Smells sugary and tart. The flavor is way too overpowering. It's like drinking cherry juice right out of a can. Doesn't taste like beer at all really, more like a cider or fruit juice. No wheat beer characteristics noticed. Very sticky on the palate. I remember the first time I had one of these when it first hit the market. My preferences have definitely changed since then. Not sure if I could have more than one pint."
"I am not normally a fan of fruit beers but I found this to be surprisingly good. Had a golden color with just a tinge of red to it. The aroma definitely announced that cherry was present. The taste is not sweet. You get the cherry with a slight tartness and the wheat flavors come across as well. One doesn't overwhelm the other. It was very crisp and perfect for a hot summer day."
"Pretty easy to drink, the cherry isn't as cloying as I thought it'd be."
"D: One is enough for me."
"Appearance cloudy light straw copper. Smell is a burst of cherry. Maybee a hint of wheat but the cherry dominates. Taste is an immediate burst of cherry followed by a wheaty finish. There is a decent head with lacing. The beer is thick and would be ideal for an after dinner drink. Not my favorite by any means but is great twist to a fruit/vegie drink."
"This beer pours a ever so slightly hazy gold-orangish color with a one finger white head left on top. Decent head retention and wispy lacing left on the glass. The nose is cherries, cherries, cherries - maracchino cherries, and just a touch of a malt backbone to it. Taste is overwhelmingly cherry. I am definitely a fan of fruity beer, but the cherry flavoring dominates the taste to a point of distraction - perhaps because it almost an artificial cherry taste. There are slight notes of malts in this beer, but not enough to even remotely balance out the cherry. On the lighter side of medium bodied, medium to high carbonation that works well for this beer, slightly creamy with a dry finish to it. Many years ago, I had tried this beer and loved it, oh how the palate changes. This is a beer that you could have one of, anything more would be far too sweet."
"Cloudy copper color. Light prickle with a wispy head. Cherry and grain on the nose. The cherry smell is reminiscent of cherry skoal smokeless tobacco. The attack is mild and clean. Faint hints of cherry and grain in the flavor. Relatively clean finish with just a little bite of wheat. The aftertaste is definitely cherry. This is a pretty unique beer to say the least. My wife says that it tastes like Smith Bros. cherry throat lozenges."
"My drain was able to chug this beer easily, but I could not get through more than half of the pint. One of the few big stinkers from Boston Beer Company."
"Drinkability: Unless you have fond memories of your parents giving you cough syrup when you were a child, this isn't for you. Some actual cherry flavoring would have helped, but this one was not that. Pass. I'm glad I have a store where I can make my own six packs. I can't imagine dealing with 5 more of these."
"I bought a six pack and am trying to get rid of it. I can barely drink two of these at a time without getting a sickly taste in my mouth (as stated, they remind me of ludens cough drops which probably does not invoke the most pleasant memories hence my not liking this beer). I am very disappointed because I had high hopes for this beer. Some of my best childhood memories were spent in Michigan so when I saw they were made with Michigan cherries I was genuinely excited to try this beer. Too bad it is not what I thought it was going to be. Oh well, I guess I just have to wait for fall/winter when my favorite Sam Adam seasonals come out!"
"Drinkability - Not my favorite, a fairly weak offering in my opinion."
"[1x]"
"Final thoughts: i would only drink this on one of three occations: if I was ordering a summer salad, if I was a non beer drinker and or if I was a first time beer drinker. Not to bad."
"Pours hazy golden with white head. Nose is full of artificial cherry flavoring (not assuming it wasn't real cherries added). Palate is lightly sour, with big cherry flavors (not lambic levels though), and a soft malty component towards the end. Easy to drink, good for a gateway beer and women."
"D - I was ready after smelling the beer...but the taste didn't do it for me...I like Sam Adams...just not their fruit beers"
"M-D- Mouthfeel is soft but also very sweet in flavor that makes you kind of smack your lips to bare it. Drinkablity is alright if you like a fruity beer to sip on."
"D: It was the longest six apck ever. I would say try it you might like it. (I didn't)"
"Drinkability: Personally, I would say there are many far more engaging fruit-based beers to be had, but, if you're a fan of the cherries and are looking for light, easy-going refreshment with a slight alcoholic kick, then this may be the way to go."
"Its another great brew from Samuel Adams. Samuel Adams is probably my favorite beer company. The beer is great in a bottle and it's even better on tap!"
"When I first started drinking this, I thought it would be too sweet to drink more than one or two bottles, however the sweetness doesn't seem to carry the weight that other fruit flavored drinks do."
"D - I thought that it would be too sweet to finish when I started, but the sweetness seemed to mellow out a little bit...somewhat refreshing on a warmer day"
"Drinkability: For the life of me I can not figure out why I like this beer. The best part about it is the fact that I want to drink more. Chalk this one up too the Twilight Zone >.>"
"Overall, there are just way too many cherries in this beer. If they toned it down a bit, I would be able to have another, but not at this rate. This could maybe be an alright summer beer."
"I know a lot of people that really enjoy this beer, but I can say I'm definitely not one of them. It pours very yellow, with a thin head that disappears very quickly and leaves almost no lacing. I can smell a bit of wheat, but the aroma is dominated by a thick cherry scent, almost more like a soda than a beer. The taste follows suit, with the up front chery flavor dominating every sip. For people who love a lot of fruit flavor in their beers, this would be perfect. After one of these I did not want another."
"Certainly not the best wheat beer out there, but its got a lot of good things going for it. Yellow, but not a corn yellow, more the color of sand on a summer day on the northeast coast. Not much head retention, and a definite chill haze. Smells like cherry cough drops, and wheat (nice). Tastes a lot different than a lot of other wheat beers. It has very up front tastes of fruit, but its not exclusively cherry. I really do enjoy the way it lacks dryness, and instead provides an single intent. This beer wanted to be cherry... and it most certainly is. I could drink a couple of these on a nice summer day, and feel I spent my hard earned money on a respectable brew."
"D = I would say this is definitely an after dinner beer. It is so sweet you could serve it with some waffle cones or honey graham crackers and it would actually go rather well. Other than that, I don't know what it would go with. The cherry is so overpowering that it does mask the grain and hops to a great degree. Serve to someone interested in changing up from wine coolers or cocktails who is not familiar with good brew."
"This is not a bad change of pace beer. I could have two in a sitting, but I don't think I'd go for more than that. It's got a niche I'm sure, being affordable, and probably a tasty alternative for girls and BMC drinkers. Starts to get tiresome rather quick, unfortunately, maybe as a result of being too flavorful, especially compared to wheats like 312 or Blue Moon. It easily could have had half as much cherry flavor, and it still would have been plenty."
"65% recommended."
"Overall, this is an alright beer. It is a bit too heavy on the cherries for me because they don't feel well balanced with the actual beer. Worth a try but I will probably not seek it out."
"Fantastic. It looks great when you pour it out. When you give it a whiff you get a burst of wonderful cherry aroma. Then when you take your first sip you get that same burst of cherry flavor that you expected as soon as you smelled it. Then you get a wonderful light, crisp beer flavor that complements the cherry flavor fantastically. I could pound these all day long."
"I am no expert but I know what I like and this beer is definitely not what I like. In appearance it is good ,nice cherry red and oakish brown blend,but beer is meant to be imbibed,not merely seen. It starts with the aroma. It smells and tastes like the cherry cough syrup my mother used to make me drink.This beer is so repulsive I am shocked that a major brewing company like sam adams(which has other beers I do like) could put something so horrible into the market. I had to ask my waitress for a different beer as I could not actually finish this beer. I was thinking maybe the bar I was at (stone face tavern ,abq NM) had served me yet another stale or spoiled beer (unfortunately a common problem with beers on tap in Albuquerque bars) but then I read a review from another guy on BA who said the same thing! Maybe I am breaking the rule of being constructive but I'm sorry there is no saving this beer or considering what the brew master was going for,this beer is nasty! I like cherries and I like beer but I would sooner drink pond scum than another sam adams cherry wheat."
"-Dotson"
"Overall- Decent beer, not a bad idea to give it a shot. I would probably drink it again, especially if it was on tap somewhere, I bet it would be better that way."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite Samuel Adams beers. I can easily drink several of these in short order. Very nice on a hot summer day."
"It is however, a delicious session beer for a hot spring day. Very drinkable with a little bit of taste to keep it different."
"D- no more than 2 with an after diner drink.. can over power what meal you have"
"Poured a hazy gold with a decent head that retains a very nice lace. Nose is heavy cherry aroma with little wheat. Taste is crisp and dry with some cherry flavor and bitterness. Refreshing but not what to get when looking for a beer. Worth a try though"
"Verdict: As wrong as it seems, there is something pleasant about the cherry flavor. However, it still seems much better suited to the candy world than the beer world. This is a very strange beer, and I find it hard to rate. All I can really say is that while I certainly don't love it, I don't absolutely hate it either. I suppose that makes it average."
"A solid selection. Much better than the cranberry lambic. Beer has a cherry flavor with still maintaining the characteristics of beer. Beer is very light and can hold its own vs. many wheat beers without added flavoring. The color is rich. The aroma isn't that great, but is still solid."
"Drinkability- I find the first and second glasses to be sufficient for myself, because the cherry does become overwhelming as you drink more and more of it. Went extremely well with the burger and fries I had."
"The body is fairly light with low carbonation. It's thin, but not so thin as to seem watery."
"This beer pours a hazy amber-orange color. The head is half and inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of cherry cough drops, and nothing else. The taste is a little more beery, but it is still dominated by cherry cough drops. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this beer is too much like medicine for me too like. I can't see myself drinking thins again."
"Sampled on Feb. 16, 2009 on tap at a Ruby Tuesday restaurant. It pours a bubbly pale-yellow with a small amount of off-white head. The carbonation is constant. Any evidence of malts or hops are immediately drowned out by the ovepowering cherry and fruity scents. It's just way too much for me. The mouthfeel is of medium texture. The flavor is like cherry Kool-Aid but more sour or tart. I think I caught a tiny bit of hops but it is really indistinguishable from that cherry taste. Subtlety would have been the better route for this brew. Not all that great."
"D- I will be sure to purchase a larger quantity of this whenever I get the chance. I would love to enjoy this over an evening with friends and can foresee some good times ahead with this one! Great patio beer! I highly recommend this one for a beginner or for veterans who like something different now and again!"
"D - Great drinkability, especially of this taste is what you are looking for. This beer is well balanced and easily drinkable. Not a ""stand out"" wow beer, but nice and easy to drink with some high points."
"Notes: Better than the Cranberry Lambic, so it's got that going for it."
"Extra: Again a very strong cherry. When they call it cherry wheat they where not kidding. But I liked it. The abundance of cherry made for an easy quencher."
"Tried this today for the first time and was really actually impressed. It was incredible delicious and drinkable with a good cherry flavor but not grossly over powering. It was just very well balanced and smooth. Only had half of one but def wanted more then that. The smell was well lived up to in the yummy cherry tasty. A good beer which was and impressive brew in the sam adams line of beers."
"This is a beer that is good for when you need something really light but still want to drink a beer. Not a bad beer for clearing the taste buds in between Imperial porters."
"drinkability: a great session beer with low taste. Bud drinkers would probably approve. Not a great Beer advocate beer though."
"Overall: Smells amazing but doesn't follow up on the taste, it's not very well carbonated but is still very drinkable. I'd say try a bottle if you get it cheap, I wouldn't avoid it but probably won't seek it out again."
"Drinkiability is moderate to average. Not an everyday beer but when the occassion calls for it, its a dessert beer."
"Drinkability is moderate."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. One inch head with good retention and lacing. Smells strongly of cherry flavoring (reminiscent of cough syrup). Fits the style unfortunately. There is a smooth and crisp mouth feel (unlike a thick syrup). Average carbonation levels. There is a cherry syrup flavoring that is very strong. Designated as a desert beer and that is the only way I could drink another one of these. There is an associated tartness that makes is hard to drink. Overall, not that great of a combination (cherry + beer)."
"Drinkability: sourness prevents it from being a sessions beer for me, but a nice sour beer."
"D: I have had this beer many times in bottles, but never on tap.. let me tell you, it's a whole new beer. in bottle form I can do one or two, on tap I could drink all day. this beer proves why draght is better."
"Bottle pour into Stella glass. Pours a reddish orange with medium white head. Definite aroma of cherry, not as much in the flavor. Malt, yeast, slight wheat. Lacing is okay. Better initial flavor, less at finish. Somewhat dry finish and less distinct flavoring. I do not enjoy the aroma, there is definitely a strong ""cherry flavored medicine"" smell going on for me. I would not purchase again. The rating is given within its fruit beer category."
"Basically a lawn mower beer that is easy to drink on a hot summer day....I found this one to be very crisp and refreshing but really no point in drinking in any other situation. Really not that bad but it still feels like a beer intended for people who don't normally drink beer..."
"This underwhelms a little. Not a strong wheat flavor, and not a strong cherry. . . despite what the name might imply. However, it does have a nice nose, and decent appearance, and taste is certainly not bad (just not the flavor you would expect, given the nose). Good drinkability. Overall, a decent quaff."
"This really is not even a style of beer in general that I would normally purchase myself. But for what it is, it's not bad. I think I would only recommend it to novices who tend towards sweeter beers, though."
"Drinkability is low, i drank three of these in a row and felt sorta sick from all the sweetness by the end. An alright brew."
"Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery."
"D - If you like sweet fruity drinks, then this beer is for you. But one is all I can try. It is too sweet for me."
"(rated Jul 12, 2007)"
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"Drinkability is good if you aren't craving hops. Would be a good desert beer. I ended up drinking all of the Cherry Wheats in the box. One per session."
"Drinkability: As far as fruit beers go, this is pretty drinkable. Not my favorite style, nor my favorite fruit. Finishing the glass says something."
"D: light and smooth, but the fullness makes it hard to drink a lot of these in a night. Would be good for a nightcap, or just to lounge around. Reason for the 3.5 is because this beer is filling, which is to be expected from a wheat beer."
"Try it..."
"Cherry drowns everything else out. Cherry aroma, cherry taste. Pours golden, small white head, little lacing. Some malt in there, traces of wheat. All in all a little too fruity for me. I'm not a huge fruit beer fan to begin with, this was a little much for me. Probably enjoyable if it's your thing, but it was a little too fruity and not nearly ""beery"" enough for my tastes. Somebody else mentioned that this fits well in a Samuel Adams variety pack- I'd agree with that."
"I loved this stuff when I first got into craft beer,but now I pass on it if possible,just too sweeet for me now I think. Love most of Sam's other stuff though."
"Poured in a wheat glass it is a reddish orange color that is cloudy. A very strong cherry smell with hints of wheat and orange. Through the drink you can taste cherries and the wheat is just a second thought. Too much cherry flavor not enough malt and wheat to balanced this beer out. It was just an okay beer."
"Ewwuu!"
"After I took only a few sips, I passed this beverage around to all my friends ranting on how great this beer tasted. I couldn't believe how strong the cherry taste was. My only issue with this beer is I only had two, but couldn't imagine trying to put down a whole six pack of these in one sitting."
"Drinkability: It couldn't be anymore drinkable than this beer. Very refreshing, crisp and just enough sweetness to make this a great summertime beer."
"D - This is another Samuel Adams that does what it is meant to do, very refreshing and drinkable, nothing awe inspiring with the taste, but a good, easy drinkable Wheat Beer"
"Pours a light brown/tan colored body, with a very big white head, and some good lacing. Has a strong aroma of slightly sour cherries, some maltiness too. Very lively palate, an aftertaste of cherries. Some wheat taste, malts. Moderately heavy body. Nice tasty brew, one of the gateway beers for me."
"Rich mouthfeel with complex overtones. Tastes like beer at first, but then it hits you - cherry. Fake cherry. Why do they add the super-fake flavor? Okay, BS - this stuff is cough syrup. Don't bother. The only person I have known who really liked this stuff was my last boss. Let's leave it at that."
"Nikki"
"Before trying this particular brew from Sam Adams I had never tried anything cherry-based in flavor. This beer has an incredible aroma which instantly brings to mind cherries and a golden body. It's certainly worth trying however, the cherry flavor was complimented by only a slight amount of malts. Therefore, it was incredibly sweet and taste like a juice more than anything else. Nevertheless, still a decent and interesting beer."
"This wheat beer is a little too sweet to drink on a regular occasion, would have like to taste more malts. It was too light , almost lighter than a light beer, very watery. Could drink many at a time, but i dont really have a reason to as the flavors weren't very good"
"D: I suppose this would, at least, make a good session beer... but only if you weren't worried too much with taste. Smell on this wheat is the best thing it has going for it. Average."
"Definitely drinkable because its so easy going down, but it might be a little too sweet after the first or second. Other than that, I wouldn't mind if this beer spilled in my car (if my upholstery was cloth) because I'm sure it would smell great. Not that I condone drinking and driving, you might spill yer drink."
"Too bad I drank the Founders that I had in there as fast as I did and that I had to resort to this.."
"Strong supporter of Sammy's products but this isn't my cup of tea. Pleasant sweet aroma the cherry is nice to the nose. Tacky feel, finish is alright. Flavor is a lost cause for me. The beer has enough malt character but the cherry just seems forced and unnatural. Slightly overdone perhaps, but I prefer cherries in darker beers. Solid effort and the ladies seem to dig it so it's not a bad beer, just isn't my style."
"This is obviously a popular beer for Sam Adams but I am not feeling it. Sorry Jim."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkablity- One surprise after another, this beer is dazzling the hell out of me. Sharp and quick immediately upon entering the mouth, it turns seafoamy and slick within seconds and becomes liquid velvet for the remainder of its short time there. Although I probably wouldn't drink more than one or two at a sitting, for intense flavor reasons only, this is stunningly enjoyable and **way** better than I remember from years ago."
"D- its alright, this bottle was a couple months old and i think it made it much better. still not a great beer, but its pretty good."
"I used to like these brews, but over the years I can't help but hate it. It has a slightly couldy appearance, strong sents of cherry and undetones of wheat. It's very sweet, almost tastes like a cheap hefeweizen with cherry syrup in it. I think the cherry syrup taste ruined this one, it definitely needs to be toned down. If you're looking for a good fruit beer go for a Magic Hat #9 or something."
"Pours a reddish light brown body with a thick, frothy head that takes awhile to go down. Some sweetness in the smell and minor hops, but the cherry is predominant. A smooth, somewhat hoppy beer but the cherry overrides everything. Not only is this medium-bodied beer out of balance but the cherry taste is sharp and cutting; reminded me of cherry 7Up. It isn't a bad beer and it tickled my sweet tooth, but I really couldn't stand it that much and one was enough for me."
"I liked this beer when I first tried it I ultimately grew tired of it after a few years. Now I can raise a glass and fully appreciate the beer for what it is. Although, now I wish that this beer was a little less filtered and closer to a ""Hefe"". Overall a good drinkable beer with a slight cherry taste towards the finish."
"D-To me, I couldn't get past a few sips of this beer. In this case, the smell was better than the taste. Hubby's drinking the rest."
"D. Couldnt have more than one of these to sweet for me ill pass on another"
"It looks and feels like a wheat should but damn its sweet."
"This beer seems to get a lot of hate on this website but I absolutely love it. The cherry taste seems genuine and it isn't overbearing for me. I see some people compared it to cough syrup.. which I cannot see at all. My girlfriend who doesn't like most beer will drink this like nothing but its still ""beer-ey"" enough for me to enjoy as well. A solid pick."
"D- Lawnmower says it all for this one."
"Out of the bottle this beer was a slightly hazy yellow. Two fingers of fine head topped it and it displayed both good retention and very good lacing. The aroma was dominated by cherries with some metallic hints behind that which makes it a little artificial. The flavors were quite sweet at first but not cloying, but they mellowed out into a maltiness before finishing with a yeast tang. The tang is a little bitter and it makes the aftertaste unpleasant. Still, I found this one quite drinkable, summery and generally pleasant. It's a good medium bodied beer and probably a great swimming in the river, getting girls bikini tops off kinda brew. Hell yeah."
"This beer pours a yellowish-golden color with an inch of good looking foam. The aroma is heavy with fruit dominated mostly by cherries. Light wheat character on the palate with slight carbonation. The flavor is artificial cherry up front with a little tartness and a little hop bitterness at the end. A little fruity for my tastes, but at least its not overly sweet."
"Overall: I likes it"
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. Pours a deep orange color with lots of head, lotsa lacing. The smell is like cherry coke and so is the taste. It has a light to medium body with adequite carbonation. This brew is fairly easy drinking. I guess this would be good for people who are gateway beer drinkers(they like Mikes lemonade). This beer really is not for me, a bit too sweet."
"Basically another good Sam Adams product"
"I am sorry, this is pretty bad. Avoid at all costs."
"apearance was nice but god, the smell! Completely over the top cherry cough syrup smell. Not a hint of wheat that I could discern. Taste was a little more pleasing but still oh so heavy on the cherries. This was closer to some kind of carbonated flavored mixed drink from smirnoff than it was to a beer. Taste wasn't terrible but so sweet that I'd never want to drink more."
"D - To sweet to be enjoyable all the time. Maybe ok as a desert beer but not very impressive"
"D - good for a few. have something different an then go back for a few more."
"I am not the descriptive type by far, But I have tried quite a few of the samuel adams beers, And I can say I really dont feel like I am even drinking a beer when I had one of these, Chick drink comes to mind. My wife really liked it though, And turns out the neigbhor's wife likes it as well. Yet he pretty much thought the same about it."
"This was more of a desert beer to me and my friends than anything else. It's a good beer to finish off a drinking session with buddies."
"Overall this is decent, but nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability isn't there for me. I will tap out after one or two of these because of the sweet cherry taste. Fairly nice summer drink, it isn't the best beer, but I would recommend people at least try it."
"Bought this in a Sam Adams variety pack, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. I still wouldn't. I may be a little too harsh, but it just tastes too much like a cherry flavored soda for me to really enjoy it as a beer. It smells like cherry soda, too. For all I know, it may be considered a great 'fruit/vegetable beer', but I just don't dig those in general. The cherry flavor is not subtle at all, and I like when beer has subtle flavors. This tastes like cherry soda with some alcohol in it."
"Drinkability: This was always my wife's favorite beer in college, so I had a lot of it around. While she has moved on to being more of a hophead, Cherry Wheat stills shows up once in a while. I think it is a nice fruit wheat, so many of them leaving you wondering if they actually added any fruit to the beer. I guess I don't understnad the people complaining baout it tasting too much like cherries. It is what it is, a fruit beer."
"D - Very drinkable beer."
"T: Cherry all over this, some malts and hops pop out at the end, but really a nice mix. A good mix for a fruit beer. One of the better ones."
"D: More drinkable than many flavored beers."
"D - Once is enough for me, but fruity beers aren't my thing (yet)..."
"A little surprised as it was a little more complex than I had it pegged for. Still, nothing great."
"This is pretty much what I had expected. It pours a cloudy copper color with a nice foam head and quite a bit of lacing. Aroma is a strong (you guessed it) cherry flavor. Mild malts with a zesty cherry flavor. A reference to cough syrup isn't unjustified and definitely doesn't help it's cause. Not the greatest mouthfeel. Refreshing enough but probably not something to drink a lot of or very often. Actually, I might not get it again, the whole cherry beer thing just isn't for me."
"Drinkability: Only if you really enjoy it can you go back to back"
"Bottle: Poured a lightly red color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of sweet Wisconsin cherries with some more subtle wheat malt. Taste is also dominated by the sweet Wisconsin cherries with a light medicinal note that I wasn't exactly fond of. Wheat is very subdued and almost impossible to detect. A bit too much of the cough syrup taste for my taste buds but still a worthless effort."
"Tasty, have had quite a few of these before. Solidly above average fruit beer."
"I was not expecting much, but this is a good brew. I am not crazy about fruit beers, but this has a nice touch without overpowering the beer. Light and fruity."
"Very drinkable. While not complex or an overly great brew, I have found myself in the position before where this is the best available. Hence I have grown to appreciate this some what mediocre brew. Nothing wrong with it, it is what it is. Simple brew with a touch of flavor and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: For me, though there are some redeeming qualities, the taste of this beer is just not doing it for me. I won't have it again."
"Drinkability is low for me. The taste was murder and I won't be touching this again if I can help it."
"Appearance is slightly hazy golden-yellow with a lively yellowish-tan head that shows a very faint pink hue. Aroma has a very full nose of medicinal marachino cherry and buttery-sweet graham cracker crust. I'm not really detecting any hop aroma due to the marachino cherries. Taste is very similar to aroma but at least the cherry is not overpowering the malt, which is by the way not as buttery or sweet as the aroma was. Hop flavor is pretty floral here and bitterness is kept to a minimum to make this a pretty easy drinking brew. Mouthfeel is medium-light and it finishes pretty dry and crisp which helps keep this beer from becoming too cloying. Not a bad beer for a hot summer day."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: I know a lot of people don't like this beer, I do. It's a good fruit beer pleasantly crisp with good flavor. It's a refreshing beer."
"Just absolutely NO balance to this beer at all. They went wayyy overboard with the cherries on this one, as they dominate everything about this brew. Difficult to even call it a 'brew' since I had to work so hard to try to detect anything resembling beer from this one. Gotta rake this one over the coals for the total lack of any balance. And I LOVE cherries, but I love beer too. No beer here that I could find. Might be good for someone who doesn't like beer..."
"Good beer. Somewhat of a novelty. Good for sitting on the porch after dinner on a summer night."
"I never was a fan of sweet or fruity beers, but I liked this for its easy drinkability."
"Taste is very similar to the smell, seemed to finish a bit harsh at first but smoothed out markedly as the beer went on. A bit of a puckering taste, feels very fizzy and carbonated, too. Might be difficult to quaff more than a few of these between the strong flavor and the carbonation."
"Purchased as part of a Sam Adams summer variety pack. Poured the beer from the bottle into a pint glass. The beer is brownish orange in color and the head dissipates to non existence quickly. The nose on this is a cherry bomb, but good if you like cherries. The taste initially is sweet cherry and cherry on the finish, but somewhere in between you can tell that this is a beer. The mouth feel is just about what you would expect from the taste and the finish is slightly dry. I would drink a few and I am usually not a fan of fruit beers."
"The aroma is really nice with a lovely cherry aroma with the wheat in the background. The taste is cherry all the way through with a crispness to it. In the mouth it is pretty thin. Overall not a bad fruit beer. The smell is the strongest part of it to me."
"This beer is a once in a while thing, I could not drink this regularly. Poured with beautiful white head. The body was hazy with large particles averagely dispursed. There was almost no carbonation and the body hue was a moderately darker golden brown. This beer is rightly named. The aroma was thick with dark cherries that overpowered almost every other scent, although there was a light yeast at the bottom. The flavor was again overpowered by dark cherries that was heavily/harshly sweet with a light bitterness towards the end. The finish was average length with a tiny amount of bread and very acidic. The palate was a medium body with a watery and creamy texture and soft carbonation."
"D - Different and versatile... Good, but not great... Solid, but not an everyday beer..."
"D - This was ok...a lot of cherry-syrup in the flavor, which dominated everything. This is ok to drink, neither one I would pass down, nor one I would seek out."
"Drinkability: Good transition beer. Can drink a few of these and not feel too weighted down. Nice job."
"D- It's light and drinkable, but not very refreshing and not very enjoyable."
"D- Not recommended at all."
"All in all, not a bad beer, but I'd rather smell it than drink it. Nah, who am I kidding. It's still beer, and it's going down the gullet."
"Overall- Actually not bad. Probably wouldn't want more than 1 or 2. You get 2 in the summer 12pack and thats sufficient."
"It tasted just like it smelled, although the cherry flavor was way to strong. It just tasted like beer with cherry juice in it. I couldn't even finish it. Not impressed at all. Does anyone make a beer that has a REAL cherry taste to it?"
"I had this brew for the first time in quite a while when a friend had an extra one sitting around. It was just as disappointing as I remembered. It sure smells great, but the taste is pretty bad. It certainly didn't look very good as I poured it into a pint glass either - no haziness despite being a wheat beer. It was very light in body, but with a very synthetic and cloying cherry flavor. Drink it cold and it's tolerable, but let it warm just a little and you are bombarded with a dismal cherry cough syrup flavored aftertaste."
"D - Not impressed at all."
"D: As I said before, this isn't the first time I've had this one ... but it might be the last. I could see this beer as an ingredient in sauces for meat dishes though!"
"I don't think that I would drink this again. It really is just a sad example of the style."
"My least favorite Sam offering...I can say I've tried it now."
"pours a nice very clear golden color, not much sign of the cherries there, but that's where the lack of cherry stops, the nose is cherry and not a lot else I can detect, and while it borders on authentic cherry it doesn't quite make it.  the taste is quite the same but more candy like... but with a bitter finish, it's got a nice crisp mouthfeel, all in all it drinks more like a wine cooler than a beer."
"Yellow color with a slight redish tint to it. Head was very small, did not retain much of it. Smell is awesome cherrys and sweetness. Taste is very malty, low carbonation, cherry is in there but I dont feel its too overpowering, slight bitter aftertaste. I could see this going very well with a cherry dessert or during a nice winter party. Yet to have a fresh Sam Adams I did not enjoy. Good job SA."
"It was not horrible because it is clearly a cherry wheat beer, but I think it was a little too much on the cherries in both the smell and taste."
"d: i'm enjoying it much more this time around. sweet, but not quite too sweet. the cherry is nice and avoids the artificial flavor many fruit beers have. works well with the wheat style. solid fruit beer. perfect fit for the beers of summer 12-pack."
"Drinkability: I was pleasantly suprised with this one. Mine had a Nov08 best by date on it so it must have been fresh. The fresh cherry flavor was excellent and I would definitely have this again."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. I could write this summary up in one word: cherry. Ridiculously overfruited, I can't smell or taste anything else. Very poor. Supposed to be beer with fruit added, not the other way around."
"Drinkability: Poor taste, but not poior enough to keep me from drinking at least one more. Then again...."
"Pours a slightly bronze color--fuzzy head that quickly fades leaving little lacing. Fairly clear. Smell is sweet, soft cherry essence, some yeast. Taste is slighly sour with very little wheat. Cherry flavor is masked by the sourness. For some reason its fine in a bottle but on tap its not as good, at least imo. Very little body in the mouth. Drinkability is moderate. Ok but not great."
"D: This beer feels very light and thus goes down easy. Inconsistency from one bottle to the next is disconcerting."
"Very strong tart cherry aroma and flavor. Dry, tart, crisp taste. Plenty of carbonation which adds to the crispy tart bite of the cherry flavoring. The cherry totally overpowers the wheat. I can only get one of these down. The cherry is just too strong. Maybe they're shooting for some old school cherry style with this one, but it just didn't work for me at all."
"Bought a six pack from Four Seasons Liquors. The beer settles with a thin head throughout, but with no real lacing. Clear, brown-red (not too amber-like) appearance. Aromas are potent cherry flavors with some thin grain hints. Not too overpowering, just right in potency. Taste is wicked good and sweet: those cherry/grain flavors are apparent and warmly wrapped around hops and malts. Mouthfeel is basic and allows it to be crisp but a little light. Overall, a really good fruit beer from Sam Adams."
"Interesting sample, but nothing above and beyond..."
"At first when I opened it I took a big whiff and really thought someone gave me cherry coke instead of beer. I took a sip and still thought I was drinking cherry coke. The Cherryness died off some the more I drank. The mouthfeel was alright. I dont believe I would ever choose to drink this again unless it was all I had left."
"Slightly heavier body than the average, lots of carbonation and a crisp finish. I could probably tolerate the cherry flavor enough to have this again, but not in succession."
" D This is a good summertime beer for those who enjoy fruit beers with a sourness to them, but don't want to spend the extra money on the richer Belgian fruit beers. I enjoyed it. After reading some of the other reviews, I really believe you have to drink this beer out of the Perfect Pint glass from Sam Adams to really appreciate this beer."
"Overall I was not impressed. They seriously just cannot get anything done with fruit flavors anywhere near an acceptable level. I would not try this one again, as its just a waste of time for."
"D - This is an okay fruit beer. It isn't a regular in my fridge, though."
"I really don't know about this one, it was okay not great by any means. A touch too fruity for my standards, not over bearingly fruity but just enough for me to pass on this one. Over all I have had much worse as far as fruited beers go. Overall not too over powering but a little too much in a beer."
"I was very excited to try this beer. I thought that cherry and wheat would be a good mix and this lead to high hopes of something great. I poured it into the glass and took a whiff...nearly throwing up because of the cherry cough drop smell. The taste was very similar to the smell, reminiscent of cherry cough drops. I had the beer again after a year, hoping that the first bottle was just a bad batch, but the second taste was the same...cherry cough drops...probably a great brew to drink with a cold to supress the cough!"
"I make no apologies on this one... it may be okay for someone who is trying to break into craft beer.. but there is waay too much cherry (artificial) flavors to be enjoyable to me."
"Pours a clear golden, with a big white head. Smells of black cherry soda pop. Taste is sweet up front but finishes dry; flavors of maraschino cherries, and grain. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and carbonation high. Unfortunatly the drinkability suffers somewhat, the sweet taste definiately gets old after one beer. Also, any more fruit flavor and sugar, and this wouldnt taste much like beer. But, it is pretty good, and I wouldnt complain if I had it again."
"MF&D - A good thirst quencher/BBQ beer. A little too sweet to drink all the time, but it did wonders on the beach at the Jersey Shore."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Too sweet for my liking to enjoy multiple, but to try one, it was not that bad."
"Don't drink and review."
"The cherry flavor is not cloyingly sweet, but there is some natural sweetness to it that takes some getting used to. To me, the balance between the wheat, honey and cherry flavors work well together. Actually thought the cherry aroma was funkier than the taste. It's definitely not an everyday session brew, but a nice, change of pace on a warm summer day."
"Beer Its Not Just A Beverage Its Food-!"
"This is one of if not the best fruit beer I've had, but couldn't drink more than 2 back to back, too sweet towards the end of the bottle."
"Cleary one of the best fruit beers out there."
"D: Not recommended."
"D: Don't want to drink this beer as the bad cherry flavour comes out, didn't like it, avoid, Sam Adams' worst."
"Give it a try"
"Awful beer. Try to avoid this one!!"
"Pours a clear golden color. I half expected this one to be a little darker or cloudier. Strong scent of cherries up front and sweet wheat malts in the back. Not much in the way of hops. Slightly tart, sweet, and big cherry flavor. A god fruit beer, though I'm not a big fan of this style personally."
"The only reason this isn't a drain pour is because I'm going to pour the rest of the pint into some Tupperware to marinate meat in or make some kind of sauce. Ditto for the other bottle in the sampler."
"D- I had a six-pack a year ago and wasn't so fond of it, decided to give it another try. It seems very artificial. Though I have met people that love this brew. Perhaps if you are into cherries and want a semi-desert beer, or for someone that doesn't like beer"
"M + D: A happy point in between slightly sticky and semi-dry. Not finishing so dry, though, it does seem to get a little on the heavier side after a while. If I were enjoying Sam Adams on a warm summer afternoon, I'd likely be far more likely to go with one of their other offerings. This one is alright, but that's about it."
"Overall, not that great. Sam Adams usually does a great job on most of their beers, but this misses the mark. Put this one in the same boat as the cranberry lambic. That being said, I will agree that of all the fruit beers, cherry is without a doubt the hardest to pull off. Even using fresh organic cherries, it can still taste like cough syrup. This is better than average, but not quite up to the sublime cherry nirvana that is achieved by New Glarus. With some work, this beer could be great... Until then, I'll save this a my last beer out of the six pack when outside."
"Drinkability- I enjoyed this brew and can see myself drinking this again in the future, no problem."
"Perfect with a high quality dark chocolate. Try it with some Cacao Reserve, and I'll bet all the ratings go up!"
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass with a slight white head that disappears quickly leaving behind a light lacing. Very strong smell of cherry with a faint hint of the wheat on the back end. Taste has a little bitterness to go with the cherries that finishes with a faint spice and dryness. Good amount of carbonation dominates the mouth. I might be able to drink two but the sweetness and the carbonation would probably prevent me from having anymore."
"D-a dessert beer or maybe a good beer gateway beer."
"I just wish they'd tone it down a bit so that some other flavors had a chance to present themselves, then maybe the drinkability wouldn't suffer as much. Wheats don't seem to be this brewery's niche, though their White Ale is pretty decent."
"Might pair well with some fruit cheesecake but you would need to enjoy the smell of this beer."
"It's a bit milky, but not thick. Feels like a smoothie. This one is pretty nice overall. Nice balance; on the edge of over-sweetness. But a good summery wheat beer overall."
"D: When taking a long pull, the texture is almost creamy and rather enjoyable but the cherry sort of wears on me after a while. If you like the fruit, this isn't bad, well, it isn't bad anyway, but I guess I'm just not into the fruit unless it's a lambic."
"D - Wouldn't want more than one."
"D - The candy-like nature of this brew makes it less like a beer and more like a drier, off tasting soda. I might have a couple, but I wouldn't make a night of these; it's simply too intense and too simple."
"Overall: Not worth it. This is a Brewmaster's Collection? Whatever! This is a hobbyist experiment gone wrong, at best. I truly wish Sam Adams would take this out of what would be an outstanding Summer Variety pack. As it is, this one beer bruises the eye of their Summer pack. Boo! Sam Adams. Badly played."
"Not bad for a fruit beer, but the cherry flavor is a little cloying. I enjoyed drinking one, but I don't think I could really drink more than one in a sitting. However, in my limited experience with cherry beers, I've found the beer/cherry combination doesn't do a whole lot for me, unless it's incredibly subtle. I prefer beer that tastes like beer instead of jolly ranchers."
"I would not want more than one of these at a time."
"It has a light hazy body, pale golden color and a big thick white head. The aroma of cherries is very strong in this beer. There are some light malt flavors that are mostly covered up by the sweetness of the cherries and honey. The taste is good but the body doesn't really support the sweetness. Its light to medium bodied with soft carbonation and a smooth mouth feel. It's a very good looking and smelling beer but its balance is a little to sweet for me. However this may go well with a dark chocolate brownie. I think I will give that a try."
"D: It's not too sweet and doesn't really overpower you in any big way, but that said, it doesn't stand out a whole lot in its flavor, either. It's a nice change-of-pace beer, but not something I would session with or drink regularly."
"Pours a dark, slightly cloudy gold color, with a nice foamy head. Strong smell of artifical cherries. Taste is also full of cherry flavoring. I found it too sweet and artificial syrup tasting. Mouthfeel is a bit dry like a wheat beer should be. It seems that this is one you either really like, or really don't. Unfortunatley, not one of my favorites."
"Drinkability is good, but I think the cherry would get old after a while."
"Notes: A lot of talk regarding whether this is a chic beer. I suppose that many women do like fruit flavors,but a good beer is a good beer regardless of style. I do not prefer fruit/vegetable beers and yet I thought this would be a good alternative to a Corona on a hot summer day. I buy one from time to time and while this beer may not define or represent the manliness of the beer I normally drink it is fine for certain moments. I do not care to worry what the ""macho men"" seem to think. I drink for the experience and not the hang over."
"D - No doubt I could drink a few of these at a time. With my tour through the spring style beers, this is another good example of what would be very refreshing on a warm day."
"This was my biggest disappointment when it comes to Sam Adams. I hate to label it as a chick beer, but I fear it may be that. The cherries overpower any taste that a beer would have. To each his own, but this is not for me."
"D: I have mixed feelings about this one. If you like fruit beers, you might want to try this one. It's not bad, but I don't think I'll move it into the lineup."
"Edit ~ Upon further reviewing, I found out that cherry wheat does not settle well in the stomach when it follows a thick red, namely a St. Rouge Red."
"Drinkable as a faux-fruity-faux-fruit beer can be; if you like that kind of thing."
"Drinkability - tasty, I'm not a big Sam Adams fan, but this one worked for me"
"M&D- Feels like a pale ale, but the cough syrup flavor makes it more suitable to drink only 1 or 2."
"I enjoy this beer as it is not as sweet as a lot of the fruit infused beers on the market. I actually enjoyed the ale in the very Sam Adam'=s glass that was ever so generously sent to me from the Sam Adams brewery for being a founding member of the great Beer Advocate magazine. Cheers! The wheaty taste and hint of black cherries made it very quaffable as a light after dinner ""dessert"" drink."
"this beer is incredibly easy to drink, the taste is definately cherry, almost like luden's cough drops in beer form. which can be a plus or minus, depending on who you are. this is definately an easier drink to have but in no means is any form of a ""manly man"" beer, but its good, however for fruit beers i wouldnt put it in my top 10. its a good beer to try out, but after 2 the taste gets alittle too much for me."
"Drinkability is fairly low. Low alcohol makes for easy consumption, but strong cherry flavor becomes taxing."
"A beer for lovers of fruit and sweetness. Hop fans may want to look elsewhere. Sorry to gush. Great with desserts or just to add a sweet counterpart to a meal."
"I am giving this beer a better review than I think I should. Mainly because I think it will fill a good void of giving me the drink I need when I am not in the mood for a stronger beer. It is very drinkable for one or two bottles."
"This beer is a mediocre wheat beer with lots of cherry flavoring. It pours a golden amber color with some head and retention, and a hint of red, probably from the copious quantity of cherry thrown in here. The lacing is modest. The smell is all cherry, perhaps a smidgen of strawberry, vanilla, and almond. As the beer settles, there is some grainy wheat hints that pop through. This is a moderately carbonated, light bodied, fairly simple beer that just smacks of cherry and not much else. Cherry soda is not far off the mark with this one. Hops? I'm still looking for them. I've had plenty of Lambics, and this one is just not in the same league. It's an okay, somewhat change a pace type beer, that is a novelty. Would I buy it or try it again? No, but that does not mean it isn't worth a try. I wouldn't go particularly out of the way to find it, however. The aftertaste is thin, and it really has a pretty flat finish. What else can one say about an entirely average beer. It does smell nice though."
"D - Enjoyable beer. A little sweet, but probably intended this way. Tastes much better than it smells. Good session beer if you can get past the overwhelming aroma. Drinkability is a 3.0 only because it's really difficult for me to get past the smell every time I take a drink."
"Too heavy for light style-not quite natural-better options in this space"
"I used to really, really hate this one. I pretty much still do. There's a plethora of fruit beers that I enjoy, some even with cherry flavouring, but this one just does not work on any level save for a very nice appearance. This beer needs to be seriously reworked. Stay away."
"D: Drinkability was like a cherry 7-up. Pass on this one."
"Do give it a try."
"My friend's mother also tried this out to, whom doesn't really drink beer outside of Bud. She said it tasted like Cherry Pepsi. I would say this could appeal to casual beer drinkers, but is a ""meh"" pick for veteran beer drinkers."
"D - As far as fruit beers go, this is probably one of the best commercial beer available (that's not a lambic or lambic variant - way different ballgame). It has a nice fruit flavor but isn't cloying and has a nice strong beer base backing it - enjoyable anytime of year."
"Golden amber colored pour. Smell is big maraschino cherry flavor, and even though I don't normally like the artificially cherry-like smell, I kind of liked enjoyed the smell as it mixed with the light wheatiness. Taste was similar but a slightly more subdued cherry flavor, although it is still quite noticeable, as is the wheat. Maybe a bit thin on the palate overall, but this is something I'd drink again, and still like just as much as before I became somewhat choosy about my beers."
"D - Very easy to drink. Went down like a soda, I could pound these on a really hot day in the summer. But I fear my mommy would yell me at and wind up with a tummy ache."
"D: I drank this one slowly and sort of regretted ordering it."
"This is a very fruity beer with a powerful scent of cherries. It has a rich flavor of wheat malt and cherries noticeable in every sip. It's taste would best accompany a cooked sandwich or hamburger being sweet and fruity. The feel is bubbly on the tongue. It is an ok beer but not one I'd drink more then one of in a sitting."
"D- I could maybe drink two of these in a sitting. I enjoy the taste but the amount of fruit would make me want a change"
"Drinkability - Excellent beer to quaff down several in a sitting. Probably more resigned to spring/summer months though as opposed to winter. But none the less, I would recommend it to try."
"My wife like it so I'd consider getting a six pack (and having her drink 5) but for the most part I'll only get a single every couple of years. There are better Sam Adams beers and better flavored beers (i.e. Southern Tier's Pumpking)."
"Taste has hints of cherries, but is not overwhelming for a fruit beer, decent malt presence, some bitterness in the aftertaste. Could have used more balance though, the tartness and the bitterness seemed to conflict."
"This is a pretty good and refreshing fruit beer. The beer pours very nicely with a light amber color topped by a thin, dense silky white head that remained throughout drinking it. It smelled of fresh wild cherries. The taste was quite crisp with strong wild cherry flavor and underlying wheat malt. The cherry flavor is the star of the show here. This would be a good dessert beer every once and a while, but I wouldn't want it every day."
"It's a decent change of pace, and cherry lovers will dance in the streets everywhere with this. I, however, wished for balance that was ultimately unrequited."
"Notes: It's a fruit beer, so some people are going to like this beer, and some people aren't. I'd say it would be a decent beer to try once, or maybe a good desert beer, or something to go along with a salad. Still for what it's trying to pull off, it does fairly well. It's a bland wheat ale that's flavored with cherries, readily available."
"Pours a nice red-tinged golden color, with good head, but not so much lacing. Has an excellent crips scent, straw-like with great fruit overtones. A great taste, too, although maybe a little overboard on the cherry. Still, a great fruited wheat beer, clean and crisp with a nice blending of the fruit. Goes down fine, would never say no to another."
"This was all right. There is a real cherry background to it which I kind of liked. But it never really developed much complexity to it. The wheat beer behind the cherry flavor was all right too, but when mixed together, it didn't really go anywhere. The beer and cherry flavors did not seem to complement each other as well as they could have. I don't regret trying it, but I won't be buying a 6-pack."
"I do not normally like fruit beers, but this was a part of a mix pack, and I gave it a try. I am pleasantly surprised. I have even had this very beer before and not liked it, but I like it this time. Might be the glass - .5 liter wheat beer glass. This helps taste the cherry, which may be a tad too much."
"A great beer to pair with dessert. Nice job BBC."
"Drinkability is ok I could drink a few of these during the winter and probably enjoy them, but I wouldn't say that this will become one of my regulars."
"I have a 6-pack to kill. I think I'll take my time with it."
"Dark golden/amber ale, small dissapearing off white head. Strong cherry cough medicine aroma, not bad at this time of year! After a while the harsh medicinal tone goes and it has a scent of glazed cherries. Pretty straighforward taste, cherry dominates, but not as sweet as the nose might lead one to believe. Actually gets a wee bit bitter on the end, like cherry pits. Mouthfeel is thin, and its only the pleasing carbonation that stops it being downright watery. What can I say, a pleasant enough drink, better in hotter weather."
"I'm generally fine with most of the Sam Adams products, especially those that are a little out of the ordinary i.e. imperial pilsner. However, their Cherry Wheat misses the mark. The look is fine - nice, golden color with a nice white head that leaves some lacing. The smell is not so great - maraschino cherry syrup; very sweet and cloying. The taste is not so cloying, but still nothing good - too sweet when there should be some tartness. Mouthfeel is like soda bordering on harsh. Yeah, this isn't my cup of tea, but I could see people enjoying this one. It's like beer, but not. Recommendation to avoid."
"I'd rather drink King Cobra, good lord."
"Great with Spicy Wings!!!"
"Overall, a pretty decent fruit beer. Not being a big fan of the style, I liked this SA addition. I don;t think I could take down a whole 6-pack, and at 5.2%, it's not the fruit beer you take very lightly. It can sneak up on you, so I recommend it for its sneakiness."
"The color is a light amber that is a little cloudy and has some hints of an orange tint to it as well. It definitely is a beer that smells like cherries mixed with a little bit of a hoppy smell. Also the cherry smells remind me of maraschinos or those luden's cough drops. The taste is alright as one can taste some kind of cherry taste mixed in but it is not too prevalent. The aftertaste is a bit similar to what one would get from drinking a cherry coke which is a light cherry taste lingering on the tongue. Overall, it is an average beer and at least it is not too fruity. One can tell that this is a beer and not some kind of malt beverage, which is nice. My biggest complaint would be that there does not really seem to be a balance between the hops and the cherries too much. Sometimes it almost seems like the two flavors are clashing with each other."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: I could have a few of thes but I think that I would get tired of them quick. I do however, think they would be good with a nice cigar."
"Average drinkability on this one. It's an interesting beer, but I wouldn't want to drink much of it. It's a little too sweet to be sessionable. It would be a good special occasion desert beer."
"First of all I would like to say I'm going to be very open minded with any review that I do knowing that everyone has their dislikes and likes. I would like to start out by saying for a 5.35% alcohol content beer this is a very good choice to get with the ladys as it is smooth and lacks that overall beer taste alot of woman despise. I am reviewing this as a flavored beer cause thats what it is. If your not the flavor beer kind of person don't waste your time purchasing this. I think the smell of this beers is amazing smelling of cherrys of course. The head is really thick and just perfect. The taste is very smooth cherry taste with a faint wheat flavor with no sign of any alcohol taste around I was surprised to find out its alcohol content. Overall I think this beer is a excellent choice best flavored beer I've ever had. Samuel Adams has always been my favorite beer company and they have not failed me on this one."
"The bottom line: The smell on this gave me hope, the flavour took it away. I like fruit and vegetable beers, but this one just has something wonky going on in the flavour department. A disappointment."
"D - Null for me on this one, I'm not entirely certain I can even finish one. Maybe if Cherry 7-Up is your favorite soda, and you've been dying to try an alcoholic version, this will be for you, otherwise, I do not recommend it."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer was a golden color with a little cloudiness (not transparent) and had a nice 3/4 inch head that lasted for most of the glass. This has an overwhelming smell of sweet cherries. Upon my first sip I could taste the cherries I had smelled, but was surprised at the bitter bite the brew had. There was subtle hints of spice, but I could not get past the bitter taste in my mouth, not what I was expecting. It had decent carbonation and more weight than a light beer had. I cannot figure what the after taste is, but I do not like it--almost to the point of not drinking any more of the six-pack my wife bought for me to try. This is an interesting beer to try, but not one I will make any repeat purchases of."
"I am sure that this otherwise perfect brewery has to be a little disappointed in this one"
"Generally, I do not enjoy fruit flavored beers. But this beer and Saranac's Pomegranate Wheat are the two major fruit flavored beers that do it for me. Try this underrated Sam Adams if you enjoy fruit beers."
"The cherry flavor is very evident, and the wheat hangs around the edges. The mouthfeel is smooth throughout, with a slightly harsher finish. The balance of sweet and bitter is skewed slightly toward the former but not overly so, giving it an appealling taste throughout each sip. The almond nose gives it an extra nuance each time, and together the flavors and aroma provide an overall rather refreshing beer."
"This is one excellent beer that is always a nice sweet break from bitter beers once in a while. It pours an excellent amber color with a nice white head. The body even looks a little cherry-ish. The aroma is of sweet malts and cherries. The taste is just that - sweet malts and cherries, but like the candy kinds of cherries. It really is a nice taste and it almost doesn't even taste like a beer. It gets a more beery taste when it warms up a bit, but other than that, this beer is pretty much cherries. Great aftertaste and excellent mouthfeel. Try this beer, it is definately worth a shot."
"This beer pours a medium dark yellow. Very little head. Smell of this beer is ok, with just a hit of wheat and cherry. The taste of this beer is what sold me on it. The cherry shines through, but at the same time is not to over powering or sweet. The cherry stays with it all the way through the palate. And the wheat gives it balance. Mouthfeel is average, a bit on the light side. Drinkability is a tough call, while it is very drinkable, I think that I have to be in the right mood to drink it. I think sometimes it would seem great and just what I want. Other times I could see only having one, and switching quickly. That said I think it is worth a try, and would buy it again."
"D- yeah but the cherry annoys me after a while. a good contender for this style, i only wish everyone could use real fruit instead of flavor syrups."
"D- Good for a couple beers only. I dont think drinking an entire sixer of this is doable. You will be over it after a beer or two. But all in all, a must try."
"The mouth seems just about average. Drinkabilty is a tougher call for me. Would I drink this all night, no. Would I drink this one once and a while, sure!"
"Got this 6-pack at Walsh's in Brighton, MA after a recommendation from a friend. Cracked open a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Moderate to little head with gentler poor. Attractive brown almost red hint. Smelled amazing. I don't believe I've ever given a 5 for smell, but this definitely warrants a 5. Sweet cherries, hops, and sweet malts. Taste was great. Nice cherry taste without being too overwhelming or sweet, but still present. Sweet malts and hops follow behind, but the cherry flavor will be the most memorable taste. Only downfall of this beer is that because of its sweet nature, it's drinkability is severely decreased. Would not be able to get more than two down in one sitting, let alone session with it. Overall, delicious beer, give it a try. If nothing else, it acts as a great gateway for crossovers from macros to craft."
"Not a very drinkable beer."
"Not very drinkable, taste is hard to deal with and it is pretty heavy to along with that"
"Unfortunately, this one was a disappointment."
"I'm finding it hard to get past the bitter metal taste of this beer. Definitely not going to be a favorite of mine.."
"Overall if you are seeking for a ""liquid dessert"" this might hit the spot but not something to drink the whole night."
"Drinkability- This isn't a bad beer at all. You can really taste the cherries and the crispness of it makes it a nice beer to have when its hot outside."
"This was a disappointment. Glad I only bought one."
"Wheat they had last winter. It seems a touch out of balance."
"This beer is fake and flabby and not my style. I also feel it is overcarbonated as well. The flavors do persist at the end. Overall, this is not for me. It is everything that is wrong with fruit beer."
"sam adams for the win!"
"Overall, a decent, drinkable cherry beer, and something I'd drink again, but nothing amazing. I've brewed with real cherries, and canned, and cherry flavoring (from Steinbart, I think.) Cherries are tough to brew with, and not get a cough syrup result from, and Spam has done pretty well with this one. I'm more impressed than I thought I'd be."
"Average, not one of Sams Adams best, not really all that drinkable. I could have one or two at the most. A little too much cherry sweetness for my palate, but overall not bad. Did smell good, however. Mouthfeel was pleasant. Not much lacing on glass."
"Clear robust gold color with a soft, sticky, milky looking head. Aroma is sweet cherry juice holding back any malts trying to sneak through and a hint of butterscotch in the way back. Upon the first sip, there is a striking lack of anything. The aroma has me anticipating a syrupy mess and what I get is...blandness. I suppose its better than a sloppy, cough-syrupy, artificial fruit beer. At least I can drink this. The palest of light malts, a faint sweetness, and watered down cherries. Its crisp and refreshing, not a bad body for a summery beer, but its almost as if the mouthfeel is more in focus than the flavor. Good if you're doing things out in the sun and using beer purely for refreshment. At least its not as unpleasant as I remember it being."
"Mouthfeel is light."
"Obvious cherry nose and faint hint of wheat and hops. Pours light amber color with almost no head. Extreem cherry taste with some maltiness and hint of wheat that is quickly offset by a jolly rancher like taste, initially it throws you off because it doesnt taste like any other beer ive ever had. It really taste like some sort of soda."
"I've had these before and it's a nice change if you like the fruit flavored beers."
"I'm not sure I would recognize this offering as beer rather than soda in a blind test (well maybe the alcohol would tip me off, but even so). The taste is a cloying cherry punch with perhaps a dusting of wheat flour, but only a dusting. The smell reveled the one-dimensionality of this before I even had a swig. And the mouthfeel was syrupy and lightly carbonated, like a soda. Not recommended."
"I'm going to get a few more before the end of Summer."
"D-For what it is it isn't awful but not really my cup of tea. I would like a little more than cherries"
"I've heard pretty good things about Sam Adams beers, so I won't let this beer discourage me from trying the others, but this one is pretty nasty!"
"It seems that the Cherry Wheat I remember from college tasted like a beer with a cherry finish, but now it seems to be all cherry. I will pass on this."
"Mediocre wheat + Dr. Pepper + cough drop = unsatisfactory. Sam Adams does a whole lot of things right. Better than right. This is not one of them. Hell, give me the Cranberry Lambic instead."
"Pours a one finger tan head over a crystal clear bright light orange liquid. Smells of marchiano cherry. Sweet and preserved fruity. Tastes rather unpleasant. Marchiano cherry meets jelly belly in a carbonated beverage. Syrupy cough medicine flavor with a very odd end/aftertaste. Cherry is in the flavor line of cherry cola. Carbonation on the tongue in the aftertaste can get rid of the cherry flavor, but does dry out the beer a bit. Medium body, but thick in a syrupy way that makes me wonder about how the cherry flavor was imparted. Md-heavy carbonation. This was a dumper. Blech."
""
"D-Not for me....If I want a cherry cough drop I'll suck on one....I think Sammy does a nice job with their beers for the most part but this one needs to be reworked or eliminated..."
"This is my first fruit beer I've ever tasted. I could enjoy a few of these.This beer is good, but I still have this sense that there may be a few too many cherries in the brew."
"The mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy but is lightened a bit by moderate carbonation. A nice summer brew. Not the best fruit beer I've had by any stretch of the imagination, but not as bad as many people insist. A quality product."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a very slight hue of amber, white head that dissipated into a small cap. The smell is of a cherry bomb. Smells like a cherry cough drop, artificial. I never smelled actual cherries that were this strong before. The taste is metallic, watered down cherry NyQuil, a touch of honey. The cherry takes over the whole flavor palate. The feel is ok, its light and fairly crisp. I used to like this beer a whole lot more back in the day but after trying many more beers that are out there, this doesn't stack up. The cherry taste is too artificial and strong, should be more subtle."
"White to off-white head which settled down but has good lacing. Beer itself is clear gold. There's clearly cherry in the smell and a mild honey sweetness underneath. No discernible hops on this one. Cherry's also in the taste, but unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find it overly sweet. Some honey fills in toward the end. I did expect a bit more crispness from the wheat in this beer, so that was a bit of a disappointment. I was also hoping it would be unfiltered (the yeast would add to the flavor profile.), but ah well. this is more of a honey ale than a honey wheat. Mouthfeel was soft and medium bodied with low carbonation. I'd likely turn elsewhere after drinking one of these. Compared with other S.A. beers, this is not what I expect."
"Overall this is not a very drinkable beer, it borders on alcopop, it would be nice if the good people at SA would reformulate this or remove it altogether from it's fine line of brews."
"Poured from a 12 oz glass with November 2007 best-by date. Poured into a hefeweizen glass. Slightly hazy golden color with a foamy white head. Looks picture-perfect. Great retention. Smells of sweet cherries and honey. Flavors of the cherries, wheat, touch of honey. Not too complex, but still nice and clean to drink. Light-bodied mouthfeel. Very easily drinkable. Great summer beer."
"The first beer that got me into the hobby. Great beer for summer cookouts and for casual drinking. Smell is great, fruity, but not overpowering. Very drinkable beer, i could sip on these all day and still not get sick of it. Not the best beer ive had but defiantly a good one."
"Drinkability: sorry, but not very drinkable, at least for me. I didn't appreciate the metallic wang and the general impression was that I was taking down a spoonful of Robitussin with every pull from my pint glass. Nothing here that I'm eager to revisit anytime soon."
"This is one of my staple summer beers since I first got the nerve to drink any beer with fruit flavoring quite a few years ago. This and #9 are my never fail fruit beers. I know these in no way compare to some of the hard core european fruit offerings, and well they shouldn't. This is closer to the mow the lawn beer and they go down so easy. The color is almost straw with a hint of copper tone. The head is fair and lively, not much lacing. The aroma is a beautiful cherry blended with a bit of cereal/wheat as one might expect. It smells crisp and it tastes much the same. A light and refreshing wash of pilsner-like flavor laced with a decided cherry sweetness. Somewhat dry but also a bit watery for a quenching libation that finishes with a tasteful tartness. Nothing very complex and easy to drink many. This is my light beer, vaguely soda-esque, but it retains it's beer integrity in my book. May be too soda like for some beer fans but it works for me."
"If you don't like the aroma try drinking it from the bottle."
"D: A good but not great beer, I'd say Blue Moon is better than this, but a pretty interesting offering if just a bit gimmicky. Would not pick this one up on a regular basis."
"Sampled at The Spot in Bethel, cherry wheat looks really nice in the glass nice hazy gold with a great head and lacing. The smell is a little too fruity I would have maybe liked more malty balance. Same goes for the taste cherry flavor is somewhat artificial tasting and too sweet. Sweet aftertaste hurts mouthfeel and drinkability as well. Not an awful beer but definitely not an award winner either."
"Part of the summer sampler 12 pack. Decent beer. Gold color with a medium head. Aroma just gave off a little sweetness. The cherry came through, thankfully, on the taste. Pleasantly sour. The label says it is crisp, and I would agree with that assessment. Refreshing, but there are a lot of other beers that fit that category."
"Recommended"
"Not sure I'd buy this one again, and I'm a fan of every other Sam Adams product I've tried thus far."
"Not recommended, but the apperance is good."
"Eric"
"Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are mid stream all the way"
"D: Not for me. The fake cherry flavor puts me off way too fast. Somethings amiss here..."
"This is one of my favorite beers. Aroma is strong; cherry scent is dominant. Color is deep golden honey-amber. Flavor is malty and pleasant, with a strong cherry overtone and wheaty components. Finish is smooth and pleasant. I am fond of cherries, which is one reason I like this particular beer."
"This beer is a nice change from the everyday domestic beers.No heavy carbonation and it doesn't have that watery finish of some beers.Good aftertaste of cherries no bitterness. I will drink this beer again!!! Highly recommended!! Just remember to bring a little spare cash with you."
"I'll finish my sixer, but with no great enjoyment."
"Wow, Sam Adams made a mistake in judgment here. The taste is like cough syrup. Not syrupy, but watered down, carbonated cough syrup. Very bad brew. I wouldn't try it again even if it was the only thing available. I'd rather drink water or a soda."
"Pours a golden color with a faint haze. Maintains a creamy white head with decent lacing. The nose is dominated by a pleasing cherry aroma. A faint cherry bitterness is balanced out by a malt sweetness. While the nose is relatively fresh, the taste is of cherry cough drops. The initial sweetness on the tongue is quickly banished by dry, bland wheat. The wheat and cherry cough drop flavors are unable to blend together and both stick around long into the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy with a bit of water in the background. The mouthfeel and lack of any cloying sweetness allow me to finish the beer, but I certainly won't be having it again."
"Part of the Sam Adams summer pack. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a clear copper, forming a creamy 2 inch head, leaving medium rings of lace along the glass. The aroma is just like a blackcherry soda. This might be a turn-off to some, but I think it smells great! The taste is a little less strong, but not a disappointment. Cherry flavor mixed in with a light wheat ale. Thats about it. Simple but enjoyable. Light smooth mouthfeel and finish. Easy to drink. Overall, I actually enjoyed this brew. While I'm not sure if I could drink a sixer of this, I could see having one or two throughout the night. Definitely worth a try. I'm curious to try some of the mixes that people use with this beer."
""
"Part of the Summer beers mixed 12 pack.The beer poured a clear golden amber color. A big fluffy one inch head which slowly fades to a leave just a little lacing. Aroma is of sweet cherries and little else. Taste is of tart cherries and sweet malt. A bit too sweet for me but not bad for a flavored wheat beer.."
"overall, this is not a beer that I will seek out again, its way too sweet in my opinion"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and very well carbonated. I personally don't like the taste very much, so I find it's drinkability extremely limited. Overall, it's a very average beer. One of the weakest Sam Adams offerings in my opinion."
"I love wheat beers but this was a let down. Pours a clear golden color, others are talking about a cloudy pour, I had none of that, clearest wheat beer I've ever seen. 2 finger head stuck around a while leave small amounts of lace. Smells like cough syrup and I cant get over that. Taste is much better than the smell. Pretty crisp with hint of cherries and some hops. Moderate carbonation gives it a medium-light mouthfeel. Could possibly have another, but not interested in anymore. Just cant get over the smell!"
"drinkability - I was surprised. I thought it was going to be sweet and I wouldn't like it. I loved it. Not sure if I could drink a lot of these those. You'll laugh, but it reminds me of Captain Crunch Berry Cereal. lol"
"I'm going to have to give up on fruit beers. Opening the bottle I was overwhelmed with the smell of cherry cough syrup. The pour was ok, nice hazy reddish amber color. All I could taste was artificial cough syrup cherry flavor. Mouthfeel seemed ok but this is a beer that I could not finish."
"D - Looks good, smells..good...but this beer has very little taste to it."
"It poured a golden color with a very slight pink tinge. Lots of head that was very aromatic- no mistaking the cherry in this one. Taste was almost like watered-down cherry Kool-Aid, but the wheatiness saved it from tasting flat. Light mouthfeel that still feels like it needs to be savored due to the fruity tones. Very drinkable and goes down easy. No hoppy aftertaste and very refreshing. This would be fantastic for a summer beer or for trying to get fruity cocktail-loving friends into beer."
"D - Nice Cherry flavor but not overwhelming. Very good for a fruit flavored beer."
"Drinkability: I was expecting the worst, but found this to be not so bad. It's drinkable, I am glad I only have the two. It would take too long to drink a six pack as I quickly get tired of this."
"Would definitely drink more of these in a sitting!"
"this beer is incredibly easy to drink, the taste is definately cherry, almost like luden's cough drops in beer form. which can be a plus or minus, depending on who you are. this is definately an easier drink to have but in no means is any form of a ""manly man"" beer, but its good, however for fruit beers i wouldnt put it in my top 10. its a good beer to try out, but after 2 the taste gets alittle too much for me."
"Now don't get my wrong I never had this one before and I thought it would good, I just won't drink it again. But the thing is my girlfriend loved it..."
"D- No problem drinking this one, and I could see myself sessioning this a bit as well, though the cherry might be overwhelming after a couple."
"D: Again, I will admit I am normally not a fan of this style of brew. However, the BBC has done a good job for the style, as the cherry flavor isn't overdone, and it's actually fairly refreshing brew."
"Smells almost overpoweringly of cherry, but personally thats fine. Nice color and head, with decent retention. The taste of the wheat beer mixed perfectly with the cherry. Alot of fruit beers taste too much of beer, not enough of fruit. This beer does a good job of balancing the two. Leaves a fine after taste, and mixes well with most kinds of foods."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: I find the light body and moderate levels of carbonation to be appropriate for this style. Nothing too special in the mouthfeel. In my opinion it would be hard to drink more than one of these back-to-back. The cherry flavor is too strong, overpowering. This brew is more juice-like than beer-like. This is one fruit beer that I can see being refreshing on an extremely hot day, however I think that it is just too much cherry in this brew for it to be drunk on any other type of day. I'll probably not be buying this again, there are much better fruit beers out there."
"this beer smells like a cherry bomb. I guess that is good if your are into frutity beers or whatever. But its not really for me. The taste was also very cherrific. However, I did notice a wheat flavor too it that I liked somewhat. I can not drink SA's cranberry lambic but this is I can stand to a degree or two. It finishes secent enough and has a an alright mouthfeel. Not my first choice but ok."
"Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat was copper in color with a white head. The head had decent retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was mostly cherries. The taste was cherries with some light malt. It was sweet upfront with a dry finish. It was medium-light in body with plenty of carbonation. Drinkabilty was average. It's a decent beer that pairs well with a fruity dessert."
"On tap poured into a pint glass, pours an golden copper color with a large amount of carbonation flowing in the glass. Smell is of strong cherries in the nose also a bit of roasted character. Taste is actually pretty good, imo this beer is better on tap it has a malty character to it more than it has that cherry taste, it was very good and a bit chewy and made me want to eat a good meal. I could drink this on tap all day long it went down smooth and I could drink this all day long, unlike other fruity beers that I could only tolerate a few of."
"Na Zdrowie!"
"Had this one a couple years back and wasn't very impressed with the strong cherry flavor (without much else). Appearance is amber-copper color, a little bit of head. Nose is all cherry. Taste is likewise mostly cherry, only I didn't find it offensive or jarring like I did initially (although the buddy of mine who also got a bottle thought it was crap). Seriously, there's not much else I can say about the flavor, other than that it is fairly fruity and sweet, almost like juice. Feel is medium bodied, with good carbonation. Overall, not particularly complex and only for those who like fruit juice."
"Pours out an apricot color with a good deal of carbonation in the body and a huge, creamy head with dimples all along the top. As the head slowly recedes, it leaves thick, raised lacing on the glass. The aroma is a big punch of maraschino cherries with some backing wheatiness. Not much else. Cherry flavor tastes too artificial and with a nutrasweet like flavor. The wheat and grain come trough a bit, but the cherry flavoring is too much. Mouthfeel is kind of fulsome with barely any carbonation felt on the tongue, despite the appearance of moderate carbonation. Too flat feeling. I'll manage to finish the bottle, but it will be reminiscent of a chore."
"This brew poured to a slightly hazy golden color with a good sized white head that had good retention and left a good amount of lacing, over all it is a good looking brew. The aroma screams cherries, to be frank that is really all I am picking up, they give off a very sweet scent that to me seems too much. The flavor again seems to be all about the cherries which in my opinion are way over the top. It almost has a cherry coke flavor to it. If you thought the nose had a strong cherry presence, you havent seen anything yet! I suppose that some folks might enjoy such a brew but the cherry flavor seems to be way out of balance with a slight artificial taste. To me this one is not a keeper, would like to have something different in the summer mix pack."
"This beer pours a light pale color. Aroma is similar to cherry coke and cherries in general, which isn't bad because it does live up to it's name in aroma. The taste has a strong cherry essence with some hints of wheat in the background. Again, perhaps too sweet or too heavy on the strawberry. Still a well balanced beer that I feel is worthier than other styles attempted by SA."
"Taste seems tailored to foo-foo fruit alcopop drinkers. There's a sort of cherry bubblegum over top of cherry frosted, slightly undercooked cherry cake. Hops? Who knows! Wheat? Could be anywhere! The flavor isn't off-putting, but it's almost as if the brewery aimed to make liquid confectionaries. A silly, laughable beer that I'm almost embarassed to have tried."
"OK, this one was bad bad bad. Tastes like discount cherry soda mixed with beer, or cough drops. Sam Adams was 6 bucks a 6 pack if you bought two 6 packs, so I picked up a case of this stuff. I would have rather had spent that 6 bucks on a 40 of Old English 800. Yes, this beer is that bad. If you want something fruity, buy cider or a malt beverage like Smirnoff Ice. This beer should not exist."
"Drinkability: nice; i could put down a few of these in a night"
"Pours a four-finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium bodied and light carbonation. Strong cherry nose. Flavor is all cherry and no wheat, clean finish. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Overall, not bad for a fruit beer. I would have preferred a little more cherry flavor versus aroma, and stronger hops and mouthfeel. Not a bad beer by my standards."
"The wheat notes are more evident in the sip than the smell, especially in the aftertaste, although a bit cloying in the finish and the whole thing is masked in strong fake cherry syrup. Mouthfeel is nice and keeps this beer tolerable. I could see drinking one as a change of pace or on a hot day but probably wouldn't look for a sixer; too sweet and un-natural tasting."
"Before I drank beer, I remember having a roomate who raved that this was his favorite beer, and he truly missed it after having stopped drinking for a while...so I've wanted to try it, and I've stumbled across a freebie, so here goes. It's a pale color when a foamy head and is slightly cloudy due to the less-than filtered wheat style, I'm assuming. Looks good. Smells really delicious, like a fruit beer should, and was appealing to those who aren't beer purists in particular, as it smells legitimately fruity. I dug the aroma of cherry's being so strong and not seeming too artificial. The taste tough - up front its good, but right away I taste medicinal cherry cough syrup. I can't taste anything else after that, either. It's tart and not a sugar bomb, but not noticably hoppy...It's hard to want to call this a beer to be honest. You'll love it or you'll hate it as is. Not all that beer like, which is not necessarily a negative. But in taste alone (thinking of it as a desert drink), I couldn't enjoy this. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, not watery or light-beer like, but nothing full as other wheat beers. I wouldn't drink this again honestly...unless there was absolutely nothing else around, and I imagine there would be long periods of time between sips to help me forget just how medicinal it is, only to take another sip, remember...and not come back to it for a while or put it down unfinished. YMMV, but I cant get into it. Nice try, Sam."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Very easy to drink, but the artificial cherry notes may start to get to you after a couple or three."
"This beer pours a honey clear brown with many bubbles. The thick white foam head lasts a long time, never fully disappearing, leaving think lacing behind. The small is too sweet; it smells like cherry syrup, with only a subtle hint of beer at all. The taste on the other hand is great: not too sweet and with only a hint of cherries. The mouth feel is full but not creamy, very refreshing and easy to drink. The bubbles are not really present in the mouth feel that much."
"I am normally opposed to the idea of ""fruity"" beers but this one was done very nicely. The smell is really sweet however the flavor is not too sweet. Unlike some other fruity beers you can still taste the beers in this Sam Adams. It was easy to drink but I can't see myself buying it a lot just because you have to be in the right mood for it."
"I do know that others simply love this beer so if you have not tried it for yourself, you should, especially if you can find a single as I did."
"When poured it had a golden carmel color with a white rocky head that left nice lacing. It has a strong sweet cherry odor and once you can get past that you actually can smell the wheat. The cherry taste was not as strong as the smell and I could taste the wheat. Not my favorite flavor. I'm not a big fruit beer drinker. I have had the boisenberry wheat from the Sam Adams homebrew collection and I thought that was a better beer. Cherry Wheat is a smooth beer with not a whole lot of carbonation. I put average for drinkability because I think it is what it is. I taste cherry and I taste wheat. Its not my cup of tea but I can see how others might enjoy this."
"Definitely worth a try. On a hot summer day, would be really refreshing out on the patio."
"Flavor is more of the cherry, no hop presence or real malt backbone. It's a little thin and watery, the malt isn't too great, but the cherry flavor is quite sweet, unique, and tasty. Not to sugary, a little diacetyl, but a very solid fruit beer overall."
"first i would like to say i'm not a real big fan of sam adams beers and i have seen this beer many times and have passed it up. i was very leery to buy it but i was surprised and glad i did. poured a honey amber color with a three finger off white head with good retention and nice patchy lace to the finish. nice fruity cherry aromas with a taste of maraschino cherrys, sweet but not cloying on the palate. mouthfeel medium and smooth and carbonation is ok. drank five for the review and enjoyed every one."
"It goes down like water, making this a beer to drink a steamy summer day, when you're too hot to really pay too much attention to what you're drinking."
"Overall, this is a beer made with non-beer-drinkers in mind. The cherry flavor overpowers the beer flavor, but it's still not a bad beer."
"Feels a bit thick, not as crisp as I would have liked. Probably will not intentionally have again, but will drink it."
"This beer starts with a 4 finger head, that goes away after a while. The smell is very strong of cherry, which i guess is the point, but is almost overpowering. It almost tastes like a a cross between a wheat beer and a melted cherry slushy. Its hard to reallly describe the taste, its a must try if only to understand the flavor. I agree with the last reviewer that this beer is probably for non-beer drinkers or those who like lambic beers. I personally am not fond of the cherry flavor either but its definatly a different and interesting beer."
"I am not a fan of cherries, but I had heard good things about his beer, so I gave it a try. First off, the artificial cherry smell has got to go, whether you like cherries or not. If the cherries aren't enough to make it into the aroma, the beer shouldn't have to smell like Kool-Aid. This beer was very drinkable, but I think it is definitely one for non-beer drinkers. This beer would have been much better without the cherries."
"This is well below Samuel Adams' standards."
"Drinkability- above average drinkability. The beer tastes and smells good but its one to be drank in small doses."
"Hurray for cherry beer. Not the greatest, but definitely not bad. Refreshing and fairly light. I like that it is not red, i.e. no food coloring."
"Same cherry taste as a kriek, but without the sweetness. Much drier. Wheat? Can't find it. But really what you would expect from a cherry beer. Although the cherry is really present, the taste still is that of beer rather than fruit. I like it. This one would work very well on a hot summer day. I'm impressed that he cherry taste can be so dominant without leaving a sticky sweetness in your mouth."
"D- I enjoyed the combination of wheat ale and cherry and overall I would suggest this drink for those who prefer to be experimental in their beer selection."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy enough, slightly filling, I thought this beer wouldnt be that great considering how bad the Cranberry Lambic is, but Ill admit that I was pleasantly surprised. Its one of the better beers that Ive had within the style, but I wouldnt want to drink more than one or two if there were something else available, especially since a given place that would have this beer on-tap will typically have Sam Adams Seasonal among others."
"Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat pours a very light copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a strong cherry aroma, reminiscent of a maraschino cherry. The flavor is better than the aroma, it is not cloyingly sweet as the aroma might suggest, but the cherry flavor is strong and the finish is all wheat, which I like in this type of beer. This isn't really my thing, but I think it's a bit better than average, but not outstanding. Worth a try if you like this sort of thing."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a large and fluffy white head. Surprisingly good retention and lacing. Large and sweet aromas of cherry floats to the nose and not much else. Cherry taste is more subdued than in the aroma. Cherries and cream comes to mind, theres also a bit of grain and wheat but the cherry flavor dominates. Overall a tasty and drinkable beer, I found this sessionable but certainly more so in the summer-time. But still a good go for one or two during winter."
"Very drinkable beer and, again, highly reccommended. A nice, fun enjoyable beer that seems like it can go with anything. However, it seems more like a summer beer since it is lighter in character so I reccommend waiting for the temperature to rise for this brew to be at its finest."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Pours a clear pale golden amber color with a moderate white head. Nose is dominated by ripe sweet cherries with fresh wheat in the background. Taste is similar to the aroma but more subdued. The cherry flavor also offers some tartness not found in the nose. An easy drinking and refreshing beerwould be nice in the summer."
"Drinkability: this beer grew very tiring on the tastebuds as the glass emptied. Select any other SA beer for a more satisfying session."
"Would I buy this agian? Maybe, it went well with the dinner and the roommates all seemed to enjoy it."
"Drink-Ability: A refreshing fruit flavored beer."
"I poured this one from the bottle into a cylinder glass just to see if that would give it a little something extra. Poured a copper color with a large head ( maybe just from the glass). Smells a bit like cherry cough syrup, not really pleasing, but not horrible. Tastes just like it smell. No hint of hops. I know it's cherry wheat, but I got all cherry and no wheat. Overall, not Sam Adam's finest offering."
"The jury is still out on this one. This is my first experience with a fruit beer and after I have tried a few more I'll come back and review it again. It's not awful but it definitely is not my favorite."
"Not my favorite style of beer. Would have been better on a hot summer afternoon."
"Overall: An overly sweet fruit beer, nothing remarkable."
"This is the first fruit beer I have had, so perhaps this style may not be for me, or there are far superior examples out there I just need to try. This just seemed like drinking seltzer with cherry flavoring."
"Poured a deep golden color, with a nice head. The smell of cherry was very overpowering and I could smell it far away from the glass. It didn't smell like natural cherries do, more like the artificial cherry flavored stuff. The initial taste is very much like any other wheat beer, but that soon was completely replaced by the cherry flavor. The cherries tasted much more natural than they smelled, and although it was definitely the dominant flavor, it did not overpower the beer. The finish was very mellow and silky. If you like cherries this will be a good beer for you, but it just didn't taste enough like a regular old beer to be enjoyed on a consistent basis."
"I think if perhaps the wheat had more of a role here I would like it a lot more. Instead, it comes across as a fruity concoction that leaves the grain lost and thin. In fact, The overall feel is almost of one of those ubiquitous ""malt beverages"" and I somehow doubt this is what BBC was going for. On the flip side, it is somewhat drinkable, as the sweetness is controlled enough to be crisped a bit in the finish, making it refreshing, in its way. This was the main offering at a friend's home during the Eagles' dismantling of the Giants, and I talked to him about maybe steering clear of the fruity brews, and certainly this one."
"This one pours a dark yellow with a tall white head that fades quickly. The smell is very strong, mostly cherries with some sweet notes. The taste is very similar, very sweet and strong, the cherries dominate this beer. Not much else comes out in this beer it is one dimentional but if you like that aspect you are set. I see this beer as a love it or hate it. I happen to love it, it is an easy drinker with a smooth crisp mouthfeel. Even though the cherry taste is strong it doesn't get annoying for me. As far as fruit beers, this is my favorite. I hope you like it as much as I do. Enjoy!"
"This brew pours into my pint glass a golden color with fair clarity. A white head developed but rather quickly diminished into a thin, but long lasting skim. The aroma of the beer was no surprise, cherries, actually smelled like maraschino cherries; the smell was dominating and powerful, but pleasant. There were no real strong malt or hop aromas. The flavor is a little bit of graininess and wheat taste and a lot of cherry. The hop bitterness combined with any acidity from the cherries gives the beer a nice balance. By the smell I expected an overlysweet brew, but found something more balanced than I expected. No real hop flavor to speak of, but that was expected. The carbonation was moderate, body was medium-full, and had a nice smoothness. Overall I thought this beer was great. The handful of times I've entered the fruit beer realm I often left unsatisfied, but this one is a keeper. The aroma is wonderful, especially if you like maraschino cherries (which I do). The flavor was much more balanced and beer-like than I expected with the powerful cherry aroma. The beer was also quite smooth and finished with just about the perfect amount of tartness."
"This beer poured a golden yellow with a medium head that slowly faded. The smell had aromas of wheat and a cherries. The flavor had a medium body of wheat with a relatively strong flavor of cherries. The hop profile was very light in all aspects. The mouthfeel was relatively crisp with a medium carbonation. I felt that this was a good beer and unique for it's taste. However, I couldn't see myself drinking alot of them. It's worth a try though."
"Appearance is cloudy, no head. Strong (really strong) aroma of maraschino cherries, which is nice, but doesn't come out nearly as much in the taste. Body is well carbonated but flavour is quite flat. The cherry flavour is too sweet for beer - the maraschino cherry anyways. I might suggest a different type of cherry? This seems more like it should belong to a mixed cooler. Flavour can come across as artificial at times, though it is well fitted into the beer and stays well rounded. Overall this beer was a fun one, but I don't think it quite works... Too sweet a flavour and yet not nearly enough taste. Somewhat below par for what it should be."
"One of these is enough for me, it's too sweet to drink more than one. Not a good call for this one."
"The drinkability is not good, I will not try this offering again. MK"
"Overall: This would probably taste better on a summer afternoon than on a winter's evening like this one, but it's still better than I expected. If you like fruit beers this one's worth a shot."
"One of my absolute favorities, as I feel that's it's rare for a beer to be made into EXACTLY what it was intended to be as much so as Cherry Wheat. The cherry taste here is just wonderful at the start, with enough carbonation to really set it off. Somehow, the Sam cherries manage to tast better than your typical cherry. The finish is stronger on the wheat flavor and is extremely clean. Almost everyone I know enjoys this, even if they aren't typically into craft beers."
"Notes: I found this really enjoyable. I could see this as a nice daytime brew and quenching enough for hot weather."
"It's not good or bad, it just is. Basically tastes like cherry on a triscuit. There's a strong sweet cherry flavor on top of white american wheat. Smells of mostly cherries with a little wheat. Not really my taste, but if you're a beer noob or into fruit beer its worth a shot. Some of my friends that enjoy craft beer also love this stuff so it can't be too bad."
"This is a very enjoyable beer in my opinion, artificial flavoring or not. I guess some people find it too sweet. This one goes well after a dinner as a good dessert beer."
"Cherries tast a little artificial, mouthfeel is very lively. The cherry taste is a little sour, not too sweet, and dominates the entire taste profile. Cherries are faded out by a grainy dryness. Brew is thin though, I would have liked to see a more robust malt bill to stand up to these cherries, more wheat character as well. I think more prominent characteristics of a traditional amber ale to accompany cherries would improve this one. But very refreshing and surprisingly drinkable despite my criticism."
"I couldn't drink more than a couple of these, though."
"I really like the combination, but it I think it could be done better. It is good though and highly drinkable."
"Fairly refreshing, but very strong cherry flavor. Also, too much of this gives me terrible headaches."
"Despite the refreshing nature of the body, the oatmeal-like sensation doesnt lend itself to continuous consumption. Two or three tops and youre done. But then again, as we all respect beer we would never drink more than that anyway, would we"
"You can tell there is a good beer hiding somewhere in here, but it is overpowered by the other factors I mentioned. It's in no way bad, but even for a fruit beer it is a bit lacking. If you really like cherry colas with a mild wheat aftertaste, then by all means enjoy. It's worth a try, but having a few in a row won't be as easy."
"This won't prejudice me in the future. I will stay open."
"Served at 40 Deg in a pint glass. Light amber color, almost neutral aroma save a very faint aroma of cheeries. The taste was a refreshing blend of a mild wheat ale and fresh cherries. I was surprised on how well balanced this was. Both the middle and finish were smooth, and there was only a moderate aftertaste which led to some subtraction in dinkability points. Not a bad brew if you are into fruit ales."
"This is certainly an interesting brew and I gave it a 3.5 in the taste department just for that fact, although, I wouldn't care for another. First off, it looked and smelled great. From the first sip you get blasted with the cherry flavor with a mild wheat taste. But its all about the cherries with this one I guess. What your left with is a candy-like beer that leaves a sugary feeling in your mouth and its somewhat reminiscent of a cough drop / medicine-like cherry taste by the end of your bottle. Interesting, but awkward."
"Poured out of a bottle, into a pint glass. Feb 07 freshness date."
"This is a great tasting beer. It is sweet and mild with just the right amount of hops in this beer drinker's opinion. It reminds me of the Warrant video ""Cherry Pie"" for some odd reason. It goes great with cheese, pretzels, and I would imagine dessert. Highly drinkable, highly recommended."
"At first I didn't think I would be able to drink many of these, however after one and a half or so and my palate getting used to the sweet cherry overload, it's not very hard to drink at all, perhaps that's because it is pretty watery and weak. With that said, it's not a bad a beer to buy at a place that only carries macros, the big imports, Sam Adams and the like, but it definitely leaves something to be desired -- something that reminds you while you're drinking ""oh yeah, this is beer I'm drinking""."
"These go down real nice. I will continue to have this on my short list of beers to keep in stock."
"Overall - I've had this several times over the years and each time I come back thinking that I'll like it, but one glass of this and I'm set. A nice break once in a while, but just too sweet for my liking and definitely not a session brew."
"I'm going to spring one of these on my girlfiriend tonight at dinner. I think that she will realy like it. I personally enjoy the novelty of a cherry beer, but it has essentially zero complexity, and it's really a mediocre beer."
"The BBC has yet to impress me with its fruit characteristics in any of its beers. Like the gorgeous girl at the party whose favorite song is the new Chingy single, this is darn good looking, but you wouldn't want to live with it."
"Tasted: 09/07/06"
"DA: Perhaps this is just not my syle..."
"Drinkability: Not a bad offering from Samuel Adams. I would recomend a try or two to someone looking for a change of pace."
"Orange/red translucent body with about an inch and a half of head and decent lacing. One-dimensional aroma, cherry. Cherry dominates flavor with some malt and yeast... If I were bigger on cherries, I'd probably like it better. My only real complaint about this beer is its lack of complexity. But it's a tasty, medium-boddied, pleasant little beer."
"Ive also had this on tap. Usually have one of these for every 3-4 drinks."
"A very good Fruit Beer, and to be honest it's one of my favorite Sam Adams offerings thus far."
"D: I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would. A refreshing, uncomplicated beer; just calling it ""cherry wheat"" is a pretty functional definition, because I didn't find too many other flavors hiding in this one. Gets an average drinkability because it was less enjoyable when I poured the second bottle. As always, scores are within the style."
"Pours gold/amber with a huge head which leaves some lacing on the surface the whole way down. Smells like swee cherries- cherry coke. Taste is sweet cherries with some wheat tanginess. Fairly balanced actually. Not overly sweet. Medium to full bodied. I find this a bit cloying. It's okay but more of a beer for non-beer drinkers."
"Mouthfeel & drinkability: Very crisp. An easy beer to knock back a lot of."
"Pours a straw color; maybe a hint of pink in the edges. Minimal white head. Aroma is a bit sweet, slight cherry notes. Flavor is a light bodied American wheat with a harsh, almost sour artificial cherry flavor. It's almost overpowering, and leaves just a slight metallic tinge in the mouth. Mouthfeel is thin. Drinkability - it's been years since I tried this beer. Now I remember why."
"Got a sixer of this for my girlfriend. I'd had it before and remembered not likeing it but decided to try it again. Pours a straw color with the slightest red tint. The head is about one finger width. Smell is dominated by cherry with some wheat malt and not any noticable hops. Taste is overly dominated by cherry. The wheat malt plays less of role in the taste as I would have expected. I can only detect the a slight amount of hops. Mouth is not as carbinated as I would have wanted in a wheat beer. The thickness of the beer is ok. I am not a big fan of this beer, however my girlfriend loves it."
"Overall it's an interesting beer with an interesting flavor and aroma. But it comes across as a bit of a novelty -- the cherry flavor is a bit too much and it no longer tastes like a beer. I like fruit flavors in beers and I like lambics and such, but something here just seems contrived and artificial -- a beer _trying_ to taste like fruit. Certainly worth giving a try, but you probably won't see the need to try another."
"Taste is lightly sweet, lightly sour cherries. Crisp, lightly sour wheat malt. Light body, sweet aftertaste. Pretty good for a fruit beer. Not overdone or syrupy sweet."
"Pours a nice, cloudy, amber color with a nice head, and decent retention (poured from a bottle into a mug). Definately has a distinct cherry smell to it, followed by a malty smell. This beer has a very strong taste of cherry (as the name would imply) which I actually find to be too strong. There is also a fruity, then wheaty taste to it, but it is killed by the cherry. Went down easy, then wanted to come back up because of the taste of cherry I kept burping up. Overall, not a big fan."
"I'm stunned that this beer is still around, but I guess some people do like it. There is obvious cherry on the nose as well as in the body, but it's too strong of a sour flavor that doesn't identify as cherry. You need to either go more cherry, or more subtle. This jsut doesn't balance well. I find find the hops playing a major role here either, and I don't relate to this as a wheat beer, it looks too clean, and doesn't taste refreshing. I find it a challenge to drink more than one."
"Overall a very nice fruity beer. Another fine product from the Samuel Adams company."
"It is very good on a hot day by the pool or beach. In my opinion as well, girls who are skiddish about beer like this one, because of the sweet fruity flavour."
"But I say cherry cherry in your tree/jump down on the ground and make a pie with me. All right so those are obscure lyrics but this is a serious fruit beer. A wild dose of cherry extract and a toastiness that conjures up the taste of those cherry cordial cakes that come in a box of eight for $1.50. You may have foolhardy tastebuds and think otherwise and that is your right as an Orangutan-American just don't get all persnickety with me when I tell you that this is a top shelf cosmo-brew. Space helmet not included."
"12 oz. bottle, best by 10/06. It pours a cloudy dark pumpkin with medium visible carbonation and a finger of off-white head of small bubbles that retains a 1/4"" cap and leaves some lacing. Smells of tart/sweet cherries and cranberries, with wheat and a faint nutty/toasty aroma. It tastes like cherries, with wheat and lemon and a low hop flavor - maybe some green hops with a low bitterness. It has a light to medium body with sufficient carbonation and leaves a light finish. Overall, an interesting change of pace, but not something I'd make a session beer out of."
"Aroma is cherries all the way but not like fresh cherries, more like a jar of marrachino cherries, it is really too overbearing. Taste is not so bad but the aroma really takes over before you can even get the beer into your mouth. I actually had to hold my nose and take a drink just to get a better taste of the beer without the aroma. Taste is also cherries but much more muted than the smell. You get a bit more of the crisp flavor from the malts and a bit of spicyness from the hops. Overall I really did not enjoy this beer, it smells like they just poured jars of marachino cherries into the fermenter and although the flavor was not bad I would need to drink this with a straw to really get any enjoyment from it."
"This beer pours a crystal clear golden amber with a decent white head and minimal lacing. THe smell is like the cherry flavoring from cherry coke. The taste is also cherry sweetness from the artificial cherry flavoring, but it is quite good. It is a little thin on the mouthfeel but still good. Overall highly drinkable for a fruit beer, I don't know about as a wheat beer but good."
"This is probably a like it or leave it kind of beer, depending on whether you like cherries in beer. For me, I think it makes a good summer drinker, a nice change of pace, but maybe not one I would drink often. I also think it might appeal to those who are less inclinced to the flavor of beer."
"from the bottle. pour a honey color with a small white head. aroma Maschinos cherries, wheat, just a hint of malt. flavor, those Maschinos cherries and malts come out nice and strong along with a cola like flavor and a nice bitterness. I think this will be a good summer evening beer sitting on the deck by the fire pit"
"Very drinkable beer, perfect for that hot July day after doing some yard work or just relaxing in the summer sun. I recommend giving this one a try"
"I dont have a very pleasant memory of this beer from a bottle back in college, but getting it on tap on this warm evening was a great surprise! This beer doesnt really feel like a wheat beer and is almost more of a light dessert, because it smells just like my mothers cherry piedelicious! Not at all heavy in the mouth or overpowering with cherry flavor, but is rather a simply stated surprise of a fruit beer. Not anything I would want in the winter months, but this could be a good beer to introduce someone to craft beer (as is the case with a number of Sam Adams beers)."
"This presentation made all the difference in the world, and increased my rating significantly!"
"Overall, I have bought two or three six packs of this beer over the last two years. I am enamored with the idea of cherry wheat, though it could be done better. Still, it is a solid effort. Good, but not great."
"Overall I think this beer is good, I like the fakeish cherry flavor and the sweetness doesn't tend to stick around, which makes it better."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a quickly fading head. The cloudiness is from the yeast activated from the bottom of the bottom because of a quick swirl. The smell really does smell like the filling from a cherry pie. Taste is dry and crisp with slight notes of cherry and wheat. I did somewhat enjoy the smell of this brew but the taste was not to my liking. I did not particularly enjoy the flavor of this beer and it was hard to finish the whole thing actually. There was just something about that cherry flavor that did not sit well with me. Glad I picked up a single and not a sixer."
"Drinkability - not sure if you can drink a lot in an evening, becasue there is too much fruit, but great finisher."
"The beer pours a light, slightly cloudy copper color. The off-white head is very foamy, about 1 1/2 inches and sticks around a while with lots of lace. It smells like sweet cherries, more cherry-coke like than anything else. I couldn't really smell anything else other than the cherries. It tastes like cherry too, but it's not a strong flavor. There's a grainy/wheat taste in there too, but like the cherry taste, it's not strong at all. Not much of an aftertaste either. The beer smells better than it tastes. The mouthfeel is pretty thin, and it is easy to drink. Overall I'm not impressed. I usually like Samuel Adams beers, but this offering is very average. I'd drink it again if someone gave it to me for free, but I don't think I'd buy this beer again. There's many more beers I would rather spend my money on."
"This is one of those beers you have to be in the mood for. The appearance is just average. Copper color w/ little head. The smell is very strong, its cherry all the way. Tastes a little sweet w/ a bitter finish. Not bad but definitely not something I would want to drink all the time or often at all. I probably won't drink it again though."
"Super easy drinking and something that I might enjoy on a scorching hot afternoon."
"The taste is mostly cherry with some malts and hops in the back end. I detected a small amount of hop bitterness which rounds off the taste nicely. To me, this is a very refreshing and light tasting beer. I recommend it."
"Drinkability: Refreshing aside from the slight cough syrup flavor."
"I drank it - but I would rather have the Lindeman's Kriek Lambic if I wanted this style. This tasted like a cherry soda. Not bad, but nothing special. Not the best from Boston Brewery."
"Overall, this beer is very drinkable and is a definite improvement over what it tasted like (at least to me) in the past."
"I give it points for appearance and mouthfeel, and on a hot summer day I suppose I could put down a couple around the barbecue. But I don't quite think Sam Adams nailed what a really good cherry wheat could be."
"Enjoy!"
"Poured into my trusty 0.4 liter chalice it has a nice head that dissapates quickly. Not much lacing to speak of. Pours to a rusty yellow hue. The smell is very cherry, smells like JuicyJuice cherry in fact. Taste starts with the tartness of cherry followed by a brauny wheat. Carbonation is airy. Finish is more tartness. I like the ""middle"" taste with wheat and hint of cherry but the front end and back end are a little too sweet. Very different. I guess it would make a great ""dessert"" beer. Off the wall. Something I would serve as a conversation piece but wouldn't really drink in any quantity."
"Into a pint glass, pours a slightly hazy golden color, with a decent whitish head and ok stringy lacing. Nose has wheat hints, thought I picked up banana hints when colder, but now just a kind of junky cherry thing going on. Taste is similar, a decent wheat malt in front, but I just don't like the marachino cherry thing it has going on, bordering on the comical, like cough syrup or 'cherry' flouride, just isn't balanced out right, too much cherry when cold or warm, first sip and last. Mouth is probably the best thing about this beer, creamy, enough carbonation to give it a bit of spring. This is a desert beer if anything, but not one I'd buy again. Sorry Sam, not your best work."
"A tasty beer that is perfect for dessert. Certainly not a beer for everyone but if you love the taste of maraschino cherry then this beer is for you."
"very nice smell poured a nice head that mostly went away in 2 minutes but a bit stayed. obviously a taste of cherries but with a very nice beer...i would love it without the cherries. near perfect carbonation. great beer to drink, only planned on having 3 but drank the entire sixer. anytime i see this stuff i'll grab one. very delicious."
"Having read some of the other reviews I would also recommend drinking it on tap rather than from the bottle."
"Sam Adams usually makes winning beers. This does NOT fall into the category. Pours a nice golden orange which is the best part of it. Smells like saccharin and those cherries you get on ice cream sundaes. Taste? Well like those candy cherries and robitussen. It's quite nasty. At least the taste doesn't linger. Mouthfeel? so what. Drinkability? Well if you close your nose and gulp it, you can finish it quickly. What pisses me off big time is that this crap is easy to find, yet the double bock is damn near impossible to find. What the hell is wrong with you people????"
"I must say, this is a totally different brew in a glass. I reviewed this when I drank it out of the bottle. It tasted like cherry soda when I drank it out of the bottle. Now I believe I was ""tasting"" the aroma. It certainly smells like cherry soda, but tastes nothing like it. It pours a light copper color with a large head that quickly dissipates to a thin head-film. The smell is amazing, almondy-cherry. Tastes like almonds, hint of cherry and water. The mouthfeel is very fizzy leaving an almond aftertaste. It is light and drinkable. But then again, I really cant rate on drinkability. (I drank 1 bottle of Chimay Blue, Delerium Tremens and a bottle of Fort in 1 night!)"
"So its summer here and I have been drinking alto of wheat...Here we go on the Sam Adams Cherry Wheat. Poured from a 12oz bottle the beer itself was a amber color, darker than most wheat's, with slight red and orange hints. The head was a large(3/4 inch) creamy white(slight pink hints also present) that took a while to diminish. Lots of white lace left from the head...all around the edge of the glass. This beer almost does not smell like a beer. It is exactly what it says a cherry wheat....there is a strong smell of sweet cherry(lots of cherry and I can't stress that enough), and lots of sweet malt. The beer itself is not nearly as sweet as it smells. There is a lot of sweet malt, and cherries present in the forefront of the body. But it finishes surprisingly crisp with just a light bit of hops to balance it out, and a tartness from the cherries. For something that could be so sweet...Sam really knows how to balance his beer. Sam Adams does wonders with this beer. the smell is over the top, and the taste toned down enough to complement it. It appeals to multiple senses at once. The beer has ample carbonation creating a pleasant mouthfeel, and for a fruit beer it is surprisingly drinkable. Maybe I should put a disclaimer on this....I don't mind sweet beers, and this time of year fruit wheat's are great in the hot southern weather."
"Poured a medium brown honey color with a quickly dissipated white cap. Aroma was very much cherry almost like a cherry jolly rancher with a little grain undertones in the nose. The problem I had with this beer is it reminded me of cherry cough syrup. Even though I love the kriek lambics and other cherry drinks, this one turned me off. The flavor was more of the same. If I could have seperated the cherry flavor and the wheat flavor they may have been good...but some some reason together remind me of a medicinal syrup. A little bitterness to help mellow it out. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a hint of alcohol and medium carbonation. I would not have this again."
"D- yeah um no thanks. the 2nd worst fruit/veggie beer ive ever had."
"Pours with a golden body, some brownish tone and a thick light tan head. Smells gorgeous! Marzipan (sweet almondy), ripe cherry and malt. The taste follows up with sweet cherry right up front, then bready-doughy-marzipan flavors, and a bitter finish. The hops don't stick out here, allowing the sweets to come forward delightfully. I have to admit that this is already one of my favorite brews of all time. Delicious with a chicken parm sub."
"Tastes was cherry. Think of a good lager with some cherries thrown in. At first it was refreshing and different. After I finished just one beer though I was a little put off by it, I'm not so sure that beers are made to be this fruity. However, it was a decently good beer and it is definitely what it claims to be, a cherry wheat. If fruit beers are your thing then this is definitely worth a shot. I may pick this up again later in the summertime for a refreshing fruity beer."
"They were giving bottles of this away at a local Bennigans for 25 cents over the summer -- GREAT DEAL! I like this much better than Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic. Smell is of sweet cherry & it's really close in taste to a black cherry soda -- with alcohol, of course. The apperance is nice -- pretty basic amber with a good head. Drinkability is also good--had three before they told me they were all out. Wasn't surprised considering the price..."
"Drinkability: It may not be the best of the Sam Adams line, but I still found it to be somewhat refreshing. An ok beer if you can find it on sale somewhere and nothing else is available."
"Overall: pop the top and enjoy this with dessert"
"All in all, I enjoyed this brew. I was not extremely impressed but I wasn't let down either."
"Very orange beer with a decent almost white head, from a fairly gentle pour. Slight haze and lots of streams of bubbles. Wheat and cherries on the nose. Pleasantly sweet taste, though the cherries are not as far forward in the taste as in the aroma. Light hops bitterness and a nice dry finish. Mouthfeel is a bit slim, but very quaffable. I was pleasantly surprised."
"I have not read much about mixing beers on this site - but in this instance I think it was a good solution and helped me to enjoy a few pints on a Sunday afternoon."
"It poors out an orangish red color with a frothy light head. Smells of deep marichino cherries. Little else in the smell aside from a touch of hops..some kind of noble hop if i had to guess but actually pretty nondescript with the screaming cherry over it. Okay so the cherry will hit you right up front. But after this subsides there is a pretty good malty flavor. Actually a delicious maltiness, very earthy and strong. The cherry plays pretty well with it too, if only it tasted a little less like marichino and more like pie filling cherries. As far as fruit beers go this is the second best one I think I have had. Mouthfeel is unassuming and light, maybe a little warming, but i don't know how at 5.2%. The beer is an okay one. I'll warn that if you don't like fruit beers, you won't like it. If you like beer and can appreciate a good mix of fruit in it, then this is a decent beer to try."
"This is my favorite Sam Adams brew, just beating out the Hefe Weizen. The smell of cherries hits you as soon as you pour it; it has a medium to dark red color to go along with it and there wasn't much head. It's definitely sweeter than most fruity beers I've had. I drank it with a burger, and they went surprisingly well together."
"D: For me this is a very drinkable beer. Hard to believe this is a wheat beer. I'm suprised I even picked it up. Didn't know what to expect but I found this to be a breath of fresh air. Very nice."
"This pours a clear orange color with a large two finger foamy white head. The smell is a very sweet strong cherry. It's not bad,but it's alittle strange for a beer. The taste is pretty good and I would rate it higher except that it's all cherry. I was hoping for more of a wheat beer flavor,but this tastes only like cherries and it makes me feel that the flavor is fake. It is refreshing and a light m/f makes this a nice crossover beer for people who don't like beer. This is OK and better than I thought,but I just wish the flavors were a little more complex."
"Pours a gold with reddish tint and a very light head. Smells strong of cherry...can't really detect much beyond because it is so strong. Taste is what one would expect...a cherry flavored beer. It has a sour tinge that gives it a kick but basically unless you really like cherry flavoring you should probably stay away from this one. I like fruit and beer so that's why my review is actually higher than most beerdrinkers"
"Drinkability: This is not a bad beer by any measure. It is just not a particularly great beer either. This beer is a very easy to drink beer. The sweetness is not cloying or over powerful. The beer was a welcome change of pace."
"Verdict- A good summer beer. This would go great with a hamburger fresh off the grill."
"Either way, a noble try from Boston Beer."
"Poured this beer into a mug from the bottle. It pours a golden-amber. It has a light wheat nose that has a heavy cherry overtone. It has very little head that quickly dissipates. It has a slightly fizzy and medium mouthfeel. The flavor is overwhelmed with cherry, I can barely detect the wheat flavors due to the overwhelming cherry taste and aftertaste. If the cherry flavoring was toned down about 75% it might be a refreshing beer. I do like the majority of beers that Sam Adams makes, however I think this is the worst beer I've tasted from them. I like the cherry ""Lambic"" much better."
"gorgeous cherry amber color with a lasting faerie ring. this beer shows off its cherry jell-o and tart candy aroma nicely for those of us who are head over wings for fruity sweets. sadly, the taste does not fair as well as the scent. starting sweet there is a bitter end that smacks of cough syrup. clean and fizzy, oh so spritely, its still difficult to take in. fortunately, as the beer warms it does relax a little adding to the drinkability, and since you won't be reaching for your glass much, its sure to warm."
"drinkability: this would actually be a very easy to drink beer, but the taste makes it hard for me to finish even one. the way it feels in the mouth and light bodied nature makes it great for drinking if i try to concentrate less on taste."
"In the summer, I could drink this a lot. It's light, not as sweet as a cherry pop, and reminds me of ""kiddie cocktails"" I used to have as a kid. However, when I want a beer, I want a beer."
"Two hours after drinking this, I was still trying to find things to get the brutal aftertaste out of my mouth. It leaves a very sickly sweet feeling, and thus makes this beer something to be avoided for now. I honestly think this one needs a retooling, tone down the cherry, make it less dominant, allow the other flavors to mingle more. If they could make the taste subtle (like Stoney Creek does with their vanilla porter) i would have been happier."
"This is icky. Just plain icky. I know a few girls that enjoy this as a fruity girly drink, but I think this is really unenjoyable. It's like cough syrup. Robitussin comes to mind. Fake-ly cherry flavored Tussin. I think I can't manage more than three sips. Gross. Yucky. Ew. Blech. ::gags::"
"Pours a pale orangish color, with a slight haze. Two finger head is densely packed and retains well. Leaves nice spiderweb lacing. Maraschino cherries dominate the nose, with wheat and some pale malt just pulling through. Wheat and a surprisingly mild cherry syrup flavor make up the bulk of the flavor. Aftertaste shows some very quiet earthy tones, mild hops and cherry skins. Medium body and medium carbonation allow a very smooth mouthfeel and drinkability. Finish is a touch sweet, but won't detract from you enjoying something this unique and refreshing."
"Pours a solid copper color with a nice tight white foam of compact bubbles over the top. Big cascade of bubbles from the bottom is keeping the head at a substantial level. A little darker than I would expect for a wheat, but that could be from the cherry. Nose is pretty strong cherry with a subtle wheaty creamy character to keep it from being to candy-like. Pretty well all about the cherry here. Flavor is more wheat central than the nose. The fruity cherry sweetness hits up front, but fades behind an almost heavy wheat character. It has a light bitter to light astringent character on the finish. I'm torn between this being a very mild hopping or an astringent grain quality. Its not very pleasing either way. Feel is moderate with a very velvety carbonation, giving it a nice creamy character. I'm just not sure what I think about this one. I like the nose a fair bit, as the wheat and cherry blend well, but the flavor is just a bit off to me. The grainyness is too strong and that finish is not working. Its not a beer I think I will be getting again."
"I've never had a cherry wheat, so this may just not be my thing. I'm not sure, all I know is that the remaining four bottles were thrown away tonight (the first time this has ever happened). This won't deter me. I guess it is worth a try just to see what your tastes are. I personally wouldn't drink this beer if it were given to me. It was just that bad, but I'm not a cherry wheat guy. But then again, maybe it tasted the way it was supposed to and I just hated it. Either way, I'm done with the Cherry Wheat."
"This isn't a terrible beer, but it isn't great either. I would like it better with less sweet cherry flavor and more maltiness. I could drink this on occasion, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"I was not a fan of this Sam Adams creation. I poured the crystal clear sunset golden it into a pint glass creating a nice rocky head. Its cherry smell was pervasive and artifically sweet, just like an artificially-flavored cherry lollipop. Underneath were the cherry-alcohol notes of cough syrup. The cherry smell could not be separated from the taste, which was disappointing. Sans taking in the aroma, the taste was less cherryesque, and disappointingly flat and bland. Also, the body of the beer was light and thin. From what I understand, fruit beers are only supposed to be mildly fruity, however, I could not finish 12 oz of this brew because of the overwhelming cherry cough syrup aroma."
"Mouthfeel is slightly chewy."
"I picked up a sixpack of this for the holidays. When I read the label I was really excited. I could try a wheat beer from a company I know makes decent products from high quality ingredients. I had a really good experience with the first wheat beer I tried (Blue Moon Belgian White), and it had cherry in it to boot. It sounded perfect. When I actually tried it I was kind of disappointed. This may be made with wheat, but it is definately no Belgian style White. It was almost as heavy and bitter as Regular Sam Adams Lager. Anyway, since I haven't poured one out of the bottle yet, I rated the appearance at 3. I'm sure it is probably a decent looking brew, but until I know for sure its rating will be in the middle. When I do get around to pouring one in a glass I'll edit this review. Smell is pleasant, with some fairly strong but very clean malt, and of course cherries. Taste disappointed me at first since I was expecting the cherry against a background of light citrusy wheat beer instead of the rather heavier malt flavor strong enough to be typical of the regular Sam Adams Boston Lager. Still, on repeat samplings, the cherry blends nicely with the richer sweetness of the malted wheat. It's pleasant with rather weaker hop presence than either regular Sam Adams Boston Lager, or Sam Adams Light either. (This beer pluse those two represent my entire sampling of Boston Beer Co's products at this time) Like you'd expect from this company, even the relatively bland hops in this beer are still high quality. They fit the beer and they bring only good things to it, even though the cherries really main contributors to the flavor aside from the malt. Mouthfeel is very pleasant being a bit lighter than regular Sam, very similar to Saranac Lager. Drinkability is excellent. It gets a tiny bit thick towards the end, but its thirst quenching, easier to drink than regular Sam Adams, and seems to be improve the more I sample it. And it also seems to pair well with almost anything. I've had 3 different beers with pizza, chips and dip, and buffalo wings and each time it went great with the food. In conclusion, this very pleasant and fairly unique brew that's definately worth a try."
"Drinkability: I could drink many of these if I had to, but I would prefer not to. Its not my favorite beer, and its not my favorite fruit beer, but its decent enough if you have to drink it or are curious to try it."
"Pours a medium amber with a small, white, fully diminishing head. Smells of fake cherry, like maraschino cherry juice, over mild wheat. The taste is dominated by more fake flavors that overshadow any redeeming qualities of this beer. It has a thin body, watery texture and low carbonation, and its probably the worst of the beers to wear the Sam Adams name. Big disappointment."
"A beer worth trying but perhaps not worth revisiting. I poured one from a 12 oz. bottle, and found it to be drinkable, inoffensive, but lacking in any strong positive qualities. The cherry taste is well-defined, but it blends with the beer in such a way that I can't escape thinking this is how a flat diet cherry cola would taste. Actually the body is much crisper than flat soda, and that helps make this an ok beer."
"Poured out a hazy honey colored brew with minimal head.Smell like black cherry ice cream,,not bad at all.Taste is very surprising and i gotta say i like it.Cherries cherries cherries but they are not overpowering.Mouthfeel nothing special.Drinkability good,,,i wouldnt makre it an all the time brew but great for something out of the ordinary."
"The mouthfeel is great. It has the perfect body with excellent carbonation matched with superb smoothness. A very drinkable beer if you like a fruity twist on your brew."
"This beer smells like black cherry ice cream. It tastes a little like cough syrup. It looks like a slightly amber hued light beer. The mouthfeel is not that great. I could possibly drink more than one but I'm not sure I'd want to. Ole Sam puts out some pretty good brews but I think this one comes up a little short. Maybe it's time this one is voted out of the brewtanks."
"I'll finish my sixer, but then I'm done with Cherry Wheat."
"Probably a decent crossover beer for the ladies : )"
"Cherry Wheat may be my least favorite Samuel Adams offering to date. If my memory is accurate, I even thought the much maligned Cranberry Lambic was better. With a major tweak or two this could be an okay fruit beer. In its present form, no thank you."
"If you like Dr. Pepper and chewing on cardboard, then this is the beer for you!"
"On tap in an 11 oz glass at MagGregors. This came to me as a nice hazy orange color with nice lacing. The fruit/cherry aroma is very pleasant. This has always tasted more like a cherry fruit drink than a beer to me. The wheat side is there but sorta weak. Overall though it is an enjoyable brew. Very malty. The moouthfeel was slightly creamy and moderate. In terms of drinkability could drink this forever, just might get a little bored."
"This beer is in a nice bottle and don't let that ""Don't judge a good book by its cover"" idea fool you this beer lives up to its potential. This beer gets a decent head and pours a nice deep amber but not too dark. The smell of this makes one look forward to drinking it and when it hits the toungue it has a fantastic typical lager flavor but after swallowing, the cherry aftertaste makes this a spectacular beer. SA Cherry Wheat is a simple classic beer. Nothing special enough to spend hundreds on but certainly one that I recommend. This Beer, like most Samuel Adams, are good with Beef, a Steak, a Burger, etc...Try it, you won't be disappointed"
"D - Not too high, in fact, I had trouble drinking one. I'm sure there is a segment for this beer, and with the low ABV it is a steady drinker, but not to me, and likely the majority of BA's."
"Something different, not something I would drink everyday but drinkable, could be very nice on a hot summer day relaxing in the shade."
"Poured a reddish-amber color with a light tan head. Not as cloudy as other wheat beers. The head quickly faded to leave decent lacing. It smells of sweet cherries and not much else. Tastes the same way as it smells; hops are barely noticeable. The mouthfeel is thick and sticky; almost like cherry syrup. Also leaves the lips very sticky. I enjoy this beer after dinner occasionally as a dessert, but more than two would make me feel sick. It would have been nice for S.A. to add more complexity to this underachieving brew."
"this is sort of sickening. I poured it down the sink."
"Big on the cherry flavor, but lacking on everything else. Pours a less-red-than-expected- color with disapointing head retention for a wheat. Aromas are big of cherry and nothing else. Flavors like cherry Kool-Aid (not real cherries). It has some good fruity tartness and a lacking barley or wheat quality. Lacking in the wheat flavors, textures, and apprearance. Yeast offers no fruity esters or spiciness. Barley malt is hardly detected. A thin mouthfeel and a fleeting finish. I am suprised that this beer didn't turn out better."
"Notes: flavors don't mixed together well"
"Pours with a nice white head settling over oh so slightly hazy gold/amber liquid, tinged with a light pink/red cast. The nose is sweet cherries and malt with light hopping. The light mouthfeel offers flavors of cherry, sweet malt grass and decent hop bitterness. Finishes light, spritzy and easy to drink...one of my favorite hot weather brews."
"Overall, another good beer from the folks at the Boston Brewing Company. I really like how this beer finishes with a nice wheat taste. Keep up the great work!!!"
"Easier to drink than SA Cranberry."
"Overall I was very impressed with this first sampeling of Sam Adams Cherry Wheat."
"This is a very nice beer, I often drink it during the Summer as a refreshing change of pace. When compared to Pete's Strawberry Blonde, another widely available fruit-based beer, SA Cherry Wheat has a more pronounced fruit taste. However, it's not at all overpowering & compliments the wheat nicely. I also find the sweetness to be quire neutral. I really detest any sweet drinks - I've never been able to finish a six-pack of milk stout I bought & never drink fruity mixed drinks, so if you're looking for something sweet probably look elswhere."
"I couldn't believe that a reputable brewer like Samual Adams would produce such a terrible obnoxious tasting beer. I was very shocked. Especially because I was having it at a Sam Adams tasting. Oh well."
"drinkability: the cherry would have been too much after a couple more"
"The mouthfeel seems a bit oily and its more of a malted fruit concoction than a balanced beer. Therefore I would not want another."
"This will certainly not be for everyone, but I think this would be a great transitional beer for those who like fruit based mixed drinks. It would also go well with spicy foods, maybe even a fruit dessert. Without question one of the more unique beers I have recently tried, and a great summer beer. Give it a try."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a small head which does not last long, but lots of carbonation. A nice lacing after pour though. Scent is very sweet with a cherry aroma. Light body with a very nice cherry after taste, not really much bite, but what do you expect from a 5.2% brew. As with most if not all SAs brews very drinkable. This brew really surprised me since I've never had any kind of beer with a fruit in it. A very nice session beer."
"The cherry flavor is not overdone, nor does it seem as artificial as on the nose. There is a decent amount of malt to back up the cherry flavors. Hops are present throughout the sip, but become most noticeable after the swallowing when some of the cherry and malt notes subside. Finish is a slight hop bitterness with some tart cherry notes."
"The texture is smooth and goes down easy. However the flavor is less than I had expected. It doesnt quite taste like a good wheat beer, or a good fruit beer. I think you might be able to recreate the flavor with bud light and some amaretto."
"Opinion: I fell into the marketing of this beer, and bought a six-pack...OOPS! It looked and sounded good...even smelled good before I tried it. I was then extremely disappointed when I tasted it. I recently drank Sammies Chocolate Bock which was excellent, and it surprises me that the same brew master can produce this beer. I know that Sam Adams has the ability to make a good beer, but unfortunately this is one that I would not recommend."
"This is a very refreshing change. Light with good fruit flavor and crisp. Good for these 100 degree + days we have been having here in the Lone Star State."
"A great summer drink and another solid beer from the folks at Sam Adams."
"Drinkability: Sometimes I drink this beer and I like it, other times I think it is to sweet and tart and don't really care for it. After a long day in the sun today, it seems to be ok. I could drink a couple."
"Mouthfeel is light, but a bit heavier than some wheats, probably due to the syruppy cherry flavoring. It remains quite quaffable on hot days and is tolerable."
"Whoa, the cherry is too over-bearing in this one. Pour was disappointing  way too clear for a wheat beer. Although it had a nice cherry and malt aroma, the taste went from strong cherry in the beginning to tasting like Robitussin cough syrup by the end of the bottle. Even the wife-zilla, while working on her bottle, said she couldnt stomach another."
"Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Sweet cherries up front replaced by slightly stale breadiness and wheat in the middle. Mild sweetness in the finish. Decent but not excellent. Slightly thin & watery, but refreshing. Drinkability is decent, but more than one would be too sweet for me. Good for summertime, but not a year round drinker."
"Drinkability is OK on this but not my particular favorite flavor/style. Funny... I remember liking this a lot more years ago."
"Waitress told me she found the coldest glass just for me (why???). Anyway, after my first three selections were unavailable, I reluctantly went for the Cherry Wheat. I was pleasantly surprised here. Great taste and smell (unlike some flavored beers that only have a hint added - i.e. Saranac Caramel). Almost as tasty of a fruit/vegetable beer at the Cottonwood Pumpkin. If you like cherry, definitely try it out."
"This is my first review and also the 1st fruit/vegetable beer I've tried. One of my friends told me how much he liked fruit/vegetable beers so when I saw this at my grocery store I had to give it a try. It poured a nice golden color with a small white head. First thing I noticed was the smell of cherries. I wasn't sure what a fruit beer should taste like, but the sweet taste of cherries was very pleasant. There was a slightly bitter aftertaste but an overall smooth finish. This was very different than any other beer that I have tried, but it was a good different. I don't think this will be my favorite style, but it was a welcome change and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"This one came in a Brewmasters Collection 12 oz. brown bottle with a freshness date of July 2005. The beer poured deep clear golden with a frothy two-inch thick head, and spirited latent carbonation. The aroma was dominated by very ripe cherries and bready to yeasty wheat malt. Cherry flavor was again prominent in the taste, although the beer was not very sweet at all. There was also a lemony yeastiness typical of American Wheat beers. No fruity esters evident in this one, and its a shame, because cherries and bananas go so well together. A bit thicker on the tongue than a typical wheat due to the syrupy fruit juice present in the brew. I am not a big fan of fruit beers, but this one is one of the better ones."
"Poured into a pint glass. Formed minimal head that dissipated rather quickly. The smell of cherries is definitely the first thing that was noticed. Cherry taste seems a bit artificial and a little forced but the overall taste is good. Mouthfeel is ok. A little bitterness at the finish detracts from the overall rating. One or two of these beers is ok in one sitting but more than that and the taste is a bit repetitive. A pretty good beer overall."
"(Edited, Jan. '07. I've lowered the rating somewhat, as I've broadened my horizons. Still a beer I like a lot, but not as high on my list as it once was.)"
"The beer is not half bad. Not one of my favorite styles and perhaps not the best beer to enjoy in winter. But, I might enjoy it more throughout the Spring and Summer months."
"Drinkability: Much better than Sam Adam's Cranberry Lambic (which isn't saying much). This is actually a decent fruit beer. I'm not a huge lover of the style in general, so I probably wouldn't have more than a couple of these things in succession..but if you like fruit beers, this is a must try. Respectable and solid offering from Sam Adams."
"Pours a medium copper color with a 2 finger head and very nice lace. Smell of some wheat malt but mostly sweet marachino cherries. Taste is OK, some wheat malt flavor and a nice bitter ending but in the middle is what I think is too much cherry. If the cherry flavor was either less sweet or toned down a bit it would be much better. Finishes dry and leaves a cherryness in your mouth. Not super drinkable - maybe on a warm summers day its better."
"Uncle Hamish says: ""Blooie' 'ell lad, whut are ye feedin' me now? Sweet tart wa'er?"""
"as far as drinkability goes, i could drink quite a few but could see myself getting tired of cherries eventually."
"Nothing special here, but a decent enough brew."
"Overall not to bad for a fruit beer."
"The mouthfeel was a light swill. I won't be buying more of this, but incidentally, I got my BMC-drinking, scared-to-dip-his-foot-in-the-water-of-real-beer friend hooked on this stuff. I might drink some of his if I didn't bring my own beer, but I would most likely bring my own before resorting to this for a session."
"Interesting and I probably won't be back but props to my parents for this one!!"
"If you like cherries, you'll probably like this, but I can't really imagine myself drinking this regularly or with any sort of meal except for desert."
"The bastard son of a wheat beer and froot loops. This beer has been in my fridge for a long time. My girlfriend picked up a 6er a long time ago and they have just sat there. I had one after a night of drinking Maredsous 10 and I thought it was more akin to snorting Pixie sticks than having a beer. Never come close to this beer unless you are firm in your opinion that you want a fruit beer. It isn't one of the best beers of had, but compared to the competitors in this genre it ain't too bad."
"Pours a clear, light amber color with a large, rocky white head. Pronounced cherry smell along with wheat malt. The cherry flavor is not as strong as in many fruit beers, but the flavor is off. It reminds me of cherry flavored cough drops. I could not detect any hops. Im not a big fan of the cherry flavor, but it could have been worse."
"A solid beer paired with Thanksgiving dinner. Poured a dark gold color with a medium head that retained itself well. Smell of dark cherries permeates the first whiff of this beer. Tasted somewhat sweet, with a prevalent cherry flavor that comes out immediately and stays with the tongue after swallowing. This beer did not have the residual bitterness noted in other beers of the same type - in other words, this to me seemed more on the lager than on the ale side. One could easily order another one of these after the first. Very easy to drink and enjoy."
"The surprise was the nicely rounded mouthfeel, an afterthought to the scent. Its hard to critically speak about this beer - the scent was gagging and the flavor was wholly lacking. Just poor beer passing a fruit cocktail for those who don't like beer - the exact reason why my friends had bought it."
"Too sweet and fruity for me, but my girlfriend likes it. The aroma is of cherries. Which also comes through in the flavor. The cherry is so strong that it overpowers any hope of tasting hops. The beer poured out of the bottle oale gold in color with hardly any head. A good beer to share as a novelty, but I am not overly fond."
"This is a favorite of mine that goes way back to when I first discovered good beer. It looks like a traditional wheat beer, but has a reddish tint and has little or no head. The smell of cherries invites you to drink this wonderful brew. The taste is also of cherries and a nice balance of wheat malt and just a tinge of hops. I am not usually fond of fruit beers, but this beer keeps me coming back for more. It is definitely drinkable."
"Don't let me turn you off from this beer, my wife ( a beer neophyte) loves it, but its just not to my liking."
"This beer pours a copper colour into the glass. It has a big white foamy head, that are long lasting. The smell is strong of cherries. It has an artificial smell too. The charry taste isn't as strong as the smell. It also has a wheaty malt taste. I find the body to think for my liking. Well, this wasn't my favourite beer. But it was worth trying."
"Cheers!!"
"This beer pours a light amber color with a white head that sits about a 1/4"". It's a decent looking beer. The smell is good. It smells predominately of cherries. The taste is wheat-like on the tip of your tongue and as it coats your mouth, a strong cherry flavor takes over. Strong cherry aftertaste. Average mouthfeel. Decent carbonation. Its an alright beer but nothing special. I'm not big on cherry flavored beers unless its a lambic or something of the sorts. Maybe just not this one. Try it if you think this might be down your alley."
"Poured a clear amber-gold with a 1/2 inch head that retained fairly well. Aroma was noticeable upon popping the cap, as a soda-like cherry aroma first presented itself. Upon further aromatic detction however i found the aroma to contain a bit of wheat like malt and a lot of artificial smelling cherry. The flavor is a lot better than the aroma as the cherry flavor is a lot more subdued than the aroma might let on. The flavor begins with a tight melding of cherry, carbonic bite, and dry wheaty malt. It soon segues into just malt and leaves a cereal taste almost like cheerios to linger in the mouth. The body is way too light and this beer could use a little higher mash temperature. The drinkability is quite subjective and personally i would go for an Apricot ale from Pyramid instead of another cherry wheat as it is a bit too soda-like and is definetly a beer for those who don't like beer but like alcopops."
"I am not a hhuge fan of this beer. It is definitely not of the quality as other Boston Beer offerings. The cherry smell is nice, but when I taste it, all I taste is syrup, like cough syrup. It is not the least bit complex. However, it is a drinkable beer, especially for the non-beer crowd. It is without a doubt a step up from the malternatives."
"Pours out a copper color with good lacing. A very strong aroma of cherries that doesn't smell bad, just not what i prefer. I thought it was overwhelmed with the cherry flavor and good hints of spices. The body was full and heavy to me. This beer is not my style but i give it respect. think this would be a great beer to serve after dinner."
"This has certainly got to be one of my absolute fovourites from Samuel Adams. Extremely tasty. Pours a golden orange colour with almost no head, just a thin slightly off-white haze. Laces the glass nicely. Just looks good, almost thirst quenching. The smell is very strong of cherry. There is no doubt whatsoever that there is cherry in there. The taste is divine. Alot of cherry at first, then it subsides to a maltiness which then gives way to a very nice toasted flavour. Just delicious. Medium bodied; not too heavy. The mouth feel is a bit thinner than the black motor oil porters and stouts that I typically drink. Very tasty, very smooth, not a whole lot of carbonation, very drinkable. Fantastic!!"
"-Oelergud"
"Medium gold body, no lasting head at all, even with a proper pour. Smells like, not very surprising, cherris. The taste is again cherry strong, but a yeastiness is present from the wheat beer base. Not too bad, for a fruit beer. Stays away from a cloying flavor, does not approach cough syrupy. It's like someone put grenadine in a sam adam's hefeweizen."
"Drinkability: Definitely a ""dessert"" beer, I wouldn't drink this with a meal. However it is refreshing and has a good cherry flavor. Unfortunately, it was awfully light - almost like drinking a flavored light beer - for my taste."
"Nice to see that Sam Adams has continued to produce this unique fruit brew over the years."
"its the best but it does have some merit to it."
"I've been drinking this one way before I was drinking craft beers. Had it again recently, as this was the only somewhat non-macro that was offered. It was an amber color with a small straw head. It smells like cherry and wheat, but artificial like. It has a good taste for just drinking beer. It is somewhat sour like, and sweet too. Had a nice hop finish. I see why I liked it so much when I was younger, and dumber. If there's not much else to order, I would stick with this one. It's not a bad beer, just average."
"The bottom line is that this offering from Sam Adams fails miserably as a fruit beer and is a wretched example of style."
"Yellow colored body, slightly opaque with a light white head. Smells like cherries. Tastes like drinking a cherry popsicle. Cherry is NOT my favorite fruit flavor. The cherry characteristics of this beer overwhelmed me. If you really like the flavor of a cherry popsicle you just might like this. But this is not for me."
"Slightly bitter, but overwhelmingly the flavor is of cherry cough syrup. Avoid this beer at all costs. You'd be better off going out and drinking a bottle of Robitussin"
"This beer is good but there is a little to much sweetness to it. When one first drinks the beer it tastes more like a sweetened beverage than a beer. The intial taste is good but the taste flatens out when one starts to swallow the beer. Overall this is a okay beer but it is a little to sweet for a same adams beer for my taste. The cherry and beer flavor could be a little more balanced. The cherry taste almost overpowers the beer."
"Overall, a very nice, drinkable beer and one to try either by itself or with light, non-spicy snacks on a warm summer's day."
"Medium amber color with a good lace. Very strong pleasant cherry smell. Taste is quite mild with cherries and a little bit of malt, but nonexistant bitterness. It goes down very smoothly. A good refreshment that would complement milder foods or good on its own."
"Smallish slightly off-white head on an amber shaded brew. Lacing was excellent. Reasonably strong cherry aroma. Taste was pale malts balanced with cherry flavor, but not overpowered by them. Mouthfeel was good for a fruit beer, which is a reasonable compliment since I am not the world's biggest fruit beer fan. Drinkability was good as well, although I am guessing the cherry flavor was strong enough to get old after awhile. Better than I thought it would be, give it a try."
"Nice long lasting creamy head, glittering opaque orange color body. The smell is of artificial cherry, like cherry yogurt. Cherry yogourt in the taste with some peaches and hints of sourness. The mouthfeel is creamy and round, with a low carbonation. The artificial aromas and flavors are quite annoying. I wouldn't want to have another one. Then again, I don't really like cherry."
"Not as sour as a lambic, not as refreshing as a pilsner, this beer has a niche in between. A pleasant change of pace."
"The head is big, off-white, foamy. The beer is almost clear, a dirty orange-amber. Aroma is very sweet: cherry ice cream, really. Sweet cherries dominate the front with sweet cream filling in the middle. It's almost a white chocolate taste. Finishes better: the sweetness tames, it bitters a little and nuts show. This isn't a bad beer. Creamy, with a nice, nutty finish. But it's too sweet for me, even as an ice cream beer."
"Mouthfeel was creamy, with medium body. However, I would've like something a little more lively. Very easy to drink, but I wouldn't feel like drinking more than two I think."
"Beer pours a nice red-amber color, strong carbonation and an almost-white head that manages to stick around a respectable amount of time. The cherry is noticeable in the aroma, balanced well with light hops and wheat. Taste lives up to the promise of the smell: wheat and hops lead the way, are joined by the cherry midway before giving way to a nice fruity finish. The cherry is subtle and fades fast and clean enough to avoid a cough-syrup tackiness. I live in the desert and this is a beer in my regular rotation during the summer when I want something light, refreshing, and able to cut through a dry throat with a little bite. Utterly drinkable."
"After a couple of these, the cherry sweetness becomes cloying and artificial. Still, this is a drinkable and somewhat light beer, if you like cherry soda with a mild kick."
"Overall, I do like it, but I think next time I'll drink it straight from the bottle while cooking up some bbq with some friends."
"Newly discovered and now one of my current favorites. I could drink this constantly, and have. Aroma is all cherries. Cherry taste is strong but not overpowering, declines quickly into wheat with a slight bitterness but finishes cleanly. This beer will be great for the summer."
"Cherry Wheat. Uh oh. This is one of the more stranger beers from Sam Adams. Poured out a dark gold which left lacing around the glass. Pretty nice appearance I must admit. Smell was mostly cherries, almost like cough syrup. Taste was average at best. Wheat upfront mixed with some cherries. Cherries seemed to be quite sweet. A little sweetier than I expected it to be. Ah, average at best."
"While I don't know if I would say this is one of the worst beers I have had, it is certainly not very drinkable - I like the first, but couldn't stand it by the third. Pours a golden color with lot of carbonation and a quickly dissapatind, medium sized head. Aroma is entirely of cherries. Flavor starts of with a cherry sweetness, giving way to a crispy wheat aftertaste, with some pilsner characteristics also. Again this wasn't bad, but it lost its appeal quickly. i don't know what it was exactly but maybe cherries and beer just weren't meant really for each other."
"No hops, no wheat, to sweet of a cherry at that. Ug, not very good choice, IMO"
"Poured a hazy light bronze color. The aroma was as expected - (a little ""kreiky""). All the natural elements to this beer are fine (water, wheat, hops)...it is the cough syrup finish that kills all the promise. This one isn't necessarily ""always a good decision""."
"12 ounce bottle, freshness date of Aug 04. Pours golden bronze, with a respectable off white head. Obvious nose of cherry and some yeast in the background. As advertised, cherry flavor carries the freight here. Typical american wheat beer mouth feel and body. Sweet Cherry flavor just about right strenghwise, present but not overpowering. I was pleasantly suprised by this one. Nice summer quaffer or desert beer."
"Good golden wheat color, frothy white head, not very thick. Good aroma with a strong sour cherry scent. There is a pronounced sweet\sour cherry taste on top, strong enough that it somewhat mutes the flavor of the rest of the beer. Still though, the balance of this beer makes it one of the ""crispest"" beers I've had, it goes down very smooth and leaves little to no aftertaste. A great summer beer, especially with the low ABV."
"This beer is great with rhubarb pie or raspberry chocolate cheesecake..."
"Zum wohl!"
"Gold like a pale ale, big soft head. Sweetened cherries with some bready malt and a hint of earthy hops. Not bad, just dominated by a simple sweetened fruit flavor that gets annoying to me. Medium-bodied, smooth and soft. Well-made. Fine beer, not my favorite flavor and rather simple strong cherry. I can enjoy one of these every once-in-a-while."
"Pours out golden colored with a slight orange tint to it and a great head that leaves good lacing behind as well. Aroma is all cherries. The taste is much like the aroma, but not overpowering which is most people's fear with this type of beer. It is moderate in strength but sweet, making it undesirable after maybe 2 or 3. Not a bad beer at all, I always enjoy Sammy A Cherry Wheat once in a while."
"Smells like cherry flavored cough drops to me, but I think smell is overrated anyway. I've had plenty of excellent cheeses that smell like a marathoner's jock strap. I like the cloudy, mysterious amber color, although the head is on the thin side. And yep, it tastes like a cherry flavored wheat beer to me. The cherry flavor actually takes about a half second to hit you, and isn't overpowering like too many fruit beers, but it is still a little on the strong side. Subtlety is best with the fruit beers. A little harsh going down, but drinkable. Not my favorite, but it's still good for a quaff now and then."
"Overall Impression: Too much “cherry” not enough hops. Just leaves the beer one sided, and not on a good side. I like fruit beers, too bad this isn’t one."
"I really cannot fathom why this is rated as high as it is!"
"An OK fruit beer, I wouldn't have more than one though."
"Cherries just a little too overpowering, but considering it's in the name, I suppose that is the point. If it were a bit more subtle, the wheat could come out and play, making this a more complex brew. As it is, it's a single-themed dessert."
"I don't remember the cherry flavor in this beer being so dominant and annoying at times. It used to be a nice compliment, but now it's taken a turn for the worse. Nevertheless, still a decent beer. You can still taste wheatiness, though it is not very pronounced. The cherry aspect is pleasing but gets on my nerves at the same time. It seems too much like cherry cough syrup now. Hopefully, I will be able to thoroughly enjoy this beer once again."
"This would make a nice after-dinner dessert beer. Pours to a frothy off-white head and deep golden-orange color. Smells like cherries and cream--not beerlike at all. Flavor starts with a rush of charry flavor then fades out to reveal a nice wheat beer base. Finishes with a sour wheat malt aftertaste mixed with fresh cherries. A remarkable beer that has real beer flavors mixed with cherries. It would be appreciated by non beer lovers as well."
"After all these years, this is my first taste of this beer. Poured a hazy and dull golden amber color. Topped with a rich and creamy head that left walls of lace on the glass. Theres no mistaking the sweet cherries in the aroma. Fruity and sweet malt nose with some sourness from the wheat malts. Quite amazing actually, its like smelling a chocolate and cherry cream pie. Smells appetizing. Taste is light and fruity, with a slight metallic-tannic tinge to it. Pleasant hop bitterness peeks its head out of all that fruitiness. Some lactic sourness comes through. Medium to light body and overall a refreshing and drinkable change of pace. I enjoyed it."
"This is a nice dessert beer, my second favorite fruit wheat beer, behind Abita's Purple Haze raspberry wheat. I don't think I could drink many of them in a sitting, it's a very sweet beer."
"Well, another one of those beers that is what it is. Not exactly great, not exactly horrible, just in the middle average. Though I'd have one again, it's not exactly something I'd hunt down."
"Not usually a flavored beer guy I decide to buy a six pack of this, anyway. I figured Sam Adams hasn't let me down yet, why not. It pours a very hazy orange amber with little head that recedes very quickly. The smell of cherry is very strong. It smells like a jar of maricino cheeries. The taste is also very strong in the cherry aspect. It's all I can really taste. I'm giving it a good grade because it really delivers what the name implies. But This isn't a drink I can have too often. It is a little too sweet. It's like a candy in many ways."
"Notes: start the night with your favorites, then step to the cherry wheat, your tastebuds wont be mad at you for trying to sneak on past 'em. I disagree with the cherry flavored addative. The lack of added artificial ingredients is why I love my other Sams."
"This one poured a cloudy golden color with a thick off white head. The smell is strong on cherry flavor with a little bit of fresh baked bread in there as well. The taste was quite unusual at first but I liked it the more I drank it. Starts out very strong in cherry flavor. Sweet at first then tarty towards the end. Wheat provides the base and is also a strong flavor. The two flavors mix well together. The finish is acidic and dry. It is also very crisp. This wasn't the most complex brew in the world, but I could definitely see myself drinking it on a hot summer day."
"This beer is a very mild flavored beer, with a noticeable cherry flavor. It has a cloudy wheat-like appearance and the wheat flavor is indeed also noticeable. This is one of my husband's favorite beers (and he considers it a ""guilty pleasure"" because it is artificially flavored.) It isn't very hoppy or malty. There are times when you want one of these, it quenches thirst well."
"As it is, I'm glad I only purchased a single just so I could have the bottle for my collection. This is the only beer I've had recently that I definately will not be buying again."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: For me, at least, off the chart. If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it. I drink some of the other SA products, but this is what I think of when I think of beer. Outstanding. A bit more cherry up front on the taste, a bit more head, and a bit drier, and this would have been a five across the board. I truly do love this beer."
"Well I had high hopes for this beer, and I was very let down. It pours a very promising gold color with a nice thick white head, which went away fairly quick. The smell was decent, smelled like a typical weat or ale, with a very small cherry smell. The overall flavor was quite bland, not much of anything stood out other than the artificial cherry taste and an odd aftertaste. I dont think I would buy another 6pk of this, although i may try it on tap sometime, to see if its any better."
"I had this previously on draft, and the bottled version seemed to have more flavor. All in all, a refreshing brew..if unspectacular. A nice appearance..light copper with a decent head. Smell was mainly a strong cherry aroma...with virtually no wheaty elements. Taste likewise was strong on cherry, but not a whole lot more...This might be an excellent alternative for cider drinkers. Medium mouthfeel. Drinkability was ok....although the overemphasis on cherry was a bit much. If you like the flavor of cherries, try it. If not, I would stay away."
"Pours a interesting lager like yellow with a hint of red, adequate head. Actually smells like cherries, surprisingly enough. Taste is only meh. True enough, cherries are a distinct flavor along with the hops, and reasonably complex. The trouble is, for me the whole package just doesnt do anything for me. I dont feel the cherry taste complements the beer in any way, it just overrides it. Cheers to Sam Adams for trying an interesting brew to say the least, but nothing special here."
"Pale golden color with a long lasting short head and lace till the end. If you like cherries, you might like this one. A little heavy on the artifical flavoring though. The nose is full of sweet dark cherry aroma with a slight malt background. The taste is full of cherry followed by the malt. A lingering cherry aftertaste. A fun beer to drink but not one I'd drink very often. Kinda like a flavored coffee. It's okay once in awhile but it's best without all the flavorings."
"When poured it was a light golden yellow with very little foam. The smell of cherries was very evident along with a hint of a yeasty wheat aroma. The taste of cherries was pleasant but sort of short on the after taste and very little wheat in the finish. Not what I expected, but, it could have been worst. An average beer from Samuel Adams that I will not purchase again!"
"Not nearly as girly as I might have guessed. I'll drink this from time to time."
"A decent, balanced beer overall."
"On tap at Logan Airport. Clear red color with a nice sticky head that leaves lacing after every sip. Smell is of tart cherry cough syrup and a bit of sour wheat. Taste is smooth, more cherry cough syrup with a decent malt balance and a touch of hops. Not bad, one of my early favorites and introductions to the world of good beer."
"Whole lot better than I expected. Enjoyed this at the bar next to the movie theatre before watching Kill Bill. Poured a little darker than a typical lager. Pretty dark for a wheat. Large white head,good lacing, etc. I didn't bother to smell it because I was in a crowded bar. Taste was very much like their Summer Ale, with only a hint of cherry if any. Drinkability was pretty high. I enjoyed it and it was a little bland, but refreshing."
"Color is a hazy deep golden yellow with a thin off-white head that fades somewhat fast, lace is spotty. Aroma reminds me of watered down cherry flavored cough syrup, or maybe kool-aid, theres some wheat malts giving an overall sweetness in with the flat cherryness that seems artificial to me. A powerful nose as it warms but seems almost to much and a bit artificial. Taste is sweet malts of wheat, pale and soft, with a kick of cherry tart flavor thats a bit to sweet and again comes across somewhat artificial and syrupy. A little hard to get past the cherryness with a bubbly carbonation and lighter feel that nearly makes it champagne-like. As it warms it becomes alot easier to handle and makes for a nice drinker but I don't think I'd have alot of this before the flavor starts to get old."
"This is an easy drinking brew (unless you get sickened easy by sweet stuff). This could be served as an after-dinner or desert beer. Just make sure you like cherries before trying this one."
"Next time Sam Adams wants to make a cherry wheat, they should use real cherries....and more than an ounce of wheat grain!"
"Looked like it wasnt going to be a decent wheat, nice golden hazy color, decent white head which stayed, but alas the taste was the downfall. Cherry, cherry, and more cherry not the good cherry either mind you, the cheap caugh syrup type cherry....yuuuck. Behind the cherry theyre was little to tell, not much hop to it, just seemed clean. Unfortunately the horrid cherry flavor masked a decent american wheat, my advice to boston beer, use natural cherry flavor."
"Very tasty, this is definitely a great gateway beer, perfect for those friends with a sweet tooth. Smooth and very fruity, this is still decent for those with a more refined palate. I can only drink 2-3 of these. The sweetness gets to be a little too much after a while."
"when i first heard about this beer, i emailed the sam adams web page to ask if the cherry flavors were all natural, and they replied that they use all natural ingredients. being naive, i believed them, and bought the beer without first examining the labels on the six pack. sure enough, i get home and the label reads something like ""with natural cherries and cherry flavor added"" (i'm paraphrasing). which means they are most likely stretching the word ""natural"" to its utmost limits. the cherries smelled and tasted like cough medicine, artificial to the core, which is a shame, because the beer has a great-tasting wheat background, that, if combined with more subtle, natural-tasting cherry flavors, would have resulted in a great beer. as it is, though, it seems as if sam adams is either stretching the truth a bit with their claim of all natural ingredients, or has somehow made real cherries smell and taste like red kool aid with cough drops swimming in it. a real disappointment, but then again, i've tasted far worse. i'd choose it over most macros, but wouldn't recommend drinking it if you can help it."
"Overall: Well, I have not had this before, so I decided to try it. But to be honest, even the small 16oz sample was far too sickly-cherry for me, maybe it would be OK as a dessert beer though. It is not a bad beer, far from it; it just has too much cherry flavoring to make it more than the occasional beer I believe."
"I'm a big fan of this beer and have had it in bottle, on tap in different locations and even on tap at the brewery. The bottle is a little disapointing to be honest, but on tap this beer is simply amazing. Fresh cherries and soft clean crisp malt. An often overlooked and laughed at beer that just proves Sam Adams still makes damn good beer."
"To its credit, another decent and somewhat refreshing beer from Sam Adams. In my opinion, Sam Adams sometimes doesn't get the credit it deserves. This isn't their best, but it's more than drinkable. Drink up."
"Translucent tawny/orangey-gold hue. White head, moderate size (less than a half inch), decent retention. Spotty, unorganized lace. Very nice nose, the potency of the cherries (which seem very similar to pie filling) is ideally strong but not overbearing. The invitation is well received. The palate is a wheaty cherry pie with a faint hint of medicinal qualities (like cough syrup). The sweetness is present but not cloying the tartness is very distant, the wheat is definitely noticeable. The finish is clean, curt, and refreshing (more so than expected). The carbonation is ideal. The mouthfeel is medium-light, a touch thin. SA Cherry Wheat is like Thanksgiving dinner/fall hayrack rides in a glass. Decent enough, Id buy a six-pack of this one again... its not girly. Try one."
"Fairly potent aroma of cherries, yet not really overpowering. Decent enough amber color, and a bit cloudy. The taste has a good wheat backbone, with the cherries more than fairly evident. A little more cherry, and it would be too much. Very good, but I can't drink too many of them."
"I will say up front that I am typically not a flavored beer fan (lambics notwithstanding! :)). This one by Sam Adams is actually rather refreshing in the summer months if you are looking for a change of pace. The wheat aspect of the beer comes through rather nicely. However, I think they really overdo it with the cherry flavoring, as it does tend to overpower the subtleties of this brew. All in all a nice addition to the flavored beer arena, and I could session with this one if I were in the mood for it."
"Don't know what it is but I really enjoy this beer. It is very refreshing with a nice blast of cherry but not overwhelming. It is a great summer/fall beer. Has a nice wheat/ale underlying taste. Not like a regular wheat beer but a definite light taste. Would go great with the right meal."
"Appears an amber orange filtered hue with a thin cream head topping it off. Aroma is full of artificial marciano cherry esque sweetness almost overbearingly cherry no balance from anyother aromas in there, just potent cherries. Taste well, in the background some malt sweetness along with the same bready Sam Adams characteristic flavor that exists in all of BBC's beers. What makes this beer near untolerable is the rush of cherry extract that becomes cloying and not drinkable or enjoyable like candy. Mouthfeel fizzy carbonation lighter bodied with slight syrupy mouthfeel to it. Drinkability pass on this gimmick cherry wheat and go find a good beer, pass on this grotesque cloying answer to wheat beer fads."
"This beer has an emmaculent apperance. Clear and inviting. It has a very pleasing aroma as well. It has an excellent taste of cherry that is accompanied by a nice hint of malt that plays against the cherry very well. I typically find wheat beers to be a bit too spicy for my taste, but this wheat beer is excellent."
"Poured a standard to dark yellow, with a bubbly, medium-sized white head. Lots of bubbles rising up. Smell is dominated by cherry scent--cherry syrup more than fresh cherries (a la New Glarus). Taste starts with the cherry syrup. Not overly sweet (thank God!). Finish is slightly dry and bitter, with hints of cherry lingering. Pretty well balanced. Mouthfeel is nothing special. The cherry syrup flavor would/will prevent me from drinking this often."
"The beer pours a pretty clear golden color with virtually no head . This style calls for both hazy color and good head retention. The aroma is out of this world. The sweet smell of cherries overpowers you at first smell. A great aroma! The taste however is pretty weak. There is still that taste of cherries, but it's not as strong as the odor. There is also a very clean beer taste here. Look, wheat beers are supposed to be hazy. They are supposed to taste like wheat malt; not pale ale. The mouthfeel is good. The body is very light and it drinks easy. Again, wheat beers are best when they are left alone. These big breweries think they need to clean them up to sell more, but in the process they lose the drinkers that got them going."
"A dark golden with a rather thick foamy head. The obvious aroma is of cherry and malt overtones. A sharp, yet pleasant fruit taste, creamy cherry pie, malt in the background. Bordering on medium bodied. Refreshing and not too overpowering for an APA."
"Taste is smooth and easy, pleasant cherry taste and not anywhere near as sweet as it smells. Decent malt balance, a touch of yeast, and slightly more than average carbonation make this a genuine entry for a fruit flavored beer instead of just dumping in some fruit juice at the end and calling it so. A good beer to have with dessert and a fine session brew for the fall or spring."
"I was hoping to try a different selection from the Boston Beer Factory as my first review from them, but this was all the bar had. Poured a gold colour with a little cloudy & haziness sediment. Whoof, smell them cherries from a mile away. Wheat too, and a little other grain. Hey, I don't smell adjunct. I'll be damned. Tasted I'd say 3/5000 too sweet. Just a little sweeter than I thought. Had to mark points off for that. But hey, the wheat is detectable on the palate, as is a little yeast. That suited this beer. But then the cherries are detected. Hmm, didn't like it. I don't like cherries, so excuse my bias. The cherry flavour seemed a little like childrens' cough syrup. Damn. But that's okay. I still like this beer. It's crisp, a little sour/tart, and I do taste some diacetyl. An above average beer. My advice, add a little more bitterness and a little less cherries."
"I ordered this beer to top off my evening after eating ribs. I opened it up and was struck by the blatant cherry smell. It poured a nice white head that slowly discipated. The tast was overwhelming cherry followed by wheat. it was very smooth but lacked a nice consistency. It was a nice beer to top off the night. I definitely could not have more than one of these a sitting."
"Fortunately I think this beer has a lot of uses in the kithchen!"
"AIBA 2003: artificial cherry aroma, candy like flavours, sweetish, but dries out a touch towards the end, abit stupid, but not all that bad. Maybe a nice one for the friend who doesn't like beer, or anything that resembles anything complex . Didn't really get into it."
"A nice limpid golden amber to copper color with a modest head and decent lace to coat the glass, Nose has a nice sweet hint of cherries, and the underlying malts add much to the appeal. Start sweet, the top light in its feel, the finish overly acidic, the hops adequate with the aftertaste dry. A drinkable beer, but not something I'm wild about, but many will like it."
"Hazyish orange color with a skim head that persists pretty well...slightly plastic phenolic aroma -- cherry smells are slightly artificial in the ""Mountain Dew Code Red"" category. Slighly husky grainy malt flavors, cherry is mercifully subdued but seeming overly sweet to my tongue. Mouthfeel ranges to the overcarbonated side for me, but finishes fairly dry and composed in aftertaste. Lacks the pithy astringency of a well-done Lambic -- but this brew is less offensive than some other Fruit Experimental brews from this side of the pond. I just can't recommend it as drinkable..."
"Had a surprisingly above average appearance.Poured a giant head a reduced slowly leaving chunky white lace everywhere.The color is a hazy gold to an almost orange.Aroma is all cherries and smells quite good.Has a slight bitterness and a somewhat watery mouthfeel.A light body with no real malt presence.Extremely light with a sweet cherry taste.Not too complex here.Could use more malt to thickens things up a bit.Light and refreshing.Would be great on a hot day.Other than that its nothing to write home about.Lacked in crispness and carbonation."
"This isnt a bad drink. I will admit this is the first cherry flavored beer that i have had, so i dont have much to compare it to. Not much of a head on the pour, a slightly dark yellow color. It does taste like cherrys, but it is not too overpowering, the beer flavor still comes through. If youre going to be sitting outside this summer, i would say give it a try."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and it far exceded my expectations. It poured a medium golden color with a decent white head. The first thing that caught me was the smell of cheries, very cool. The taste was good, with a malty start, then the cheries kicked in, then a little bit of a crisp, bitter finnish. This is not a beer I could drink everyday, but on occation it would work very well."
"Pours very nicely, wheat yellow in color. Nice head and lacing, typical of SA. The smell is very appealing. It smells of cherries, but not overpoweringly so. Taste is rich and smooth, somewhat sweet. You get the cherry and wheat flavors mingling well. This is a special occasion beer, in my unsophisticated opinion. Great price for a beer of this caliber."
"F."
"The color is golden-orange, and there's a bit of a haze. White head on top, which stays fairly well. The aroma is all about sweet maraschino cherries. I think I'm getting some slight metallic aromas as well, that could just be the cherries though. Either way, that aspect of the aroma isn't the most pleasing. Makes it smell artificial. The flavor shows more promise. Lots of cherries again, but backed up by a generous amount of wheaty/malty character, especially for a medium-bodied beer. Hop bitterness makes it crisp and clean. Very slightly metallic and a bit artificial tasting. But hey, better than I expected. It could use some work though."
"Had this on-tap at the Sam Adams Brewhouse in Boston. Was a golden color with a fairly small head. Nose was definitely fruity cherry. Light to medium bodied. Taste was dry wheat malt, obvious cherry. Very crisp. A little on the bitter side. Not too bad. I've had this in the bottle also, but tap is better."
"This brew poured a cloudy golden color with a quarter inch white head and good lacing. Actually it had awesome lacing. The aroma is all cherry with maybe a little bit of a malty note. I expected the taste to be all cherry as well but much to my surprise it was not. I mean of course there was some cherry taste but it wasn't overwhelming. The cherry hits up front followed by a malty sweetness. One thing I didn't like about the cherry flavor, it seemed artificial. I was expecting a natural cherry flavor but it was more like a cherry syrup type of taste. I looked at the bottle and it said made with real cherries but it also said cherry flavoring added. Overall I didn't think this beer was too bad, it surprised me. It won't become a regular but I would definitely drink it again."
"This beer has been a staple in my fridge for about 4 summers now. It has sweetness but still stays refreshing. I don't think the cherry flavor is overdone either."
"Over all a bit above average for a flavored beer in my book. Drink ability is ok. I dont know if I would drink this for a session brew but a few here and there.I could do that"
"I was offered this at a college party. I normally don't mine fruity brews, but this is just downright aweful! Yuck!!! I taste the cherry and I taste the wheat, but why does it have to taste so bad? The balances are way off or something. Sam Adams sure messed up with this one. Side note: maybe they didn't mess up because this seems to be rather popular. People like lousy beer though."
"I have been looking forward to reviewing this one as Sam Adams Cherry Wheat has been one of my favorite beers for a long time. This is the perfect beer for a hot Texas summer day sitting by the pool and waiting for the steaks to go on the grill :). I only wish I could have given the appearance a better score so that this beer could receive a perfect 5."
"A really nice pour with a good cake of cream-colored foam and effervescence one expects in a wheat beer. Laces nicely throughout the drink. Color is a nearly clear gold--not striking but certainly not unpleasant. Candied cherry aromas dominate the smell. While appealing, these notes smother the wheat more than balance it. The taste is more even than the smell, with the crisp grains melding rather nicely with the cherry flavors, which are a bit more tart than those found in the nose. Tastes more like a wheat beer as the cherry taste fades away into a rather crisp, dry finish. A more complex flavor profile than one finds in many fruit beers. Mouthfeel is stickier than in typical wheat beers, and the strength of the cherry scents and flavors likewise makes this beer less appealing that most wheats."
" *Quench your sweet tooth.*"
"I don't know what I was thinking giving this beer a decent review earlier. Medium amber with hint of red color. Moderately carbonated with quickly disappearing head. Syruppy sweet cherry aroma with trace of almost underfermented beer to it. Very sweet, cloying like a lollipop. Slippery mouthfeel. Tastes like a cheap soda. Skip this one."
"I got this on draft and it arrived with a thin film on top, not the classic head as from the bottle.I wondered why? Anyway all good from there, it even managed to lace fairly well. This is my favorite fruit stand-by beer. From its aroma to taste, its cherries all the way. Its cherry-pie tart, slighty sweet but yet crisp to the mouth. I like this brew anytime of year, its just that good."
"Pours hazy-cloudy golden yellow color, nice big creamy white head, leaves a clingy lace to the sides of my glass, sweet fruity cherry aroma. Flavor of cherries and wheat, very sweet, tart cherry flavor, almost sour, I guess this is OK for a fruit beer."
"chery wheat has to be one of my favorite beers. the taste is exceptional, the flavor excelllent. i am flabergasted by the bad reviews about this beer. this is a high quality beer, the cherry flavor isnt overpowering. this is a great beer i reccomend it for anyone."
"Auburn color with a thin light beige head. Very strong cherry aroma. There was just too much cherry in the flavor making it almost sickeningly sweet. It doesn't even taste like cherries, more like the cherry flavoring they use to make popsicles or something. I honestly didn't bother finishing the bottle. This wasn't horrible, but they really need to tone down the cherry or balance it better with more malt."
"The first time I had this was at a local restaurant and it was summer time.  I was looking for a good wheat beer to go with the hogie that I ordered.  The waitress said that the only one was the Sam Adams Cherry Wheat.  I tried it and was suprised how good this one was, since I was going in blind.  The cherry was there but not over powering with no after taste.  This was a very smooth tasting beer.  Left the mouth with a nice feeling, not to full.  Enjoyed this so much that I went out the next day and bought a case.  Great thirst quencher for any time of year !"
"Like cherry coke, the fascination made me try this one. It had the same effect. I t tasted like someone had dropped a Hall's Brothers cough drop into a beer and refused to dump it. The cherry is very annoying."
"Hazy gold with a decent head that retains a very nice lace. Cherry aroma hits immediatly. Crisp and dry with some cherry flavor and bitterness. Very refreshing but not what to get when looking for a beer. Good for a change of pace during the dog days of summer."
"Definitely not my favorite beer, or even my favorite SA. Has a slightly sour medicinal quality to the cherry in both the aroma and flavor. Not much to back it up. I'm starting the think that wheat beers just weren't meant to be fruit flavored."
"Nice copper color with a fluffy cream colored head. The bubbles are not that tight, but OK. The head lasts really well and leaves a little Belgian-lace. The aroma is very inviting, fruity - and yes, cherry - with sweet malt. A touch candyish but not off putting in any way. It has a medium body and the mouthfeel is fairly full. The flavor has a good combination of fruit and sweet, very lightly caramel malt. 	It does develop a somewhat medicinal, cherry cough drop flavor after a few sips. There's very little bitterness and yet it doesn't seem cloying; although it does seem to coat the tongue (must be the combination of residual malt sugars and extract flavor). The finish is limited, but the aftertaste lingers and seems to flip flop between a nice fruitiness and the medicinal quality. Overall, this beer seems to have improved over the years. A nice change of pace during the hot summer months."
"The hazy orange / amber hued brew is topped by a fairly dense ivory - white head that leaves a decent lace down the glass. Cherry absolutely overwhelms the aroma and is quite overbearing... any other malt notes or hop nose is completely masked.  The taste is also dominated by a cloying cherry extract flavor, and as the beer warms an odd marzipan flavor becomes noticeable.  This beer is an epitomy of inbalance-- the fruit extract prevents the malt profile to surface.  Finishes sweet, w/ a lingering offputting sugary cherry candy sweetness.  There are fruit beers that are drinkable... this is not one of them."
"This is a very nice fruit wheat beer.  The most dominant characteristic is the cherry aroma.  It's inescapable.  Nice wheat-beer haze in a deep golden color.  The beer has a decent sized white head, and a pleasing balance.  Not as sweet as I anticipated."
"the first one i had didn't have a real strong cherry taste to it, but after that i have had a few that you can barely taste the beer. this is a good beer if you are in the mood for it and that is all i can say. it goes down great, but if you are looking for a true beer, it is not what you are looking for. it is very fruity"
"This is tasty lighter brew with more than a hint of the fruit within.  I found it to be very popular among the not-into-beer crowd.  Goes down easy on a hot summer night."
"I used to think this was the best beer I could buy in Florida, then I started to look around. I had it again, after about a year without. Golden/reddish color, nice fuzzy head. Smells like a bowl full of cherries. After drinking quality wheat beers, I think this tastes more like a pilsner or light lager. Whatever you want to call it, it's very bubbly, carbonated, and heavily flavored. After the first couple drinks, the cherry fizziness seems to dominate. No more than one of these at a time, please. I think the Marin blueberry and peach ale is more subtle and balanced."
"Sam Adams Cherry Wheat:  Nice looking beer, with a deep amber color, and nice long lasting, off-white head.  The aroma is all Cherry, with a hint of cough syrup.  Its got the mouth feel of a wheat, but the cherry flavor is very prevalent, and lasts a long, long time.  Not really my cup of tea."
"slightly hazy light copper in color, minimal head which disappears quickly.  pleasant light cherry aroma.  tastes of sweet cherries, but it's certainly not too sweet or overbearing.  light bodied and one can detect the wheat malt used.  a very crisp and dry finish.  not a bad beer and would be a good summertime quaffer."
"Nice rich red, doesn't quite hold a head though. Smells like a basket of cherries soaked in ginger-ale. Pleasant but not overbearing taste. A bit thin and a bit too sweet on the finish. Really a good beer overall though."
"The aroma is the best part of this beer. Very fruity smell. The cherry taste is good, but not overbearing. A refreshing beer.  I'm good for a sixer to two of this every year.  Any more than that and the cherry taste gets a bit much."
"One of my favorite beers. Pours a nice reddish-brown, and the smell is delicious. This definitely isn't a beer that can be drank in mass quantities; it's more of a ""sippin' a few with the boys"" beer, or a dessert beer. The cherry taste is definitely present, but is not overwhelming. I have found this to be a beer that people either love or hate, and I love it. Definitely worth trying."
"Hazy golden color with a large white head, lots of lace.  Aroma is dominated by tart cherries and wheat undertones.  Taste is very crisp and refreshing, tart cherries and alcohol come across strongly, a touch of bitterness at the end.  Crisp and refreshing, a very nice summer beer."
"I love Sam Adam's but the Cherry taste was just to much, not balanced at all."
"Again, a nice change-up, but I doubt I'd purchase this again.  If I am looking for a light-hearted, drinkable brew, I'll stick with some sort of hefeweizen"
"When I was first introducing the wife to the wonderful world of beer, this was a favorite of hers. Not bad really, kind of a nice, tarty changeup from the usual. Hazy appearance with light cherry flavor and a somewhat effervescent mouthfeel."
"background with this 'beer'."
"Notes: A great mix of flavours for a decent fruit beer. Nice and refreshing."
