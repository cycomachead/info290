Especially for a summer beer, this is refreshing and light. In smell, the blueberries come out overwhelmingly, but in taste, the blueberry notes are far more subtle. Likely not a beer I will buy again, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone interested in trying fruit beers.","sheeley","Aug 19, 2014"

3.35,3.4,,,,,,"Single bottle from a summer mixed pack poured into a flute. Color is a hazy orange-yellow amber topped by a moderate amount of creamy white head. Aroma is rather unassuming and perhaps bland: Generic pale malt (a little husky), a whiff of grassy and hay-like noble hops and of course the expected blueberry, although this is subtle. On the palate, the latter comes across like a sweet jam rather than fresh fruit, which is OK in my book although the fruit effect does precious little to temper what I feel are some pretty astringent grainy notes in the background. As advertised, a little citrus emerges (lemon?) ... Highly carbonated and on the thin side, with a finish that is a tad medicinal, grass and bitter green fruit. Finish might be a strong suit here. I'd say the merit here is in the fruit being tastefully executed and the usual Sam Adams expertise with noble hopping. On the minus side of the ledger, I am not feeling the malts ... The grainy metallic note described earlier sticks out like a sore thumb. Not an essential offering from this brewery.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 17, 2014"

Blueberry hill Lager is a unfiltered brew you can not see thought it. The smell is sweet with blueberries and a hit of grains. This brew is different from most brews on the market as far as the smell. It is not bad it is just different. The taste is mild with blueberries and that is about it. There is not much to the taste of this brew. This brew does go down smooth and clean. The mouthfeel is nice and clean, also refreshing. There is nothing overpowering in this brew; it has an ok balanace to it . I was hoping for more in this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a solid 4 out 5.","nicholas2121","Aug 02, 2014"

3.9,20.4,3.75,4.25,4,3,3.75,"Sam Adams' Blueberry Hill Lager - Not their best fruit beer, but good nonetheless. Out of the bottle is has a surprisingly hazy hue to it. You can see the carbonation and it pours a thick, white head that has nice staying power and lacing. The odor emitted is simply awesome. A nice mixture of blueberries, oranges, and hops that mixes oh so well in your nose. The mouthfeel was mostly disappointing - too much aftertaste for my liking. Taste-wise it was pretty good - the blueberries don't quite mix as well with the citrus as the bottle tries to lead you to believe, but it's not altogether too bad. Overall, it's almost outstanding, but certainly very good.","jjamadorphd","Jun 06, 2014"

The appearance was a very hazy yellow, almost amber with a white hail that dissipated quickly. The smell was all blueberries. I was a bit worried before my first taste, but my worry was quickly gone. The blueberries added a nice layer on top of the lager that I thought made for a nice sweet beer for the hot day. It was very thin for the sweet flavors, but a great beer to mow your lawn with.","WhiteHillsStore","May 28, 2014"

This beer had good drinkability, it was very smooth, clean, refreshing, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these on a warm summer day, but the blueberry might wear on me after that. What I liked the most about this beer was how nicely the blueberry was showcased, there wasn't any point were the blueberrys felt artificial. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, it was great for what they were going for and I can't think of anything that was wrong with it or that I wish was changed, it was nice just the way it is. I might buy this beer again if they sold it on it's own, i wouldn't turn down one of these on a warm summer day and I think it would be a nice beer to keep on hand for people that aren't too experienced with craft beer, I would recommend it to anyone who likes fruit or blueberry beers, even the regular lager drinker might enjoy this. All in all I was happy with this beer, I started to expect the worst since I haven't had the best track record with Blueberry beers, but this one was surprisingly nice and it may change how I feel about the style. Good job Sam Adams, you guys nailed what your were going for and I have no doubt that this will make a great gateway beer into the craft beer scene for a lot of people, nice work.","StoutHunter","May 28, 2013"

Regardless, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises syrupy blueberry (y'know, thick and partially artificial without bashing you over the head with it's fakeness) over a carpet of very light biscuit, barely hanging on for dear life against the torrent of berry. The taste proves my suspicions about the artificiality were warranted (if still wrong in full reality) as some plastic weeds its way into the berries. In the background, those touted noble hops serve only to provide a clashing foil of greenery for the berries, muddying the waters into a bayou of unhappiness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thankfully dry and quick finish. Overall, things just didn't go well with this one, as the berries come across as fake and the hops battle rather than bolster the fruitiness. It's not as bad as the horridity that was the Cranberry Lambic, but it's certainly nowhere near good, either.","TMoney2591","Apr 19, 2013"
