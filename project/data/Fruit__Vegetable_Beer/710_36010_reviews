"Tasted like pledge smells this beer is horrible"
"Perfect break from IPA'S.  A refreshing alternative to malt lemonade. Definitely summer in a bottle."
"Smooth light refreshing lemon with great taste"
""
"O-  it's okay, not as good as I remembered.  Great for guzzling on a hot day though!"
""
""
""
"Had this beer at a company party. It was surprisingly tasty. Strong lemon notes but it was smooth almost malty. Overall very enjoyable and easy to drink!"
""
""
"Delicious perfect summertime awesome beer"
""
"Good refreshing summer beer. Not a purist's beer. Great for a summer outing when a porter or stout would be too heavy."

"Purchased at Total Wine summer 2012."
"Nice midday hot summer beverage"

""
"great during a hot summer day but can only drink a few before they become to sweet"
"I don't like this one too much, it's a weird Weissbier with some sort of ""lemonade"" flavoring... the best thing about this beer is that is has alcohol."
""
""
"First Summer Beer I Had And Loved It"
""
""
""
""
"I do not write reviews."
""
"Nice summertime beer with a slice of orange."
""
""
"Great summer beer for cookouts or the beach."
""
""
"mow the lawn and then partake in one of these... best they will ever taste"
""
"Sweet lemony taste, great on the golf course or a patio on a hot day"
"Leinenliugel's - Honey Weiss. This wasn't as bad, You could taste the honey in it. It wasn't a particular strong wheat beer or that memorable seeing how I just drank it and nothing really stands out."
""
""
"Awesome summer brew, take a case to the beach or a bbq and party!"
""
"Great summer beer. Not a Dan of sweet fruit beers, but this has more tangy lemon flavors rather than sweet candy flavors."
"This beer has a prominent lemonade taste.  It is tailor-made for a summer's day."
""
"Fine beer for some people, but not for me."
"Looks light and like lemonade but nothing better in the summer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Tried to figure out if I was drinking lemon pledge or carbonated lemonade with a strong alcohol feel."
""
"Got the Lemon PERFECT!  So refreshing!  Can't keep enough around for wife."
"Enjoy this beer on a hot summer eve. Also a good beer to cook with. Packers suck!!"

"Not a Shandy fan but, I try them. Try any beer once."
""
""
""
""
"A great summer beer. Highly recommend"
""
"Overall, this is a thirst quenching beer. It definitely will grow on you!"
""
""
"I had a bottle of this beer on a recent trip to Las Vegas.  I saw it on the menu and had to try it.  It was very refreshing and I ordered a second bottle.  Goes well with any summer foods like bbq chicken!  Not an everyday kinda beer, but an enjoyable tongue twister you should sample when you get a chance!"
""
""
"Absolutely one of my favorites"
"Awesome summer beer. Very smooth on a tender pallet"
""
"Refreshing and perfect for warm weather."
"Overall, it was a mediocre drink with faint grainy/ wheat taste. Nothing but lemons, lemons, and lemons. I'm not drinking this again."
""
""
"Too Cloudy. Strong lemon, tastes more like candy than beer."
""
"Good Summer beer but not for the hardcore beer enthusiast.. good to drink on a hot day by the pool when you dont want to feel full"
""
""
"I think all of Leinenkugels' fruit beers are the same: fruity and delicious, but leave you wishing they had something more distinguishing than which fruit is in this particular beer you're drinking at that moment."
""

"Refreshing beverage. Not too sweet."

"Not a huge fan of shandy style beers, but this beer is a great hot day session beer if you like lemon."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into tumbler. Dirty yellow color. Smell is lemon and yeast. Taste is like a dirty lemonade. Light carbonation. No head. Decent lacing. Did not like this at all."

"While it isn't up there with some of the great craft beers out now, there is still nothing more refreshing after mowing a lawn in 90 degree heat."
""
""
""
"Different strokes for different folks on this one. I think Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy is awesome. It is a great summer beer when its hot as hell and you want something refreshing. Lemon beer sounds like a hideous combination admittledly but this is good stuff.  I usually like beer from a glass, but here I prefer drinking from the can or bottle.  Technically, this isn't good beer but a good shandy and should be judged as such.  This is much better than the 72 rating would suggest."

"It tastes exactly like the style it is meant to emulate, all in one bottle.  Better on tap or from a can, doesn't taste quite right from a bottle.  Great for hot summertime drinking."

"Pours very hazy golden color with thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are actually very good with this one.  Has basically a zesty, lemon aroma.  There is a light malty backbone followed by that lemon zest when drinking.  Refreshing on a hot summer day, but there is no complexity.  More like hard lemonade if you ask me."

"i enjoy most Leinenkugels but Summer Shandy would be my best guess at what Pine Sol tastes like.  Most of my friends enjoy it so it must be my messed up taste buds!"

"All beer is relative to the day, a hot day in Southern California with limited refreshing options in the store, not a double IPA day based on my weather and yard work, ~90 outside. I prefer lemon beer to lemonade on this frustration day. It agrees with me. Give it a try on a hot day, I don't think you will mind it's company. It's got more than you deserve."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very refreshing, but as the beer warms it loses the refreshing taste. The lemon nuances are definitely there. Best served ice cold."

"Exactly what I was expecting. I love lemon in the summertime. This brew is exactly what it should be. Light. Citrus. Delicious. Perfect for drinking by the pool side or in the hot sun. So much better a choice than a BMC IMO. As the sun begins to set, so too, set this aside for something more robust and interesting. But in the heat of the day....very cool."

"I had to try it after seeing commercials on it and people talk about how good it is. So I got a 12 pack at the store for $14 so I thought by that it would be good. Its a Lemonade flavored light beer but very disappointing. I thought it would taste like beer and Lemonade mixed but instead it tastes mainly of Lemonade with a slight hint of beer taste. I have tried other flavored beers such as Samuel Adams Blueberry beer and its right on. Its equal alcohol and blueberry taste. I will stick to plain, non flavored light beer. I recommend this beer to anyone who doesn't like the beer taste yet wants to drink a beer. I would drink this again as long as its free but I won't buy this again."

"Overall, an okay light beer. Without the lemonade background in its making, this would be very mediocre. As is, it's good enough past mediocre to be okay. I like it."

"As new to beer drinking I wanted to try something on the lighter side. I got one in my make your own 6 pack. It came in a bottle so can't really say on appearance. Decent looking label. Smells highly of lemon and citrus tastes the same as it smells. Really easy beer to drink."

"Overall: I'm surprised by the overall rating on this beer. I think this beer is fantastic. It think it's the ideal party beer for both craft beer lovers and ""non-craft"" beer drinkers. I think this beer can be appreciated by the masses. It's not amazing, but it's LEAPS AND BOUNDS, better than all the lime flavor lagers produced by the big guys. This was one of the beers that made me start to appreciate the finer beers."

"Not an everyday beer for me personally, but it certainly has it's time and place and is well done for what it is."
""
""
""
""
"Probably my favorite shandy out there right now. Decent appearance with a hazy yellow and a very thin fizzy head. The smell was mostly lemons but with a little bit of malt. The taste was similar with a lot of lemonade but a subtle finish where you get a little bit of hop and malt to make the end of the beer not so sweet. A fine shandy to drink on a hot day."

""
""
""
""

"Well it's better than those stupid lemon-flavored bud lights but you'll look just as gay drinking it. It tastes like beer mixed with cheap fake lemonade. I swear, you could sell this stuff at a lemonade stand and kids wouldn't know the difference. It tastes like lemonade -which is fine if you like your beers sweet and artificially flavored- but I don't. I bought a 12 pack of these and now I feel obligated to drink them. Maybe I'm being too harsh, the beer is great for being lemonade flavored, but why did I just buy lemonade-flavored beer?"

"If I see this draft again it is my go to."
""
"O- So far the best ""summer shandy"" type that I've tried. Definitely sessionable. Will be going to pick up some more once summer rolls around."
""
"if you don't want a strong beer but rather a crisp lemon taste with a little beer taste, get this. if not, i don't know."
""
"Overall - was kind of let down. Should focus more on the BEER aspect."
""
""
"O- okay feels like I'm drinking beer mixed with lemonade but definitely refreshing on a hot day"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not awful, but it's nowhere near good either. Even among other shandies/beer cocktails, there are better options"
"This is my first shandy, and I'm let down. Lemonade plus good beer sounds delicious. This is lemonade plus mediocre beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good version of the style. Fuller body and a touch more flavorful than most other radlers I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light gold in color with intense haziness. Eggshell colored head covers part of the top of the beer. Intense aroma of lemon is all I get. The mouth is light and crisp. The flavor is dominated by the intense lemon flavor. That's rally all there is. Refreshing on a hot day. Would have enjoyed more if they had dialed back the lemon intensity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is beer that borders with kemonade. Teenagers would like it. It has wierd aftertaste that possible only with US made food chemicals. The idea is mix Real lemonade with Real Wheat beer. When brewed in Midwest as one unit it turned into chemical wierdness."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would recommend anyone that like citrus flavored beer to try this beer. You won't be disappointed. Cheers!"
"Overall-not a go to beer for me, but as a picnic or cooler addition worth a look"
""
""
"A take off of the German Radler. This is what children drink in Bavaria; although it doesn't come in one bottle, you take a pilsner or weisse and mix with lemonade. Certainly refreshing. A nice sweet drink after a long day working in the yard; really reminds of my time in the beer gardens of Munchen."

"I dont even know what type of beer the summer shandy is, but it is already one of my favorites. I probably couldn't drink more than 2 at a time or may get tired of the taste, but is a great treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Heavy mouthfeel for a light, summery kind of beer. Too chalky, and reminded me of Lemonheads candy too much. Just not my thing."

"This beer is best served ice-cold and on a hot summer day."
"Very good beer for warm weather. I really enjoy the lemon and beer combination in this recipe. An extremely light and crisp beer with just enough hops to make the flavor explode in your mouth. Very good beer to drink while eating at a barbeque with smoked meats."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent for a hot summer day, but does not have any outstanding qualities or attributes"
""
""
"This is probably my favorite summer beer. You can smell the lemon and citrus scents as soon as you get your nose near this beer. It tastes refreshing as soon as the beer touches your lips. Afterwards, you are left with a lemon taste in your mouth that is delicious."
""
""
"Definitely take it easy, as you can down 3-4 without even knowing you consumed them."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It is a fun beer to drink during the summer due to how refreshing and light it is. I would not be able to drink a lot of it but having a bottle every once in a while I can see myself doing."
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, just not my type of beer. Its crisp, clean and refreshing and i bet better on a hot summer day. However its mid April, not summer and this is already released? Whats next Oktoberfest in August? Anyway back on point, Hot day or not i would rather have a traditional Hefe over this any day."

"I have a hard time calling this a beer as there is nothing here that resembles a beer, or at least what I consider beer. That said, I enjoy it... A bit of a guilty pleasure if you will. Easy to drink and thirst-quenching. Definitely a good beverage for a hot, summer day."
""

"This is a great crisp light body summer Ale. Cool refreshing Lemony beer to enjoy at the end of a summer day. This is my go to beer great cook outs and camping. It pours with a nice head and great carbonation. This beer makes it really feel like summer is here."

"es, I know it’s from the majors, and it’s a shandy. But it was tasty and I didn’t feel dirty after drinking it and liking it, the way I thought I would have."

"Overall an inoffensive drink. Guess it works as a thirst quencher."
"Although there us a little maltiness detectable in this product, the predominant taste is much like cheap lemonade manufactured with reconstituted lemon juice. The alcohol content is so low, you can get much tastier summer refreshment by drinking good lemonade and adding alcohol of your choice. Dion't waste your money on this product."
"This is about what I expected from this beer. It's decent, but there's nothing special about it... there's a time and place for Summer Shandy."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is pretty gross. Wouldn't seek out."
""
""
""
""
"Over all: I am not a fan of these fruity summer beers. To be fair I had a 6 pack of these over a few days to give a review. The first one to me was horrible. The next not so bad. After finishing the pack this is really a refreshing summer drink. If you are looking for something with bold hops or really malty do not expect that with this beer. But it is definitely worth a try and you will enjoy it on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes like candy, the artificial lemon tasted isn't there for me. It tasted more like lemonade. I do taste some wheat in this beer, but the lemon is dominant in this beer. I would pick this beer up in the summer on a hot day. Sometimes you can't judge a book by it's cover. This beer isn't like a Bud Light Lime, or something of that nature."

"O-I grabbed this beer as a sort-of palate cleanser before heading out for dinner. Oops. I suppose the palate cleansing was accomplished but at the cost of a few hundred calories that I didn't really enjoy. This brew is kinda ugly, fake smelling and tasting, and generally not very good. Buyer beware."
""
"O: Meh, this is alright. Good for sitting out in the hot sun like I am right now but you know, theres not much going on here, I can hardly taste any lemon. Great for berberques and all but I'd probably be better off making my own shandy's."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Refreshing. Really easy to drink. Doesn't taste like beer, and doesn't taste like alcohol. Mostly a natural lemon drink with bubbles. Honestly I could drink an even more lemon-ey drink in higher ABV like this kind of style, but this tastes excellent and with no bitterness"

"Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy was a refreshing and bold surprise. I had it indoors, but I think it would have truly and really hit the spot if I had had it outdoors on a hot night. Although cloudy to the eye, it is an appealing shade of yellow with some lacing. Not only can you distinctly taste the lemonade-like flavor to the beer, but you could smell it - which is a plus to me. It was a little too carbonated for my taste, but overall I really enjoyed it and will look for it again."
""
""
""
""
""

"Well, you could have handed me this in a can and I would have had no clue that it was a beer and not just a lemon citrus pop...which I'm sure is going to yield some rough ratings and reviews on here. However, to me, if it's a hot day, I'd take this in a heartbeat. It's very refreshing. I won't go out of my way to buy it, but if I can get it for cheap, count me in for a pack."

"O - Easy to drink on a warm summer day. Refreshing and a nice way to beat the heat, but it isn't enticing enough for me to want it more than the fact that it is a cool beverage. Perfect for when you finish mowing the lawn!"

"Overall, Summer Shandy is decent. I would drink this as a lawn mower beer if someone gave me it. I would not ever buy it for myself mainly because that is not my go to brew. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a Shandy in the summer, but not to any serious craft beer fanatic."

"Had this on tap at Redamak's in New Buffalo Mi and it really cut through the amazing burger I had! The Summer Shandy has intense meyer lemon aromatics and taste, white flower florals, and a lightly crisp body. Extremely easy drinking with balanced juicy flavors."
"I just tried this beer for the first time love the taste; flavor was wonderful. The smell reminded me of drinking lemonade when I was a kid.It had a smooth taste and was not over powering. this is one of my new favorites now will definitely be purchasingover and over again"

"Admittedly, I'm not a big fan of shandy, but I found this particular brew to be enjoyable. The lemon flavor is very strong but it is not overwhelmingly sweet. Its a strange combination, like it doesn't know it it wants to be a beer or a mike's hard, but if this is the type of flavor you are looking for you will probably like it. My biggest complaint is the ABV. I was hoping for more than 4.2%"

"Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy (2013) - I'm a big fan of the Shandy and summertime is the perfect time of year for this typical part fruit juice (normally lemonade), part beer, and a dash of honey brew typical of turn of the century Eastern European brewery's. The beer goes down much easier than it is to pronounce. Excellent thick foam head and strong lacing. Deep Weiss wheat yellow color. Full and cloudy body. Carbonation is good but not rising. Frothy in nature. Typical lemon shandy aroma. Minute maid with a dash of hops. Crisp light mouth feel. Very light beer in nature. Honey and lemon nose. Lemonade and lager mid-palate. Good hops skunk. Well lagered but ""lightened"" by the juice over tones. Back palate its all sugar water and just a hint of malt. A little oak. Not crisp. Dare I say wet. Almost too watered down on the aftertaste. My home mixed Shandies tend to have more bit on the palate. More malt. A thickness associated normally with the syrup of soda. Less wet. More sour. Maybe I'm picking a bit heavy here, but the Saranac Summer Shandy in this case from 2011 was much better. I would still pick this over a Mike's Hard Lemonade which has that ""manufactured"" feel to it. Too much sugar. Not enough beer. 3 out of 5. Okay. Needs improvement. Saving grace is a good lemon to honey balance along with high drinkability. I would kick this back while doing yard work or maybe just sitting by the pool. BBQ will wreck it and over power it-- Be forewarned."

"Overall it's a nice drink for summer. BBQ's or at the golf course. I don't see it as a sessional drink. But it is light and refreshing. Would be good on a hot day."
"A very dull, overly sweat beer. Low ABV and very small amount of hops. Not a great beer for me, my neighbor loves it thought, so you very well may as well! It really tastes very lemony, but not subtle lemon like some beers I have had that are brewed with lemon rind, more like it was cut with lemonade or they used a very potent lemon extract."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pleasant, refreshing beer that is perfect for summer. It's not going to wow anybody, but it's a solid offering in the style."
""
""
"O- If you're presented with this at a BBQ this summer, pass. Grab a Coke or 7up instead"
""
""
""
"Well I have to start by saying I was expecting a little more on this one, I live in Houston and I drink Live Oak Hefe on the reg and I always have it served with a lemon slice, so when I see this at the store say traditional Weisse with lemon I think it's something I could enjoy. Pours a cloudy lemonade color with a couple finger head that doesn't last, almost no lacing as the glass goes down. All lemon on the scent. More lemon on the taste than I would like for the style, I expected a Weisse with a lemon hint not a mixture of beer and lemonade. Overall, it's ok, I'm not going to pour it out or anything, but its defiantly not something I'm going to seek out again."
""
"this one is probably a bit underrated here on BA. its got a pale hazy yellow glow, with a sudsy white head aver an inch tall. the nose is akin to a decent Berliner Weiss, lactic and tart, while also lemony and light. it feels less like a half lager half lemonade than it does a brewed beer with lemon, its zesty and acidic, refreshing and light, very fresh, and the lemon presence is huge here. its got a nice drinkability, and is very easy down. good bubbles, minimal body, although not soda-like as some can be. I love how real the lemons taste, not artificial at all, and I think the proportions are right. ive been recently appreciating the shandy style, and this one is sort of the original in the united states. I like it much better than many other leiny offerings, and would be happy to have this constantly on deck all summer, especially in the mornings and early afternoons. really this is pretty good."

"It's sweet, it has overpowering lemon flavor, and it kind of tastes like beer. It's a beer for people who don't like beer, and Leinenkugel's will try to make you feel good about drinking it."

However, I will give it high marks for being quite drinkable and refreshing. Otherwise nothing special."

"Never heard of this beer until I moved to Omaha. Some guests left it behind at my hotel so I decided to try it. My first drink made me smile. It was not what I expected when drinking a beer.

"I've heard a lot of take about this but everyone has a different taste. This taste like lemonade and if you're a fan of Smirnoff you would probably prefer this because it is manageable taste wise if you're not a big fan of the sweetness in the Smirnoff. I could probably drink more than a few, i.e. manage a six pack, without feeling sick. I would accept this drink but probably not buy it personally just because it's not my ""cup of tea."""

"The appearance if Leinenkugel Summer Shandy is a pale yellow color. The aroma of it is a lemon and citrus smell which i like a lot. It tastes like lemony beer as well and is very crisp and refreshing especially on a hot summer day. The overall taste and appearance is perfect for summer and really anytime. If you like lemonade you will love this. It does not have the typical beer taste to it."

""
""
""
""
""

"Light bodied, medium effervescence. Slightly oily texture. There is nothing in this beer to indicate it is a beer. It seems to be more of a lab experiment that some uneducated person or persons thought might pass as a beer. They were so wrong. Can't see the attraction to this one. Not refreshing at all. Gave the rest of the bottle, nearly 8 oz., to someone who wanted it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter (for reviewing purposes). White head, low retention. Lacing really not too exciting. Body is hazy, opalescent, pale yellow/white. Aroma includes lemons and maybe some pledge (tm). Taste is lemony and wispy but a little too artificial to be too enjoyable. This is maybe a great gateway beer for people that don't like beer."
""
""
""
""
"Lighter body, decent carbonation, sticky and sweet on the tongue. Definitely a gimmick and not my style at all, but I can see a market for it during the summertime."

"Pours an opaque melon amber color with an off-white head. The beer has a vibrant appearance, despite it's opaqueness. It has constant effervescence at the top, which gives the beer life. Lemony gewürztraminer nose. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for any ale, particularly this style. Very soft and wet, with just a hint of carbonation. The taste is light and is comprised of lemon, honey, and melon. Not overdone on the fruitiness like the vulgar Magic Hat #9. I'm enjoying this beer by the pool in Las Vegas, which is how it was meant. The low reviews this beer is getting, I regret, are from folks who are too serious and not regardig the context in which they make their reviews. Lighten up a little. Get it? Enjoy this delight in the 100 degree desert like me and you'll see what I mean."

"Not the worst beer ive had..."
"This tastes like lemonade mixed with a pale ale, which I guess is exactly what it should taste like. Hard to evaluate since the lemon is so dominant--from initial taste through the swallow and aftertaste. I would say that it is refreshing after walking 12 miles, it doesn't necessarily make this a good beer--just easy to drink. Soft drink carbonation but decently bodied."

"Had never heard of the brewer but have bought a number of their beer recently as part of pick 6 sales at the local market. Slight leamonaid flavor, crisp, and refreshing on a hot summer afternoon. Nice head and aroma. I might buy this beer on occasion in the future but would not 'search' for the beer if headed for a party and I wanted to impress friends with my selections."
""
""
""
"Only time I could see enjoying this would be on a very hot day and if I was very thirsty. Definitely not something I will likely try again"
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, clouded-yellow coloring that is pale and murky, with a thin, filmy coating of white head along the top. Aromas of roasted wheat are drowned out by a tart, sweet lemon zest bouncing out of the glass. Flavors are very lemon heavy, with a tart, effervescence that hits the sides of the tongue and the roof of the mouth like someone poured a Fresca into a wheat beer. Smooth, roasted wheat backbone that supports the lemondrop sweet main palate. The aftertaste is tangy and syrupy sweet, like you just ate a bag of lemon Jolly Ranchers. The finish is smooth and light, with a slight effervescence to it, as well. All in all, I can see how some people like this, but it is definitely not my mug of beer."

"Bottle: Poured a light bright yellow color ale with a small bubbly head with minimal retention. Aroma of light sweet malt with sweet lemonade notes. Taste is also a mix between some sweet lemonade notes with sweet malt. Body is light with average carbonation. Refreshing drink though it is almost alien to beer."

""
""
""
""
"Saw this on the menu at The Pike here in Reading, PA. I normally don't go for fruity beers but this one was interesting. First noticed the color and the abscence of any head. Probably not one of the big movers and that is why the lack of head. Leinenkugel makes many good brews, but for my taste, this is not one of them. I am a Dogfish addict."

"I tried this on-tap at a small local bar in Janesville, WI. This summer seasonal pours a hazy pale yellow color with a foamy white head. Mild scent of lemons and straw. Smooth lemony flavor with cheap straw grains. A little too watery but still a great refreshing drink for a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
"O- One of my wife's friends left this and I figured I would give it a try for the review. Actually better than I expected, but I didn't expect much. Passable as an outdoor summer beer."
""
""
"Pours yellow and diaphanous with a etched white surface. Some spotty residuals on the rim. Smells like lemon juice, and a bit of detergent - really not much else going in the nose for me. It's ceratainly lemony, but in a antibacterial sense. Taste is empty wheat water with a bit of artificial lemon flavor - like the innards of a lemon head candy (not the sour part). Very commercial to me, in a bad way. Water body with moderately hi carb and an unobtrusive finish. I can see why many folks dig this, and why my WI buddy asked me to find some for her - and why she also loves The Beast outta Milwaukee."
""
"Notes: Two notes hit you at different times and neither is all that great or complex. It does its job of being a nice summer beverage. Not overly tart or sweet. A good alternative to lemonade without being overly sweet. As a beverage, it has its place, but as a beer it is sub par."
""
""
"On tap this beer was a light golden color with a fluffy white head. It reminded me of a lemon meringue pie. The retention was only so-so though it did stick around as a collar and the lacing was scattered.The aroma was of lemons with hints of floral hops behind that. The flavors too were dominated by lemons but as it warmed up I tasted some crystal malt and a light note of bready malt. It started sweet but finished dry helping it to be a highly refreshing beer/shandy. The body was medium/light, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation a bit prickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For me it has nice carbonation. The fragrance below average, it should have a much stronger fragrance of lemon since its lemon the beer touts as one of the selling points. Needs a stronger lemon up front not just the hint on the after taste. An above average summer cook out beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: its nice for a hot day, drinks smoothly and light, wheat note is lacking, lemon can seem a bit fake like lemonade made from powder and sugar, decent"
"Keep in mind that the kind of glass you use does make a difference in head, head retention, how it releases the aroma and ultimately how much you will enjoy it."
"O - I enjoy lemonade but the flavor of this beer does not agree with me. Buy this beer if you like watery lemon cough drops."
"It should be noted that not everything this brewery puts out is crap...They actually make a decent Imperial Stout and IPA, don't know what happened to this recipe."

"These things tend to show up at July 4th parties so I thought I'd give it a go. Pours like a cloudy American wheat with a quickly disappearing head. Aroma is pure lemon while the flavor incorporates a bit more beer - pretty standard light wheat with little hop character. The lemon character is exactly like lemon drop candy. I guess it's decent for a bottled shandy. I'd rather just make my own with a better quality lemonade and beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh, not bad, but probably not the beer lover's kinda beer..has more in common with the fruity alcoholic drinks (mike's and such). Decent for a summer refresher though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I found this to be an enjoyable and easy drinking summer beer. It does taste less beer-like than many brews, but if the radler is a part-beer and part-lemonade mix, then I think this may be spot-on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Hazy pale straw body with a nice head that laces well. Never had a shandy before, nor a lemon beer and I am now fairly sure I don't want another one. Lemon on then nose. Lemon in the body. Surprisingly, I can tell this is a beer thigh with a fairly viscous body that feels like a beer. I guess this could be seen as a great summer beer by some, but I don't like it. Half way through the pour, I figured ""What the hell, let's add the lemon", and it made it even less palatable for me... Meh."
"O - different and refreshing."
"Had it at a Restaurant, enjoyed it, picked up a 6 pack. Pours a hazy, yellow. Almost looks like pear juice. Pretty nice head, maybe 2 inches, with decent retention and very little lacing. Smells predominantly of lemons, and a bit of malt and hops. Taste compliments the smell. Not bad, but definitely a summer beer. Not something I can drink all the time. Carbonation was off, and the taste was on the ""watery"" side. Someone said they should just call this ""Bud Light with Lemon", but I think it's a bit better than Bud Light, but not by much. If you're outside working or having a BBQ on a hot day, this is the right beer."
""
""
""
"Overall not really impressed, and probably won't try this type of beer again. I've tried a few different types of fruit/vegetable beers, and I've yet to find one I really like."
""
""
"Overall - Not the best summer beer by far, but worth trying. I'd say give it a go. It's a great summer beer to complement a summer BBQ or day at the pool/lake/beach."
""
""
""
"this beer is a great summertime beer. easy to drink and very refreshing.. the only thing bad I have to say about the beer is the very low alcohol content of only 4.2%. its half lemon-aide and half beer. the color reminds me of carbonated lemon-aide. You can easily drink a 6 pack of these on a hot summer day.. just wish the abv was around 6%"

"If you're drinking this you know it's a shandy as clearly stated on the label summer shandy. Smell is lemony certainly. Refreshing. Taste is lightly malty wheat beer with a refreshing dose of lightly tart lemonade. It's just about right for sweetness in terms of the lemonade flavor. I wouldn't want more than a couple, but it's one of the better flavored mass produced beers I've had."
""
""
""
"Picked up a 6 pack of this because I didn't feel like having the taste of regular beer in my mouth the next morning. Easy to drink, Smells nice, Tastes like Lemons as everybody else has said. Though with the low alcohol content it doesn't really get you drunk. A good beer to pick up if you want to have some ladies over who can't handle any other beer. Something I'd drink from time to time if I needed a filler to keep my buzz going"

"Pours a hazy nontransparent straw yellow, rolls about a 1 finger head that forms to a lace around the top of the glass, carbonation is visible at the top. The most dominate flavor on the nose(and pretty much the only flavor) is that of powdered lemonade mix, very sugary with a lemon exctract. Hints of wheat maybe? not sure if it is brewed with wheat or if my brain just wants to think so. Sugar water with a slice of lemon on the side, a grainy corn is on the after taste. Medium carbonation, tingles when entering the mouth, light bodied, very 'soft drink' like. Overall; this is pretty terrible, even the fruit like flavors taste off and generic, stay clear of this unless you really, really like lemonade mix."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light yellow with a 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that quickly fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is pretty much solely of lemon-lime soda and lemonade mixed together. Taste is the same with a grain flavor that comes out on the aftertaste. This beer has a prickly level of carbonation but it's a bit thin. Overall, this is not exactly good but it's not too bad for what it is. On the very edge of not being beer in my opinion."
""
"At 4.2% ABV, it's very easy to pound a few without even thinking about it. Very refreshing, outdoor beer but not one I would recommend if you have a crew of craft beer lovers coming over."

"Overall – Not a real flavorful beer, but not an offensive one. It would be great for sitting outside with on a hot summer day. I would consider it a good hot weather session brew, but not one I would recommend on any other occasion."

"On draft at a ball game. Cloudy light yellow with little head. Aroma is lemonade, sugar, light bread, and very mild hops. Taste is lemon, sugar, and mild beer flavors. It’s like 4.2% abv kool aid. Thin mouthfeel. Meh. Way more of a lemonade than a beer for sure."

"O: Session friendly. Kicked many of these back in college.. great beer for chilling around the house/pool/lake on a nice Michigan summer day."
"The lemony aspect of this I kind of enjoyed, but I think that the base beer that they used is just south of lackluster."

"O: a summer ""dessert"" beer. So this is what ""they call a radler (a German style of a cross between lemonade and beer)? Ok, interesting, I'm not exactly sure what to say other than I can't guarantee I'd have this again. Maybe I'd have it again alongside the Sunset Wheat and feel like I'd have a great dessert or maybe I'd give this to the malt drinker to let them see the beer side."
""
""
"This beer gets ragged on unnecessarily I think, because it's sweet and not very beer-y. Kind of a gateway beer. It's not something I would drink all the time, but I might keep some around for the less beer-inclined among us."

"It goes down too easily. It's best to skip it, if you're thirsty. It tastes more like lemonade, than a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't nearly as bad as some other shandy-style beers I've had, but at the same time it's not good by any means. This is more lemonade than beer and artificial and sugary at that. I'll pass."
""
""
"Note: This beer is not brewed with lemons as some people might suggest. It is ""beer with natural lemonade flavor."" Says so right on the label."
""
""
""
"I can definitely see the appeal of this one, it's just not my thing. I'm not sure how traditional this ""shandy"" is anyways."
""

"This is a very simple wheat beer brewed with lemon. Its a very refreshing summer beer. Had many beers like this in Germany. The main reason i am reviewing this beer is cause i feel its overall score is low do to people reviewing it and say ""it taste like lemon... why would someone brew this""... First of all it says brewed with lemon so the lemon stands out! Why would you try this beer if you have a problem with the lemon taste? I like it a lot... reminds me of Germany..."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy yellowish straw color with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a little lacing. Smells heavily of lemons, but there is general beer malt in the smell as well. Tastes of a lemonade mixed with a good adjunct lager, but not offensively. This light bodied beer is very smooth, carbonated correctly, and quite a bit could be consumed without realizing it. Overall, a slightly above average beer."

"Overall, this is one of the most refreshing beers I've ever had, and I suggest giving it a try, especially if you like citrusy beers."

"DRINKABILITY: Repeatable, easy to drink and a good price point make this an attractive beer for the summer months. The tartness is quite refreshing. The lemony smell surprised at first but it turned out okay. I like the way the flavor keeps shifting from sour (lemon and lime) to malty-sweet to acidic (orange). It's a bit unexpected and definitely adds to the beer's appeal. It would be great for a hot day."

"Pours like a wheat beer, hazy straw yellow, small head that fizzles away. Aroma is lemony and artificial. Musty lemon like cleaning product and lemon drop candy wrapped into a blanket of grain. Taste is full of lemon syrup, with a wheat malt base. Tangy, but not without a touch of bitterness, like watery lemon candy soda. Fleeting grain reminds you this is a beer. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, crisp carbonation and lingering lemon flavor. Overall, it is lemony."

"T: altough its a mixed beer, its refreshing and tastes good, at least ther is some bitter after taste that is a little bit nice"
""
""
"Appearance is pure gold with some cloudy. Smell is strong with lemon. Mouthfeel has some lingering to it, with a pleasant sweet tartness. The taste is strong with the lemon-aid. This is a great taste on a good hot 90 degree day here in PA. Overall this is a true seasonal beer, good in the summer. Let us have some burgers and dogs."
"A very ""okay"" summer beer, although I am sure I would like it better if I was drinking it on a hot summers night, instead of on a cold october night."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and refreshing; it is a good selection for a hot summer day."
"Overall Drinkability - Great novelty beer. Does well what I'm sure it set out to do (taste like lemonade)."
"Drink it when the thermometer breaks 90!"
"Overall this is a beer that I grab on a hot summer day. It goes down easy and really satisfies your thirst. My only complaint is that it is a bit too sweet. Drinkers who do not like flavored beers should avoid this."
"D/O- Points scored on the drinkability aspect, not the ""overall"" one...aspects evened out used for my score here. Made me burp a lot due to the high carbonation. If you enjoy this one, seek out the Potosi Steamboat Shandy, I found it to be much more enjoyable."
"O: Actually didn't mind this one too much. The aroma was much better than the flavor, though."
"Overall, this a suprisingly decent beer for the style attempt; if you have had shandies they are sweet and slightly malt; this nearly passes for fanta, i'd drink some after a long bike ride or day in the sun."
"D: A lame example of something in between. If I want lemonade...I'll make some. If I want a decent beer...I'll have one. This is neither."
"O - I haven't been very fond of Leinie products in the past, but this one was actually pretty decent. The base beer seems very one-dimensional, but the addition of lemon makes it a bit more interesting. I love lemonade on a hot South Texas day almost as much as I love a cold beer, and this is a good marriage of the two."
"O: With a modest 4.2% ABV and bright lemonade flavors, this is a decent heat killer. However, I honestly might have to take a Pepcid or Tums before, during and after, because right now, there's acid churning around my stomach. The hotter the better for this one."
"This beer is not terrible. It is definitely a refreshing summer beer and I wouldn't mind drinking a 6-pack. I recommend it as a compliment to a cook out or to cool down after a hot day. Would pair well with any finger food."
"O- Easily drinkable, great taste, wish it was available year round. Perfect beer for summer. I've had it tap, bottle, and can equally enjoyable each time."
"D - Overall, would make a good summer drink; not something I would more than one of, the sour and sugary lemon taste is a little too much"
"O- Probably not going to seek this one out often. It could be great after a long, hot day of yard work, but not many other times than that."
"O: I was a little surprised by this brew. A 'lemonade' beer is not something I normally would drink but found this quite refreshing. Not sure how many I could have in a sitting, but on a hot humid day doing yard work, this would be a good choice."
" The tastes is actually better than I expected with nice lemony and slight citrus peel tinges with slight malt flavor rounding out the flavor with slight astringent in the back of the throat like lemonade but the shandy maintains a balance of mild malt with tart lemon and seems to finish uncannily clean. Overall what can I say - I like this as a summer quencher and could probably enjoy this year round it is really decent if you enjoy arnold palmers or tea coolers depending on what you refer to them as. The malt is mild and the lemony flavor refreshes in a natural way. I consider this pretty decent for what it is."
"Overall- HEAVEN on a hot day. Seriously loved this beer..."
"O - This one is a near perfect hot summer day beer that you can down several of. Not the best beer for a hearty experience, but hot and outdoors? Bring it on! Just make sure it's good and cold. Kinda goes funky when it warms up."
"Depite this I cannot deny that it is a good tasting beer. I liked it and I will no doubt be drinking this again."
"O - An interesting beer but not one that I would ever order again."
"My father-in-law gave me this to see what I thought. Sampled from a bottle best by 10/10/11. Bright, hazy yellow color with a fizzy white head that leaves a decent white cap. That was the best part. Surprisingly medium bodied with assertive carbonation. Smell and taste was lemons with orange zest. The aftertaste basically left you feeling as though you were drinking lemon concentrate. This is a beer that would be enjoyed by non-drinkers or Coors Light lovers."
"The Summer Shandy to me is alot like Mike's Hard Lemonade or Smirnov Ice or spikes countrytime lemonade. The appearance is yellow with with head. The nose is very lemony....not much else. The taste is a combonation of lemmon and grains. The mouthfeel is fine....too tart for me and wouldnt drink this stuff very often."
"Is this a really light and unrefined beverage? Yes but it's damn tasty in the sun."
"From can no. Oct1711-A01190620. Sampled on July 29, 2011. The pour is lemon yellow with a bit of a lemon zing haze and a huge puffy head. This reeks of lemon zing to the point that I get little else except a whisper of fresh hops and grain. But I gave it a 3.5 on the aroma because it didn't smell artificial. The body is light and thin which would be perfect for a 90 degree day. The taste is way too overboard with the lemon and a grainy character up back."
"This is like a fruit beer and saison mixed together and is decently refreshing, but it’s not going to hit the spot for true beer enthusiasts."
"Bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Hazy golden color. Looks like a dark lemonade. Some lacing and some bubbles on the walls of the glass. Taste is all lemon and malt- carbonated lemonade- tons of citrus flavor. I can see why this is an attractive beer to some. Light bodied. Very carbonated. Not my cup of tea, but it is popular given the fact that it is easy drinking and flavorful."
"Don't."
"good lawnmower beer, or beer to throw through a lawnmower."
"This beer is a great session beer, sitting out back or by the pool on a hot day. This is by far one of the better summer shandy's out there. I really prefer this on a hot day then my go to paulander heifer. A wheat beer on a hot summer day or night is what I look forward to after a long day at work. If you like wheat beers then this is a good one. Not for everyone but for me it just fine. Going in to get my third one now."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is above average. overall, it was a decent beverage but not a very good beer. I think I'd rather just have an actual lemon-aid."
"Overall: Maybe these types of beer are for some, but not for me."
"O/D-Better than expected. I don't really like lemonade anyway so this one never had to chance to make the word 'underrated' slide across my mind. Yet, while trying to be somewhat objective, this thing does not suck nearly as bad as expected."
"O: Honestly, better than I expected it to be, but still, a bit over the top in terms of sweetness and not very beer-like either."
"O - Objectively, this isn't a very good beer. In fact it doesn't even resemble beer...Mike's Hard Lemonade is more beer-like than this. This being said, I kinda enjoy this on its own, standing by itself without attaching a label to it. Hot day, mowing the lawn, a 12pk could disappear quickly...just think of it as a refreshing lemon drink with a touch of alcohol in it...it's not bad. I like it, but this isn't beer!"
"O - I would never buy this beer, nor will I drink it even on a hot summer day. I just feel like I am taking medication rather than drinking a beer. Worth a try just to say you had it."
"O-Think Leine's could have done something better with this beer-seemingly took the cheap route by making a basic weiss beer-(Is it their base beer that they use to make honey weiss?) and adding some lemonade flavoring, too much in my opinion, and this was the result. Would be interesting to make this one with lemon juice or peel and see what could be done here. For a summer seasonal can see why this would appeal to many though-easy to drink and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Overall: I'll be honest, if I'm out mowing the lawn in the 90 degree heat, plus high humidity weather, this beer would taste pretty darn good going down. Short of that, this beer didn't have the typical flavors of a good unfiltered wheat ale, which it tries to resemble. I liked it better than their Sunset Wheat, which was too sweet and cereal tasting for my liking. Give me my Allagash White Ale or Southampton Double White Ale for my summer drinking beer..."
"Admittedly I'm a sucker for sweeter beers, but even I was skeptical at a lemonade/beer combo. However girly it may be, it is a delicious and refreshing beer that manages to eliminate all of the negatives of a malt beverage like Mike's Hard or a flavored beer like Bud Light Lime. There's no lingering sweetness, and isn't harsh on the stomach acid wise. You can taste the beer and the lemonade, but neither are bad. The flavors don't taste fake or forced. Great refreshing beer for a summer barbeque."
"In a way it is kind of refreshing. Low ABV....I sweated my ass of in the weight room tonight and this actually kind of hits the spot for me. Might grab one out of a friends cooler on a hot day or something but not thinking I'll be buying much of this."
"Its a very drinkable brew, with a nice carbonation that goes with the lemon flavors. It goes down easy, with a bit of a tingle on the tongue. I will surely reach for it again."
"Hazy yellow color with a thin head that dissipates after a minute or two. Wheat on the nose with a soapy lemon aroma. Lemon flavor is predominant and definitely does not taste like fresh squeezed lemonade, but I wasn't expecting it to. More like Country Time lemonade. Carbonation is pretty good. All in all it is not a great beer, but it is pretty refreshing. I can't see myself buying this again, but on a 105+ degree day in Phoenix if someone handed me one I would certainly enjoy it."
"O: Summer Shandy represents a stab at the Blue Moon/Shocktop market. I'm not sure how well it compares to them as I have not sampled Blue Moon in many moons and Shocktop has never touched these lips. In comparison to other summer beers, Summer Shandy pales next to pale ales Berliner Weisses. Still, it is marginally than Sunset Wheat and Berry Weiss."
"Poured a 3/4"" white head. Hazy lemonade yellow colored body. Smells like lemonade. Taste is pretty much as to be expected half weiss beer and half lemonade. Although there is some lemonade sweetness I don't personally think it was even a fraction as sweet as a typical off the shelf lemonade. Plus if it had instead been predominately beer with just a little lemonade spike it would be been more like one of those BMC's with lemon or lime twist. So all in all I thought this delivered exactly what the label indicated. And yes, it's refreshing."
"The beer pours a nice yellow to gold color. Had a good head to it. I'm not a big fan of this type of beer, too sweet for my taste. But Widmer Brothers Citra Blonde Summer brew was by far better tasting."
"Pours a nice bright yellow with a two finger white head that fizzes away at a fair pace and leaves some lacing. Smells strongly of lemon and not much else. Taste is of carbonated lemonade with some malts thrown in. This was a surprise to me as I was expecting more balance, not that it was a bad taste, it just threw me off. Mouthfeel was decent, again like carbonated lemonade. This was an interesting beer and was really refreshing for sure, but it's not something I would get again myself."
"Wow! I have to give it props for presentation. Two fingers of bone-white head above a cloudy banana-yellow colored beer!?! It looked like liquid lemon meringue pie! It smelled like it, too, that or Lemon Pledge. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was a sugary lemonade. I would have preferred it to tend more towards tart and/or dry, but the inherent sweetness was not to my liking. Finish was still too sweet for me to really get behind it. I am a member of Leinie's Lodge, but I am not putting this in my canoe (unless Pocahontas is coming along and she would like to drink it, in which case ...). Nah, this is just too close to kiddie alcopop for my taste."
"O- I recognize that there is potential for a shandy. That said, the beer aspects are absent here, and the lemonade charactersitics taste strongly artificial. Thus, this one didn't work on almost any level for me."
"I thoroughly recommend this beer for summer afternoons, post mowing, or on the beach. It is perfect as a stepping stone to convert the macro drinkers or anybody new to beer. BA pros may enjoy it if they don't take it too seriously."
"O: its not offensive..I just don't know how to classify this or even rate this.. refreshing non the less.."
"overall though, this doesn't really strike me as a beer. i dont remember what mike hard lemonade tastes like but i imagine it tastes like this."
"Overall: This tastes ok but it's not something I would seek out again. As a lemonade it tastes pretty weak and as a beer its almost nonexistent."
"O - Hey, it is what it is; a refreshing summer thirst quencher. Would I want more than one or possibly two? No, not really, but it gets the job done and anyone that likes lemonade can't say this isn't good, cause that's basically what it is."
"O: Overall it's better than the sum of its parts. Not a complex or traditional beer, but a tasty summer drink."
"It was a great thrist quencher summer brew. Very strong lemon/lime flavors prevail. Not exactly a beer drinkers beer but for a good swill beer in the heat, it tasted much better that a Corona with lime in it. My report for this beer isn't under my usual quality controlled enviroment (lazy boy chair in living room with Sam Adams pint glass pour)so this report is more for my database than to be trusted as reliable by others."
"The body was fairly typical for an American Wheat Ale, medium and clean. Drinkability was very good, I could easily see having a sixer of these while hanging out by the Nooksack River during the summer. Overall, a nice little beer. Worth your time."
"This was mediocre in my opinion. It did not taste enough like beer for me. I would rather have a cold beer with a slice of lemon, lime, or orange."
"O) This is a decent brew served ice cold on a summer day. I like it while golfing, right from the can. It gives me the beer confidence I need to sink 6 ft putts, while the 4.2% ABV doesn't turn me into more of a duffer then I already am."
"It is hell of a lot better than Bud Light Lime."
"D ~ I admit I like this. It's great for the summer. I don't buy it all the time but it's nice and unthreatening plus it it is one of the only shandys on the market"
"O - I think one needs familiarity with mixed beer drinks to appreciate a shandy properly. I'm admittedly not thinking in standard beer geek terms while enjoying this drink. That's the bottom line really...I enjoyed it for what it is. Is it a fantastic shandy? No, it's not, but for a highly commercialized version it's not half bad, seeing how most places will make these to order. If you've never had one, I don't think this should be your introduction. If you have, I think one would be ""okay"" with what is being offered here."
"O-Not impressed. I can see how a lot of folks would go for this in the summer but for me this beer seems to miss the mark"
"O - The appearance surprised me. Wasn't expecting the cloudiness. Just not a fan. I'm not a fruit beer guy to being with and this one just confirms yet again why."
"This was something that you could drink bottle after bottle and enjoy each one more and more"
"Drinkablity/ overall- overall this beer is decent and is pretty drinkable, i would call it almost some what of a novelty beer, its really a cross of being like a beer and fruit juice and being a less sweet manlier version of like a mikes lemonade, its not a bad beer certainly for a hot summer day or would do quite well out of a can at the beach but probably not something i would buy often just to chug sitting around the house, also a good beer to bring to people who don't really drink beer"
"Hazy yellow color, glows in the glass. Pithy white foam rises and crumples back to a thin cap of bubbles. The aromas are of lemon rind and cotton balls. Taste is very nice, Like malted lemonade. Light clean biscuit malt with a tangy lemony finish. Nicely dry and light-medium body, very clean and easy mouthfeel, quaffable. Good summer pounder, its a very feminine beer but damn, don't I enjoy it on a hot day."
"This one pours a whitish yellow color and settle a lightly hazed straw color that resembles lemon juice. A fast dissipating inch of white head is observed. The nose is very lemony and citrus infused. Lemon & lime peel zest create the bouquet. Although quite tasty and citrusy up front, the after taste just reminds me of a watered down lemon/lime soft drink. Nothing too bold. The mouthfeel is crisp and light bodied, this is the highlight of this brew and certainly makes up for what lacks in the taste, considering how hot it is outside. Great for a hot day like today!"
"This stuff is ok. Too much emphasis on the lemon. Would make a good summer session beer though."
"Overall, I'd buy this for a hot afternoon out grilling or on the boat. Otherwise, I'll drink something else."
"I received this bottle from a Leinenkugel rep, so why not review it? It pours a very, very cloudy gold in color with a soapy looking bright white head. It kind of looks like a quality Berliner weiss. The aromas consist of Country Time lemonade mix with a light pale malt finish. It smells artificial but it is appealing on the nose. The flavors too are of premixed lemonade with a light and dry malt finish. There isn't any complexity but it is what it is. It's insanely light and easy to drink. This is a great summertime option if you're wanting something non-BMC and with some flavor. Like most of their ""flavored"" beers the flavors presented seem artificial so that stops me from giving them too much credit for this tasty brew. It's a fine shandy."
"O- This beer is not anything I look for when I go to the store or walk into a bar. It has a long underlying sweetness to it that I find a little too much for me. Not really sure I would drink this one again myself but if it were to be offered to me I don't think I could have more than one. More of a ""girlie"" type beer but seems to be loved by the masses stateside."
"Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy is a cloudy, bright yellow brew with a thin, white head that fades to a blotch. It has an aroma of lemonade and beer breath. Lemon zest is detected. It's very light bodied, lively and gritty. It leaves the mouth feeling like it's covered in sand. It has a stale, generic beer flavor with a dose of lemon zest. There's a little sweetness, bitterness and sourness. This isn't pleasant. I drank one of these after mowing the lawn and it did not quench my thirst. This displeases me."
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has a fizzy white head on top of a lemon yellow body. The smell is of fresh lemons. It taste nice of lemons, no hops to speak of. The mouth feel is nice and crisp. The beer overall i think is good for a nice summer beer."
"Taste - Tastes like someone dumped a can of Country Time lemonade into a pint of Stella. A little bit of malt and a lot of very sweet lemon flavour."
"Summer Shandy pours out as a cloudy bright yellow color with a fluffy white head on it. The head settles and leave a little lacing around the glass in some areas. The aroma has a ton of lemon which is no surprise, there really isn't much getting past that. The taste of the beer is again a lot of lemon with just a little bit of grainy malts in the distant aftertaste. The mix of Lemonade and beer for me don't really mix too well. I'm just not a big fan on Lemons or Lemonade for that matter. I can see someone who enjoys those beverages may enjoy this a lot. I found the mouthfeel to be light and a decent choice for some people in the summer."
"There's really very little difference from bottle to can. What I do get is a weaker head that struggles and leaves almost nothing behind. In that respect, the main difference is the appearance. It's a shandy, so it is what it is, it's simply not a well-made one given that the lemon aspect overtakes all but the slightest inkling that this is a beer. It's a lemon soda with slight beer character. Shandy's not a beer purist's dream come true, but pick up a Stiegl (sp?) if you're going to get one. Otherwise, just drink this as something like Chrystal light mixed with Sprite. As such, perhaps it is pretty tasty."
"O: not a good beer, throw a slice of lemon in it and I could easily confuse it with crystal light with some sprite mixed in."
"A beer for people who think they won't like any beer. The trouble is, drinking this will really turn you off of beer."
"OK, give this beer a break people. It is what it says it is. It is a summer shandy. Its a summertime beer. It is light, crisp, refreshing and slightly sweet. The smell is of lemon candy, or country time lemonade. It taste like a wheat beer with country time lemonade mixed in. Fizzy, citrus, some sour tart lemon swells with the malt background. Its a cloudy beer but it has some creamy head and lace. This would hit the spot after mowing the grass in the hot summer sun. Serve this one cold. It says it is Weiss beer with lemonade and that is exactly what it taste like. They get an A+ for nailing what they set out to do. This should be graded by its style which is a style of its own. And it is what it says it is. There are good qualities to this beer, it just isn't what most beer drinkers are used to when they think beer. Nothing complex or outstanding, but very easy to drink."
"Taste, is uh, weird. Lemon, but not the way I'm used to, usually its like lemon sour, or lemon citrus hop feel, but no, this is like, lemon candy almost. The beer isn't bitter, yet has lemon as its most defining characteristic. Just doesn't come across like beer, or a fruit beer even, like a hotty totty/boilermaker type of drink, something with lemon and beer in it, but not a 'lemon beer' per se. Anyways, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who likes beer."
"D- Damn near perfect. I could drink this on a hot day all day, with it's ultra light body and low alcohol. Great fishing beer. Could also be the one beer that the girl who"" hates beer"" will willingly drink. Light and breezy and cold and mindless."
"Overall its a very drinkable beer would be good on a hot day but other than that not really my cup of tea."
"For what it's worth, this isn't the worst beer in the world. Is it great? Heavens no. But if it's sunny, you're outside for a couple of hours and have to quench that thirst, you could do a lot worse."
"O. Overall a pretty good light bodied easy drinking relaxing summertime beer."
"It isn't bad...pretty refreshing, though I was hoping for a bit more of a tart drink (I'm glad it wasn't really sweet, though). I'm not sure how often I'd drink this if I had a lot of good craft available, because there are other summer seasonals which I generally enjoy more than this."
"I do not give a Schlitz for Summer Shandy. I do not give a Snapple for Summer Shandy. And just to be clear; I do not give a lemon scented Pine Sol for Summer Shandy."
"M/O- this is a medium bodied brew, that is overall sweet. Has wonderful carbonation that cleans everything away. Highly drinkable. This is a tasty and enjoyable summer drinker."
"Overall I thought this was a nice warm weather beer and my personal favorite for taking with me to play some disc golf, I often go with oberon, but this beer is lighter and more refreshing then oberon and I like that better for playing disc golf. This beer is exactly what it's name implies, a Shandy, and thats how I grade this beer, not as a typical fruit beer. This is the only commercially available Shandy I have seen, most of the time Shandy's are DYI recipes, so I like the fact that it is already mixed and the fact it comes in cans helps also. I tend to keep this in my fridge all summer for those afternoon disc golf games, they are nice and refreshing and don't get you too buzzed, it just has great drinkability. If you are looking for a lighter refreshing beer for those active summer days then this beer will work well."
"Overall: I didn't realize this was only 4.2 percent until I got it home. I never buy below 5% just 'cause I want a real beer and not ""lite"" beer. I liked the other 3 beers I had by this company last summer. One was blueberry I believe and another wheat? Can't remember exactly. Summer Shandy is something you could drink all day if it was sold cheaply enough or was free. I'm not gonna but it again because at $7 it's a bit expensive for the ABV. and falling into the ""joke"" beer category such as being a lemonade."
"D: I can only imagine enjoying this on a hot day leading up to something else. The glassware is the best part."
"Figured since it was a featured brew and one I haven't had at Quizzo yet, I'd take it down tonight. It pours a hazy white grapefruit topped by a half-finger of short-lived white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, wheat, and what could theoretically be construed as coriander. All of these elements come through very meekly. The taste holds notes of lemonade, grapefruit juice, lemon peel, and slightly funky wheat. It all comes across as something akin to a crappy bottle of Squirt or something. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a grainy-ish feel. Overall, I can easily say that I would not go for this one particularly in the future."
"The mouthfeel is great, it's just perfectly carbonated and has the right thickness to be refreshing. The drinkabilitiy, of course, is phenomenal. May as well be drinking lemonades. I know a lot of elitists will hate on this, but I enjoy this brew. It's just a refreshing beer that is great in the Florida sun."
"Thin feel, some carbonation separates it from unsweetened lemonade. Glad it was free"
"O - I could see how this could appeal to some. It would be good for drinkers looking to move from standard macros. I wouldn't be opposed to having one or two on a hot summer day."
"Excellent summer Beer. Hint of Lemonade and Orange flavor with hoppy aftertones. Not a beer for the winter. But the hot 90° summer days, there is not much better!It is very easy to drink. The color is a nice cloudy yellow with a 1"" white foam head. Out of the Leinies summer brews this is right behind the Sunset Wheat for me."

"Lemonade beer? Good idea I guess. I would rather drink an Arnold Palmer with a shot of Grey Goose. Beer is pale light yellow. Of course smells like lemon and dirty dish water tones. Kind of looks like dirty dish water. They had this on a keg last year at a golf outing. I could only drink one. Too sweet, zesty and fizzy for a hot day. Upsets the stomach a little. Taste, sounds, drinks and feels like a soda pop. Sorry Leines this is your worst beer."
"During summer, this would be a drink of choice when I'm looking for something fruity. During the winter, I mostly take it out of my reserves to rebel against winter. As for being a beer, it... doesn't taste like beer. Still, great as it's own drink."
"D- Love this ""beer"". i know it may not be considered a beer by some but dang this is soo good and easy to drink on a hot summer day!"
"I drank it out of the bottle and the smell was fine, bit of fruitiness smell and tiny bit of grain. Taste is good and the mouthfeel fantastic during the summer months. Drinkability is fair, wouldn't be my choice to pound these one night, would rather go for some rolling rock."
"Definitely not a bad beer at all, but as I grow older I find myself more drawn to the hoppy citrus flavors than the straight lemonade approach."
"A+. Hands down. I don't understand why this beer is getting such bad reviews from other users. Here is the way I look at the Shandy: it is not a ""beer"" per say, but a delicious flavored beverage that goes hand-in-hand with hot summer days, laying on the beach, going out on the boat, or sitting around a bonfire on the back deck on a late July night. Now if I am looking for an actual ""beer", than I am not going for the Shandy. That is the point - the Shandy is a beer made perfect for specific conditions. It is extremely easy to drink, so it's a good session beer. The color is perfect for summer - a nice cloudy yellow with a white foam head. It has a sweetness to it, so I can totally see how that may turn off some of the other reviewers. Great for BBQ's and lazy summer days."
"D- Save your money; this is only in a pinch at picnic during super hot summer day."
"Very light and fruity, not like Leines Berry Weiss but I still won't drink more than 12 pack at one time."
"Verdict: You have to take Summer Shandy for what it is, an easy drinking beer cocktail designed for people who don't really like beer. Taking that into account, along with my fondness for Shandies as a lad, I have to say I kinda like it."
"D- on a hot day at a picnic sure why not... but for a beer person just don't waste money on it. Worth trying, but not worth buying."
"Drinkability: It's good, but I think I could only drink it on a hot summer day. It works really well with a burger."
"I'll be the first to admit that I think that Leinenkugel's is a very overrated brewer. This beer won't change my mind. Very ""lemon-y"" and sweet which I personally don't care for in a beer. I expected a much more tart flavor but it is rather sweet which keeps one from being able to drink to many at a time."
"This pours yellow with little head. Smells like lemon and tastes like lemonade mixed with a light lager. Light-bodied, but decently carbonated. This may be a session beer for some, but I could not drink more than two because it's too sweet and the taste just isn't for me."
"D- Well it's better than coors light. I drank this after an Alpha King on tap so the flavors were very subdued to me. I really have no desire to ever drink another one of these.... unless stale yellow beer is the only other alternative."
"Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, Inc.--Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy Weiss Beer With Lemonade--Beer With Natural Lemonade Flavor--2009 12 oz. Bottle. 4.20% ABV. 10 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Sediment hint. Thin foamy mild lace white head. Cloudy bright lemon white color. Rich lemon wheat ester front. Tangy fizzy sweet citrus lemon wheat grass thin soda pop easy to guzzle body. Refreshing crisp dry lemon citrus end. Over the top lemon. 10 Mile 90 F Tasty. Sampled 8/16/2010. 6-Pack overpriced @ $8.99."
"What a wonderful beer for summer. The appearance is wonder. The smell is exceptional. Taste is so wonderful. Very Lemonony and beer taste rolled into one. Mouthful is the same. Drinkability is so exceptional. I could drink this beer all day long. I crave this beer"
"I'm scoring this low except for drinkability because I hardly consider this a beer."
"I dont dislike fruity beers in general, but this is pretty bad for me. More lemonade than beer."
"The summer shandy it's a bit cloudy and has very little head to it The smell of it isn't too bad but it does have a good lemonade taste to it but a bit of a after taste it is a great beer to drink on a hot day out in the sun overall it's a good beer"
"This summer brew is lemony more than anything, with a taste that reminds me of lemon zest along with the faint taste of wheat malt in the background. Summer Shandy leans toward the sweet side end of the spectrum, but not by much. There are some sour notes and the slight taste of honey blended with the citrus. There is little or no discernable hop character to this product."
"Usually I've had this in a bottle, but the tavern my friends play volleyball for had it on tap. I was surprised to see a nice full head on the goblet. The lemon zestiness of this beer certainly makes this a mood beer for me. But the refreshing taste makes it very drinkable. It had a slight tan tint to the golden hue. Nothing too complex, a lighter flavored beer with a thorough lemon infusion."
"Very drinkable beer, not a strong beer aftertaste, almost watery, which most people like anyways, nice limon flavor, not so much limeonade but more straight limon,very cloudy unfiltered beer but most craft brews are, tried it at a cool temperature to extract more flavors, probly taste great on a hot day when these are ice cold."
"It's an attractive pale yellow with good haze and a white head. The flavor is a lot like lemon extract that you use for baking, which isn't to my tastes. I find a Radler a lot more charming, but this beats one I had once with actual, pulpy lemonade."
"The beer pours a hazy light yellow color with a white head The aroma is straight lemonade. The flavor is more of the same. Nothing but lemons and the slightest bit of grain or wheat. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Outstanding hot weather beer!"
"Cloudy light gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is citrusy lemon.Taste is lemon,wheat,and a touch of honey.A great beer for summer outings.Refreshing and pretty smooth.I would recommend and purchase again in the warm weather months!!!"
"The feel of this beer is light and goes down really well so long as the strong lemon flavor does not overpower you and turn you off. I liked this beer a bit but I realize that it was helped a bit from the beach being only feet away as I review this. That being said, a really good summer beer but really only a summer beer."
"This beer when first tasting it was nice. Good summer beer. After drinking more than 1 or 2 though it becomes old. Also its got a low ABV which is kind of a disappointment. Overall I believe its a good beer to try but not something I could buy weekly."
"D - It tastes so repulsive I couldn't get more than about a quarter of the way through it, and I really tried."
"Taste is pretty much lemonade. The finish is too dry for me; rather astringent. Lemon rind becomes apparent in the finish. This does not taste much like beer but more like carbonated lemonade."
"Bought this as part of a six pack mixer from Liberty Street Tavern. Great beer for a hot and humid summer day. It had a nice cloudy yellow pour. Had a nice head of foam with a nice lemon scent. The first taste had pleasantly sweetness to it but finished with a nice slightly bitter lemon. One of the better fruit beers I have had."
"Pours a thick, weaky, frothy head, not really thick and impressive. The beer is a hazy, cloudy yellow. The smell is nothing to be impressed by, but not offensive either. The beer is a bit syrup like, or cheap, not super hight quality in terms of being a lemonade beer. This is an easily drinkable, but not outstanding brew. I've had it before, I'll have it again, and I enjoy it, but it isn't anything to be wowed by."
"D: Interesting enough to try once, but the beer got boring fast, not something to come back to."
"D: This is one of those beers where drinkablity is in regards to the total ability to drink it often and quickly, not the desire to come back to it for reasons of style, flavor, and complexity."
"Drinkability - probably not the greatest beer, but in terms of repeat drinkability, with the lower abv and not-very-beer-like taste, you could come back to this type of beer a few times."
"Overall: It's not the greatest beer in the planet. But really? Is that the point with Summer Shandy? No. It's meant to be a refreshing SUMMER SHANDY. On those grounds I give this beer a positive review."
"This brew makes for a good summertime gathering drink. Think of wine cooler meets a very mildly hopped beer and this is what you have. Not bad at all from a drinkability perspective, goes down easy enough, but it really depends on the crowd and what you're in the mood for."
"The mouthfeel is light bodied, with average carbonation, nothing really out of the ordinary. This isn't difficult to drink, but I won't have it unless there are no other options. Goes down decently on a hot day after a few other drinks, but really not impressed."
"Drinkability: Wretched. Either give me a lemonade or give me a beer. Just not this."
"D- believe it or not, i liked this one more on tap. it seemed a lot more flavorful that way. this was my last time drinking this one."
"D: hard to finish one, unless i had a real hankering for lemonade. as far as lemonade goes, it's not terrible. as far as beer goes..."
"D: Very similar to drinking lemonade... you can go until the citrus flavor as coated your tongue beyond comfort."
"Tried this at Lamp Lighters in Palatine. Beer of the month apparently at this place. The color is a straw very light color. Smells of lemon and wheat. This tasted like lemonade on crack. Could only handle two before I switched back to some better beers. It would be good on a nice summer day when you want something light and refreshing."
"D - Again this is a different beer it is like a malt but it isnt. Thats okay it does what it is looking to do. My wife loves it. I feel it is agreat gateway into craft."
"The pale, cloudy appearance isn't too impressive up front for this summery lemonade-infused wheat beer. The initial citrus smell isn't bad, though, but what really counts is the taste, and here it just reminds me far too much of Pledge furniture polish. Something here seems fishy (and plastic), and I won't be picking these up anytime soon."
"Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy poured a light color, with a decent head. It smells very strongly of lemonade, and had a sweet smell. The taste had a very strong lemonade flavor, and was rather sweet. Very very easy to drink, anybody would enjoy this beer. Overall its very different, and not bad, worth a shot, great on a hot summer day."
"Tastes like a pale wheat ale mixed with lemonade. This is not working for me. Just my opinion. Light bodied, decent carbonation, a bit of a dry finish. I will not seek this out again."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a light straw color with a frizzly white head that pops. The aroma is of light malts and of course lemonade. Now I love a tall cold glass of lemonade as much as the other guy, but in my brew? My BA bud drizzam swears by this stuff. The taste is what you would think a light malt brew with lemonade and that is where it ends. The after taste is stale leaving a dry and almost stank taste in my mouth. I think it best to leave these two things separate, or at least to the women to drink in ""hard"" malt liquors."
"Hazed lemong glow golden with a bright white creamy head forming thick witha fizzy head, lacing is nice fine and scattered on the sides of my chalice. Aroma heavy with the lemonzest almost like a cleaning supply lemon, it's very zesty. Flavors clear out the nostrils with lemon zest and really hit heavy with the tartness definitely some biscuit/wheat malt characteristics but the lemon zest rolls a bit too hard I couldn't drink many of these even though I really like the can they're packaged in. Very carbonated light bodied mouthfeel that is a bit too much. Drinkability is weak, tasty brew a bit heavy on the lemon zest doesn't work out as a standby regular for me."
"Pours a hazy pale straw color with minimal head. Scent is of lemons and pale malt - smells like lemonade mixed with a light BMC product. Taste is again a simple belnd of lemon and pale grains - the lemon is not too artificial nor too sour, there is no horrible big rush of sweetness, there is not even a twangy light beer taste. The backbone is a halfway decent fresh grain-like taste. Plain and simple - its a light lemonade mixed with a slightly above average beer. Light to medium bodied, a bit grainy in the mouth. Let me get this off my chest - i enjoyed it for what it was. That doesnt make it a great beer, but it was a nice drink."
"A fairly light beer but pleasant. The beer smells like lemon zest. Taste is of a light wheat beer with a strong lemon finish. It has a light crisp feel to the tongue. It would be quite refreshing making it a perfect beer to drink after a long hot day."
"Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith Euro pint. Pours a hazy pale yellow color with one finger white head that slowly subsides. There is no apparent lacing throughout. The aroma is of a malt beverage with a massive lemonade note. The flavor of this brew is almost not flavor with a subtle lemonade hint. It is light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this beer is not that enjoyable. Might be okay for getting someone off Mike's Hard Lemonade, but for an avid beer drinker, this is kind of blah..."
"Final Notes: Good for refreshment on a hot summer day. Not good for much else, though. I wasn't a fan."
"next..."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sour lemons. Tastes like it smells, sour lemons with a touch of bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is not a beer I could spend the night drinking. Overall a decent but unspectacular brew."
"Overall, and I'm beating a dead horse at this point, this stuff is more like lemonade with a splash of beer than the other way around. If you keep that in mind it you may have a decent experience. If you are in the mood for something refreshing (outside the realm of beer) you may have a decent experience."
"d-good drinkability"
"I recently found the Summer Shandy in a can and had to try it. It smells of lemon, and it definitely tastes like lemon. This beer goes down very smoothly. It would be easy to drink a lot of these. I'm surprised the rating is so low on here. This is a very decent summer beer. I recommend trying this beer if you haven't."
"Tried this at a baseball game last night. I often will at least try seasonal offerings because well...they aren't always available. I had reasonably high hopes because I like regular Linenkugel. I was very disappointed. Way too much lemon flavor. Tastes more like lemonade than beer. Would not order again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"It should be added that after my first one, I decided to mix this with the Berry Weiss (50/50) for something a little more tolerable."
"It's easy drinking, and at only 4.2% ABV, very sessionable. But why bother?"
"They advertise this as 'beer with a hint of lemonade' but it's honestly the other way around. It isn't terrible, but it barely feels like beer. May as well reach for a Mike's hard, you won't look that much worse for doing so."
"Thoughts- This one was a try at a shandy that was not all that close. I think I will stick to mixing my own."
"I'm not a huge fan. Pours a medium yellow color with a bit of head. There is a strong lemon and citrus fruit aroma. Lemonade in the first sip, carbonated lemonade. Definitely an American style Wheat. Rather smooth, a little sour, but overall fairly well balanced."
"D: Like another beer I had recently, this beer is completely channeling a German Rosser. It's light, sweet, lemony and goes down easily. Not exactly my cup of tea, but nice as a summer thirst quencher."
"This was a suggestion from my son. He say's it's his favorite beer. My impression was that it has a citrus taste to it. But after he said he thinks it tastes like ""Fruity Pebbles"" I have to admit he had it nailed, it does taste like Fruity Pebbles. It definitely has a unique taste to it."
"Had a trip to Wisconsin and wanted a light beer to bring out to the lake. I figured a shandy would do the trick. The beer looked decent with light blond color. The smell was awful. It is like sniffing Pledge cleaner (dominating artificial lemon smell). The taste however was decent for what it was. I wanted light and interesting and that is what this beer delivered. Real light taste with strong citrus you get from shandys. The mouthfeel and drinkability on this beer are above average. Don't buy this beer if you are looking for a great beer tasting experience. This beer is good for those blistering hot summer days when you want something light and easy."
"This was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. It's still not very good. Pale cloudy big white head. Not bad. Smells like lemons and nothing else. Doesn't really taste like anything but lemons. I'm not a big fan of wheat beers to begin with, and I'm definately not a fan of mixing beer with artificial flavors. That being said, it was somewhat refreshing. It is what it is. This tastes like a cheap wheat beer mixed with lemonade. That's because it is a cheap wheat beer mixed with lemonade. If that sounds good to you knock yourself out."
"This is much more convenient that a beer with lemonade added, and if I must say, this isnt bad. It doesnt taste like beer, but it isnt supposed to. A real easy drinker and not a bad ""beer"" at all."
"poured into a pint glass with a nice head that stayed around for a bit.hazy yellow,really smells like they just poured lemonade into a wheat beer,which is what they did i believe.tastes like a beer with lemonade poured into it.overall,i could drink a few of these on a hot summer day.however,this is a bit too sweet for my palate.a good beer to give to BMC fans."
"D - Moderately drinkable, especially in the summer. The lemony flavor is very nice but gets a little sour after awhile. Good for a summer seasonal beer."
"When evaluating this beer, you must remember the style, and evaluate it accordingly. It's a ""Shandy"" - a mixture of ""lager and lime"" - very common and popular in the UK. Having spent some time in the UK, I feel qualified to say it isn't bad - FOR A SHANDY. Although I've been in bars in the US where someone has ordered ""half (whatever is on tap) and half Sprite", I think this is an improvement."
"Overall- I would have to say it still beats a bud light:) this beer fits the ""woman beer"" category with the low alcohol factor and the watery taste. I guess it would be a decent starter beer to get the ol' gf or wife slowly into the field of better beers."
"Drinkability: While I'm not opposed to the idea of beer blended with lemonade, this just has a repellent artificial quality to it. Less Summer Shandy and more of a Summer Shitty. Wait, am I allowed to say that?"
"Let's face it, this is not a hard-core ""big character"" beer, but at 4.2ABV on a super hot day you can't go wrong with the ""refreshment"" aspect and ""sessionability"" of this beer. Pairs well with extreme humidity and thirst."
"Grabbed this in an attempt to find a good beer to drink on a hot summer day. It is a cloudy yellow color, looks like the typical hefeweizen. The off white head quickly dispersed. The lemon smell over powers any typical beer smell and the taste is almost like drinking lemonade. It's crisp lemony taste is easy to drink, and if you like lemons you'll like the beer. Overall it taste like the typical hefewizen with four or five lemon slices squeezed into it. Decent offering for a hot summer day."
"Leinie seems to be going for the teen-age girl drinkers or women who don't really like beer."
"Well carbonated and light bodied, which was good, because it helped get this beer down. Overall, I drank the pint, but it sucked. Lemon soda with a beer in there somewhere. Avoid this."
"Pair with spicy food or a lawnmower and you'll be fine."
"Pours a very cloudy yellow color... pretty good to hear, decent lacing on the glass as the beer goes down. Smell is of a fresh made glass of lemonade... nice smell, but reminds me way too much a German Radler (had Radler Brau by Clipper City.. one of the worst 'beers' I've ever had). Taste... is very much Radler like, disappointingly. Very dry in the mouth and in the finish, lemonade taste is just way too present here. Leaves your mouth more thirsty after you finish this beer than before you started.. never a good thing for a beer. On the plus side, it is leaps and bounds ahead of the Paper City beer of a similar style, but definitely nothing I'd ever seek out again and would probably turn down one if offered. Stick with the Sunset Wheat."
"Overall - not bad, I drank all 3 from the sampler while the other two berry weiss lie in wait for some sucker to try."
"Notes: would really consided this a ""true beer"" per say. would be a good choice to enjoy with a co-ed group of friends out in the sun."
"Overall it is not an offensive drink. It is still refreshing and tasty but it doesn't give me the feeling of beer. I am pretty impressed with this company for doing something a little differerent. I am never a fan of flavored beer myself but out of all the ones I have tried this is probably the best one."
"D - Rather refreshing on a hot summer day; I could easily knock back a few of these."
"Good beach beer; should come in cans."
"Drinkability- It's ok not that drinkable because I don't care for the taste, give me gumballhead anyday over this."
"Dr. Let's just say I'm sorry I bought a six-pack instead of a single. If you like the flavor, it would go down very easily."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a little head and good lacing to follow. The overall smell is of lemons with some wheat beer characteristics. The overall taste is lemonade. The lemonade however isn't over powering like the berry weis is. The mouthfeel is dry and not overly carbonated. The overall drinkability is very high, you could have about 12 of these without knowing. Very refreshing."
"D- I find this beer to taste more like a ""bitch drink""(excuse the language) however it is easy to drink and on a weekend like the 4th of July I might end up with several in my belly. I wouldn't rush out to the store to buy more though."
"d- wasn't a real fan, i got a little too much fake lemonade flavoring out of it, probably wouldn't have another."
"Drinkability is pretty good. it's slightly more lemony than I prefer, but it's not to bad..on a nice hot summer day it's perfect."
"Note: This is a really good beverage but it is a little hard to consider it wheat beer because there is very little wheat beer flavors (fruity but lacks the variety of fruit flavors). But I have never actually made a Shandy before but I feel this would be a good representation of it (very refreshing)"
"Drinkability - this would make for a last minute, end of a hot summer day session beer. Nothing really great about it other than the lemon flavor, if that is what you find to be really refreshing. There's better summer beers out there."
"Pours bright hazy yellow with a foamy white head. Leaves a lot of lacing. Smells like lemonade. I don't have the greatest sense of smell but I'll be damned if anyone else can smell anything but lemonade in this. I like lemonade but I don't want my beer to necessarily smell like that and only that. The lemon flavors are real and pleasant. This kind of beer could easily go the way of Bud Light Lime, where it tastes like candy and not like fruit, but it doesn't. I still have a hard time picking out the beer flavors from it. Near as I can tell the wheat beer this is based on only contributes a foamy head and a bubbly mouthfeel. Clearly, this would be easy to drink on a hot day. But if I wanted beer, I would reach for something else."
"Drinkability: The mouthfeel is fine, and as a summer beer, this would be decent if it weren't for the dumping of lemonade into the beer."
"D: There's nothing special to distinguish this: I could mix stale bud light and lemonade at home and it would save me the trip to the store to get this. Overall, very unimpressive (from the company that makes Sunset Wheat); the non-alcoholic Shandy I had in the UK even tastes much more flavorful than this."
"Overall, this is a supremely inoffensive beer, and probably best serves as a gateway from a BMC-only world. If you want to drink a shandy/radler, make your own, but this isn't a bad alternative when that isn't an option."
"I poured into a pint glass to a small white head after I finished mowing the lawn. It was a cloudy yellow color. It smelled lemony. It tasted like Blue Moon infused with lemonade. I guess if you're going to garnish wheats with friut you may as well do it during the brewing process. I thought it was very good and I apologize for the Blue Moon reference (not a fan). The Summer Shandy hit the spot on a warm day after some yard work. It is a very nice summer session ber."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It poured a hazy lemon with a fizzy white head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was all lemons, and that was a good thing. The rest of the beer is very disapointing. The lemonade slightly overpowered the beer bringing out the worst characteristics of two beverages I enjoy. It was way too sweet and there was no ""beer"" flavor in this one, almost like a malternative. The beer is light bodied and way overcarbonated. IMO it is almost sickenly sweet and I had trouble drinking it. Avoid!"
"good drinkability, but almost kind of off the mark of a beer. i hate to compare to bud light lime, cuz its not quite on that level, however its not quite enough to give it praise. caught in between."
"Nikki"
"very drinkable in the way that juice is drinkable. not drinkable like how beer is drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is veerrrry light, almost nonexistent. But, overall goes down easy, highly drinkable on a hot summer day"
"D: Great summer beer. I thought Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat took top honors out of this brewery but Summer Shandy is a close second when it comes to having a refreshing lighter beer."
"Drinkability. Again, in the right place, at the right time, I believe you could drink one after another. At 4.2% and with the slickness with which it goes, it is very drinkable. Not for everyone and probably not for purists but as a fun recreational drink I think Leine's got what they were going for. Would defintely have again."
"It's a pretty opaque gold color with almost a finger of white, foamy head. The aroma has some lemon zest, not overpowering like some bad fruit beers I've tried, it's suttle and pleasant. Taste wise it's rather pleasant, like a bit of lemonade was added. Body wise it's about average for a wheat beer. I'd have this one again."
"This review will be on the product's merits as a beer but as a beverage in general. As a beer, this fails. It is extremely light with few taste characteristics of beer. However, it is not at all bad. It more resembles a mellow, less sweet lemonade. It is quite refreshing and fruity with some nice sweetness at first and then a more bitter/hoppy finish that balances nice. Quite refreshing and not at all bad for a hot summer day which is exactly how I am enjoying it. Worth trying for this purpose, not worth trying if looking for a great beer though."
"D- Personally, I think it's good for what it is, lemonade beer."
"M + D: Sharp carbonation, giving it some nice character. Prickly, but it's rather 'fine' so it comes across as being a bit smoother. Light on the alcohol makes for easy drinking, but I couldn't really see it as being any sort of session offering - it's just a bit too sweet in that sense, and is like quaffing back a lot of lemonade."
"Drinkability:My own personal rank for this beer is higher--probably a B, but I do not think it meets the style guidelines well. I think this is great for a shandy, but not as a wheat ale. I would have several of these as a summer refresher, but maybe not the first thing I look for if I want a beer. The lemon is very strong."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is of powdered County Time Lemonade before it is mixed with water. There is absolutely no beeriness to the aroma. The taste isn't quite so processed lemonade like, but there still is nothing beer about it. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this ""beer' simply isn't for me. The only flavored beer I've tried that I think is fair to compare it to is Bud Light Lime, and if forced to drink one I would choose the Bud Light Lime."
"D: Fairly drinkable on very warm days out in the sun. Quite sweet and probably hard to have more than one or two of, but not a bad offering."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with thick fluffy head. Smells like lemons with a little bit of wheat beer mixed in. Tastes pretty much like it smells, lemonade all the way through until the end where you can detect a wheat beer and citrus bitterness. A lemon overload. Mouthfeel is ok. I do like lemons, so it is definitely drinkable, but on a summer day I would prefer a hefe or something slightly less acidic and citrus tasting."
"Drinkability is probably subpar for a summer (sessionable) beer. It's light in terms of stomach substance but heavy on tongue, cheek, and overall mouth sensations. Though interesting and worthy of another sip, I'd pass on two consecutive just about every time."
"D - Not sure I could say this is very drinkable. I suppose I could see having one of these on a hot afternoon, but definitely not something I would ever order at a bar."
"Overall, I think this beer has potential to be a great summer session or cookout beer, but you'll have to find the right foods to bring out the taste or make sure you aren't eating anything at all. Otherwise, it starts to feel like drinking beer with water in it instead of lemonade."
"Remember the prefacing statement (if not, see above). When all else fails, a cop-out. . . 3's all around!"
"This thing is really drinkable. It definitely shines in this part of the rating. Light, not bad tasting, and pretty refreshing. I could down these pretty quickly. A decent summer brew for a hot day."
"This seasonal is a good treat for a hot afternoon after of mowing the lawn. This beer is a bit like Gatorade: the more hot and thirsty you are the better it tastes. This beer is a seasonal because one is not usually overheating in the winter."
"The smell of lemon does not overwhelm the maltiness of the beer. It pours a bright sunshine yellow which foreshadows the presence of lemon. The tase is a pleasant balance of lemon and malt that surprised me. I was sure this would be some cheap ""hard lemonade"" concoction, but it wasn't. It was balanced and fun to drink."
"Pours a cloudy, bright yellow with a very lager like white head. Aroma is heavy on the lemonade and a bit grassy. Very light mouthfeel. Well-balanced, but thin and fairly bland. Wheat is present in the aftertaste. The finish is acidic. A little too much lemonade and not enough beer to back it up."
"On a side-note, I wonder if the beer the lemonade is blended with is Leinenkugel's Original or something different?"
"D: A pretty good mouthfeel for the style, but the taste could use a little work. The sweet lemons got to me later on and the matliness of the beer was way overpowered by the lemon taste."
"Mouthfeel. Carbonated. Reminds me of a wine cooler or sparkling wine. This reminds of the a malt based wine cooler rather than a beer. In PA malt coolers are solid at beer distributors while wine based coolers are sold at the state stores. At least that was the case back in the mid 80s when these types of drinsks were popular. I try never to refuse a beer, but i dont think this was a beer. I gave it to my wife and she enjoyed it."
"Perfect for a picnic or an outdoor ball game. It's a shame Leinies doesn't make this year round, I could use some to fend off these cold Minnesotan winters."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- i've made my own radlers by mixing home made lemonade with a good german beer, but this is undrinkable for me."
"Taste: Toasted malt hints of lemon but it is kinda balanced. There was a slight bit of tartness in finish but overall a nice clean and easy beer to drink. I think Samuel Adams has a little bit better summer beer."
"D- Not a great taste so I wouldn't drink many of these. The citrus is too overpowering to have a lot of these in a sitting."
"Not sure who this beer would appeal to, as even the women at our table thought it tasted too cheesy. Before I drink this again, I'll have a straight lemonade or real beer, not this 'tweener."
"This sounded good on paper. Lemonade, meet a wheat beer. Well, if they had used a decent lemonade and a mediocre wheat beer then maybe they would have had something. All this is, is a sickly, sweet mess on top of a less than mediocre wheat beer. Yuck."
"This is a (very) surprisingly good beer that everyone you know will like, even those damn snobby, American Guinness stout drinkers. Plus, you don't get called names for drinking this when you really want a cheer beer. It even has a twist off cap! This beer definitely stands out. It kicks ass at the fruit combination thing that so many other beers fail at. This beer really changed my view on Leinenkugel as a brewery. Though I don't know if my dismissal of them was due to me actually having and disliking one of their beers, or if I just really hated their logo and fonts. And everything else about their design. The whole package looks like it could be found at a crappy gift shop at the Cherokee Indian Reserve. Even so, I will definitely be picking up a six pack of this beer whenever the weather starts to warm up a little bit."
"Utterly a wreck, this one ended in a drain pour, which I seriously hate to do. This may actually only be like my second drain pour, it was just that bad. In the future I would not make this mistake again."
"If you like lemonade, go for it. If I am in the mood for a radler/shandy I would rather mix lemonade with a lager of my choosing."
"D: Ample taste with the lemony kick goes down pretty easy. Be ready for something thats not very ""beer-like""."
"Having never tried a ""shandy"" before I was very apprehensive. Beer with Lemonade sounded disgusting to me. I was mistaken. This hazy white/golden colored beer was a pleasant surprise. The sweetness and well, lemonade flavor make it a pretty good summer beer."
"D-3.5- I like this for what it is as a light lemon summer type beer, something different to try if you are in a lemon beer mood - whatever that means! I got this stuff for $3.99 a sixer in late summer, so I drank it with a smile on a hot day. 3.0 since it is a shandy - not a pale wheat ale, this is confusing?..."
"D - This stuff couldn't be much easier to put back. It's very unoffensive, but the problem is none of the flavors are strong enough. Everything about the beer is weak, and all I can take away is a vague lemon flavor over a weird light-beer graininess."
"This is not my type of beer. But then again, I guess, I have never had anything like this before so props for that and trying something new. Give it a try!"
"easy to drink, decent beer for after a hard day of work or maybe out at the pool, it seems to be more of a refreshment than a beer, somewhat like lemonade. not bad though."
"very good beer after a hard days work!!!"
"D= my stomach couldn't handle even half a bottle of this."
"This is a weird one. From Leinenkugel the makers of weird beer. Lemonaid and beer mixed together, sounds gross right? Well it's better then I expected it to be, not great though. Aperently this style of lemonaid beer is biger in England and parts of Europe but it is the only one I have seen in the U.S. It is a good summer beer, light and taste like lemonaid beer. Neither flavor is over-powering which is what I had expected it to be like. I can't say I could drink alot of them but every once and a while it would be ok to have a few. You have to try this one for your self to really understand the flavor."
"This is a drinkable beer, and refreshing for what you get. It isn't all that bad; just not something you would drink if you wanted a beer of substance."
"D: A little tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, the lemon flavor is so strong and sweet that this beer is the closest thing to a ""malternative"" beverage that I've seen while still technically being a beer."
"Well I'm not sure what to say about this one. A shandy is lager and lemonade mixed, and that's what this tastes like. The lemonade might not be the best (it tastes like powdered mix), and I'd like to see a hint more acidity, but I can hardly fault it. It's cloudy like lemonade (and actually has pretty good lacing), it smells like lemonade when you raise the glass to your nose, and it tastes like lemonade mixed with beer. And it's not overly sweet or overly bitter or overly acidic. So, overall it's fairly well done and nicely balanced. I enjoyed it, and I'd have another if I was at a BBQ or other warm-weather outdoor event."
"Unoffensive, it's a summertime drink that the ladies would like, and that won't hurt every now and then. Not really a pure beer though. The lemonade part is for real."
"Do not waste your time."
"Soft, hazy swiftly effervescent orange/lemon body with a sudsy, off-white head that settles to a thin line in a tumbler... lemon zest aroma--not to the point of DAWN, but close? Without a scent of malt or hop...soft, zesty, swift bubbles on the tongue... no impact early, but a burst of champagne bubbles blast late results in a pleasantly drinkable beer... lemonade indeed--not sure if this qualifies as a fruit beer or a cheap gimmick (most on this website seem to think the latter)... a bit of malt at the finish attempts to fortify with a backbone... ADMITTANCE: I like the alliterative name of this beer--who doesn't feel another era awaken with the word shandy?--and of all the Leinenkugel ""weisse"" assortment, this is the most pleasant to drink and the most thoughtless to enjoy, i.e., it does what it set out to do..."
"Leinenkugels Summer Shandy would make a good session brew on a hot summer day - designed for maximum drink ability at 4.2 ABV. Would like a little more flavor."
"Had this at a buddy's house as a leftover. I was expecting worse, but still think I would pass on purchasing this one."
"D- Not my type of brew. Interesting and different but I think I'll pass on this one."
"I personally think that lemonade and beer shouldn't be mixed, but I know of some friends that think the shandy is a great idea. This wasn't too drinkable for me."
"Thinner feeling than a wheat, but easy to drink. Gets a bit too sweet eventually. Well suited for the season on the label."
"D- If I didn't know this was beer before tasting I might mistake it for something else. That said, these are great on a hot summer day at the beach, playing golf, etc, and when appreciated for what it is can definitely be enjoyed."
"This beer will remain in my fridge until they stop making it."
"Unfortunatley, I was not as impressed with the beer as I worked my way through the sixer. The beer pours an odd yellow, maybe a little too yellow. The smell is pleasing to the nose, but it smells more of lemons than it does of beer. The mouthfeel is nice, as you taste the sweetness of the lemon, but also the slight bitterness of the wheat. It's the aftertaste that threw me, as the more I drank the stronger the sweet aftertaste lasted. In the end I think this is a good beer to have every once in a while on a hot day. But it is not a great drinking session beer."
"But surprisingly, both my neighbors and I agreed it was very drinkable, in the end. Suffice it to say that this is not the highest testament to the art of brewing one will find in stores this summer. But it's an interesting attempt, and a quite acceptable offering for a hot night out on the dec."
"The concept is fine - but, this is hardly a ""shandy"". Regardless, this will be suited to the people who like lemonade from a powder mix with just a tad of undetectable alcohol. Too sweet, in an ""artificial"" way, for me, though lemonade dryness almost makes up for it - almost."
"After what I've just said about it, I'm surprised to say that I still find this to be a good, easy-drinking, refreshing summer brew. On a nice hot day, this would definitely do the trick."
"Overall, this was a bit much. The label says ""Weiss beer with lemon"" so I was looking forward to something refreshing. Well the lemon was there, but I never did find the weiss beer part. It was light and ctirusy cool, but left me feeling more like I was holding a clear ""malt"" beverage than a beer. Too much lemon and way to sweet to even think about drinking more than one without getting a stomachache. Interesting, but more lemonade than beer. I won't be getting this one again."
"As were my expectations now, the first gulp felt thick and creamy. It looked like it was going to save the day for me, but it only stayed that way for a little bit. It decides to turn watery making me cry inside. In the end, this beer, felt like a good story gone wrong. It made me want it until I had it, the only way I can truly describe it is if Mary Shelly decide to brew beer waited for it and at that moment she tasted it she had an epiphany and came up with the story of Frankenstein, but, not the story we know and love today, no the first draft, the draft of a story that when finished looks awesome and feels awesome, but when you come back later and re-read it you realize how much it could have been better so you edit and re-edit it until you get a great story, that is what this needs it needs an edit, an edit to finish what should be a great story."
"Kudos to Leinies for bringing an unique beer flavor to the market. I enjoyed it with a little nostolgia & while listening to Paul Simon's ""Graceland"" album."
"Leinenkugel Summer Shandy tastes quite a bit like lemonade- a quality that would normally convince me to lower my rating. But there are some qualities that make Leinenkugel Summer Shandy different from many other fruit beers and make it more enjoyable. First, the fruit is not syrupy or excessively sweet. The taste of lemon is obvious, but this beer doesn't taste like Kool- Aid or any other sugary drink. Second, it still has characteristics of beer, even though the lemon taste dominates. It's a pretty good tasting beer and it does make a good choice for a hot summer day."
"Aroma is ""countrytime"" lemonade mix. Not the drink, the powder. Very acidic . Pours an odd shade of milky yellow with a billowing cream head that lasts throughout leaving quite a bit of lacing. I cannot taste any beer in this. Its all lemonade. Very acidic and harsh. Quite a bit of carbonation in conjunction with the lemonade makes it more like a soda. I can see where they were going with this but just went overboard on the lemonade. If it was a more natural lemon flavor it would probably be pretty good. but this tastes very artificial."
"Great summer beer but only in small quantities. As described it is very lemony. You get a lot more lemon than beer, but still a great combination for the summer! The wheat off sets it enough to let the title of beer remain. Hey, if you like lemonade and beer give this a try. I also recommend pouring this in a glass and adding a real lemon wedge and circling the rim of the glass then putting it right in the beer."
"Oddly enough, it's actually very drinkable and once I finished mine I was actually thinking about grabbing another just to follow it up with. I'd probably buy a sixer every summer just for the odd taste combination until someone managed to do a better lemonade-beer combination."
"Well, it come in a 12 oz brown longneck so I guess it's beer, but you could toss this one back like it was -- umm -- lemonade. I would have drunk this when I was a teen who liked the idea of drinking beer but not the beer taste. Did I mention it's really lemony -- like if you drank one immediately after reading this, you'd think ""Wow, that was more lemony than I had expected"". Lemony is a nice word -- try working it into a sentence today."
"Not sure where they are going with this one. I wanted a beer not a mike's ripoff."
"D - not to bad not awesome"
"The lemonade and citrus go well together, but the lemonade was a little strong and distracted from the flavor of the wheat beer. A little overpowering."
"My review makes it sound worse than it probably is. Served ice cold on a hot day, it would probably hit the spot. Any other time, and I don't think I would have more than one."
"This isn't my style but if offered I'd drink it again. Perfect for someone who wants to have a real beer instead of ""Random Persons Hard Lemonade Malt Beverage""."
"D - In short - I like this. Much better then Leinenekuger's ill fated Berry weiser, this one still tastes like beer. The lemonade/lemon flavor introduced is natural and not sickly sweet. I see people comparing this to Mike's Hard Lemonade, but I think that's a complete stretch. This is just a decent wietbier with some lemon flavors added to it which complements it well."
"Huge white fluffy head in a frosted mug with a fair lacing over a murky golden tan colored brew. The lemon is easily detected in the aroma to the extent that it's pretty hard to pick up much else, almost lemon-lime. If your not use to this mixture, it's a bit of a surprise, but you can adjust to it if you're open minded. Tastes sort of like a mellow lemon cake with modest sweetness. It's very easy drinking and refreshing and I would say it grows on you depending on your expectations. I probably could enjoy these if I just think more lemonade than beer, not often such a desirable option but, I can handle it once in a great while."
"I can only picture drinking this on a very hot summer day. Not typically my favorite style of beer but I still like it."
"Very drinkable beer. This is a very refreshing beer and very light, so it would be easy to drink quite a few."
"But again it will just tick you off if you think it will taste anything like a malty/bitter beer. It is what it is and that is a refreshing lemonade type beverage."
"Pours a hazy light yellow with 1 and a half fingers of foamy white head that has average retention and some good lacing. Smells of lemonade, wheat, and lemon candy. Tastes of sweet lemonade at first with some wheaty bread coming in behind the lemon sweetness. Finishes with a little extra punch of lemon zest. Light in body with medium carbonation, really sweet and lemon filled. Refreshing and extremely easy to drink, good on those hot summer days, but a little too much like lemonade not enough like beer for me to want to session. Wouldn't mind having one after mowing the grass though."
"D- i put it down but i wouldnt have another. It is an interesting idea but i was happy with the beer. I like their honey weiss though."
"Drinkability isn't bad at all. For a hot summer day, this stuff can certainly fix the thirst for a while and it's a good ""warm up"" beer for those who haven't had much beer before. It's a good brew for a hot summer day, but it's more like a glorified lemonade. Why not? Summer's here!"
"A very simple yet good beer."
"My wife liked it a lot and it was on tap so I had some and it wasn't bad. Next time I'm laying on the beach, this might hit the spot."
"Notes: Overall it's a refreshing summery beer that is very drinkable although it leans more towards a Mike's Hard Lemonade malt beverage than beer."
"This is alright. I won't go searching for it, but I can see that there could a an appeal for some not necessarily immersed in the hard core brew scene. In the end the lemon is too strong for my taste, and a more lightly balanced drink would have been more satisfying."
"It has been hotter than hell here in Florida lately, so I decided to give this a try in search of another refreshing beer to enjoy in the warm Florida summer. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a really nice looking cloudy pale golden white color, almost like a yellowish witbier. The aroma is more lemonade than beer, with a little bit of wheat peaking through the lemons. The taste is a hint of wheat mixed with an unsweetened lemonade flavoring. Overall, I am not a huge fan of mixing things into beer, so it is not surprising that I am not a huge fan of this beer. It is not really bad or offensive, but it simply isn't my thing."
"drinkability - Refreshing beer, but too much of a lemon taste here."
"D - I don't really know about this one I don't think I can drink another full bottle of this stuff again I hope my wife drinks the rest of the six pack after all it was her idea to get this stuff"
"I am surprised by how much I like it as a summer seasonal. Granted, I'd rather mix my own Radler or Russ but this would do in a major pinch. Nothing to freak out about, nothing to bash... it is a descent, gimmicky beer. I must say, Leine does brew 4 really popular wheat ales (largely, for the non-BA crowd)... Summer Shandy, Berry Weiss, Honey Weiss, and Sunset Wheat. They found their niche, kudos to them."
"I'd classify this beer as another ""lawnmower"" beer. You're hot, sweaty, smelly and stinky from cleaning out the septic tank or whatever, and you want to slake your thirst. Grab a couple of these guys. They'll go down just like... well, like lemonade. You'll hammer those down and go for the third before your stomach knows it has a visitor. But if you're chillin' on a so-so day looking for a good tasting manly beer, pass this one up and grab something else. There are plenty of others to choose from."
"D: Definitely drinkable although I don't think I could stand to drink more than a few at a time. Nice refreshing brew for the summer for sure."
"Don't compare this to your favorite IPA or RIS, have reasonable expectations, and you might just find that this brew is pleasing."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a light pale color with little to no head and a slight lace. At first you can smell a faint whiff of wheat and then the lemon dominates. The taste starts off like the smell with a taste of wheat to begin with and then the lemons come through and finishes with a bitter citrus aftertaste. The mouthfeel is sharp with a sour bitterness from the lemon and a good amount of carbonation. Lawn mower beer."
"Pours a bright cloudy lemon yellow with a tall white head that leaves a little lacing.The nose is all lemon which smells nice,but it reminds me of Detergent(Lysol Lemon) and while I like to mop my floors with it,I don't know if its what I want to smell in my beer,tho many people probably do.This tastes like lemon drops(the hard candy)with a similar sourness that is actually pleasent,I am surprised.It could have some more lemon flavor and stronger malt presence if I had a say,but then I'm sure my girlfriend would hate it along with most of the consumers who buy this on a regular basis.It's close to obnoxious with it's thin body and foamy carbonation.The next time I drink this it will be free,just like this time."
"I didn't think I would like this one, I haven't had good experiences in the past with fruit ""enhanced"" beers--see Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic. But I really enjoyed the bottle I had. Maybe it had something to do with the weather; I drank it on a 94-degree day with typical Midwest humidity. Not sure if it's more like lemonade-flavored beer or beer-flavored lemonade, but it is seriously refreshing after mowing the lawn."
"Overall this is going in my ""not a beer"" category. In and of itself it's not horribly bad; I've had much worse. Yet at the same time if you are looking for a beer with beer flavor, you are not going to be pleasantly surprised by this."
"Very refreshing...especially on this 95 degree SPRING day in PA!!! However, remindes me of ""Mike's Hard Lemonade""...but better, actually. (Less ABV%, but that's ok!) Nice change of pace...but not for an old-time ""beer-drinker."" It's worth a try...especially in the hot months....but NOT a beer to have with the game...or with your old man!!! Smooth, refreshing, and LEMONY!!! Good summer refresher. Leinie does a good job...and they're very unique. Gotta give 'em that. Cheers and saaalute my BA FRIENDS! Happy summer '08!!!!"
"Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy pours a hazy golden yellow with a white head from a twelve ounce brown bottle. It smells just like lemonade. The body is very light as is the flavor. Up front the lemonade flavor isn't bad, but then it seems kind of artificial in the finish. More a malternative than a beer."
"D : I don't plan on getting this one again. Couldn't finish the glass."
"M/D: Light beer that was smooth and creamy. The drinkability was extremely harsh and because of the sour vomit taste it was very hard to put down the throat."
"The best part about this beer is that you can drink a bounch of 'em...like coors light. The lemon is nice...but saying its infused with lemonade is a little misleading. The appearance is average, all the Leinies look the same with the exception of the berry. I would suggest this beer to an introductory drinker."
"overall, not something i would make a habit out of."
"D: This was really tough to get down. It's incredibly tough for me to pour something out but this was... tempting. I powered through it though and have to say that I wouldn't recommend this. To anyone."
"This pale wheat ale is a cloudy yellow color and has a beige head. Poor retention. The nose has a mixture of grainy malt and wheat. The taste is light and has a decent amount of mild malts. A middling body is heavy on carbonation. Not the most drinkable in my book. Just too light."
"D - Although not a great beer it is very refreshing and would be a good outside on a hot day beer."
"This is a simple beer, somewhat of a novelty, and nothing any beer lover should be embarrassed to admit liking. It's a step away from the usual summer stuff, and it might surprise you (it did me). The lemon element could've been 1) too tart, 2) too sugary/sweet, 3) too artificial tasting, and/or 4) wretched, but it's none of that. It's just a nice diversion from the big-ass ales many of us usually indulge in. Certainly a wiser choice than evil alcopops or those lime-infused beers the macro brewers are crapping out."
"Mouthfeel is very light and crisp. A refreshing lemon aftertaste. I really wasn't expecting to like this, but it is a lot better than I thought it would be. It's nothing serious to be sure, but would be great for a BBQ."
"D- I could pick up a sixer here and there on a really hot summer day at the beach!"
"D: A refreshing summer time alternative that looks like a wit but drank like a lemonade cooler."
"Poured a hazy yellow color with nice white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma was fruity dominated by lemons. Has a very citrusy taste to it. Pretty refreshing on a hot day. Body is on the thin side. Nothing spectacular, but not offensive and easy drinking."
"P.S.- This does not taste like other American Pale Wheat Ales. More like a Fruit/Vegetable beer if even a beer."
"Overall impression: Well, I haven't had any other beers of this style, so I don't have much to compare to. That being said, the beer is second stage here - this is an alcoholic lemonade with a bit of beer flavor in there if you really look for it."
"M&D: It's got a very light body and a watery mouthfeel, appropriate for the style they're going for. There's a good bit of carbonation, as well. As far as drinkability goes, the beer is light and summery, but it tastes pretty bad. I won't be getting another bottle ever again, and I would probably drink an American macro over this if I was just chilling on the porch."
" ~ In my humble opinion I'm not to impressed with the Summer Shandy. I will say though, I think the brewers succeeding in what they were attempting to accomplish. This is a beer and not a wine cooler. It does a good job satisfying thirst and can likely be consumed in large quantities. It is not something I'd purchase necessarily but it does have it's place among beers."
"12oz brown bottle. Pours a murky light yellow with a quarter inch of off-white head. Smells intensely sweet and lemony - almost like fake lemonade. Tastes very citrusy and somewhat pithy, though the flavor isn't as intense as the aroma is. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with a small amount of carbonation. Not bad, very easy-drinking and refreshing, and i can definitely see putting back a couple of these after a long hot day. That said, it seems less beery and more like an alco-pop, though it beats the heck out of Mike's or the like."
"Nice attempt at something different, but they need to tweak the recipe before I try it again."
"Caught somewhere between lemonade and an American Wheat, the beer is both appetizing and distracting at the same time. The aroma opens with a burst of lemons with a confectionate counterpart that takes the acidity off of the nose. A wheat malt balance attempts to balance out the lemonade character, but falls a bit short. Looks timid on the wheat with a slight haze, fizzy head formation and low retention levels. Straw colored and over-carbonated; quite spritz-y. Flavors are dominated by the lemonade sweetness and tartness with, again, lacking wheat beer flavors. Lightly bready, underhopped, and a timid barley / wheat base malt flavor keeps the beer acidic and one-dimentional. Textures are light, crisp, and a bit thin, but certainly refreshing and thirst quenching. Finishes, well, lemony with that mild bread base. Palate cleansing and ready for the next sip. The beer is pleasant enough, despite the lack of 'beer' qualities."
"Unfortunately, in spite of my love for Leine's Sunset Wheat, I have yet to enjoy any of their other varieties. Although not as sickening as the Berry Weiss, this beer is no exception. It smells and tastes exactly like watered down lemonade. It reminds of Mike's Hard Lemonade, which I dislike, as it tastes nothing like beer. I imagine Leinenkugel is attempting to copy Radler (A combination of beer and Sprite), as this made me think of the Radler I drank in Germany. However, there is not enough beer flavor to this brew to make it enjoyable. I couldn't finish even one bottle."
"The aroma is great. The color when poured gives the appearance of an unfiltered beer. The first taste leaves you in confusion as to what type of beverage you are drinking. Overall, this is a good summer drink. It is light, fruity, and quite tastey once you adjust to it."
"Just picked this one up and I am enjoying it chilled in my Samuel Smith pub glass. Pours a very cloudy pale sulfur color with an enormous white headthat stays up for ever and leaves great lacing. Smells very delightful, just like fresh lemonade. The taste is a little disappointing, it is pretty much like lemon water and nothing much more. Smooth at first and then a sting at the back of the tongue before a wet lemony finish. Pretty good beer but needs more flavor!"
"I had this beer for the first time this weekend. It was one of the most refreshing beers I've ever had. Not for the beer drinker who doesn't like a light, summery beer. I expected it to be lemony since it says on the bottle that it's ""lemonade beer", and it definitely was. I couldn't taste much wheat, but there were very vague traces. I don't think Leinenkugel was going for a beer that should be sipped, and has many different tastes, and I don't think they had the beer aficionado in mind when brewing it. But they succeeded at what they were going for."
"D: I guess its drinkable for the summer if I was sitting by a pool in the mood for a lemonade. Refreshing characteristics, Ill give it that."
"Had this at a beer dinner that paired the Summer Shandy as well as the Sunset Wheat from Leinenkugel with an orange creme brule. The two paired amazingly with notes of lemon throughout the Shandy. Character that holds strong to both the Lemonade as well as the Wheat flavors that this beer is designed around. Keep this in the fridge for the ladies this summer!!!"
"I purchased this beer in a limited edition case of their seasonal beers. This brew looks like lemonade when poured into a glass with a trace of carbonation. It smells like lemonade, but tastes like lemon furniture polish. I'll save the rest for my brother in-law when he visits...he'll drink anything"
"This is an excellent session brew for a hot sunny day (or a cold spring day during the NFL draft)! Very light and drinkable...a brew that doesn't get old after a few bottles. This is a beer I'll continue to keep picking up in the future."
"D--Certainly drinkable and sessionable. Refreshing. Bring a twacker in the rowboat as you jig for crappie!"
"D- Very refreshing, I'd think you could make your own radlers just as easy(mixing beer with lemonade). I'd gladly drink this on a hot day, or any day for that matter."
"D - For only having average taste and mouthfeel... I find myself picking this up regularly. It is really nice on a warm summer day with while burgers are on the grill or while sitting out on the porch watching the wind blow the leaves in the trees."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades quickly to ring and leaves some lace. Murky pale amber color. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Lemonade nose. Flavor is like slightly fizzy, sweet lemonade with vague hints of hops way in the background not at all like an English shandy. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Decent stuff, and an interesting take..."
"The mouthfeel was worse--too sour, a bit flat, and thin. Unpleasant on the whole. What started with some promise ended with a whimper. Not a horrible beer, and it does beat back the heat a bit, but not one I'll grab again. Mediocre."
"Oh and yes, we caught walleyes while fishing on the Fox River just south of the Buffalo Lake Dam."
"Quite surprised by this one...always heard of shandy style beer and I was not let down. Very sour/fruit smell and a taste to follow. Low on head and carbonation but I don't believe a large head is necessary on this beer. Definitely represents the Leinenkugel family well with the fruit theme and very drinkable. Would recommend it during the summer due to the lemonade mixed with beer...makes a very interesting/exotic summer drink."
"One is enough in a sitting - although I look forward to one on a 90 degree August afternoon"
"drinkability is not good. this is reminiscent of under-sweetened, overwatered lemonade. aside from that, the malts just get in the way of the lemon flavor, making this one easily passed up."
"This beer is a cloudy amber rather like a good wheat beer. Aroma is strongly lemony and wheaty, more the former. Flavor is typical of a wheat beer but with a much stronger citrus component, suggesting a blend of beer and lemonade, i.e., shandy. A smooth, refreshing drink for a warm sunny day - or to bring sunshine into a dreary day."
"Drinkabilty is very good. I don't care what the usual ""Beer Advocate"" users think of this beer, but on a warm summer day I could drink a lot of these...."
"At some point in the brewing process, didn't someone raise their hand and say: ""this is a bad, bad product""?"
"I'd say try it for sh!ts and giggles, but if you insist on really substantial beers, this won't be your cup of tea. At all."
"If I wanted a damn lemonade I'd drink one. I wanted and was expecting a beer, and that's not what I got. I assume this is what those Hard Lemonade things taste like, and if so I don't know how people can consistently drink them. I enjoy the Leine Sunset Wheat. I was not at all happy with this one. Don't bother."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with dense fast fading white head and spotty lacing. Smell: lemonade. Taste: highly carbonated lemonade with a touch of wheat. Mouthfeel: carbonated lemonade. There's not much here to suggest that this is a beer rather than a less sweet malternative. Doesn't stand up to other pale wheats I've tried, even though this is certainly refreshing."
"A pale, anemic-looking yellow color with a medium-sized white head. It had a citrus aroma, which seemed mainly lemon. Definite lemon taste, tiny bit sour. Fairly pleasant. I might have liked it more if I had been drinking it on a hot summer day, rather than the cold gray day that was present at the time."
"D: so-so, it was a cold night but I could bet that if it were a hot day it would go down so smooth"
"Pours a great golden straw color, with a nice bit of head and great lacing for a wheat beer. Wonderful scent, a nice wheat/straw aroma with a strong lemon/lemonade scent (the lemon is a bit too strong, I wish the wheat came out just a little more). It has a great mixed flavor, a nice wheat beer with a huge lemonade hit (again, just a bit less lemon and a bit more wheat would've been excellent). It goes down exceptionally smooth, it would be horribly easy to drink a few of these while mowing the yard. A nice shandy. It's not a great pale wheat ale, but it is a great wheat ale with lemon/lemonade."
"Verdict: I really don't like this much. The aroma was nice but it goes downwards after that."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer. It would make a great summer grass cutting brew."
"Drinkability- A good mixed crowd party beer."
"Smells like the bottled lemon juice that comes in the yellow bottles in the grocery store, or in other words, kind of artificial, and not like beer at all. It also looks pale and sickly, like watery lemonade. Taste is very much lemonade like, and more so than beer. Granted this is not a good beer, nor , but it is easy to drink and summery."
"This is an odd beer. It is more like Mikes Hard Lemonade than a beer. Not something I will ever get again."
"In the Leine's fruity beer category, I still prefer the Sunset Wheat."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"color looks like lemonade mixed with ice tea; sort of a golden hue with a brown tint to it..not particularly appetizing; has a nice crisp and fresh lemony smell but more like a lemonade smell than something i would associate with a beer; sort of tastes like a mike's lemonade but with less carbonation; yet i still think that is over carbonated; because of the carbonation it also has an odd feel in the mouth; very acidic and can really feel the bubbles on your tongue; almost like if you were to drink a soda...overall not too bad yet nothing special; i could see this as a beer to bring out at a summer party as it is not too complex, would probably be appeasing to most people and a little different than the normal macro brews"
"My summer refreshment can be summed up right here with this one. . . and at a nice low price!"
"On tap at Easy Street Cafe in Toledo. Murky bright yellow color with a nil white head that looks a little too similar to a glass of lemonade. Very little lacing. Aroma of Lemon Pledge and hops. Light-bodied and fizzy with a taste like...lemonade beer. Lemons and grassy hops are really all there is to this beer. The finish is citrusy and mercifully short. Not for me."
"Taste, well, nothing but lemon pledge, or lemon cleaner. Just about the most discusting beer I have had in a long time. Can't find anything good except it poured down the drain, making it smell nice."
"overall, to me this is too sweet, i cant get over how much this beer reminds me of honey weiss"
"I was stuck at a wedding and many receptions and parties and stopped and got some of this at the grocery store because it looked to be a decent alternitave to lagers, I was disappointed. This was to much like a malternative to me. The hallmark banana flavor was overpowering and overall the beer just didn't have much balance between the fruitiness of the wheat and hops to cut the sweets..It was ok but I only had two bottles and switched to Yeugnling."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale wheat scent along with a citrusy lemon zest. The taste is average. It has a very light wheat flavor. It's a bit watery and is covered up with a lame lemon essence. The lemon flavor is weak and doesn't lend itself well to the rest of the palate. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is not a very good seasonal at all. It should have more lemon flavor as well as more malt content. This comes across as a weak wheat ale with an even weaker lemon content."
"Pours a light yellow, mostly opaque, with a skim of white head on top. Nose is strong on lemon, a touch of wheat. Taste is likewise - this one's nearly lemonade it's so overwhelmingly lemon. Less wheat than the flavor. I guess a hint of spice, although that might be being generous. Body is medium, solid carbonation. This one's about what you'd expect; a simple, overwhelming flavor. I guess I could throw back a bunch if I needed to."
"Thanks to Pegasus for the sample"
"Thanks to genog for this gem of a bonus. Pours a cloudy and murky light urine color with a slight head that dies quick and doesnt lace. Smells of a lemon cough lozenge. Tastes like the powdered vitamin pack Emergen-C in tap water. Tangy, highly carbonated but doesnt hide a thing. Light in the mouth. Tastes between lemonade and theraflu. Had to choke this down but should have poured it out. If you like lemon jolly ranchers in zima, this is your brew."
"This 12 oz bottle pours a cloudy yellow color that is clear visibility through it. Smell is weak in every aroma. I can smell a bit of lemon, and a small bit of the weiss part of spices. Taste is at first a carbonated weiss beer with lemon, and spices but then the faint, watered down taste of lemonade pops into the senses. Not really a very welcome taste when I am trying to drink a hefeweizen. I will say the crisp carbonation is refreshing on a hot day, but the beer is not my favorite. Weak in all aspects except the crisp refreshing carbonation."
"Not a very good beer, but as far as shandie's are concerned, this is pretty damn tasty. I could kick back a few of these on a hot summer day."
"The taste was lemonadey, the body was light with nice mouthfeel. Easy drinkin', refreshing on the hot dog days of a PA august."
"The appearance of this one is so different from everything else - it's incredibly opaque and pale colored, like a butterscotch lollipop. The head is white and foamy. In the nose you can easily notice wheat, and the zesty, sugary lemonade. That's what you taste, too - lots of citrus, and enough lemonade to be pretty refreshing. In the mouth it's OK, a little dry. Overall, it's not what a serious beer drinker wants, but it does the job it's set for, and it goes down really easy. Maybe you wouldn't want more because it's not very interesting."
"I would recommend mixing fresh squeezed lemonade with a decent lager. This is more like a Smiroff ice type artificial tasting malternative"
"Light and easy to drink, nothing too overpowering. A bit watery without much body, but that it how it is meant to be. Light, refreshing, designed for a hot summer day. Intersting and decent, not great and not terrible either."
"It is light bodied beer that is super refreshing in my opinion. I could drink these all day long on a hot day."
"D  Not my style, but could easily kick a few of these back, especially on a hot day."
"I loved this beer! As soon as I opened the bottle I could smell the strong aroma of lemon. Poured a hazy yellow with a thick creamy white head. The taste was definately lemonade with wheat flavor abounding. I found this to be quite refreshing while sitting by the pool on a hot day, grilling, or just enjoying the warm summer nights. This beer goes down very easy and compliments the season well. This is my second review of this beer... Now that the dog days of summer are in full swing I felt like this one needed a second look since for me the hot weather makes it even better!"
"Drinkability - Leine's used to have some cachet. Now it seems like they're just trying to bridge the gap between Miller Lite and Smirnoff Ice. For this reason, I feel like a tool when I have one of these in my hand."
"D: It's ok and maybe worth once in a while on a nice summer day. But I would not buy this on a regular basis even if I could."
"Drinkability - a fine pick on a hot day. This is different, tasty, and a nice break from the norm. It has the sweetness that you might associate with alcopop but the lemonade does a nice job of separating itself from that group at least a little bit."
"This is a really surprisingly tasty beer. I had one straight out of a bottle at a party and liked it so much I wanted to give it a real taste at home. The ale taste is low end but the lemonade flavor perks it right up and makes this a very drinkable beer."
"garden salad. A good beer to start the kids out on."
"Pours a clowdy pale straw, much like an american wheat. Big white head persists. Initial aroma is lemon, but some malt comes through as this beer warms up. First impression is lemonade with beer poured in it (given the bottle says ""weiss beer with lemonade"" I would say they hit this one almost right on the mark (I would say they need to reverse the order and call it lemonade with weiss beer). I wouldn't buy this stuff, but on a hot day it isn't bad, it goes down easy, but I keep burping up lemon!"
"This one pours a hazed pale lemon-tinged yellow color with a bubbly white head and sporadic lacing in the tall pilsner glass. The nose is of light wheat grains and lemonade powder. Not bad at all, just unusual for a beer. This smells of summer. The palate is actually considerably better than I anticipated. A solid American wheat beer with lemonade accents that, in my mind, could have easily been overdone. They're not. Subtle lemonade flavors intermingle with the light, palate-friendly wheat beer to create a summer refresher. I'd wager this is what Leinie's had in mind. Mouthfeel is light and unchallenging, as expected of the style, but it's not to a fault. The easy mothfeel and finish, with only a slight citrusy bitterness, add to the clean cool attitude of this beer. Exceedingly drinkable; this beer is made for the summertime. This is one you can drink on the cold side and not lose a lot of flavor, since it's really pretty staightforward in terms of flavor profile. I have to say I've been impressed with a couple of Leinenkugel's beer of late, but none more than this one for it's sheer ease-of-use and originality. Enjoy this one at your next summer party or picnic. If you're looking for a world class beer, this aint really it, but if you want something that is a unique change of pace, you might just dig it."
"D - Pretty rotgut stuff. It's not all bad, and I would drink one again if offered to me for free, but I probably won't buy this again...although my fiance loves it so I probably will buy it again for her."
"Gave one to the wifey, she likey and agreed it would make for a summer quencher and change of pace. Fork, give it a try as a nice summer change up. But man, donno about how they would slide after the first 2 or 3..."
"Thumbs up to Leines for being brave with their brewing/business. I'm not the biggest Leinenkugel fan but it takes some stones to bend SABMiller over and tell them you're making a shandy whether they like it or not. I imagine some ""girl drink"" talk went in to pitching this brew but I'm a dude and it's an alright beer."
"Definately worth a try!"
"Drinkable yes, goes down easy. A real pleaser on a hot day. We'll reach 90's, Im saving accouple for that. The low abv. is non-intrusive and aids the beers use."
"I think it's pretty obvious that the determining factor in the quality of any given shandy is the quality of the beer (all lemonade uses a pretty standard recipe, after all). I hate to say it, but this brewery isn't known for the quality of its beer... which necessarily limits the quality of any shandy that they could produce. If Leinenkugel has determined that this stuff will increase their sales, more power to them."
"Tried this beer several times out of a bottle, but just couldn't get myself to enjoy any of it. The apprearance was cloudy much like the sunset wheat. Once poured into a glass and straight from the bottle, it smelled of terrible artifical lemon. I was unsure if I was about to drink a shandy or lemon pine sol. The taste was bad enough to make Kool Aid Man gag. It tasted of the most artifical lemon flavor mixed with flat soda water. The mouthfeel was terrible as well, because the carbonation was doing a nasty number on my tongue. The overall drinkibility was awful. This is by far the worst beer I have sampled of the Leinenkugel's line or from any brewery for that matter."
"Light bodied, drinkable, especially ice cold. Worth trying as a summer cooler. Not much like beer. but it's not bad, and is refreshing on a hot day."
"I think this one should be filed under fruit beer. There's a big, tart lemonade flavor up front with a bit of wheat flavor following. The aroma has a bit of lemon. It's kind of like they took a very pale wheat beer and dumped Country Time lemonade mix into it. If you love lemons and NEED them in beer, go for this otherwise, its not much more than lawnmower beer."
"I couldn't finish this. It doesn't taste like the shandy's I used to drink in the UK during vacations in the 80s. Bleagh."
"I have to go out on a limb here and disagree with a lot of reviewers here. I thought this was the best Leine's I have tried. I have a couple left, but I have had a good portion of their selection. Anyways, what I was most impressed with was the smell and taste. The appeance and Mouthfeel as debatable, but the mix of lime, honeydew and light citrus hops with a touch of sweet malt can really hit the spot on a warm day."
"Hmm? I liked this but it is certainly a departure. Some people may spit this out confusing it with a lemonade. You can smell the terpenes before you even get this to your face. The head was almost non-existent which could have been operator error on the part of the kids bartending. But all in all it was refreshing on a warm day which is its intention. It wasn't overly sweet even though it was incredibly flavorful and it didn't have the astringency usually associated with poorer versions. This one falls into the lawnmowers or daygame category alongside Samual Adams Summer Ale."
"Instead of most summer beers which are a beer with lemonade flavor, this is a lemonade with lemonade flavor. More comparable to Mike's Hard Lemonade, minus the severe heartburn. This is very tastey stuff; potentially the most refreshing summer beer you can buy. I think it's great, although It's certainly on the fringes of the ""malt beverage"" catagory. The big difference, though, is no cloying sweetness or obvious sugar additives. I'll be stocking up of this for the summer months."
"D - It was drinkable but it didn't remind me of beer. It certainly makes a nice lemonade."
"Would not drink a lot of these in one sitting but could be a choice for a day when you had other things to do later. Makes me want to ride my bike."
"Overall, I can see a market for this one, albeit a small one. It's a little easier on the way down than a Mike's Hard, not exactly a malternative but somewhere shy of a beer. Definitely drink cold, wouldn't hurt to have a beach handy."
"A decent novelty beer. It's a novelty, keep that in mind. This is a self-declared shandy that has no pretentions of being a world class brew. With that in mind, it's not hard to enjoy..."
"I think drinkablility on this one will improve as the temperature rises. This is a beer that will slide down fast on those hot summer days. Probably good it is 4.2% abv for that reason. While this beer didn't wow me, it is quaffable. Take a chance and try this one."
"Overall not to good, the beer flavors are very minor and yeild to the dominance of the lemons. I rather like lemonade, and beer, but apperently not so much together."
"Taste and Mouthfeel: Asinine! really really just terrible nothing good about this beer justifies it except that you can drink it fast but why would you do that when the acid would give you gut rot, I really love Leinies beer but this a an awful product that leaves the worst aftertaste and should never be boughten again I'm going to call them and get my refund back."
"This beer poured with a white head that quickly subsided, but had decent lace. Very hazy pale yellow. Not aesthetically pleasing to gaze into, but I'd rather drink it anyway. The nose is natural lemon beer. Average body that does seem to get a tad thin as it warms towards the bottom of the glass. Definite beer character to balance the lemonade. Not bad. Less lemony than the Stiegl I recently had, but at the same time not quite as polished an effort. Double the strength of the Stiegl as well. Finish is unremarkable but not bad either."
"This beer is so terrible that its almost unbelievable. But (and I say this with complete seriousness) you absolutely have to try it for yourself!! It will blow your mind."
"Just revisited this again to give it another chance. Why do I do stuff like this to myself. I think it's actually worse."
