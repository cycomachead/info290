There is just an off smell with some strong blueberries in there.  Taste is similar, blueberries, but not much else other than something off.  Very light, not much substance.  Overall not a beer that I will revisit.","JamieDuncan","Feb 20, 2015"

3.4,1.2,,,,,,"Popping the top to this brew it has a smoky type smell for reasons unknown as it is a wheat beer with blueberry.  Pouring into my SAPP I get a brew with a bright golden color and a thin foamy white head.  On the taste this brew has a spicy smoky flavor more than a sweet blueberry taste.  Mouthfeel is good and the aftertaste is consistent with the upfront flavor.  Nothing too spectacular here.  Won't seek this one out but would drink it if offered one.","mooseisloose","Nov 13, 2014"

Flavor is slightly tart with blueberry/citrus notes and even earthy dry grains.

Smell is somewhat missing, as there's just a hint of aroma of blueberry on the nose in front of a nearly nonexistent, faint, no - strike that; there is no other smell. Appearance is. Pretty pedestrian as well, with virtually no lacing or head sitting on a mundane gold liquid with a few overachieving bubbles trying to escape. But, for what it is from a style standpoint, it is pretty good and could serve well as a BMC alternative at summer parties.","gopens44","Apr 03, 2014"

There is a pronounced blueberry aroma with a slight hint of the wheat beer base. The taste follows closely with distinct blueberry notes and mild wheat beer characteristics. On the plus side, the blueberries aren't overwhelming or cloying. There is a slight carbonation feel but it doesn't go too far towards fizzy. Not a bad beer and if you like fruit-based flavors in your beer this might be right up your alley. I was hoping for more wheat beer flavors than this provided.","delta490","Mar 09, 2014"

It's subtle. The flavors too are light and approachable. There is a moderate amount of blueberry muffin followed by pale malt and a yeastiness that leads into the aftertaste. It's ok. It's somewhat artificial. I can see this as being extremely female friendly. It is very light and overly drinkable.

However, this particular offering is actually one of the better ones I've had, if not the best. Oddly, the blueberry character seems artificial at times, but very close to blueberry pie in subsequent tastes. This certainly qualifies as a refreshing and crisp beer, and while I might not have been completely won over by the flavor, I would have no problem drinking a few of these in succession.","TechTriumph","Jun 13, 2012"

It has a mild blueberry flavor but the blueberry aroma is lacking. Overall, I like it and will drink it if I have limited choices.","aprila220","Apr 11, 2012"

This is a decent blueberry beer, honey colored, with very little blueberry scent (compared to other blueberry beers). The taste of blueberry seemed to be merely a hint.

I could catch a whiff of it from 2 feet away. The taste, however, was much somewhat muted. It was malty and fruity, but not as fruity as I thought it would be after the smell. There was also some light hoppiness to give it a more rounded taste than just fruit juice, but for the most part, this beer was one-demensional. Mouthfeel was light and well carbonated.

Anyway it poured a fairly bright golden yellow with a large fizzy white head. This gradually faded and was replaced by a thin film of lace and copious amounts dripping down the side. Ample carbonation could be seen in the somewhat hazy interior of the glass. The aroma was very light, not overwhelming with the fruit at all, but rather very subtly blueberry with hints of yeast and a somewhat muted hop presence. A touch of bread like malts in the back. The taste was lighter then what I had thought. A typical yeasty pale with a significant touch of blueberry in the front. Ample carbonation again gave it a very nice and light feeling along with keeping it from going flat. There was a decent enough dry finish and the flavor did linger for a decent amount of time. I put the first one down in no time flat, but as far as how many I could have, the sweetness may limit this, as I find after too many I start to get a little queasy.

Very much like blueberry pancakes actually only with a faint citrus note and a musty whiff here and there. Luckily, the flavor of the berries does not dominate. There's enough grain and mild sweetness to balance it out nicely, leaving you with a beer that is unmistakably a fruit beer, but not in an overwhelming, syrupy kind of way.

The head was white in color; at the zenith the foam was one finger in height. In a split second it dissipated to a very thin collar that was basically naked in the middle. There was no subsequent lacing. Disappointing. This beer is nothing special to look at. The nose is dead on if this was uncooked blueberry muffin mix. The blueberries dont smell fresh or real yet they dont smell so fake Im repulsed. Soft grainy notes are also in play. The potency is low and so is the complexity. The bouquet doesnt say much at all. It is not offensive but it is not inviting. Rather ho-hum. The palate is more rounded than the nose. Maltier too, I get a big blast of grains just like I did in the bouquet. Interestingly the blueberry flavor is very weak, I can find it at the back but it gets lost in this beer. What does it get lost in you may ask? Im not sure because there isnt much going on here. This is a brewpub quality, throwaway fruit beer. Ubiquitous. The palate has some flavor but it is odd and not that special. There is a cake-like sweetness that, while soft, is not working for me. Also, Im burping blueberries, which is not as cool as burping hops. The palate is inoffensive and undeveloped. Lackluster. Medium-light in body with low but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant and very fitting for this beer. I could see this beer being liked by a good number of people (maybe not BA types). I could also see this beer being hated by a good number of people (maybe BA types). To me this beer is just okay.

Leaves very little lacing, but lots of tiny bubbles rush to the top of the glass, trying to get my attention. Aroma is tart berry, but only slight blueberry. Some biscuit and earthy yeast are also present, as are some faint citrus and piney hops. Taste is well carbonated, very tart with berry, and has some earthy yeast notes and wheatgrain. This isn't so bad, but is not one of Sweetwater's better offerings. I look forward to visiting my old haunts in Atlanta, this summer when the state of Georgia, hopefully, will allow their microbreweries to turn out some bigger beers. I'm certain that Sweetwater will be one of the leaders of the unchained.","merlin48","Sep 16, 2003"

2.48,-26.2,3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Pours a cloudy yellow with a finely carbonated white head that recedes in a minute or two and remains on the top of the beer for the duration. The aroma is very perfumy with a hint of blueberries. The carbonation hits the tongue and blocks out any intricacies in the maltiness. A slight hint of blueberries manages to sneak in there before disappearing again. It reappears even more faintly in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin and light-bodied. Drinkability is below my average for Sweetwater Brewing Company. If you accidentally allow the beer to warm greatly, the perfuminess of the brew is overpowering, and in my case, stomach-turning.","jlervine","Jun 14, 2003"
3.62,7.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On tap at the Mill in Birmingham, AL. Fizzy, cloudy yellow body. Tight fizzy white head. Noticable fresh picked blueberry and cut grains smell. Nice blueberry taste, crisp and clean. Plenty of hop snap to the finish to clean things out. Nice fruit taste without the fuzzy tongue coating of some other fruit beers. Blueberry taste is pretty good. Light bodied and highly charged carbonation. A decent version and right up there with Bar Harbor Blueberry Ale.","StevieW","Beers"
3.57,6.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer poured a hazy yellow gold gold color and formed a small bubbly white head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of hops, malt and blueberry/cirtrus. The flavor was of hops with a hint of blueberry but finishes with a grain/wheat style similar to a wheat beer. I think our local brewer Barley's does a better job with their Raspberry Wheat than what they are trying to accomplish here.","Wildman","0"
4.27,27.1,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"What a great fruit beer. The beer has a nose of blueberry, with hints of hops and traces of malt. The color is a pale cloudy yellow consistent of a wheat brew, with a small white head. The taste is that of blueberry muffins, which is what you would expect of a blueberry wheat beer. The finish has subtle malt and very light hops with I think help to keep the sweetness of the blueberries in check. Very drinkable fruit beer without too much sweetness. I agree with Uglyradio?s assessment in that I could not drink this all the time, but I wouldn?t drink any fruit beer on more than an occasional basis.","Loki","Oct 15, 2002"
3.51,4.5,2.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Very passable fruit beer. Thanks belgianhomebrew! Aroma was sweet and fruity. Pale gold with a medium bone white head. Flavor was reminiscent of a Witbier like Blue Moon. I honestly did not detect any blueberries in the flavor. On the scale of light, thin summer beers I couldn't find much wrong with it.","Dogbrick","Apr 28, 2002"
3,-10.7,3,3,3,3,3,"The pour a hazy lemon yellow color, the head mastodonic, frothy, brilliant white in color, the lace is silky sheets, which cling to the glass. The nose is citrus, sweet blueberry tones, clean and fresh. Start is sweet, the top light in mouth feel, the finish excessively acidic, minimally hopped, sparingly dry, and not something that ""excites"" me much.","Gusler","Apr 11, 2002"
2.52,-25,3,3.5,2,2,2.5,"Not really the best beer.  Some chill haze and a weak head.  One eyebrow went up when I took a whiff.  Interesting blueberry aroma with something pungent in the background, not sure what, maybe some yeast.  Has a distinctive blueberry flavor, but I agree it doesn't taste natural.  No bitterness at all, there is a very faint floral, almost perfumey flavor in the background, perhaps a feable attempt to achieve complexity.  Fizzy and no real aftertaste.  This may be for some, but not for me.  Keep trying Sweetwater.","DrewS","Beers"
2.37,-29.5,2.5,3,2,3,2,"This beer is horrible. Take a bag of Jiffy blueberry muffin mix and turn it into a beer. The Jiffy muffins are only barely edible to start with and when they're turned into beer it's undrinkable. I couldn't finish the freaking pint. It was just gross. They say they use fresh blueberries, but it tastes like the fake stuff. This beer really pissed me off. The smell is ok, though, but imagine a budweiser (a little darker) with a slight greenish tint from the blueberries. Horrible, Horrible beer.","aracauna","0"
