"Once again they got the Orange just right!  Covers up the tin taste that wheat beers have.  Wife is always bummed when they run out."
""
""
"I really tried to like this but it tasted like fizzy bad orange soda with a very light feeling white beer.  Could have done without the extra fizz and a little sweeter."

"A little out of season, as this was hiding in my fridge since mid-summer, but a welcome break from the robust stouts and spiced creations of the holidays. Frothy, white, meringue-like head forms after an assertive pour in to a tall weizen glass. The 2 finger crest settles in to a thin layer of foam with little to no lacing. This brew could pass for fresh squeezed oranges, with its hazy, unfiltered appearance and juice-like color. The aroma reminds me of half time at youth soccer matches, with freshly sliced oranges taking center stage against the backdrop of a grassy pitch. The flavor is not altogether different than what is achieved by dropping a slice of orange in to (insert random American Pale Wheat Ale), although with little other pronounced flavor. The wheaty mouthfeel gives it some body, and helps add a little depth with a grain-like finish. Pleasantly refreshing. I am detecting some sour citrus notes. Lemon, pith, and sweet candied oranges. The carbonation is lively, and helps create a thirst-quenching quaff.  If you are an aficianado of orange soda, then this is your beer. I'm not sure if this can really be called beer actually. But whatever you choose to call it, it's delicious and easy to drink. I am in to my second pour as I finish this review. The low ABV only adds to the refreshment. I'll be looking forward to this one each summer, and will gladly drink this over the abhorrent lemon shandy varieties that I've tried. Unlike their recipe of dumping country-time lemonade in to a cheap wheat beer, this one seems more natural and palatable. It's a one-trick pony with a pretty nice trick."

"Disappointed with this one.. Love orange but it is just not my bag. Aroma is great, but it can't save the taste.."
"Tasty, refreshing, a good example of the style."

"The beer's best quality has gotta be its smell.  It smells like orange juice.  So if you have a nagging wife or if you want to have a bottle at work, just pour it into a glass and tell people you're drinking healthy orange juice.  It'll be our little secret."

"I really enjoyed this one. Its like an orangeade got together with a beer. Some may not like the fact that it doesn't have a very strong hoppy flavor but I think its just right for a relaxing day."

"I enjoyed this on a beautiful Indian Summer day, and perhaps the last of the balmy days..."

"Not as good as I'd hoped considering how good the summer shandy is, but not terrible. It tastes a bit artificial and maybe a bit too bitter in the aftertaste. Not bad though."

"Being unable to find an individual bottle or can of this stuff for a couple years now, imagine my happy surprise to find this on tap during my first visit to a Hooters (thanks, by the way, to my man VDubb and his lovely wife).  It pours a cloudy brass-amber topped by a finger of white foam.  The nose comprises straight Creamsicle undercut by a bit of wet wheat.  The taste leads with the wheat (now less wet), then proceeds into some orange wedge, and then a bit of coriander.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this was definitely a step up from the sadness that is Summer Shandy (however little that actually says), but it falls a bit short for me in terms of full enjoyment.  It's not bad, but nothing I feel like trying again any time soon."

"Overall: I liked their summer shandy but this edges it out. Great light flavor for the summer time. Could definitely drink a few of these relaxing outside. Would definitely pick up again"
"I had pretty low expectations for this brew. It surprised me. While it was artificially sweet, I actually enjoyed the orange shandy. It can be overpowering with orange flavoring but overall, not bad."
""
""
"Overall (3.64) : Much better than their Summer Shandy. All in all it's a capable beer and worthy of a try. I wouldn't have a problem grabbing more of these for a hot day in the sun or in the shade."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a half inch white head that fizzled away quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing. The brew mostly smells like oranges and orange peel, along with a general citrus aroma (reminds me of Tang and other orange like citrus drinks) and some bready/grainy malt. I think the taste is pretty much like the aroma, it does remind me more of a slightly watered down citrus/orange drink than a fruit beer. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and easy to drink. Overall I like this. I think it's a good choice for a warmer day, it wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these."
"Leinenkugel consistently amazes me. For being a mainstream brewer, they release ample amounts of unique and often complex beers. Even if I'm not a big fan of some of their offers (IE: Canoe Paddler, which I'm looking to retry next season), the fact that they can throw out multiple different shandies, season offerings, and unique looking beers such as Creamy Dark and Red Lager year after year is nothing short of amazing. Orange Shandy is definitely my current favorite of their offerings."

"By far more smooth than most shandys. First I liked Blue moon because you have the orange to offset the taste. Then I progressed to Shock top & now this is the ultimate orange beer. No orange needed and no harshness like with Blue moon. This is a must try seasonal beer that is perfect for the beach or anytime!"

"Think creamy head. Good taste. Would of expected more of an orange taste then what there was. We play a lot of yard games in my neighborhood and beer often gets real warm while outside. No matter. I've drank this beer almost tepid in temp and it still tasted good and went down smooth. Perfect summer beer when it's really hot outside. Extremely refreshing."
""
"O - Nothing special, but decent for what it is. A great beer to drink on a summer day while mowing the lawn, low ABV and refreshing flavor make it a good session beer for someone looking to drink a few without worrying about getting hammered."
""
""
""
"This beer is palatable with a shot of high quality bourbon to offset the Orange Fanta flavor. With a 4.2% alcohol content, the bourbon is a definite prerequisite. It's no wonder Wisconsin is always cold and gloomy. But, at $9.98 for a case of bottles, you can't go wrong."
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, orange candy, and orange juice aromas. Taste is much the same with watery orange soda and orange chewable vitamin flavors on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is quite drinkable for what it is, but it has a somewhat artificial quality in the aromas and flavors."
""
""
"Overall: A solid beer to end the evening at an affordable price. A credible alternative to any of the Beergaritas and Hard Lemonade products in the same market space."
""
""
""
""
"A big disappointment. the orange is artificial -almost tasted like tang. This was tough to choke down. The overall orange flavor overpowered everything else and it was a poor orange taste at that. Weak head, the almost a dry taste in the mouth. Ended up drinking three; the rest went down the drain."

""

"So to sum up, it's interesting and quite refreshing. If you like shandy's, this has more alcohol than quite a few of the European versions, and it's not as sweet."
""
" I'd recommend trying it to others, provided they don't mind some fruity-ness in their beers."
""
""
""
"It poured a hazy orange color body with a small fizzy head. The smell has a orange juice smell to it. The taste is like the summer shandy juice with orange flavor. The flavor has a light orange flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall a good beer."

""

"3.45/5.00"
""
"Overall, it wasn't as sweet and juicy as I expected a mass produced shandy to be. Orange is noticeable, but not too dominant. This one tastes basically like a Blue Moon that they put an orange slice in."
""
""
""
"O. The overall generic orange taste is just way too overpowering."

"O- orange juice with a malty finish. It not had and is pretty refreshing but it doesn't really taste like beer. I also find it strange that this is in the fall variety pack, as opposed to spring or summer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Another bizarre concoction from Jake and the crew. Let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a nice waft of orange very similar to a tequila sunrise. Pours into the only glass I have handy with a thin but fine bubble creamy head topping a cloudy orange mimosa-like appearance. On the taste the tartness of the orange hits first followed by classic sweeter orange flavor then all followed by a slightly bitter hoppiness that clears out the orange. Unique indeed, for what it is it is spot on. This would be a great brew on a hot day ice cold or good on a cold winter day at room temperature. Do I dare say it may even make a good hot toddy? Maybe have to try it and see. Was hesitant to try this due to bad experiences with lambrics but orange seems to compliment this brew well."

"O - Not a good beer. I enjoy the Summer Shandy from time to time, but this isnt working."

"a recreation of their famous lemon shandy, this orange brew lacks the refreshment and easy of consumption that the lemon one has, and seems a little out of season in the winter now, but still isn't a bad brew. it just looks like a light wheat beer, with a pretty decent head on it that doesn't last. the nose is orange heavy, not artificial either, but fresh and pulpy. the fruit part smells nice, but in combination with beer ingredients, it gets a little funny and smells like the base of a barbeque sauce or something. it taste also very orange forward, like carbonated fresh orange juice. I like the freshness of the fruit, but it overpowers any grain or hops and results in a beverage that may refresh some, but falls short of tasting like beer to me, and that's a problem. again, no off flavors here, just too much fruit to still be beer. I really do like the lemon shandy, I think the lemon flavors blend better with the lager, but this one is out of balance. light bodied and well carbonated, a drinkable brew, perhaps better suited for hot weather than pre-thanksgiving frost. maybe I will revisit this in the summer, maybe not."
""
""
"This is pretty gross really. The lemon shandy has some redeeming qualities, but this one is just too overboard on the artificial citrus juices. Mouthfeel is slick and overcarbed. Just not really refreshing and too much orange zest flavors."
""
""
"O: If you're trying to watch your figure and need something light to go with a low calorie snack, this beer works. Other than that, it's pretty average on all accounts."
" The taste is like a mix of orange soda and light beer, pretty much what you see is what you get...not a bad flavor actually it is refreshing and could serve as a palate refresher if sampling heavy or high gravity beers perhaps. I would say give it a try."
"Overall: I approve."
""
""
""
"The pride of Chippewa Falls in a brown bottle. Immediate orange zest syrup bitter flavor accompanies a light body and soft carbonation. Reminds me of a beach barbecue in southern California. Barely detectable hops with a light malt backdrop. 4.2% alcohol makes it very drinkable. A simple beer; I could enjoy one or two on a warm summer afternoon outdoors but overall very average and forgettable."
"Overall - This is what I expect out of a fruit beer, since a lot of fruit beers are just regular beers with fruit flavor. While I am more of a hops guy, I enjoyed this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite low alcohol beer (under 5% is low to me). It's very ""orangey"" but the label should give you some hints of that! It's a great flavor and not too strong tasting. Would be one I'd reccommend for new beer drinkers!!!! :)"

"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
"A big shout out to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a cloudy whiteish/yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by oranges. Taste is a bit tart, lots of oranges, some wheat, very easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and overall would be a good beer on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
"It is a very smooth and surprisingly crisp beer for one released in the Fall, and I really enjoy beers like this. The hazy color seemed to blend perfectly into the spirit of fall, but the flavor seems out of place for the season. It's something- that if it really is only available this time of year- that I would advise hanging on to until spring. Other than that, it's a fantastic drink, and one I know I'll be having plenty more of."
"Got this in the winter sampler pack. Not sure what this is doing in the winter sampler. Seems more like a summer beer. Drank out of the bottle didn't have a glass available. Looked kinda hazy orange when I looked in the bottle. Smell was very strong of orange. When I took my first drink, I thought I was drinking a generic orange soda. Way to strong on the orange taste. The mouthfeel was odd. I felt like I had coated my mouth with sugar. Overall, just not a beer for me. Maybe if it was 100 degrees outside and I was craving something orange, but I think I would just go with a soda instead."

"O: Tickers gonna tick, amirite?"
""
""
"O: Not tasty at all, does not go down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, not the best representation of style. Even for a shandy, this is not a good beer in any respect."
""
"Thin bodied, somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Average carbonation. Just a bad beer. I have never liked a beer with artificial flavor, and that's about all this beer has. Avoid."

"Overall Drinkability: Like I said, this is a bit summery for a fall release. A little more yeast and body and a little less orange, and this is Blue Moon."

""
""

"Overall – A sweeter and rather refreshing summer brew. It kind of tastes like a blend of lemonade, orange juice and beer. While not quite appropriate for winter style drinking (at least not up north) it is a decent sweet summer style refreshing brew."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink. I liked how it wasn't sweet and didn't seem watery."
""
""
"O: Having never had a shandy, I didn't really know what to expect. I have had fruity beers and enjoyed them so this seemed like a perfect choice for a hot, unautumnlike October night. The smell and the taste don't match: it tastes much less orangey than it smells. I enjoyed this beer tonight, but can't say I'd get it again because I rarely crave beer like this."
""
"As far as fruity shandies go, this isn't great, but it is above average. A nice fruity, something different drink to have on a hot day."
""
"O - not terrible, but definitely all orange and not much else going on here."
""
""
""

"Overall, this is a fun beer for a warm day, but the acidity could be too much for me to session more than one or two. This could be a nice pallet cleanser in the middle of a session, though."
"Leinenkugel's Orange Shandy ---3/5."
"This pours a cloudy, yellow/orange color with a slight, white head. The aroma has wheat mixed with orange zest. The flavor is pretty much what you would expect, an orange version of Summer Shandy. The texture is a little too thin and the flavor doesn't exactly wow me either. I do like oranges more than lemons though if I had to choose. However Buffalo Bill's Orange Cream is still a better option if they still have it in your area."

"Bought in a 12-bottle Autumn Variety Pack that just came out on 8/1. Sampled 8/2/13 after chilling in my beer cooler to 36 degrees. Pours a hazy orange/yellow in color with a 2-finger white head. Some lacing is seen but not much. The aroma is pleasant with orange and grains with a hint of spice. The taste was really good and is the same as the smell. Perfect carbonation and goes down very easy. No bad aftertaste and was refreshing. Great summer brew. Overall, really liked this one."
""
""
"Overall: I would probably put this in the middle of the three shandy's I have had from Leinies..Not as good as the lemon berry one. Not offensive, but there are other fruit beers I would try first."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy orange yellow with a small white head that dissipates very quickly. Smells of orange very strongly, almost like orange dreamscile, however with a slight hint of cereal grain. Tastes of orange, much more natural than the smell, and grain, not much different than other shandys. Beer is sessionable, light bodied, going down smooth, carbonated perfectly. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
"O- Orange flavored summer wheat beer, ok at that."
"Orange Shandy pours a hazy yellow/orangeish color with a nice small long lasting lacing head. There is a orange aroma that is similar to orange hand soap. The taste is similar to soap with small orange notes, but has a barely noticeable malty and wheat like backbone. A bit watery, which may be a good thing, if the flavors would be any stronger it would be undrinkable. Overall its a drinkable beer on a hot summers BBQ day, but don't expect anything to great."
""
""
""
"I will say, it was refreshing at the lake over July 4th weekend. But I won't buy it again. . . I like beer."

"Overall I thought this beer was pretty mediocre and a slightly below average example of the style, the orange tang aspect was just too overpowering and it stuck out a little too much, I would rather have a more natural orange flavor. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth and a little refreshing, but the flavors really didn't hold my attention, so I don't think I would want to session this beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it's a decent looking Shandy. What I like the least about this beer the orange tang aspect, It would be better with a more natural orange flavor. I wouldn't by the beer on it's own, I would rather have Summer Shandy or Lemon Berry Shandy and I wouldn't really recommend this beer. All in all this was my least favorite of Leinenkugel's three Shandys, with Summer Shandy being my favorite, I appreciate the attempt, but this one just didn't work for me, better luck next time guys."
""
"Overall - Maybe orange and beer just don't go together well? In any event, this one clearly isn't working too well. It comes off as artificial and simply doesn't taste that great."
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer was surprisingly OK. Not bad, not great, just an ""as expected"" beer from Leinenkugel. I feel like a lot of people rip on this company cause it's a macro, and a lot of people praise it cause they have no palate for beer. If it were cheaper, I'd buy it. Until then, I'll stick to my cheap-ass Steigl Radler for a light fruity brew. If you like grapefruit and fruity beer, check it out, only 89 cents for a pint can at my local craft store!"
"My Crack and inverted Glug produced but a momentary head of fizzy, eggshell-white head with decidedly low retention. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow, much like freshly-squeezed orange or grapefruit juice. Nose smelled artificially of orange and when I closed my eyes, I thought back to Tang, which is what the astronauts drank once upon a time. In the here and now, it had a thin mouthfeel, but quite effervescent. It tasted like a liquified Dreamsicle and I felt like a little kid again. I used to love both Tang and Dreamsicles, but now it seemed cloyingly sweet. Finish was likewise very sweet and I began to wonder who I would share this with. It would not be my current Old Lady as she would laugh at me for drinking such a beverage. It should be shared, though, as it is too sweet for me by myself."
"Poured into a red Solo cup (wooo!), a somewhat cloudy yellow-orange color with a large fizzy white head that soon died down to a wispy layer of bubbles, with soda-like carbonation rising from the bottom. Aroma of orange candy and light stinky grains. Tasted like orange drink and seltzer, with some stale malts in the background. Not that I expected much, but whatever. Consistency of water, but goes down like it too, so at least there's that. Chicks might dig this, but not me. Plenty of other much better summertime quenchers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As I sit here sucking down the last few cans of this monstrosity (the eight Summer and Lemon Berry varieties at least got me buzzed enough to tolerate it), I can only say this... NEVER AGAIN. Eff you Leinenkugels for violating my taste buds in such a horrible way. Bottom line, this beer tastes like failure. Stay away."
""
""
""
""
""
"That being said is it a craft brew that we should pick apart and take down.... nope it fits a solid niche and it fits it well."
""
"Eh. What did I expect? Not a lot. And because of that, I wasn't really let down. In fact, I enjoyed this one much more than Summer Shandy and I'm sure this would prove to be extremely quaffable on a hot summer day."
