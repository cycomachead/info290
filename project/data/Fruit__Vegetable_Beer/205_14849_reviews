"One of the worst beers IMO."

"Dee-lish! These go down so smooth. And so yummy. Would make a great summer session."

"Different. A - Yellow gold in color. Light lacing. S - very strong orange with maybe a splash of vanilla. T - strong orange taste, almost like orange crush soda. Hit of wonder bread in there. M - thin and bitter. A bite in the back of the throat. O - smelled delicious and went in with high hopes. Couldn't let it sit in the mouth very long, a little too sweet I think."
"I would say this is a good summer beer. Slightly sweet but doable. Refreshing, but sort of bitter. It's smells like a creamsicle with a dry orange peely taste. I could see myself drinking this beer, but I would prefer a shandy. This just simply comes down to preference. When it comes down to a fruity beer I would prefer a lemon to an orange. Overall a good beer, just not something I would buy a lot of."

"Kind of mediocre, not terrible, but watery and artificial tasting. Not so bad that I regret having it, but there's no real reason to have this."
"o: I like this one. It's not too complicated to enjoy, but is different enough to be distinguished from a lot of the other summer offerings. They took a rather oddball flavour idea and made something pleasant out of it, unlike some of the other oddball flavours I've tried this year. If I can get it regularly this will be one of my summer favourites."

"Aroma is a perfumey orange-water scent. Rather sweet. Well, quite sweet, for a light beer. Not exactly malty. Quite fruity and bitter-tart, just like oranges with the peel. It's actually not a bad orange flavor. There is just something too much like candy about this. I would not want to drink a pint, but it's hard to fault the general beeriness of it. Let's hope they never make a malt liquor based on this stuff. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Ralph's supermarket in San Clemente."

"Pours a hazy light orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, orange zest, and yeast. There is a slight vomit-like smell that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is much the same with yeast and citrusy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that drinks better cold and gets worse as it warms up."
""
"O- It doesn't Smell like beer, it doesn't taste like beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy light yellow-gold with a big white head consisting of large bubbles that dissipate down to nothing. Aroma is light orange (like orange blossom scented soap) and mineral water. Taste comes across as fizzy orange flavored mineral water. Almost soda-like but the flavor is muted and a bit soapy. Not bad but I will not seek this out. Not much beer taste going on here."
"Overall - This beer sounded interesting and that's why I tried it. But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
""
"Found this brew in a sample pack from WM. Crisp, amazing nose. The orange is present, but not dominant...follows up at the end for a nice finish! Have only tasted a handfull of times but had to put in a special order for when Lent is over...what the hell was I thinking, giving up beer?"

"O- I can see what they are going for here, the orange cream taste, although artificial tasting, isn't that bad. I just see no traces of beer flavors. This is something my wife would probably like, but not something I would seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of, if not the, worst tasting beer I've ever had. My words don't accurately describe my revulsion. A total drain pour. Avoid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall an unremarkable beer. Certainly not bad, but not worth having again either. Won't seek out, and would drink again, but I'd definitely look for something better first."
""
""
"Overall I was thinking this would be fun, and I like to cut loose once in awhile, but boy this is so watered down and flattened it's like drinking watered down tang and/or orange Kool-Aid. It doesn't even taste like beer, and it doesn't even deliver from what is sensed on the nose at all. It says brewed with natural flavor, could have fooled me tastes anything but."
""
"Poured out a hazy golden color with a faint fizz rim and a very strong hybrid aroma of orange crush soda and yeasty dough with just a smidge of vanilla aroma in the background. Not really sure I dig the smell of bread crammed into orange soda...its the yeast smell in particular that seems to clash. The flavor and texture resembles a thinner wheat beer with a significant 'cooked' sort of canned / vegetal orange flavor which also clashes for my palate against the base beer. At least the carbonation is adequate, unfortunately the body is too thin and watery. I probably won't be visiting this one ever again, not a real fan of it. Not a -horrible- beer, but definitely somewhat worse than mediocre."
"Served from bottle into a Sweetwater snifter. Poured a golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount instantly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, orange, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, orange, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. Nothing really stood out on this one at all for me from other brews of the same style. There are so many good brews in this style, it would be hard to do so, but this one felt like it didn't even make an effort. Yes, the orange was there. Yes, the cream was there. But that's it? I guess you can't win them all. Glad I got the chance to tick it, but doubt I would go out of my way to do so again."
""
""
"I mean, this was just okay. There isn't anything disgusting about it, I was able to finish the glass. As it warmed though this started to turn for the worse. Nothing I'd reach for again but if you want an extremely orange-forward beer, this would be one to try."
"Has a slight creamy mouth feel with nice orange notes (not too overwhelming or sweet) and a lively carbonation. This a very easy drinking beer that overall falls a little flat - not bad, but not exciting. It becomes a little too sweet mid way through and needs some bitterness to rein it in."
""
""
"This beer is so thin that you could drink it very easily, but the flavor keeps me from returning to it."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tall pint glass. Pours a cloudy straw with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of orange soda, not what i am expecting of a beer. Tastes of bland grain with some fake orange flavor, not really that great. The beer is quite fizzy for its light body, although it finishes well. Overall, a below average beer."
"overall: drinkable, but like cream ales in-general, you like them or you don't, in this case, the orange could sway you one way or the other depending on your palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really, not too bad a beer, but isn't much better than a Stella or Blue Moon, and has the misfortune of costing more. Either go for a cheaper macrobrew or find a better comparably priced APA, which should be easy. Either way, pass on this one."

"O: A very inconsistent beer. I've had worse fruit beers, but I've definitely had better."
""
""
""
""
""
"a clear orange yellow pour with a slight amount of head which quickly diminished. smells of bayer children's aspirin/tic-tac orange flavoring. tastes like said aspirin dropped in seltzer, and wheat bread. light bodied, mildly carbonated. this is a decent fruit beer.. a lot like orange flavored seltzer honestly. which i like, but not in a beer."
"overall, this isn't a bad beer, it just is fairly forgettable and more or less unimpressive. this beer kind of defines the phrase: ""it is what it is."""
""
""
""
"Overall, I rather enjoyed this beer. It's definitely something different, and that, to me, is always welcome in this business. It is a super light and refreshing beer that has me welcoming the summers heat. It's nice to see a spring/summer time beer that can be refreshing but doesn't fall back on the old standby; citrus."
""
"O: Not much changes from first sniff to final drop."
""
""
"O- I wouldn't mind drinking this if it was the only decent thing to choose from on a hot summer day but, otherwise, this is not a good beer. Not as ridiculous of a fruit bomb as Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat but that's not saying much."

"Pours a clear yellow with a big white head. Smell is of orange peel; hard to tell it's a beer! The taste begins with a bitter orange peel start, followed by a burst of citrus sweetness that fades away quickly into nothingness. A bit of yeast character in there. Light mouthfeel, carbonation is too high. Overall an ok beer. Interesting but I doubt I will get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think that I'll stick to cooking with this one."
"Overall Drinkability - Great light refreshing beer. Interesting and unorthodox, offering a decent amount of complexity despite its lightness."
"O: Overall I thought the beer was an interesting and unique ale. The orange/citrus/lemon flavor was done pretty well, but isnt the beer flavors that I enjoy the most. I'd still recommend trying it, just because you dont see these flavors done often with beer."
"I tasted it while standing over the sink, but was drawn back to the recliner by the pleasant surprise. A light orange, honey taste pleases the mouth. Is it great? No. But it begs for another sip."
"This one pours a very light and watery bright, bright gold in color with a slight white lacing that quickly died. It smells of a diet orange soda, plain and simple. It may smell somewhat artificial but it is appealing, mostly because of the spritzy sweetness. The flavor is fresh fruity, floral, and it has some light honey as well. It again is heavy on the diet soda. It drinks watery and very light. It's probably one of the lightest beers around. Overall this is a solid cream ale but a little artifical. Girls would like this."
"D: A little flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a typical lighter fruity beer."
"Overall this is a decent beer. I almost cringe when I see screwtops but the beer was definitely drinkable and enjoyable."
"Pours a clear gold with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly, leaving just the slightest of haze. Aromas of orange cream coda and perhaps a bit of sweet malt. Ugh. Yeah, this tastes like an orange cream soda with a touch of toasted malt. Thin body with prickly carbonation. This is nasty, basically an orange soda. Avoid."
"Hazy gold with a small white head which lasted about 30 seconds leaving a small ring. No lacing so far. Smell is orange and citrus oils. Taste is sweet and slightly bitter from the modest hopping. Malts are plentiful and slightly grainy. A good cream ale base that is enhanced (or ruined) by the generous orange citrus flavors. The label says ""ale brewed with honey, orange peel, natural flavors, and orange flower extract added"". I think I can taste them all. Mouthfeel is fine for a cream ale perhaps a bit overly carbonated. Overall an interesting beer and well crafted for what it is. This beer is brewed by Pyramid Brewing Co. for Buffalo Bill's Brewery somewhere on the West Coast. A tasty and refreshing summer beer though probably one would be enough."
"O - Here's the tricky part. As pedestrian as it is, the alluring, sweet orange blossom scent is such a very arresting quality that, I think, it was responsible for my enjoying this brew more than it perhaps deserved."
"O: Fairly balanced, easy drinking and refreshing. Simple but to the point. An ""ale brewed with honey and orange peel"" is exactly what you get. These seem highly sessionable but I personally couldn't drink too many of them. The flavors seem like they can get rather cloying after a while. Not bad, not good."
"This beer isn't something that most people would go for... It's too sweet for most beer lovers I'd say. However I was to say that I like it. The pour is a little boring, fizzy white head with a near clear yellow body. Typical look to this beer. The smell has a lot of orange on the nose. The taste is creamy orange with just some malt in the background. The mouthfeel is light, kind of airy and smooth. Overall this beer was ok in my eyes because I like the sweetness from time to time. I'd never want to have a bunch of these at one time but just a starter or finisher would be perfect"
"M - The creaminess was a little off putting. It might be typical of the style - I don't know. But I didn't go for it too much."
"The brothers and I never seem to agree. Oh well. Poured from a bottle a nice orange/gold color, nice thick foamy white head, and nice lacing. Like a brilliant dark bold creamsicle. The taste was exellent, with a nice milky mouthfeel with orange, florals, and nice light grains, wonderful. For me this will become a summer staple."
"o: meh.."
"I've seen this beer countless times at the store, and though it's gotta be better than it sounds. Well, I was wrong; this is more flat soda than it is fruit beer. If malty wine cooler is your thing, give it a try. Otherwise, avoid."
"o - Overall an average beer with some very light nice orange in the nose and taste. A better alternative to BMC products, though I didn't really see it as a fruit/vegetable beer. Wouldn't seek it out again but not awful."
"T: Lots of orange along with some lemon and a bit of grain on the finish. This is labeled a cream ale, but had no evidence of actually being one. The mouthfeel was about as creamy as an original Bud. Not quite what I was hoping for."
"I would recommend this beer for Pabst set that seeks to cheat on their signature hipster beer."
"Good beer to give someone instead of a screwdriver. Without the punch."
"Overall this is an outlier for the fruit beer style as it is overly orange flavored and uses artificial flavoring, that said my wife enjoys it."
"Taste is like what I imagine an orange peel dipped in cheap vanilla ice cream would taste like. I love orange dreamsicles, and comparing this beer to them is doing the frozen treat a disservice! This is thin, pithy, sweet and overly fizzy. Seems like a good idea gone wrong. Glad this was only a single, I would have a tough time finishing a whole sixer of it."
"O- I was very dissapointed in this beer. I wanted to like it. It would make a great introduction to a person just getting into craft beer Starting off with mild bitter flavors, but I can not buy this again."
"Overall a great thirst quencher, with no real bitterness; and mild enough for light meals and deserts or to be savored by itself. Sweet and sophisticated; probably favored by the ladies...!"
"Light, zesty beer good for a hot season."
"D: Overall pretty drinkable, it's a medium abv beer with refreshing orange flavors and not too bitter or sweet. I liked it, nice job."
"O - Good summer drinker."
"Since I'm makin' some pasta, I might as well have a beer, right? This one pours a mostly clear golden straw topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light orange zest, wheat, red apple flesh, very light white grape, and sweet honey. This fruit salad comes off almost fake-ly sweet and fruity, as though I'm smelling some sort of air freshener or something instead of a beer. The taste brings in everything above, along with some sweet flowers and a touch of grass. These new, earthier elements don't really help much. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a fizzy, watery feel. Overall, I cannot say in any way that I am a fan of this beer. It's not necessarily rotten, but it's nowhere near good, either."
"O- has more of a soda flavor than I would expect. Definitely has that artificial creme sicle taste to it. It's not terrible but falls in line with all the other over fruit flavored ales"
"PASS ON THIS!"
"Overall- The one thing that I didn't appreciate was that there was no information or ingredient list on this beer. They just had the Style, Beer Name, Brewer, ABV's, and other useless info on the side. I enjoyed this beer even though it was much different than I thought it would be. Won't be going back to anytime soon and really wouldn't promote this one."
"Doesn't really taste very beer-like, but it served my purpose. It's a good summery beer for the hottest day of the year so far."
"Overall it was ok but I wouldn't want to drink it again."
"Overall meh, its a candy orange soda creamsicle bleh, wouldn't be bad as a mixed drink or something, but not a beer!"
"SAW THIS IN A BEER MAG AT THE GROCER, BOUGHT A SINGLE AT FAMOUS,CLOUDY,ABSOLUTELY NO HEAD(MADE ME SUSPECT), SLIGHT CITRUS ODOR AND A LITTLE YEASTY, LIGHT NON-CARBONATED MOUTH FEEL, ORANGEY MIDDLE MOUTH,MURKY MUNG AT THE BOTTOM, DRANK IT ANYWAY, FRUIT AND BEER, I DON'T GET IT..SPLAIN IT TO ME..."
"Pours crystal clear with thin white soda style head. Nose smells very sweet, like Sunny Delight. Crisp yet watery body. Tastes like Orange and ccream soda. Probably great at a Bbq, but right now its meh."
"pours a golden yellow. I was expecting a cloudier look. The smell is hard to peg. There is deffinately a orangish odor, but there is something else there like other citrus smells. The flavor is pretty good. The tase is a orangish sweetness. There is a strange after taste. Over all I don't love this beer but there is something about it that makes me want to taste others from buffalo bills."
"Overall, not recommended."
"Light gold color with a bubbly head that dissolves right away. Much more a lager in appearance than an ale. Smells of cream, orange candy, and florals. Also has a very orange candy flavor. Honey and floral notes are also noticeable. Not totally unpleasant to drink, providing you only want one. It's way too sweet to take any deeper than that."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, orange citrus and somewhat dry. In the taste, orange citrus and notes of wheat. A small hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a light, dry orange peel in the aftertaste. A bit sweet with some dry clove and honey hints, quite pedestrian."
"O - overall it was a fun drinkable beer, there isn't really a competitor to compare it to so I can safely say its a great ""orange cream soda beer"" and its definitely worth a try."
"Kind of deceptive. I got it hoping for a cream ale, but it's not that at all. It is rather, a basic fruit beer. Pours honey golden with almost no head, a bit fizzy. A taste of nearly sickeningly sweet orange pretty much dominates all. Refreshing, though a bit of a syrupy mouthfeel, as opposed to that of a crisp witbier. Not too bad, but I wouldn't get it again."
"It sounded like an interesting buy, it isn't all that bad. It's a cloudy dishwater colored brew with low carbonation. The aroma is fruity but seems artificial. The taste is like they tried to infuse a heffeweizen with fruit and put more of an emphasis on the fruit. The taste is also seemingly artificial fruit but it's tolerable despite the initial bitterness. It has a light tartness that lingers but stays fairly smooth. It goes good with taco pizza."
"O - this beer is definitely worth a try as it's unlike anything i've really had before, but don't expect it to blow your mind."
"Notes: Interesting beer, not bad or good but interesting. Taste like orange cream soda and not a bad one, but it isn't really what I want in a beer. For what it is, or if you are wanting something like orange cream soda, it is nice, but outside that it's nothing worth getting."
"O: Draino. Very disappointed. Not even close to what I had hoped for."
"Overall this is a decent above average beer that I might drink once in awhile. If you love orange pop this beer is a must try, but for everyone else you might want to skip this one."
"appearance is an orange amber with a very thin dissapating head and no lace. Smell has a zest of orange. Taste reminds me of a very watered down Sunkist orange soda. Mouthfeel is a medium - light with good carbonation. Not bad, refreshing, it's something that would go good on a hot summers eve."
"if you like orange soda this is the beer for you, if not than dont try. not impressed with this drink but glad i tried it."
"Overall, this is not a good beer. Not sure that I would even call it a beer, as it really doesn't taste like any beer that I have ever had. A description of the beer indicated that it tastes like a creamcicle. If that were the case, I think I would somewhat enjoy this beer. Overall, the beer tastes of unbalanced orange water with a bad beer aftertaste."
"O-If served ice cold in sweltering summer heat I guess I can see someone swirling this down, but it won't be us."
"Pretty much novelty beer. Not bad....just not a beer that tastes like a beer."
"Pours a cloudy golen amber with a quick diminishing head. Citrus scents are very evident here. Has a rather strong orange flavor as you'd expect from the name. Finishes will an awkward after tatse/texture that is hard to describe. Definetly has a lot more texture to it than you normal citrus beers like Blue Moon or Bud Golden Wheat which must be where the cream part comes in. Rather drinkable and delicious but also forgetable."
"Pours pale yellow with no real head except thin white around the edges of the drink. Orange cola, honey in the nose; it's a ploy that works. The artificial aroma does invite me in for a sip: orange cola, cream, floral notes, light citrus skins and slight hop dryness towards the finish is covered up by a buttery orange note. Light bodied with light carbonation. A touristy beer, ""Hey, take a picture! I'm drinking craft!"""
"D- this is an ok brew for someone looking for an alternative to craft beer itself. Strangely enough, my girlfriend, who four nights ago said nugget nectar was amazing... Also said this is. So I don't know, maybe this is a good brew for some and most not others"
"D - This beer is easy to consume and would probably be good on a hot day. Tried it as part of a make your own six pack and I am sure if fruit beers are your thing you would probably enjoy a few. I'd have another if someone offered me one but would not purchase again."
"D- This beer looked and sounded interesting but ultimately fell flat IMO. Best part of the beer was its highly carbonated appearance, but thats not saying much. Taste was almost unbearable. Will not look for again."
"Overall this isn't a really good beer should be avoidedk I've never heard of anyone talk about this beer before and now I know why"
"D: Would not pick this up again, but if you like sodas/mixed drinks and are not a beer drinker this could be for you."
"Drinks: like imitation. I have to give it to Buffalo Bill's; the name Orange Blossom Cream Ale pretty perfectly captures the flavors of this brew. But it just doesn't taste REAL, and the synthetic quality becomes grating near the end of the glass. Enjoyable for what it is."
"Taste more like a soda than a beer."
"D- As good as this is, it's more of a dessert beer and I would have one and then move on. With that said, I would like to try this with a mandarin orange Asian salad and some salmon as I think this would be a very good beer to have with this or some sweeter Chinese dish. Give it a try anyways."
"D - Overall I loved the blueberry and sort of liked the pumpkin (not enough spice) but this Buffalo Bill offering seemed lacking. Would pick up a sixer but their really are better beers with not only more flavor but a higher ABV as well and of course taste more like beer. Pass."
"Borderline malternative--the orange cream soda flavor is just too much. And it tastes sort of diet at that. You'd be better served by just buying an orange cream soda and dropping a splash of vodka in it."
"I'm surprised with the low scores on this beer, I really enjoyed drinking this one. At $13 a six pack it was a little pricey, but a nice fresh citrus taste with no off flavors that I can taste. A smooth beer with just the smallest amount of cloudiness. Seems like an awesome beer for drinking in the summer!"
"Drinkability: Fairly poor, taste is reminiscent of orange-flavored vitamin C packs mixed 	in water."
"You could certainly throw back a bunch of these, and it would be easy to convince a Bud Light Lime/Miller Chill to try this as a better-built (but 3 times pricier) alternative."
"I think it's weird that this says it's a winter beer at the top of this page...seems more summer to me (which is why I grabbed it originally). For me, it just seemed a bit too artificial & watered down. Though I'm sure there are worse things I could have used to finish this mixer sixer from Kroger...I think I'd rather go back to the non-alcoholic drink I got at the cash register, Diet Orange Crush, heh."
"This is the first of nine ""summer"" brews in a gift pack I received from my neighbors for letting them use the pool this summer. It was a nice thought - I had never tried eight of the nine."
"Drinkability - It's an interesting flavor. I'd personally like to taste more of the orange peel. Would make for a decent summer ale. Subtle aftertaste makes it easy to come back for more."
"I did not enjoy this beer. The whole time it tasted like I was drinking orange glo cleaner or something."
"D - I have a hard time believing this is a ""winter"" beer. I totally see this is a summer beer because it's highly refreshing, and due to it being slightly watery and only a 5.2% ABV it's very drinkable."
"D: I came home after walking 3 miles in 100 degree weather and cracked one of these opened, served in a pint glass. It was actually very refreshing. From experience, this would be a good drink on a hot summer day."
"This is my first sampling of this style. Whatever the style is supposed to be like I can't say I enjoyed this example of it. Less bitter orange and more richness and sweetness would be my suggestion."
"drinkability pretty low. it's something to drink, but not something a seasoned BA would seek out."
"Ok, based on its label and from the sounds of it, you'd think you'd be in for a unique one of a kind beer. Well... you'd be wrong! This beer is pretty bad. The taste is horrendous, it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, and honestly you could never chug one of these. These 12 oz beers are so bitter, it takes me upwards of up to 20 minutes to drink one beer. ALso, Buffalo Bill's seasonal pumpkin ale is just as bad."
"sort of a clear gold color to it with a puffy head. Smells lusciously of orange. Taste is intensely of wheat and finishes with orange almost like an orange muffin. Goes down smooth and crisp. Pretty drinkable too and low alcohol count which is a plus."
"has a very floral taste with a bitter orange tang. it's too much on the orange peel tho, gives it a soapy flavor.... i'd prefer it to be more citrus juice than peel... it gives it an unpleasant taste up front. The actual form of the ale is pretty good it has alot of depth to it. complex hop flavor within. however like i said too much orange peel makes this unpleasant."
"D: Refreshing and easy to drink. You better like oranges. It just got a bit tiring toward the end."
"D: This is where I simply state that I love to drink this beer. It might not be the manliest or beeriest beverage, but damn is it refreshing and easy to drink. The orange flavor is much more adult than what you might expect: Orange Crush this ain't. This beer is definitely one of my favorite things about summer."
"The bottles I bought were marked 5.2% ABV and were twistys as opposed to the BA photo. Could have something to do with the fact that Pyramid appears to be contract brewing it for the brewpub, or may have acquired the recipe all together. Ah, the old shell game, eh Magic Hat?"
"Overall, this is one of the better fruit beers I've had. Not overly sweet or overloaded with fruit flavor, well balanced. Would pick up a six every now and then in the warmer months and the wife likes it."
"Weak head. Bland yellow color. Smells like Genny Cream with orange flavoring. The orange flavor is nicely done though. Behind there just seems to be a mediocre at best beer, but the orange is the point so it is fairly well done in that regard. Very drinkable especially as a summer refreshment."
"D- Very novel, and nothing offensive. A nice fruit beer."
"Hmmm....I wonder why this has received such a poor reviewing since it is enjoyable and refreshing. In short - the beer pours a light gold with a nice carb uprising and a head that starts foamy and receedes to a thin, lasting coat over the beer. The nose is light orange peel and pilsner. Flavor is slightly lacking although I don't know if I would want much more since if it were any heavier, it would turn me off. This is a summer beer for sure. Mouthfeel is great for what this is, instead of being syrupy it is light and refreshing. I could drink several of these and this beer benefits from not being overdone."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the oranges. It smells a lot like Orange Tang. The flavor is oranges with some light tartness and a little bit of cream. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Thought that this beer was ok, not something I would go out and buy for good beer at least, but good on hot summer days, picnics and get togethers... with especially non beer drinkers."
"I'll never buy it again."
"D: Good for an afternoon in the sun, this brew is not over the top, so put down many is easy. A nice rendition for the style."
"M/D - thin bodied, heavy carbonation. like mentioned before it tasted and felt like i was drinking an all natural orange soda. interesting, but not my thing."
"Drinkability - No thank you!!!"
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. It was a good summer beer and had some nice citrusy flavor to it. I would drink it again."
"The orange blossom cream ale from Buffalo Brewery is an average beer with an average price. It's not overly done and not to complex and the price reflects it. I don't think this beer was created to deliver overly complex flavors and complexity but rather to appeal to a broad spectrum of people to enjoy."
"Drinkability: It's like a less fizzy, less sweet Sunkist Orange Soda but with alcohol. It's okay and refreshing enough to warrant a single bottle, but not really for me."
"D - Great hot weather beer, but the flavor is so pronounced I'm not sure I would be willing to tip 6 of these in a row. I will be going back for a second, so it is not too overpowering."
"It's a very full bodied beer, and I probably wouldn't want more than a few in one sitting."
"Atmosphere is okay. Appearance is pretty average, and the nose is very singular. Flavor is a little synthetic and orange is really the only thing you can taste. Not strongly, but it's a grainy orange... if that makes any sense. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
"D/M: Very crisp beer, easy to drink and not too carbonated. Decent summer beer to give a try."
"D= half-gone and the rest is headed for deep-six down the drain, just not even tolerable for several of us who have tried to struggle with it."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased from Al's of Hampden. Golden beer with 1/4 inch of head that disappears quickly leaving very light lacing. Smells like i just peeled an orange. Disappointingly weak orange taste, with very sweet aftertaste. Smooth and very creamy feel to this one. Did not meet me high expectations I had going in, reminded me of a Coors Light with an Orange squeezed into it, would not recommend."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong, orange cream. Taste is good, lots of orange flavor that finishes with just a touch of bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Buffalo Bill's Orange Blossom Cream Ale is a hazy, pale golden ale with a small, white head that dissipates quickly, but leaves decent lacing. The aroma is strong and perfumy-- orange blossom and sweet orange, candy... like Tang or orange Kool-Aid... and a slight whiff of adjuncts. It has a medium-light body that's very soft and smooth with a crisp finish. It leaves the teeth slightly gritty. It tastes like herbal tea. It's very... orange flavored. At first it seems very sweet, but it gets balanced out with a little bitterness at the finish. The malt flavor tries to stay out of the way, but it tastes a little grainy and a little corny. It's a little over the top, but it's a fun beer and it goes down with little resistance."
"Poured into a Guinness Pint. Head literally disappears after seconds. Smells like beer and orange. Taste kind of watered down. Not as much orange as I was expecting from the other reviews, but it's definitely present. Sweet, kind of like Hi-C at first, then mellows out to a normal beer taste. Thin mouthfeel with decent carbonation. However, if you wanna throw back a bunch this would be an easy beer to do it with. Overall not the worst I've had. Could have been a lot worse."
"I enjoyed this beer. It's light but flavorful and a nice change of pace. The aroma is clearly orange. Even my wife (who isn't an alcohol drinker of any kind) liked the smell. The hops are delicate and the malt subdued but the overall experience is pleasant. The taste follows the nose well, perhaps a bit too sweet, but some orange tartness and emerging creaminess help balance. The mouthfeel is crisp yet also quite smooth. This would make a great session beer for the spring and summer (not sure of the complete availability though)."
"Wouldnt buy this one again. Maybe if I were hosting a party for college girls."
"I got too much of an 'Orange Slice' taste and smell from this brew. I think a little more body, a little less carbonation, would not only improve on the taste and feel, but also might cut back on the overwhelming smell of oranges."
"Extremely light and overly carbonated. It feels like a wine spritzer. Extremely disappointing brew. Pretty much tastes like natural light meets orange crush to me."
"Pours a pale orange color, some gold-like hilights. Slightly off white head, chunky foam to start, then down to a thin cap, uneven lacing on the glass. Some orange or citrus aroma, kind of sugary sweet, no hops or other smells detected. Flavor has some more citrus, orange peel, more on the sweet side (sugary sweet rather than malt sweetness). Body is light, quite carbonated. Slight oily mouthfeel. Interesting cocept, was expecting fuller body and mouthfeel (cream ale), but the 'orange blossom' was apparent."
"maybe two, but no more."
"Overall, one of the better beers I've had. Not something I could drink a bunch of in one sitting, but it's pleasant, different, refreshing."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a mini snifter. Vibrant orange with about 2 inches of head. Lots of small carbonated bubbles. Tastes like orange sunkist orange soda. No real ale flavor profile to report here. Major disappointment. I suppose this would be highly chugable on a hot day. Other than that I would stay away."
"Appears a pale orange tinted gold with a nice vibrant semi clear body, with slightly off white thick chunky head, some thin uneven lacing sticks around as it dwindles. Aromatics give off strong orange peel some sugar coated notes as well with the citrus outweighing any evidence of minimal hops utilitized. Smells of oxiclean orange scented products of info merical heyday, with a floral herbal note in the background. Flavor wise the strong herbal tea leafiness with the citrus (orange peel additions) with a light creamed corn sweetness are evident. It's been around a long time, so somebody is drinking it but definitely not a regular for my dbf. Mouthfeel is light and lively on the palate with a slight oily texture from the orange peels, finish is somewhat medicinal but I'll take that. Drinkability overall isn't great I'd much rather drink a pils if I'm going for a lighter beer or a well done hefe weizen versus this style."
"Drinkable to a degree. Nice one, but two may be pushing it."
"D: Ok this is a hard one.... It is not like beer at all... More like a wine cooler... the aftertaste is very wine cooler like.... You could drink a load of these, but why would you if your looking for beer."
"D - This is a hybrid between an adjunct lager and a fruity malt beverage... If you're looking for some fizzy, sugary orange juice-beer, this is it. A half drainpour."
"Essentially, in case the point wasn't made, this is an unsweetened orange soda. It's almost an orange tea in seltzer. A sympathetic rater could give this an okay score, but a beer purist will not. I suppose I'm somewhere in between."
"Drinkability - Not an overpowering alcohol taste, but you definitely know it's there. Wouldn't really drink this one again, I was expecting a more pleasant orange taste, but it tasted more like orange pop mixed into a beer."
"D: defiantly worth a try, good as a dessert"
"The ""orange"" flavor simply doesn't taste natural, and there are absolutely no other ""beer"" elements involved in the taste (hops, barley, yeast, etc.) to really satisfy as a beer."
"Overall, a decent orangey brew here. Would I have more than one, probably not."
"I tried this beer with a bit of apprehension, it came as part of a set of ""summer brews"" I found at the World Market Center. Any beer that lists a fruit normally keeps me away, so I was kind of surprised this one wasn't that bad. While the beer had a orange beer/soda look to it, I was surprised it didn't have a real orange smell to it. It didn't have a big orange taste either. It did have a kind of fizzy quality to it when drinking, but mostly a crisp easy to drink beer. While I may never go out of my way to purchase a 6 pack, if handed one I'd drink it."
"Overall this beer reminds me more of a really good soda. Different and worth trying, but I am glad I only bought one."
"D - Between the harsh soda-like carbonation bite and the citrusy zest, it's a good summer beer for anyone that likes Berry Weiss. I thought I'd finish it but when it came to the last two gulps I asked myself, ""why bother?"""
"Drinks pretty well, sometimes the spice makes it rough in spots."
"D: I can't do it. I enjoy cream ales. I enjoy oranges. But, not the rind. Debating whether or not to give it the dump, and move on."
"Not the first cream ale I've had, but certainly not the best. Color is murky and light orange. Smell and taste a bit muddled together, with some vanilla bean and yeasty orange, with a soda-like carbonation. Very light and way too sweet. Does not finish particularly well."
" William of Bama"
"I just can't do this one. It is pure orange juice beer. It is like if there was a ""Mike's Hard Orange Juice," this is exactly what it tastes like. Pass."
"Drink ability is actually above average. Its not a beer i would normally buy but I wouldnt turn one down"
"i would never buy this again nor should anyone"
"I don't get any ""cream"" feeling from it, and its taste is actually good from a beverage point of view. From a beer point of view, it falls short. Not many characteristics of beer here. Good for people who hate beer though. And if that is what its there for, well, it lives up to that standard."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, pale straw color with a thin, almost non-existent head. The smell is of orange (duh) and grainy malt. Reminds me of a Zima. The taste follows suit, orange malt beverage flavor with no real beer taste and a slightly bitter citrusy finish. The mouthfeel is thin and watery, minimal carbonation. This is a relatively easy to drink ""beer"" due to the watery-ness and lack of carbonation. I was hoping for more of a ""cream ale"" as it is advertised, but ended up with a Zima-like brew. Could be decent on a very hot day where I didn't have anything better around."
"I was told this Beer was better than Oberon but I have to disagree. This is not a bad beer but there isnt much flavor in it at all. It kind of tastes like Soda Water with an orange twist. I also do not really taste the Cream in it. It's not bad, just so-so."
"I won't be buying this beer again, but it wasn't that bad. Would be pretty refreshing on a hot day."
"The taste is flowery orange, tangy, with most good, biscuity light malt in the finish. The palate is light and lively. It's a bit different, but rather thin in feel and chracter, and not something I'd normally want."
"D- I suppose it could be considered refreshing and drinkable. This beer really does have potential. The fact of the matter is that they just missed the balance between fruit and beer. I understand you have to judge in regard to style, but this one was a little too agressive with the fruit, and needs to remember to put some of the beer element in fruit beer."
"Drinability of this is poor, I'll see if it grows on me as I finish, but definitely don't think i'll even want another one."
"Notes from: 07/15/04."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink considering its a light bodied orange soda tasting beer."
"Nikki"
"It has a light off white head and lace with an orange tint. The body is an orange, bronze and amber color. It has little bit of fizz and a lot of head that dissipated quickly into a nice head. It has a citrus liqueur smell to it. It kind of reminded me of one of those orange scented cleaners. It has a tangy citrusy flavor but not as overdone as I thought. It is sweet and has fruit loop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fizzy and thin."
"M/D - I think this one was too carbonated which made it even less enjoyable for me. I don't think I made it through the glass."
"D: Interesting but nothing that I'd seek out (or even use as a last resort)."
"Overall, did not enjoy this. Its not a horrible flavor, but it just doesnt taste like beer to me. wont ever get it again."
"D: It's pretty refreshing and is a decent beer for people that don't like beer. Good for a summer picnic to just down to beat the heat."
"d: this is not beer. this is candy. a unique offering that offers a good changeup when in the proper mood."
"The first Buffalo Bill beer I had was the Blueberry Oatmeal Stout, which I found to be quite good. While this one did not really achieve my expectations, it will not hinder me from still searching out the Buffalo Bill brews in the future."
"Could be a nice desert pairing."
"This is one shockingly good beer that is definitely out of the ordinary. Pours a dark yellow/gold with an orange tint. Decent head and good carbonation. The aroma is sweet and fruity, no mistaken that orange is involved here. Feels creamy and full on the palate and finishes with a wonderful taste of orange. Very smooth and creamy halfway through this one I had to reassure myself that I was drinking a beer. Absolutely different which is what makes this one a really good experience."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a small head on a light yellow body. Holy orange, it's all orange, all the time for the nose. Of course, that's the prominent taste as well, but it seemed to not be ridiculously so. Actually pretty nice. Despite the small head, it came across as a bit fizzy. A nice hot summer day drink, despite the obvious orange domination...it was fairly well balanced."
"D: You can drink it, but it is a macro alternative at best. At the price, may have to buy some macro instead. Really wanted more from this beer."
"D: The sweetness is a bit intense for me, especially when coupled with the nasty grain flavor. The last 1/3 resulted in a drain pour, but I could see how this could go down very easily for someone who's into this kind of beer (or ""etc""), but I won't be drinking it again."
"Poured a very light yellow color, almost reminiscent of a wit or hefe, with a small head that disappeared quite rapidly leaving behind no lacing as I drink it down. Aroma is.... ORANGE. Taste is, well, orangey. A bit like a shandy, only with orange-ade mixed in rather than lemonade. Creamy on the palate, average carbonation, and somewhat refreshing. At least it took away the awful aftertaste of the last beer I had (Rogue I2PA)"
"'Nuff Said!"
"This is more of an orange soda type of beverage that an ale. I might have liked it more as a teenager."
"This beer actually made me nauseous..."
"Somewhat muddy golden color. Big floral aroma-just like what an orange blossom might smell like! A mix of orange with an incense kind of aroma. Slight peppery smell. Maly enough flavor with a slight hop bite though the perfuminess of the aroma comes through a tad much. Orange flavor with a mild honey taste. Again with a peppery note-wit beer on steroids? moderate amount of mouthfeel. Definately a drinkable beer. The perfumey and floral get to be a bit too much. Hot weather beer for sure."
"D: I did not finish the beer, don't think I'll be having again. I generally enjoy fruit beers but can't say I enjoyed this one."
"D- fruit beers aren't my favorite style, but orange blossom is my favorite variety of honey so i had to give this a try. i've had some terrible fruit beers and i've had some OK fruit beers, but my mind's eye still imagines something quintessential that i have yet to taste. that being said, bill's orange blossom cream ale is a pretty decent brew, mostly because they've highlighted the floral essence of the orange rather than the plain fruitiness of the juice. still- sweet, sugary, gave me a headache."
"Like many of the other reviews here, the aroma from this was not exactly beer-like, but enjoyable nevertheless --very orange. There was almost no head to this beer. I think I may have liked it a bit more had the taste been a bit less fruity. I like the fruit as an undertone to the beer, but there wasn't a trace of hops in this. I might try it again, but not in a hurry. It's a good summer sort of brew, I guess, but I wouldn't be able to drink more than one probably."
"Appearance-wise, this may as will be macro swill. It had about as much head as your average ginger ale, and it lasted just as long, which is to say not at all. Carbonation was very large bubbled and overall this looked more like cream soda than ale. The aroma is the best part, as it really does smell like orange blossoms and honey. The flavor is similar, all orange and honey but the beer is poorly balanced, no hops to be detected and pretty weak malt as well. The result is a cloyingly sweet, flowery inital sip followed by a bland, bready aftertaste. I'd rather let this one sit in the glass and smell it instead of drinking it."
"D - anyone could drink it all day... if they like Sunkist!"
"D: In fact I did kinda like the quirkiness of this beer, its charms did wear off on me just a little. Despite an overtly 'ORANGE' aroma (yikes!), this did have some flavors and mouthfeel that I enjoyed. I could have this again if my arm was twisted, and I'll bet it could be pretty tasty on a warm day."
"This brew poured a bright straw hued gold with a slight haze. I was able to produce a decent bright white effervescent head with the pour, but in less than a minute it dissipated to nothing more than a thin ring about the edge of the glass. No lacing was left as I sip this down. The beer has a strong aroma of sweet candied orange and honey with soft floral notes...somewhat sweet but not bad at all. The first sip shows a beer with a very light body which is suprisingly refreshing. The highly carbonated brew's flavor is dominated by orange and floral flavors with tones of crisp honey. There is very little malt or hop character apparent in this brew...very light body and almost no bitterness. Flavor leads from floral orange to slight residual sweetness, but is matched by alcohol and maybe just enough hops to cover sweetness as the brew finishes pretty clean, but with no bitterness/drying. Overall, not offensive by any means but also not impressive. Clean, crisp, refreshing, yet also thin, fizzy, and artificial, this brew has decent drinkabilty but is lackluster in depth of flavor and body."
"Drinkable for people who hate beer and love soda. All others: avoid. I love cream soda, and an orange cream soda/creamsicle flavor can be fantastic. I would even welcome a beer that could pull it off, but this really can't, and doesn't."
"Worth a shot because of its unique factors, but nothing above and beyond..."
"Poured an orangish gold with a slight head that faded rather quickly. Smells are kind of floral with orange and spices. Slick mouthfeel that has a carbonated orange drink at first then lends to almost a creamy feeling. Maybe a slight hop bitterness on the aftertaste. I think I would pass on this one if I ever came acrossed it again."
"Highly carbonated, but slightly thin. Worth trying for the experience."
"Maybe this would work if I loved orange soda-pop more. This is almost as bad as their pumpkin ale (though not quite), not as good as their blueberry oatmeal stout (not that that's saying much). Does this even qualify as beer?"
"Notes: One of the worst beers I've had to date."
"EDIT: Came back to read my old review after snagging one of my wife's stash of this- it truly is an ORANGE CREAMSICLE in a glass."
"A bit of a funky aftertaste, but I'd drink another."
"D: Drank like a fizzy wine cooler, loaded with carbonation which distracted away from the smooth nature of a true cream ale. The smell as well the flavor seemed over the top artifical and once again distracted from the enjoyment of this drink. Pass."
"Overall - it's unremarkable in appearance, it has light mouthfeel, but smells and tastes great - and on a hot summer day, the light, slightly sweet brew is JUST what the doctor ordered. Have one or four outside... grab a badminton racquet!"
"Picked a bottle up from a friend and tried it during a tasting with some friends. This beer is the complete opposite of the styles I prefer, but it was worth a try. Pours a hazy shade of orange with one finger white head. Lots of carbonation in this cream ale. It has a light orange aroma with a few hints of hops. Sweet tasting, almost like an orange soda. It's really not that bad and might be better in the summer months."
"I would recommend this only to people who drink wine coolers and/or don't particularly like the taste of alcohol. It does have a pretty label though."
"Light medium clearish orange pour with white short lived head. Nice orange smell with light spice/metallic notes as well. Flavor is of arange, and body is highly carbonated. Lightly flavored overall, but the orange is quite noticeable. Prickly mouthfeel, and a bit boring overall"
"Overall drinkability is not that good. After half a bottle, I've had more than enough to quench my curiousity, but not my thirst."
"Drinkability: It resembles a beer mixed with an orange soda. Ok for a try, but not a home run."
"Other: If you want to make something along these lines homebrew wise you need orange blossom honey. From Cali would be best."
"Notes: An okay offering that's light and refreshing. Remember, you're getting a fruit-dominant beer."
"The orange blossom pours a golden color with little or no foam head to it. It had to freshness date I could find. The smell was the best part of this beer. The orange zest really came through. In the taste you had the initial orange flavor followed by the semblance of cream. In the mouth it was very thin and didn't do much of any dance in there. This would be a good summer beer."
"Drinkability: Easily quaffable, smooth and very sessionable."
"For my money the most refreshing beer to drink on a hot day. It would have to be 90-degrees, when a beer is almost a chore, but its so tasty when drinking it in high heat. Maybe a bit sweet at room temperature. Try it when its ungodly hot outside, you won't be sorry."
"Pours out to a crystal clear deep copper, forming a small white head with no discernable retention or lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The nose is intensely aromatic, full of over-ripe oranges and rotting orange peel/ Very nice nose, cleanly fermented. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean with a medium-light body. The taste begins with an intense orange expression, lots of juice and oil here, followed by some domestic macro-lager corn-like middle, a hint of malt husk, a moderate sweetness, very mild bitterness and a lightly ruddy finish. Sweet, but not cloying, this is like an orange Fanta meets Corona. This is refreshing, and I ended up buying a sixer of the stuff cause it goes down nice during the summer and is a refreshing change of pace. Not too shabby! Probably the best I've had for the style."
"Decent drinkabilaty, the sweetness and orange flovor could get overpowering after two."
"Pours a medium golden color with some orange highlights. Very short-lived off-white head that leaves the thinnest collar. Some streamers of carbonation, but not many. Faint honeyed-malt character in the aroma with an Orange Crush or Sunkist orange soda aroma to it as well. I can't help but describe the aroma further as being that of a bottle of Flinstone's crewable vitamins. Body is thin with orange flavoring and a watery presence amidst some generic, nondescript malt sweetness. Faint suggestions of orange blossom, but you really have to search your tastebuds for it. A nice bit of orange rind tartness in the finish is about a positive of a spin I can think of for this beer. Not entirely pleasant, but not repulsive either. Carbonation is dull, which is a shame because a smooth, creamy texture to the carbonation could have fared this ale nicely. If you really like oranges, I'd give it a shot, but if you are indifferent about them like I am, I think you could live your life without being disappointed that you never got to try Buffalo Bill's Orange Blossom Cream Ale."
"D: I did not enjoy it, but I could see it as an easy session beer; Low alcohol, light mouthfeel and somewhat clean finish. Perhaps after a few I could enjoy the brew as I adjust to the flavor."
"Pours light copper with a bit of a gold tone. Small, bubbly white head; droopy arcs of lacing do not last. Aroma is reminiscent of Airborne or Emergen-C with a thin malty undertone. Mouthfeel is light bodied with fizzy carbonation like seltzer water. Flavor is flat and lightly sweet, watery-orangey with no real depth of character. Malts play out in the background with a pale character; notes of honey here and there. Taste of corn shows through, particularly in the finish. Aftertaste is stale and sweetish."
"I acquired this on a whim at Friendly Street Market, Eugene OR. Some whims should not be followed. It poured out a very bright almost fluorescent orange color. It was very bubbly and effervescent without any head or lacing. It was clear and the smell was very strongly orange. The taste was a bit like an orange soda...except more watered down and not as sweet - so maybe like an orange soda where the ice has melted in it. There was no complexity - just a sweet orange taste. Kate says: ""That's pretty heinous."""
"D - Highly quaffable, but as far as beer w/ fruit goes it could be more, well beer tasting. I enjoyed one, but repeated tastes might not be recommended unless looking for a refreshing taste of orange w/ your cream ale. A good entry beer for those who want to experiment w/ a craft beer."
"D - I'll say this. It looked like an okay beer. McDonald's orange is good as a sweet Kool-Aid type drink, but it doesn not make a good beer."
"D: Definitely quenched my thirst. It was a decent summertime ale, although I don't plan on buying any more in the future. In terms of fruity taste, not completely overdone, but not the best either."
"Drinkability: This was quite nice. I knew I was drinking beer and not a fruit wine cooler. Flavors worked nicely and the honey taste really came through. Definately worth trying."
"D - Meh, too much like orange soda for my tastes. If you want to get kids hooked on beer at an early age, this would be a good bet. Basically, this beer is a waste."
"Great Job!"
"Drinks very easy, not a huge fan of fruit beers, but this one is above average & works as a thirst quencher. Thought I'd hate this, but not bad"
"Pours a nice light pale orange color with little to no head. Smell is light and airy with obvious orange front. It lightens up after sitting out for a couple minutes ... soft metallic notes with a semi-sweet layer of spice and alcohol. Mouthfeel is light and wet ... could use a heavier feel but definitely easy to swallow. Taste ... well there is so much to say ... Orange ... Creamy front with sweet orange that tastes like a orange cream soda. Finish is nice and well balanced with slight bitterness of orange zest and acidity with smooth malty undertones. This tastes more like a soda than a beer and for a fruit beer it is an excellent summer pourch pounder."
"D: It just never really stands out. A bit too one-dimensional...but I should have expected that from this sort of gimmick brew."
"Pours a golden orange. Very thin white head,with no retention,or lacing to speak of. Smell is of weak orange pop. Body is thin,and carbionated. Taste is of orange pop,with a creamcicle finish.This is a good tasting beverage,but where's the ale? Perhaps a bit more alchol would have helped. More like a wine cooler than a beer."
"I always loved Buffalo Bills Pumpkin Ale, so I had to give this a try. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a light orange, forming a thin 1/4 inch head, and leaving light rings of lace. The aroma is just like a Sunkist orange soda. Thats the only way to describe it. The taste is almost the same, except the orange flavoring is backed off a little, and replaced with a slight macro grain flavor in the finish. Light mouthfeel. Overall, I could definitely see serving my non-beer drinking friends this. I think its something they could enjoy for a while. While its not something that most beer drinkers would enjoy, I personally found it an interesting change to the usual styles. Definitely worth a try!"
"D: So sweet and soda-like that I would be hard pressed to drink more than one of these consecutively. Definitely a beer to start or end the night, but not what you want to have as the main even."
"Pours a pale golden orange color with a fizzy head and lots of carbonation. Still, with all the bubbles, the head recedes all too quickly to only a thin ring around the glass. Yikes! The aroma here is more orange cream soda than orange cream ale. Smells like Sunkist, and that's not a good thing. But, it IS orangey, so at least it's living up to its moniker. The taste is thin and tart. Definitely tastes like orange soda more than beer. Acidic with the slightest hint of malt. No hop character present here at all. And with a very thin mouthfeel, it's hardly what I would call a ""cream ale."" They might as well put this in cans and sell it in vending machines with the other sodas. This is hardly drinkable, and I think my ""average"" ratings for appearance and smell are somewhat generous. The only thing right about the title of this beer is the orange part. The rest is misleading. Unless you like your beer to taste like orange soda, avoid this beer at all costs."
"Bottle at RFD Washington. Poured light and clear with an overall amber hue. Although the subtle aroma is a bit understated, this produces a very tart and fruity flavors, not unlike a creamsicle. My friends comment: ""Its Tang!"" Only for those who like them extra fruity! (#2771, 4/5/2007)"
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a gold/orange/applejuice color with an inch frothy white head. It has an orange, floral and vanilla smell to it. It reminds me a bit of a cheap orange soda the way it smells. There isn't much hops or malt in the aroma at all. It tastes like a slightly diluted/watered down orange soda or creamsickle. Once again, no real hops/malt in the taste of this beer. Mouthfeel is pretty light and thin, not much to it. I guess if you like watered down orange creamsickles you'll like this, but I'm not impressed by this at all. However, it does go down kinda easy but it's not exactly what I'd call drinkable. The beer looks and smells nice, but unfortunately it just goes downhill from there."
"It was definitely drinkable. I could seriously see myself drinking one of these at a picnic or after a day at the beach. But as an everyday beer, it simply wouldn't do it for me."
"An interesting concept, and this is actually my first orange flavored beer, but falls short of anything spectacular. Everything is just too bland, and it actually comes out like a watered down orange soda. However, this may be good to introduce to somebody that is used to drinking Budweiser or similar beers. I probably won't be revisiting this one."
"D - Never again. Is this even beer?"
"Imagine taking a pint glass and filling it half full of a macro lager and half full of orange soda. That's what this beer tastes like. Not my idea of a good beer (or even beer). Not recommended unless you think you might like beer that tastes like soda."
"Bought this on a whim in Fort Wayne Indiana. Very light mouthfeel without any aftertaste. Nice orangy aroma without the cloying sweetness you would expect from a ""girlie"" beer like this. No alcohol taste in evidence so you could drink a lot of these. A great beer if you are looking for a light refreshing brew."
"Drinkability: Might be a good summertime drink, reminds me of an malternative or a mixed drink. Not bad, but not what I am typically looking for in a beer."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly to a shallow layer leaving a little lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Orange nose. Starts and finishes like a sweet (almost cloying) orange drink, hints of hops in background. Reminds me of Fanta Orange with hops. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"D - u could drink alot if u like oranges that arent very sweet and it isnt that strong at 4.9%ABV ...i dont know why that isnt listed its right on the damn bottle"
"from the bottle. poured burnt orange. with no head. aroma floral, orange zest, did some sweetness but didnt smell like honey, and some hints of malt. flavor, like some others have said tang, and sour orange, was able to pick up the honey. did not care for this."
"D: Overall, this is a really unusual beer. I know it wasn't my thing, hence the low rating, but because the orange is done with a genuine orange as opposed to a ""Tang"" orange, it is a nice experimental beer. If you like fruit beers or alcopops, this could be up your alley."
"Overall very good. Over the past year Orange Blossom has become a staple in my fridge, and deservedly so."
"I find very little that could be described as beer in this one. Perhaps the best qualities are its being refreshing, drinkable and in no way offensive."
"D: Good session beer. It's pleasant and light, so I can't see any reason why you might not knock back a six or more yourself. Still, I'd rather spend the money on something better."
"Devoid of any kind of real head. Clear golden color and smell like Im about to drink a glass of Tang...hmmm beer in space! Dry, watery mouth and thin body. Slight bitterness from the hops. is noticeable and malt or barley is nowhere to be found. Pretty much orange flavoring is all I taste, not that its overpowering but that's all its really offering. I was hoping for a lot more instead I got Kool-Aid."
"This pours into a glass with a nice golden orange hue. The foamy white head lingers. You get an overwhelming orange nose, and the taste follows through. This is like drinking orange soda. I've heard others compare this to an orangesicle, but I don't get that sort of creamyness out of it. I like orange, and more specifically bitter orange in my beer, but this flavor is too far removed from beer to be enjoyable, even for what it is. I had one, and never again."
"Overall not a bad beer, if you like orange soda you should give it a try."
"Drinkability: Sure, it's not really what many would consider beer but it could be far worse; reflecting on what it is, I'd say its OK to drink cold on a hot day"
"D - Probably this cooler's best quality. It isn't anything I want to drink, but it is very light and very non offensive. Of course, that is an easy goal to achieve when you produce a watered down beer such as this."
"This beer poured out very reminiscent of a soda, a lot of fizz, small head which didn't stick around at all, zero lacing. The beer was somewhat of a golden orange in color, with decent carbonation. Smell and taste both dominated by orange, which should almost go without saying. Mouthfeel was light and crisp, went down smooth. Bottom line, if you like a light cream ale and orange flavor, you will love it, if you don't, leave it alone."
"D: Nice for a hot summer day. I actually prefer to drink this beer straight from the bottle ice cold, but it makes it hard to review that way."
"Notes: having tried and enjoyed pumpkin brews in the past I wasn't expecting it to taste like a ""beer/ale"" necassarily. Luckily I opted for the single bottle rather than the six pack."
"The name ""Orange Blossom"" really fits this ale quite perfectly. Maybe not a good fit for all serious beer drinkers, but good nonetheless. Reminds me of Avery's White Rascal. If you like that, you'll like this."
"The look is golden, like a cream soda. The scent is of orange. The taste is super orangey. It's very sweet and so much like orange soda I had to double check that I was drinking an ale. Very flavorful indeed, but if you don't like sweets and soda stay away from this one."
"The beer holds up to its label - interesting, but would not purcase a second."
"Into a pint glass, pours a clearish golden amber with fizzy head shrinking to nothing after pour, no lacing, probably over carbonated from the looks of it. Aroma is pretty agressive orange peel smell, tastes more like an orange soda than a beer. Get some malts, and it tastes like a beer, but its just no beer-like, no balance of orange peel and malt, and too carbonated, like a soda. Honestly, its a friggin hot day, and this was kind of nice and quenching, but I can't imagine trying this when it isn't 90+ degrees."
"Is this a wine cooler? I will not drink this again... Although not completely undrinkable - this isn't beer."
"Not a real drinkable beer, in fact barely a beer, its closer to the smirnoff and bacardi malternatives than it is to a real beer."
"It's not that I couldn't finish the bottle, but I'll not be drinking another."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is very light bodied and overly sweet. The beer is like drinking orange soda pop. As a soda pop it is a fantasticly successful; however, as a beer this is just not good."
"I enjoyed the beer and would drink it again, but it wasn't special enough to be noteworthy. If only they could have done more with that flavor and worked it into an aftertaste or a creamier mouthfeel."
"Overall this is a good summer beer. It does seem to be a love it or hate it affair though. But hey, if you love it and none of your friends do you can keep the rest of the six-pack like I did!"
"Pours a light golden amber with a minimal pure white head that dissipates quickly. True to it's name, a fairly strong initial aroma of oranges rises to meet the nostrils, along with hints of lemon zest and a light floral note. The initial flavor is a slightly burnt orange not dissimilar to Cointreau liqueur with just the right hop presence to provide balance and backbone without being overpowering. Fine, spritzy bubbles provide a champagne-like effervescence. This beer finishes cleanly, the carbonation almost seems to scrub the palate in preparation for the next sip."
"-UF"
"Hey, who put Tang in my beer? This one looks...well...orange with a coppery tone. Pours heavily carbonated with big bubbles that disappeared quickly. Smells...like orange Crush. Seriously. Slightly malty sweet and bitter with a bit of souring. Tastes strongly citrusy...again, like orange crush with a hard bittering from large amounts of curraco orange peel. Roughly grainy and astringent. Body is weak and compromised by the high carbonation. Finishes suddenly with the sweetness, but lingers in the orange flavors and the bitter bite. Aftertaste is the same as orange crush. Not as creamy of a beer as it should be. Orange bitter is out of balance."
"Pours a light copper, slightly hazed. Looks like a regular beer so far... hey, where's the head? And what's that smell? Yeesh, this beer is unearthly. The orange flavor is intense and very SOUR. There is some unremarkable ale flavor under there, but the orange stomps it out like a cigarette butt. Supposedly a summer thirstquencher, but I shudder at the thought of drinking this as a session beer. Seriously, if you are hell bent on a beer with orange flavor, then just get a Blue Moon (or whatever) with a slice of orange from your corner pub, because this one is a drain pour."
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. Created a nice even head. The aroma has a strong hint of orange peel. Very smooth taste. I think this was a very drinkable beer. Not what I would classify as a traditional craft beer, but it is an easy drinker, and excellent on a hot day."
"If this beer had a bigger malt body, it would be OK. But as it is right now, no dice."
"The feeling that this isn't really beer at all is compounded by what seems like over carbonation. I like plenty of carbonation in my beer, but coupled with the flavour I am left feeling like I am drinking orangeade (orange pop) rather than beer. I much preferred the Caldera."
"General comments: As a young boy, my family made the obligatory trips to Walt Disney World several times (we lived in NJ) in my pre-teen years. This beer took me back to the times we stopped along the road and bought bags of oranges to eat once we entered Florida. The aroma filled the car and this beer will fill your senses with the taste of ""creamy oranges""."
"Poured a crystal clear gold almost amber. Had a 1 finger head that dissapated quickly and left little lace. First whif is orange, upon a secong some of the sweet malt does come through. Not much hop presence detected. Tatste is very light, almost watery where malt is cocerned but the bitter sweet orange comes right through. It has fairly high carbonation is sweet and dry. You can probably only drink a 2 of these before you get really tired of the orangeness of it. Its OK for a change of pace but it is not a heavyweight it the world of beer. Worth a try but don't expect a lot unless you really love orange."
"Aroma was more apricot than orange. Interesting flavor going on here - flowery but not perfume-like - an essence of orange blossom, like walking through the orchard. Delicate orange flavor that was ephemeral, like when I was a kid and would pinch off the base of a honeysuckle bloom for a tiny drop of nectar. A little dry and astringent at the finish. Overall, the flavor was nice, yet not really enough to carry the beer - after the initial intrigue with the floral aspect, interest fell off fairly quickly. Not really a good summer cooler because I think the orange blossom note would get tedious."
"This is one that some will hate and some will love, give it a try if it sounds like sometrhing you could like."
"I usually don't go for flavored sparkling water and this beer is just about that."
"This beer's smell was almost as impressive as the taste. After a few drinks, it reminds me of a creamcicle. A very light beer with a heavy orange flavor. In the after taste, there are hints of cloves and other christmas beer like flavors. Not a bad beer but the orange flavor tastes more like the peels rather than the fruit."

"Nice mouthfeel with a medium body that's easy drinking and quite refreshing. This is a brew I could enjoy every now and again, definetly worth a shot...especially if you like orange."
"Talk about a wacky beer--I like it! Not very complex and not for everyone, but it reminds me of some Belgian wits that are as drinkable as soda."
"Pours a pale light golden with a thin wispy white head,very effervescent orange aroma with a toasted cereal grain in there as well pleasant.Tastes like orange flavored cheerios kinda odd comparison but it reaaly fits for this beer like drinking tang with the morning cheerios.A winter seasonal seems kinda odd for this brew seems much more of a summer beer.Not a really bad beer I could see myself drinking this on a hot summer afternoon here in NC."
"The lable says, brewed and bottled under contract so I don't know if there's other flavors to try. Worth trying, make sure there's someone (or more) to share it with."
"This is definitely a novelty. I'll probably share the other five brews. I don't see myself buying this again, unless it's to serve at a party."
"Overall Impression: Orange. A light easy to drink beer that skirts the line with malternative. Not complex, not challenging, an easy session beer for a warm day, or heck, even a cold one."
" Nice drinkability, and an ideal palate cleanser. There is a pleasant, orange blossom honey character here that I find endearing. This would be really nice on a warm, summer evening, with steamed shellfish."
"Drinkability- More of a summer, warm weather beer. I did enjoy it though and would buy it again. A nice thirst quencher with a fruity kick to it."
"This beer pours an orange-gold color with very little head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is all orange - like an orange cream soda or as my friend Kevin says, that orange drink from McDonald's. Very light body and the flavor is just like the aroma. Not very beer-like, but it's really enjoyable to drink. I could drink these all night. A little light for a cream ale, but it still tastes really good."
"This one pours a peachy color, with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is all oranges up in my face, like the orange drink from McDonald's. Not exactly what I want from my beer. The flavor is also much the same as the McDonald's orange drink. Not much beer in there. Its not bad, but its not what I want from a beer, even if it is in the fruit beer style. This is way too over the top on the orange. The feel is moderate to thick, with a nice creamy texture. Drinkability is fairly good. I still have to give it some lower marks. Its a refreshing beer, just too far away from beer for me."
"Pours a brilliant copper-gold color. It is topped by a rapidly disappearing off white head. The aroma is of vanilla cream orange soda as I pour it, as I go in for a deeper sniff this is even more apparent. To be honest I don't smell any beery aspects. The taste is lightly sweet up front and as you swallow this beer the orange really opens up and expresses itself. This is very smooth, with no bitterness at all, which would perhaps be out of place in this beer. This is actually not too bad, if I wanted something refreshing, light and fruity on a hot summer day outside in the sun, I might actually reach for this. I can see this really appealing to certain segments of the beer drinking public."
"Not bad as a novelty, but I'd get tired of this quick if it was a daily brew."
"Upon its decamping the 12-ounce brown bottle the beer sets in the glass an unclouded golden amber color with a middling in size frothy white head that dissolves quickly leaving a velum like sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet orange blossoms, fresh and crisp, start is nicely malted and somewhat sweet and the top light to medium in feel. Finish is dynamically acidic with the hops subdued and pleasantly spicy, very dry aftertaste a quite nice beer overall."
"I really don't know how to review this beer. It was nothing more than a melted creamsicle in a bottle. The nose and taste was incredibly orange. I have to admit that it was good tasting, but I had a very hard time remembering that I was drinking beer. I can imagine that the ladies may enjoy this. I gave it 3s on everything because I just can't get around the fact that it is good, but not good for beer. At least it is worth a try."
"Now I need a beer..."
"It smells like an ice tea with fruit flavoring, but not too strong. It pours as a dull orange colored liquid (surprise) with some head that doesn't last. It tastes like a sweet beer with an orange taste as you swallow and a sweet aftertaste. Yes, it is creamy. If you like Orange Crush/Sunkist/Minute Maid with a lot of beer taste in it, this is for you. It is too sweet to have more another after finishing the first."
"A single bottle of indeterminate age and origin. Pours nearly headless with bouquet of orange soda. Indeed, the entire flavor is consumed with orange, and it seems somewhat artificial or chemical. I suppose it is somewhat refreshing in its way, but this is more akin to a soda than a beer. The orange flavor is sweet, like candy, rather than tart. I think orange flavors, if done well, could marry interestingly with citric hop flavors, but in this case there aren't any hop flavors to speak of. I had a delicious dinner tonight and this sweet confection has obliterated all memory of it. The ""cream"" in the title is nowhere to be found; the beer is decidedly slick and fizzy. If you want beer, stay away. If you want a soda pop type beverage, you might like this. To be fair, the mouthfeel does manage to be refreshing, and the beverage goes down smoothly enough; just not enough beer flavor. As a malternative, I suppose this will satisfy some. As a beer, however, it is diabolical."
"Drinkability - I like Bert Grant's Mandarin Hefe and this one is just as tasty. Somewhat alco-poppish, yes, but distinctive and tasty nonetheless. The sweetness might knock it down a peg, but I could handle a few of these with no complaints."
"This brew is a clear orange color with lots of bubbles. Very thin off-white head that vanished right away, as well as quick lacing. Light honey and spice aroma. Light body with a crisp character, and tastes of orange soda, sweet honey and a touch of spice. The finish is light on flavor but is consistently tangy. All in all this is an unassuming beer that is light on flavor but is easy to drink."
"As this warms further, it is simple unfinishable."
"I found this beer somewhat frustrating because it seemed like they -almost- got it right. If it had been me designing this beer, I would have started with a crisp, hoppy pilsner (or perhaps even a light wheat beer) and then added an orange note, emphasizing the crisp light taste of the orange. Instead they choose to emphasize the sweetness by adding honey and ended up with something that misses the mark. That said, this would be an okay beer for a change of pace on a hot summer day but I wouldn't consider putting it into regular rotation..."
"The taste and smell were the only two good things about this beer. Well, those, and the end of the bottle. If I was a little bit richer, I would have poured this out. At any rate, it was like an orange popsickle mixed with beer. Whoever came up with this idea needs to be firmly punished. Maybe even flogged. This beer was sickeningly sweet and was just bad. I don't really know why I got it, but the only reason I can think of is just being adventuresome. In short, stay away from this. Unless you are hard up for karma points. 8)"
"Sampled 3/26/04"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a light and refreshing orange scent along with a bit of pale malt aroma. The taste is good. It has a light malt core with an extremely flavorful orange taste that is achieved through the use of orange peels. It tastes like your drinking orange soda. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with excellent carbonation. This is a fine fruit style brew. The aroma and taste are out of this world. One of the best I've had."
"I won't drink buy this one again, but for it's category it's OK...light orange color....no head...big orange gatorade smell...taste is not as big as the nose but a nice orange flavor...the honey is very light if at all noticable...it feels very thin and watery (perhaps by design)...Not my thing but for a fruit beer it at least smells and tastes like oranges....with a few tweaks it could be average....I'd suggest a fuller body....a bigger honey presence...and a slight softening of the big orange nose..."
"Wow was I suprised by this beer. I've had this in my fridge for about 2 months and finally decided this hot sweaty day was the day for this beer. Pours an amber/orange with a semi white/tan head that rose 2 inches then vanished into a little puddle of white. The lacing was average, it was traceable at best. The smell is a strong blast of orange citrus, it smells like an orange soda mixed with cream soda. Unbeliavably refreshing to the nose. The taste is phenomenal, upfront is a sweet orange/cream and in the rear is slight hops. The only downfall is that the sweetness is a little to much and the hops are almost untraceable to the tongue. This is a great summer beer, on this site it says winter but I can still find this in certain stores here in June so I don't know what the deal is with that. This is by far the best fruit beer I have ever had, I agree if you don't like orange/cream sodas you probably won't like this beer. Great for summer BBQ's."
"Actually quite a refreshing little number! Would I drink a sixer of this,no but on a hot summer day I'd have no problem pouring one or two of these."
"Tasted: 06/09/04"
"Its spritzy, fizzy, fruity, and light. Mildly sweet up front. No hop flavor at all. The taste is almost delicate, and restrained. To be honest, I didnt get a lot out of this beer. Its a soda-pop brew, and a disappointment."
"Is it orange soda or beer? ... ... You decide! It smells, and to a certain extent (it's not THAT sweet) tastes, like orange soda. Fanta, perhaps? Of course, an orange soda would hold a better head. But I digress. I actually liked this beer! It's an interesting and refreshing change of pace that should work very well on a hot summer's day in between brews. Some might reach for a malternative, but not me... I'll just grab an orange blossom!"
"Amber/gold in color with almost no head (I'm guessing the orange oils squashed any chance of a head!) Smell was predominantly orange and maybe a little floral scent... I found the smell quite pleasant. Taste, again is dominated by orange up front (but it's not sweet or syrupy) with a little mildly malty beer flavor in the background. Fizzy mouthfeel. Slightly sour aftertaste. I'd say this is OK to try once for the novelty, but it won't be one of my regulars!"
"Even with a vigorous pour, this beer has no head retention. Pours an orangey amber, with a lot of carbonation. Very nice Orange smell, with a subtle hint of honey. Tastes better than most cream ales, as it is dominated by a strong orange flavor, which is appealing to me, but can be overpowering. Due to the carbonation, the mouthfeel is more akin to a Coke than an ale, and even with vigorous agitation, the carbonation stays. I could definitely see drinking a few of these on a warm summer day on the front porch, and besides the pour, this beer is relatively well done. Plus the bottle has pretty frickin' cool artwork."
"A gimmicky type brew for girlies."
"I imagine that it's possible to brew a passable, maybe even a pretty good, orange cream ale. If you've been looking for just such a thing, be aware that Orange Blossom Cream Ale is not it. It isn't offensive, but it's in the ballpark."
"Poured a very orangey color, with a big white head. Smelled like oranges and a little malt. This stuff also tasted like orange pop, but it wasn't a bad thing . The orange flavor was subtle enough not to come off as syrupy or an afterthought. Light, crisp mouthfeel, with lots of carbonation. For a orange cream flavored beer, this stuff was not that bad."
" Flavor is toned down and dominated by cheap orange drink. It has slight hints of malts every now and then, but it is basically a bad fruit drink. Do not even bother with this one."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, almost fizzy. The orange flavor lingers on the tongue well after the swallow. This is average on drinkability scale since the orange flavors are too strong."
"Taste: palpable creaminess on the palate, orangey flavor, and again, there's huge carbonation. Nothing but sody-pop, and a bit too sour at first, with the orange flavor, and any true beer-y characteristics, being too light to consider it a worthy brew. Too light bodied, minimal finish...there's probably a lot of folks out there who'd dig this (girly-girls, panty-waists, Nancy-boys, sissy-pants), but not me, brother, not me."
"If I'm in the mood for an orange soda, I might pick this up instead."
"The color of this beer is clear light golden. Not much of a head or lace. This fucking beer smells like Hi-C's Orange Lavaburst. I've never had a beer smell so orangey before. Not much beer related stuff on the nose however, which is disappointing. The taste is not my thing. You see, the thing is...this beer doesn't taste like beer. It's like mixing one part Hi-C to one part Miller Lite. Not good. Very weak and watery in the mouthfeel and flavor. Oh yeah, there's orange there...but that's about it."
"It isn't spectacular, but I'd say it's certainly worth trying. It's a decent beer on its own."
"Thin, thin, thin. Lots of carbonation. Like I said before, it's like drinking orange soda, only with hops. Very little bitterness follows this one. Easy to drink, a 6-pack would seem suffiecient though. Decent beer, if you like oranges."
"The taste wasn't that bad, however, this beer lacked any body whats-so-ever and was completely flat."
"Tiny, white, noisy head dies to absolutely nothing fast. It's gone. Zero head. Amazing. Orangey gold beer. Nose is all sugary orange. Nothing else. Orange front with some faint nutty grains. Orange middle. Orange finish is dryish, with some nutty, roasty crackers making an appearance. I like that roastiness. The orange makes this unique, but it's nothing too special."
"Bright clear gold, pale head starts decently but doesn't last. Lace really doesn't stick to the glass much at all. Uh oh, you can smell children's aspirin from two feet away. A little more genuine on a deep inhalation. Oddly sticky and slick, mouthfeel and flavor is compromised by the odd mixture of OK orange, pineapple, slickness, and distilled water. Doesn't really compose itself in the mouth, wanders in varied directions. Slightly medicinal close with lots of orange to the aftertaste. If you like straight up sweet orange, this is actually better from the bottle -- where it doesn't open up and the citrus is concentrated. Strictly me, but I can't recommend this one."
"This is one odd beer...if you want to even call it that. It was sort of like tang and seltzer or something. Okay, so, it poured with a clear orangy gold color which was kind of pretty. The head was gone in a flash. The aroma was very tang-like based on old memories of tang, which really didn't bother me, but it didn't smell like fresh orange. This definitely tasted orange (tang that is), and I could taste the honey in my first sip, but not after that. I think there may have been more orange extract used than the orange peel, so maybe that was why the tang taste prevailed. It left a very clean aftertaste, and was actually rather ""quaffable", since it really tasted more like soda than beer. I will give a positive spin to all this to say that if you have friends who drink like tequiza (sp), you may want to give them this beer and it will be a more interesting alternative."
"Quite an odd brew. Pours a clear orange with a white head that had no intention of sticking around. Very strong aroma of oranges supported with some hints of malt. The medium-bodied mouthfeel is way too carbonated. It reminded me of drinking orange soda. Flavors of sweet orange and honey dominate the front. Some malt flavors begin to emerge midway through. Finish is pretty non-descript. Not overly complex and non-offensive (if you like orange flavor). This would be a great summer refresher."
"Silly brewmaster, oranges are for juice!"
"Pours a clear pale burnt orange with a white soda-type head that disappeared rapidly. The smell is a bold orange aroma backed by a light roasted malt with not much else, but still enticing. The taste is very much like a very watered down orange soda with only a hint of any malt or hops at all. It is a very light bodied brew that finishes lightly sweet. Now that description said, drinkability is through the roof! Its as if the flavor is so faint, yet so smooth with almost zero evidence of alcohol, you just drink like Gatorade on a hot day. I have mixed emotions on this one. Perhaps I need to try this again in the heat of the summer. Odd, interesting, and unique. Cheers!"
"This would be a nice diversion on a hot day."
"The color was a clear medium golden yellow and very little to no foam what so ever. The smell had just a slight aroma of orange blossoms with just a hint of hops. The taste had an orange flavor with a slight bitterness and sour aftertaste on the palate. Although it had an orange taste, this was a weak beer with no creamyness at all. A good beer if you like an orange flavor."
"Pours a dull copper, zilch for a head. Smell of fresh oranges, malts, very fruity. Up front, a blast of orange peels dominate the palate; maybe some honey and lemon/zesty notes. The orange malty (?) body becomes creamy, true to the name; slightly carbonated. Other than, you guessed, the orange peel, this is pretty much a one-sided brew. Tastes resemble an orange soda or orange hard candy. For the style, not too shabby, just can't see craving this one much; a change of pace though."
"I was unable to finish this bottle. I just can't take the weird cleanser smell. Good luck if you decide to try it."
"Pours a very light color and leaves a small white head. Smells of sweet honey and probably obviously oranges. I'm expecting some powerfull fruit tones in this brew. The first taste I encouter was oranges lots of them followed by a sweet honey taste that sweetens out the brew. The aftertaste is a bit bitter almost, but still a very drinkable brew. This probably one of the better fruitybrews I've had. Easy going down with a not too sweet taste. Pretty nice job on this beer."
"Pours a very clear pale amber color with a slight orange tint and a short white fizzy head that soon vanishes completely. Nose is sweet malt and fresh grain with a faint trace of orange zest (definitely less orange aroma than I was expecting). Moderate in body with a spritzy texture and rather sharp carbonation. Taste remains fairly constant throughout the tasting with notes of sweet malt and a bit of honey balanced by bitter citrus oils and orange peel. Would make for a nice springtime brew."
"A friend brought this over and so I decided to try a bottle. It poured a copper color and formed a white head that left some trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of orange peel, with some other citrus present with a hint of malt. The flavor was of orange and honey with a slight malt aspect. The finish has a sour aspect that really hurt the beer."
"Strange fruit! I'm not sure what the intention, or the market focus is for this one? The beer looks ok-clean golden color with a slightly above average bit of lace and considerable stick. My problem is with the rest of the drink. The nose is more akin to a soda than a beer. It lacks any finesse or restraint and seems to be trying to appeal to the folks who don't really like beer, but want to be drinking one with the rest of the gang-kind of like a white zinfandel of the beer world. The flavors are candied orange and then cloying malt that come off in a sweet and sour sort of way that to me just doesn't work. The more ya drink the less you want. This is an easy to put down brew-and I mean down the drain."
"Overall a good and very different beer experience. I'd recommend it just on the novelty value alone. This would be GREAT on a spring or summer afternoon, out on the back porch, listening to the lawn mowers in the distance while the baseball game winds along on the radio. Try it if you see it."
"Sort of drinkable, it is mild and different. Not an all night beer, but a good orange beer."
"It's a light golden color with a small head that disappears quickly. Sweet orange aroma, very similar to orange peel. It's quite fun to smell it actually, and a touch of honey is in there too. Fizzy carbonation makes the mouthfeel kind of odd and a bit like soda. Orange peel dominates the flavor. Honey is in there a bit, and adds a certain smoothness. It's an interesting beer and very easy to drink. But the aftertaste is quite annoying, kind of like chewing on an orange peel. This aftertaste alone knocks down drinkability and taste. An odd beer, here."
"Drinkability/notes: Very nice, and quite drinkable, although better suited to warm weather than cold; it would be excellent on a hot summer day. My fiancée liked this very much; I suspect that women who are less than enthused with beer might enjoy this beer instead of an alcopop malt beverage."
"Conclusion: Not as good as I had hoped but pretty tasty. The best way to drink this, in my opinion, is moderately cold with a slice of fresh orange thrown in. I wouldn't say it's a new favorite but I would buy it again. The only think I don't get is if there is an actual buffalo bills brewery since this beer is contracted out to Portland."
"Presentation: 12 Oz Brown bottle with label showing oranges and orange blossoms. Appearance: clear, light-medium golden color with a small head that quickly disappears. Minimal carbonation. Smell: Minimal malt/hops aroma- fresh bright orange peel (but a little sweeter than peel) is the dominant aroma (it reminds me of the smell of my fingers after I use them to break open a sweet orange). Taste: A very refreshing, creamy flavor that has both the sweetness and tang of orange fruit. The orange flavor lasts a while after the the swallow. Very drinkable. I first tried this a few months ago, and I keep returning to it on a once in a while basis- It's not a remarkable beer, but it is just easy to drink and enjoyable. I would really like to try it on a hot day or a warm evening."
"This was a tough one for me to decide on ratings. The brew is an exceptionally clear golden/orange with mild carbonation and a small, rapidly diminished white head. Smells -- and tastes -- like some good orange cream soda's I've had. In that respect, I liked it -- but I didn't feel like I was drinking beer. I can't deny that it's good, though -- but I'd probably enjoy it more on a summer afternoon than I do right now watching the snow fall."
"An interesting brew. Was looking for the typical winter seasonal but came accross this and thought I'd give it a try since I like their pumpkin ale. Pours a golden color with a thin big head made of large bubbles that soon dissapates to nothingm though the beer stays carbonated. As expected it has an orange aroma, with maybe a hint of hops but that is about it. The taste is light ub flavor with a orange cream flavor that follows. Overall an ok beer but I feel that it is lacking a little."
"An unusual beer but not to bad,,though I would be pushed to drink more than two bottles."
