"Adbsolutely incredibe. So sweet like cherry juice."
""
""
"Cuvee-Brut is quite dry and tart like a champagne with a cherry after taste."
""
""
""

"By far my favorite beer in this style; very nice, punchy, soury taste.  It can be a bit overwhelming if you're not to keen on sour things, but then again you probably wouldn't be drinking this beer if you were."

"Tart yet sweet..good tasting brew."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it was very fruity just as I expected, but the it still had a little bit of complexity to it and that made for a pretty tasty dessert beer.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, a little refreshing, not too acidic, not overly sweet, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, a whole bottle might be a little too much for me, but a couple glasses of it would be nice.  What I like the most about this beer was that it wasn't overly sweet and it was a little complex.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it just wasn't a great looking beer.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes cherry beers.  All in all I liked this beer, I was expected it to be overly sweet and it wasn't, I really liked that and the added complexity was nice.  This made for a good first impression for this brewery and it's one of the better cherry beers I've had.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer, keep up the hard work."

"Dark amber-ruby color. Dense haze blocks most light.  Sweet cherry aroma. Fresh cherries hit the tongue right away. Mostly sweet and only mildly tart. Almost no hop character. Just the slightest hints of wood in the finish. Extremely well balanced. Medium bodied and somewhat sticky from the sugars. Sharp, snappy carbonation adds a dryness to the finish to contrast the fruit. I am not a huge fan of fruit beers but everything is so well put together in this one that I just can't put my glass down. This would be a great beer with just about any dessert, especially those made with chocolate or berries."

"2011 vintage from bottle. Pours deep reddish brown with a fluffy white head that has a reddish hue to it. Smells very strongly of cherries with a hint of other dark fruits and earthiness in the background. Taste is very tart cherry, hard to describe as it is a strong taste of cherry but mellow at the same time, there is some darkness to the taste too in the end like plums and figs, but the cherry is the star here. The mouthfeel is way above average for a fruit beer, it is very smooth and creamy, not highly carbonated; a great aspect of this beer. At first I was worried that I picked up a 3 year old fruit beer, but this came out very well, the cherries toned down and some of the Oud Bruin came out, simply delicious!"

"Out of curiosity, I think corresponds to the proposal, but I saw no difference with a champagne cooler or cheaper... Appearance: inviting bottle with paper wrapper; in translucent red glass with little foam, but persistent. Aroma: here I remembered some beer, because the malt appears slightly. Taste: sweet, actually has cherry leaves an aftertaste of malt and sweet; said despite the 6% alcohol, did not find them."
"Red-brown color , pink head. Aroma of cherries , grain , currant , notes of wood. Taste is light sweet and light sour , notes of cherries , oak and some caramel. Medium body , moderate carbonation. Very tasty!"
""
"T: Very sour, unsweetened grape juice, cola, chocolate covered cherries, cough syrup, sour cherry; sweet syrup"
""
""
"It's refreshing, it's tasty, but it's way too sweet for my taste. I know it's not a full-on sour beer, so the rating will be given considering usual Belgian fruit beers."

"Overall: I fell in love with this beer at a local pub called Pale Nine Ale House in San Diego. This was the beer that developed my love for sour beers. I find this beer to be a refreshing change from most other beers. It is the perfect combination of sour tastes and fruity tastes for me."
""
""
"Overall: a pure pleasure to drink, actually gets you excited, and remarkably it doesn't tire with all the sugar, a credit to the excellent carbonation; get your hands on this"
""
""
""
""
"That one important blip notwithstanding, it's hard not to champion Liefmans Cuvée Brut as an exceptionally delicious example of this wonderfully complex, distinct style. Anyone that doesn't enjoy this beer must be just plain miserable. That being said, I too would opt for the more traditional (read: unsweetened) version probably 8 times out of 10."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice fruit beer with lots of intense, sweet, but real (not syrupy) fruit flavor with a sour backbone keeping things in check. Complex and very approachable for a sour beer. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Well it isn't a New Glarus fruit beer, but it's similar. Too sweet, though."
""
""
"Overall, I am very happy I grabbed this bottle on a whim. It's very good, and I'm pleasantly surprised. I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in fruit flavored brews of any sort!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Tartly sweet cherries came across, flavorwise, with an easygoing finish. Cherries all the way."
""
"(4.0) D: This is pretty flavourful and leans to the sweet side but with a nice natural cherry flavour to it. This went down pretty easily with a pleasant, albeit slight, balsamic tartness."
""
"O: an interesting beer. I enjoyed the tartness quite a bit, but there were times it was a little too sweet. That being said, I think my beer was pretty young and I will be interested to try it again in a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice fruity notes and a tart finish, but just a little too sweet to enjoy in large quantities. The best before date is 2023, so maybe some age will tone down the sweetness? I will report back in 10 years.."

"O: 2112 vintage. Hard to drink. Had to choke it down what we could and pour out the rest. It was entirely too sweet. It wasn't clean tasting and proper acidity was just not there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid sour cherry, though I prefer the Goudenband. There's a good balance of tart, sour, and sweet in this."

"This is better than any cherry soda I've ever had. If your crazy for cherries with an abv you gotta pull the trigger on this."

"Dynamic and strong. Resonating with complexity and character."
"o: much better than the appearance and aroma indicated. this is a 2 year old bottle. still taste cherry nicely. the tartness is very mild and works well with the sweet dark cherry flavor. no flavor in here overwhelms the other, and sweet and tart are harmonized nicely. real nice stuff"
""
""
"The taste is a lot more like a legitimate beer than the Fruitesse but it has a very sweet, almost artificial tasting finish. Tart cherry juice, sour cherries and sour grapes start out in charge then quickly give in to a fake “from concentrate” cherry juice taste with too much sweetness. Not bad, but definitely not on the level of the Goudenband. Too bad."

"Overall 4.25: Outstanding/Excellent kriek. This kriek is higher in ABV (6% ABV) than many others, but it is so smooth and delicious. Wonderful and complex at every level, Liefman's is a hard act to follow, so remember that when planning a session. Session? Yes, this baby is entirely sessionable. I would highly recommend drinking the entire 75 centiliter (that's 1 pint, 9.4 ounces) in one sitting. Highly recommended for all kriek heads. Not the best from Kriek Week, but darn close."
""
"Poured into a pint glass."
""
""
""
""
"A short and quickly thinning head tops this brown elixir. It smells like rhubarb, and has a taste to match. The taste, to be more precise, is that of rhubarb pie, including the delightful, mitigating sweetness of the sugary aspect of the filling and the crust. What Southern Tier's Pumking is to pumpkin pie, this brew is to its rhubarb counterpart, with a certain, sour, cherry cast. A fun concoction, with the characteristics of a dessert for a sophisticated palate. The refreshing character of the carbonation is just right."
""
"Overall, I'm disappointed to see that this is classified as a ""fruit beer", because the experience of drinking it just doesn't seem to fit with what I would expect from that general style. I suppose this is one of those beers that sort of falls between the cracks of standard classification. There isn't really a beer style that ladders up to a blend of oud bruins fermented on sour cherries. If it were American-made, it would almost certainly get the ""American Wild Ale"" classification in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a beer that is going to impress anyone looking for a lambic or kriek. But if you want the cherry flavor, with the rare culmination of both mild sour and balanced fruit without overwhelming sugaryness, this is the beer for you."
""
""
""
""

""

"Hazy garnet topped with a slim, creamy head. Cherry aroma upfront with some almost chocolaty/nutty notes, slight brown sugar, and an increasing woody dryness. Super smooth cherry tartness and mild spicy wood flavors. Sweet, yet dry. Medium bodied, slick, and a real pleasure to drink."
""
""
"Taste is refreshingly tart. I had worried perhaps it would be too sugary sweet but I'd say it actually tilts more towards tart than anything. That's not to say that it isn't sweet, because at first there's a great sweet cherry taste that goes into a more tart sensation that especially gives a sour kick at the end. Very drinkable of course. Who doesn't like alcoholic cherry soda?? With a tart kick of course."
"Taste is syrupy fruit...almost grainy sugary sweetness. Cherry cough syrup and some wood. Its ok...not sure why it has such a high rating. I think its just too sweet..couldn't finish the pour."

"O- Wow, I really enjoy sour beers, it's just another side to beer that needs to be exposed. I feel like it could of used some more booze, and it would be perfect. Still world class in my book. Extremely balanced."
""
"O - These beers aren't really my thing however I appreciate the balance in this one. If they used real fruit it would be outstanding"
""
""
"Liefmans Cuvee-Brut is a solid Kriek. It is not as sweet as other Krieks, so those that don't enjoy Krieks too sweet, try this one. It doesn't pour much head, but the taste is not flat. If you are thinking about trying a Kriek and hesitant on the fruit beers, this is a good one to try first."
""
""
""
"Looked for this beer for a long time and finally found it in a little shop in San Diego. This poured a lot darker than i was expecting. Amber with a strong red hue. Light head that has good retention, slightly pink. Smell is yeast, cider, lime and cherries. Wonderfully refreshing taste, just a touch too sweet. Tons of cherry, slightly tart from citrus. Feel is light and crisp. Super refreshing. No booze. This is terrific, and was a big hit with the ladies. Only qualm is its slightly too sweet, and could use a touch more carbonation. Cherries galore!"

"I have been looking at this beer every time I walk down the beer aisle at Total Wine. Glad that I picked one up. There is a blue one (I assume blueberry) next to it. That is also on our ""list"". We will get to that soon, I am sure. VERY happy with this bottle, and glad that we could drink this to celebrate Valentine's Day. Hope everyone had a good beer to share, regardless if you are drinking alone!"
""
""
"This maybe my favourite sour beer. The purist in me is not too happy that they are using sugar and I guess they could at least reduce the amount a bit. But it is balanced and very drinkable. The combination of the smooth carbonation and the tartness is just devine. I love sour cherries and I love to drink this beer on a summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great lambic beer. I loved it."
"As you might expect from the brightly wrapped 750 mL bottle, this beer has a strong cherry flavor. The cherry is bittersweet and feels thin and sharp in your mouth at first. The appearance is a transparent red, with a thin head. The sweetness can be a bit over-powering at first but did mellow some after a few sips."
""
"Overall (4.25/5): Brouwerij Liefmans Cuvée Brut was an unexpected treat–usually I'm wary of fruit beers, but this one was quite good. I especially like how the cherry aspects of the beer are not so dominant that the beer's woody/oaky and sour characteristics are not overshadowed. Excellent taste, mouthfeel, and beautiful looking in a glass. A good fruit beer for people who are unsure of them."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with medium to medium-high carbonation. The result is a crisp, easily drinkable beer that finishes dry and with little residual stickiness on the palate."
"Rusty brown on cherry with a little white etch atop the beer. Smells of cherries, wood, some leather and a delicate tartness in the nose. I feel like it might have a good dose of wood to match the acidity of the beer. Flavor is tart cherry with some interwoven wood and pepper, a surprising sweetness in the middle there that lightens the flavor into a near fine candy character, reminds me of a hand made cherry cola honestly. Medium bodied with low carb and a semi dry finish. Decent beer, dunno if it's worth the price tag I've seen it at though."
""
""
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet, can't find a bottle date (12/2020 is on the top), bought it this year. This pours a slightly hazy reddish brown color with a small extremely short lived tan head. The smells are nice, you get the apple cider vinegar, sour cherries, tartness, a hint of funk. The feel is medium, with med carbonination. The taste is as expected, a load of tart cherries, vinegar. A beautiful sweet and sour, I really wish I could find this stuff closer to me."

"O: great beer aside from the cough syrup taste at the very end of the drink. other than that it has nice flavors, good drinkability and a great sourness to it."
""
""
"Very drinkable, would have been great if it was carbonation."
""
"O: an excellent sour ale for fans of krieks and lambics, particularly if you'd prefer something a bit less sweet. Superb after dinner beverage."
"Champgane style bottle poured into red wine plastic glasses. Pours a dark crimson with white foam. Cloudy. Cherry smell, some malt. Cherry taste too, with a light sour. Very pleasant carbonation. Very flavorful, but balanced. Good mix of fruit and sours."
""
""
"Overall a really good fruit beer. I'd buy again."
"Medium bodied with sweet and tart dark fruit notes followed by a strong acetic vinegar flavor.  Lots of tart dark cherry and other vinous fruit with a strong acetic vinegary presence mid palate that lingers throughout.  Dark malt flavor underneath with some caramel and cocoa.  A bit too sweet and vinegary for me yet it never becomes harsh or solvent like.  Slightly sour but more tart with lots of fruit.  Could use a stronger malt backbone and less acetic acid."
""
"O: It was ok, easy drinking and fruity, but not really a beer I want to drink over and over."
""
""
""
""
""
"Caramel color, thin w/ very little carbonation, an almost cider-vinegar aftertaste but sweet and hints of cherries. By far my favorite beer I've had this month."
""
""
"Much more interesting than most fruit-centric beers that are not lambics."
"I have no problem downing a 750 of this to myself very easily, but I really like sours and fruit beers that don't taste fake. I also really like super hoppy ipas and deep dark stouts so don't fret. This is just a super well made beer thats easily drinkable, refreshing, provides ample delicious cherry flavor and its a bit sour. And its a at a generally at a great price point."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a really great fruit beer. Reminds me of Lindemans, but not quite as sweet....it has a little more of a Belgian yeast/spice kick to it. A great beer I'd love to have again."
"O- I enjoyed this ""beer"". A bit one dimensional, but it does the trick. It definitely is natural in taste, and real fruit is evident."
""
"D - A very tasty, drinkable fruit beer. Although not technically a lambic, the profile is quite close (closer than Lindemans anyways...) Definitely something I could drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a really nice sour ale. I don't feel like the style it is listed under does it any justice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- excellent fruit beer. Lots of cherries, not cloying at all. Well balanced and complex. I was really digging that sweet flower smell/taste."
""
""
"O- A very tasty Belgian beer at a nice price point. Definitely worth splitting a 750. Would make for a nice dessert beer."
""
""
""
"Had on tap at Max's in Baltimore. I loved this beer.... fruit beers can be hit or miss for me but this one was on spot. A nice tart, cherry beer with tons of flavor and a nice well balanced, smooth taste. Drink it way too quickly and could have easily ordered a few more pints. Haven't delved into the foreign beers too much, but after trying this I just might have to."
""
""
"O: Very nice, there is a good balance between the sweetness of the cherries and the sourness/funkiness. Enjoyable and easy to drink, I think of it more of a sipping beer than a sessionable beer."
""
""
"O: While it can be very sweet at times, the alcohol, carbonation, and tart, sour flavor balances out this wonderful summer and salad companion. Ripe cherries pour from the glass, and its mouthfeel is light and slightly spritzy (it would work well in some sort of beer cocktail). If you are not in the mood for something light and sweeter, you should stay clear. If, however, you are in the mood for such a beer, this would be such a beer worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overly sweet, not much sourness/tartness."
"a nice fruity blend here. pours fairly clear, half way between red and brown in color, with a small but lasting off white fizzy head. some yeast floaters and a peculiar density. smells intensely like cherries, some notes of oak and brown sugar too, but primarily a tart cherry nose. flavor is very different from other fruit beers ive had. starts off with a one or two second blast of almost artificial cherry, like a red jolly rancher candy. that sugary sensation fades to a lambic sour/tartness, and then finishes with some notes of vanilla and molasses behind a prominent and robust Belgian yeast. very cool flavor journey. feel is nice, very tart and acidic in the mouth, strong carbonation and a body that hovers in the medium range. not sure i would drink a lot of these, but it was neat to try. definitely one of the finer fruit forward beers out there."
""
"This is a great treat of a beer. An experience in a bottle. While I wouldnt drink this often, its definitely something to try."
""
""
"Flavor profile is what I expect for Liefmans. Sweet, but just sweet enough and not too syrupy (though slightly so). Very smooth feel. Way too easy to drink."
""
"M: Well carbonated with the apple butter bite of sour cherries. A good pairing with flank steak tonight - delicious. An excellent offering from Liefmans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Carbonation is strong, but perfectly so."
""
"Moderate body and highly carbonated with a fairly dry finish, this beer is easy to drink and not too strong, if you can take the sourness."
"O: I'm still getting into sours and I found this one a treat. Great tart cherry notes that aren't too overpowering with a nice bit of oak and funk. Glad to have tried."
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Not too bad. Not as sour as I'd hope, probably b/c of the fresh cherry and cherry juice. The Oud Bruin element is subdued compared to the sweetness but it's still a tasty beer. Just not something I'd reach for before an Oud Bruin or Oud Kriek or the like."
""
"The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Plenty of carbonation - rich and scrubbing - but not too much. Nice. Overall even better than I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very nice fruit beer. I wondered at first is the base was a Lambic. Either way, a tasty beer, though the price keeps me away."
""
"A very nice, somewhat sweet, cherry beer."
""
"Big time guilty pleasure for me right here. Gotta rank among my favorite fruit beers. Mysterious enough to keep savoring, yet easy to enjoy now and even up to a year after the bottling date."
""
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed tring this one especially after having the Goundenband last week. I boast incredibly fresh flavors making you think you just had off the vine picked sweeted cherries, but also enough malt to make it have beer blended in... Cheers!"
""
"O- Just wonderful kriek with just enough sweetness to keep.your tongue going to finish the whoke bottle."
"Overall - Delicious kriek. An excellent compromise between supersweet Lindemans and champagne-dry Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek, bearing in mind that this is not a lambic proper."
"Delicious cherry flavor is multi-layered and quite complex. Tart, refreshing, and all around awesome. This is what krieks should aspire to."
""
""
"Pours a hazy amber to brown-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, mellow sour cherries. In the taste, sour dark cherries and quite fantastic. A sour bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel with a light dry cherry in the aftertaste. Sour cherries and loved it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured a very dark clear amber color and formed an off white slightly pink foamy head that coated that glass with lace as it subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation. An aroma of malt, cherries and chocolate. A flavor of malt, cherries and chocolate. The body is fairly light and the finish sweet yet sprite. Some astringency helps give it a champagne type aspect."
""
""
"O: Not to bad, good for the style"
"Overall: Great beer, one of my favorite when it comes to sours."
""
""
""
"D: I'm not a lambic connoisseur and was worried this would be overtly sweet: it wasn't and I'm left wishing there were more to it, more complexity, more alcohol, more fruit. I wasn't looking for bombastic flavor, but was hoping for more than this. It's been brewed once a year since 1679, they must be doing something right. Interesting that it's a blend of different vintages. Good beer with an amazing history, ultimately left me wanting more."
""
""
"D - Good dessert or summertime drink; nice complex fruit flavors"
"O - Really impressed by this one. Really made cherries the star and was a great end to a night at the bar, I will definitely be looking for this one again soon."
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours a dark brown/red color w/ a one finger off white head. Great carbonation and lacing on my snifter glass. Very dark in appearance- impossible to see through. Nose is very sweet/tart w/ cherries and wood being the primary characters here. A somewhat sour vibe here as well. Taste is very similar, with good carbonation and tartness/sourness in the flavor and feel. Beer really opens up with warming. Really smooth/sweet aftertaste on this one- no sour on the back end of this beer. Really very tasty, and very nice feel. Overall, this is a winner. Highly recommended if you appreciate this style of beer. Cheers."
"25oz bottle. Pours a clear reddish color, with a nice foamy pink cap. Aroma of raspberries, cherries and candy. In the taste, unripe strawberry tartness, sweet cherry preserves and alittle bit sour. Sugary, but nicely mixed in with tart fruity flavors. Very berry, but also fairly complex and very drinkable. A nice treat from Brewery Liefmans."
"Very nice overall; this is a good fruit beer."
"Pours a clear dark cranberry juice color with a 1 inch foamy reddish-white head that fades to a small cap. Foamy streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour unripe cherries and some funky and earthy aromas. Taste is actually pretty sweet with overripe cherries, slight funk and sour flavors, and some earthy wood-like flavors. This beer has a very good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. A bit puckering with each sip and very refreshing. Overall, this is a very good cherry beer that is extremely easy to drink. I killed the whole bottle by myself in less than 5 minutes. A good alternative to the Lindemans fruit lambics."
"O. Pretty good brew. I would recommend this brew to my friends."
"Overall this was a wonderful beer and if it was not 15 dollars a bottle I would run out and buy another."
"O: I appreciate the Oude Kriek more, because of there funk and sourness, but in case there isn't any: this is a very good alternative."
"O-i've noticed that many readliy available fruit bees/lambics are very similar and predictable. this has a great twist on it.i love the tobacco aspect to it, even though i hate tobacco. it also has a good aged aspect to it."
"Is this beer a New Glarus? Nope. Is this beer a Cantillon? Nope. However, is it a Lindemans? Nope, it's better than that. I'm glad to have this around TX and I might have to get another bottle for the girl that's visiting this weekend."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty darn good fruit beer. I personally would like the funk turned up a bit to make it more tart, and add some complexity to the finish, but as it is, it is a good beer and I wouldn't mind drinking it again someday...maybe on tap or something. I am not a huge fan of fruit beers normally, but there is nothing wrong with this one. I would probably start my session with the beer a little warmer next time...maybe 55F?"
"This beer poured out as a deep reddish brown color. The head was fizzy and tan in color. The head faded pretty quickly, not much lacing here either. The smell of the beer was a little funky, but had a lot of cherry in there to balance it out. The taste of the beer was sweet and tart. Really nicely done in my opinion. The mouthfeel was smooth and like a slightly carbonated wine. Overall this was pretty tasty, the whole thing wasn't too sour and it wasn't too sweet either. Just a well rounded brew."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate for the style. Overall it was an excellent cherry flavored beer. The cherries were very fresh and bright and at the same time balanced between sweet and tart. Excellent beer overall and one of my favorite cherry flavored beers."
"Yumm... I'll be ordering this one again for sure (at least whenever I'm fortunate to see it on tap)."
"A new Liefmans... well, giving it a try. The cork says 2010--about a year old, more or less. A vigorous pour generates a small head on top of this dark, ruby-tinted beer, but it quickly disappears--hard to give it a fault there, since lambics often have side-characteristics that make head retention difficult. The aroma offers plentiful sweet cherry aroma, with a moderate tartness. So much for the hope of a real lambic. The taste offers moderately sweet cherries, with a pleasant tartness. It might be a little drier & less sweet than the Liefmans kriek, but I haven't tried any in several years, so not sure. It's not bad, per se--there are certainly sweeter lambics. But it's not what I look for in the style. Certainly, it's not worth the $10 price tag."
"(D)- A nice crisp beer. A good tartness combined with the fruit. Thankfully not overly sweet. A bit straightforward but enjoyable."
"Overall a 4. I really wished this one would bread out and get malty. Eh! my first wife can attest to that."
"Sampled at Julio's Belgian Beer Festival on August 14, 2011. The color is dark amber with a purple-reddish hue a short-lived head. What stands out at first is this extraordinary scent of hard liquor in the aroma. It took a few more sniffs to latch onto the cherries. Maybe they were one in the same as this is a style I do not regularly drink. The body felt thin but smooth. The taste behan with a malty sweetness and concluded with a sour-tart finale."
"A very dark cola looking color. Several fingers of brownish colored head. Lacing is evident. Smell is of sour tart cherries. Fairly carbonated but it is welcome. Taste is in line of smell. A slight bit of sweetness to counteract the tart. I'm not the largest fan of this style but I really thought the experience was pleasant tonight."
"Overall: One of the best lambics I've had."
"D/O - outstanding. It's a great example of the style and is very drinkable. If you liked the old Liefmans kriek, you should like this."
"Overall: I simply love cherry-infused beers, especially those from the Low Countries. The next time I feel like I need one there's a good chance it will be Liefmans Cuvee-Brut again."
"Plus, the cost of this wasn’t too crazy either, especially if you can get it on any kind of special. I think I like this more than some other similar (often sweeter) brews and appreciate that it does keep some residual sweetness without going bonkers. It’s a good in-between when you don’t want Lindemann’s, but you don’t want Cantillon either."
"O: could stand to be a bit drier, but the tartness somewhat covers for the lack of dryness."
"This is totally different than a lot of American cherry beers as the American beers typically focus on sweetness and the Belgians have a more tart feel to them. That being said, this is probably the best tart fruit beer I've had."
"A very dry fruit-forward ale that borrows what's best about Flanders Red Ales and Oude Bruins. True lambics, but with an exciting twist with fruits, woods, and youth."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and I really enjoyed the flavor. Overall I thought this was a very interesting and good beer. I could easily drink a few glasses of this in a row. I recommend giving it a shot. I'd drink it again."
"I am really enjoying pretty much everything I can get from Liefmans. This is certainly not a lambic, but a wonderful fruit beer. Something I highly recommend."
"Pours a hazy, a dark amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of cherry, sweet malt, and slight pale malt. Fits the style of a Fruit / Vegetable beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable tartness. Tastes of cherry, sweet malt, tart malt, and slight pale malt. Overall, good aroma and decent body."
"This beer pours a medium bodied reddish brown with bright red highlights and a barely pink one finger head. It really does look like Goudenband mixed with a Kriek. It smells of slightly tart cherries, cream, and it has a nice cherry pie like sweetness as well. It could be confused for a light Kriek. The flavor is of sweet cherry pie with ice cream or whipped topping with a barely tart finish. It is very flavorful and really does draw you back in for more. The sweetness is well maintained and the tartness is ever so slight but they work well together. It doesn't drink as sticky as it could, which is a good thing. It is medium in bodied and drinks really well. I've been told that this one is ""really, really sweet"" but I didn't think it was too sweet at all. I consider it well balanced and I really enjoyed it. I love Goudenband and this one isn't too shabby at all. I highly recommend trying the Cuvee Brut."
"I am not a fan of really sour beers, or the polar opposite, those extremely sweet Belgian Krieks on the market, this however sits nicely inbetween and I liked it, as did the others in the tasting."
"Poured a dark clear plum color with a large frothy pink head that lasted a little while but left some really nice retention floating on top which allowed for some excellent lacing. The aroma was overwhelming with the scent of cherries and a definite sour or tart odor. It tasted moderatley sweet with a strong cherry flavor in the beginning then became a bit tart with a nice sour finish. Mouthfeel was light in body and dry in texture with a very fizzy carbonation. Overall the flavor was very interesting with sour and sweet melding so nice, giving way to a nice cherry ending."
"Overall- What a great Lambic! Nice sour feel and brewed with all attributes purposely nailed and well executed. I am ready to explore more Liefmans coming up in the near future. Could drink many of these, so I had to move on."
"M. Very tingly on the tongue and the finish just keeps going and going with no sign of stopping. However, that is a double-edged sword, if you want to taste something else without interference for a while, you are up a creek without a paddle. If you are content to taste sour cherries and nothing but, you're golden."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink because the tart and sour flavors are not overpowering. No traces of alcohol are perceptible in the taste."
"Overall, really easy drinking beer. Love the cherries here. I’d definitely drink this again."
"A good fruit beer - would be fun to play around with cheese and dessert pairings for sure."
"Great drinking beer, anytime anyplace. Had on tap at The Ginger man NYC. Dark reddish colour , spider lacey. Smooth, very natural cherry juice taste that is both tart and sweet. Alcohol and cherry aromas, a little oud flemish in the nose. A sipper, but I could have this many more times."
"Drink- This was pretty tasty. I would enjoy this one again if given the chance to see if a bigger or fresher keg would make it a tad better."
"A nice brew, and an example of the beautiful Belgian sour beers that are so classic and well done. With few exceptions, no one does it like them."
"I'm a big fan of Liefmans Kriekbier. Cuvee Brut isn't far off the pace of that, which is to say that this is still a kick ass, cherry dominant beer."
"O: Fantastic beer. Well worth the price of admission ($10 for a 750ml) and worth buying at the store. I can't say that I'd go out of my way to hunt it down, but it is very good beer."
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a deep red with a three finger very slight pink hue head that subsided to two fingers slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, dark fruit, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, raspberries, slight cherry, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Ovearll this was a pretty nice brew. Definitely had a great flavor profile going on here. They were not in-your-face strong which was nice as it made it very enjoyable and drinkable. The funk definitely surprised me quite a bit in a good way. A definite must try on tap if you get the chance!"
"Enjoyable, would have it again, but wouldn't go out of my way. I love the fact the local bar has rarities like this rotate through their taps."
"Taste is sweet-tart cherry, fruit, wood, hints of yeast and mineral, very juicy light sourness. Overall, it has a wonderful, engaging character, some nice complexity of elements underneath the dominant cherry character, and it’s lively and extremely drinkable."
"Poured into my old Liefman's Goudenband chalice with a deep cherry tinted mahogany brown body. The head is a pink tinted light beige color with fine even speckled lacing. Tart cherries within a blend of oud bruin and Goudenband. Excellent blending here tart cherries with hints of wood aging, mild soft oak. Flavor is so balanced with tart cherries/with a brown aged ale going strong underneath. Big bold tart cherries, aged sour brown ale blends, bring out layers of complexity. Not a candy sweet cherry, real tart cherries oak aged notes with a mellow breadiness. Tart lactic acid hints of yogurt but not so sour that it turns your stomach. Effervescent carbonation the body is smooth, rolling layers of complexity. Awesome beer I will be getting more."
"Light malt overwhelmed by a wonderful cherry aroma. Taste of slightly caramelly malt, overshadowed by cherry-sweetness without any bitterness or much of any tartness on the follow. Overall, this is a very nice, if somewhat girly beer."
"D: This was like liquid Luden's. Not difficult to drink if you have a huge sweet tooth, but this is definitely not what I look for in a beer. I wish it had more complexity or bite. Maybe throw in some brett, or at least charred oak for balance?"
"The flavor is mildly puckering and tannic from the start. Berries blossom more and more as it warms. Plum and light oxidized malt character lingers in the background. Acetic acid takes the reigns here. Good smooth and creamy body that coats the palate and lingers after a fairly-full, yet still acidic, finish. All around, an extremely well crafted brew that I'll be looking for a few bottles of."
"D: super easy to drink. overall, it's a fruit beer and a good one at that. interesting complexity from the young and old fruit blends."
"O: If you're looking for a kriek or lambic here, just move along. No thanks."
"D: This one is much better with age. I had some older bottles that had way more sour and complexity. Not terrible but nowhere near what it can be."
"What a wonderful beer to drink. I popped this to enjoy the extra light as we celebrate daylight savings and the end of this terrible winter. Perfect call."
"D - Very easy to drink and a fun beer."
"Lighter body, with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Cherry flavor is pronounced, but not heavy, making this an easy drinker. Very nice here."
"Cuvee Brut is excellent beer. My expectations were tempered, but it delivers. I'm not a cherry fan. Never have been. But this cherry flavored beer is delicious. Go figure. Frankly, I'm stunned at how much I'm enjoying this. I should've known better...this is Liefmans after all. Find a bottle."
"Recommended."
"D-Pretty good."
"Here's hoping that Duvel will return to a ""more traditional"" product with less added sweetener (as they are fully capable of, see Kriekbier) with the Liefmans brands."
"Cheers..."
"D- Decent but I think it could use some age to it. Not overly complex but not bad by any stretch."
"Drinkability - Lambics can get long after 25 ounces but this one just kept calling out my name. It goes down so well and is so efficiently balanced that you could really session this ale. It showed the smoothness of their Goudenband with the distinctive flavors of the kriek. Incredibly well executed."
"A good kriek, and being rather sweet more for dessert than refreshment."
"This one was an impulse buy after hearing of the brewery from a thread on here. The people in that thread suggested the Goudenband, which was on the shelf too. I figure, I will play it safe and get the Cuvee since it is cherry. And I am glad I did. This one is amazing. I will be buying a couple of these to keep in the fridge at all times. Fantastic beer."
"drinkability - while some enjoy wine with dinner i could see myself drinking this beer at every meal or after - now i got to go back to the store and by another bottle"
"D: pretty good for a lambic/sour, but one is enough for a session"
"This is a nice, clean, easy-drinking kriek by Liefmans. Pours an attractive cloudy rose/pink/red color. Nose is cherries with a bit of wood and funk. Flavor follows with a nice fruit beer--it's a bit subtle on the sour for me though. Moderate body, not very dry on the finish. Easy easy drink, pleasant little beer, but nothing to blow you away."
"Had this on tap at Monk's and now again in a bottle. Pretty pink-ruby color with a lingering puddle of head. Smells a bit of vinegar and cherry. Taste is very sweet, lightly of vinegar but the cherries make it just sour enough. Very enjoyable. Light on carbonation. Pretty drinkable."
"D: This is a nice Kriek!"
"My wife really enjoyed it, and it's a done made beer, but too sweet for my palate."
"I think I may like this better than my beloved goudenbom(SP). This exceeded expectations and I drank the whole bottle by myself very easily without a hitch."
"It is cheaper and better than Lindeman's Kriek, a good low-level lambic."
"They say a happy wife makes a happy home so I will rate this well!"
"D: Just a tasty beer. Not a huge complexity from the base Flanders ale, but if you like cherries you'll enjoy this."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle, 2010 stamped on the cork. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a very dark ruby red/purple color with about a half inch light pink head. The brew is dark enough that I can't see through it at all. Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is mostly tart and sweet cherries along with some wood, funk and vinegar. Taste is similar to the aroma, the cherry flavor is a good mix of both sweet and tart, and there's also some wood and funk noticable. However, this brew is all about the cherries. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating with good, soft carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, this brew is very smooth and goes down easy. I like this beer a lot, I might have to buy another bottle and see how this ages."
"Poured a deep cherry red with some brown tint to it. Head left quickly and not really much lacing left on glass. Smelled of Cherry, wood and a bit like a dirt floor basement where I used to live. Taste hits you with a quick tart flavor at first but the majority of it is ripe cherry and a bit of that woodiness. Effervescent but not overly, clean aftertaste and easy to drink quite a bit."
"Drinkability: From the first sniff of this beer I decided I would probably like it. The first sip did nothing to make me change my mind. As I had more of the beer I liked it better and better. This was an easy sipping beer both on its own and with the salad I choose for dinner. Although I'd not want a second right after the first, I'll be having this one again."
"Had a small glass on-tap at Tap and Table. It reminds me of a fruitier Flanders Red Ale with a strong kick of cherries. There was a musty, dusty basement aroma over the fruit and spice. This is a legitimate fruit lambic that pairs the funk and tart feel of Belgian wild yeast with sweet and juicy fruit. The end result is a pleasant, drinkable fruit beer that's both interesting and delicious thanks to the mild barnyard and herbal spicing."
"Very good for what it is. Think of Lindemann's Kriek, but not as cloying."
"Taste is really balanced, it's sour but not killer, the fruit is light and balances it out well. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a nice big mouthfeel. Overall quite good!"
"D: Not one I'd like to drink a lot of, but certainly a good beer to pop when you want to celebrate. My occasion tonight was my Wifes new job offer. Santé!"
"Mouthfeel is great, the sweetness I get in the beer doesnt translate into it being cloying in the mouth at all, light and sharp carbonation provides a certain freshness though."
"Medium body. Sweet up front with a dry finish. Good carbonation. Drinkability is good. Well balanced between sweet and sour. A good example of the style and a great introduction to sour beers."
"D- This is a nice fruit beer. I enjoyed the initial half of the beer more, as the dryness of this one got to me at the end."
"D- An excellent example of the style, refreshing fruits with the anticipating lambic flavours, well balance between sour and sweet."
"An enjoyable enough sour fruit beer, more or less balanced by the complex nature of the cherry fruit itself - the subtle, sometimes sour in their own right side players providing a bit of extra oomph. Edgy, and attractive, sure, yet hardly in the same class as some of their countrymen's more dry and acidic offerings."
"D - I suppose you could drink a lot of these, but it might be a little to sweet to have more than one bottle at a time. 4.0"
"This would be a good beer for a fruit beer fan that wants to check out more sour beer. It isn't in your face sour, but it certainly isn't a sweet beer. Not bad at all."
"I picked up a few sours last time I was through Calgary, and I was craving one tonight, so this guy got the call. It is definitely a let down, though there manages to be some redeeming qualities. In terms of a sour brown/red ale with cherries, the Verhaege Kriekenbier is superior in every way. This is just too damn sweet."
"Very impressive for what it is, a great deal of character for a fruit beer, all that aging and blending does it justice and and validates all that effort. Go get some, if it's available to you it's worth the price of admission."
