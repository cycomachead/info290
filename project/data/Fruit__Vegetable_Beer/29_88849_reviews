"Great beer crisp and clean flavor"
"good beer but way to sweet, maybe serve it with some sharp cheddar cheese to level things off. would drink it again, but wouldn't go out of way to purchase it again,"
"Overall - If you like apples, you can drink one. I wouldn't turn it down if offered so I don't come across as a snob, but I would never buy it."
""
""
""
""
"Great cider definitely will buy again."
"You can really taste the Apple upfront like a cider but then has the finish of a traditional wheat beer"
""
"Just plain awful! Drain pour."
""
""
"Great apple smell, strong apple taste. A bit too bubbly in the mouth. Not very beer like, but ok nonetheless"
"O- This barely qualifies as beer.  This is clearly marketed toward the college crowd looking for something sugary sweet to sip on that'll get them drunk.  What sucks is I can't even cook with the remainder of the beer in my glass I don't want to drink because I can't think of any recipe that would call for candy apple flavored beer."
""
""
"Found this in my fridge from a party back in may (eek). This tastes just like a jolly rancher candy. While I do love sweet girly beers this one is just not my thing. Will not be trying this again"
""
"This apple crips has a wonderful flavor. Can be drank year round. Awesome sitting next to a fire. Can be drank with meals or as an after dinner desert beverage."
"Honestly, this beer just isn't for me, maybe it'd appeal more to someone else's palate but it just smelled sour and fermented(yes, I understand all beer is fermented), and tasted rank not quite sweet like a hard cider and not quite like a wheat beer, the concept just didn't work for me and my palate but hey maybe it'll work for yours."
""
""
"Not as carbonated as a cider. Slightly sour taste. Overall pretty good."
"Very refreshing. The crispness of the Apple is very present."
""
"This is a sweet enjoyable after dinner drink that a non serious beer drinker will find non offensive.  It is apple wheat beer mixed with apple cider.  It has a good taste that is true to the name.  I found it to be a good easy drinker.  While this is a good average beer do not compare it to a cider.  I am a huge hard cider fan and this tastes nothing like Woodchuck Cider or another reputable hard cider product.  Bottom line is that is just a sweet easy drinking average beer that is great for a group of non beer drinkers."

"Bottom line, if you like cider, maybe you'll find it decent enough, but really......just no."

"Overall: They got the apple tartness down, but it's brewed with cider and spices, and it tastes like it. Tastes a bit too much like those packages of instant cider that you add hot water to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.49) : A little more watery than I'd like. The flavor profile could be bolder but what's there is decent. There's sweet and sour apple, with a candy-like sweetness, again like a jolly rancher; and an undertone of wheat. Overall it's an easy drinking, tasty beer. There's never really a bad time for one exactly, but it's like all macros - they have their place but are not exceptional in any category. It's worth picking up a sixer for friends who are beer shy, they may like it."

"Not a bad combination of wheat and apple flavoring. It's one of my favorites from A.B."

"O - not my typical style choice but a good beer nonetheless. taste like apple juice or cider mixed with a wheat beer.  3.5/5"
""
"Overall its not bad.  Its nice to see a variation....obviously its not as good as lots of other wheats...but its not all bad."
""
""
"Overall: This might as well be an apple cider, very little wheat. Still taste and smells good. A nice change."
""
"Poured into a tulip glass. Super sweet jolly rancher smell. Head dissipated quickly to nothing. Very sweet tasted of candy like apples but at the end you can tell its a beer but just subtly. I liked it but after two got a stomach ache."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent apple flavors, kinda of a mix between real and artificial apple flavors.  Overall its really not that bad, a tad to sweet, but expecting worse."

"Overall - This is an ok beer, I prefer the original version of Shock Top in the Shock Top stable.  I would say this is middle of the road."
""
""
"As someone who likes ciders and most Mike's Hard flavors this is horrible, horrible stuff."
""
"Blecchhhhh this thing sucks. Def a no go. Not smooth and an Odd sour candy taste to it"

""
""
"This isn't terrible, and exceeded my low expectations.  A good choice if you're switching around between ciders, alcopops and tutty-fruity wheat beers."
""
"This tasted like either really bad cider or really bad beer. Like budweiser with sour apple jolly rancher hues. Two of them led to an upset stomach and an epic headache the next day. I like most beer on principle and I hate to waste it ever, but the last four of these will get dumped with extreme prejudice. Blech."

"O: better than hard cider, but not a beer I'd go out of my way to order. Inoffensive taste, not great but not awful either. AB is trying to convince people that Shock Top is a craft beer, and that's just not truth in advertising."

""
"This beer pours with a finger and a half, fine-bubbled head. This head is fluorescent white head and dissolves quickly. This beer is a hazy, golden orange color. The nose is completely green apple. The initial taste is a strong, tart green apple morphing into a Jolly Rancher Sour Apple sort of sweet apple flavor. Acid and metal tastes are apparent. Fades to a simple, satisfying wheat flavor finish. It's a nice, crisp beer when you're in the mood for an easy drinking fruit beer."

"Overall a sweet tasty apple drink. Not much in common with beer. Nice sweet apple juice beverage."
""
""
""
"This was very surprising and very good. Usually I enjoy Shiner when I have money and Coors when I don't but this has to be my new favorite beer Apple taste is not overwhelming and I would say kind of in the background of the beer. You do get a beer taste but the apple blends in very well. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this at a party, not a fan of regular shock top but wa inticed by the bright green can. Strong strong smell of apple juice. Tastes completely like jolly ranchers, the sour appeared flavor. Kind of smells like it too. Is this actually beer? I'm pretty sure its just candy."

"Overall - I am stunned by how much I'm enjoying this line of beer. For once, this doesn't seem to be a basic marketing ploy but a genuine attempt at creating a solid beer with flavor, good consistency, and surprise. Sucked this one down in less than five minutes and wish I had another."

"Smells of apples, honeysuckle. Pours hazy orange yellow with super thick white foamy head. Good head retention. Taste is almost pure apple cider, overly sweet. No discernible malt or hops in it! Funky flavored. Think I would prefer regular hard cider or a malternative to this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, nice full head. Developed, white, with good retention and lacing. Appearance was a slightly hazy, golden, honey color. Aroma was of Apple flavored gum with come mild malt notes. Tasted very sweet and gummy, like candy apple. Mouthfeel was syrupy with a very sweet aftertaste. Comes in a nice looking can."

"Overall i don't know what to say here. It's not a wheat beer more of a fake apple cider, with a touch of wheat. It's not bad, but it's far from good. I picked this up as a last minute 1 Am purchase. (in OH alcohol sales stop at 1am). It is what I expected from shock top, not real good but simply"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - for occasion, it's good."
"My opinion of this may be eschew because I'm partial to the flavor and I'm sure it's an additive and not natural flavors but be that as it may I still really like it."

"I don't know what everyone else was drinking that say shock top honeycrisp apple wheat is to sweet. It don't taste anything like woodchuck either. You take REDS apple ale and that stuff is like syrup not even a hint of a beer. Then you wrap your hand around this shock top and you smell the GREEN APPLE smell that reminds you of a green jolly rancher. then when you drink it , you get a cold crisp non bitter taste in your mouth with a nice suttle back taste of that green apple yet the beer taste still comes all the way through. It's perfection compared to any other apple beer I've ever tasted. As a Marine I've traveled the world and had more than my share so I think I'm pretty good judge. Sorry boys gotta call it like I experience it and I don't understand any of the other reviews on this beer they are WAY off."

"Overall, I would recommend this to women who like sweeter drinks and to anyone who wants to start trying beer as an introduction into this. But that would be it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy enough to drink with well hidden alcohol but there is something about the combination of flavors that just does not quite mixed correctly in my opinion - shockingly sweet cider with a slightly pasty Belgian yeast + wheat flavor."

"O-it smell like a granny smith apple, then taste like a sweet red apple that end up leaving a honey aftertaste"
"O: This beer is easy to drink but tastes more like a candy than a Belgian-inspired wheat beer."

"As a previous reviewer noted, despite heavy agitation and an aggro pour, I still only developed a pinky finger of eggshell-white head. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose smelled of apple cider, so points for truth in advertising. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and it had a very apple cider flavor in the mouth. The spices lent it an apple pie quality, and it was actually pretty good. Finish was semi-sweet with the spices keeping it from being an outright sugar bomb. This one and the other of my share will be just about the right amount for this hophead. It was a novelty and I do not regret my purchase, but two is enough."
""
"Overall: I have had worse."
"Poured from bottle into a cup. Didn't expect to like it. Appearance is a brownish yellow with a surprisingly thick head. Smell was unappealing. Taste was too artificial. Strong apple, little wheat. Mouthfeel was the best quality of this beer. Overall: drank half and got a stomach ache."
""
"The feel is about right for this beer. It's light, it's crisp and it feels as much like a hard cider as it smells and tastes. It has a nice, crisp bite without being too terribly spritzy, though it starts off leaning that way. A little slickness comes through in the middle but fortunately cuts out."
"Obviously it tasted like apple, but less like good cider, and more like overly floral, cheap apple wine that had been carbonated. Reminded me of Applejacks cereal, but in a bad way - this was bad Applejacks infused BMC Light Lager"
""
""
""
"O: Just drink cider, ya dummy."
""
"Wouldn't really purchase again, but the apple flavor was nice."
""
"As someone else said to describe this it taste just like green jolly rancher.. For me it would be hard to stomach more than one of these. It is for an aquired taste... poured slightly clear for a wheat. It is definitly a shock on the palate with a sour taste. Dont really get the honey taste. little fizzy head. try it its either a love it or hate it. Mayne ok if paired with the right meal."
""
"Not bad considering I'm not usually a big fan of ""apple"" in a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clouldy yellow color with a small white head that fades to nothing quickly. No lacing. Smell is strong with apple and nothing else. Taste was much the same as smell like sour apples. Not bad if you want a light hard cider but I wouldn't classify it as a beer."
""
""
""
""
"I like this one it has mild apple taste. Most appealing is the gluten free as I have a friend who has issues with gluten so we can drink this together. Its much better cool but not refrigerator cold. We had this on summer day and it was very refreshing and not heavy like some beverages can be. For me this is great Grilled food Beer."

"The Verdict: Not bad. Sweeter than most ciders, this is more of a candy apple flavored ale."
""
""
"I love beer. I love apple cider. I've liked every apple beer I've tried. Except this one. It smells ok, like apples and cider. The look was ok- it had a decent coloring and was similar to what I would expect of a similar beer. The taste was what got me. It didn't taste like honey crisp apples- it tasted like green jolly ranchers. It was surprisingly unpleasant and saccharine. In addition, there was a bitter note at the end of every sip that wouldnt disappear. If I could, I'd return the rest of the six-pack. Don't waste your money on this. There are much better apple beers out there."
""
""
""
"Dear gods and little fishes, this is dreadful. Don't avoid it, run away from it screaming like it just dropped a bucket of cockroaches in your hair."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this beer serves a purpose, and would be refreshing for spring or summer days. Definitely drinks more like a cider as the wheat aspect is overpowered by the sweetness of the apple"
""
"For those people who Enjoy ""Fruit Beers"" and have a bit of an Open Mind,do yourself a favor and check out this Beer,it is 'Seasonal"" so you cannot get it year round,the more Traditional Beer Drinker may have a tough time with such a Fruit Forward Beer of this type,and may want to steer clear of this one,and probably All ""Shock Top"" Fruit Beers because they are VERY Fruit Forward,and probably way too over the top for a lot of people,but I Like that,and I LOVE this Beer~Cheers and Peace2All:)"
""
""
""
""
""
"I am drinking this beer right now as I'm writing this review and even though I'm still a novice when it comes to beer, I can say this is easily my favorite beer. Very smooth, easily drinkable and great taste. Not bitter at all. It's definitely something I'll have to buy more often."
""
"Up front the smell was okay, not so bad. Mouth feel was what you would expect from a cider of this type; a bit dry, nothing special. Now the taste: Okay, either I just got a bad bottle, or this clearly just isn't my thing, but this was awful; I couldn't even get half the bottle down. Would not try again."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured into a pint glass."
""
"No comment on appearance since I did not really note the color when I had this (late review). In terms of smell the only thing I can think of to describe it is jolly rancher green apple. Overly sweet, artificial, and overpowering. Smelling it is almost like doing a rail of ""apple"" flavored sugar cocaine. No hint of beer at all. More of a juice than anything. If you made me smell this and didn't tell me what it was I would think It was some new sugary kids drink. The taste is just as overpoweringly sweet. Think candy juice spiked with sugary. I will try and finish just about everything and I like my sweets just as much as the kid down the street, but to me this is just too much. Almost didn't finish this. Have a few more bottles laying around that I unfortunaly may pour down the drain."
"Overall not terrible, but not great. It might be competing with the apple ales (Red's) and apple ciders (Angry Orchard) on the market."

"Overall Drinkability: A decent fall beer."
"Overall: Not the best beer I have ever had, not by a long shot. I would say that this was better than Shipyard's Applehead, but I think if I am going to buy something apple, I will just buy a good hard cider."
""
""
"This beer is really for people who may like that apple taste to their beer. I bought the Shock Top variety case and this one was part of the batch. The best way to describe this beer was like drinking a Jolly Rancher Apple. I feel it smelled like a jolly rancher too. I personally didn't like it but some other people may love it. I just gave it an average rating to be fair. I didn't like it."
"Palate, disappointing...nothing wrong with it really, it tastes exactly like how it should, excellent blending in fact...I just now don't think cider belongs in a wheat beer, I think blending it with a light ale would have done better."

"I only have a few beers a month, so I am not an expert by any stretch of the imagination. However, this is one of the very few beers I have had that I would rate as genuinely awful -- bad enough to warrant my first full review (woo-hoo!). I cannot make a hard and fast assessment of the color, appearance, or lacing, as I had this straight from the bottle. The dominant, pervasive, and lasting impression, both smell and taste, is that of an alcoholic Jolly Rancher, the green apple flavor. I have had the regular Shock Top Belgian Wheat in the past and found that to be an acceptable brew in the face of limited options, so I was pretty disappointed by this variant. A hint of fruit flavor is nice, but the Anheuser-Busch people went way over the top on this one. I won't be giving it a second chance."

"edit: not so good from the bottle. while the apples are still really fresh and snappy and authentic, the sugar is just way too much. one bottle is doable, but a night on these is an awful idea resulting in diabetic hangover and tooth decay. one is the right dose, any more is too much. i wish this was dryer, way better at the source, but still genuine fruit flavor."
""
"She was not interested in finishing this one which we both agreed was an overly-sweet cider beverage."
""
""
""
"The appearance is very bright and radical. The smell is the that of a sour apple jolly rancher. The taste is okay of course like that of an apple however the aftertaste is pretty bland and well below other comparable comparisons. It was nice to try an individual bottle but improvement could definitely be made. 156 Calories, 5.2% ABV. Sam Adams Cherry Wheat remains the top for me in this category."
""
"If you enjoy the apple beers this offering is right up your alley. As soon as you open the bottle, a whiff of apple fills the room. I am not always a fan of ""fruit"" beers but I would purchase this again. This brew goes down pretty smoothly and if the price is right you should definitely give it a try."
""
"I like what ABInBev was thinking here although this is a beer that I won't be able to finish this bottle. I can see casual craft fans getting their toes wet here but the sweetness is too much for me."
"good for a wine cooler, bad for a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a nice addition to a party to please everyone and is just plain tasty."
"D - Not surprisingly the green apple dominates and there really isn't much else going on."

"served from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a slightly cloudy golden tan. Bright floral and apple scents, smells very refreshing. Tastes crisp and apple tart, with a slightly lingering malty finish. Feels fairly carbonated and fresh in the mouth, a slight oily feel afterwards that isn't entirely welcome. Overall this is a really nice refreshing beer, well balanced with the apple and the malt tastes. Normally not a fan of fruit beers or Shock Tops, but I thoughly enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"The clouded golden hue with rocky white textured head makes this beer then comes a rush of Honey Crisp Apples at the grocer in town they cost 3.69 a lb what a deal that the sixer is only 8 bucks or so. A beautiful mix of apple cider and chalky white Belgian style yeast, I think I'm in love. It's that good smells of fresh apple skins with the charming characters that we all want in a beer which I found would be refreshment. Flavor comes correct with apple skins and a fresh juicy honeycrisp note...slight hints of cinnamon laying flat with brown sugared apples this beer tastes great. Not many Shock Tops make me turn my head this is one with a drying apple cider effect that I have been enjoying since I found it's magic."
""
""
""
"Thanks to the canquest creator woodychandler for tis beer. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Yes, that's correct, bottle. Even Woody gets a surplus of those sometimes. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of apple cider. Taste has plenty of apples, slightly tart, not much else but tasty and very drinkable. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall I did enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall I think the concept is a good idea, but the execution isn't quite there. This isn't a terrible beer by any means, but it is a seasonal specialty at best. With that said, I'd drink another one if it was around. With so many great beers so choose from, I don't see myself buying another sixer."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is mainly of apple cider and green apples with maybe a hint of grains. Taste is much the same with more of the grain and some spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average ""beer"" that is much more like a cider or an alcopop than beer."
""
""
"O: I totally get this point of this product, combining a sweet apple cider with a generic witbier - the problem is it tries to be everything to everyone, and as a result, doesn't do either the cider or the beer aspect well enough to appeal to discerning craft beer/cider drinkers (plus the whole ""it's made by AB-InBev"" thing). Not bad for a malternative, though."
"Source: Purchased at Wal-Mart in Texas as a selection of a Brewmaster's Choice build-your-own six-pack for $8.99."
""
"Very refreshing, but not very beer-like."
"Well, this is definitely an apple ale. There's no doubt about it. Unfortunately, I'm not getting any of the spices mentioned on the label. This definitely isn't for me, but it does achieve what it sets out to do. This is a light, refreshing offering that will satisfy your typical fruit-beer drinker or cider drinker."
""
"Surprisingly not bad. The smell stood out to me and was fantastic. I'm a huge fan of Martinelli's sparkling apple cider and this reminded me of that. The flavor was nice. Apple forward. Ends dry. For some odd reason I kept getting whiskey notes and some heat as I swallowed. For 5.2% I shouldn't notice any heat at all. But I got some. Slightly heavy for me, I like really light wheat beers and this was too heavy for my liking. However, it wasnt an offensive mess like the raspberry wheat and it's not something I'd turn down. Especially in the summer. I wouldn't rush to buy a 6 pack of it, but if there's nothing at the bar or at a BBQ, why not?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a simple fruit beer, but pretty good. The wheat flavors brings it back into the beer realm from the juicy apples flavors that had me thinking it was basically a hard cider."
"I walked into my local beer distributor the other day and smelled apples. Lo and behold, there on tap was Shock Top Honeycrisp Apple Wheat. I poured myself a glass and had a look. It looked like fresh cider. Not much head. And it smelled like apples, even more so than fresh cider. It was sweet and it tasted like apples, albeit fake apples. I didn't find much wheat, and I didn't find much spice (some light cinnamon, and maybe some vanilla). In fact, I didn't find it much like beer at all. Still it was interesting and I knew my wife would like it. And since I was headed to an outdoor party I considered it quite seriously. In the end I passed it by, but I will consider it in the future. I could see it as an interesting beer to have on-hand at Thanksgiving."

" Overall- Shockingly amazing. Shockingly delicious with apple flavour"
""
""
"O - It's a fine cider but not at all a witbier. Maybe a fruit beer."
"O - Umm...I'm not even sure how I feel about this. Is it bad? No, not exactly. As a beer...it makes a pretty decent cider. But since I wanted a beer, I'd have to say it fails. Seems like an AB attempt to ""trick"" people into drinking cider??"
""
"could not be happier with a random loose beer I got to try the other day. The Honeycrisp Apple Wheat for shock top smells perfect and tastes even better. I could not have had a better first taste of a beer in my entire life. The apple is a slight hint but a nice fresh aftertaste. highly recommended and a must try!"
""
""
"O: I feel like this COULD be an interesting beer if the jolly rancher sweetness wasn't present throughout the nose and taste. It overpowers anything else the beer is trying to do, and gets cloying after a couple. The cider has a nice influence, but again, it's just overpowered by the sweetness. Aside from being brewed with wheat, there really aren't much wheat characteristics either... Leave this one for the faux crowd"
""
""
""
"Overall: It's not bad. I would have appreciated something more than a dominating apple flavor. I realize it's mixed with cider, but if the cider's going to utterly dominate the ale I'd just as soon drink cider. I'm a fan of fruit beers but I don't see the point of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Flavor-wise, this beer is nothing like a wit. I would recommend it to people who like very strong fruity sodas, like Fanta, fruit flavored Jones Soda, or fans of Jolly Ranchers. I like fruit beers, but this one is way over the top."
""
"Great color out of the bottle, small head but with good lacing. The smell just blew me away, it was pure honey and apples, so much so you might think you we're drinking one of those hard ciders but with better taste. I like the carbonation on this one and was glad to find there was little aftertaste. The beer is deceptive, be careful or you'll end up guzzling it thinking it were apple juice. Overall, I scored it a bit low since this is a beer rating site and it ended up being more of a hard cider like I mention above rather than a fruit flavored beer."

"Drinks fairly easy, but a bit too sweet/fake for my liking. This would do me fine in the summer in a pinch. but only for one or 2 at the most. Certainly not a wit"

"O - I might be alone on this one, but I really dig this Shock Top. It's got a ton of real honey crisp apple flavor (once again, my favorite variety of apple by far) with nice little spice notes and a crisp, clean finish. It's almost cider-like but has enough malt and wheat character to keep it grounded as a beer, though not a witbier. It's probably the fastest I've finished my review bottle and I'm (surprisingly) sad I don't have any more. If this is around in the summer time, it would just kill it."

"The cider flavor, which is this beers biggest distinction and strength also doubles as its weakness. I might buy it again for a varied social gather or on a rare occasion, but this is not a beer I would typically like to chill with. It's much more like a hard apple cider."
"Overall I was pretty indifferent about this beer. i didn't love it, but it wasn't horrible, I think it's a pretty average example of the style, I wish the wheat base stuck out a little more and was cleaner and the apples could be toned down a little. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, but it was a little too sweet for me and the flavors didn't hold my attention for long at all, one is enough for me before it's time to move on to something else. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was nice and I liked the extra carbonation, it worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that the wheat base wasn't better and stuck out more, it was more of an artificial apple bomb than a wheat beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's cheap, but it really isn't anything I enjoyed and I might recommend it to Shock Top lovers, but that's it. All i all I wasn't a big fan of this beer, it wasn't horrible but it didn't have enough quality's to convince me this was a decent Wheat beer. I like that Shock Top is trying new things, but this one didn't work out. better luck next time."

"Not bad...enjoyable but definately not a session beer. A little too sweet and cloying if you have more than 3 or 4. Definately an interesting brew! Cheers!"

"O - wouldn't buy again"

"Overall, this is very drinkable and while certainly not the most flavorful beer I've had, it's not tasteless or bad by any means."

"Can't wait for the Macintosh and Granny Smith spinoffs. Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy brass-straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises red apple flesh, lightly-funky wheat, and a very light whiff of what may or may not be a mixture of vanilla and cinnamon (reminds me of my favorite air freshener...). The taste brings in more of the same, along with a vein of mild orange zest. The wheat's funk increases near the finish. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, kinda surprisingly not that bad, though I can see how the apple flavor can be a bit much for some people. Though I didn't totally like or dislike this stuff, I will say I found it enjoyable enough where I wouldn't necessarily turn down a free follow-up bottle."
"Cheers!"

"Not really a witbier. I'd probably rate this respectably as an American Pale Wheat Ale. The girlfriend loves it, but this just isn't for me."

"Bought this at a local chain grocer in Hillsboro, NH being a slight fan of STs' other brews (bud hasnt completely screwed it up yet) and was pleasantly surprised...after the raspberry, most of them have been pretty meh. But for a cheap beer for the masses (which i normally despise) its not bad. I suppose if im down to my last 8$ and want a dwcent 6er id buy it again."

"This pours a hazy yellow color with a slight, white head. There is a strong scent of granny smith apples with a slight hint of wheat. The initial flavor of this beer is more like a hard cider with a sweet, tangy, apple taste. It isn’t until well after swallowing you begin to get a beer taste from it. It finishes rather chalky and slightly sour. This is really more of a cider than a beer folks."

"Surprisingly, I enjoyed this one much more than I thought I would. Perhaps my expectations were set too low to begin with. It lacks a big flavor punch, but it's still pretty taste and it's not cloyingly sweet or menacing. I could actually see this working better in the summer time, not sure why it was released in January."

"Overall- This is more cider like in nature then beer like. It is sweet and apple heavy in flavor with light hints of wheat and yeast. If you are looking for something cider like then this is not a bad go to."
""
"Overall, reminds me of a cider, with less tartness. Spices are reminiscent of winter brews, but not as bold."
