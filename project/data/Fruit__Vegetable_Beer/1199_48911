Being from Michigan myself and aware of the heritage of cherry growing in the state, I really wanted to like this a lot but I can't honestly say I do.

Like the nose suggested it was filled with a variety of grains in the flavor alongside muted cherry fruit character, malty sweetness, hints of citrus and a touch of juice.

I eat cherries fairly often and that's what I traste - natural cherry. I get natural sweetness, and I also get that mouth-watering tartness that cherries have. I also get wheat beer characteristics, and just enough floral hop to really add an unexpected balance and depth. I think this is heads and shoulders above any wine cooler or flavored malt beverage - it'a cherry fermented ale, just like it says on the label.

Some berry-jam-like aromas, along with the smallest amount of tart aroma. Part of it smells like a White Zin...which I find strange. Taste is very fruity at first...with a somewhat off-putting metallic flavor. Slightly tart, but nothing along the lines of a sour beer. Much more sweet. Sweet cherries, with some other berry flavors. This is one damn tasty fruit beer. More cherries in the finish, with a slight, tingly-tart finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very nice carbonation for this style. Drinkability is high. Overall, fruit beers are not really my thing, so I am trying my best to rate this for what it is. Honestly though, I really enjoy it. I enjoy it a lot more than other fruit beers I have had.

3.51,-3,4,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a slightly hazy, deep, ruby coloring with no head whatsoever. Aromas of a slight roasting and a watered down, subtle cherry tartness. It almost smells like when you make Jell-O, and have to boil water and add it to the mix pack. That initial smell when the water hits the powder, only from a couple of rooms away...that's what this smells like. Flavors are rich and deeply sweet, with a solid cherry flavor, definitely more maracino than black. Only a subtle tartness in the palate, and the beer refrains from getting into the sugary or syrupy realm. This brew has legit fruit flavors. The beer is thin, and with a slight carbonation it has a very crisp feel in mouth. Sweet, moderate aftertaste that has an even fade as the palate clears. Extremely clean finish. This beer is completely different from what I was expecting. Not bad.","GarthDanielson","Sep 28, 2012"

The head is but a skim of white bubbles that leave sheets of lacing on the sides. Carbonation seems well accounted for by the bubbles running to the top, but overall the beer is too dark and cherry-murky to look through. The beer smells surprisingly more malty than anything else, there is a good bready-biscuity background to the beer and the sweet metallic tang of the cherries is definitely present, and some very subtle pear-like esters from the yeast. The beer tastes sour and mellow with a nice puckering sweet dancing bellow all else in the beer. The malt is present as a slight biscuity taste, and the pear esters are definitely present, but the cherries are the main event here and they play out nicely leaving a sour pang your mouth and little else. The cherries tart does have a slightly metallic tinge to it, like sucking down iron which detracts slightly from the beers drinkablility, though overall the beer is very nice to sip or chug. Mouthfeel is smooth and mellow with a slight thickness to the beer and a little carbonated prick, but overall very refreshing and mellow on the tongue. There is some slight saliva running in the tongue and a light puckering sour pang, but other than that the mouth is very clean. Overall this is a nice fruit beer. It is above average, but not by that much. I’ve had this on tap before and I felt like the malts and cherry played nicer there than they do when poured from a bottle. A great, slightly sour, fruit ale that is a nice to drink on a warm summer day. This won’t sweep you off your feet but its worthy of going back for a few more.","Maxwell","Aug 27, 2012"

Bready, substantive, meal-like. Can't find a bitter note in the 15 IBU's either (I know, they aren't supposed to be there!).

The taste is incredibly reminiscent of cherry pie. The Cherry flavor it gives off is akin to that of canned cherries, with its surgery sweetiness and tart almost sour finish. The malt in this beer gives it a nice grainy buttery feel which is really what wraps it all up to be like cherry pie. I have tried quite a few vegetable/fruit beers in my time, and I know many people including myself who don't normally enjoy them. However this is a beer that I would definitely recommend to all beer geeks, it is just executed so very well. The taste isn't nearly overwhelming like in many fruit flavored beers and I'm honestly quite confused as to why founders decided to put this beer in a 4pack rather than a 6 pack. The low alcohol content combined with the balanced and deliciously refreshing flavor would make this beer very sessionalbe to those people such as myself who enjoy it so much.

3.92,8.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I'm surprised I haven't had this before, but Cerise is pretty tasty. It's like Wisconsin Belgian Red-lite. It's glowing orange, hazy amber with almost no head. The beer smells clove-y and spicy with a lot of yeast character and a little bit of bruised cherries. The beer is malt-forward with a slightly tart, bing cherry flavor that permeates throughout the finish is a little sweet with a fruitiness that lasts. It tastes much better than it could've been and I really enjoyed having as a before bed treat. It's sometimes tough to find just the right beer to end the night. This was a pretty good choice, I'll definitely be seeking this out again.","Soonami","Oct 26, 2011"

I poured the 12oz bottle into a pint glass to find a nice reddish orange body with a small white head. The aroma was sweet with a few hints of cherry, malt , and a bit of sourness. The taste was good, the cherry flavor was not as strong as I expected but the cherry flavor was done just right. There is a nice balance of tartness, sweetness and some funk. This wasn't very complex and was a pretty straight forward beer. There was a decent amount of carbonation for this medium bodied beer that also left a bit of cherry aftertaste.

The beer didn't seem to change a whole lot other than the flavor a little bit. The beer still poured out as an interesting looking golden color. The head was white and lasted for a while. The smell of the beer has some tart cherry aromas coming off of it. The taste is a mix of sweet and tart cherry it seems. It's sweeter when it's fresh but leaves a sharp tart flavor in the aftertaste. When the beer is a little older it tastes more sour I think. The mouthfeel is a well carbonated and fairly drinkable.

Nice head and a bit of lacing. BAM. The smell was awesome. I like fruity beers and was hoping this was like I found it to be. Nice and fruity smell but not so overpowering or sweet of a cherry taste. I did have one bit of off flavor so that's why I gave the taste a 3.5 instead of 4. Cherry, hops and a touch of malt. Very light sweetness if any. Easy drinking. Glad I tried it.

Some fairly thick lacing is present on the glass as well. Aromas of tart cherries, peach, breadiness and a bit of funkiness and spiciness. Pretty nice aromas, though a tad weak. Taste of big tart cherries, with breadiness, spices, and big sweetness in the back. Wow, this actually tastes just like cherry pie. Fairly dry finish, but some tart cherries, spiciness, and breadiness does stick around for a bit. Medium carbonation and body. Very drinkable as well, with no alcohol noticed other than a small warming after the finish. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it is Founders, and they pretty much have never let me down. Excellent stuff, I might have to pick up a 4 pack before they are gone for the season.","superspak","0"

I'd've liked a little more tart cherry flavor, there is a bit, but most of it is drowned out in the excess of maltiness.

I thought there was more in there, but I'm getting nothing now but these bakery items. Odd, kinda, but not really bad at all. The taste, of course, is dominated by the cherries as well, but here they are more sour, more medicinal, almost fake-tasting. Behind the cherries, there's a hint of nutmeg, coriander, and some very soft caramel. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation and a gooey (read: not really sticky, but not really not, either) feel.

The malt is formidable with some caramel, along with some biscuit flavors. There is quite a bit of cherry presence, sharp, a little acidic and sweet. And then it closes back in on the biscuit, like a cherry-biscuit (I don't know if any bakers make that, but they should). The body is medium to medium full with good carbonation.

This one has a cherry taste that sneaks up on you. For the first two seconds after you sip there's nothing....and then it just explodes in your mouth (Sounds like a Tobias Funke line....). There's just enough sour at the end to cause a slight pucker (Maybe I should carry a tape recorder around and listen to myself....). This is great! Super light mouthfeel, which is a bit of a downfall. If it was a bit heartier, it'd be a top 5 for me.

The beer gets more and more refreshing as I continue to quaff. Mouthfeel is thin, but it works well. I think a thick bodied beer would get tiring and cloying with this amount of cherry flavor. Drinkability is very good - I find myself wanting another.","aaronh","Oct 18, 2009"

The tartness is more pronounced in the flavor. It is rather natural tasting and there is a little malt flavor, but it seems to be here mostly for structure. It finishes dry (thankfully) with a little bitterness on the back of the tongue. I don't care to drink more than this one as I am craving more traditional beer flavor.

At any rate this stuff tastes great which is almost unheard of when brewers start throwing fruit in their beer. Although you won't find the seamlessness or pure synergy of fruit and beer as in the case of Bell's Cherry Stout, you will get a very clean beverage showcasing natural tasting fruit rather than a sort of fruit "esscence" superimposed on a weak, off-tasting American wheat. Cerise wouldn't be a bad choice to have a couple of, it certainly goes down without a fight. I can also pleasurably imagine finishing off a night with this brew.","PatrickJR","Jun 16, 2009"

Not too sweet, just right. Nice malt base, and what I think is cinammon to go with the graham crackeryness. It's a little thin through, as to be expected, but very drinkable.

Finishes sweet with a cherry aftertaste. Nothing surprising in the flavor. A little bit of a sour/funky component would work well with this beer. Light body with a slightly fizzy carbonation.

There is a little malt detectable in the background, but it is really all about the cherries. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture.

The ruby grapefruit body looks so natural. The off pink head sits beautifully ontop and drops lacing with each sip. The aroma is faint zest with a flash of acidity. The taste is a rollercoaster ride. Light, crisp zest hits sweet cherry flesh back to a zingy acid bite. The cherry flashes from tart, to sweet, to subsiding zing. This ale showcases brewer talent. In a world of starbuckesque, flavor shot fruit beers; this one marches to its own accomplished drum. To the man behind Founders; I salute you!","SeanRedd","May 22, 2009"

I don't know if I would want more then one, but on a hot day as your first drink for the evening this will do you quite nicely. If you want to rip it because it doesn't really seem like a beer, I suppose I can understand. To me, it was a fun and refreshing experience.","SwiftyMcBeer","May 22, 2009"

Subtle notes of cherry yogurt, candied sugar, bubble gum, and candied apples in the nose. Forceful flavors coat the tongue: light cherry puree and then sour candied sugar zest breaks through; conquers, burns, pillages the palate and leaves behind a sweet-sour note that sticks around. Light and a bit dull in mouthfeel; a light body strawberry daiquiri. Wise choice to sell in 4 packs, the fruit zest can overwhelm a palate if drank over a long period of time.

Its just right, not spritzy and not so low as to give this one a thick and medicinal cough syrup quality. This one is easy to drink and is quite quaffable, though if quaffed it becomes less interesting and its much more difficult if not impossible to pick up the diacetyl in here that really adds to the beer. This is one that I'd buy again. Not a bad deal at $9.99 a four-pack, hey the abv is 6.5% and its an easy drinker. Great for the summer and spring, fall and winter....no.

Very refreshing and finishes sweet but tart - good balance. Alcohol is unnoticeable. Reminds me of my grandma's cherry pie.

The head is very thin and loose, but the carbonation is very vibrant, bubbles fly all through the beer and cling to the side of the glass. The smell has a very deep bready sweetness. The cherries are faint, somewhat medicinal, but the fresh grain, barley, maybe wheat are very strong. I kind of hoped there would be some tartness, but I don't sense it in the smell. The taste delivers though, I'd say. Really is quite like cherry juice, some tartness, then a very nice pleasant maltiness, bready, sweet, but not cloying. The cherry taste is not like cough syrup, like I expected, but instead just delivers on the cherry. Reminds me of those tart cherries, not the dark sweet ones, but the yellowish-orange ones. I'm really liking it. The mouthfeel kind of clings with its sweetness, and it sort of reminds me of cola. The carbonation is spot on. At points it gets kind of thin. You kind of expect a fruit beer to be tart (at least I do, like the dry sour kind of beers). But this one really works, with brilliant fruit flavor without being either too sweet or too dry. It drinks very quickly, and the 6.5% won't hit you too quickly if you just have one. Though I could imagine drinking a few more if I had them. I would recommend it.","taylorhamrick","Apr 25, 2009"

Appearance is like ruby red grapefruit juice with a light pink tinted head, fine bubbly carbonation forms evenly with lacing down the sides of my glass. Aromatics offer up tart cherries more so the peels bringing alcohol and sweetness together along with the smell of evident grain infused within potent tart cherries. Flavor is excellent it lands some where between a sour ale and some cherry flavor jam. Reluctantly sweet and sour is thrown my way, but in the mix I find cherry peels carrying some booziness and some light cereal grains blending so well with the juices of mother nature. What an excellent blend touch of vinegar like acidity in the lightest vinegarette imaginable. Sweet syrupy layers of cherry sweetness quickly fade to dry tartness excellent creation very interesting like cherry cider. Great stuff I remember Rubaeus, right up there with that fruit ale. Founders doesn't offend I detect real fruit with a balanced profile mouthfeel is light at times with a reduced simple syrup border at times. Carbonation is perfect that's where everything carries out so well, quite the experience here. Girls will dig it and beergeeks will try and figure out how they did it.

They either dominate completely or leave an unpleasant sour sensation that clashes with the main body of the beer. This one, however, has just enough cherry essence to be distinctive without it completely taking over. In all, an excellent summer beer. If you like Duchesse de Bourgogne or Rodenbach Grand Cru, this'll be right up your alley.","BarrelO","Apr 23, 2009"

That's the dominating flavor and after that I'm not getting much else. The beer coats the mouth with sweetness and goes down smooth and easy. I usually don't like fruit beers and this doesn't really change my opinion, but it's one of the best I've had so far. It actually has some real fruit flavor instead of having some fake syrupy taste.

Poured into my shaker glass and appears a hazed color akin to blush wine with about a finger of light pink foam. The head fades to a thin layer within a few minutes leaving a slight lace on the inside of my glass. Smells and tastes of bread, cherry pie filling, tart cherries, cherry pie, crust and all.

I opened this one (the first one in the 4-pack) after a long day and was worried that a fruit beer like this might not satisfy my fix. I am not usually a fan of fruit beers but this one is top notch.

Toasted grains and pie crust malt follow, before the sweetness comes in. Fruit punch and cherry sweetness swells, pushing any tartness aside. Finish brings in some cherry pits, and faint bitterness. Lingering tartish cherries. Medium-bodied, with a creamy feel. Not a bad cherry ale, in the vain of New Glarus's Belgian Red. This one is not quite as good, but is decent.

A light bodied beer, drinkability loses a few points for the sometimes overbearing sweetness. Not a bad effort from Founders.

Certainly balanced towards sweetness, bitterness was light and really only noticeable up front. Sour cherries and sugar/caramel became prominent mid-palate and sweetness increased into the finish. There was a hint of crackery malt and some tartness towards the end. Medium bodied with carbonation slightly less than average, a bit viscous. Not bad overall.

I think the taste is OK for what it is, but fruit beers are usually not my thing. Sweet upfront and a little tart in the aftertaste. Medium body and easy drinking (so long as you like cherry pie).
