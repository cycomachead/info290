Smooth balanced lager with a mild sweetness from the strawberries coming through at the end.  No bitter aftertaste or malt drink weirdness. Light body with light carbonation that is easy to drink. A good summer beer.","OKbrew89","Mar 31, 2015"

There is only a faint hint of strawberry but a strong bread yeast smell to it.  The taste is where things get better.  More of a bold strawberry but again not a huge presence.  Suffice it to say I do not find it very sweet.  It is a pleasant beer to kick back and drink with non beer friends.  I enjoy having one of these for an easy drink on a hot day.  I will purchase another 6 pack for such occasions.","VTR","Mar 18, 2015"

Aromas of strawberry but a bit on the subtle side. Light spice, lemon, and just a touch of yeasty funk. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Yeasty wheaty with a hint of lemon and funk with a solid hit of strawberry to add a bit of complexity. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Nice fruity light easy drinking summer ale, I quite enjoyed it.","johnnnniee","Jul 08, 2014"

The beer looked like a lite beer when poured. Not a lot of color or thickness to it. Not much to offer to the nose which was a little disappointing, no fruit smell and not much else. Flavor was also a disappointment, kinda like rotten strawberries in a cheap beer. From a guy who likes fruit beer this is one that I will not buy again and would only drink if I was on a quantity night.","JamieDuncan","May 30, 2014"

The first pour was a happy surprise as the beer was a nice golden hue instead of a fake red dye or something. I gave a sniff and was able to pick up on the abundance of strawberries, but also the wheat and barley which immediately screamed spring to me. The taste was smooth with a nice amount of strawberries through out. The mouthfeel was a bit thin but overall I really liked this beer. If you are a staunch opponent to fruity beers than this probably isn't the beer that will change your world view, but it is very nice.","WhiteHillsStore","0"

Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger moderately dense and rocky light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big ripe strawberry, strawberry jam, wheat, shortbread, cream, and light floral. Nice aromas with authentic strawberry notes and moderate malt presence; with solid strength. Taste of ripe strawberry, strawberry jam, wheat, shortbread, cream, and light floral. Lingering notes of strawberry, wheat, shortbread, and cream on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of strawberry and malt flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a nice fruited lager style. Good balance and robustness of strawberry and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 17, 2013"

I love the light airy quality of all of Abita's beers (as a Louisiana native, I can testify that it has a LOT to do with the amazing water quality in Abita Springs - where their other major industry is bottled water). The clean crisp refreshing flavor of an Abita Strawberry harvest is absolutely delightful. Not to mention the strawberries are fresh from one town over and leave a very strong strawberry aftertaste in one's mouth. I am thankful that this ""seasonal beer"" is usually lingering on the shelves for about half of the year.","daniellebelle","Aug 01, 2013"

Instead of the fruit collaborating with the other flavors, this ""beer"" really doesn't have much in ways of hops or malt. It has some wheat flavors and grain, but that is all overpowered by the strawberry. The mouthfeel is its main problem though, as this is extremely thin (even for a summer beer) and the carbonation is too high. The only thing keeping this from being a terrible investment is that the strawberry flavor tastes natural (unlike in many overly thin fruit beers) and is not excessively sweet. But when looking at this beer overall, and especially when considering that it costs around $10/six pack, it's very disappointing.","DeFaz","Jul 25, 2013"

Nice smell very light but you get a good whiff of strawberry in the nose... at first sip the malt Is all there but literally 1/4 of a second later the strawberry kicks in on the middle of your tongue. It also runs down your throat slightly which is nice. Mouthfeel is about normal... nothing superb. A bit of a bite from the hops but nothing major. Overall a good beer and the best and only strawberry beer I've tried. To me a balance is everything and this beer is not overwhelming on any part.

Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear sunrise brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose is an adept recreation in liquid of a strawberry-flavored Pop-Tart, crust and all. The taste generally brings more of the same, though there's more of that crust flavor and a touch of berry tartness near the finish, which, oddly enough, seems out of place, given the pervasive feeling of sweetness throughout. It also kinda stabs out, an unnatural lightning. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an okay beer at best, but one that just doesn't quite sit all that well with me. Thankfully, the strawberry flavor isn't truly an artificial one, but it's not altogether pleasant, either.","TMoney2591","May 02, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, and refreshing, and the flavors held my attention but I think they would start to wear on me after a while, one seems to be enough for me, I don't think I would want another one in a row, What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and very dessert like. What I liked the least about this beer was the drinkability, lagers are usually pretty drinkable, but this one doesn't keep me coming back for more. I might buy this beer again in the summer if I am in the mood for a light and refreshing fruit beer, but it's not something that I would buy a six pack of, I would recommend this to people who really like strawberry's or somebody who is just getting into craft beer. All in all I didn't mind this beer, it's not for everyone but I think it would make for a nice dessert beer, especially at a bbq in the summertime. This is one of the better beers I have had from this brewery but I'm still not crazy over it or the brewery.This beer was ok but I wouldn't seek it out again.","StoutHunter","Mar 26, 2013"

4.2,21.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Upon first pour, there’s a one finger head that dissipates quickly with little to no lacing. Unlike the raspberry beers I’ve been having lately, there’s no pink or reddish color to it. It’s a slightly cloudy light golden yellow with visible, active, carbonation. On the nose is, you guessed it, strawberries, but also a little bit of wheat. On first sip, I remember how easy it is to put these away on a hot day. I was discussing today how I have a hard time drinking heavy beers in the summer, and it’s because of how easy these types of beers go down in the heat. There’s definite strawberries on the taste, but it’s not overwhelming. The carbonation is pleasant. It’s almost like the “beer taste” stands up to the strawberries. It’s not syrupy or sweet like some fruit beers. It’s what I would call “well balanced.” This is probably one of the most drinkable beers I’ve had.","mgironta","Sep 13, 2012"

3.73,8.1,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours slightly hazy and a light, reddish yellow color with a two-finger length white head. the head recedes slowly, leaving some lacing on the glass. Some bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass, which seems to indicate adequate carbonation. The smell is of pale wheat malt and strawberry. The aroma is fairly mild and clean. The strawberry flavor immediately hits the tongue on the first sip. The wheat malt also comes through, but the strawberry flavor is pretty dominant. The hop flavor is very mild, but some bitterness is present in the back end. This helps lend a little balance. The body is light and there is moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean. The drinkability is very high. When you have one of these, you can understand why this is anticipated as much as it is. It is a solid, refreshing beer that is much better than their perennial fruit beer offering Purple Haze. This is very enjoyable on a warm day or as an after meal drink. It really cleans the palate well. This is one of the better examples of fruit beer I've tried.","acevenom","Apr 29, 2012"

The few bitter beer flavors that come out don't complement the strawberry flavor. I know slamming a strawberry beer for being sweet and fruity is like reviewing an IPA and saying you don't like the bitterness. It's strawberry beer, this is how it's supposed to taste and smell.

Aroma obviously has a fruity presence but its not really artificial or overpowering. If asked to blindly-smell it (if that makes sense) I'm not even sure I'd know the fruit was strawberry. This is an attribute of the flavor, as well. It taste like strawberry, but it doesn't taste like strawberry flavoring. It doesn't taste like a strawberry lollipop or such. A strong wheat presence is also detectable. The mouth and drinkibility are where the beer really shines if you are looking for something sessionable, particularly on a hot day.

Pure strawberry filled nose, no doubt about that, ripe and even laced with powdered sugar, maybe some golden honey as well, can't find much past those strawberries. Light-bodied, here the grain, hops and mild bitters create a semblance of balance, the sour lemon pitches in too. Then it's back to the strawberries, even with less power than in the nose.

It's strawberries from the first sip to the last, so don't expect to anything fancy. The carbonation is spot on for this beer unlike many Abita's. However, it still feels a bit thin.

The smell is all strawberries without the medicinal tint of fake fruits or sweeteners. It actually smells a lot like fresh strawberries followed with a light hops citrus finish on the nose. The taste follows the smell accurately with perhaps slightly more of a subtle hops pine in a light finish. Mouthfeel is light; this one is not at all thick with active carbonation. If it's a bit light on taste and mouthfeel, at least one can tell it's all real; no adjuncts or cereal grains, just real strawberry and, though seemingly in fairly low volume, real hops.","Brenden","Mar 25, 2009"

Real easy drinker, I can almost chug this beer, I mean that totally signifies that it is a poor brew, anything respectable should hold its own and NOT be able to be chugged.

Mouthfeel was very thin and watery, with heavy carbonation levels. The bubbles tingled all over the entire mouth.

Very light on the palate, with a hint of caramel just before the aftertaste. Strawberries come full force in the aftertase. No complexity at all, but very drinkable on a hot day.

This would be even better with a fuller complement of malt to round out the nice strawberry flavor. The lack of complexity leaves the mouthfeel a bit thin.

The flavor carries on the strawberry and cream smell with some very faint herbal hops jumping around in the background. The palate maintatins a slow recession of the strawberry fruit flavors.

3.2,-7.2,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"M&D: It's light bodied with a substantial amount of carbonation (too much, in my opinion) that bitters/mellows out some of the sweeter flavors that need more prominent exposure. The beer has a relatively long finish, yet is somewhat crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel diminishes from the flavor and experience to such an extent that I'm docking the drinkability score.

The taste is stronger than the aroma, however it just tastes like they took a macro lager and put some strawberry flavor in it. I don't know if Abita uses corn in their beers at all, but to me it tastes like corn/grain, sweet malt and some strawberries (good thing I like strawberries). There's a lingering strawberry aftertaste that's more like dried strawberries than fresh ones, which is nice. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit watery with above average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it goes down easy and it's not hard to drink. With all that being said, I wouldn't make it a point to seek this beer out.

Just like I remember as a kid. Not bad in my opinion. Light mouthfeel. Light mouthfeel and good flavor could make this a very drinkable beer, but I dont know of anyone who would have a second in one night. Overall, not a bad fruit flavored beer.

Aroma is real nice, a very pleasant but not overpowering aroma of fresh strawberries. The taste wasn't awe inspiring, but it sure did hit the spot. Basically, I would say that its a very clean, crisp, drinkable beer and the strawberries come through perfectly in the finish. For a fruit beer, this beer isn't fruity, it is very nicely balanced and very refreshing.

All I know is this beer rolls at work when we get it in. We sell it by the case and we sell everything priced by the bottle! People love this beer and I have to agree with them!!","Beerbuddha","Jul 31, 2007"

For the style, this ranks near the top of my list for fruit beers. It's light, easy in the mouth, and has a more subdued flavor than Magic Hat #9, for example. I finished this beer with gratitude to have tried it.","yelterdow","Jul 19, 2007"
3.97,15.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I was very suprised. I really did enjoy this. It was very unique and not overpowering like it could have been. Overall just a really great summer brew. I will definatly purchase again.","mikesgroove","Jul 09, 2007"
3.5,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Aroma of strawberries is evident as soon as you pop the top. Not too much head and it dissipates pretty quickly. Crisp and light with thin mouthfeel. Tastes a bit like strawberry soda. Pretty refreshing and easy to drink, but I prefer Abita Purple Haze for fruit beers.","biggmike","Jun 26, 2007"
3.62,4.9,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,4,"I was pleased with pretty much everything in this beer, except the mouthfeel. It was a bit too thin and wimpy for me. I'd like something a little more ""coating"" and lasting on the tongue. The smell was very nice, something like those little strawberry candies that your granny had in a bowl. The taste was similar, but also creamy, which made it unique. All in all a great beer to enjoy, especially on a hot day.","JISurfer","Jun 19, 2007"
3.29,-4.6,3.5,2,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability -if you're into strawberries, this is as sessionable a fruit beer as you'll find. It has a light body and toned down fruit influence, making easy to enjoy several.","brewdlyhooked13","Jun 17, 2007"
3.57,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Not a bad beer. A refreshing treat for a hot afternoon. (95+ here today). The beer is a very light orange with little head. The strawberries are strong in the smell as well as taste. The beer does not have any strong harsh tastes that detract. Smooth all around. Easy drinking and at less than $7 a sixer I will likely buy a couple more for the hot weather predicted here.","Enola","Jun 12, 2007"
3.47,0.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a very pale yellow color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale malt scent along with a sweet strawberry aroma. The taste is decent also. It has a light malt flavor that is overwhelmed by a sweet strawberry taste. It goes down easy and finishes dry with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied brew with adequate carbaonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's not that complex or even well brewed (cheap strawberry essence), but it hits the spot.","WesWes","Beers"
2.86,-17.1,4,3,2.5,2,3.5,"Unless things change, go with Pete's Strawberry Blonde. It is not as good as last years Strawberry Harvest, but it is way better than this years.","scurvy311","0"

4.32,25.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer is crisp and refreshing, with no bitterness to speak of (which could be good or bad, depending on your tastes). The strawberry flavor is ever-present, but don't assume that it's going to make you forget you're drinking beer. This is a fine fruit beer to try on a hot summer day even if you're not usually a fan of such selections.","Validus","May 23, 2007"
3.08,-10.7,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall, it's a nice strawberry flavor on an average to disappointing beer canvas. It's very pleasant to me as a strawberry lover, but not the best strawberry beer by far.","xav33","May 23, 2007"
4.47,29.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Being a fan of other Abita offerings, I thought I'd give this a shot. I'm glad I did. I find it to be very refreshing. I buy this everytime my local beer store carries it. It certainly isn't for everyone. If you don't like fruit beers, certainly avoid this one, because it is strong on the strawberry flavor. If you fancy fruit beers and would like to try something that would go down so smooth on a warm summer evening, then this is indeed your beer. I currently have some in the fridge, which I can't wait to get home to. I drank it last night and it was wonderful.","bigpatvoodoodad","May 16, 2007"
3.88,12.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a mildly hazed pale brass with many bubbles present, and a frothy white head that holds up well and leaves streaks of lace after each sip. Has a very sweet nose of strawberry and cotton candy with lots of graininess and some odd white wine aromas as well. Flavor is a medley of pale malts, toasted malts, subtle strawberries, cotton candy, and some pleasant supporting grain. Mouthfeel is bubbly, but doesn't stick the tongue too hard. Body is light. This is one refreshing and tasty fruit beer and a great one from Abita.","goochpunch","May 16, 2007"
3.95,14.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3,4,"I really think this might be Abita's best offering and one of the best fruit beers I've ever had. The base style is a great pick for the fruit, and it scores big points with me for not being wheat.","JudgeRoughneck","May 11, 2007"
3.47,0.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a clear yellow with a thick head. The aroma is malty with fruit apparent. The taste is malty and sweet with a healthy strawberry undertone. The mouthfeel is full. This is a surprisingly drinkable beer that I would recommend to those who enjoy fruit flavored brews.","barefootbrewer","May 11, 2007"
3.52,2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Overall, this one's yet another fruit beer that I am surprised that I enjoyed. It would be too sweet to have more than one of in a sitting, but it's refreshing enough that it's worth revisiting for a pint every so often.","SixpointJMH","May 08, 2007"

I probably wouldn't want more than one and surely wouldn't make it a session, but I could see some people being fans of this, especially for a light summer brew, which it's certainly come around for (despite all the current rain we're having in Richmond).","asabreed","Apr 12, 2007"
3.53,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Despite its shortcomings, Strawberry Harvest Lager is an okay little fruit beer... as long as one's expectations aren't sky-high. More bursting berry goodness would probably make it one of Abita's best.","BuckeyeNation","Apr 08, 2007"
3.62,4.9,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Taste is pleasant, with a distinct strawberry note tucked away behind the watery wheat body. Some banana, vanilla, and raspberry as well. Very nicely done, especially when combined with the mouthfeel. It's crisp and light on the tongue, while a great carbonation level gives it a clean finish. Overall, it's fairly tasty, perhaps rivaling Abita's Purple Haze in flavor and drinkability.","wagenvolks","Mar 24, 2007"
2.52,-27,2,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Shared with a friend (thanks, Tyler) at RFD Washington. This is a bit hazy, and relatively flat.

Smells fruity, champagne like, but not much else noted. Creamy with a definate strawberry flavor but not much else. Kind of like a lite beer with strawbery added. Nice neutral mouthfeel and huge drinkability. Not a bad tasting beer, a touch more malt and hops would be nice though.","sabrills70","May 30, 2006"
3.79,9.9,3.5,4.5,3,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a descent white head that retains ok. The aroma is where this beer realy stands out, with freshly picked strawberries jumping out of the glass, as well as a sugary sweetness, some biscuit, slight floral hops and fruity esters. The flavor has some slightly artificial strawberry notes, along with some table sugar sweetness, biscuit, vanilla, and some slight herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light and crisp and drinkability is near perfect. A good session brew, not too complicated or radical in its flavors.","silver0rlead","May 20, 2006"

4.35,26.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle. Pours a solid straw color with a finger of head comprised of big bubbles. This falls fairly fast to a film over top. Clarity is very good, and carbonation is not really active in the glass. Nose is definately all about the fresh strawberry. Its sweet strawberry, but not fake, with a light creamy aspect to it. I think it smells nice. Flavor is not as dominated with the strawberry. The lager base comes through as what I would call a pilsner without the hopping, but is very clean and unobtrusive. This fades into a slightly sweet and very fruity strawberry. I was not expecting to enjoy this one, but I'd rather be suprised this direction than the other. I think the strawberry and the mildly grainey, almost a touch of chalkyness of the base beer compliment each other very well and accentuate the fruit character without it being overbearing. Abita has my attention on this one. Mouthfeel is moderate with a lively moderate carbonation. I think the carbonation level is ideal for the brew. Its not too little, but its not anything that is providing a bite that would interfere with the flavor. Drinkability is great. This one just works for me. Flavors are well balanced and proportioned just right. Excellent.","kmpitz2","0"

3.47,0.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sampled at the Abita Brewpub as part of their select series. Color is light golden with little head. The aroma is of strawberries, fairly fresh smelling, with just a hint of lager aroma. Taste is quite similar to Pete's Wicked Strawberry Blond, just fresher tasting. This is basically a lighter american lager with strawberry flavoring. This is an easy beer to get down, but almost everything else available at the Abita Brewpub is more interesting.","Gagnonsux","0"
