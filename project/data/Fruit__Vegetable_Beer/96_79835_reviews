"05/22/13  At Rattle N Hum, NYC. On tap. Very refreshing. The hint of berry is a nice touch. Light bodied wheat with a balanced flavor. We could become good friends. I might track it down in bottles to see if it holds it's smoothness."

"Elder Betty is my favorite fruit beer I've ever had. It's  not like other fruit beers, where you think you're just drinking cider; there's enough of an aftertaste that reminds you that it's beer to know it isn't cider, and it's not overpowering with one fruit. I love it."

"I actually like this more than I probably should, it goes down wicked easy and is very thirst quenching, probably better for a hot summer day where I could pound a couple of these like nothing."
"Overall: Not a bad summer beer. It is pretty sweet. I would have it again."

"Notes: Nice berry flavor that isn't artificial tasting. Not that is like some sours with tons of fruit flavor but it does the trick. Good balance with tartness. I kept being reminded of blueberry lemon muffins or a berry pie of some kind, but not in a ""this is really sweet way."" Good summer beer but not great."
""
"The Crack! showed that even Magic Hat is not holding back when it comes to brimful CANs. Knowing now why many of them do it, I am curious as to why they all do not fill their CANs this way. I got in an inverted Glug and then sat back to watch as the pseudo-cascade took place. The three fingers of dense, rocky, yellowish-white head was like meringue atop a pie! I kid you not, that was some of the thickest, densest head that I have enCANtered in a long time. It took forever to settle, also. Color was a cloudy (not hazy, sorry) Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, "

"Pours yellow Orange not much head. Smells of Berries and Lemon. Only a Little lacing. Not much exciting about this beer it is refreshing but does not go enough on any point. I was very disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Ok brew. Glad I tried it."
"Although they're certainly not the first to do so, you've got to give Magic Hat at least a little bit of credit for originality in producing ""Elder Betty", an elderberry weiss. The berry flavor comes through quite clearly, and adds an interesting secondary flavor that comes out in the lingering finish. The base beer is well-made, although basic, but that's clearly so as not to interfere with the berry flavor; and along those lines the bitterness is kept in check, and there are no hop flavors to speak of. It's interesting and refreshing, although I'm not sure you'd really want to have two of these in a row."

"Pours a light shade of amber. Very mild foam. This beer is well carbonated and bubbles like a champagne. I don't typically like fruit beers and didn't think I would like this one because Elder Berry is usually too tart for me. It was the perfect amount of tartness to make this beer taste like an ale with a cider-like touch to it. I would definitely enjoy a session with a six pack of this sometime, preferably on the beach."

"o: A refreshing summer brew with just enough subtle dark berry flavor while still letting you know it's beer."
""

""
""
"At first when I smelt this beer I thought I was going to enjoy it. I liked the blueberry smell it gave off personally, but with every sip the taste kind of went south. This is more of a summer outdoor beer (beach, picnic,etc...). Not the worst thing I have"

"Bought a 6 pack and poured into a pint glass. Hazy golden color with barely a 1 finger head. Smell was definitely fruity, I'm guessing of elder berries. Taste was crisp and fruity, but not sweet or syrupy. Very refreshing with a nice mouthfeel and pleasant aftertaste. Definitely a refreshing summer brew. I will definitely try this a few more times this summer."

"Picked up a mixed six from Magic Hat, had not actually had any of their beers but had not heard good things. Pretty good looking beer, reasonably hazy , decent head that grabbed the glass. Not much to the nose but a decent taste. No idea what an elderberry even is but decent tasting beer. Nothing great but a good beer that is worth enjoying."

"Elder Betty brewed by Magic Hat Brewing Company. This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a small white head. Going to say this brew is unfiltered. Elder Betty has an ABV of 5.5%. The smell is rich with spices and some grains and fruit. The taste is great smooth and rich with spices and berries. Elder Betty goes down smooth with no bad aftertaste. There is nothing bad to say about this brew. This brew starts off smooth with a clean finish. I like how this brew has more flavor than most brews on the market. This brew was more than what I was expecting. I would buy this Elder Betty again I'm giving this brew a 4.50 out of 5."
""
""
""
" Overall a nicely earned 3.5 for Elder Betty, quite a fitting selection for this brewer's summer sampler pack. This is probably the most crisp wheat style of beer, be it hefewiezen, witbier, or what have you, that I've ever consumed in recent memory! I highly recommend this for a thirst quencher for the dog days of summer. Especially here in humid-ass Ohio hahaha. I shall CERTAINLY acquire this brew again from my local craft retailer!!"
""
"IT's a gold beer, a little hazy, with a very small head. The nose... well, it's kinda nice... tart, rather than merely sweet, like I expect in a typical gimmick beer like this Unfortunately, the flavor is in the ugh-range, way too sweet, syrupy, and unpleasant. Actually, I can't finish this. Bleagh."
""
""
""
"Pretty good overall. I enjoyed the taste and the overall characteristics of this brew. I liked the elder berry taste and other hints of berries. I was also picking up a hint of banana. I wish it was more bread tasting. Overall it was decent beer. I'd say it's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall an okay, ordinary beer, that pretty much sums up most of magic hats offerings. Beyond that not much else to say, a don't bother, mundane, unexciting tick of a beer."
""
""
"Disgusting taste - I think this beer would be acceptable if the price could be lowered by a couple of dollars. However, contextualizing this beer with others in the price range, this is the usual low quality product from magic hat. I expect this to not even be the best beer at your local gas station."
""
""

"o: this could be a regular summer drink for me. Not bad at all."

"Magic Hat is becoming my favorite brewery!!! It's different, nothing else like it. You can definitely taste the elderberry, and it works. Took me a while to find this, but actually found it at a Kroger and Only one particular Kroger here In Indianapolis. And that was after I checked about 15 places. We'll worth finding it!!"

"Fruity and flavorful as is to be expected by MagicHat. The scent and the flavor are nearly the same, reminiscent of blackberries but not in the way you would think of them traditionally. They combine a flavor and an aroma into a bottle that is subtly sweet, and delicately smooth enough to be a classy fruit beer, at the same time staying true to ithe maker."

"This beer grew on me as it warmed up but I like fruit beer more than the average person I think. I like this one from Magic Hat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty reddish golden yellow in color. Not much of a head is seen and some very little spotty lacing when sipped. The aroma is of a berry mix with some grain. Very nice. The taste was about the same with some wheat after taste. Very nice despite the above average carbonation and not too sweet as you might think. No bitter after taste. A good different type of brew."

"I like this better than the #9 that was in the box, but we will see about the rest. Not bad for a hot summer day."
"Overall I really like this beer. The only down side is it is extremely drinkable and I find that my glass empty’s way to fast."
""
"Overall: Has a lot of commercial appeal, with plenty of flavor, but not too much ""beery beer"" taste. I would NOT classify this ad a hefeweizen, but rather a specialty ale. Nothing about this beer says ""hefeweizen"" to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - it's not a very complex beer but I did enjoy it and could see knocking a few back by the pool."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aside from the sexy looks, this beer was a rather uninspiring hefeweizsen. Part of the reason I wasn't particularly amused is that I'm not a big fan of banana-berry anything, which is precisely what you get when you mix the banana phenols from hefeweizen yeast with elderberries. Besides that, everything else pretty much seemed like a middle-of-the-road hefeweizen. Another mediocre beer from magic hat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - OK but not a beer I would seek out"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some slightly sour berry aromas. Taste is much the same with bread and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of mineral-like bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but nothing I would go after again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for the price, not bad at all, a decent find."
""
""
""
""
""
"This ""hefeweizen"" (it doesn't taste too much like a hefeweizen to me, but what do I know) tries so hard to be unique, but it just doesn't articulate anything to me and ends up smelling and tasting like a smattering of flavors, like someone threw random ingredients into a bottle and crossed his fingers. It actually tastes somewhat bland despite this. I was expecting a fruit beer with a dominant flavor of elderberry. Rather than the focus being on the fruit, there's an odd dry herbal and floral flavor and a flavor of nuts and bread. It's earthy. The mouthfeel is thin, crisp, and dry. It's refreshing. I appreciate the effort to be unique, and it's not bad by any means, but the ""magic"" just leaves me confused and underwhelmed at the same time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this as a hefe/sahti mix with a bit of fruit. As beer overall, I think it is creative and would have a couple on a hot night. I think there are way better hefes that are truer to style however."
""
"A nice beer for the summer. Beer Advocate has it as a Hefeweizen and Rate Beer has it as a wheat ale. I think it is somewhere in between. Definitely a summer beer. I’d have it again though."

"The label of the bottle enticed me as I was casually strolling through the supermarket with my love. I was asking what beer to get when suddenly a bright flash of bold contrasting colors attracts the peripheral vision of my spectrum. Alas, I turn my body to see the majestic elder betty staring at me with her magic eyes, drawing me in. Suddenly I find my arm moving itself without even a thought. Elder Betty knows what she wants. She wants my mouth on her, sucking down her juices. Elder Betty knows whats best! The ale is smooth and calms my inner soul. I pour it on my girlfriend's neck and lick it off. Well done Elder Betty, well done."

"They should change this back to a pale wheat. It would score a little higher."
""
""
"I usually don't care for fruit beers, or Magic Hat for that matter, but I totally thought that this was pretty good stuff. I would most certainly drink this again but I doubt that I would ever want a whole case of it. My brother bought this mix pack and left it at my house, so I will certainly drink it for free."
""
""
""
"This is an interesting beer with a very tasty summery flavor that you could drink in the hot sun for hours. Has a berry, wheat, light taste and mouthfeel that is refreshing. Don't let the rating deceive you, if you are looking for a good summer beer to drink all day you won't be disappointed."

"Like Magic Hat's number nine, it has a unique taste and is light, but kind of lacks a punch I like in beers. It feels light. It's summer, and I wasn't looking for something really heavy, so perhaps it's more me not knowing what I want."
""
""
""
""

""
""

"MF - Light bodied with a med-high carbonation."

"O: Very nice summer brew; ballparks across America need to be serving this. Enjoyed very much."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruit beers are not usually my style, but I do like them when they have real beer character and this fruit beer certainly passes on these and other counts. The fruit character is undeniable, but so is the wheat and bread character in the background, making the beer seem like a fruity dessert or piece of fruit pie. I like it better than many other fruity brews and I find it has enough good qualities to earn a recommendation."

"Overall: A reasonably well-made wheat beer. Lack of berry color indicates beer had flavor added, as opposed to being brewed with elderberries, and the berry flavor suffered as a result."
"O - A decent hefeweizen. This isn't my favorite type of beer, but I feel this is a decent representation of the style. Disappointed though, in the fact that there was no discernable elder berry taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall kind of a disappointment. If I had to relate this to anything, it might be a brioche without the usual sweetness. Might use it for cooking, but probably not much else."
""
""
""
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a golden orange hazy color, producdd a small white head, below average retention and it little lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain, nuts and berries. Light in body, smooth mouthfeel, there was a base of cereal grain, hits of berries and a slight bit of tartness."
"Pours a hazy golden color, white head with some good staying power. The aroma opens up quite fruity and yeasty, you could say very berry. Tastes of light wild berry flavor, biscuity malt, wheat, clove and a light acidic bitterness. Tart due to the residual acids from the elderberry. In 86 degree heat this tastes pretty good. In a pinch I'd have this again."
""
""
" overall not poor but a bit unnerving... I frequently like fruit/floral beers. had a smuttynose with chamomile earlier this afternoon that was great and grew up on abita purple haze. but I probably won't go for this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you've always wished Schwepps Dry Grape came in beer version, this is your moment."
""
""
""
"O - Easy drinking and refreshing. I like that the berry flavor is somewhat subtle and doesn't bash you over the head."
""
""
""
""
"And so on, and so on..."
""
""
""
"O - I'd recommend this to anyone looking to drink a portable festival ready/beach beer. It's a little on the pricey side for what it's worth, but it's a cheap beer for classy brew drinkers. (3.25/5)"
""
""
""
"A very drinkable and refreshing late spring or summer beer -- it reminds me quite a lot of Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier, just with a different look and slightly different mouth feel. Pretty average ... not awful."
""
""
""
"A pretty enjoyable lighter beer, pairs okay with food and quenches thirst. There is no detectable wheat though, so it's strange that it is a hefe. Tastes nothing like that."

"The beer is yellow and mostly clear with a small white head. The aroma is a bit sweet, fruity esters. Smells OK. The flavor is a bit of a let down. A bit too sweet, and lacking those distinguishable attributes we associate with hefeweizens. I can't single out or detect any elderberry presence. While drinkable, this is pretty boring. I won't buy this again."
"Beer is medium to light in body, nothing about this beer is elderberry, it has this mild sweetness, mild fruitiness, I wouldn't have guessed this was a hefeweizen. Not a repeat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is not a bad beer and was actually much better than I was expecting. It’s actually a pretty tasty and drinkable beer, but because there are so many good hefeweizens out there, it’s tough to rate this one much higher than average. It just doesn’t have the complexity and body that good beers of this style possess. Still, this is a decent beer and maybe one of our favorites from Magic Hat – although that may not be saying much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite Magic Hat seasonal beers. Golden, mostly clear appearance with not much of a head. Smooth, crisp, with pleasant after taste. Not too fruity, but definitely a beer you can enjoy with your girlfriend. Great on a hot summer day under a nice shady tree. Enjoy!"

"Nice take on an American wheat beer. Elderberries added a nice fruity depth, would be nice to see that playing off some more adventurous yeast character."
""
"As a light and refreshing beer, I can't be too upset with it. I'd have it again, but I wouldn't be excited to ."
""
"3.25/5.00"
""
""

""
""

"Mouthfeel is light and on the crisp side, with mild carbonation, a medium grainy body and a semi-dry and slightly funky aftertaste. Overall it was decent and I’d have it again. Middle of the road beer."

"Light and crisp. Lots of carbonation, light body, refreshing on a hot day."

"This is pretty much your typical American fruit wheat beer (perhaps a little less fruity and less sweet). A rather bland brew."
"Overall: I was definately interested in trying an elderberry hefe. Not the best fruit hefewiezen ive ever had. I suggest trying it, but not buying it."
""
"If my mother smelled like elder berries (requisite Monty Python reference), then I wouldn't really complain. I like the berry presence in this beer."
""
"Overall - I don't dislike this, but I can't see going to it again. And I didn't get much elderberry. Maybe that's the fault of the fruit, but then why make a beer featuring it?"
"Elder Betty is fruit beer au naturel, baby. As such it fails to arouse the same way that intensely or artificially sweetened fruit beers do. By the same token, however, it is a beer for which I have more respect. There's no makeup or push-up bras or airbrushing here, just a simple, humble, affable fruit beer made by a serviceable brewery."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a hazy straw with a nice fluffy white head that dissipates fairly quickly but leaves some lacing on the glass. Smells of berries and sweet grain, very balanced. Tastes of barley and blueberry, very pleasant. Beer is balanced for its light body, with great carbonation and nice finish. Overall, a pretty good beer."
""
""
"Ill keep buying it."
""

""
""
""
""

"I am not impressed with this beer. I expected a lot more from this. Disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"*After a couple ElderBetty it tends to coat your palete with an undesirable sweetness.*"
"O - It is a fruity wheat beer. It is good if that is what you like."
""
""
"Cheers."
""
""
"It's not terrific but it's not bad either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Well, it's better than I was expecting. The fruit flavour isn't cloying and the beer is fairly drinkable.. even for someone who isn't a fan of fruit beers like me."
""
""
"D: Overall a great mix of feel and flavors, very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Disappointing, more like a wine cooler than a beer."
""
"Not bad, not great. As good as most of the other wheat fruit combos out there."
""
""
"This is a rather disappointing beer. It comes across like fruit juice rather than a fruity hefeweizen. It's tart and sweet and has no elements of a traditional hefeweizen. I'll pass next time."
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer by any stretch. It's got a nice elderberry flavor, it's light and refreshing, goes down well. It's just...there isn't much else there. The malt base is quite weak, and the flavor is not very complex. The fizzy carbonation is not helping matters much. Don't get me wrong, on a hot summer's day this would be a refreshing treat, and I like it a great deal better than other Magic Hat brews, but it could have been so much more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M&D - not impressed, a bit fizzy, and the fruit isn't blended as well as some other fruit beers. A decent beer that I might try on tap."
""
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a white head. The aroma has a nice blueberry and elderberry character, as well as some wheat. The beer smells fairly juicy overall. The flavor has some tart berry notes, as well as some wheat. The fruit seems a bit artificial and is very sweet. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Better than I expected, but nothing to seek out."
"O-The tartness is nice however the elderberry/grape notes overpower everything else and make this beer way to fruity. Possibly it can be used as a soft intro to sours for some people? Also the beer does not warm well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: All in all a very good beer for a nice breezy, summer day. Very drinkable with a lot of earthy flavor. One of Magic Hats better brews and if you love Saisons, you'll enjoy this beer!"
""
""
""
"O- I would want a lot of these but it was a nice diversion on a hot day. No real character of a hefeweizen in this but it was still a pleasant beer to drink. The 5.5% ABV is low enough to make it a session beer but it is a little sweet for me to want do so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The medicinal flavor is not nearly as annoying as the aroma lead me to believe. That being said, it is still a very average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To be clear, I enjoy this beer strictly for the taste of the elderberries. It is well-balanced, but seriously lacking in the hops and malt departments."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice straw gold color body with a small fizzy white head that doesn't hang around for long. The smell is kinda fruity with some wheat notes lingerling around. The taste defently has a nice wheat/malt and fruit flavor balanced out real nice. The berry flavor is nice on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is really nice and overall a nice and different take on a hefeweizn."
""
"B"
""
""
"Taste is not half bad. The added fruit flavors throw a nice little curveball in there and kind of cover for the lackluster hefe background. Id say this is more of a fruit beer than a Hefeweizen, and more of an American Wheat for a background at that. It keeps the hops at a minimum to avoid any clashing with the fruitiness. I wont be rushing out to the store to buy more, but actually makes for a good summertime quencher and should be liked by fans of fruity wheat beers."
""
""
"I wss really excited about this one. An elderberry beer. Great idea. Also, great packaging. Poured a pretty non-descript color. Not too interesting in the aroma. The elderberry shows up in the taste, but not too interesting. Light and refreshing, but nothing too complex here."
""
"It's easy to drink, but lacks panache. There's nothing offensive and the alcohol is moderate at best so you can pound them if you want. I prefer to sip and overall, this is a bit weak all-round."
"O- I can see the intent with this one, but the berry taste came across artificial to me. Wouldn't be bad on a hot summer day but I can think of better options."
""
""
"This is a fantastic weissbier that all fans of the style should try. The use of elderberries is not overdone at all. Rather, there is just enough to complement the traditional flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad. A great spring/summer brew. Good wheat taste and decent fruit presence."
"Easy to drink, makes me feel happy, and refreshed on a long, working, Summers' day."

"O: If only MH would switch up their yeast, I think they would get much more praise. It either dominates or makes a presence in ALL of their beers and changes some of their could-be greats into mediocre beers... sigh"

"There is no doubt that this beer is drinkable and I can make it work, but it certainly leaves me wanting more. When my friend was visiting a couple of weeks ago, we decided to try this seasonal and it left us wanting more."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on June 21, 2012 when it was 97 degrees outside. It pours a murky looking pale yellow with loads of carbonation leading up to a huge, long lasting head. The aroma is of pale malts, wheat, and berries. The body is light to medium which is just what you want for a day like today. The taste has some wheat and berries with a low bitterness and clean, crisp ending. I am a bit biased as my late mother's name was Betty and the only craft beer she liked was Magic Hat. But regardless of that, this was ideal for the first full day of summer."

"Pours a cloudy, maize/copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus (elderberry?), wheat, sweet malt, hint of yeast, and clove. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of elderberry, sweet malt, clove, and a hint of wheat. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and mouth feel. The body is a little lacking, though."
""
"O: Well, alright. I give Magic Hat props for trying new things, but despite a nice bouquet there's nothing much special going on here."
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, seems very much like any other berry wheat beer out there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall again tastes like Magic Hat went from craft beer to artificial gimmicky beer. The beers all taste forced, extract and artificial, bland, and just like they're not cared for as much as they used to. Even the words of wisdom from the cap seems to have faded as this one was fairly lame. [sigh] Magic Hat was my gateway beer, and I even had a keg of Fat Angel at my wedding, but they really just die more and more every time I try them."
""
""
""
"Overall, more subtle fruitiness than I expected in the flavor. Lacks the banana and clove esters of a typical weiss beer, but the elderberry adds enough character to keep things interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My overall impression is that this is unexciting, not all that appetizing, and I’d rather have something else after a hard afternoon of yard work. Thoroughly mediocre like much of what Magic Hat does, in my book."
""
""
""
"i like when magic hat does something new. this is a nice summer wheat beer with lots of subtle flavors going on. elderberry is a vermont staple in the permaculture age, and its inclusion in this otherwise average wheat beer is a nice treat. pours cloudy yellow with a faint pinkish glow and a 2 inch white foam head. smells pretty standard, a little fruity but at this point it could just as easily be the yeast. flavors are tart fruit at first, sweeter fruits in the middle, and a very crisp wheat malt finish. i bet this would be killer as a big ipa, but i like it well enough in its current form. mouthfeel is fine, medium carbonation and a pretty light body for an unfiltered beer. overall very drinkable and im sure ill have a fair few this summer."
""
"O: I was pleasantly surprised with this beer as it's fruitiness is sweet but not too sweet and has a lingering taste I really like. This beer gets poor reviews and I can understand if it's b/c the yeast doesn't show up as it's strange to drink a hefe and not taste the yeast but otherwise I really like this beer and think it's a good one to drink now and again. I don't want more than 1 per sitting but it's a great change of pace. Drops just below 4.0 due to the ""wouldn't want to drink more than 1."""
""
"O- an easy drinker . Sessionable but just a boring beer."
"This isnt something id run out to buy again, but at 5.5% it hits hard for the style. Overall, worth a try but dont seek out."
""
"Overall: If you like sweet fruity beer then this may be one you want to try. I don’t see myself running out to buy a 6-pack though since it’s too fruity-sweet for my liking. One or two from a sampler pack is plenty. At 5.5% ABV, it’s probably not the summer session beer one is looking for. Their #9 and Circus Boy are much better in my opinion."
"Another interesting MH brew. Not earth shattering, but a good enough summer wheat beer."
""
"The aroma is malty and somewhat yeasty with a fruity like essence but hardly any. The hops are herbal in nature. The appearance is deep cloudy gold with a foamy head. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall a nice beer but does not have much of a elderberry taste or smell."
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a fairly average fruit beer, probably my least favorite in the 12-pack. The taste/smell were a little bit too artificial and soda-like, which I didn't really care for. It's why I dislike most fruit beers. There are definitely better fruit beers out there and there are definitely some worse ones."
"From the 12 oz bottle in the 12-pack sampler from Trader Joe's."
"Overall – This was a rather interesting beer. A little different, but good none the less."
"Overall: Well, it's better than Wacko. Elder Betty follows the tired, old fruit beer pattern -- bland to modest base beer (be it a blonde ale or something wheat-based) with a splash of flavoring."
""
""
"Poured a 2"" white head disappearing at an average pace. Slightly hazed body is a cross between straw and gold. It smells like it will be tart, and you can smell a little malt. Taste is only slightly berry, not tart at all, yet somehow the fruit aspect still overwhelms all the beer aspects. Mild malt comes through in the aftertaste. Drinkable, non-offensive, but more of a beer for those who don't really like beer."
"This beer has berries but it lacks balls. Seriously. The smell and taste are good, but they are excessively mild. This would be a good beer to give to someone that doesn't really like beer. I personally believe that Magic Hat can make a better wheat beer."
""
""
"The feel of this beer is light a pretty drinkable. A good summer beer it has some all the hallmarks of something that is light enough to have on a hot day and is full of some nice flavor."

""

""
""
"Decent wheat ale. Not overly fruity."
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a hazy golden orange color. The head is white with a decent retention. The smell of the beer was sweet, slightly fruity. The taste of the beer has an artificial fruity flavor up front, it's sweet and moderately refreshing. The mouthfeel of the beer is light and well carbonated. Overall the beer is ok, it's another pretty standard fruit beer from Magic Hat."
""
""
""
""
"O- Not as bad as expected. Magic Hat is just one of those breweries who can't be taken seriously anymore."
""
""
""
""
"The pours a murky copper color with a fluffy off white head. The smell is mostly berries with some wheat and a little bit of tang. It tastes slightly tangy with berry flavor that's kind of medicine like, wheat bread in the aftertaste. The beer is really light with loads of soft carbonation. Wouldn't really want to drink this again."
"O: Underwhelming. I haven't bought a Magic Hat mixed 12 in a long while and I probably will not be buying whatever 12 this came in either. Still a middle of the road weiss, thanks to my neighbor for putting in my hand."
"Think artificial berry Sweettart flavor. It's actually appealing to me. Too sweet for it fit into soured lambic category. Too little wheat for a truly fruit flavored wheat beer. Richer than some wheats. Overall, an innocuous hybrid."
""
""
""
"Magic Hat Elder Betty is a hazy golden ale with a thin white head that quickly turns into a thin splotch. It has a faint aroma of malt extract. It's a little fruity. In the mouth, it's medium-light bodied and smooth with a pretty clean finish. It's lightly flavored with some wheat, sweet malt and elderberries. There's a very slight bitterness that seems leafy. It's very light all around-- a little sweet and quite feminine."

"Murky, cloudy, dark-golden in color...small head, with a ring of lace. The smell is a nice mix of soft, twangy wheat, a little yeast, some banana and grass, and, finally, a generous fresh-berry scent. The taste has a bit of wheat, a tart dryness, and enough hops for balance. The body is sooth and creamy. It's a decent beer, but it didn't grab me."
"O - This is an okay fruit/wheat beer. Not overdone or overly sweet. Nice summer ale."
""
""
""
"I'm typically not impressed with much that MH has to offer, and this was really no exception. Poured a hazy orange-yellow with a small white head that receded to a wispy layer of bubbles. Aroma of grains and sweet berries, sugary malts, sweet candy. More of the same in the taste, elderberries (there's a Monty Python joke in there somewhere), sweet bready malts, grains, mildly wheaty and acidic. Definitely more sweet than tart as far as any fruitiness goes. On the lighter end of medium-bodied and a bit stale in the aftertaste. Not too bad overall, but just not my thing."
"O- Not the most out there with flavor beer, but a nice refreashing summer beer after you have been working outside all day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very fruity Wheat Ale, refreshing and tasty but nothing overly special..."
"Overall a pretty good brew. Think of it as a fruit beer rather than a wheat ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Light and easy enough to drink though the slightly artificial berry flavor is a mild turn off. Nothing special about this beer and I'm not sure that I would get this one again."
"Overall this beer just doesn't do it for me. The fruit flavor is too artificial and really everything else is just average."
"O: Overall, pretty tasty, this is going to make an excellent summer beer, I'll have to remember to pick up a case or two while they are still available."
"O: This beer isn’t that difficult to drink but lacks any refreshing or thirst-quenching qualities."
""
""
""
""
"Some astringency and a creamy wheat taste, overlaid with an odd 'purple drank' impression of artificial grape flavoring. Wet cardboard also comes to mind. Body is mellow and creamy, standard APWA/weisse feel, though the astringency throws it out of whack. Overall this is weak. Starting to question my ""try any beer once"" tendencies... this is without question a sub-par beverage."
""

""
""
"O: well, I'm glad I only got a single of this just to try and I don't think I'll get this again."
""
"O. The sweetness is a bit too much. This seems like a beer that could do with being aged a bit."
"O: This is a simple, straight-forward beer that (thankfully) does not succumb to Magic Hat's tendency toward sweetness. It may be nothing all that new or innovative, but it is an effective thirst quencher nonetheless. Should be worth seeking out for fans of fruit beers."
"Aroma of slightly sour fruits. Pours a hazy light orange colour with a nice but very short lasting head. I'm partial to fruit beers, and this one hits all the points. The berry is not overpowering, just the right tart tangyness. It has the nice breadyness I expect from a Weiss as well. Overall, it's a good drinking beer."
"Overall I like all of the berry this beer brings to the table. Will admit its not ""true to the style"" but is enjoyable none the less."
"Another dud from this brewer. Middle of the road, no thing to make you want to recommend or try again. Not hateful, just not worth chasing."
""
"Pours a cloudy golden color, nice fruity smell to it. Light to medium bodied, some dryness, decent finish. Not sure what an 'elderberry' is supposed to taste like to be honest, but this tastes like a typical slightly tart and fruity wheat beer. Nothing too extraordinary here... probably good on a hot day, but nothing work seeking out... above average though and drinkable for sure."
""
"O: Wiess with elderberry? Yes. Result? Eh. Seems sweet at first, but there is some bitterness to balance at the end. The elderberry is noticeable (perhaps too much). The finish is not very clean. I could see this being refreshing in hot weather, which is the point. I do think the finish needs to be a little less cloying."
"O-probably would have helped if I had ever eaten an actual elderberry. Regardless, the beer is well balanced and very drinkable. Best Magic Hat beer I've had in awhile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer with decent flavorings and a nice wheat body."
"Hazy golden in body with white head that stays around for a while. Smells of berries, slight vanilla, some yeast. Reminiscent of elephant peanut candies. Berry flavor up front with wheat yeast, vanilla esters that hang on the tongue. Medium carbonation and light bodied. Easy drinking beer with some good flavors. Not great but allright."
""
"O/D-Not bad. Too soft and it got old. Wish I didn't buy a whole six-pack. Worth a try though. I would compare it to a poor man's Blackbeary Wheat by Longtrail, but much less awesome."
""
""
""
"Overall: I’m a little biased against this beer because it replaced the Wacko, which is a beer I love, but I’ll be fair and say it is not a terrible beer. It’s a little fruity with its yeast, which is expected for the style. It’s a mediocre summer ale."
""
"It won't win any awards or wow any beer critics but it's good if you want something inoffensive for a balmy day."
"Overall: A nice summer beer. One of the more flavorful of their usually highly drinkable beers."
""
"O: For a mere non-scarce seasonal, this is definitely one to try, great fruit flavors and aromas, nice look"
""
"Even though Wacko was my intro to craft beer, even I could tell that it needed to be retired. Enter Elder Betty, a wheat ale brewed with Elderberries. And it's good! Far better than Wacko, at the very least. It pours a hazy golden color with a small head. The aroma is very strong on the fruit, with a touch of wheat perceivable. The taste offers a nice, refreshing, slightly tart kick of berries with just the smallest amount of wheat in the back. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for an easy-drinking summer brew. A great summer thirst quencher that blows Wacko out of the park, even with my soft spot for it."
""
"For a beer geek like myself that doesn't need a palette destroying hop beer, this one is fantastic."
"Appearance is gold in color. Slight, very slight berry aroma with a nice blend of hops. Taste is very much a wheat ale with a nice hit of berry. Mouthfeel is very nice, dry on the tongue. As it leaves the mouth it leaves a slight berry after taste, nice. Overall this is a good wheat beer that has been infused with the right amount of elder berry flavor. Nicely done. Bring on the summer heat, this beer will sit well on the deck with some fruit salad."
"I just had a world class German hefeweizen, why on earth am I drinking this now? Pours nicely into the same weissbier glass, glowing hazed golden orange hue with a bright white head, much less texture going on than the German counterpart. Fine even lacing formed looks nice, into the aroma: Tart berries, they say elderberry, I wouldn't know that one in particular but some fruity tartness that resembles berries. Think head to head competition with Leinenkugel's ""fruity pebbles"" beer. A bit cloying in my first sip a strong sense of berry extract comes down the palate, with some lifeless watery notes and hints of grassy/grains colliding with elderberry extract. I will let my wife finish off the rest of these, she enjoyed one straight from the bottle last night. In all of the years in trying Magic Hat beers, I've never seen marketing this bad, the weird looking Elder Betty on the tree doesn't make me want go see jambands perform. ""Golden Haze for Summer's Daze"" ha-ha-ha (smoker's cough following). Outside of marketing the American yeast used in the beer makes the wheat component pretty lifeless and one dimensional, the yeast is chalky/doughy no spice no esters just effin boring. Mouthfeel I will repeat finishes cloying like I neither need to eat something or brush my teeth to get these flavors off my palate. Carbonation no complaints really, just a huge blunder of a summer beer release. Give me a good German Helles any day, that's not normal anymore in the craft brewing trends. Overall if you have to try do so within the confines of a 12 pack summer sampler when they're released."
""
""
"Not much to this brew at all. It is a wheat beer with a smattering amount of berry character. Not crisp and perhaps too much body for a ""summer beer", either way it lands pretty lackluster on my palate."
