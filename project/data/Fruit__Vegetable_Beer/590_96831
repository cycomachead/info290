Doesnt smell artificial in any way, just packed with freshh berry.  Taste pretty much follows thebnose here.  Again hust bursting with strawberry preserves, although I wish it had slightly more tartness from the rhubarb, it is incredibly well balanced.  Moderate carbonation, light body, and creamy.  Nrw glarus just nails fruit beers and this is no exception.","adapt313","Mar 13, 2015"

Tastes of sweet strawberries, tart fruit comes through at the back of the palate and it balances out the sweetness well. Pretty rich and full bodied for such a low alcohol brew, but it works well. Just a damn good beer overall. Sweetness is matched by the tartness of the rhubarb and the light alcohol is matched by a full, creamy body with a crisp finish. Probably my favorite beer.","Jacurdy60","Feb 15, 2015"

But the combination is stellar. Smooth, refreshing mouthfeel leads to great drinkability. Great balance of tart and sweet only makes it drink even better. Top, top, TOP tier fruit beer. The only competition I've ever had is other NG fruit beers (big surprise, I'm sure). Obviously I can't give it top marks for complexity or something like that but it is a perfect example of the style.","Dope","Jan 15, 2015"

Go to the store, pick up a jar of Smuckers Strawberry preserves, open and inhale and that's what this beer smells like. Taste perfectly mirrors the smell. Not getting much of the rhubarb, but I really don't care. The only complaint I guess is that the sweetness starts to naw at you after about 4 ounces. It's like getting too much of a good thing.

When it comes down to the brass tacks though, Strawberry Rhubarb, as fantastic as it is, still doesn't measure up to New Glarus' other award-winning fruit beers.

Aroma of tart rhubarb notes with some lightly sweet raspberry notes. Taste is a lot more tart than I had expected with rhubarb notes being more dominant than the strawberry notes. Taste is more tart than the sweeter side associated with some of the New Glarus beers. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. I enjoyed this beer quite lot but this is definitely more complex and bit less drinkable than I was expecting.","Phyl21ca","Apr 28, 2014"

The flavor is rich and sweet with lots of sugary sweet strawberries with just a hint of earthy tartness to not make it cloying. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet just short of syrupy mouthfeel. Another great fruit beer from New Glarus. Cast from the same mold as the other beers with a different fruit and the same wonderful results.","johnnnniee","Jan 25, 2014"

Wafts of strawberry from the glass before I even held it to my nose. Unlike other NG fruit beers I've had, this one came off really strong and really artificial, like those little strawberry hard candies. The taste was similar, very sweet, loads of strawberry, with any rhubarb tartness being incidental and/or overwhelmed by the candy sweetness of the strawberry. Artificial and nearly medicinal, yet still strangely alluring. Body was medium, mouthfeel was syrupy and cloying. I didn't hate this, it had its charm, but it was just way to one-sided, sweet, fake-tasting for me to want more than a sample at a time.","Rifugium","Jan 25, 2014"

Incredibly intense strawberry character that borders on fresh jam. Ephemeral berry sweetness and light tartness with a touch of earthy notes.

4.61,7.2,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.75,"Reddish orange with highlights of ruby, Strawberry Rhubarb leaves a thin, white head that provides plenty of sticky lace. The expectant aromas of strawberry and rhubarb are joined by a cascade of other notes like brown sugar, wild yeast funk, and earthiness. Overall, the aromas create a delectable pie-filling like wonderment for the senses. The strawberry flavors open on the palate and are quickly met with less pronounced notes of rhubarb tanginess that helps to cut the sweetness of the strawberries. Lurking under the main flavors, a slight aceticness creates hints of sourness that blend wonderfully with the overall impression of homemade pie. Creamy and lightly carbonated, this medium bodied ale proves that Dan and Deb are truly the king and queen of fruit beer.","phishsihq","Jan 04, 2014"

Light mouthfeel with high carbonation makes this super easy to put down the gullet. I was worries I wouldn't like this as other strawberry drinks have not been up my alley.

Nose is reminiscent of strawberry preserves. Taste consistent with nose; however, the rhubarb cuts the sweetness and keeps the flavor profile from being too cloying. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a light, even carbonation and a slight acidity. Overall, another awesome fruit beer from NG.

Smell is of malt and strawberry pie aromas. Taste is much the same with strawberry and rhubarb pie flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite sweet but tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 28, 2013"

Flavor follows with up front sweet strawberry followed by a tinge of malts and a tad of sour rhubarb to finish. Light mouthfeel with high carbonation makes this super easy to put down the gullet. I was worried I wouldn't like this as other strawberry drinks have not been up my alley. But as usual New Glarus hit it on the nose with another fruit beer. Very nicely done.

Smells like a slice of warm Strawberry Rhubarb pie, it's safe to say that I've never smelled a beer like this! The taste is tart with lots of strawberries. It finishes with a sour aftertaste that lingers, very refreshing. I've never sampled a Flemish Red, but this is how I imagine it would taste. It's got a lot of flavor for such a light body. Crisp carbonation. Overall, an extremely well crafted fruit (if rhubarb is considered a fruit) beer that makes a perfect aperitif or accompaniment to a salad on a warm summer, or early fall, evening.","JohnG190","Sep 17, 2013"

Rhubarb is tart, so it is probably contributing to the beer's sour profile, but it is a sour ale, so it is hard to tease out the rhubarb's contribution. However, it lends a tannic finish to the beer that causes the insides of my cheeks and tongue to pucker a bit, which makes me want to have another sip. For me, this means that mouthfeel is integrated into the beers profile in a positive way.

The aroma starts with bright and fruity strawberry with notes of tart rhubarb and mild oak. The strawberry is very nicely represented here, the best strawberry aroma I have encountered in a beer. The taste is full on ripe strawberries which presents a very fresh juicy flavor. This is wrapped around a hint of rhubarb and finishes very clean. Not quite the tart bite that I've grown accustomed to with other New Glarus fruited brews, but the clean finish is very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, another amazing New Glarus fruit beer. Not sure how the Carey's do it, but they know how to incorporate fruit into beer!","homebrew311","Aug 18, 2013"

There was not much of a head on this beer, but there really is not supposed to be. The highlight of this beer seems to be the aroma as it smells much like homemade strawberry jam. If I could not see it, I might not know it was beer. On the initial taste, one gets an incredible amount of sweetness like strawberry jam. I am told that the tartness in the background is the rhubarb. To be honest, I do not know what a rhubarb tastes like. So in regard to the rhubarb, I am just going by the word of others. The sweetness of the strawberry fades as the tastes continues from sweetness to a more seedy berry taste. It makes me curious as to whether the aroma's impact on the initial was exaggerated. The sweetness continues into the aftertaste and is allowed to linger because of the thickness of the beer. The fruit dominates the taste in this beer. I would not say it is better than Belgian Red of Serendipity, but it is another strong effort by New Glarus.","JohnnyHopps","Aug 03, 2013"
