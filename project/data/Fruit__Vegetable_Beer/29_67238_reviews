"Enjoy"

"The Rapsberry taste is definitely prevalent, but I enjoyed the taste. As it warmed, however, it did lose some luster. It's on par for what I'd expect."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting Beer, more like a wine cooler in many ways, summer time beer, served cold and drank cold, as it gets warm the flavor is over powering, raspberry cool-aid comes to mind..."
""
""
"Nice easy drinker."
"Nice Belgian with a hint of fruitiness but not overwhelmingly so."
"Way, waaaay too sweet and fruity. They went over the top with this one. It's not bad, per se, but I wouldn't want to drink more than one at a time. Even then, there are many other raspberry beers that are far more subtle and tasty."
"It smells very sweet and fruity, but the taste is a little more balanced."
""
"This is a Good flavored beer all year round."
""
"I'm literally drinking this as I type, and overall, it's bit of a let down. I disagree with some of the reviews citing it to be sweet- I find it rather bland. Pretty solid mouthfeel, but a complete emptiness on the palate after the initial raspberry. It's not terrible but by no means will I seek this out."
""
"Definite raspberry on the nose and palate. Kinda sweet with a bit of coriander finish. Would be a nice summer beer for the patio but nothing special."
""
"Surprisingly good. Not as sweet as Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss in my opinion."
"Way too sweet with a tart after taste. My girlfriend wanted it so i got her some and it just didn't suit me."

"Overall: Like the other flavored wheat beers I've had from this ""brewery"" this is too syrupy, too sweet, and doesn't taste like it's brewed with natural ingredients. Even the bottle states ""Raspberry flavor added."" Not real raspberries, just the ""flavor"" ..."
""
""
""
"My girlfriend wanted it, I think it wasted some space in my cooler. Very strong ""raspberry"" flavor, not bad if you like that. Reminded me of Leinie's berry Weiss"
"Overall: Nothing complex and not at the top of its style, but it makes for a good summer beer that is drinkable for pretty much everybody."

"Take a Bud, pour in unsweetened raspberry Kool-Aid and you will have this beer. An ok beer to drink once in a while but not one of my favorites. I ended up giving away some of the 6 pack."

"So would I recommend it ? Sure, this is different than those lime lemon high sugar beer thats on the market. And I think this is great beer for women too. For myself I wouldn't buy it all year long but during summer a pack of 12, once or twice, I will definitely go for it."

"Shock Top Raspberry Wheat is a surprisingly crisp, refreshing, and modestly-flavored wheat beer that could've easily been an insufferably sweet/tart brew. The brew fittingly compliments Belgian White and Honeycrisp Apple has pleasantly different options from mainstream breweries, and, again, bests Blue Moon."
"Pours a bright red with an off white head that fizzes away quickly. The smell is all raspberry with little to no hop or wheat. The taste was similar with a very sugary finish. The mouthfeel was also off, too thick for a wheat in my opinion. I can understand why it's popular, it's just not for me."

"The aroma is awesome! Very fruity and strong raspberry smell. It almost bummed me out when I tasted it. A fruity beer with almost a sour character. I mean not terrible but not great. A amber color to it. The aroma pumped me up but as far as taste it fell short for me."
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
"Overall (2.75) : The smell is deceptively enticing. The taste is cloying, but isn't even the good kind of sweet. It's pretty rejecting. The sour wheat comes in full force and drives away the raspberry and forces you to swallow because you don't want it in your mouth anymore. This is a nice beer once in a great while...but honestly, I gave most of my six pack away to friends and family. One and I'm done. Maybe not even that. Try it, but don't buy a whole sixer, you may find yourself trying to pawn off the other five to your friends. ""Here, try this...it's...interesting."""

"Can: Poured a light yellow color ale with a light bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of fake raspberry syrup is quite awful with quite a bit of residual sugars. This is closer to a cooler than beer. Taste is a mix between some grainy wheat malt notes with quite a bit of residual sugar and way too much of the awful raspberry syrup. Body is light with good carbonation. I wasn’t expecting some kind of masterpiece but what a bunch of crap this beer was."

"Worth a try at least, if they're cheap. Definitely worth my $3 for a pint."
"Overall - mediocre beer, maybe worth a try if you're curious but there are a lot of better options out there. Pass."

""
""
""
""
"It's a very sweet and syrupy tasting beer not what I expected. Out of the shock top brews I've had; this one is probably my least favorite it wasn't the worst I've had but it most definitely the worst. It's a little to sweet for my liking it's not the last thing that i'd drink but Try it."
""
"I had my fingers crossed as I loved the Apple Crisp but the raspberry is just too fake and almost brash."
""
""
"O: tastes like watered-down raspberry-flavored cider, no real beer flavor at all even though it's labeled wheat. Not offensive to drink but I'm really not a cider fan."
""
""
""
""
""
"I will be attempting to give the remainder of the case away to friends who ""don't really like beer that much"" but love Granville Island's raspberry offering (an example of this style done fairly well, although it is barely beer). I will also avoid Shock Top in the future. Disgusting."

"Final Grade: 2.97, a C. Shock Top's Raspberry Wheat isn't exactly gross, but it has very few beer-like properties, and for that reason I can't reward it with a decent grade. Ontario residents with a craving for raspberry beer will be better satisfied with Amsterdam's KLB Raspberry, or (even better) the St. Ambroise Framboise, but this is a fairly inoffensive macro substitute that I might consider purchasing again."

"Had this in an outlet mall bar with my wife, while she was on a shopping break. Light amber color, small head with no real lacing. Head disappeared fast. Smell was fragrant and strong of raspberries - taste was similar, but less fruity. More along my wife's taste than mine, but choices were limited..."

"Pours a hazy gold in color with a good 1+-finger fizzy white head that faded down fast to just a thin layer. Decent amount of lacing was seen with each sip. Average amount of bubbles streaming from the bottom and sides of the glass, so pretty middle of the line carbonation. The aroma hits you right of front which of course in raspberries with a hint of grains. The taste is of the same with lots of raspberries, with a sweet but tart finish. Overall, not really bad like you might think and is a good summer/autumn brew."

""

"The attempt at crispness is a little too strong in this beer, coming off too prickly and way too spritzy, though it is at least lively. It takes away from any smoothness the beer might be attempting to convey."

"anyway,Shock Top Raspberry wheat is a very decent Fruit Beer,not quite as good as their Honey Crisp Apple Wheat..but still very,Very Nice Indeed! but I have to admit,the Honey Crisp Apple Wheat is just Amazing! and pretty much my favorite Fruit Beer ever~Cheers&Peace2All."

"During the summer I enjoy a fruity wheat bear or two. I purchased a six on a whim and was thoroughly disappointed. Upon opening, the beer had a fruity aroma of raspberry. Poured into a tulip glass the beer had an amber appearance with lots of carbonation. Upon sipping the beer I noticed a very sickly sweet taste that kept on giving and giving. Carbonation was very heavy thus mouthful was fizzy. Overall, I was extremely disappointed in this beer."

"I've had a few six packs of this beer and like it a lot. It's not fancy but I like the slightly sweet, obviously raspberry flavor. It's almost like a light dessert beer but not so sweet that you can't have it anytime. I'll probably make it a staple everyday beer to have when not going for something unusual."
"Overall- A good fruit beer. While it is not the best raspberry beer that I have had, I have had worse. Much better than the regular Shock Top."

"I had this fresh at the brewery in st Louis, so Im sure my experience with this is better than the average joe buying a sixer in some distant land. this pours a pink tinted thicker wheat beer color with an inch of dying white fluff on top. the nose is really heavy raspberry, tart and fresh. really honestly tastes like fresh fruit too. I am surprised at the authenticity of the fruit in this beer, I thought itd be all syrupy and sweet, and it just isn't. the wheat malt is nothing special, but it is fresh too, and the yeast comes across a bit generic, but the raspberry is the intended star here. this is like the lemon shandy and the apple version were at the brewery, very potent and fresh. its hard for me to knock this, because at the source it really is worth drinking. a little sweet, a little thicker than it needs to be, but for a macro, its quite good when its fresh."

"One of the better raspberry beers I have had. Not the best but definitely would say try. I agree it is definitely a good beer to give to your lady if she's not into beer too much. The ""Beer"" aspect of it is not to complex which is why, and rightfully so it's not outstanding. Typical AB... make a cheap beer and put raspberries in it... I have to say this Is a good beer y time pop can bring with you to a party/beach and pound a few down easy. Very easy drinking and for what it's worth I didn't love it but would not be surprised if I was drinking it again. To me the raspberry taste was not aftificial and not overpowering. Was balanced well but again nothing much in the beer part of it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it was a sweet drink and almost koolaidy without any alcoholic theme. I would drink it again if there was nothing else available but I won't buy it for myself. It seemed like just an inoffensive beverage although I did notice the 5.2% so it must have some effect after a few, yet I would describe it as basically ""nothing special""."

"Overall - a great beer; i honestly really like the taste, especially for the amount of ABV that it holds; a lot of people criticize it for its strong raspberry influence but that's what it is: Raspberry Wheat. Not ""Typical Wheat Beer with a hint of raspberry"""
"Overall: Not a very complex beer. A mediocre wheat beer which is not improved by the addition of raspberry flavor. It is a smooth drinking beer, but the raspberry leaves a kind of cough-drop-like aftertaste which does not leave me wanting another. Kind of a letdown since I am a big fan of raspberries as a fruit."
""
""
""
""
"This is nothing but sugar water. Overall this is exactly like those raspberry seltzer-y bottles of water you can buy at the supermarket. If that's what you want in a beer for taste, then this is your thing. Unfortunately this hardly tastes like beer let alone some sort of wheat brew. Pass."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is among my favorite, everyday wheat beers. Despite the artificial raspberry flavoring, it is enjoyable, cheap, and easy to find."
""
""
"Overall - I thought this was gonna be the best of the Shock Top offerings, based purely on the raspberry factor, but like the crew of the Prometheus, I was wrong. So wrong. This one takes ""The Razzie"" award, pun intended."
""
""
""
"Bored with your normal cheap/on sale beer? This beer is a fun drink. The thick raspberry taste is great! A sweet tasting beer for around $7.00 a six pack. Wheat beer is always creamier and thicker than the normal on sale beer. Add some raspberry flavored sweetener and you've got Shock Top Raspberry Wheat! Stronger buzz at 5.20% compared to 5.00%! A good time for sure!"

"Taste is mildly repulsive...it is kind of jammy tasting with a metallic twang. Leaves a bad aftertaste, like sucking on a rusty nail. The flavor is full of artificial raspberry and does not leave much of the 'Belgian Wit' in it's wake...which is not such a bad idea in the case of the original Shock Top. I was waiting to find this as a single to find out how bad it was...and while it is worth the 1.50 for the experience, Id be hard pressed to finish a sixer of this in a year-long span."
"OVERALL: Every so often, you drink a beer that doesn't resemble beer at all. This was one of those times."
""
""
"Rasberry syrup dominates. Still, there is a little more to it - in the aroma, anyway. There are both better and worse American fruit wheat ales out there. It doesn't even come close to the standard Belgian fruit beers, but being what it is - it is what it is."

"On occasion I like to try different fruit flavored beers. Raspberry smell/flavor comes thru on this bear quite nicely. I also enjoy wheat beers as well, but I rank beers by asking myself if I saw a 6 pack of this beer on sale, would I buy it. Answer is no in reagrd to this beer."

"Overall I think budweiser needs to try a real raspberry beer like New Glarus or DFH to see what raspberry beers can actually taste like before dumping a bunch of sugar and cheap raspberry syrup into a cheap wheat beer and then spending billions on marketing. Better beer sells itself due to the self-evident quality of the product. I'm damn glad that this was a single bottle given to me just to review, because had I bought a sixer of this I would have finished about half of one, cooked with the rest of it, and given the other five away to someone with no real concept of what good beer is."
""
""
""
"Overall-- this beer surprised me. Good use of fruit, bad in other aspects. I personally wouldn't buy this again, but this is certainly a step in the right direction from AB. This would be a great gateway beer I reckon."

"Poured in a pint glass from bottle. Pours a nice, hazy orange with small head that dissipates quickly. Like most everyone else, this drinks like a raspberry soda. It has lots of raspberry flavor and a little bit of hay malt flavor in the background. Very fizzy and watery. It’s not terrible, but it’s just cloying."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – I actually don't mind the regular shock top all that much, so I figured I'd give this one a shot too. This is much worse than the regular version, the taste is way too sweet and artificial. It was really hard to finish this beer, and I really can't imagine drinking more than 1."
"o: Not something I would drink again. I always felt like all the shocktops ahd artificial flavoring added to them, sort of like grape or orange soda. This one is no different. Although the flavor isnt bad, and I imagine young girls trying to break in the world of drinking yucky beer might enjoy it. So if your a freshman in college, you may want to stock up on this to get your date drunk *wink*"
"At the very least, this is a good looking beer. It's got a nice cloudy white-golden body with a large white head. The aroma is very heavy on raspberry with just a bit of grains and wheat in the back. The taste really isn't that bad. It comes on strong with a rush of raspberry that can't help but wind up tasting a bit artificial. Some more tartness would really help here, it's too sweet. The raspberry washes away to a toasty, grainy finish that is fleeting, but still rather nice. The mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated, with a bit of stickiness. The drinkability would be good, but the artificiality is wearing. A more realistic raspberry note over that finish would make this an excellent fruit beer. As it stands, it's just about average. I'd still drink them at a party or if offered to me."

"A pseudo-beer, at best, even though it actually tastes just fine, albeit very innocuous, and definitely inoffensive (my surroundings probably influence this opinion, I must admit). A hollow fruit beer, but really, I get it, it goes down well enough, holds an above average booze quotient, and alludes to a popular fruit - I'm sure that it's more than my better half keeping this one a going concern."
""
""
""
""
""

"Smell, taste, and mouthfeel are similar to drinking a cheap raspberry-syrup winecooler. I almost gagged"
""
"I love raspberries and this beer is not good."
"Before I review, let it be known I do not mind what Shock Top has produced (Wheat IPA and Belgian White are both beers I do not mind). However, this beer is just not good in my opinion. The taste of the fruit and raspberry is overbearing, it made me feel like I was drinking juice that was too sugary. I would explore other beers that Shock Top has to offer, since this one is far and away the worst of what they have to offer."
"O: well, the raspberry just comes out so strong in the taste and the smell that this is really hard to grasp altogether. There's better options out there similar in style that I'll look for over this."

"I just sucked on a store brand jolly rancher candy. This is the pinnacle to the embarrassment that St. Louis needs to address, and fix. This has the smell and taste of a boxed wine sweetened with 7up, artificial everything. I have no idea of what to pair this with, possibly a bottle of the cheapest vodka one could find. Maybe then, a few college undergrads might touch it. Oh well, I was taught how to dislike and apparently society hit this one on the bottle nose."

"Poured this American Pale Wheat Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a cloudy yellow color, a thick white head, retention was excellent and it left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was very much dominated by Raspberry's, citrus and malted wheat. Light in body, this Wheat Ale had a malted wheat base, a splash of citrus (lemon), syrupy raspberry and coriander. Overall, this brew has mass produced written all over it. It is not the worst thing i have sampled from AB but it is also evident that high quality ingredients are not being used. The raspberry flavor is very much artificial. Decent attempt at intimidating a micro brew- but overall- not something I would buy another 6 pack of. Prost!"

"Overall Impression- Where did this come from?!?! I've had both the original Shock Top and also the Pumpkin version and they were not up to par at all! This one was very nice and good all around. If this one just had a tad more body, the flavor could be more distinct but of course, I'm wishing this often with many AB products. Go for it if you have the chance!"

"Overall: See drinkability."
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s decent for a fruity beer but just mediocre overall."
"At first the smell was very good and my first taste was really good. Sam Adams Cherry Wheat is one that I really like, and this is comparable to a certain extent. The after taste is tasteful at first but after a minute or two it turned sour - like a sour patch kid. I also disappointed with the high calorie count for what you are getting (179 per bottle). This is different and unique but lacks with the aftertaste, mouthfeel, and calorie count. Not one that I would pick for a six pack but maybe try once again.."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy gold color (with a few floaties) and about a half inch white head. The head doesn't stay around for long, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is raspberries (more syrup than fresh raspberries) and some wheat. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all raspberries and wheat. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has moderate carbonation and it goes down easy. Not too bad, overall. I'd drink this again in the future."

"O - I really appreciate how reserved the fruit flavors of this beer are. I usually shy away from fruit beers because the tartness or sweetness are just way too much that it doesn't seem like beer anymore. This one strikes a great balance for me and I don't think its a bad offering at all from AB."
"overall this is just an ok fruit beer. about what a drinker would expect from A-B. chicks would probably dig it. nothing great, but nothing bad."
"O – The nose has a great raspberry note, but the wheat in it has a funny funk. The flavor is ok, but the medicinal edge really hurts the beer."
"Pours a cloudy golden/copper color with about a half inch of a foamy head. The scent that stands out above all is the sweet raspberries. Almost reminds me of the scent of a brand new box of fruity pebbles. The taste is smooth and mellow and there is definetly a wheat and a raspberry taste to it. The first part of the taste is much better than the last half as it starts sweet like a lambic and finishes like a dry cheap beer. An interesting concept but definetly needs some improvement when compared to other micro-brews but for an Anheuser-Busch product, this isn't too bad. Something to try once and that's about it."
"This brew could have been much worse than it was, I was interested in trying it since I just had the pumpkin one not too long ago. This one poured out much like the normal Shock Top, kinda hazy with a golden color to it. The head leaves no lacing and has very little retention. The smell of the beer is a little perfumy, almost artificial smelling. The taste of the beer has a pretty nice flavor to it. I was actually please with the raspberry flavor in this one. The mouthfeel was thin, nothing too stunning here really. Overall this brew was drinkable, I didn't mind having a second one right after the first. I can't ever see myself buying it but for free it's not too bad."
"D - As mentioned before, this beer may be appropriate for those who don't like beer. Really a pretty poor example of a fruit based wheat."
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a 1/2 inch fizzy off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of artificial raspberry aromas and perfume. Taste is of artificial raspberry flavoring and fruit roll-ups. There is a perfume-like aftertaste on the finish. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty fake smelling and tasting beer that is not even average in my book."
"O: As you can tell i did not enjoy this beer, Im a big fan of wheat beers and I am always willing to try ones that are infused with fruit. I would suggest you should not waste your money on this beer."
"O: Honestly not bad, wont make me a fan and more for the light craft drinker who likes a little fruitiness with his beer, but I can see the ladies enjoying this, smoother, now to take of the training wheels and do a big boy style."
"M/O: Very raspberry but not much beer flavor or aroma."
"I don't like the artificial fruit flavor. This is a rather weak beer all around."
"Not my style"
"Unfortunately, the flavor goes the other direction. The fruity sweetness again dominates, and the only thing that reminds that this is beer is a dull, yeasty earthiness. In contrast to the aroma, the fruit juice flavor starts to become more and more unpleasantly artificial with each sip. The mouthfeel tries to help, with a light, smooth body and only a mildly tingly carbonation. In the end, however, this just doesn't taste like beer. Light and very fruity, it's more of a fruit juice spritzer than a beer. It's actually somewhat pleasant when viewed from that point of view, though, making it a potentially fine summery change-of-pace or a first stepping stone towards beer for a wine cooler drinker."
"No defense for this one, the other one is alright, this is a bunch of artificial tasting shite. Glad this one bottle in a mixed 6'er"
"My wife loves this because it doesn't taste much like beer. I only the other hand, love beer. Hence the BA membership. This poured from the bottle into a standard pint. Cloudy orange color with quickly dissipating head. The smell was obviously artificial raspberry with a ton of sweetness. Taste was mostly artificial raspberry with a touch of beer. Not really much to write about from a BA standpoint. Mouthfeel was easy drinking. I hate to rate this so high because it's not so much a good brew but that I occasionally enjoy this as a guilty pleasure. I'm sorry..."
"Overall this beer is a mess. Who is the target market here ladies? The gays? My wife who is not a big beer drinker liked it alot. I actually like regular Shocktop. For a macro brew Hef I think it's pretty damn good. The raspberry is just so overpowering in every way it's a little tough to drink. I contemplated a drainpour."
"Pours a golden yellow with a thin white head that has good carbonation, retention and lacing. The nose consists of a very strong raspberry flavoring along with some wheat and maybe some other sweet flavorings, but not really sure. The taste starts out with a fake raspberry taste that follows some wheat and some hops that are hard to taste with the bad raspberry taste in my mouth. The aftertaste has the bad raspberry taste along with a soapy taste that makes me want to grab another beer to wash the taste away. I'll even take a busch light at this point over this light bodied thin watery beer that should be discontinued as soon as possible."
"The mouthfeel seems almost flat. Very thin and watery. The carbonation seemed to be there in the pour but there is a lack of it on the palate. Overall, this is crap. Girlfriend wishes she had never picked it up and was extremely disappointed in it. I didn't expect much, but this didn't even meet my expectations."
"For whatever reason, I found myself compelled to buy this bottle yesterday. Call it the morbid curiosity of the ticker... It pours a mostly clear pale straw topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose is dominated by a clearly fake whiff of ""raspberry", though bits of wheat and light grass make it through as well. The taste doesn't change anything, much to my chagrin. The more I drink, though, the more medicinal the raspberry becomes. Why? This is just kinda mean, now. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a wet, kinda grainy feel. Overall, a pretty sad excuse for a raspberry wheat. Boo this stuff."
"Overall, a good and unique new beer. I enjoyed a glass of it after a brewery tour in St. Louis. Give it a chance before you go bashing it because it is an AB product. This flavor is not quite as good as the Belgian White in my opinion however I would purchase this stuff any day."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by raspberries. Taste is big on raspberry up front, sweet and tart, somne wheat is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"It smelled like girl farts and raspberries...and tasted about the same. I can't even take the time to honestly rate this beer. It is horrible...and I hate myself for drinking it. This was supposed to be a belgian style wheat, but was so far off style, I don't know what you would call it. More like a bartels and james than anything really..."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a 1/2"" white head that quickly fizzles to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice tart fruit scent along with a light pale and wheat malt aroma. The taste is average. It has a light and refreshing pale and wheat malt flavor along with a artificial raspberry character. It has a funny sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a nice summer brew for folks who like generic fruit beers with artificial flavoring."
"O: This is Anheuser-Busch attempting to crack into the craft beer world...and they failed miserably. I would rather have a regular Budweiser (or Pabst to fit into my sweet vintage Pabst glass.)"
"Overall, too sweet and overly fruity. Blech, no thanks."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"I wasn't expecting much when I tried this raspberry wheat. After tasting it, yes there are better fruit flavored wheats out there but this one isn't the worst I've had. I was expecting on first taste for it to be much sweeter. I was glad it wasn't.The mouthfeel I felt was the best part of this beer. It had a bit character, which was also welcome. It's not the most stellar beer of this class I've had, but it was OK."
"D- People actually drink this? like more than one? Why? Its utterly unenjoyable and superbly dissapointing for all the things it could be. With a little more effort it seems that this could be a decent fruit wheat beer (e.g. Sam Adam's Blackberry Wit) instead it comes out as this wild assortment of unfortunate flavors added to a bad light beer base. This is not good."
"O- The taste profile of this and B to the E was interesting and almost the same to be honest. I didn't really care for this but it at the same time wasn't the worst beer I had. If someone bought me one I would drink it...but as far as drinking one myself...no thank you."
"O - Prefer the regular Shock Top over this one. Too much emohasis on fruit flavor and not enough on the balance."
"A good chick beer, not bad for warm weather, wouldn't really want it any other time of the year."
"Served on-tap in a berliner-weisse, the beer pours a bright, pale yellow with lots of carbonation. Almost opaque, with a quickly disappearing head. The aroma will clear the room with syrupy super-sweet raspberry smells. My nose pegged this one at least 20 feet away. It's like cracking a bottle of Clearly Canadian Raspberry (if you have that around you). Super watery feel in mouth, with slight smoothness at the last second, but that may have been my palate recovering from the shock (pun intended). The flavor is sharp, with slight raspberry notes riding the bleh of Shock Top. The aftertaste is watery, and the finish is...you guessed it. Not good at all."
"The body was very light and thin for a wheat beer, none of the solid earth I like in the style. Drinkability was OK, but why bother? Overall, if you like Raspberry Jolly Ranchers, you'll like this beer. Otherwise, avoid it."
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty decent beer for what it attempt to be. May seem a little too sweet at first, but after the initial shock (they do call it shock top after all, right?) your tastebuds become immune to it. Light, refreshing. Not complex, but not dull. I'd recommend trying it once. Might be a panty dropper."
"This is hazy, fizzy yellow beer with a thin white head that fades fast and leaves spotty lace. The smell is awesome because it is nothing but raspberry. Real raspberry and imitation. Sweet and tart. The taste is much better than the regular shock top crap. Amazing what raspberries can do. It doesn't taste like beer, but I enjoy raspberry. The mouthfeel is think, fizzy, and watery. Overall, and easy to drink beer for the summer heat. Nothing special, but drinkable."
"O: Overall, it wasn't bad as far a fruit beers go. It may have been too sweet and could have used more complexity and layers in the taste. That being said, I enjoyed this version more than the original shock top."
"Overall: Skip it. There's far, far better witbiers and better fruit beers to be had out there."
"Overall:Typical BMC product you get what you pay for."
"InBev did buy Budweiser, right? And they brew Hoegaarten right? so they know something about wheat beers. Teach Shock Top. I did not get the strong overly sweet raspberry some tasters got, I found the beer rather bland. Hazy straw, golden appearance, light head that disappeared as quick as poured. Fake raspberry flavor, added not brewed. That sweet kind of candy raspberry. Did find the beer left a flat taste in mouth, not going to drink many of this variety. Only fair in my book, and I would not recommend."
"I do not fell this beer is all that consistent to the style but with that said the raspberry flavor is way to overpowering. The worst part is the more you drink the stronger it gets."
"I always want fruit flavored beers to be good, and this one finally hits the spot. This has a solid head, a pronounced raspberry smell, and a nice flavor to drive it home. It may be a bit too carbonated, though. I will look for this the next time I'm in the mood for a fruity beer."
"Less than a finger of head and it quickly faded leaving spotty lacing. Color is a hazy 3 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is overwhelming raspberry, with some wheat scent and a undertone of malt. Taste is no as good as the smell, quite sweet raspberry flavor, just a touch of roasted corn and wheat. Mouthfeel is watery with quite a bit of bite from the carbonation, has a clean feeling on my palate, and a slight raspberry after taste. The sweetness takes away from the refreshingness of the beer. Because it is sweet, it makes it more difficult to drink more than one at a sitting."
" The flavor is not terrible, it reminds me of fruit flavored teas that have that not quite fresh fruit flavor, like an extract that is added giving the wheat a slight sweetness. The feel has something to be desired, but the wheat is noticeable in the flavor which is a place compared to the raspberry. I personally don't find sweet raspberry flavor as enjoyable as the tart fresh stuff, though. Overall I would pass on this beer, recommended for those who prefer fruit extract flavors, I guess."
"A-B has done a lot to screw-up American beer taste but this one moves them in the right direction, it not all the way."
"This is a lot better than the regular Shock Top. It reminds me of a Raspberry Smirnoff, the ""girly stuff", meets a manly beer. I know too many of these will lead to a wicked hangover!"
"Overall: Meh, it's Shock Top; what can you really expect? It's by no means great but it is refreshing and not overtly offensive (just very artificial tasting)."
"Atmosphere is good. Cloudy, golden color, and a solid head. Nose is basic, but kind of what you'd expect...raspberry and wheat. Flavor is bready and sweet. I think this has been augmented with some sweeteners...seems like it, anyway. Overall, this is decent quaff."
"These craft killer brands are pretty amusing, no mention of Michelob or Anheuser Busch on the front label. Appears pale hazed orange golden hue with a full thick layer of yeast sediment in the bottom of the glass. Shock Top Brewing St. Louis, MO. Bright white head leaves nice scattered lacing. Aroma has upfront tart raspberry jam notes with sharp wheat notes and a hint of citrus. Flavor was a bit too candy with the raspberry addition, the regular Shock Top isn't bad but the natural raspberry flavor added doesn't do it for me. Not sharp wheat just soft bready layers with a bit of chalky yeast flavors going on, minimal spice additions hard to pick up any one aspect of the spices. Look girls will love this stuff, but I'm not sold. Why do the next fruit infused wheat beer, when they could make a real craft style? Mouthfeel is slightly creamy lively carbonation not bad other than the cloying sweetness from the raspberry flavoring. Overall impression is this won't last, I can't believe this would outsell the standard superior Shock Top."
"Appearance is cloudy golden wheat with a hint of orange with a crisp dissapating head and no lace. Smell of light rasberries, spice and adjunct in the back. Taste is again light rasberries, spice and adjunct with a sweetness that tags along. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. A refreshing wheat ale that would go good on a warm summer day."
"Avoid this one at all costs. Yech."
"Cheers!"
"I liked it better when I had it on tap at the AB brewery in Merrimack."
"You can still drink it but you probably won't enjoy it."
"If you enjoy fruity beers this is pretty tasty. If you want something totally different from normal beer this is also fairly acceptable. The color of this beer is light, yellowish. The smell is extremely sweet. It has a very fruity taste which can throw some people off. The overall taste is not that bad. After drinking more than one or two I'm sure it can be a bit much. Overall not a failure."
"O: I'll avoid this in the future. I suggest you do the same."
"This isn't a terrible beer but it is forgettable."
"D - This is a fairly typical raspberry wheat. Not good but not awful, either."
