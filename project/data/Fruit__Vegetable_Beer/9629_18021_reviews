review_text
"Simply put, I adore this beer. It is my go-to for a warm summer day... The strawberry and raspberry notes are reminiscent of a glass of good red wine. Can't get enough... And for 7%+, it's amazingly drinkable."
"Enjoy it fresh from the brew pub. In bottle at times get sour taste."

""
"When I first had one, I was dazzled by the taste and the ABV. The fruitness is good, but as some have said, the taste can get old after awhile. While it tastes ""fruity", there isn't really one distinctive identifiable fruit taste. The alcohol taste is so obscured by this fruitiness that in no short time, you've downed two or three soft parade's and are teetering around in front of a group of 50 mostly strangers singing an Ace of Bass song for Karaoke night (even though it's not actually karaoke night)."

""
""
"This is a good fruit beer. Probably not as good as Founder's Rubaeus. But this is available year round, which is a plus. Not something I would want to drink everyday, but if one's in the mood for a fruit beer, this is a good choice."

"Delicious flavor. No lacing, but that is okay, I loved it. Looked good, smelled good, tasted fantastic for a chick."
"I drank one and loved it. I had another and liked it. Had a third and decided I'd rather have a beer."
""
"Nice smooth taste with little to no after taste.  Would make a good summer beer."

"nice mix of fruit berries in this beer and you can somewhat taste the different ones (compared to most fruit beers I've had one usually takes over) but this one blends nice.  nice red color, smells very good, if you like fruit beers should give this one a try.  higher ABV is well hidden, wouldn't know it was 7.5%.  blush wine drinkers this beer is dead on for same flavors in a beer."
"Very good beer to sip or drink quick if you want a higher abv to get you messy"

"T: The base beer almost reminds me of a tripel. Sweet and malty with a bit of a clove taste to it. But draped over it, you get this heavy mixed berry note with a wet hay-like edge to it. Something in the background tastes like the smell of wet dog. Not really a fan of this one."

"Currently my favorite beer."

"Overall, this was a tasty fruit ale but it was pretty one note. Could have benefited from more body but it is a good alternative to sparkling wine or hard ciders. Good beer but not available in my area, wouldn't try too hard to trade for it"

"I love the ignorant beer drinkers saying this isn't a beer. It's essentially a lower end sour there is nothing wrong with this beer if you enjoy sours. deep fruit tones with that sour finish. not my favorite but not nearly as bad as some of the reviews suggest."
""
"In no way you could call this beer, the closet thing to that is a product that was put out by Oliver wine in Indiana. That product was never labeled a beer, but a wine. If you are a fan of a very  dry wine you might like this, but I did not. I thought it might at least a little sweet, nope."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's very drinkable, but those hoping for an over the top experience are going to be disappointed. It's just an easy going, natural fruit beer with a way higher ABV than it tastes like."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty interesting beer. They say there's rye malt, but it's overpowered by the strong fruit presence. Not necessarily a bad thing, though. One of the more drinkable and complex fruit beers I've had. This is more akin to a wine than a beer."

"I highly recommend Soft Parade (to boys and girls alike)!"
"Purpley amber in color with a finger of head. Very intriguing looking beer. Smells awesome.. Like a berry salad, candy, and a hint of booze to remind you that you're a responsible adult! The flavor is very nice.. Lots of bready rye notes up front leading way to a mellow sweetness and the fruity berries hit you in the finish. Damn, this brings back find memories of smuttynose's hanami ale. Just as ""beery"" with a strong hint of fruit.. Medium in body, medium canon action and a hell of a thirst quencher. This beer is awesome."
"Overall this is a great fruity beer with high alcohol content! It pours light/golden yellow. Aromas consist of strawberry and raspberry. The taste is consistent with the smell with a little tartness and malt flavors. The aftertaste overall is excellent and sweet. I would recommend this beer 100%!!"
""
"Overall a delightful fruity beer even if you are not typically a fan of fruity beverages."
""
"This beer is a little fruity but not too fruity if you don't like fruity drinks. There is still a beer mouthfeel, unlike some other fruit beers out there. Carbonation is not very high, not a big head when poured. Much better from tap than it is in the bottle. I enjoy fruity drinks so I enjoyed this beer a lot but I would also recommend this beer to someone who does not enjoy fruity drinks as much."
"Dark red, ruby color with hints of pink. A little cloudy with a little head. The aroma is delightful--all sorts of fruit notes. I definitely picked up on all the different berries. The taste is just as great. Can taste strawberries and all the fruit. Its a great beer for summer. It tastes and feels light, yet also has strong alcohol content and is so packed with flavor. Definitely one of my favorite beers!"
"Soft Parade is a fruity beer. It has the perfect balance of a beer taste and fruity. This has a very high alcohol percentage. It is around 9% alcohol. The color is an autumn color. The aroma is fruity. I smell strawberry and raspberries. This is a cloudy beer and served on tap and also in a bottle."
"Overall: I love this beer! It is fruity, smooth and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"A beautiful brick red with poor white head and minimal lacing. The smell on the the other hand is robust and very fruity. Strawberry, raspberry, and blueberries all very noticeable. The taste is a good bitter followed by the fruitiness. The alcohol warmth is quite nice in my opinion. A the mouthfell makes this a pretty drinkable brew overall. Id say in the end this is a really drinkable brew without the the artificial taste of berries."
""
"Overall: Really good beer and I would recommend! It is unique in how crisp and fruity it is but yet still very strong and not as filling as some other beers I would compare with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is well balanced -- the fruit is not overpowering and countered with the tartness and a bit of spice and malt. Fruit beers are generally my least favorite style so I'm biased here but this is a fair to good beer for the style. There's enough going on to be interesting if you like the style."
""
""
""
""
"O- a great beer. Having something different is always fun and  I never thought I would like a sweet or fruity beer but then I tried this one. And I definitely fell for it!"
""
"A dark red/pinkish rye ale with little head. It looks great almost like an iced tea. An overwhelming burst of berry aroma and taste. Hard to tell its a 9% ABV, flavors are nice but I think it's more tea-like than beer. Very soft mouthfeel. Overall a good beer but I don't think it's for me."
""
""
""
"I've never tasted a beer with so many types of berries. I have to say i have a overwhelming bias for sweet beers. All the berries flows smooth in your mouth once you have a sip, very easy to drink and just an amazing aroma. I highly recommended for anyone who likes sweet beers."
"Very different feel when you take a sip; it's very light. I do want to correct the ABV, however.  It's 7.5, not the 9 that is listed or the 8 some people have mentioned.  If you go on the Shorts website it says 7.5. You can definitely smell  and taste the fruit. A very different pinkish color."

"Strong fruit smell but amazing almost clear red color. Tastes more like a summer beer. Be careful it tastes very light but hast more than 8% ABV. Very easy to drink but it goes into the direction of lemonade more than beer. Includes blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries."

"This beer was extremely pleasant from appearance, aroma, taste and after-taste. A big characteristic for me is after-taste and The Soft Parade was very discrete. In my experience the higher ABV beers tend to always effect me from an after-taste standpoint, so I was pleasantly surprised with this blend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Short's The Soft Parade is a fruit beer with body, character and a restrained, reasonable level of sweetness - I wish there were more on the market like it. I don't think one can expect much more from a standard(ish) fruit beer and I doubt those berry farmers could be any happier with what came of their hard work (I'd take a bottle of this to a jar of jam any day!)"

"O: A good fruit beer whose target audience maybe the white wine drinker looking for something fruity and refreshing. For me, drier fruit and a bit of Brett could transform it into something special (though I understand that this is not the intent of the brewery). A very nice beer for what it is."

"Overall good beer. Not something I would hunt down but is worth trying if you're in the area. I loved the smell of this beer but feel it needs a bit more complexity."
""
"Another Short’s bottle disaster. At this point I don’t know why I open them."
"O- This beer had me at the aroma. I love the mix of berries in the aroma. The flavor could be amped up a bit, but would it be the soft parade anymore? This is a beer I wish was distributed to Cincinnati."
"Overall this was disappointing. I think they are trying too hard to find a happy median between a rye ale and a fruit beer - these flavors just didn't meld well for me."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours neon pinkish red with nearly no head. Wheaty aroma with big time strawberry wine brings me back to trying to score in the woods freshman year of college with a bottle of Boon’s Farm. Tastes like watered down strawberry juice with blueberry vomit. Dirty dirty wheat finish. Tastes just like when I ""scored", too (well, she scored at least). Wtf is this? Light bodied with low carbonation. This is gross, bro."
""

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a purplish hue with a slightly pinky thin head. A few strands of bubbles rose from the bottom. Aroma was fruity, definitely could pick up berries. Predominant to me was blueberry, with hints of other berries as well. Taste was somewhat similar to the smell, a bit of sweet berry flavor, that shifted to a more grainy finish. The grain flavor didn't mix terribly well with the berry. Some times it was much more pronounced than others. Thankfully the berry wasn't overly sweet or powerful, it was fairly subtle and balanced. Felt ok in the mouth. Coated nicely, but seemed a bit over carbonated. Too many bubbles were felt on the tongue. Overall one of the more successful beers at tasting what it claims to. The grainy finish was a bit distracting though."
""
"Overall: a very good and unique beer. i like using the rye to balance out the fruit to give the beer multiple dimensions. way up there in both fruit beers and rye beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Underrated."
""
"overall: While not a huge fan of fruity beer, for what it is this is perfect for the style. Not too fruity, but enough character to make me want to classify this as, well, not really a beer. I would recommend this basically to any women who likes those fruity beers, as this is a top notch well balanced version of the style."

"Like purple bag of skittles mixed with coors light. Wouldn't recommend or try again. But then again not a fan or fruity beers. But overall too much fruit to discern any specific flavors. Reminiscent of trix cereal due to not being able to tell what flavor this beer was willing to take on."
""
""
"One of the more unique beer's I've tried. I don't really know what to think of this one, it was decent and easy to drink but at the same time very one dimensional. Meh."
"As a regular imbiber of COLT 45 and Molson XXX, I think i know my buzz factors. And i am sure if you are at this site you know it is not easy to achieve such a high % in manufacture, especially when Taste is the main objective. just sayin'...."

"I'm writing this review in case anyone reads it before buying this beer. It tastes exactly like a wine cooler. In a blind taste test I'm not sure if I could tell the difference. It is fermented with blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. You've been warned."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just ok...drinkable but not wowing me either. Misses the mark a bit with some off flavors and a fruitiness that doesn't quite complement the base beer. The base seems to be where the flaws are and the fruit just can't compensate enough. Nowhere near the top of the list for Shorts beers...at least for me."
""
"Berry madness. The ABV strength can be felt but not in a bad way, it adds a nice edge to the heavy fruit feel. Nothing artificial about this one but it does remind me of a good fruit juice mix."
""
""
""
"M&D&O - a fun drink, is well suited for the summertimes. Plenty of nice flavor. The malts arent my thing, but the quality is there"
"O/D-Loved this beer. Drinks like a 5% brew. The flavors are natural and delicious. Kicking myself for only buying a single and not the whole sixer...RASPBERRIES."
"O - If I were the brewer, I would have chalked this on up as a loss, it tastes like a homebrew experiment I tried once long ago, where I added frozen fruit juice concentrate to the boil."

"The beer pours a murky berry red with accents of brown syrup, and touches of salmon orange. The head is eggshell white with light pink highlights, and the lacing is thin but sticky and dry. The beer’s body is surprisingly clear of particles and quite translucent, featuring a steady stream of small carbonation bubbles. On the nose, the beer is big and jammy, with lovely thick berry scents and an excellent barley malt and rye spice background. The smell is reminiscent of “assorted berry” scents, in that no individual berries can really be picked out without really shoving your nose in the glass. The malt smells of light biscuity caramel bread and has me thinking rye toast and jam. On the tongue, the beer tastes terrifically sweet with berries while the more spicy bread malts balance the sweet, and a touch of hops adds slight earthy bitters. The flavor begins with a big rush of fruit berries, moving from strawberry, to blueberry, to black berry, and to raspberry nearly so fast that the tongue has trouble differentiating between them. The berry flavor powers through the mouth throughout the taste, building to a crescendo that tastes a little syrupy and then fading into the aftertaste, but beside the berries there is a strong underlying flavor of spicy rye bread and caramel malt which eventually brings the light earthy bitters onto the back of the palate. The aftertaste rings lightly with strawberry jam, faint earthy bitters, and a touch of aspirin. On the mouth, this beer feels on the heavier side of medium in body with some nice syrupy qualities on the tongue. The mouth is left clean with the slightest dry feeling on the tongue. The beer’s carbonation is light with effervescence, providing a slight prickle across the tongue as it moves down the throat. The beer feels clean and drinkable. Overall, this is one of my favorite non-wild fruit beers. It’s big in booze and in fruit flavors, but still lets you know there is beer beneath it, and it blends those two things very nicely. It has nice the rye flavors underlying the heavy jam, and definitely has some semblance to a fruit wine, which is nicely refreshing. This beer would be great for summer nights, and is really a nice beer. Try it."

"Overall: I guess that I am spoiled with all the New Glarus Fruit beers. I have tried Apple Ale, Belgian Red, Raspberry Tart, and Serendipity; so I have a fairely good idea of what the best fruits beers are all about. This beer isnt horrible, but it is definately a little bit odd in my mind. This beer reminds me of a beer called Pink Killer and its a bit of an improvement from that beer. It is hard to finish the 12oz bottle. I bet Dan Carey could make an amazing fruit beer from the 4 berries that are used to brew this beer."

"I can see why the moniker on the lable offers favorable comparisons to wine, but in the end, it's a pleasant fruit beer that's best enjoyed with a freshly mowed lawn."
"This pours a semi-clear reddish color with a slight white head. The scent is fruity, but it’s not as strong as you would think for the style of beer. The taste is kind of a disaster with the clash of fruit with the “high gravity ale.” This essentially tastes like a cheap 40 that someone dumped day old fruit juice in. It’s hard to pick out the blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. This is something they really need to take back to the drawing board and I think eliminating the high gravity ale is a starting place. Finishes with a slight raspberry taste and chalky after taste."

"I tried, but couldn't get into this beer like many of my friends. It's tasty, but when I want a beer, it's not exactly what I'm looking for. Not ""beer"" enough to be a good fruit beer, and not authentic or sour enough to be a lambic. The 9% ABV is covered up very well, as almost no alcohol is detectable, but I will probably pass on this brew next time."
"Overall - this is a good beer to have at a party. It always turns out to be a hit, and it's reasonably inexpensive ($8-$11 / 6 pack)."
""
"Overall, one of my favorite fruit beers. The flavors are rather subdued, but there's no denying there's a lot of berry in this. Very refreshing, and would be a great beer to have time-to-time during hot days."

"Poured a pinkish-purple gemstone sort of color with a briefly active fizzy 1cm head that settles down with no real lacing. Smells and tastes of dry raspberry and strawberry essence with a much smaller amount of the blueberries in the background, and a sort of musty earthiness framing it all that I presume comes from the rye malt. Stays dry and crisp throughout, light body and carbonation levels. ABV levels are very well hidden. It could use a bit of tartness or a touch of acidity to help make the dryness of it all more interesting."
""
""
"Overall impression: Lives up to the bill. ""Soft"" on all the fruit flavors and still retains all the characteristics that you'd hope for in a beer without losing it's identity. Well done."
""
""
"Musical pairing: Gerry Rafferty's ""Right Down the Line."""
""

"O: Really not all that bad, not my first choice, for sure not my last. A good summer relaxation beer, that is a crowd pleaser and high abv."
""
""
"I was surprised by this beer and it has grown on me. It's one of my fiance's favorites so I usually leave her to drink them but I've been tearing into a six pack over the past couple days. It pours a pink-ish amber color, fairly unique looking, with a small pink-ish white head. It's certainly not a manly looking pour. Nice fruity nose. Mixed berries with a touch of citrus and hops. It has a light mouthfeel that is supported by a bit of bitterness. I thought it was a little thin and could probably stand for a bit more carbonation to make it a bit more on the refreshing side for the lightness. I do like the taste. It's grown on me with each pour. It's strong on the berries, particularly strawberry. It's not too sweet and has a nice bitter backbone. Pleasant overall."
"A nice change, but definitely more alcohol than I would choose for a summer ""session""."

"I absolutely love this beer - it's refreshing and certainly helps beat the heat!"
"Definitely worth a shot, but I will not be buying this again."

"O- Very unique and enjoyable. Thanks Shorts!"
""
"O This beer is outstanding for what it is. And, it is a novelty. In the world of fruit beers, this one really gets it right. There is not much hops flavor, and this really lets the fruit come through and do its thing. This is more like a barley wine with a fruit kick. It is definitely worth a try just to taste a well crafted fruit beer. It is fun to experience the braod range of fermented beverages that can be called beer."

"The last time I ordered this my friends teased me for drinking a beer that looked like Cherry 7-Up. Who’s laughing now? Ahem… now that I’ve brought some bottles to share with a group of friends who loved it. This is a real crowd pleaser that I’m happy to say I enjoy as well."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 7/15/2011. Pours a fairly hazy reddish orange color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense pinkish off white head with good retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big tart raspberries, strawberry, blackberry, cherry, and spices. Nice and pleasant fruit aromas with nice complexity. Taste of lightly tart raspberry, blackberry, cherry, strawberry, pepper, clove, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of raspberry, strawberry, pepper, clove, and herbal spices on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of fruit flavors with spiciness; and a nice bit of tartness to round it out. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel and slightly prickly carbonation. Alcohol is extremely well hidden at 8%, with hardly any alcohol warming after the finish. Very smooth to drink but is still a bit of a sipper. Overall this fruit beer was a LOT more enjoyable than I was expecting. Nice balance of all flavors with good complexity; and very smooth to drink as well. Really enjoyed this one."
""
"Overall this one was pretty good. Definitely not my normal style, but very unique. Picked this up as an extra in a trade and I can't get it in my neck of the woods, but I was glad to have tried it"
""
"O - Overall I would say this is a average beer I expected more out of this beer but it was still worth trying. It did hide the alcohol well so you have to pace yourself on this one."
""
""
"O - I anticipated this beer tasting like a wine cooler with double the alcohol. It was fruity, but maintained some ""beer-like"" elements from the rye and barley. Some of the aromas and flavors were slightly out-of-whack but I appreciated the effort. Not great, but not terrible. My girlfriend would like it more than I did."

"Overall, liked this a lot and could drink it all day, or untill I pass out on a park bench."
""
""

"Overall from some reviews I expected way too sweet fruit juice aspects but got a smooth fruit beer that's tart with little actual beer flavor but just enough malt and carbonation to make it enjoyable. Can't wait to try their other offerings!"
""
""
""
""
"O- if you are looking for a traditional beer with extremely subtle hints, this beer is not for you. If you want a unique beer that tastes like fruit punch and is refreshing, try the Soft Parade."
""
""
"D: I cannot believe the stated abv on this beer – it is just so fresh and refreshing. A bit dangerous really, if this is your mug o’ beer. It is exceedingly drinkable. For me though, fruity / dessert / sweet beers are sort of one and doen. But it is one super nice treat."
""
""
"O - Not really my thing, but I can see why it's such a hit with the ladies. It's a cheerleader beer that's actually *half* beer and not just malt beverage. It is what it is."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. I rally like just how sweet and tart it is and how strong the fruit flavor is. It also finishes really strong with some great flavor."
"Soft Parade is a solid fruit beer that features an interesting mix of berry flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall: Really great beer. Considering the price and availability of this one, I'd pick it up quite often whenever I wanted a tart treat."
""
""
"Saw a sixer of this, it's from Short's, it's high gravity and it's a fruit beer?! Had to pick one up to try. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Soft Parade is a hazy brownish-red color with a thin, soapy white head. The nose is unmistakably berries, mostly blueberries, some raspberries and a faint hint of strawberry. The taste has a similar berry profile with an unexpected bitterness/tartness that doesn't complement the beer. There is a faint malty backdrop but this reminds me more of a wine cooler than a beer. The mouthfeel is a light medium body with a moderate carbonation. Overall, worth trying, I'm still impressed that it's 9% because it is not noticable but not one I will be searching out in the future."

"Overall: Not a bad brew! Very tasty fruitiness without being cloying at all. My wife noted that it was a bit too bitter and dry for her liking, but I enjoyed it!"

"Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this. Kevin said that this used to be called ""Ye old panty dropper"" before it got bottled. After pouring, I can see why! Poured from bottle into boulevard tulip. Pours a rich raspberry color, nearly transparent, nearly no head on it. Smell- tart strawberries, raspberries, powdered sugar, juicy fruit/koolade concentrate. Definitely a candy nose to it. A bit artificial. I read in previous reviews that it resembles a sour on the nose- I couldn't disagree more. No sourness here, it is all candy sweet. taste- on the front of the tongue, there is the blueberries! It doesn't manifest itself on the nose at all, but it presents itself at the front of the palate. Strawberry sweetness on mid palate. Rich carbonation makes for a dry finish, distracts from the sweet nature of this beer. Overall, I like this beer, and although I probably lost man points drinking it, this is an interesting and unique beer that I enjoyed."

"Very tart on the flavor with a fair dose of alcohol and rotting fruit. Low on the sweetness and actually drinks a little more like a sour than a 'fruit beer'. ABV is well hidden and this one gets better as it warms. This is a fine brew that I wish I had access to on a regular basis. The nose and pour of this had me thinking infection at first, but now Im not so sure. Whatever it is, I like it...sour, funky and fruity."

"O: Best Short's to date. B+ to A- for sure if a fan of the funk and sours."

"By far the best beer I've had from Short's. Their yeast strain works much better with a beer like this than traditional offerings."
"Taste is nicer than I remember, still light, but pleasant. some faint blackberry notes, and again, earthiness is present. Thin mouthfeel with little noticeable carbonation. a bit watery. no noticeable alcohol at all. overall, not too bad. Not sure if this would really appeal to wine drinkers like the initial goal was. I wish this was fruited a bit more."
"Mouthfeel is good, a medium body edging on the lighter side with some carbonation. It's crisp up front and smooth in the middle, making for easy drinking."
"I haven't had a ton of Short's offerings, but so far my impressions have been all over the map. This one I'm not all that into, it's just decent and not much more. I feel like it's aiming for something somewhere between a tart Belgian fruit beer and those great Samuel Smith fruit ales, but not quite getting there..."
"O- This beer is ok. I can appreciate and enjoy a fruit beer more than most BAs, but this was too heavy and alcoholic. The fruitiness was definitely there in full force, but also had some flavors to keep it from being refreshing and enjoyable. Not terrible, just not great..."
"O- This beer is decent and enjoyable, strong fruity (berries) flavors upfront with a slight sourness, the abv is hardly noticeable for being 9%, not the best representation of the style but it does the job."
"I’m a big fan of Short’s Brewing Company. Unfortunately, Soft Parade is one of their weaker releases. It’s not a total disaster, but the fruit flavor seems to be lighter than it should. It also just works okay with the flavors. It’s not exactly a symphonic masterpiece. Short’s is a fantastic brewery. This is not one of their stronger releases. It's just okay. If you're into fruit beers, you might like it. Just my $.02."
"It's nice the way that the different fruit flavors come together to form a synergy. This is similar to the way that a juice blend can form a more complex flavor than any individual juice. The flavor is more subtle than many fruit ales, but this isn't a bad thing. A light refreshing summer drink."
"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one. Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a vibrant red-orange with half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, berries, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, and a shit-ton of berries. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The alcohol on this one was very well hidden behind the massive on-slaught of berries that it created. However, I happen to like fresh berries from time-to-time, so this brew really suited my palate quite well. So if you are not a fan of berries avoid at all costs. If you are, you have to try this."
"O/D - Initial pour had me pulling for this one. However, that ended up being the best part. Some sips showed promise, especially as it warmed, but not enough coming through to make it stand out."
"The mouthfeel is particularly pleasant, the lasting flavour varying throughout. For a beer as dry as this one, the carbonation allows for a smooth and refreshing brew which goes down quite easily. I wish I had some fresh goat cheese and cranberry preserve on hand."
"Lighter body, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is present, and adds some warmth. A very interesting beer here."
"Overall: This beer is as delicious as Wayne Coyne is positive. I've always said if I could be related to any celebrity it would be Wayne Coyne. He's just a stand up classy guy. This is a stand up tasty beer. I wish I could come by Soft Parade more readily here in CT, but I can't so my dream to have Wayne Coyne as an uncle is only slightly less realistic than me finding more of this beer nearby."
"This beer poured out as an pinkish orange codor with a pinkish white head on top that had a really good retention to it. The smell of the beer was fruity, similar to a wine cooler. The taste of the beer had rye in it which I didn't realize until I read that on here. Now that I'm aware of the rye being in there I can now place the taste or feeling I was getting in the beginning of each sip. The other flavors are dominated by the sweet wine like fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, it's well carbonated and kind of refreshing. Overall I think that it's decent but not my favorite."
"Final thought - Get this one, any way you can"
"Received a bunch of Short's beers as extras, time to do the line-up. First pour is the Soft Parade. Bubbles shoot around in the pour, but almost no head appears, simply a pithy white foam, reduces to a ring around the glass. Color is vibrant, deep red with a burnt orange tint. Aromas have a touch of tart berry fruit, smells like a really light lambic. Flavor is mild and lightly acidic, flavors of earth and berries, light overall, but satisfying. Finish is lingering with and herbal earth note, fruit dissapears quickly. Overall a solid brew, full bodied, but mild fruit flavors. Interesting."
"If you like fruity beers, you'll enjoy this. If fruit isn't your thing, you'll hate it. I liked it, not the tastiest fruit beer I've had, but pretty good. However, the cloying sweetness and kind of one dimensional flavor prevent it from being overly drinkable."
"Overall- I kind of had low expectations coming into this one, but I was actually pleasantly surprised, this fruity concoction actually kinds the high ABV very well and I only get a few mild hints of the alcohol when it really warms up. Great sweet fruity flavours on the aromas that really come through in the tastes, you can almost taste every single berry added at one point or another when drinking one of these. I definitely have a soft spot for fruit beers in the summer and this is close to the top of the list of fruit beers that I would drink, although probably better suited for your girlfriend this is a quality drinker for anybody and well worth a try, and I rather enjoyed it."
"But despite the beer, she's still my good sister."
"D - If the ABV is correct on this listing, I could see how this could be a deadly little brew that would sneak right up on you. I would have assumed half the ABV if I were guessing. A tasty little brew from Shorts...certainly not world class but a good fruit beer to quaff on a hot Summer night."
"Medium bodied, higher carbonation, a bit prickly and sticky on the tongue. Definitely another unusual Short's beer, and a nice use of fruit without turning the beer into a complete juice cocktail."
"O - Refreshing, but a touch sweet due to the fruit."
"O - Not much flavor to it. I would like to have seen more fruit flavors poke through. Very easy to drink. Would not go out of my way to have another one, but I is not terrible."
"Overall: Interesting concept but could have been executed a little better. As I said before, make this a sour and its a big time winner! Not a bad beer by any means but it would certainly be more of a non craft beer drinkers beer as it tastes more along the lines of a mixed drink."
"O - As listed above, doesn't really fit either style, but enjoyable either way. (It doesn't really say it's a particular style anyway). Excellent alcohol hiding and nice twist on a Belgian style ale."
"Overall a great beer. A fruit beer that I didn't feel was too ""girly"" or too ""Mike's Hard Lemonade"". Very well done by the guys at Short's."
"Overall, this would make a great dessert beer, or perhaps even a drink best saved for a hot Summer day. I appreciate the style, but it's just not something i'd go for normally. Glad I got to try something from this Northern MI brewery."
"Bottle shared at the May Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a blush wine color with an airy white head. Raspberries and strawberries are strong on the nose with a solid tartness. Yogurt and cheese are also very distinct. Berry yogurt flavor with an even rye maltiness midpalate. Alcohol is well-hidden but still a little noticeable."
"Pours a murky strawberry jam color with a 2 inch light red head that fades to a very thin cap. Bubbly rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. This beer smells like various berry jams. Some mild grain smells come out too. Taste is also of various berry jams with some grains (wheat perhaps). There is a bit of medicinal bitterness in the aftertaste. Carbonation is quite high and has a very prickly feel going down. Perhaps a little too much carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice fruit smells and tastes but it's nothing too exciting."
"D - Interesting fruit beer to say the least - I was hoping for something with a fruit taste if it had 200 lbs of fruit added to the mix. It reminded me of a fruit spread and a fruit smoothie...almost like a hybrid between the two. I have really been looking forward to trying something from this brewery and have to thank Pittsburghkid for the opportunity."
"O (D) - there are some weird flavors in here that do not fit. So I don't care that much for this beer."
"I am just not a fan of fruit beers at all. Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a red color with a small pinkish head. Aroma is of quite fruity and fairly tart, the raspberries and strawberries are what I smell the most along with some sugary notes. The flavor is slightly tart and very fruity with alot of raspberry along with some sugary notes and the 9% ABV is really well hidden. The body is light with a slightly dry mouthfeel. Overall a pretty solid Fruit Beer, but fruit beers like this arent really my style, this was more fruit than beer IMO."
"O: this is an ok beer, that I don't think i would seek out. i dont know if i would drink it again either."
"First off, I went in expecting Leinie's Berryweiss, and was pleasantly suprised that it was not that type of drink. It is nowhere near as sweet, fruity, or, well, blatant as BW. A nice crisp berry scent, which is balanced in flavor by the malt. I can see myself having a few of these at the beach, or maybe a picnic in the summer. Is it a ""chick beer""? Maybe. Is it strong enough to knock you on your ass if you underestimate it? Yep. It's not Zima, It's not Boone's farm, it's just kinda....good. Give it a shot!"
"a reddish pour of something cloudy. With a very little reddish head. Of three fingers. Nose of berry and grain. Sort of a jungle juice of all the berries with no particular hints of alcohol. Palate is strawberry pulp and mild crisp of dryness. Great fruit and summer high alcohol beer. Soft fruit tart mild wheat husk and i subtle woody bitterness."
"Taste is thin, slightly tart, and finishes like Kool Aid with a bit of a kick. I expected intense fruit flavour or typical beer flavours accented with fruit; this is neither. It’s thin and vaguely sweet, almost like fruit flavoured diet pop. It has 9%ABV and doesn’t taste like much at all. If I tasted this blind, I don’t think I would even guess it was beer. It’s not an unpleasant drink, but not what I expected from any sort of beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp but not thin, and carbonation is surprisingly not very high. The weight is just right and the finish is neutral thanks to the malts. Just a bit of tingling on the tongue from carbonation/fruit is a nice touch. Drinkability is through the roof; who doesn't like fresh fruit? It isn't too sweet in my opinion either. Really great beer in my estimation."
"Overall meh, lots of fruit, too fruity, a bit boozy, very yeasty too!"
"Drink and overall: Honestly, this is like the tenth time I've had this beer. I am now ticking it. I thought going in, it would be a C+ beer, but I think I'm going a little higher. I enjoyed it more this time as I gave it time to develop and really look into the complex body. Good work again Joe."
"O overall this was a good beer.I thought the berries would be too overpowering when i originally smelled this, but it turned out to be nicely balanced. I will be seeking this out again through trade."
"Received in trade from jbck109 thanks for the opportunity. Pours a slightly cloudy pink color with a huge fluffy white head that recedes slowly but sticks itself to everything in site. Smells fruity and tart. Non descript tart fruit is really all I can find in the nose. Where's the beer? Taste is again sweet fruity and tart. I get lots of berries in the taste. A bit of sweet sugar in a relatively dry finish. Bubbly carbonation, light to medium body, slick sweet syrupy mouthfeel. Well this isn't horrible, I could drink it. Calling this beer would be a bit of a stretch, but the biggest thing is I find this boring and lacking complexity. Glad I got to try this, but one and done for this guy."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but I was hoping for more from Shorts. The advertised rye really does not show up. Super sweet in the lines of Leinie's berry weiss. Be careful the alcohol is well hidden. My least favorite from Short's so far."
"d - looked great, smelled great, and tasted pretty good...but seemed like a watered down glass of blush wine. unique but not really my thing."
"One side note: it is strange for a company that seems to have unusual and archaic demands for the freshness of their product to not feature a prominent datecode"
"This was a pretty interesting side-by-side tasting of an unconventional beer. I do think the fresh Soft Parade has the slight edge on the much different aged version. But I did think it was pretty interesting that the year-old example took on some Belgian-like characteristics in the aroma and flavor. Neither was fantastic but this was still a fun experiment."
"This is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is absolutely hidden and the carbonation is perfect. I am really into things that taste like this that are not beer and absolutely loved this one. Another winner from shorts."
"Very good beer. Obviously fruity as it states but not too sweet. Looked perfect when i poured it to the glass from bottle. nice head. have nothing bad to say about this beer, as is usual with Shorts. Love their stuff. Cant wait to visit their brewery soon to try out other stuff."
"The beer pours a murky red berry color (surprise surprise). It's a little bit darker than strawberry, but not quite raspberry deep red. The head has a slight pink hue about it, and tops out at about two fingers in height. Retention and lacing are both serviceable, but ultimately unimpressive. The nose is essentially pure raspberry, with just a little bit of blueberry added to the mix as well. Blackberry finally shines through as it dominates the flavor, giving a tangy bitter quality to the beer. I was expecting/hoping for a little more sweetness supporting the beer, as well as a more vibrant berry flavor. The body is impressively (and necessarily) light for a beer it's size, as the thought of a weighty fruit beer isn't a pleasant one. The carbonation though is a bit overbearing and distracts some from the fruity flavors trying to shine through. The Soft Parade is a decent beer, but I suppose I had higher expectations based on some of the more experimental beers they've brought to festivals."
"12oz. bottle courtesy of seeswo. My first Short's beer. Handmade by people who care on 032310. Served in my Maudite tulip. Pours a bright, translucent copper with a half inch, loose, off-white head that sizzles and pops as it slowly dissipates into a broken froth and a creamy band around the shoulders. Nose is musty and also slightly metallic with a suggestion of fruit syrup towards the back. Taste - not great. Tart, acidic, artificial fruit flavors, a metallic quality and some bitterness towards the finish reminiscent of grapefruit seed extract. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is prickly and gassy. It's also fairly acidic, and not in a good way. Well, this is pretty much undrinkable - I got through about 1/3 of the bottle before having to do a drain pour (not something I do very often). I just couldn't get through this one."
"-""Still Spoiled By New Glarus Fruit Beers"""
"Drinkability: To sweet, almost like drinking to many fu-fu drinks. I will say though, I can not tell that this is 9% ABV!!!"
"Nice on a hot summer day, though the abv creeps in a bit after awhile."
"This is very drinkable and and doesn't seem 7+%. My Wife loves this beer so I buy it a lot. It certainly took me a while to finally review this."
"Drinkability: I think the fruit and the sour flavors and rye in this one clash a bit. That being said I think it would be a good brunch beer."
"D: again other than the high carbonation, i enjoy drinking this. love the sharp fruit flavors and the overall quality. pretty good brew."
"Pours a trasparent dark-cherry pink color with sizable pinkish white head. Smells like a mixed drink - like a cosmo or something other berry/booze concoction. I don't really have any idea what to think of that, so I'll evaluate it on how pleasant we found it, which was a pretty mixed bag. Tastes like a very carbonated fruit puree potpourri. There is a bit of perfuminess as described by the potpourri flavor that is not plesant. Sweet, but not overly so, which was welcomed. It as certainly interesting, but really didn't come together for us - we did not finish the 12 oz bottle between 3 people. The mouthfeel was not too sweet, not too dry, but over-carbonated. The somewhat off perfumey flavor limited the drinkability, outside of my personal bias against the drinkability fo the style."
"I really enjoy this beer, as it has a lot of character. The seductive color and pretty pinkish head, sweet, fruity nose, and crisp, tart, fruity flavor make for one tasty beer that has both lambic and wine-like qualities overall. This is a fruit beer that i think appeals well to both men and women, as its not too sweet and not too dry. And at 9%ABV, i can certainly see why they call this one ""Ye olde Leg Spreader"" :)"
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with adequate carbonation."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer. I find the problem with most fruit beers is that the fruit flavor is either too weak or it comes off as artificial, this beer was neither. This would make a good gateway beer for girls looking for something tasty without being bombarded by hops and malts. Great job shorts, keep thinking out of the box."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly above average carbonation. Drinkability is average, it showed some nice fruit flavors at times but also had some kind off, bitter, sour flavors at other times. Not awful, but at the same time not that great either. Given the ""off"" flavors I thought were there this could be another Shorts beer that has problems in certain bottles/conditions, but who knows."
"Even considering this beer for what it is supposed to be (for non beer drinkers) I can't get behind it. Pours with no head at all. Pinkish hue. I get all the bitterness from these berries but none of the sweetness. The nose is of sour with a touch of fruit, neither is very strong. It is taking me a while to get through this beer."
"An interesting experiment of a beer. Realizing the Short's designed this for women who don't like beer I find it ironic that they basically created the beer version of Arbor Mist, which was designed for people who don't like wine but are ""too classy"" for wine coolers."
"Faint haze, nice reddish colour with a short cap of off-white foam that really lingered. Spotty lace. Berry aroma, not intense but quite fruity. Strawberries, raspberries - it smells ""red"" - with a little earthiness and sweeter fruit notes, sort of like a fruit punch. Light bitterness balanced the fruity sweetness. Slight sourness, more berries, light citrus in the finish. Medium bodied with average carbonation, decent texture. Quite tasty and one of the better fruit beers I've had in a while."
"This beer pours a muddied, dark dark crimson in color with no head. It looks great and is ultimately cloudy and looks delicious. It smells like strawberry jam. I love it. I've never smelled anything quite like this one. I especially like the aromas because it's unique but it is exceptionally sweet as far as aromas are concerned. The flavor is far too subtle. I expected much more from this. It looks spectacular and smells amazing yet it leaves you scratching your head with the flavor. It could've been so much more! It has FOUR berries! Heavily feature one of them please! Instead it's like a watered down version of Rubaeus. It drinks smoothly and has good carbonation but is a little too flat. This beer sounds great but drinks into mediocrity."
"Drinkability: Intriguing, as a fruit beer, but the mouthfeel was a real problem; I don't see many other reviews noting the overcarbonation so I must have gotten a bad bottle"
"Reviewed on 1/31/2010. Bottle thanks to TheCheeseman. This one exploded all over my kitchen; however, I was able to save about half the bottle. Pours a cloudy red with a thick, foamy pink head. Aroma of a mess of fruits -- strawberry, blackberry, raspberry. Flavor is mostly dominated by the strawberry and blackberry. Decent fruit beer; certainly better than some although the palate is weak."
"were going for."
"This beer pours with alot of carbonation as expected., considering all the different berries.The red hues is a nice look. The berry taste so delightful on your tongue. Being this is such a drinkable beer beware of the results after too many...thank you SHORTS for a nice beer"
"In the end this is a drain pour for me. I simply have no desire to take another sip."
"Pours into a reddish colored body with a thin reddish white head. It has some retention, little lacing and decent carbonation. The best thing about this beer is the smell. The first thing that hits the nose is a mix of fruits, most noticeable is strawberry and raspberry. Like smelling some homemade jelly or jam. The taste is a fruity taste of different berries mixed with rye and the alcohol taste and carbonation gives it a sweet wine like feel to it. The mouthfeel is a medium bodied beer that clings to the lips and tastebuds and if you like a strong sweet fruity beer than this is a beer for you. It is a drinkable beer and when ever I feel like having a fruity beer in the future I'll be sure to pick up a six pack of this. Now all i need to do is try Short's Uber Goober and PB and J beers."
"D - This is quite drinkable. It goes down easy, and it is pretty different from the beer that I usually drink. This isa very interesting beer, and if I was in the right mood I would get this one again."
"D - this actually grew on me, slightly. still, pretty ugly to look at (like a lot of Short's brews) and comes off as trying just a bit too hard (again, Shorts). not completely bad, and a good change of pace through most standard beers."
"D- The ABV is well hidden in this beer. It delivers as a fruit beer should. A little girlier?? Maybe but the ABV isn't. It's easy to lay down a sixer of these without trying. I don't know if that's a good thing yet or not ;)"
"drinkability- very easy to drink because of the nice balance between fruit, hops and malts. it's high gravity but not boozy."
"Very drinkable dessert beer. I wouldn't want to session this, as it starts to taste like a wine cooler after about 3/4 the way through the bottle."
"Overall- This is not bad. I would drink it again, but I wouldnt want to commit to a full six pack. If I can find more singles of this I would pick it up every now and then."
"D - One and done for me, but it was enjoyable"
"Perfect beer for your wine/wine cooler drinking wife. Personally I will pass."
"overall simply wonderful and something i would have no issues with going after again. another winner from shorts."
"Decent, but I doubt I'd have more than one in a sitting. Plus shorts is difficult to find in my area. I'll give it some brownie points for being high ABV but easy to drink. If I had it fresh on tap, I'd definitely try it."
"Pours a beautiful pink ruby with a nice lightly-tinted head that has a bit of a reddish character. Nose is soft fruits with quite a few different berries; the strawberry really came through to me with the blueberry coming through to a lesser extent. Nice blueberry and strawberry flavor throughout. In the end, the feel was pretty decent and it drank well enough, but the unique concept only lasted for a bit before this started to taste less interesting and wasn't much to keep me drinking."
"Picked this one up in a recent trade, and split it with my wife tonight. Poured a very murky purplish-brown color, with a big, off-white head, that is shot through with pink and purple swirls. Tart berries on the nose, along with a hint of orange juice. On the palate, this one is medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, lightly tart, with some fruit flavor (though mostly citrus). Pretty drinkable, but nothing I'll try to find again."
"D: I like it and I could drink another. I do think I would buy 6."
"Another thieved bottle from my brother. Good man, he. It pours a clear pinkish-red topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises mixed berries (all sorts of 'em, baby), with a minor undertow of medicine. The taste brings back the berry bushels, dragging along some flowers, cobwebs, and a light rubber. The body is on the lighter side, with a moderate carbonation and a relatively dry finish. Overall, I didn't really enjoy this brew all that much. It sounded pretty tasty, but it seems it was executed a bit poorly."
"Tasted from bottle. Pours pink orange with a thick pinkish head that leaves solid lace. The nose is super fruity with strawberry dominating and a toasty malt backbone that is just underlying. The flavor is more blueberry dominant with the toastiness a little more pronounced. The body is light with heavy carbonation and a medium fruity finish."
"D: the mixed berries are huge in this, and it could get tiring after a while, with the big sweet and sour thing going on. also a pretty big beer at 7.2%. or is it 9%?"
"Bottle. Pours a very strawberry red color with a slight ligtly pink head. The aroma is not as sweet as I would have thought with some strawberry but also some sort of offputting aroma that I can't put my finger on. Hmm, the taste is well kind of blah. Some strawberry, pretty muted fruit flavors. Light mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation when you drink it. Almost has a malt liquor taste like zima to it. This one is not a winner for me and I really like Shorts. Maybe needs to be fresh from the tap to really get the full effect."
"Pours a hazy pink-ish to red color with a light pink head. In the aroma, dry fresh berries. In the taste, dry berries, not sugary of sweet fruit at all, more ale like. A smooth and light mouthfeel, with a dry berry aftertaste. Not sugary, not fruity girl like either."
"Short's must have made their reputation on the rest of their lineup because Soft Parade is not good beer. This is one parade that I'm not interested in joining, watching or drinking."
"D: not sure if i want to try this again. it wasnt a bad bottle, just a bit strange but not in a good way"
"Pinkish red color with a large pink head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the glass. Looks very good for a fruit beer. I smell mostly blueberries and strawberries. I also detect some yeast of the Belgian variety. A nice aroma but not overly strong and easy to pick out the various qualities. I get a lot more malt and yeast in the flavor. The berries are still there but it is more in the finish. Strawberries being the berry I mostly taste. Something about fruit beer mouthfeel that I find unappealing. It sort of disappears from the mouth leaving a strawberry aftertaste. Not a beer I would want more than a 12oz bottle in a day, but it has good flavor and overall a better than average fruit beer."
"Wouldn't seek it out, but it was okay."
"Notes: Really different, never had a beer of this fashion so I have nothing to compare it too, but I liked it and I would definitely drink it again."
"As if all this isn't enough to indicate so, Soft Parade is easy to lay down, and I'd take a session any day. Just not every day. I can't wait to pour this in front of friends and hide my smirk as they remark about the color before fully experiencing it. A proud example of its breed."
"drinkability gets better as you get accustomed to the way the yeast and fruit work together, though it never works for me. Relatively different, but not one I will be heading back to very often."
"M- I wish this were more carbonated to help with a crisp biting feel. Instead the carbonation is fluffy and light."
"D-The carbonation level is pretty appropriate for this beer. If I were to change anything, it would probably be to leave out the blackberries as I feel they contribute heavily to the lingering aftertaste I experience, which I'm not a fan of."
"As far as fruity beers go, this is a cut above the rest. It is much more beer than fruit."
"Sure, I'd drink this again....it just might not be the first 'fruit' beer that I'd grab. I like my fruit beers to be prominently fruit-forward."
"Pours a hazy, translucent, really reddish mahogany - quite appealing to the eye. Malty aroma has a strong overtone of berries, especially raspberries. Raspberry dominates the flavor, which includes hints of blueberry and strawberry as well as malt and hoppy bitterness. Jazzy, tingly, fizzy texture leaves a lively finish."
"D: this brew is actually pretty damn good considering its a fruit beer. It drank well and was more complex than expected."
"I've had this in my fridge basically since the day I got it, so whatever happened happened before it got to me. But this beer was literally undrinkable. I've had very few drain pours in my life, this was unequivocally one of them."
"D: This was a one and done for me. I really was hoping for something more exciting and interesting, but was left disappointed."
"D: From the description on the bottle, I would've expected a bit more complexity, and honestly, a bit more flavor overall. The substance is there but is completely watered down. Worth a try if you can get your hands on it but really not my mug of beer."
"Please be advised as with all my reviews this one is IMHO. I do not have nor claim to have training in reviewing beers. I' am a simple guy who likes beer. If I do not like a style of beer I will not review it. Although I do keep the style guidelines in mind. All my reviews are simple and short. I tell you IMHO what I think of the beer and how I feel it tastes for that style."
"Medium body for a fruit beer. Good carbonation. This is very easy drinking. The wife liked it, as did the 3 guys that sampled some. Maybe not something I would drink regularly, but certainly worth a shot if you like fruit beers or red wines like Malbecs."
"D: Goes down quite easily, somewhat filling, 7.2% ABV gives it a good kick with out any discernable alcohol flavoring. I could have a pint or two of this again."
"Pours pinkish brown with a one finger lightly pink hued head. Smells like the berry medley that is promised on the label with some breadiness. Taste is all the berries from the smell, with a little bit of citrus and some very light tartness in the finish. I get breadiness but not necessarily rye. Mouthfeel is relatively thin, highly carbonated. Goes down pretty easy for a self describe ""high gravity ale"". Overall a very good fruit beer. The sort of strong effort I've come to expect from Short's."
"Poured from a growler into a pint glass. Sweet fruity strawberry aroma. One finger head. Murky brown with red hues. Taste starts with a little bit of the fruit followed by notes from the malt bill. Finishes with a medium bitterness. Well carbonated slippery mouthfeel. Overall it is a unique tasting fruit beer. Although there is some alcohol in the flavor profile it doesn't stand out as being 9%."
"One of the most enjoyable and well-crafted fruit beers I've ever had."
"The mouthfeel is pretty slick. There is also a pretty high level of carbonation. The one really nice thing is there is no sign of the ABV at all and it drinks quite well. Even though I particularly didn't enjoy the taste I has no apprehension finishing the bottle."
"I have had this beer on tap before, but it's generally been enjoyed near the end of a hard night of consumption. This was the first time I had the pleasure of drinking it from a bottle. I wouldn't recommend it for the average beer drinker, it's not a ""crowd pleaser"" by any means. However, if you don't mind lambics, this one is definitely worth a shot."
"This is a sipper, but refreshing and fun, light hearted. Sweet, carbonated, and easy."
"A pretty unique beer that is worth checking out for sure."
"Worth drinking and enjoying the rest of the 6-pack, may not buy it again though."
"D: for the summer (or anytime for that matter) a must buy throughout the season. For a fruit and vegetable beer I find it one of the more quaffable ones. I usually steer clear from these types of beers...just not a personal favorite of mine. However, this one has the right elements for good drinkability"
"Nice brew from Short's!"
"D: A rather unexciting beer that became almost annoying to drink. The wife refused to even taste it."
"I disliked every moment of drinking this one. Never again. No way."
"D - Yuck, more like drinking juice, seems like a beer made for people who don't like beer. Can't do any more of this."
"D: this beer is a bit of a disappointment. It kind of screws with my head because it initially tastes pretty bad, but leaves a quite refreshing after taste. Too bad this one just doesn't come together"
"Taste-Berry fruits, wheat. Subtle flavors, nicely balanced, very refreshing. An excellent warm weather brew. A fine balance keeps this beer in line. What could have been a cloying mess is instead easy on the palate, refreshing, and very drinkable with the alchohol well-hidden in a tangy and tasty offering for the hot summer months."
"D-Not really my bag. A mess of fruit and no malt to back it up. I might like this better if they had thrown some bugs into it and soured the beer. Maybe next time"
"This would be a great beer to hit with the bugs. A bit one dimensional and being the little ""sister"" to the Imperial version doesn't leave the same impression."
"I've heard good things about Short's and some of their offerings. I don't think this was one of them. Very unbalanced and overly fruity. I would say that I won't drink this again, but I have five more bottles to go through..."
"Overall, pretty disappointing. The taste is and aroma are bland and boring, barely any fruit in here at all. Don't bother drinking this."
"Very unconventional and satisfying. It's 60F, sunny and breezy outside and this offering is doing me just fine. I love the slight sourness of this ale, along with the bitter, chalky hop profile. It really mixes well with the fresh fruit - giving lots of balance and dimension. I believe I'll make room in my fridge for this ale for the Spring & Summer months."
"Strong and decent for a fruit ale. Great fro mixing with stouts."
"D: Refreshing, not light by any stretch, the ale packs a bunch of fruit into a small package. It's no Strawberry Short's Cake but I'd take another bottle."
"D - Would like more of the fruit flavors, I don't know if this is an older bottle, but it would seem given the amount of fruit that is in it, it would come out more."
"Overall a great beer to sniff. Not so much when you take a sip. i'm glad I got to try it though."
"O: Easily blows the bottled variety of this beer out of the water, and then some. All Short's is better on-tap, no question about this."
"The palate isn't as awful as the nose, but that isn't saying much. Harsh solvents, alcohol, and cooked fruit before a grassy and vegetal finish, and if that isn't enough, there's some rubber in the middle. Light in body with a medium-high level of carbonation, the awful finish just reemphasizes the trainwreck that this beer is."
"D: The taste kills this beer for me along with the extremely high carbonation."
"From the 3 or 4 beers I have had from Short's, they seem like an amazing brewery and very innovative. This beer, however, was my least favorite, to date, from Short's."
"Beer is mostly tart, I don't know the point of this beer unfortunately. Its about 1 flavor and its not that strong a flavor. I guess there is some non-tart sourness in there as well, I just don't care enough to talk about it. Mouthfeel is OK, drinkability is boring. Overall, I'm just really bored."
"Interesting peach/bronze/reddish colored body and a large pink/white head. Sticks around like ocean foam. Smell is somewhat bizarre. Kind of funky tart and sweet. I can't quite put my finger on it. It almost smells like spoiled fruit and industrial chemicals. I don't think I care for it too much, yet, it doesn't absolutely suck either. The taste is mouth-puckering tart and sour, fruity, and my burps taste like a bouquet of flowers. A bitter blanket coats my tounge. Texture and carbonation and mouthfeel are decent but I really do not want another one of these beers. The aftertaste is killing me. It tastes like I just drank some perfume."
"Drinkability - For a fruit beer, extremely so. I honestly think on a hot summer day I could session these...and at 7+ ABV...(which is hidden quite well) you would be having a good time after a couple. I really wish I had waited to have this when my fiancée was home because she would probably really enjoy this, and she normally hates beer. If I ever come across a six pack of this when back home I will be sure to pick one up for the hell of it because it is definitely something I would try again when in the mood for something light but potent."
"Easily drinkable, I could certainly go for more, good balance of flavors overall but could use just a little hop presence."
"Taste reveals more of a blend of the fruit with malts/grains than expected from the all-fruit smell. The sweetness of the berries is very juicy and slightly tart, and it is tempered by a bit of dry, crispy graininess from the rye. The alcohol is present, but I'd describe it as more smooth than hot. The feel is very lightly carbonated, almost a little on the flat side, and juicy and refreshing. Highly drinkable."
"D: Drinks pretty easy and doesn't seem like 7+%."
"(D)- This beer started out well, but fell short in just how over-the-top the yeast & carbonation are. Other than that, I enjoyed it for what it is."
"The (unfiltered?) ale poured to a light pink haze. 2-inch pinkish head formed, but settled rapidly. Belgian lace did not form. Nice berry nose and palate with some bitter and green-leaf edges. Medium-light body with attenuated lingering. Hints of sweetness balanced against the bitter notes.The fruit notes are most evident and intriguing when served at cellar temperatures rather than refrigerated. Although promoted as ""brewed special for those ladies who enjoy their wine"" that is far too limiting. This brew is appropriate for both genders, wine-drinker or not."
"D: For me the beer is too sweet, not to say that someone may like it, just not me."
"Decent enough. Not a big fruit beer lover but this seemed well done."
"The carbonation is pleasantly sharp in the mouth but it does leave a little bit of stickiness behind. While it's not very high in alcohol nor does it feel heavy, it's still more of a sipping beer for me. It's probably nice for a summer's day and I enjoyed having it, but it's nothing I need to have too often, if ever again."
"Overall, a very good take on fruit beer. Not my favorite style but a solid and interesting offering by Shorts."
"D - Meh. Fruit beers are not my favorite to begin with, and this did nothing to change my mind on that account."
"Pretty good beer overall and one I could see a lot of non-beer lovers really liking. I could use a little more tartness to add a some more depth to the sweetness, but not bad at all for a non-sour fruit beer."
"Flavor...just like I thought it would. Very sweet and fruity. Honestly, it tastes like a wine cooler, just like it smelled. Reminds me of a ""dirty-hoe""(Framboise Lambic with Hoegarden). A little carbonated, but overall very easy to drink. Overall, I'm surprised this is considered a beer. But tasty."
"Overall, I was expecting a little more from this beer. A high abv fruit beer sounded like a winner, but it was just a mess once I tasted it. Too much going on that the flavors mix together in a way that I didn't prefer. For the abv, it is pretty easy to drink, however."
"Refreshing and goes down easy once you can get past the really strange smell."
"It's a very refreshing beer but the taste doesn't have the fruit presence that I was expecting from the nose."
"Pours pink. Not red, pink. Like similar to white zinfandel. Almost no head at alla dn it dissapears right away. Smell is yeast and strawberries, and is more than slightly unpleasant. The taste is heavily of strawberries with a sour aftertaste. The smell make stasting rough and I'm trying to decide if I want to finish the beer or drain pour it and go on to something better. The only other similar beers I've had are founders cerise, New Glarus Belgian Red and Rasberry Tart. This is definitely not any of those."
"M/D - Mouthfeel isn't bad, about spot on for a fruit beer but it had average drinkability for as sweet of a style."
"Drinkability: Normally I don't go for the fruity beers. The ones that I've had usually taste artificial and overly sweet to me. This brew is very refreshingly sweet, but not over done. This one is surprisingly good. Thanks Kevin!"
"My least favorite Shorts offering so far."
"Bottle opened with a loud release of CO2-scares me immediately of infection. Fair amount of foam and it takes 3 pours to finally get it in the glass. Huge head a top a fairly standard copper color beer. Nice and bright fruit aroma-long lingering berry aroma. A blend of fruit flavor pretty much dominates. Slight lactic tang. Sweetness is a bit subdued considering the fruit flavor. Finish is rather dry. Ok enough body. Not overly impressed in general. An ok beer. Maybe fresher would be better."
"Pretty decent brew, but I can't imagine folks would want this on a regular basis. A novelty, a flashback to the '80's & B&J, but not something to reach for more than once in a blue moon."
"D Good drinkability for a beer with such a high ABV. 4.0"
"Fairly drinkable, but the astringent kind of kills the desire for much more. I'd like to try the Imperial series version. Meh."
"It's hard for me to hate on a Short's brew, but this beer just wasn't good to me."
"Very carbonated up front, way too much so possibly from slight oxidization. There is still some kind of funky earthiness that I can't put my finger on. There is a decent amount of rye in there balancing out the natural sweetness of the fruit. Again raspberries are prominent with a hood bit of blackberry, blueberry and faint strawberry. Again, it's nice that it tastes like fruit not fruit flavor. The alcohol is very well masked but I still didn't find it too drinkable. This is an interesting brew but I'm not the biggest fan of raspberries so I probably wouldn't seek it out again. Interesting and worth trying but I wouldn't put too much effort in seeking it out."
"I admire the craft behind this, and I'm a lover in tart fruit beers, but this may be too much."
"drinkability: one is enough i think"
"D - Not bad for the ABV."
"Mouthfeel is normal for the style. Drinkability is high mainly because I keep reaching for the glass hoping that each passing moment opens up the flavor more. But it never happens. As it stands, this is a nice beer but far too light for 7.2% abv."
"Another winner from Joe and the crew at Shorts. I just wish I wasn't so far away from the brewery. I wouldn't mind Soft Parade being a little sweeter, but then again I have a notorious sweet tooth. My friend who I was drinking Soft Parade with mentioned the liked it because it wasn't too sweet, so obviously it's a personal preference. Either way it's one hell of a tasty beer."
"D: This is a good fruit beer. Goes down incredibly easily for 7% alcohol. Would definitely buy again if i needed a change of pace."
"drinkability --- eh. a sampler is sufficient."
"Overall, a really good fruit rye ale from an even more outstanding brewery. I've yet to drink something from Short's I haven't enjoyed!"
"very drinkable, but very fruity maybe too much"
"A pretty interesting fruit beer... definitely worth trying."
"D- For the ABV and style, this is rather enjoyable."
"Overall, a little girly, but a great choice if you're in the mood for a fruity beer."
"D: Didn't know what to expect going into this one. We were quite surprised by its' fresh berry characteristics and its' ease of drinkability. Excellent summer beer!"
"Astringent tartness, raspberry, medicinal bitterness in the back with a malty aftertaste. Fruit is indistinct and muddled save for the raspberry. It's like trying to identify the specific fruit in hawaiian punch. Well carbonated with a nice amount of body. The abv is certainly hidden. Not a bad choice for a summer sipper!"
"Rose amber body. Clear. Small, pinkish-white head. Some lacing up the side. Nose is full of fresh berries. Blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry, to name a few! Sugary fruit malt as well. Toasted malt notes up front. Slightly tart, slightly sweet berry flavors follow. Definite strawberry and raspberry presence. Good balance of tart and sweet. Wheaty malt backing, with some grainy astringency. Lingering tart fruit in the finish. Medium-bodied with a lively feel. Not bad, but for the slight grainy astringency. Drinks like a 4% abv brew!"
"A nice dark red color body , with a light pink head , spotty lacing ,medium carbonation . Aroma is of a fresh berry mixture and a nice rye malt backbone ,light alcohol. Flavor is very muted when cold , but letting it sit a while brings out the nice berry flavors very fruity with just enough malt to balance things out , not too sweet or tart like other fruit beers . LIght body with a somewhat thin mouthfeel . NIce fruity finish , with the alcohol being well hidden , somewhat wine like . Very drinkable and hit the spot on a hot humid day ."
"Overall, not my favorite beer. I probably wouldn't buy it again, but I am not a huge fan of fruit beers either."
"Drinkability: For a Fruit/Vegetable beer, this is top-notch."
"Taste: Unsurprisingly, the berries are taking center stage. I can't discern the multiple berry flavors the way I could the smells. Finishes with a tart bitterness."
"Would love to see the brewers at Short's make a ""Sour Parade"" specialty batch with Brett or something else equally as funky!"
"D- one of the stranger beers ive had recently. i normally dont get into fruited beers, but this is among the best ive ever had. i dont think i could have more than one at a time though."
"Jordan."
"On tap at the brewpub, as opposed to the imperial soft parade I picked up a bottle of. Berry aroma. Reddish brown and lacey. Strawberry taste mainly. More subtle than bold but above average fruit beer. Carbonation appropriate but above average. Drinkable but not something I need to seek out."
"Drinkability is excellent. ABV's are hidden ridiculously well, very crisp and refreshing to drink. Very few brews at this abv will go down this smoothly. Remarkably enjoyable beer."
"Pours a clear reddish orange, fruit juice looking, medium sized white head forms, drops to a thick lace ring, some chunks stick to the glass, looks good. Smell is neat, fresh fruit salad, berries, strawberries, bit of brown sugar sweetness, biscuit, more berries, cherries, a bit earthy, very fresh smelling, pretty cool. Taste is similar, tons of fruit, very juicy, berries, some wheat and biscuit, strawberies, sugary fruit juice middle, mango, again pretty neat. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth. ABV is very hidden, and the fresh fruit character is great but don't think I would want a full pint of this one."
"drinkability is nice. pretty well balanced, but the above average carbonation and the sweetness slow you down a bit. still, a nice complex fruit character that i'm enjoying."
"D - Mmmm... I sure am glad we're getting two more bottles of this when Deuane returns from his trip to MI. This is a unique and outstanding beer from Short's, and I can't wait to have more! Thanks to the wife for sharing this with me!"
"Strong carbonation that makes the beer light and refreshing. Drinkability, if you like sweet-ass fruits, is excellent of course. If I was in a fruity mood, I'd throw down several easily. I had this before my dinner and it made a very nice appetizer course."
"Very interesting imperial style fruit beer from Short's. Lots of fresh berry flavors going on in this and the rye character added a different layer of complexity to it. Plus it definitely earned it's name with that mouthfeel, remaining soft and easy despite the alcohol presence in this. Well done!"
"D-Without question, a most impressive complex fruit combination. A very interesting and flavourful brew!"
"Pours a ruby color with a small head that quickly disappears. Huge smell of strawberry and other fruit flavors. The taste is not as sweet as I expected and is very different from the smell. Tastes of rye with a fruity sweetness and finishes dry. The mouthfeel has medium body and has decent carbination. Drinkability is good and is hindered only by its high abv. The board at the brewery said 8.0%. Overall a solid choice from Short's for those who enjoy fruit beers."
"D - I was really impressed by this one. The fruit tasted fresh and did not hide the fact that this was beer. The only fruit that I did not notice that was used in this beer was the blueberry, which to me says a lot about the expressiveness of the fruit in this beer. The use of rye not only helped balence the beer, but also added a nice level of complexity not always found in fruit beers. A great extreme beer in every possible sense of the word."
"Wow, no one could convince me that this was 9% ABV this is just hidden so well and its one of the best fruit beers I have ever had not to mention being extremely interesting. Thanks again Brendan!"
"Another great shorts beer!"
"I had this on tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor. I was happy to see a Short's beer on tap but was not prepared for it to be a fruit beer... The beer was slightly hazed, reddish orange colored with a laceable head. The aroma was very berry, I couldn't tell which berry varieties but I would guess raspberry. There was a pleasant aftertaste, a little yeasty as well as sweet and berryish. Easy drinking if not a little too sweet. Not my cup of tea as it were, but not a bad accomplishment either."
"This is probably a good beer to share with ladies who prefer fruity beers but find lambics too fruity."
"The color of this beer (a dark pink color) initially scared me thinking that it would be an over the top fruity beer. In reality it was surprisingly balanced on the fruit. There was not an overly sweet taste but rather a dry finish a little like champagne. I could not pick out the specific fruit although I know it has Strawberries, Blackberries, Blueberries, and Raspberries. It is a kicker at 7-8% (they have an imperial at 10%+) hence the nickname ""Ye Olde Leg Spreader"". It was not one that I would drink too much off, although it is good it is very powerful and I like too many of the other beers to pass out that quickly."
"Sampled on draught @ Shorts Brewing Company in Bellaire, Michigan. Unique cloudy magenta color with a very lightish pink head. One dimensional, non-vibrant berry aroma. Thin texture with a medium body. Extremely well hidden alcohol, with a non cloying fruit medley flavor and not much else. One dimensional, not enjoyable."
"Fruit syrup sweetness. Torani only wishes their shit was this potent and accurate in its fruit flavor. Well, almost. Surprisingly, this isn't really cloying or sickly sweet -- balanced by a dry acidity in the finish. 11%? Fruit barleywine? This damn drinkable? Methinks so."
