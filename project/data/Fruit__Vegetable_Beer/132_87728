The scent carried Hershey like chocolate and banana bread....not getting much peanut butter. The taste was mostly weak chocolate. The mouthfeel was light in body (which for this beer style I would prefer a medium to fuller body) with smooth carbonation. Overall its interesting...and not over the top.","WoodBrew","Jul 24, 2014"

Color was a solid dark-brown (SRM = 44), although they identified it as 75 Lovibond. I have a handle on SRM, so I am not going to try to learn Lovibond unless I have to. Nose definitely gave off banana esters, but accompanied by a maple syrup and an odd fried-doughnut quality. I was now gearing up for unrelenting sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was sweet, all right, but chocolate and banana were about it. Finish was likewise sweet and the peanut butter made a brief appearance at the end, but it might as well have had an asterisk next to it on the label for as much as it mattered. A definite novelty.","woodychandler","Jul 17, 2014"

2.88,3.2,3.5,3,2.75,3,2.75,"i appreciate the innovation and the idea, and the other two of these have been downright delicious and well done, but this one is a bit of a miss. some age on the bottle, so maybe my banana has faded, but i didnt taste it at all. worse, i didnt get any peanut butter, maybe a slight generic nuttiness, but nothing but a greasy texture and some sweet malt on this for me. chocolate yes, its all in the nose and finish, but the sweet grain makes it tough to appreciate all the way. i get no banana whatsoever, not even from the yeast, which may have been the best way to get those esters in here. worse yet, its alcoholic and not even that strong, it stings and it stinks, i just dont care for it. as it finishes i get a little more of the peanut butter, but its not really compatible like it is in other beers that have come around. its contrived, not real genuine, and just a sloppy mess of flavors that never gel. it may have been better when it first came out, but its well past being reasonable. i will likely keep buying these beers, only out of curiosity, but this is the worst of the three by far.","StonedTrippin","Jun 24, 2014"

Not a strong smell so I take another whiff and the first thought is that the smell is off putting. A big turn off. Smell is very artificial. Taste has no sweetness at all. I can't detect any banana, peanut butter or chocolate. Then I look at the label and it says ""donut"". Then I try to imagine this beer as a donut. Starts to make a little sense but I can't get over the off putting/ artificial smell. The smell is very familiar similar to a Wells beer. The only thing going for this is the cool pink painted bottle. This beer is not worth the $10 I paid.","Richardbeerlover","Apr 06, 2014"

Mouthfeel was medium and more like a Stout than a Ale but since chocolate is in this I guess one should see that coming, low carbanation also sways to a Stout style. Overall the fact that I never got any peanutbutter in this was kind of a let down, really enjoyed the maple bacon offering and always wait for the flavors to come out as it warms...while as a whole this got better as it warmed but no peanutbutter ever surfaced.","Bear1964","Dec 03, 2013"

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like milk chocolate, peanut butter, roasted malt and some banana. It tastes like milk and bittersweet chocolate, banana, peanut butter, burnt/charred malt and a bit of caramel. I do think the chocolate flavor is stronger compared to the banana and peanut butter. It does lean more towards being a sweeter tasting brew than a bitter, roasty one. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. Overall I liked this, I wouldn't mind trying it again in the future. It's certainly a unique beer, and it's definitely worth trying if you've never had it before.","bluejacket74","Sep 19, 2013"

Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, banana, toffee, light peanut butter, toast, bread, and toasted earthiness. Ok aromas with interesting balance of malt, banana, and light peanut butter notes; smells pretty artificial, but has good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, toast, banana, toffee, bread, light peanut butter, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, banana, toast, light peanut butter, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a bit. Pretty solid balance and robustness of malt and extract flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid experimental flavored beer. Ok balance and robustness of malt and extract flavors; and smooth to drink. A fairly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

I'm aware this is a rather harsh review, but when a company puts so much effort into marketing a beer like this, and then with the rather exorbitant price tag associated with it, the consumer is in a position to be brutally honest after buying the ticket and taking the trip.

Interesting sweet aroma of milk chocolate, stone fruit juice, hints of peanut butter and bananas, quite estery. Flavor is mild chocolate, nuts, vanilla, hint of banana, finishes drier with toasted malt and light hop bitterness. Light bodied with decent carbonation. Like the last Voodoo, this was a beer that for the first time in my life, I really wanted a paper bag to make sure that no one saw me buying it. And like the last one, I approached with trepidation but still found it an interesting, if not great ale. This tastes like a decent chocolate ale that has been watered down and blended with a light lager. You can almost taste decent ingredients crying to assert themselves. Kudos to Rogue for trying to push the envelope, but I can't help but think that this could have been better with a more substantial (dark and toasted malt) body, to support the sweet flavors. I had a good time drinking this because Rogue pretty much shows you what you're going to get with the label and the flavors were fun and interesting if rather thin and attenuated. Still definitely a one and done. Will I be tempted by the next version of the pink bottle again? Sadly, probably yes.","LiquidAmber","Jun 23, 2013"

It's a porter with a unique banana sweetness and a touch of nuttiness.

Aromas of chocolate syrup, both rich and sugary, with subtle banana notes and a hint of peanut butter. The chocolate really takes over the nose. Banana flavors are almost candy-like, with a weak chocolate syrup character and only hints of peanut butter here and there. Very awkward on the palate, and the flavors overpower the watery thin body. The aftertaste is candy-sweet once again, and the cloying sweetness lingers through past the quick, watery finish.

The bubbles are creamy on the surface, but quite rocky beneath, leaving a sticky thick ring of lacing and lots of webs running down from that. The beer’s body is too dark to penetrate with the eye. On the nose, this beer smells like plastic banana chocolate. There are touches of chemical green apple in the nose as well. Really, this beer smells fake and chemically. The chocolate does lay a nice layer beneath the rest of the smells, and is thick and rich, but the other smells are really quite gross. On the tongue, this beer tastes watery with definite plastic notes. Sweet and bitter. The flavor begins as sweet chemicals, moving into a thick chocolate flavor briefly before washing into a watery taste that mixes bananas and chemical flavors in a slurry. A slight cocoa chocolate flavor brushes through the finish, but is not very long lasting. For part of this taste, the beer is pleasant, and then it gets really gross, and then it’s okay and then its gross again. This is certainly a weird beer, but overall I think it’s gross. It’s worth a try, but you should split this thing among a large group. In the mouth, this beer feels thin to medium in body with a light touch of dry roast. The beer leaves the mouth with a lot of astringent chemicals on the sides and back of the throat. Overall, this beer is weird, just like it promised to be. I really am not a fan of it, especially the chemical flavors that I get from it, but there are some strangely redeeming flavors present in this beer, and they make me keep sipping.

3.2,14.7,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, banana, and a slight nutty aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that sounds good but is not executed very well with a flavor that is very mild and muted.","UCLABrewN84","0"
