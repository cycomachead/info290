"best flavored Lager there is.."
""
""
""
"O: wouldnt seen it out again."
""
"Umm, no thank you.  Generally like fruit beers but did not find this one enjoyable.  Very light gold, almost no head, barely any lacing.  There is just an off smell with some strong blueberries in there.  Taste is similar, blueberries, but not much else other than something off.  Very light, not much substance.  Overall not a beer that I will revisit."
""
""
""
"Not a fan of blue berry beers"
""
"One of the slightly better blueberry beers."
""
""
""
"Too much berry flavor for me."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of sweet blueberries. Taste is crisp, malty, blueberries, not nearly as sweet as the smell would indicate. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is right, and it's light without needing to be heavier, but there's something a little slick in the middle, though it doesn't get carried away.  It's nice and soft with a good carbonation and light bite of crispness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad brew at all. It reminded me of Sam Adams Blackberry Witbier but not as sweet. It was was surprised a bit by the toasted notes and expected it to be a brighter more floral beer."

"this wasn't good.  had from keg but not sure if lines were dirty or what.  place I was at had 40+ taps on line and claimed to have solid cleaning process and schedule.  Don't think I would try another."
"Popping the top to this brew it has a smoky type smell for reasons unknown as it is a wheat beer with blueberry.  Pouring into my SAPP I get a brew with a bright golden color and a thin foamy white head.  On the taste this brew has a spicy smoky flavor more than a sweet blueberry taste.  Mouthfeel is good and the aftertaste is consistent with the upfront flavor.  Nothing too spectacular here.  Won't seek this one out but would drink it if offered one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich blueberry aroma, though lacking flavor"
"Deep golden hue filtered blueberry ale, not a fan of synthetic fruit beer this is one of those generic golden ales with fake blueberry flavor in the finish.  Light speckled head leaves a fine trail of lacing.  Aroma has that fruity pebbles blueberry manufactured food additive nose.  Flavor is slightly tart with blueberry/citrus notes and even earthy dry grains.  Mouthfeel is light bodied meant to be consumed in the warm weather, this beer has probably found it's audience already, sorry I can't do this regularly."
""
""
""
"My guilty pleasure beer...  Blueberries are my favorite fruit so this is my go-to beer when I'm hungover, drinking early in the morning for some reason, or need to switch from high ABV beers to something more sessionable."

"I thought the beer managed to strike a nice balance of fruit and beer taste. I can see grabbing a couple more of these in the heat of next summer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is not my favorite fruit beer.  I know more malty taste could possibly mask the blueberry taste that they want to shine through but this beer needs a little more to it.  I dont mind an American Adjunct Lager every now and again but this one is only slightly better than that."

"Very light almost honey colored with hints of a cereal or toasted grain with a nice upfront blueberry aroma. After poured the head diminishes quickly to about a half finger width. Also very light on the hoppy side. Has a real light feel to the mouth and its very smooth. If fruit beer is for you this one is worth a try"

"Overall I would not hesitate to get this one again, I think there are a lot of closet Blue drinkers in the ATL"
""
""
""
"Pretty tasty, not six pack beer. Prolly one or two glasses, and you'll wanna switch to something else, but a lot less thick and consuming then blueberry beers out there. The blueberry flavor is just right . I really enjoyed this coming from a brew company that does more IPA then anything else"

"This was a decent beer, it has a blue berry taste to it which is really good. The taste is not too strong or too weak. The smell is a really good smell as well. You can taste the blue berry in it as well, and I like that. If you have not had this beer before and you like the taste of fruit in your beer than you need to try this one."

"O: It is what it is. It's a dead simple yet refreshing fruit beer that's panacea during 100 degree weather. I like how it isn't as cloying as certain fruit beers, also. Not great, but it'll still find a place in my fridge during the summer months."
"Flavor: a very mild hop bitterness lingers at the end. Other than that there is some sweet bready malt flavors and a grassy wheat taste. If you like blueberries, you will enjoy this beer. It truly has blueberry flavor without being cloyingly sweet."
""
""
"O - This would be a good summertime poolside beer. I wouldnt want to drink it all the time but its a nice change every once in a while"
""

"Nice and crisp. Blueberry isn't wicked overwhelming and has just the right bit of tartness to be intriguing outside of the blueberry taste. Smell is somewhat missing, as there's just a hint of aroma of blueberry on the nose in front of a nearly nonexistent, faint, no - strike that; there is no other smell. Appearance is. Pretty pedestrian as well, with virtually no lacing or head sitting on a mundane gold liquid with a few overachieving bubbles trying to escape. But, for what it is from a style standpoint, it is pretty good and could serve well as a BMC alternative at summer parties."
""
""
""
"Better than most fruit beers, in that it still tastes like a decent brew. Good aroma."
""

"Poured a clear and effervescent medium gold with a fizzy white head. The head has minimal retention but does leave a modicum of lacing. There is a pronounced blueberry aroma with a slight hint of the wheat beer base. The taste follows closely with distinct blueberry notes and mild wheat beer characteristics. On the plus side, the blueberries aren't overwhelming or cloying. There is a slight carbonation feel but it doesn't go too far towards fizzy. Not a bad beer and if you like fruit-based flavors in your beer this might be right up your alley. I was hoping for more wheat beer flavors than this provided."

"Overall: Eh, I used to like fruit beers back in the day, this one isn't great but not terrible. Not something I'd drink too often but worth a try if you like fruit beers."
""
""
"O: recommended"

"I'm one to score fruit beers relatively high as I tend to enjoy them but this simply fell short in most categories."
""
""
""
"This isn't terrible but it's pretty average. Tastes like a lager with some blueberry thrown in."
""
""
""
"O - It is not a great blueberry beer. The base beer taste is too prominent and bland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. It is refreshing but a bit too soapy."
"Purchased a 12 oz bottle at a Publix in Macon, GA. Sure can taste the blueberries, but it's just too sweet in the wrong way. It's not a complex sweet that you might get from a lambic or even from other fruit beers. It's just sugar. In my extremely limited experience, SweetWater beers seem to be sweeter than is standard for the style (e.g., the 420)--it must be the name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pleasant easy to drink beer that I wouldn't turn down if offered, but I doubt I'd choose it over legions of other offerings."

"This pours a clear, light amber color with a slight, off-white head. The aroma is very grassy and grainy. The taste is fairly decent for its style as it’s light in body and flavor. It’s perhaps a little thinner than I would like, but than again it is made for a warmer climate than where I am from. Hints of grass and grains in the flavor. Finishes pretty clean with just the slightest hint of blueberries."
""
""
""
""
"O: Would probably be better enjoyed on a hot summer afternoon while out in the sun but it is definitely an enjoyable blueberry beer with very little artificial flavors or aroma. This is easy to drink and could easily be sessionable. Pretty refreshing."

"O - Overall, not a bad blueberry beer. Actually grew on me as I drank it. Quite enjoyable and would be excellent on a summer day."

""
""
""
""
"Yes."
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
"O- Not a great beer, all things considered, but I prefer it to Sea Dog Blue since the blueberry flavor doesn't overpower. Better on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not offensive, but berry flavor doesn't taste natural at all. I won't be having another."
""
""
""
"O= This is a great beer I think. A fruit beer is a fruit beer. Yeah it tastes a little artificial but it's not overly sweet and candy like. The wheat comes through in the flavor and it's freaking blueberry! This is worth drinking again and again in the summer."
""

""
""
""

""

"This is a simple and refreshing fruit beer that would make a good gateway beer for someone new to craft brews."
"Wow, this is undrinkable. Really, really terrible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good summer fruit beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is what I expected. A Blueberry ale that is mostly blueberry and not particularly interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is truly a good beer if you are one for blueberries. I have known a fair number of friends who have enjoyed this brew, but personally I cannot get behind drinking such a rich and blueberry-infused brew. For anyone who loves the fruit, this is one to be sought after."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a big fan of fruit beers, but this beer hits the spot. It's a great tasting, refreshing session beer that's perfect on a hot day. I can tell that I'll be craving this beer bad from time to time."
"This beer pours a very light bodied pale gold in color with a one finger white head. The nose is light and features light blueberry muffin and has a light cereal, wheat aspect. It's subtle. The flavors too are light and approachable. There is a moderate amount of blueberry muffin followed by pale malt and a yeastiness that leads into the aftertaste. It's ok. It's somewhat artificial. I can see this as being extremely female friendly. It is very light and overly drinkable. If you're looking for an outside or pool beer with a light fruity punch this could be your beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - After trying a handful of blueberry themed beers over the years, I've decided that it's a flavor that's hard to incorporate into a beer without it seeming artificial. However, this particular offering is actually one of the better ones I've had, if not the best. Oddly, the blueberry character seems artificial at times, but very close to blueberry pie in subsequent tastes. This certainly qualifies as a refreshing and crisp beer, and while I might not have been completely won over by the flavor, I would have no problem drinking a few of these in succession."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: certainly drinkable and refreshing. Not a fan of the genre especially when all that is represented is the fruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While I am not really a fan of fruit beers and this one is no different, I must say it goes down like water and would be wonderful on a hot day."
""
""
"While light on character, blue is thirst quenching and would make a fine session beer during a ball game."
""
""
""
"If I could rank it on a 0-100 scale I would rank this a 90, whether my actual rating equates to that or not."
""
""
""
""
"For a fruity beer, it has a tiny bit of bitter after taste, but not so much that I can't enjoy it. Other than that, I really like this beer and have actually drank it on multiple occasions when there was nothing else on the menu that was on the fruity side (except for Blue Moon, which I now find boring). It has a mild blueberry flavor but the blueberry aroma is lacking. Overall, I like it and will drink it if I have limited choices."

"This is much better than I thought it would be and better than the other fruit beer I have had (#9). Ultimately this beer is a bit too sweet and could use a hint of hops to help the finish and make it taste more like a beer. The taste is most akin to a blueberry cobbler, definitely not fresh blueberries."
""
""
"O - While this is otherwise a standard filtered wheat, as I mentioned several times above, the addition of the hint of blueberries makes this Pacific Northwesterner miss the fresh berries found on high mountain hillsides. It's clean, strange, and smooth, making this otherwise average concoction just slightly above the norm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:	It was alright. I thought that it was great for the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Hearing it was a brew with blueberries within, thought it would be refreshing and worth it. It was, just nothing I would drink back to back. Enjoyed once and will check it off my list. Wouldn't go out of my way for it and like I said, MANY more brews from SweetWater that will keep your standards high!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Try this if you are looking for a good desert beer that won't send your palette into confusion."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My overall impression of this beer is really just a macro lager soaked in blueberries. It's not *bad*, it's just very unimpressive. Try it if you don't have any better choices, but certainly don't run to the beer store in any hurry to get this."

"sturdy drinkable beer with a nice blueberry twist... I personally like blueberry so it was great! good carbonation but very light feel and the bitterness kind of overpowered the flavor for me... id drink it but probably wouldn't ask for it... good if your lookin for something a little different. drank from the bottle so no coments on visuals..."
"This is an easily drinkable beer, but the flavors are faint and mellow. There's nothing very spectacular here."
"Taste is mild, but balanced. Nice mix of wheat and blueberry. Definitely a light body here, so this is an easy drinker. Solid, but not outstanding. I could drink more of these, no problem."
"Grain comes out much more in the flavor and even flashes some grassy hop. Blueberry is prominent, but not overwhelming and does not really take the sweet route. What does that all add up to? Unfortunately, a decent but not excellent, fruit beer that is quaffable but forgettable. All the components fight each other and the hop aspect rarely seems to work well in a fruit beer. Im a sucker for a good fruit beer, but Im not sure how soon Id want to roll with this one again."
"Well, this ale is not what I look for in a fruit hybrid, but!!! They description on the bottle does not really lie. It is described as light. I just think the blueberry flavor should have been more dominate."
"O: It's one of Sweetwater's mainstays, and I can see why. On a hot afternoon, this would go down easy and the ABV would keep it an enjoyable experience. The blueberries shine in this beer better than most, which is surprising considering the fact that this is a relatively light beer. Very good job, Sweetwater. Will definitely make an appearance at my 4th of July party."
"Overall- I really enjoyed this beer especially since I am not a huge fan of this style. Very happy will purchase again. Cheers!"
"O- this is a really great beer, and I understand why so many in the south love it. I want more!"
"Overall Drinkability - Single worst fruit beer I've ever had."
"A pleasant enough, but very average beer."
"Overall: Pretty good beer--a little too fruity for my taste, but I can still appreciate the beer."
"Big blueberry smell. A little in the taste. It's a light golden color with a little head. Not much retention. It's one of those summer beers that I sometimes just need to grab when it gets a little warm out. Overall, it's hard to really get down on this beer. It is what it says it is. It's pretty well done and doesn't have the too much of a sweet syrupy taste to it."
"The best thing about the beer is the aroma. It is intensely blueberry. The beer poured a strawberry blond color. A small white head dissipated rapidly. It had a decent lager taste, but with very little carbonation and almost no hop profile. If you can say it has a blueberry taste, it would be the sort of tanic aftertaste. It is not unpleasant. Not a bad beer. Fun to drink because of the aroma."
"Poured this one into a pint glass little to no head but tons of carbonation. Has a clear yellowish/gold color. Smells of strong blueberry flavor and it is a bit artificial. As you drink this one the front is a sweet flavor but not overwhelming and as it moves to the back the blueberry comes through. I like this one not overly amazed by it. Would buy it again but mainly to support local brewers."
"On tap at the Filling Station here in G-boro.Poured a very light slightly hazed golden with a 1/2 finger white head atop.Aromas are mainly toasty cereal grains with a light smattering of blueberry.Toasted flavors and very light sweetness,the bluberry is light and in the finish.Well I gues if you are lookin for a no brainer with a hint of fruit this would be for you,not me."
"M - Light bodied and personally I like the low carbonation."
"o: not impressed by my second sweetwater beer. They did a great job with the blueberry flavor and they taste nice and refreshing, but the beer is just too water and thin. There is no wheat presence in this and I would prefer several blueberry beers over this. No need to get it again, but glad I tried."
"Pours with a nice 3 finger head which dissipates quickly. Light carbonation. Looks like pale green tea. Smells strongly like blueberries! Tastes light and refreshing...a little watery to me, but I am not very familiar with this style. If you like blueberries and this style, I would say it is worth trying. A nice change of pace, and very pleasant after mowing the yard!"
"Overall - won't buy this beer. Too sweet with strong fruity aftertaste."
"This brew was the first beer after Abita Purple haze that I have tried with any fruit resemblance to it. I loved the smell wow you could open this brew 15ft from me and I would either believe I was at IHOP or you just opened a Sweetwater Blue. Smooth very smooth clean crisp blueberry taste brilliant finish that leaves both beer and blueberry. The alcohol is there but not at all powerful. If you are tired of your girlfriend drinking to many fru fru drinks that cost an arm and a leg buy here one of these and your gold."
"Not the best beer I've ever had, but it works."
"Overall: not really a fan of fruity beers like this one so this didn't really do it for me. I guess I should've known that something called Blue would've been blueberry in nature. I could see this being a decent crossover beer but nothing extraordinary. Cheers."
"Overall this fruit beer was average at best. The blueberrys were there but were much more muted then they were in the aroma while still keeping all the sweetness, which was just too much for how light and thin this beer was. This beer may hit the spot on a hot summer day when you want something light and easy drinking but the flavor wouldn't keep my attention. I am glad I gave it a second try but I wouldn't buy it again. There are many other better and more flavorful fruit beers out there for the price. I hope the other Sweetwater beers I have are better then this one."
"Appearance was a very light gold; the white head was respectably sized but faded quickly. The smell was blueberry (duh). Pretty pleasant scent, and quite distinct. This got my hopes up for a good taste experience. Big letdown. To me, it tasted like seltzer water with a slight blueberry flavor - thus the mouthfeel was downright watery. The blueberry taste was not a strong as the scent. Not a beer I'd pick up again."
"D - Not a wow beer, but very drinkable, as it is a nice light beer for a warm summer day. I like it because its different. I haven't seen any other blueberry wheat ale's out there."
"O - A ""Craft Beer"" version of Wild Blue. This is an embarrassment to Sweetwaters otherwise decent lineup, they should get rid of this beer."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I do enjoy blueberries, and that is really the point of this beer. It's not complex by any means, but nice on a summer's day."
"Good for one, but i would never drink a 6 pack."
"Having mostly positive experiences with Sweetwater brews, with their IPA among my top three IPAs, I had high expectations. Appearance is crisp and clear with an orange hue, controlled head. The aroma is the highlight of this beer. Fun and fruity with a bit of pine underneath. The taste is refreshing, but would not be first choice for my wheat beer fix on a hot day. Very drinkable and goes down easy. A novelty beer that makes for a great conversation piece, but it won't be one of my reliable standbys."
"Easy drinking but not that great. Not much going on here; tastes like a light beer with blueberry"
"O: As far as fruit beers go this is really good. Nice is the summer as it is tasty, light and easy to drink. One of the best blueberry fruit beers out there."
"I am not a big fan of fruit beers and in particular blueberry beer. Even so, this was a very sub-par beer. tasted overwhelmingly of blueberry( surprise surprise) . This being my first beer from Sweetwater, it did not bod well and I hope that their other beers are better. I don't like to judge an entire brewery based on a bad beer, or a good one for that matter. I also got a few of their other ones and expect better things. More reviews to follow."
"I won't be trying this beer again, but have enjoyed several of Sweetwaters beers, and would advise anyone to pick a sweetwater product up when possible!"
"D: Gets high marks here. I think I found my new lake brew."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer. I like how the blueberry is showcased. That said, it isn't a flavor that I could enjoy very often. For what it is, it is good...so you may want to give it a shot if you are in Atlanta."
"This brew is crisply carbonated and very light bodied. The drinkability is this beer's strong point, the blueberries just narrowly avoid being cloying. Not the best fruit beer I've had, but it was still pretty good. Would be a reliable choice if we got this on a regular basis in Tampa."
"D: Everyone I know hates this beer and maybe I have a bit of nostalgia because my wife and I have fond memories of our vacation where this brew was always around. I even looked for big flaws but couldn't find them."
"D: I though this beer was going to be dominated by the blueberries and be overly sweet. I was happily wrong. This beer was much more balanced than I thought it was going to be and actually quite good."
"Got the big 22oz mug of this brew. Not a very big head, about a finger. Some broken lace, but good cling. Looks to be about a 6 on the SRM chart, but I don't have the chart with me, so I may be wrong. Smell of blueberries, raspberries, some honey, and wheat. Taste is overwhelmingly blueberries, with a touch of raspberry, and malt. Just sort of sickening sweet, lacking any tang, and crispness. Some body and creaminess in my mouth. Just to sweet and fruity for my palate."
"my neighbor turned me on to sweet water blue. I really like fruit beers and I really love blueberries. Can you say somebody spilt their chocolate on my peanutbutter? But seriously, this is a great beer. The color is a light gold with a touch of haze. The smell is of blueberries. The flavor is more fruit than beer, which isn't bad. I like the drinkability with the finish of blueberries. I think the combo is executed well. I will be drinking more of this."
"Taste is basically what you would expect if you were to make a beer from blueberry muffins. It is a fairly light and far from cloying taste, but it dominates what is a pretty monotonous flavor profile. Very easy drinking, smooth beer. Kudos for making it not very sweet and over the top, but it isn't all that interesting."
"Pours a clear yellow... a bit of white head. Not ugly but not great. Smells strongly of blueberry... a very potent scent. Tastes... weird. Too much blueberry for me. It overpowers everything and really makes it not a good beer. The mouthfeel is ok but its fairly drinkable. Overall, not something I would drink again"
"D. Eh. I wouldn't pick it up again."
"D-nicely drinkable. Again, very suprising but wouldnt drink it very much..."
"D - if it was all the smell it'd be great. But it's just not that good.I"
"Also just noticed that the bottle I drank had a best if drank by date of December 20 2010 and it's currently January 26 2011. Looks like I'll be trying this one again later to give it a fair chance."
"I absolutely bloody love this beer."
"Verdict: This beer is easy enough for to drink for any casual drinker but isn't very bold on any level. Beyond some basic flavors there's not much else that draws this beer out above the others that are much like it. With that in mind, it's about on the same level as many other wheat and blueberry beers, but more subtle. Not half bad. B- (3.45)"
"D-Not a beer for me, to fruity in my eyes. Definitely a good beer if you like blueberries though."
"Goes down like water and I don't really mind this one at all. For what it is, not too bad."
"Overall I wasn't really impressed with this beer, average blueberry beer at best but i can see some non-beer lovers liking it."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours straw yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsides to a minimal amount slowly. Maintains decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, stale blueberry, and muffins. The flavor is of sweet malt, blueberry, and stale muffins. It has a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall not really sure about this one. I mean, I know what they were 'trying' to do, but seriously?!? Aroma is better than the flavor, but that's not saying that much... Could be a lot better, but could be a lot worse."
"D- If you like blueberries this is easy to drink. The fruit is subtle and the beer is watery. Light, refreshing, and weak."
"Pours a light amber color with a bit of a white head. The nose brings some strong blueberry characteristics. The taste is overly dominated by the blueberry, although there is some light bread underneath as well. The feel is pretty light with good carbonation and the blueberries are carried well. Drinks really quite well and is a nice, sessionable summer brew."
"This beer pours an unremarkable clear gold with no dissernable head. As with most fruity beers the aroma is great malty with a hint of blueberries. The taste is light, almost watery, with a hint of malt and faint blueberries. Good carbonation but an average fruit beer at best."
"D - decent blueberry, not too chemical tasting though unlike alot of other blueberry beers, i'd like to have again"
"D: watery, light, not much flavor, not my style at all"
"The Sweetwater Blue pours a hazy orange color with a fizzy white head that quickly fades and leaves no trace behind. Not much to the nose. Some subtle malts and bready aromas. Very hard to get any fruit smells from the aroma. Taste is quite watery with a very subtle fruity finish. Up front there are some malts and pines. Mouthfeel is very thin and quite watery. Drinkability is mediocre and this is solely due to the low ABV and not overpowering characteristics. The taste is ok just not much too it."
"D - Pretty easy to drin"
"I've always thought blueberry is a difficult choice for a fruit flavored beer because the flavor can so easily overwhelm all other beer aspects and you wind up with a blueberry candy malternative. Sweetwater does a really nice job of moderating the blueberry flavor - it is certainly pronounced but not overwhelming with a fresh fruit, quite natural blueberry flavor."
"D: I would definitely recommend this as a dessert beer or for a hot summer day. Although, the flavoring of fruit beers tends to wear thin for me after a few bottles."
"Overall, I don't really dig it. Its a good beer, but its just not my style."
"It is a really enjoyable beer. The appeance wasn't all that. It did not have much head and no lace on the glass as it goes down. The smell is interesting you can definetly smell the blueberries but you can still smell some of the hop. The taste is a lot better that what I expected I was suprised. The mouthfeel is there and finishes smooth and refreshing which makes for a wonderfuld drinkability. Good beer even though I am not much for a fruity beer. I did not read the label before I drank the beer so it was kind of a suprise."
"Lightish body, medium effervescence focused on tongue's tip. Bitter at the swallow mellowing quickly. Smoothish finish, good malty aftertaste with some blueberry note. Good overall but would like more of the blueberry to show up. Picky, huh?"
"M/D: light feel that lacked carbonation making it a little easier to drink and offers a refreshing experience."
"Well I got this from a beer trade from North Carolina. I was told this was one of the better SweetWater Beers. Well it wasn't half bad. Nothing that I am jumping on the phone with my mother saying I just had this amazing beer. Amazing it is not, drinkable yes. Very light ale, which smells wonderful, the taste is just ok, and the after taste is pretty pleasant. Blueberries are definitely in the beer, but not over powering like the Sea Dog version. Great beer for the summer time."
"All in all, not too bad, but I know there are better blueberry beers out there."
"D: Super drinkable. I would love to have these on a hot summer's day with the grill going (If I had a grill, that is)."
"Drinks well-definitely a good hot afternoon drinker, refreshing."
"M/D - Mouthfeel has a slightly artificial taste but very similar to other sweetwater beers. It's a reasonably drinakble fruit beer, but nothing I will seek out in the future."
"Drinkability: A solid fruit beer that I could see myself sessioning. The blueberries have a real not artificial taste. Nothing extraordinary, just a solid fruit beer."
"Overall I wasn't really impressed with this beer, average blueberry beer at best but i can see some non-beer lovers liking it."
"Drinkability: I just can't give it a decent score here as I just can't get into the flavor -- it's not like I'm even drinking a ""beer."""
"D-all concentrate and still tasted watered down...drain pour (my first in reviewing history)!"
"This is a too sweet to be sessionable. Reminds me a lot of a sweeter Blue Moon."
"Overall impression: Disappointing offering from a brewery I've enjoyed otherwise. Lacking in real fruit character."
"Notes: A good fruity beer, but nothing outstanding. This is a gateway beer for many of my non-craft drinking friends here in Atlanta. My girlfriend also happens to be a fan of this. Again, it isn't a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, so don't let anyone tell you it is. However, it is a very fruity beer, so just know what to expect."
"Pours a pale yellow with a white head and minimal lacing. The nose is loaded with blueberries - it's like sniffing a warm blueberry muffin. Very strong smell. Taste is, as expected, blueberries. It actually reminds me quite a bit of Fruity Pebbles. Blueberry sweetness. No bitterness to speak of. Light to medium bodied, mild carbonation."
"D- Certainly an interesting brew. I've had a handful of 'blueberry' beers and this one is easily the best. Not something that I would get often but worth trying."
"This is a great lawnmower beer, perfect for a hot Southern day. It's a great alternative for BMC drinkers in the South where there are lots of BMC drinkers, but it's rater unsatisfying on an early November evening. It is an easy to drink beer though & in spite of its foibles, I was ready for another when the first was finished."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. It's by far my favorite fruit beer that I've tried so far; it doesn't taste like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles. The fruit flavor is subtle and restrained, but still there. Another good beer from a solid brewery."
"Overall, an interesting beer and one that I'm glad I got the chance to try. I don't think I would ever buy this but I feel Sweetwater has much better offerings. Thanks Ben for the chance!"
"overall, as I previously aluded to - great if you need a sweet tooth fix -bad if you are looking for subtlety. this beer is uber-sweet and packed full of Blueberries. take it or leave it."
"drinkability is good. what a good fruit beer should be; very aromatic and not too sweet with a fresh character. not overdone, but just right. cheers!"
"Pop the cap and blueberries fill the room. Blueberries don't smell this good by themselves. Thin halo of a head, very light, lime type color. Moderate carbonation. So, expecting a lot of blueberry flavor from the aroma, you certainly get it when you turn it up. I have a hard time deciding whether I'd rather eat blueberries or drink this beer. I think I'll go for the beer. Blueberries when you pop the cap, blueberries in the nose, blueberries in the mouth, blueberry after taste and blueberry dreams."
"The taste is blah. Not much there and fairly one dimensional. Again, the malt sweetness is the primary taste. There is some trace amounts of blueberry, but nothing worth bragging about. This is an incredibly drinkable, and would drink this as a lawnmower beer if I had regular access to it."
"Aroma, of course, is blueberry. But light and nice. Same with the quaff - bits of malt backbone sturdy up the mix. Firm carbonation supplement the body. Easy drinking beer, nice to have had the chance to try one."
"D: Could drink many of these... great summer time beer, if you like something on the sweet side..."
"Balanced and easy-drinking, with a blueberry character that is complementary rather than dominating, which is just the way things should be. A nice beer for more novice drinkers, with no outlandish characteristics battering the palate or vying for dominance. Quite a nice fruit beer, but one that could do with more body."
"Light bodied with a fizzy feel and the drinkability is good."
"The beer has a light body, smooth and decent drinkability. Felt like it was a little over carbonated. Overall, less than average beer. I doubt that I would ever order this beer again."
"So, if there's any drawback or defect to this beer it's that the head simply doesn't last that long, and the lacing is limited. Otherwise it's quite nice."
"M/D: Light bodied, prickly (but not as much as you would imagine from the appearance). Mouthfeel is probably on par with what the brewers wanted. Drinkability is good if all you are looking for is something wet, but a this beer is very plain outside of that."
"Future outlook: For a low ABV beer that is past it's prime, this has held up remarkably well. I'd love to try it fresh, and am intrigued to try some other brews from Sweetwater if/when I get the chance."
"D= A pleasant surprise for sure. Though its sort of a one trick pony, and I wouldn't want more than 1 or 2 in a day, this is pretty solid for a fruit flavored wheat beer!"
"Poured a deep piss yellow color with a small white head. Nose is hops, malt and blueberrybut with a soapy, astringent smell. Taste is of light blueberry, astringent, soap and hops with a hint of blueberry but finishes with a grain/wheat style similar to a wheat beer."
"Very similar to the bottle version I've tasted in the past."
"D - For a fruit-focused brew, this is pretty good. Although the blueberries don't have any complex interplay with the malt or the hops, at least it doesn't taste like blueberry seltzer. One of the best ways I can describe this beer is as a better, more rounded, more focus, version of Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. Sure, it tastes like blueberries but for what it lacks in complexity at least the fruit flavor never becomes overwhelming. A decent refreshing brew for the right occasion."
"I could drink these all summer. I like it. Check it out..."
"M + D: A pleasant beer, with a lighter and rather crisp body. It's an easy drinker, and I could do a few of these without complaint, though it may be something I'd need to be in the mood for."
"Not bad. drinkable? yeah. refreshing? yeah. tastes like a liquid blueberry muffin? yeah. If i'm in the right mood, I could see this one really hitting the spot."
"If there's a beer to go with pancakes, this is it. I wonder if you can make pancakes with the help of this brew, hmmm? Very tasty."
"Drinkability: An exceptional session beer, and one I could easily drink a few of. It's mild enough to keep it sessionable, and while I would have liked to see a little more blueberry flavor, there's enough of it in there to keep it interesting. Solid beer."
"A enjoyed this. Very quaffable, with a nice blueberry taste that doesn't overdue it. I could kill a couple of these easily."
"Pours a clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slightly grassy, very nice blueberry notes. The taste is malty/grassy, with some nice blueberry notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew."
"drinkability: a great session beer with low taste. Bud drinkers would highly approve. Not a great Beer advocate beer though."
"This is an excellent lawnmower/gateway/summer/easy-drinking blueberry beer that doesn't taste fake, still tastes like beer and goes down wicked easy. What's wrong with that? If I enjoy it when it's 12 degrees outside this'll be fun to have during the summer."
"Poured about 4 of these things and could only generate the faintest of heads. The smell was pleasant, dominated by blueberries. The taste was oversweet, but the flavors were not unpleasant. Mouthfeel was unremarkable, perhaps a little thin with low carbonation. The sweetness really detracts from the drinkability for me, and I could not drink more than 1-2 at a time."
"D I had two of these in one sitting for lunch. I would have had more, had I been there longer."
"Certainly seems like an easy-drinking type of beer to introduce to someone who doesn't like beer. It's light, inoffensive and it has blueberries. Certainly can't go wrong with this on a hot summer day. Feels a bit odd to be drinking it in early winter in the northeast."
"Not too drinkable for me since the champane aspect is not attractive."
"Notes: It was really successful in being a blueberry beer but I am not a big fan of fruitty beers."
"D - A nice change of pace"
"poured a slightly hazey yellow with a nice head that diaspers to nothing quick, the sent of blueberrys gently hit my nose as i poured this one. the taste is light and fizzy, lots of blueberrys in the after taste but not as much as i had hoped. the begining flavor is caned corn and a hint of sour malt, the middle is ware the bluberrys start in thay are mild and unsweet, than the aftertaste is ware the sweetness of the berrys finaly comes through. i could see myself drinking a few of these in the summer but not an all year beer for me."
"D: I don't usually gravitate towards fruit beers, but Sweetwater is a good brewery. This is a solid and refreshing beer. Not something I'd drink all the time, but well done nonetheless."
"that would be the main positive id give this brew, you cant put it down it drinks so easily very sessionable. the fruit is not overpowering or anything its very good"
"Drinkability-it does go down easy"
"Good drinkability I think it maybe to sweet to drink many of these in a row. Its an ok brew not my favorite blueberry"
"Drinkability: A nice, even bodied ale with solid malt flavors. Just enough blueberry in the finish, without being overly sweet or cloying."
"This beer isn't so sweet that it couldn't be enjoyed more than one at a time."
"Poured a dark yellow/golden color with very little head that was gone very quickly. Aroma is dominated by the smell of blueberries. The flavor is a bit wheaty and the blueberry taste is extremely subtle. This is smooth, refreshing, and a good thirst quencher. Mouthfeel is pleasant. Not something I would drink a lot of, but a nice fruit beer."
"It tastes like blueberry candy. So if you like that taste, and think it would be a good idea to pair it with pale bready malts, this beer is made for you. I'm not a huge fan and find the transition from the fruit flavor to malt aftertaste to be rough and a touch astringent. On par with other good blueberry brews."
"D - Low ABV, slightly malty and thin makes this an easy drinker, but isn't for me."
"Tried this one years ago but this review corresponds to a sample on tap at the airport. Classy! Poured a gorgeous golden/straw hue but very little head and no retention. No lacing either. Aromas clearly of blueberries, bananas and wet straw. Flavors are sweet and fruity with the unmistakable blueberry character out front. A graininess in the malt gives this beer further tang. Wheat is subdued beneath the sugars. Perfect carbonation and a light body helps this beer be very sessionable and probably a great brew for the girls. Smooth but slightly zippy on the tongue. Some hops at the very end provide a clean finish. Good example of a fruit beer and one of the best blueberry beers I know of."
"This is a very well done fruit beer. The blueberry is infused very well. Definitely worth a shot if you're into fruit beers, and even if you're not it won't be a bad decision."
"This isn't the best fruit beer that I ever had, but it certainly would be refreshing on those oppressive Atlanta summer afternoons. Recommended."
"M/D - Light bodied, very crisp and well carbonated. An interesting fruit beer but a little too tart to be very drinkable."
"Easy drinking summer brew. I enjoyed this brew more than I had anticipated. One of the better fruit beers I've sampled."
"D: I wouldn't drink these all night, but I could definitely make a dent in that 6-pack. On a hot afternoon, this beer hits the spot."
"Drinkability is moderately low. Flavor is ok and alcohol is low so it's definitely easy enough to drink. However, after a while the flavor will overwhelm."
"D: This is a very drinkable fruit beer. Though some additional depth would much improve the taste, the light body and crisp, refreshing feel make it sessionable and enjoyable. A good hot-weather refresher, but not much else."
"D- This is a nice beer. I think it could be good summertime beer. I really can't say anything bad about the beer other than I prefer stouts. I would have another. I think that most people would enjoy one or two of these."
"pours up a uriney yellow. not much head. smell is blueberries. i think thats all i get. taste is sweet, blueberries, a very mild bite in the finish. possibly some slight acidics. light bodied, low carbo. easy summer brew but i probably wouldn't enjoy a fuller sixer of it."
"D: Great summer beer. Refreshing on a hot day while sitting on the porch after some yard work. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability - I could see this wearing me out after a few, but a nice change of pace beer."
"M: Very pleasant carbonation which enhances the drinkability - this is a fairly easy quaffer."
"Poured a nice light amber color, although with very little head and no lacing. Has a nice blueberry scent, with a little bit of malt undertones, although the real 'beer' scent is overpowered by the fruit. Nice taste, a very fruity ale, but again, the blueberry overpowers the ale. There is a nice berry aftertaste, with a hint of maltiness. Goes down fine. This is an excellent fruited ale, if you really want a berry taste as opposed to a berry enhanced ale."
"As I was in the airport in GA, I decided to stop in to the Sweetwater Brewhouse. During my trip to GA, I had tried their IPA and 420 and wanted to see if I could grab something new. I enjoy blueberry beers, but have only had them from Northern Breweries. This is a decent blueberry beer, honey colored, with very little blueberry scent (compared to other blueberry beers). The taste of blueberry seemed to be merely a hint. It was pleasant and drinkable - the only improvement I would add is to add blueberries to the beer. I know - fruit the beer, I said it, but it's true!"
"Thanks to Maria for picking this up for me in her travels."
"I can admit that as fruit beers go I like it, and would drink it again if it was free. But as far as beers from Sweetwater go it's my fourth or fifth choice, depending on if there's a seasonal available."
"Color is a typical golden yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is not strong, but good for an ale with a decided blueberry overtone. Blueberry flavor dominates the taste, which is otherwise average but tasty and refreshing. A smooth and delightful ale."
"D - Fruit beers aren't my first choice of beer but this one is very good for the style and I'd say its worth a try"
"Overall, this might be good on a hot summer day after cutting the grass. Aside from that, I can't say that I can recommend this beer."
"12 oz. bottle: This one pours a pretty clear, golden color. There was a small white head on it that didn't linger. The aroma is definitely blueberries, and not really anything else. Fortunately, they are not overpowering. The taste is pretty good. The blueberries are evident, but not overly done. There is a hint of dryness in the finish. Overall, decent and refreshing."
"D: I am torn by this brew. It is unremarkable, lacking character and features that would recommend it. It's selling point...blueberry flavors...are so recessive as to not be distinct enough to encourage a berry lover to order a second bottle. It has a nice creamy, tangy mouth feel but lacks a clean aftertaste. I would pass if offered it in the future."
"Light and crisp not as sweet and sugary as other blueberry beers I have tried. I would recomend it to anyone who has never had a good example of a blueberry beer. Sweetwater is a great regional brewery I have never had a bad beer from them if you see it give it a try"
"Served in a pint glass, looks a bit like a macro pilsner but slightly darker. Decent bright white head. Nose is intense sweetened blueberry juice and corn. Taste is mild blueberries, and thats about it. Very one dimensional. Mouthfeel is average, and drinkability is pretty high. Just not that interesting of a beer."
"Not a bad fruit beer but doesn't really do it for me."
"Overall, it is worth a try for sure...definitely an interesting beer"
"A grainy taste, however, doesn't mesh perfectly with the blueberries, but well enough to be quite drinkable. The two flavors seem to mesh increasingly less well as the brew warms up, so this might be one to keep ice cold."
"Poured into a SABL glass a slightly hazy pale gold with a decent off-white head. The aroma is of sweet fruit with slight blueberry and mild hops. The taste is an extract-like blueberry mixed with sweet malt dominating some very subdued citrus hops. The beer is rather crisp and very light with a normal level of carbonation. This is certainly a crisp refreshing beer, but the fruit flavor of it could stand to be a little fresher."
"Tried this one at the brewery's Friday afternoon happy hour while visiting Atlanta (a great time, I highly recomended stopping by if you are in the ATL). Looks fairly non-distinct, just kind of a thin, golden color with little bit of white head that quickly dissapeared. Smell packed a punch: blueberries and wheat. I could catch a whiff of it from 2 feet away. The taste, however, was much somewhat muted. It was malty and fruity, but not as fruity as I thought it would be after the smell. There was also some light hoppiness to give it a more rounded taste than just fruit juice, but for the most part, this beer was one-demensional. Mouthfeel was light and well carbonated. I liked this beer enough, and it was light enough to be a session beer, but I didn't really want another one after I was done."
"First chance to try Sweetwater in South Carolina! Very nice, had to go into Barleys to find it as it was no where to be seen outside, but I may have just missed it. Anyway it poured a fairly bright golden yellow with a large fizzy white head. This gradually faded and was replaced by a thin film of lace and copious amounts dripping down the side. Ample carbonation could be seen in the somewhat hazy interior of the glass. The aroma was very light, not overwhelming with the fruit at all, but rather very subtly blueberry with hints of yeast and a somewhat muted hop presence. A touch of bread like malts in the back. The taste was lighter then what I had thought. A typical yeasty pale with a significant touch of blueberry in the front. Ample carbonation again gave it a very nice and light feeling along with keeping it from going flat. There was a decent enough dry finish and the flavor did linger for a decent amount of time. I put the first one down in no time flat, but as far as how many I could have, the sweetness may limit this, as I find after too many I start to get a little queasy. Now overall this was not bad by any means, I thought it to be a rather nice light fruity brew. However I will stick to my IPA's in the future."
"Drinkability: It's alright, but as with most fruit beers, one helping is more than enough for me."
"Slightly hazed pale yellow color under a thin, quickly vanishing, bubbly white head. Smells like blueberries, not artificial, but like the real deal. Very much like blueberry pancakes actually only with a faint citrus note and a musty whiff here and there. Luckily, the flavor of the berries does not dominate. There's enough grain and mild sweetness to balance it out nicely, leaving you with a beer that is unmistakably a fruit beer, but not in an overwhelming, syrupy kind of way. Pretty light in body with a refreshing amount of carbonation. Hopefully this will make it to the Eastern half of the state by next summer as this would make a great summer thirst-quencher."
"Drinkability; yes. Nothing over-powering here. A good, crisp, clean brew with mild complexity. Good on a hot day or if you want something to stand out with mild but direct good flavors."
"I am typically not a big fan of fruit / vegetable beers, but Sweetwater Blue has a suddle taste of blueberry which is refreshing during the summer months in Hotlanta. It is a good compliment to the hot wings and blue cheese I enjoyed during the tasting."
"Smells much better than it tastes, though still a pretty yummy beer. I'd trade a bit of drinkability for more body, but I bet it'd be great on a hot summer day."
"Poursa fizzy yellow with a decent head that fades quickly. No lacing. Smell is intensely of sweetened blueberries- not artificial exactly, but quite candyish and a little bit cloying. The taste is thankfully a little more subtle, but still a little much. The body is so light and the beer is sweet enough to be a little alchopoppy- but a little higher quality. Eh."
"Pours a clear golden straw with a one finger white head that dies down pretty quick. Lacing is non-existant. Crazy amount of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Smell is of young blueberries with a nice wheat background. No hops or malt in the nose. Taste is pretty weak on the blueberry, kind of disappointed about that. Wheat and a bit of spice as well tingle the tounge. Very light bodied, fresh, crisp, clean. I could enjoy a couple of these on a hot summer day. This is one of two blueberry beers I've had, the other being Wachusett Blueberry and if I had to choose between the two I would go for Wachusett. Good attempt at this type of beer Sweetwater, but could tweek the flavoring a bit to make this even better."
"Pours clear yellow with no head and very slight lace. Smells almost cloyingly sweet; blueberries, unfermented sugar, perhaps a touch of corn. Flavor is very poor. Un-ripedened green blueberries, leafy stems, and creamed corn. Thin body with vague carbonation. Not something I'll return to."
"Pours goldenrod colored with thin head that leaves quickly. Smell is of berries and grass. Blueberry is there and obvious but not overpowering. Taste is fruit/berry forward but there is a little yeast/bread undertone that was not expected (in a bad way). The taste was not bad, just off a little from my expectation. Carbonation was good and body about right for style of beer. Decently drinkable, more of a warm weather beer in my book."
"Sweetwater Blue pours producing very little head that dissipates into nothing within a few minutes. It gives off an aroma like blueberry muffints, but tastes a bit more peppery than like blue berries. The initial taste is like the aftertaste of a blueberry muffin, but finishes a bit peppery as I previously said. This brew feels kind of syrupy and finishes kind of weak."
"Aroma has just a hint of the fruit, not overbearing but you know what it is. Taste is good, the blueberry is subtle, and I can get some sweet malt flavor also. Hops are very mild. Sweetwater makes great beer, this one is good. Would be very refreshing on a hot summer day and I could quaff two or three but would need to switch to something heavier. This is the way a beer with fruit should taste."
"12oz brown bottle with a best by date of 1/22/07. Pours a crystal clear medium gold with a one finger head that faded quickly leaving no lace. Smells of what else - blueberries - with a slight spicyness behind it. Blueberries are not predominate in the taste, although they are there. behind the initial blueberry flavor is a caramel malt followed by a slight hop flavor and bitterness, finishing with a fruit like aftertaste. Very spritzy with high carbonation. A good summer beer but I don't think I would want more than two in a sittting."
"Not sure how I feel about this beer. On the one hand, I think they did a nice job with the blueberry flavor, so that it complements rather than dominates. The problem is that there is not much there to complement or dominate. Easy to drink, though. I wouldn't turn it down, especially on a hot day, but I really wouldn't seek it out, either."
"Not a typical style you find all over, but it is served in many Atlanta bars...the brewery guide said they are only distributing in a limited area, so those of us in the northeast will not be seeing Sweetwater anytime soon."
"Overall: An OK blueberry-flavored ale. Worth a try."
"d - not a lot going on here. i love sweetwater but they should have gotten rid of this instead of exodus porter in favor of the new summer hummer. this is my girlfriend's favorite craft beer because it's ""not bitter."" that should tell you all you need to know."
"Thanks to SilentSabre for including this one!"
"Ideal for summertime thirst quenching, this beer offers a lot to whet the whistle, but lacks enough character to appeal to the serious craft beer enthusiasts, at least after the aroma."
"Served in a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Appearance is very plain golden poured with little head, dissipated quickly. No lacing. Smell is where this beer does very well, smelling very strongly of blueberries (which is obviously what it's going for). Taste follows suit, strong blueberry flavor, which I think is quite delicious. Still has a good amount of malt and hoppiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, average, nothing special. A little too sweet to drink more than 1."
"Give it a shot if you can find it, but don't waste time seeking it out exclusively."
"This was a tough one to rate...it was a very good blueberry pancake syrup. Unfortunately, I was drinking beer. Initial aroma of blueberries is strongly present the second the bottle is opened, and stays throughout the glass. However, at mid glass, I also detected a slight soapy aroma. Appearance is golden yellow with thick white head and decent lacing. Flavor was more of the blueberry taste, and finish was so strongly blueberry, if I hadnt known better, I would have sworn I just finished a good breakfast, instead of an after work drink. Sadly, like with pancakes, a little of this beer goes a long way, and I couldnt have many."
"This beer poured a light straw color with a small head. There was very little head retention. Smell was sweet and like a floral/berry smell. Taste is a sweet blueberry that balances well with the light malt flavor. Mouthfeel is light, crisp without lingering. As for drinkability - I would surprisingly like another right now!"
"Drinkability: Fruit beers don't bother me the way they do some others so I would give this good marks as a drinkable beer for those who like a fruity twist without much else going on - one of the better examples of this style"
"Saw this in Atlanta recently I didnt buy it since I most often hate fruit laced beers but I tried one anyway. The beer is a light golden color with virtually no head. It smells mainly of blueberries. It tasted mainly of blueberries with slight hop taste. Pretty decent for a blueberry beer ill give it that. I would not drink more than one a week though."
"Drinkability is also horrible. I can drink one of these, and after that I feel like any more and I'll be needing a railing to vomit over. It sits on your stomach, and on top of that it sours *very* quickly. This is not a good session beer, or (in my opinion), a good anything beer. If you want a fruit beer, get some Purple Haze."
"I'm not normally a fruit beer fan, but this was good. This is also my first blueberry beer. I like it!"
"This beer pours a dull gold with not much head that doesn't hold or lace well. The smell is all blueberries and a little overpowering. The taste is a little watery, mostly blueberries with very little ""beer"" taste. There is a decent carbonation but its a little watery. Overall, its too fruity and sweet and not enough of a beer."
"Michael - crying in my cereal..."
"Had this beer on tap at my favorite watering hole. It pours nearly the same color as Sweetwaters signature brew 420 Pale Ale, a clear straw yellow color. However, the head fades faster and give some lacing on the early part of the mug. The smell is a blast of in your face blueberries. Smells like Boo-berry kids cereal. The taste is of blueberries but the berry flavor tastes too refined to me. It has a bit of a bite and the blueberry flavor doesnt seem to blend with the beer to me. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy. I think I will stick to Purple Haze when I feel the need for a light fruit beer. I love everything Sweetwater makes, however this one falls short for me"
"No a half bad blueberry ale here. Definitely light and spritzy and a warm weather and summer beer. A good choice for a light meal of fruit or salad. Not a complicated beer just something good to drink when it is hot."
"Nice drinking blueberry brew. A nice offering if you're in the mood for a fruity ale."
"This beer looks like an American Macro. Poured with a small head. The smell is fair. Of course it smells like blueberries. The taste is of blueberries with a bite. The mouthfeel is diminished because of this bite. I don't think I could drink many of these. There are much better offerings from Sweetwater. I will choose one of those next time."
"Tasting this beer was a surprise, I wasn't expecting much since I'm not a fan of fruit beers, but this one is actually good. The fruit taste isn't very overpowering, in fact I don't even notice it much at all. A malty taste which isn't too malty, it's a well balanced and suprisingly good beer."
"If you're looking specifically for a blueberry beer, I think Sea Dog is a better option. It taste more like blueberries, this taste more like beer."
"Ok, I know, another fruit beer. But is good, I promise. Pours a clear yellow, with white small carbo head. Not very impressive, but it's an ok looking beer. Smells yeasty, with good scents of blueberry. Has a sweet yeasty profile, with lots of blueberry flavor. Slighlty tart. Mouthfeel is medium body. Very good drinkable beer. Next to sea dog, this is one of my favorites. Hate that it's not distrubuted to Charlotte, what's that all about?"
"Bottle provided by UncleFlip, thanks for the opportunity! Freshness notches read month 10 week 2. Pours a half finger nearly white head over a crystal clear light straw colored liquid. Looks like a macro or light lager. Smells like blueberry skins, but also a bit mediciney. Tastes of blueberry meat, cherry (without the sour), a hint of winey, and acrid from carbonation. I'll be kind and say there's a hint of honey sweet from the malt. But, honestly, this beer is all about the blueberry...and it's not quite natural tasting. It's not completely medicine, like a homebrew I once flavored with cherry extract. Light body and overly carbonated. An interesting beer. Not bad, not one to that's going to make you salivate."
"Thanks for the blue cokes."
"Even though I've had a few sips of one of my brother's favorite beers and did not care for it, I went ahead and ordered a bottle myself last night while staying dry from Tropical Storm Cindy last night in Atlanta. It's better than Middlebury's counterpart, but still just okay. Could this not be a touch of blue in appearance for aesthetic purposes? Too clear and crisp in my opinion. not too overwhelming in smell or taste. The ladies at my table did enjoy it however. You may be able to get a few converts with this one."
"Begins with a pils like maltiness, cracker dry, and light. Perhaps a minor flourish of wheat-induced lemon, then it's onto blueberries and spun sugar. It's far from oversweet, it's body so light it's nearly frail, and for those that enjoy the fruit (as I do), it can be a voracious quaff. But's it's seems that it is better enjoyed while preoccupied with other pleasures. It pales when taken alone."
"Body is bordering watery, thin and lifeless. I would however quaff this on a hot afternoon when something very light is called for. Drinkable, just not overly desirable."
"Get a six pack for your girlfriend and snag one or two for yourself."
"Slightly hazy, yellow gold in hue with no further color development; damn, I wanted the liquid to be blue! Oh well. The head was white in color; at the zenith the foam was one finger in height. In a split second it dissipated to a very thin collar that was basically naked in the middle. There was no subsequent lacing. Disappointing. This beer is nothing special to look at. The nose is dead on if this was uncooked blueberry muffin mix. The blueberries dont smell fresh or real yet they dont smell so fake Im repulsed. Soft grainy notes are also in play. The potency is low and so is the complexity. The bouquet doesnt say much at all. It is not offensive but it is not inviting. Rather ho-hum. The palate is more rounded than the nose. Maltier too, I get a big blast of grains just like I did in the bouquet. Interestingly the blueberry flavor is very weak, I can find it at the back but it gets lost in this beer. What does it get lost in you may ask? Im not sure because there isnt much going on here. This is a brewpub quality, throwaway fruit beer. Ubiquitous. The palate has some flavor but it is odd and not that special. There is a cake-like sweetness that, while soft, is not working for me. Also, Im burping blueberries, which is not as cool as burping hops. The palate is inoffensive and undeveloped. Lackluster. Medium-light in body with low but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant and very fitting for this beer. I could see this beer being liked by a good number of people (maybe not BA types). I could also see this beer being hated by a good number of people (maybe BA types). To me this beer is just okay. I guess it would work on a really hot summer day but a glass of water might work better. Maybe this beer would be nice on a 4th July picnic with some fruit pie. Maybe that would be futile, it is more beery than fruity. Thanks to au1sec for the bottle, Ive want to try is oddity for a while. My curiosity is quenched one was enough for me."
"I had high hopes for Sweetwater Blue after giving it a few sniffs. Although it isn't the killer blueberry ale that I'm in search of (and have yet to find), it isn't a bad little summer brew. A little sugar and a little spice would spiff it up considerably. Thanks to au1sec for the bottle."
"This is a good one to quench your thirst with as it is very smooth and easy to drink."
"Pleasant. If Lindemanns made a blueberry lambic this is what I imagine it would taste like, albeit a bit less tart."
"Taste is of light wheat malt. Blueberry flavors and only lightly sweet and a tartness the smell did not hint at. Light bodied, a bit thin. Sweet in the aftertaste but again not as cloyingly sweet as I would have guessed. Not a bad blueberry ale, better than I gave it credit for but still just a dull wheat beer with some extract in it."
"Not the greatest fruit beer and not my favorite from Sweetwater but it's refreshing on a hot day."
"This beer poured a slightly cloudy, staw yellow color with almost no head to speak of. Nice ring of ""head"" around the circumference of the glass, though. The fact that this beer is made from/with blueberries is INSTANTLY noticeable in the smell. It won't knock you down, but you can definately tell it's got blue berries in it. Very lightly carbonated, which makes for really easy drinking. The taste is, well, of blue berries, and then a slightly biscuit-y aftertaste. Man, I could pound these damn things ALL night. Good taste, easy drinkin'. This is certainly a session beer, and I will buy more of this in the future."
"Poured out crystal clear pale yellow similar to a pilsner. Faint aroma of blueberries. Tastes crisp and refreshing, but with a funky blueberry perfumy quality that is annoying. Also can taste grainy maltyness. Unfortunately they forgot to put much hops in here to create any semblance of balance. This is definitely the worst from Sweetwater I've had."
"I should mention that this one is one month past the ""best if enjoyed by"" date. It pours a slightly hazy pale yellow color with a shortlived white head. Leaves very little lacing, but lots of tiny bubbles rush to the top of the glass, trying to get my attention. Aroma is tart berry, but only slight blueberry. Some biscuit and earthy yeast are also present, as are some faint citrus and piney hops. Taste is well carbonated, very tart with berry, and has some earthy yeast notes and wheatgrain. This isn't so bad, but is not one of Sweetwater's better offerings. I look forward to visiting my old haunts in Atlanta, this summer when the state of Georgia, hopefully, will allow their microbreweries to turn out some bigger beers. I'm certain that Sweetwater will be one of the leaders of the unchained."
"Tasted: 01/10/04"
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a finely carbonated white head that recedes in a minute or two and remains on the top of the beer for the duration. The aroma is very perfumy with a hint of blueberries. The carbonation hits the tongue and blocks out any intricacies in the maltiness. A slight hint of blueberries manages to sneak in there before disappearing again. It reappears even more faintly in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin and light-bodied. Drinkability is below my average for Sweetwater Brewing Company. If you accidentally allow the beer to warm greatly, the perfuminess of the brew is overpowering, and in my case, stomach-turning."
"On tap at the Mill in Birmingham, AL. Fizzy, cloudy yellow body. Tight fizzy white head. Noticable fresh picked blueberry and cut grains smell. Nice blueberry taste, crisp and clean. Plenty of hop snap to the finish to clean things out. Nice fruit taste without the fuzzy tongue coating of some other fruit beers. Blueberry taste is pretty good. Light bodied and highly charged carbonation. A decent version and right up there with Bar Harbor Blueberry Ale."
"This beer poured a hazy yellow gold gold color and formed a small bubbly white head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of hops, malt and blueberry/cirtrus. The flavor was of hops with a hint of blueberry but finishes with a grain/wheat style similar to a wheat beer. I think our local brewer Barley's does a better job with their Raspberry Wheat than what they are trying to accomplish here."
"What a great fruit beer. The beer has a nose of blueberry, with hints of hops and traces of malt. The color is a pale cloudy yellow consistent of a wheat brew, with a small white head. The taste is that of blueberry muffins, which is what you would expect of a blueberry wheat beer. The finish has subtle malt and very light hops with I think help to keep the sweetness of the blueberries in check. Very drinkable fruit beer without too much sweetness. I agree with Uglyradio?s assessment in that I could not drink this all the time, but I wouldn?t drink any fruit beer on more than an occasional basis."
"Very passable fruit beer. Thanks belgianhomebrew! Aroma was sweet and fruity. Pale gold with a medium bone white head. Flavor was reminiscent of a Witbier like Blue Moon. I honestly did not detect any blueberries in the flavor. On the scale of light, thin summer beers I couldn't find much wrong with it."
"The pour a hazy lemon yellow color, the head mastodonic, frothy, brilliant white in color, the lace is silky sheets, which cling to the glass. The nose is citrus, sweet blueberry tones, clean and fresh. Start is sweet, the top light in mouth feel, the finish excessively acidic, minimally hopped, sparingly dry, and not something that ""excites"" me much."
"Not really the best beer.  Some chill haze and a weak head.  One eyebrow went up when I took a whiff.  Interesting blueberry aroma with something pungent in the background, not sure what, maybe some yeast.  Has a distinctive blueberry flavor, but I agree it doesn't taste natural.  No bitterness at all, there is a very faint floral, almost perfumey flavor in the background, perhaps a feable attempt to achieve complexity.  Fizzy and no real aftertaste.  This may be for some, but not for me.  Keep trying Sweetwater."
"This beer is horrible. Take a bag of Jiffy blueberry muffin mix and turn it into a beer. The Jiffy muffins are only barely edible to start with and when they're turned into beer it's undrinkable. I couldn't finish the freaking pint. It was just gross. They say they use fresh blueberries, but it tastes like the fake stuff. This beer really pissed me off. The smell is ok, though, but imagine a budweiser (a little darker) with a slight greenish tint from the blueberries. Horrible, Horrible beer."
