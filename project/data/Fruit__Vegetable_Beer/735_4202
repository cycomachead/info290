Just given the fact that they actually accomplished a watermelon note blended with a fruity wheat flavor is somewhat exceptional to me. Not that it's a great beer, but bc if the feat itself. I can't say I'll ever have another, but this is proof American brewers are yet again pushing the limits of flavor.","BradtheGreat7","Mar 27, 2015"

The taste was...interesting. At first I almost spit it out. I was overwhelmed by the watermelon. But I steadied myself and kept trying it. The taste settled and it actually became rather pleasant. It's a nice drinking beer on a summer day, but nothing to write home about. Unless you're going home for the summer, and need a beer to drink for that.","kissmybunniebutt","Mar 26, 2015"

Again like it’s aroma it also has a slight mineral flavor note and just a very light herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Notes: This is definitely a hot summer day or lawn mower beer. It’s thin and light making it easy drinking and interesting. It like that the watermelon taste is natural and some candy like flavoring added to a light wheat beer.","generallee","Jul 04, 2014"

It's a quaffer, great for music festivals and sporting events where you just want something semi-refreshing and accessible to gulp and share with friends. Especially good for the non-beer-loving females. In the overall scheme of things though, there are much better things to be drank out there.","Immortale25","Jun 10, 2014"

Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing. The brew smells mostly like sweet and bready malt, along with a bit of watermelon Jolly Rancher candy. The taste is similar to the aroma, except that there's more balance between the malty and watermelon flavor. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's smooth and easy enough to drink. Not a bad beer for a hot day. I only grabbed this since I was able to get a single can at my local Kroger.

The aroma is a musty combination of hops and wheat that is contrasted by a fruity brightness from the watermelon juice. The flavor similarly features the light, juicy watermelon character that tries to uplift, sweeten, and freshen the underlying flavors, but the dull wheat and musty, grassy hops keep the flavor on the dry side. The fine, light carbonation gives an airiness to the mouthfeel that also works to lighten the flavors.

Aroma of melon (smells a bit more like cantelope, actually) and light wheat. Flavor is sweet wheat, watermelon (distinct in the flavor) with hints of caramel as it finishes slightly dry with light grassy hops. Light bodied, as appropriate. A pleasant surprise, I was not expecting much from this combination, but the light watermelon add a delicate fruit sweetness to the wheat which worked quite well. I would definitely think about this for lawn mowing. This would have been too light for a witbier, but delivers exactly what it advertises as a watermelon wheat.","LiquidAmber","Jul 10, 2013"

3.73,13,3.25,3.25,4,3.5,4,"I don't think I would have ever decided to try watermelon beer if there were no outside influences. But, I had just read an online article about coming down off your manly beer perch and trying fruit beers. In total wine, a reasonably attractive woman saw me looking at the can and commented that it was very good with a winning smile. These forces combined with my uncontrollable urge to try something new or different everytime I'm faced with the Wall Of Beer (and yes, it should be capitialized) lead me to setting down on the couch to watch Disney Channel with my family with a pale yellow, fizzy conncoction smelling like one of the kids dropped a jolly rancher in my beer. After the first drink, I smiled and examinied my glass again. Hazy yellow, thin head with two scents; a good wheat and candy watermelon. I smiled wider and handed the glass to my wife. "What does that taste like to you?" I was thinking that no way should a good beer and watermelon work together....but it did! My better half took a tenitive sip, "Cherry?" I'm still not sure how she got that. Bigger swallow, "watermelon!" I don't think the normal review would give this beer it's due. Long and short of it is, it tastes good! Low enough ABV to qualify as sessionable, light enough to allow drinking a few and with enough flavor that you want to. Now, I will say that it may be too sweet for some people to session, but give it a try.","Cyrano41","May 21, 2013"

4.09,23.9,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours a clean, pale yellow with a hint of orange. The beer forms a rocky head of slightly creamy white bubbles. The beers body is nearly crystal clear with just a faint hazing, and the beer’s head leaves a lacing of sticky dry bubbles. On the nose, the beer smells tart and citric with a nice sweet underlying melon scent that gives a touch of grassy hops. There is also a slight jammy smell that is a part of the melon smell, but I assume that is just the fruit in the beer. From the can, the sweet fruit is more pronounced with a touch of vegetal scents. On the tongue the beer tastes sweet with a light tartness and some lovely distinctions between the calmer sweet of the malt and the fruitier sweet of the melon. In flavor the beer begins as sweet bread and then slowly moves into distinct bitter watermelon flavors, which is impressive. There is a light citric tartness underlying the flavors, but the water melon builds into a big, sweet crescendo in the finish, leaving the aftertaste clean with a slight hint of lingering malt sweetness. From the can it tastes more metallic and chemically from the can. It definitely tastes better from the glass. In the mouth the beer feels crisp and on the heavier side of light in body with a touch of citric spritz from the medium carbonation levels. The mouth is left clean and a little tingly with some slight bitterness. Overall, this a great crisp summer beer that incorporates the watermelon flavor beautifully. It is not too sweet, just a touch tart, and just a touch bitter and is great to drink. It is a great fruit beer with not too much overpowering fruit. Try this beer.","Maxwell","May 13, 2013"

On the taste, the first thing that hit me was how much more carbonation there was on the taste than what I could see in the glass. The next thing that hit me was that this tasted exactly like a liquid watermelon jolly rancher to me. This was completely saturated with lots of artificial watermelon, which wasn’t all that pleasant. After that, I really didn’t get anything else. Any other flavors were completely hidden by the watermelon. The finish was quick, again with watermelon.

Hazy deep yellow colored liquid, holds light inside well, few bubbles, loosely aggregated, nothing leaps out at you visually. The nose is soft and gentle, wheat cereal, biscuit and, duh, sweet watermelon scents, you get lemon juice as well, ends with an earthy and herbal muskiness which is actually welcome for how it broadens the texture and creates contrast against the fruit. Medium-bodied with fluffy carbonation, has some residual prickle through the finish. The watermelon flavoring is not excessively strong, kind of floats through the mouth. There’s a metallic undercurrent more than wheat or bread, although there’s an adequate amount of the latter. Sour lemon to orange citrus brings added refreshing qualities. At times you might find a spoonful of molasses. Nothing here really distinguishes it but it’s unflawed, not entirely without appeal.","farrago","Jun 27, 2012"

This is quite simply the worst beer I've ever tasted. The flavor is what I'd imagine it would taste like if you let the leftover milk from a bowl of cereal sit out for a day and then tried to drink it. The body has a weird creaminess to it, only highlighting the awful taste. The carbonation is on the low side.

3.97,20.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a can into a weisse vase, the beer is a cloudy, opaque, pale yellow-gold coloring with no head whatsoever. Aromas of tangy sweet watermelon and toasted grains. Flavors are light and sweet, with a strong watermelon character on the forward tongue that gives you a sugary tart profile atop the toasted grain backbone. The aftertaste is light and quick, with a strong watermelon character and tangy feel. Crisp, light finish. This beer is very easy to drink, and great on a hot day. Also goes well with a wedge of watermelon, as we originally had it at 21st Amendment in SanFran.","GarthDanielson","Apr 17, 2012"

Rather than the Jolly Rancher monstrosity I expected, the watermelon note was quite subtile, just barely there in the background of an otherwise quite clean and light wheat. Some citrus balanced well with the melon, and there was a hint of fruity perfume in the aftertaste.

I brace for the taste… ah, found the watermelon! There is a dominating, yet artificial watermelon flavor reminiscent of a jolly rancher or some other sugary candy. An odd milk like flavor sits between the melon and a faint wheat base. The mouthfeel is light, and a bit lively from the carbonation. Nothing spectacular, as it is a bit thin.

The profile of this beer overall is very light, but that doesn’t keep it from being the perfect thirst quencher, especially when it’s 115º outside.

A reasonable head formed upon pour, but quickly left just a thin layer that clung just a bit to the sides. Aroma was a bit off putting, smelled slightly sour with a hint of pickles and grain. Taste was of watered down watermelon bubble gum or diluted sorbet. Not a natural flavor, but one that was easily identifiable. Felt thin and watery in the mouth. Didn't coat at all and had just a tad of carbonation while drinking. Overall was a blah beer.

I've tried it on several more occcasions since then, on the off chance that maybe there was something wrong with my palate or I'd just gotten an unusually bland batch. No such luck.

3.33,0.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a very nice looking, white, one and a half finger head, I can slightly hear it fizzing though which isn't a great sign. It's mostly all small bubbles and it has kind of a pillowy look to it. It's not hanging around too long, but better than some beers I supposed. It has decent lacing. The body is a cloudy orange-yellow color, I'd like it to be a little cloudier to be honest, but it's pretty legit, I can't see through it at all. Overall it's a decent look, the lacing could be better and the head could have lasted longer, but for a wheat beer it's not bad. I get two main things on the smell, the first is watermelon, and the second is cheap beer. It's not an overpowering watermelon smell and that is good, a lot of these wheat beers overdo it with the fruit, and this clearly doesn't. The cheap beer smell worries me because it's a pretty clear smell, not much question about what I'm smelling. It smells refreshing, and I doubt I'll dislike it, but that cheap beer smell may cause some problems on the taste. The taste is good, it's mostly just watermelon though, not much else to it. The good news is that it doesn't taste like cheap beer, just a one sided beer. You do get a little bit of a can taste to it, which really pisses me off because all these micro breweries promise that even though they put their beers in cans - it wont taste metallicy, well this does, just slightly, but it does. Maybe the metallic taste was the cheap beer smell I was picking up on. The watermelon taste is good, they for sure didn't overdo it with the watermelon taste and that's good, frankly I'd like a little more, but in these fruit beers it's better to have less than more, because some breweries go nuts with fruit. The wheat aspect is a little different, I mean it looks like a wheat beer, but it real doesn't feel like a wheat beer that much, there is a tiny wheat feel, but for the most part it's too thin. So considering that, the mouthfeel isn't all that great, the carbonation is right, but they skimped out on the wheat, in a wheat beer, so...yeah. The drinkability is good, it goes down very well. Overall on this beer, it's a good beer, it's has some areas that could for sure be improved on, like the head/lacing, and the wheat, but overall it's not bad, it's very tasty and refreshing.","MaltsOfGlory","May 14, 2011"

Aromatics offer up a tame laid back sweetness from the sharp citrus wheat back bone. Fruity watermelon layers with pretty much absent hop additions. I like the low alcohol fruit vibe kick every now and again. A chalky yeast and minimal floral note wrapped within the watermelon puree, this stuff smells inviting and not candy sweet which is definitely a good thing. Flavor is light with juicy edges almost like bubblegum edges to it, but the watermelon puree acts as a refresher in this mix. Some hard mineral water action with a yeast wheat infused malt backbone, really straight forward flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky but not syrupy in anyway smooth ample carbonation levels, it's nice to see this available in the Burgh at Giant Eagle Marketplace.

It has a smooth pale and wheat malt flavor with a mild watermelon character. It's got a weird taste to it, but I guess it's the fruit. I'm not used to watermelon flavored beers.

It is loaded with carbonation, it's a slightly pale golden color, not much head, with a nose that has plenty of lemony floral characteristics, and yes, I think I get a whiff of the watermelon too. Thre is a slightly prickly mouthfeel from the wheat, which adds a bit of texture to what would otherwise be a pretty water fare. The beer is refreshing. The taste is more of a sweet fruity concoction but there is a definite watermelon presence throughout. Watermelon is not a strongly flavored fruit, unlike a strawberry or blueberry, and I think that is true as an adjunct in beer as well. The watermelon is not overpowering, more subtle and well blended with the other fruit flavors. There is no real aftertaste to the beer. It's light, it's fun, what's not to like.","albern","Dec 20, 2009"

Mouthfeel is light-bodied and evenly carbonated - just the right amount of effervescence to give some body while also being refreshing. Finish is fairly dry and clean.

Like a typical wheat beer, except there isn't a huge yeasty/wheaty flavour. The watermelon blends it in very nicely, otherwise it would be very forgettable. No hop presence whatsoever. Mouthfeel is thin, kind of watery, but I think that's what they were going for. This is my definition of a craft lawnmower beer - light, straightforward, not terrible.

Upon my first sip, yeah there's watermelon in here. Having a hard time figuring out whether watermelon extract or watermelon puree/pulp is used is this brew. Not sure you'd get this type of Jolly Rancher flavor from real watermelon pulp. Regardless, this tastes just as the label states which to me, is a good thing since I am a fan of watermelon.

The watermelon definitely comes through on this one, adding both a few complex fruit sugars as well as a tart, slightly puckering note in the finish. It works decently well with the beer's base too, though the whole package just leaves a little to be desired, in my opinion. On the drinkable side, it's low in alcohol and solidly made. Perhaps a few tweaks with this one - adjusting the malt base to something a little solider and simpler, and modifying the watermelon addition somehow (I know this is difficult, haha) would make this one a really tasty fruit beer.

Otherwise, still a decent wheat beer to drink in the summer.","tiga2000","Jul 28, 2008"

3.36,1.8,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"It's a light hazy gold, served in a hefe glass with a slice of watermelon on the rim. The smell is easily watermelon when there's a watermelon wedge sitting right on the rim. But if you take that off and inspect it after the juices have left the rim it doesn't smell like anything more than a standard wheat beer. The taste is the same... without the watermelon slice on top or in the drink it just tastes like a fairly standard wheat. Still, it's not bad for a wheat beer but I don't think it's as unique as people think. The mouthfeel was a bit too spritzy/harsh and grainy for me. I could definitely still drink this if I needed a wheat beer, but it doesn't stand out that much above others.","MiScusi","Jun 15, 2008"

4.38,32.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The watermelon wheat looks like any unfiltered wheat beer: amber and cloudy. It has a white bubbly head that thins quickly. The nose is almost all wheat grain. It isn't until the first drink that you get a hint of watermelon. It is subtle, but noticeable, and adds a bit of sweetness to the beer. The closest I can get to describing the flavor is watermelon Jolly Rancher, but it not nearly that overpoweringly sweet. More like someone near you is eating a watermelon Jolly Rancher and you occasionally get a whiff. I was surprised to find that the watermelon is a nice complement to the wheatiness of the beer. Not a beer I would drink every day, but very good; much better than I expected.","phergy","May 20, 2008"
3.31,0.3,2.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Pours very light colored with a small head. Definite watermelon smell, and taste. Easy drinking, slightly bittered watered down watermelon flavor. Nice in that you get the flavor you're expecting, but needs to be a slight bit fuller bodied and flavored, even for a summer refresher, I thought. Ok, but not as good as I hoped it would be.","JDV","Jan 31, 2008"
3.63,10,3.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Poured from the 12oz can into a weizen glass. Body is a cloudy golden hue, topped by a bright white ring of creamy head. Aroma of wheat and lightly sweet fruit, along with a touch of adjunct malt. Palate is dominated by a nice, clean, mild wheat character up front. The fruitiness of this beer is nicely understated - only a hint of watermelon emerges towards the back of the mouth, and lingers only slightly on the finish. The body is pleasantly creamy, but still quite light and airy. A very refreshing beer on a warm summer evening.","ElGordo","Aug 28, 2007"

3.44,4.2,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,"The body is light but the watermelon aftertaste (more of a hint) leaves a slight sweeter flavor. But not a malty sweet more of a fruity sugar sweet. Carbonation felt low but an interesting wheat fruit experiment.","Oxymoron","May 29, 2007"

2.11,-36.1,3,2,2,2.5,2,"It's slighty hazy and amber, with no head to speak of. The nose is bitter watermelon and not much else. Taste is lots of watermelon, but it's not sweet at all. It's like watermelon vines. Very acrid and metallic. Mouthfeel is ok I suppose, it's a bit watery. The drinkability suffers from the non-sweet punch of watermelon flavor.","shivtim","Oct 02, 2006"

3.92,18.8,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"OK I'm pretty impressed with this. I really wanted to try it for the gimmick of a watermelon beer but I was pleasantly surprised to find a refreshing beer with alot of flavor. The appearance isn't anything to brag about and the aroma was a little like a capri-sun but the flavor was everything I thought it wouldn't be. Thankfully this is not a sweet beer. If it had been I think it would have ruined the beer by fullfilling my expectation of a watermelon extract/candy alcoholic schnaaps-like drink. Instead the fruit presence is definitely melon but was more cantaloupe than sugary. Highly drinkable... go get some!","Chadbrew","Jun 29, 2006"
