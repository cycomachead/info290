I'll finish the six but will never think about buying this again.","Urk1127","Mar 20, 2015"

3.15,-3.4,,,,,,"And I'm listening to ""All Along the Watchtower""...  Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises dry wheat, raspberry syrup, and a touch of corn.  The taste leads with the corn before immediately getting blindsided by the very artificial-tasting raspberry syrup.  Then everything returns to a bland corn-y situation.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this beer ain't my jam (no raspberry pun intended), what with the artificial taste and one-sad-note offering.  It's not horrible, but I'll likely never drink one again.","TMoney2591","Aug 30, 2014"
3.45,5.8,,,,,,"What I would call a nice after dinner beer. The pour is dark red/purple with an off white head. The smell is full of berries, specifically raspberry.

Its amber colored with a white foamy head and looks great. My first smell I assumed it was going to be very sugary because it seemed very sweet and had light raspberry tones. Luckily I was proven wrong! Its light to medium bodied and has a great fruity feel finishing with strong notes of malts and wheat. Its well balanced and layered wonderfully!","AyeMito","Jul 08, 2014"

The aroma is is of wheat and raspberries. the taste is the same actually with the perfect blend of bot the raspberries and wheat, where not one was over powering at all. Not as sweet as you might thing and finished with a slight tangy finish. Overall a tasty brew!","BeerWithMike","Jul 07, 2014"

Light head that diminishes in 2 minutes with little lacing. Very light nose of raspberry. Light bodied with some pulp. Normal carbonation level. The weak flavor profile is raspberry, but you have to look for it since there is very little flavor present.

3.8,16.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 6/5/2013. Pours moderately hazy and cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart raspberry, wheat, cracker, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with big strength of raspberries that smell very authentic. Taste of raspberry, wheat, cracker, floral, grass, light pepper, and floral earthiness. Lingering notes of raspberry, wheat, cracker, floral, grass, light pepper, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of raspberry, bready malt, and hop notes; with a decent amount of robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good fruit beer. Good balance of fruit, malt, and hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. I definitely enjoyed this as a nice session-able brew.","superspak","Jul 02, 2013"

Light to medium bodied, a foundation of malted grain, tart raspberry, and some earthy hop bitterness. Overall, decent fruit beer, the main plus for me with this one is that there is not a sticky artificial fruit flavor that many fruit beers have. Nice session beer.","GossageBrewery","Apr 09, 2013"

This pours a slightly hazy light brown/golden color with a massive wheat beer sized head which has a long retention. The smells are similar to a pilsner, some grass hops, wheat and a hint of raspberries. The feel is medium to a little thinner. The taste is okay, more thin and light than I was expecting, you get some wheat, very faint hop bitterness (almost none) and a very light raspberry, far lighter than I was expecting.","DavidST","Dec 08, 2012"

I smell berry on the nose but it does seem a bit manufactured. The taste is nice, raspberries and wheat, the raspberries seem to be more from a bottle and less real.

Funny, but for a beer brewed with raspberries and called purple haze, I was definitely expecting more color. The nose holds a bit of tart raspberry along with a spicy wheat and bready malt aroma. The flavor is sweet with mild raspberry flavor that peeks in and out of a bready honey like spicy wheat malt base. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet watery and slick mouthfeel. This is just so blah. The berries feel weak and artificial and the underlying beer is uninspiring as well.","johnnnniee","Dec 07, 2012"

The cool part is that the berries come out and sucker punch you once you take a sip, and then it fades quickly, getting replaced by easily detectable wheat malts- yet the raspberries linger more than the malts in the overall aftertaste.

3.33,2.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The brew poured with a two finger white head with an orange, cloudy body. There was no visible carbonation due to the cloudiness. There was a lot of fruit, mostly raspberry, on the nose, which is to be expected. There is some lacing left on the glass. The first sip is a lot of raspberries, but a lot of carbonation. I’ve had this before, and this is not what it tastes like. Something is missing. It almost tastes like raspberry seltzer. There is definitely something wrong with this beer. It’s so watery and weak. This pint is definitely not reflective of the beer itself. Normally, the beer is a nice mouthful of raspberries with a hint of wheat mixed in. It goes down quick and it goes down easy. Not this one. I think perhaps I got a bad pint. Anyways, Abita Purple Haze is an easy session beer with some great flavor. Just don’t try it at Court Jester in Freehold.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

3.1,-4.9,3,3,3,4,3,"Pours a clear reddish-yellow with a foamy bone colored head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, grain, and some slight berry aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight perfume-like flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but not something I would seek out again.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 24, 2012"

3.08,-5.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"The beer pours a cloudy clear pink like water, piss, and strawberry juice. It definitely has a slight purple haze. There is little to no head, but a ring around the glass that is soap white. The beer is quite hazy and clear amber, which is a strange color for beer. The beer smells like sour bread with some nice wheat wafting and a salty stale bread smell as it settles and it almost reminds me of buttered toast. The beer tastes heavy with wheat malt, with an oh-so-subtle hint of raspberries. Overall it seems to give a taste of flavored water with a lot of wheat. The aftertaste brings the tart fruit a little more forward, but still it remains quite mellow. The mouthfeel begins a little uncomfortable with carbonation, but settles out into a thick and oddly creamy feel, and is really quite drinkable and watery. This beer just can’t decide what it is. I don’t get enough malt and not enough fruity flavors for me. It sits uncomfortably in the middle and thus doesn’t seem to really claim a category and leaves me at a loss to label it. This is a meh beer.","Maxwell","Aug 22, 2012"

Nose was still filled with raspberry, but not as cloying as from a bottle. Mouthfeel was about the same - slightly on the thin side. The taste was not as prevalent as from a bottle, more muted. Finish also lacked some of the oomph that the bottle imparted. Bottom line: if somewhere that both are available, go for bottle or draft, but if hiking, camping, going to the beach, reach for the CANned version. That, or if they begin putting fresh puree in CANs, then it will render the point moot.","woodychandler","May 28, 2012"

For what it is - a relatively light American lager - I can't think of many other beers I'd prefer to drink when that's what I'm looking for.

The fruit juice comes in near the end and it has a sort of dry finish. I don't really like the amount of carbonation it has but its not too bad. Theres no distinctive hop or malt character though.","bens0n","Dec 31, 2011"

Nose of grains, wheat, and coexisting citrus zest and raspberry.

This beer was the bottled list at the Kaystone Pub a while back when I was just starting to explore the beer world. The reason why I bought it was because the name made me think of Jimi Hendrix's song, so without hesitation I got one. The beer poured out as a slightly hazy golden color. The head was fluffy at first before it vanished. The smell of the beer was sweet and had a good amount of raspberry aromas in there. The taste I found to be a little on the light side. Not as much flavor as I was hoping. The mouthfeel was light and fairly refreshing. Overall it wasn't a bad gateway beer for me.

Usually not my cup of tea but this is a highly quaffable and enjoyable beer. Top notch","scootny","May 20, 2011"

The pour starts out with a huge, robust, three inch foamy white head that settles quickly into a thin film. Initial aromas are very similar to a framboise lambic, with very tart and sugary raspberry smells, but they are balanced with wheat aromas, as well, with some toasted cereal characteristics cutting the sweet towards the end. Smell is a bit strong, and a tad sour with the tart. Sharp and carbonated mouthfeel cuts the raspberry and wheat flavors. The sweetness is not overpowering, but the tartness does come through strong. There is a light fruit sweetness to the aftertaste, with a filmy and clingy finish. The increased carbonation makes the beer a little on the sharp side, but the flavors are light compared to how strong the aromas were to start. Interesting blend of flavors, but balance gets a little out of whack at times.","GarthDanielson","May 03, 2011"

I've had a lot of wheat beers and hefeweisens over the years, but this one may have the most wheat character of any that I've had.

Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation is leaden enough to add weight rather than create a lighter sensation. Sweet comes mainly from the raspberries and, again, vague maltiness.

Sweet raspberries up front but help snuff out the aroma of a very weak wheat that must be the base beer. Other then that, not very much. The wheat malt adds this odd underlying tartness to the aroma. Not a good aroma because it doesn't accent the raspberries very well. I wish the tart raspberries would have been more prevalent. Would have worked better with the tartness from the wheat. The flavor is much the same. Just flat average. Smucker's sweet raspberry jam mixed with a very ho hum wheat. The berry sweetness really comes through on the tail of the flavor profile.

Plenty of raspberry, but more like the manufactured, processed raspberries. I found some grassy, pale malts hidden in there too. The taste, however, it much better, with more muted flavor than the smell. The taste is still dominated by raspberries, but it's more balanced between tastes: fruit, pale malts, wheat. It's got a crisp little bite to it, but it's certainly not from any hop presence. The beer is well carbonated, and is quite refreshing with a long, sweet lingering flavor. I first had this beer when living in Mississippi, and after moving to New York, I was thrilled to learn that a bar near Times Square called Bourbon Street had it on tap.

Flavor has creamy but tart raspberry sweetness with lingering citrus frit and sharp wheat notes sticking around on the palate. It never gets too cloying with the sweetness, a nice mix of tart and mild creamy raspberry infused yogurt with that classic lactic character. Mouthfeel is creamy with even carbonation slightly sticky with a small amount of residual sugars clinging to the palate, body overall is medium to light textured.

The aftertaste is more concentrated on the sweet raspberry flavor than anything else, leaving a candy like component in the throat.

Initially sweet on the palate, with a healthy amount of wheat- and fruit-derived acidity, the fruitiness is only forward during the beginning and the end. There's a bit of a sour, tightly bitter finish, though, that ruins things a bit. Fresh and lively with acidity on the tongue. Overall, this is a decent fruit/wheat beer, with good fruit flavor and some crispness. Uncomplex but refreshing, it's nothing deep and doesn't have to be.","geexploitation","Jul 18, 2007"

After having had a Frambozen recently, this was a pleasant contrast in being just a subtle raspberry flavoring. Perhaps along the lines of how the apricot is to #9. This one had a solid cloudy look typical of a good wheat beer, yellow with a medium head. You do smell the rasberry most notably, but the flavor seems a little less obvious with a sour quality. This is a nice option for a wheat beer but not hugely compelling.","Durge","Jun 28, 2007"

The head was foamy and left some average lace. The aroma did not emphasize fruit, but instead this smelled more like a yeasty wheat ale with some sour mash. The taste was light with raspberry flavor coming through in a very subtle way. Unfortunately the malt base backing the fruit was very bland and flavorless, which was all the more surprising since the body was not too thin. Hardly any hop presence. I had seen this beer for a while on the shelves and had been avoiding it, since I am not a big fan of fruit beers.

Taste is fair to middling... faint wheat taste with faint raspberry and some twang. Finishes sort of bland. Mouthfeel is thin... not overly carbonated, but still doesn't really have much body.

Not a great beer but an OK beverage.","BitteBier","Mar 24, 2003"

3.4,4.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"The body is fairly light and it has a very crisp mouthfeel that would make it an exceptional summer brew. The fact that it is 3 degrees outside and we are due for 12 -20 inches of snow is not hurting it though. Lots of raspberries hit the tongue, and you are then presented with a nice wheat flavor that really balances it out. This is a pretty good fruity brew that could give you a little variety from time to time.","ElGuapo","Feb 16, 2003"
3,-8,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours yellow, slightly cloudy, no aroma to speak of. Thin head that does not last, no lace. Thin berry taste, more malt than fruit. Very little hop finish, tinny aftertaste. Not very good, one was enough.","HopheadEd","Jan 01, 2003"
2.7,-17.2,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Medium gold color, slightly pinkish and slightly cloudy. Small to no head. Aroma is raspberry at the start but fades to a little maltyness. A fairly typical and very average fruit wheat beer. Berry flavor is mild and pretty subdued, it is also a little too sweet, so it just as well the flavor is mild. Pretty average. Mouthfeel is neutral. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Dec 30, 2002"
4.02,23.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Not a bad little bayou beer. Had a frothy head to it and orange/yellowish color to it. I like Dixie beer, so I thought I would give it a shot. Wasn't disappointed. I was happy with my six of it and couldn't keep my buds from stealing it! Now I have to go get another six! This time I'm gonna hide it. Anyways, it went down smooth and had a semi-dry finish to it. You can definately smell the raspberry in it, but the fruity taste is a little more faint. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed ya'll!","JISurfer","Dec 18, 2002"
2.67,-18.1,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"it ain't purple, but it sure is hazy...a hazy orangeish color with no head and lace. slight grain and big raspberry aroma. crisp grainy tastes, followed by tart raspberries, sort of artificial. finishes crisp and grainy. i can see where this would be mighty refreshing in the middle of a brutally muggy and hot louisiana summer, but for a beer to enjoy and savor, it's bad. too much like a malternative.","budgood1","Dec 13, 2002"

1.3,-60.1,2,2,1,1,1,"Hazy gold appearance with a slight rasberry aroma. Very thin in body with a dry finish. I really thought this beer was horrible, maybe I got a bad batch but certainly would not pay money again for this.","Reverand","Oct 25, 2002"

3.33,2.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a decent creamy white head that sinks a little too quickly.  The nose has some slight yeast qualities to it but is mostly a sweet raspberry aroma.  Decent crisp wheat tastes start off this brew before it goes to a sticky, syrupy raspberry taste that is too overpowering.  The brew is a bit thin for being unfiltered but is fairly refreshing and fairly drinkable.  I would drink this again if offered from someone else but I won't be purchasing it again.  Not a bad brew but it is too much sweet raspberry and not enough wheat beer.","Murph","Sep 12, 2002"
2.95,-9.5,3,3,3,2.5,3,"This beer was an almost pinkish orange color with a small white head that didn't hold and left little lace.  It had a light aroma of grain and raspberry.  The flavor was lightly of raspberry and a bit tart.  The finish was light with a bit of the tartness.  A fairly weak beer for this style, but okay for a summer session brew I suppose.","Wildman","Aug 01, 2002"
3,-8,3,3,3,3,3,"You may remember the good times from N'awlin's, but that's about all this beer has going for it! I really don't understand it's popularity. Not much aroma but it has a nice malt base, a slight raspberry flavor. The fruit also gives it a gentle tartness which works pretty well. But overall, it seems kind of flabby - not out of balance in any way, just unexceptional in character. One more thing; I need to dispel the myth that this is a woman's beer. It's a fact guys - a sad and sorry fact - that more men drink this than women!","NeroFiddled","Jul 24, 2002"
3.5,7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Cloudy orange brown color with lots of suspended sediment, quite large rocky head when poured, settles to a thin layer with moderate lace.  The raspberries are quite prominent in the aroma, also has the distinct grain notes of wheat beer.  Flavor is quite crisp and tart, begins with malt flavor, then tart raspberries, with slight hops towards the finish.  Very refreshing, a good choice for summer in the warmer climes.","Pegasus","Jun 08, 2002"
3.92,20.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Notes: Simple and pleasant, no cloying sweetness or artificial fruit flavour. A great pick out of the numerous American brewed fruit beers.","Jason","Apr 10, 2002"
3.06,-6.1,4,3,3,3,3,"Take Abita Amber and give it just enough raspberry flavor to be noticeable and you've got Purple Haze. Kind of odd, actually. Amber is preferable.","aracauna","Apr 02, 2002"
3.57,9.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Passed on this beer a number of times because the name sounded too much like one of those cursed ""malternative"" beverages.  According to the label, raspberry puree is added ""after filtering," so I'm not sure if the raspberry is a brewing element or a flavoring adjunct.  Lots of yeasty sediment which decanted in spite of a careful pour, and flakes swirled around in my glass like a mineature blizzard.  Up front the flavor was a pretty typical wheat, reserved but reasonably crisp.  The raspberry was not at all prominent, and I got very little in the flavor, mostly showing up as a post-swallow aromatic.  Overall, nothing bad about this beer, but not terribly impressive, either.  Might be better on a hot day sitting in the shade (but what beer isn't?).","Brent","Mar 13, 2002"
