"Not heavy on the blueberry note, very lite in color...smells amazing, taste is decent! Would buy again, if in a pinch."

"Gold pour with quickly disappearing white head. Blueberry pie aromas. Sweet blueberry taste lite mouthfeel. Cloyingly sweet."
"Smell is outstanding. Popped one open, left the room, came back the whole room smelled like blueberry muffins. Taste is good. The blueberries are out front and delicious. It's not the greatest crafted brew I've had and the taste devolves/diminishes shortly thereafter, but its stays alright. Not a great fruit beer, but definitely a good one."

"Gulp, Gulp Gulp...ahhhhhhhh. Daddy likes.  The perfect beer for the perfect day by the pool.  Just not a winter beer.  For blueberry beers, it's only avg.....which is still very very very good."

"let me just say, there is a time and a place for this one, and when it is the time, and you find yourself in the place, this really can be pretty awesome beer. now i know its not the next great west coast ipa or barrel fermented sour ale, not even close, but we have to step back and appreciate this one for what it is. the fruit is genuine, not over the top, and has some tartness with its natural sugars. the wheat base beer is light, well enough crafted, if a big generic, and in combination with high carbonation levels, a clean finish for the style, and a real low abv, this is pretty cool beer in a warm weather context. its excellent with seafood, especially of the fried variety, and is honestly a pretty underrated beer. ive heard it goes off pretty quick with age, and that the bottles are better than the cans, but my first and only impression of this is resoundingly more positive than the other reviewers here on BA. honesty better than not bad, which i dont think its scores reflect very well. refreshing and worthy of taking up a few spaces in my refrigerator, not ashamed to say so."

"Pours a golden-amber in color with a white foamy cap that doesn't last a real long time. Some sheets of spotty lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the glass. The aroma is very pleasant and is like a fresh blueberry tart. The taste is pretty much the same with the blueberries and wheat right up front. Not as sweet as you might think though. Very smooth with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. A very refreshing brew with a great flavor for most anytime of the year, though the warmer months might be a tad better. I liked this one."

"Very nice and refreshing blueberry beer. Was a gift and  it really my style. That and the fact that it's 5 degrees outside is making it rather hard to enjoy.... Seems like it would most likely make a great refreshing treat on a hot summers day. I would reconsider this fruity delight again on a bit day... It's rather smooth and drinkable, a bit watery to earn elite status."

"An enjoyable enough fruit beer, the blueberry guest allowed to run rampant in many of its forms - confectionery to start, all the way to a decent intersection of fruitiness and acid by the finish.  Easy to drink, I could see having a few of these in the sun of a seaside summer patio."
"a travesty of blueberry-flavored beer and an uncalled for fiasco in my mouth, this blueberry wheat ale is lacking in taste when compared to many others--and the taste that is present is... kind of bad."

"It's a nice blueberry beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The folks at Sea Dog say: ""delightful aromatics and subtle flavor contributed by Maine wild blueberries."" I found the blueberries to be right out front, not that I minded that one iota. Not to sweeten but to balance the tang of the wheat. Great for a hot summer's day."

"Hazy color, no head when brought to my table. Very intense blueberry smell bursts off the top. Tastes about as sweet as it smells, a little on the sweet side, but not what I'd call overwhelming. Doesn't have that syrupy taste of some other fruit brews I've had. I have to say, the blueberry tastes like it's well blended in the malt, doesn't taste artificial or like it was added after the brewing process. If you're looking for hops, though, look elsewhere. I personally enjoy this one, I'm a bit partial to blueberries. Great choice of a dessert beer, or paired with fruit."
""
""
"Decent fruit beer, extremely easy to drink. Subtle as the blueberry itself, it sure feels real."
""
""
"O - While I appreciate having unique varieties of beers to suit different palates, this isn't a beer for me. I used to love this beer around the time I came of drinking age, but my tastes have changed. The beer is very drinkable and certainly not difficult to throw back, but is incredibly one note. I'd love to see variations off of this with a strong malt backbone or possibly an IPA variation. Anyway, this kind of beer is polarizing. It's a great beer for some and a terrible beer for others."
""
""
""
"O- best blueberry nose I've ever smelled. It's like blueberry muffins in a beer. The flavour isn't as packed with blueberries as the nose suggests but this is definitely a good brew."
"Overall, I was upset that the beer flavor did not live up to the name or smell."

"O - This is a good beer for a hot summer day. It's very easy to drink and while not a big beer, it isn't bad at all."

""
""
"Overall – A rather easy drinking fruit beer. It is nothing outstanding, but in terms of making for a not overly sweet, but moderately blueberry fruited flavored brew, this one has it right. Not too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Guilty of enjoying this one every once in a while: nothing stellar, but a nice change of pace. Some find the blueberry flavor artificial, but I think it is pleasant and worth trying once or twice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Pretty good. Not as dry as their raspberry beer, but I think that's more apt for the blueberry admixture. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes fruit infused wheat beers."

"In the taste there is also a good blueberry note but then I get something else akin to pale and wheat malts. But none of that is front and center. It is more subdued but noticeable. For a fruit beer this is not bad."
""
"The blueberry aroma strikes you at first, gently, with a delicate note of fresh aroma. The flavor has a nice blueberry note to it. It’s crisp with a sweet tinge and a pleasing carbonation. Not sure where the wheat comes from--hefe?--as it's more of a flavored blonde ale. Still, I’d have another on a summer day."
"Was quite impressed by this beer, took me by surprise. Tastes like a liquid blueberry muffin. Strong blueberry flavor up front followed by a biscuit/bread flavor at the end. Definitely will buy again and look forward to trying Sea Dog's other fruit beers."

"nice easy drinking fruit beer, good intro beer for people not into craft brew"
""
"I cant explain it with this beer. I don't usually care for fruit beers in general, but there is just something about this beer that I very much enjoy. Its ALL about the blueberry with this beer. Its very much the dominating flavor. If given the chance try this beer ice cold on a hot day."

"The beer wasn't as sweet or overpowering than the raspberry offering. Although it wasn't much to look at or feel, it was good. Unlike the raspberry, which tasted more like a wine cooler than anything else, the wild blueberry mixed well with the hops and malts both in taste and in the smell. Overall, it's good, refreshing, and quite crisp - a good summertime brew to share with friends and family."
""
"Okay. I know I have had this beer before but never reviewed or rated it. I have tried it again today. I will say that the beer is about a year old, so I can't really remember if it is representative of what it should taste like. Pours hazy golden color with small foamy head that quickly dissipates. Lacing is minimal. Well, it definitely smells like blueberries. There is a slightly acidic aroma as well. Malty taste when you first sip, followed by strong acidic taste and heavy blueberries. There is not much else but blueberries to taste. Not really my style. If i remember correctly, I didn't really like it the first time I tried it either."
""
""
"Overall- Very enjoyable beer. One of the better blueberry flavored beers that I've had."

"Overall, a great summer beer that tastes almost as good as Sam Adams Blackberry Witiber."

"Great blueberry beer that is not overwhelming with blueberry flavor. what sea dog does well is have the fruit pop out towards the end but before you swallow. Very well balanced and refreshing. This is the perfect beer to hang out in the backyard and is drinkable enough to pound down a few and not get tired of it"
"While still refreshing, I hate to say that I liked the apricot better."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is bursting with blueberries, very fruity. Taste is tart, wheat, some berries but not overwhelming with them, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"I had this on tap at Jerry Remy's Seaport. I was looking to try something new, and somehow didn't realize that this would be a blueberry beer from how it was labeled. I actually like fruit beers probably more than most on this site, but generally try to stay away from blueberry. As far as blueberry beers are concerned, this one is slightly better than others I've had (for instance, it didn't have actual blueberries floating around in it when it was served to me). Anyway, the color is pretty enticing with a deep gold and a short, soft head. The berry flavor is a bit strong for my liking, though. Just a little too sweet."

"I really like this beer. I'll be picking up a six pack here and there to enjoy."
"Overall: So far as fruit beers go, it's not bad. But people who aren't normally fond of the style will likely find the blueberry overwhelming. People who think the only real beer is Belgian, German, or as thick as motor oil will despise it. But if you're open to various styles, it's worth a look. I myself have a soft spot in my heart for it, because it reminds me of a recent trip to Ogunquit, Maine."

"Poured this Blueberry Beer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear yellow golden color, produced a thin white head and left little lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted grain and blueberry. Light in body, this ale had a foundation of malted grain, white pepper and blueberry. Overall, not a huge fan of ""blueberry"" beers but this one was not horrible. Decent session beer...Worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Oddly enough extremely nice combination of blueberry and beer. You can most definitely taste a strong blueberry flavor, but it doesn't overpower the wheatiness of the beer. The smell sort of reminds me of a blueberry pop-tart. Very happy with this beer."

"O - I immediately feel in love with this beer at World of Beer on Brady Street in Milwaukee, served with a few small blueberries at the bottom of the pint. I find the tap version a bit more elevated than this bottle, but it's quite a refreshing, easy drinking fruit beer with good blueberry taste and wheat smoothness nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I used to like this beer when I was first getting into ""craft"" but now I find it way too heavy on the blueberry to the point that it just tastes like blueberry flavored seltzer water. Obviously one that's mainly for the ladies."
""
""
""
""
"O- Pass on this one. Nice novelty, but grows old very quickly."
""

"Pours a very light golden color with white foam. Some violet tinting. Malt nose that evolves into a fruity berry scent. Fruity flavor, first and foremost. Very balanced though, with a mild tart berry finish. Creamy-ish. Good balance between fruit and beer. Quite fruit forward, but never overbearing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing, easy to drink, enjoyable, and sessionable. This is one of my favorite summer beers for cookouts - especially when I was living in NC and it was friggin hot in the summer."
"O: This would be an excellent selection for someone who likes fruity wheat beers. There’s nothing overly remarkable about the taste but it is quite easy to drink."
""
""
""
"This is one of the better Sea Dog offerings. They use syrup to add the blueberry flavor, but it doesn't come through as a sticky, syrupy mess. The flavor also doesn't come across as artificial. If you enjoy blueberries then you should give this a try."
":)"
""
""
"Overall - An easy drinker. Simple and flavorful, but redundant. A treat from time to time."
"Overall: Not That Bad. And much better than my expectations for it. It manages to pull off real blueberry character rather well in a beer that doesn't have a lot else in its make-up. It's not great, but it does a solid job given its genesis."

"O: A very nice blueberry ale. I'm not usually a fan of fruity ales, but blueberries are an exception when done right - and I think this comes close."

"Blue Paw Wheat Ale pours a crystal clear goldenrod. There's a wispy bit of white foam topping the beer, but it dissipates quickly. No sign of blueberry in the appearance. The nose has plenty of blueberry aroma, with a light bit of wheaty grain to keep things interesting. The flavor profile features the wheat a bit more, and the blueberry tastes very artificial. There's plenty of it there, but it noticeably comes across as being a bit fake. I'd be shocked if all the blueberry here come from anything besides some kind of extract or artificial flavor added right at the end of the brewing process. The mouthfeel is fairly decent, with just a little bit of fullness to the body and enough carbonation that the word ""sparkling"" comes to mind while drinking it. There's definitely an audience for Blue Dog Wheat Ale, but having had several beers brewed with real fruit, and made one of my own, something like this just doesn't cut it for me."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle, served in a Sam Adams Boston lager sensory glass."
""

"Overall a great introduction to craft beer for people. On the mark as a blueberry beer but can see how it may be overpowering for some."
"Overall: This one's worthy of a try, especially as Winter gives way to Spring. It's light and it's very tasty."

"Overall Impression- An easy drinking beer that was very light and almost Pilsner like all the way through. The blueberry aroma was nice and some of the taste but absolute downed this! Needed more body, carbonation, and more hops and other ingredient. Appreciated but there are many other fruit beers I would go for first!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I got this since I tried other blueberry beers and though with the reviews this was one of the better ones. More like blueberry syrup in a typical pale ale..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad at first, I had very low expectations and it wasn't too bad, a bit thin and watery, too syrupy, not much malt or wheat flavor, but blueberry is nice. Finish is a bit bitter and not so pleasant though."
""
""
""
"O - A solid blueberry ale. For the style, its light ABV and drinkability suit it well. The blueberry could be improved, but it was enjoyable and I would consider purchasing a six pack when the occasion calls."
"Body-Light, fizzy, drinkable, smooth, lightly dry finish. Good stuff, would get it again, not overly sweet and definitely worth the price."
"O: It's a little hard to review considering the fact that I love blueberries and I'm not offended by a beer that doesn't taste much like beer. In the end I think I could have them sparingly over the summer but not any more or during any other season. I couldn't imagine buying this for myself again though."
"This brew was one of the first fruit beers I remember having. I wasn't sure what to expect at first but I felt that it ended up being a good experience. The beer poured out as a golden color with a fluffy white head on top. The smell of the beer was pretty good, some nice blueberry sweetness on the nose with a wheat softness in there as well. The taste of the beer kind of reminded me of a blueberry muffin which I really enjoy. The mouthfeel was drinkable and soft. Overall not a bad beer at all."
"O: A solid blueberry beer that does a nice job balancing the blueberry and malts. Not too overpowering, yet it isn't so faint that you can barely taste the blueberries"
" It was altogether very disapointing and not a good example of the style. I had much higher expectations since I had enjoyed other blueberry beers."
"Great tasting fruit beer. Quickly is becoming one of my favorites."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good but really light on the blueberry flavor. I would drink it again though."
"Pours a clear orange with a 1 inch white head that fades to an oily film. Small spots of lacing slide back into the remaining beer on the drink down. The smell and taste of this beer is basically of whole wheat blueberry pancakes. A very bready/biscuit-like blueberry infused combo. Good carbonation level makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very tasty fruit beer that lives up to it's solid B average. I have had this one in the bottle and there is basically no variation from the smells and tastes that the beer has on tap. Good stuff."
"This is crisp and light and generally not a bad feel, but it gets a little flat and bland despite consistent carbonation; what starts as smoothness ends a little slick."
"O- This is a very good beer to mix things up, it's bluberry taste is balanced."
"I wouldn't grab another. It wasn't bad, just thin and plain."
"It works well to pair with hot weather. I may pick up a six pack to go down the shore."
"There is to much carbonation and the blueberry taste was kinda artificial, but I must say I really enjoyed the mixture of the wheat and blueberries."
"O - Really, this does not seem like too much of a beer buuut.... it does taste good. It feels like I could drink a hundred of these"
"all in all, this one delivers. hits a home run on the blueberry note, while stlll allowing the wheat notes to come through. one of the better overly fruit flavored brews out there."
"O-its definitely not a terrible beer. the taste of blue berries will stick with you for a long time. it didn't get worse as i drank it either. this is just a very average beer."
"Go Maine!"
"Poured a clear copper with no head, apart from a few lonely, scattered bubbles. Obvious blueberry aroma, and not a whole lot more going on. Kind of reminded me of some kind of candy I had as a kid...which one, I can't quite put my finger on. Light malty taste, with blueberry and more blueberry flavor going on, with the most subtle touch of orange zest. A little bitter from some floral-seeming hops, giving a dry and somewhat bland aftertaste. Wheaty, but not too harsh or acidic, which is good. Light body, and pretty easily drinkable, but perhaps a bit too fruity for some. But if you order a blueberry beer, it's presumable that you don't mind fruit beers."
"D-Overall this was very drinkable and even though i likeblueberry pop tarts i really don't want one with my beer. So overall it was good."
"O – A tasty brew I would buy in quantity for a summer event, very drinkable and sessionable 3.5"
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Golden color with a small white head that disappears almost immediately. Scent is of sweet blueberries and wheat but definitely more of the blueberries. Taste brings more blueberries, outweighing the wheat even more than in the scent. It's lightly carbonated and has a pretty light mouthfeel. Overall I'd say this is a decent fruit beer and one that I'll buy again if I'm in the mood for this style."
"O - This is a decent brew. I think it could be a bit more balanced. The sweetness is a bit much for me but tastes natural and not some additive. Not bad all together."
"It pours a light gold in color with a one finger dull white head. It's very light in body. It smells of fresh blueberry muffins, as in when you pull the muffins out of the oven and then open one up while it's still warm. It's pretty strong, but I dig it. The flavor reminds me of something. It's not baked goods, it's not real blueberries, it might be a blueberry candy. It could also be the berry flavor from Captain Crunch. It's tasty regardless. The beer is crazy thin, even for a wheat. It's drinkable though because it's very tasty and flavorful. I could probably drink a bunch of this. It's very sessionable. I like it enough."
"O: Not terrible, was worried by the nose but taste was fine. I am not a huge blueberry fan (a friend bought this) so I probably wont drink it again, but was worth drinking."
"So I am in New Hampshire for the Great Bay Half Marathon...its the night before a race and ....why not drink some....ok....alot of the local beer!!! Staying at teh local Holiday Inn and they have Sea Dog Blue Paw on tap. This beer has was a pale hazy yellow in color with thin white head and great lace. The smell was overpowering...I smelled it as soon as it was placed on the table!!! Just like blueberry pie!!! The beer has blueberry out the ass taste! The smell funnels into the taste of this beer. The light ABV leads to this beer being a Session...certainly worth a taste."
"For a hot summer day, I might buy it again. I've had better, but I've definitely had worse. Deserves a try."
"Pours a very clear, very lite golden-yellow. Head recedes to nothingness right away. Smell is thick with blueberries. Also, a bit of a paint thinner/alcohol aroma. Taste is mostly the fruit the beer is named by, tart and sweet. Decent wheaty goodness as well. A little sourness after the sip, but nothing distracting at all. Feel is carbonated. I might drink another."
"Drinkability: While it's certainly better than the apricot or raspberry, I have problems finishing this bottle. For me, the blueberry tastes too artificial and too powerful for the whole drink. I can see it being drinkable but I think the sweetness from the blueberry might be too much for some people."
"smells great. Smells of blueberries and light wheat. Tastes just as it smells. One of the few beers that do that. Mouthfeel is decent for such little head. I could drink this everyday all day."
"Poured a sparkling clear light amber with a small white head that was fully diminishing and had no lacing. The aroma was heavy of blueberry's and had a mild sweet yeast and a light bread malt scent. It tasted sweet with an abundance of blueberry's at first and finished lightly sweet of blueberrys and not much else with the flavor only lasting a very short time. Mouthfeel was extremely light in body and watery in texture and had a lively carbonation. Overall nothing more than a blueberry soft drink and not a good one at that."
"Served on-tap in a pint glass. The beer pours a hazy copper-gold color with a thin bead of white, foamy head. There is a heavy sweet blueberry nose, with toasted cereal characteristics. The blueberry smells are real fruit, too...not syrupy. The beer is semi-sweet, with blueberry and slight citrus flavors highlighting a toasted oat flavor in the forefront. The body also has some wheat characteristics. The body is very light and creamy smooth, yet crisp. The aftertaste is sweet and tart blueberry, with some cereal/oats characteristics, also. The finish follows suit with the fruity theme, but the general sweetness lingers a little bit longer, eventually giving a clean break on the palate. The sweetness makes this a low-number consumption beer, but great on a hot day."
"As I like beer with deeper tastes, I would definitely have more"
"Easy to drink. Maybe too easy with a nice carbonated mouthfeel."
"What I love most about Seadog Blueberry is that it is a great mixer...Black n Blue, Guiness n Seadog. The brew pubs that they are putting all over New England are only going to help the brand."
"D: Light, crisp, well balanced flavor at 4.6% make this a very good summer ""session"" wheat ale."
"I don't know that I'd want more than one of these - but that's fairly normal with a fruit beer."
"Smell is a faint fruit blueberry but some bread smell surprisingly as well. Nothing offensive. Taste comes through with a smooth watery chewy grain on the finish, making a nice beer like balance with the fruit. This isn't an overpowering fruit bomb which is why I seem to enjoy it. Quite pleasant and easy drinking and could have another it's a straightforward easy one and doesn't taste of fake fruit."
"A pale golden/amber ale with a nice head, but minimal lacing, Sea Dog opens with a delicious bouquet of fresh blueberries. I'm a big fan of blueberry, so I'm hoping the taste stays faithful. It's a mild, light flavor, with a pleasant (but not overpowering) blueberry taste. I'm glad this one tastes natural, without the weird syruppy artificial aftertaste of some blueberry beers I've had. A delightful drink."
"Reviewed on: 13/3/2010"
"D-I let it get warm because it was not the best."
"Pours a pale yellow colour with small head, no real lacing and head dies down fairly quickly. Smells of incredibly sweet blueberry, almost like a blueberry candy, with the faintest hint of wheat. Carbonation level is pretty good. I can see this being refreshing on a hot day, but it is much too sweet to have as a regular beer."
"D/M-If you like blueberries this is definitely the beer for you, Crazy how fruity this beer is, but very good tasting."
"Pours surprisingly clear--certainly a good hint that this isn't going to be he really tasty type of blueberry beer. Light head. The smell isn't too artificial, bringing forward some straight blueberry notes without much else. The taste might add a bit of malt sweetness, although blueberry is about it. This doesn't taste too artificial and is actually fairly refreshing."
"I poured it into a glass and the first thing I noticed as that it didn't look like a typical wheat beer: Extraordinarily clear in the glass with little to no head. Its all blueberries on the nose but it drinks like biting into a moist blueberry muffin, one of those superbly moist well preserved mass-produced muffins that you can't get enough of. I was very happy to find that it didn't have a syrupy mouthfeel or a sticky-sweet finish like some other fruity wheat beers."
"If you like blueberries, you'll love this beer. Pretty good for the style."
"D: I Like, this one is just creamy nice, a bit watery so I could pound this one and enjoy the fruity flavors in a BEER!!!"
"D: I really enjoyed this light wheat beer with the subtle extra taste of blueberry fruit. Yum."
"D: Definetly drinkable, i'm not sure I would want to drink more than one or two at a time, but nevertheless a good beer to have every now and then."
"I wonder how much this goes for anywhere other than the cape because I'm sure those prices are jacked up quite a bit."
"Notes: Best before Nov. 10. Not too bad for a fruit beer with realistic blueberry flavor and a good amount of wheat flavor and bready taste. Reminds me a bit of blueberry muffins. Overall a pretty good beer, especially if you want a blueberry taste."
"have revisited this several times, and having for some reason been on a fruit beer kick of late, more and more i think they nailed this one. the pale biscuity malts showcase the blueberry well, and it's as much like blueberry pie as i suppose a beer could be, without being cloying."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, i couldn't stop and the next thing i knew it I was out of beer..."
"Strange thing is, though it drinks a bit like if it was a notch or two above a Bud Light with blueberry, just a little less watery, it goes down great and was a perfect breakfast beer with the chicken and waffles. I'm not saying it's not enjoyable on its own or that it should be had only with greasy food. Best for me that way. It's tasty and, for what it is, has mass appeal."
"Appearance of this beer had typical ale qualities, such as dark amber color and medium brownish head. The smell and taste of this beer, however, make it a winner. The blueberry presence wasn't overpowering in those categories; I felt there was a right amount of them put into this beer. It was a very sweet aroma and taste. Usually, I am not a huge fan of fruit beers or recommend drinking them on a regular basis. While I stand by my belief on the latter, I can make an exception on the former in regards to this particular brew. It's good enough to be considered worthy and/or given a try."
"Decent overall, not too sweet like some fruit beers can be."
"The flavor isn't what I had expected or hoped. Blueberry tastes artificial and weak. It's there, but it's a little sour and fake-tasting. Some light honey tones noted as well. Bitterness is low. Comparing this to Sweetwater's version, this gets blown out of the water, and that beer isn't spectacular or anything. It's interesting, but nothing I would run out to get."
"Back to the ""this batch"" comment; All of these fruit beers that are mass produced come with a considerable 'inconsistency' factor. Usually, this is the best blueberry ale that I have had in recent years. Atlantic Brewing used to have the best 'Blueberry Ale' when it was actually brewed in Bar Harbour, Maine, but now that it has reappeared in recent years, I believe it has lost it's quality through the contract brewing process. Sea Dog still gets my vote for best blueberry available today, especially since they brew it in Maine and get those blueberries fresh."
"Drinkable if offered to me, but wouldn't be my first choice."
"d - My girlfriend bought a 6er of this so I decide to try one and was pleasantly surprised. This is one of the better ""fruity"" beers I've had and if you like blueberries you'll probably love this. Very easy to drink and worth a shot."
"D: Somewhat of interesting novelty type beer, but I'm not sure I'd want more than a glass of one."
"I could smell this beer and be happy, but drinking more than one is not going to happen. There are better fruit beers out there."
"I had this on tap in Celebration, FL. I actually found it to be a nice beer. I enjoyed my first glass and it was gone before I even knew it. The only downside to this beer is the mouthfeel. It was a little to ""Carbonated"" for my taste. but the smeel and drinkability were way up there, and I got a 2nd glass."
"Pours a light clear yellow with little head and no lacing. The aroma is of blueberries, very sweet smell but not too sweet or over powering. The taste has a hint of a grain backbone, and it is blueberries all over other than that hint. A little artificial in taste. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, and light in texture. Overall its an above average drinkable beer. It is nice and smooth, but the artificial blueberry keeps it from being great."
"D- This is a beer that I would have if someone brought it over...nothing I would go out and buy myself unless I'm drinking with people who are not into craft beer. It has a high drinkability but not something that I would want to drink a ton of."
"I love this beer. It's not something I would drink a lot of since it is so flavorful, but I enjoy every drop when I order it. It is exactly what it says it is, a wheat ale with a blueberry flavor. So many flavored beers are not flavored enough, or are over flavored. This has the perfect blend."
"Drinkability: Snoozers. Blue Paw is a truly lackluster base beer dosed with blueberry flavoring. From time to time, I do enjoy a quality wheat ale or fruit beer. Sadly, this one is neither."
"D – One of the most palatable widely-available fruit beers, IMO. In the same vein as Shipyard Pumpkinhead or Magic Hat #9. Way better on-tap."
"Blueberry, that's what this beer is. The aroma is overwhelmingly blueberry with some malt. It starts sweet and becomes a blueberry flavor. There is no bitterness and finishes slightly dry. This is very drinkable if you like blueberry and don't like beer taste you'll like this."
"D: Something fun and different to bring to a BBQ. It is refreshing and quenching. There is an ok beer underneath the berries and it avoids the cloying syrupiness with which some fruit beers offend. Just a touch fizzy which is alright for a summer wheat beer, but it would be nice to get some more wheat twang."
"Thin head, even with an aggressive finish to the pour, leaves tiny islands across the surface and virtually no lacing. Golden straw color of moderate depth, however, remains mostly transparent, plenty of active bubbles visible. Without a doubt, the blueberry scents the major player in the nose, the wheat and grains obvious as well, smidge of lemon citrus as well as malted milk balls, difficult to find a great deal of breadth when you can smell the blueberries three feet away from the glass. Light to medium-bodied, crisp and heavily carbonated, not very sweet even taking into account the bodacious blueberry presence. The wheat and general hoppiness not out to zing you, relatively soft contours to it. The citrus offers mute lemon and orange flavors. Sip after sip, there's just not much more to say. It is labeled as a blueberry wheat beer and that is exactly what it tastes like."
"The appearance I a light golden color didn't have a lot of head but a nice thin lace around edge of glass. A very inviting aroma of fresh picked blueberries. Great light refreshing taste of wheat and blueberries that are inviting. Have a great mouth feel with a little carbonation to it. I would drink it again."
"Overall, a very solid beer in the 'fruity' beers category. I think the bad smell was a single beer thing, not a whole production thing. Despite the off-stench in the nose, I liked every other part of this beer."
"D: Very sweet beer, lots of sugar and blueberry. For me, it is a one and done. It was not a bad brew by any means, just not what I enjoy."
"D: I'll admit I was expecting something a bit different and was pleasantly surprised this brew wasn't overly sweet. I wouldn't reach for a beer like Blue Paw on a regular basis, but it's definitely enjoyable when in the mood for something a little different."
"Light golden colour with little to no head. Smells of sweet blueberries, but somewhat artificial. Tastes like a liquid blueberry pie. Almost too sweet, and very carbonated, but still a wonderful taste. Feels a slight bit light and watery but not too bad at all. Goes down very smooth, and leaves a nice berry aftertaste."
"Very smooth with the taste of the blueberries lingering on your tongue. Crisp and refreshing any time of the year."
"Drinkability is decent, if you like berries and not much else. Might be too sweet for more than one for me though. Worth the taste, but I was quite underwhelmed."
"I like blueberries. I like beer. But, for some reason I just can't drink too much of this. Not my favorite fruit beer, but not bad. Don't get me wrong, I'll drink it again, especially with some fresh blueberries."
"Overall, a pretty good blueberry beer. Maybe not the greatest I have tasted, but certainly not the worst."
"D: A pretty good summer beer, here. Not sure I could put back a lot of any type of fruit beer, but this is definitely one of the better blueberry ales I've had."
"~Neko"
"D- Sessionable, moderate to through the roof depending on your love for blueberry beer. For the same $$$, I'd rather go grab Newport Storm's Rhode Island Blueberry... by far my favorite blueberry beer. Still, if it's a hot day and you want to cool off and take a breather, this beer fits the bill amply."
"D- Light body and high carbonation makes this a good drinker. The taste holds it back a little, however. If you like wheat beers more than I do, then you might enjoy this. I would prefer a little less carbonation and a bit more synthesis of flavor."
"If ever there was a beer to drink with a fruit pie, this might be it! Highly drinkable."
"D-Smooth, clean and delicious and easy to have multiple pints or bottles."
"It is highly refreshing in your mouth and it is highly drinkable. I liked it very much and I am going to see if I can get a case of it at my Beer Distributer for some pleasant Summer Drinking."
"A basic Blonde Ale with ample fruitiness and an added blueberry punch. Though the fruits do as promised, the base beer falls short."
"D - Easy drinking beer that is exactly what a fruit beer should be."
"12oz brown bottle obtained at McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a translucent golden body with about a half inch of short-lived off-white head. Smells strongly like blueberry sweetness, almost syrupy... Tastes fruity (blueberry), but is not as sweet as I expected it to be. Husky grain/wheat flavor shares an equal portion of the flavor. A dry blueberry quality dominates the aftertaste. Moderate mouthfeel with light carbonation. Very drinkable. Not the best example of the style that I've tried, but for the price you can't beat it."
"D- i suppose if you are into sweet beers, you could drink a lot of these, there is definately a moderation exercised here, but after a few, i personally have had all the fruit in my brew that i can handle. Overall a decent brew. Would have again if i was just going to have 1 or 2 to top the night."
"Bottle Pours a clear golden yellow with a big fizzy white head. As soon as you open the bottle the aroma of blueberry muffin hits you. Has a strong stale blueberry aroma. Hints of alcohol, and feet. Flavor is of harsh blueberry. No real depth here. Weak finish. High carbination. Has okay wheat tones but not great. This one misses for me but its not awful."
"Very refreshing, however very sweet and candy-like. Maybe okay for a blueberry-lover, but perhaps not for me."
"I probably should have tried this beer at the beginning of the week when temperatures were in the eighties as opposed to the forties. That said, this wouldn't be a bad beer in warmer temperatures, but it's not something I'll keep on hand."
"D - This is very easy to drink. Again, not very beer-like but it tastes good."
"Drinkability: This to me is the standard bearer of blueberry beer...If I have a fruit beer, I want to be able to taste the fruit it represents. For the style I believe this is the best at what it does..While it is sweet, I can drink this year round for a nice dessert beer or a session beer...I like it and think it is one of the best fruit beers I have had...For as much as I like it in a bottle as I had it for this review I love it on tap more."
"Overall: While not cloyingly sweet, a little too sweet and tart to be a session beer, but a good desert beer."
"Drinkability: Goes down easily -> I would suggest this beer as a summertime cooler. Easy drinking and very simple. I found it to be a little fruity, sugary, sweet for my taste, but I could see how these could disappear very quickly. They are extremely light and refreshing."
"Tap @ The Bell In Hand. Smells and tastes like blueberry cake with powdered sugar. Pours gold with a little white head. The wheat back does come through on this beer, which is nice, but the blueberries make it just too sweet. At the same time, it is nice to have a fruit beer that has real beer flavor in it."
"Also try a black and blue(blueberry layered with stout)"
"Easy to quaff and has a great aroma. You will burping blueberry for a couple hours after this one. Very drinkable and the blueberry taste is not overwhelming. Mine appears to be out of date, but no ill-effects were noticed upon consumption. I was happy with this selection because it was rather light - would be good for a summer drink. Not too heavy and certainly not an amber - much more pilsner-like in appearance. I'm not a big fan of blueberries (although I do like fruit beers) and this one certainly made the cut. Worth trying if you are a fan of the variety, and I think this is much better than the A-B concoction."
"12 fl. oz. bottle, bought at the GBBF 2008 for takeaway. ABV is not stated on the bottle, but the festival programme says it's 4.8%. Crystal clear deep golden to amber colour, moderate head, fizzy. Distinct aroma of blueberries and raspberries, also notes of candy with said artifical flavourings. Thin mouthfeel. The flavour is wheaty with notes of blueberries, otherwise fairly bland with minimal hops. Not very sweet. Drinkable, but not very exciting."
"Drinkability: As harsh as it sounded like I rated it I liked it."
"The best I've had from Sea Dog, which isn't saying much when you look at their other offerings but this one I would come back to. This is a pretty good fruit beer, it may be a tad overkill with the blueberry taste and aroma but I thought it was tasty and drinkable."
"Is this a beer? Enough said..."
"This is my first shot at a review after lurking for some time on BA and drinking a wide selection of beers for years. I hope I start reviewing more. :)"
"This beer was easy enough to drink, though I doubt I would have more than a couple at a session (but I am not a gigantic fan of ""flavored"" beers, so I am biased). It was nice to have on a warm summer night, and I would imagine the addition of fresh blueberries would add another level of enjoyment. Overall a good blueberry beer, as blueberry beers go."
"Good lawnmower or beach stuff. A sentimental favorite from a Maine camping trip/excursion a ways back; didn't disappoint for the style."
"My description is weird I know, but just try it for yourself and maybe you'll see what I'm saying, or just think I'm an idiot."
"D: Definitely drinkable, one of the better fruit beers I've had. Definitely recommended."
"D: This has the potential to be a session ale. The blueberry is an acquired taste though, so it may not be for everyone."
"The feel is the worst part of this beer with a sharpness to the bubbles that is a little off-putting. Plus it increases the feeling of fullness. Otherwise this is a fine enough drinking beer suitable for the warm weather pending."
"Not good. Its a beer, but it tastes unbalanced and feels watery. I might want an MGD before I have this one again. Blueberry flavor is so sticky that it isn't even that refreshing."
"D: Very drinkable...it's tough to stop at just one. An excellent fruit beer simply because the fruit is not poorly represented (which seems to happen more times than not). It has a very true flavor...spot on ripe wild blueberry. If that is what you want, this beer will give it to you."
"Have had this in both bottle and draft form, and the draft seems to be a little crisper and straightforward (I guess that is a bad thing if you like a more wholesome mouthfeel w/ a creamier edge). A seethru brew of a dark gold color, this beer has a very good blueberry smell to it, not faint at all. I liken the taste to a blueberry pancake, not much else to it. Goes down real smooth, and these are nice to have once in a while."
"This beer is a little different from the norm. I was expecting something like the Sweetwater Blue, but this tastes more like a blueberry muffin. It pours up light, and is def different to the pallet. I enjoyed the beer, but not something i could drink on a regular basis. This however is my girlfriend's favorite beer, and would prob be good to consider a ""Chick beer"""
"Nice rich golden color, with a bit of white head. Smell is almost exclusively blueberries and a light metallic smell as well. Crisp taste, but watery and very lightly flavored. Noticeable blueberry taste, but also a bit cardboardy/bland. Perhaps it wasn't the freshest... Not good but drinkable."
"Let it warm a bit in these cold winter months, and serve it icy in the summer. I generally don't like fruit/veggie beers, but this one from Sea Dog is a nice, relaxed offering of the style."
"A sweet flavor that is contrasted nicely with a pleasant nuttiness. The finish is vaguely reminiscent of breakfast cereal. Overall, not the best blueberry ale I've had, but far, far from the worst, either. Worth a go."
"Had this one at the Pub in Amherst. It poured out with a light, murky gold appearance; pretty thin head. I smelled the great fragrances of crisp, strong blueberries that definitely increased anticipation. Finally, when I sipped the drink I was amazed: sharp, sharp blueberry that was very excellent. A pretty good carbonation helped make it light and refreshing. Overall, an excellent ale."
"This is a fairly light ale but still has good amount of flavor. Also the blueberry flavor is not too strong which sometimes can be a problem."
"D- I could drink a six pack of these with ease. It is a bit sicky sweet if you have too many, but fortunately (or unfortunately) the alcohol content is low (4.6%) and you won't get wrecked in the process."
"Pours a clear amber that seems to have just a little touch of pinkish to it (from the blueberry I am guessing). Nose is like a basket of blueberries and not much else really able to immediately overpower that. Flavor is like dirty blueberries in the midst of an ale. Hardly clean at all. Bitter and almost a slight metallic edge to it. No strong wheat characteristics to it at all. Feel is like standard beer with just a little more bubble perhaps. I can't say it is overly drinkable due to it's lack of grace or any smooth qualities whatsoever. I love blueberries, but this is not something I really enjoyed or would go hunt out again. For me as a blueberry lover, it's hardly worth going back to...or even trying in the first place."
"Drinkability: This is one of my favorite beers when I'm looking for something sweet and that has no subtly."
"This beer pours a clear pale orange color. The head is two inches in height, but recedes quickly into thin lacing. The aroma is of blueberries with a wheaty twang, but is rather faint. The taste has a little more blueberry than the aroma, but is still quite bland. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is like all too many other fruity American wheat beers; it is boring and mundane. I will not drink this again."
"overall - i'd buy it again. i see this as a beer to break people out of some of their preconceptions of what sort of flavors can be in a beer or also for women or people who just love a blueberry flavor. i'll definately be buying again given the right circumstances."
"D: I could put a few back. Good lawnmower beer."
"After its release from the 12 ounce bottle the beer show a slightly cloudy gold with a modest white creamy head that fades away leaving the lace a fine covering sheet on the glass. Nose has a nice fruity aroma backed by the malt, start has a light grain profile, sweet and appetizing, top is light to moderate in feel to the palate. Finish has a fair to middling acidity, the hops light in their spiciness, sweet and dry, drinkable, a good picnic beer."
"Normal wheat beer appearance, golden with nothing out of the ordinary. A bit of head and not a lot of lacing. It has a wonderful blueberry scent, but unfortunately the blueberry also overrides the wheat beer taste. It goes down fine, but the aftertaste is also strongly blueberry. If you've ever had Booberry cereal, imagine it with wheat beer instead of milk. It's exactly as good or as nasty as that sounds."
"Drinkability: Very high score here. This is one of my favorite fruit wheat beers, and the low ABV means you can drink quite a few in an evening. Highly recommended, and one of the better values out there."
"D: A little tasty, doesn't go down very easily, not filling at all, decent representation of style, even thought this may not be a particularly bad beer, it just isn't the kind of beer I like very much. However, it's comparable with the majority of blueberry beers that I've had."
"This beer is one for the ages, if you like fruity beers that taste like the fruit. The fruit taste is very powerful and you can tell from when you first pour it because it smells like blueberry. It is a very sweet wheat beer that makes it very drinkable and very refreshing. Since the blueberry is so present in the smell and taste, it is a seriously fruity beer that even your 8yr old daughter would enjoy."
"Overall Impression: A nice fruit beer with a little flaw. Its not so bad that Im not enjoying the beer, but it is noticeable. Worth a shot."
"D- The best blueberry beer I have tried ( my friend is always buying fruity beers for me to try and most fall short). I will retire this beer for the season and look forward to its taste next summer."
"Every year, I inevitably end up with a ""beer of the summer"" that just stands out, and this year it was Sea Dog Blue Paw. A very drinkable and refreshing beer with only slight undertones of blueberry in smell and finish. A very nice straw color adds to the overall appreciation. Not overly fruity, as some fruit flavored wheats I've sampled. Overall, the blueberry flavor is very nicely integrated into the brew."
"Im not a real fan of fruit beers, but the mixture of the fruit and the wheat was heads and tails above some others blueberry beers Ive had (like Sweetwater Blue), and this was actually a very enjoyable beer, given the style."
"That said, I echo the guy below who wishes there was such thing as a Blueberry Lambic!"
"This wheat ale had a very light mouth feel, making it a great summer or session option. This beer paired great with grilled western style burgers (BBQ sauce, cheddar, onion rings etc... )and BBQ chicken. Don't think for a second though, that this beer won't make a Sunday morning football breakfast or two. Some scrambled eggs with cream cheese and chives, sliced ham, and a blueberry brew. Enjoy."
"Overall: This is my first blueberry beer, and I have to admit I quite enjoyed it. I don't think I could drink a lot of these, but one or two at the end of a hot day sure hits the spot nicely. The aroma is fantastic. Everybody should give this one a try."
"Don't drink and review."
"I don't think I could handle more than one of these. Too, too sweet."
"The taste on first sip has a nice semi sweet blueberry flavour that nicely compliments the flavour of wheat. I'm also getting some earthy notes and the finish ends up a bit on the watery side. Not bad but I was hoping for a more pronounced blueberry flavour. I wish there was such a thing as a Blueberry Lambic but I'd buy this again."
"Overcarbonated and artificial in flavor. It's tough to make a decent fruit/veg-based ale, and Sea Dog proves it."
"Notes: Just ok to me across the board. It was light, fresh, interesting, and full of flavor. Hmmm judging by that description it was better than OK."
"M - Thin, crisp, quenching, and a bit watery."
"Wow--if you like blueberries, this is your beer! What a wonderful blueberry aroma this beer has! It looks like a typical ale, and has virtually no head. It appears to be highly carbonated, but it could be due to the age of the six pack I received. There isn't much body to this beer, but that just leaves more room for that blueberry flavor. I taste a bit of hops for bittering, but virtually no hop flavor is detectable (they could be there, but is overshadowed by the blueberries). This is a great sipping beer for the summertime while eating fruits on the back porch."
"Blueberry! This beer poured a clear pale golden color. The head was decent, but not long lasting. The blueberry aroma hit you as soon as the bottle was opened. The taste is fruity (blueberry) and slightly malty. The mouthfeel is thin and carbonated. This would be drinkable if you enjoyed carbonated blueberries."
" It looks a bit macro; just a clear pale yellow brew with a thin white head that quickly fades. Smells like sweet blueberries, yeast, and wheat. Tastes like wheat and blueberry gummi-worms, with slight malt. Kinda reminds me of franken-berry cereal in beer form. Interesting, to say the least. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but the drinkability is surprisingly high. I could kick back and have a few of these on the front porch on a nice summer evening."
"Poured a nice white head - golden color- smelled of sweet blueberry but not overly done - excellent scent. Tastes wheat in front moving to blueberry and staying a mostly blueberry taste. I was impressed by this one compared to some other berry Ales that Ive had - I think its a good blend of the tastes - pretty much what I would ask for in a fruit beer - not to much fruit and not to little.. This is a very drinkable beer -albeit more of a warm weather brew in my opinion.. I will be looking for this one in the summer months in bottles to see if it as good bottled."
"D - Some may find it too sweet, but I like it just fine. It's refreshing and would be a great choice for a breezy spring or summer day."
"Bouncy, fizzy feel. Deceptively thick-feeling considering it's a light and wheaty concoction. It's a very good brew, probably best for summer. (I had it on a freezing winter night.) Goes down smooth but with a nice, mild bite."
"Appears a pale golden tone with a quickly dwindling white head leaves minimal lacing. Aromatics it has a tart blueberry with sharpe wheat accents kinda a dry woody tone as weell. Flavor not overly sweet with the blueberry, a nice balance of sharp acidic wheat notes and mild blueberry flavor not like the common alco pop versions that are always at brewpubs. Mouthfeel is light body evenly carbonated easy drinking summer time feel. Drinkability not one I would drink in number but not a bad version very solid for the style."
"D - The first time I had a blueberry ale it was on tap and it was with real blueberries. Pur yourself a glass of this with real blueberries, just don't do it around the guys.LOL. Best ale I have had out of the 3 that I have tried."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow , with a medium white head - nose of blueberry muffins , raspberry syrup , and lightly hopped  taste of blueberry muffins , yeast , light malts and light hopps - body thin but creamy , and lightly carbonated  aftertaste of blueberry muffins , and slightly acidic not a great beer but it is good for a blueberry beer"
"I poured this one into my glass not expecting much. It was a dark golden yellow with no head and little carbonation. I actually enjoyed this brew very much. It had a nice smell and taste of blueberries. The blueberries did not seem to be too artifical and not overly sweet. I would definetly go for this one again in the future."
"D: Not bad, I suppose. If I wanted a blueberry beer, this would be my first choice. Or I could just eat a blueberry and slam a lager, and get a similar effect. Nonetheless, it's what it says it is, and isn't disgustingly repulsive. Worth trying. But keep it away from your kids, it would likely remind them of Trix."
"Tastes just like it smells with a bit of a sour aftertaste resembling yeast and malt. Not bad. Not very good, but not bad."
"Nothing more I can say about this except that it won't gag you. No reason to really seek this beer out at all."
"D: I'll take water instead, thanks."
"Mouthfeel is reminiscent of soda water. Way too effervescent. This beer was way too fakely sweet. Could barely share a bottle with a friend. Blecch."
"B'ham UK (written while in Tampa FL Oct 2006)"
"A very strange combination to me, but i suppose they get what they are seeking. To me it is too much like an alcopop."
"Again, this one is super refreshing. Great beer for a hot afternoon. I picked up a sixer at Trader Joes to help rally the Dodgers in the '06 playoffs (Go Blue!)... no luck there, but I still enjoyed the beer."
"Drinkability - Of all the fruit beers I have tried, this one stands out as one of the best IMO. I'm not a big fan of wheat beers, but the blueberry flavoring, easily makes this one, very enjoyable. Not exactly one that I would drink a six pack of in one sitting, but one that I would enjoy after a meal, or maybe during a session, for a little change of flavor."
"Subtle it was not, it was like drinking warm blueberry muffins, or pankakes at ihop."
"Drinkability - drank about half and walked away to do something else. Was OK, but would not run out to buy more."
"D- cant say I really care for this one, a good idea, just not made very well, probly wouldn't drink again"
"Its hard to describe the taste of the beer as the blueberry syrup seems to overpower anything else. There is some carbonation which helps if you think of it more as a blueberry soda, that kinda tastes weird. As a beer though its terrible. I'm not sure about the wheat part, if its there the fruit has gobbled it up. It was difficult to finish. No thanks."
"I doubt I'd buy this again. Just way too sweet for my tastes."
"A must try for those just starting to try fruit beers..."
"Tasted: 09/07/06"
"Its an amber color that has zero head. I bet you can guess what it smells like! Its more of a blueberry muffin aroma since its full on the sweet tip and that goes for the taste too. Before I knew it, I did drink the entire contents but that might be more to the credit of Monday Night Football being on and thats drinking time."
"I must say I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. Although its not a style I come back to with great regularity, this makes for a very refreshing beverage, especially since Seadog chose to take the Dogfish route & make the fruit implied instead of essentially making blueberry juice & beer (like they did with the hazelnut in their porter, yuck). An exceptionally easy beer to drink & when next summer rolls around Ill be sure to keep a few bottles of this handy."
"Light body and no noticable alcohol make this a hot summer drinker that goes down easily."
"Definitely one of my top blueberry beers. Pours a light golden with a small head that didn't stick around too long. Smells of sweet blueberries that mirrored the taste. Goes down smoothly with a wheat aftertaste that lingers for a little while. Very drinkable for a sweet, fruit beer."
"Pours a pale golden color with little head. Aroma is blueberries with a bit of grain in the background. Taste is all about blueberries as well with a nice twang from the malt. The blueberry flavor does not overwhelm the beer, and it doesn't suffer from being cloyingly sweet. All in all, a pretty decent brew that's refreshing on a hot day."
"I first had this blueberry elixir when I went camping with my buddys in Georgia. I don't mind a sweet beer which is what it exactly was. Like a liquid blueberry muffin, it was smooth and refreshing. I ended up drink about ten with a bunch of other ones because they were so good."
"Drinkability - In my opinion, the best blueberry beer around. Nicely balanced with a soft fade at the end. Not a bite around! I would indeed order another."
"Going from great aroma to average taste. What a let down. A sweet blueberry taste but watered down (over filtered?). Can taste the wheat. Good clean carbonation. It says on the label ""wheat ale with natural flavors"". ""Natural flavors""? Why not say blueberries? I am a bit suspicious..."
"I had this last night in a bottle, poured nice and golden. The aroma is fabulous, just like blueberry muffins. It was a good beer for a summer night, light and crisp. It was a subtle blueberry taste and it lingers. I will definitely have it again before winter comes."
"Drinkability is OK. If I liked this sort of thing, I'm sure I would have several in a session on a hot day."
"Overall this is a solid fruit brew that is worth a few."
"Drinkability: Good, not great. An interesting beer for a summer's night."
"It is what it is...a blueberry wheat big on the blueberries...for the style it is pretty good...would not want to drink a lot of these but if I wanted a blueberry flavored wheat this is one I would look for.."
"DK: Solid blueberry brew. The only one better off the top of my head was the Town Hall version. But this is quite sound."
"A very different beer and worth a try if you are interested in Fruit Beers or like blueberries."
"Pours a filtered gold color with a quickly dissapearing lace. Aroma is kind of an artificially produced blueberry smell. My first thought when smelling this was that it reminded me of the flavored smelling markers that I grew up with as a kid. Tastes very similar to a blueberry muffin actually. I cannot see myself drinking more than a couple of these. Overall, this is not a bad brew. I think it would go great with a blueberry muffin. Definately worth a try."
"the blueberry in this brew gets cloying after awhile, limiting drinkability."
"This beer is way too sweet from my taste, almost wine cooler sweet. It was disappointing, as I've had blueberry wheats at beer festivals that I really liked, and would prefer over this one. However, my wife loved it."
"Overall a light and refreshing blueberry beer - highly drinkable. Floating a few blueberries in this beer really enhances the fruit flavor. I think this tops the Marin Bluebeery offering - with a more natural and subtle flavor. I like it."
"This might be okay if you are looking for a blueberry taste on a hot day. It seems more like a summer-release beer than a year-round-release beer."
"D - Very drinkable mainly due to sweetness (I've got a sweettooth) and smoothness. Good desert beer for the summer!"
"Poured a dark blonde leaving a thin white lace with heavy carbonation bubbles in the body. The nose is obviously blueberries, with small wheat, bready, grassy, notes. The taste is blueberry a little musty with a nice wheat twang to spice up this nominal brew. The finish is smooth, very drinkable but nothing exciting and probably will not go back to this brew except on a hot summer day."
"Sea Dog Blue Paw Wheat Ale pours a yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. This beer definitely smells like blueberry. Taste is actually better than I expected. A rush of blueberry followed quickly by wheat. It's not too sweet, I was afraid this was going to taste like bubblegum. Not bad, it's not really my thing, but possibly a good beer to introduce non craft beer drinkers to."
"Blue Paw pours a yellowy or light orange color. It is clear, with a decent sized, but quickly dissolving, white head. Smell is a good mix of wheat and blueberry up front. Very clean and crisp in the nose. The taste is also dominated by wheat presence right away. Blueberry is not as potent up front, but becomes more notable as the beer warms. The flavor is a bit watery, but pleasant and refreshing. In the mouth, this beer is pretty liight and somewhat fizzy. It does have a decent crisp presence though. Overall, I would say this is a pretty decent though not earth-shattering effort. Would be refershing on a warm summer's day, but no more so than dozens of other comprable or better beers."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Drinkability: A decent fruit beer for those who enjoy the style; very drinkable"
"The bottom line: a fairly average wheat beer with blueberry tones to spruce it up slightly. Nothing worth seeking out."
"It pours light and translucent a yellowish gold color and it definitely smells of blueberries, with a somewhat hoppy smell as well. There is a pale off white colored head. The blueberry flavor is just a little sweet (perhaps too sweet for some, but that's why I like it!). I guess it sort of comes off tasting like a light beer but with the blueberry flavor. It feels smooth in your mouth and it goes down smoothly as well - it is a fast drink. It's cool and refreshing and now that it is getting warmer out I will likely enjoy it on a hot summer day."
"The body was light. Overall the smell said big blueberries but the flavor didnt come through. I would suggest to keep fishing, but the girlfriend enjoyed it."
"Overall, I think I liked this a little better when it was a popular cereal, but, as it is, it isn't too bad for an experimental fruit beer."
"Had off tap at Coles, in Buffalo. Pours with (if nothing else, below) average appearence, not much head, stale gold in colour. Aroma of blueberry hit me from across the table, all of us around the table could honestly all smell it. Very clear, bright smell - blueberries! Both the aroma and flavour were very authentic. No sythentic or syrop detected, true blueberry profile. For sure they must add them to the mash. Left me with the taste of blueberry pancakes/muffins all day. Mouthfeel with a lot of barnyard/farmhouse presence, slightly dry and perhaps a little musty. Not ""fruity"" in the sense of fruit-lambics, nothing ""fruit juicy"" about it. It smells like blueberries before, and taste like blueberries after - but the whole middle part is beer."
"Drinkability: Not sure I could finish off a sixer, just get sick of the blueberry taste. Split a six-pack with the old lady is just perfect."
"Pretty easy to drink if you can get past the sweetness. Works well as breakfast or dessert beer. Fruitty beer lovers will enjoy this"
"D - It isn't hard to drink. The flavor isn't strong so it could even be sessioned. All around bland and uninspired. Well maybe it was inspired by instant blueberry pancakes."
"App: Pours out as a medium golden, almost light copper color body, with just a minimal white head forming. The nose reaches out with very fresh blueberry greeting. Just barely hazy with a little bubbly. Sm: Well.. fresh blueberries, really nice effect. Also some toasty cereal-wheat aroma. Ta/Mf: The balance of sweet fruit and wheat ale is wonderful. So often a wheat ale fusion like this doesn't work out that this is a very welcome surprise. Da: High. This would be a good dessert beer, but it would also have enough yarbles to be a session ale as well."
"mouthfeel is nice and light. highly carbonated. easily drinkable but very sweet"
"-SS"
"Something different, though not anything I'd buy on a regular basis."
"Very drinkable. Great blueberry flavor and easy drinking. Could use more complexity as a beer, but makes for a nice fruit beer."
"D- I could drink lots of this. I found it refreshing and would definitely drink it again."
"Pours a very pale yellowish amber. Big blueberry nose, with a very sweet undertone -- kind of smells like those fake blueberries-in-syrup that you get in a can. The palate is balanced with a semi-sweet blueberry flavor acting against a bitter hop character. The balance works pretty well, but there's too much of a syrupy after-effect in the mouthfell -- it's kind of thick and phlegmy in the throat. Still, overall this is an OK fruit beer. Not my favorite style of beer, though, so I can't say I recommend it."
"Overall, not much of a beer. It'd be okay to drink a few on a hot summer day, but I don't think it has that much more to offer."
"SDBCBPWBWA is a pretty good version of the style that needs to be slightly more flavorful and a tad less fizzilicious. It can't hold a candle to my favorite blueberry ale (from another Maine brewer, Atlantic Brewing Company), but it's still a worthwhile brew that would be a good summertime quencher if I lived in the Pine Tree State."
"Its like a cheap lager with way too much blueberry smell. The weird thing is the smell is way stronger than the taste. Not a huge fan of this but it might be good for someone graduating from the college crowd to something resembling a well crafted beer."
"I've had one other blueberry beer and that was delicious, something I would buy again for an evening to waste away on the porch in summer. But this beer gets a big thumbs down. Will never buy this brew again."
"I really think that this is an average beer, but it is certainly unique. It is definitely worth a try, but like many other flavored beer I find it hard to drink even an entire glass of this unless I think ""wine cooler"" instead of beer. I like beer to taste like beer, but this is certainly a fun one to taste."
"I Drink these straight from the bottle, but if poured into a glass it pours a clear yellow with a nice white head . A strong blueberry scent goes hand in hand with the great taste of the blueberries in this beer. Mouthfeel is a little to light by my standards but still should be tried at least once do to it's great blueberry taste, that is leftover at the finish . This is a great summer beer, that I recomend to any fan of fruit beers."
"Opened up this wheaty-micro from Bangor,and immediatly smelled much Maine wild blueberry. Poured in a pilsner> glass, it was a nice clear, light, gold color with a thin disipating head. A fine head was maintained ,with a medium carbonation rate. Taken to the nose , very floral hops and strong presense of definate blueberry. Smelled like it could be a breakfast cereal. Blue , flowery taste, with light maltiness. Medium bubbly mothfeel. I found This Sea Dog to be very drinkable although i would not drink many as im not really into the fruity ales. Of the ones i've had its the best. At 4.6- 4.95 ABV , normal pleasant effect to the brain and senses was achieved."
"Pours a copper golden color with no head. Smells of BLUEBERRIES right from the start, also a hint of maltyness. Strong taste of blueberries--very sweet. Being a wheat blueberry ale, I think this beer is very drinkable but I don't think I could drink a bunch of these. Not bitter, but smooth and leaves a nice aftertaste in your mouth."
"Pretty average, even for a fruit beer. A bit too ""artificial"" and one dimentional."
"This pours a light golden color with a small airy head. The aroma is pretty nice with an buttload of blueberrys and fruit flavors. The taste is similar, but of artificial blueberry flavors. Also there is the wheat but not as much as i would have liked. Light malt flavors. This is an oversweet ale that is fairly drinkable."
"The color is lighter than I like and the head was pretty small.This has a full blueberry aroma,it will fill your whole house.If you like blueberrys you will like this.It has a full strong flavor.Not really a real traditional ale flavor.This is a pretty good summer beer.This is the perfect beer for people who don't like beer.It tastes great with real blueberrys in it.My girlfriend loves this beer."
"This beer poured with a golden hue. A thin head that is no longer with us.The smell is of...blueberries. Imagine that. This beer is actually good for a beer I can see through. There is no bite usually associated with light beers. No stronge aftertaste. Since there is no bite the mouthfeel is pretty darn good. The drinkability is more than I expected from a lighter beer. Drinking this beer makes me want to explore Sea Dog more thouroghly."
"Feel is a tad over carbonated. Hard on the swallow at first but quickly is set aside by one very light body and nearly watery based middle and finish. Almost less then average for a wheat based beer but its overall super clean and crisply quick setting is more then adequate for drinkin it down with favorable ease."
"(No head as poured at bar) From the tap, a golden translucent color. Strong blueberry and citrus nose, typical of a wheat beer. Good witbier flavor: citrusy, wheat and yeast flavors coupled with blueberries. Taste is perhaps sweet to a fault. Mouth is watery and flat, possibly due to a fault of the tap. Drinkability is good, though overly sweet. Overall, an above average witbier."
"Overall: A really nice brew for its intentions. It's well balanced and not too sweet. There is a definate wheat background. On par with Bar Harbor Blueberry, although the two are different in flavor."
"Dark gold in color, very little head and lacing. Smells like my mom's blueberry pie. Smell lasts. Taste is very sweet and artificial or not, it taste like blueberries. Mouthfeel of mild carbonation. Goes down incredibly smooth and makes you want another. Perfect beer to take the lady on a pic nic with. My wife loves this beer as do most women I know. Also a great beer to introduce your macro friends to craft beer."
"Drinkability: This could go over well with the ladies maybe; since it doesn't have the fullest body, or a great amount of flavor, the blueberry could be enough to make a session out of. And I don't mean that to rip on women at all, but for a girlfriend / wife who may not be the biggest beer fan, they make like this. Or, if you like fruit beers you may like this also, but I imagine, surely, there are better ones out there than this."
"Drinkability is of one of the better fruit beers I've had. I'm usually not a fan of these and I don't usually get attracted to them but my wife and friend had this and I decided to check it out. Very refreshing and enjoyable."
"Pours a (shocking) clear yellow with a thin pure white head; for some reason I expected a blue hue! Ok. The nose is quite aromatic  freshly picked blueberries dominate, there is a sort of syrupy aroma as well. Medium bodied, fresh tasting, and to no surprise, a blast of blueberries on the initial quaff; a blast of malts on the palate, just a bit creamy and bitter. A very good example of the style, and quite refreshing, more than a couple though and Im getting bored. Would love to pair this with hot apple pie ala mode."
"As soon as the cap is released, this brew exudes blueberry aromas. They just leap out of the bottle and never end their olfactory assault. At first, its nice, like a fresh blueberry piebut then it turns into a sicky distraction, like an unwelcome blueberry snow-cone. They over-did the fruit on this onefor sure. The liquid is clear, unobtrusive gold color with a negligible head. No hop aroma (or at least its not discernable through the berries). The taste is a little grainy and very crisp (its not what I would call sweet at all). The finish has a little bitterness, thats the only welcome distraction for the fruit. Tone down the berry."
"Big, froathy, bright white head fades briskly to a thin ring. Streams of tiny bubbles rise gingerly from the bottom of the transparent golden beer. Faint floral aroma with blueberry undertones. Fairly crisp lemony wheat beer flavor up front with a dash of toasted malts. Blueberries fade in towards in the middle and hold on all the way through the finish. A nice fruit beer. The blueberry tastes natural and blends well with the beer. Thanks to my brother for this bottle!"
"This poured with a nice, bone white head that just evaporated. It had a huge blueberry nose, like blueberry pancakes. It was a very clear light yellow color. The mouthfeel was somewhat light and, dare I say it?, fizzy. Still, there was a light blueberry taste in the mouth and the finish is dry but with the same blueberry intenseness that I noted on the nose. This is a great summer beer, even for those of us that may not be huge fans of fruit beers."
"A refreshing beer and nice change of pace."
"Pours a standard amber color, a little darker than straw colored. A little creamy head, and a slight lacing. Good carbonation. Was served with some blueberries in the glass, a good garnish. I smelled the beer even before it was put in front of me. Wafts of blueberries with a mild wheat background in the nose. Taste was a little subdued I felt, the blueberries and wheat flavors were a good balance but did not fill the beer. A very drinkable choice, though."
"Fake-ish blueberry flavor, and mediocre wheat beer character. Reminiscent flavors of a certain brewery within my own state and follows suit in a bland and uninteresting build. Might be suitable for those seeking a somewhat refreshing beer with a touch of fruit flavor, but don't expect to be blown away."
"This is an easy drinking, high quality beer that I can't say enough good things about. I love it."
"Wierd texture to this beer--feels like my tongue is coated in blueberry syrup. The beer poured pale amber with very little head to it. The nose was full of blueberries. The hops were hardly present and were very much muted by the blueberry flavoring. Very sweet. The finish just hovers within my nasal cavity and cannot go away. While not overly fond of this beer, I could see how non-hopheads would like it. Myself? I'll drink it in moderation."
"This beer pours a darker golden color and produces a thin head. The smell is like blueberries found in cereal. Taste is blueberry all the way with some light malting. Mouthfeel is like blueberry seltzer with nothing else really for your tastebuds to latch onto. Good on a summer day along with some blueberry pie."
"Disgustingly sweet soda pop. Artificial essence blueberry. This beverage is often mixed with something else. Not so drinkable to me, but perhaps more appreciated by fruit beer lovers or children. Watery and light colour. Overly carbonated which may not be the fault at Underground Bluz in Orlando, but hey! it sells in Florida, not the greatest beer afficiando part of the world."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a wisp of crispness at the start. The finish was crisp and that fake blueberry flavor lingered briefly. One of these is more than enough, unless you are a fan of this fruit brew."
"A tremendous blueberry aroma hits your nose the moment you pop the cap off the bottle. The color is a dull pale orange with a very small white head. The aroma stays strong as it sits in the glass, smells like blueberry syrup or blueberry jam. No hops aroma, reminiscent of a blueberry soda. The blueberries assault your taste buds. Cloyingly sweet...I'm pouring blueberry flavored syrup into my mouth. In the middle of the taste, more traditional beer tastes assert themselves, namely hops, but are quickly chased away by the sickingly sweet blueberries in the finish. The aftertaste is like sucking on a blueberry. Drinkability is horrible due to the overwhelming blueberry sweetness. I've had blueberry beers that I've really enjoyed (Bar Harbor, for one), but this is not one of them. I like the blueberry flavor to stay in the background as a nice subtle flavoring. This one hits you over the head and you mistake it for beer flavored blueberry soda."
"This the first blueberry ale I've tried, and blueberry always seemed an unlikely beer flavoring. Aroma was sweet and soda-popish, with blueberry and peach soda notes. Flavor profile was reasonably crisp and light in a typically American wheat way. The blueberry flavor was well moderated, again lending a soda-pop note, much like a Nehi fruit soda. Although the blueberry flavor stood out as more of an adjunct flavoring than a brewing element, I found myself rather enjoying this beer for what it was. Would be nice to throw a couple in the cooler for some variety on the lake."
"This is a straw colored ale with a small white head that dissapears quickly. A pervassive blueberry aroma that gets your attention as you pour. Nothing else seems to be able through the blueberry aroma. There is a prickly spicey hoppiness that balances the strong fruity sweet blueberry flavor."
"The mouthfeel was watery yet sharp in carbonation. If you're looking for blueberries, drink up."
"Other than the halo of head around its edges, there was no carbonation present, likely due to poor rinsing of the glass after washing. Consisting of a very light straw hue, the offering was crystal clear and a constant cascade of bubbles made up for the poor showing that the US Mens Water Polo Team was putting on at the time on the joints televisions. Not surprisingly, blueberries were the prevalent olfactory note, with a light undertone of malt as well to prop it up. On the palate, the blueberries cannot be ignored, but there was also a touch of lemon as well as a light cherry note, strangely enough. On the whole, I would not choose to have more than one of these pours as the blueberries are just overpowering. Thankfully, at least it wasnt served with actual blueberries floating around it lava lamp-style."
"Clear golden color with a small white head that quickly fades, absolutely no lacing either. Sweet blueberry pie aroma, kind of taste like blueberry pie too. Light body and mouthfeel, finishes sweet, for what it's worth, I like it better than the raspberry wheat and thats not saying much."
"the head was disappointing: vanished immediately. it's spritzy character suggests that it might be a good summer brew, but not for me"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dense but short-lived 3/4"" white head above the clear bright straw brew. Little to no lacing present. Aroma is dominated by sweet blueberry aroma, somewhat artificial, but yet still good. Taste has a wheat character, but flavor is all about the blueberries. However, the wheat flavor is such that it cuts through the sweetness so as not to allow it get cloying. Mouthfeel could be a bit heartier, for a wheat brew, and drinkability is good. A refreshing brew in the warm weather, and one of the few fruit brews that I would recommend."
"Nice Blueberry Ale, I'm not sure how much wheat is in this beer. Its good, but there is something artificial about this beer and I can't put my finger on it. A supermarket nearby recently began selling this beer at $10.99 a 12 pack, which is very respectable. I love to support Maine brewed beer, but this is not my first choice."
"Being from New England and a lover of blueberries, I was really rooting for this one. Unfortunately, this one misses the mark."
"This is definitely a fruit beer, as the blueberries make their presence known in each sip. The fruit is balanced well by the wheat which provides a nice backbone. Overall leaves a dry taste in the mouth (and the taste of blueberries)."
"BooBerry cereal anyone? For me, I loved this beer. That blueberry taste, through and through. It poured a clear yellow, with a thin head. Little bubbles came up from the bottom and sides through the whole glass. Smelled the blueberries the minute I popped the top. Tasted just the way it smelled. All I could think of was BooBerry cereal, my favorite as a kid. Mouthfeel was light, and crisp. Had this one by the pool, then again for dessert after dinner. Glad I had a 6 pack. Great summer beer!"
"Nice clear straw with white head, a little R&L. Smells of fake or strong extracted blueberries. Certainly not subtle. Flavor is sweet and bubbly graininess. A hint of tartness. Finishes dry and bitter in a very unpleasant way. Bland and one-dimensional. Feel is fizzly and very dry finish. An annoying beer. Could have worked if it was more subtle and had a lasting sweetness that blueberries usually have. The dry graininess does not work with the over-the-top blueberry. I will not have this again."
"Last swigs: Sometimes novelty beers have an aftertaste that counters the fruitiness with a tacky cloying syrup sendoff. This one does, that also lends to a lower drinkability. I enjoy different flavors to break things up. SEADOG is a pleasant blueberry wheat that does just that. The flavor lasts throughout the drink. Even the burps taste like blueberries!"
"Smelled blueberry as soon as I uncapped it. Poured a golden pilsener color with a short lived white head. Smells like artificial blueberry flavoring. Not picking up on much wheat ale characteristics because the blueberry is that overwhelming. Very sweet, again in an artificial way, like they made a batch of beer and dumped a ton of blueberry flavored gourmet jelly beans in it. Can't say I'm enjoying this one too much, and I love blueberries. If I want to reproduce this sensation in the future, I'll just buy a pack of blueberry Hubba Bubba and chew a piece while drinking a cheap hefeweizen."
"It pours a golden color with a thin white head. The aroma has sweet malts and some blueberry, though it is not that strong. The blueberry taste hits up front and then fades into the sweet grains. It is not too bitter, but just enough to keep the sweetness in check and it finishes with a lingering sweetness. A decent warm weather drinker beacuse it is relatively light, clean, and refreshing."
"The beer pours a light gold color with a spotty white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a nice blueberry scent which blends nicely with the wheat malt aroma. The taste is poor. It is weak and watered down with a slight hint of blueberry taste. It has no malt character and little fruit flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks well, but it falls short of many fruit beers I've had. This is a poor example of a fruit brew."
"Definitely a nice fruit beer but I wouldn't drink more than 2 at a time. Probably very refreshing on a hot summer day."
"I've had some fine beverages from Sea Dog, so I was excited about this offering. Unfortunately, Sea Dog needs to go back to the drawing board for this one. It certainly has a lovely amber color, although it pours a bit thin. The feel is slightly overcarbonated for my taste, kind of like having one too many pop rocks. The blueberry style is what attracted me to begin with, however it seems like Sea Dog concocted a wheat beer, added some blueberry concentrate, spent a bit of time in the board room trying to think of a clever name and voila! Blue Paw Wild Blueberry Wheat Ale! I admire the effort, but this one needs a bit more work."
"Hmmm, another maine beer makes it down to PA, so I decided to give it a go...here goes it...A light golden/yellow colour with a bit of a frothy white head. Aromas are on the subtle side with some blueberry syrup in there as well. The taste is that of a lackluster wheat beer with some IHOP, blueberry syrup thrown into the mix as well. The mouthfeel is thin, and the drinkability is just average. An average fruit beer. I expect more from Maine beer!"
"This is an interesting beer to sip on occasionally, though I can think of many others that would fit that category much better and be more satisfying. The singularity and artificiality of the blueberry in this beer is a bit much to get me really excited about it."
"Well I bought this for the other half and she really liked it,me well it was ok.Poured light golden color with a almost non-existant head,aroma was Boo-Berry cereal in a glass artificial blueberry and toasted malt aromasNow saying its artificial doesnt really bother me it actually smelled decent I think,flavor was of malted wheat and blueberry not to overly bad but I wouldnt get again I dont think."
"Tastes of blueberries of course. Leaves a bittersweet aftertaste. This is similiar to their raspberry wheat ale but the blueberries are tart and offer more bitterness, adding to the complexity of the taste. Medium bodied with a decent aftertaste. A decent ale but I will probably leave the rest for my wife."
"Pours with a thin, white head that doesn't stay not leaving any lace. Pale golden color. The nose is a strong, sweet blueberry and taste is a strong sweet blueberry with the malts and some hops. Nice clean crisp finish. Very good fruit beer, light bodied."
"Normally don't drink the fruit beers but this was in the fridge and I said what the hey lets give it a shot. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Straw color with a medium white froth. Smell was just blueberries I couldn't get any other type of smell from this. Taste was of sweet malts and blueberries, not a bad taste. It was a tad too sweet but after a little while you get used to it. All in all it wasn't bad but it wasn't great."
"Normally I turn my nose up at fruit beers, but in this case I will make an exception. The reason for this exception is simple... I can mix it with Guinness! For those of you who have never tasted a ""black and blue"" as some call it, treat yourself. It mutes the Blueberry beer's normally overpowering sweetness and becomes an entirely different animal."
"Cheers"
"Notes:sugar taste almost like cotton candy.A bit acidic also."
"The only good thing about this beer was its nose: definitely blueberry. As far as taste, it might as well have been a bottle of bud light with an essence of blueberry. There was really very little special about this beer. I wouldn't waste my money on this one again."
"     Say no to bluberrry ale!"
"The flavor is blueberry all the way through, in good proportion to the wheat & malt. Definitely grows on you as you drink it. The finish is a nice blueberry - wheat grainy malt balance. A very tasty fruit wheat beer, once you get past the nose. Definitely better straight from the bottle IMO."
"Same straw color as the raspberry beer. Thin faint white head, lasted a little longer. Smell was more subtle on the fruit side and better defined beer wise. Some noticable malt taste, then big blueberry kick. Grainy taste is also less noticable. Stands alone better than the raspberry beer. Light bodied and refreshing. I suggest mixing this one with a stout as well, makes for a nice summer refresher with some body."
"Notes: A pretty good fruit ale with some character on the side."
