"I like fruit beers but this had no beer taste at all."

"So my rating of this is based on what it is, not what other beers are (kinda how it should be, right?). What we have here is the perfect summer day beer (which I tried in the winter...). A beer that shandys likely were designed to emulate. My rating is also a little all over the place. First off, the beer looks tragic. Barely fizzy piss. Perhaps drinking straight from the can is a good route to take.  Get past the look and take a whiff to find a pleasant fruity fragrance that seems far less contrived than most shandys I have had.  Move on to taste and it is light, fruity, refreshing and crisp. All this at 2.5%!!! As for finish, here's another bonus - not cloyingly sweet as the taste may suggest!  Look, this isn't something you will crack open and have an intellectual moment over, but if you have a summer drinking marathon in your future, you have GOT to get a few of these. Especially if that marathon starts before noon!"

"Tastes just as advertised. Drank from a can. Quite refreshing and tasty."

"Idk if I'd consider this a beer really but it does taste great and it def has beer in it. Good enough for me."

"In a can: 5.0"
"Great on warm/hot evenings!"

"Not a big grapefruit fan, but this is nice on a hot day."

"Overall – While more soda like then beer, it is a good summer beverage that would be fantastic for a hot summer day when doing yard work."
"This beverage is 50% beer and 50% grapefruit juice and had people turning their nose up at it in the beginning of a recent tasting I held but this tasty treat converted a lot of the people by the end. It's mild beer and pink grapefruit taste changed a few minds. Like I said to the crowd, I'd rather drink this than a fake fruit cider or cooler and obviously the majority agreed."

"Very refreshing in the Summer.  Nice color and easy pour.  Not much foam."
"O- Not bad, and this is coming from a guy who usually hates the taste of grapefruit.  I've been hearing so many different people rave about this stuff I had to give in and buy a can. After half the can, it gets to be too grapefruity but they certainly accomplished what they were going for."

"Think overly sweetened grapefruit ""lemon"" ade.  It's quenching but not very beer like.  Would do well with the cider crowd I think."

"Please seriously consider this review. I may be an outlier from the rest, but i sincerely suggest you consider an alternative to this particular radler if you want something that tastes even remotely like a beer."

"Interesting. The ABV is very low and it is hard to classify this as a beer.....but...ITS DELICIOUS !!!. Just a hint of beer flavor that is immediately covered up by a wonderful natural grapefruit flavor. This is one of the most refreshing drinks I have had in awhile. I would have preferred a little more beer presence, but for what it is, Excellent, will drink again !"

"Overall, a delicious and thirst quenching radler. If it's hot as hell out, drink this; at the beach, on the lawn mower, or just sweating your ass off it will do the trick."

"2.7/5: More soda than beer; there will definitely be fans of this, though"

"With lots of acidity but without being too harsh on the palate, one can't ask for a whole lot more than the light but not shallow body, zest, and crispness this beer brings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can: Poured a light yellow color ale with a small bubbly head. Aroma of fresh grapefruit juice with some residual sugar is as far remove to beer as possible. Taste is also dominated by loads of grapefruit notes with some residual sugar notes and some light wheat malt. Body is about average with good carbonation. So much sugar and grapefruit juice that it does not resemble beer anymore but enjoyable on a hot summer day nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is excellent and I was surprised to find a six-pack of this. I've been wanting to try this for a while, but even more so after having Sixpoint's RAD."
""
""
"O: Very similar to a grapefruit soda - super easy to drink and refreshing. I can see why these were originally for cyclist refreshment, it is great on a very hot early summer day here in NC (hottest day of the year so far)."

"Overall: Tough to rate as a beer, but for what it is it works really well. The grapefruit soda plays a large roll in the overall flavor, but it's enjoyable and there's enough there to remind you that you are actually drinking a beer."
""
""
""
"Some moderate effervescence and this low alcohol brew goes down easy, really an ideal session beer during summertime afternoons at just 2.5% as long as you don't mind the in your face grapefruit"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is more like a beer cocktail or the equivalent to a wine cooler. If I were to think of it as a soda, it is better than Fanta or Fresca. As far as beers, it wasn't really present in the taste. I found it as cloying as ciders and framboises, two styles I'm not too fond of."
""
""
"After spending countless hours in Bavarian beer gardens in the summer drinking Radlers and Russ'ns, this brings me back. If you are looking for a ""real beer "" taste, then this is now what you want. If , you want a summer Radler, then this is a fine example and definitely repeatable for the style. Very referencing and low alcohol. I will purchase more as this plus Schofferhofer's grapefruit hefewiesse and Sam Adams Porch Rocker have all become summer staples in my beer fridge."
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy lemon with a frothy white head. Aroma is grapefruit dominant, with notes of floral hops and crackery malt. Flavor is like lemonade, but with grapefruit tartness, slightly sweet, s touch bready, and somewhat refreshing. Not your typical beer, per se, but it has its place."

"I've been putting down a lot of DIPAs lately and needed a break tonight. I've always seen this and never pulled the trigger, until I seen it at a bar tonight. I love grapefruit and find this just plain delicious. Not something I could session though but a nice break. If you love grapefruit you will not be disappointed."

"A very flavorful Radler – incredibly refreshing. Makes me want to mow the yard just to have an excuse to drink a couple more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Compared to some other radlers and shandies I've had, this is much better. If you like grapefruit, this is a solid choice for a low-alcohol thirst-quencher!"
""
""
""

"Poured a cloudy, opaque yellow with a thin ring of white lacing and abundant carbonation bubbles. It looks like fresh squeezed juice or a headless hefeweizen. Scents of grapefruit flesh, with just the slightest hint of sweet malt. Not much to the aroma, but it isn't bad, I do love grapefruit. Taste begins with a big hit of sweet grapefruit soda, still slightly sour as one would expect, but sweetness balances it. This prevails throughout, with a little bit of a bitter grapefruit flavor on the finish, though extremely faint. Aftertaste is sweet and faintly bitter grapefruit flesh. A good flavor for a radler, very fruity, full of grapefruit flavor and refreshing, though lacking in the beer flavors. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a slightly tart, puckering feel. The after swallow feel is like after eating grapefruit flesh. Quite nice and very refreshing. Overall this is a good beer for what it is, a radler. It is refreshing, fruity and crisp and does its job well. Not bad."
""
""

"A tangy radler with a lot of grapefruit soda sweetness and base beer wheatiness. Earthy weisse yeast has a touch of bubblegum, but this beer is grapefruit-dominant. Truly, what it's intended to be... two-fifths beer and three-fifths summery non-beer drinker's delight. Notes of lemon flesh and green apple fight to be tasted. Very refreshing. I'm drinking it on a warm, muggy evening; but I think the beer would look and taste better if it had a golden stream of sunlight shining through it. My only complaints are that it's a tad too carbonically acidic, it lacks much depth of flavor, and it's a bit of a burpy nightmare. For a radler/shandy, we're hitting the nail on the head."

"Smells strongly of grapefruit and the taste is very light. It is one of the few beers my girlfriend would drink because it is basically like drinking juice. Love the smell and love the taste but it doesn't seem like much of a beer at a low 2.5% ABV."
""
""
""
""
"O: This doesn't taste much like a beer but is very easy to drink and would make for a refreshing drink on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer would probably be more refreshing in the summer than on a 5° winter day. It is a little too sweet for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"O: I remember my first Radler in Germany and have been enjoying them since. Typically I make up a batch of my own to enjoy over the hot summer months. However, with that said I hesitate to call this a beer. More like a bottled beer cocktail. Never-the-less, its still a pleasant drink. Light, refreshing and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This beer is literally Fresca. Someone put Fresca in a bottle and told me its beer. You're saying this isn't Fresca? Bullshit, its Fresca. That's not a bad thing though because Fresca is great."
""
"The taste has a sweet citrus flavor which is tangy but not bitter with some light wheat flavor adding to the sweetness of the grapefruit and presenting some malt in the flavor with a more lemony flavor middle to finish with slight efferscent spice in the background. Overall a very well balanced radler - nice mix of wheat with citrus fruit not going overboard it starts like citrus/grapefruit soda and finished more like lemon/wheat -enjoyable."
""
"A wonderful summer brew that always tastes great, very refreshing. Enjoy the citrus grapefruit taste. It blends seamlessly with the beer enhancing the overall taste and experience. Very crisp! Also enjoy the Lemon Radler from Stiegl, but the grapefruit is my favorite!"
""
"Poured from a 500ml can. Pours a cloudy and fizzy yellowish color with no head. Nose is full of grapefruit with some lemon, notes of Sprite, and not much else. The taste is even brighter with nice grapefruit notes. The grapefruit has a bit of pucker but is sweetened up by the soda. I really don't detect any notes of the beer that is somewhere hidden in here, but I guess that's okay because this is incredibly tasty and refreshing. Mouthfeel is effervescent and light. Overall, this is my first Radler and it is quite delicious. This drinks much more like a soda than a beer."
""
""
""
""
"Imagine working outside on a blistering hot day ... you want something that is going to quench your thirst, but also something sweet, not so alcoholic and still beer-ish. It’s as simple as cutting a beer with soda. Stiegl opted for grapefruit rather than the traditional lemon here. Surprised this style has not caught on in the US yet—good drinking for what it is."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a nice example of a Radler, it really highlighted those fresh grapefruit flavors and I could see how this would be a nice and refreshing after doing yard work in the summer time. This beer, had great drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, refreshing, not filling, and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these, but hopefully it doesn't trigger any heartburn. What I liked the most about this beer was the fresh grapefruit flavor and the true to style mouthfeel they both worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, I think it would be a little better if the sweetness was toned down a little and let more of that grapefruit tartness shine through. I would buy this beer again, but I think I would mainly get it in the summer since I think it's very fitting for the season. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fruit beers, shandys, or grapefruits. All in all I was happy with this beer, it had all the makings of a good radler and besides the higher sweetness I thought it was pretty sessionable. This be made for a decent first impression of this brewery and I'll have to keep an eye out for more beers from them, nice work guys."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end, I had hoped for a bit more of a potent grapefruit and not this sort of lemonade sort of thing. The sweetness was a bit too punchy as well. The balance between beer and fruit juice is pretty heavily on one side. But it is pretty clean and drinkable. I could imagine on a hot day next to a lake this may be a pretty favorable choice and a good crowd pleaser especially when there are people who may not drink a lot of beer around. Also the low ABV is nice, you can have one or two and feel good. Continue about your day without feeling sluggish. I won't go to grab more, I was satisfied enough to try it though. Not bad, but nothing crazy."

"After a strenuous bike ride with 20 lbs. on my back, this was the perfect thing to cool down with... which is it's precise intended purpose. It's not an IPA, ""not beer", whatever. More for me, because it's a fucking delicious beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - No perceptible alcohol but didn't realize until i came here that it was 2.5%. Suddenly everything makes a lot more sense now.A better offering in terms than many of the other flavored beers / shandies of the world, but unless it’s a hot summer day this is not a repeat purchase."
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Probably not. It's enjoyable, but it's closer to grapefruit San Pellegrino than it is to beer. Why drink beer that lacks the characteristics of beer?"
""
""

"Final Grade: 4.00, just barely eking out an A-. Stiegl Grapefruit Radler isn't the sort of beer that is going to be knocking many BA's socks off, but it's still a fine radler that stands strong when compared to most other light, sessionable fruit beers. With its aerated, spritzy mouthfeel, miniscule alcohol content and a flavour that reminds me of a good (non-aspartame-sweetened) version of Fresca, this stuff barely even qualifies as beer - but it's still delicious, and I must therefore give it some well-deserved props. People buy light fruit beers because it's hot as hell out and they want something tasty to quench their thirst - not to experience the complex range of malt or hop flavours/aromas typically found in beer. This particular brew is a very solid choice for anyone in the aforementioned situation, and if you handed me one after a day of sweaty, exhausting work, I'd be one happy panda, that's for sure."
"I usually really hate fruit infused beers, they always miss the mark, that is until I had this Radler. Its fantastic. I would not rush out to buy a six pack for a single sitting, but its a great palet cleanser for a night of beer tastings. Its also extremely refreshing for hot summer nights. One can, or pint will usually do you good for 3-4 other brews. My wife likes beer, and loves this beer, so it is a little girly if you ask me. However I keep grabbing a few cans, when in stock."
""
""
""

"It is what it is, a hybrid more than anything. Great for a warm day. Pleasant taste, maybe a bit sweet. Is it a beer?"
"Thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16.9 oz. can. Has a whiteish color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very strong of grapefruit, some sweetness. Taste is soda like, grapefruit, sweet, some sour notes, tasty but not very beer like. Feels light and highly carbonated in the mouth and overall was pretty good, but I wouldn't want a steady diet of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A refreshing combination that would especially be great on a hot day. Reminded me a bit too much of soda for me to get too excited about it though."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice Crack followed by a decent Glug and I had a finger of fizzy, bone-white head that was really closer to soda pop than to a beer's head. Nose was fully grapefruit and my mouth was watering. I am more partial to pink grapefruit where this was a cloudy grapefruit-yellow color. Mouthfeel was thin, not watery, but very effervescent on the tongue. The taste was more sweet than tart, which was a negative for me because I like tart and not sweet. Finish was closer to tart, but I was still left with a sugary sweetness. I would CANsider this more of a novelty than a beer, but on a hot summer's day, it could be quite refreshing. I feel like now, I am ready for a beer."
""
"Orange/grapefruit/lime smell. Very strong, almost overpowering aroma. Cloudy yellow color. Little to no head that fades quickly. Tastes like Orange Gatorade. That's the best comparison I can give. It doesn't blow me away. It's very sweet and easy to drink. Would be a good beer for people who don't like the taste of beer. With that said, it's not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know what to do with this stuff. Other than drink it. As for reviewing it, it's delicious, but it feels like a stretch to call it beer. But I will definitely call it yummy."
""
""
"Unusually strong fresh, light taste of grapefruit with a sweet, non-bitter finish. Very refreshing on a summer day. Beer is light and presents in a slightly frosted clarity--reminds me a little of Fresca when it wasn't a diet drink. Golden Amber color with a citrus smell. Served ice cold."
"O: Not bad. I could see this being a good lawnmower or picnic beer for sure."
""
"Feel is good, mild carbonation makes this a real patio beer. There's nothing bad about this beer when you really look at it (except that it is a stretch to call it beer), but it's overrated. Still, if you can't stomach beer, this is something to try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Someone recommended this to me and I was somewhat skeptical but this is pretty good for what it is. Super refreshing and drinks like water, it goes down that easily. Good fresh grapefruit feel."
"O) Shit.... If you love grapefruit, order this and enjoy. It's quite a tasty treat, and at 2.50 ABV, you can drink a boatload."

"I don't feel like rating this on BA is all that appropriate as it is more soda but it's pretty darn good."
"Can pours a hazy whitish yellow, definitely not an attractive beer. Aroma is pure ""grapefruit soda"". The taste is a nice mix of grapefruit with a pale malt backbone. Flavour is much more ""pop"" than beer, but has a nice tartness to the finish that makes it far more refreshing than any cooler on the market. And the 2.5% ABV is absolutely perfect for any occasion involving driving..."

"Very nice really. Not very beer like but eminently drinkable. Will no doubt become a summer favorite due to the refreshing nature and the low ABV"

"Side note: I often make these using Squirt and the Pilsener from one of my local breweries, Chuckanut. They kick ass, and I suggest you try it with one of your local brews."
""
""
""
""
""

"A fine, refreshing beer with lots of fruity taste and crispness. This is excellent for the summer, for cookouts, or for just relaxing in the lounge room. Fun and tasty, easy going down. If you want something light and refreshing, give this a try. Or two."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like it. It's simple, refreshing, and tasty. I had it with some mussels for dinner and it complemented the seafood quite nicely. I would certainly drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – I'd buy this stuff again. A few people who are around me right now tried some from my glass and they are raving about it. A great summer drink for sure.. but it doesn't taste like a beer."
""
""
""
"Again, it's all about the fruit soda. But those delicate pils type flavors still manage to maintain a presence. Tart, sweet, mildly bitter... I could literally drink this all day."
""
""
""
""

"I had this on tap at my local Wine World PCB. Hung around the store while they cleaned the line and set it up, then had the first one from the keg. It's a hazy yellow with a snowy white, soap sudzy head. I'm rating this for what it is, and it is EXACTLY what it's meant to be, a cold, fruity refresher. The first thing to hit you is the fresh grapefruit smell. Just like slicing a grapefruit in half and sticking your nose right in. It's summertime in a glass. I got the sensation I get when I bring a gin and grapefruit to my nose. It's amazing how much this smells like real grapefruit. The taste is light, sweet, very intense grapefruit (without the sourness) and a nice, extremely light beer finish. The aftertaste is light and short and leaves you wanting more. I'm just sorry that this stuff is rarely available here. It would be GREAT for a day at the beach."

"Overall. Like one of those fancy, expensive grapefruit soda-water drinks. My wife said ""Tastes like one of my drinks!"" That's not a good thing."
"O - This is a good radler. I don't really like grapefruit juice, but this was good."
""
"Poured from a 330ml bottle(?). Pours a cloudy orangey-white, like a hefeweizen. The smell is like fresh-cut grapefruit and grapefruit peel. Very natural smelling. It has mouth-filling carbonation which is nice and refreshing. There's not much typical beer flavour, but it has a nice tart finish to it. WIth the low alcohol content, it would be easy to drink a lot of these."
"Overall: not exactly my bag, this radler. The aroma is pretty enticing, but once you get into the flavor it kind of falls apart. Perhaps it would be better on a really hot day or something."
"Very bubbly, clean & light. Lots of grapefruit aroma and flavour. It doesn't have the sweetness of an alco-pop, but the beer-like flavour is certainly watered down. The grapefruit is a nice twist on the classic Radler. Really drinkable thirst-quencher."
"I knew I wouldn't turn down a free pour of this (hell, I'm one of the apparent few that actually likes the lemon version), but I didn't think I'd actually be offered said pour. Fair enough. This stuff pours a lightly hazy golden-straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose is a dead ringer for a can of Squirt or something, though faint hints of barley and grass sorta try to get themselves implied as well (with varying degrees of success). The taste brings in more of the same, though the grapefruit actually is tempered by a general sense of malted grain, keeping things less sweet than they could otherwise have been. The body is a very light medium, with a fairly active carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, it is what it is: a grapefruit-flavored pre-mixed radler. Yeah, it's sweet and carbonated like a soda, but it somehow doesn't overdo things too much (it definitely makes you rethink where the brink is/was/will be). I can say with some confidence that I (somewhat surprisingly) enjoyed this stuff."
"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy bone colored head that fades to nothing. Tiny dots of lace slolwy drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grapefruit juice, sugared grapefruit, and some slight malt aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight sourness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite refreshing but not too beer like in my opinion."
""
""
""
"O: A special hybrid between soda and beer. Drinks like a soda with a touch of beer. Somehow the two sets of flavors meld nicely. Much better than the standard lemon flavored one. Low alcohol and easy drinking make this one fantastic summer beer."
"11.2oz green bottle, pours a fizzy, hazy yellow color with a thin white head that dissipates as quickly as a soda - maybe because it is half soda. Aroma is actually pretty good with a zing of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Tastes are tart and refreshing with grapefruit juice being the dominant flavor. Some biscuity notes come through from the lager with some lager yeast present on the finish. Mouth-feel is thin and fizzy, overly carbonated. Overall, not my favorite by any means, but it is definitely refreshing. It is a summer staple in our house as it is one of my wife's go-to's."
""
""
""
"Perhaps the most pleasantly surprising beer I've ever had. In the past I've had shandys disliked them all. I love grapefruit, and grapefruit hops notes, but the few grapefruit juice infused beers I've had have been terrible. Here, the light, almost airy beer married very well with the grapefruit. Exceptionally hazy, like a super-yeasty hefeweizen. Clean grapefruit juice aroma. Moderately sweet, balanced nicely by the grapefruit bitterness and slight acidity. A nice example of a low alcohol German quaffer - it cries out for a hot, lazy day."
""
"The beer appears yellow with a mild haze and a small, fizzy head. The aroma offers grapefruit juice, a touch of lemon rind. Interesting...the beer drinks like a grapefruit spritzer. Nice and light on the palate. Refreshing and crisp. This is a tough beverage to review. On one hand, it's simple, easy, lacking depth. Almost like a soda. Mediocre. On the other hand, it's highly drinkable with a tasty grapefruit quality and it's especially suitable for the summer months. I could definitely make my way through several of these while playing bags, darts, watching football, or doing some equally distracting. I would certainly have this again."
""
"In my '80s Simac IL Gealtiao Magnum it goes from the bottle to a fluffy grapefruit snow with a perfect balance of bitter and sweet in under half an hour."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad. Very refreshing and fairly tasty but very little beer left. Not anything like I expected."
""
"This is classified as a fruit beer, which I suppose might be where it belongs, but in comparing this to other Radlers I've had, I must say that this is EASILY the best one.... So my numbers represent a rating compared to other Radlers, and not necessarily to fruit beers in general."
""
""
"But to tell the truth, I absolutely love a well-balanced shandy or radler, but I love them for slightly different reasons than I love traditional beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed it. It is not the first thing I go to when I really want a full flavored beer, but it is light and enjoyable."
"As stated before, this tastes nothing like a beer and more like a light grapefruit flavored pop. Overall; this is a simple and refreshing fruit beer, but the tartiness ruins it for me."
"Much better then I expected but still not something I can see myself drinking a whole lot of this summer, something refreshing and easy to drink but I'd need quite a few to even catch a buzz"
"Stiegl Radler was a tremendously refreshing, enjoyable patio drink the hot afternoon in June I skipped work to have it. And water is wet. Shocking, right? In all honesty though, I can't understand why more bars don't offer them. They're hugely agreeable and yet calling them a fruit beer is almost out of context: this one was every bit as gratifying as a 'real' lager."
"Lovely palate cleanser. Real grapefruit flavour, on tap and served in a skinny glass. Carbonation right there. Reminded me of orangina, graperuit edition - yes there was such a thing. Grapefruit aroma. Some lace and head. Significant aspartame in this ""soft drink"" cuts calories cut also taste. Little in way of a beer, BTW."
"A rather refreshing beer mix, the tart and sweet generally well balanced. The waitress proclaimed up front that it tastes like Orangina - I have to agree, but with the caveat of a citrus shift from orange to grapefruit. I can well see why this would be popular in a sweltering, humid summer climate - here, though, hard to say - time will tell."
