3.48,11.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"A little out of season, as this was hiding in my fridge since mid-summer, but a welcome break from the robust stouts and spiced creations of the holidays. Frothy, white, meringue-like head forms after an assertive pour in to a tall weizen glass. The 2 finger crest settles in to a thin layer of foam with little to no lacing. This brew could pass for fresh squeezed oranges, with its hazy, unfiltered appearance and juice-like color. The aroma reminds me of half time at youth soccer matches, with freshly sliced oranges taking center stage against the backdrop of a grassy pitch. The flavor is not altogether different than what is achieved by dropping a slice of orange in to (insert random American Pale Wheat Ale), although with little other pronounced flavor. The wheaty mouthfeel gives it some body, and helps add a little depth with a grain-like finish. Pleasantly refreshing. I am detecting some sour citrus notes. Lemon, pith, and sweet candied oranges. The carbonation is lively, and helps create a thirst-quenching quaff.  If you are an aficianado of orange soda, then this is your beer. I'm not sure if this can really be called beer actually. But whatever you choose to call it, it's delicious and easy to drink. I am in to my second pour as I finish this review. The low ABV only adds to the refreshment. I'll be looking forward to this one each summer, and will gladly drink this over the abhorrent lemon shandy varieties that I've tried. Unlike their recipe of dumping country-time lemonade in to a cheap wheat beer, this one seems more natural and palatable. It's a one-trick pony with a pretty nice trick.","JohnnyI","Dec 23, 2014"

It pours a cloudy brass-amber topped by a finger of white foam.  The nose comprises straight Creamsicle undercut by a bit of wet wheat.  The taste leads with the wheat (now less wet), then proceeds into some orange wedge, and then a bit of coriander.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this was definitely a step up from the sadness that is Summer Shandy (however little that actually says), but it falls a bit short for me in terms of full enjoyment.  It's not bad, but nothing I feel like trying again any time soon.","TMoney2591","Oct 05, 2014"

There's a decent amount of lacing. The brew mostly smells like oranges and orange peel, along with a general citrus aroma (reminds me of Tang and other orange like citrus drinks) and some bready/grainy malt. I think the taste is pretty much like the aroma, it does remind me more of a slightly watered down citrus/orange drink than a fruit beer. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and easy to drink. Overall I like this. I think it's a good choice for a warmer day, it wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these.","bluejacket74","Jun 06, 2014"

Even if I'm not a big fan of some of their offers (IE: Canoe Paddler, which I'm looking to retry next season), the fact that they can throw out multiple different shandies, season offerings, and unique looking beers such as Creamy Dark and Red Lager year after year is nothing short of amazing. Orange Shandy is definitely my current favorite of their offerings.","SteveJeremy","Jun 05, 2014"

Pours into the only glass I have handy with a thin but fine bubble creamy head topping a cloudy orange mimosa-like appearance. On the taste the tartness of the orange hits first followed by classic sweeter orange flavor then all followed by a slightly bitter hoppiness that clears out the orange. Unique indeed, for what it is it is spot on. This would be a great brew on a hot day ice cold or good on a cold winter day at room temperature. Do I dare say it may even make a good hot toddy? Maybe have to try it and see. Was hesitant to try this due to bad experiences with lambrics but orange seems to compliment this brew well.","mooseisloose","Dec 03, 2013"

3.29,5.4,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,3,"a recreation of their famous lemon shandy, this orange brew lacks the refreshment and easy of consumption that the lemon one has, and seems a little out of season in the winter now, but still isn't a bad brew. it just looks like a light wheat beer, with a pretty decent head on it that doesn't last. the nose is orange heavy, not artificial either, but fresh and pulpy. the fruit part smells nice, but in combination with beer ingredients, it gets a little funny and smells like the base of a barbeque sauce or something. it taste also very orange forward, like carbonated fresh orange juice. I like the freshness of the fruit, but it overpowers any grain or hops and results in a beverage that may refresh some, but falls short of tasting like beer to me, and that's a problem. again, no off flavors here, just too much fruit to still be beer. I really do like the lemon shandy, I think the lemon flavors blend better with the lager, but this one is out of balance. light bodied and well carbonated, a drinkable brew, perhaps better suited for hot weather than pre-thanksgiving frost. maybe I will revisit this in the summer, maybe not.","StonedTrippin","Nov 29, 2013"

Looked kinda hazy orange when I looked in the bottle. Smell was very strong of orange. When I took my first drink, I thought I was drinking a generic orange soda. Way to strong on the orange taste. The mouthfeel was odd. I felt like I had coated my mouth with sugar. Overall, just not a beer for me. Maybe if it was 100 degrees outside and I was craving something orange, but I think I would just go with a soda instead.","dcall384","Nov 02, 2013"

I wouldn't by the beer on it's own, I would rather have Summer Shandy or Lemon Berry Shandy and I wouldn't really recommend this beer.

3.01,-3.5,3,3.25,3,2.5,3,"My Crack and inverted Glug produced but a momentary head of fizzy, eggshell-white head with decidedly low retention. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow, much like freshly-squeezed orange or grapefruit juice. Nose smelled artificially of orange and when I closed my eyes, I thought back to Tang, which is what the astronauts drank once upon a time. In the here and now, it had a thin mouthfeel, but quite effervescent. It tasted like a liquified Dreamsicle and I felt like a little kid again. I used to love both Tang and Dreamsicles, but now it seemed cloyingly sweet. Finish was likewise very sweet and I began to wonder who I would share this with. It would not be my current Old Lady as she would laugh at me for drinking such a beverage. It should be shared, though, as it is too sweet for me by myself.","woodychandler","May 25, 2013"
1.66,-46.8,2,1.5,1.5,2.75,1.5,"Poured into a red Solo cup (wooo!), a somewhat cloudy yellow-orange color with a large fizzy white head that soon died down to a wispy layer of bubbles, with soda-like carbonation rising from the bottom. Aroma of orange candy and light stinky grains. Tasted like orange drink and seltzer, with some stale malts in the background. Not that I expected much, but whatever. Consistency of water, but goes down like it too, so at least there's that. Chicks might dig this, but not me. Plenty of other much better summertime quenchers out there.","Rifugium","May 22, 2013"

NEVER AGAIN. Eff you Leinenkugels for violating my taste buds in such a horrible way. Bottom line, this beer tastes like failure. Stay away.","that_guy","Apr 23, 2013"
