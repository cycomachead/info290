"I am not a fan beer in general but if I had to pick one this one would win hands down every time. It is sweet and delicious. It has a brilliant red color with a vibrant sweet aroma of raspberry. When tasting this it is soft, sweet and a hint of tartness. The sweetness of this beer is not overwhelming in any sense."
""
"Tastes like raspberry soda. Too sweet. Not really beer."
"Phenomenal raspberry flavor. Sweet, and tart at the same time"
"Way too sweet. And at this price, I will try and mix my last two with a stout."
""
""
"Just not for me. Reminded me of a table wine. Some people might love this but it's just too sweet for me."

"This beer is incredibly to sweet. I wasn't even able to finish it. To sweet and sugary for a beer. Stop making this Founders. Thanks"

"2013 bottle poured into a snifter. Liquid raspberry jam. Pretty one dimensional; pretty delicious."
""
""
"It is what it is. Not really for me, too tart sweet. For the style its good, fresh fruit flavor ect, but not what I look for in beer. Would go well with dessert."

"Pours a dark red with almost pink head that trails the glass. The smell was full of raspberry to the point where I couldn't make out anything else. The taste was rather pleasant, but very sweet. But the aftertaste lingered way too long with a mouthfeel that was a bit syrupy. A great dessert beer but I can't see myself drinking more than one at a time."

"Guest bottle at FFF poured into half pint. Sweet raspberry and ether aroma. Sweet then sour berry on the tongue melting into fresh baked bread and malt. Delicious."

"Heavy berry flavor. Sweet and mildly sour. Good with food or alone."
"Great beer but far too sweet for me."
""
""
"Solid tasty fruit forward ale"
"O:  Glad I got to try this one.  An interesting dessert beer.  I bet this would mix well with a sweet wine."
""
"Overall: I tried to like this, really I did - I've read good things about it, and Founders in general, so was immensely disappointed with the overpowering raspberry-ness of it. Somehow it comes out tasting rather artifical, although in the interests of full disclosure I prefer kriek-style beers anyway. Sadly, in the UK at least, a proper Belgian frambozen is easier to track down and ultimately better tasting too. Disappointing."

"To sweet and thick. Taste like addes syrup."

"Overall, it is what it is.  Very sweet almost too sweet.  I like it but I would like to see a little more malt presence to balance out the berryness."
""

"Jammy as fuq. So good!"
""
""
"This is wonderfully refreshing and very drinkable brew.  I think it would go down really well on a hot summer afternoon."
""
""

"Just way too sweet and syrupy. Lacking balance in flavor and body."

"Very good lots of raspberries so kinda of tart but founders did a very nice job with this !"

"At my local bar/bottle shop we keep this on tap almost all summer/fall, and it's a great go to on a hot day or just a nice day in general. As refreshing as a beer can get. This and Steigl Radler are two beers to have around for a hot summer day."
"Very sweet and fruity beer. Remind me of a Belgian Krieg. Nice to change things up every once in a while."

"355ml bottle. BB 04/2015. Pours a mid ros√© colour. Creamy pink head, good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of raspberry syrup, artificial sweetener and some grain. Initial taste is quite sweet but not in an overpowering way and then some dry tartness. Medium almost winelike body, effervescent, sticky lingering mouthfeel. Gentle alcohol warmth. A pleasantly interesting beer."

"After reading a few reviews here it seems that I may have gotten a bottle from the ""bad"" batch. However I stick by my rating as this inconsistency seems common enough. I'd hesitantly be willing to give this another go."

"Poured a clear ruby red body with a thin ring of pinkish head. A good looking fruit beer, very bright and inviting. Scents of sweet and slightly tart raspberries, raspberry tart and indeterminate red berry flavors. Overall impression of aroma is of a very fruity, raspberry dominated profile that is pleasant, but a bit one note. Still very nice for a fruity beer. Flavor begins very sweet, with strong notes of sweet raspberries and lesser, though still moderate flavors of strawberries and blackberries. A slight sweet malt is in the background. These flavors continue into the middle. Finish is sweet with the same flavors on display, with a bit of an apple flavor also present and a slight acidity. Aftertaste is raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and sweet and grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a sweet and very fruity beer. Those flavors dominate and make this a pleasant and refreshing, but a bit one note. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, slightly tart and juicy feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice, light, refreshing beer that is very pleasant. Overall this is a good fruit beer. It is light, fruity and very refreshing with a wonderfully pleasant aroma and nicely sweet flavor profile. This is further enhanced by the mouthfeel. It is a bit one note, like many fruit beers, but it is still good for the style."

""
""
"tastes double crooked tree with a hint of raspberries"
"YUM. Sometimes I can find this on draft at a dive bar. That's always a good night. It's tart and sweet and tastes like real fruit, unlike most others. I don't even mind fulfilling the girl drinker stereotype with a big red glass of this in front of me."
""
"Pours ruby red, nose is tinned raspberries, and flavour is quite sweet raspberry/malt. Nice and zesty on the mouth but overall just a bit too sweet to cut it."
""
"Bottle from Warehouse Package. Pours ruby red with no head. Aroma of raspberries and a tartness. Tastes of sweet raspberries.  Very drinkable and delicious, like an alcoholic fruit juice."

"Pours a clear ruby red with a medium slightly pink tinged head with good lacing. Aroma of raspberry and pomegranate fill the senses. A sweet raspberry flavor, fruity with some pale malt and mild yeast notes, and sweet tartness. A medium body, crisp and smooth mouth feel with good carbonation. Finish is sweet berry flavors, some sweet tart notes and some mild malt and yeast on the end. This brew seems well balanced and not overly sweet. Overall a good and refreshing summertime brew."

"On tap at the KBS release. Out of all the beers we tried that night, this was my least favorite, but it was still good. Light ruby colored body. Taste of sour cranberries with some malt characters. I may have rated this higher, but living in Wisconsin and having access to New Glarus and there tart beers have really made all others tough to compare. Still pretty good."

"Best Raspberry beer I've ever had.  It was also available in Nitro at the brewery.  Goes great with Founders oatmeal stout!"
"Overall: Well if you like raspberry jam (and I do) this might be for you.  Serve as a dessert or digestif."
""
""
"Pours out a hazy ruddy red.  Head is slightly off-white to pink.  Nose is raspberry candy.  Flavor is raspberry, raspberry, raspberry.  That's about it.  Pretty sweet overall.  The fruit contributes some tartness, but it isn't enough to balance the sweet.  Mouthfeel is a bit sticky.  I love raspberries, but this is a bit much to finish a 12 oz.  I would like this in a 4 oz. serving as a digestif much better."

"O - I found the first few sips to be refreshing, but the raspberry juice like qualities make this a sipper.  An enjoyable, fresh-tasting fruit beer.  The smell was by far the most enjoyable and balanced part of the this beer."

"Overall, I'm not very impressed by this beer. It's like a moderately better version of a standard raspberry-flavored malt beverage. Don't misunderstand me, it's far more drinkable and enjoyable than those abominations, but it's nothing amazing. Also, I'm not a fan of fruit beers anyway; I would have much rather enjoyed a raspberry sour."

"O: Drinkability is high on the charts, as the lower ABV content makes for a nice, easy drinking fruit beer.  Not overly sweet but not puckering with tartness; a nice blend of fruity aroma and flavors with just enough of a malt/wheat presence to create a crisp, refreshing beer for all occasions.   For a style of beer that is consistently maligned, Founders has concocted quite the pleasant surprise with this raspberry-infused beer.  Would recommend for anyone who enjoys wheat beers or lambics ‚Äì in my mind this seems to cut a middle ground between the two."

"Love me some Founders. Took awhile, however, to give this a whirl. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my snifter. Next to zero head, though a unique deep ruby hue that demanded a longer look than I give most brews. Aroma of clear raspberry (I hope, right?), light citrus, and a hint of malty goodness. Not as much actual raspberry to the taste... quite subtle really. A nice refreshing tart aftertaste. Light carbonation and slightly dry in the mouth (was thinking that it might be too syrupy sweet) and pleased overall. I would not buy this again (even though it was good, not really my thing)... but was happy for the experience. Delicate touch to a beer that could have been a raspberry nightmare."

"This is a very good beer. I'm not sure if I'd put it up against the New Glarus Raspberry Tart, but it stands pretty well on its own. Nice balance of sweetness/tart and it's obvious it uses fresh, natural raspberries. What else should one expect from a fruit beer?"

"Founders went all in on fruit flavoring with this one, so like most fruit beers and lambics that stress the fruit, this is probably a love-it-or-hate-it brew. For my money, this is the right way to do a fruit beer. I want to taste the fruit if I choose a fruit beer and I want it to taste like real fruit, not artificial. This one pretty much hits the spot, is fairly thirst-quenching, and manages to still feel somewhat like a beer all things considered. If that sounds like your cup of tea, er, beer, then this is one of the better ones you'll find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice summer refreshing fruit beer, but could probably only have one as it is overly sweet and very one note."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad fruit beer. I'm gonna compare this one to New Glarus' offerings, which is probably unfair. But it is too one dimensional to compete with theirs. This beer does with it sets out to do, and I will give it that. But I wouldn't mind seeing a little more complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just like all great beer it's meant to be enjoyed one or two per sitting. I had this next to Samuel Smiths Cherry beer and even the taste was lacking so its true you can have too much of a good thing! Recommended!"

"edit: revisiting this makes me realize how good it is. dryer than i gave it credit fore before, and really authentic on the fruit front. maybe freshness has a lot to do with the differences, but i am bumping up a few scores to reflect how much i am digging this one right now. very solid offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Glad I tried it but I couldn't drink more than a few sips."
""

"O - A great beer. Just wish it was not so expensive, or this one would be a regular."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into 12 oz. tulip. Nothing resembling a head here, slightest trace of lacing, doesn't last too long. Raspberries come off strong immediately in the aroma and hide anything else that might be there. Taste is the same thing for me, the taste is delicious, but I really feel like I'm drinking raspberry juice. I haven't had a lot in this style so I'm not sure exactly what to look for in terms of depth and complexity. Incredibly refreshing however!"
"Cheers!"

"O: Founders rarely seems to go wrong, and Rubaeus is no exception. It's extremely balanced and well made."
""
"I am not a big fan of fruit flavored beers but i tasted this one a second time and it was much better than a year ago. Nice raspberry color flavor and aroma. It is something like raspberry soda but with less but ample carbonation and the flavor of raspberry is prominent yet not overwhelming. Great mouth feel for this type of beer. I could drink this on a nice tropical day and not get sick of it. Well maybe after 4 of them but i have a hard time drinking 4 of any of the same beer in one sitting. I like to mix it up."

"If you like an ale with a hint of fruit, this is a go-to. Tastes like real raspberries, not the chemical/medicinal/candy flavor in a lot of the fruit ales. Sweet, but not overly so, very smooth, beautiful color...excellent all around as a summer refresher."

"A fairly good fruit beer, certainly up there with the best that I've tried. Easy to drink & it went down well with some nice malts & bitterness helping level out the sweetness from the raspberries. An enjoyable one but you'd be hard pushed to drink more than one of them in a sitting."
"I really enjoy this beer - not only for its uniqueness, but also because it's really good."
"Pours a hazy reddish color with hints of orange and brown. Head doesn't last long. Nose has fruity sour notes, and the obvious fruits of course. Delightfully sour on the palate, sweet, fruity, refreshing. Manages to be huge on flavor without being sickly sweet, or too sour. Glad I tried this one and set aside the usual stereotypes about this sort of thing being for the girls."

"O = I will seek this out in the future. I purchased one bottle as part of a ""mix-n-match"" six pack the other day, and am sorry I didn't purchase more. This is a perfect summer/early autumn ale choice, and I think it would pair well with a cheese plate or a dessert of chocolate (mousse or cake) or a creme brulee.

If you enjoy drinking dish detergent, then this may be the beer for you. Otherwise, move on. Worst Founder's beer I've ever had. Probably in the top 5 worst beers I have ever had."

""
""
""

"Overall, although this a pretty one-dimensional beer it tastes great and has tons of raspberries in here. This is a raspberry bomb that I am very happy they decided to brew this again as it was harder to get last year. I was really excited to hear it was being released again and will definitely be buying lots of these 4-packs. That being said the one-dimensional taste and the tiny head that's disappears right away take a little from this beer."
""
""
"O: Well, it's pretty much pure raspberry. Alcoholic raspberry soda. The only way you can tell it's not soda is the light bitterness in the aftertaste. Really tasty, crisp and refreshing. Great warm weather beer. It's not the most complex and a it loses a lot of typical beer characteristics but I don't think that's the point here. I enjoyed it a lot. Probably the best raspberry flavor in a beer, short of NG raspberry tart."
"Cheers!"

"This is not my favorite beer and I have never been a huge fan of fruity beers like this. I know a ton of people that absolutely love this beer though. For me, I think it is too sweet to really enjoy with any sort of food. I do enjoy this on occasion, but it tends to upset my stomach."

"Pours an attractive red shade, somewhere in between burgundy and cardinal. A soft pink covering of foam rests nicely on top. The aroma is sweet and complex. While a trace of hops and grains can be detected, the drinker is overwhelmed with ripe raspberry. A tart aspect mixes well with what is perceived to be the malts. The flavor is quite similar to the qualities in the aroma... it is a bit earthy, a little bitter, and is very wine-like. It's got a nice, crisp finish... similar to a fresh cider. Overall I rather like this one, especially as I am not the biggest fan of fruit beers. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys adult beverages, except perhaps those who might not like something that's moderately tart."

"Overall, not overly sweet (which I was afraid it would be). Raspberry beginning, middle and end. Nice lambic-like beer."
""
"Overall a tasty fruit beer."

"Very strong raspberry aroma! Pours deep ruby brown with red highlights, pale off white/pink head. Head dissipates immediately. Taste is sweet , raspberry absolutely forward. Lambic like. Very drinkable, not for the person who loves hops!!"

"O-I don't really care for this. I love fruit beers, but this is just so thick and syrupy. It's made for nightmare hangovers. It's not even. Dry drinkable. It just reminds me of a stronger macro fruit beer."
""
"O - I enjoy fruit beers, and this one offers many of the things I enjoy most without being too sweet or too tart. Delivers nearly 6% ABV with barely a hint of the alcohol involved. Held together surprisingly well even though we are several months past the beer's release season. Very happy to try this, and will seek it out again next summer."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: Rubaeus is another in a long line of excellent beers produced by Founders. Rubaeus is a bit on the sweet side and maybe could have used a bit of bitterness for balance. I really would like to try this mixed with a nice stout or porter. I recommend trying out Rubaeus if you have the opportunity! Classifed as a Fruit Beer at 5.7% ABV. Consumed 12/12/2013."

"A very juicy and nice fruit beer. Raspberry being my favorite helps alot, the balance between the natural tartness of the fruit and sweetness is clinging on the edge of being too sweet but it works."

"This is a pretty good beer, one or two once in awhile would be pretty good. I would buy this again to have around for a nice changeup."
""

"O: Didn't know what to expect as I've never had a fruit beer other than Shiner's prickly pear. This was overall a good one. I like the taste and the mouth although they aren't necessarily fantastic. Founders never disappoints me."

"A beautiful dark ruby pour with little head or lacing. The nose is of raspberry overlaying a sweet backbone. Almost medium bodied with a carbonation level set to provide crispness and a flavor explosion. The smooth mouthfeel translates to an expertly well balanced raspberry, tart and sweet flavor profile. Raspberry predominates, then the tartness hits the palate and ends on a sweet note. The finish is crisp with a lingering tartness after the raspberry and sweetness fades. Another masterpiece from Founders."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very sweet and fruity. A bit syrupy. ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice to take a couple sips of but I probably couldn't finish an entire glass of this."
""
""
""
""

"Being a big raspberry fan I bought a four pack of these and already tried it and not liked it but thought I'd review it anyway and not suprisingly it's a raspberry hue with a one finger head and some nice lacing,the smell is raspberry lollies that's it,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated and on taste I have to make sure I'm not drinking cool drink its basically a big sweet mess of raspberries everything else has no chance of getting through the only taste I get is raspberry jam and raspberry lollies and overall if you like lollies and sweet stuff then sure try it but ill never drink this one again cheers."
""
""
""
""
"Much too sweet. Nothing apparent behind the raspberry."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent brew, but not one I would search out again. I prefer sour fruit beers over this, and if I want to drink a raspberry beer, I'll go for a raspberry lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was not my favorite Founders brew, but it was not a bad offering. I didn't think that it separated itself from the pack and would have preferred it stayed sweeter throughout because the back end of the flavor didn't quite meld with the initial fruity sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As an admitted Founders fan-boy, I must confess this brew is something of a disappointment considering their track record. It's not bad, but it feels like a novelty compared to Founders' usual standard of quality. If you're looking for a class fruit-infused beer, you're better off sticking to Lindemans."
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed my small sample and certainly can appreciate the craft that went into making this offering, but it tasted more like a mixed drink to me than a beer. As I was drinking this, I actually thought that I finally found a beer that my wife (who hates beer) would enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"TOTAL = 34/50"
""
""
""
"O- Overall, I am extremely impressed with this beer. It is a must try for anyone who loves raspberries. If you love raspberries, you will love this beer. If you dislike raspberries, you will dislike this beer. Highly recommended!"
"O - I say it is poor overall. If I am looking for a raspberry flavor like this I will go for a Lambic over this any day. This is similar to the Wild Red beer from AB."
""
""
""
"This would be a good summer beer, I'd defiantly recommend if you're a fan of fruit beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this and could easily drink a dangerous amount of it on a hot summer day. Add this to my list of summer beers."
""
"Overall: This is a very tasty beverage. Good raspberry flavor with a great balance between the sweet and the tart, but unfortunately not too much beer flavor. It‚Äôs more like a low-alcohol punch. That being said, it‚Äôd be a great brunch drink!!"
""
""
"Once in a while beer for me, but it is well executed and pretty darn tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- If you like raspberries, then you'll like this. Good beer, it just needs a little more carbonation."
""
""
"O - Rubaeus is a decent beer, very sessionable, and a nice substitute for more expensive sours."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas. Probably the best Raspberry Ale I've ever had the opportunity to try. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a fantastic raspberry ale. The scent and taste were delicious. The body was ok, but the finish was really smooth, so it was really easy to drink. Better than Raspberry Tart. Impressive dessert beer."
""
"A fruit beer is what a fruit beer is--barely beer like, some not even drinkable. This is drinkable, but only slightly beer like. It's well above average for a fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I could drink this all day (or summer). I hope Founders comes to MD by next summer because I would love to have better access to this."
""
""
"O: Really pleasant, not quite as earth shattering as Blushing Monk but a darn good substitute in 12's and 4 packs. Good stuff."
"O - This isn't a beer I would normally go for (fruit beers that is), but once again Founders proves that they can make anything awesome. I really, really enjoyed this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not sure I could drink several of these in a row but this is quite tasty & could definitely also have some great uses in the kitchen when cooking in place of Chambord"
""
""
""
""
""
"I think they have obviously tweaked this one since I last had it in 2008. I remember it being an orangish color and only tasting faintly of actual raspberry. Well now it is much darker and actually dark red in color, and it actually tastes like an explosion of raspberries! The aroma is nice but slightly faint, all raspberry. The taste is like the aroma only it is stronger. Great beer and I'll be picking up a full 4 pack next time I'm at the store!"
"Had this on draft at Proof. Great rosy red color. Aroma of sweet berries, some dry straw, a faint bready presence and a touch of citrusy hops as well. Taste is mostly the berry, but I also got some of the hops and dry biscuit along with the berry in the finish. I will definitely drink more of this as the summer winds down."
""
"O- Just as advertised, huge raspberry flavor. A very fruity beer, but does what it tries to do."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is one of the most refreshing beers I've had, all raspberries. Suppose it could do for some more complexity but it's too delicious to complain. Thought this was vastly superior to Cerise. Because this beer is all fruit is seems like a perfect mixing beer, in fact I just mixed some in a Breakfast Stout and it is fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was what I was expecting and hoping for. Something different but not overly sugary and fruity and this was just that. Although expensive, I feel the uniqueness will justify it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit of a (good) mess. Aroma does not even close to match flavors. Recommended, but not anything overwhelming. May need time to sit and think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- There is no mistaking this is a great fruit beer. Are there better ones? yes, but this is really good. This is like Blushing Monk's younger brother."
"Pours a clear red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, raspberries, and raspberry juice aromas. Taste is much the same with lots of raspberry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of seed-like earthy bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid raspberry presence but nothing too memorable for a fruit beer in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice fruit beer. I like this quite a lot. Would most certainly drink this again."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, with light carbonation, a tart and almost bitter finish that trails off sweet and fruity, overall it's a combo of raspberry and grains. This was good as a fruity beer, but not a session brew for me and one I'm glad I tried as it was good, but I may not seek it out. Good for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one just goes way to far to the sweet side."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of those brews that will probably see much of the variety in its ratings due to the age old struggle of personal taste vs stylistic integrity. It's definitely not for everyone, or for every occasion, but for what it is, it is done quite well (not that I would expect any less from Founders at this point). It's easily the best fruit beer I've had, but I wouldn't necessarily find myself reaching for it ahead of other items available that often. Well worth the price of admission, but I won't pine for her when she's gone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall ‚Äì A rather tasty fruit beer with a decent sour characteristics. It is very much like a more affordable slightly less tart Lindeman‚Äôs framboise. Overall, quite tasty."
""
""
"O: I think I preferred Cerise to this one. I've been looking to try this for a while now, so in that regard, this is a mild letdown. Of course, this beer's monotony means I don't have to write a long review. Wooo."
""
"Overall - Like its New Glarus brethren, it's mostly juice. I think I'd take the lighter versions over this, though."
"This beer looks and smells outstanding. And although it's certainly well made, it's a bit overdone in the fruitiness. The raspberry flavors are just a bit too sweet. I'm glad I tried this because it seems to have some qualities that make it stand out (as different) from many others, but I found it just a bit too much."
""
""
""
"O: A very delicious raspberry beer. Definitely sweet, borderline syrupy, but the fruit has a natural (non-synthetic) taste and the mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Definitely worth seeking if you have a sweet tooth. Thanks you, Kevin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like the raspberry syrup in the syrup carousel at IHOP. Diabeetus? Possibly. Its not as good as some of the New Glarus fruit beers, but neither is it unappealing. Id have to say it is a good fruit beer, but I am more curious to see how this can compliment another beer in a blend than drink my remaining 2 by themselves"

"Not sure we will buy it again, but if we do we will defiantly let it breath a few hours because it really improved the bottle we had..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wasn't revolted by this, but I won't rush out to buy more. It is much closer to a raspberry flavored malt liquor drink than what I would call beer. I appreciate the craftsmanship it took to get all that flavor in without using the artificial flavoring rout, but it isn't to my taste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Is it a beer? Factually, yes, otherwise I'd call it a shot at a standard malt beverage from Founders."
""
""
""
""
"I would probably rate this higher if I had never had any New Glarus fruit beers. Regardless, this may be the best fruit beer that I can buy without going to Wisconsin. It loses some charm as it warms up, but it's still good. And unlike most fruit beers, I would actually buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing and light-medium bodied. Sweet and slightly sticky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An okay fruit beer and much better than most other fruit beers that I've had."
""
"Not quite on the level of Raspberry Tart, but I think the sweetness of this beer is just right compared to that Raspberry Tart. RT is thicker with a better nose and appearance but the sweetness on that beer is just off. Rubaeus does it quite well but is lacking in a lot of departments. Still an interesting beer to drink, but I'm definitely not stockpiling these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of my least favorite beers from Founders. Decent flavor but too sweet to really enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is rich and very very raspberry. I get a trickle of sour, but plenty of sweet to round it all up. A well-tasty and enjoyable fruit ale, though definitely not a favorite from this brewery's outstanding canon."
"Considering how long Cerise malingered the past few years, how can this one be put behind the counter? Whatever, this stuff pours a clear ruby topped by a finger of bone foam. The nose is a simple wave of slightly-dank, fresh raspberries. The taste echoes this simple sentiment, the berries coming through a bit on the sweet side, but not so much as to trigger a diabetic reaction or anything. Moreover, things taste pretty damn natural, not very medicinal or artificial. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel. Overall, a very tasty and highly enjoyable fruit beer. No wonder this one is behind the counter..."
"The pink color was unlike most other beers, but obviously the raspberries were responsible for this hue. The head was fizzy and one finger thick at most. The beer looked more like a ros√© wine except with carbonation. The smell also was clearly indicative of the fruit used in making the beer, with strong raspberry scent dominating all else. Taste was dominated by tart-sweet raspberries, some malt sweetness, and showed no hops. The mouthfeel was crisp and simple. This is clearly a fruit dominated drink, and barely a beer at all, but it was good on its own terms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good but not great. The flavors come off as slightly artificial, and the mouthfeel leaves a lot to be desired."
""
""
""
""
"It's entirely one dimensional, but still enjoyable. A good summer beer and if you like raspberries, it's certain you'll like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Yet another interesting, if not quite solid, beer from Founders. I tend to think beers with added fruit should be more tart like a Lambic but not a bad effort here. Definitely one for those with a sweet tooth. Would I drink it again? I suppose."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful off-pink/mahogany red with a pink 1/4 inch collar of foam. The head dissipates rather quickly. Crisp raspberry nose. Bright fruity, raspberry notes on the palate. Dry-to-offf-dry: Less sweet than the typical fruit ale. Delicate lingering. Some Belgian lace. Highly refreshing. Great balance. The ABV is moderate and not noticeable. I'll definitely look for it again. Perfect on a warm or hot day. Excellent accompaniment for lighter fare,"
""
""
""
""
"The only downside on this beer is that I find myself drinking it too quickly, because it's so freaking delicious. Full blast of raspberry, in both smell and taste, but not too sweet. I don't think I could ever drink two in an evening, but it's a great one-beer beer for a summer night."
""
""
""
""
"Thanks! Pours a deep almost neon pinkish red with a very small slightly pink head that recedes quickly. Aroma of sour berries and funk, with more malt presence than I expected (silly me for expecting a Blushing Monk type of brew). Flavor is big bold raspberry with some other flavors mixing in that I can‚Äôt put my finger on. A definite malt presence in the finish. Dry finish and plenty of carbonation. More like Cerise than Blushing Monk. Solid overall, but not spectacular."
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer for the raspberry lover (and I am one). Not complicated, very straightforward. Doesn't pull any punches...it is all about the raspberry. Will have gain."
""

"{revisited with bottle of same vintage in Feb. 2014: remains at least as impressive}."
""
""
""
"not much of a head..about a 1/4 in.reddish/amber color,rather clear..the aroma is fantastic,due to the fresh raspberries.evidently the raspberries are fermented,rather than strictly added.the taste is a little sweet,which wanes a little as you drink it.mouthfeel is light to medium,great for a refreshing summer drink.i highly recommend for being what it is."

"Overall - The closet comparison would be New Glarus Raspberry Tart. Rubaeus loses that contest in a first round knock out. The fruit is not as potent as I would like, and the aftertaste in this one is a detriment."
""
""
"Overall, simple but tasty, and very refreshing. Nice on a hot day. If you like raspberry, this is a well done raspberry focused (dominated) beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark ruby in body with white head that stays around. Smells of big, juicy, mouthwatering, raspberries. Tastes of smooth raspberry juice. Smoothie-like in body. Low carbonation and medium bodied. Does any other American brewery do fruit beers like Founders?"
"O: 4.25 I don't typically go for fruit beers, but this one hits the mark on so many levels. Not too sweet, not bitter at all, just an extremely enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured a very nice violet color body with a small white head that didn't hang around long. The smell is like fresh raspberries. The taste is sweet very good raspberry flavor, not fake. The mouthfeel is great, not over carbonated, smooth its not like syrup. Overall a darn good beer."
""
"Pretty good summertime brew here although its still sweet enough to where I probably won't have more than one at a time."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Pours a deep crimson with violet and maroon accents capped by a violet-tinged one and a half finger head. A blast of raspberry on the nose combined with semi-sweet malt. Opens with big fresh raspberry, combined with general berry jam notes, smooth malt, and even hints of vanilla. Very crisp light body, smooth with a hint of syrup and stickiness on the edges. Rubaeus succeeds in staying very balanced and is never overly sweet; one of the most common failings among some fruit beers. Definitely a winner."
"Overall this is a really great fruit beer. Love the smell and taste. If I was looking to get fruit beer again I would absolutely buy this if it was in season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep but vibrant crimson, head has a slightly pink tinge to it. Full on raspberry onslaught, nothing artificial about it, just pure raspberry like homemade raspberry jam. There's a definite sugar cookie malt sweetness going on underneath which further enhances the fruit, but other than that it's all raspberry. A slight natural tartness lingers on the finish. Just a step behind the New Glarus fruit beers in terms of fruit intensity. There aren't many ""clean"" fruit beers I enjoy but this is certainly one of them. That said, it's not a beer to drink in quantity but as a nice aperitif or as something fun to pair with sweets."
""
""
""
"Overall: If you love raspberries, this is the beer for you. It'sone-dimensional, but it nails that dimension very well."
"I would say this belongs on pancakes if I wasn't so loyal to maple syrup.  This is very sweet so a little goes a long way.  The flavor is good and the quality high; this might just not be for me."
"A relatively weak raspberry beer, in my opinion. Not bad, but I just find it dull, and that buttery character doesn't blend well at all with the raspberry. Lastly, the raspberry is not as potent as it is in the best fruit beers. Comes nowhere close to the quality of New Glarus's Raspberry Tart, so I'll stick to that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O a good beer that was a touch too sweet for me but a nice night cap"
""
""
"All in all, I'm not the biggest fan of fruit beers, but here Founders does a good job of not overpowering the palate. There is a complexity here that reveals itself, before the raspberry hammer falls."

"O: A very good fruit beer, light, refreshing and very easy drinking. Maybe a bit nm the sweet side for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great raspberry beer. From my memory I think it is less sweet than the NG Raspberry Tart. I'm glad this comes in a 12 oz and I'm glad I got this in a build your own pack. Satisfying beer but this style isn't one I go far too often."
""
"O - I read the hype for this fruit beer and was skeptical. Raspberry has been my least liked fruit beer so far. This beer tastes way fresher than any other raspberry beer. I am glad the cherry crop suffered in Michigan, so I got to try this beer."
""
""
"This is one of the better fruit beers I have ever had. It's full flavored without being overpowering or cloying. It has depth of flavor but showcases the raspberries perfectly. For an fruit beer fan, raspberry fan, or simply someone who likes a well crafted beer, this is definitely one that is worth checking out."

"It appears that Founders made a raspberry jam and then put alcohol into it and made it a beer. This is unique and refreshing and Founders nailed what they were going for. This is a great beer on a hot summer day. Reminds me of the New Glarus beers..."
""
""
""
""
"O: Is this a straightforward fruit beer? Yes and no. The raspberry is definitely the main attraction, but there‚Äôs enough contrast thrown in to add complexity and enhance drinkability. Fresh and authentic fruit flavor is the driving force, but a balancing tartness and supporting malt base make this one of the best fruit beers on the market. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been this pleased with a fruit-forward beer that wasn‚Äôt a lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, it's not going to be my favorite beer. But - it's really pretty good for a non-sour fruited beer, one of the better ones I've had. Recommended if you're in the mood for something a little different."
""
"Overall: It's not cheap, and it's not kidding when it says it is a ""pure raspberry ale"". It's also not complex, and it's also not something that everyone will like. But I enjoyed it for what it is, and I'll drink it again. It's one of the best fruit beers I've had just because the mouthfeel is not too thin and the sweetness isn't overpowering."
""
""
"O - I'm always a little nervous about trying fruit beers. This might be the least favorite Founders beer I've had to date, but it's definitely an above average fruit beer still. Good beer for a warm summer day."
"OVERALL: Rubaeus is a successful brew, that is for sure. With heaps of berry flavor from 5 different stages of berry additions, this is a straight forward, high quality fruit beer. I'd love to pair this with my grandmother's chocolate raspberry cake."
"A beginner's lambic. Fresh, fruity taste with slight sour notes. A refreshing fruit beer that would work as a great introduction to lambic or other sour beer styles."
"O: Not for me, but I can see how some would appreciate this beer."

"Kind of like a Blushing Monk light. Not bad at all but it lacks the depth I've come to love and expect from Founders. Still, this is so much better than Cerise was and I think I may try it again blended with their Imperial Stout."
""
"O - okay, I love Belgian sours. Maybe more than most, but its not something I can do everyday like say my wife could. But this thing is much lmuch more than just a fruit beer or a sour. It has some balance and complexity to it. Maybe not a lot, but the Founders imprint of their malt style this thing lets you know you are indeed drinking a brew from the same folks who make the worlds best stouts. This is perfect for summer and a real answer to the somewhat disappointing Cerise, and I liked Cerise. But it was no where near as brilliant as this thing is. Founders may have indeed found the direction they want to go in during the warm months of summer."
"The early spring in 2012 devastated the Michigan cherry crop, and Founders turned to raspberries for their fruit beer. Overall, the result is an excellent summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: There's not much to say about this brew.  It tastes like raspberries, and it tastes awesome.  Nothing insanely complex.  Just delicious raspberry beer.  Nothing wrong with that, and I look forward to it every summer."
""
""
""
"I would definitely recommend this beer for people like me that don't ever drink them ever - it was really a surprising treat"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Thirst quenching, sweet and tart with a great freshness to it. Perfect beer to blend with a berliner or a light IPA. I'll have to try this soon."
""
""
""
"O: Definately not your everyday beer. Very sweet and fruity but is well done within that style. Worth mentioning in the same sentence as Rasberry Tart and Wisconsin Belgian Red although both those are indeed better."
""
""
""
"O ‚Äì This is a nice fruit beer. It reminds me a lot of Cerise, of course with raspberries instead of cherries. I think this is better-crafted than Cerise with a stronger base beer and noticeably fresh fruit being used (rather than extracts). I still prefer fruit beers that are mostly beer with a touch of fruit rather than the other way around, but this tasty and drinkable one will do. Nice job from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This is a top-notch raspberry brew. Not as good as their Blushing Monk, but a solid option, and a must try if you love raspberry."
""
""
""
"Overall, especially due to the price of this offering, I would generally dissuade others from shelling out the $13 or $14 for a 4-pack considering the low alcohol content. However, I don't regret trying it at all and, if someone approached me asking for my recommendations for fruity beers, this would be chief among them. Very well done for the style, but not a beer I can see many flocking to considering the pricetag."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-decent fruit beer, but too sweet for me, wish it had a lot more tartness"
"It's simple yeah, but a very solid straight up fruit beer. Nice fresh taste, light and drinkable, good summer release. Pure raspberry ale."
""
"The ulimate panty-dropper, tastes like juice.So many brewries use fruit extracts and other flavorings you can tell lots of real raspberries are used in this. All in all one of the better fruit beers i've had."
"Overall, an enjoyable raspberry beer. Easy to drink. I wouldn't want more than a bottle however, because it is kind of sweet."
""
""
"Like Behati Prinsloo holding a raspberry, Raul wouldn't mind taking another bite. Roar!"
"Pours a clear, dark red color. 1/4 inch head of an off-pink color. Slight retention and good lacing. Smells of sugar, raspberry, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of grass. Fits the style of an Fruit / Vegetable beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sugar, raspberry, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of grass. Overall, too sweet, and lacking sharpness, but otherwise a good beer."
""
""
"O: This beer tastes as if the brewer fermented all of the sweetness of a NG Razz Tart. Now I can appreciate that this beer isn't supposed to be a Razz Tart knock-off, but, in the end, Razz Tart is the better beer by far. This beer offers up a nice raspberry flavor and a nice, light tartness, but it is also rather unidimensional and unexciting."
""
""
"M: Too sweet to be refreshing. Medium-bodied. I was expecting a hot summer day refresher, but what I got was dessert beer."
""
""
""

"This is tasty, but it's so sweet and raspberry that it's overwhelming. It could be better balanced."

"Good take on the raspberry ale, with enough tartness to make things interesting. Not an everyday brew by any means, but still quite enjoyable."

"O - It is what it says it's going to be. Just a burst of great (slightly sour) sweet raspberry flavor."
"Not one of the best offerings from an amazing brewery, but it was a nice change of pace from the world of IPAs, stouts, etc."
""
"Overall very good for a fruit ale, one of the better ones for the style."

"O-Too sweet and very one dimensional. Still an upgrade from Cerise, but too sweet for me."
""
"Overall hits a sweet spot in the summer time. I've always been a fan of raspberries so this one is a no brainer. Certainly can be like by most people."
"o: A most unusual beer. Rubaeus certainly delivers the raspberry flavor. However, at the price point it might be possible to get just as much fruiity flavor (with more than twice the ABV), from a bottle of Wild Vines or Arbor Mist. I'd recommend this only if you LOVE the flavor of unsweetened semi-ripe raspberries, and don't really want to get a big buzz."
""
""
""
"O: Good beer but very sweet and probably only up for one."
""

"Pours deep pink in color leaving a moderately sized head which quickly calms down to a film. Looks very carbonated. Smell is of raspberries and a mild alcohol background. A bit tart with a punch that leaves a sweet and tart aftertaste but is balanced very very well. Carbonation is much less than it appears. A smooth creamy mouthfeel that is becoming the trademark of Founders' products. After a sip it just sort of melts in the mouth with no prickly carbonation. Leaves a tart sensation on the tongue and the liquid disappears making you want more."

"12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Date is smudged but I can make out that it's from June 2013. Pours a deep red/violet body with two quick fingers worth of pink stained foam. Pretty solid lacing and retention. Aroma is raspberry jam and some caramel malts. Zero hop presence. Taste is similar with tart raspberries and malts. Not as juicy or fruity as New Glarus raspberry tart but on a similar page. Slightly syrupy but never daunting. This is a really solid fruit beer, I just can't believe I'd be in the mood for it that often."
""
"o - Overall a decent beer, with a good taste, but the nose is a miss for me. Super sweet so won't be for everyone, but if you like swete fruity beers, you'll probably like this one. I'd suggest trying to get some New Glarus Raspberry Tart instead, but worth checking out."

"Pours a deep clear reddish purple color with a smallish pink/white head that dissipates almost instantly. Smells like raspberries. Sweet and tart raspberries is all I can find in the aroma really. Maybe a hint of bread if I think about it really hard. The flavor is sweet and tart raspberries with a hint of malt in there and a touch of earth. The mouthfeel is sticky and a bit syrupy, carbonation is low to moderate and the body is moderate. Wine cooler or beer? I enjoyed this a bit and I could drink it again, maybe not my favorite beer but certainly drinkable."
"O/D-I have been wanting to try this for years. I thought Blushing Monk was a gem too. This was a big disappointment. Too sweet, sticky and one-sided. All things considered, I love me some raspberry beer and although I donate a relatively harsh review, this was still pretty decent."
""
"I'll take this one over Cerise, but it's a ways still from Blushing Monk. Works for what it is. A nice treat after a long hard day's work."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby coloring with no head. Aromas of rich, darkly sweet raspberry, like when you boil the fruit when you are making jelly/jam. Flavors are rich and sweet, heavy in legit raspberry fruit flavors. It does a very good job avoiding the sugary or syrupy sweet characteristics. Tart and slightly bitter notes at the end of the palate. The body is smooth and slick. Rich, sweet, and tart aftertaste that starts to pucker a bit as you continue to drink. Slick, slightly cloying finish with a decent tart linger. Very tasty brew."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 6/6/2013. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of huge tart raspberry, raspberry juice, raspberry skin, floral, and light bread. Fantastic aromas with big authentic raspberry notes; and big strength. Exactly what was expected. Taste of big tart raspberry, raspberry juice, raspberry skin, floral, bread, grass, and light floral earthiness. Lingering notes of tart raspberry, raspberry skin, floral bread, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance of raspberry and malt flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent fruit beer! Great balance and robustness of authentic raspberry flavor; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Founders R√ºb√¶us ---4/5."
""
""
"Kind of in the same vein as Cerise but for some reason the raspberry doesn't come through as pure as the cherries did in certain batches. At least the fruit feel is authentic."
""
"Pours a vibrant red with a finger‚Äôs worth of light pink head. Fresh raspberries on the nose, almost like raspberry pie. First sip is thick and sweet, covering the entire inside of my mouth and ending with a slight tartness that cuts the sugar. Mouthfeel is excellent. It want to take really big gulps of this. The raspberries don‚Äôt seem as fresh and bright on the tongue as they did in the aroma, but the flavours are well-balanced with just the right amount of malty backbone. There‚Äôs some bitterness, slight booze and sugary pastry. It‚Äôs a little too sweet for me to be really refreshing, but it‚Äôs extremely drinkable and pretty delicious nevertheless."
""
"It's a murky pinky red ale with little to no etching on the surface. Smells of grain, some grass, a hint of raspberry, not much on the nose. Flavor is nice and juicy with raspberries, and a light adjunct lager flavor in the background. The syrupy raspberry gives the thin beer a distinct heaviness, but my sense tells me this is the robustness of the fruit, not the beer. Lighter carb and a wet finish. Nice beer. Wish Blushing Monk was the seasonal though, then I'd be hunting for that snack for sure."
"O: This beer achieves an excellent balance between sweetness and tartness as neither of them stand out in particular. As this tastes like a sorbet, I could almost see this beer being used as a palate cleanser between courses during a beer dinner."
""
"O- Not too bad, very New Glarus like, reminds me of there Raspberry Tart, but not as good. This beer is perfect for a hot summer day like today, i feel very satisfied. Well done Founders."
"O- the tartness of this beer makes it a sipper, but the raspberry flavors are among the most authentic that I've had. It even has a malty backbone to finish like a real beer. This one stands above most of the style"

"O: A decent beer overall, and pretty good for a fruit beer."
"This beer was made for mixing with other beers. I have seen examples of it being mixed with imperial stouts, etc. You could drink it straight but it might bore your taste buds over time. Either way, it's definitely worth a purchase!"
"This just isn't my kind of beer.. there was way too much sweet raspberry flavor and not much balance at all. It's pretty one-dimensional."
""
""

"O - I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. A real nice summer beer. Recommended! Cheers!"

"Drinkable on this hot day out on the porch"

"Poured a reddish, ""framboise like"" body with pink head and minimal lace. I mostly smelled raspberries with my beer, possibly some hops and grainy malt but to be honest nothing but razzies for me. I will say that thankfully this beer isn't thick or sticky, and by that I mean the dominant taste profile is raspberry but it's not like drinking raspberry flavored smoothies with alcohol. It is a balanced beer, as there are some hop bites that add crisp, bitter backbite, there is some tart and sweetness, and there is a good amount of raspberry but everything is balanced and it feels more like a beer with raspberries, not raspberry beer. Also, I appreciated the balance because it never gets too sugary/sweet but nor does it get so tart it borders on puckering/sourness. I still gave it a ""low"" overall score because personally I couldn't drink more than 12 ounces and the pint I had started to wear on me. Pretty good beer that probably is best served as a dessert beer because it is a little bit of meal in a bottle."
""
""
"Overall: Maybe I'm spoiled from having New Glarus Raspberry Tart easily obtainable, but Rubaeus definitely falls short of that masterpiece. The raspberry accents seem to get slightly lost in a sugary blast. A solid brew, but I wouldn't call it much more then that."
""
""
""
"Ruby red in color. Head quickly dissipates. Just a few wisps of foam remain. Fresh,sweet raspberry aroma. Very different from a lambic in that both the aroma and flavor is on the sweeter side side. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth. This is clearly an ale flavored with fresh raspberry flavoring and not some alcopop malt beverage. Aftertaste pulls back the sweetness just prior to it being a bit much."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not much for fruit beers; generally they're too sweet for my taste. This one was really sweet, and not that enjoyable. Like drinking a non-carbonated soda."

"O- An awesome fruit beer. A bit tiring on the palate but still a good beer."

"Fairly easy to drink, not very complicated, if you like raspberries, you'll most likely enjoy this. Was happy to try this, but will not buy it again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was much sweeter than I expected, but a good change of pace for a summer seasonal. I would recommend that anyone looking at trying this wait until it's hot as hell out, then go for it."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a decent fruit beer that reminded me a little bit of the New Glarus fruit beers. It was very sweet with a light tartness and in your face fruitiness. The downfall was the overpowering sweetness and the pur√©e quality of the fruit which definitely makes this beer something I couldn't palate drinking a lot of. Definitely an upgrade over Cerise, but still not a beer that I'll likely come back to in the near future."
"For someone searching for a beer that's not all that much like a beer, this would be a good option. Sweet, candy like beer that comes from a well known and respected brewer. I will not be trying this again, though I might recommend it to someone who is just easing into beer from the mixed drink category."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Though one or two is more than enough for me in a sitting, I can see this one being a very drinkable beer on a hot day."
""
""
""
"Overall just another impressive solid and fun Founders offering even if it is a bit one dimensional tasting."
"Grade: B"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation that is very easy drinking. As far as fruit beers go, this is a pretty solid offering. An abundance of fruit and enough of a wheat grain base to remind you this is beer. As it warms up, a slight tingle of that 5.7% starts to show itself. Admittedly, I purchased a 4-pack of this hoping it was an overloaded fruity concoction that my wife would enjoy. Unfortunately, it is no New Glarus raspberry tart but it isnt bad either."
""
"Overall: I never thought I could like a strictly raspberry beer as much as this one. Nothing about it tastes artificial. Very tasty!"
"Overall: One of the better fruit beers out there. This is exactly what I'm looking for in a summer beer. Only downside is the relatively high price given what this beer is."
""
"This beer melted my brain in 2009. I was really looking forward to the new release. It's a fruit beer with some actual beer character in there. A bit too sweet overall, but a nice summer beer. Refreshing and a killer beer to use as an intro to the style."
""
""
""
"Pretty good fruit beer that is like blushing monk lite. Still nowhere near anew Glarus fruit beers but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a lot like cherise, i don't see too much difference. way to one dimensional to be great to me. i like my fruit beers with more of something else. such as a unique malt that is stronger or some sourness to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not normal I guess so have one? But it's a beer I'll never have again. Not good. If this is a style stop making it. Founders look guys, you're better than this!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad at all. I have had other fruit beers I liked better. This is an easy drinking and fairly simple version, and pretty refreshing in this Texas heat. I will enjoy the rest of my four pack."
""
""
""
""
"M: It's a light medium."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"For a fruit beer, its really good. Founder's delivers once again. I may introduce this one to the wife."
""
""
"I'm glad I got to try it as it set a nice break from the norm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is a little fluffy, a bit more than effervescent in a light body. It's pretty crisp, generally, and the carbonation that continues to rise through the session somehow isn't too overdone."
""
""
""
"O: Probably my favorite fruit beer. I'm not a fan of this style but having the fresh raspberries really make this a standout in the category. Very refreshing with a tart component that really kicks this up a notch. / 85"
""
""
""
""
"D ‚Äì This would be a great beer for drinking on a hot day but one (maybe two) would be quite enough."
"O - A very good fruit beer. Drinks more like a raspberry soda than a beer. A nice summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - One of the best representations of raspberry in beer I've had; a summer beer to rival any other."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a pretty enjoyable change of pace beer. Its no where near as good as Raspberry Tart, but it is something I would drink again in the future. Certainly worth a try if you've never had it and are interested in fruit beers."
"O: I think Founders did a good job here, however if I'm looking for a drink like this i'll go for the tried and true lindemans. I know several people who don't drink beer (shocking right!?) and they tried it and enjoyed it. I'm not sure if you're going to convert your lady to craft brew with this one but it's worth a shot right!?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It‚Äôs quite easy drinking, but I really wish the sweetness tasted more fresh and real (despite the fact they already use fresh raspberries). It lacks tartness and the sweetness is also a bit too strong for me. However, a good summer beer and definitely a very good introduction for those who prefer fruit flavors and sweet beers."

"bottle picked up locally, enjoyed from my CBS snifter. beer poured a fairly watery pink. thin foamy head fizzed away as quick as it appeared. streaky spotty lacing left traces of where the beer was on the glass as i sipped it. smell is raspberry. taste matches the nose but is rather thick. a face full of fresh berries. feel is on the thick side. beer is fresh fruit. new glarus has nothiung to worry about, but this is far from the worse veggie beer i've tried. a nice break from cerise, but a bit on the syrupy side...enjoyable though. glad to have a 4 pack and might need to seek out another."
""
""
""
""
"O: Raspberries. That's about all I can say about this beer since that's about all that's going on. I love raspberries, but I look for something more in a beer other than tasting like raspberry juice mixed with a bit of soda water. It's not offensive or bad, but there just needs to be some depth."
""

""

""
""
""
""
""

""

"Poured a ruby-mahogany color with a small ringlet for a head; minimal lacing. In the nose, raspberries and lots of 'em, lesser notes of vanilla and caramel malts. Taste was pretty much straight-up raspberry juice, real, not candy-like or artificial-tasting--can't imagine how much raspberry actually went into the brew--sweet and syrupy, not sour, though there was a bit of a tart twinge in the finish; also notes of grass and malted cereal grains. Medium body, syrupy mouthfeel, lower carbonation, easy-drinkin' stuff, if you're into fruit beers. Obviously, this beer isn't going to be for everyone, but it delivered what was promised at least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- i'm not big on fruit beers as they usually seem artificial or medicinal to me, but this has a very fresh natural feel to it. This has changed my idea of what a fruit beer can be. Recommend trying"
""
"I‚Äôm not usually a fan of most fruity beers for the reasons mentioned above, but Founders Rubaeus is easily one of the better raspberry beers on the market. It is nicely balanced between sweet and tart and the addition of natural raspberries- as well as true beer taste- keep it real and help it rank well above the average fruity brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid for what it is, a fruit beer. If your like anything from Sammy smith, Ithaca apricot wheat, etc then this is for you. My big question is, Is this really worth bottling again in a speciality 4-pack over something like, lets say, o I dunno CBS? Very good, easy to drink and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good berry filled fruit beer. Great fresh raspberry juice flavor with a nice subtle malt backing. Simple but very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out as a very nice looking red color with a soft pinkish purple head on top. The retention and lacing were pretty good on this. The smell of the beer is fruity, plenty of sweet fresh raspberry on the nose. The taste of the beer is also packed with raspberry flavors with a subtle wheat malt finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, a little syrupy with a gentle carbonation. Overall this beer is pretty tasty, I enjoy it but I wouldn't wanna drink a lot of it in one session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a well-done fruit beer. I would've enjoyed a more tart flavor and finish. Easy to drink on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely happy that this is back (at least for the time being) in Founders rotational line-up. A very nice fruit beer that actually tastes like real fruit and not artificial sweetener. Absolutely one of the better fruit beers on the market"
"Overall a delicious beer for the right occasion. I could also see it as a bit of a stepping stone in multiple ways. Either as a foray for a non-beer drinker into the world of suds or for someone who doesn't really like fruit beers. This one has something for everyone, and is so drinkable that it would be easy to get carried away."
"As it is, I really enjoyed this beer for the category it is going for. Founder's knocks another one out of the park IMHO."
""
""
""
"Lots of tart raspberry flavor and grainy sweetness. Full bodied that things out a little on the finish. Tartness doesnt linger too much. Sweetness lingers a bit but its not overly sweet. A little sticky though. Not as refreshing as most fruit beers. Heavy body and thick. It's good but I wouldn't drink more than 1. And with how rare pricey it is I wouldn't really recommend it. Preferred Cerise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O= This beer is all it's advertised to be a supreme raspberry ale. It reminds me a lot of New Glarus raspberry tart actually so if you don't like in Wisconsin this is exactly what your missing. A nice bright raspberry flavor in a beer. Seek this one out. As far as fruit beers go this is at the top among the best."
""
""
"overall: If I can get it this'll be a mainstay for the summer. Nice job."
""
""
""
""
"Rubaeus is worth trying... even at the $1 mark-up that I threw down for this four pack, it's a good buy -- as most anything from Founders is."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep ruby color with a fine, creamy pinkish head. Plenty of juicy raspberries in the nose - clean and sweet. Slightly earthy and natural smelling. Raspberry flavor almost becomes too sweet, but is saved by a late, subtle tartness that keeps things out of syrupy territory. Fresh, simple, fruity, and dry. Extremely drinkable...would be a nice choice for a summer drinker is not for the price tag."
"O: A straightforward, tasty fruit beer. Refreshing, too - a great beer for the summer."
"Overall, a delightful addition to the Founders stable (and an appropriate substitute for Cerise), yet in my opinion it's a little pricey for the quality. Nevertheless, if the supply at my local bottle shop holds out, I can see myself splurging on another 4-pack of this to get me through the hot summer months."
""
""
""
"Worth trying on a warm summer evening."
""
"O - Solid fruit beer and well done. I prefer the added dimensions of the New Glarus, but do enjoy Founders efforts."
"In short, this is easily the best fruit beer i've had to date, and my only regret is that the case I picked up was the absolute last and I won't be able to get even more!"
""
""
""
"Raspberries are one of my favorite fruits. More beery than a new glarus or blushing monk, but the fruit is clearly dominant. I need to buy more of these!"
""
""
""
"Overall: I am happy that they brought this back, as I prefer it over Cerise, but I am partial to raspberries over cherries."
""
"So this definitely isn't my style of beers however since its a Founders I'll give it a try. It pours a purple brown, with a purple lace. Very strange looking for a beer. The smell is extremely sweet with an absolute ton of raspberry hitting you right in the face. The taste is more of a raspberry soda than beer, very sweet and a nice tart end. It's actually put together rather nice, which shouldn't come as a surprise from Founders. The feel is a bit syrupy but it does fit with the sweetness. Overall I have to say it has a place. A dessert beer perhaps? Or a summer party. For what this beer is, it's pretty good and will have place in the fridge at he right place and time."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, I haven't had a Raspberry beer that I really enjoyed, till I had this one, it was a little on the sweet side, but the tartness and raspberry flavors were really nice. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, not filling, refreshing and the flavor did a good job at holding my attention, but the sweetness would prevent me fore drinking a lot of this, I think two would be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were both really nice and full of raspberrys. What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, it was a little high and if it was toned down a little it would help the drinkability. I would buy this beer again, if they choose to release it again, it's priced and right and it's pretty enjoyable, I recommend this to people who like fruit beers and if your a big fan of raspberrys then this beer is a must try. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it did a great job at capturing the pure essence of the raspberry, so far it's my favorite raspberry beer and I like it much more than Cerise, it's got to be one of the better fruit beers I have had. Founders seems to be the jack of all trades, they can do stouts, barrel aged beers and hoppy beers really well and now they proved to me that they have some skills when it comes tor fruit beers, good work guys."

"Taste was extremely clean, sweet, but not over powerful sweet. I had this alongside the Bell's Wild Raspberry which was much more tart compared to this. This was very smooth. Definitely something I would try again, hoping I can find some bottles at a store in NYC"
""
""
"After having had quite a few more bottles of this beer this summer, I've come a cross a few that have a slight chalkiness and medicinal character to them. Nothing like Cerise, just a twinge in the background at times. Other bottles seem to be completely void of this, however, so I'm not sure what the deal is. Still a great beer, but maybe not as perfect as I thought it was at first."
""

"O: Haven't tried enough ""good"" fruit beers but I had to try this since it was from Founders and has received some buzz around where I live."
""

"Great overall. One of my all time favorite fruit beers."
""
""
"The pour is amber in color with a finger of white head. A very sweet fruit aroma to this, as expected. Lots of raspberry with maybe a touch of cherry to it as well. Not much else going on. The flavor is sweet with notes of sugar and raspberry. Maybe just a little bit of lemon in there, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O- Held up pretty well. Would drink again but don't know how much longer this will still taste good. Per usual, I'm bless I live so close to new Glarus as no other fruit beers come close. Thanks for the cellar save TATURBO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is definitely raspberries, but the taste came across as a nice balance of raspberries and malt. I did not find this to be too syrupy at all although there is more than a hint of the berries in the taste. Still, finishes somewhat dry and tart. Excellent fruit beer."
"I got this as an extra in a recent trade. Poured into a tulip. The color on this is really nice; a hazy red that reminds me of grapefruit juice. No head on this but it still has a solid body that looks terrific. The smell is shockingly enough full of raspberries. Sweet and tart raspberries, this is fun to smell! The taste is slightly tart raspberries to start and a nice subtly sweet finish. Very nice. The mouthfeel is light and this is a great beer for sipping on. Easy to drink and will be missed."
"Appears a clouded yeast ridden suspension tone pink tinged with a large foamy pink head. Looks a bit like Raspberry Jame in color. Thin lace sticks sporadically around my pint glass. Aroma has strong raspberry puree' not overly candy, but it has a nice earthy mix that goes really well tegether, even a bit of raspberry seed. Flavors toss in tart raspberry slurry touch of alcohol presence with realy natural semi swee fruit juice notes, again it's hard to deny the earthy raspberry seed coming through. Mouthfeel is medium bodied crisply carbonated with an assertive sparking raspberry wine dryness left behind on the palate, not syrupy or overly sweet at any time, a killer fruit ale. Drinkability is solid all around strudy alcohol stands up to the earthy fruit sweetness a surprisingly pleasant experience in my glass."
"overall - very tasty and way better than cerise."
"Drinkability: extremely drinkable. I've had this beer before but this is top notch aged. I'd greatly recommend grabbing a bottle from someone if any remain. It's too bad this is retired."
"Cerise? What is this crap?!"
"D - Think this is a bit past its prime...definitely some age on it...at a guaranteed year on it. Definitely has its merits still, but has seen better days. I will continue to have my last couple periodically thru the summer and still enjoy them, but I know I waited too long on these and missed out on a better experience with these. Oh well...only so much you can drink."
"D: Not bad, just not a favorite of mine."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into Fling Saucer globe. I guess this has been discontinued for a while but since I wont have the opportunity to try this again, I figured I would give it a review. This beer pours a mashed raspberry red with a decent 2 inch head that leaves just a little bit of lacing. From the reviews I've read before, the aroma has kind of dwindled off. Crush sweet raspberries with a little bit of pilsner malt. That's all that really comes through. The flavor is much the same. Crushed sweet raspberries mixed with a light malt flavor. Just a slight hint of oxidization which is a bit surprising because most of the older twist top Founders bottles I've had have a heavy layer of cardboard. The mouthfeel is light leaving a lingering raspberry on the palate. Over all this is a good beer. I would have like to have it fresh."
"D-This would be so easy to drink glass after glass of, and if it was still around I probably would!"
"If you're into a sweeter beer, this one is definitely for you. Double if you're a fan of raspberries."
"D: I like this one for its simplicity and the body makes it more drinkable than it should be. However, I wouldn't go out of my way for this one because of lack of complexity and character."
"F: Slightly bitter, and dries off a bit, but mostly still the raspberry juice. This is not a beer, its a fermented raspberry juice. This might be great for some people, especially a feminine beer, but the complete lack of any real beer qualities makes this not reach anywhere near my top beers. I wish I only got 1 instead of a 4 pack."
"Drinkability: I would have this again, and recommend this to all craft drinkers alike that want to enjoy an ale full of rasberries with a funky tartness that doesn't overpower the but isn't underwhelming."
"D: This beer is a nice refreshing fruit beer. I enjoy fruit beers when they are done well, and this is an example of one. I find Rubaeus to be much better than Cerise and wish Founders would brew this one again. It seems to have held up pretty well with age considering its style."
"Pours a purpley brown color, moderate khaki/pink head and decent lacing. Smell is of tart raspberries with a cereal grain background. Taste follows scent with delicious tart raspberries and a nice cereal grain backbone. Medium bodied, sligltly syrupy but not overly coating and no major aftertaste. Good carbonation for an older bottle. Great fruit beer from Founders, one of the best. Would love to taste a fresh one if ever produced again."
"I'm sad to see it go, but this beer has seen better days."
"*NB: A bit watery, stick with blushing monk. However, it does come through that they used real raspberries, which tend to be quite expensive, as opposed to artificial flavor and corn syrup."
"Sour and tart but not too puckering that nicely balance out the sweetness of the raspberries and syrupy fruit flavor. This sweetness is still the dominant flavor but without the slight tart feel it would be a bit overbearing."
"Overall I really dig R√ºb√¶us. It was the first fruit beer I ever tried and unfortunately it will be no more very soon. I will continue to search for however much is left on planet Earth. Thank you Founders for the good memories!"
"Easy to drink, great in the heat, a real shame this is going away"
"12oz (2008 release). Figured I'd better get it now before you can't anymore. Poured a cloudy reddish-pink; loses color saturation at the edges of the glass. Small raspberry and yeast particles float throughout - rather nice to look at actually. Rigorous pour produced a bubbly white head that dissipated quickly. Aromas were tart raspberries - that's it. Tastes were also tart raspberries with a nice biscuity malt backbone providing excellent balance and drinkability. Had this back-to-back with Cerise and I prefer this one, although they are similar. Refreshing with the alcohol well-concealed."
"This was probably the best fruit beer I ever had.. if you've had the Cerise now, its very similar but obviously with a raspberry flavor.. The pour is a nice pinkish red, smells and tastes like raspberry soda but also has somewhat of a beer character to it.. Again, like cerise its similar to a lambic.. mouth is light and crisp, giving it a really high drinkability. I you are a fan of fruit beers certainly look for it. If not, try it anyway, it may not be loaded with hops and malt but its delicious."
"The body is a bit over carbonated and leaves a slight carbonic bite. This, with the bitterness, is a bit of a distraction. The fruit is light but does linger into the finish. Overall a easy drinking beer that brings out more beer than fruity. The fruit is subtle and not too girly but I think that is the appeal for beer geeks."
"Drinkability: Another stellar beer from Founders. The alcohol is barely noticable and this almost drinks like a sour due to the tartness of the raspberry. I could easily drink a four pack of this and am disappointed that it is going away. It is a nice change from the typical wheat fruit beers."
"D- Sad to see it go but loved it while it was here. A decent abv and a good taste, I could drink a 4-pack no problem. Great warm weather beer, to bad it's on hiatus as of now."
"easy to drink. not sure i would actively hunt this down but if it was an extra i would gladly down another one. well done founders."
"Drinkability- Every time I drink this beauty I love it more and more. I'm a huge fan of any beer with fruit or coffee in it and this is one of the bests. It's so drinkable and although the raspberry is fairly strong, it's not overbearing. An absolute gem that Founders needs to keep on a brewing."
"True to trend, the beer overwhelmingly tastes like raspberry, too. Sweet raspberry, only slightly tart. Infinitely drinkable and refreshing. There isn't much depth here at all, it's a one trick pony. But it doesn't really need anything else, it does that one trick very well. A little thin in mouth, but that's really it. If you want something sweet and fruity, without being artificially cloying or oversweetened, this is it here. I've had Blushing Monk a while ago, and this is basically a less potent, less complex, slightly less awesome version of it. But now that I know this is being discontinued, I might grab a bunch to keep around for the summer months. I just can't stop drinking it."
"Taste is good. Again, fruity, raspberry. Slightly dry finish, which is nice. Mouthfeel is nice, perfect carbonation. This is a tough beer to review. In no way is it a great beer; nor is it a bad one. It is not complex in any way, but for what it is, it tastes pretty darn good. It is a raspberry beer, and if you like raspberries and beer, this is worth a shot."
"Had on tap from possibly the last keg of this beer left in the world. Poured into pint glass. Pours a clear deep red color with a finger of soapy white head. Smells light and wheaty with strong raspberry smell. Taste is like raspberry preserves. This beer is absolutely amazing. Light mouthfeel. Awesome drinkability. I'm not a big fruit beer fan but this beer is great. Its a shame this is now retired. Another excellent example from Founders."
"Come Back Rubaeus!!!"
"very raspberry in the taste. a bit puckery, but it tastes like a small amount of hops are in there but the raspberry dominates. mouthfeel is crisp and clean. but mouthfeel is phlegmy and mucusy."
"My last bottle of Rubaeus from the cellar. I hear this one's going on hiatus and being replaced by Cherise. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my snifter. Appears a beautiful shade of maroon with about two fingers of fluffy pink foam. Smell and taste is dominated by, what else, raspberries. The flavor is tart and refreshing with a pleasant bitterness. Moderate body and carbonation. This is a unique fruit beer. One that I believe was made for people that are not keen on the usual fruit beers. This is akin to a raspberry IPA. So, if that sounds like something you'd dig, seek this one out and give it a try before it goes on vacation."
"If there ever was a beer that mimicked a wine cooler, this would be it. A perfect, warm weather beer for people who do not like beer."
"And that can't be bad. Thanks Brian for the trip down memory lane!"
"Can't give it a good drinkability rating, unfortunately. I'm not a major fan of raspberries, but that's not it. I just don't think it had as much beer character as it should have. This was too much about the berries."
"7/4/7/3/13 (3.4/5)"
"A nicely flavored raspberry beer, although I have had other ones that I felt were better."
"Notes: not too thick/rich. very easy drinking. would especially be great on a warm day. i can see some people call this a girly beer. the cerise has some big shoes to fill, but i think it will do alright"
"Drinkability: An interesting and unique brew. I'm not much a fan of fruit beers, but I'm a huge fan of Founders, so I knew I had to give this one a try. It didn't disappoint - very authentic and very intense, sweet and fruity, perhaps a little too sweet and fruity for some but pleasant for me. I enjoyed it, and though it's certainly no NG Raspberry Tart, it's solid and tasty."
"Nitro tap at the Founders brewery. A dark red color with a creamy head. Definitely a raspberry beer.. maybe with some cranberry or cherry flavor in there as well. Very sweet but it is refreshing. I had no idea this beer was around 7% when I tried it.. would've guessed much lower."
"cant wait to pick it up again."
"A fine beer, the Rubaeus. One of the best fruit beers on the market, in my opinion. Rivals the New Glarus Belgian Red and the DFH Aprihop for quality and production. A delicious beer that I am glad to have more than one of in the fridge."
"A berry red color pour with a creamy pink head.Aroma is tart berries with a hint of grain.Flavor is tart raspberries with some dry grain,and a kiss of hops . A sharp mouthfeel,thin boddy,hoppy finish.This is not my favorite style,pretty much like a juice box."
"A good desert brew, treat it as such. One of the better fruit beers I have tried"
"R√ºb√¶us is an okay fruit beer. I'm not a fan of the style and this one suffers the same flaws as others. Primarily, it's very heavy on fruit and sweetness and short on ordinary good beer qualities. There's some here, but not enough. That being said, it's okay. It's difficult to offer any meaningful criticism. That'd probably lead to it no longer being a fruit/vegetable beer. All in all, it's alright. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: not very high..good for a dessert beer"
"d: Makes for a nice dessert beer. One at a time for me though."
"D_A very nice fruit beer that doesn't become cloying. Makes for a good dessert. I could use a bit more head, but who couldn't?"
"Pretty drinkable beer, nice for some raspberry craving."
"ps they also make an imperial version (blushing monk) I have yet to try this but really want to"
"Girlfriend flat out loves this stuff. Not nearly as sweet as berry weiss but still has lots of good aroma and very drinkable. Not too sweet and you can definitely smell the raspberries. We love drinking Lindeman's Framboise - but you cannot drink that in quantity. This is the perfect balance of fruit flavor in a beer merged with drinkability. Has a fairly high alcohol content to boot - a few of these will definitely satisfy you on a friday/saturday night if you are a fan of fruit beers (or if your lady is so inclined). Price can be a bit high (we paid 9.49 for a 4-pack, but worth it if you love it - pretend it's $2.50 bottles at the bar!) A nice example of how to balance fruit with beer and not go too far in either direction. Highly recommended."
"R√ºb√¶us pours a nice vibrant red with just enough brown notes to suggest this isn't artificially colored. Minimal head; just white lacing five minutes after pour into glass. Aroma is very subdued raspberry, mildly sweet malty aroma. The sip has an exquisite tartness that I wasn't expecting. Really a unique beer. There is just a really nice low-key sweetness from the raspberry, but the sourness is what makes me want to keep drinking. Hides the almost 7% pretty darn well. The drinkability numbers are a pinch lower than they should be because the raspberry sweetness might get a bit cloying after too many of these. Very nice fruit beer from the good folks at Founders."
"It falls somewhere in between a raspberry lambic and a sour ale. Not fully either, though. Quite drinkable, in moderation. Would probably pair well with cheese and nuts, not necessary a full meal."
"D - incredible, it really acheives a superb drinkability, would compliment dessert quite well, especially pie ala mode, mmm..."
"For a fruit beer this is quite good. I like the raspberries, and if I had to choose a fruit beer this would be toward the top of my list. It's just like Blushing Monk but not as strong; a perfect little brother."
"Got this one cause I've always been a fan of Founders brews, and I was in the mood for something raspberry-y. This one is basically exactly what I was looking for. Pours a reddish color with a small tan head. Nose is raspberries, sweet malt. Flavor is lightly tart, with a strong sweet raspberry flavor as well, and a light hop background. I'm a fan of good fruit beers, and I think this one qualifies. Very similar to the Blushing Monk (just $10 cheaper), glad I grabbed this one and would again if in a mood."
"Drinkability: very good for the style. This is one of the best fruit beers I have had. The fruit flavor seems fresh, not the usual syrupy or fake flavors most fruit beers have."
"Pours a rich raspberry color but the head is lacking. The nose is of sweet berries and light grains. Taste has a good amount of tart raspberries followed by some subtle malts. Body is a little fizzy, but goes down well. A nicely balanced fruit beer. Good stuff."
"12 oz. brown bottle w/ twist-off cap; no freshness date"
"D, notes: Not overly sweet or cloying, which makes this drinkable. Fruit derived bitterness adds to drinkability."
"To close to carbonated Kool-Aid for my liking."
"M/D - Medium bodied and slightly sticky/syrupy on the feel. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"If you're looking for quality fruit beers, definitely worth a try."
"D: This one's a treat but if i want a raspberry beer, I'd grab the NG one"
" ~ Unfortunately I'm going to struggle finishing this because of the flavor. It is far too fruity for my liking, or to even really be a beer in my opinion."
"My first thought when pouring this beer was of rhubarb and the color could be called a rhubarb. Not really brown at all or as dark as I would expect it is actually fairly pale in color. Sweet, tart raspberries rush my nose. It is a a very focused and highly sweet aroma almost like a mead. Smells a bit of rhubarb as well and a garden too for that matter. The taste itself is actually not that sweet at all. Fairly tart and it tastes of rhubarb as well. It has a rather vegetal taste to it. The finish is actually a bit sweeter with the characteristics of the nose finally manifesting themselves. Mouthfell is on the light side of medium. Mildly chewy and rather easy-going. Nothing special but not bad either this one."
"Berry flavor comes through in a fairly understated way, a touch sweet, not all that tart. Malt flavors are a little bready, giving this a suprisingly full body for what might be expected for a ""fruit beer"". There's some slickness on the palate, and a touch of bitterness after the swallow. It's thirst quenching due to the fruit element. The full body would limit me to one or two, although it's not overbearing, just a little filling."
"This was a very well crafted Fruit Beer that mixes fresh raspberry character with a great drinkibility that belies it's higher ABV. I'm sad to hear that this will be going on a hiatus. Drink up while you can!"
"D- a good fruit beer. One of the better ones out there."
"It's no ""lambic", IMO, but better than the typical syrupy American fruit wheat beers. It comes in a four-pack at the same price as six-packs of other styles from this brewery. While it didn't particularly excite me, it's nice that it held it's true fruitiness."
"Pours a clean reddih/ orange color with a light pinkish head. In the aroma, a small tart raspberry fruitiness. In the taste, small tart, and small raspberry fruitiness, yet quite clean. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, small raspberry aftertaste. Kind of faint flavors, and a nice small tartness, ok, but expecting more flavor."
"Pours a light red with a tiny white head. Aroma is tart raspberries, grass and some dough. Flavor is wonderfully tart and somewhat grainy. Finishes short and tart. Light to medium bodied, sticky texture. One of the better fruit beers I have enjoyed in recent years."
"The body was light, but since I don't know the underlying beer for this brew, it's hard to say if they hit the mark here. All I will say is that it was very refreshing and drinkable. I could have a few of these on a hot summer day."
"Sorry Founder's, but this seems like you tried too hard and failed. I will never have this again. I'll still have other Founder's brews because of there fairly good track record with me."
"12 ouncer, twist top, no freshness/brewing date info. Pours quite low carbonation , next to no head sticking around and then zip lace. Lovely raspberry nose, fresh and fruity. Fine quality fruit beer, raspberries up front, middle and through the long tasty finish. Tart/sour/sweet all going on and dancing with each other. Nice summer refresher. I'd like to try it with a fruity light dessert, would make a nice beer to do a before meal toast with, instead of champagne."
"mouthfeel is light, sweet, crisp, easy drinking for a high abv of this style"
"D: Overall it was overbearingly sweet at times and hard to imagine putting more then one of these down at a time. A six pack may last awhile and may be a bit much as don't see this beer having much redrinking value."
"Mouthfeel is lush and creamy with a slick texture and good drinkability for a fruity beer. Complex enough to keep you interested and refreshing. Didn't even realize this was almost 7% until I looked here on BA!"
"Appearance is a beautiful cranberry color with a foamy head. The nose is dominated by raspberries and a hint of funk. The taste is a gush of raspberries with a twang and a bit of tartness. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both highly informed by the thirst quenching tartness and acidity. A really wonderful beer. Could have drank several."
"Drinkability- Worth trying for sure. Don't expect Lindemann's, but it's still got enough sweetness to almost be considered a lambic. Quite good."
"No doubt that this is a raspberry brew wooo this is tart, sweet, and nice. Poured into a merlot glass, color is a light mahagony with an enormous carbonated head that is a lighter shade of red. Dark sediment collects at the bottom indicating the use of real raspberries. Aroma is a strong tangy scent of raspberries and sugar. The taste is just what I was anticipating real fruity with just enough alcohol presence from the malt and fruit to remind me that this still is beer. Raspberries are my favorite fruit used in beer and this example reinforces why I like them so much. The mouthfeel is alright slightly over carbonated for my liking but with this much fruit presence it is expected. Out of the ordinary but well worth it."
"Pours ruby red with a small pinkish head that doesn't stick around very long and leaves no lacing. Smell is, not surprisingly, raspberries, mostly sweet but with a hint of sourness at the end. The taste is also dominated by raspberries but there is definitely a beer backbone in there - malts and a faint hop taste in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with decent carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good on this one especially since the sweetness is toned down a little in the taste."
"Worth a try..."
"Not bad, but not exactly my cup of tea."
"D- A little heavy on the carbonation, but not too sour or too sweet."
"D - Aggressive fruit blended brew... A little much, but still very enjoyable... One or two of these on occasion wouldn't be a bad thing... Easy drinking..."
"Tastes like a really firm and juicy raspberry lambic only with none of the yeast funk (and none of the yeast). It's very creamy and smooth. Tastes more like a raspberry smoothy than anything else. Big, big fruit, the teeniest bit of an ambiguous middle that tastes like neither malt nor yeast but is probably beer or else something resembling beer. Then more raspberries. This is still a wonderful taste and still pretty complex, but it's not quite up to the level of the New Glarus beers I assume it's trying to imitate."
"Poured into a snifter having a red/orange color and no head. Smelled completely of raspberries. Tasted lightly of raspberries and finishes tart. Not very strong flavor. Kind of a watered-down mouthfeel and light alcohol warmth. It was nice on a summer day."
"Pours a clear raspberry red color with floaties. One finger of pinkish cream colored head has good retention and leave nice lacing. Smells of tart red raspberries as well as some blackberry and strawberry for good measure, and just enough wheat malt to keep this beer-like. Tastes of tart red raspberries and sweet pale grain with a slight hint of grassy hops in the finish. Medium in body with nice gently fizzy carbonation. Sweet, lightly tart, and malty with a little touch of hops. One of my favorite fruit beers that hides its alcohol well, goes down easily, and is quite sessionable."
"D: A nice beer that is pretty refreshing. Although not on a regular basis, I would drink it again."
"Drinkability is high for those liking the style. Full flavor and moderate ABV. I've enjoyed this one. Sad to see the case coming to an end."
"Enjoy"
"Overall a nice beer to try , not sure If I'd like to drink more than one."
"If you like drinking alcoholic red raspberry juice, then you'll really like this beer. If you want something with a little more variety, then you better go somewhere else."
"Once again, I find another beer that undermines my stale ""no fruit in my beer"" stance. This is like a peppy, well played berry beer soda, which in this case, is all good. The aroma didn't deliver full announcement of what was to come, so it was a bit surprising, and in the end, it drinks smooth, with a little sugar to the tooth, and with a refreshing finish. So from now on, all beer, even those with fruit, are fair game. Except maybe for apricot. We'll see."
"D- I liked this one. Could i see myself drinking a 4 pack of this, no."
"Short of the New Glarus brews (which are great, but even less ""beery"") this is about as good as a fruit beer can be."
"HV"
"Reminding me of a lighter bodied Blushing Monk, the beer is all about the raspberry. I would like to see a bit drier and ""beery"" character to show me that this is a serious ale and not wine cooler or soda pop. But hey, chicks should dig it!"
"A special beer and one of the best in the fruit category. This beer does not play - you want raspberry, here is raspberry!"
"Overall- Blah. Sweet fruity beer good to drink with some chocolate cake otherwise pass on this. Overrated!"
"D: Overall, this is a decent fruit beer that beat my expectations, but overall tastes like a cross between a malt fruit beverage and a wine cooler. Lots of sweetness. I wouldn't turn one of these down but I'm not sure I'd actually purchase another 4 pack anytime soon. Who among us really drinks a ton of fruit beers anyway?"
"this beer is delicious..."
"Pours a light, soft, red in color with no head forming. Plenty of carbonation bubbles racing up the glass. Smell is indeed raspberries. Taste is much the same, of course. Not dominating, overpowering, raspberries, but an almost perfect dose. Another warm weather beer, that's perfect for sitting outside and enjoying. This one went down way too fast to even notice the near 7% ABV."
"drinkability: This stuff is not bad, I could drink it every once in a while if it were available. It's special and it's well executed but it's not neccesarily my thing."
"This was a gift from Viggo, given to accompany the Blushing Monk I picked up last October at Merchants in Dearborn, MI, shared with biegaman. I believe this to be well aged. Enjoyed in an Affligem goblet that might have spread the head a little thin. Light red, a few large bubbles at mid-glass, suspended yeast particles from the last half of the bottle. Inviting smell of fresh cranberry, raspberry from which it came but also a lot of melon and pomegranite. Taste, texture and mouthfeel are light but run the gamut of cherry, wild berries, passion fruit with a malty finish. Low acidity was a real treat considering the menagerie of fruit present. The alcohol was very well hidden and the finish smooth and silky despite the relatively thin body. Overall, a nice treat and I can't wait to compare it to the Blushing Monk. Thanks, Viggo!"
"Drinkability is moderate to low. Flavor is decent, alcohol is moderate, but I just don't see it being consumed in bulk. A 12 oz may be difficult to finish."
"A big thanks to Viggo and ThatWineGuy !!!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: My first thought when this one hit my palate was-Smooth, velvet-like. It has a ferfect amount of carbonation to compliment the tartness in here. NIce medium body, with a semi-dry finish. First slightly wet finish that leads to to a dried finish then back again. Certain parts of my mouth call this dry whilst others...well not so much so. this is one that I'll buy again, pending I can find it next season."
"D- I suppose for the style its pretty nice just not me type of thing. Too fruity for me glad I got to try it."
"This beer pours a beautiful ruby red with a pinkish white head. It smells very strongly yet also very pleasantly of sweet raspberries. The taste is just extremely strong of raspberries and sweet malts. No real hops to speak of. A very bubbly mouthfeel almost champagne like and its very drinkable for a fruit beer. This is one of my favorite regular fruit beers to date."
"D-IMHO one of the best sessionable fruit beers out there. Others are surely better but you aren't able to have one after another. I applaud Founder's on making such an outstanding fruit beer!"
" beers, holding it down in the Midwest market."
"Founders Rubaeus is a basic raspberry ale but without any extract flavor and not too much wheatiness. It pours the typical very hazy golden body beneath a short-lived head of dark white froth that quickly subsides to an average collar. The nose is fruity and malty, and malty and fruity... with a decidedly raspberry-tinged character - but it's not slap you in the face, it's much softer than that. The flavor follows suit, and it's malt and fruit up-front, with the most dominant sweet-fruitiness at that point. The malt then steps in and mellows it. A tinge of tarness passes quickly, and then it becomes sweetly malty across the middle and into the finish as it warms in the mouth. Surprisingly, it's not sticky in the finish at all. The balance is very good, keeping the bitterness well heeled, and letting the natural tart sweet fruitness of the raspberry ride and bob across the surface of the slightly honeyish malt base. I'd personally prefer a beer that had a little more of an edge to it, but I can't fault it as it's very nicely balanced for what it is. Worth trying? If you like the style, absolutely."
"T: Light body with a lot of carbonation. Very sweet up front with taste of slightly sour, fresh raspeberries. Surprisingly not much of an artificial taste. Strong malt body, however finish has a slightly grainy, cloying taste with a warming alcohol punch. I enjoyed this, but would like to try a fresher sample."
"Color is transluscent dark red, with a short lasting lacing head. The nose has blasts of raspberries, damn I pulled that one out of my ass for sure. There is only a slight hint of a dry peel on the background, but very elusive and doesn't find a spot. The peel wants to get out and holla, but can't troll out of its closet just yet. Maybe a few minutes after im writing this he may want to tell me what kind of peel he really is. With the nose being fruit covered in sugar, you would expect the beer to be intensely sweet- although its not compared to other styles similar. You would think that constitutes balance, but in reality any nuance that would show is hidden by sheer raspberry RS covered sugar daddies. Give me something more please! I expected more, although the beer is incredibly approachable and ready for dingdongs nation-wide. After a mintue of writing this, the peel rolled out while i was typing and left me with nothing and got worse as he produced some heat from the fast get-away."
"This beer poured a reddish amber color and formed a huge foamy pink head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops and heavy aroma of raspberries. The flavor is dominated by raspberries and very tart. The body is medium and light and finish is tart with a slightly astringent finish."
"One will be enough for me. I really enjoy raspberries, but this is too sweet and unbeerlike for me. Would make a decent dessert drink, but next time ill just go with the NG raspberry tart. A good brew to serve to those who usually stick to alcopop beverages. Might mix well though with a robust porter or perhaps a stout. Could also probably make a killer marinade or sauce out of this."
"This is enjoybale but I wouldn't hit more than one at a sitting 'cause of the syrupness."
"Pours a pink-amber with a thin white head. The aroma immediately reminds me of Lindeman's Framboise for the rich raspberry. The flavor is similar but lighter in body and not quite as strong in flavor. I mean, if you want real raspberries in a glass, you've got it here. There's a mild earthy note that distinguishes this from a raspberry flavored beer and it's almost juicy at times, finishing with a sweet and sour tang."
"D= Its not my favorite style of beer, yet it is more beer-like than any other fruit beer I have had (and that's meant as a compliment). I wouldn't want to drink very many of these in a row, but its an outstanding beer!"
"Pours deep maroon with a big fresh raspberry smell and a touch of malty ""beery""ness to it as well. Tart, fresh and sweet raspberry flavor and nicely and crisply carbonated. Some grain like beer flavor in the finish that keeps it short of cloying. Fantastic flavor, and very well done. So far, my favorite beer from Founders. Big thanks for this one Jon!"
"This fruit beer pours a beautiful deep, dark ruby red with a light pink cap. The nose is unmistakably raspberry. The fruit flavor is intense and tart, and not sticky-sweet. The malt and hops balance the fruit so that it finishes more like a beer than a fruit drink. The alcohol is nearly completely masked by the intense blend of flavors."
"Verdict: I don't know if I'd want to drink more than one or two of these in one night, as this is a fairly sweet and filling beer. It's a fantastic stab at a style that can turn out to be truly toxic in the wrong hands, though, and it sets a nice standard for other breweries interested in making fruit-flavored beer. Recommended."
"This beer pours a great red/pinkish color. The smell is very sweet and filled with raspberries. It has a great taste and is perfect for a summer night. My only complaint is that it is almost too overwhelming with fruit but only after the first few. Great beer give it a try."
"An inch and a half of almost white head jumps off of the body and fades to just a skim in a couple of minutes. Body is a deep rich ruby red that is very attractive almost like a nice red wine. Nose is very sweet and almost like raspberry hard candy, as it is very fresh and vibrant. A layered tart feel hits the tongue but quickly is joined by a almost creamy lager feel. The sweetness of the raspberries kind of prickles the tongue the height of the palate. Slight sour feel stays dominent throughout this brew. Mouthfeel is somewhere close to eating a tart. I'm not a huge fan of raspberries, but they are presented well here and the beer is nicely drinkable."
"Prosit, MK"
"The brewers tried too hard with this beer and came up short. Pours a fairly turbid pinkish red with no head. In fact there is hardly any carbonation at all. The flatness greatly diminshes its drinkablity. Smells very fruity. Tastes almost like raspberry juice; a bit overdone in my opinion. There was a lot of flocculance in my glass, again distracting. The lack of carbonation really kills this beer."
"Pours like carbonated Kool-Aid. Foggy red, and absolutely no head. Weird. Nose is raspberry toned for sure and not much else. Flavor is overpowering raspberries. In your face, in your mouth, and up in everything else it can get into. Very tangy and distinct. Feel has a lot of carbonation and a decent liquid feel, but it leaves a real sticky feel in the mouth that seems odd. This is a decently well made beer that goes way overboard with the raspberries. It is just too much and creates a one dimensional experience."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a red/pink/amber color with a very small white head. Aroma is pleasing, but it's pretty much just raspberries and it's both sweet and tart smelling. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's sweet and tart raspberries, very nice. I don't notice any hops or alcohol taste in the beer. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, although I think this is more of a dessert beer. I don't know if I could drink more than a couple of these at a time. But overall I think this is a good beer. It's not too sweet and not too tart, it's a great example of what a fruit beer should be."
"I could drink this beer all fucking day, oh man."
"I enjoyed this beer. I had not idea what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. Besides the excessive foam, this was a pretty good beer. Dry in the finish and a little overcarbonated. Certainly a good summertime beer. Very enjoyable."
"drinkability is good. the raspberry character is strong, but still lets the base beer show through. nice level of sweetness without reaching an undesirable sticky sweet level."
"D: So delicious and refreshing!"
"D: Pretty straight forward. Taste isn't anything spectacular but it's better than I expected. Now to decide if I should crack the Blushing Monk open or not."
"Now this was a rather unique looking beer to be honest. When I originally got it I really did not know what to think of it, so the best way to find out is just go ahead and try it, which is exactly what I planned on doing. Poured a very light bright red, almost a pink with very little in the way of a head on top and just the slightest touch of side glass lace. The carbonation coming through was very full and left for chains of bubbles streaming up through the bottom. The aroma was very light and sweet, not really deep raspberries like you see in some others, like Raspberry Tart for example, but a light sugary raspberry, akin to a wine cooler. The taste was very light and crisp with a refreshing nature to the feel. Ample carbonation kept it lively throughout and a decent fruity aftertaste followed. Overall this was pretty decent, nothing spectacular, but still pretty decent. It was a nice novelty one off selection, though I don¬ít think I would go this way again. I am starting to like the fruit beers; I just like them a little heavier then this one."
"Flavor is a very good sweet then tart fresh raspberry taste, crisp, not at all cloying. The finish is bitter as in fruit pith, not hops. Flavorful and good if not terribly interesting...recalls more complex raspberry lambics and makes me want to go find on of those rather than drink more of this. But certainly not bad, as one would expect from this fine brewery."
"The smell is all raspberries, tart and sweet. Taste is similar with a bit of a boozy finish. Fairly well balanced for a fruit beer, a bit too sweet but i guess it has to be to balance out the tartness. Mouthfeel suffers mainly from the little pieces of whatever that make it a bit gritty. Very drinkable, though. my girlfriend loved it which did not surprise me as she likes a lot of fruit beers. Good to try but a bit pricey."
"Avoids syrupy tendencies with a refreshing acidity throughout. Actually, almost a touch thin but decently carbonated. A way above average fruit beer, just a step below New Glarus Raspberry Tart and Liefmans' Framboise as far as raspberry beers go."
"If I had another one, I'd drink it"
"D- This is a good fruit beer and is surprisingly similar to both Great Divide and Celis Raspberry. Good for one drink but not something I'd like to have more than one of. I might pick this up when I find it again (not available in my area)."
"Pours a clear reddish pink, medium white head forms, some lace spots, thin layer forms, disappears to a thin ring. Smell is sweet, lots of raspberries, bready, general fruit, strawberries, not very complex but nice. Taste is similar, sweet malt, some caramel, very fruity, tons of raspberry flavour, nice fruity finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. The raspberries are slightly tart, nicely done fruit beer."
"Drinks very easy."
"D: A bit sweet and bubbly to become a staple for me, but undoubtedly a great summer beer. Also, one of the best examples of a fruit beer I have had - other breweries should take note of the quality that comes with using real fruit rather than artificial flavors."
"D - A pretty good fruit beer that has a lot of complex and unique flavors. It's no lambic, but it's a decently drinkable fruit beer."
"D: wonderful to try, but too sweet for me to have multiples of. something i could have every once and a while, especially with a good vanilla or chocolate ice cream."
"D- I think this is an excellent brew and would get it again if I saw it in stores on vacation. Once again Founders didn't let me down (only on one or two of their brews)"
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy pink head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful raspberry scent that is geniune, not derived from extract. The taste is great. It has a very smooth, raspberry flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity and tart. It does have a dry, earthiness in the finish as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a real treat. Raspberry is my favorite fruit to brew with. This beer is a fine example of a brewery not selling out with fake extracts and brewing with the real deal. It makes a difference."
"Drinkability of this beer is good. I have had each of the 4-pack on separate occasions prefacing another beer. Not sure I could drink multiple fruit beers - akin to eating a whole cake vs. one slice."
"Pours a slightly hazy blushing deep raspberry color with a thin delicate pink head that fades quickly. Surprise! ...it has a rich sweet raspberry aroma, maybe a little syrupy, with a hint of alcohol and an underlying earthy character. Here goes...wow! a keeper. It has a surprisingly heavy body. It's adequately carbonated and there is a tart feel thats well within my tolerance that complements the sweet raspberry flavor nicely. It finishes dry, but the wonderful lingering berry taste causes involuntary 'lapping' urges."
" D - So easy to drink like a Dole juice pop twisted into beer. Very fruit forward raspberry ale. One of the best fruit flavored beers I have had. The berry taste is natural and not overdone, very tasteful and all-around drinkable."
"Md-light mouthfeel and strong carbonation. A well done raspberry beer, which can be quite hard to pull off."
"Pours a funny pink color with a very small off white head. Aroma is fresh raspberries. Taste is sweet raspberries. Not really a beer flavor to it. Some malts. Interesting brew - doesn't taste like a malternative, but doesn't taste like a beer. Overall, it delivers what it advertises - raspberry flavor. My wife really liked it. If you want to buy a raspberry beer, I think that this is the one to get."
"D: The sweetness is strong, so this beer is not for everyone. I could probably have another bottle but that would be the extent of it."
"Drinkability: I believe this is an awesome beer. I would get a case of this if I saw it. I love raspberry and think that the brewers made it authentic to the flavor that the berry holds. The ABV is well-hidden and the beer is sickeningly drinkable and quenching. Very, very nicely done."
"Drinkability - this is good ale. But I do not think it is sessionable, rather this is something that goes well with dinner."
"Pours a ruby red with a pink fluffy one finger head that quickly dies down to a thin, almost non-existant, layer. Stickiness is not there at all. Smell is of tart raspberries, almost wine like, very refreshing. Taste is of what else, raspberries and sour in a way, but not too much. Bitter hop bite starts and finishes on the tongue. Raspberry flavor seems to appear more with warming. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, but NG's Raspberry Tart is a step above."
"Pours a bold cherry/ruby red with slight amber highlights. The sparse head is bright and white but very fine, fizzy, and fleeting. Transclucent with a lot of perfectly-suspended sediment. The nose is dominated by raspberry, but thankfully real raspberry, overlaid on a clean malt base. The taste is better than expected, given the formidable punch of the raspberry in the nose. The taste of raspberry is omnipresent, of course, but varies between smooth, sweetness in the middle and a pleasantly tart finish. Grains undergird things nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and light without being watery and features a bit of carbonated crispness too. Drinkable for its type, and perhaps the best fruit beer I've had to date."
"Overall, a great beer from Founder's. This is exactly what a fruit beer should be. Tons of flavor, but with a good balance."
"Well carbonated and crisply textured. Tangy and a bit acidic. If there is any downside it would be that the flavors are very straight forward, even for a fruit beer. Besides the slight shortcoming in flavor complexity, it is a great selection. The raspberry is very authentic."
"Simply the best fruit beer I've ever had. I've finished this one off without any trouble when it would normally be a struggle. This is what this style should be and a great example of what a quality brewer can do."
"D: I was under whelmed by this beer. I could have used more ¬ìsnap¬î as it was fairly complacent and not too memorable."
"I passes on this beer a few times when home last year but this year I grabbed a couple up and actually I am glad I did.A nice deep red pour with a tight thinner but well formed pink head leaving spotty lace around the pint glass,tart ""real"" raspberry aromas along with an underlying toastiness, very appetizing.The use of all natural fruit makes this beer its sweet and tart and very juicy,what can you say its just damn good.Iam the first to say I shy away from these beers but this is a gem of a fruit beer no doubt."
"D- I found this to be a very unique, but very tasty beer. I will have this one on my mind for quite awhile I think. Worth a try for sure."
"Drinkability depends on if you like this sort of drink. I am not that keen on it but it is not a bad drink."
"Taste is slightly tart and fruity with sweet raspberries, which appear to be a little artificial. There is also a light woody taste that makes me think it will be from the seeds of the fruit. Mouthfeel is sweet and sticky. Aftertaste is sweet, but dry. Nearing the end, this beer is starting to become more like a kriek than an artificial, sweet fruit beer and drinkability improves."
"D: Fun to try, good berry flavor, almost more fruit drink than beer. Gets to be a little too much towards the end and ABV, at nearly 7%, isn't conducive to having much more than one glass. I'll bet this could be used in some interesting recipes, desserts in particular. Glad to have tried it and worthy picking one up if you see it. Thanks again, Jeremiah."
"I bought this beer because I was interested in comparing this to Dogfish's Fort and, of course, I enjoy many of Founder's beers. Upon popping the bottle cap, I immediately smelled a rasberry field which was very pleasant. Upon pouring the beer, I noticed the deep rasberry hue. It was very heady, which lead me to believe that it was getting a little old. Mind you, I only bought a bottle from the store and it doesn't have the born on date on the bottle, so I have no idea if it's getting up there in months. The smell was very rasberry and also a little sharp. My first taste was again very heady and somewhat tangy. I didn't get a lot of hops out of this beer and to me it was somewhat wit-like because it had a dryness to it. Predominant taste was rasberries. I also paired it with Ceviche which wasn't a bad pairing. Overall, it wasn't really balanced, it was very heady to the last drop and I'm still tasting it hours later. I may try this again because I have a feeling the beer was a little old and it should have been colder."
"Tastes just the same. The raspberries dominate all. It is quite refereshing, crisp and clean, with a lingering fruity, slightly acidic aftertaste. I can imagine sipping this by a bonfire on a warm night after cutting the grass. Quite refreshing."
"Pours a brilliant ruby color with a short head that fades quickly to a rim. Smell is of beautiful fresh raspberries and a touch of malt in the finish. taste is very refreshing, but a tad light, and it crys out for some more tartness. Nice ripe raspberries, a touch of astingency, and a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to light and quite quenching. Very drinkable on a hot day."
"SECOND TRIAL: Bottle from Breeze-Thru. This is a very nice fruit beer. Not something I'd want to drink on a regular basis, but definitely nice. It pours a nice rich red with very little head on it. The smell is fresh raspberries, as is the taste. There's not the same sourness that occurs in a lot of raspberry lambics (which makes sense because I'm pretty sure they don't spontaneously ferment this), but there is some nice, light tartness. The finish has a lingering fruitiness that makes this beer easy to sip away at. Despite this, I probably couldn't have more than one at a time (I don't think that finishing a six pack of these would sit well with my stomach). Overall a well done fruit beer that's perfect as an every-so-often brew."
"Would pair well with a dessert. The women will like this as well, even though this is more a manly fruit beer than most."
"App - 4.5, Smell - 4.5, Taste - 3, Mouth - 3.5, Drinkability - 3"
"The color of this beer was a very unapealing pink/red. The taste of the beer was very bitter and sour (not in a good way). The aroma was not strong enough for a fruit beer like this. I have had many other rasberry beers that were better than this."
"Since a six pack of this brew is so damn expensive at my local packy (by the way the only one I have ever seen it at) I decided I'de pick up a single 12 ouncer to see if it was worth picking up the whole thing. Anyway, poured into a Triple Eight Vodka sampler glass (associated with Cisco brewery). Coloration was reddish, with a pink head that faded quickly. Just looking at the head fading made me think that this is one really carbonated beer. Aroma was definitely filled with rasberry, but I could also almost smell the vine that they came off of. The earth factor gave it a more realistic fruit beer characteristic I think. Taste was of tart rasberries, more green earth tastes. It sort of reminded me of rubarb pie in a way (guess that is appropriate considering the title). Mouthfeel was relatively light in body, but very easy to drink. Most of the time when I have Founders beers, I can immediately tell that it is one of theirs. If I was to do a blind sampling of this one however, I would have never guessed it came from Founders. Most of the time when I try fruit beers, they have a generic taste to them, but this one delivered in the end. By no means one of Founders best offerings, but I think i'de try it again."
"Poured out a ruby red, with a pink tinted head. The head was large dissipated quickly. No real noticeable lacing. Aroma of raspberry, with some lime citrus character and sugar. Flavor of mild raspberry, cane sugar, citrus, with a tart finish. Mouthfeel is effervescent, medium bodied and carbonation. Some dryness lingerings in the finish with the tartness. Overall it is a nice fruit beer. Easy drinking, with a lot of raspberry flavor."
"D - Very easy to drink, the tart may become a little bit overbearing but overall good."
"Fruit beers aren't really my thing, but this one is actually pretty decent. I wouldn't go out of my way to get any more, but I wouldn't turn one down eiher."
"Small, tight, violet-white head sits atop a dark cherry body. Tart raspberry and cherry, sourish apple skins, sweet candy (cherry pixie stix?). Interesting aroma. Ripe raspberries and cherries at the forefront. Sugary at first then turning tart and juicy. mellow malt backbone provides a nice platform. It tastes like they put a ton of fruit in here! I like that. Tart, acidic finish. Moderate body with a mellow feel. Not as effervescent as other raspberry beers I've had. Nice job on a unique beer."
"Feel is undercarbonated and restrained which adds to the drinkability. Almost juice like and clocking in at 7.0% is quite a trick. A well built fruit beer. Thanks SkinnyElvis."
"On tap at brewpub. I'm not a fan of fruit beers, and have found peach and blueberry brews acceptable---not not repeatable. However, this dark pink brew had an exceptional rasberry smell and taste, with the necessary malt and hops, to make it a beer and not a soda pop! I will buy again."
"This is like no other beer that I have had. Its rich almost ruby red is georgous and its fresh berry smell is suprising. It is quite sweet, yet dry, with a moderatly light mouthfeel. This is not in my opinion a beer just to tip back one after another, but very very nice."
"This is definately one of the most authoritative, freshest tasting fruit beers I have ever tasted....there is nothing synthetic about the ample berry flavors and it rides on a substantial malt spine to carry the whole thing off....well done!"
"Founder's makes some awesome beers, and I'm immediately partial to this one because of their reputation for delicious unique beers. Even so, this raspberry brew is a treat. Cheers! :-o"
"Drinkability: A good fruit beer. So many taste like sugar water, this preserves the tart/sour flavor of true raspberries. The only detractor is that having several of something this tart might start to build in your mouth after awhile. Overall, I like it. I will definitely grab more next time I see it around."
"Unquestionably, the best aspect of this beer was its beautiful, deep, dark pink color. It arrived with no head, but instead, just a white ring around the edge of the glass. The nose was unmistakably of raspberry. The mouthfeel was light to medium with lots of raspberry flavor in the mouth. The finish was dry, but not intensely so. Jonathan let me try some of his Blushing Monk to compare, but the tart dryness was too much."
"In many ways, this reminded me of the Lindemans Framboise. I think the similarities between these two beers are plentiful, making me even further question if the Lindemans Framboise is a true Lambic or a Fruit Beer. Nevertheless, this brew is original, extremely fruity and easy to drink."
"Pours a slightly hazy reddish color, with an interesting light pink foamy head. The head disappears very quick. Raspberry, fruity, and winey aroma. Slightly tart and sweet raspberry flavor. Finishes a bit harsh, as if something is not quite right. It became better as it warmed slightly. Not too sweet, might use a bit of sourness. Light body, but not overly carbonated. Interesting, and refreshing."
"D: Not very ""beery"" (to use a much disliked term), but this beer is what it is. A very good fruit beer. If you're into that sort of thing, go get some, and you won't be disappointed."
"This was tart and citric, but not overpowering or vinegar-like. The fruit gives it a wine-like charactor. I don't think Rubaeus was incredibly complex, but I found it quite refreshing."
"Interesting offering but not one I will likely buy again."
"I was on a fruit beer kick today! The Rubaeus was my fourth fruit beer of the day and I have to say it was impressive! Poured from the bottle, it was a deep opaque brown with reddish tones. It smells of a strong, sweet rasperry, an almost syrupy smell. It tastes of a strong raspberry flavor but the sourness very nicely balances the fruity sweetness! The flavor was delicious and refreshing. It was smooth through the entire glass. This was a thoroughly enjoyable finish to the day."
"This is a top-notch summer brew that, as I understand it, was brewed with the intention of 'dethroning' the American pale wheat ale as the unquestioned king of easy-drinking Summer styles. Rubaeus makes a good case that APWAs should play second fiddle to other, more challenging and equally refreshing summer styles--saisons, kolschs, or, in this case, a full-bodied fruit beer. Highly recommended."
"Founders is a great brewery but this isn't even what I would call beer. Your wine cooler drinking girlfriend might like this."
"Overall the flavor isn't bad, but has absolutely no beer qualities, taste as much like beer as the Smirnoffs, Bacardi's, and Bartles and James of the world. I will avoid this one. The first let down I have had from founders."
"Pours from the bottle a reddish copper hue with a small offwhite head that quickly falls into a small ring. Some patchy lacing. Aroma is malty caramel and fresh raspberry. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and light medium bodied. Taste is tart raspberries and malty caramel and toffee. Not hint of the 6.9 % abv here. No hops presence. The raspberry tastes a bit artificial, but is much better than most of its ilk. A refreshing and tasty fruit beer that is much better than most American efforts."
"The drinkability is pretty good. This is a tasty drink that would go down nice on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability was very nice. This one makes a good summer refresher and could be a nice session beer if you have the extra cash in your wallet."
"drinkability: pretty high"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a ruby red color. Very effervescent with a white soda pop foam that dissapates to nothing. Aromas are mostly filled with raspberries, some biscuit malt, and a little alcohol. Hmm, flavor is super sticky, super sweet and basically an alcoholic raspberry syrup. Hops aren't particularly detected, nor are any malts used. Carbonation is too low; I feel a fruit beer should be crisp and light. This is quite a dissapointment, I expected something better. Alcohol and raspberry Italian soda, move on."
"D: An enjoyable beer. Best served cold."
"Pours a bright Kool-aid red with hardly any head by the time it got to the table. It smelled very sweet, a small hint of hops, but mostly rasberry. Tastes like rasberry Kool-aid, the only reason I knew it was beer was for the alcohol. I was least impressed with this beer although it does have its own merits. Maybe I will try this from a bottle, but after having some of the strongest offerings from Founders, this one just couldn't hold up. A decent beer worth trying if you are into the fruit beers."
"A beautiful deep rusty red, with a huge foamy head. Nose is super-sweet rasberry. Taste is very tart at first, giving way to a heavily carbonated sweet rasberry flavor, complete with seeds. A very interesting beer (although not very beer-like). Perhaps too sugary-sweet to drink too many in one sitting. It's reminiscent of a sparkling rasberry juice. Alcohol is very well hidden, it's deceptive."
"12 oz bottle pours a pinkish-red color with a small white head that doesn't last long, leaves some lacing in my glass. Fruity raspberry kool-aid aromas, sweet, tart and sour raspberry flavors. Medium bodied with a spritzy, seltzer like mouthfeel, finishes sour. Unique and flavorful, gets even better as it warms."
"Tasting notes:(in addition to sour cherries/raspberries would be some real woody maltiness)"
"Drinkability: Excellent! This goes down very easy, maybe a little too easy. In fact, I found myself downing three of these in one sitting the other day. A very good spring or summer beer."
"A wonderfully done fruit beer, amongst the best I've had. Despite this it still has that ""wine-cooler taste"" that may shy some people away, especially when you could buy a raspberry wine-cooler for cheaper. Still, Founder's delivers on their promise of making kick-ass beer. What style haven't they conquered yet? Hrmmm...Imperial Rye Dopplebock. I would drink that!"
"D - As with many fruit beers, I could see this working nicely as a dessert beer and pairing nicely with a variety of desserts, from chocolate to ice cream. Alcohol is fairly high for a non-stout fruit beer, but it is well hidden."
"Drinkability -- It's different, that's for sure. I'm having a hard time finishing the bottle. It's just a little too sweet and tart for my taste."
"Mouthfeel- The carbonation allows for a pleasant and refreshing tonic water beer. Good for deserts and night caps. Especially with the ladies."
"Overall, Rubaeus is an excellent spring or summer choice for beer lovers who happen to also like raspberries. I think the new Blushing Monk at the tap room outshines it (based on the heavier flavour due to increased fruit content) but Rubaeus is a smoother drinking beer and still maintains a lot of the things I like about its bigger brother. All of this said, I generally have a fair bit of Rubaeus throughout the year because it tastes wonderful with the nitro tap Oatmeal stout stacked on top of it. Just one more reason to visit Founders again, and soon."
"Wine like looking brew, deep amber red, with bright ruby highlights. A thin off white head with pinkish highlights forms, but not for long, leaving very spotty lacing. At first there was some chill haze, but quickly became crystal clear as it warmed. Not heavy on aromas, mostly rasberries and malt. Smells kinda like a Jolly Rancher candy. Taste mimics the smell, not as sweet as other fruit beers I've tried, but good. Finishes with a nice tartness on the tongue. There is some bitterness in there too, very faint. Decent amount of carbonation and medium bodied, make this fruit beer pretty damn easy too drink. A good Spring time sipper from Founder's!"
"It is what it is. Sort of the session beer version of Dogfish head's fort. Not quite a lambic, but could be nice paired with chocolate."
"On a warm day I could drink quite a number of these. Tasting great after just mowing the yard."
"Other than this beer being on the sweet side, I found it rather enjoyable."
"D - A good fruit beer that would probably be even better on a hot day."
"Raspberry juice in color with a small and quickly diminishing head. Medicinal fruit aroma, raspberry mainly, but a hint of cherry as well, with light hints of malt and hops barely showing through the fruit aroma. Flavor is overwhelming with raspberry and although it is quite vibrant, I can¬ít say I enjoy the malt and hop combo. Light caramel and cookie-like malt is present on the palate as well. Overall, I found it to be a nice alternative to American wheat beer"
"overall a solid raspberry fruit beer. drinks easily enough and is satisfying for what it is."
"This beer pours a deep, cloudy pinkish-red. The head is out-of-control to the point that pouring it is very difficult. I will give this beer the benefit of the doubt, even though its a bit sweet for my liking, because it seems to really capture the essence of rasperries. It is sweet and tart, with a sour finish. It is pretty full-bodied and with a creamy mouthfeel. Definitely worth a try, but I can't imagine drinking this one regularly."
"Drinkability - tasty but not one I'd go for generally."
"Founders does it again, this offering poured a dark red body with a huge tinted head even with a soft pour. The body is fully carbonated, the aroma is fresh ripe raspberry, green apple, horse blanket, wheat, peppery spice, similar to aroma of a dry fruit wine. The taste starts sour, not as powerful as a lambic but very suttle. It also has a sweet tart chalky mouthfeel. The raspberry taste is very apparent, some sweetness in there for balance. The carbonation is perfect for a refreshing clean feel on the palate. This is a fantastic fruit beer, I couldn't drink it all night but it would be a perfect after dinner drink."
"On-tap at the tap room in Grand Rapids. This one is a dark ruby red colour with an off-white pink-tinged head of foam that held up pretty nicely. Aromas of artificial raspberries and booze as well as some earthy/musty hints way in the background. Taste is cookie malts with a nice boozy raspberry syrup sort of taste. Drinkability is good, although the mouthfeel is a little coating and overcarbonated. A decent enough, higher abv fruit beer. Scarily many of the regulars were mixing this in half and halfs with the breakfast stout, imperial stout, and even devil dancer!"
"-UF"
"Pours a five-finger+ light pink head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Cloudy red/amber color. Strong rasberry nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Starts with a strong sweet raspberry flavor that stays right to the finish, hops and malts are way in the background. $2.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Drinkability is fine but nothing special."
"Not really that drinkable, but remarkable and 'must-try' in all regards."
"Pretty good, especially for being a fruit beer. Fruit flavor isn't overbearing, and the tartness of the raspberries only works with the beery qualities. I'd had this beer on my radar for a bit, and I have to thank Uncle Flip again for sending it to me. I like Founders' brews, and I had to see what they did with a fruit beer. Everything I expected. Good stuff."
"Usually I don't care for fruit beers. This one is an exeception. Its an excellent beer."
"This beer is drinkable but I am not overly impressed. I mean, it is what it is. Sure, it is a tasty fruity beer. Hell, it is even a fruit beer with balls. I could see this beer working in the right circumstances. I bet this would kick ass with a big green salad with a fruity vinaigrette dressing. Oh yeah! When all is said and done, this is a tasty beer but it just doesn¬ít wow me. I would like the raspberries to be richer¬Ö I like the fact the malt is accounted for however. Close. Very close to greatness. This sample was provided by BuckeyeNation. Thank you very much!"
"It's a bit tingly, like pink champagne. A light to medium body feel in the mouth. Very drinkable and most enjoyable. Wish I had another."
"Bottle: Poured a dark pink color ale with a nice bubbly pink head with average retention. Aroma of pure raspberry is of pure enjoyment (I was a bit scare at first that this would be another chemically induced fruit beer). Taste is refreshing and raspberry totally dominate by bringing a balance between sweetness and tart. Alcohol is well hidden. Very well done for a style that comport to many misses."
"Drinkability: Despite the not-so-great mouthfeel this beer is very drinkable. It is sweet and fruity with some hop to balance out the mad sweetness. I'd recommend trying it at the very least. It make a good dessert beer all by itself."
"from the bottle. poured a meduim cherry to raspberry, with a big foamy pink head that left some good lacing. aroma, raspberries, yeast, citrus, fruity. flavor, like a wine cooler, raspberries, tart with some sweetness ( like a sweet tart). would be a good summer beer"
"Beet/pomegranate colored with a purplish head that rises up quickly and sinks down low. Sweet and tangy aroma of raspberry. Flavor is a sweet and tangy raspberry right upfront, with a dry sweet-tart finish. Raspberry flavor lingers long on the palette. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, very satisfying, with a crisp finish. I'm having trouble picking out any other flavors, the raspberry is so all-encompassing. Tasty beer, but a bit low on the drinkability scale for me due to the shock and awe of the raspberry flavor throughout the glass. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sharing."
"The body is a pinkish red with a nice size light pink foamy head. Some lace was left coating the glass. Tart fruit notes, raspberries and some other fruits. Some sweetness to it as well. Overall a pretty strong aroma. Flavor starts off with a big of fruit that is tart and sweet. Raspberries are noticeable as are other sweet malty notes. Ends with a lightly sour finish. Nice but not too much too it. Medium body with a bubbly feel to it. A bit refreshing as well. Pretty good and easy drinking. A nice fruit beer for the summertime."
"Decent beer certainly won't turn me on to the world of fruit/veggie beers. Might be a good way to introduce your girl to craft beer."
"Overall, very good. Drinkability is high, for the style. I would be happy with just 1 or 2, especially in the summer season. My wife, however, loving fruit beers, would probably drink these all night."
"This is what a berry beer should be. Assertive raspberry flavor that's not cloying at all. The 6.9% abv give this beer some punch. Nicely done!"
"Pours pinkishly copper with a humungous head of tiny popping bubbles. Smell is mostly raspberry. They definitely used raspberries in this. There is some bready malt underneath and a little alcohol. Taste is sugary sweet on the tip of the tongue and very raspberry tasting. As you swallow, the taste morphs into a very tart raspberry finish. As in the smell, there is some maltiness and alcohol underneath for sure, but they blend together with the raspberry well. The finish is clean and crisp with the raspberry lingering for a couple seconds. This is probably one of the most carbonated beers I have tried, which works well for the style and prevents it from tasting like raspberry syrup after awhile like the New Glarus beers, though the raspberry flavor isn't as in your face as the Raspberry Tart either, which I like. Very nicely done. I could definitely drink a few bottles."
"Damn, this beer near killed me when I opened it. A loud pop like a .22 rimfire. Don't know why or how. Anyway, so upon pouring, the carbonation rears it's head and i'm left with 4 inches of foam, and 1 inch of beer. Ok... Um, this is different. Finally it cooled off and I was able to pour it and really get into it. Dark raspberry red color with high carbonation. Major foamy head was present. Aromas of raspberries and some malt with a touch of sweet alcohol. Taste is exceptional. Right up a the fruit beer alley; flavors of raspberries, strawberries, malt, sweet hops and alcohol blend in fantastic harmony. Tartness is present yet not overpowering, adding to the presentation of the flavors. Sour finish is smooth and slightly warming. Mouthfeel is light and airey, not watery or sticky like some other fruit beers. This beer has a high level of drinkability, as this could be enjoyed year round, but more so in the summer. Highly recommended beer for this unique style. If you want raspberries in your beer, look to this, not a rasberry eisbock."
"Great fruit beer. I typically prefer a little more carbonation, but still very good. Rasberry flavor was very balanced with the beer. Comparable to some of the Belgian Lambics. If you've never been to Founders, it's definitely worth the trip. Come thirsty, but not hungry because they don't serve any food."
"The taste is something different all together. What's actually in here is not like a roasty stout, but somewhat like a dopplebock in the malt. The raspberry is bitter and tart. Fully tastes like a raspberry. It adds a long, tart taste. Not very sweet. It's in there, but I more expected a Belgium level of sweet. The more I drink, the more I like the balance. It bubbles up into my nose. Very nice. Not at all what I would have expected. It's very unique. A good drink to go with a salad I think. Or maybe a sorbet. The roasted malt and lack of sweet make it fit for a meal. But the raspberry makes me want to call it dessert like a lambic. Not close to a lambic at all. Pretty darn good."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 5"" blush-hued head over the 1/2"" of raspberry-tinged amber brew. Head fades very slowly, I had dinner while it receded, with heavy, frothy lacing as expected with such a head. Aroma is something to behold, effervescent raspberries dominant. Taste is the same berries upfront, mellows with some malt body, and then closes with a bit of a sour tinge. Mouthfeel is not quite as smooth as I had hoped/expected, and seemed a bit over-carbonated, but still not bad. Drinkability was somewhat limited by how long it took to get in the glass. Not a bad fruit brew, but I've had better."
"Either I had a funky glass or this stuff is seriously pressurized, cuz when I popped the cap on this one, let's just say science fair volcano here. After the geological event subsided, I was left with an attractive fuscia colored beer with a light pink head. Paris Hilton would be proud. The nose is the winner here, a bouquet of sweet fresh raspberries. The taste, while complex, didn't sit with me quite as well. A transition from cloyingly sweet to puckeringly tart left my palate exhausted, with a slight lingering ""beer"" aftertaste. Kinda reminded me of the sparkling juice I used to have to drink on new year's eve when I was young. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, but the super sweet/super tart thing made this a one at a timer for me. A nice fruit beer here, but I've had better."
"Rubaeus is another quality offering from a brewery that makes a habit of brewing quality offerings. It's an excellent fruit beer that would be even better if it contained a tad more sweetness. Other brewers take note: this is how it's done."
"clear.. or maybe cloudy.. essential red pour. two finger soapy foam of an off white coloration.. perhaps a light sprinkling of pinkness to it. what i suspect might be raspberry esters wafting from the glass, upon further inspection, seems to be more of a berry-flavored 7-UP thing happening. light botanical hops masquerade as berry stem, or something, in the aroma. unique fruit beer aromawise. initial sip is lindeman's sucrose-laden fruit sweetness with a burst of booze. this beer is a sipper that wants to be a thirst quencher, making for dangerous possibilities at nearly 7%. fruit soda meets sparkling wine with a beery nuttiness. crazy. despite my lack of ability to nail the style, it seems well balanced. a guilty panty-dropping pleasure."
"This beer pours out purple with a huge pink head. The aroma is real raspberries with toasted malt, and a little distracting sourness. The flavor is a wheat beer body with lots of raspberries. The berries taste good, the right combination of tart and sweet. I did not like the yeast in this beer. It has a sour taste that's noticable even with all the raspberries. Mouthfeel is medium. I don't think I could drink many of these in a session. Better than most fruit beers, but nothing extraordinary."
"Pours a heavenly ruby red with massive head that slowly dissipates to leave a thin covering of pink bubbles.. Smells of sweet raspberries, extremely carbonated, tastes of real raspberries although not as sweet as the nose suggested.. more of a tart raspberry flavor. The taste is rather clean and crisp, very approachable for even the non fruit/lambic beer fan.. can see this as being a good gateway beer to fruit/lambics as the fruit flavors are not overpowering.. will have to recommend this one to my friends that usually shy away from these styles."
"Moderate to light mouthfeel. Unimpressive but I don't see anything fuller helping this one out. This could be a good hot day beer, or a good one to pair with poultry."
"Thanks for yet another Founders brew cokes."
"I'm ordering a case from my distributor tomorrow and will try out on my adventuresome Bud drinkers next week and will report back."
"Red grapefruit colour, hazy, topped by white foam with a pink cast. Smells like... raspberries! But still definitely beer. There's a bit of maltiness that comes through in the aroma. Starts with a little malty sweetness, but that's quickly overshadowed by a tart flavour that's not overly acidic. Dry overall with some fruity sweetness throughout. Slightly syrupy texture and ample carbonation. Long finish that tastes like you just finished eating some raspberries. Quite a nice fruit beer, not overly sweet with a good acidity level."
"Saw this at Downtown Wine and Spirits yesterday and bought a few bottles. Was disapointed that it was so carbonated upon initial pouring, not sure why it just immediately came out of the bottle and overflowed my glas. so much. There's a good deal left though, so here goes. Actually left pink cotton candy floss on the sides of my glass. Aroma is maybe it's best feature, this one really smells like fresh raspberries. Tastewise, I guess I expected more....I think the rasberries only show themselves in the finish. Upfront there's some malt, and a strange yeastiness (anything wild at all in this one??). It does appear to be unfiltered as colorwise, it is cloudy/dusty raspberry in color. It is tart, I don't really find it that sweet at all. Mouthfeel isn't bad."
"Definitely one of the best Fruit Beers I have tried. Bright red color with a thick and lasting pink head. Nice coating of lace too. The sweetness that makes a lot of fruit beers too cloying for me seems to be tempered by the higher-than-usual ABV. Super tart raspberry flavoring with a bit of spice and hops. The finish is fruity and bubbly, with a lingering aftertaste of raspberry. I don¬ít say this often about Fruit Beers but I will surely have this one again."

"Another fine offering from Founders...a nice addition to my latest trade."
"Drinkability and Notes ¬ñ This is an ok fruit beer, too much fruit for my taste and not enough beer flavor. If you have ever had Purple Haze from Abita, this is much better, but a similar beer. All in all not a bad beer if you have been drinking too many beers and want a major flavor change, or if you just plain hate the flavor of beer."
"Sl√§inte!"
"D- This beer has the big nose of a great raspberry beer but it is missing the flavor. It was really over-carbonated but I don't think that affected the flavor much. It was missing flavors like fresh berries or malt or hops to balance. It just needs something besides sour."
"The mouthfeel ranks a little higher than medium-bodied, which I didnt expect. Very outstanding balanced on the way down. This one is good, but drinking more than one would be too sweet and too much berry overload. Not really my style, but still definitly worth a try. Cheers!"
"drinkability is somewhat above reproach; it goes down good but not great. could drink a few, but would leave me wanting something better. maybe i'm just getting spoiled...."
"Pours pinkish clear in color leaving a head which overfills the glass then quickly calms down to a film. Looks very carbonated. Smell is of raspberries and toilet water(?). Extremely tart with a punch that leaves a very sweet and tart aftertaste. Carbonation is much less than it appears. A smooth creamy mouthfeel that is becoming the trademark of Founders' products. After a sip it just sort of melts in the mouth with no prickly carbonation. Not syrupy or overly sweet. More tart than sweet. Leaves a tart sensation on the tongue and the liquid disappears. Very drinkable for a 6.9% and fruit beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a rolling wall of dense carbonation. Quite effervescent. An easy drinking beer that would go down nicely poolside on a hot day. Another good one from Founders and a nice change of pace. Well worth a try."
"The beer pours a deep ruby color with a 3 finger pink head that falls slowly, leaving a lot of lace behind. The nose is big with sweet raspberry with a wheaty beer backbone behind it. I'm not a big fan of the strong wheaty notes. The flavor is also very wheaty. The raspberry is less strong. The flavor is really lacking any gusto. The feel is thick and full, slightly creamy with a moderate carbonation. I get a blast of heat in my belly from the alcohol. The beer is pretty drinkable. The flavor is just missing something in my book."
"Pours a red/pink color with a tall head that falls slowly and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is all fresh raspberries. I can't get much else, but it smells really good. The flavor has a certain emptyness to it across the tongue. Has nice raspberry flavor at the first taste and on the finish, but there's really nothing in the middle. Very odd. Tasty too, but odd. The body has a certain thickness, as if from oats or wheat. Drinkability is very good. Tasty brew."
"This certainly pulls no punches. It's unabashed raspberries. Not so out-of-sorts as to be compared with things like Leinies Berry Weiss. The attention to the malt end helps elude such a fate. But the manic sugars and lightly cloying nature would prohibit me from drinking more than one. Fans of Lindeman's Framboise or New Glarus Raspberry tart will find a like minded brew. But for me, the wine-cooler element seems underlined here."
"Dark purply red, with a huge pale purple head that fell to a 1/4 inch table of medium-bubbled foam. Nose is dominated by fruit reminding me of a frambose lambic without any funkiness. Taste is raspberries, slightly watery, with a touch of berry seed flavor in the finish. Mouthfeel was a thin. There isn't much balance to this beer. The alcohol is not present in the taste or mouthfeel. Easy to drink, but one would be enough. Non-beer drinkers might enjoy trying this."
"Logical raspberry aromas arise from a burned burgundy-colored liquid. Fudge and caramel sundae topping and tootsie roll aromas beef up the bouquet considerably. It's a dry moutful of dusty red fruit tannin, dense malt weight (a Founders signature) and vibrant raspberry fruit flavors. A dry, crusty caramel-flavored foundation is obvious. A streak of sweet alcohol flavor joins the finish. Punctuated fruit acidity and bitterness on the finish roughly counterweigh the sweet, plump elements. Another parade of good tasting ingredients from Founders. While it is impeccably crafted and well-proportioned, there are no surpises here. Nothing happens to the raspberry and slo-poke flavors on their way to an admirably dry finish. Though this beer may be a prescription for boredom, the brewers should be praised for their craftsmanship, skill and market sensibility."
"Moderately thick, dense, light pink colored head leaves a short sheet of lace. Hazy dark mahongany colored beer with a ruby hue. Raspberry jam aroma with a toasted malt base; almost like a raspberry poptart. Fresh raspberry flavor throughout mixed with mild doughy malt flavor. It finishes just barely tart. Light, fairly crisp mouthfeel. It's like somebody took a piece of toast with raspberry jam and liquified it. I'm usually not a big fruit beer fan, but this one is different from the rest. Thanks to malty for another great brew."
"This summer offering from Founder's really surprised me. Fruit beers are usually not too great and they are usually either super sweet or super tart, balance is not what I think of when I think of fruit beers. But this had it. Pours an amberish, pinkish girly looking color. A few bubbles to the top with a fizzy pink head. Lots of lacing though. Aroma is all raspberries, I can't get past the raspberries, they smell really fresh though. Taste starts out a little sweet, too sweet but it's not all raspberry sweetness. There's a malty sweetness in there that pushes the envelope a little too much. Right when I'm ready to write this one off though a nice super tart flavor hits me which is most definitely the raspberries in their full effect. A yeasty, alcohol dryness finishes this beer off. Great complexity and balance but I still liked their Raspberry Pale Ale on tap a little better."
"Pours a nice cloudy red color and extremely carbonation and nice amount of head and but it fades after a minute or two to basically nothing. It almost looks like pop (soda if your not from Michigan :-) ). Smell is quite strong and that of raspberries, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is not as carbonated as I expected but is pleasing and the taste is a little tart and sour. Drinkability is above average and for fruit beer is pretty good."
"I've had very few good fruit beers, and this is one of them. For those who can't handle the over-the-top fruit mimicry done by New Glarus (which I think are excellent), this might be right up your alley. Fruit flavor is nicely balanced and allows the inner beer shine through just enough. Well suited for a (expensive) fruit beer session. Very tasty, and I'm not surprised one bit. Founders has impressed me yet again."
"Pours a wonderful fairly clear pink color with a fizzy pink carbonated head. Smell is mainly raspberries, tart, but with some sugary notes present as well. Taste is somewhat malty, some grainy notes are present in the background, but the tart raspberry flavor shines here. The raspberry flavor is definitely real, not sickly and artificial tasting like most fruit flavored brews. This is very nice on the mouth, smooth as can be. Their is a different aftertaste here I cannot put my finger on. Overall all a very nice fruit brew that is very drinkable, but I wonder if I could handle drinking more than 2 of these at a time. Nicely put together Founders."
