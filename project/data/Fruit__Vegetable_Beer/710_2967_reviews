"Way too sweet; more like fruit juice."
"I like this more than I should."
""
"I did not enjoy this at all..I always see this beer but never actually see anybody buy it and now I know why..way too sweet! Maybe someone goin from wine coolers to beer might enjoy this !"
""
""
"So, so, so super sweet!"
"Its too sweet for a beer. Its beer candy hahaha. Its pretty smooth but its too sweet when you want ""real"" beer. So it might be good for a beginner or to convert someone to trying beer if they like sweet drinks and liquor."
""
"I enjoy the fruity taste and the strong smell. Great in the summer."
""
"The fruitiness of this beer is almost juice-like. The very subtle hint of honey halps take some of the tart out.  There is very litfle actual beer taste.  This should be a big winner for lovers of fruit punch."
"Fruity and deliciously crispy. Perfect for a summer day around the pool."

"Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss brewed by Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, with an ABV of 4.70% This brew pours out a nice pink color with a nice white head.  Berry Weiss has a color all on it's own . The smell is sweet, with berry. You pick up on a hit of grains, malts, and hops. The taste is bitter, sweet. You pick up on the berries in this brew.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean. The berry taste is smooth and refreshing.  Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss has a nice balance to it there is nothing overpower in it. Overall I'm giving Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss a solid 4 out 5 .  I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market.  I would buy this brew again."
""
" It's better on tap though. Bottled or as good."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love Leinenkugel's for their ingenuity and originality.  I encourage experimentation.  I'm the first one in the pool.  But this just doesn't do it."
""
"I think all of Leinenkugels' fruit beers are the same: fruity and delicious, but leave you wishing they had something more distinguishing than which fruit is in this particular beer you're drinking at that moment."

"It was really sweet. More like a berry cider. No real taste of beer to speak of. Fizzy. Berry laden and sweet. Refreshing on a hot summer day, but I couldn't drink more than one."

"Pours to a white head and red grapefruit-like color. Aroma is mixed berries, pale wheat beer (the base beer aroma is strong with this one) and a hint of liquid antibiotic. Flavor is sweet, tart and fruity with a nice grainy background. Mouthfeel is light and surprisingly not syrupy. Overall a decent and economical choice for those who like raspberry flavored beers."

"DATE REVIEWED: May 10, 2014... GLASSWARE: Lindeman's flute... OCCASION: NFL draft, day three--building the future (again)... APPEARANCE: slightly hazy, slightly bubbly light amber body with reasonably creamy white head; lacing forms icicles... AROMA: immediate raspberry that evokes cough syrup and Valentine's candy hearts... PALATE: a chiasmused mullet in mouthfeel--fizzy party up front, swift, flat drop at the throat; refreshing but also awkwardly lingering...TASTE: cranberry, raspberry, and malty--not offensive; like an Italian soda but extra sweet due to the malt; refreshing, but undesirably tart...OVERALLL: this is at home on the deck in the heat, or at a party where the other beer choices are pedestrian...not sessionable, and not worth a close-up here...."

"Overall – From what I have tasted this is pretty much a wine cooler. If you want something very sweet and lower in alcohol this may be it, but if looking for something that tastes anything like a beer then you may want to stay away."

"Overall / Drinkability: I got this an extra at a beer tasting. When this particular beer is mixed with Leinenkugel's summer shandy it is a very nice combo. By itself, I can see why others in the room thought this was a wine cooler. Fruity and the beer gets lost in it all. I finished this bottle, but I don't think I would go for another, although I'll give it a slight increase in rating due to it being refreshing. Which I suppose is the whole point behind a shandy or radler during the summer. That fruit serves as a pick-me-up when its hot out and you want something to drink, but not to get drunk. This works on the grounds of slaking thirst and it's not awful, but it's awfully sweet and once done, I'm good and have no interest in another."

"I remember drinking this in college, thinking it would be an upgrade to the cheap crap I was drinking at the time. Boy, was I wrong. If you like the taste of Fruity Pebbles, this is the beer for you. Otherwise, I would steer clear of this one from Leiney's, as they have many other better options."
""
"Yeah, this really isn't my thing. Glad that I tried it just so I know to steer absolutely clear of it next time. It's like a poor man's version of The Soft Parade by Shorts. I'll pass on this one next time."

"Overall: The first drink or two is ok but even after that tasting I can already feel myself growing distant from the beer. I've heard of people mixing this beer half and half with other beers and I can understand why. It's simply overwhelming, if Leinenkugels could cut the taste in half I would be much more satisfied."

"Definitely not my style of 'beer', but Leiny's knows it's fruit beers. It is what it says: a light wheat beer with tons of berries from the ""northwoods of Wisconsin"". A step above a wine cooler, I guess."

"A really nice light fruity beer. Nothing too bad but also nothing absolutely fantastic. I picked up a six for those times when I just wanted something light and this definitely fits the bill. I didn't pour it out, so no comment on the head or the over all colour. The taste had just enough 'beer' to it to let me know it was a beer and not a wine cooler. Honestly, I think this is a beer that a lot of people (who normally wouldn't like) could come to enjoy. Will I get another six... sure, now that my girlfriend likes it and she's busting into some of my other exotic craft beers. :)"
"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a dark pink with a finger and a half worth of head. Interesting, to say the least. It smells exactly like a strawberry milkshake and is very appealing to anybody, even my girlfriend who typically doesn't enjoy any type of beer. The taste is of cherry 7up and that's about it. Not bad, But not really that great. While leaving it in the mouth, No additional flavors come through, it only feels like sparkling wine upon your tongue. Once again, interesting. Overall, This was a good "" beer "" however not something that I could drink a lot of."

"In europe aften called a girl beer, lots of guys drink it too. Refreshing beer, that is anything but a traditional beer. For that, yes, it's way too sweet."
""
""
"This is without a doubt one of the worst beers I have ever tried, It is not even worthy of a pour into any of my glassware lest the super sweet artificial flavors may forever taint my glassware, i would rather drink any other beer before this atrocity, The only way i was able to finish half the bottle(wich was left at my house after a cookout) was to pretend it was a wine cooler, wich it's taste more resembles....do not buy, do not drink for free"
""
"Overall: Alcoholic fruit juice, period. Mikes hard fruit juice basically."
""
""
""
"This stuff is absolute garbage! Each sip I took to write this review was painful and I can't wait til I'm done to pour this down the drain. What these brewers have to realize is that with fruity beers, less is more; its all about the balance. If you want to try a good example of this style, pick up some Founders cerise."

"O- Half way through this beer I almost forgot it was an actual beer. If you like juice drinks then this is for you. I might consider buying this for my girlfriend who is into Mikes Hard Lemonade and all that other fruity stuff. Not a bad beer, it just depends on what you like."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is average. Overall too sweet, and the fruity flavor makes it taste more like a wine cooler than beer. Not horrible to drink, but not very beer like either."
"Pretty amazing pink tinted hue going on, head was white with addition of berry juice and flavors it's pretty much a light cotton candy pink frothing thick head. Aroma has tart vinous berries, with an upfront acidic quality with raspberry/strawberry juice notes. Flavor is a mix of juicy fruit, tart berries, earthy citrus flavor it's actually well blended...I thought I would have hated it but it's actually like a decent alcopop at least flavorwise. Great tasting by beverage definition they're onto something here, this will sell. Mouthfeel effervescent carbonation is sturdy, I actually enjoyed the beer it's filled with flavor and berry notes. Lighter bodied in beer standards slightly dry acidity, nothing like a Belgian fruit ale, but damn good drinking fruit beer that I generally despise even when made by microbrewers. Overall, I'm not into these types of beer, but I like this one go ahead try it, you may actually enjoy it."

""

"Overall although very sweet it was a rather refreshing and tasty brew, but basically it dose not resemble any type of brew I have had so far..."

"I poured this beer into a glassit has no head and the body is a blush color body. The smell is fruity and berry. The taste is berry, sweet, and fruity, not a normal beer taste. The mouthfeel is, it is almost like arbor mist. Overall this is a ok beer."

"12 ounce bottle, there's a date of SEP 26 11 printed on it, but I have no idea if that's the bottled on or best by date. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a pinkish/amber color with a half inch light pink head. The head goes away quickly, and there isn't much lacing. The brew smells like berry fruit juice/drinks and grain. For the most part it tastes like it smells, it tastes like a mix of fruit juice, grainy malt and berry flavored carbonated water. The flavor isn't quite as artificial tasting as I was expecting, so that's a plus. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a little bit syrupy and is well carbonated. As far as fruit beers go, I'd have to say this is average all around. I've had better and I've had worse. I don't think I'd buy a 6 pack of this, but if someone gave me a bottle (a friend did give me this one) I wouldn't turn it down, either."
""
""
""
"the taste was everything you'd think, like a carbonated kool-aid mix, definetly not what a ber should ever taste like! in a way i enjoyed the carbonation, it's basicly the ONLY thing i did enjoy. Everyone has they're own taste in beer, but this wasn't mine."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was easy drinking, light and would probably be nice on a real hot day. Unfortunately though I just didn't think it was a very good beer. It was very sweet and sugary like a fruit punch and the fruity flavors felt very extracty to me. Would be a good beer to give to non-beer lovers though so I'm sure it has it's place and fans."
"a very interesting brew. pours a fruity purplish pinkish infused hazy gold color with a small bubbly head. smells like preserved fruit, sugary jams, and wheat. taste is better than i thought itd be, sweet like white sugar, like a spoonful of smuckers jelly, with a pleasant yeasty finish. this is not my favorite style of beer, but it is good for what it is. mouthfeel is thin and quenching, summery, drinkable. more than a couple of these might rot your teeth though."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties. It would be a good beer for a summer day."
"I’ve been known to squeeze a little lime in my Corona or Tecate. Once or twice I have even garnished a hefeweizen with a lemon slice, but that’s about where it ends. I like tuna, I like martinis, but I wouldn’t mix up a batch of tunatinis. I guess I’m just a fan of beer flavored beer."
"Overall Drinkability - Decent fruit beer."
"The Berry Weiss beer is a good fruit/veggie beer. The berries obviously dominate the smell and taste. The color was nice with decent white head. The mouthfeel was nice a light great for summertime libations. Although to sweet for me and I would not drink alot of this stuff."
"Really no redeeming quality to this 'beer', other than the fact its not absolutely terrible, it just kinda sucks."
"O: The sugary/sweetness keeps this beer from being very drinkable. I was happy enough to try it, but certainly did not want another one. I can see why some people might like this beer though."
"In my opinion this beer is great on a warm summer night or anytime during the summer. I work part-time at a beer distributor and have recommended this beer to customers and it seems to sell ok when we have it in stock. my friends also seem to enjoy it too."
"I know there will probably always be a market out there for this stuff but I don't know why. Not a Jacob Leinenkugel best. Probably their worst, IMHO."
"M. Like a soda in every way. Thin and watery."
"O: Not a beer I normally would reach for, but it was a refreshing choice for a 4th of July picnic where the weather was hazy hot and humid."
"Waaay sweeter than I expected...leaves a syrupy, fruity residue on the lips. Beery aspects of this beverage are almost completely lost to artificial-tasting sweet fruit juice. I have a soft spot for fruit beers, but this is difficult for me to finish. I dont know if a fresher sample would help, but I cant help but think the sweet, artificial berry flavor would still be overwhelming. As much as I hate the malt beverage cliche 'panty-dropper', that is what came to mind right off the bat for this atrocity."
"This offering was much too sweet for my liking. It reminded me more of a wine cooler than a beer. I would not want to try it again."
"O: Nothing about this is remotely complex, and reminds me more of a malt cooler than a beer. That being said, it is darn tasty and I could probably knock back a six-pack without thinking twice."
"O) I'm not opposed to fruit beers. This just wouldn't be my first choice. I mean, give me a good framboise or a kriek any day of the week."
"Overall, not a great exemplar of the style. Be a fruit beer, or be a weizen. Can't do both."
"Overall this is an enjoyable experience if you know what you're getting. I'm a crazy hophead with a sweet tooth too so this is a nice wat to mix things up, especially in the warmer months."
"I'm a girl and what can I say, I like fruity drinks from time to time. But I also enjoy an ice cold beer as well. This brew offers me a little bit of both. The smooth berry brew has come to be one of my personal favorites and I would recommend you give this a try if you're looking for little something that the typical hops and barley combo doesn't offer."
"This beer pours out as a slightly hazy purplish pink color with a white head that doesn't last very long. The smell is of sweet berries and some wheat in the back. The taste is basically a wine cooler. Very sweet berries up front that fades into a light wheat aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and not highly carbonated. It's ok if you like really sweet stuff. I'll drink it if it's around for free but that about all."
"Direct from the Leinie Lodge to my glass, the Crack & Glug produced two fingers of cotton candy, I mean cotton candy-like pink head with good retention. For you jaspers that wonder why it is so important to decant from CAN to a glass, the visuals on this one would be your answer. Pink beer! Like pink lemonade, including a slight haze. I am cuing up the theme to ""Pink Panther", ""F**kin' Perfect"" by Pink, and ""Comfortably Numb"" by Pink Floyd as musical accompaniment. The head disappeared fairly quickly, allowing me to get my nose deep into the pink. It smelled like ... wait for it ... raspberries! What did you think I was going to type? That scent came from the equally pink, but horribly nasty Bud Light Chelada. Shame on you! I was transported back to my paternal grandmother's backyard garden, where she had red raspberry bushes in abundance and as kids, we would raid those bushes like there was no tomorrow. Mouthfeel was soda pop fizzy and the natural flavors of blackberries and raspberries were prevalent on the tongue. It reminded me of those wine coolers of the early 1980's in terms of its tart sweetness and the fizziness. I hate to say it, but this was more of a beer for the G/F who might not dig some of the other beers in the cooler. Finish was very berry-like and it was not unpleasant, but one would probably be enough for this hophead."
"This was an enjoyable beer. It tasted kind of dry, rather like champagne with the flavoring of berries and just a hint of carbonation. It lacked an after taste and had very little hoppy flavor. This was a very good beer from Leinenkugel and I will be very happy to buy it again."
"Drinkabillity- overall i found this beer to beer very drinkable and enjoyable, not sure if something i could pound all night but certainly a rather unique and tasty beer offering, i think this beer would be very well like by alot of my friends that are even non beer drinkers which can be nice to have around for when they would be around, overall wound up finding myself pleasantly surprised by this one,"
"When I want beer, I do not give a Schlitz for Leinenkugel Berry Weiss. But when I want a light sparkling beverage, then I do give a Schlitz for Leinenkugel Berry Weiss."
"It isn't a complicated beer. If you're grabbing this one, you need to be prepared for perhaps the sweetest beer you've had in quite some time. I'll admit I did enjoy it as a change. Not every beer needs to be hyper bitter...this is a decent change-up."
"Once again, don't try it if you're not planning on enjoying a very sweet beer."
"Poours a reddish amber color with a thin head on it. Great cranberry scent that reminds me very much of Ocean Spray. Very strong cranberry taste as well. Drinks rather smooth and has a great taste. I can understand why many BA's rate this beer rather low as it doesn't taste anything like a beer and more like a cranberry malternative. No real beer taste here but I enjoyed it. Something great to try this summer!"
"O: Did not care for. Just way too much berry...off-putting."
"I enjoyed a few of these at a spring training game in Tempe, AZ. The beer was surprisingly decent for a fruity beer. The beer obviously had an aroma of sweetened berries, a purplish color wih no head, a sweet finish and surprisingly good taste. No carbonation like I thought there would be, and no aftertaste. Overall a decent beer If you get a chance to try it, you will be surprised."
"overall no. some of these i can get by with and make a pass, but this was just way off the mark. too light, too fruity, just a mess."
"From notes: Poured an orangish pinkish hue with white bubbly moderate head, and a light haze. Aromas are artificial berry, sugary and sweet with crystal light and fruit punch shining through largely. Initial is the same, light carbonation, and a sweet berry punch like feel. It really feel a lot of raspberry crystal light. Not very beer like, but this could have been much worse. A little sweet and cloying, clearly. But not awful."
"D: Sweet and light but comes across more like a wine cooler than a beer."
"Way too sweet and one-sided. Hardly a beer, honestly. Drinkability is tough with this kiddie beer."
"Sounded interesting in the store. Waited for a hot day for with this beer it seemed fitting. Yikes, wine cooler. Effervescent pour, clear gold with little or no head. Smelled of berries but not fresh, artificial. Tasted very crisp and refreshing, but to much and very much like a wine cooler. It was tart and fruity and really was not bad. Drinkable? Yes, no doubt. Wait for a sultry summer day."
"I'd say this is a nice drinkable beer and worth checking out for those that like fruit flavored beer."
"D: Can't handle more than one due to the sweetness. After visiting Leine's Chippewa Falls Brewery, I asked the tour guide, ""do people actually buy Berry Weiss?"" He responded, ""it's a huge hit with the ladies."""
"Pours pinkish/orange with small white head. Aroma of berrys, grapes, blueberry. Taste of blueberry , grapes, very fruity and sweet. Palate is light body, very bubbly carbonation. Reminds me of a wine cooler. Finish is very sweet. Did not like this beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a moderate caramelish color with maybe a hint of red. The nose is bright berries and a lot of sweetness. Cloying to start. The taste really gets in there with the sweetness and berry. Almost like beer juice. The feel is just too much with a lot of sugar. Way too much to drink more than a few ounces of; don't know how I did this in college."
"Drinkability- This beer is right about average it is decent but nothing to brag about"
"Drinkability - this brew is a little too sweet for me to endure in a beer, but much better-tasting than some beers of this same variety."
"Does your girlfriend just love wine coolers but you can't bring yourself to buy them? Buy her some Berry Weiss instead!"
"the taste i think is worse than the smell. took one drink and spit it out in the sink. tried to pawn of the open bottle onto my wife, who also took one drink and that was it. we dumped the rest of the bottle."
"I recommend trying this with some cheese and crackers... before the heavy stuff comes out."
"The mouth feel is pretty clean, crisp and dry. I understand that all of Leinie's regular offerings are produced as lagers this shows. Hardly any body to the beer at all. The carbonation level is on the higher side which to me help wash away all the sweetness. Drinkability is pretty low because of the sweetness. Out of the many times I've had this beer I always find the last half of the pint almost unbearable in the how sugary it tastes."
"D - Light alcohol fruit beer, refreshing and goes down easy."
"Pinkish-orange color with an off white head with poor retention and little lacing. Smells of artificial berries, definitely not a good sign. Tastes like artificial berry flavoring. Too sweet, and reminds me of Celis Raspberry, which was not good. Light bodied, thin, decent carbonation. I would say to avoid this one."
"This beer belongs in a category of Dessert Beers."
"The beer to drink when the beer you want is a slightly alcoholic berry soda."
"D: To much of a berry flavor. i could drink one... but would never buy again. after one beer, its really filling. i bought a six pack and i don't even want to drink the rest. it kind of taste like kool aid and vodka..."
"Pours a dark orange color, with some hints of purple (could be my imagination) and a frothy whiteish head. I get some berries in the aroma, and not a whole lot more. Taking my first drink of this one, I immediately get the feeling I am drinking a sickly, sweet berry flavored soda. Too much carbonation and too much fake berry flavors. Truly a horrible beer; I could not come close to finishing a bottle."
"D: probably would only drink one due to the sweetness of the beer but a good offering from leinenkugel. Sunset wheat is still my favorite from them."
"Taste - Sweet and berry, I found the flavor good in a guilty pleasure sort of way. Not very beer like but enjoyable. I'm not too sure how many of these I could drink."
"Drinkability: On a hot day I could have a couple, but this is kind of hard to finish on a cold day. It almost tastes more like a wine cooler. Sometimes the flavor is a bit too sweet. Leinies has way better beers in their offerings. Would not disgard this in their mix pack, but would never buy a six of it."
"I normally try to be gracious about beer, but this one's recipe needs to be scrubbed."
"Overall: Refreshing on cool to warm spring/fall afternoon. Definitely fits into Leinie's fruit obsession."
"Come on!!! This is not a science project. It is the most sessionable, high quality, berry beer you'll ever taste. This stuff is great for the price and for its main stream flavor. It's not too malty and it is definitely not cheap tasting. It's a quality berry flavored ale with mass appeal. If you like berry flavored anything, you'll love this. If not, don't try it!!!"
"D - I could see myself having one of these at most during a hot day. Quite frankly, this beer probably won't appeal to most people on this site because it's so dumbed down and basic. While I know this isn't one of Leinie's best sellers I have no doubt they do quite well with the casual beer drinkers in the summer time. I would probably go for just about any other Leinie's offering before I would grab this one."
"Leinie's is hard to characterize. A stepping stone to the real stuff, I suppose."
"*Leinenkugel BC recommends mixing HoneyWeiss with Berry Weiss, to create the 'HoneyBear'. We tried this, figuring it couldn't get any worse, and it actually essentially ended up tasting like Mike's Hard Lemonade, so yes, an improvement.*"
"I'm not a big fan of the Berry Weiss. It is an extremely rich and sweet beer (of course berry is the overwhelming flavor). It might be an alright dessert beer, but I have trouble drinking one bottle of it, it is just a little too fruity. I would only recommend this beer if you are looking for something very sweet to drink."
"I purchased this at a Hyvee in Omaha, Nebraska. The beer has a dark pink body with a white head. The aroma and taste are berries, berries, and more berries with some wheat thrown in. Mouthfeel is kinda light, but also crisp. This is the beer that got me out of malternatives, and will never go back. Very drinkable if you like fruity malt beverages that still can be called beer."
"Overall, a nice easy beer for those that don't love the taste of beer."
"This beer is certainly not for everyone and it definitely wasn't for me. If you have a sweet tooth for something like this, tho, go for it. It is highly drinkable and would be nice for drinking by the pool or perhaps paired with some food. Personally, I wont be buying it again."
"Overall- This is one of favorite beers to sit down to after a long day. The prevalent berry flavor makes this enjoyable for me, but I wouldn't want to drink more than a couple of these at a time."
"D: This is an OK beer, the ABV makes it sessionable, and could see myself potentially going for this one on a hot summer day. Other than that, nothing really stands out about this beer."
"Overall an interesting beer. Worth a try. Not good for a session beer unless you're a fan of malternatives. The sugary, acidity would affect my stomach."
"D: This seems much more like a flavored malt beverage à la Bacardi Razz or Smirnoff Ice. I can't in all honest opinion write an truthful review of this since I don't consider this to be a beer. Sure, it's drinkable, but where does the ""Weiss"" come into the equation?"
"Overall I used to get this by the case but now I tend to try better things. Really a good beer and I would agree that if your in the mood for a fruit beer and don't want too much sour crack open a Leine!"
"I had a bottle of this in the fridge from a tailgate party and thought I would give it a go. It pours a muted pink hue. I'd swear it was raspberry lemonade if I didn't know better. The aroma is rather promising. It smells super fruity. Lots of berries with a bit of sourness. The flavour is not good. There's a hint of berry with a malt overtone that finishes with a corn like after taste. It's as if you made a shandy with miller lite and pink lemonade. Sorry Leinies, not my cup of tea. Thankfully the Wisconsin faithful will pick up my slack when it comes to drinking this stuff."
"Wow is this really beer it almost taste like a smirnoff ice rasberry malt cooler. I find it one of the easiest things in the beer category to drink although it is so sweet it is almost a desert. Smell is like a cider almost. Mouthfeel is kind of bleh, not bubbly enough."
"Drinkability: It's okay, but it is just too sweet for me. The fruit flavors are very overpowering and it's just not something I could get again. I had one, and will probably only ever have one."
"It's better than the mess I imagine a totally macro effort at a fruit beer would be, but average as it is."
"(D)- A fun beer to have around for parties for people who dont like beer but will drink this :/ But nothing really great in my opinion. Reminds me of a wine cooler. I would much rather have something else than this anyways."
"Cheers!"
"The beer is quite drinkable. I'm a sucker for fruit beers, but there are some better ones on the market. I could drink a few of these under the right circumstances and would consider drinking it again. As long as it doesn't turn pink again."
"Drinkability rates low, cloyingly sweet, artificial berry taste, whats to like? I would reccommend this to a casual beer drinker, not a beer enthusiast who appreciates better beer."
"This one was hard to finish. As for the remaining five beers, I'm not sure when, or if, those will get finished."
"I can say for certain this the best fruit beer I've had to date. It looks like a slightly dark wheat with strong head. The fruit aroma is pleasant, not overbearing at all. The taste is fantastic! It's a natural flavor that is welcomed uniformly on the pallet and goes down super smooth. I'm definitely getting more of this stuff. Great job Chippewa Falls!"
"Dr. Yes, it goes down easy and actually tastes good for what it is. But one will do."
"The beer poured from the bottle a light opaque reddish color with golden tones. Minimal off-white head that did not last. The many carbonation bubbles stayed long after the head disappeared. As this is a berry beer, the berry smell is very strong, almost like a sugary fruit punch. The first taste is similar. It has a very strong berry flavor, similar to a berry soft drink, with an underlying alcohol flavor. It feels light and bubbly in your mouth. For those who like berry or fruit beers, the taste is palatable, but those who don't will definitely not like this beer. If you are opposed to fruit beers, the ""berry-ness"" is undeniably overwhelming."
"D- Very drinkable. I don't like them so I won't be drinking any more but I can see how somebody who likes them can knock a few back with ease."
"Final Decree: Save your money for Long Trail or Sam Adams versions of the berry wheat (or wit)."
"D: If you are looking for something that is very similar to a wine cooler, then this may be your thing. I can see why this would be included in a summer mixed case. Pretty drinkable for the style."
"This beer pours a pinkish rose color. It has an off color pink head that gives way to lacing. The smell is of fruit and not much else. The taste is straight fruit. It is like drinking fruity peebles with alcohol. The mouthfeel is dry. Overall the drinkability is low, it is a little much however, my girlfriend who doesn't like beer thought it was great."
"Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss is a cloudy, dusty rose colored brew with a thin, dense, pinkish head that has good retention and lacing. The aroma is of berries and sugar and fruit wine. It's medium bodied and sudsy, with a dry finish that's a little scratchy. It's quite sweet. The malt is almost unnoticeable. It tastes like sweet berry punch. Is this really beer?"
"Drinkability is average at best, I can see drink a few of these but the sweetness and the after taste gets old."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into sparse lacing. The aroma is fruit punch Hi-C. There is nothing remotely ""beery"" about it. The taste is much like the aroma, but not quite as sweet, yet still very sweet. The is also a lingering, annoying artificial flavoring aftertaste. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lively carbonation. It is nice to see Leinie's not going overboard with the carbonation like they usually do. Overall, this is more wine cooler than beer. I enjoy fruit beer when they are made with actual fruit. They one clearly is made for a lot of artificial flavorings which make it come across as an extremely processed product. I'm not a huge fan of processed homogenized products."
"D - Quintessential ""give a non-beer drinking girl a beer"" beer. When all I drank was Miller Lite, I loved this beer but honestly, I could have maybe one max now. This thing is so damn sweet it's outrageous. If I would rate this on my own personal taste, the score would be lower."
"Drinks ok, but sometimes the sweet taste makes it a tougher sip."
"Overall, this is a fruit beer, hard to find a good one out there, and well, looks like I didn't find it here either."
"If this is targeted toward women, I feel bad for the women and their taste buds--they will never know what beer tastes like. I know I have been hard on this beer(wine cooler)but it was killed my taste palate and made me not like super sweet candy-type stuff anymore. A bad beer(wine cooler)deserves a bad review. Sorry, Jacob!"
"It is a decent simple beer to have as a break from the more complex stuff. Just a frolic, but still maybe memorable."
"Okay, this is a wine cooler basically. Tastes good and refreshing, but not a classic beer style."
"The mouthfeel is dominated by sweetness. It's also carbonated. A neat sensation at first, but I tire of it quickly. All this sugar (or aspartame or whatever) kills the drinkability. I think when I looked at this beer it reminded me of Fort--a beverage I've really enjoyed. Not that it's trying to compete with that, but this one pales in comparison. If you drink this, you should share it...but you could probably do without."
"The foam was light wheat with a obvious reddish pink hue that dissapated quickly. The color was a apple red haze with a wheat lighlight. The smell - the 1st experience was a dominate rasberry aroma with small hints of blueberry. Couldn't really smell anything else. Taste had a somewhat dominate rasberry overtone with deep undertones of wheat, blackberry and a sharp crispness at the end. Mouthfeel - smooth, fruity and somewhat light-bodied. Drinkability - with the smoothness of the wheaty fruit, it was a good session."
"D- One or two is about all I could do on a hot summer day. A little too artificial in the flavor department for me."
"I thought it was pretty refreshing, if not in the way a good beer is refreshing--I could see myself drinking one in the summer out of a cooler at the beach when I just wanted a very light beer buzz. So high drinkability, average everything else."
"a good fruit beer. how good that is, not very good. but it isn't a true beer. but it is really refreshing and subs well for juice. maybe I am just making it seem better for everyone I know that swears by this beer after a hard day of work."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this one is just another in the multitude of berry-flavored beers. There was nothing I detected that makes it stand out any more than any beer of its kind."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden orange/amber color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus foamy white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some yeast, berries. The taste is malty, slight yeasty, some berries in there. Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad, better than I expected."
"Overall, an okay brew for what it is. Too sweet for me to seek it out on a regular basis. Kind of refeshing though."
"Definitely drinkable, but like I said earlier, I get the feeling that drinking many of these in one sitting would make me ill. Still though, taking down one of these is not a problem. Even if I feel like I'm drinking a girly drink, so what?"
"Side Notes: Ok this is a live review, I am drinking at the comp, as I type this. I really know why my girlfriend likes these now. Reminds me of a hard cider, and that's not a bad thing to say, but this is a beer we have to remember. I can see this being a great brew to cook with, and the next warm say I am going to give it a shot on the grill. This would take the place of a blackberry brandy on boneless pork chops."
"this beer pours a hazy orange with an off white head that might be a bit pink. the head fades to lacing giving off quite a bit of berry already. the taste is overwhelmingly berry there isn't much room for the yeast or malts here. even with the decent co2 and good body this just doesn't really make a decent attempt at being a beer."
"D- too sweet for me, if I wanted sweet i would get a lambic or one of dogfish's fruit beers, i could see using it for cooking maybe"
"Drinkability: More of a ""near-beer"" or alcoholic juice than a true beer. Very easy to drink, but nothing but sweetness and berries. Might be a decent ""beach"" beer, but not much else."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, especially on a summer day. Definitely no problem with getting another one. I think I may do that right now."
"Poured a very awkward color. Its not sure if its red or if its slightly orange, a bit pink, or maybe even brown. Its got a big foamy white head that sticks to the glass. Its smell is awful. Lots of rotten fruit, sugar sweetness, rancid apple cider and yea berries. It also packs an unpleasant tingly astringent-like feeling in the nose. It tastes bad too, any form of a wheat/bread character is totally blocked by the sweetness. It's cloying. It coats your mouth, deadens your tongue and sticks with you long after you take a sip. This was a dumper..."
"Just like the Honey Weiss I had last night, this has a pretty low 4.70% ABV to it. It doesn't matter much, even though it's a session beer, I doubt that too many people are gonna be chugging 3 or 4 of these in one sitting. This would be a good beer to have after dinner to clean your mouth out before a stronger stout takes over and finishes the night off properly. An average beer, but personally, I could think of quite a few ways I'd rather get berries into my diet..."
"Immediately overpowered by the aroma. It is very fruity. It has a purple, pink, brownish hue. It is definitely berry flavored. I am not a huge fan but I could see it going down pretty easily on a warm summer day. It almost tastes more like a wine cooler than a beer. It is too sweet for my liking. Probably a big hit with people who are not fans of the taste of beer."
"The combination of sugars and silky wheat beer give this drink a slightly syrupy feel that can put one off if not in the proper mood. But when a drinker wants a soda pop beer, this is a nice choice. This is a great drink for desserts or an autumn evening campfire."
"Drinks easy and it's a nice summer beer for the non craft crowd. Almost a gateway beer and almost a step in the wrong direction. (may lead to zima or hard lemonade or other malternatives)"
"Pours a pink raspberry color with a thin off-white and slightly pink head. Little retention or glass lacing. Aroma is decidedly fresh berries with notes of honey and spice. Flavor is sweet and syrupy with decidedly raspberry, candy sugar, and fresh ripe fruit notes. Generally light body with a sticky sweet mouthfeel. Very sweet. Mix it with the honey weiss for a good brew."
"Great beer for a woman who hates beer!"
"Drinkability: This one just isn't for me. Has more in common with those malternative beverages and, if that's your bag, then maybe you'll be damn pleased to pound down a Berry Weiss."
"Sweet fruity flavor, and not too much in the way of wheat. Nevertheless, it is refreshing, and an overall decent quaff if you like fruit beers. Again it should be noted, if you're mostly a wheat fan, you may be a little disappointed as the fruit leads this dance."
"D- one of these was enough, i thought it might be good to try but i cant drink anymore of these. Nice to sample but not to buy a case or even a sixer."
"Cheers!!!"
"Pours a light purple-pink, with a light pink head that quickly dissipates. Smells like fruit juice from a box--the kind you had in your lunchbox as a kid. The taste is the same: shockingly un-beerlike fruit drink. There might be a tiny bit of wheat in there, but it's totally burried beneath a crushing nastyness of berry-punch Juicy Juice. Gave me horrible heatrburn,will never drink again if I can help it"
"Not a bad beer, but on those rare occasions when I want a fruit beer, I'll stick with a Belgian Lambic."
"The taste is blueberry, strawberry, orange burst, some lemony citrus, with a touch of cheap malty flavors in the rear. As for hops, there aren't any that I can detect. This is a wine cooler or a beer for the summer where you offer it to someone who doesn't like beer. It's refreshing, sweet, lightly alcoholic, decently carbonated, and just plain silly. This isn't a sophisticated after dinner lambic and don't approach it with that expectation."
"It has a weizen aroma you can smell almost immediately with a huge berry aroma wafting at you. The head has a fuchsia tint but is of good size and there is some very nice lacing. The body is a red almost pink color. It tastes very sweet with a sour berry aftertaste. It reminds me of a lot of the malternatives around. The mouthfeel is light but has a lot carbonation causing fizz burn."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a murky brown-pink color with a huge three-finger head of slightly pink foam. It left very good lacing and the retention was pretty good as a thin collar.. The aroma was all raspberries and strawberries and a candy-like sweetness. The flavors were very, very sweet. Cloying, in your-face, too-much sweet. Getting beyond the sweetness was difficult and all I could really discern beyond that was some sourness and an awkward, artificial aftertaste. The body was medium/light and the carbonation a little too high. I don't know what they were shooting for here but they totally missed the mark."
"A: The color of pink grapefruit with a hint of white, layer of frothy foam - 3.50, S: This is one of those beers that you can smell from afar, lots of berry busting out of this thing, putting the beer under my nose and this brings me back to the high school days when wine coolers were the drink of preference, overpowering aromas of black berries and raspberries, for what this beer is supposed to be it isn't half bad, reminds me of some lambics - 4.00, T: The honey comes through on the palate, less of a beer than a wine spritzer, I struggle to determine whether I'm impressed or terrified by this one, loads of berry flavors, no hops that I can discern, the slightest hint of some tartness on the tail - 3.00, M: Thin to medium bodied - 3.50, D: On a hot day under the sun this beer might have its place, it's not half as bad as I expected but it really pushes the definition of beer - 3.00"
"To sum it up, if you want something refreshing, this does its job quite well. If you're looking for something else, though, don't drink it."
"You really gotta be in the mood for this stuff. A little too sweet for my palatte, though refreshing enough on a hot day I suppose."
"I won't say that's it's terrible because I'll finish the rest that I got. But I would not get this again."
" Bottom line- An ok price for a slightly below average beer. If you like a heavy fruit taste in your beer you should give it a try, but it's just not really my cup of tea."
"Overall, one of the better fruit beers I have had. Does not taste artificial. Will definitely have this one again."
"This reddish creamy beer was a little better than I expected. Pretty light with a significant berry flavor, but not to overwhelmingly fruity that you can't taste the fact that it's a wheatbeer. While far from one of my favorites, it beats some of the Sam Adams berry beers that I have had by quite a large margin."
"D= Hard to do more than one without something in between. Gave me a little tummy ache :("
"D: More of a flavored alcohol beverage thatn a weis as the name implied. Drinkable as long as you can stomach the sweet taste - some have more tolerance of that others."
"Drinkability: Fruity and light, so it would work out for many people who aren't too fond of the taste of beer. Its a beer for those who don't like beer. Does that job well. I'm not the target consumer for this style, but I wouldn't mind a couple."
"Whoa, this one is just way too fruity. Tastes like one of those alcopop things, not like a beer at all. If you're in the mood for an alcoholic fruit juice grab this guy, but otherwise steer clear. I mean I don't mind fruit beers at all.. but this one's a little too much... I'd pass on it.. it's almost too hard to finish a single bottle."
"I won't touch this again. This might work on my wife, but I don't need another."
"Drinkability - even someone who doesn't usually care for beer, I could drink several fairly quickly without realizing its beer."
"Is this beer or a malternative? With willpower (and putting beer out of my mind) I was able to finish one (and give the rest to a female neighbor who drinks the ""malt beverages"" to share with her friends. Better them than me!"
"To each their own though a couple of our members gave it a high ratings in our own little rating system (17,18 out of 20) a personally give it a very generous 4 out of 20."
"Drinkability - all it takes is a little sweet tooth to enjoy the beer. It was easily dispatched but not something I'd buy on purpose."
"'Beer Its Not Just A Beverage Beer Is Food'"
"I don't know...should I commit hari-kari for liking this? I certainly wouldn't ever gravitate toward this given even mildly better choices, but it's not near as bad as I'd expected. And still not the hellish Boo-Berry soda that Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat is. My German-beer-expert better-half says it tastes just like the German style this is derived from, and she would know. Give it a whirl."
"I enjoyed my first bottle after a long round of golf in the hot sun. It really was refreshing and totally hit the spot for me."
"Very interesting. I have never really found a ""berry"" beer that I thought was good. Pouring this from the bottle into a glass, it was actually a pink color. Once poured it settles down to more like a copper color, some haze and a pinkish tint to it. Thick white, pinkish tinted head and quite a bit of lace. The aroma is.... you guessed it. Berries. If I had to pick one, blackberries. The taste is very carbonated and berry-like. It seemed like it was flavored seltzer. Nothing I'll get again."
"An odd tasting beer, that doesn't quite stack up and the metallic note just kills it. A nice attempt though."
"D- Well, I'm still not a fan of these fruit beers. I'll keep trying them and maybe find one that I like. I'll pass on this way too sweet and fruity for me."
"D - I didn't hate this beer, but it wasn't much of a beer and as such I would never/could never drink this as if it were just a beer. It is far too sweet."
"Overall: I would not have this again because I would want a beer instead. Buy this for your girlfriend that enjoys wine coolers."
"Somewhat creamy mouthfeel, and fairly easy to drink, though the tart berry flavors become a bit too much eventually."
"The beer pours a hazy purple color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry pale and wheat malt scent along with a sweet blackberry aroma. The taste is average. It has a watery wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a tangy blackberry taste. It's sweet tasting with a thin watery feel. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This tastes more like soda than beer. It's one and done for me."
"Drinkability: Not bad for the summer or people who are tired of the same old thing."
"Not recommended... Literally tastes liked spiked soda..."
"Color has trace of pink to it? This beer is not about malt but about berries. Raspberry smell. Kind of like a sody-pop. Tasty in the same way, but not so much in a beery way. There is a slightly bitter finish that surprised me. It is almost incongruous with the berries and brings home for me the point that a sour beer base that eschews hops makes for the best fruit beers. This is not New Glarus."
"Drinkability- Good stuff. It's not very beer-like, but I enjoyed it. I could see females who aren't big beer drinkers really liking this stuff. Good for summer outings or pool parties."
"Overall a somewhat drinkable beer, although if you drank it blindfolded and nobody told you that you were drinking a beer, you wouldn't know it. Anyways, not a bad way to quench your thirst if you're not quite feeling like a ""regular"" beer."
"D - Calling this a weis/beer is a bit of a ... lie. This tastes more like a lot of malternative beverages I've had. Honestly it's drinkable, but I'm not sure I'd call it a beer. If I want this flavor profile I'll go for a Smiroff ice or something like that."
"After a hard pour, the head quickly shrinks to a thin lace on the top. The smell of fruit juice is heavy. The color is a nice amber with a fair amount of carbonation rising to the surface. The taste is very, very tart. A grape/rasberry combination for the flavor. I can't detect any of the ""usual"" beer flavors, especially any hops. The fruit flavor sticks in my mouth and lingers for quite some time. It reminds me of a grape soda. For a fruit beer, this might be right on target, but the ""soda"" feel just doesn't work for me. I prefer a beer with a more sutle fruit flavor, not one the seems to hit you over the head."
"Bright clearish glowing orange color with a big lasting beige head. Smell is citrusy, orange, fruity and floral sweet hoppiness. Really nice, fresh smell. Taste is strongly hoppy with big citrusy, hoppy orange flavor. Nice crisp bitterness, but malt is nicely balancing it on through the finish. Really drinkable, refreshing and delicious. Fantastic double IPA!"
"You should try one if you like grape juice, otherwise you will not like it at all. The fruit taste is just WAY too overpowering."
"She likes wheat beers and this is a wheat beer. She also like fruity flavors, and this is definitely fruity. That being said, she liked it alright and it certainly looks strangely inviting, but it's just too over the top to keep returning to."
"Worth trying, but not recommended for an everyday drink..."
"D: this is a sipping beer, not a guzzling one. Two would suffice; three would be too much sweetness."
"D: Girlfriend loves it, not a fan myself. Way to sweet and too many artifical flavor masking any trace of beer. Blah."
"Poured into pint glass and this beer has a very unique color, kind of a red-pinkish-orange if you will. Decent head a little on the rose side with good retention, I had to knock it on appearance just for the color of the head alone. No one wants a beer with a pink head. Smell is good. Smells of bread, yeast, and some berry, but not as much as I anticipated. Taste is pretty good too considering the style. Yes, its sweet as can be and an orgy of berry flavor but its ok. Just dont get it confused with the taste of Boones Farm cause I did that once or twice. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, overall a relatively drinkable beer. I had some with my gal out at a the pool and that was a perfect setting."
"The berry weiss pours a very awkward color. Its not sure if its red or if its slightly orange, a bit pink, or maybe even brown. Its got a big foamy white head that sticks to the glass. Its smell is awful. Lots of rotten fruit, sugar sweetness, rancid apple cider and yea berries. It also packs an unpleasant tingly astringent-like feeling in the nose. It tastes bad too, any form of a wheat/bread character is totally blocked by the sweetness. It's cloying. It coats your mouth, deadens your tongue and sticks with you long after you take a sip. This was a dumper... Avoid this during your summer beer search. There are lots of better options in the 'flavored wheat beer' category. Try a Lambic, Blue Point Blueberry Ale, DFH Black and Blue or Red and White instead. Or you could just stick with the good old Sunset Wheat from Leinenkugels!"
"Very easy to drink as long as you don't mind the sweetness. Would be a great beer on a hot summer day."
"This is a good fruit beer that, imo, doesn't have a whole lot of complexity going on but I don't look for that in every beer I try. It's simple, and it's good."
"One selection from the Summer Beers 12 pack. Brown 12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a slightly pink color. Short white head, with some good retention and thin lace. Points for uniqueness. You can smell the berries and some yeast, strong but not overpowering. Taste is quite sweet, almost like a wine cooler. Lots of berry flavor, raspberry and blackberry. Sweet and slightly sticky mouthfeel, but there is still enough wheat element. A good fruity hot weather drink, but a bit too sweet for me to have more than one at a time."
"D : On a hot summer day, it would be perfect."
"M/D: Leaves a syrupy slimy feel in the mouth and feels heavy as you drink it. I probably couldn't drink to many of these quickly and probably only after a meal for a dessert. The flavors keep you coming back to the beer but the amount of sugar hits the stomach hard."
"For what it is, it's a very fruity beer with natural flavoring, as opposed to a Miller Chill or Bud Lime. It's better than some other fruit beers, but it's no lambic. If you love berries, be my guest. I'll pass from now on."
"Absolutely drinkable especially for those that are leery about beers tasting too bitter. Something I could enjoy on a nice summer night."
"The first 1 or 2 sips are enjoyable. Outside in the sun or at Miller Park for a ballgame, I could easily enjoy a couple of these worked in with more traditional fare. But it gets ugly quickly as it warms and it's not something to sit and contemplate. Grip it and rip it at your own peril, but only once or twice."
"D: Drinkability was extremely limited due to the extreme sugary sweetness of this beer. Drank like a concentrated fruit juice box."
"First off. This beer is what it is. A fruit beer for mass consumption and for those who aren't going to buy a fruit lambic to experience good fruit/beer combinations. This beer is highly drinkable during the warmer months. the color is that of well...berries. The taste is predominantly blackberry with a hint of wheat characteristics to it. There is nothing wrong with this beer, it is just what it says on the bottle: a berry wheat. For a more interesting Leinie's beer go for the Creamy Dark."
"D- Drinks OK. I never like to drink too many fruit beers."
"D: I could have about two before the berries would get to sweet for me."
"D: If you really like fruit beers this would be a good one to have. The yeast and honey keep the fruits in check and running away with the flavor. For me however only 1 will do in a sitting."
"Way too sweet and artificial for my taste."
"D: Well, it's gotta be drinkable. It's like a Smirnoff Ice without the staggering amount of sugar. The sweetness could still be overpowering eventually, but it wouldn't be difficult to enjoy a few of these on a hot day. I'm just not sure you can actually call this a beer."
"Overall I found it enjoyable, but I know this wouldn't be for everyone."
"Feels smooth and milky. Leaves a big film which remains for a while. It's a sweet drink that is much thicker than expected. Really pleasant and balanced sweetness and sour."
"D- It reminds me of a malt beverage or a mixed drink with a bit of malt added more than anything. Perhaps a non-beer drinker would like this beer, but it's too sweet for my taste."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an a pinkish amber color with a pretty nice off-white head that has good lacing and retention qualities . The aroma is very sweet and slightly tart and filled with blackberries, raspberries and other different wildberry smells. The taste like the aroma is almost overwhelmingly sweet with berry flavors and just a touch of wheat flavor under all the sweetness. Overall, this is not a horrible beer, but it is way too sweet for my palate. It almost tastes like a couple of sugar packets were dumped into this beer before consumption. It is one and done for me, thankfully I just bought a single bottle."
"I like this beer, it isn't overly sweet like a lot of fruit beer. I had this beer in a pint glass and a refridgerated temperature. Pours a mild golden color. Smells of blue berries, ripe raspberries, not toobad. Tastes just the same but toned down a little. Smooth and fairly easy drinking."
"pours a pink color with a one finger off white head that held well and some nice lacing on the glass. sweet smell of berrys in the nose. the taste of the berrys is ok but much to sweet, like drinking raspberry soda. mouthfeel and carbonation ok. as a desert one bottle would do, how about a berry float with a scoop ice cream?"
"I've always known about Leinenkugel's beers and I finally bought a sampler pack. I first tried the berry weiss and I was kind of shocked. There is a tremendous amount of berry flavor but blended quit well with the beer, and didn't drown out the beer flavor. There wasn't much carbonation but wasn't expected in a fruit beer. Overall I was very impressed and a very simple beer to drink year round I believe."
"12oz bottle from Tiger Town in Gardiner. Pours a hazy pinkish-amber body with a good inch of pinkish-white head. Smells like raspberry and perhaps some strawberry and/or cranberry thrown in. Tastes predominantly like strawberry and raspberry and very little else. Pretty dry finish. Light bodied with an awful lot of carbonation. Pretty drinkable, though it'd be better if it were a bit sweeter or more malty IMO. Okay, but not sure it's something I'd get again."
"Aroma is full and strongly of raspberry - and I love raspberry. It pours a curious pinkish amber, unusual but not unappetizing. Flavor is mainly fruity, more like a cider than a beer, but crisp and tasty - the raspberry dominates the malt. If you love raspberry, this beer should wet your whistle."
"Avoid completely."
"Did not enjoy this one overall. Give me more beer flavour and less of a fruit bomb. I'd pass on this one again."
"I had this beer with a meal in Mattoon, IL. Before ordering it, I asked the waitress if it had a strong fruit taste. She said it did not but she must have been winging it because this tasted like kool-aid. I couldn't drink it because it was soooo sweet with a powerful berry taste. I couldn't tell it was a wheat beer at all."
"Pours a very red/pinkish color, with a bit of head and a bit of lacing, not bad for a wheat. Very cider/lambic type of aroma, it has a strong berry scent (blackberry mostly), with a bit of apple and honey as well. Nice flavor, although the berry (mostly) and honey (a fair bit) overpower the wheat beer, there's still a bit of it there. It goes down very smoothly, a very refreshing beer, if you want something sweet."
"This was one of the selections in the Leinie variety pack. Maybe I would have liked it better on a warm summer day, but I doubt it. This was a reddish/pink beer with a small pink head. When the head quickly disappeared, it looked like fruit juice. It had a sweet berry aroma, not too bad. But the sweetness overwhelmed the taste. Way too sweet, way too juice-like."
"Pours a three-finger pinkish head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Clear red/amber color. Maybe its a blackberry nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet and tart berry(?) with a sweet and sour finish. Would make a good summer beer - not one with two feet of snow on the ground. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"This just isn't for me. It seems like they're trying to pass of a wine cooler or flavored soda as a beer. I just wasn't into it."
"Overall, considerably better than most reviews here would lead you to believe (in my opinion). Leinenkugal's makes a nice product."
"D - Well this is the definition of a girl beer very fruity and sweet I can't say that I'll ever want this beer again once is enough"
"Verdict: Too sweet to be an actual weissbeer. It's decent but overdone with the berries. Still might be enjoyable as a summer beer on a hot day."
"I know this particular beer is very polarized in it's reviews. Overall, I felt it was a refreshing beer to have every now and then...but, I wouldn't make it a ""session""."
"Good drinkability for a fruit beer."
"As soon as I poured the beer all I could think about was Arbor Mist wine. And essentially that's what this beer tastes and looks like. Has a red/pink appearance. Smells of fruit of course, blackberries mostly. The taste was pleasing, but not really a good beer taste, more like alcoholic fruit juice with honey. The beer was smooth overall with good amount of carbonation. If you plan to drink this in front of the boys,though, you better wear a skirt."
"A pinkish red beer with a bubbly foan that vanishes to a lacing.Smell is blackberry, blueberry and raspberry.Taste is the same except that there is a dominant honey aftertaste.This is different than any beer I have ever had but in a good way.If you have a sweet tooth definetly worth a try!!"
"I bought a sixer of this for my girlfriend, but being curious, I had to try one (and you know you did too.) Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer pours a medium red/purple fruit punch color, forming a thin pinkish white head that quickly faded. No lacing to be seen. The aroma is completely dominated by the berry aroma. If there's anything else there, I cant smell it. The flavor is basically the same. Strong berry flavoring, with maybe a hint of wheat. In better terms, its like drinking an alcoholic fruit punch. Light and smooth mouthfeel. For a fruit beer, it drinks very well, but way too sweet to ever be a session ale. I think I would be sick if I were to drink more than one of these in one night. Overall, I suppose its not a bad beverage, but I couldnt really call this a beer IMO. Way too sweet for a beer, but maybe just right to start bringing non-beer drinkers into the field."
"This is a weird beer. It's pink with a purple/pink hued head. Odd appearance. Smells good like a little kid's juice box or a Capri Sun or something... But with a touch of beer. Very sweet and fruity taste. Raspberries, mostly. Maybe strawberries as well. Tastes like jam. This beer would be more aptly be named ""the champagne of beers"" instead of Miller High Life. It's too sweet to drink too many of. Good... but chick beer. My wife can have the rest of them."
"D- too swwet to drink all night. this is enjoyable if I was craving for a soda not a beer."
"Serving type: bottle poured into a pint glass."
"This is a very refreshing beer with a high drinkability. It is low in bitterness and high in sweetness. I love really bitter IPA:s but you can not judge this beer from that kind of perspective. This beer has got very low ratings on this site and I think it is unfair. There is definately room for this type of beer among the many different types you can try but try this with an open mind. I suspect that this beer has got low ratings on this site by people who are not really used to different types of beers. It is very different but has such a great and refreshing taste that I rank it high for it's originality."
"I really like the fruity sweet-tart taste to this beer. I could drink it all day, especially in the summer."
"I can imagine this would be a lot better with the summer time heat than in winter."
"Overall: I'll pass on this one, good thing it was a single at a bar."
"Beer pours a light purple color. At first sight I already knew how it would taste. Smell of pure blackberries, nothing else. Taste is of muted berries and honey. Not as much there as I would have thought. This beer couldn't decide if it wanted to be sweet or tart. Very weird tasting fruit/wheat beer. Mouthfeel was that of a hefe, pretty basic there. I couldn't even finish my first one. Had half the bottle and dumped the rest down the old drain. Clearly not one of my favorites."
"This beer poured an odd copper-purplish color with little head and little to no lacing. The aroma was of berries. Thats it. Berries. The taste was good. It had a strong berry taste with hints of honey. The mouthfeel was a bit heavy from the honey I'm guessing and the carbonation was medium to high. Overall it was a good beer but was so sweet I could probably only drink one."
"All in all, buy the variety pack of lienies, try em all!"
"I expected this beer to be better since I enjoy the Leine's Sunset Wheat. However, this beer is overpowering in it's sweetness. It tastes more like a berry soda to me than a beer. I can't drink even half of one without feeling a little sick to my stomach. But then again, I don't particularly like sweet tasting beverages."
"Wow--is this a beer? I poured this to get something like the Abita Purple Haze, however with a wonderful blueberry/blackberry aroma. It looked decent, however at the first sip I wondered what I was drinking. If you like wine coolers, this one is for you. It is sweet in such an unnatural way, it must have added sweeteners after fermentation. Hard to rate as a beer as it is closer to some odd thing like Zima to me. I don't know if malts were used in this beer because the berry flavor and sweetness is overpowering. Not bad overall if you don't expect to be drinking a beer."
"Drinkability: I've tasted this beer at Summerfest a few times, but I have never actually ""tasted"" it until now. It's not nearly as bad I thought it was. Maybe it was the can. Overall, not a bad beer, but not a session beer for me."
"It had a good strong dry aroma; it really does smell like berries, I just dont know if they were blackberries, but very sweet indeed. It reminds me of champagne or some sort of wine cooler. It has a good body thats medium hazy reddish/brown/orange color, and I thought I saw a hint of purple as I was pouring it into the glass Ill check next time if I buy it again. Leinenkugels Berry Weiss is topped off with a fluffy thick head that slowly thins out, but has plenty of lacing throughout. Its got some good carbonation going on. It has a really sweet taste to it, not as dry as I thought it would be, its smooth on the tongue, but its not a full bodied beer. It goes down pretty smooth and has a mildly dry after taste thats still sweet and just a bit of alcohol as well. Not bad over all."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"In all honesty, the quality of this beer far surpasses the taste of this beer. Three distinct flavors, a noticeable flavor change, a really nice, subtle, long lingering finish. A pretty palate-gripping mouthfeel. This, from a shear construction perspective, a top-level beer. But the flavor just is too much. With that ALL said, if you want to try a refreshing fruit beer, that is one of the more well made examples of the style, this is it. Props to the brewers; I'd gladly serve this to female acquaintances who like cosmo's and maybe even throw back one or two just to admire the craftsmanship."
"Different, but too medicinal for my taste."
"At the party, I figured I had to at least give it a try. I really was shocked at how sweet it was. The flavors really didn't seem all that natural. I was able to stomach one, but that's about it."
"Edit: After having a few more, this beer began to drop on the drinkability scale...just so concentrated and fruity. It really reminds me of if one of the big boys decided to try and make a fruit lambic for the masses."
"I wasn't dissappointed with the beer, but I did figure it would be a little less fruity and sugary. As far as getting a keg to drink before a football game, it was not a wise decision."
"Poured a color that was attractive and reminiscent of pink grapefruit juice or pink lemonade only a little darker. Upon opening of the bottle, your nose is overwhelmed by the smell of berries. The aroma to me was very much like wine. The taste was also of berries, a balanced convergence of sweet and tart flavors. The mouthfeel was very pleasant and nicely carbonated. I thought this was very refreshing. I could not session it, but its a nice refresher."
"Drinkability: Not a bad fruit beer but just not my type of fruit beer"
"D - I could see how someone that doesn't like craft beer could easily enjoy this. Tastes a lot like a wine cooler."
"Too much berry flavor for me. This is definitly a chick beer, which is okay, but I still think even most of the wine cooler babes would rather have those than switch to a beer like this. It tastes a lot like raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, not much like beer, and way too sweet. It has a slick, syrupy feel, too sugary. Its not for me, thats for sure."
"Again I reviewed this using my cell phone for notes. Sorry I can't give more detailed reviews for the past few beers and this one."
"overall, this was a very sweet beer but that is to be expected i suppose"
"This was an ok beer. I'm not going to walk into a beer store or bar searching this one out, but if I happen to walk across it and the mood strikes...well then, I just might drink it again."
"This tasted very little like beer. More like raspberry flavored pop or mineral water. The fruit was just too strong for my liking. It tasted very sugary and very berry. I couldn't taste much typical beer flavors in it at all. Drinkability is therefore pretty low on this. Not my thing really. I much prefer Leinie's Sunset Wheat, where fruit flavors compliment beer flavors, instead of completely dominating them."
"Fizzy and thin, this is not something I have even the slightest urge to revisit. If I want soda, I'll buy soda. If I want a fruit beer, I'll buy a fruit beer. This doesn't really work as either. The thing is, I actually like fruit beers and another Wisconsin brewery (New Glarus) offers two such beers that are also quite sweet but are far superior. The difference is that those beers combine fruit and grain in a seamless way whereas this tastes like a mixer. Never a good sign when the brewers recommend you pour their beer over ice (the website used to suggest this)."
"This was better than I remembered from my previous tastes. I would not sit and drink this through a session because of the sweetness but would drink occasionally and mix with other Leinenkugel products as they suggest. I am surprised at my review rating."
"D: I feel like a few of these could be downed in a short setting because of it's soda-like tendencies, not that that's a bad thing, because the taste in and of it's self is pretty good."
"Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss Bier pours an orange color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a pleasant berry aroma. There is a strong berry flavor and a pleasant wheat finish. A bit on the sweet side, but not bad for an American fruit flavored wheat beer."
"D. Sort of boring but I could see how this would be refreshing after a long hot day outside. Not a beer for beer lovers."
"drinkability is good for any drinker with a sweet tooth (myself not included). this brew will definitely give the drinker an energy boost, and a borderline sugar high with a couple bottles consumed."
"I wouldn't go out of my way to get another but I would drink one after mowing the grass."
"Mouth and drinkability both about average. I think this stuff is easy to drink in small quantities, but a bit abrasive beyond a pint."
"Pours out a weird mix of orange and a hint of red. Body is hazed over. Head is a pink-tinted off-white and leaves some lacing. Smells like Cisco, blackberry jam, cherry Jello, and fruit roll-ups. Wheat comes out more in the taste, but not by much. Still overly sweet with all of the artificial characteristics found in the aroma. I taste a good deal of Cisco in this one. Mouthfeel is somewhat fulsome by the residual sugars and has a lively carbonation. This is too sweet and too Cisco-y for me. They should call this Cisco Swerve."
"D: Quite drinkable, actually. I probably won't go out of my way to buy an other one, but I am glad I finally tried this beer. I'd definitely choose this one over the Fruit Loop infused Sunset Wheat from the same brewery."
"I tried this beer on a whim. It looked average, smelled great (the berries, obviously), but I can't get on board with the taste. If I was faced with a choice between this and something like Smirnoff Ice, I'd go with this, but that's probably the only time."
"This beer, served in a 12 oz mug, is a rather hazy light-reddish-amber color with a very small, fading head. Nose is sweetly berry-ish, but not too cloying nor does it smell like certain childrens' cereals (as do many berry beers). Unfortunately, bleagh, the flavor is overwhelmingly sweet and cloyingly berry-laden. I can't find any detectable beer or weizen character. One-dimensional at best."
"This pours a damn near pink, and is super carbonated giving you a very light pink, good size head. Gets to a ring pretty fast, a little lacing here and there. Beer smells very fruity, can't really get anything else smell-wise other than the dark berries that are super evident. The taste is basically the same as the smell. Not necessarily a bad taste, but the beer part of it just doesn't ever come through. VERY fruity, VERY sweet, VERY carbonated. This probably wouldn't be bad with a salad or some chicken during the summer time, but it's not what you're going for if you're looking to sit down with a ""beer"". Like someone said before, if your girlfriend hates beer, she'll probably like this."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied. Very sweet. I think the sweetness makes it hard to drink. I couldn't handle more than one. It's really not a bad drink. But, I'm not impressed with it as a beer. Overall, it's an interesting beer, but not a good one."
"D - This was hard to drink. Too sweet and no real beer characteristics. I usually enjoy the style, but this one didn't do it for me."
"Overall impression: Interesting I guess, but this isn't really a beer. All fruity and sweet, overly so to be highly drinkable."
"Pours pink with a short lived pink head. Big berry smell that promises uncomprimising sweetness. Taste delivers on that note, although not near as cloying as I expected. Crisp, dare I say refreshing. Good pop like carbonation. Very soda like in character. As such, drinkability is high, but couldn't see myself drinking more than a couple in a setting."
"D - Okay as long as you don't expect this to taste like beer....because this is more berry than beery."
"Drank a 12 oz. bottle of this with no freshness date. Pours a hazy bright pink, with a white, foamy head at first. Very little retention. Smell is completely dominated by sweet berries. Taste is dominated of it, too, although there's a decent malty finish. Good mouthfeel to it. Overall, not a bad beer. Not terribly complex, but it's up front about being a fruit beer, and it does a good job of fulfilling it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: In the mouth this beer is spritzy, just like a wine cooler. Light and a highly carbonated body are perfect for this style of beer. Feels just right in the mouth. This beer is something that one has to be in the mood for. I think it would be very very refreshing on a hot summer day, it is something that I'll probably buy again, it might be a while, but I can assure you that sometime during the summer I'll be buying this beer again. If you are a fan of fruit beer that this is a must try. I won't be afraid to admit it. I like fruit beer, and this is one of the best I've ever had."
"I had a sample of this at Leinenkugels brewery, so I'm sure it tasted a little better than what you'll find in your local beer store. However, I have to review what's available to me. If Grolsch tastes bad because it sat in a container for 2 months, tough. This had a nice fruity flavor to it, very berry like (couldn't quite place which kind). Unlike a lambic, this wasn't fizzy and champagne-like. You knew you were drinking a lagered beer. This had a smooth, malty flavor that complimented the berries nicely, so while the fruit dominated, there was more substance than just the fruit. It had a great smell, too, so you get to enjoy this with a few senses"
"bottom line: this beer is limp-wristed and cloying."
"Like raspberry soda. Sweet, fruity, and refreshing! My initial thought was that it reminded me of some of the over-sweet Belgian fruit-lambics... and for a mere fraction of the price! And then I thought of some of the other raspberry beers from Belgium that aren't nearly as full or complex, and this one beats them hands down! That said, it pours a pinkish and ruby orange body beneath a fluffy head of pink foam. The head retention is very good and it leaves some really nice rings of craggy lace at the outset of the glass. The nose is bright with sugary fruit (it acutally reminded me of Hawaiian-Punch a bit) and not much else. In the mouth it's medium-light bodied with a dextrinous edge; and delicately prickly with carbonation... kind of like soda. The flavor is exactly as the nose suggests, but with more of a ""real"" fruit character. It starts sweet and finishes sweet with a healthy dose of cleansing acidity across the middle. The bitterness is very low-key, for obvious reasons; and although it lingers a bit in the finish it's never overly sweet. Again, kind of like a raspberry soda. For this type of product, I think it's one oof the better ones I've had."
"by volume- 4.7%."
"This beer is my sister-in-laws beer of discovery, she just thinks its great, we shall see. It pours a pinkish amber color with a thin white head on top, vewry visible signs of carbonation in the glass. The scent is totally dominated with the berry aroma, rasberry seems to be the strongest. The taste starts with the tartness of berries, and almost becoming overbearing, then a light wheat flavor blends in right at the end. Very thin and watery, the berries do leave the palate dry. This beer may not be what I like in a beer and I am not giving high score, but if it brings a non-beer drinking person, like my sister-in-law, to the world of beer, then I am all for it. Plus, several weeks later, I got her to try a framboise, and she was floored."
"Overall not a very drinkable beer. Too much like a wine cooler for my taste. Interesting champagne character though."
"D- This just ended my evening of not drinking beer perfectly. First I drink the Fresca tasting Sunset Wheat then this. I guess you have to see how low you can go every once in awhile. Very wine-cooler/malt beverage like and I feel somehow diminished."
"Overall: A below par offering and one that should be avoided."
"Poured a hazy red color with large white puffy head. Smell is sweetish with mild berry scents in the foreground. Taste shows some weiis beer characteristics with some pleasnt berry undertones present. Finishes nice and refreshing. While not my favorite style of beer, I found this one to be a nice summer afternoon change-of-pace brew."
"Berry Weiss is one of the better fruit beers available in my opinion. Until very recently it was only available in the summer months, but due to customer feedback, Leinenkugel is going to offer it year round now. I have had it in 12oz bottles and on tap. In a glass it has a pinkish color and you can really smell the berry flavors. Unlike most berry flavored beers, this one is on the sweeter side and not tart at all. It has a nice amount of carbonation, but very little head retention. Perfect for a hot afternoon to cool down, and equally suitable as a palate cleansing beer after drinking some high hopped or heavier styles."
"Lacking backbone. Needs either more malt or some hop content to balance the sweetness. Nice berry flavors with a hint of blood orange. Some carbonation but a thin and subdued mouthfeel with a short undesirable finish. This is a one and done type of beer."
"The beer poured out a nice amber color, with a nice light head and good retention. There was good carbonation in the beer as well. Once we got past appearances the beer lost me a little. Smell gave what you would expect, raz and wheat. The taste for me was just too much, almost like artificial sweeteners, and I am one who can appreciate a fruit beer. I wouldn't go so far as to call this more of a wine cooler, but it was just too much. Mouthfeel was not quite what I expected, somewhat foamy at times. In the end I struggled to finish it."
"Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss. I grabbed a sixer of this on my way out of work the other day for my girlfriend to try. Yeah yeah yeah. i know. you think i'm trying to pawn this off on her. but really, she likes flavored beers from time to time, so i thought she'd like to try this. Of course, i grabbed a swig from her first beer, and ended up splitting the pack with her. This stuff is really good! It pours a rich garnet, clear ruby color, with a surprisingly thick 1/2 inch head. it doesn't have the most appealing smell, kind of fleetingly sweet and a bit funky, but nothing unappetizing. Tastes like juicy blackberries in a bowl of cereal. not overbearing, light enough to want another several. tastes great while dipping copenhagen snuff. the bittersweet balance is mouthwatering. as far as mouthfeel, it's creamy, slightly overcarbonated, but has a nice dry finish--where the cereal flavors come in. Good Beer. Get a sixer for your girlfriend and drink it for her."
"This ""beer"" is the kind of beer that minors drink and then say that they like the taste of beer. Quite frankly, a wine cooler has more beer taste than this. It kind of looks like beer upon pouring, but then the saccharine scent and flavor gives it away. My fiance likes it a lot, but she hates beer. Im the complete opposite."
"At this point I've lost a bit of interest. And while the mouthfeel and drinkability are decent, it just doesn't taste like a beer."
"D- This beer is sweet has fizzy. The fruit flavors are pretty natural but they need something to balance them."
"Here is a fun change for those who like to challenge their beer taste buds. As a surprise this beer comes off like a wine cooler. Get past the, this is too sweet to be beer and enjoy the enveloping berry flavor. Try it on your favorite female companion and get her opinion. A man drink Leinenkugel Berry Weiss is like man driving a Mozda Miata or wearing a kilt. Just let go, be free and enjoy the experience."
"Quite interesting and pleasant. Though there are some criticisms, it's still quite drinkable. The berry presence is noticed immediately with its bright ruby color and vibrant carbonation. Not so good on the head retention or body, but the flavors are nice. Tastes and smells of mildly tart and mostly sweet raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, and grapes. Along with that carbonation, the beer becomes very wine-cooler-ish. Fizzy feel on the toung and sweet berry-like in the finish. A sticky-sweetness lingers for too long. A total chick beer."
"I was first coerced to try Leinie's Berry Weiss by my girlfriend who counts it as her favorite. While it isn't my favorite of the style, or the best of the style; it is worth a try."
"The body was light. A tad watery and limited carbonation. Overall this is not a beer, its a wine cooler."
"The pour, rose red color, medium bodied texture were all fine  just not very drinkable with that soda pop berry flavor. Closer to a alco pop malt beverage than a brew."
"If you want beer flavor, look elsewhere. Berry Weiss looks okay; it has an interesting rosey-gold color. That's where the resemblence to beer ends, though. It's tastes and smells like a grape alcopop, or maybe a wine cooler. There are no hops to be found, and the malt is smothered by cloying grape flavors. As a ""drink," fine. I wouldn't refuse it if someone offered me one. I just wouldn't go around calling it a beer."
"Overall an excellent beer. Quite refreshing compared to most beers, in my opinion."
"I think this is categorized correctly as a fruit vegetable beer...it is bold and overdone with the berries...nothing subtle about this....drinkability is average at best because of the sweetness....mixed with Honey weiss it is much better....if they tweaked the recipe it might be better...a good one for your girlfriend who doesn't like beer....not the worst thing ever made but not one I drink unless the wife buys her six-pack of it for the year and let's bottles sit around in the fridge for too long.."
"i should hate this but i dont. probably the best in class for what it is (and i dont mean best fruit beer).. if i was out in minneapolis and it was this or a macro, i'd drink it."
"Cloudy, reddish color with a medium tan head. Aroma is all berries but I can't really tell what berries are used. Maybe blackberries? Taste has more of that sweet berry juice flavor. Fine at first sip, sick by the time I'm midway through. I like a sweeter beer from time to time but this one needs more complexity and something to couterbalance the berries. Plus the berry flavor isn't really all that good. Tastes a little fake. Not a terrible beer and maybe refreshing after a workout in the hot summer heat, but so is kool aid."
"Beer poured a nice colored red (definately not a traditional beer color, but nice looking anyway). Nice head on it, but didn't stay around long. The aroma was a wonderful berry aroma without a hint of any real beer aromas. Taste is almost sickeningly sweet, almost like a soda. Flavor of berry concentrate overpowers all other flavors, especially the wonderful flavors of a traditional weiss. Definately not a food beer as every food I ate with this beer, made it taste nasty."
"The name is German for White Berry. Hm. Are there any white berries? Perhaps they are trying to tell us it is a Weiss type beer, flavored with berries. The appearance is weird  kind of a salmon/coral color. A nice size foamy head that disappears without a trace. Aroma is also weird, like a floral Rhine wine. Aroma smells like a coal-tar derivative berry extract, no hops, no malt, (no cigar). Initial taste is somewhat malty, but that is overwhelmed by the honey-sweet BERRY flavoring. A thin, watery beer that leaves a nasty taste in your mouth. Eek."
"Poured a light reddish berry color with very little head. It smelled like a wine cooler mixed with a coors light. But to if I had to describe the taste I would say it smelled of berrys and with a hint of malt. It tasted like a mix of strong berry concentrate with a slight node of hop. Overall this beer was ok but nothing I would run out and grab again."
"Best off the fresh pour while the carbonation is still active. If it sits or warms, can't do it. Drink cold while your hot. It goes down fast with a nice little kick to it."
"This beer reminded me very much of B-to-the-E in taste, smell, and appearance. Pinkish purple color, smells of grain and berry flavoring. Taste is actually quite unpleasent, sweet but has an odd funkiness about it from the malt. Not very good, I like B-to-the-E better than this, but not by much."
"It was the first beer I'd seen which was a purplish color. It smelled nice, but nothing to great. The taste is good, but has no real beer flavor to it. It is very drinkable with the sweet taste, however it does not taste much like beer. As a college student, I would recommend this to the coeds, but not so much for any true beer fans."
"This is exhibit no. 1 on the list of out-of-balance fruit beers. To clarify - I like it and in the right situation would drink it. The low grades simply reflect that Leine's Berry Weiss just isn't much of a beer and doesn't, for the most part, meet the minimal standard requirements. Looks, smells and tastes like a berry flavored malternative."
"Went down well with strawberry shortcake. A little more tart than typical wine coolers, but along the same lines."
"Pours the color of red grapefruit with a thin pinkish head. Smells very sweet, grapes and raspberries. It goes quickly down hill from there. Tastes like sugary sweet fruity Kool-Aid with a bit of toasted wheat that is the only remotely redeeming flavor. The mouthfeel was thick and syrupy. Leinie's is usually reliably mediocre, and I can rely on them when faced with bad beer choices, but this one didn't sit well with me at all."
"This one pours a dark pink color with an off-white head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave behind much lacing. Pretty. Very sweet aroma of raspberries, but not tart at all. The malts and hops don't come through well because of the strenght of the fruit. The flavor is the same as the aroma. Lots of sweet raspberry taste with just a hint of beer in the back. Good and extremely easy to drink. It's just not very beer-like."
"For the malternative crowd, this is probably good. I've got a buddy who is hopelessly addicted to sweet ciders, as well, and he loves this stuff. I personally don't care for the sweeter beers, and this definitelly falls into that category."
"At least once a summer I find myself picking this beer up. The beer pours a dark purple that leads to an impressive head. I can smell berries (raspberry maybe blueberry?) and canno't detect the alcohol. Mouthfeel is different, I have thought the Leinie's carbonates their beers a little too much that leads to beer gut, this beer is no exception, often times the carbonation overcomes the beer. That aside the beers tastes of a berry flavored malt, some say this is a wine cooler, but I disagree, in my opinion the beer is a little thicker than that. Beer tastes better cold and due to the carbonation it is not very drinkable, not a session beer by no means. However, one should try this at least once a year when it is season."
"I'll admit limited knowlege on fruit beer style. But, I feel this beer was just to sweet. I feel they could've done better evening out the berries and the hop and malt taste."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium pink color with two fingers of head. There is just a little lacing. The smell is very fruity, lots of raspberry. Very sweet, almost smells like Lindeman's Framboise. The taste starts out good, with a lot of sweet berries up front. The finish is wheaty and somewhat phenolic. A little off-putting. The body is a little light and watery. The drinkability is just fair as well, mostly due to the taste."
"I have to say, I like this drink, but as a beer goes, it is not exactly a stellar offering. The beer pours a pinkish color, just sort of unnatural for beer. I could handle it if this were brewed with the berry juice, but it is just flavored with it. There is not much coming through in the nose but the berry sweetness. I get blackberries and raspberries from the smell. I like a nice berry wheat beer, if the berry is involved in the fermentation. Tasting the drink, the berry sweetness kick you hard first. After swallowing, there is a hint that you are drinking a beer, but it is just an afterthought. I have to give this a bit of a kick on the drinkability, as I have been known to kill a 6 of this in a night, but because it is flavored with juice, it can't be more than slightly above average."
"This ""beer"" of a wine-cooler actually started out nice enough, but I've quickly found that I wouldn't want more than one, it's so sickly sweet. Actually, this would probably go really well mixed 60/40 with a really good IPA or hearty stout, so as to offset the sweetness with some hop flavor and bitterness."
"I'm not going to say that every beer drinker is going to like Berry Weis, though I do think that every beer drinker should try it. It's truly in a class by itself."
"Pours a cloudy pink/peach color with a very thin white head which disappeared quickly. There was no lace on the glass at all. This kind of looks to be the color of a raspberry lambic, only a shade or two lighter. The smell is of sweet berries, blackberries, peaches, maybe some raspberry. The taste is very, very sweet, a great amount of blackberry flavor with no hop flavor or bitterness at all. It even seemed a little winey towards the end. Very smooth, with no real peaks of flavor. Very light body, and highly carbonated and fuzzy. This seems right for this type of beer. Overall, didn't seem like a weiss beer at all. Too sweet for me, but not horrible."
"Poured a cloudy purplish-pink color with a large foamy pink head. The head quickly dissipated to a bubbly pink film. No mistaking the scent... that's definitely berry! Taste is initially like a berry wine cooler, but not quite as sweet and followed by a slight taste of wheat and malt... just barely enough to call this a beer! Mouthfeel is thin but pretty well carbonated. I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these. However, this really isn't as horrible as some of the other reviews make it out to be!"
"Berry Weiss reminds me of that classic Cheers episode in which Norm talks about eating at a restaurant that serves artificial meat. He specifically mentions 'bef' and 'loobster' as two of his favorites. Maybe this stuff should be called 'ber' or 'bere' since it doesn't much resemble beer."
"Bad, yet I keep seeing this every summer, so someone is drinking it (or buying it to try, saying EEK! and dumping)."
"This is truly a Hideous beer. The berry is cloying and artificial, the honey is sweet and the appearance is a down-right frightening and unatural pink. The taste has kind of puckering that reminds me a little of the mouthfeel of a wheat, but it lacks all other charecteristics of a wheat. My mother-n-law loves them but it just doesn't taste like a beer to me. I suppose it might be a good cross-over beer but it is a long, long journey from this beer to anything respectable."
"Another one of my least favorite beer styles. This one was too berry and way too sweet tasting for me. It had a small white creamy head with fine sized bubbles. The body was cloudy with carbonation observed and the hue was berry. The nose was heavily berry and the taste was very sweet, tart, sour and tangy. The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth with a thin-watery texture and light bodied. There was a fair amount of lacing with this beer."
"On a second tasting, I had it straight out of the bottle to avoid the disturbing blue color. Even then, you get a vaguely Trix-flavored mess."
"Simply ghastly. Poured a creepy pinkish color. The bottle noted blackberrys used in the brewing, but the aroma was more raspberry candy. Cloyingly sweet berry flavor. If there is beer beneath this onslaught of berry syrup, I can't find it. This is more like some malternative berry cooler than beer. I toughed it out through half the bottle, and decided life is to short to struggle on with finishing the beer."
"Candy. Poured pink and light, like lemonade not beer. Very strange head that left a high honey and berry smell. I liked the smell becuase I like fruity smells in my home. Unfortunately I don't like them in my beer. I didn't taste beer in this beverage, I tasted far too much candy like sweetness. I may have to use this for a marinade sometime, but we'll see. The mouthfeel was weak and left the berry taste for too long. I can drink this again but if I'm offered something else I'd probably leave it for the teenagers to drink, not that I condone that behavior....... ;)"
"It say on the bottle it is brewed ""...by 73 people who care."" I don't know what they care about because it sure isn't the taste of this stuff. Tastes like shook up Boones Farm poured into a dirty coffee cup. Looks like pink lemonade, beer shouldn't look like that. If you like Zima, but feel it isn't sweet enough for you give this stuff a try. I don't know what it is, but it ain't beer!"
"Color is orangy lightish yellow, trying to be red, but thinning, fluffy loose head thats light greyish pink, fades and fizzes away pretty fast, leaves soapy, drippy lace. Smell is light of strawberry and raspberry with a wheaty touch and sharp tint of clean floral hops noted underneath. Taste is a weaker version of any decent fruit beer, light, crisp, lightly flavored of raspberry and strawbeery I guess, its hard to determine cuz its a little much and unmixed, very juice like but watered down quite a bit. Feel is lightly creamy but watery and a thin finish. Its a fine summer drink, but more then one of these and it could get tiresome. Give me a good hefe instead."
"pours out a pink lemonade colour, with a big pink foamy head which leave rings of lace. never seen a beer of this shade before. big time berry aromas. hard to pick out any ""weiss"" characteristics. previous reviewers who hinted at the fact this could be confused with a wine cooler or other malt beverage have it nailed. too sweet and full of wild berries. while not undrinkable in its own right...for a beer this is ""gone wild"". i can't imagine drinking too many of these in one sitting. it's just too much. now...i could see mixing this with the honey weiss in the middle of summer floating down the apple river in somerset, wisconsin with many bikini clad home grown minnesota and wisconsin babes sharing in the sweet nectar. um...that's beside the point and this is not really a beer. try something else."
"A variation is a 'Honey Berry'. Half Leinie's Berry Weiss and half Honey Weiss. The combination cuts some of the sweetsness in the Berry Weiss alone and makes the drink a little bit more tolerable. I tried one for the first time years ago at a concert at Alpine Valley where they had a Leinie Lodge set up and were pouring pitchers for those who were interested."
"What can i say except that this reminds me of a wine cooler or something along those lines. Luckily i was given one of these and didnt make the mistake of buying a whole sixer. Some artificial berry flavors mixed into a standard beer. Skip this poser."
"Still - a nice change of pace and a refreshing libation on a hot day - or with a sweet dessert for that matter."
"This is an amber beer that exhibits a pink tint. It pours with a creamy head and displays good retention. The aroma is similar to a wine cooler, heavy on the berries with maybe a touch of malt. The flavor is also wine coolerish, heavy on the berries as well. The finish is a little too sweet, but the mouthfeel is decent. I couldn't drink a lot of these, but it was a nice experience."
"Berry juice colored. Minimal head. Fruity sort of very berry HiC-like aroma. Not much beer flavor to balance the fruit. Flavor is all fruit juice. The slightest hint of wheat flavor is present. Mouthfell is thin with effervescent carbonation. Not bad if your into fruit beers. Also may be a good cross over beer for some macro drinkers."
"If you are in the mood for a berry weiss excursion, look no further. If lacking in anything, it seems to be the alcohol content that  could be more for my taste."
"I wouldn't drink this all-of-the-time but it is a nice change-of-pace beer."
"(A side note:  Last summer, at my sister's gift opening party  at my mom and dad's house the Sunday after her Wedding, there were coolers macrobrews available.  Among others, Leiney's Honey and Berry were available.  ZAP and I hid in the garage with the coolers during the actual ""gift opening.""  We discovered a half and half mix of berry and honey actually tasted halfway decent.  It went down pretty easy on a day we both were experiencing minor hang overs.)"
"I don't like this one. It's got a great smell, looks well. The problem is it's too fruity not beery enough. When you buy their mixed-case leave this ones for the youngins or the wimmins."
"And I am from Wis, so I should be biased.  But as a local, let me tell you to stay the hell away from this."
"Sweet-berry disaster in my opinion...way above and beyond the call of a fruit beer in that there's no trace of balance for the sweetness and little mouthfeel to balance the over-carbed fizziness...can be refreshing on first impression but the over sweet and bubbly taste and cloying swallow annoy me more with every sip...not recommended..."
