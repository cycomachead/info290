"Very easy-drinking and smooth. Nothing too exciting but definitely enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Not a really good effort from GLB. The soapy finish is off putting."
"Very smooth, excellent flavor. Especially good when on draught."
""
""
""
"This is a subpar beer in my opinion. Perhaps it's just the style but this one wasn't doing it for me."
""
""

"This is easily the best beer I have had in this style and one of the few that I would drink outside of March if it were available.  Nice clean lager with a taste of caramel, toasted malt, and a bit of woodsy hops at the end.  Super malty, super sessionable, great beer."
""
"Deep amber / light ruby color with great clarity. One finger white head. Moderate toasty malt aroma, not much hop presence noticeable at all. Slight sweetness in the flavor with a dry finish. Clean and smooth. Medium bodied. Nothing groundbreaking here, but a solid ale for anyone looking for an  easy drinking beer with the focus on the malt."
""
""
""
""
"Nice smooth beer, slight bitter taste which is good"
""

"This is the only Great Lakes  I have liked. IT was sample number 9 so that may have been the only reason I liked it!"

"Seasonal favorite! Always excited when this one hits the taps"
"Pleasantly surprised!  I'm generally not a red ale fan. Very malty and bready with some citrus hints.  Great Lakes does a good job."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice malted finish.  Not my usual type of beer, but great for the time of year and I will drink this again."
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with 1/2"" slight cream colored head that disappeared rather quickly. Malty aroma some hops an a bit of yeast. Tastes is nice, malty, some sweetness, smooth with just the right amount of hops. Decent carbonation, very smooth. Another good one by GLBC, I'll drink some more of this."
""
"3.7/5: An Irish red done right"
""
""
""
"This is another one you need to let warm up as it changes the taste quite a bit. The first one I had I tried it while it was still too cold and was under-impressed. It pours with a red gold appearance with a nice head - vigorous pour of 3 fingers - that dissipates quickly to a hold finger head but has some nice lacing on the  drink down. Nice malty flavor with a light to medium mouthfeel."

"great go to ale,yes"
"O- Ok. Would be better with food. Decent toasted flavors."

"O- Very good beer, nothing special or overwhelming but it's very tasty and drinkable. It's a well-executed beer which is the MO of GLBC. Buy with confidence."

"Overall:  This is another great beer from Great Lakes!  Great flavors of toasted malt and brown sugar, beautifully balanced with some hoppy bitterness.  Delicious!"
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer and one that I highly recommend. The beer is very balanced and worthy of the style."
"Great Lakes Conway's Irish Ale brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co. This Ale has an ABV of 6.50%  The ale pours out a nice light brown color, with a nice white head.  The smell of  Great Lakes Conway's Irish Ale is rich, with flavor. You pick up on grains, malts and hops.  Now for the taste it bold with flavor. You pick up on malts and grains in this brew. Conway's Irish Ale has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew. The mouthfeel is nice clean and rich. There is a nice smoothness to this brew. It is hard to pick up on the 6.5% in this brew, not saying that it a bad thing. Great Lakes Brewing Co., did a nice job with this one.  I would buy this brew again.  Overall I'm giving Conway's Irish Ale a 4.5 out of 5."
""
"As far as red ales go, this one is exceptional. Unique flavor and smooth mouthfeel."
"Pours orange with good clarity and long lasting head of tannish foam that clings in streaks and spots.  Nose is malty and sweet with caramel and a buttery toasty nutty scent.  Light floral and grass with a vague fruitiness.  Sweet grain.  Taste follows the nose.  Extremely pleasant.  Smooth  malt brings plenty of flavor to the palate as the hops are just blushing in the background with a light fruitiness and sweet grass.  Mouthfeel is medium and this finishes not quite dry with a supple malty resonance.  The hops are only in the finish for balance and this one drinks like a charm.  An easy going laid back sipper from great lakes."

"Overall: Quite possibly my favorite Irish Red, and one of the GLBC seasonals I looks forward to in the lineup. Easy to drink, and easy to savor and dissect."
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a crystal clear dark ruby amber hue. Aroma and taste is of sweet mildly toasted malts and grains, mild fruity notes and hops bitterness. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finishes with toasted malt, grains and light fruity tones and mild hops bitterness, has a pleasant mild nutty after taste. Overall nothing really stand out but still a good drinking brew."
""
""
""
""
"Clear copper color, I expected a little darker. Not much head. Malty sweet nutty aroma. No hops in the smell or taste. Taste is quite sweet. Medium body and carbonAtion"

"Well-crafted. In fact, nearly every beer in GL's lineup has been good. I'd never had them before last week."
""

"Smooth easy drinker from Great Lakes. Pours a brilliant copper color with a very thin white head and light lacing. Nose of caramel malts. Taste is up front light brown sugar and caramel with a crisp clean aftertaste that satisfies. Light carbonated mouthfeel makes it an excellent session beer and a good beginner brew for the new beer nut palate. It is worth noting that this beer varies a bit year to year, just like many Great Lakes brews. Some times more malty, sometimes thinner, but all in all highly quaffable."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours orange red with a small white head that dissipates but leaves a tad of lacing. Smells of lightly roasted barley with a little but ad fruit, grape jumping out the most. Tastes of medium roasted malt with a bit of creaminess. Beer is light-medium bodied with good carbonation and nice finish. Overall a pretty good beer."

"Overall: I don't know the style well, but the BJCP guidelines overall description fits this to a tee. ""An easy-drinking pint. Malt-focused with an initial sweetness and a roasted dryness in the finish."" I swear I did not read that until AFTER I rated it."

"Appearance is a reddish-copper color with a thin layer of head. The nose is lightly malty. The flavor profile is clean and relatively light with a focus on malty sweetness. The finish is semi-dry and very pleasant. This is a very sessionable red ale."

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with tall, long-lasting, fluffy white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of caramel malt, citrus hops and some fruit. Body is full and crisp. Earthy hops, caramel malt and tropical fruit fill the mouth.. Finish is long and semi-dry. Well made brew."

"all in all, it's a fine drinking beer... had the one - would've gone well with some buttery, flaky crust sort of food (pot pie?) if I'd had it.... when I was offered another one on the house, I gladly said yes.... it doesn't blow you away, but I would certainly pick up a sixer of this"
""
"OVERALL: Slightly sweeter than I prefer, but without that sweetness the body would not have been as solid, so I'm good with it. Great Lakes still does not suck in my book! Great to try a new (to me) seasonal from them, I'm thrilled that the woman was able to bring some back from the brewery for me."
"Overall: Extremely drinkable even at 6.5%. Not the normal Irish ale for sure. Almost has a New Belgium Fat Tire appeal in the smoothness and drinkability department. Have already went through 3 six packs, and I got another as this will be gone soon. Cheers!"

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 4/7/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cal that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, pear, apple, raisin, floral, herbal, pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, raisin, pear, floral, herbal, light pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, raisin, pear, floral, herbal, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of bready malt, yeast ester, and light-moderate hop flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Irish red ale. All around good balance and robustness of bready malt, yeast ester, and light-moderate hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"An interesting, enjoyable American interpretation of an ""Irish Red"" - a bit hoppy and more alcoholic than traditional but it works for a different slant on the style."
""
""
""
""

"Bread, biscuit, honey, and caramel. Sweet and malty."

"overall a great beer by any means. however i did not enjoy it as much as other great lakes brews. that could be because GL couldn't make a bad beer if they tried."
""
""
"I'm not a huge malt fruitiness fan, but this at least has a nice malt backbone for support."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Nice orange-amber color with small white head and minimal messy lacing. Aroma and flavor are predominately amber malts, with no bitterness and a slight sweet fruitiness. Rich flavor, crisp and clean, with a light mouthfeel. 6.5% abv is completely masked and very easy to drink. Pretty good overall."
""
""
""
""
"Sticky sweet mouthfeel. Good body, flavors linger."
"O: Overall this is a good beer weather it is one that you want to have with a meal or sit on the couch on a Sunday and drink while watching a few games. I would definitely drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fits the definition of an Irish Ale, similar to a English Pale Ale with caramel malts.  Not chemical/nasty or flashy, just a good ale."

"Overall: This just seemed like an underwhelming Irish Red Ale. It certainly was not bad, but there are better examples of this style. The complexities were present, they just failed to balance this one out. Worth checking out if you are unfamiliar with this style."

"My favorite Irish/Red Ale of them all. So smooth and easy-drinking. Yes, I am quite biased in favor of Great Lakes Brewing Company because one of my best friends worked there for nine years and I've spent many a fine afternoon/evening at the place. But my preference for GLBC beer is primarily because the beers are almost always outstanding. Cheers!"

"Conway's Irish Ale....is good. The label is awesome! Great Lakes is probably the best thing to come out of Cleveland since the Browns left for Baltimore. This beer pours a nice amber with no head and no lace. The scent is mostly caramel malt with biscuits. The taste is nothing remarkable or noteworthy...just solid. It is well balanced from start to finish. The mouthfeel is medium in body with so so carbonation. Overall it is a decent sessionable beer and worth a try."

"O - a truly underrated ale in today's craft beer world. A real hallmark on the roots of GLBC and what they are about. This Irish ale gets back to the basics of crafting exceptional brews and with the kind of stuff that's being created in the U.S. right now we sometimes forget these simple yet brilliant ales. This is reviewed based on what they accomplished with the idea they had. This wasn't intended to start a new trend or be an insanely flavored giant. This is the basics of brewing and done perfectly. Sometimes a beer doesn't have to be a 9% abv brew to get a high rating. I applaud beer like this done right."

"This is a little underwhelming for Great Lakes, but overall it's not too bad. Easily sessionable. 3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my first of the style, I enjoyed it a bit, although I know I'd get tired of it after one bottle (much like I did this time around). The intense caramel and toffee malts are nice at first but can be a touch overwhelming after twelve ounces. Tasty brew, no doubt, but one is certainly enough for me."

"I don't drink many red ales but was pretty impressed with this one. If this were distributed in my area it would definitely be in my refrigerator as a go-to beer."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: drinking this i went back and forth if it was good/great. I ended up at great. its near the end of its freshness (~20 days away) so I want to try it fresh next year but this beer is another great one from Great Lakes"
""
""
""
"The bottle indicates its about three months old, which should not be old enough to lose its Pop. The flavors are good but I feel like if it were at its freshest this could be more robust."
""
""
""
"O- A great beer to keep you on your toes and awaken all your senses."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good session beer, a little to tangy for my tastes. The sweetness in the smell does not come through in the taste and the whole thing has the carbonation level of soda. Not bad but this could be better."
"This isn't too bad. It's a really excellent balance of sweet malt and hops. I'm not really digging the slight caramel aspect to it, but it's still well done."
""
"Overall - not my favorite from Great Lakes, actually I think this one is my least favorite. Still an ok beer tho."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A good beer that I'd drink again, this one may have suffered from sloppy barkeeping."
""
""
"O: Solid, but not a standout"
""
""
""
""
"This is an easy drinking, if not very challenging Irish ale. Minimal amounts of that mildly fruity and leafy thing that seems prevalent in the style. Decent enough to drink, though not overly interesting or mind blowing. I hope this is an accurate sample of this beer. Really, I just tried it because it was one of the Great Lakes beers I had yet to check out. Next!"
""
""
""
"Pours reddish with a nice head. I rarely drink this style and bought because of the date. Malts and grain in the nose. The taste is malt and a strong hop presents. Overall it blends nicely. Medium carbination. It exceeded what I thought I would get in this style."
""
""
"it took me 8 years fo find this beer it has a great beer smell , and it pour nice in a glass its not red maybe dark orange goes down smooth but it taste like im swallowing a flower big disappoint here for all of you who likes good for you but i cant wait for there other wonderful beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An all around good beer, I can dig it. I would buy this one again, always a fan of GLBC."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a simple, well made beer. Four ingredients that are finely balanced"
""
"Solid, quaffable beer. One of the better for the style."
""
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable for folks that enjoy the malt forward style (I do). Alcohol is well hidden and this beer is almost sessionable. Pairs well with food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid beer from Great Lakes which I'll likely buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – As should be of no surprise this is another good brew by Great Lakes. It has a nice blend of roasted and sweet flavors while still maintaining great drinkability but still remaining quite proficient in flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a copper-orange color with a fluffy head. Toasted malt and nuts aroma...gently sweet, bready, slightly fruity. Tasty malt, biscuit, toffee, graham cracker, and tea flavors. Medium bodied and smooth. Sort of chewy and dry in the finish. An enjoyable and easily drinkable take on a style that is oftentimes pretty boring."
"D: im glad GLBC took this style and made it bigger. a style that could definitely use the meat, this is well welcomed. lots and lots of caramel flavors and aromas. if you are a fan of irish red's, pick this up."
"O) A pretty solid session beer to enjoy this time of year. No wow factor, but quite enjoyable. Glad to recommend."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of moderate intensity, leading to a mouthfeel that is somewhat fizzy at first, then foamy, then a mix of creamy and slightly watery mouthfeels. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer for those who love the lighter yet maltier brews. Great Lakes makes some very tasty brews and this one fits perfectly in their family."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just another solid offering from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
"Price Point - $8.59/6pk 12oz bottles"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a rather simplistic beer. The esters from the yeast provide most of the flavor offering some fruitiness. The malt is prevalent, but it really only adds caramel. This was a nice beer to try once, but this isn't something I would seek out again."
""
""
""
""
"I'd have this again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"While I wasn't expecting to get blown away by this beer, this was just a little underwhelming for a brewery like Great Lakes. While a good Irish Red (keep style in mind) and very much sessionable, there are a few caveats that take away, in my opinion. Worth checking out, however."

"Beautiful amber red pour, inch head, excellent lacing. Smells of caramel and malt. Taste is of roasted malt, and a bit of vanilla and peppery zest. Mouthfeel is thick, wonderfully balanced and very smooth. I was really surprised by this, the flavor profile and smell is somewhat simple, though its very smooth with just the right amount of zesty finish, creamy and that makes for a very enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a nice amber with a good white head leaving a nice lacing. The aroma was a pleasant light malt. The taste was a very satisfying bit of malt with a peppery finish. The feel is medium and dry. This is a very pleasant beer. It is well put togethet and could easily be consumed en masse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is exceptional for its naturally roasted flavor, as well as its unpretentious drinkability."
""
""
""
"O- 6.5% ABV but goes down like a good 4.5% session beer. This is definitely brewed closer to style than FFF Brian Boru but I like the Brian Boru a little better. Both are great, seek em!"
""
"O- Another winner from Great lakes."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body has a nice reddish color body with a small head that lays down quickly. The smell has a nice maltyness to it. The taste has a nice balance of sweet malt and hops. It also has some fruiteyness to it also. The mouth feel is great and overall a really good, easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't really like reds so this was a big surprise. Well done GLBC!"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how fresh and easy drinking it was. The fruitiness was overbearing at first, and was still quite strange by the end, but the balanced through the middle saved it. It was nice for the style, but seemed to be lacking just a bit in every category."
""
""
"O - A good Irish Ale, although it is not my favorite style. But the sweetness from the fruit flavors is quite enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
"This beer appears a fiery orange with good clarity. Thick, dense white head present with great retention and tons of lacing. The nose features a light earthy hop character along with a punch of malty sweetness. The taste starts malty and sweet and then gives way to a tea like hop bitterness along with grass and herbs. The taste finishes slightly bland. The body is moderate and the carbonation is mellow. Overall, this beer has a lot of character, but the flavors don't work for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very drinkable and delicious beer from Great Lakes. I've had it several times on tap and would recommend it."
"This is a very solid Irish Red Ale and probably one of the better examples of the style that I’ve had recently. This was well balanced and flavorful with a crisp and quenching feel to it. I could easily drink a few of these."
"Flavor is primarily sweet toast and jam with some caramel notes and a nice mild hop presence. There is a faint touch of spice (nutmeg?). Mouthfeel is thin-to-firm. Overall, this is a very nice, enjoyable representation of the style that I would be happy to drink again. I do wish it had a little more going for it in the hop department though."
" The taste is good but comes off very smooth and lager-like at times with a slight toasted grain character and mild caramel notes intermingling. the finish has an almost lager-like flavor with herbal hops enhancing the malt but leaving a slight dry effect. Overall this is a very drinkable Irish Red. I wasn't expecting one with the amount of alcohol, but it is well balanced and very drinkable for the strength I enjoyed this more than most I have had of the style."
""
""
"O: Not very familiar with the style, and I usually appreciate breadiness in beers, but this one tilts the scales flavor-wise. It's not got the biggest malt backbone to carry it, or any hoppiness. This would make a good food-beer, it's light enough to be swiggable and has those robust toastinesses that I think could ride well over salty, greasy stuff. Not for me, though."
"O: Another winner from Great Lakes. Their Conway's is my favorite Irish Red, and one I can easily recommend to those looking for a better, unique alternative to Smithwick's."
""
"A nice beer for those cool spring nights but not my favorite offering from Great Lakes. This beer looks very nice and has some aroma complexity and is very steady on taste and feel. I would like to try it again on draft to see how it differs."
""
""
""
"O: I had this one after a Brian Boru and the two just don't compare. This one is much more malty with a lots of fruit (which I wasn't expecting) and very low on the hops and bitterness. Glad to have tried it, but couldn't see coming back to it."
""
""
""
"Overall, not the best Irish ale. However, i do think it is worth drinking and would try it again."
"Pours completely transparent, somewhere between amber and ruby in color with a healthy off-white head. Aroma is mild and unobtrusive. I had no idea what to expect from this beer in terms of flavor, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First sip invokes a sweet, malty, lightly spiced flavor with a very smooth feel. It's easy for caramel malt to become cloying if one's not careful, but I don't find that to be the case here. There's just enough citric hop flavor to balance the sweetness, making this brew very easy to drink. My only grievance is that things fall apart a bit on the back end, where an indefinable and slightly metallic aftertaste overstays its welcome. That transgression is fairly minor though in the grand scheme of things, and I would readily endorse this irish red ale as a fine session beer and something worth trying if you're looking for something a little off the beaten path."
""
""
"Bronze pour with small head that dissipates quickly leaving no lace. Smell is biscuit, caramel, grassy hop. Taste is cereal, caramel, a bit nutty, a hint of sweetness. Finish is dryish and clean. Body holds together well, slightly prickly carbonation on a semi-creamy feel. Pretty good."
""
"Fairly balanced with a touch more hops to boost. Medium-bodied with a sharp, yet not intense hoppiness."
"Notes: there is something about Great Lakes' ales; Burning River, Nosferatu and now Conway. They all have a cocoa aftertaste. Conway is hoppier than any Irish Ale I have ever had. I don't like anything about this beer. The color is insipid, the aroma not to the style, the taste out of sync."
""
""
""
""
"O- My goodness, I really like Great lakes. I do hope this is a bad bottle or my taste buds are shot (just had a vanilla coffee porter) this beer is almost vomit inducing..."
""

"4.0 D: This is a thoroughly solid beer that goes down far too easily. Though I can't say I'm really that impressed with any one aspect of this beer, I'm really sad that I only have one. I would do horrible things for a couple more right now. Love the toast."

"Bought a six for around eight bucks. Pours a nice deep copper color with good thick sticky cream colored head. Smell is biscuity malt. Smells really good. Taste is also biscuity malt, deep and rich. Slight alcohol on the finish, but not enough to get in the way. A really good, malty substantial brew. If only all Irish Ales were this deep and flavorful. One of the few good things to ever come out of the state of Ohio!"

"O - I've had this in previous years and thought it was better? But still very good. A nice malty, drinkable Irish Ale. It showcacses Great Lakes base malt perhaps better than any of their other beers."
""
""
""
"The taste is really about exactly what an Irish Red should be. Malt driven, not too balanced."
""
""
""
"Beautiful dark color for this beer. The flavor is very malt centered but still well balanced. It lets the malts give off a nice sweetness with the hops it balances out nicely. Pours a nice two finger head with good retention but not much for lacing. It's not my favorite brew from Great Lakes but I get it every year when it comes around."

"O - An easy drinking Irish red. I wish I had gotten a bit more hops out of this, but not bad as is."

"O: a decent brew, drinks nicely and cleanly, i could drink a sixer of this with no qualms"

"O: Not what I expected from Great Lakes, but worth the single bottle I bought."

"Toasted malts up front, with slight graininess. Sweetish caramel and fruit fill up the palate. Toasted malt notes throughout. Modest herbal hop presence gets a little lost in the malt. Some herbal bitterness in the finish, but mostly lingering fruit and honey toast. Medium-bodied, with a nice creamy feel. Not my favorite style, but a nice example of it."

"Overall I thought that this was an Ok beer and a pretty average Irish Red Ale, it didn't have anything that was out of place for the style, but it seemed like the flavors didn't meld as good as they could of and the sweet malts didn't let hardly any other flavors and aromas come through. This beer went down fairly smooth, one went down smooth and I might be able to drink another one but after that I think the sweetness would start to get to me. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was pretty spot on for an Irish Red Ale. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, I think the sweetness needs to be toned down some to make this beer more enjoyable and drinkable. I don't think I would buy this beer again, there are better Irish Red Ales to be found that are more available at the same price. I don't really recommend this beer unless you are a huge Irish Red Ale, I find it to be a pretty middle of the road kind of beer. Great Lakes is a pretty solid brewery and this beer was Ok, but it just wasn't that memorable of beer and it really didn't hold my attention, better luck next time guys."
"O- a perfect irish ale. I will make this brew always around for the beginning of spring"
"Overall- one of the better Irish reds I have had. Great drinkability I could drink several."
"O- Like I said it's a fine beer but there is nothing that transcends the normal Irish Red level for me."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation. The body is just thick enough to allow the flavors to come out without ever becoming sticky or coating. The carbonation is a bit fizzy but does not interfere with the flavors and really helps to make this beer very drinkable."
"O: A solid Irish Red. Fits the bill for the style quite well. It's smooth and straightforward, something Great Lakes has always done well. Very good session beer here, would love to have this during college football season."
"Orange with a nice, lasting head. Nose is mostly sweet malt. Tastes like roasted nuts, caramel and graham cracker with just a touch of orange from the hops--I want to like this more than I do, as there's nothing wrong with it, but ultimately it's just kind of... there? Good malt character, and I enjoyed the three I had, but it's not a beer I'll be buying again."

"Bright, clear, copper pour, with a nice rich, tidy, cream head. Nothing notable in the nose, just some faint sweet grass. Tinny and sweet malts are wrapped around a bouquet of juicy fruit. Picking up hints of orange, lemon and some more of that grass that I smelled. The creamy, watery mouthfeel follows nicely with style. First time trying this, and I found it an interesting and damn fine example. I have come to expect great ""ness"" from this brewery and it continues to not disappoint."

"Overall, this is a nice beer. I like it now with a few months of age on it, and I can see liking it fresh, too."
"O: A pretty decent Irish Red. The malt character really stands out and gives a good flavor to the beer."
"cherry-copper in color with a foamy, soapy, grey and audibly popping head. Sweet caramel biscuits roll out the aroma, along with hints of honeyed oats, bran flakes, molasses snap cookies and a slight copper kiss. Sweet hazelnuts and subtly smooth caramel team with sugared bran for the primary flavor onset. Heartier profile than expected. Sticky toffee chews with Irish cream flavored nougat in the center. Medium-bodied, slightly thick and oily, and a substantive palate load, especially considering its parameters. Sweet caramel creations and dead-on carbonation levels contribute to a formidable, balanced end quotient. Cedar smoothness, butter almond, pistachios and vanilla bring things to a close."
"From notes: 12 oz bottle - Pours a cloudy amber red with a thin white head which dissipates pretty quickly. Aroma of malt, bread, and a hint of hops. Taste is caramel malt, yeast, and faint hops in the finish. Medium bodied with good balance. I am not typically a big Irish Ale fan - but this one is okay.. Would I get it again? Questionable."
"O: I enjoyed this brew a lot -- it is unsung in the Great Lakes lineup and provides a nice example of a superdrinkable amber ale."
"Overall a pleasant beer."
"D - The ABV is quite deceptive here, from drinking it I could swear this was a lot lower. So not quite sessionable, but I don't think that would stop me. Reco."
"Overall: A solid Irish red. I really like the malt flavors. Well balanced and mild."
"O: A very nice beer to kick back and enjoy. Balanced and tasty."
"Varied, interesting, and tempting... this beer is definitely one to try from this company."
"O - Excellent drinkability and taste, overall, even if the brew is a bit middle-of-the-road."
"A really well-rounded and unusually complex Irish red ale here. Superior, and very delicious!"
"O (D) - drinks pretty easy, tastes good. Nothing offensive, but its not something that you can't help drinking."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium light. This is an okay Irish Red Ale, the flavors are not in balanced too malty."
"Unfortunately, this in not one I'm going to finish. Just doesn't fit the style for me and not a pleasant beer overall. Disappointed as I've enjoyed most of GLB other offerings."
"Overall: A pretty solid Irish red."
"Overall - was a decent beer, not that i expected in the taste based on the smell. overall would be a good session beer."
"The Rest: Body is on the thin side of medium and the finish is fairly fast and clean. A decent beer of a style I don't really care for all that much, for what it's worth."
"O. Not a bad beer for when wanting an easy drinking Irish beer, not as strong of a tea taste as most Irish beers, but nothing I would go out of my way for either."
"O: A decent beer that has a great look and an very nice feel, this one's a bit lacking in flavor. Worth a try but pretty run-of-the-mill overall."
"Dry, light, easy drinking. I don't have a wealth of experience with this style, but I enjoyed this beer."
"O: Overall, a pretty good Irish red. Nothing extraordinary, but solid nonetheless. The flavors and aroma are simple, but executed well."
"Drinkability - This beer was just ok for me. Not bad at all. Fairly easy to drink and could be enjoyed by most any craft beer enthusiast. ""Reds"" are not my favorite style, but they are ok on occasion. Don't go out of your way for this, but if you see it, maybe pick up a single and give it a try."
"Somehow this guy got swept under the rug following my recent jaunt to the Firk. Ordered last, to compliment my share of a burger (tasty stuff, I tells ya). It pours a clear copper topped by a finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose comprises caramel, light greens, oak, and a light-ish dash of orange peel. The taste follows fairly closely, with notes of orange peel, light caramel, sweet rice, and a sort of celery-type flavor. Everything has a vague sweetness to it, though a similarly vague bitterness pervades as the finish nears. I'm still not sure if they go together all that well. (I'll get back to ya.) The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a decent brew, especially in the capacity of accompanying the burger, but frankly nothing all that special. I can't really knock any part of it per se, but I also can't rave about them either. You know what I mean."
"This is a pretty good Irish red ale; perhaps a bit heavy on the caramel. I would drink it again. I'm glad I got it as an extra, as it probably isn't a beer I would have seeked out."
"This is one fine Irish ALe by Great Lakes Brewery. I've been drinking cases of it for almost two months. I still can't get enough of it. I saw some bad reviews posted on here,but all I can say is they must of had a bad batch or bad beer on tap.THis seems to be better out of the bottle. It has sweet taste of caramel,a slightly hop bitter after taste.A red color and white foam head. This is my favourite beer by GLBC. I look foward to drinking it next year. O-YEAH!!I like the label design as well.Rock on GLBC!"
"D-4"
"D: Very drinkable, dangerously so. I'd buy this year round if it was available. One of the better Great Lakes products IMHO."
"O- I feel that it could have a stronger taste, but it is still enjoyable. I feel that if I could get this around me I would pick up a six pack from time to time,"
"Overall: Another Irish red that I just don't love."
"O I will never drink another one of these! I'm almost ready to proclaim this thing as awful. Great Lakes is a hit or miss for me and this is clearly a miss. I would say the Cleveland Browns are better than this beer."
"D: I've been cherishing these, but they are definitely a sneaky session beer at 6.5% abv."
"One of the better Irish red beers I have had"
"This pours copper with one finger of light head and active bubbles. The nose is sweet barley malts and fresh hops. The taste is light and grassy, but the sweet malty flavors come on strong. There is a nice bite from the bitterness. There is a graininess that sticks around on the aftertaste longer than I prefer. I would classify this as a crowd pleasing easy drinker, for those who like craft brews anyway. Great pick for a spring cookout."
"Smooth and rich tasting."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, and neither sticky nor dry. A bit watery, but it works for the style and beer in this case. Drinkability is where this beer makes a name for itself, as the sweetness is perfectly leveled to keep the beer going down easy swig after swig. Flavors go well together and the beer just works. Was shocked to see this one is 6.5% abv, as it goes down ridiculously easy.This is a case of a beer being more than the sum of its parts."
"First thing I noticed about this beer is the unique herbal smell as I poured it into the glass. I cannot fully place the smell but it's similar to some sort of vegetable or some less than fresh fruit. Either way, it's not something I want my beer to smell like. The same flavor is in the palate but is milder and at least there is a good malt base with toasted and caramel flavors to make it drinkable. As for appearance, the orange color is less than spectacular and the large amount of unexpained floaties is downright unappealing. Not one I'll drink again."
"O: I could perhaps use a stronger foundation, but still, this is an original, floral, pleasant beer."
"Overall, not bad, the corn flavor is really weird and unexpected, but it's still light and drinkable, a little sticky on the finish, but a crisp and dry ale."
"d - highly drinkable, a nice beer for St. Pat's Day you could have two or three of in a sitting."
"Overall a good red ale that isn't very sessionable for me."
"Notes: This beer is medium bodied, full-flavored, and quite easy to drink. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable. Irish Reds have not always been my favorite of styles, but Conway's is actually quite good."
"Overall, another excellent beer from Great Lakes. Not easy to get in NJ, but its worth it."
"Do your taste buds a solid and try this Irish Red Ale."
"Overall- Excellent beer, my favorite St. Pattys beer by a long shot. You will be hard pressed to find an Irish Red better than this. Highly recommended."
"It wasn't as flavor full as other Irish Ales, but GL's did state this was a ""medium bodied"" beer. I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't need bells and whistles, and simply wants a beer that taste great and will get the job done."
"The beer is light and drinkable, not really my type of beer, but still can be described as light and drinkable. I would lean towards gulping this one down, don't get your hopes up for a supreme sipper. Price-wise, this beer is of good value, but I'd still rather shell out the dough for something better...or bitter...or anything not so generic tasting! Maybe I'm just on my better-beer soap box, but I typically expect more from Great Lakes."
"Drinkable enough, though sweet and malty to the point where one or two of these is about all I can handle."
"D - Incredibly drinkable, a beer you can easily just enjoy throughout the evening."
"D -- It's tasty and appetizing, though I like a little more sweetness -- the high ABV may have fermented out all the sweet malt character. And that vegetal character lingers in the aftertaste, not awful, but sort of distracting. I like Sam Adam's Irish Red a lot, might have to compare these side-by."
"Drinkabilty - Very very high. So easy to drink, not real high in alcohol, i could rip through a 6-pack in no time. Honestly great lakes should make this all the time, not just seasonal. Cant think of a better beer for st. pattys day!"
"D:	The best beer of its class and very drinkable despite it's higher alcohol content"
"Not a bad little beer here from GL. Look is a little 'meh'--color is fine, though nothing special, and there's very little head, even with some swirling. Nose is paler malts, a hint of hops to it, but pretty much a straightforward ale... the red malts don't make much of a play in the nose. Taste follows similar to the nose, and the red malts make a bit of a stronger play, though they are weak at best. Overall, the flavor is a bit lacking, though not necessarily 'off'. Decent full mouthfeel, easy drink. Pretty straightforward ale--it's not going to knock your socks off, but its not going to make you wish you had a BMC."
"D: A very drinkable ale. The flavors are complex enough to make this interesting, yet not so over the top you can drink just one. I expect this has a very broad appeal to the craft lover and non-craft lover. Quite enjoyable. I'll drink this again in a heartbeat."
"Little below a finger's worth of light tan foam, full mix of bubble sizes and types, settles down into a decent layer across the surface, the lacing starts off in thin sheets before breaking into thinner sheets sliding down the glass. Immaculate red amber color that captures light very well, brightening as a result, the bubbles appear haphazardly, you can see some big ones glued to the glass bottom. The nose has a big malty profile emphasizing cocoa, toffee, scone and danish, more breakfast flakes than lunch bread, mix of pepper and pine, at best get generalized white citrus, the peach, apple, pear fruit scents hover in the background. Full-bodied with somewhat sloppy carbonation, foams through the mouth like a gregarious fat guy. There's a tart to outright sour element here which tempers any excesses in the foundational sweetness. More grain bread in play here, some rye too. Still, honey, caramel, chocolate and brown sugar discerned. Orange and lesser pink grapefruit take the baton without a hitch. Apricot, nectarine, peach fruit with a little pineapple for good measure. Finishing with even more chocolate on the scene. While very good not sure how many I could drink in one sitting."
"Overall: A nice little beer in a straightforward style. Worth the try if you're a fan of Irish reds, but its not going to sway you if you aren't."
"while not a complex beer by any shape or form, it was well balanced beer that was smooth and tasty. malty and bready as in the smell, mild hops and an underlying sweetness while titillated my palate (just wanted to find a reason to use the word titillated). it was crisp, adequately carbonated and finished a bit dry. this beer is uber drinkable. I wouldn't call this a session beer, but one that I could easily throw a bunch back and not bat an eyelash."
"D - This is a great beer to drink. No problem drinking this one till you can't stand."
"A good example of the style. Liked the drier flavor."
"Slightly sweet caramel up front wrapped in chewy malt flavor with bread overtones. Finishes dry with a nice toasted oat flavor. Good flavor and a real nice mouthfeel."
"Drink - This beer just didn't do it for me. I can see how it might appeal to some, but I wasn't a huge fan. I would not seek this beer out again."
"Taste-Toffee, toasted malt, caramel, nice little hop bite. Nice and tasty. ESB-like in its quaffability and balance. A good choice come March 17."
"On tap from a pub in DC poured into pint glass. Pours an amber red-orange color with a light creamy cream-colored head which quickly fizzles, yet retains a nice lace throughout the session. This irsh red ale has a hoppy, toasty, fruity, nutty, sweet malty flavors as well as a nice bitter hop counterbalance. Very full, creamy, mild carbonated, and sticky mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer for session drinking."
"Another win for the Great Lakes, it may not be my favorite Irish Red Ale but it's a good one for sure."
"D - If this evening is any proof, several tall pints go down quite easily during games of trivia. Another very quaffable brew from GL. While the bottle is tasty, the drafts were even better. This is one drinkable beer."
"Beer is medium bodied and easy drinking. Mildly sweet on the front end, a little bitter at the back but the bitterness is from a type of roasted grain that I find a little odd. I know that's a brewing trick, add a little roasted grain at mash out for color, that's probably what happened here. I enjoyed it and would have it again."
"Simple, but very good."
"Paired very well with some orange chicken, fwiw. Nice work, GLBC."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - This beer is dangerously addictive and is hard to stop drinking. It is an impressive red ale that I will be sad to see go out of season."
"D - Wow I have know ales to be either really light or heavy in flavor but this one seems balanced and creamy. ABV is well masked. Another solid offering from Great Lakes."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent malt scent that boasts of pale and biscuit malts. It has a mild caramel malt sweetness and a dry Irish ale yeast aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with some toasted/bready notes. This has got to be the most complex Irish ale I've ever tried. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer. It's full flavored with excellent malt character and a smooth finish."
"This beer pours a clear bright red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of tea leaves, toast, caramel and toffee. The taste is slightly maltier than the aroma, but still quite balanced. There are some very nice strong tea notes that blend well with the toffee, and caramel of the malt. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this beer is really, really good, and spot on for the style. I will certainly be drinking a lot of this while its around."
"All in All... this is a pleasant beer. Probably a good choice for someone that is leaving the standard Miller, Bud, Coors line of beers and starting to try new things. This one will certainly not frighten you away from the Micro-Brewery scene."
"This is being reviewed from the cleveland, oh airport. That's right trying new beers on the road. This is a nice tasting and smelling beer. Sweet and malty without a lot of hops. Smells brown sugar and nutmeg and tastes the same as well. What it's lacking in is presentation. Not a lot of head or carbonation. Almost trio the point where I'm wondering if it's fresh. They've served 3 glasses of it while I'm reviewing it, so it must be right? Either way the flavor, the noise and the mouthfeel make it an overall drinkable beer."
"D -- Very drinkable, a little on the light end for the style but good nonetheless."
"D: A robust, very tasty Irish red from Great Lakes. Fairly heavy hitting for the style, but it manages to avoid being too sweet or too alcoholic at any point. No surprises here from Great Lakes - a polished, delicious spring seasonal."
"Drinkability: Probably the best Irish Red I have, although this is admittedly one of my least favorite styles. It really does remind of their Christmas Ale in many ways, but not quite at the same level of enjoyment for me."
"Very drinkable and sessionable."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker no problem having more than one at a sitting."
"d - A nice red ale. Some nice bready and toasted malts, and a nice creamy body. Would have again."
"Pours a dark caramel like appearance. Has a small head that stays thin enough to drink through but there the whole way through. It has a bread like smell. It tastes like bread almost at first and then has a calm flavor afterwards with a bread like after taste. It is a good beer that goes down smooth would be good with a traditional Irish dinner. Will get this again."
"Not my favourite GLBC brew, but it's up there!"
"Good one here. Sad it took me this long to review this one. I like this beer a lot. Will be buying more of it."
"D- it above average tasting ,crisp and malty red that went down pretty quick..not one i would go out of my way for but would drink again"
"This beer's a great change of pace w/ all of the IPAs and stouts out (which I love). Very enjoyable beer. This really is a ""meat and potatoes"" kind of beer. Recommended."
"Drinkability: it's at this point in the day where I love to kick back, sip a beer and think. This beer is great for that. It's not boisterous or bombastic--it has a particular laid back quality where you just want to casually sip it with a good meal."
"No flavors possessing over-the-top strength here like many more popular beers, but a great beer in its own right and definitely worth a try. I've heard this one described as ""watered down Christmas Ale"" and nothing could be further from the truth; if you've heard (and maybe even acted on) such statements leading you away from this beer in the past, go ahead and give it a chance."
"D- The sweetness detracts a little, but this beer is still very drinkable and would go well with a lot of foods--its flavor and body seem designed for warm, hearty dinners."
"M/D - Nice and smooth easy-to-drink beer, I'll be buying this in a 12 pack if I see it again."
"While not sessionable compared to the more mainstream ""Irish"" beers, it's good to know that if you are looking for that craft beer around March 17th that has a bit more depth, this one will fill that void."
"Taste, sturdier than your average red ale. Traditional in that it doesn't have any overpowering aspect of it, falls to the side of malt heavy, tea, toast. Nothing offensive, just an easy drinking red ale, with a little bit more substance than your average one you might come across."
"I've had many bottles of this as well, but Conway's is excellent as a draft. Pours a really nice clear copper color, nice small-foam tannish head. Smell is nice and airy, a bit on the bready side. Taste is malty, chewy, with an awesome sweetness that permeates. No tankard-taste. A sweet malt that blends perfectly with the mild hoppiness. Little hops to speak of, but the finish is smooth and drinkability is good. Imbibe with dinner... a ""meat and potatoes"" beer, indeed."
"With a medium-heavy mouthfeel I found this beer to be slightly chewy with all the malt and a pleasure to drink. Puts other American Irish Ales to shame. If you enjoy a good hearty malted beer then please give this one a shot."
"Overall a decent representation of the style. Nothing all that memorable but drinkable."
"D: I could drink more than one of these in one sitting, but I really don't prefer red ales over other types. I would define this as a good session beer maybe some people wouldn't."
"D- This beer is a interesting drinker for me. I have no problem finishing it but at the same time I am reluctent for another one due to the sweetness of it."
"D- overall not a bad beer. It could have had some hop flavor but it was good. this would be good with a steak dinner."
"D-Really easy drinking and another solid beer from Great Lakes."
"Overall, this ranks up there with my favorite Irish Red's, if only it were available year'round."
"D: This actually went well with my hot wings. It's got a little bit of bitter/sour aftertaste that would prevent me from having more than one, but it's more than I expected for a place that doesn't normally serve craft beers."
"The taste fits the style perfectly, a nince malty beer with a mild but present hop character. Glad to have it on tap despite the way it was presented."
"Overall, Great Lakes is starting to turn my opinion of them around with a few of my last choices from them. The previous Irish Ale I had before Conway's was Dundee Red, which was extremely drinkable tasty, but a bit more generic. To find a beer directly in the middle of this and Dundee would be optimal. Very good job GL!"
"D: Altogether a good beer. Tasty, enjoyable, and I could sit down for a night of these. But that being said, it is a little forgettable, and is not the strongest in their line-up."
"Overall, an unoffensive but not particularly noteworthy beer I thought. Easy enough to put away but much more boring than I've found other Great Lakes beers thus far."
"D- A decent brew that unfortunately isn't one of my favorite styles."
"Drinkability: I could easily have more than one of these - perfect for a quench of thirst, with a meal, or just enjoying."
"Ruby amber with a dense, creamy khaki head that leaves sheets of beautiful lace on the glass. Lighty toasted grain, earthy hops and caramel in the nose. Sweet toffee and bready maltiness with citrusy and herbal hop notes. A little sweeter and a little hoppier than most of the style. Medium light bodied with a sticky mouthfeel. A fine ale."
"D - Easy drinkable beer, gets better as it warms up. Another good beer from the folks at Great Lakes Brewing Co."
"D: Very enjoyable and drinkable. The bitter bite at the end really rounds off this beer. I will probably be enjoying the rest of these tomorrow for St. Patty's Day!"
"D - Quaffable and refreshing. I might need another six pack for St Patrick's Day. Another solid beer from the folks at Great Lakes."
"Good job, Great Lakes."
"D-this is a very easy drinking beer, Great Lakes does a very good job with everything they make. Very well balanced and big flavors make this something that goes down smooth and makes you want another sip."
"Very drinkable brew, my personal favorite (of what I've tried) from Great Lakes so far."
"D - not a style I am particularly fond of, but this does a decent job at representing an Irish Red. could go a few of the flavor profiles, as this drinks to me a lot like a light Christmas beer."
"A very good beer for an Irish Red."
"overall: let it warm and enjoy. overall really liked it!"
"Smell is toasted malt, faint hops and sweetness.Not a whole lot going on with the smell but it is pleasant and not overpowering. Taste is toffee, bready, and light hops on the back end. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full and malty with good carbonation, which is right where it needs to be without being a distraction. Very drinkable beer, I would enjoy it frequently if I had access. This seems like a good beer to introduce people into craft."
"A very healthy medium body on this and very sweet, perhaps a bit too much. Kinda reminds me of sucking on a worthers original for a second. This was a easy one to take down, perhaps that's the Irish in me. It's simple, no more no less. I can see this going downhill in the bottle fairly quickly so drink up."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very drinkable nicely flavored brew that goes down pretty easy. One of the better Irish Ale's that I have had for sure."
"I cant believe this is my first time trying this beer. The cop on the label must have scared me."
"My notes say ""great beef for sprung sessions"". I think I meant ""beer"" and ""spring"" but at any rate, that's what I fat fingered into my iPhone."
"It has a smooth mouthfeel. It is very drinkable. Overall I like it."
"Drinkability: Quite enjoyed this one. Yet another solid brew from Great Lakes."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is solid beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"O - This is probably my second favorite GL beer behind Edmund Fitzgerald. I really enjoy this beer."
"Overall, a very good beer. I can have several of these in a night as they taste quite good, and they won't leave me unable to function."
"Not my favorite in the style (Brian Boru), but a very respectable Irish red."
"an enjoyable beer that is fun to drink slow. Not an easy chugger; great dinner beer with chicken"
"Another fine seasonal effort from Great Lakes. Slainte!"
"Another great brew from Great Lakes, something I've come to expect over time."
"D: Nice complex malt flavor, a little too sweet. The lingering finish brings the drinkability down some for me. Pretty good malt aroma and flavor, I just feel like it needs to dry out a little more."
"Medium body, smooth, and just a small gentle carbonation."
"M/D - Medium body with big carbonation, both in volumes and on the palate. Semi-dry finish and has a certain stickiness on the plate. Very drinkable and clean with the low alcohol lets you drink a bunch of these at one time."
"D- could work on a 6 no prob."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Other than the bitterness, there's nothing that's likely to turn anyone off about it. Very light for an ale, a good choice for a full stomach if you're looking for something with a little bite but don't have a taste for sweet. This would go great with roasted peppers, cabbage, broccoli, endive salad... stuff like that."
"Thoughts- I love the history behind this brew, nice to see respect given to ones elders. As for the brew it was a good try at the style, and it made an excellent baked chicken, so I would have it again for sure."
"This is a very drinkable, if not very complex ale. It is surprising to see the 6.5 ABV on the label as this drinks like a classic low alcohol english bitter."
"This is probably the least favorite beer of mine in the Great Lakes line up."
"D: This is a smooth drinking and comfortable beer...enjoy one after work or anytime, perhaps a bit sweet for more than a couple but your mileage may vary"
"While never being a great fan of the style, I've always loved Great Lakes, and would probably rank them as the prime contender for my favourite brewery. They've done another good job here, though even their efforts won't win me over. Its just a little simple and plain. A pleasant beer for sure, but my complaint with the whole style has always been that its lacks the complexity to ever be anything greater than pleasant."
"D: It's not very tasty or intense, it's almost too mild to care about - it certainly won't wear you out but it's not offensive. I'd want something more flavorful to session, but if you dig extremely mild european ales you might want this. I'm not very impressed with this, really, it's a rare miss by my hometown brewery."
"This beer has set the benchmark for Irish Ales. I will make a point this year to try more of the style, and see if there is a better one out there. Until then, this one is gonna be a hard one to topple. Well worth seeking out."
"D - A ""meat and potatoes"" kind of beer indeed. Would be great with a nice, down to earth homecooked meal. Almost sessionable at 6.5%."
"Notes: I love Great Lakes and this is one of my favorites. I also converted my mother and step father to craft beer with this Irish Ale! How cool is that!!!"
"This is an amazing example of the style and a great beer all around. Nicely done."
"D: A really nice, solid ale. Man, it's nice to drink something clean and simple in these days of big and complex. It's just a good beer. Nothing more, nothing less. Another nice brew to enjoy from Great Lakes. They really know how to make beer."
"In any case, this is a great Irish Red and one of the best I've had. Catholics and Prots alike can get behind something like this. Bottom line: Recommended, especially with Irish Stew or Haggis. Dangit! There I go again....!"
"D: Once you have one, you want another. ABV a little higher than your typical brew, but you really wouldn't notice by the taste."
"Pours a clear light coppery orange, dark amber, thin white head forms, wispy, quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass, not much there, no real lacing, doesn't look too exciting. Smell is nice and malty, caramel, some really toasty and grainy malt, oats/cereal, light floral, very malty. Taste is similar, very sweet, oranges, some grainy malt, biscuit, cereal, light fruitiness in the finish, low bitterness, not too exciting. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Alright beer, easy to drink but a little boring and light."
"Drinks very easy, not the best Irish Red I've had, & has some aesthetic issues, but session worthy!"
"D: Solid brew to be sure. I have yet to taste a poor offering from Great Lakes, and this is no exception. I think they hit the nail on the head by calling this a ""meat and potatoes'"" kind of beer on the label. It's a no frills, solid, good tasting beer. Recommend."
"It was a great beer. Excellent for a session."
"Not the best Irish red I've had, but far from the worst. Hits all the right notes without challenging the taste buds, but without surprising them either. One of those brews (and styles) you wouldn't be ashamed to stick with when you're sick of throwing down big beers. My biggest complaint is that there could be a bit more punch in the flavor given the abv, or could lower the abv the bit while keeping the current profile."
"Drinkability: As mentioned in the taste portion above, I found this beer to be very drinkable and easy going. Not challenging at all but very tasty and fulfilling. To me, this one comes across as a little more unique because of bready-like quality (I know, I keep coming back to that), but I really find that to be most pleasing. I give this a higher drinkability because it is indeed easy to get down, but also the ABV is pretty do-able."
"The Conway's Irish Ale has a good aroma and flavor profile to it with out commanding your attention. I really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone."
"Beer pours a reddish/brown hue with a short lasting head. I picked up lots of malts and toffee/carmel in the aroma. The finish improves as the beer warms as the carbonation is a little to prickly at first. Not a bad beer but nothing extraordinary."
"Pours clear reddish orange with a little head dissapating into a light lace. smells of faint honey with a mild hop note. Taste is slight hoppiness with a honey like aftertaste and a bit of sweet grass. drinkability is good but not what I was expecting."
"Not of of Great lakes best."
"This brew has a very earthy character which lends itself nicely to the Irish style."
"Drinkability- High. This is one of my favorite session beers for this time of year."
"D- more punch than the standard Irish Red but still easy to drink"
"D: Actually pretty good, considering the 6.5% ABV."
"Here is one of those cases where the beer from the tap is Sooo much better than out of the bottle. I will review the tap version and give Great Lakes the benefit of the doubt. I had one several years ago from the bottle and was not impressed; even disappointed since I have been a huge GLB fan since the late 90's. Have made several trips to the brewery Mecca over the years. My last trip, my buddy advised that I try it as a draft. I did and it was like a different brew. It came to life with punch and aroma. It delivered on a brilliant Irish Red which can be drank endlessly when done right. Bartender, pour me another! This one's on Eliot Ness...."
"D - it would be easy to drink a few of these."
"Sometimes Red's can get boring but this is very full flavored while maintaining the approachability that reds are known for."
"I really enjoy most Irish ales, but was a little disappointed in this one. I had just sampled Michelob Irish Red, and felt that this one tasted a little watered down. The smell and appearance were great, but was thinner than I expected when drinking. Great Lakes has so many great products, it was a shame that this one fell a little short."
"I love Great Lakes beers, and this was no exception. Maybe it's the yeast strain they use, but many of their beers share taste characteristics - I've tasted many of the same notes in their Oktoberfest and Christmas ales."
"Goes down easy and will rate high drinkability wise."
"This is a hearty ale, very different from a lot of Irish reds I've had, but good in it's own right."
"Pours a nice mid-copper color with good initial head, although it rapidly fades and there is no lacing; a fair bit of carbonation, as well. Nice scent, deep almost like a brown ale, with just a hint of sour to it. Good taste, a bit of Irish red sour, but with noticable hop tones and a deeper, thick malt flavor. Goes down quite well, if a tad over carbonated. Nice Irish-style red ale."
"Drinkability: This one was very odd, very heavy on the fruits, moderate on most everything else. It wasn't unpleasant, but I can't say it was stylistically too accurate! The 6.5% is also pretty up there for the style. I'd have it at a party, but I dunno if I'd seek it out in the future."
"I think I should go out tomorrow and try to find some more before they are gone."
"I could drink a few of these but they are so filling I'm not sure I could session them..."
"drinkability is very high a good beer to session with"
"~Jonathan Passow"
"D: A good offering, worth a try."
"Taste is less crisp of crystal malt than you'd expect. A little more like a mild with rounded edges and slight raisny notes. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy for an Irish red with peppery carbonation. A little slick and oily for me in terms of overall mouthfeel and taste."
"Oh well, I'll just keep drinking the rest of their excellent collection."
"Drinkability is awesome on this irish red. This beer is a nicely balanced selection that has some really great tastes to it, but nothing so strong that you can get sick of it. One of the better Irish reds I have ever had, but a nice session beer to drink all day...the way the Irish intended."
"Future outlook: This beer just didn't quite come together for me. A rare miss for Great Lakes, though still not something that I would say was ""bad"" or push away if offered. I won't seek this out again, but could accept it as part of a variety mix-pack."
"Great Lakes Conway's Irish Red Ale is a clear amber ale with a fading white head. It has a slightly sweet aroma that's a little resiny. It is medium bodied, smooth, bubbly, and the finish is clean. It is simple and balanced, with notes of resin, smoke and peat. It has a good bitterness and a touch of sweetness. Not bad."
"On the plus side, this is a drinkable brew. A few of these to sip on with definitely clear your mind and make you relaxed in no time. Definitely worth a purchase!"
"Give it a try. Easy going, good taste, smooth and delicious."
"Notes: Not Great Lakes best offering and maybe one of their weakest."
"This is my favorite beer from GLBC. It is a seasonal beer but I wish it wasn't. I reviewed it from draft but it is just as good out of the bottle. The only complaint I had was that it was served too cold. The twelve pack box is a wonderful buy. Do not hesitate to pick some up!"
"Goes down smooth and easy. Great Lakes never lets me down."
"Cheers!!!"
"poured from a bottle. pours deep copper with light head. smell is very malty. the taste is huge malts with little hop presence really. I kind of get a wet hop flavor? which I found odd. the mouthfeel is pretty perfect, nice light carbonation. this is pretty decent but after maybe a few i would be looking for something new."
"D: Another great brew from GLBC. This is an excellent example the the Irish Red style."
"Soft carbonation makes me contemplate the flavor of this beer. Not as quite straightforward as the aroma but close. There is a slightly sweet hop fruitiness in this beer that is easily balanced with remarkably fresh cereal grains. I could go on about this beer but then I wouldn't be drinking it any longer. It has pretty much everything I like in a beer, hops that are not overly done, malts that are not overly sweet, a nice dryness that makes me yearn for another sip and a mouthfeel that reminds me more of a cask ale than a bottle of soda. Go out and get this stuff while it's fresh."
"D- Ive had this beer twice and have to say that the first time it made a stronger impression than it did this time. However with that said it really comes off as more a of a lighter ale than an Irish red. Its refreshing and the flavors are nice but could stand to be slightly more pronounced."
"Just as good as I remembered. I'd love to try it on tap."
"Not much to this one. A very light Irish ale. Very average too below average. I don't think this batch was up to snuff."
"Great Lakes never disappoints, and this is no exception. A great example of the style!"
"Seasonal Irish Amber from Great Lakes, named after their grandfather an honor for sure. Faintly sweet malty aroma not much else aside from a very low key hop nose. Twinkling amber pour sizable head that soon becomes a thin film leaving mild lacing. Crisp with an easy finish this has a real good medium bodied fullness to it. Flavor is more intense than the aroma, lots of sweet malts caramel and a touch of honey. Low key hop presence nice change from this brewer. Overall one of Great Lakes' more simple beers but it's a nice choice for it's respective style."
"Very enjoyable taste: peppery hops with a hint of citrus, perfectly balanced by amber malts and breaded notes. A kiss of alcohol and hops leaves a complex and intriguing finish. Body is perfectly carbonated with a medium thickness--everything an Irish Red should feel like. All in all, Great Lakes delivers once again...a stand-out beer."
"Drinkibability: Another solid offering from Great Lakes. Easy drinking yet flavorful."
" This offering form Great Lakes pours amber-red with a tall white head. There was a sent of toasted malts and seeds. The malt profile is of slight carmel, roasted nuts and toffie. There is not too much for the hops because the malt is so dominent. There is a nice malty body with a reasonable amount of carbonation. The aftertaste has too much bitter coffie flavors."
"D : Not bad. It's a fairly simple beer that is easy to drink but I'm not sure how often I would pick it up in the future."
"D- A great brew and excellent example for the style. Very drinkable."
"Pours with a orangish coppery hue that leaves a slight head. First smell is sweet flowery hops and very slight malt coming through. Malt hits first with a kind of a toasted creamy hop, afterwards. Its not a sick creamy though, just the texture. This one has a medium mouthfeel and an overall good drinkability. I'm usually not an over the top hops guy but this is a good balance. Definately recommend."
"D_A nice combonation of malts and a very drinkable ale overall. Another winner from Great Lakes. Thanks to pimppfor the chance to try this."
"D - Drinkability is good for this one. I could very easily drink many of these with no problem."
"Sweet, light, caramel malt flavor. Very creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is a touch bland for 6.5% abv. I do get a touch of vegetable DMS, but I'm not sure if that's completely inappropriate for the style. There's a light bitter aftertaste in the end, but in general it's pretty tasty. I'd like it to be lower in abv, because this beer could sneak up on me fast."
"Drinkability - a fine session beer, looks like it'll be St. Patties Day all week!"
"I see a bright yet deep ambery/copper. Very little head, but a cool column of tiny bubbles spewing from the bottom center of the glass. Very uniform. The aroma is a pretty inviting baked then quickly toasted, old fashioned white bread. It just smells warm and comforting. The first sip is great toasted malts, bread with a smooth light caramel finish. The palate is very upfront, nt a lot of stuff lurking in the shadows. No real nuances. Just great malt and a hint of caramel. Very easy to drink beer."
"I know the boarderline of session beers is 5.0 and this one is at 6.5%, but I would call it sessionable. No matter what the ABV is you are gonna feel the effects after 5 or 6. This is a good choice if you are feeling a little Irish, and don't want or are afraid of the dark."
"Not my favorite from GLBC, but that is mostly because of the style. This beer is classicly good."
"This ale pours a brilliantly clear light copper color with a thin white head. A moderate-high malty aroma rises from the beer, toasty grains and some breadiness. The flavor is highly malty, toasty and bready--like the aroma. The hop bitterness is moderate with a bit of hop flavor at the swallow. The body is medium and moderate carbonation delivers an appropriate prick at the swallow. Overall a tasty brew, nice malt profile without being too sweet, slightly dry, toasty finish is pleasant."
"Poured into pint glass. Reddish amber with minimal head - less than half inch on the pour with but tight. Smells roasty and tastes similar with fresh tea like flavor (pekoe) hitting the back of your taste buds. This is nicely carbed and and very drinkable."
"This beer poured a beautiful reddish-orange hue. However, there was hardly any head even when poured harshly. Its nose definitely had a caramel, malt presence with a little smokiness in back. Its taste was mild in my opinion, caramel with moderate malt, and a little smokiness in the back just as in its smell. I didn't particularly like its mouthfeel. Its carbonation vanished as I got to the bottom of my glass, giving it a flat feel. More carbonation would have made it much more drinkable. Not a bad beer, but I've had better from Great Lakes."
"Pours a rich, clear, honey-amber with a finger of smooth tan head. Smooth malt dominates the aroma, with a tiny bit of citrus and some woodiness and caramel. A well-rounded mild hop scent draws it all together. For the first second the heavier side of the malt is present, but it is immediately followed by the hops and lightens up to a caramel, bread flavor. The citrus is present but fleeting, which is fine because I think too much would have ruined the brew. Overall very smooth and easy to drink. Perfect for an easy social drink or to have with a burger."
"D - Good beer. Nothing special but it's a good change of pace."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This beer is incredibly easy to drink. So much so that it reminds me a bit of a Lager. Fortunately there is enough Ale-like qualities to set it apart."
"For a red it was good. For holding up production of my favorite beer in the world, blackout stout, well... I hate IT! I'd say it was about what I suspected having thried their other offering. It was a good beer, but not one to seek out. I'd settle for four months of Blackout and none of this."
"On tap at Beef O'Brady's in Centerville, OH. Nice golden amber to red color with a small white head which was quickly gone. Nice malty smell. Malty, caramel taste with some biscuit flavor and a small hoppy bitter bite at the end. One of the many nice beers by Great Lakes. This is a very easy to drink beer."
"A pretty straight forward beer. Pretty drinkable. Would make a decent session beer."
"Poured a light reddish color with a creamy style off white head that lingered for a bit and then slowly died down. Plenty of sweet toffee malt is initially picked up. Slightly floral hops, but there is another smell somewhat like tea leaves? Taste is the toffee sweetness with not much hops at all to follow mostly a bready malt here. Mouth feel is slightly creamy but a little more watered down."
"Crisp finish, much like a lager. Very smooth & drinkable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Pretty well carbonated. Quite smooth and drinkable. It's a solid beer."
"D: Not quite as good as some of their other offerings but yet another solid brew from GLBC."
"D- no problem knockin em back tonight, too bad it's only a seasonal release."
""
"A solid brew , probably my favorite Irish Red to date."
"This is a great brew. I didn't really know what to expect, but I guess that's okay. It's got a light roastiness and sweetness throughout that is backed up with a bit of hops. I am pleased to know that everything coming from GLBC has a consistently high level of quality."
"Drinkability is also good. Could have a couple of these but would maybe get bored after two or three. Better than what I see offered at a lot of my local pubs."
"The beer pours a nice copper color with a creamy half finger of head. The aroma is quite sweet and malty. The flavor has a good bit of caramalized malt and grassy hops. It has a heavy mouthfeel and prickly carbonation. This is quite different than I was expecting in a good way. I would deffinately get a sixer of this to share with friends."
"Not a bad brew. Not what I was expecting. No nutty or carmel character. Somewhat of a malt and refreshing hop character to it though. I liked this brew overall but not the best Irish red I have ever had. I do reccomend it as ""worth a try"". Its not bad overall."
"Eric"
"Pours a clear reddish amber with little head and no retention. Aroma is sweet malts with no hop character. Taste is very like iced tea with some roastiness and strawberry present. A fine beer but nothing remarkable -- I wouldn't be interested in having it again, especially when it sits next to Commodore Perry!"
"All rounded out to a smooth, pleasant finish. Not a great beer, but it turned out to be a pretty good session beer, as I had several."
"As is the case with nearly all Great Lakes Creations, I never get tired on this beer (its even better on tap at the brewery) and I impatiently wait for its release each year."
"Full bodied with low carbonation brings the drinkability down a little but this is still a very nice satisfying take on the style."
"The rich, lightly sweet, caramelish, toasty and berry-ish flavors of Conway's Irish Ale are sure to please. It's deep-amber/copper body glows with orange and gold highlights, and the creamy off-white head holds just fine, leaving behind spotty walls of lace. The nose is clean with a malty and fruity edge. It's medium bodied and gently crisp on the tongue. In many ways it's just your basic Irish red ale, but it does have a distinct malty character that's caramelish, toasty, and offers the suggestion of some roastiness in the background. Blanced towards sweetness, the bitterness is just enough to give it ballast and keep it from becoming sweet. Nicely done!"
"Light to medium body has a light mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy.A nice pleasing taste thats easy drinking. This is my choice for St. Patty day next year could drink this all night."
"Chilled and poured into nonic the head rose and immediately fell, its a sparse film lingering on the surface. The body is a hearty golden amber sort of a light shade of southern style sweet tea. Smells of light hoppiness, I might even say ""tea like", with some subtle, but heartier malt character. Taste is the nose multiplied, with more complexity and subtlety. The malt really shows its colors toward the finish with a meager flourish of caramel and lightly toasted malt. Bitterness is very subdued, just present enough to provide good balance for the subtle malt. Mouthfeel feel is maybe a tinge thin, maybe not, but it does provide for good drink ability. This is definitely a beer that could be sessioned especially on a summer day, but because of its slight heartiness it could be decent during winter. I enjoyed this not crazy about it, but a good representation of the style and a worth while"
"D: Well I liked this beer. Very tasty and enjoyable after a brutal day at work. Good balance. Would have got higher marks if the dirty taste didnt exist and a silkier mouthfeel was present."
"This brew pours out a clear, reddish brown with a little off-white head. Some lingers throughout. My initial impression of the aroma is that's it's mostly malt - caramel, and a little hops. Nothing really particular in the nose. The taste is also creamy and sweet, but really well-balanced at the end. I notice a grassy, sort of mossy flavor, too, slightly minty in the aftertaste. So far this one is hitting all the right notes for me. It's very pleasant in the mouth, too, perfectly carbonated and just the right consistency. On top of that, it's just sliding down, too, so I'm really happy with this one."
"Toffee caramel malt with a floral, chewy, pine induced hop finish. Again berry with a faint nut addition. Not overly complex but nicely palatable. Malt flavor is slightly too sweet. More hop could have made this beer more balanced across the spectrum."
"Drinkability - this is decent, but not great. However, it could be a good session beer."
"Overall, not a very enjoyable beer for me. I usually like red ales, so I think it's this particular one that has this overpoweringly earthy dirt flavor."
"Drinkability-A nice Irish styled session beer. I have tried a lot of GL's brews and have yet to find one that I can speak bad about!!!"
"I wasn't floored by the brew but enjoyed it enough to get a six pack of it every year when its out there. As a Cincinnati native, GLBC is my favorite thing about Cleveland :-D"
"this beer goes down easy and packs just enough of a punch to make it a great session beer. if only it were available more than just early spring."
"This beer poured a bright red, sparkling color with good head formation. Aroma was lightly malty with good caramel smells coming off of it. Taste was OK, but a bit ho-hum. Mouthfeel was typical. I would call this beer drinkable, but in a world with so many choices, I have a hard time strongly recommending it."
"An extremely easy to drink ale, although no characteristics really stand out."
"Outstanding offering by one of the greats! Pours a ruby red color with few laces. But smells decently and is great with cabbage and corned beef. Goes down smoothly, and can be the life of the party, of course if you can get them to listen. With original smoothness, has a little bitey edge at the end."
"This brewery has yet to let me down. It is so nice to be able to get these seasonals on tap nearby."
"actually, this beer makes me want to write an essay on the unfortunate topic of inordinate hop levels seeming to be the american signature on attempts to interpret non-american styles. this, too, shall pass....(hopefully)"
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle good by April 24, 2007. Pours a clear copper color, with little to no head. Smells of mellow malt, A little bit toasty. Not too strong. The taste is front-loaded with the clean, crisp malt. Continues into the middle. Nice, refreshing taste. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy, although not too watery. A very smooth and clean beer. Another great offering from GLBC."
"Bottle says best before 4/12/07. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber/red color with a small white head. It smells spicy and malty, and also like caramel and some floral hops. However, the aroma is a bit weak. It tastes like caramel, sweet malt and bread with a nice slight bitter hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is medium, with just the right amount of carbonation and a bit of dryness. The drinkability is very good, this is a nice smooth beer that would be a great choice as a session beer. Too bad this is only a seasonal beer, I'd like it to be available year-round."
"Clear dark amber and a slightly off white fluffy head that reduces to thin lace ring. Mild nose with notes of toasted malt, grassy hops, floral, and a faint sour yeastiness. Toasted grains and barley cereals followed quickly by a strong chocolate malt character. Slight spicy, floral hop characters keep it dry and tones down some of the sweetness. The overall smooth, nutty malt character is very tasty. The finish is dry, bready, and yeasty with some cocoa powder notes remaining the longest. Medium mouthfeel, some carbonated fizz, and little cloying make for some appealing attributes. Very tasty beer but might be a little too chocolaty for an irish red...or maybe not, focusing on a flavor and making it speak loudly isnt necessarily a deviation but more an individual take on it...it was good."
"Mouthfeel was zippy yet it glass-like smoothness. No one element of this beer was spectacular but every characteristic was enjoyable."
"Smoked spice and malt aromas are most predominant to me. A slightly smoked flavor with a tang from the hop that adds to an interesting mouth feel. Nice take on the style. Thanks to DE for the opportunity."
"Drinkability: This is not a style I would normally seek out but the Great Lakes version is a keeper"
"This beer pours a nice amberish color, not quite red. A good hard pour produces a nice off white head and there is a good amount of lacing throughout. Smells sweet, some caramel and maple syrup. Taste is very smooth and malty, again with caramel and a slight hint of hops. Very good for this style. A nice session beer."
"It pours a deep copper/red with a nice frothy head that dissipates quickly. Minimal head and lace to the bottom of the glass.Not a lot of aroma, just a mild sweet smell. The taste up front is sweet, carmel, with a touch of spiciness. Nice carbination, very refreshing with a dry pleasant after taste. Great balance and probabaly one of the better Irish ales out there. This ale is remarkably drinkable!"
"D- It is a very nice and drinkable. Very well balanced and the best Irish red ale I have tried. I think they hit the nail on the head with this one."
"This beer is a nice dark amber with an off-white head. There was only a 1/8"" or so of head, and it was gone quickly. It has a sweet malty aroma. It looks and smells alot like the Christmas Ale, but without the Christmas spices. The taste is very good. I'm not usually a fan of the style, but this is nice. It is sweet at first but dries out nicely. There is just a faint bitter aftertaste that makes you want the next sip. The mouthfeel is also very good. Very smooth and substantial. Drinkability is great, I might have to reserve a keg for St. Pat's Day."
"D - Very Drinkable. I can enjoy this as a session beer."
"D - A very tasty beer. This will become a regular spring drinker for me."
"I think Edmond Fitzgerald is a better Great Lakes brew but this one needs more attention from me. I am happy to grant this."
"D - Great drinkability, would make for a nice session."
"I have had limited experience with GLB Co., but they have all been very good. Conway's Irish Ale is a great beer to have any time of year and seems like it should go great with any meal. While not perfect, this is a great session beer to be enjoyed at any time!"
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Nice smooth mouth with a medium feel. Easy session type beer. Well done Great Lakes!"
"A real classic middle of the road ""ale."" There are no gimmicks, no fancy tricks. Just straight up ale that you can swill or enjoy patiently. Definitely a great beer to get out at the pub or to share with friends, but not necessarily worth the novelty of a once-a-year release. An excellent representative of the style, if only a bit plain. I must say this beer reminds quite a bit of Ireland-- astringent, bland, but thoroughly enjoyable."
"A crystal clear deep golden-amber ale with a little less than an inch of off-white head, and a lasting spotty and smooth film. An almost cidery-vinous note greets me at the top of my tulip-pint, but it's not a very welcome greeting... The cidery-vinous note is present again at first contact with the tongue, but balanced in with some tangy-sweet malt that leads into a delicately nutty and biscuity malt. Hops are present, but just enough to tie off the flavor. Fortunately the cider/wine fades as I'm drinking the beer, and the nutty malt picks up just slightly. Body is light, but not watery thin. Besides some unwelcome flavors, this beer is a very easy drinking pale ale."
"Overall this is a good brew. I find it to be interesting with its array of flavors in harmony with each other. Balanced but complex."
"Overall a good easy drinking beer, another solid offering from Great Lakes."
"Pours a medium amber color, with a half inch off white head. Crystal clear, with lots of carbonation. Spotty lacing left along the sides of the glass. Not a terribly strong smelling brew. Reminds me of tea, wheat and malts. Decent taste, mostly malts and very sweet. Good mouthfeel, very smooth, and slightly dry. Very easy too drink and a good example of the style. A good offering from Great Lakes."
"A tasty brew. Mild sweetness with a balancing light hop bitterness. Easy drinking and flavorful."
"Thin to medium body, a bit oily on the tongue, but relatively drinkable, although it would seem that this were designed to be consumed cold."
"Very drinkable at 45°F and even 55°F I am sure Grandfather Patrick Conway would have loved to have a couple of pints after his day on the beat dirrecting Cleveland's traffic. Do a detect a belly suggesting love of beer in his photo on the label?"
"I definately plan on having a few of these on St. Patty's."
"When it came to me, it was a dark reddish color with just hint of brown in there as well. It had this really nice 2 finger head of white creamy foam. It had good retention leaving behind it plenty of white sticky lace. Really nice appearance! The aroma was that of piny hops up front and some toasted malt in the background. Not too much going on in the aroma, but it was still very good. I found the taste to be sweet with piny hops up front and plenty of toasted malts in the background. After the malts, the hops showed up again at the end. The mouthfeel was carbonated with just a slight dry aftertaste. While there was not much stuff going on in this beer, I still found this beer quite enjoyable and highly drinkable on-tap. A must try if you can find this on-tap."
"Overall--just another no frills beer from a top notch brewer. I wont be rushing out for another of these anytime soon, but I will recommend it to my friends who are looking for a ""cross-over"" beer. Good beer."
"D- This is a nice smooth beer that has some good malt flavors and a spicy hop flavor but it would be nice to see the malt have a bit more depth and the hops back off a bit. Definitely a good crossover beer for those that drink Adjunct Lagers."
"So, what can I say, this is great stuff. Another homer from the hometown brewery."
"overall, i really enjoyed this beer, an all around well balanced winner, my favorite Irish Red to date. I'm not sure this brewery can do any wrong, hands down the best all around brewery in America."
"D: I could probably drink a sixer of this without noticing - very smooth and easy to drink. This is what Killian's should be."
"Enormous initial head, looks roasty, light colour. Very fresh draft-like taste. A bit of roast and alcohol in aroma, fairly neutral. Mild, creamyish mouthfeel, light body close to watery. Easy drink, bitter with mild roastiness. Drying finish. Nothing too interesting, unless you are very much a true Irish style fan. had on tap a year later and noticed malt and creaminess more than anything else."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice drinking beer. I am glad I have a six pack more to drink."
"Final Thought: This is one of the better beers out there and ranks in the upper-end for most GLBC products, impressive!"
"The mouthfeel of this beer is pretty good as well. I believe that the medium body of this beer is appropriate to the style. It feels a bit heavier and thicker than water on the palate and has a dry finish. It is very easy to drink, and is much better warmer as opposed to colder. Not quite a session beer, but I could just chill with some buddies and drink this one all night long. This is a beer that I'll probably buy next winter when it hits the shelves again."
"This really is a treat and I will be pick up more of these. At least the price of this six pack was comparable to their others. (Unlike the Christmas Ale which was 3.00 more in my area.)"
"Pours a crystal clear bronze color. One finger head quickly falls to a thin but dense cap. Mild spotty lacing. Toasted amber malt nose with background spicy hops. Sweet caramel and dextrin taste, followed by a very evenly balanced german hop bitterness. Medium body and carbonation, very smooth and almost creamy. Finishes a touch sweet, with the hops more apparent; but mostly clean. easy to knock back a few of these. Once again, GLBC nails the style AND produces an outstanding beer."
"This was a smooth and full-bodied ale, and I was a fan. Not the best Irish Ale I've had but pleasant and very drinkable. hats off the Great lakes again."
"Deep coppery red color, major chill haze goin on, thin ring of lace hugs the edges. Biscuity wheat malt and estery sweetness in the nose. Tingly carbonation initially, then fades out to nearly none, being utterly smooth and palatable. Buttery toffee malts linger throughout, with a touch of butterscotch and hop bitterness in the finish. So quaffable. Great Lakes is quickly becoming a stellar brewery in my personal world of beer; bring your brews to PA!"
"Looks well, red...and golden, copper, with a light beige head that lingered. Smells malty and caramelly sweet. Toffee and strong tea notes are present. Slightly tart from the yeast. Tastes malty sweet with very little notes of hop flavor and bitter only for balance. Cloying mouthfeel. Has a medium, creamy body. Finishes sweet and malty; lingers into next sip. A better than average red, but it's not my style."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite Irish Red Ale, I prefer this one to Smithwick's. This would be an excellent session ale."
"Nice mouthfeel, but its more than a touch too sweet for this taster. I can't imagine drinking too many of these without it getting cloying. A disappoinment given the very high standard set by this brewery's other offerings."
"Comments  Thanks to BuckeyNation for sending this GL beauty shop out my way."
"Drinkability: I must say I was not expecting much outta this beer. The only other ""Irish red"" I can remember drinking ( which has been affectionately dubbed an ""euro dark lager"" by BA ) was served in a plastic pitcher at a bowling alley. You know the one. This one makes me think I might actually like this style after being traumatized by the other."
"Conway's Irish Ale isn't one of my favorite Great Lakes brews, but then most of the rest of them live in the stratosphere. A pretty good GL beer is extraordinarily good when judged against the offerings of all but a handful of breweries. This is, by far, my favorite Irish red to date and is a beer that I heartily recommend. Thanks Mom for a terrific belated birthday present."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable, great session ale"
"Described as a rosy copper color with a thick, two-inch beige head on initial pour. It has settled to a light covering with some sticking to the glass. Smell somehow reminds me of Irish soda bread, with some leafy hop. Tastes very toasty, and has a nice bitter finish. Not quite as hoppy as St. Rogues Red I've had at the same time but they are present. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth for a 6.5% a.b.v. red ale. Overall I found this beer enjoyable and will buy more next year."
"This one pours an amber/red color with a moderate head that falls quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is really bready and toasty with some caramel thrown in. Not really my thing, but right on for the style. The flavor follows suit with a lot of bready notes and caramel malts. Plenty of crystal malt in there. The body is fairly thick and the drinkability is pretty good, it's just not my style."
"Ths brew pours a slightly ambered orange color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is not nice. There is a big grainey biscuity aroma, wih a touch of sweetness, but not something that appeals to me. The flavor is okay. There is a big grain character, with a bit of a spicey grain quality. The feel is moderate. As far as irish reds go, this is okay. I'd still take most other styles over this."
"I would drink this again in a heartbeat, and look forward to a glass of it amid the falling leaves some October day."
"A cloudy mixture of a light sun-down orange with red highlights, decent sized tan head that has great dedication. Biscuits, malts and some sweet orange juice detected on the nose. Caramel malts, a bit dry, maintains a decent hop flavoring. As she warms, some juicy sweetness, bubble-gum offerings are found. Butterscotch, toasted bread, very rich and filling, in a good way. The backbone has a spicy bite that combines wonderfully with the wonderful texture and body that this beverage has! One darn fine Irish Red!"
"Great Lakes usually provides exemplary models for the beers they create, and the fact that this brew is merely above average is kind of a letdown. Still, its pretty good. Deep ruby amber color with a medium beige head and thin lacing. The aroma is roasted malt and caramel. Medium-bodied and on the carbonated side, with flavors of sweet malt, light hops and a bit of fruit. The finish is clean and somewhat sweet. Overall pretty good, but I just know GLBC could knock this one out of the park if they really wanted to."
"The drinkability is good, although at 6.5% you feel it a bit faster than some. Great beer and sad that it's only around for part of the year."
"Conway's is another solid brew from Great Lakes. It stands on the sweet side of the balance scale. This would be a great selection for your St. Patrick's Day celebration. I've also gotta say this might be a good transition beer for your buddies. It is an easy drinking beer. If it was a tad lower in alcohol, it would be an ideal session beer."
"Slàinte!"
"pours a caramel copper color with a nicely lacing off white head. Smells of sweet caramel malts and a hint of noble hops. Taste is very balanced. Bicuits and caramel are the most prominent malt flavors here. A nice hop bite to keep these malt flavors in check. Mouthfeel is very nice, medium and well suiting for the style. I would love to put quite a few of these down as is with any great lakes brew."
"This is a seasonal from Great Lakes. I hear they only make one batch every year. The beer pours a hazy dark orange/red color. The head is creamy and lingers for quite some time. Lots of lacing clings to the pint glass as you drink. The nose has some fruit and spice. The taste is quite mild with a mellow taste almost like tea. The malts are sweet and the hops are subdued. Although the alcohol is a little higher than some, it would make for a nice session beer. This is a keeper!"
"Excellent candidate for those questionable spring months. Easily finds its way into my belly."
"Pours a hazy glowing amber with a nice creamy off white head that leaves sheets of lace in my glass. Sweet fruity aromas, nutty, buttery, toasty and sweet fruity flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes on the sweet side. Another good one from this brewery."
"Goes down well, and was a good dinner beer. I owe my friend Praneel for bringing me a mixer of Great Lakes beers, as they don't come out this way."
"Bottle dated best before Apr 10, 05. Pours a deep amber/light copper color with a fluffy, beige head. Lots of toasty biscuity malt, subtle grassy hops with a light yeasty fruitiness. Big on the sweet biscuity malt complete with tea-like tannins, some herbal hops come through in the finish. A touch of fruitiness gives it an extra dimension of depth. Medium to fuller bodied, it is one of the better Irish red ales I've tried. Very drinkable."
"Pours a nice sunset orange/red color with an off-white froathy head. The smell is sweet, flowery, and clean. The taste is wonderfully complex. The malts are big, lending a great toasted flavor. The hops are used sparingly, just enough to balance the malt and still make their presence known. A hint of caramel and citrous fruit gives extra complexity. A noticeable spiciness is also present. This light and refreshing brew disappears quickly, I should have bought an extra 6 pack."
"Overall this beer is one of the best red ales I have tasted. Eggerton's (spelling?) red ale is also a mentionable one to try if you can get your hands on it, though it is stronger and more assertive than this one. I stand by on my rating of this beer, very high!"
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy medium red color with three big fingers of off-white head. There is quite a bit of sticky lacing left on the glass. The smell is very malty with lots of sweet aromas like caramel and burnt sugar. A nice nose. The taste is good as well. Fairly sweet lightly toasted malt sit atop a small dose of hops. Very well balanced and smooth. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability fairs very well. A smooth refreshing 6.5% brew!"
"First off, I am not a fan of Red Ales, but this is the best Red Ale I've ever had...bar none. This sets the standard for all others to follow in the category, and is everything I want in a red. Amazingly drinkable, I could put these back all night long. Reminds me to a certain extent of Fat Tire with the wonderful toast and biscuits. I absolutely love this stuff and it will become a regular addition. Amazingly balanced and rich, without ever fatiguing the taste buds. Another amazing brew from the alchemists at GLBC! Highly recommended."
"Poured to a copper red colour with an overly long lasting head which seemed to destroy any semblance of lace. A rich carmel/toffee aroma overtook the slight waft of whiskey malt (perhaps a sour mash). Had a positive effect on the palate and although a touch tart in the sweetness department; its durability showed through. A very functional Irish Ale; good to the last dram."
"Great job GLBC!"
"A red ale is sort of like a center in football - he never gets noticed as long as he does his job. The only time anyone pays attention is when he fumbles. Likewise, a good red ale seems to be a beer that happily slips into the background, solid and easygoing, and largely unnoticed unless it is bad. Consequently, this beer deserves being singled out for praise for doing quite well what it sets out to do. No screaming hops, no massive malt, just a well-balanced, easy to drink beer. Nicely nutty and smooth, with just enough hops to balance the malt. A tip on the scale toward the sweet side, but just barely. Would be a great session ale, but I fear the abv will sneak up on me."
"Drinkability. I could easily drink this all night. This brew is dangerously good."
"Decided to finally try this the day before St. Patrick's day. This beer poured as nice dark reddish gold color and formed a nice foamy white head that retained itself very nicely. It coated the glass with lace when it finally drifted away. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops and some small spice and caramel elements. A flavor of malt, caramel and some hops present. Fairly sweet notes in the flavor and finish of this beer, with some spriteness in the finish. Great Lakes can rarely go wrong with their beers."
"Pours a dark copper/amber color with a white foamy almost fluffy head. There was a decent amount of lacing in the glass. Smells somewhat like caramel with some toasted notes along with it. Taste is slightly sweet, caramel with a dryness to it. Some amount of bitterness in the finish, but not overwhelming. I found it to be medium bodied. I didn't feel that it was particularly drinkable, mainly because of the dryness, but I did find it to be good. This usually surfaces around St. Patricks Day, and is another quality brew from Great Lakes."
"Pours a clear bright copper in color with an off-white head. Aroma consists of caramel and malt with just a touch of toffee sweetness. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with some sharp carbonation upfront. Rich malt characteristics dominate the taste. Flavor is less sweeter than anticipated from the nose. Malt front is overshadowed toward the back of the tongue by a very assertive hop profile. Toasted malt flavor returns after the hops subside. Buttery finish. A solid Irish ale and another good offering from Great Lakes."
"Thank you PhantomVodoo!"
"This is a very drinkable brew, quite enjoyable with a nice mix of taste."
"Overall a pretty good brew by Great Lakes, I would have to say I don't enjoy it as much as some of their other brews, but this one is still better than most Ambers I've had."
"So if you're a dedicated malty, or just need a palate cleanser in between your 90 minute and Hop Ottin', this is the beer for you."
"Amongst the best Irish ale out there, and another fine offering from Great Lakes, and since I'm out of Cleveland pops, I won't say much other than I'll have this beer once again!"
"this is another hit from great lakes...i could be satisfied drinking this all night long."
"I've been on a quest to try as many different brews as possible and in so doing I only buy one or two bottles of each kind. Conway's Irish ale is a brew I'll be buying in sixpack formation, for sure!"
"This beer poured a scarlett red color with small, compact tan head. The nose is really bready in my opinoin and slight alcohol. But in taste, I do not recognize any alcohol. Which is quite amazing since it's a red ale at 6.5%. The flavor is malt dominate, but there's an array of various malts. Toasted biscuity sweetness along with some caramel are strongest. A slight citrus sweetness is also there. Hops stand up to the malt but dont overtake it. They're not bitter but more floral. Very dry finish. Quite good."
"Highly drinkable, although relative sweetness makes me think more than two would be too much."
"Drinkability: Another hit from GLBC. This is a very nice offering, not too overwhelming, I could see myself drinking a few of these tonight. Way to go, Great Lakes."
"This along with Casco Riptide are my favorite red alse out there,pours a deep red/amber with a real nice creamy sticky head,the aroma is nutty and malty sweet with some bread-like aromas.The taste is slightly burnt with some real nice malty sweetness,very good roasted qualities with a ever so slight hop profile.A real nice beer to sit down and savor."
"I love this beer and am giving it's drinkability high marks because of that and because it seems very balanced for as swet as it is...This is probably the best red I've had...if not in the the top 5 for sure...clean, crisp, tasty, great nose...Now if only we could replace the 100 or so taps of Killians in my town with this I'd be happy..."
"I raise my glass to fellow BA PhantomVoDoo for trading this to me during our last road trip to Ohio."
"Thank you cokes for sharing Mr. Conway."
"However, I do believe they missed a vowel in the name. Call this Conaway's Irish Ale, and I'd be inclined to give it 5 stars."
"Another good GLBC beer. This one is good looking, but a bit less intriguing than others on the taste side. Pours a copper or orangish amber with a nice tan head; it also has some nice ruby highlights. The lacing is adequate if not great. The taste is full of malt sweetness, but gets some dryness from adequate hops. A good beer that has to run in stiff company at GLBC. This would be considered a great beer from many American brewers who offer only the fizzy yellows."
"Pours an orangish hue with a white head, a light to medium body malty beer with enough kick to keep things fun. A decent offering from GLBC. This beer would make a good session ale a couple times a year. Not the best offering from GLBC but a solid as hell red ale."
"I finished my classes today and turned in my last paper before spring break, so on my way home from class I stop at the liquor store. Good thing I did it seems they recieved a new Great Lakes product whoo hoo! This Irish ale pours a fine amber with a creamy tan full head that is already leaving me a nice even ring of lace. The aroma is a very slight hop aroma with caramel malt sweetness to it, overall pleasant. In the taste category this beer combines a bit of a smokey blend to it with a rather sharp bite to it between the balance of malt to hops. Overall a selection I am happy to be able to find on the kickoff of this St. Patrick's Day weekend. This beer is medium to light in body and it sustains a smooth lighter mouthfeel to it, and I only wish I could find it on tap by St. Paddy's cuz I think this would be my go to on that day!"
"Overall, a very good example of the style."
"Clear amber colored brew with an ivory colored head that fades to a thin carbonation layer. Aroma is deeply malted and earthy. Caramel notes as well. Flavors of hearty malt and caramel with a delicate bitter hop bite. Over the top malts are sure to please those malt lovers out there. Finishes strong. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Thanks to aaronh for this wonderful offering from Great Lakes."
"This beer is a rich amber highlighted red ale that pours with a half-inch off white head. The head slowly fades to a thin film indicative of a malty beer. A very nice lace pattern is left on the glass. The aroma is very malty, with a touch of hops. The combination of the sweetness and the hops almost has a cinnamon charcter to it. Very intruiging. The flavor shows some nice hop bitterness up front, with a very solid malt background. Hints of peat smokiness show through in the mid, with a decent bitterness on the finish. A nice balamce of malt and hops make this very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a bit sharp, but yet refreshing. The overall balance of this beer makes it very drinkable. It is a shame this is only offered a couple of months a year. Worth a try. May especially appeal to bourbon and scotch fans, as the flavor profile is reminiscent of a good, smooth bourbon. Great Lakes has yet to disappoint me."
"A great looking ruby-red, medium bodied beer that pours to give a nice off white head and lace.It carries a stronger malt flavor with a fruity overtone, almost cherry-like. It drinks very smooth but leaves the mouth dry. The bottle credits a 1995 world beer champ on my 02 sample, I can't beleave im the first review. I got the end of this years run on this seasonal, Jan--March St. Pats, brew. It will be a good find next winter."
