Nose is malty and sweet with caramel and a buttery toasty nutty scent.  Light floral and grass with a vague fruitiness.  Sweet grain.  Taste follows the nose.  Extremely pleasant.  Smooth  malt brings plenty of flavor to the palate as the hops are just blushing in the background with a light fruitiness and sweet grass.  Mouthfeel is medium and this finishes not quite dry with a supple malty resonance.  The hops are only in the finish for balance and this one drinks like a charm.  An easy going laid back sipper from great lakes.","utopiajane","Jan 12, 2015"

Light carbonated mouthfeel makes it an excellent session beer and a good beginner brew for the new beer nut palate. It is worth noting that this beer varies a bit year to year, just like many Great Lakes brews. Some times more malty, sometimes thinner, but all in all highly quaffable.","Brutaltruth","Jul 20, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cal that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, pear, apple, raisin, floral, herbal, pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, raisin, pear, floral, herbal, light pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, raisin, pear, floral, herbal, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of bready malt, yeast ester, and light-moderate hop flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Irish red ale. All around good balance and robustness of bready malt, yeast ester, and light-moderate hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 07, 2014"

It is well balanced from start to finish. The mouthfeel is medium in body with so so carbonation. Overall it is a decent sessionable beer and worth a try.","WoodBrew","Aug 23, 2013"

This Irish ale gets back to the basics of crafting exceptional brews and with the kind of stuff that's being created in the U.S. right now we sometimes forget these simple yet brilliant ales. This is reviewed based on what they accomplished with the idea they had. This wasn't intended to start a new trend or be an insanely flavored giant. This is the basics of brewing and done perfectly. Sometimes a beer doesn't have to be a 9% abv brew to get a high rating. I applaud beer like this done right.","BradtheGreat7","Jul 17, 2013"

3.81,0.5,4,3,4,4.5,4,"Pours completely transparent, somewhere between amber and ruby in color with a healthy off-white head. Aroma is mild and unobtrusive. I had no idea what to expect from this beer in terms of flavor, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First sip invokes a sweet, malty, lightly spiced flavor with a very smooth feel. It's easy for caramel malt to become cloying if one's not careful, but I don't find that to be the case here. There's just enough citric hop flavor to balance the sweetness, making this brew very easy to drink. My only grievance is that things fall apart a bit on the back end, where an indefinable and slightly metallic aftertaste overstays its welcome. That transgression is fairly minor though in the grand scheme of things, and I would readily endorse this irish red ale as a fine session beer and something worth trying if you're looking for something a little off the beaten path.","MaximalC","Mar 12, 2012"

This beer went down fairly smooth, one went down smooth and I might be able to drink another one but after that I think the sweetness would start to get to me. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was pretty spot on for an Irish Red Ale. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, I think the sweetness needs to be toned down some to make this beer more enjoyable and drinkable. I don't think I would buy this beer again, there are better Irish Red Ales to be found that are more available at the same price. I don't really recommend this beer unless you are a huge Irish Red Ale, I find it to be a pretty middle of the road kind of beer. Great Lakes is a pretty solid brewery and this beer was Ok, but it just wasn't that memorable of beer and it really didn't hold my attention, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Feb 03, 2012"

It pours a clear copper topped by a finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose comprises caramel, light greens, oak, and a light-ish dash of orange peel. The taste follows fairly closely, with notes of orange peel, light caramel, sweet rice, and a sort of celery-type flavor. Everything has a vague sweetness to it, though a similarly vague bitterness pervades as the finish nears. I'm still not sure if they go together all that well. (I'll get back to ya.) The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a decent brew, especially in the capacity of accompanying the burger, but frankly nothing all that special.

The same flavor is in the palate but is milder and at least there is a good malt base with toasted and caramel flavors to make it drinkable.

Nose is paler malts, a hint of hops to it, but pretty much a straightforward ale... the red malts don't make much of a play in the nose. Taste follows similar to the nose, and the red malts make a bit of a stronger play, though they are weak at best. Overall, the flavor is a bit lacking, though not necessarily 'off'.

Immaculate red amber color that captures light very well, brightening as a result, the bubbles appear haphazardly, you can see some big ones glued to the glass bottom. The nose has a big malty profile emphasizing cocoa, toffee, scone and danish, more breakfast flakes than lunch bread, mix of pepper and pine, at best get generalized white citrus, the peach, apple, pear fruit scents hover in the background. Full-bodied with somewhat sloppy carbonation, foams through the mouth like a gregarious fat guy. There's a tart to outright sour element here which tempers any excesses in the foundational sweetness. More grain bread in play here, some rye too. Still, honey, caramel, chocolate and brown sugar discerned. Orange and lesser pink grapefruit take the baton without a hitch. Apricot, nectarine, peach fruit with a little pineapple for good measure. Finishing with even more chocolate on the scene.

My last trip, my buddy advised that I try it as a draft. I did and it was like a different brew. It came to life with punch and aroma.

It has pretty much everything I like in a beer, hops that are not overly done, malts that are not overly sweet, a nice dryness that makes me yearn for another sip and a mouthfeel that reminds me more of a cask ale than a bottle of soda.

Its taste was mild in my opinion, caramel with moderate malt, and a little smokiness in the back just as in its smell. I didn't particularly like its mouthfeel. Its carbonation vanished as I got to the bottom of my glass, giving it a flat feel. More carbonation would have made it much more drinkable.

A well-rounded mild hop scent draws it all together. For the first second the heavier side of the malt is present, but it is immediately followed by the hops and lightens up to a caramel, bread flavor. The citrus is present but fleeting, which is fine because I think too much would have ruined the brew. Overall very smooth and easy to drink.

It's deep-amber/copper body glows with orange and gold highlights, and the creamy off-white head holds just fine, leaving behind spotty walls of lace. The nose is clean with a malty and fruity edge. It's medium bodied and gently crisp on the tongue. In many ways it's just your basic Irish red ale, but it does have a distinct malty character that's caramelish, toasty, and offers the suggestion of some roastiness in the background. Blanced towards sweetness, the bitterness is just enough to give it ballast and keep it from becoming sweet. Nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Apr 09, 2007"

Taste is the nose multiplied, with more complexity and subtlety. The malt really shows its colors toward the finish with a meager flourish of caramel and lightly toasted malt. Bitterness is very subdued, just present enough to provide good balance for the subtle malt. Mouthfeel feel is maybe a tinge thin, maybe not, but it does provide for good drink ability. This is definitely a beer that could be sessioned especially on a summer day, but because of its slight heartiness it could be decent during winter.

The taste is also creamy and sweet, but really well-balanced at the end. I notice a grassy, sort of mossy flavor, too, slightly minty in the aftertaste. So far this one is hitting all the right notes for me. It's very pleasant in the mouth, too, perfectly carbonated and just the right consistency.

The overall smooth, nutty malt character is very tasty. The finish is dry, bready, and yeasty with some cocoa powder notes remaining the longest. Medium mouthfeel, some carbonated fizz, and little cloying make for some appealing attributes.

It had good retention leaving behind it plenty of white sticky lace. Really nice appearance! The aroma was that of piny hops up front and some toasted malt in the background. Not too much going on in the aroma, but it was still very good. I found the taste to be sweet with piny hops up front and plenty of toasted malts in the background. After the malts, the hops showed up again at the end. The mouthfeel was carbonated with just a slight dry aftertaste. While there was not much stuff going on in this beer, I still found this beer quite enjoyable and highly drinkable on-tap. A must try if you can find this on-tap.","AltBock","Mar 10, 2006"

It feels a bit heavier and thicker than water on the palate and has a dry finish. It is very easy to drink, and is much better warmer as opposed to colder. Not quite a session beer, but I could just chill with some buddies and drink this one all night long.

Sweet caramel and dextrin taste, followed by a very evenly balanced german hop bitterness. Medium body and carbonation, very smooth and almost creamy.

Slightly tart from the yeast. Tastes malty sweet with very little notes of hop flavor and bitter only for balance. Cloying mouthfeel. Has a medium, creamy body.

Smell somehow reminds me of Irish soda bread, with some leafy hop. Tastes very toasty, and has a nice bitter finish. Not quite as hoppy as St. Rogues Red I've had at the same time but they are present. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth for a 6.5% a.b.v. red ale.

There is a big grainey biscuity aroma, wih a touch of sweetness, but not something that appeals to me. The flavor is okay. There is a big grain character, with a bit of a spicey grain quality.

Biscuits, malts and some sweet orange juice detected on the nose. Caramel malts, a bit dry, maintains a decent hop flavoring. As she warms, some juicy sweetness, bubble-gum offerings are found. Butterscotch, toasted bread, very rich and filling, in a good way. The backbone has a spicy bite that combines wonderfully with the wonderful texture and body that this beverage has! One darn fine Irish Red!","GeoffRizzo","Mar 31, 2005"
3.92,3.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Great Lakes usually provides exemplary models for the beers they create, and the fact that this brew is merely above average is kind of a letdown. Still, its pretty good. Deep ruby amber color with a medium beige head and thin lacing. The aroma is roasted malt and caramel. Medium-bodied and on the carbonated side, with flavors of sweet malt, light hops and a bit of fruit. The finish is clean and somewhat sweet.

The taste is quite mild with a mellow taste almost like tea. The malts are sweet and the hops are subdued. Although the alcohol is a little higher than some, it would make for a nice session beer.

Lots of toasty biscuity malt, subtle grassy hops with a light yeasty fruitiness. Big on the sweet biscuity malt complete with tea-like tannins, some herbal hops come through in the finish. A touch of fruitiness gives it an extra dimension of depth. Medium to fuller bodied, it is one of the better Irish red ales I've tried. Very drinkable.","crookedhalo","Feb 08, 2005"
4.6,21.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a nice sunset orange/red color with an off-white froathy head. The smell is sweet, flowery, and clean. The taste is wonderfully complex. The malts are big, lending a great toasted flavor. The hops are used sparingly, just enough to balance the malt and still make their presence known. A hint of caramel and citrous fruit gives extra complexity. A noticeable spiciness is also present. This light and refreshing brew disappears quickly, I should have bought an extra 6 pack.","BeerFink","Feb 07, 2005"

This sets the standard for all others to follow in the category, and is everything I want in a red. Amazingly drinkable, I could put these back all night long. Reminds me to a certain extent of Fat Tire with the wonderful toast and biscuits. I absolutely love this stuff and it will become a regular addition. Amazingly balanced and rich, without ever fatiguing the taste buds. Another amazing brew from the alchemists at GLBC! Highly recommended.","Mitchster","Jun 18, 2004"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured to a copper red colour with an overly long lasting head which seemed to destroy any semblance of lace. A rich carmel/toffee aroma overtook the slight waft of whiskey malt (perhaps a sour mash).

4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A red ale is sort of like a center in football - he never gets noticed as long as he does his job. The only time anyone pays attention is when he fumbles. Likewise, a good red ale seems to be a beer that happily slips into the background, solid and easygoing, and largely unnoticed unless it is bad. Consequently, this beer deserves being singled out for praise for doing quite well what it sets out to do. No screaming hops, no massive malt, just a well-balanced, easy to drink beer. Nicely nutty and smooth, with just enough hops to balance the malt. A tip on the scale toward the sweet side, but just barely. Would be a great session ale, but I fear the abv will sneak up on me.","Brent","Mar 28, 2004"

4.13,9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Decided to finally try this the day before St. Patrick's day. This beer poured as nice dark reddish gold color and formed a nice foamy white head that retained itself very nicely. It coated the glass with lace when it finally drifted away. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops and some small spice and caramel elements. A flavor of malt, caramel and some hops present. Fairly sweet notes in the flavor and finish of this beer, with some spriteness in the finish. Great Lakes can rarely go wrong with their beers.","Wildman","Mar 16, 2004"
3.9,2.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a dark copper/amber color with a white foamy almost fluffy head. There was a decent amount of lacing in the glass. Smells somewhat like caramel with some toasted notes along with it. Taste is slightly sweet, caramel with a dryness to it. Some amount of bitterness in the finish, but not overwhelming. I found it to be medium bodied. I didn't feel that it was particularly drinkable, mainly because of the dryness, but I did find it to be good. This usually surfaces around St. Patricks Day, and is another quality brew from Great Lakes.","Bierguy5","Mar 14, 2004"
3.91,3.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear bright copper in color with an off-white head. Aroma consists of caramel and malt with just a touch of toffee sweetness. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with some sharp carbonation upfront. Rich malt characteristics dominate the taste. Flavor is less sweeter than anticipated from the nose. Malt front is overshadowed toward the back of the tongue by a very assertive hop profile. Toasted malt flavor returns after the hops subside. Buttery finish.

Pours a copper or orangish amber with a nice tan head; it also has some nice ruby highlights. The lacing is adequate if not great. The taste is full of malt sweetness, but gets some dryness from adequate hops. A good beer that has to run in stiff company at GLBC.

The aroma is a very slight hop aroma with caramel malt sweetness to it, overall pleasant. In the taste category this beer combines a bit of a smokey blend to it with a rather sharp bite to it between the balance of malt to hops. Overall a selection I am happy to be able to find on the kickoff of this St. Patrick's Day weekend.

A very nice lace pattern is left on the glass. The aroma is very malty, with a touch of hops. The combination of the sweetness and the hops almost has a cinnamon charcter to it. Very intruiging. The flavor shows some nice hop bitterness up front, with a very solid malt background. Hints of peat smokiness show through in the mid, with a decent bitterness on the finish. A nice balamce of malt and hops make this very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a bit sharp, but yet refreshing. The overall balance of this beer makes it very drinkable. It is a shame this is only offered a couple of months a year. Worth a try. May especially appeal to bourbon and scotch fans, as the flavor profile is reminiscent of a good, smooth bourbon. Great Lakes has yet to disappoint me.","aaronh","Jan 21, 2003"
4.23,11.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A great looking ruby-red, medium bodied beer that pours to give a nice off white head and lace.It carries a stronger malt flavor with a fruity overtone, almost cherry-like. It drinks very smooth but leaves the mouth dry. The bottle credits a 1995 world beer champ on my 02 sample, I can't beleave im the first review. I got the end of this years run on this seasonal, Jan--March St. Pats, brew. It will be a good find next winter.","chilidog","Jul 28, 2002"
