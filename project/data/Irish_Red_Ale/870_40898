It was an exceptional ale, but I can't give it an exceptional rating because of the way it was presented. It was clearly not an Irish red ale. As other reveiewers have mentioned, this is not the way an Irish red ale is meant to taste. There were too many hops and that distinct fruitiness is that isn't meant to be an Irish red. Good beer, though, so I have to give it a pretty good score.","ElCommodoro","Sep 07, 2011"

3.65,1.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Malty aroma has a fruity underpinning, and is not strong but still inviting. It pours a clear amber-copper with an off-white head that doesn't stick around for long. Flavor has a core of malt plus subtle fruity, caramel, grassy and woody tones and a whisper of honey sweetness. Texture is about average fairly smooth and gently fizzy. Overall, not great but still worthy.","Cyberkedi","Jul 30, 2011"

3.8,5.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Aroma is of light caramel, roasted nuts, light touches of butterscotch like sugary notes. Warming brings out a very earthy and pronounced flavor to it. Really nice done but a touch light. This is my only complaint as it did not have the pop I was really looking for at the time. Smooth, even flavor really did not deviate much from beginning to end as the overall impact was nicely put together. A bit light on the feel but this helped to keep it very drinkable and the subtly sweet finish was the icing on the cake.","mikesgroove","Apr 12, 2011"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"O: Another fine brew from Moylan's. I have never gone wrong with one of their ales yet -- all have been solid and some have been spectacular (Hopsickle, Imperial Stout). And the price is right, too.","argock","Mar 06, 2011"

3.35,-6.7,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Yeah, it's missing something. I like the light graininess and the nutty characters, and it's light enough to be quite drinkable for a beer clocking in above session strength, but there's something too light, too dumbed down about it for me to really enjoy it. Tasty enough, but something I'll probably forget pretty quickly.","lacqueredmouse","Jul 17, 2010"
3.98,10.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a Duvel glass, this beer is a deep reddish-amber color with a colossal head, worthy of the glass. Quite lovely to look at. The aroma is quite good as well: Light caramel, with bready melanoidens, modestly fruity. The taste is appropriate for the style: fairly sweet malt, with a hint of toastiness to the bread-like flavor, rather estery. Bitterness is low, and no hop flavor is to be found. The body is a tad watery, which I count the only real flaw.","allengarvin","Jun 27, 2010"

3.68,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Medium body and carbonation. Pretty refreshing overall. This isn't incredibly exciting but it is fairly drinkable when you're in the mood for the style.

3.02,-15.9,3,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Taste is a bit fruity and buttery to be considered a clean, malty red ale. The peat that I noticed in the nose carries on into the flavor and contributes more to the 'unclean' feel of this beer. I am not getting much caramel sweetness which usually is a trademark of the style. Body is a touch on the light side and the ABV is well hidden. Hoppy bitterness creeps in on the finish but really does not contribute much overall. I cant think of too many positive traits for Danny's Irish Style Red Ale, and at nearly 5 bucks a bomber I can say with certainty I wont be buying it again. It's not a horrible beer, but average at best.","twiggamortis420","Dec 20, 2009"

3.7,3.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I like i and it's smooth, but it's not nearly as drinkable as it should be for the low-key smoothness and isn't really a session beer, which is what I think it should be. It becomes a little tiresome and heavy, in part because it has a lot of alcohol for the amount of flavour and complexity you get. For this level of character, I'd go with many other beers that have a lot less alcohol while for the alcohol I'd go with beers with a lot more interest and character.","Offa","Jun 16, 2009"

Very nice toasted malt aroma. Very pronounced aroma that is quite pleasing. Flavor profile is quite balanced between caramel maltiness and toasted maltiness. It's a good blend. Just a titch of ghostly smoke/peat character. Hops aren't detectable. Only around for a little countering effect if anything. A bit dry on the finish. Highly quaffable and tasty.","Bighuge","Beers"
3.08,-14.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a nice reddish amber with a light head that fades quickly to a thin cap. Somewhat strange herbal and malty aromas that are a little light. The taste is surprisingly bland. There is some dry malt, some faint fruitiness and some faint bitterness, but the flavors all sort of cancel each other out. Not bad, but pretty neutral. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and the malt starts to grow a bit as i warms up, but its not too sweet. Not terrible, just a misses the mark a bit.","Georgiabeer","0"

I paid around $4 for the bomber, and at 6.5% ABV, the buzz is very euphoric and present at the end without the alcohol making itself known in the taste. And though it's complex, it's balanced and doesn't lean too far over to the malt side, which, for me, throws a lot of reds off-kilter and makes many too derivative. I could drink much more of this, and if it's ever in 6-packs I could see this being a nice staple for the spring.","asabreed","Mar 17, 2008"

This beer was way too over-carbonated, I must have picked up a bad bottle. I managed to only salvage about half a pint glass of beer each for me and my wife. I figured we should at least try a sip or two to see what it tastes like. Actually, it wasn't too bad. It was red colored (obviously) but had a nice apple flavor aspect to it. A bit better than I expected. Too bad that we were only able to have about 4 oz each. As I am not a huge fan of Irish Reds to begin with, I wasn't expecting much.

Toasted biscuit malt notes are evident up front and there is a touch of dark grain astringency in the finish, though I wouldn't say there is any roast character here. Lots of caramelized crystal malt character here, this brew is practically definite by it. The hops play a supporting role here; most noticeable as a light to nipping bitterness in the finish, but there is also a nice herbal hop flavor here as well. There is an almost saccharine quality to the berry-sweetness in the finish here, not sure what is giving the beer this taste, but it is a touch distracting at times. Still this is mostly a really nice, malty beer that is easy drinking and great for those who like the malt focused equivalent of a Pale Ale.","Gueuzedude","Mar 09, 2007"

The beer itself had a rather mild smell, but hints of sweet malt and caramel find their way through. This ale had a very low hop presence (I like that however), giving way to mild malt and meandering honey notes, finishing clean yet sweet. A nice medium body, although probably a bit to much to be considered a session brew. Pairs great with....yep, corned beef and cabbage. Throw in a few slices of rye bread, and spin the Irish pub tunes...Enjoy","Greenfloyd","Jan 20, 2007"

Vanilla, grape, sweet malt make this an interesting smelling beer. The taste is creamy and wine like. Sweet malt, some hops, and mostly dark fruit and grapes make this a very different red ale. The m/f is light with a combination of flavors that don't reallt go well together. Not horrible,but this just isn't my cup of tea.

3.47,-3.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Hazy reddish amber in hue w/ a quickly dissapating off - white head.  Sweet, ripe fruit esters (smells like starfruit!), nutty malt, dark caramel and a touch of roasted barley in aroma w/ a floral and somewhat spicy hop nose.  The overall aroma is quite odd, yet somewhat enticing.  Flavorwise, this beer is an interesting mix of fruity esters and assertive caramel sweetness.  Although sweet upfront, hop and roasted grain bitterness surfaces late, w/ lightly tart yeast - derived flavors perceptible as well.  The body is a touch thin, unfortunately, leaving the mouthfeel slightly weak. The Goldings hop flavor is akin to damp flowers.  Finishes w/ biscuit notes and light, but more fruitiness lingering...  This is one strange brew.  The esters are odd, and perhaps a bit too dominant.  The flavor components don't seems to coalesce here... that being said, I found myself readily drinking this due to its oddity in flavor.  Moylan's Irish Red is worth a try, but I'm unsure if I'd purchase it again.","marc77","0"

You expect lots of carmel malt sweetness and you get it both in the smell and taste. Also some earthy, roasted smells. Very big malt flavors, rich sweet, and creamy. Just a touch of late hops, again reminds you it's Moylan's. I could see this as meal in itself, but combined with a snowy cold day, roast beef, and mashed potatos, this would make for grinning, belly rubbing heaven.
