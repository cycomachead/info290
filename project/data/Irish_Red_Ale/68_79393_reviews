"Pours a nice deep red amber with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell was full of toasted malt and caramel scents. The taste was very refreshing with those sweet toasted flavors coming through in the beginning before a crisp finish and clean aftertaste. Really liked this one for the season."

"I'm buzzed I liked it. Why do have to justify my answer?"

"Overall:  This is a delicious Irish-style red ale!  Great flavors of malt and sweetness, wrapped up in a creamy beer.  I’m definitely getting a six pack of this every year!"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and grains. Taste is malts, caramel, some grains, smooth and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes for a fine session or warm weather beer."
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, toast, and nut aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet toast, earth, and nut flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid toast and nut qualities all around."

"Overall it's a doable red ale, but misses some of the malt thickness and sweetness I am expecting."
"O-I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did. smooth, malty, easy to drink. nothing extraordinary but I would definitely reach for one of these again...maybe its the 4-leaf clovers?"
""
"O: Eh, it's pretty damn uneventful. This beer reminds me that while Flying Dog makes some great stuff on occasion (The Truth), they've also got a few stinkers in the line-up (hi there, K-9). Natch, this is closer to the latter. Or maybe I just don't like this style that much - I mean, there's little to differentiate this from *shudder* an ESB to me. This one isn't going to be repeat purchase."

"Pours a reddish copper with a finger of beige head that lingered a bit, particularly in the edges of the glass. The nose is malty. The flavor profile is driven by taste of amber malt and includes a trace of sweetness. There is also a hint of cloves in the flavor. The tingling dry bitterness on the finish is a pleasant way to end a decent, but not extraordinary drinking experience."

"O - An average red ale, enough said."
""
""

"Overall I will pretty much try anything for a buck and even though I only had one bad Flying Dog brew (tire bite) this one is pretty close. I haven't had the Old Scratch in forever so maybe this uses the same recipe? Regardless it wasn't that great."

"O: Sort of a bland amber ale. Nothing really stands out or will be rememberable."
"O: A little more hoppy than other reds, but an enjoyable mix of flavors. Smooth and easy to drink, Lucky offers nice flavor without overkill."
""
""
"OVERALL: Solid all day Irish ale, compliments to the brewer on this one. Spot on."
""
"Really solid example of the style, a little more hoppy than usual. Not sure what the 4 leaf clovers contributed besides being a marketing ploy."
"Nice red ale. Even after that boring nose. Recommended."
"A fun quaff for the most part, was hoping for a bit more on the malty side or pushing the envelope in other ways."
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, nice little kiss of hops, tangy spiciness(could this be the 4-leaf clovers that supposedly used in the brewing of this beer?) Who knows? That being said this ia a pleasant, drinkable Irish Red."

"Clean. That's the word that struck me about this one. Complete clarity visually. Clean flavor profile. Might strike some as thin. Slick sweetness with a lot of malt presence, but nothing too out there. Easy to drink. Not really all that inspiring, but a nice enough beer."
"Overall - Irish Red Ales usually aren't my favorite style, but this one is pleasant and an easy flavorful drinker. Recommended for a sampling by all."
""
"This has really surpassed my expectations. As a beer touting that it's brewed with 4-leaf clovers, I was a little skeptical. Forget the clovers, this is a damn good Irish Red!"
"Overall - Decent, a little weak but for a 5.5% beer, it drinks well and has enough flavor to enjoy. A little more hop kick would work really well with the clover, leafy flavors. Still good, a nice beer to drink a few off at one sitting."
"Not a bad Irish Red. The malt bill was certainly showcased here. I can't really speak to the clover though. I guess it's definitely a novel marketing concept."

"Real clover in the boil, really cool. I didn't get any clover (not that i'd be able to identify the taste of clover) from the beer but interesting for sure. Beer poured a nice deep reddish hue and super clean / clear. Really nice tight 2 finger head that remained for the entire drink. The first sip was really nice and smooth nothing overpowering anything else. The malt and hops played nicely with each other. I could drink this all day. Really nice carbonation and medium bodied."

"This wasn’t anything too earth shattering for an Irish Red Ale but it’s flavorful enough with a nice crisp bite to it that keeps this quenching on the palate. This was a good one to pair up with some barbecue here."
""
""
"Decent beer here. Poured a clear golden brown with a fluffy white head that receded to a ringlet and left some nice lacing on the glass. Not really a deep red color or darker amber like other beers of the style. Light aroma of toasted malts, grains, caramel. The taste followed the aroma, lightly toasted, malty, light caramel, cereal grains. Light body, easily drinkable and enjoyable. Nothing extraordinary here, but quite sessionable overall."
