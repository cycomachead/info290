The taste is a good mix of malt and roasted grains.  Smooth with some depth of flavor.  A nice mouthfeel and only a slight bitter hop finish.  This is a very good ale.","supervike","Mar 25, 2015"

I'm really glad I went for this instead of one of the mass-market ones (Smithwick's is probably the best of the lot, but not as good as this) at this time of year.  Nice color, lots of lacing, big head, just a really nice looking beer that tastes great.  One of Boulevard's better beers for sure.","dcscientist","Mar 17, 2015"

Pours a medium to dark brownish red amber with a two finger light khaki head that seemed fizzy during the pour, but had good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark stone fruit and a hint of grassy hops. Flavor is biscuit malt with a light toastiness, earthy; finishes with a mildly astringent dry grassy hop bitterness with dry biscuit malt. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A nice domestic take on an Irish red ale, covers all the bases for the red profile, with a nice lightly toasty maltiness and a dry almost tannic finishing bitterness. Pleasant mouth feel.","LiquidAmber","Feb 25, 2014"

The taste brings in more of the same, with a hearty balance maintained for most of the proceedings. Things topple a bit in the end, though, as the greens puncture through with a mild wave of soil-laden grassy bitterness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.

Sweet malt, caramel, and some herbal hops are noticeable in the nose, with the slightest hints of roasted malt discernible as well. The flavors of this brew closely follow the nose, with the sweet malt dominating the pallet out front, hints of caramel and toffee poking through, and a long, sustained finish with a touch of floral hop flavor and bitterness in the end. A medium level of carbonation is met with a medium-high body. Another wonderful example of the "Irish Red Ale" category.","phishsihq","Mar 18, 2012"

The beer is very malty and tastes much better then it smells. The toasted malt flavor dominates and it finishes smooth. The beer is slightly sweet and well balanced.

The aroma is different from most Irish Reds. More hoppy than malty. A large dose of citrus and spicy hops before the malt underneath can be detected. The hops also play a large role in the flavor. Almost has a German Pilsener hop charactor. The typical caramel malt flavor comes in after the initial hop flavor. Bittersweet is a perfect discriptor for the taste. The body feels a little light which is not surprising considering the malt profile. Atypical for the style but it might appeal more drinkers because of the hops.","morimech","Apr 11, 2010"

The head dissolves away quickly leaving some traces of lacing to become thin film on top. The sweetness of malt along with cracked grain, bread, and biscuit are the main fragrances. The malt also dominates the taste as well with a hearty bread flavor with the addition of sweet caramel. A biscuit flavor develops towards the end it finishes with a mild grassy bitterness. A light and watery feel grows to become more medium bodied. Halfway across the palate the foaming sensation of carbonation come out cleanses the back of the palate. This may the closest beer to this style I have had yet.

There wasn't much of a smell, but what smell there was came across as malty. The taste was malty with only a slight amount of hops. I haven't had a ton of Irish Red Ales, but this one tasted good to me. I would definitely try it again.","Mora2000","0"

Lot's of fruity esters going on that I tend to associate with Boulevard. There's kind of a tinge of piny hops. Taste is sufficiently malty with a good bit of toastiness. There's the fruitiness here which reminds me of fruity bubblegums. There's a bit of that "beyond-toasted" malt character that I get from Fat Tire and much of the New Belgium line here which almost gives off the effect of cocoa powder. Slight medicinal flavors. Bit of pine hop in the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate to light in weight and extremely creamy. Drinkability is OK.

Aroma isn't out of this world. Pretty basic with a big caramel sweetness finishing with citrus hops that gives it the sensation of smelling orange rinds. Taste is much the same with a malty presence the melds into the hops. It's not as sweet as the nose would have you believe. My biggest problem is that there is a slight metallic taste to it.

4.01,9.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,5,5,"Boulevards spring seasonal, available Mid-Jan through mid-April. Irish Ale pours a beautiful, deep, burnt orange color with an amazing, nitro-like head of tan, tiny-bubbled foam, creating a sheeting blanket of lace down the sides of the glass. The head lasts forever... The nose is very understated, but a vigorous swirl reveals a slight, roasted malt character. The super-smooth, velvety body feels like nitro, but without the helium aftertaste. The taste is pretty nicemalty, without being roasty or thick, and still quite fresh tasting, like recently cracked malt. With the obligatory, low hopping rate, this beer tends toward a bit of sourness in the finish, but not too much. Also, this beer is sweetish, but not overly so. The hops make a very brief, herbal appearance in the middle of the flavor, and then recede again, forced into their minor role by the complex maltiness. I keep coming back to the smoothness of the body though. Its really extraordinary. If this isnt the perfect macro to micro transition beer, I dont know what is: sweetish, but not syrupy, barely hoppy, but not at all bitter, and easier and smoother to drink than proper Guinness. I really wish I had more of this stuff","TXHops","Jan 15, 2003"
3.98,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Bronze, highlights of orangey-copper, creamy off-white head, dissipated quickly, laced well. Faint nose, gentle nuttiness and mild caramel notes, yeasty (acidic-fruity) at the end. Tasty! Mild caramely-sweet, malty, slightly nutty the hops are ideal, yeast is noticeable. Balanced, malt leads but the hops cannot be ignored. Finishes slightly acidic, sweetish, candy-like malt not sticky in the slightest, clean almost. What a smooth quaff. Off the charts on the ease to drink scale. Great seasonal beer for all your session drinking needs Id recommend it.","bditty187","Jun 02, 2002"

4.03,10.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Dark bronze / red hue. Clear w/ a dense head that leaves an intricate lace. Light, nutty caramel notes in aroma, followed by a subtle yeast fruitiness. Slightly sweet, toffee & biscuit malt notes in malt flavor. The well calculated hop bitterness provides sufficient balance for the malt sweetness, but lets overall malt flavors to dominate. There's a slight hint of Kent Goldings hop flavor, but that can be overlooked. Well balanced flavor profile all around. Medium bodied, w/ a very smooth and agreeable mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a touch of fading, clean dark caramel malt with hints of roasted grain. The overall balance of flavor & high drinkability make Boulevard's Irish Ale an excellent session beer.","marc77","0"
