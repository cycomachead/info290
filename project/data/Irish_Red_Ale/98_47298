Taste brings a bit more to the table... caramel malts still dominate with only a light touch of hoppyness, quite grassy, earthy. Lighter bodied and heavily bubbly.

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, slight hops, and some nutty aromas. Taste is much the same with malty and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

3.51,0,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"A lovely clear red amber ale wit a good head and nice lacing. Nose carries aromas of caramel malt light sweetness and some toasted whole grain bread. A light fruitiness blooms as it warms up and indeed this is a beer best served at cool rather than cold temperatures to allow the flavors to develop. Speaking of flavors the taste is nicely malty with lots of caramel malt and chewy breadiness. There is a mild sweetness and firm yeasty fruitiness that is a hallmark of good UK style brewing. This one gets better as it warms. Finish is clean with a touch of metal and lingering toast and grains. Feel is medium light with a smooth and lightly effervescent carbonation. This is a beer that touts itself for St. Patty's day and it is more that up to the task.","scootny","May 01, 2012"
3.78,7.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 5/15/2012. Pours crystal clear reddish orange color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice thin cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, raisin, prune, molasses, banana, bubblegum, clove, floral, and toasted bread. Some pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pepper, bread, banana, bubblegum, raisin, molasses, floral, toasted malt, and yeast spices. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, banana, clove, and pepper on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors with good complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Very easy and smooth to drink. Overall this is a very nice Irish red ale! Very nice amount of flavor and balance for being almost a session beer. I would have this again.","superspak","Apr 29, 2012"

Aromas of malt depth, with some nutty and scotch characteristics throughout. Light roasting throughout both the aroma and the palate. Strong malt backbone, with layers of nut, caramel, and toffee sweetness blended together into a smooth, rich body. There is a slight hops bitterness that cleans up the tail end of the flavor profile, leading into a light, richly sweet aftertaste. The body is light and smooth, with a sharpness for the finish. Slightly cloying, leaving a slight linger behind. Easy to drink, and some interesting and light flavors.","GarthDanielson","Mar 22, 2012"

It has an attractive reddish/amber hue and a good inch thick head on it after it settled. Christ almighty was I fooled! As I poured this facade of a brew into my eager mouth, I was immediately struck with an incredible shock to my taste buds like a spear to my gut. This beer had rudely interrupted what I thought was going to be a celestial experience. The taste was almost nonexistant...bland would be an understatement. I sensed a cripsness to it that could have been better exploited ...had the beer had better componets to it. The finish was bitter, but I will admit that the aftertaste did not linger as long as I thought it would. I truly missed the presence and aroma of the ingrediants of this brew as I have grown accustomed to smell in other reds that I have tried.

Reminds me of one of the worst beers I have tried, Four Horesmen's Irish red. Yeeeuckkk! Luckily the taste, although slightly similar to that aforementioned travesty of a beer, is actually really good.

3.16,-10,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Out of a bottle provided to me by my good friend Laura this beer was a true garnet color with ruby highlights. The head was two fingers of khaki colored foam that retained well as a thin layer and left streaks of lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, toasted malt and a hint of hops. The flavors were misbalanced starting with bitter grains, then slightly too much of the sweet malts with not enough bittering hops to even it out. Not bad, but awkward. The mouthfeel was watery, the body medium and the carbonation was right on point for the style. A one and done for me.","thekevlarkid","Jan 25, 2010"

Champagne-like bubbles rise to the top of this copper colored brew. Aroma is of sweet malts and some spice. The initial flavor is sweet caramel malt, with a drier finish and a hint of hops. As the beer warms, I am noticing a bitterness that balances the sweetness. There is a good amount of body to this brew, but the high carbonation keeps it from being syrupy or heavy. This is a deliciously uncomplicated beer that I could drink many of.","Ladybugger","Jan 24, 2010"
3.95,12.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a refrigerator chilled bottle into a pint glass. It has a pretty copper color with hints of red. There is a thick tan head made up of many different sizes of bubbles. It leaves a patchy spiderweb of lacing as the head settles. Initially there were a lot of carbonation bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass, but they have quickly disappeared. There are still a few steams of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. It has a slightly spiced malt smell. The beer has a malty flavor reminiscent of graham crackers. This is most prevalent in the finish, as there is a sweeter flavor up front that disappears as you hold the beer in your mouth. The aftertaste is a bit strange; it has kind of a nutty, alcohol flavor. It has kind of a thick body, but I wouldn't go so far to call it a full-bodied beer. The carbonation bubbles feel sharp on my tongue, but that may go away as the drink's temperature rises. The beer goes down pretty well. It's not an incredible complex beer, so you don't feel like you need to think much well drinking it, you can just enjoy it. This is a great beer to have on hand for easy drinking and to share with friends.","ToasterChef","Jan 24, 2010"

It has a dull malt character along with and equally dull finish. Harpoon makes the same tasting beer and keeps renaming it. Everything is dumbed down for the masses. It's a easy drink, but it's a very boring one. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. Harpoon beers continue to uninspire.

It tastes like toffee, caramel, toasted malt and a bit of hops in the finish. But it's a mostly malty sweet beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium with good carbonation and a bit of chewiness.

A deeply earthen-herbal hop flavor balances, while leaving the aftertaste slightly dry but retaining a fair caramel taste. Light-medium/thinnish body gains some texture from dextrin which gives it a pleasent tannic bite- although not quite astringnet. The mouthfeel is mild but flavorful- with medium carbonation.

OK, I'm usually OK with a bit of diacetyl in my English style ales, but this is ridiculous. Diacetyl in the front, mid, and finish, along with some acidity first off and some grapefruity notes at the mid-palate -- but those last two things are overwhelmed by the big D. The finish dries out quickly. Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied, with good, medium carbonation that fills things out. Overall, this beer has only the minor trappings of a successful one (looks, mouthfeel). It's kind of like a hot girl who looks great and feels great in all the right places, but can't carry on a conversation and has poison for a soul.

Has a bold toasted malt aroma with and under-riding hop scent and moderately spiced. Nice strong malt flavor that hits on toasty, dates, nuts, and a light brown sugar flavor. Hops balance out the sweetness well while lending a mild bitterness and spice flavor. Other spices such as nutmeg and ginger. The body is medium and balanced.

The nose is way too clean, this is an ale right? Faint whiffs of nuts and trace amounts of caramel maltiness can be found, once I worked at it a little. The lack of smell removes any hope of an invitation. True, the nose is inoffensive but it is so damn lackluster! It is time to taste, even without an invite. Bland palate. I could end my comments on the taste right there. But I will elaborate a little. First of all, where is the biscuit-like maltiness? Hell, Id settle for some yummy caramel notes. All I get out of this beer is hints of nuts, some grassiness, a moderate bite of bitterness at the back and a large dose of cleanliness. How boring. Im not impressed; frankly it is too bland to be offensive. The mouthfeel is pleasant, the carbonation is modestly high but it seems fitting, medium in body but it could use more malt. Not only for bulk but also for flavor. It is very easy to drink, since nothing bothers to tickle the tastebuds before reaching the throat. This is a very, very run of the mill Amber Ale; nothing about it is memorable (in a positive light anyway). I can think of dozens of Ambers Id pick over this one.

It's also a pretty mediocre one, which is tough going because I have always found Irish reds to be a pretty mediocre style in general. While not as initially repugnant as Harpoon's ESB, this is still pretty unlikable. Malts have a nice base to them, and a twinge of smokiness is brought out by the hops, but there is a huge soap flavor that Harpoon's other beers have. It wrecks the beer, and since Irish reds are usually delicate and mild, the off flavor is overpowering. No more Harpoon for me please.
