Taste is balanced, not too sweet or too bitter and feels great going down, not too heavy but also not too light with a light, not bitter, caramelly aftertaste. Overall his is one of my favorite beers and I do a "BlackSmith" when I want to transition to a heavier stout. Can drink this all evening.","Capt_Pete","Mar 17, 2015"

3.89,12.8,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,4.25,"12 oz. bottle from Cost Plus. Pours a reddish amber with a lasting off white head and plenty of spotty lace. Flavor of caramel malt with hints of honey and a pleasant dry finish. Balanced, clean and refreshing. The body is medium thin and lager-like, but with a creamy mouth feel. Not particularly complex but it’s not supposed to be. A really nice 4.5% ABV session ale.","loubar","Jan 03, 2015"

The aroma is of caramel malts and floral hops for the most part. A bit more going on with the taste with some roasted malts, toffee and slightly nutty flavor in the mix also. Slight bitter aftertaste that lingered a bit more than I would like. Overall, it was OK.","BeerWithMike","Sep 08, 2014"

This one pours a handsome copper red hue with a generous white head and nice lacing. The aroma is malty but unfortunately in the way of a mass produced beer. The flavor is light and sweet and refreshing but yet again carries the taste of the use of inferior grains(I.e. corn). Its a good beer and better than typical lawnmower beers....but not by much.","lochef81","Apr 20, 2014"

Scents of skunked hops, caramel, toasted malt and slight nutty aromas. Not the best scent in the world, but not bad for a red ale. Flavors of toasted malt, caramel, some grainy malt and moderate levels of floral hops throughout with some slight nuttiness. The finish is semi-dry and toasty with a toasty aftertaste. Not bad, not extremely complex but good for a session ale, the toasted, nutty and caramel flavors are quite nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with medium carbonation and a slightly watery mouthfeel. Not bad for a session ale, quite drinkable. Overall this is a decent session ale. Nothing bad about it, but nothing amazing, its still a good enough offering.

Aroma has biscuit malts with a fresh baked bread note, very tame nose on it with a hint of herbal hops in the backend. My wife loves it and I'm frankly okay with this beer enough flavor to keep me interested. Bready malts hints of faint herbal hops well balanced mass produced drinking ale, you can't really go wrong with at least trying this beer especially well protected from the light in can form. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied smooth flowing natural carbonation arises across the palate, I know I like it. Overall, an impressive beer that I would like to indulge in a couple pints of without having to worry about whether or not it's considered craft or not it's an acceptable Irish ale better than most imports these days and that's good enough for me to spend my hard earned dollars.","WVbeergeek","Oct 09, 2013"

While the caramel shines through with woody hints, the power of flavor seems to be lacking. It seems the ease of drinking this red style ale is it's second positive trait. Think Guinness Black but with a lighter carbonation. I did enjoy this beer for its ease of drinkability and deep color but i feel the flavor and alcohol power is lacking. An Irish keg beer.

3.41,-1.2,4.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"The beer pours a dark, dark red, somewhere between ruby, burgundy, and light black, with a lovely white cream head that sits a fingers width above my mug. The lacing on the mug is thin and spattered across my glass. On the nose, the beer smells of sterilized caramelly malts with a touch of staleness. The nose is fairly simplistic, and not the most pleasant but not the most unpleasant either. The smell is a little cloying with sweet malt, but subdued enough that it doesn’t turn you off to the beer. The beer tastes very similar to the smell with sweet sterile caramel malts and a faint touch of bitterness. It begins with almost sickly sweet malts, but quickly pulls itself back with a faint hint of biscuit and more caramel flavor, which balances out the taste into the finish, which is clean and only faintly tingling with the sweet sterile caramel of the malts. On the mouth, the beer feels thin to medium body, with velvety smooth carbonation that reveals only a slight tingle on the close of the sip. Overall, this is a mass produced beer, but it is an Irish mass produced beer, and Ireland just seems to do mass production better than everyone else. Sure it is not as flavorful as some beers, and definitely has some almost-too-sweet flavors to it that are both sterile and weird, but this beer is generally very drinkable, and not offensive to the palate. It’s not a fancy beer, but it’s one that is easy to find and easy to drink, and it does have a hell of a lot better of a flavor than other mass produced beers. It’s a good drink.","Maxwell","Dec 22, 2012"

The nose was sweet with malt and a hint of grass and lemon on the back end. The flavor was sweet with a tiny bit of bitter from the hops and a dry finish. The mouthfeel was nice, being bready and good carbonation. Overall a good solid beer, but not outstanding in any area. I will buy this again from time to time as it's very drinkable.","Rantingfury","Jun 08, 2012"

There's a slight back end bitterness. The flavor is fairly average. The body is light to medium and it's moderately carbonated. It's fairly easy to drink. Overall, this is a mostly average beer.

Taste is a little better, cereal like malts, earthy and nutty flavours, light sweetness and caramel, light bitterness towards the finish, clean aftertaste. The nitro made this creamy and light but unfortunately also makes this close to flat, light carbonation and feel.

3.03,-12.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Smithwick's pours a rusty amber with one-inch of frothy, cream colored head that leaves a good deal of lacing throughout. Sweet malt aromas, mostly biscuit and bready notes, dominate the nose, with hints of caramel poking through as well. The same sweet malt in the nose erupts on the pallet before subsiding into some caramel and hop bitterness that blend perfectly to make this a very well balanced beer. A very crisp and clean finish is a product of a medium amount of carbonation and a creamy, medium body. Exactly what a Irish Red Ale should taste like.","phishsihq","Mar 18, 2012"

Smells initially of a fruity ale yeast esters but it is short-lived, eventually settles down into a normal biscuit malt aroma. Flavor is a grainy and biscuit malt base with an creeping rise of diacetyl butter in the finish, texture is light, crisp and fresh. I cannot find any significant hopping character in either the flavor or aroma, and this is fresh from the tap!! If only the level of butter was reigned in slightly, and some kind of significant hopping accent were present, this one would have been pretty great.","WastingFreetime","Feb 06, 2012"

3.16,-8.4,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Has more in common with a glass of Pepsi than a pint of traditional Irish Ale. Looks great, but the flavor is too light and shallow and the body only accentuates its flaws. Before you can find much flavor, the bubbles scrub your tongue clean. Not a terrible beer by any stretch, but it lakes smooth body, balancing hops and intriguing malt character that Irish Red Ales should strive for. I think its fair to say this is a "dumbed down" example of the style.","BradLikesBrew","Beers"

3.08,-10.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Smithwicks Irish Ale: I sampled a Smithwicks on tap during at the Minneapolis airport. It must have been near the bottom of the barrel, as the bar tender had to resort to filling a pitcher with beer and foam, let a glass of beer settle to the bottom and then pour my glass. So this pour may not be a fair review of Smithwicks, but what can I do. I paid top dollar for this beer, so I will review it as it came. There was a deep tan color to the body with light carbonation. The head was thin and off white with a good aroma of malt and some subtle spice. The Smithwicks had a great malt flavor tempered with a subtle bitter at the finish, some heft to the body. Overall a good Irish Ale, even when I got the bottom of the barrel. It went down easily, and I would have had another if it were not for my one beer per day rule.","iSip","Oct 30, 2011"

4.11,19.1,5,4,4,4.5,4,"As soon as I popped the cap, I was met with a small amount of foam coming through the opening. My gentlest of pours still created better than two thick fingers of tawny head with excellent retention. When they describe this as a "red" ale, that red is a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity, like an Autumn sunset. Drool! As the massive head slowly fell, it created some beautiful lacing. Nose was quite biscuity, not terribly sweet. Mouthfeel was medium and the biscuit malt taste was prevalent on the tongue. Finish was slightly dry and definitely refreshing on a breezy summer afternoon.","woodychandler","Jun 27, 2011"

The retention is average and it leaves an average amount of lacing. The aroma of the Irish Red smells of toasted malt. The taste of the ale is slightly toasted with some caramel maltiness.

Trim amber color with a redwood brown influence, pleasingly aggressive bubbles streams, orange tint grows around outer edges. Mildly burnt character to the nose, like sugar left too long on the stove, malty with toffee, chocolate powder, carob, roasted chestnuts, has its loamy/earthy side as well, pinch of pepper, touch of unprocessed grains but little outright bread or dough, can appear herbaceous at moments, especially when warmer. Medium-bodied, foamy with a level of carbonation arguably above what the body should have to support. Smooth like fine sandpaper, you feel some grit and then it immediately releases. The sweetness seems frontloaded, cocoa and carob, cola, licorice, honey and orange peel before a momentary flutter of apple, pear, cherry fruit, then more biting grass and straw notes, semi-caked in dirt. Still, the carbonation ensures a creamier finish. Good pub beer style, likely better on tap.","farrago","Apr 01, 2011"

Super sweet and tangy malts on the tongue when you first taste the beer. There is a very subtle underlying hops bitterness that creeps up on the end of the flavors. It helps greatly to balance all the sweetness. Also, there is a roasted quality that reveals itself after the beer has had some time to warm in the glass a bit.

Maybe some apple cents as well. Other fruits are possibly here also. Other than that there isn't much to speak of on the nose, pretty weak. Oh man, kinda disappointing on the taste. It tastes like an irish beer for sure, but not nearly as full as say a Guinness. It has a very nice crispness to it, but it just doesn't have that umph that some other irish beers have. Not much hops in the flavor, it's really all just malts, like I expected. Mouthfeel is ok, but like I said, not much umph. Drinkability is very high, but that's to be expected with an irish beer.

There is a light maltiness, light grassiness and slight funk to the smell. It's medium-by-light bodied; Smooth and creamy, with a pretty crisp, mineral finish. There's not too much flavor, but it's not bland. The light, grassy bitterness is balanced with malt that avoids being sweet. They combine to form a resiny flavor. There is a soft, wooden quality to it and a touch of musk. This is clearly a session ale. I kind of assumed it would suck because it's such a big name but now I feel like a jerk for never trying this before. I bet this would be great on cask.","yesyouam","Apr 11, 2010"

Slightly sweet tasting with a mix of roasted malts and a mild hop flavor. Only negative I can think of is it could use a little more to it, mouthfeel may be a little thin and could use the kick. I would have no problems drinking this again though.","changeup45","Aug 20, 2008"

Nice creamy texture, with a tad more carbonation than I'd like, but it finishes very nicely. On the palate, there's a nice dark roasty flavour coming through, grainy and deep. Like toast. It carries a bit of hops with it as well that become more apparent in a few seconds, blending nicely with the nutty toasty flavours. It doesn't carry the same 'weight' that you'd normally associate with such a dark ale, and I think I could probably spend a whole evening putting these down.","prosper","Aug 19, 2008"

Like I said, it lacks its balls. Almost tastes a bit foo-foo. It is still quite pleasant and easy drinking. I would probably drink it again even though it is the epitome of pedestrian brew. Despite its downfalls (or rather, lack of high points), it is a very good all around beer.

There is absolutely nothing there while the beer is in my mouth, and the aftertaste of caramel malt is very mild. The mouthfeel is overcarbonated, which might account for some of the lack of flavor.

Wraping my hands around the pint glass helps warm it to a good temperature. Once the beer is at a good temp the flavors come out much better.
