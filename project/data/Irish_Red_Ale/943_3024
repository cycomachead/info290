3.33,2.8,3.25,3.25,3.25,4,3.25,"O: I have not tried many beers from this brewery, but so far nothing has impressed me. This ale, unfortunately, is no exception. It is not bad by any means, but lacks the depth and complexity of many of the better amber and red ales out there. I would not turn it down, however, and could see it being a good accompaniment to a simple meal of grilled meats and vegetables. I think it could also be a good gateway brew for those just getting into American craft ales.","mrfrancis","May 16, 2013"

Taste, this is a very inviting flavor. There is a sweet flavor with a little hint of beech wood (we think), nice. Overall this is very drinkable brew. One that will go well with a good burger","barleyroad","Dec 21, 2011"

2.18,-32.7,4,3.5,2,1,1,"Appearance in the growler was redish brown color with an almost orange hue to it. When poured, the head was almost non-existent. The smell was fruity like rotten bananas (which isn't necessarily bad). Had an unforgivingly sharp after taste, did not go away without a fight. Mouthfeel, ugh, was like drinking a flat soda. Syrupy feel. I would say how the last gulp was but I didn't get that far. Overall I was thoroughly disappointed considering I had been looking forward to this particular brew ALL week.","austinhensley","Feb 09, 2010"

3.08,-4.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Slight aftertaste with hops and some malt. Medium body and effervescence. A decent brew but a little too hoppy for the style. Additionally, the balance is off.","PorterLambic","Dec 11, 2007"
3,-7.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Draught in one of their Calhoun locations: The first problem with this was the heavily frosted mug they served this in. There were chunks of frost in with my beer. The beer itself was a fairly clear amber color, after the frost subsided. Mine had almost no head and no lacing. The aroma was a mild, slightly sweet caramel malt nose. The taste was decent enough. Slightly sweet caramel malt with a slightly dry finish. Pretty east drinking. Non-descript, average, and uninteresting, however.","Boto","Oct 22, 2007"
3.53,9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - The overall drinkability of this beer was about average. I certainly wouldn't turn one down but I wouldn't seek it out either.","meechum","Aug 04, 2007"

2.47,-23.8,2.5,3,2,3,2.5,"Caramel Malty start with a pleasant bitterness coming in... Not a whole lot going on here though...kinda reminds me of what a Killians Light would taste like. ..if there was such a beast. Hops are noticably absent and the finish is a little over-metallic...even for the style. Nice color but the head leaves faster than the kid who pulled the fire drill. Won't revisit.... but this is not my style preference either....","witster18","Jan 10, 2007"
2.98,-8,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Should have branched out and tried the different varieties but once again my fascination with Red Ales kept telling me to give this one a chance. More like 6 or 7 chances on this particular evening in the Smokies. Not really characteristic of a pure red ale but at the same time a very drinkable beer. Sweet caramel taste but with overtones of dull nothingness and a mouthfeel that really lacks in overall satifaction. The room was too dark for a real view of the color, but from what I could tell it looked more like a pale ale.","dojobrewco","Nov 03, 2006"
2.26,-30.2,3,2,2,3,2.5,"Well what can I say about this brew? This isn't a great beer and is definitely not true to it's style.","rebel1771","Oct 13, 2006"
3,-7.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Had this on tap at the brewery in Pigeon Forge. This was very pale for a red ale, more of an amber color than red. A very thin head with minimal lacing. The flavor is sweet with a strong caramel taste. I think this is close to a pale ale in flavor but not quite a red ale, somewhere in between. This is a crisp and refreshing ale that is smooth to drink and I enjoyed it. Although, someone expecting a full bodied red ale might be dissapointed.","Tuey13","Jul 28, 2006"
3.25,0.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"I've sampled every beer this brewery makes over the past few years, and it had been a while since I'd tried their red ale. The girl refilling my growler request botched my order and gave the red ale instead of the harvestfest Marzen. It pales in comparison to what it did in the mid to late 90's when the brewery first opened. A: Very light amber, too light to be considered a red ale S: low key malts with slight hints of sweet grain T: Very mild with less malt than needed for the style. M: thin and watery D: Not great as this is not a beer I'm happy about getting in lieu of the tasty Marzen. This beer is shadow of its former self as the original Cherokee Ale had much more character, body, and taste. The Noble tribe wouldn't be thrilled about its namesake considering how light in the ass this ale has become.","veech","Jul 18, 2006"
2.68,-17.3,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"This beer looks like a pale ale. There is little head. The smell is really hard to detect. Maybe just a hint of brown sugar. The taste is like a cross of a pale ale and red ale, only this is not all that great. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth but there is a small bit of harshness in the finish. Not a good representation of the style. I could drink again, but probably won't.","Enola","Jun 15, 2006"
3.3,1.9,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours an amber color with an audible fizzy head that is gone in seconds. Smell is dominated by caramel with a hint of wheat and bannana. Flavor again is caramel dominated. Very malty and hops are not noticable. Thin in the mouth. Overall a very average beverage.","wcudwight","Jun 01, 2005"

2.96,-8.6,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"This could be a much better brew if the flavour was kicked up a notch and the freshness issue in the smell was remedied. It's probably my least favourite of their brews that I tried.","SixpointJMH","Beers"

2.9,-10.5,3,3,3,3,2.5,"According to the brewery blurb, this beer was ""inspired by the famous Red ales of Ireland."" Must not have been too inspirational. Overall flavor profile was flat, with none of the robustness that characterizes a good red ale. Needed something, more hops, more malt - something - to punch things up. Okay, but boring.","Brent","May 03, 2004"

3.38,4.3,2,4,3,3,4,"The smell was slightly floral with a slight hint of hop spice. From the start I was not impressed with the appearance it came with zero head and no retention.

1.47,-54.6,3.5,1.5,1.5,1,1,"Props to johnrobe for this. Once again I am let down by a Smoky Mountain brew. I have tried different samples from different trades and so far they have all been sour/vinegary. Pours a weird amber/butterscotch color with a medium light beige head. Light lacing. Aroma is malt and vinegar. Flavor is really too harsh to enjoy at all, you can tell it wants to be malty and smooth but fails. The finish is again sour and fruity. A disappointment.","Dogbrick","Beers"
3.05,-5.9,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"I've enjoyed draught versions of Smoky Mtn. brews in the past, but somehow their beers seem to lose something in the bottle. They just don't seem as full-bodied/ flavored as the draught versions. Oh well, one can tell that bottling is a minor operation for them as they sell bottles only from the brewpub. They don't distribute. Cherokee Red pours a light amber with a wispy white head that quickly disappears. There are some light fruity notes in the nose as well as buttery tones (diacetyl). In the taste there are some sweet caramel tones and just a whisp of fruitiness (candied cherries, ripe apples) in the finish. Unfortunately the brew seems a bit thin.","johnrobe","0"
