2.3,-31.5,4,4,1,3,2,"Saranac Red Ale is unbearable (at least on my palate). It's bitter and tastes like the inside of a cologne bottle. This is seemingly what some beer advocates like; the more bitter and unbearable the tastier it is? I don't get it. Maybe it's like cheese; the stinkier and more bitter the higher the review scores? That said, if you are a regular beer drinker like I am (I drink all different kinds of beers), then you most likely will cringe at the taste of the Red Ale. It's not a beer to drink in your Adirondack Chair; it's a beer to drink when you're already wasted from a few Landshark Lagers.","tippiecanoes","Apr 17, 2014"

3.15,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, light, copper-auburn coloring with a filmy coating of off-white head clinging to the surface. Aromas of roasty caramel and toffee malts that are rich, but balanced. Flavors are smokey and roasted initially, with a sweet, rich caramel backbone that is both tangy and slightly bitter. Sweet, buttery and caramel tangy aftertaste that leads to a slick, sweet, and slightly cloying finish. Not bad for the style, but overly sweet for my tastes. A bit more balance would make this one a great go-to for an Irish Red.","GarthDanielson","Oct 17, 2012"

3.1,-7.7,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Moderate one finger plus head of light tan coloration, evaporates too quickly to really dimple, mostly smaller bubbles, the lacing appears a thin sheet which drifts quickly down the side of the glass. Copperish color to the liquid, very clear with a horde of loose bubbles rising inside, more bright orange around the rims. Pralines, candied nuts, brown sugar, molasses, kind of grapey with date, fig, banana aspects, does have a bit more grains and hoppiness than expected, gives it better posture in the nostrils. Light-bodied, would likely feel flat were it not for the quite aggressive carbonation which keeps it sloshing around the mouth. Here you get a light metallic aspect along with quinine and more indistinct herbaceousness. Not as sweet as the nose would suggest, however, you do get caramel, cane sugar, molasses, bubblegum notes along with Challah bread. The fig, apple, pear fruit basic enough, supplemented by some orange peel. The nuttiness helps flesh out the finish. All in all, not bad for what it is but not something I’d seek out per se.","farrago","Feb 21, 2012"

Nose was much hoppier than I anticipated and now I cannot tell you whether that is good or bad. I like hops, sure, but necessarily in my IPAs. Mouthfeel was full and creamy and I got hops initially on the tongue, but quickly followed by a biscuit maltiness.

Smooth settling left a good bit of side glass lace and a nice and even coating across the top of the glass. Interesting aroma as it started out with a nice and well rounded bready malt that seemed to slowly evolve into a grassy, herbal hop profile with a bit of a kick from the caramel. Did not seem to have a clear direction, but the taste made up for it nicely. Very smooth, nice caramel and malty tones that won me over with ease. Smooth even flavor, crisp, clean and well balanced. Smooth notes of grassy bittering hops coming in at the finish gave it a nice little drying effect and warmed it up. Very drinkable as it went down smooth and left me looking for more right away.","mikesgroove","Mar 19, 2011"

Taste consistent with nose; however, a slightly skunky quality is expressed towards the middle and the metallic character resurfaces at the finish.

The balance of malts and hops is very well executed creating a very satisfying experience from the start to finish of each sip. As the beer warms it does take on a slightly more malty taste.

There is also a hint of bitterness form the hops. It has a medium body and noticeable carbonation. It can be felt on your tongue as you swallow. This is a pretty drinkable beer.

3.34,-0.6,4.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Not a very distinctive beer, but Irish Red isn't really much of a style. Probably too bitter and insufficiently malty - not unpleasant to drink, but nothing exceptional about it.","mpyle","Mar 26, 2009"

3.25,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The initial taste is fresh and shows a surprising hint of hoops and plenty of carbonation. Shortly after, the malt kicks in and unfortunately, so does the metal. The aftertaste is refreshing at first but ultimately turns gritty. This is a reasonably decent interpretation of the style but not overly inspiring. Typical Saranac, really.","daliandragon","Mar 15, 2009"

3.8,13.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, might not be the best Irish Red out there but it's a solid beer that is worth drinking for an evening.","TheManiacalOne","Mar 08, 2009"
3.15,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"The appearance is a translucent deep ruby red with virtually no head. Malts are the key aspet of the aroma followed by something sweet. Medium mouthfeel. The malts were not as evident in the flavor as that of an overripe fruit, weak hops and a dry finish. Adequate.","puboflyons","Mar 07, 2009"
2.59,-22.9,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"D- Drinkable only because it's so bland and watery. This brew is a dud...","JayNH","Mar 06, 2009"
3.33,-0.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"I may have been a little overly harsh with my review, but the fact remains: there was nothing for me here. Most underwhelming micro breweries, including this one, make beers that are definitely drinkable, beers that I probably would have enjoyed a few years ago. As things stand now, however, I'll probably pass.","biegaman","Mar 03, 2009"

4,19,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice deep amber to red in the glass; decent head with some lacing. Malt (lightly roasted) in the nose and in the initial taste. Little hops flavor, though the hint of bitterness helps balance the beer nicely. Great body, perfect carbonation and a nice dry finish make it easy drinking. Enjoyed it a lot. Another winner from Saranac. Happy St. Patty's Day.","tugdriver7","Feb 23, 2009"
3.56,6,4,3,3.5,4,4,"pours a clear deep reddish-brown color w/ a thin off-whitehead which rapidly dissipates leaving a decent lacing in my nonic ; a rather weak smell, some steely, caramelish grain with hints of toasted nuts and a very faint dark fruit presence as it warmed ; taste is very similar to smell, but with a bit more nutty flavor w/ a bvery well-balanced hop-malt flavor, a slightly tart,yet crisp finish ; a light body, dry and very well carbonated ; a very drinkable brew, and much better than most irish reds available..","animal69","Feb 17, 2009"

2.44,-27.4,2,3,2,2,3,"Poured with very little head that dissipated immediately. Has the reddish color I was expecting. Nothing too impressive on the nose; maybe some graininess and some strange sourness as well. Things don't get any better when I take a drink. Some initial sweetness and a tiny bit of bitterness, and then nothing. VERY thin, OK carbonation and a lingering graininess that isn't too pleasant. I live in NY and try and support my local brewers, but this beer isn't very good","curasowa","0"
3.35,-0.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Kinda like training wheels in craft brew, Saranac is great for getting beer drinkers ready for more complex and diverse beer styles. However they tend to keep it pretty safe, which isn't a bad thing. Appears a traditional deep caramel red hue with light beige head forming nicely above the rim of the glass. The head retention is decent and comes complete with minimal scattered lacing. Smell of this brew carries mild metallic qualities witha mineral water like quality. The cereal grains amongst the party carries caramel and biscuity wheaties notes with a touch of herbal hop in the finish. Flavor is mild slightly tart and metallic with a touch of acidity amongs a sweet rolling malt profile. Mouthfeel is light bodied a tad heavier than most michelob ""craft"" styles. Drinkability overall is solid something I would buy due to affordability and quaffabillity definitely falls in the session beer category all adorned with an Irish flag on the six pack holder.","WVbeergeek","Feb 14, 2009"
3.16,-6,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Seeing that this was new I decided to pick up a 6 pack. The brew pours to a nice copper color with a thick off white head that has good retention and has left a nice amount of lacing. The aroma is malt, slight caramel and sweet along with a aroma that seems to come with a majority of Saranac brews, must be from their yeast strand. The flavor is very similar to the aroma, caramel though you do get a toffee note. Besides what was mentioned I am not picking up much more. This is a fair brew from Saranac, good for the price. The one thing that I notice is that I get a lot of the same aromas and flavors from a wide variety of their brews.","Stimack","Feb 14, 2009"
3.56,6,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear copper with a redish hue. Fluffy white head with excellent and laceing. Body is thin and carbonated. Aroma is of sweet malts. Nice but on the weak side. Taste is a mix of sweet malts and fruits. Little bit of spice in the finish. Nice!!","riversider76","Feb 08, 2009"
3.53,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a nice amber color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted scent that boasts of pale and roasted malts. There is a mild hop bitterness as well. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry, crisp flavor that boasts of pale and roasted malts. It's pretty straight forward with a touch of hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinker that pretty close in style. That said, it's not a very interesting beer, but nothing Saranac brews is.","WesWes","Feb 08, 2009"

3.72,10.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"On-tap at Clark's Ale House in Syracuse. Appears a clear orange in my pint glass with an off white head that quickly disappears. This beer is not big on aroma or flavor, but I could drink the hell out of it. All of a sudden I looked down and my glass was half empty. Now I wouldn't call it bland, the flavors are just more subtle than most craft beers. There's a mellow caramel and white bread taste with a hint of spicy hops at the end. I guess this is more a local competitor to Killians - I pick this every time.","tempest","Feb 02, 2009"
3.43,2.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Pours a clear deep copper hue with a soft two finger off-white head that falls to a thin layer which lasts throughout. Nice thick lacing sticks on the sides of the glass. Aroma is heavy on the malts with bread and muted hops. Caramel and crystal malts with some toasted grains as well. Taste starts with some nutty flavors and sweet caramel followed by a slight metallic sting. Midway, watered down dark fruits and chewy grains emerge. Pale malts and dry earth in the aftertaste, better than Killian's, but still lacking on the tongue. Pretty creamy light to medium body with a mild carbonation. This is a session beer that I would have no problem enjoying on St. Patty's day. Hopefully it'll be an option on tap in bars around here come March. At $6 a six-pack, you can't go wrong.","BeerTruth","Jan 26, 2009"
3.68,9.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability: Sessionable and light enough not to be too overwhelming. This roughtly reminds me of a homebrew American-style Amber Ale I've made, in the Fat Tire style.","BWMKappaSig","Jan 26, 2009"
3.39,0.9,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel, while usually my biggest complaint when drinking Saranac, is pretty appropriate for the style. Not too much of a soda-like consistency like with other beers (although I am drining this beer at room temperature while all my other Saranac reviews have been of cold beers). Mostly a medium body that molds well with the hop bitterness and crystal malt flavor. I'm enjoying drinking it. It's not a half bad Irish Red and I'd like to order up a couple of these for my friends on tap if I ever see it.","wiseguy142","Jan 24, 2009"
3.2,-4.8,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Saranac Irish Red Ale is a very clear amber ale with a small off-white head that fades. It has a malty, grassy, slightly sweet, fresh aroma. It's pretty light bodied and very carbonated. It's simple and crisp. It's pretty nicely balanced-- starts a tiny bit sweet, but the finish is dry. This is squarely a session ale.","yesyouam","Jan 18, 2009"
3.68,9.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Let's see, smooth and easy to drink. Obviously a decent session ale. Even with the thin mouthfeel, this would be a decent beer to have a few of. I like it.","Brad007","Jan 18, 2009"
3.7,10.1,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Have to say I was expecting more from this ale. It was definately on the light side of the Irish red ale spectrum. This was very fresh when consumed, but the flavors didn't pop like I thought they would.","kkosmoski","Beers"
3.58,6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Pours a nice mahogany color with a good amount of head and tons of effervescence. Smell is nutty with a touch of caramel notes in there. Taste is very smooth and has a creamy mouthfeel to it. Has a nice body, some nice bready and caramel tastes in there. Finishes clean and is very drinkable. While not spectactular, this Irish Red is well above average.. another solid addition to the Saranac line up.","oriolesfan4","0"
