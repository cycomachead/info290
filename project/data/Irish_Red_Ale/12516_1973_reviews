"Cheers!"
"Odd aftertaste some sort of spice"
"nice Irish Red, again like most of their beers don't really have much access in my area, to bad because its very nice, good ABV around 6 percent and a rich malty flavor with strong hints of caramel and nuts."

"Amber pour with a nice red hue. Very nice head and lasting lacing. Nose is of toast, nut and caramel sweet malt. Light bodied with medium carbonation. The flavor profile is a laid back blend of malt flavors that ends up being nicely complex and balanced. Like the nose, toast, nut and caramel float over a slight sweetness. The finish is smooth and at the end, Goldings are detected. A solid red ale."

"This was a huge surprise to me. A great representation of the style. So simple. So drinkable. A really representation for a traditional great beer."

"Pours murky caramel brown, with a thin 1 finger khaki head that sits for a minute. I like the look of this Irish red more than others I've had. Very earthy aroma with some citrus notes of orange. Also a lot of sweet wheat bread. The sweetness carries over in the taste. Most of the citrus is gone, replaced with caramel and more of that breadyness. Mouthfeel is quite wonderful, very easy to drink, and very thirst quenching on a hot day. I am always weary of this style, not a fan by any means. This however, I like a lot. It does seem more of a American take on a Irish red, but regardless this is a great beer."
"I have found the Thirsty Dog brewery to be somewhat inconsistent, and this beer is certainly one of their better choices. Hop presence is just about absent, but there's plenty of roasted malt, caramel, butterscotch, and nut in the nose and on the tongue. The smell is sweet, and the taste is too, but not as sweet, and that's a good thing. For a beer with a relatively thin mouthfeel and modest ABV for the style, the flavors are bold and the beer is relatively complex. I liked the malt flavors, but I also recognize that the beer could be better with more hops and a bit less sweetness. It goes down easy and the mouthfeel is smooth and not sticky despite the sweetness in the taste, but it's just a touch too thin."

"This isn't bad by any means - I commend Thirsty Dog for taking a style like this and giving it a real dimension. For fans of amber ales and brown ales, check this if it's available to you."

"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of crystal and biscuit malts. It has a sweet caramel aroma with a mild bread-like character. The taste is good. It has a smooth crystal malt sweetness with a dry roasted malt finish. It goes down incredibly easy with tons of malt character, yet only a hint of residual sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good red ale. It appears to be overly complex (aroma), yet it stays in check and drinks well."
"Sweeter flavor than the smell suggests. There's a berry flavor to this brew. Again, there's no notable hop. The body is watery with a high level of fine bubbles (so, it isn't too soda pop-ish)."

"Overall - For the style, a pretty solid beer here. I feel like Irish Red Ales can only be ""so good"" and Thirsty Dog has brewed a good one."
"D- again, not my style, but one of the better ones. Backin the home team, this one is pretty good."

"Was in Cleveland area and the local store had a bunch of Thirsty Dog brews...so I made my own six...if you know what I mean. The Irish Setter poured a clear red amber with sligthly off white head that left some lacing. Mostly malt on the nose with touch of sweetness. The taste carried a caramel malt base with some hop balance. The mouthfeel was light to medium body with good carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer."
"If I try this again and it has improved I'll re-review it."
"I thought this red was highly enjoyable and well crafted. Excellent taste and mouthfeel make this an excellent example of this style. Would be an excellent guzzling choice for St. Patty's Day!!!"
"O: Overall, this is a solid, well made, drinkable beer."
"This one's not bad. One dimensional, but rich and drinkable."
"O: Wish I had a good bottle. This version deserves the low score."
"Overall again I find another great beer from this brewery. It almost makes me want to throw the 4 bucks down to try the Cerberus. Almost..."
"Aroma is of light caramel, roasted nuts, light touches of butterscotch like sugary notes. Warming brings out a very earthy and pronounced flavor to it. Really nice done but a touch light. This is my only complaint as it did not have the pop I was really looking for at the time. Smooth, even flavor really did not deviate much from beginning to end as the overall impact was nicely put together."
"O- A disappointing Irish Ale. A little bland, not overly medicinal tasting but the taste is definitely there. I had this on tap around St. Patrick's Day and while I was not blown away by it, I seem to remember liking it a little more than I did this time."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St Tavern with a slice of pizza. Overall, this was a simple and smooth red ale with a velvety caramel bread character and medium body. It wasn't too thick, like some Irish reds, there was just enough balancing bitterness so the hops weren't too sweet. Just a fine pizza beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear copper/red color with about a half inch off-white head that went away pretty quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is caramel and bready malt. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all malt. I don't notice any hops in either the aroma or taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and easy enough to drink. It's a decent brew, it's not one of the best Irish Red Ales I've had but I still think it's worth a try."
"Pours a dark caramel color burgundy amber brown color with a nicely formed off white tan head, fine speckled lacing scattered evenly. Aroma is roasted malt, caramel amber malts, and a touch of nuttiness. Flavor wise it's clean as far as hops go maybe a bit of underlying earthiness from the low hopped East Kent Goldings. Flavor is full of caramel breadiness all malt not filler here, solid drinking Irish Red. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with even carbonation light drinking complex Irish Red style ale from Akron. Drinkability overall is solid the type of beer that does well for the micro craft community during drunken holidays like St. Paddy's Day."
"Pretty to look at, there's not much taste to this beer. That's not bad if you're looking for a forgettable session beer, but not so much if you want a tasty craft-brew."
"On-tap at Winking Lizard, this was their glass-of-the-month selection. Poured a dark, brick red. A tan ring laced the glass. Smell was rich and malty, with a hint of bitterness. Taste was big and caramely, nicely balanced malty sweetness and a pleasing bitter base. Feel was smooth as a caramel too. Drinks well, a good brew."
"Poured a nice deep amber with an aroma of roasted malt and subtly floral hops. Flavor is a fairly typical but well-executed red ale, full bodied without being heavy with medium dark caramel overtones and a clean hop finish. The mix of interesting but not heavy-handed flavors makes for a very drinkable beer."
"nice firm somewhat caramel malt,finished slightly dry and clean.an easy drinking beer,light bodied mouthfeel.not my favorite style,but still worth a try."
"Well, not a bad beer but lacks compared to some of the bigger, more flavorful beers later on in the tasting rack. Though I'd likely go for a pint of those before this one, it's still not bad as a session beer."
"This is a very nicely crafted beer with just a bit too much caramel malt sense to be considered a top offering. The nose is definitely caramel malt with little else impressing. The look is a reddish amber with an ivory head and decent lacing. There is grain in the finish but little hop sense is noticeable. Creamy with too little carbonation to put crispness in the feel. Good effort and enjoyable, but the style has better representatives - a lot better."
"Light amber ale with noticeable malt flavor. Very red color and sweet carmel aroma. Light carbonation adds to the sweet flavoring. Somewhat lacking in flavor to be memorable though."
"Described as ""medium body with a freshly ground caramel malt flavor with no bitterness.""  That was the problem.  No discernable hopping at all, and the malt was too bland to carry the beer."
