2.54,-19.6,4,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"O- Not good. I hate it when American breweries make a bad product and call it Irish. A slight hint of diacytel is appropriate, not an overwhelming character. It tastes rushed, like they didn't give it adequate time to ferment.","knoxtennessee","May 07, 2012"
3.08,-2.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear medium copper with a tall, creamy eggshell colored head. There are plenty of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates slowly. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are some sweet malts and floral hops in the aroma. I did pick up that medicinal odor a previous reviewer spotted. There's a mild sweet breadiness to the flavor. The hops come through on the back end, but it's not very strong. It's also a bit nutty. There's a bitter aftertaste that sticks to the mouth, but fades quickly. The mouthfeel is light to medium with plenty of carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer. It doesn't really stand out from the crowd, but it's worth a try if you feel like picking up a single.","acevenom","May 02, 2012"

Moderately flavorful hop profile, floral then grassy, sweet malt backbone with light caramel and light nutty and bready qualities. Lighter side of medium bodied, fizzy and watery. Somewhat of a decent surprise, didn't expect any character, but had some nice notes that make it drinkable and preferred over the BMC crap at this particular bar.","rfgetz","Mar 12, 2012"
3.8,20.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Enjoyed from a bottle poured into a pint glass. I think this beer gets an undue average rating.

I think this would be a good beer for someone who is interested in acquiring an affinity for IPAs as it is not quite as hoppy yet still has the essence of an Indian Pale Ale.","jimineycricket20","Beers"

3.33,5.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The alcohol wasn't too high or low here and had it been, it would have added to the slight heavy-handedness of the taste. Thankfully, the carbonation is just right and adds to the mouthfeel, allowing for this beer to go down a bit easier. This would go great with a corned beer sandwich and a viewing of The Quiet Man but for a drinking session, there's a lot more out there that pleases easier. This is only worth a try for die-hard fans of the style.","JerzDevl2000","Jun 25, 2011"
3.74,18.4,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"The most remarkable characteristics for this beer were it's color; which was rich, full, and slightly reddish, and its great balance. It immediately struck me as being very appetizing in its appearance, which featured a thick head along with the nice color. The aroma was not particularly remarkable, but that was OK, because the flavor was full like the hue. It was slightly heavier than I expected in a pale ale, which kept the bitter on the back, allowing the malty side some attention. It was overall very appetizing to the eye and to the taste. I'd buy more.","PierceMyers","Jun 05, 2011"
3.38,7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured out as a red color with a light tan colored head on it. The smell of the beer had a slight sweet malt backbone with just a touch of hop aroma on the nose.

It pours an orange-amber, quite clear, with a short stack o' white sudsy head. The nose is condensed floral hops and toffee, very sweet, with a touch of brown sugar thrown in for flavor. ... How appropriate, .38 Special's ""Caught Up in You"" just started... Think about it. Anyway... The taste comes off as fairly bitter, plenty o' leafy greens for some reason, sorta an ivy-ness, followed by a stiff bit of what is trying to be an assertive caramel-ity. (You come up with these non-existent nouns, you're so smart!) A tiny bit o' that brown shugga (how come it tastes so good?) survives to tell its grandkids about its invasion of the 'strils. The carbonation is moderate, the body a light medium, and, as Natalie Imbruglia's ""Torn"" starts off (you wish you had the eclecticism of my playlist), it goes down pretty smoothly.

Flavor wise, a mix of tart and bitter sweet notes between slightly metallic rusty finish to tart lactic twang. Sweet cereal grains with a touch of caramel and herbal hops in the finish, these flavors do compete more than they are cohesive. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body with ample carbonation, not bad but not what I'm lookin' for.

3.83,21.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer has the ringwood yeastiness, it has some unmistakable dry crystal malts, it is lightly carbonated, there is a bit of diacetyl in the taste as well. It is just a tad prickly in the mouthfeel, and it does have a slightly chicory hint or two. The beer is a bit smooth, not all that creamy, it has a touch, just a touch of leafy hop, to balance out those crystal malts, but not by much. This is a very traditional British style irish ale with a slightly sourish finish. It is quite good, refreshing, light, and hits all the right notes.","albern","May 19, 2009"

I have no desire to try another to see if this was a fluke. Go for a Sam Adams Irish Red for a much more solid beer at a similar price point.","gabe23","Mar 29, 2009"
4.1,29.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Tried this one after drinking the Black lager. Liked this one better, and I usually prefer the ""darker"" beer. So this was a pleasant surprise! Nice reddish/amber color with a soft foam on top. Fairly rich malt in the nose, a touch sweet (in a good way), with a nicely balanced (very mild) hops bitterness. Roasted caramel taste continues and the balance is maintained right down to the end. Little true hops flavor, per se; but it is really unique in that way. Definitely worth trying. Something I'd seek out and buy. Very enjoyable. Thanks, N, for bringing it by.","tugdriver7","Mar 25, 2009"

It has a nice pale and crystal malt scent along with a fruity yeast aroma. It almost smells like English Ringwood yeast. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy witha slight sweetness in the finish. It's medium bodied with a dry aftertaste. This is a quaffable brew, but nothing exceptional.","WesWes","Mar 24, 2009"

Anyway I poured this brew into my glass at 50 degrees. The beer amber colored with a fast decaying head. It had a bitter smell. The taste was interesting in that it tasted a bit like it had cane sugar in it. I liked it and will buy again.","Minkybut","Mar 19, 2009"
3.43,8.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"This beer poured a reddish brown with a big tan head. The smell is lightly toasted malts with some caramel and toffee. The taste is similar to the smell, it starts off with some sweet malts that give way to a tiny bit of hops. A tasty beer, but completely one-dimensional. The mouthfeel is watery with some crisp carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, I wouldn't be surprised if they made a killing selling it on Saint Patty's day.","TheTrevor","Mar 17, 2009"

I mean it isn't offensive by any means, but isn't good at all either. I had a mixed sixer in the fridge and asked my girlfriend to grab me a random one and I tried to guess what it was.. I was able to fathom ""some sort of pale ale I guess"" from the faint hoppiness to it but that was about it. I'd drink it if given for free, but would never purchase this on my own.","oriolesfan4","Jan 09, 2009"
