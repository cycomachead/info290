3.81,2.4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours from a growler, amber red with a thick creamy tawny head. Looks good. Smells earthy and malty, light grain. Very nice mild and inviting. Taste is smooth lightly grainy, lightly bitter. Caramel and biscuits. Very lightly pine. Mouth feel is creamy body is medium light holds together well. This one is mild across the board but with good craft roots clearly visible. Easy drinker but not spectacular.","JackieTH","Dec 12, 2013"

4.85,30.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Man, LOVE beers like this! Served with a huge, foamy, frothy, sudsy, tan head that slowly subsides to a light cover which lasts alll the way down and lots of clingy lace. Color is a slightly hazy, dusky amber red. Aroma is very malty, a hint of roast, fruit, toffee, and biscuit. Flavor's like nose and has a killer combination of sweet, carbonic tang, fruit and bitter from hop, and hint of roasty dry at the end that makes this stuff dangerously tasty. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish is of average length, and like I say, eminently drinkable.","drpimento","Beers"
3.85,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: Nice Irish Red. Not my favorite from TG (can't match their IPAs or Stouts) but it is a nice change, and for a smaller brewery it is good for a deviation from their niche. Plenty of malt and a nice sweetness but not cloying. Overall it is nice but not something I'll crave.","FreshHawk","0"
