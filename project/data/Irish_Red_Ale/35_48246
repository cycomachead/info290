3.8,2.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a deep amber almost red with a decent sized tan head that shows great retention. Smells of malty caramel and toffee with just enough earthy floral hops to make it a Sam Adams beer. The taste is a little sweet and a bit malty with a great Irish Red caramel feel to it. Spicy earthy hops provide some balance to the sweetness. Medium body with a moderate to spirited level of carbonation and a sweet malty mouthfeel. This is a nice Irish Red with a bit of a kick in the hops. I liked it a bit.","johnnnniee","Jun 27, 2012"

This isn't to say we didnt like it. The grain bill was solid, nice hop aroma and flavor, it looked pretty in its glass, it just didn't do much else for me that any other American style ale would do.

The smell was a little worrisome as it was virtually not there, but being in a steak house sort of over whelms the senses so perhaps it had more than the slight maltiness to which I would give it credit.

At both places, the Brick Red (which they said was released Thursday, Feb 26th) was being served. The tour guide described the drink as being similar to the already aptly named Sam Adams Irish Red Ale. From memory, this drink was much darker than the Sam Adams Irish Red Ale (hence the ""brick"" name). A frothy head with some decent lacing was also noticed in both the sample cup and glass I had at Doyles. Aromas of malty spice were noticeable. A sharp malt sweetness was enjoyable prevalent in the drink. Other flavors included hints of hops, toffee and bread wrapped in the roasty crispness of the carbonation. Overall, if you are in the greater Boston area, you should try this up while it lasts.","fitzy84","0"
