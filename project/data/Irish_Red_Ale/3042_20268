My last glass of this tasted slightly sweet, a little malty and metallic. It also had a metallic smell as well. I would stick to the guest beers that are on tap instead of the house brews. They do have a very fine selection of bottles as well.","Robert_Ray","Jul 27, 2013"

3.58,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a reddish color with a small tan head. The aroma is full of toffee with a little bit of caramel mixed in. The flavor is more of the same, with some strong toffee and caramel notes and a little bit of grass and earth from the hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not great, but one of the better year-round beers from BJ's.","Mora2000","Nov 26, 2011"

3.03,-14.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Average in every way. Much sweeter and maltier. Also could be that because the on-tap and growler were tasted on different days, there could have been a difference in the batch characteristics. Regardless of reasons, the growler was very sweet. Too sweet. Not as bitter, not at all like what I have come to expect from ordering this beer on location. I will stick to having in in person from now on and will try a growler of something different.","tbern007","Feb 18, 2010"
2.31,-34.9,3,2,2.5,2.5,2,"This beer really needed a hoppy bite to balance out the sickly sweetness. My wife ordered a pint of this but couldn't finish it because it was so sweet. Completely out of whack.","velkyal","Feb 07, 2010"
3.72,4.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Red highlights with a brown body served with a creamy beige head of about a quarter inch. Streaming bubbles keep it that way. The nose is a bit light, but biscuity sweet malt, lightly toasted. The flavor is again highly malty, with slight notes of toffee along with the toast. Lightly sour and puckering, minimal hops. Highly carbonated, but decently fun.","BretSikkink","Feb 21, 2009"
3.58,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"On-tap at Chandler location. This is occasionally put on the weekly cask offering. Lots of malt. Reddish highlights, white creamy head, lace. Mild malta roma. Above avrage mouthfeel from the malts, a touch of sour and a touch like an old ale. Too much carbonation to drink pints of it, still enough malt complexity to make it interesting.","Sammy","Feb 17, 2009"
2.68,-24.5,3,2.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Poured a ruby brown in color with no head. Smell is all malt and a little off. Taste is much the same. Not sure what the flavor is, but it strikes me as a bit stale. Like cheap malts were used in the production of this beer. This strikes me as rather close to your basic BMC. Not much going on here. Smooth, but tough to finish. Not very enjoyable, I'll move on.","FtownThrowDown","Dec 05, 2008"
2.99,-15.8,4.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Smooth earthy and peat flavors are dominating in this brew along with sweet and toasty malts. Has a mild hop bite on the finish. Candy-esque sweetness is a bit annoying and the alcohol feel is a bit raw, but a decently enjoyable beer that I would not mind drinking again one of these days.","twiggamortis420","Aug 27, 2008"
2.94,-17.2,4,2.5,3,3,3,"This is the one BJ's pimps as their award-winner. Pours a bright copper with a medium white head. Malty, fruity aroma as advertised, with some caramel. Sharp taste with earthy hops. Decent malt backbone. Bitter, but not in a really good way. They have better beers than this on tap.","magictrokini","Aug 17, 2008"
3.08,-13.2,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,"Sampled this on 4/23/08. This is a pretty good beer. Reddish-amber color topped with a thin off-white head and some spotty lacing. Roasted malty flavor with some caramel in there. It seemed slightly off balanced with a finish that was a bit stale but overall it was solid and I liked it.","changeup45","Jun 16, 2008"

3.75,5.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Smooth and easy to drink, but the sweetness and the alcohol put a limit on that factor.","HalfFull","Nov 06, 2007"
3.36,-5.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Clear Orangish red pour. Smell is sweet and malty with hints of apple juice. Taste is similar with sweet apple like malt flavors, and a touch of balancing hops. Still thin overall, but not excessively so. Very friendly, drinkable, and the alcohol was hidden well. Nice beer, and one of my favorites here.","JDV","Oct 05, 2007"
3.92,10.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"As one would expect a sangrineous color, the head portly and the consistency spumescent, tan in color and the residual lace a nice sealing sheet. Nose is sweetly malt, fresh and clean with a malt-laden start, top middling in its feel. Finnish is mildly acidic, the hops apropos to the style, dry lingering aftertaste.","Gusler","Sep 16, 2007"
3.5,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sample at the Columbus location. This brew is a reddish-brown color with a medium beige head that lasts pretty well. Patchy lacing. Sweet malt and nuts in the nose. Medium-bodied with a sweet malt character throughout, along with light roasted nut and hops flavors. The finish is hoppy and nutty. Overall this is not too bad.","Dogbrick","Jul 31, 2007"
3.38,-4.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It really doesn't taste like a red ale (not particularly hoppy), but this is probably my favorite of the BJ beer offerings. Big copper/orangeish pour with a white foamy head. Smells malty ... and tastes ... malty. Some hop overtones, but certainly nothing overwhelming. Somewhat complex taste and mouthfeel. Goes well with buffalo wings.","Overlord","May 12, 2007"
3.18,-10.4,4,3.5,3,3,3,"On tap at the Rancho Cucamonga, CA location. A sort of imperial red ale. Pours red, head is off white, foamy, not too durable. The smell is subdued, but it is malty. The taste very malty. Hops don't contribute much to this beer. Starts with semi-sweet malt, and then finishes spicy. There may be some very faint smokiness thrown in there too. It's mainly a malty high alcohol soup. The alcohol is definitely detectable, probably giving off the spiciness, and creates a really viscous mouthfeel. I wouldn't drink this beer again. It's not really my style.","MiScusi","Beers"
3.03,-14.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Drinkability- I tend to prefer more flavoring and aroma hops in my red ales, but I'm a major hop-head.","theopholis","0"
3.58,0.8,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"This was a pretty good beer, I was expecting a red ale, but I think I would put this more in the strong ale category without the big alcohol content.","BradBLR","Oct 11, 2004"
3.8,7,4,4,4,3,3.5,"This beer is an interesting concept, at least I am intrigued by the description. Take an uninteresting Irish Red and double the recipe to give it some character. This beer sits a full red color in my glass and is topped by a pale tan color head that is pretty long lasting. The aroma is malt dominated with notes of caramel, a fruitiness that reminds me of cherries, and some toasted malt notes. The beer tastes sweet and malty with lots of fruity notes as well. I get notes of strawberry, cherry, caramel, and biscuits with a nice honey glaze. There is a bit of bitterness in the finish, which seems to make a feeble attempt at holding the yeasty fruitiness and solid malt notes in check (this is certainly not a bad thing either). I am really struck by how fruity this beer is, there is also a palate coating fullness to it that slowly melts to an herbal hoppy bitterness in the finish. Quite nice, really lives up to the verbal description.","Gueuzedude","Beers"
3.66,3.1,4,3,4,4,3.5,"This "Irish style strong ale" poured a dark, red-amber color with creamy, tan foam that settled. The smell was mild: malty with a hint of alcohol and a touch of cocoa. The taste was malty with notes of caramel malt and a very light sweetness. The hops were mild. A note of alcohol could be detected. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with med-full body and moderate carbonation. There was a slight bitterness in the finish, and overall this beer was warming. This was a pretty good red ale.","UncleJimbo","0"
