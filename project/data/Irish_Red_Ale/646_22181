3.58,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 1/31/2015. Pours fairly crystal clear ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, pear, apple, raisin, brown bread, brown sugar, light roast, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, yeast ester, and earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of caramel, toast, roasted malt, pear, apple, raisin, brown bread, brown sugar, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, roast, pear, apple, brown bread, brown sugar, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice balance and solid robustness of bready/roasted malt and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.3%. Overall this is a solid Irish red ale. Good balance and solid robustness of malt, yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 17, 2014"

The nose comprises buttery biscuit, a touch of mandarin orange syrup, and a sprinkling of cilantro in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, though the orange-like qualities come to the fore, sorta creating a candied orange peel kind of flavor. Some added toffee helps this effect along. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, an alright red, but not one that I would ever really seek out again.

There's a big toffee note in the beginning of the beer but it's chased away by more smoked malt character in the finish. Taste is somewhat sweet. There's no real hop character to speak of.

Clean amber color with a little more brown than orange, excellent clarity and vividness. Bready nose with caramel, chocolate fudge, sugar cane and a hint of golden raisin and date alongside the pear, apple scents, the hops come across as mixed drink bitters with a pinch of green field grasses. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has an aggressiveness which comes out of left field, churns things up and favors the bitter, grassy element as well as sour grapefruit, lemon citrus. The maltiness more of a powdery texture here, hence less sweetness in the cocoa, milk chocolate, hard toffee flavors. Some raisin left, more green apple, bosc pear, apricot pit. Flash of cloves. Astringency and overall dryness builds through the finish. Curiously, the breadiness more or less absent. Interesting beer, throws a fair amount of curveballs.","farrago","Mar 16, 2010"

Odors of cooked caramel and malt were detected, along with a slight touch of herbs and earthiness. An unexpected change from other red ale, this brew has far more depth and complexity. Flavors of malt, oats, tea and sweetness were detected, with a slightly dry finish. This is a different kind of red ale, i'm sure it's not for everyone or good as an everyday brew, but for what it is, it's good. Worth a try, but have an open mind and no preconceptions as to what to expect.","Frozensoul327","Mar 16, 2005"
3.26,-8.2,4,3,3.5,3,3,"From notes. Sampled at our pint night a few weeks ago. The beer poured a deep mahogany color with 1 finger of head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was slight caramel and slight roasted. Not anything special. The flavor was a little better than the nose, with a bitter roasted tone with slight sweet caramel behind it. The feel was light, almost watery. Overall, pretty average here. I'll take their stout any day over this one.","kmpitz2","Feb 22, 2005"

3.6,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"New arrival at the Richmond Road location of the Liquor Barn, in Lexington, Ky. This 330 ml(11.2 oz) bottle pours a clear copper body with a one inch head that is tinted between offwhite and beige. The head quickly falls to a film, leaving some patchy lace on the glass. Aroma is mostly spicy herbal hops, with a slightly sweetish pale malt background. Mouthfeel is light bodied with prickly carbonation. Taste begins with some biscuity pale malt sweetness that is quickly subdued by an herbal/floral hops bitterness. The mild hops bitterness rides through to the finish. Crisp and refreshing, and pleasantly drinakble. Not quite as good as a Smithwicks, but in the same league.","merlin48","0"
