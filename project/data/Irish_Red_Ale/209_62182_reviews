"Interesting Ruby Brown Color.Reminiscent of a church window . Poured With a solid inch of head, but dissipated quickly.Thick band of lacing falls down the glass. Very sweet smelling like an orchard with lovely hints of hops coming through. Very light and smooth in the mouth. Give it a second and the roasted malt really comes through on the back of the tongue."
"O: Overall easy flavor, a bit light, good drinkability at a low alcohol rate. Soft fruitiness, sweet with a light wet fresh wet roastiness that won't fill you up. Okay."

"       I'll choose to give Smithwick's Superior Irish Ale - Guinness Ltd. a 4.5 overall."
"Smithwick's Superior Irish Ale brewed by  Guinness Ltd, with an ABV of 4.5%  This ale pours out a nice light brown color with a nice off white head. Superior Irish Ale has the look of sweet tea.  The smell is sweet, with grain, and malts. You pick up on a hit of hops in the smell.  The smell is rich and inviting. I really like the smell of this brew. Now for the taste, it sweet with some grains and malts. There is a lot going on in this brew. Smithwick's Superior Irish Ale, has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about it. The mouthfeel is rich , with flavor, but has a smooth aftertaste.  This brew is a nice, smooth drinking brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out 5. I would buy this brew again."

"This a good beer for all occasions. It is not the fullest flavored beer, nor is it overly distinct. However it is flavorful, smooth, and refreshing. It is one of my standard beers."

"Not an easy style to find around MN, so I picked a bottle of this up in a mix-six.  Huge khaki head, dark red color, fairly clear.  Toasty malts and some faint floral hops on the nose.  Taste follows the nose, with a nice mellow, slightly sweet, and quite dry finish; smooth and creamy mouthful.  A very faint metallic mineral note toward the end, too...if it came out more clearly as, say, herbal or medicinal, that would be interesting, but as is, it isn't pleasing.  Except for that, this is pretty nice for the style, though it could be much more full bodied.  Would be interested to give this a go on cask."

"Starts with a hint of caramel which gives way to the bitterness of the hops. Full flavored but not heavy. Very drinkable!"

"Overall â€“ Not bad at all. It may be an Irish red but the bitter edge means that this one has a lot in common with an English bitter. Not as nice as Kilkenny but still a reasonable drink by most standards."

"The feel is about spot-on, herbal and mineral notes showing up in a semi-dry body as sweetness works to tone down the hard water element. It's crisp all the way and fairly smooth but boring. A session ale for sure."

"What a good looking beer. Huge off white head that leaves tons of lace everywhere. Slow fade leaves a nice covering. Smell is a bit of a letdown. I have to swirl the glass to get the malts to show. When I do I get light caramel and toasted grains. Grassy hops, floral notes, and grain husk. Taste starts with typical Irish red profile of a malt front, flowing into a mineral based tanginess. Malt is a bit light but offers up lightly toasted grains and whole grain bread crust. Some mild nuttiness. Hops are earthly and mild. Dry mildly astringent make for a clean finish with a tea like trace on lingering. Feel is somewhat substantive with enough weight to keep it from the watery grave that has found Harp. A coarsely creamy carbonation make it an enjoyable swallow. A decent brew but it had lost its way like Harp. It has suffered less but nonetheless has turned into a shadow of the full bodied ale it once was. Having said that it still has something to offer and is a step up from the BMC crowd."

"Overall: An okay Irish red ale. Certainly would have it again but if I have other choices this would probably be passed up."

"A very drinkable ale that satisfies without a lot of bells-and-whistles. Lightly malty without any big hop presence, it is still balanced across the taste and mouthfeel spectrums. Mild yet pleasingly satisfying in a low-key manner."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a half finger ivory head that dissipates to a thin film leaving light lacing. Light aroma of caramel malt, mild nuts; slightly spicy. Flavor of sweet malt, mild nuttiness, light fruit juice; finishes with light caramel malt and mild grassy hops. Medium bodied. A low key, pleasant Irish red. Better than I had expected, but not exceptional. The sweet malt is reminiscent of mass produced lagers, but this has the appropriate fruit flavors and the noted light nuttiness to give it character. Average, but pleasant to drink."

"Pours a tawny copper color with a decent sized long lasting off white head that leaves decent lace on the glass. Smells a bit of sulfury mineral water with a bit of caramel and toffee aromas rounding out the nose. The flavor is rich and malty with a light sweet brown sugar and caramel offset with a hint of buttery bitter toffee and earthy mineral water. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet lingering mouthfeel. Feels more like a macro lager than and Irish ale, but the richer darker malts keep me a little bit interested."

"500mL can, pours deep red in color with a persistent ivory head. Aromas are sweet toasted grain, herbal hop, caramel. Tastes are sweet, toasty, caramel, toffee, herbal hop and a dry finish. Mouth-feel is creamy and smooth, medium-ish body. Overall, good representation of the style. Nothing fancy here, but very drinkable and sessionable."

"Poured from a 14.9 oz. can. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, a bit of malts. Taste is malty, some sweetness, a bit of toffee, smooth and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer but nothing special."

"A light beer, and a bit boring-"

"Overall, one to seek out in Ireland if the temperature gets above 18."
"OVERALL: A real old man's drink. If I wasn't in South Korea I wouldn't have bothered with this but I was in the mood for something mellow and this fitted the bill. A perfectly drinkable average beer."
""
"O- The perfect example of what a session beer should be. Not complex or super-flavourful, just highly drinkable and perfectly balanced. Worth a try if you are able to find it"
""
"This beer will satisfy fans of Irish reds, but Irish stout-lovers needn't reach for it too often."
