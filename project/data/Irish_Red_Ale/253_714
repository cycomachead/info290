3.59,-5.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Ran into this at Jameson's Tavern in Freeport, ME. It had a light clear copper color with very little white head that disappeared leaving no discernable lacing. The aroma is cider malt mash and light grass hops. The flavor is lemony hopped malt with lots of caramel cardboard. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied, a bit limp in feel. Fairly drinkable but not great enough to warrant more than a couple I think.","Durge","Apr 25, 2010"

4.24,11.6,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured with a very small, off-white head. Body is mostly clear with a trace of haziness, and a dark amber color. Good aroma... average maltiness present, some caramel, and light yeast. Great on the palate: smooth, medium-body with a creamy texture; soft carbonation. Progresses well to the terrific flavor: caramel and malt, nice and creamy, with a medium-duration finish. The beer does not look like anything special, but it's easiest one of the best Irish Reds I've tasted... could drink this all day for sure.","berley31","Jun 22, 2009"
4.16,9.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Very nice flavor. A lot more dry and bitter hops than I expected. Malt sweetness balances things somewhat, though the finish is definitely dry. Woody and biscuity.

3.93,3.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"A well-balanced cacophony of malts and hops greet the the palate and ride out smoothly. Bitterness is kept at a moderate level, allowing some fruitier flavors to develop like red grapes and sour apple. The maltiness is slightly sweet and suggests caramel and toasted grains, while the hops assert themselves mostly on the finish as they chime in with a fresh greenery of resin and floral notes. Body is on the lighter side of medium, and the active carbonation level turns the creamy mouthfeel into a zesty, popping finish. All in all, a very flavorful, very well-crafted Irish Red that I would be happy to try again. Nice job Casco Bay!","wagenvolks","May 31, 2009"
3.87,1.8,3,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Very thick mouthfeel -- a nice substantial beer. A good amount of carbonation, but feels about right with the heavy-ish body.

4.24,11.6,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Out of a bottle this beer was a nice mahogany color with great clarity. The head was a thin skim of khaki foam that did not retain well. The lacing was equally un-impressive. The aroma was a good blend of a semi-sweet, lightly fruity malt, hints of roasted malt and some hop bitterness. The flavors were at first a flash of sweetness that then became more roasted malt before going into a pleasant bitterness, hints of wood and a long roasted malt finish. Yum! The body was medium, the carbonation perfect and the mouthfeel quite good for the style. A very enjoyable beer and it would be top-class if only it looked a little better.","thekevlarkid","Jan 07, 2009"
3.85,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Another Mainer from the BOTMC. Very malty with trace hops on the smell. Some butterscotch, some peanut brittle. Pours to a deep amber with a thin tan head. Taste is malty throughout with a little bitterness starting in the middle, becoming a little more predominant in the the end then fading away to a malty finish with only hints of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very viscous with the carbonation perfect to enjoy the flavor of this brew. This is an excellent ale, not to mention, amber ale. Good flavor complexity, not a constant balance throughout but a flip-flopping between bitter and sweet. I will have to get more to keep on hand.","mooseisloose","Nov 21, 2008"

The palate is firmly malt-driven, with a crisp biscuity toastiness backed by some sweet caramel, just like the aroma implies. Bitterness is moderate and hop flavor undetectable, but this beer is mainly about the malt so it hardly matters. Neutral yeast character as well.

It tastes of deep roasted malts as a nice base layered with an excellent sweet fruity taste, perhaps of apples but the bottle says peaches, then finished with a nice citrisy hop bitterness.

3.91,2.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A very nice red. Color is spot on and it sustains a nice cap but leaves little lacing. Smells of piney hops layered over a good malt driven beer. It taste is a little bready but a good malt character with little sweetness and nice cutting hops to keep it interesting. A good red and a great local thing to have, I just don't live in Maine, but if I did this would be a sesion beer for me. Easy body for sipping or slamming.","Higravity","Dec 28, 2005"
3.59,-5.5,2,3,4,3.5,4,"Rip Tide Red poured a cloudy but distinct red color. The cloudy is a sign this beer has not had the yeast filtered out, that's good; the grain husks from the mash that poured from the bottle with the beer was a little sloppy on the part of the brewery though. The smell was light and had caramel notes with not much hop aroma. The taste was pleasant and light with a malt base, a slight caramel aftertaste, and a pleasant hop character. The mouthfeel was good, not too light but not heavy. Very drinkable and worth a try, I do not know if I would buy this by the case, but it is a good beer.","DevilDogBeer","Dec 01, 2005"

3.85,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Casco Bay's Riptide Ale has a medium froathy head that seemed to stay in the pitcher for most of the session, with a nice golden brown color. The color seems to seperate towards the bottom. The smell is a nice mixture of sweet malts and hops with a fruity aromatic smell. The taste was nice, mellow hops with a smooth aftertaste. The red ale is full of flavor. It hits the back of the tongue and has some nice bitters in the aftertaste, however the bitters disapate quickly. Not as rich as some other Irish Red Ales, but definately a good choice.","HoorayBeer","Jul 08, 2005"

The mouth is left with a slight grainy dryness that leaves the mouth crisp and refreshed. A nice Irish red indeed. Drinkability holds up well anytime.","chilidog","Feb 14, 2005"
3.11,-18.2,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours with a two-finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Hoppy nose. Starts as a mix of malt and hops but finishes hoppy with a hoppy aftertaste. The brewer says ""5 different malts and 3 hop varietals, carefully blended, results in a perfect balance"". But the hops dominate. $1.35 for a 12 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA.","jdhilt","Feb 08, 2005"

The smell is very balanced with lots of sweet maltiness and a great dose of hops. Very pleasant. The taste is malty at first and fairly sweet. A little bit of tart cherry tones down the sweetness in the middle. The finish is nice and hoppy. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth for a red ale. The drinkability is great.

Nose is dominated by the sweet malt, crisp and clean to the senses, start is slightly sweet, a decent malt profile with the top light to medium in feel.

Aromas are surprisingly hoppy (always a nice thing for this hop-head). There's a mixture of floral and grassy hops mixed in with some brown sugar sweetness. Flavor, too, was hoppy. Nice dose of malty sweetness keeps this one in check. What was most interesting with this was the pronounced chocolate flavor that came in at the end. Not too over-malted and that is a great thing. Very smooth mouthfeel and aftertaste is a dollop of chocolate on your tongue. Quite tasty and one that I'd seek out again.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jun 15, 2004"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"On tap at the GLB. What better place to sample a fresh Maine beer. Medium amber-reddish color. More red than brown in color. Glowing shiny color, nice bubbly beige head. Medium carmel malt smells, sweet candy smells. Taste was full of rich sweet carmel taste. Candy, and a slight bitter snap to finish. Hops were way in the back and very sublte. All about a nice smooth malty sweetness here. However, there was no feeling of slick sweetness or aritificial amber ale tastes that are so common for the style. Medium to full bodied, this would compliment a lobsta or serve as a nice autumn treat. Right up there with the Rogue American Amber in my opinion.","StevieW","Sep 11, 2003"

As the tan head receded, I took a sip and discovered a smokey citrus taste, like a pink grapefruit aged in an oak cask. It's a different and intriguing brew. A third sip, and I'm still working on describing the aftertaste: just a bit bitter, but not distressingly so. A good brew: I recommend it.","longpondbeerman","Aug 04, 2003"

4.08,7.4,4,3.5,4,4,5,"Clear light ruby hue. Vanilla white, thin, spotty head leaves tattered lace. Mild citrus and lightly perfumed hop nose along with dark lovibond caramel malt with a roasted tinge in aroma. Sweet biscuit and mild toffee initially in flavor gently gives way to slowly augmenting hop bitterness and a snap of roasted barley sharpness. Mid palate hop bitterness becomes assertive when coupled with the apparently minerally, perhaps sulfate rich, water and facilitates a concomintantly thirst quenching and inducing nature. (Maybe this is what MJ means by hop bitterness being ""moreish"") Light in body, but crisp and relatively soft on the palte. Understated red currant like fruit esters surface late along with mellow, sweetish biscuit. Finishes clean and dry, with hints of toasty Munich. A well balanced, flavorful red ale with excellent drinkability. RipTide certainly has more overall character than the norm for the typically insipid style.

The initial taste seems to emphasize the malt characteristics of the product while the finish places more emphasis on the hops. Smooth mouthfeel and pleasant and lingering aftertaste. I would expect that this might become Casco Bay's flagship product despite the brewery's highly acclaimed (and justifiably so) Pilsener. Wish it were available in NH.","Greenlabel","May 16, 2003"
4.32,13.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured into the glass amber in color with a slight red highlight. It was slightly opaque and fairly well carbonated. The head that was produced was a medium beige/tan color that was thick and creamy, some chunky parts mixed in the foam, and seemed to last fairly well. The lace that it produced stared off as sticky sheets then slid right into a decent lace that was sparse in some areas and chunky in others. The aromas that came from the glass were strong at points and slight in others. I nosed floral hops, sweet malts, chocolate, citrus, fruit, roasted malt, coconut, nuts and some bread. Surprisingly complex and diverse aromas from this beer. The tastes that flowed over my tongue were of bitter hops, flowers, roasted malt, bitter chocolate, creamy chocolate, earth tones, biscuits, and a slight alcohol warmth at the end, and it left a slight hop flavor in the aftertaste. It was medium to full bodied. The warmer this beer got, the more the flavors and aromas increased. A good beer and very drinkable, I would get again.","Jarod","May 01, 2003"
4.47,17.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Not my first, and certainly not my last... A slightly hazy, deep amber body is capped by a frothy ivory head that drops shortly to a creamy collar and light surface foam. It holds well and leaves some thin, transient lace throughout the pint. Bold floral hops welcome you; and a sweet, biscuity maltiness becomes apparent with a little more nosing around. It's medium/full body combines with a fine and moderate carbonation to leave it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor is rich without being overbearing. It's biscuity and gently caramelish malt provides a perfect counterbalance to its vibrant citrusy and mildly resinous hop flavor. A solid bitterness anchors it without distracting. It finishes with some dry maltiness and a ghost of its hop flavor before fading into a lingering, mild bitterness. Refreshing and fulfilling! A clean, exceptionally well-balanced, and highly drinkable beer! Very nicely done and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Apr 08, 2003"
