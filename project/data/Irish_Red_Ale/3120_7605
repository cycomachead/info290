Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and slight fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, burnt sugar, caramel, and earth flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid toast and caramel qualities that come through slightly better in the taste to me.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 28, 2014"

This Irish red ale is malt-forward, never extreme, and just what one might expect from one of Alpine's less abundantly-hopped beers. It pairs well with a variety of food flavors, reminding at times of New Belgium's ubiquitous Fat Tire--but with less overbearing biscuit flavor than that other beer.","beagle75","Sep 11, 2010"

Lighter amber red color with orange rims and glass bottom, damn close to fully transparent, widespread bubbles quickly kick upwards. The nose is fairly airy and light with a soft malty, caramel, molasses, honey, cocoa and pie flake core, not that sweet but sweet enough red cherry, grape, apricot, apple, pear fruit scents to outweigh the grass, hay component, citrus stays in the background, the stuff is there to be more appealing, however, simply isn't clearly keen on taking many steps to please. Medium-bodied and on the soft side, an amiable jiggle and ""more to love"" going on, still the carbonation tries to add more precision and leanness, if ultimately failing. Good deal of cocoa, milk chocolate powder with caramel mixed in, powdery texture yet sweet. The lemon, orange citrus is tart and lacks the zest to persist to the end. Bready, more towards rye or maybe pumpernickel than whiter dough. Faint metallic earthy ring. Tenuous apricot, peach, nectarine, apple fruit.

3.37,-7.4,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Bottle, home. This beer is okay, but it's a disappointment coming from Alpine. This beer is bright orange rust in color with a small dissipating head, white. The aroma is a nice mix of malt flavors. It's hard to pick out too many individual malt notes because the caramel dominates, but chocolate and a touch of fruit peak out. Hops are almost nonexistent. The flavor is the real downer. It starts out almost rich and sweet with malt flavors but that quickly fades into an odd mess of sickly sweet and off-kilter light roast bitterness. The mouthfeel is also odd and not so great. I wish that this beer had a bit more hops or a bit more direction with the malt. It's not bad or anything, but this isn't a direction that I particularly like. All that said, I still firmly believe that Alpine is awesome.","popery","Feb 14, 2010"

3.5,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured out clear deep copper with thin off white head. The aroma has sweet malty caramel and lightly roasted malts along with a light smattering of hops. The flavor is much like the aroma with sweet caramelized malts, roasted malts and light hints of vague hoppiness. It ends with less sweet roasted malts. Nice malty brew.","hophead247","Jan 19, 2010"
3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a dark amber with a nice double-finger head. Some nice lacing as I work my way through the glass. The smell is of sweet malt, and is fairly complex, as is often the style with a good Irish Red Ale. The taste is all malt, with only the faintest hint of hop bitterness. I can definitely see the insane number of different malts in this, as the taste is fairly complex. Nice and medium-bodied and very drinkable, especially for a style that's not one of my favorites.","Thorpe429","Oct 17, 2009"
3.79,4.1,4.5,3,4,4,4,"Overall it is a tasty beer. Better than alot of reds I have had but for sure not the best. I wouldn't seek it out unless Reds are your style but it is a good beer to grab if you see it.","PeprSprYoFace","Oct 11, 2009"
3.87,6.3,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Notes: This is a solid Irish Red that left a good impression on me. It's got a good nose, flavor, and mouthfeel that comes together to make this beer quite drinkable, but not necessarily sessionable for me because of its sweet nature. You can tell the guys at Alpine know what the hell they're doing! Very solid","sweetbrew82","Apr 05, 2009"
4.53,24.5,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"D- Although not a session beer in my opinion, I could drink a couple of these babies over a couple of hours. Truly, this is a new favorite of mine from Alpine. Good work guys!","ETF5000","Mar 30, 2009"
3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a deep red amber color with a fast falling off-white head. Minimal lacing and not a lot of retention. You can smell the caramel malts, a bit of toast, and a slight trace of floral hops. Not really an Irish Red, more like a hoppy American Amber. Had a sweet malty front with a subtle hop bitterness. A medium bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation. A decent beer but not really an Irish Red.","bigbelcher","Feb 03, 2009"
3.98,9.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This one took me by surprise a bit. Nicely flavored for an Irish Red and the drinkibility was right on! I didn't get to drink any ""Irish"" beers the day before on St. Patties Day, so this was a nice belated pint to celebrate with.","Kegatron","Jan 12, 2009"
3.53,-3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: A good beer, I really liked the flavour initially, but over the whole 22 oz. the sweetness did become cloying and hard to drink at times. Still looking at the overall picture, it was a nice pint. Glad to try it. A bit more hop character would have helped for sure.","Halcyondays","Nov 10, 2008"
3.95,8.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Taste confirms my suspicions and offers a welcome light yet complex malt flavor. Roasty up front, segueing to a clean finish and a dry aftertaste. Hop bitterness is less than anticipated given the nose. Offers a good carbonation level which fits the beer well. Drinkability is above average for the style due to the relative lightness of the malts. A nice Irish Red that doesn't smother things with excessive malt notes.","HalfFull","Oct 02, 2008"

3.85,5.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. Pours a pretty dark but clear red, with lots of streams of carbonation present. The overall impression here is it's more of a toasty brew, less smooth but more flavorful than other macro irish red's I've had. There is a distinct hop bitterness in the finish making it feel somewhat harsh. It was ok though, a good compliment to a pepperoni pizza.","MiScusi","Jun 20, 2007"
3.98,9.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Other than Mandarin Nectar (which is okay), I have been supremely impressed by Alpine beer. Pure Hoppiness is one of the best DIPAs that I've ever had and Alpine Ale is a damn fine APA. McIlhenny's Irish Red may not be in their league, but it's a well-brewed version of the style and would be my choice for St. Patrick's Day if I lived in Southern California.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 17, 2007"

3.04,-16.5,4,2.5,3,4,3,"Got this beer from metallitone1 in Bday '07 and I'm drinking it on St. Pats day. It pours a brilliant dark amber red and is crystal clear. Not much to speak of in terms of aroma, mostly light caramel and dark fruits. The taste is pretty tame. Nothing really stands out here to grab my attention. The body is good but the flavor is weak. What is there is some caramel sweetness and malt. This would be a decent session beer, but I've been more into bolder beers lately.","drseamus","0"

A very nice Red and a good solid drinking partner.","TheLongBeachBum","Apr 02, 2003"

3,-17.6,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer as it sets in my glass a limpid mahogany color, the head average in size, frothy in texture. Light tan in color and the lace a decent covering upon the glass. Malt dominates the nose, fresh and clean, sweet as it the malt-laden start; top is skimpy in feel. Finish is lightly carbonated, the hops present and mild in their bite, dry aftertaste, average beer, drinkable and pleasant enough when your into something on the lighter side.","Gusler","Beers"
3.01,-17.3,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Nice dark plummy red brown but the head is licaking. The aroma is malty, a bit roasty but little else. The flavor is more roasty than expected with a light sweetness. Not a lot of complexity except for a little melon, and really low hopping. Of course, low hopping makes sense for the style, but the lack of fruitiness doesn't. Boring but not bad.","aracauna","0"
