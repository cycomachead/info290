I enjoy the clear, red-amber pour, the malty sweetness and it's slight bitter taste. (I'm not a fan of sweet-tasting brews.) It's light-bodied enough to be a regular brew for me and anyone that likes ales, especially if you can find it on tap. I've also tried the bottles but definitely prefer a correct temperature pour on draught.","Capt_Pete","Mar 18, 2015"

3.58,11.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/29/2013. Pours slightly cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor balance and solid complexity of bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light hop flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very solid Irish red ale. Nice balance and solid robustness of bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 25, 2014"

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and a slight hop aroma. Taste is much the same with a toasted bread flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is nothing all that special, but it is solid and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","0"

3.71,15.6,4,3,4,3.5,4,"12 oz. bottle, contract-brewed by Heineken. The beer is a crystal-clear light amber, with medium carbonation, and a three finger tan head that I can tease above the rim of the glass - as the head settles it forms pits and peaks, and delivers nice lacing. Pretty simple in the nose, with grains, adjuncts?, a dash of hops, and some sweetness. Quite clean on the palate, with caramel and toasted malts providing the base, upon which skunky/spicy and grassy hops build a fairly pronounced hop edge; tastes more like a lager than an ale due to the cleanliness. The body is lightish, dry and smooth, with medium carbonation and some lingering hop oils that add to its medium finish. Overall a good go-to beer that is tasty and easy-drinking.","mmmbeer","Jan 13, 2008"

Not like the nicely scented Dial but of plain, scent free, cheap, bought it at Aldi's hand soap. Taste is slightly sweet and creamy not much else.

As you drink some more, it is slightly malty with a hops bittering finish like a lager. Mouthfeel ok, I didnt see it as too thin. Drinkability is fairly good.

Perhaps it is the macro brewing techniques surely used by Heineken that drain character from this beer. I would call it overly crisp for a red, not enough rawness to the characteristics. It has the distinct bittersweet malt notes of a red yet they seem to float around in a watery texture. Endnotes are just a fade out of earlier flavors with mundane hop bitterness. A highly macronized red beer, I guess it lost its characterization somewhere in the process of macronizing.","Cadyfatcat","0"

3.38,5.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear reddish amber color with a bubbly white head that fades into a nice amount of lace. Nose is sweet malts and is a bit earthy and musty. Taste is lightly toasted sweet malts with a bit of caramel and a slick, oily hop finish. A nice if unremarkable brew. I have some fond memories of sitting at a bar and drinking these all day long one St. Pattys Day many years ago.","Morris729","Nov 01, 2002"
3.2,-0.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"A somewhat hazy deep amber color on the pour with a pleasant sized head and oodles of fine lace. The nose is mostly malt, lightly sweet and pleasing to the senses. Start is malt and sweet, the top middling and the finish nicely carbonated with a modest but pleasant hop bite and the typical dry lingering aftertaste, quite good in its own right, but give me the draught version, which is becoming quite scarce here in Arizona.","Gusler","Aug 31, 2002"
3.18,-0.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Reddish-brown in color with a thick off-white head that lingers well after the pour.  Lots of broken lace with slight carbonation.  Fairly strong aroma of toasted malt with some earthy character as well.  Taste begins with rich, slightly sweet toasted malts, little in the way of hops, finishes with mild earthy flavors.  A decent, but unremarkable amber.","Pegasus","Aug 12, 2002"
3.6,12.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a nice deep copper / golden color, with a nice white head. On the nose there is a decent sweet malt aroma. On the palate decent malt flavor, touch of caramel in there, very drinkable brew. Lacks a well rounded flavor, but good malt character and very drinkable.","WilliamPhilaPa","Jul 21, 2002"
3,-6.5,3,3,3,2,3.5,"An American-style amber Irish amber - hmmm, seems a little odd.  Nice head, but it didn't last long.  Amber color seemed thin, a portent of the rather watery mouthfeel.  Aroma is a little sharp, with a hint of mineral.  Slightly tart, with some just-there caramel malt.  Finish is mildly acidic.  Not much going on here.","Brent","Jul 18, 2002"
3.35,4.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Pours real foamy (hard to keep it in the pint glass).  Mineral, ale-water backbone (like a Bass) with a pleasant malt character.  Barely noticable hop presence.  Goes down easy.  Doesn't kick much.  Great session beer.","DarthMalt","Jun 03, 2002"
2.94,-8.4,4,2.5,3,3,3,"The beer was a dark brownish amber color that left a white head with some nice lace.  A slight aroma of malt, but barely even that.  The flavor was of malt.  The finish of is was very light and the beer seemed watery.  I was rather disappointed with this, since I was hoping this on tap would be better than the other macros they had.","Wildman","Jun 03, 2002"
2.8,-12.8,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Not bad, but just a little bit watery in the end, no real standout character, i guess they focused this beer to a wider audience, drinkable.","rastaman","Beers"
3.26,1.6,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Nice reddish color, fuzzy off white head with red hints.  Nice malty smell and taste, earthy roastedness to it. Kinda slippery and slider, but tastes pretty good. Alot of malt taste, what you expect.  I never knew it was imported by Heineken. Ok going down, maybe one at a time. Haven't really had much in this style to compare it to.","StevieW","0"
3.38,5.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Nice deep copper/brown in color. Fresh smelling of sweet malt with a touch of carmel.  Taste is similar, somewhat flat tasting, but good malt character.","psugrad98","Jul 07, 2001"
