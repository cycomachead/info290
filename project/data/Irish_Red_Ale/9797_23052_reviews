"Not bad at all.   Had the chance to try it n would drink another."

"Finish is kind of dry and leaves a bit of a bitter hop bite on the finish.  Beer is very easy to drink even if it isnt overly complex.  Not a bad beer to enjoy a few of and not have to think too deeply about while you enjoy them."

"Clear deep reddish brown color with a tightly bubbled tan head that dissipates quickly. Heavy toffee and caramel maltiness with an earthy edge to counter. Rich sweet caramel maltiness with earthy and bits of oxidation obviously present. Medium to thin body moderate carbonation. Middle of the road Irish ale with a bit of an oxygen problem."

"Got this as part of a BOTM club shipment. Wanted to like it, but I got a very overpowering metallic taste that just ruined it for me. Too bad, it had really nice color and decent aroma. Maybe I got a bad or old can (3/12/14). Maybe it was just me. Either way, this one cleaned the kitchen sink drain."
""
"Overall – A very enjoyable red with lots of flavor and a nice sweet, but not cloying taste as it is nicely balanced by some good roasted malt and very light grainy and hop flavors."
""
"Overall impression:  An easy drinking balanced Irish Red.  Not sure why this hasn't gotten more love.  Well crafted, approachable, and tasty.  Glad I tried it."
"Just hearing a Crack! was enough to give me a chubby! I began the inverted Glug and sat back as the pseudo-cascade began. It settled into two-plus fingers of fizzy, tawny head that immediately began to fizzle and pop its way out of existence. Color was a Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, "

"O - probably not the best summer beer (its ninety plus degrees as I drink it) but a very tasty drinkable Irish red ale."

"Overall: This is a solid flagship beer for North Country. This is not one of my favorite styles, as it is not overly-complex in flavor or aromas, but this is a sturdy version of the Irish Red Ale. I'd prefer this over the commercially available imports (ie Murphys, Smithwicks) any day. The dry finish is a desirable effect."

"A big thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pretty amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is light, a bit of malts. Taste is malts, some caramel, a bit of sweetness, easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"A nice looking beer which I’ve also had on tap. Not much flavor, so probably a good beer for non-beer drinkers. The best thing about this beer is that a portion of the proceeds go to the local fire department, so worth picking up a sixer occasionally."
""
""
"Eh. This beer is merely ""okay"" at best. It's well too malty and sweet from it for my liking. There's too much good beer out there to be spending time on bland stuff like this. Better beer out there and better beer from North Country to be trying."
""
"Just okay. That's how I'd write it in my book."

"O - When people visit the brewery, this the most liked beer, but for what reason? There's so much malt going on here, its not a clean and light feeling beer."

"Too warm, too flat. Fairly enjoyable. This one is better on-tap."
"The finish is dry with a caramel subtlety. Good brew!"
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a sweet roast and a sugar cookie batter like smell. In the taste, sweet malts, a dry sugar cookie and a small hop in the end. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop in the aftertaste. Nice red, sweet cookie like but balanced."
"Has a bit of a minerally taste to it. Also was a bit hazy for the style. Probably not filtered, which is odd cause it doesnt have much taste for an unfiltered beer. I do like the idea of helping the fire department, but I wish the beer tasted bettter. It was way too mild for me."
"Pretty refreshing. Nothing special, but an easy to like session beer. Hurt by a lack of a noticeable scent though."
"Had the cask version of this beer at Pipers Pub in Pittsburgh. I'm used to having a nice creamy head from a beer drawn from a hand pump, but this one had none at all. Very low carbonation. The nose was literally non-existant - similar to smelling a glass of water. Very strange. The flavor followed suit with not much of anything going on. Very thin in body - not much in the way of a discernable malt pallete, and only a hint of hops in the tail end of the finish. To sum this beer up in one word - Bland. I was excited to try this beer being that it is local, but ended up completely dissapointed, and $5 poorer. Not a great introduction to North Country Brewing."
"Came to the table a wonderful deep, blood-ruby red with a nice bit of thick foam and had very nice lacing throughout. Very nice thick malty scent, deep and slightly woodsy. Excellent taste, a very nice maltiness, just south of a brown ale, with a touch of tartness to it and a nice light hoppy finish; unlike a lot of red ales, they did not overhop this one, it was just about perfect. Went down wonderfully smooth, although I know part of that is because it was through a cask ale system. I'd like to compare to a non-cask version, but definitely recommend it on cask."
"Pours a dark red to slightly orange color with little to no head. The smell is of caramel malts with some slight smell of citrus hops. The taste is very similar, it has a slight caramel malt taste that is slightly sweet and is balanced out with some citrus hops. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, not much going on for the mouthfeel. The drinkability is good, it is a serviceable beer that you could have a couple of, but not go all night."
"D: Pretty solid ale. Another good one from North Country."
"Notes: Second time I've tried this one. This seems to be a local favorite. I tried it at the Penn Brewfest and it was popular among my group back then."
"Very clean and crisp finish with moderate carbonation. Not a lot of texture to it. I guess there was not much substance overall. A solid selection, but very mild in all aspects."
"D- A decent session beer, sweeter than I prefer, but in accordance with the style."
"D-This was delicious and I could have drank it all night."
"D- My friend loves this beer. I'm not too keen on irish reds, but this is well made. Much better than killian's IMO."
"Item of note - NCB donates a small percentage of all sales of this item to the aforementioned Station 33 Firehouse in Slippery Rock, so try a glass, enjoy a good Irish Ale and help out our heroes all at the same time."
