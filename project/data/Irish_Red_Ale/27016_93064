Pine/resin nose and flavor is pine hops and caramel, light bitter aftertaste, higher ABV is hidden. $7.20 for a 220z bottle from a Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, ME.","jdhilt","Dec 25, 2013"

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Thick body with initial sweetness but the beer avoids being sticky. Carbonation is brisk but doesn't break the body up too much. Sweet candied tropical fruits up front. Malty sweetness hits the mid palate. Faint bitterness to balance everything, lingering cereal grain flavors along win a touch of tobacco make de a unique, tasty and refreshing beer that brings you to thoughts of a Hawaiian luau at sunset. Different in a good way with some other hidden complexities, burnt sugars, tangerines, faintly flowery. A complex beer with lots of different flavors that all work together, it's also just nice to sip and enjoy it.","jtierney89","Aug 18, 2013"

3.63,-6.7,3.75,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall: I bought this because I liked the "Lobstah" rowing away angry. That being said, I do not normally buy Irish red ales as they seem average in many ways, however, this Imperial version of the style was good. Light and refreshing for a hot day in June, and the 8% abv is appreciated (not by my wife), and was hidden well. If you want to try something different, this imperial red was a interesting twist on the classic red ale. Cheers!!","dahlen22","Jun 02, 2013"

4.04,3.9,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Overall, this is a nice beer in many ways, but the hops tend to overwhelm everything else. Had this been marketed as a double IPA, this would not have been an issue, but the “Imperial Red Ale” note speaks to a higher sugar presence that is simply not there, causing the beer to seem out of balance. This is not to say that the beer is not delicious – in fact, I would easily buy another bottle – but it’s not what I expected, and the result, especially because of the drastic difference between the aroma and the taste, was too jarring.","jondeelee","May 25, 2013"

4.27,9.8,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Deep amber in color with an off white head. Good lace and retention. Great balance of sweet tasty malt and bright piney hops. Super creamy and thick with great feel and finish. Although a bit cloying after a while. Great hop profile and definitely an Imperial Red as opposed to an Imperial Red IPA. Solid, delicious beer for malt fans and hop heads alike.","Gatch","May 20, 2013"

3.74,-3.9,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"O: Enjoyable but a little strong at 8% ABV to be called easy drinking or sessionable - the alcohol is pretty well hidden.

Poured from a 22-oz bomber into a large beer stein. Decent head. Nice lacing around the glass.","beerman999999","0"
