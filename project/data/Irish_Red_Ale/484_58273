3.65,17,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Busted Knuckle pours a dark reddish color with a nice long lasting and lacing head. There is a roubust roasted aroma, with a nice sweetness. The taste has a mellow roasted flavor, a little too sweet, and some earthy tones. A little too carbonated, but still some nice flavors. Overall its a decent red ale, some nice flavors, but a little too sweet to be great","vette2006c5r","Jun 10, 2014"

3.06,-1.9,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small caramel and sweet malt. In the taste, a small caramel like note and a sweet to dry essence. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry caramel like note in the aftertaste. Decent, but just above average.","OWSLEY069","May 19, 2012"

1.63,-47.8,3.5,3,1,1,1,"Disgusting creation of a beer, each sip pains me more, fuck this shit. Disgusting horrible creation why is this being marketed as craft beer, did they sit this in a hot store room for a year? it pours an amber color with a light khaki tan head fine speckled lacing super light speckled lacing. Aroma tart sourdough bread hints of watery caramel notes with a fucked up overall nose...like husks of grains. Flavor makes me cringe I can't believe how bad this beer is I though it would be promising, instead I pour straight shit into my glass. Induces gag reflux with a stale grainy finish, this is horrible I hate this beer with disdain please let's get them closed down it's an abomination of a beer. Overall if you like this beer let me hand you a personal FUCK YOU!","WVbeergeek","Apr 01, 2012"
2.28,-26.9,3,2.5,2,2,2.5,"D- lackluster version of a style that I'm not partial to. There's much better out there however the lightness of body and weak flavor could up its drinkability.","hustlesworth","Mar 05, 2012"

2.83,-9.3,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall: It's like a light version of a good Irish Amber. It's got the right flavors, just not enough of them, and they aren't bold enough. Too light for my liking, so I would not seek this out again.","ChopperSmith","Jan 26, 2012"

2.96,-5.1,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"I never say "No" to a free bottle of a beer I've never had before. This one pours a clear copper-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose is decidedly buttery, with side notes of light grass and caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a decent amount of sweetgrass on top. This helps to cut the buttery malts, but not enough... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a marginally dry finish. Overall, an average Irish red at best, a beer that just didn't do it for me at all.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2011"
3.53,13.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability is good. A very easy drinking beer, but not a lot of tastes going on that would make you want to drink more. It has nice marketing on the bottle for St. Patty's Day chugging beer, so I guess this beer fits someone who wants to chug a fake Irish beer all day. Better than Killian's, but that means nothing.","BDIMike","Oct 17, 2011"

3.06,-1.9,3,2,3.5,3,3.5,"Thanks to Rob at MGM for the sample. Poured a medium reddish with a small head that disappeared fairly quick with little lace. Smell is almost non-existent, a trace of malt, at best. Taste picks up a bit, with medium roasted caramel malt lending a semi-sweet flavor reminiscent of a Tootsie roll candy. Its quite brightly carbonated and in a medium style body.","JackieTH","0"
3.74,19.9,3,4,4,3,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a good Irish Red Ale, one of the better ones I have had. Everything about this beer was pretty spot on for it style and it was highly drinkable. This would make a good spring time brew, wish I had some of these on St. Pattys day. Another good beer from grays and one that I would buy again and recommend to anybody who likes this style.","StoutHunter","May 21, 2010"
3.62,16,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5," ~ This is not something I'll recommend to friends. Not because it poorly represents the style but because I'm not a big fan of the style. As far as drinkability within the style... I say average or a bit better.","cdkrenz","May 11, 2010"

3.8,21.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Mahogany body. Thin dirty white head. Lacing is sporadic. Fresh yeast and caramel malts on the nose. Some sugar too. Nice caramel malt base. Solid footing. Some dry woodiness lingers, which adds a nice touch. Hops add a little herbalness. All in all, a nice flavor profile. Body is medium full. Subdued carbonation, though not a creamy feel perse. Decent enough offering.","Bighuge","0"
