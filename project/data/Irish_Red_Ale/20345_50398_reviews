"Bleh..some caramel malt notes are the ""highlights"" here. Low carbonation and zero reason to go for more then a few sips...pass this one by"
"03/20/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. On tap. Very enjoyable & as the first of the day, it went down all to easy. May have another before day's end."

"The body is medium, and this wouldn't work as well as a classic Irish style if it was much heavier. It's got lots of depth, but what really impresses me is a clean and robust balance against an incredibly silky smoothness that coats the tongue without slickness and flows like silk. Impressively, it doesn't give up crispness for all the smoothness."

"Overall: You'd be pretty nuts not to seek this out if you're a fan of U.S. craft beer and love Irish reds. I had it with some BBQ tempeh, mashed potatoes and broccoli, and it was the perfect pairing. This beer is proof that American brewers can do cool things with fairly standard styles without resorting to mondo hopping or zany flavors. Would drink again."

"Fairly standard amber/red ale. Not as dry as most which is nice. Decent flavors but boring."
"Overall a good pick and solid ale"
"Taste comes off the same with light tones and smooth sweetness. Very easy drinking and laid back and even a bit watery at times. Not the best amber ever but still a decent brew."

"I love red beer and this one is pretty good... the best quality was its appearance which was beautifull. The smell and taste were okay, nothing spectacular in general but a great beer to bring by to drink with friends instead of bringing Miller's or Buds."

"O: Nothing special but still and enjoyable and easy to drink beer - could definitely be sessionable since it has a moderate ABV and an easy to enjoy flavor."

"Had this for the first time in Appelebee's, it was their guest beer of the month. I like Irish Reds and this was very good to excellent on the first glass. Smooth with a caramel/butterscotch taste, it was easy to put a few down quickly. I made a special trip to the brewery in Riverhead, where Greg showed me around and indicated that they were going to be bottling shortly from their Riverhead location. I can't wait, this Ale tastes great!"

"Light."
"i'm a big amber fan and this one is right up there with the best of them. i know ambers don't get a lot of love on this site, but if you like the style i'd recommend giving this one a try if you see it. very well balanced and just gives me that caramel malt flavor that i crave from time to time when i'm all hopped out"
"O - A solid and enjoyable effort from the local folks. I would try this on tap if I came across it."
"Had a sample from this brewery almost a year back and remembered enjoying it, so I took the opportunity to try it again when seen on tap. Close to a finger head on a caramel-reddish body. The smell is of caramel, butterscotch, with the taste leading there also with a tea-like flavor. The body is very light with light carbonation which makes the for a crisp refreshing character. A pleasant 'lighter' beer."
"Polishing off a 32oz. Growler at the 'mo. Reppin' Strong Island in a real good way with a decent appearance. This isthe second time I've had a growler fill of this brew and it's a solid sessionable brew. Definitely lighht carbonation and good mouthfeel throughout. Bold flavor with slight bitterness. Great with food."
"Poured a deep reddish color, bordering on brown. Little head, little lacing. Smelled no hops, muted malts. Tasted those malts, and maybe some caramel. Mouthfeel and drinkability are the best parts of this red ale for me. Smooth mouthfeel, slight carbonation, clean finish. Way drinkable at 5%. This is a very relaxed session-able brew."
"D - Decent. The mouthfeel and alcohol content are easy enough on your palate to throw a few of these back. The taste just doesn't keep me coming back."
"Overall, I like it. Irish Red is a style that I feel is underrepresented and thought I'd give it a try when I caught it on tap. I'm glad I did. I would definitely give this a go and I'll be looking for their other beers in the future."
"Overall a good and servicable ale."
"D - This one is extremely drinkable. A bit on the watery side which makes it go down easy, but the flavor is nice and subtle and it leaves my mouth feeling cool. I could easily throw several of these back."
"It went down easy, so I had another sample."
"Picked up a growler direct from the contract brewer in Connecticut, this one shows a dark maple color with a fair off-white head and decent lacing. The aroma is pretty simple sour apple caramel malt, pretty sharp. Upon the first mouthful this is somewhat thin, an aqueous finely carbonated ale which somewhat resembles a sweet brown ale. I also pick up some smoke but the dominant taste is tart rhubarb and sour brown sugar. At first it seems too sour, almost like it's over ""ripe"" but as you get through the first pint, it mellows and the sweetness blends in a bit more and you get the nutty brown ale qualities, and always a touch of smoky wood. Drinkability is good, it grows on you. Worth a try."
