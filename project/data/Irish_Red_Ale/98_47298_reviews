"Mild, but refreshing, and not without some darker, earthy-amber richness, while remaining mostly aethereal and crisp."

"nice irish red good color and smell"

"Might have been one of my first craft beers. Its nothing extrodinary, but given the style its no supposed to be. Easy drinking and simple. Nutty, tea like maltiness, lager like crispness."

"04/05/13  On tap at Rattle N Hum, NYC. This is malt, malt, malt. Not shy at all. Surprisingly refreshing for something so assertive. Nice body & not sweet. Noticeable, but not in an in your face kind of way."

"Overall: An okay beer, but not my favorite. Tastes similar to a doppelbock in terms of overall malt profile. Maltier than an Oktoberfest, but sweeter than a doppelbock."
""
""
""
"It's OK but not spectacular. Their website lists it as a good session beer, and it should be with a 5.4% alcohol content, but I couldn't down many of these due to the noticeable alcoholic flavor."

"O: Very nice red ale. I've been a fan of others of this style I've tried, and this is no exception. Like the malty-bready/biscuity taste."

"It is very sessionable and easy to pair with food. Harpoon has nailed the style."
"O-Not a bad beer at all. An above average Irish-style red ale in my opinion."
"O: Pretty easy to drink and a little better than other offerings in the Irish red style. Not a favorite for me but I could easily have a couple of these in a single session."
""
"Pours a medium amber color, full fluffy white head, moderate retention. Scent is pale and mild with notes of caramel malts and stale grassy hops. Taste brings a bit more to the table... caramel malts still dominate with only a light touch of hoppyness, quite grassy, earthy. Lighter bodied and heavily bubbly. Really felt like I had a Vienna lager as opposed to an Irish Red. Just too light and fizzy for me."
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. An above average Irish Red, it’s a good solid choice for a night of dancing and debauchery or a day of celebrating the arrival of spring. Maybe not a brew I’ll look forward to with anticipation each year, but not one I’d turn down either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Though I'm not a huge fan of reds, this is probably one of the best that I've had thus far. The taste seems to be a combination of alcohol, which is odd considering the ABV, and malt. It's quite enjoyable as a yearly St. Pat's drink."
"Overall pretty nice! I would love to try a different Celtic Red style to compare."
""
""
""
"O: I believe this to be a high quality example of the style. It is at least to my liking, although I am not a huge fan of Irish red ales or red ales in general. This brew has a solid malt backbone that carries it through a decent amount of complexity for the style. I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up the next time I get a rare hankering for an Irish red."

"O: Let's face it, this isn't the greatest or most appreciated style of beer and while it's one I used to appreciate, I've grown away from it. Never-the-less, this beer is just about spot-on for the style. Not a bad beer."
"notes: the taste cannot live up to the amazing nose but it is pretty good, easy to drink and easily the best Irish Red I've had. Actually, it reminds me of Bass Ale. I only bought a single bottle of this but this being St Patrick's Day I will go forth and buy a 6 pack of this. I could drink this all day long."
""
""
"O: Decent beer but not that interesting overall. Malt profile could use a bit more depth. The beer is very easy to drink though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A decent red ale. It has an easy drinking and non-complex flavor profile that has nice smoother flavors which makes a good beer to have while enjoying the company of other."

"Pours a dark copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, slight hops, and some nutty aromas. Taste is much the same with malty and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"From the 12 oz bottle bought at Trader Joe's in San Diego."

"O: A good effort, not anything to make you go wow, but I certainly enjoyed the 24 oz. I don't know if this is some kind an anomaly, or if Harpoon is actually coming to CA, but I'd like to see more from them in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: seems like it's going to hit upfront with a citrus hop bite, but that fades quickly into a lot of sweet bready malt. Some caramel, malt syrup and some grain. Mouthfeel is pretty watery. Not really a fan of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy going. Light alcohol. Fun but sweet Irish Red."
""
""
""
"O: A nice take on the style and one that could easily be drank in either the winter or spring. I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this one is good. Worth a shot"

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma, and the rich color. We were surprised to find some estery sweetness, as well as fruit and bitterness among the rich malty background. The flavoring, however, was a bit basic, and skirted on the adjuncty side, making this guy less than perfect."

"The beer pours a clear, dark red color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the sweet malt, with some dark fruit thrown in. I get a ton of raisins and cherries in the aroma. The flavor is very similar, with a lot of sweet toffee and some light dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I am not a huge fan of this style of beer, but this one was better than most I have tried."
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent beer, but nothing great."
""
""

"Overall: very malty so much that the beer texture is affected."
""
""
"A lovely clear red amber ale wit a good head and nice lacing. Nose carries aromas of caramel malt light sweetness and some toasted whole grain bread. A light fruitiness blooms as it warms up and indeed this is a beer best served at cool rather than cold temperatures to allow the flavors to develop. Speaking of flavors the taste is nicely malty with lots of caramel malt and chewy breadiness. There is a mild sweetness and firm yeasty fruitiness that is a hallmark of good UK style brewing. This one gets better as it warms. Finish is clean with a touch of metal and lingering toast and grains. Feel is medium light with a smooth and lightly effervescent carbonation. This is a beer that touts itself for St. Patty's day and it is more that up to the task."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 5/15/2012. Pours crystal clear reddish orange color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice thin cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, raisin, prune, molasses, banana, bubblegum, clove, floral, and toasted bread. Some pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pepper, bread, banana, bubblegum, raisin, molasses, floral, toasted malt, and yeast spices. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, banana, clove, and pepper on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors with good complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Very easy and smooth to drink. Overall this is a very nice Irish red ale! Very nice amount of flavor and balance for being almost a session beer. I would have this again."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, dark, copper-red coloring with a light, frothy, off-white head that quickly settles into an uneven film. Aromas of malt depth, with some nutty and scotch characteristics throughout. Light roasting throughout both the aroma and the palate. Strong malt backbone, with layers of nut, caramel, and toffee sweetness blended together into a smooth, rich body. There is a slight hops bitterness that cleans up the tail end of the flavor profile, leading into a light, richly sweet aftertaste. The body is light and smooth, with a sharpness for the finish. Slightly cloying, leaving a slight linger behind. Easy to drink, and some interesting and light flavors."
""
""
""
"O- I have a soft spot for a decent Irish Red, and this certainly hit the spot."
"nothing to really get excited over, somewhat of a bland style. i could see this appealing to macro drinkers trying to convert, exspecially those who enjoy yuengling lager, almost the same beer with an ale yeast and maybe the slightest bit more body, but tis the season..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor has some good toasted malt, with earthy tones and banana bread. It's got a good medium body and is quite thirst quenching."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, faint caramel, clean finishing. Light-bodied and sessionable, plain but pleasant. A nice choice as a session ale on March 17."
""
""
""
"This brew is making me want to look into this style again. A great treat here; tasty, full bodied, looks great and is very drinkable. Great stuff here."
"This is a decent beer. I would definitely have a few of these with my St. Patty's celebration."
""
""
"Overall this beer is ok but it seems like there is a little too much going on. Glad I tried it but probably wouldn't go back and have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a chilled pint glass. Foamy head, about a quarter inch, dissipated to some lingering lacing. floral hop aroma with a hint of citrus. Color is golden ruby. Nice ruddy appearance for an Irish Red. Nice smooth feel in the mouth with just a bit of extra carbonation. Floral hop taste with a hint of caramel. Finishes bitter and dry. Overall very nice, solid red ale."
"O - Not one of my favorites"
""
""
"O: not a bad beer, but nothing to scream about, might have again ... ?"
""
""
""
""
"O- an interesting take on an Irish Red. Fruity and refreshing, yet nicely balanced by the sweet malt. Better than I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a pretty 2"" bright beige head of average lifespan. The body is a nice clear amber but I wouldn't really call it a red ale. It smells of toasted malt and a little hops. The taste is kind of a weak version of a Scotch ale. This beer is OK, I could drink it regularly, but it's not really a standout."
""
""
"O-Another Irish Red Ale that just didn't do it for me. The mesh of flavors isn't there."

"Overall, this is a solid Irish Red, obviously made with care and good quality ingredients. It doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the style, but it is well-crafted and nicely balanced."
"I personally thought this was a very good Irish Red. Very smooth and tasty. I hope it is released again next year."
"Very drinkable."
"A good all-around irish red. Pretty close to the style, from my experience. I could have used some more hops, though not bright ones."
"This really isn't a bad little red."
"Overall this is nice beer. Nothing to complain about."
"Yes I would drink it again and I enjoyed it as a decent Irish Red."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. I enjoyed it quite a bit and might buy more in the future next time they're available."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors could have used a touch more of a hit, though the spices were a nice addition, they weren't quite perfect and enough on their own."
"A rough beer tod rink. Odd malty aromas, light orange coloured body. I did not like the taste, the mouthfeel. Still a little drinkability. I have had better in the style.Not the worst Harpoon, ending with something more flavourful from the brewery.Thanks Radek."
"D: Doesn’t feel well put together. In some ways it seems more like a lager version despite the “ale” in the name (clean, light, sulfur). Rather edgey and angular, doesn’t seem rounded at all. Minimal caramel and sweetness. Otherwise in style, but pushes the margins. Just barely under-average drinking."
"Overall: Highly drinkable, however a bit less malt than I'd like for an Irish red to have. The beer lacks the unmistakable slightly pungent malt profile one would expect from an Irish red. I can't help but wonder whether Harpoon dialed this one back a bit to shoot for more of a ""gateway""-type beer. Not bad, but could have been better IMO. (I did not review it, but remember enjoying the Hibernian Ale more a few years back.)"
"Crisp and light on the palate, dry, refreshing, with a nice toasted malt flavor that recalls an alt. I really like this brew, I find it very drinkable and refreshing...more flavor than your standard lager, I would like to revisit this in hot weather as I think the light dry body will go well with hot humid days, while providing a good amount of toasty flavor."
"Food Pairing: This brew screams Lamb, potatoes, root vegetables, hearty stews, braised beef, oddly german fare would go well (jager schnitzel, spatz, red cabbage, and this brew. Tuck me in and kiss me goodnight.)"
"Overall a pretty good beer, but nothing to go crazy over. Good flavor and well made, like most harpoon beers."
"More notes: The woody tastes seem even more apparent when this beer is served on tap. I think it throws the balance of flavors off a little bit. One of the few beers I enjoyed better out of the bottle."
"D: in my opinion just an average irish red. a good one when the time is right, but otherwise keep it moving."
"Overall I liked it. This maybe the first Harpoon beer I did enjoy. Kind of aggressive grain profile but still very good. Would consider buying a sixer."
"D- Very easy to drink a bunch of this in a sitting and even easier to come back to"
"overall its an average beer, wouldnt buy a six pack again, but if i felt festive and saw it on draft, i would get it again"
"m/o: the initial mouthfeel is fine; smooth, slightly creamy, but about 10 seconds after swallowing there is such a dryness in my throat that just ruins the experience. I suppose I could just keep pounding these down and somewhat enjoy them, but I'll inevitably have to leave this beer being annoyed and disappointed because it finishes so poorly."
"Well made but not overly memorable beer we enjoyed on St Patrick's day. The color is closer to red than amber and the head was average. Not a lot of aroma which was disappointing. It is slightly hoppy with a prominent taste of banana both on the tongue and the finish."
"For St. Patrick's Day, I bought a six-pack of this beer. The color did have a slight amber, but it seemed a bit too watery just from looking at it. Patchy lacing also. Aromas had an unique hints of juices such as apples and even oranges within a burnt context. Taste had a bitter-sour flavor, but it washed down with a decent spice to it. I liked the mouthfeel of this beer; nice carbonation and pretty drinkable. Overall, not too bad."
"Pours an reddish brown color with average carbonation. The head is a long lasting one around a fingers worth. Has a mild hoppy taste and aroma with a bitter but dry finish. A worthy representative of this class. I'd certainly would sample this one again."
"I am usually a rather jovial fan of any beer that comes out of Boston, however, this one deserved to be bent over my knee and spanked. After first pour into a clean and crisp pilsner glass, my initial thoughts on its appearance nearly convinced me that I was going to enjoy this beer. It has an attractive reddish/amber hue and a good inch thick head on it after it settled. Christ almighty was I fooled! As I poured this facade of a brew into my eager mouth, I was immediately struck with an incredible shock to my taste buds like a spear to my gut. This beer had rudely interrupted what I thought was going to be a celestial experience. The taste was almost nonexistant...bland would be an understatement. I sensed a cripsness to it that could have been better exploited ...had the beer had better componets to it. The finish was bitter, but I will admit that the aftertaste did not linger as long as I thought it would. I truly missed the presence and aroma of the ingrediants of this brew as I have grown accustomed to smell in other reds that I have tried. Sorry Harpoon, your other brews are great, but other than the pleasant appearance, this one was a crushing failure."
"D: Not too heavy, not too light. Maybe hoping for a stronger all-around flavor but I would buy another bottle of this in the near future, just not a 6-pack."
"This is one of the most beautiful beers I've ever seen. The head was an awesome golden reddish cream, three fingers high. It looked like what I picture a Lothlorien beer would look like (uh, maybe this should be my last beer of the night?!). Well, anyway, the smell is not promising. Reminds me of one of the worst beers I have tried, Four Horesmen's Irish red. Yeeeuckkk! Luckily the taste, although slightly similar to that aforementioned travesty of a beer, is actually really good. Although slightly minerally with a slight tartness, it goes down smoothly and makes friends with tongue, throat and stomach easily. Very drinkable beer, and I would definitely try again!"
"Best by date stamped on bottle. 3/4 inch white head, clear sparkling dark amber body with ruby highlights. Initial bitter taste, with short finish. Couldn't really pin the taste of this beer down, different than any other beer I've had. Not really sure if I liked it enough to have another one."
"D: different, but better? I don't know. I'll have to try this beer again later to solidify my opinion of it."
"Very underated Irish Red ale."
"Pretty burnt orange hue with a solid white head that sticks around for a bit. Smell hits you right out of the gate with some light fruity scents that complement barley and malt aromas. Taste starts strong but finishes slightly disappointingly that hints of some American adjunct lagers that I dislike. Fortunately this taste is bolstered by some good hop, barley and slight malt flavors. On the front of the tongue it tastes better than in the back, on the finish. Finish is smooth and crisp with a mouthfeel that's on the creamier side. Drinkability is high with this one as it would be no problem to knock back a few of these when there's nothing better. Decent beer, just not great or unique."
"Drink - Not a bad beer for the style. It would come in handy with St Patrick's Day approaching. Worth a try if you happen to see it - it is also very reasonable priced."
"Drinkabilty - Well, its a decent beer but too light for me. There are more solid irish ales out there but that are more flavor heavy. Its very smooth and easy to drink, so you could pound a 6-pack really easy. Good beer, but it cant touch great lakes conway imo."
"The ale pours a brilliant ruby red with a nice cream colored head with decent retention, while the nose is bright with lots of floral flavors, cherries and caramel. The mouth starts malty with a juicy pink grapfruit note, moderate carbonation and a pleasant balancing hoppiness, while the finish returns to the more mouthwatering malt notes."
"D/M: Crisp tight carbonation with a good balance. Very drinkable and not overpowering."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours a reddish-brown, thin head with minimal lacing. Aroma of caramel, sweet toasted malts, butter. Semi-sweet toasted malts, caramel, minor hop taste, semi-dry finish. There is also somewhat of a thick syrup taste that is especially apparent in the aftertaste - this really hurt the score. Medium carbonation and medium body, but feels a little watery. Overall a decent brew."
"D - overall I would say that this beer is not an every day, sit down at the pub, beer. However, it does have it's merits for an occasional change of pace"
"This is admittedly an unusual red ale; most beer drinkers will enjoy this, but only some will want to return; those who don't will have enjoyed the visit, though."
"D - session worthy; but every time the band-aid returned...?"
"I am a huge fan of reds and have a huge respect for Irish beer. Most reds that I have tried are American so the Irish style reds are somewhat new to me. This beer was not in favor to my personal pallet. Harpoon I will keep trying to find the beer for me in your company. I still keep the faith."
"Easy to drink, but not something I'd want many repeats of. Simple and good, one of the better Harpoon offerings."
"D- A nice find, it would pair well with pub food on st. patty's day. Not a standout in any one dimension, but nonetheless enjoyable. You might not remember this beer, but it won't make you want to forget it."
"Nice drinking beer."
"Nice almost pure red color with a half-inch-to-an-inch of off-white foam that sinks rather quickly. Malty nose with hints of sweet garden vegetables. Medium body, leaning towards the light side. Carbonation is smooth and creamy. Sweet maltiness with caramel, taffee and mild woodsiness. Clean and smooth without a lot of aftertaste. Very drinkable; easy to have more than one."
"Could knock these back for days!"
"Pours an ultra-clear, dark amber-orange. A tan head recedes and patches to the glass. but a few slow carb trails. Smell is high-pitched toasted malts, some fresh greens as well. I tend to rate finish with mouthfeel, and this beer has some of the best of both. I like it when a beer makes me forget about the seperation. For taste - a light, buddy hops twists intently into an absolute blast of sweet and almost cocoa-ish roasted malts. Then the finish is dry. And bitter. Feel is carbonated and medium-bodied and hearty. Drinkability high. I'm starting to think I like these red ales.."
"Reading others' reviews I think I got a bad one that spoiled... it tastes spoiled. Next time I get a chance to try this beer I'll re-review."
"I picked a six pack up on my way home from an out of state trip and was quite thrilled with what I bought. I have come to expect great beers from Harpoon and this is one of the reasons why. This one has very nice sweet smells that sets up well for what your taste buds have in store. It also have a very sweet malty flavor with some caramel hints. This would be a great desert beer for sure."
"A quite respectible entry in this style category. Malt-centric, with some light fruity notes and a touch of woodyness. Body was just a bit on the lighter side than I would have liked, but, overall, an enjoyable sessionable ale that would be a fine accompanyment to a meat-and-potato meal."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a moderate red-amber color. Off-white head that starts out at a nice two-finger height and falls down throughout. Good lacing. The nose brings some light caramel and toffee notes plus a bit of earthy hops. In the end, a bit of the characteristic Harpoon house yeast which, after having 25 or so of their beers, I've started to pick up on. Taste is slight breadiness plus some earth. Light to medium body and nice drinkability."
"Medium body with a light, crisp finish and flavor that's nothing to write home about. The taste wasn't bad, but just didn't do anything for me. I was disappointed."
"Pours a clear dark copper, with a a thin light tan head. Smells of ripe bananas. Taste is dextrin sweetness up front, with a toasted bread middle, and a earthy hop finish. Mouthfeel is good, low carbonation. Drinkability is quite good, easy drinking and refreshing. A good beer overall."
"Like I said, I had 4. I tried them in various circumstances and in each case it was a chore to finish the bottle. bleh."
"Drinkability - The finish on this lets your mouth know that it would like another taste and sooner than later, it drinks quick especially on a nice hot day."
"Harpoon is one of my all-time favorite breweries, helped me get into craft. I think this is their brew for the masses if you catch my drift. Nothing wrong with it, just nothing special. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy it."
"Harpoon Celtic has a reddish amber color, taste has a good malty character with a moderate hoppiness. Good head retention but the first taste almost has a little too much head for my taste. Once I get into the beer itself I am quite pleased. This ale has a medium body and is very drinkable. One of my favorites on draft at my local pub."
"D: This is a nice little red ale. I would recommend it."
"Good drinking Irish red. I enjoyed."
"D. Pretty impressive beer overall and would drink this one no problem."
"Sweet caramel malts pretty much complete this one-trick pony, but it is not that bad of a beer surprisingly. The effervescent carbonation offsets some of the sweetness and there is a floral clover-leaf bitterness that is probably at least half toasty malt to go with a mild hopping rate. As an Irish Red, it is pretty lackluster...but it does go down very easy and I must say you could choose worse for a St. Patty's Day sixer. Mine certainly will not go to waste!"
"Notes - It's perhaps a little sweet for the style, but otherwise a very solid beer. Not terribly complex, but tasty. A great session beer."
"D: Goes down easy, ok representation of the style. It's one to have a few pints of, but not necessarily seek out."
"Drinkability is well not great don't see having this one again might as well have a Killians."
"Drink well my friend"
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a clear red/copper color with a big fluffy head that retains very well and laces nicely. A slight citrus aroma but not much else. Very mild malty and sour taste. Good clean finish. Goes down very easy. Recommended, this was a pleasant surprise."
"Great beer!"
"I had this beer becuase it was the only new one on draft that day at my local beer bar. I'm not a big fan of Irish Reds but as far as the style goes, Harpoons is quite nice. Good red/amber color, not much aroma but a refreshing flavor that will be enjoyed by anyone who likes irish beers and even those in the mood for an ""American Light Lager"""
"I could drink this all night."
"Mouthfeel is light, and drinkability is fairly high. Put together the good taste, light mouthfeel and relatively low ABV, drinkability is its highest rating."
"I drank about four of these (all different sittings) before i decided to review it. I wasn't too impressed the first couple of times, but it really grew on me. I don't know if the meal I had with it today brought the flavor out somehow, but I could really taste the toasted malty goodness this time. Great brew!"
"Mild slightly malty aroma, a little sweetness and a trace of hops, pleasant but not outstanding. Again a mild balanced flavor, nothing overpowering, maltly, a slight hoppiness to the finish. Easy drinking, goes down smoothly and is refreshing."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a small head. Smell is of malts, a bit sweet. Taste is crisp, malts with a bit of hops, finishing slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"D: Very drinkable as it is an Irish Red and that is the point of these beers...am I wrong?"
"Pours a clear shimmering bronze that is beautiful in the light. Has very little head but settles to a white collar that laces the top of the glass. Constant streams of very fine bubbles add to its attractiveness. Aromas are disappointingly subdued, tending towards a dull toastiness. Tastewise, light English hops balance the bready malts, but the flavors lack assertiveness and aren't very interesting. Overall, it is not a bad beer but doesn't have any remarkable qualities."
"As good an Irish red as I've had, not that that's been many. Certainly an easy drink, but the lingering bitterness limits its sessioning potential to me."
"M/D - Pretty light body for an Irish Red Ale and a little under carbonated for my personal preference. It is smooth on the palate and really easy to drink."
"D= would be a great dinner beer and definitely better than Killians et al because this is actually made with quality malts and hops and isn't soda-pop carbonated. Probably great when running on-tap all night as well, but more of a ""standard stock"" Irish Red than a great find. Still, would be nice to see this instead of Killian's on tap in many places."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle makred Best By: 05/15/10-020. Probably from their Windsor, Vermont brewery. Sampled on March 4, 2010. The pour is a very nice looking ruby red-mahogany with a thin beige head. Lots of beige lacing. The aroma is strong with caramel malts and some vague hops. The taste is sweet like butterscotch and caramel with a light hoppy ending. A nice take on the Irish style red."
"D: This beer is good but not great. Flavors and aroma fairly muted and nothing really standouts out here."
"I would say that the Harpoon Celtic Ale is at the top of the Irish eds I have tried recently. This beer would definitely be in my fridge year round."
"D: Pretty good interpretation of an Irish ale, which is a style I haven't had too many of, but the ones I've had, I liked. At the very least, a good session brew that is definitely an alternative to the BMC's of the world. This one isn't going to force one to reminisce or become introspective of the brew, but better than some other brews that are considered sessions."
"For a Irish style ale this is the best one I've had to date. So far this is going to be my St.Patrick's day beer of choice."
"Pours a brilliant almost crystal clear reddish tawny brown color with a perfect white head that laces well down the glass. The aroma was a bit muted, smooth caramel and cereal notes slightly.Tasted creamy as ever and nice and malty. Slight hops flavor balances the sweetness enough. Extremely smooth and refreshing. Does well as it warms as well but cold is perfect. This is a huge session beer for red ale drinkers. A very good example of the style."
"Kind of mixed on this one; suspect it's a very good example of the style, but it's not my favorite. That glycerine flavor is a bit off-putting, but those that don't mind it will find this quite drinkable."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall a very solid and well put together offering from Harpoon. Would not mind trying this again and one of the better I have had from them lately."
"D – I would try it again in the future, perhaps. It is interesting. I would never order up 'another Celtic Ale' though; one per month / year / decade is enough."
"a very drinkable iriish style lager. definitely a St. Paddy's Day session brew, though i prefer to mix it up with anything else not naturally green..."
"Overall, this beer is just plain bad, I can't recommend it to anyone."
"Notes: Overall I would say that this is your basic/average Irish style Red Ale. It's not bad at all but it doesn't stand out either."
"Easy to drink. Prefect beer for a day of ice fishing."
"D-Not a bad tasting beer but I have had better than this one. All flavors are a bit muted and the fruit stone aftertaste is not something I am into. That said, given a limited number of choices I would certainly drink this again."
"Overall-good version of the style, no problems with this beer, not overly creative but it fits the style mold and does it well."
"Out of a bottle provided to me by my good friend Laura this beer was a true garnet color with ruby highlights. The head was two fingers of khaki colored foam that retained well as a thin layer and left streaks of lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, toasted malt and a hint of hops. The flavors were misbalanced starting with bitter grains, then slightly too much of the sweet malts with not enough bittering hops to even it out. Not bad, but awkward. The mouthfeel was watery, the body medium and the carbonation was right on point for the style. A one and done for me."
"Poured from a refrigerator-temperature bottle into a standard pint glass. One finger head of large tan bubbles quickly dissipates into a lacy skim across the top of the beer. Champagne-like bubbles rise to the top of this copper colored brew. Aroma is of sweet malts and some spice. The initial flavor is sweet caramel malt, with a drier finish and a hint of hops. As the beer warms, I am noticing a bitterness that balances the sweetness. There is a good amount of body to this brew, but the high carbonation keeps it from being syrupy or heavy. This is a deliciously uncomplicated beer that I could drink many of."
"Poured from a refrigerator chilled bottle into a pint glass. It has a pretty copper color with hints of red. There is a thick tan head made up of many different sizes of bubbles. It leaves a patchy spiderweb of lacing as the head settles. Initially there were a lot of carbonation bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass, but they have quickly disappeared. There are still a few steams of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. It has a slightly spiced malt smell. The beer has a malty flavor reminiscent of graham crackers. This is most prevalent in the finish, as there is a sweeter flavor up front that disappears as you hold the beer in your mouth. The aftertaste is a bit strange; it has kind of a nutty, alcohol flavor. It has kind of a thick body, but I wouldn't go so far to call it a full-bodied beer. The carbonation bubbles feel sharp on my tongue, but that may go away as the drink's temperature rises. The beer goes down pretty well. It's not an incredible complex beer, so you don't feel like you need to think much well drinking it, you can just enjoy it. This is a great beer to have on hand for easy drinking and to share with friends."
"Well, all told this beer has potential if they crank up the ingredients and the intensity a bit. I liked the flavors I found, but they were kind of hard to find. It's a drinkable Irish red, but drinkable in that it's not offensive in any way, shape or form, and you could definitely drink several without being overly impressed or overly inebriated."
"I drank the pint quickly and moved on to another more interesting beer."
"Drinkability: Easily consumable in a session, this beer seems like a style for Irish Red fans. I would have enjoyed more flavor complexity, but everything worked out okay."
"A few of these on a cold night."
"T- Off the bat it had a very sour aftertaste. But once I got used to it, I noticed a slightly tart fruitiness to it. It has a very dry aftertaste. Not a bad beer, but not a fan."
"it's a really ease to drink beer .i would drink this aagin and again.cheers."
"D- Moderate to high, depending on your affinity for reds. This is a solid and sessionable beer, totally worth checking out. If I saw this on tap I'd get a pint for sure."
"Eric"
"Notes: I was really surprised by this beer, Normally, this brewery fails to get my attention yet this was great for sessions with a good ABV."
"Not a good example at all of the irish red style. Stick to something else."
"D- Over all a very nice beer! I found myself at the bottom sooner than I expected. Easy session beer and I will definitely get it again!"
"D: Pretty good actually, a sessionable ale."
"this brewery has yet to really impress me. this one falls a bit short. not bad, but what is the point?"
"There are roasted malty grains, some sweeter caramels, a bit of diacetyl, some oaken flavors, and a slightly cherryish crystal malt base. There are some leafy hops present, and just enough to keep this from getting too sweet. There is some drying tendencies in the finish, with a touch of toffee, maybe a tad bit of char towards the finish as well. The beer is good, but not brilliant. This is a fairly light bodied beer and none too taxing on the palate."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice clear amber color with a great thick and sticky white head that stuck to the side of the glass as it settled into a 1/4 cap. The brew has a great aroma full of sweet hops and a balance of mildly roasted malts. The taste is wonderfully balance and reminds me of my time in Ireland. There is a sweetness to it but also has that fullness, yet light in the mouth. The style really takes me back which is why I had to give it the rating I did. Back then (about 6 years ago) I was not into BA, but I did write about the types of beers I tried and this really brings back some great times!"
"Pours a golden red/orange brown color with a small white head that leaves some soapy sticking. Sweet, fruity malt in the nose, i pick up next to no bitterness in aroma. Very malty, coating, nutty, coconut, leafy herbal hop character towards the end of the quaff. Not quite crisp enough to warrant a 'refreshing' title but it sure goes down smooth and quick. Its a good beer."
"I really enjoyed this beer and would drink again as a session brew."
"Simply put: much more than I was expecting, and an amazing surprise."
"Hops: Apollo, Willamette"
"Clear amber with a sudsy head of different size bubbles that leave fine lace on the glass. Smells of bubblegum malt and lightly toasted grain. Tastes good but too light in flavor to make it stand out. Caramel malt and apple juice nicely balanced by faint hop bitterness. Light, watery mouthfeel with crisp carbonation. An okay beer that is a little light for an Irish Red."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking but the aftertaste is a problem. I ended up bumping the drinkability up because I finished the beer with dinner, and the food stopped the aftertaste. I will drink the next one with a meal."
"D: Really, really drinkable stuff, as I've come to expect from most of Harpoon's stuff."
"D - A fairly average beer thats ok to drink not the best beer I've drank recently but far from the worst not bad worth a shot if you like the style"
"easily sessionable, nice easy flavors, won't knock your socks off but it's definitely worth a try"
"Pours a dark rose red and clear. Has an anemic whte head that disappears quickly into a thin collar. Slight laciness. Aroma has a lot of malt with a slight hint of citruis. Taste is sweet and a I picked up a lot of cereal grain. The aftertaste was on the tart side. Light and thin on the tongue, it has a little bit of carbonation. Flavor is mediocre, I feel this is an average session beer."
"Let's put it this way, If I was a party and some one kept handing me these I would drink them all night and enjoy them but if I was looking for a six pack to enjoy for a night this wouldn't be one I would be looking at...that sums it up..."
"D, notes: An easy drinking pint and not much more."
"D - This is a decent enough Irish Red. It's fairly well done with regard to craft, but there's not much interesting going on here. It might be a good gateway craft beer."
"Not a fan of this one. There are certain (metallic/chemicalish) detractors. It's a little harsh, as well. With all these ""complaints", it's still not ""bad", or ""horrible"" as it has an ""interesting spiciness and there is a maltiness to it. But, it's not ""good"" either."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. The pour is a clear brick red with a thin white head. The aroma is a bit grassy with a kick of hops. The flavor is fruity with a dry slightly bitter finish. Hibernian is light bodied with adequete carbonation. The beer is easy drinking."
"Purchased at Whole Foods in Birmingham. Looks good in a glass with amber overtones. Smells earthy with nut, vanilla, and caramel in the mix. Tastes exactly the same. While this beer is smooth and sessionable, there is just not a lot going on in the flavor department. Reminds me of a brown ale. Still better than most big macros out there."
"Crisp, clean taste. Slightly hoppy, very understated. Hits the front of the tongue. Very refreshing on the palate, thin mouth feel. Very drinkable."
"A really good Irish Red Ale. Very smooth and balanced as the hops do a good job of complimenting the malts. A good representation of the style. Recommended."
"Had a pint on tap at Goody Glover's in the North End. Served in a Harpoon Celtic Ale glass. Reddish orange color. No real head or any lacing. Smelled a bit doughy. Taste was pretty boring. Slight bit of citrus fruit and hops. Very thin. Easy to drink, but nothing memorable. I only ordered it because I was in an Irish bar and I haven't seen it on tap a lot. A boring seasonal."
"D- Easy drinking Irish red, nothing over the top. I enjoyed it but I would not seek this out."
"Good drinkability. It's soft and easy. Not my favorite Harpoon, I hope we get others. The two Leviathan's I've had were awesome."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer feels like i could easly drink a case of this in a sitting and if i could find it around where i live i would definately buy a case or two"
"D - nothing really offensive...nothing really outstanding...I could put a few of these back without thinking too much"
"Average amber beer. Nothing too bad, but nothing to recommend drinking it again."
"Overall - Decent beer that is very easy to drink."
"I don't understand why Harpoon re-branded their Hibernian Ale, but they didn't change anything with the formula, just the label. I wonder if the AOH had something to do with the changeover? At any rate, still a nice go-to red during the late winter/early spring months."
"Drinkability: Super-high. Could have several of these thanks to the tastiness and low abv. Happy St. Paddy's, indeed."
"Harpoon's Celtic Ale is not the most exciting beer, but you could do a ton worse. It's definitely a solid beer that should be really good on those cool rainy spring evenings. I would have enjoyed it more had I not been in a hoppy mood when I tried it. Don't expect an award winner, but this is a decent beer that's worth trying if you're not in the mood for hops."
"D - goes down pretty easy."
"Overall a decent beer, but much better if someone else buys it. Biggest positive is that it's better than Killian's."
"Overall- A huge letdown!"
"Drinkability is average at best. Not reccommended, in fact next time I'll pass. Not awful but I expect better."
"This is one really well rounded beer. Pours a nice head with some lacing. Heavy scented peat flavors on the nose. Very pumpkinesk spicey flavor on the palate. Quite complex. Creamy feel also on the palate. Nice beer to throw a few back with. Flavorful hops round it out."
"Poured a nice copper color with one finger of off-white head that faded with minimal lacing. Dominate smell is roasted malt, but I also get a hint of a slightly yeasty aroma as well. Taste is kind of nondescript. It has pretty good body, some slight bitterness, you can definitely taste the roasted malt, but nothing to spectacular. Finishes fairly fast with some slight drying. A fairly decent beer overall."
"Mouthfeel finishes on the dry side. Feels smooth, no real flaws here. The drinkability on this brew is pretty good. It went quickly with an appetizer, as MJ would say it is ""moreish"" Beer selection here wasn't great but I ordered another one so that must be saying something."
"Pours a bright red with a fluffy white head that leaves a nice thin layer and thick ring. Smell is mostly of bubblegum and circus peanuts. I have usually associated those with certain belgian yeast. There is a slight malt but no hops present in the nose. The taste is slight caramel with a decent hop presence. The fruity yeast aromas did not carry over much into the taste but there is a slight sweetness. The mouthfeel is a little thin and the carbonation seems excessive. Drinkability is so-so, the mouthfeel isn't great and the taste is a little off. I might be able to stomach a few of these but not going to revisit any time soon."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry and fruity scent that boasts of pale and crytal malt as well as yeast esters. It's not overly malty, yet it retains a minimal caramel sweetness. The taste is average. It has a dull malt character along with and equally dull finish. Harpoon makes the same tasting beer and keeps renaming it. Everything is dumbed down for the masses. It's a easy drink, but it's a very boring one. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. Harpoon beers continue to uninspire. Celtic Ale is the newest in a rotating lineup of middle of the road beers that just aren't that good."
"Drinkability: Yeah, I would drink this again. It is a safe beer. They didn't take any real risks here, so they didn't blow it on anything, yet Harpoon isn't going to knock anyone's socks off. A solid easy to poker beer for a Saturday Night with the guys."
"Gave this brew a try on tap last evening, it was poured to a nice amber color with a good-sized white head. Had some legs but left minimal lacing. The aroma was sweet on two fronts, seemed like a sweet malt aroma but also sweet wafts of fruit. Imagine it was the same thing just picking up slight variations, but who the heck knows. The flavor had a nice malt presence with a clear caramel feel as well as slight yeast like breadiness. While this brew was not overly spectacular it is well done and seems to be a easy drinking brew."
"the overcarb and late alchohol may make this a heartburn nightmare for those with reflux issues but it still taste pretty darn good compared to most in this style."
"Drinkable: There are other Irish Reds I would prefer to drink, but it's certainly not bad."
"Nice drinkable Irish Red, I think."
"What ever happened to Harpoon Hibernian? Is this a rename or a completely different recipe recipe?"
"This a real good irish red. A seasonal beer that is well bodied and has a nice even feel to it."
"Nice looking beer.. a nice copper color with nice head to it and lots of ascending bubbles. Smell is very much of caramel and malts.. nice smell. Taste is little simple but solid.. again hints of caramel, but a little too macro tasting as a previous reviewer stated. Reminds me of Bud American Ale. Nothing great, but a nice solid drinker."
"This beer has a nice amber color to it. The smell is pretty subtle, but the malts are a little more noticable than the hops. The taste was very good and consisted of a good balance between malts and hops. A nice wheat flavor also poked through with a bread/carrot cake type of a flavor. It finishes pretty smooth and is a pretty good beer in my opinion"
"Light bodied, creamy feel. I feels more substantial than... it probably is, for lack of a better term."
" Drinkable, but limited."
"D: This is easy to drink, although it's somewhat thin and one-dimensional. Like many other Harpoon offerings, it's a bit above average across the board, but nothing stellar."
"Drinkability: Decent enough Irish red, but nothing really special at all. It looks really good, but the taste falls short."
"Taste is malty, sweet and pretty clean. Not much in the hop department, but enough to balance this one out pretty good."
"so I'm at the beer store and I'm picking up a couple of beers I'd been looking for and there in the cooler is this harppon celtic ale. can't recall seeing this before so I figured why not. pours a nice red color with a solid white head. taste is malt, tea and an oxidized note. light bodied and proably if it had not come across as oxidized, it would've been nice with dinner."
"D: Ok, but wouldn't rush out to buy a sixer of this anytime soon. Drinkable but not really exciting."
"Drinkability is good. Nice contrast to dark-colored macros calling themselves Irish reds."
"2/16/2005. Pours an amber color with a moderate head and some lacing. The aroma is sweet and malty. Easy drinking but not quite as flavorful as I thought it might be. Could be because I was overpowered by Smuttynose Barleywine last night and this now seems watery. Either way, the flavor was sweet with some malts. Good but not a great beer."
"mouthfeel is slight spiciness, bitterness, fruit, light and drinkable with a lot of flavor - one of the best reds i've had in a while and definitely a good take on the style."
"I love Celtic crosses & staffs, very cool! Too bad this is only a season beer."
"D- Nothing special here easy drinker."
"It's drinkable."
"Pours a nice red color with good head and some very nice lacing. Very light scent, a good malty sweetness, but it's not very strong. Good taste, a nice malty flavor, with good sweet overtones and a slightly sour finish. Goes down fine, if a little over carbonated. Not a bad Irish red, a nice seasonal."
"Pours a deep orange/red color, a decent amount of foam sticking to the glass. Smells of malt and some fruit. Tasted of malt and sweet fruit and a whole bunch of other flavors--mostly some apple cider sticking out a bit. Just a tad too much apple for me, but other than that it's a fine red ale."
"12 oz. bottle with 6/11/08 ink-jet-printed on the side. The beer pours crystal-clear, auburn, with medium carbonation and two fingers of slowly-receding, tan head. Nice malty aroma, with sweet caramel and molasses backed by a light leafiness. Pretty similar on the palate, lightly fruity, with some late toasted malts. Light and dry on the palate, clean, with a bit of grassy/spicy hops in the finish. Easy to drink and true to style, but nothing earth-shattering."
"A nice session beer, nothing great, but good. Certainly more than just a decent beer. Fits the style nicely, just not my favorite type of ale."
"Pours nicely with an amber color and nice roasted smell. Good flavor with medium drinkability. I'd suggest Sam Adams Irish Red before this one."
"Taste is malty upfront, slight hop bitterness, nothing too complex for this red ale, easy going down with a good carbonation level."
"Overall, quite the drinkable beer. Drinks very similar to my current Scottish Ale that I brewed up recently. Solid malt flavors and low hop presence. A solid offering."
"Drinkability: The main problem with this beer is: if you told me it was Killian's I would've believed you, which isn't really a good thing, especially from someone like Harpoon, even though I have had many mediocre brews from them. That said, this is still pretty unimpressive. I think Harpoon needs to do their single barrel series and make it more widely available -- I'd like to see some experimentation. Otherwise, I'll pay two dollars less and order a pint of Killian's..."
"D - Standup job, I could drink several of these and be satisfied. Recommendation on this one for sure."
"A lot of flavor to soak in here for a normal strength beer. A sensible seasonal on their part for the Boston area, this ended up being a more than just a decent beer."
"D = This is definitely an easy drinking beer, but at the end of the day it does really stand out much for me, only slightly better than average."
"D: not bad. I'd certainly have again"
""
"would drink again"
"Pours a dark amber, dark caramel color with just a quarter inch of off-white head, excellent clarity. A very buttery, lightly toasty aroma comes through with some toffee like character as well. An almost oaked, vanilla note as well, kind of strange. On the palate, a complex malt profile comes through. A range of orange, bready, biscuit, and toffee notes are in there. Finishing slightly smoky and floral, with a burnt, bitter feel. The roastiness of this beer is deceptive given its light shade, but overall, an interesting beer."
"Definitely a session beer but a little heavy for my taste."
"Appearance copper amber in color one finger tan head and some lacing, would have liked a bit more head retention though. Smell caramel and malt thats about it. Taste caramel malt grain and a touch of spicy hops in the finish to balance. Mouthfeel a bit light in body mediem carbonation. Drinkability a nice beer to share a evening with friends."
"D: Good. Fairly light in ABV (5.4%) and no heavy flavors helped this one go down pretty easily, though personally I'd prefer a little less big-bubbled carbonation to make it smoother and creamier."
"I consider this one great irish red ale. An all around good beer from start to finish."
"Verdict: A highly drinkable Irish Red Ale. It's what I expect from Harpoon and perfect for the spring season."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is solid 'medium' weight with light but persistent carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. I wish there were just a bit more character in the taste but this is very enjoyable just the same."
"Drinkability: Pretty good beer, it would be easy to drink one after another. I would recommend it."
"D: I like this one. Nothing stands out by itself in this brew and I think that's a good thing. Well-balanced all the way through. No off flavors or metallic taste for me either. I could have a few of these."
"D: Overall it's a nothing great. The flavors in the beer goes together well and is easy to drink. I probably wouldn't drink too many of these because I didn't like it that much because of the metallic taste. Yet it isn't a bad beer."
"12 ounce bottle, says best before 5/1/08. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like caramel malt, bread/grain, and a bit of hops. Aroma is nice, but a bit weak. Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma is. It tastes like toffee, caramel, toasted malt and a bit of hops in the finish. But it's a mostly malty sweet beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium with good carbonation and a bit of chewiness. Drinkability is good too, the smoothness makes it easy to drink. Not a bad choice as a session beer, IMO. Overall I think this is a pretty decent beer, I'd buy it again."
"Very drinkable but not the best red ale."
"This beer poured a copper color with a single-finger orangey tan head. The smell is pretty weak, with maybe some sweet malts. The taste is very akin to a sweet bread. The malts provide sweetness all the way through with perhaps just a hint of hops towards the middle before it finishes with even more sweetness. The mouthfeel is thicker than I expected with a medium amount of carbonation. This would make for a nice desert beer, but I couldn't really imagine grabbing more than one or two at a time."
"Pours a clear, dark, amber red with a nice frothy head that retains pretty well. Smell is very sweet and earthy. Kind of a tang to the aroma as well. Taste is more sweet malts but rather thin in the middle and finish. Slight bitter hop finish. Slightly metallic. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would like. Good carbonation, and slightly dry finish. Fairly drinkable but was kinda let down by this one."
"D - This one comes across as average. Glad I got to try it. This would not be my first choice of beverage but still not too bad though."
"Pours a dark amber with red highlights and a nice off-white head with a decent amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. It smells of nice roasted malts and hops. Good aroma for an Irish Red. The taste is pretty good. A nice sweet and malty base finishing off with some eathier hops. Not bad for an Irish Red, but not what I was expecting. Still a good beer though. It has a nice mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation for a beer like this. It is also pretty drinkable as I could have a few of these and I would probably get this again."
"Another bonus from a guy at work who says....hey I got 4 cases of assorted brews here...want any? Well yeah....!! Smells like caramel and molasses. Pours to a dark cloudy reddish brown with trace head. Taste is thick and creamy, almost chewy, with a sweet start and a semi bitter finish. The bitterness is sharp but doesn't linger in the aftertaste. This starts out like an english ale but definitely finishes as an irish style amber. Well balanced, so far typical of harpoon brews, and that adds to a very high drinkability. This is a sessionor without a doubt."
"something new in my supermarket was this ; pours a clear brownish-amber w/ a fluffy head which dissipates quickly leaving moderate lacing in my pint ; very light smell, some hints of crystal malts and vinous alcohol present as well ; taste is a bit thin as well but rounded out by a grainy flavor and some hop flavor as well, tastes of poss. adjuncts linger underneath toasted malt w/ a touch of dark fruit ; a bit out of style, a bit thick for an irish red, but not cloying, not much co2 ; not on my top 10 but i'd drink it again..."
"Pours a dark amber with a touch of red. A fair amount of head and a lot of lacing. On the nose I got a touch of peach and a slight sweet edge. The taste is earthy and full. There are the typical hops and roasted malt on the mouth and the feel is a little bit thick, but good. Overall a nice brew. Worth trying, I suppose. But not something I will seek out again though."
"Drinkability: A fairly average Irish ale, that's all I'm saying."
"drinkabke?: very!"
"Got as an extra in a trade with johnnnniee - thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date of May 07 so slightly past date but not too much (was within date when I got but was sitting in back of fridge). Had a one finger head that quickly dissipated into a thin collar. Had a small fountain of carb in the center of the glass. Was dark copper amber in color. The aroma was solid malt with a slight hint of caramel. Not bad but didn't really excite. The taste was pretty good for a IRA. Good and solid from start to finish. I find IRA's to not be extremely flavorful but what they do have hits the spot and doesn't disappoint. Not exciting but satisfying (sorta like my wife) in its own way. Mouthfeel was solid with right amount of carb. Overall, a good session beer that worth trying if you can easily get your hands on. Preferably from a buddy's fridge and not your own pocket. (3.5, RB-TOT, Y, O)"
"D: Pretty drinkable. Not really what I would chose to drink on a regular basis, but not bad."
"Pours s reddish copper color, nice and clear with a nice pillowy cream colored head. Retains a nice film with some sticky lacing to the bottom of the glass. Smell is of caramel and biscuity malts. Taste is mildly sweet with the same malt characters as the nose, and a touch of bitter hops to balance out the back end. Also a bit of nutty flavor. Nice light mouthfeel with a very clean, dry finish. Overall while there is no wow factor with this brew it's a really solid, enjoyable red ale. I would definitely have this again."
"Nice amber/ red color with a soft off-white head. The aroma is mildly fruity with a little pastry dough. Good caramel and biscuit malt character with mild hop bitterness. Somewhat dry and nutty finish. A good beer to have right after work. I wish I saw this at more bars than Killians! This would be delicious on cask I'll bet."
"I really liked this. Clear red body with nice white head. Smell is very nutty and malty. Taste is the same. Nutty is what I notice with a nice malt backing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very low carbonation. Very smooth like most irish reds. This is a very drinkable brew and I reccomend it to those who enjoy smooth and nutty."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, decent representation of style, it isn’t the best beer that I’ve had in the style but it’s still very good. There’s nothing out of the ordinary here but it’s enjoyable in its simplicity."
"This is a decent brew, but it seems like I could guzzle one after another - something I usually wouldn't do. A bit bland, but very very easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The sheer slickness of this beer in the mouth is fantastic, but it's also a bit too active and gassy. The malts really deliver on this one, and I'd highly recommend anyone at least try it."
"D- I enjoyed this, it's not my favorite style, but I enjoyed this, I will likely buy this again!"
"I would think this would be an excellent crossover beer for folks new to the world of craft beers as well as a solid session beer for craft veterans. In many respects, I'm sorry that this is only a spring seasonal as I'd definitely prefer it as an alternative to the many summer wheat beers."
"Drinkability - This was St. Patty's day beer along with my other choice's that I bought. I could drink a bunch of these."
"I had lost a lot of faith in Harpoon and really didn't have high hopes for this beer, but I'm not going to lie, I really dig this beer. This will more than likely be my St. Patrick's day beer. It may not wow you but this beer really preaches the beauty of simplicity."
"This went down incredibly easily, and definitely could be sessioned, especially with some munchies. Nothing spectacular, but a good, enjoyable beer. I could definitely see this being a yearly session when its available, and again would probably be better surrounded by good friends at the pub with some appetizers. While I won't be buying a case of it, I would drink it again in a minute given the right setting. If you're in that setting, give it a shot."
"Taste is also a bit on the sour side. There are hints of caramel, grain, and maybe a slight hop presence, but overall the flavor is uneven and a bit bland. Mouthfeel is nice and full. This beer is sessionable, but that sour aftertaste kind of kills your desire for more. This isn't an awful beer, just not a very good one either. Average at best."
"Pours a rusty-orange hue with brass highlights and pristine clarity. Dense, pale biege three-finger head sinks to a marshmallow fluff cap- shows decent retention, and leaves spotty lacing. English hop and Munich malt nose, nothing offensive but nothing impressive either. Toasted pale malt sweetness is backed by dextrinous graininess in the first sip. A deeply earthen-herbal hop flavor balances, while leaving the aftertaste slightly dry but retaining a fair caramel taste. Light-medium/thinnish body gains some texture from dextrin which gives it a pleasent tannic bite- although not quite astringnet. The mouthfeel is mild but flavorful- with medium carbonation. Finishes biscuity with a comfortable level of residual sugar and mild English hop flavor. Quite a nice session beer- highly drinkable with a very agreeable expression of stye."
"I recently was introduced to Harpoons Hibernator by mistake and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It was presented to me as an IPA, but it was really a red ale. I was expecting an IPA and I found my first sip not only to be a surprise, but a pleasant surprise. It was really smooth and tasty. It was a nice pour with a rich foamy head. The aroma was a nice mix of fruit and caramel, but not overpowering. It went down very easily - light, tasty and very drinkable. Even though I was looking for an IPA I ended up sticking with this one for the whole time I was there. There was no aftertaste and it was easy on the pallet. Ill be looking for this one next time."
"Not a bad taste just not enough to make me want another."
"This is a definite St. Patty's Day beer. A good go at the irish red style, reminds me of Smithwick's but less creamy than I'm used too. That'd probably be fixed by a nitro pour, but anyways. Seems a little light in body for a craft beer, but I think that goes with the style. There's a mellow ester flavor from the yeast plus a touch of caramel and a little tang. Almost seems closer to a lager for some reason. Anyways if you want an irish red session beer, get a 6er or order a pint."
"Poured a crisp clear red with a quickly diminishing head. Aroma is somewhat malty with a bit of fruitiness but not too much. Taste holds up to the style very well. Good mouthfeel with a decent amount of carbonation. Decently drinkable beer for the style."
"Pours a nice red amber with a slight off white head. the smell is unoffending and slightly sweet. the first sip of this beer didn't really get my attention right away. but after a couple of glasses from the growler, it really started to grow on me. the taste is really well balanced with a real smooth finish. almost honey like. i think this is a real solid beer. very smooth, very middle of the road and very appealing to the masses. i dig it."
"Pours a nice clear amber color with two fingers of white head and decent lacing. Looks very appealing. Smells like tea with lemony notes, a bit of fruitiness and a decent sweet, malty backbone. Taste is also a bit like tea but more muted than the nose. A sweet, lightly toasted malt backbone and the appearance of bittering hops in the finish serve to round out this beer very well. Nice smooth mouthfeel with decent body and carbonation. As for drinkability I'm somewhat conflicted. On one hand this is a tasty brew that isn't too heavy. On the other I just can't see myself having more than two, maybe three, in a sitting and for me that says something. Overall this is a solid brew, not quite a session beer but certainly something I'd have if I had a few other beers to drink."
"12oz bottle from Shaw's. Amber-red translucent body with a little less than an inch of light tan head. Smells of malt and floral hops. Biscuit and caramel malt with some floral hop to support it. Creamy full mouthfeel. Pretty good ale. Nice malty ale."
"Pours a reddish brown, with a dark center and bright caramel edges. Only a collar of head remains after a few minutes. Aroma is definitely on the butterscotchy diacetyl side of things, although some nutty malts and fruity hops poke through in spite the diacetyl intensity. The palate, the palate. OK, I'm usually OK with a bit of diacetyl in my English style ales, but this is ridiculous. Diacetyl in the front, mid, and finish, along with some acidity first off and some grapefruity notes at the mid-palate -- but those last two things are overwhelmed by the big D. The finish dries out quickly. Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied, with good, medium carbonation that fills things out. Overall, this beer has only the minor trappings of a successful one (looks, mouthfeel). It's kind of like a hot girl who looks great and feels great in all the right places, but can't carry on a conversation and has poison for a soul. This is an abject failure of a beer IMO; I can only see someone enjoying this is they either a) have a strange diacetyl fixation or b) are blissfully unaware that the stuff exists."
"Beer pours with a nice thick head that eventually settles to a thin rim. Beer has some lacing which follows the beer down the glass. There is a metallic smell present, maybe a skunky batch? Otherwise, the smell is of amber and roasted malts. The taste is better than the smell, no metallic taste is present. Taste is of amber malt and a nice honey like aftertaste is present. The beer is balanced well, and is rather light in body, almost watery, with not a whole lot of carbonation. Overall this beer isn't bad, but it doesn't stand out either."
"it goes down pretty easy and you could drink two on a hot day"
"Sweet and malty at first followed by a hop kick midsip that is at times piney & floral. Malts creep back in for the finish with a fig/caramel quality."
"This beer was looking pretty good up untill I tasted it. It is about the color of a glass of tea. There was little head and no lacing. The taste is just too harsh. There is a negative bitterness that cannot be overlooked. It kills the entire beer. The mouthfeel is average at best. I could not drink this beer again. There are much better red beers."
"overall- i expected a little more hop presence with the style, but malt pretty much dominated the flavor. Its pretty easy to drink but after one i switched to something with more flavor."
"Pours light red, pretty translucent, moderate to light carbonation. Not much head. Smell is rather light, with hints of florals. Taste is not powerful, mild malts, hints of hops, caramels as well. Easy going down. Good if you want to down a few quickly. Quick and rather enjoyable."
"Taste is all about malt with a caramel overtone, very subdued hop flavor. Not a bad drinking brew, but not exciting enough to want me running back for more. Probably a good macro cross over beer."
"Happy St. Patricks to all"
"This beer pours an amber color with a frothy white head that fades quickly leaving a little lace and a little film. The smell is faint with sweet malts. The taste is malty caramel up front with some bitterness coming through at the end. The mouthfeel is a little thin with good carbonation. Overall moderately drinkable but not the best Irish Red Ale out there."
"I don't know. A decent beer, but sort of a MOR red ale aimed more for the Macro crowd that is willing maybe try a micro. Decent, but not my favorite from this great brewery."
"This could possibly make a good intro beer for getting someone into craft beers. Pleasant, unoffensive, very smooth, and definitely easy to drink."
"Mouth feel is a bit light and under carbonated."
"Overall: This is one of my favorites, I'd stongly recommend it to anyone, especially those who likes Irish red ales."
"An nice take on the Irish Red style. This beer poured a nice rich red/straw color (though, to be honest, the place was kinda dark). Not much in the way of head, only some lacing around the edge of the plastic cup. The taste was a nice and smooth, with not much in the way of hops, but with a nice malt characteristic. All in all, this would be a welcome addition to my St. Patrick's Day party."
"A nice full amber color, a big beautiful head that was an off white and lasted for quite a while. I know we aren't supposed to mention this but I love the artwork on the bottle itself. The smell was the worst aspect of the beer. I'm sure this sounds nuts to a lot of you, and probably extremely naive, but I don't like it when a beer smells like alcohol. It had a delicious flavor, but was not very carbonated. Other than that, I liked it very much. It was quite smooth going down and left a pleasant aftertaste. Overall I'd say this is a decent beer, not my favorite but I'd probably have another if the opportunity arises."
"Drinkability: I could drink an entire 6-pack of this without realizing it; it's that tasty."
"Harpoon Hibernian Ale pours a clear amber color with a thick light tan head. Aroma is malty, with some spicy notes, maybe a little grassy as well. Taste is bready, and malty with a slight tang and a slightly dry but not hoppy finish. Light mouthfeel, fairly highly carbonated. A good solid red ale, very drinkable. Not an awesome beer, but I have yet to find a red ale that is."
"This pours a dark red with a smallish tan head.The smell is very malty,but not much else. The taste is clear,crisp, and malty. The flavor has some nut and brown sugar to it,but the malt rules this beer. The m/f is light and ends with a slight watery aftertaste. This is a pretty good beer from Harpoon and I'd try it again."
"One of the better Irish Reds that I have had. Not being one of my favorite styles, I was skeptical. Has a bold toasted malt aroma with and under-riding hop scent and moderately spiced. Nice strong malt flavor that hits on toasty, dates, nuts, and a light brown sugar flavor. Hops balance out the sweetness well while lending a mild bitterness and spice flavor. Other spices such as nutmeg and ginger. The body is medium and balanced. Finishes lightly sweet with a slight bitterness and a lingering malt flavor. Pretty good stuff."
"This is pretty good for the style, given the style description on BA for the Irish Red Ale... not really for me though."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and bubbley, bordering on creamy. Slick near the end- very nice. I'd say this is pretty darned drinkable- it's tasty and not too heavy, it won't sneak up on you (assuming it sticks to style and is around 5%) and is pleasurable to drink- a good beer."
"This is the strangest red ale I've ever tried. Imagine was IIPA is to Pale Ale, Hibernian is to Red Ale. Somehow Harpoon isolated the ""Red Beer"" flavor and magnified x100. Lovely crystal clear dark burnt red, good muddy head too. Smell and taste quite overwhelming with the Irish Red Ale malts. The taste gets to you after a while and not in a good way. A nice beer to visit but I wouldn't want to drink this every day."
"Pours with an effervescent 1-finger tan head that quickly fizzles away. Body is a pleasing clear, copper with very subtle red highlights. There was no lacing. Nose is sweet with caramel malt and just a hint of spicey hoppage. Good carbonation up front, body is medium-full on the tongue, surprisingly not as sweet as the nose indicates, nicely balanced caramel and spicey Nugget hop. Goes down smooth, with a dry finish and lingering spicyness. Quality, but a pretty boring recipe, not interesting enough to want to pack a second into a session."
"- Hops: Nugget"
"Drinkability- Perfectly adequate red ale. But nothing special really popped into my head while drinking it."
"this beer pours a one and a half finger, creamy off-white head that persists for a decent while. it strongly laces the sides of the glass as the ale dissappears. the brew is dead-on style copper color and a fair amount of carbonation is evident to the eye. my nose picks up sweet malt and a light floral hop smell. This beer starts mildly sweet and finishes mildly dry and bitter. this beer does everything a bit too mildly. this is really good stuff but it seems could be great with just a little more umph! in all departments."
"Hibernian Irish Style Red Ale is a fairly lackluster offering from a brewery that is new to me (or at least to my taste buds). I know better than to judge Harpoon by one beer and will have no trouble trying other offerings as I run across them. For instance, there's an interesting little creation called Triticus, brewed by two brothers who know a thing or ten about beer, that I've been itching to try."
"poured a deep copper color with large off-white head. Smell is slightly sweet with a faint hint of hops. Taste is pleasant, but nothing outstanding with a slight hop bitterness at the finish. Let a mild dry taste in the mouth. Could be a decent session beer, both nothing outstanding"
"Unfortunately Harpoon seems like one of those brewers that just doesnt live up to their potential. The beers are consistent and well-made but the flavor just is not there on a lot of them. Seems to me they could easily be a GLBC or Bells caliber brewer if they would just decide they wanted all their beers to be less boring. Anyway this Killians-ish beer is clear amber with a thin ivory-colored head and minimal lacing. Caramel and malt aroma. Medium-bodied and dry with malt, caramel and light nut flavor. The finish is short and hoppy. Smooth and easy to drink, but again there should be more to this."
"Body is medium light with soda-like carbonation with a smooth and slick mouthfeel. Easy to drink, but forgettable."
"This is a quite drinkable, well balanced beer. I consider it middle of the road in regards to flavor."
"This is a nice offering from the Harpoon Brewery. Poured from a bottle, the head fizzes out fairly quickly. There is a half-moon ring on one side of the glass. The nose is good.. well, above average anyway. A little bit fruity (black cherries), malty, nothing really jumps out at me here. But it has a clean taste and smell.. a good pub ale for sure. I like most of Harpoon's beers, and this one is a good example of why. It isn't outrageously estery, malty or hoppy. It is however true to its style."
"This beer pours a copper color and produces a thin head. The smell is of light malt. The taste contained a bready maltiness, and had hints of cherry and banana, which yielded to bitter citrus hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was balanced. Overall, a pretty good beer, but not exactly earth-shattering."
"Overall = An OK beer but nothing spectacular; I'm slightly disappointed and can't really recommend it as it's not much of an improvement over Killians."
"Poors a red amber with an off-white headskie. Malty smooth, slightly sweet, and litely hopped this brew is. Drinkable, but not very special. Mouthfeel is solid. There are severial better New England reds around. Check out Rock Art's American Red as a better example of the style."
"Pours a white, one finger-head that goes quickly leaving no lace. Nice clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is slightly malty. Starts smooth with more malts than hops, some sweetness finishes quietly with no aftertaste. $7.49 for a 6-pack of 12oz bottles from Fred's Kwik Stop Concord, NH."
"1-inch pillow of initial, flocular head that dies quickly, leaving little trace. Washed out copper hue with a hint of brown tinge and clear with some continuous action and very fine stick. Kind of a jumpy sweetness on nose, but cant quite place it exactly, almost like a strawberry though I know it isnt; light malt backing. Some sweet caramel on mouth with an inner core of Granny Smith apple tartness. Finishes pretty quickly with a fairly light body  not inspiring, but also does not offend."
"A decent beer and easy to drink."
"coppery red with a light tan head that settles quickly. sweet malty aroma. toasted caramel, a hint of bublegum-like fruitiness. the same toasted caramel shows up in the taste, with the hint of bubblegum, and some other clean sweet flavor i can't identify, sort of a burnt sugar candied apple flavor, but that desciption doesn't quite do it justice. fairly light mouthfeel with prickly carbonation. good drinkability. a pleasant tasty beer, but nothing really stands out about it. good, but unremarkable."
"Quite drinkable due to how light this red is. A pretty average version of the style. What I was expecting from Harpoon."
"Has a medium mouthfeel. Feels nice on the tongue. This is a very drinkable balanced ale."
"Pours reddish(suprise) amber, slight white head, clear and no lacing. Sort of nondescript beer for my liking. This is a semi sweet brew, I also pick up a little ginger or mint. This just too dull a brew for me. No real character, nor of much interest. My wife liked it, she said ""'this is much better then all that crazy strong beer you like"" What can I say I like crazy strong, flavorful beer with some character. I wont buy this red ale stuff again anytime soon."
"Overall, this a nice Spring seasonal by a local brewery."
"This one pours a somewhat transparent amber color, with a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is a very dirty, earthy hop. I don't reallyl ike it. The flavor is bad. There is a funkey sweetness on the finish, that follows a dirty flavor. The mouthfeel is fairly thin and drinkability is pretty bad. I don't really want to finish this one."
"This poured out clean, clear and was an orangey-amber color. A large persistent head of foam rose out of the beer and left a nice lace on the glass. The aroma is semi-sweet with buttery malts and bitter orange notes. The taste is buttery smooth and flavorful. This goes down extremely easy. The body is solid and the finish is clean and leaves a pleasant tartness in the throat. The draft version was good, but this might be even better."
"I might try it if I found it on tap, otherwise not interested."
"The problem with this beer is that while it had the bitter foretaste the aroma promised, it mellowed out much too quickly. This was a good average drinking beer, but overall I wsn't impressed. I don't think I would go out of my way to have another."
"Clear, coppery amber in hue with a modest tawny highlight, no animation, the white head reached a half finger in height. The head retention was excellent as it sat like concrete and it had the same staying power. The subsequent lacing amounted to zilch. Still, this is a good-looking beer. The nose is way too clean, this is an ale right? Faint whiffs of nuts and trace amounts of caramel maltiness can be found, once I worked at it a little. The lack of smell removes any hope of an invitation. True, the nose is inoffensive but it is so damn lackluster! It is time to taste, even without an invite. Bland palate. I could end my comments on the taste right there. But I will elaborate a little. First of all, where is the biscuit-like maltiness? Hell, Id settle for some yummy caramel notes. All I get out of this beer is hints of nuts, some grassiness, a moderate bite of bitterness at the back and a large dose of cleanliness. How boring. Im not impressed; frankly it is too bland to be offensive. The mouthfeel is pleasant, the carbonation is modestly high but it seems fitting, medium in body but it could use more malt. Not only for bulk but also for flavor. It is very easy to drink, since nothing bothers to tickle the tastebuds before reaching the throat. This is a very, very run of the mill Amber Ale; nothing about it is memorable (in a positive light anyway). I can think of dozens of Ambers Id pick over this one. Regardless I never would have had the chance to try this if it wasnt for drweizen and BIF 5. Thanks!"
"Taste is above average, but unimpressive. Caramel and bready malts dominate, with a balancing, floral/herbal hops presence that provides enough bitterness to give this decent drinkability. Not one of the better Harpoon brews I've tried, but it's not bad, just average."
"Pure nastiness, this is horrid stuff. Another dumper from the folks at Harpoon. After 4 brews from this brewery, I have no interest in ever having their beer again, and will warn my friends to stay away. Down the drain it goes. Avoid at all cost."
"It is ruby colored with a brownish tint and an off-white head that lasts. The aroma is very fruity with some malt and caramel. Banana and cherry are among the fruity flavors I detect with the esters. The medium to full body has little to hop character, but there is a bitterness that helps balance out the maltiness. An easy drinker, but not my favorite."
"There's something alluring about the appearance of red ale. Harpoon's has smooth, complex flavor that's a little bitter with overtones of caramel and hops. The smell isn't so great; it's as if the beer has gone a bit bad, but that's misleading. The carbonation is just about right all of which makes this a fine beer for repeated offerings."
"While ales are not usually my type of beer, I found this too be a very drinkable beer. Great appearance, good aroma, good taste, and a lasting impression. If you get a chance try this beer."
"Great little spring brew. I'll definitely get some more."
"Very nice spring beer."
"It was a ruby color with a small head that left a little lace on the side of the glass. Faint malty aroma, but not much overall. Great tasting, with the malts most notable, but a good balance of hops too. High drinkability, wouldn't have minded having a couple of these. Went great with my Halibut dinner."
"Pours a nice caramel ruby amber tone forms nice caramel tan off white head forms a collar of lace around my pint not bad eh? Aromatics going on instantly are caramel nut toasted malts with very appetising fruit tones dancing around in there mild hop dosage what an amber should be except for HopBack. A very strong malt backbone compromises the main taste here with some fruit almost sugary fruit notes and toasty malts nice mix mild hop bitterness nice amber ale. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied very reserved carbonation nice beer. Drinkability factor here yeah I could enjoy few of these beauties without a problem."
"Light bitterness, light to medium feel. Interesting spring seasonal, I like it in a half and half with Guinness."
"Pours out to a dark amber in the glass with a very, light, brown head. The aroma is that of malt and smells fresh. The taste is very good. There is a wonderful, sweet malt taste here, that is very lightly balanced by the hops. Its tastes lightly sweet and is very refreshing. A fine example of the Amber/Red style."
"After all is said and done, this beer is flavorful and very drinkable. I think it would improve if it were slightly fuller in body and more complex in flavor."
"Smooth, but like all of the style, fall short of greatness."
"This beer had a nice amber color and a nice malty smell. However, it is boring. If memory serves, the style is a tad boring, but I'm not going to hold it against the beer. Not too much going on with the taste. A malt profile with a nice taste, but not too complex. But it was a nice beer to remember Saint Patrick with."
"A fine session brew."
"23oz pour from tap in a large fluted pilsner glass. Nice head on top of a deep reddish-brown liquid. Pleasant mouthful of malt, with an appropriate amount of hops to balance. Smell somewhat guessed, as in a bar/smoking atmosphere, and my nose isn't the best under optimal conditions. Definitely worth the trouble to try this beer, great sessionability."
"This is a lively brew with a noticeable Scotch-like alcohol. Interesting."
"Had this on tap at Redbones. Pour was a clear amber. Aroma was rather clean. Taste was more of the Oktoberfest variety: rather malty. I detected some husky notes as well. Pleasant, but over-all not earth-shattering, could make a nice session beer for a change."
"Harpoon Hibernian Style Ale was a dark copper/ruby color with a moderate head. It had a nice fragrant hop aroma. The taste was slightly sweet (caramelly with traces of coffee) and citrusy (orangey). The finish was dry and citrusy. Overall it had a nice smooth blend with good carbonation and a good hop bite. I'd have another."
"Notes: Pretty good beer to drink four or five of. Very drinkable. A bit decieving on the body side, considering how sweet the aroma is."
"thin watery mouthfeel, little carbonation, little hops, but nice sweet lip-smacking maltiness that goes down easy. very drinkable and non-offensive to just about any beer drinker."
"Well Harpoon has consistently underwhelmed me with almost all of their beers and I have to say this is no exception. First of all, I know this site has had some reconfiguring of the beer styles but there's no way this is a ""pale ale/bitter."" It's an Irish red ale and there is no mistaking it. It's also a pretty mediocre one, which is tough going because I have always found Irish reds to be a pretty mediocre style in general. While not as initially repugnant as Harpoon's ESB, this is still pretty unlikable. Malts have a nice base to them, and a twinge of smokiness is brought out by the hops, but there is a huge soap flavor that Harpoon's other beers have. It wrecks the beer, and since Irish reds are usually delicate and mild, the off flavor is overpowering. No more Harpoon for me please. I've heard they are currently kicking it up a notch and making more interesting beers (not that it means they will be better) but I probably won't try them unless the word is that they're truly kick ass. And they're free."
"Not much aroma, just an indefinite sweetness. Taste was a little better, mostly malty sweetness, and just a wee bit of hops trying valiantly to hold back the malt. Thin, but not too thin mouthfeel. The hops make themselves known more in the finish, but not overtly so. Pretty drinkable, I didn't have to force myself, a good alternative to macros, and would probably be good for educating macro drinkers to better beer."
"Flavor is not very strong, and the body is a bit thin, but it is still pretty enjoyable. A lot of sweet fruitiness with a mass of grains start you out. It then gives a bit of a hoppy flavor, but nothing to die for. I was not impressed, but I would probably drink it again depending on my other options."
"Even with the odd flavor, this isn't horrible, but I won't spend money on it again. Perish the thought of celebrating St. Paddy's day with it, as the bottle suggests."
"Decent pour that yielded a choppy and soapy looking white head.Trails of lace left as head settled.The color is darkish red.The mouthfeel was very crisp and clean.A light refreshing and somewhat watery texture.A malty and biscuit-like taste.An average aroma of biscuit and malt.More hops and malt would help this Ale alot.Has almost a mass produced beer taste.Its ok but not worh buying again.Try again Harpoon."
"Says on label its an Irish Red but mine seemed to be more copper,but anyways left hardly no head when poured.A little bit of clove or cinnamon in the smell also picked up some wood-likw smell.To me the taste had some smokiness to it,it was very malty sweet as well wich I liked.Nice mouthfeel cant drink to many of this style though kinda sits in my stomach.A pretty good American style Irish ale though."
"The initial color is that of Killians. A red/copper color. The taste is total malt with an overabundance of caramel sweetness. The first time I tried this I loved it. The second time I had a hard time finishing it. It is rather bland and it seems like something is not quite right in the balance. Head vanishes quickly and you are left with a glass of malty syrup it seemed."
"It has quite a stong aroma, a hint of cinnamon to start and strong alcohol overall, very inviting. Colour is a reddish brown and quite rich. To taste it is very sweet, strong malt profile and a nice hop bite to balance. There is an unfortunate watery finish and aftertaste which detracts, body is quite thin too."
"Cheers"
"Hazy amber in color with a very thin head. Scoth-ale like sweet, caramel malt aroma, with a hint of fruitiness. First sip is pleasantly sweet with a big malt presence. The remainder of the flavor is fairly unremarkable, save for what I find to be a rather off-putting astringent finish. A bit rough on the tongue, and not something I would recommend."
"Overall I will not buy this again. Looked better than it tasted."
"A good but not great beer, pours a nice coppery color and a decnet reddish head.  The aroma just isn't there but has a pleasant taste and is easy to drink, reminded me of Killians but a step above............CHEERS"
"And if we're going to compare Harpoon Spring Seasonals, I'll vote for the long gone Stout, over this, the Maibock, and anything else they have had."
"Medium-dark amber color with a rich tan head when poured from the tap.  A pleasant blend of malty and hoppy aromas and more of the same in the flavor. An enjoyable, above average amber/red ale."
"Judge the beer for what it is (a very drinkable Irish ale) rather than what it's not (spring Maibock).  Let's face it, it's not the most complex style out there, but this beer is head and shoulders above the other mass-produced Killians, etc out there.  Very clean and drinkable, good at a party when you don't want to have to think about the beer too much."
"Notes: Harpoon replaced their Spring Maibock with this beer. I put that aside. They come out with an ""Irish-style red ale", which is so typical. I put that aside. What's left? In my opinion a damn fine ale. It's balanced. It's simple. It's easy to drink. It has appeal."
"I have been waiting a while to try this one and now i wish i hadn't. It's not that great. I was expecting a heavier bodied ale, with a a creamy caramel maltiness to it and instead it was rather weak tasting. It went down easy with not much to think about when you drank it, which is probly what they were shooting for when they made it. I can't believe they replaced their spring mai bock with this."
