Mildly hopped water with a hint of grain is how I would describe this. Maybe it tasted better before Molson Coors bought it. Who knows. But this doesn't really taste much like beer. It's lack of carbonation makes its thinness even more noticeable. That mouthfeel of cold flat water makes it refreshing, but lacking in any beer-like quality.","ElCommodoro","Aug 30, 2011"

A finger of nitro-assisted white head is there and doesn't dissipate at all. Some very mild lacing. Some floral hops with a lot of caramel in the smell. Flavour actually has more bitterness than I remember, some sweetness as well. Creamy mouthfeel from the nitro. This is an ok beer, nothing special though.","kwjd","Feb 11, 2011"
3.38,3.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Notes from Old Chicago (2001): A beautiful pour from a nitro-keg. It takes forever to separate. When it does, it is a clear red-golden with a creamy nitro-infused head. The aroma is very mild. Much better in terms of flavor. While still a bit mild for my tastes, it has a definite apricot note that I rather enjoy. As would be expected given the means of dispensation, it is very clean and smooth on the palate. It lacks a certain richness but it's not bad overall.","CuriousMonk","Feb 09, 2011"

I didn't get much in the way of aroma but the toffee and malt flavour was really enjoyable. Carbonation is low and very fine. The problem with this is quaffability. I can smash down a whole pint before I can even taste it so drinkability is huge. There's not a whole lot going on in terms of complexity and it is a bit watery but this suits me as long as the flavour is there and though the toffee and caramel is subdued it's still there and balanced. Good but not great.","rjimlad","Dec 27, 2010"

The head stays down to the bottom of the glass and leaves good lacing; classic nitro, except for the odd whistling farty noise when I opened the can. Smell is faint, with floral hops and some caramel as well. Taste is caramel and roasted malts, with a slight hop finish. The mouthfeel is pretty thin and watery, and flat as well, but not terribly so. It just lacks the usual creaminess that is the upside of the trade off between appearance/mouthfeel and taste/smell.

For the life of me, I can't smell a damn thing from this beer. Had to smell some food to make sure my nose was actually working. Not sure what to make of that. The taste doesn't really taste like much, sorta like the guinness nitro cans, except not near as sweet. It's slightly bitter, and a very very faint toffee flavor, but not much else at all. Mouthfeel is great, it's really creamy, again, it could almost pass for real cream. I probably won't be getting this again.

Great head retention and it leaves a thick lace on the glass. The aroma is quite muted, but there's some caramel maltiness, a hint of fruit, and some floral hops. The mild flavour is matched by low bitterness. Caramel malt and light fruit start things off, with hops kicking in towards the finish. Low carbonation (of course) with a light body and a dry texture, especially as it warms. This is a great session beer, especially on nitro-tap... not very complex, but tasty enough to have several.","DrJay","Oct 07, 2005"

Flavour contains a cidery apple/pear along with sweet, almost bready malt. A bit of hops come out on the finish, but are slight.

Unfortunately the taste and smell does not match the appearance; the smell is stale and the taste somewhat hard to define, but definitely leaving a sense of sourness.

The seperation it does in the beginning is just like Guinness, which is another great beer in my book. Anyways, the finish is nice a sturdy, but light at the same time. It's not stouty or bitter, which I think is the reason it makes a great "starting out" beer.","JISurfer","Dec 24, 2002"
3.74,14.7,5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Great head creation and retention from the Nitro can. A pinky finger width head stuck with the beer all the way til it was gone. I was very impressed by that. Has a very alluring redish orangish color to it. If this beer were a woman she would be a supermodel. Flavor was good but disappointing. Tasted a little watered down but that may just be the style; I have nothing to compare it to. Kinda hoppy and bitter. Fragrance is a reflection of that.","allboutbierge","Dec 05, 2002"
3.26,0,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Wow what a different brew in England. I still am not a huge fan but the brew is improved on tap and fresh. It took 3-5 mins. to settle. Slightly sweet nose. Thick white persistant head. Sweet chewy malt taste with the usual hop metalic finish. This is what I dislike the tin-like finish to this brew. It was less watery than the can but still not a stand-out!","frank4sail","Dec 03, 2002"
3.5,7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Tried this one in a steak house. Pours a light reddish colour topped by a thick white head that settles rather easily. It's a fairly refreshing beer with nice smell and i wonder why this Ale is not found in every pub in Cyprus. Only some selective pubs or steak houses have this beer","ipogios","Nov 13, 2002"
3.86,18.4,4,3,4.5,4,3.5,"Caffrey's on-tap is less creamy than the nitro can, but seems to be more substantial.  A decent session ale that is quite quaffable.  (review taken from notes before Coors pulled the plug on the brand in the U.S.).","proc","Oct 02, 2002"
3.11,-4.6,4,3,3,2.5,3.5,"The nitro can pours out a beautiful looking brew... cascading creamy copper-gold, which eventually becomes translucent with a persistant thick white head.  The flavor and aroma are somewhat hoppy, but very little bitterness.  Overly creamy mouthfeel, bordering on flat.  This is a brew that is slightly better than average, but doesn't have enough complexity to keep me interested.","zerk","Sep 23, 2002"
3.55,8.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Typical nitro pour, this one was lighter colored and not quite as pretty to watch as some.  When settled the head is 1/4 inch with hanging murkiness beneath.  A little sourness to the yeasty aroma.  Velvet mouthfeel, pretty good toffee-like malts and a trace more hoppiness than some.  Drinkable enough, but aside from Young's Luxury Double Chocolate, I'm geting pretty bored with these nitros...just not enough flavor.","ADR","Aug 15, 2002"
3.06,-6.1,4,3,3,3,3,"Excellent pour that started out butterscotch-colored then settled into the more typical Ale hue. Creamy almost to a fault, as there was not much of a beer flavor to it at all. Slightly tannic, and overall the flavor does not live up to the looks.","Dogbrick","Jul 18, 2002"
4,22.7,4,4,4,4,4,"A very good Irish beer.  Nice and thick although light in color.  It has a head that really sticks to the glass all the way down.  Very sexy.  A well rounded brew that is balanced in aroma and flavor.  Prost!","goindownsouth","Jul 09, 2002"
3.21,-1.5,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Looks very nice, with a thick cloudy appearance similar to Guinness, but obviously much lighter. No smell or special taste to speak of, but certainly not bad. Very easy to drink.","IrishRedRock","Jun 20, 2002"
2.83,-13.2,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Decent head, creamy, Caramel tastes, hints of homey and malt. It was way too watery though. bland bland bland.","Anonmatel","May 31, 2002"
3.29,0.9,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sweet/fruity taste. Smells burnt but very very lightly. Creamy and quite drinkable although somewhat thin. These widgets are heaven-sent.","packetknife","Apr 27, 2002"
3.4,4.3,4,4,3,3,3.5,"another amazing nitro head, and plus it has pleasant burnt fruit like aroma that i always like, which translates itself to a faint grape flavor in the mouth.  pretty creamy and smooth, but with an extremely thin mouthfeel.  if this had some more body it would be awesome.  malts and hops are there but the watery aspect of the body really robs the essence of the beer.  chuggable nonetheless.","budgood1","Apr 14, 2002"
2.1,-35.6,2,2,2,2,2.5,"creamy and bland, but i suppose its drinkable, but its creaminess doesn't really appeal to my tastes, had it on tap and from the can, they both tasted the same.","rastaman","Apr 03, 2002"
3.56,9.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This ends up to be a beer that needs to be consumed quickly. It loses its luscious texture the more the nitro pulls away from the liquid.","Jason","Mar 14, 2002"
3.18,-2.5,4,3.5,3,3,3,"I also had this hand-pumped in England; it was the house beer at the local pub, and it was smooth and creamy beyond belief, with a subtle caramel sweetness to cut the edge off the bitterness. I was thrilled when they finally started selling it here, but was quickly disappointed; too watery, and not much flavor, an average beer at best. Perhaps it's not fair to compare what you get here in a can with what you get there at a pub, though.","mophie","Feb 14, 2002"
3.95,21.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Notes: I don't care what anyone says, Caffrey's is a fine beverage and so easy to put down that it often scares me. A Friday lunchtime favourite for my buddy Dee and I. We always have 2 or 10.","Todd","Apr 02, 2001"
