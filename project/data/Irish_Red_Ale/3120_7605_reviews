"My hope is that this was the result of the pour or equipment because everything else I have had from Alpine has been top notch. I will try again in a different setting."

"This is a sleeper in Alpine's year round lineup. The malt mouth in all of us should give McIlhenney's Irish Red a chance."
"Not my kind of beer. I hate writing these shoddy reviews but the ""outlier"" system  sort of forces my hand"

"Smelled caramel, chocolate, roasted nuts, toffee, faint coffee malts, dark cocoa, chocolate syrup and light copper. Very impressive for the style. Got chocolate, bitter roasted nuts, caramel, toffee, copper or another metallic malt, dry rye malts and faint coffee malts. Medium body. Oily texture. Average-to-lively carbonation. Nutty, bitter finish."
"3.87 | 87 | B+"
"Ruby amber hue. Good sweet malt, burnt carrot, hints of brown sugar. Yeast, slightly sweet. Not as beefy, but solid Irish Red"

"Pours a hazy dark reddish-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and slight fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, burnt sugar, caramel, and earth flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid toast and caramel qualities that come through slightly better in the taste to me."

"O- one of the best Irish ales i have ever had. Nice complexity in a style that tends to lack it at times. Big malt character that drinks easy."
""
""
"Overall just a real fine easy drinking Irish ale, it's nearly perfect."
""

"T/M: A chewy, bready complexion carries toffee sweetness, with the cherry aspect detected in the nose more pronounced here. Toasted grainy with notes of dry grass and a touch of hop astringency balancing at the back of the palate, keeping in line with the style. Finishes long and sweet."
"Overall - Not many Irish Reds are very exciting and this is no exception. It is well made, though. No trouble sharing this bomber."

"Overall - Interesting brew, the mouthfeel makes this maybe worth a shot. Very unique in the land of Irish Reds but not anything to write home about, strange overall."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice Irish Red from Alpine, but obviously this isn't going to turn any heads when compared to their hoppy line up. Still a nice beer for someone who likes a sessionable, malty beer."

"O - The flavor just seems off on this one. Some weird berries don't go well with the rest of the beer."

"This makes me wonder about the medals at beer-judged events, if this won gold anything anywhere. I don't see that we, the Great Unwashed horde of BAs, like this so much. On the cask at the Linkery in San Diego."

"M: Medium bodied."
"O - A tasty red. A little sweeter than a typical red. Very drinkable, since its a pretty low ABV"
""
""
"Fuller bodied than expected with a balance of crisp hops and sweet malts. Hoppier than expected up front with dry spiciness and subtle earthy, floral notes.backing malt backbone with lots of sweetness. Hints of caramel, toffee rye, hazelnut, apricot and other light fruit. Well balanced and very drinkable."
"O: Very malty, enough so that it's fatiguing to drink anywhere near a pint. Maybe it's the style, but I don't really see myself drinking much of this again."
"O: This is a pretty straightforward ale that is quite refreshing and not difficult to enjoy. I've been wanting to try some stuff from Alpine for a while and this will encourage me to continue my pursuit."

"T: Taste is almost more along the lines of a nut brown than a red. Big and malty. A hint of orange zest upfront followed quickly by big, nutty malts. Lots of breadiness as well. A decent red, but not as bold as I was hoping for."
"O: Wonderful malty flavors. Really refreshing and enjoyable, and thankfully not super sweet."
"The taste is fairly sweet - brown sugar and caramel, tempered by rye and with a bready taste. The mouthfeel is thin with medium carbonation. While this is a fine stab at the style, with so many great beers from this brewer, this one missed for me. Not a bad brew at all, this just isn't a noteworthy offering."
"Cheers..."
"Overall the beer is pretty good. I really think the 10 IBUs is really what is keeping this beer from being a pretty great beer. I think it's seriously lacking character and maybe dry hopping would just set this beer above and beyond."
"Drink- Im glad I got to bring a bottle home. Normally i really like what Alpine does but this was thin and off flavored for me. I probably wont come back to this one."
"O - This is a good beer overall its easy to drink with a good taste not sure its worth the price in bomber form but if you see it on tap its worth getting to try"
"Pours a reddish brown, without much head to speak of. I poured very aggressively and this beer seems lightly carbonated as no head formed. (the mouthfeel also has a pleasant light carbonation. Nose has simple caramel and lightly roasted malts with maybe a little coffee/toffee as well. Taste is a tasty mouthful of different malts. Really from light breads through rich caramel and finishing with a touch of dark roasted malt. Good beer for the style though you could give me a newcastle and i would be sadly just as happy."
"This is an easy drinking brew. It is medium bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. Very smooth throughout with plenty of malt and balancing hop flavors. A very solid representation of the style, I would drink this again."
"O- Very surprising beer, did not know what to expect, very sweet, wonderful malt characteristic, very easy drinkability, a perfect beer to have for dessert."
"D: Alpine brews a few different amber ales--this one, as well as Alpine ale--that are remarkably similar. This Irish red ale is malt-forward, never extreme, and just what one might expect from one of Alpine's less abundantly-hopped beers. It pairs well with a variety of food flavors, reminding at times of New Belgium's ubiquitous Fat Tire--but with less overbearing biscuit flavor than that other beer."
"Light head, crests at maybe half a finger, between cream white and the lightest tan, a lot of larger bubbles with not so much foam, lacing about as non-existent as can be and have still momentarily been there. Lighter amber red color with orange rims and glass bottom, damn close to fully transparent, widespread bubbles quickly kick upwards. The nose is fairly airy and light with a soft malty, caramel, molasses, honey, cocoa and pie flake core, not that sweet but sweet enough red cherry, grape, apricot, apple, pear fruit scents to outweigh the grass, hay component, citrus stays in the background, the stuff is there to be more appealing, however, simply isn't clearly keen on taking many steps to please. Medium-bodied and on the soft side, an amiable jiggle and ""more to love"" going on, still the carbonation tries to add more precision and leanness, if ultimately failing. Good deal of cocoa, milk chocolate powder with caramel mixed in, powdery texture yet sweet. The lemon, orange citrus is tart and lacks the zest to persist to the end. Bready, more towards rye or maybe pumpernickel than whiter dough. Faint metallic earthy ring. Tenuous apricot, peach, nectarine, apple fruit. Not flawed, in the end commits the cardinal sin of just being boring."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little below average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a really cool, unique and good beer overall. I really liked all the different malt flavors in it and they all really came together nicely."
"Not terribly exciting, but drinkable and good for the style."
"D - A really nice beer all around, perhaps my favorite Irish Red. Very very well made."
"Bottle, home. This beer is okay, but it's a disappointment coming from Alpine. This beer is bright orange rust in color with a small dissipating head, white. The aroma is a nice mix of malt flavors. It's hard to pick out too many individual malt notes because the caramel dominates, but chocolate and a touch of fruit peak out. Hops are almost nonexistent. The flavor is the real downer. It starts out almost rich and sweet with malt flavors but that quickly fades into an odd mess of sickly sweet and off-kilter light roast bitterness. The mouthfeel is also odd and not so great. I wish that this beer had a bit more hops or a bit more direction with the malt. It's not bad or anything, but this isn't a direction that I particularly like. All that said, I still firmly believe that Alpine is awesome."
"D - This is not a very complex beer but Irish Reds aren't usually but it is very drinkable."
"Poured out clear deep copper with thin off white head. The aroma has sweet malty caramel and lightly roasted malts along with a light smattering of hops. The flavor is much like the aroma with sweet caramelized malts, roasted malts and light hints of vague hoppiness. It ends with less sweet roasted malts. Nice malty brew."
"Poured a dark amber with a nice double-finger head. Some nice lacing as I work my way through the glass. The smell is of sweet malt, and is fairly complex, as is often the style with a good Irish Red Ale. The taste is all malt, with only the faintest hint of hop bitterness. I can definitely see the insane number of different malts in this, as the taste is fairly complex. Nice and medium-bodied and very drinkable, especially for a style that's not one of my favorites."
"Overall it is a tasty beer. Better than alot of reds I have had but for sure not the best. I wouldn't seek it out unless Reds are your style but it is a good beer to grab if you see it."
"Notes: This is a solid Irish Red that left a good impression on me. It's got a good nose, flavor, and mouthfeel that comes together to make this beer quite drinkable, but not necessarily sessionable for me because of its sweet nature. You can tell the guys at Alpine know what the hell they're doing! Very solid"
"D- Although not a session beer in my opinion, I could drink a couple of these babies over a couple of hours. Truly, this is a new favorite of mine from Alpine. Good work guys!"
"This beer poured a deep red amber color with a fast falling off-white head. Minimal lacing and not a lot of retention. You can smell the caramel malts, a bit of toast, and a slight trace of floral hops. Not really an Irish Red, more like a hoppy American Amber. Had a sweet malty front with a subtle hop bitterness. A medium bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation. A decent beer but not really an Irish Red."
"This one took me by surprise a bit. Nicely flavored for an Irish Red and the drinkibility was right on! I didn't get to drink any ""Irish"" beers the day before on St. Patties Day, so this was a nice belated pint to celebrate with."
"D: A good beer, I really liked the flavour initially, but over the whole 22 oz. the sweetness did become cloying and hard to drink at times. Still looking at the overall picture, it was a nice pint. Glad to try it. A bit more hop character would have helped for sure."
"Taste confirms my suspicions and offers a welcome light yet complex malt flavor. Roasty up front, segueing to a clean finish and a dry aftertaste. Hop bitterness is less than anticipated given the nose. Offers a good carbonation level which fits the beer well. Drinkability is above average for the style due to the relative lightness of the malts. A nice Irish Red that doesn't smother things with excessive malt notes."
"Notes from 12/12/05"
"Note: This beer is far better as it warms, IMO. Sweeter, more complex, riper aroma."
"D- I have recently realized that I like reds. For me this is the measuring stick."
"On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. Pours a pretty dark but clear red, with lots of streams of carbonation present. The overall impression here is it's more of a toasty brew, less smooth but more flavorful than other macro irish red's I've had. There is a distinct hop bitterness in the finish making it feel somewhat harsh. It was ok though, a good compliment to a pepperoni pizza."
"Other than Mandarin Nectar (which is okay), I have been supremely impressed by Alpine beer. Pure Hoppiness is one of the best DIPAs that I've ever had and Alpine Ale is a damn fine APA. McIlhenny's Irish Red may not be in their league, but it's a well-brewed version of the style and would be my choice for St. Patrick's Day if I lived in Southern California."
"Very drinkable. I am surprised by the restraint shown with respect to the hops. This beer drank almost like an English Brown Ale. Hope to have this again someday."
"Got this beer from metallitone1 in Bday '07 and I'm drinking it on St. Pats day. It pours a brilliant dark amber red and is crystal clear. Not much to speak of in terms of aroma, mostly light caramel and dark fruits. The taste is pretty tame. Nothing really stands out here to grab my attention. The body is good but the flavor is weak. What is there is some caramel sweetness and malt. This would be a decent session beer, but I've been more into bolder beers lately."
"Not really a big red as first percieved. More a reddish-rye if that makes any sense."
"Beer is good. Happy Red Irish Beering."
"Overall: I am happy to have had this as my 300th review. I am surprised that I have never had this beer before. It is good, and I definately plan to make it a regular in my beer fridge."
"D: Not half bad. Extremely drinkable and well balanced."
"My kind of beer. Tasty, well rounded, smooth, full, candyish with chocolate and caramel with a sweet fruity center that helps keep a terrific balance. Damn good stuff!"
"Drinkability is very good. Great transitions between flavors and progression of sweet, roast and bitter."
"Overall, it was a very drinkable brew, and a fine session ale."
"Overall: Reds are either harsh Island misnomers or sweet, sickly offerings. This is neither, far from it. The high quality ingredients from the Maris Otter Pale, Munich and Rye Malts, as well as the Pacific NW and European Hops listed all shine through. A very nice Red and a good solid drinking partner."
"This is a nice session beer."
"The beer as it sets in my glass a limpid mahogany color, the head average in size, frothy in texture. Light tan in color and the lace a decent covering upon the glass. Malt dominates the nose, fresh and clean, sweet as it the malt-laden start; top is skimpy in feel. Finish is lightly carbonated, the hops present and mild in their bite, dry aftertaste, average beer, drinkable and pleasant enough when your into something on the lighter side."
"Nice dark plummy red brown but the head is licaking. The aroma is malty, a bit roasty but little else. The flavor is more roasty than expected with a light sweetness. Not a lot of complexity except for a little melon, and really low hopping. Of course, low hopping makes sense for the style, but the lack of fruitiness doesn't. Boring but not bad."
