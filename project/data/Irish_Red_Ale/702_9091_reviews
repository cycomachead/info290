"Tending more to the malty side than hoppy side, with mild notes of sweet chocolaty malt.  Poured from a bottle, which yielded hardly any head no lacing at all.  Entirely drinkable beer, but nothing remarkable at all about it."

"t's still a pretty drinkable beer while waiting for food...Probably would pass on this beer in the future."

"pours a beautiful ruby red color. an inch of thick creamy tan head slowly settles into a patchy sea foamy cap leaving minimal lacing. nose is very sweet and malty, some chocolate, dark fruit and hops. taste is also very sweet from the malts used. not overly hopped or bitter. unfortunatly there is a certain something in there that gives it an astringency that makes the after taste unfavorable. almost like i let an asprin dissolve on my tongue. mouthfeel seems a tad thin for the style. carbonation is good."
"Overall – Easy drinking and affordable. It is somewhat one-dimensional, but overall makes for a good session brew."

"O - Not a bad. There's a fair amount of flavor for this 5.25% ABV brew but it's not a flavor profile that really grabs me."

"Pours a dark amber red with hints of brown and orange and big healthy 2 finger head. Sweet bready malts hit the nose with touches of chocolate, cherries, almost a fudge brownie kinda smell with a smokey touch on the finish. A not too overwhelming caramel and chocolate, big malts on the tongue mixed with touch of bittersweet spice from the hops, again a little bit of a smokey/roasted feel. Medium to full bodied in feel, yet very easy to drink. This is Flying Bison's best year round beer, its an excellent choice if your in the Buffalo area."
"Thanks, silverx, for the opportunity"
"Notes: This beer was very well balanced and flavors were complimentary. Not the most complex beer, but delightfuly simple. A good beer from Buffalo, where I live. An Irish style drank in an Irish City."
"i could drink this all night, nothing extraordinary, but its a well crafted local staple. definatly a nice session choice if you live in the buffalo area."
"Clear ruby red with a thin head of tan foam. Malty, caramel aroma, toast, coffee and dark fruit. Caramel flavour with maltiness, hints of plums and cherries and a moderately bitter finish. On the sweeter side, slightly astringent, and medium carbonation. Fairly drinkable."
"This beer poured a dark brown with purplish-red highlights and a big beige head. The smell is lightly toasted malts with a tiny bit of hops. The taste starts off with some slightly smokey sweet toasted malts that gives way to a kick of hops that stay through to the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly watery with some crisp carbonation. This beer is pretty drinkable and even though it's a bit one-note it's still worth snagging if you can find it for cheap."
"D: Good local brew at best. Recommended to those who want to embrace local bohemia. My favorite Flying Bison beer, their staple, my gateway into craft..."
"This is a very drinkable brew. I could easily session this one. Nothing overly complex here. But it does what it does very well."
"(rated Jul 7, 2007)"
"Drinkability: Eh, it's just an average red at best."
"Did the brewery tour and liked this one fresh from the tank, picked up a 6er sample at the store. Poored deep copper in color with about 1/4"" of cream colored head that dissipated quickly but had bits hang on around the edge of the glass that left nice lacing. Taste isn't quite what I remember but I was drinking it straight from the tank they were bottling the next day so... typical of other red ales I've tried. Very easy to drink and may have to go straight to the source next time..."
"D - I tried this based on a recommendation from a friend from the Niagra Falls area (thanks Doug), and this was a pleasant surprise. This is a nice red ale with tons of grainy flavor complemented by plenty of bold sweetness. I will definitely try other offerings from Flying Bison in the future."
"This is a tasty and solid brew. This one is even a bit past what would probably be a best by date (has a brewed on date, not a best by date) and so the hops have mellowed a bit, but it still drinks very well."
"Pours a deep copper color with ruby highlights, thin tan head has little retention and some spotty lacing. Smells of sweet and roasted malt and citrus hops. Taste is very sweet, brown sugar and caramel mixed with roasted malts with a citrus rind dry finish. Medium in body and low in carbonation. Semi-crisp with a dry finish. A good effort by Flying Bison, very sweet but with a good roasted kick as well as a nice dry finish."
"Pours very dark for an Irish Red, with dark, mahogany highlights and little head or carbonation. Mostly malty smells here, but there's a slight stony or sulphury element lurking in the background. On the palate, juicy caramel malts and a bit of a roasted character balance with a bit of hop bitterness and dryness at the finish -- but only a bit; the beer is rather sweet overall. Mouthfeel is still and heavier than expected due to the low carbonation level. Overall, this is a pretty delicious Irish red that would make a great session(ish) ale."
"Very nice pillow head, with a medium copper color. Smell was subltle all around...light malt, hop and yeast elements. Taste was slightly off balance...initial string malt blast, bitter on mid-palate with a mild finish. Mouthfeel was very good, with a slightly dry quality. Drinkability was also enhanced by the slight dry quality."
"Drinkability: Wish I had a fresh bottle to see what this beer is really like. The oxidation aside, I can see this being a nice Irish Red. Plenty of malty sweetness that is balanced out by some really nice citrusy hops to round things out. A decent beer all around and one a wouldn't hesitate to order or buy if available. Worth seeking out if fresh."
"Flying Bison made another good one with this effort. Again, thanks to my sister for picking this one up for me on her trip out east."
"Drinkability: This would get greater marks here but the carbonation is becoming overwhelming. All around, a good, solid drinker that could be sessioned."
"This one isn't half bad, but it's just not the type of red ale I prefer. It's good stuff all around but I'm more of a hoppy red ale fan. If malt is more your thing, you'll enjoy this one for sure. Worth a try regardless."
"Pours a rich amber hue with a huge khaki colored three finger head that takes a very long time to die down to a good layer of lacing throughout. Stickiness is great, holds on all over the glass. Smell is of a sweet brown sugar malt sweetness with a tiny bit of dirty hops. Taste seems off to me. I detect iced tea with a smokey malt background, not very appealing taste. Aftertaste is a nutty malt flavor with some bitterness from some hop. Mouthfeel is light with a good amount of carbonation. I take away from the drinkability because of the strange taste. I wouldn't seek this one out."
"An enjoyable beer, but nothing great."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable but I didn't find this in the ""session beer"" of red ales. A bit too malty for that.But this beer is worth giving it a try."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, this beer seems like it probably should be in the Irish Red Ale category, but it's a very good beer and one that I could stick with for an evening."
"Seems that the carbonation levels on these Flying Bison brews is kind of out of whack. Got these samples off my bro who was experiencing the same effect. Damn drinkable, once the foam settles."
"D- this was interesting and worth a try. Quite complex taste to it. The carbonation gets in the way of the character though."
"Bottled on date box is blank. I'm pretty sure this is very fresh, though. Pours dark copper into my nonic, with a modest, creamy light tan head. Caramelly malt aromas, with a nearly butterscotch character (but not quite). Faint floral hop scents. Sweet caramel maltiness up front on the palate, with a slightly spicy and floral hop interlude right before a surprisingly long toasted biscuit finish, which is probably my favorite aspect of this beer. There is a slight melon/pear/kiwi fruitiness somewhere around the middle of the sip, but overall this is a malt-based Irish red ale. Light body, moderate sparkle and tactile piquancy. This is nowhere near outstanding, but it is a damn good session brew. Downright quaffable. Flaship beer ahoy!"
"Overall: An average amber that displays some irish red flavors. The dry, bready malts become a little too much as it warms."
"Medium-dark reddish-brown with a small, creamy, light tan head that slowly diminishes to a tenacious film. Some short-lived lacing. The smell is quite wonderful. Full and malty backed by a mild hops presence. Dark bread and caramel most notable along with a hint of earthy peat. The taste is actually a bit of a let down. Its not bad, but following such and attractive nose it just doesnt live up to expectations. It starts and finishes nicely but I find the middle pretty dull in both flavor and mouthfeel. It has a medium body, lightly dry texture and low carbonation. It definitely has a lot of qualities I admire, but it needs some tweaking to make it something Id recommend seeking out."
"A medium mouthfeel,slightly cloying,a bit grainy.a nice hop swell on the palate. A very good beer overall,very pleasing and tasty.Could drink the one all nite long."
"Solid beer. Pours a medium red color with a slight, white, foamy head. Smell was malty with hints of caramel. The taste matched this, with a dry finish. The carbonation is moderate and this would be a great session beer. Had this in Buffalo for Thanksgiving. Would have it again."
"D-I like this beer,Ive had Killians irish red and it almost taste alike.Ide try this beer again but not anytime soon,there are plenty of other beers out there that I wanna try more.Good though."
"Pours a good amber/red color with some head. A good, hearty amber that still makes for a great session beer. Nice, rich caramel malts with citrus hops to match. Reminds me of Rogue's Amber. This is a great beer to have in the fridge for drinking or meals. Cheers."
"Appears a Deep ruby red with a caramel toned head leaves nice full bands of lacing around my pint. Aroma contains a full nutty caramel malt profile with a touch herbal hop character. Flavor has creamy nut edge with soft chocolate and nut undertones low bitterness with some herbal tones in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied creamy edges with even carbonation. Drinkability is a solid all around drinking Irish Red that goes down smooth."
"Light in the mouth too, not watery at all, not too heavy at all. Would make for a nice session beer."
"Drinkability- I could drink about a six pack of these delicious beers before it gets too strong"
"Pours a dark brown/red. When held to light the red really comes through. Not much head to speak of and no lacing left behind. Smells of sweet malts - some chocolate and dark fruits. Tastes of similar but not as rich as I would have expected. Good drinking beer but dont have to worry about savoring. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would have expected and was disappointed. Drinkability is very good. No overpowering flavors and is not too complex. Bought a full 6-er and will happily finish them. Probably wont get again though."
"Might not soar like an F-14, but provides a nice solid workmanlike flight. Good everyday kind of beer. And makes a fine ale substitute for an Octoberfest."
"The beer was good, but not really my style. If you're in to Irish Red's I'd give this a try."
"D - This is a beer to savor for its complex malt flavors. The intensity and quality of the flavors make it a beer to enjoy slowly and in small quantities."
"Pours reddish brown, almost reminds me of motor oil...The label says its a red ale brewed in an Irish tradition, but it almost reminds me of a non-bitter stout. Tastes like a light stout. Mouthfeel is slightly thick. I would call this an enjoying beer. Rather thick and creamy. Hard to drink quick. Overall a very good beer I will gladly drink again."
"D: Worth a try if you're a amber/red ale fan. Good interpretation of the style."
"Pretty darn good. I would certainly drink it again if the opportunity arose."
"I had this on cask at The Old Toad in Rochester, NY. Poured a nice deep red color with a nice thick head that thined out pretty quickly. Smell was malty but mild with little hops and notes of carmel. Very tastely brew, malty, smooth, and true to the style. Definitly something I'd get again! Cheers!"
"Taste wise this beer is one of the better red ales I have tasted. I liked the malt flavor and the hops were added in just the right amount to complement the malt flavor."
"Overall a drinkable amber. Not necessarily my first choice, but it gets the job done."
"A nice red ale, but was expecting more."
"This is a pretty nice beer. It is very malty. My only criticism is the lack of hops. It is pretty smooth going down, nice and fruity/caramely-sweet, with a slight chocolate finish. There is no bite to it, which makes it easy to drink, but not really all that satisfying."
"Poured from growler into an american pint glass. Not too much head. Lacing remains throughout beer. Has a nice dark brownish red color. Not as red as most red ales are in color. Hoppy aroma. Smell really tells you whats in store. Hops is the dominating flavor, but not too hoppy. Good roasted malt after-taste. Very clean in the mouth. Overall a nice enjoyable beer."
"I didn't hold out too much hope after a few strong sniffs, but the engaging flavor was a nice surprise for me. I don't mind yeast, not saying that, but it just came on a bit strong at first, but the flavor more than mitigated what I saw as the sole setback. This is probably a bit more complex than your average session beer, but with the manageable ABV, it is certainly as drinkable as many others, if not more so. Buffalo may not crank out a lot of taste sensations, but you can add this one to the distinguished, if limited, list."
"Just had the Aviator Red during a black friday lunch at Cooper's in Scranton, PA. I know, Scranton, but it is a very good beer bar. The beer pours a nice slightly light brown color with a nice head in the glass. I can pick up some slightly toasty notes to this one, nice and malty with a bit of chocolate as it goes down. The malt in this red ale is a nice touch and makes this beer a good one to have a few of without a problem. For $3.75 a bottle, not a bad deal. Definitely worth a try."
"What ho? Buffalo beer? On this evening of session drinking, this puppy fits the Bill. Get it, Bill? Bills? No? OK. Pours a deep chestnut colored brew; I'm picking up some toffee and Starbucks coffee in the nose. Interesting for the style. Very malty profile, with a good wallop of bitter dark chocolate in there to balance the malt sweetness. Hop bitterness is subtle but noticeable in the aftertaste. Mild carbonation, chewy and coating, a real nice drinker. Certainly not ""wide right""...closer to down the middle."
"Overall, this is a fairly basic, but still very good beer that would work well in a wide variety of situations; and pair with a decent range of basic foods."
"Beer is good. Happy local treat beering."
"A solid offering from Flying Bison."
"Appears about what you expect from a Red Ale, but a little nicer. Nice vibrant ruby red color with a nice head, good retention. Wow, smell is great. Really strong coffee or espresso bean character pops right out at you, interesting and a little bold for a red ale. Also a nice mixture of malt and hops in the scent, balance is key. Taste is equally good. The mentioned espresso taste is more subtle in the taste, nice. Big carmel malt notes up front with a nice milky creamy taste. This is a solid beer all around - excellent smooth mouthfeel, medium to big bodied. Great complexity without being too much. This red ale is a bit ""bigger"" and bolder than most, a great interpretation of the style, one of my favs, when they're good. A great first experience with Flying Bison, I have to seek out some more."
"Strong coffee malts with a tiny touch of chocolate. Nice and smooth as it warms, exceptionally so. Ruby brown, with not much of a head. Hardly any carbonation. The alchohol overpowers the otherwise ok malty, earthy smell. Coffee sneaks out from the alchohol. Very heady coffee malts-at first, but dies out quickly. A bit watery, a touch of alchohol, a touch of chocolate. Very smooth, but a bit thin. Drinkable, easy and smooth."
"This is a better beer for the fall or winter seasons."
"Drinkable? Yes very much so in fact. I could sit back and kill a six-pack of this. Hell I might kill to try this beer on cask. If this beer were a local I would drink it often. As is, I need to thank shippos for including this bottle in the Secret Bunny Exchange!"
"Mildly sweet caramel malt aroma. Small light tan colored head fades quickly to a thin film. Transparent deep brown colored beer with an amber hue. Toasted, biscuit malt flavor up front mixes midway with a bit of hop tea and finishes slightly bitter. Light bodied beer with a soft mouthfeel. Flavor is a bit strong and strange up front, but otherwise a nice beer."
"A dark, juicy looking red colour with a nice, ample head of white foam. Aromas are of juicy, fruity hops. Caramel malts, bread, and pine. The taste is very juicy with a subtle hop flavor that is very juicy in nature. The maltiness is apparent but somewhat subdued as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and VERY refreshing which gives the drinkability of this brew a very clear edge."
"This was a cheap single, a last-minute grab while leaving the beer store. I didnt expect much, to be sure, but found a hell of a good brew. Its a dark amber, nearly reddish-brown, brew with a beautiful, long-lasting head. Its really an attractive beer. The aroma is intense and of roasted malts and alcohol. Chocolate, bit of coffee, and somewhat peppery. At times, theres an intrusive harshness, but I found that kind of enjoyable. Only slightly sweet, and very well balanced. Medium body and very smooth. I really enjoyed this one."
"I see why this one has a higher score than, say, the casco bay riptide. It's much smoother - nicer to drink (well, especially if it's not hot out - and when is it hot in Maine?). If they cut back on the chocolate malts and maybe upped the hops a bit this would be an awesome beer..."
"Ruby red hue, thick pure white head. Nose is pleasant  some fresh baked bread, dark roasted malts. Thin bodied, but not in the way of flavorings; some coffee/espresso notes, dark roasted malts, rather dry. Vienna malts come to play, rather over carbonated, minimal hop presence. Non-offensive, but average at best. Freshness may be an issue here."
"The beer pours a dark ruby color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a kick ass malty scent. It is complex and full of pale and crystal malts. It has a dry feel and a creamy finish. The taste is good. It has a dry, yet malty flavor with a bit of bitter hops in the aftertaste. It goes down smooth and finishes bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine red ale. It has great aroma and complexity; an awesome brew from Buffalo's finest."
"now the first bottle i had was awesome but the second seemed a little off and had some chunks of yeast in the bottom of the glass. so this beer might vary a little due to QC, still give this beer a shot."
"A very good drink, but the heaviness definitely becomes a factor in terms of drinkability. A great version of the style and one to seek out of your partial to 'reds'."
"Poured from a 12 oz. longneck brown bottle, a blurb about the ale on the back of the label. Small gold foil over the cap, and the cap itself oddly enough says ""Gringo light"". Too cryptic for me to decipher. A robust chestnut in colour, it becomes a radiant cherry oak hue when held to the light, quite stunning in fact. Decent off-white head that settles to a ring. A great deal of sweet malts on the nose, toffee, chocolate, small dose of coffee, hell, I can even pick up bubblegum. The malts dominate the flavour as well, caramel, dry dark chocolate, toasted malt, with some coffee on the aftertaste, with a minimum appearance of hops, although the hops become a bit more prevalent as the glass warms up. Light mouthfeel, a bit of carbonation on the finish. A very rich red ale, it could have easily fooled me for a brown, it could use a stronger dose of hopping for my tastes, so as not to be so overhwhelmed by the plethora of malts. Many thanks to northyorksammy for the fresh sample."
"Nice ruby red and beautiful creamy head. Various flavour including chocolate malt and a total of 5 malts."
"This is a standout Red. Rogue, Red Rocket, Red Seal, etc are all too hopped up to be a red.should be considered a ""India Red"" as Landmark has properly done. Regardless, I would purchase Aviator over all of these, even without the homestate nod."
"A real nice offering from a small brewery in Buffalo and am very glad I found it.Pours a great deep red with a creamy sticky a real pleasure to look at,aroma was all malt,toasted malt and biscuity.Taste was also very toasty with nice sweetness a nice toasted malt aftertaste made this a real winner.Normaly I cant drink to many reds but I was able to have a few of these with ease,a very nice beer."
"I may be partial to a hometown brewery, but the overwhelming freshness of this makes it oh-so-good."
