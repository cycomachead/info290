"a little thin...but a very good example of the style."
"Overall, a pretty good Irish Red Ale and one that doesn't lack in flavor. I highly recommend getting this brew."
"A spectacular looking brew, perfect clarity with more than enough suds on top. Fresh toasted bread, spicy rye, faint toffee, & woody hops in the aroma. Lush crispness, smooth creamy body. Lots of malt to wade in, some caramel then some spicy rye ... all meld very well. Clean palate throughout. Quick smack of hop bitterness keeps this ale in check. Some pretty stellar drinking here, sessionable as it grows on me sip after sip. We have a winner here."

"A big thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pretty deep amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell if of caramel malts, some sweetness. Taste is well balanced, caramel malts, some hops, tasty and very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a fine beer and disappearing quickly."
"Poured a red body with decent head and lace and the aroma is bland as I get touches of sweet malts and hops but not too much really going on. The rest of the beer is the same as the beer is light, smooth, minimal hops add some but not complete balance and the beer is just an easy drinking caramel and toffee sweet malt mess that isn't bad but not something I want again."
"Once the Crack! was heard, I sped the rabbit on his way with an inverted Glug. The pseudo-cascade was perfect and resulted in a finger of tawny head that quickly dissipated, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. The color was a deep coppery-red (SRM = > 17, < 22) and looked like the hair color of a former girlfriend. I am not a huge fan of filtration, but this was filament-bright, adding to the overall appearance of the beer. Nose had a light grassiness to accompany the biscuity maltiness and I found this odd for an Irish-style Red as I usually think of them as being quite malty, where this was more subdued. Actually, in reading up on it, this was well within spec for the style, exhibiting a caramel maltiness in the mouth with just a hint of the grassiness that I noted on the nose. Mouthfeel was medium and I found myself drinking through it quite quickly. ""Easy-drinking beer"" may be a cliche, but I am unabashed in using it in this instance. The finish was semi-sweet, but just about right for my tolerance of sweet beers. Its relatively low ABV would make it a good CANdidate for the cooler."
"Pours a deep red with a creamy tan head. Head has some nice retention but no lacing. Aroma is caramel malt, fruit, and some earthy hops. The taste follows right along with the aroma and mirrors it closely in fruit and hops notes. A little thin on the palate but not bad. A tasty red ale."

"Poured straight into a large tulip style glass. Dark amber with hints of orange, and a one and half finger head which quickly goes down to a one finger head, which in turn dissipates down to a very light froth covering the surface of the beer. Nose is all sweet caramelly amber malt, roasted grains, warm bread pudding, a touch of milk chocolate, a hint of minerality, and some sweet floral notes from the hops. Altogether, it’s a sweet, crisp, clean inviting nose, and thoroughly appropriate for the style. Front of the tongue sees tart sweetness, while the midpalate sees a lovely expansion of the sweet malty flavors, including roasted grain and sweet bread notes, dark cherry, blood orange, and mildly tart apple. Back of the tongue sees a surprising, and well-placed hop bitterness, and a surprising and very subtle sense of lighter-roast, berry forward fresh coffee. The finish is a nice balance between the bitter and sweet and is very light on the palate, which reflects the surprising lightness of this beer overall. This style is not supposed to be terribly complex - it is meant as a session beer and this one is certainly sessionable, both in flavor and lower abv. Unlike some other Irish reds, the malty sweetness never becomes cloying or heavy and the balancing hop bitterness is wonderfully executed. You may have dozens, even hundreds of better beers this year, but you might not find a better take on the Irish red ale."

"A basic but decent beer that is unpretentious and a highly quaffable rendition of this style."

"O: This is a really nice effort from DB -- good representation of the roasty-toasty malts with a good dose of caramel and a good crisp hop schedule with light citrus, herbal, and floral components. Would definitely try this one again and pretty sessionable as not too sweet -- grain over caramel to give solid maltiness without too much sweetness."
"I really liked this. It’s definitely more of an Irish Red now and should probably be reclassified as such; with notes of caramel, butter, toast, and firm hop bitterness that gives this just enough of a refreshing crispness. I could drink a whole lot of this and not get bored."
"Without research, I don't know who this Reilly is, but apparently he likes reds (and probably red-heads, too...but, then, who doesn't?). This brew pours a clear orange amber topped by a a bit more than a finger of whitish micro-foam. The nose comprises toffee, hoppy citrus, and some white biscuits. The taste is similar, but the caramel notes are watered-down, the hops melt into a bland floral bitterness, and a strange minty-ness (I think that's how to describe it) creeps in as well. The body is light, with a light carbonation and a crisp, semi-dry finish. Overall, a rather average red, but it's nice to see new things popping up down here."
