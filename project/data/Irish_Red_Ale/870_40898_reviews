"Appearance was a nice dark amber, not much carbonation, small head. Smell was malty with some caramel notes, not bad. Was looking forward to this, but then: Not a whole lot of taste up front, very light despite the ABV. More-so in the aftertaste, malty, not much else. I was actually quite let down by this one. May try again in the future."

"Orang red in the color. There was a small head at the table not sure what it looked like at the tap. Little to no lacing can be seen. Mouthfeel is smooth and sweet . The taste has a lots of malt carmel a hint of bread dough and a light bitter after taste. What you would expect in an Irish red."

"I like the sweeter brews so this was fine in my eyes (apart from actually looking at it!)."

"Overall - A really good Irish red. Deeply malted caramel flavors, but not overly sweet. Fairly simple, but delicious."
"The feel is good, rich and thick, full-bodied (especially for a red) with a bit of a crisp bite and plenty of smoothness."
"Nothing bad here, a decent sessionable ale without a lot of distinction."
""
"It's probably a good drink for those who are really into the sweeter/malty/biscuty beers, but I was hoping for more complexity. A good beer for those who like their stuff more biscuit and caramel rather than hoppy. But balanced, it is not."
""
"Pour is almost like an amber. Smells like overly dry cereal grains. And it even tastes like dry grains. Honestly tastes like a grain mill. They didnt figure out balance in this one. Its so overly dry, its hard to get over. Its honestly not a bad beer, if it wasnt for all those grains."

"O- I liked this beer. I want to try it again and since I'm so close to Moylan's I wanted to check out their location."

"Thanks to swalden28 for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a slightly hazy red-orange color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and earth, with some orange citrus mixed in. The flavor is more of the same. I grt a lot of toffee and some cocoa, as well as some earth and orange. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"O - Nice drop. Easily sessionable without a hint of alcohol."
"The taste was just like the smell. It was elegant, well balanced, and distinctly apricot flavoured. It was an exceptional ale, but I can't give it an exceptional rating because of the way it was presented. It was clearly not an Irish red ale. As other reveiewers have mentioned, this is not the way an Irish red ale is meant to taste. There were too many hops and that distinct fruitiness is that isn't meant to be an Irish red. Good beer, though, so I have to give it a pretty good score."
"O. Not bad, but probably not something I'd drink on a regular basis."
"Pours a see through golden copper hue which leaves a two finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is is burnt toffee,molasses,caramel,candied figs and a light layer of fruity hops,the mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and has tastes of caramel,sticky toffee,fruit cake,marzipan,jarrah honey and finished with a mix of sweet malts and light fruity hops and overall a very easy drinking IRA thats very sessionable and probably would buy again cheers."
"Overall I think it's different type of beer, low hop profile and sweet malts, but well put together and drinkable. Not my style but enjoyable."
"Malty aroma has a fruity underpinning, and is not strong but still inviting. It pours a clear amber-copper with an off-white head that doesn't stick around for long. Flavor has a core of malt plus subtle fruity, caramel, grassy and woody tones and a whisper of honey sweetness. Texture is about average fairly smooth and gently fizzy. Overall, not great but still worthy."
"Different but only liked it so-so. Dry barley with more sweetness than bitterness. Could not drink very much of this bomber. Reddish coloured body with one quarter inch of off-white retained head. A different aroma.A tad above average mouthfeel. Lace sheet.Fine for what it is."
"Interesting brew with some appealing Scottish character that doesn't quite grab me. Seems to underachieve in complexity without compensating with particularly good drinkability."
"Overall this is a nice, consistent, well brewed irish red ale that is not overly true to style, but is a quality beer that gives a good different approach to things."
"Taste bread up front with a yeasty sting, then a green apple flavor hits in the back, finishes dry with a caramel coating. There are good flavors in this, but something tastes a little off. Not a bad beer, but not great either."
"Overall: One for the malty sweet drinkers, heading towards some slight cloying stickiness. I would prefer a skosh less sweetness and alcohol. Just a skosh, mind you."
"Appearance is a nice copper tone with 1 finger of head. Danny`s Irish Red smells of grains and malts mostly, some hops. Taking a sip and the taste has some light fruits, more malts. MF is medium and finishes bitter and dry. A slightly better than average beer that would pair well with wings"
"O- This beer was horrible. And to think this is a off bottle is laughable as I have had so many bottles from them that taste the exact same. I think QC needs to be looked at more indepth a little more."
"Pours an amber color with a thin white head. The aroma has sweet caramel and toasted malts, and a little fruit too. Flavor is sweet and malty with a somewhat bready taste and minimal hops. Medium bodied, solid mouthfeel. Not something I'd drink often, a little too sweet for me, but still a pretty decent Red Ale."
"This beer screams of mediocrity. There is definitely a lack of balance as this beer could have benefited from at least a little hop flavoring. The flavors that did come through did not stand out as anything fantastic. I became quite bored quite quickly while drinking this."
"Aroma is of light caramel, roasted nuts, light touches of butterscotch like sugary notes. Warming brings out a very earthy and pronounced flavor to it. Really nice done but a touch light. This is my only complaint as it did not have the pop I was really looking for at the time. Smooth, even flavor really did not deviate much from beginning to end as the overall impact was nicely put together. A bit light on the feel but this helped to keep it very drinkable and the subtly sweet finish was the icing on the cake."
"O: Another fine brew from Moylan's. I have never gone wrong with one of their ales yet -- all have been solid and some have been spectacular (Hopsickle, Imperial Stout). And the price is right, too."
"D: This was like a light Scotch ale, with malty but clean scent and taste. Nice body too, and very easy to drink. Good beer, but nothing great."
"Drinks alright, but not really holding my interest. About middle of the pack for this style. Not had to many new offerings (to me) from Moylan's lately that have impressed me to be honest"
"Drinkability would be a whole lot better if the overall taste had some oomph to it. It's not a hard brew to drink, just boring."
"This has some excellent flavors. The malts really prevail. It could be ised as a session brew as well."
"Yeah, it's missing something. I like the light graininess and the nutty characters, and it's light enough to be quite drinkable for a beer clocking in above session strength, but there's something too light, too dumbed down about it for me to really enjoy it. Tasty enough, but something I'll probably forget pretty quickly."
"Poured into a Duvel glass, this beer is a deep reddish-amber color with a colossal head, worthy of the glass. Quite lovely to look at. The aroma is quite good as well: Light caramel, with bready melanoidens, modestly fruity. The taste is appropriate for the style: fairly sweet malt, with a hint of toastiness to the bread-like flavor, rather estery. Bitterness is low, and no hop flavor is to be found. The body is a tad watery, which I count the only real flaw."
"Drinkability is very good. Tasty, perfectly balanced, and with a reasonable abv showing no hints of alcohol. Nice beer."
"Drinkability: A tad too sweet for my tastebuds, but an excellent example of the style"
"Not exceptional, but still a very good American attempt at an Irish Red. I'd pick it up again."
"D: It's a nice Irish red ale. Tasty and well balanced. Definitely worth a try for Red ale fans."
"Medium body and carbonation. Pretty refreshing overall. This isn't incredibly exciting but it is fairly drinkable when you're in the mood for the style. One bomber is enjoyable, but I don't know that this is something I'd want more than every once in a while."
"mouthfeel: heavy syrup in the cheeks and throat. grab a slice of bread or some cheese or some water, anything to combat the syrup blitz."
"Taste is a bit fruity and buttery to be considered a clean, malty red ale. The peat that I noticed in the nose carries on into the flavor and contributes more to the 'unclean' feel of this beer. I am not getting much caramel sweetness which usually is a trademark of the style. Body is a touch on the light side and the ABV is well hidden. Hoppy bitterness creeps in on the finish but really does not contribute much overall. I cant think of too many positive traits for Danny's Irish Style Red Ale, and at nearly 5 bucks a bomber I can say with certainty I wont be buying it again. It's not a horrible beer, but average at best."
"D - This is a good beer, I would much rather have a six pack of this instead of a bomber, but hey, with our beer selection, beggars can't be choosers"
"Pours a strong reddish color body, average foamy creamy off-white head, lasting. Very malty aroma. Strong grain, nuttiness. Enticing. Malty Irish tasting, very light nutty taste. Very ""Irish Ale"" tasting. Good and malty."
"D - Again, it's a delicious caramel/malty Irish Red ale. Not an impressive appearance or aroma, but it delivers on taste."
"D- I would say this a good beer, easy to drink and I would see myself enjoying this with some peanuts watching some sports on TV. Wish it was easier to find."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice pumpkin flesh orange color with a thick, fluffy tan head that sticks around wonderfully. Aroma is sweet grains and a little bit of tangy hop presence. Flavor is similar, sweet and tangy with a sort of orangey note. Very smooth and easy to drink. I think this is better than the Marin Irish Red by a hair."
"Pours a reddish brown color...good sized white head with no lacing down the glass. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is much the same sweet/malty brown sugar taste up front with a peat/earthy dry aftertaste. Carbonation is right on and beer is medium bodied. Overall this is a pretty solid beer, would buy this again."
"I like i and it's smooth, but it's not nearly as drinkable as it should be for the low-key smoothness and isn't really a session beer, which is what I think it should be. It becomes a little tiresome and heavy, in part because it has a lot of alcohol for the amount of flavour and complexity you get. For this level of character, I'd go with many other beers that have a lot less alcohol while for the alcohol I'd go with beers with a lot more interest and character."
"not a bad amber ale overall. i personally prefer more hop flavor as it balances out the amber malts. the flavors from the barley and malts however blended well for a smack you in the face flavor. this was a 22oz, can't see myself wanting to drink more back to back."
"D. Very drinkable - not a huge fan of the style, but this was a good example. One I wont dream about, but may enjoy down the road, a nice changeup to the super hoppy beers."
"I love the Moylan's brewery but this is unfortunately not one of my favorites."
"A good Irish Red; better than the mass-prodcued imported brands we get in the states."
"Way drinkable and then some! Yum!"
"Overall its a decent red ale but too sweet for my liking."
"D: Haven't had a beer of this style in a long time, so it was nice to go back. Fresh and tasty, I enjoyed this pint."
"The bottle overflowed upon opening, and it was not shaken. Malt and sherry aroma, red and auburn in color. Again lots of brewer's yeast with this brand. Taste is smooth, chunky, malty and sweet with bit of bitterness. Aftertaste has something kind of skunky, could be the yeast. This was too expensive for what it is."
"D - A really good example of the style, but I am not a big fan. Not much character to this beer."
"From a 22 oz. bottle purchased locally. Aroma is malty and plumy. Appearance is a cloudy red with a tiny tan head. Taste is malty, more of the plummy notes from the crystal malt. A little roast in the background. I'm getting some funky notes in the malt, wet cardboard and a little stale tasting. Mouthfeel is thin with very little carbonation. This has to be one bad bottle because I've never had a clunker from Moylan's before."
"Good drinkability though. Nothing to overpowering and overall its well-balanced."
"Ruddy, rusty, woodstain like amber, but not much of a head or any bubbling. Great color color though. AMBROSIA!!! Golden toasted barely grains glide into the nostrils mixing with some light caramel and minty hop notes. The taste has subtle yet undeniable flavors abounding. Heavy breads with some caramel and honey faintly drizzled on top. A little buttery on the paate, but the faint mint and pine hops cuts through the malt butter flavor a bit. Screams round after round at ""ye olde pube"". NOT A TYPO!"
"Overall: probably won't pick it up again, but wouldn't turn it down either"
"I enjoyed this beer. Didn't knock me out, but definitely a beer worth drinking. Not everything can be a Kilt Lifter, I suppose. I had it after dinner and thought it fit well, got slightly syrupy towards the end. But if you're in the mood for a Red Ale - this beer will not disappoint."
"Went great with my dinner, and I'm sure it would with most anyone's."
"Great flavor and a nice drinker. The ABV and cost is a little high to make this a session beer. Recommend this highly for the style."
"Good, low key carbonation. Its not as smooth as Kilkenny on nitro and not as fizzy as Smithwick's. Even at 6.8%, very sessionable and the best Irish Red I've had, even if it is from California."
"A great example of the style."
"you see this bottle you drink whats inside it."
"D: I could seriously drink this any time, any day! Great beer. The best Irish red I have EVER had! ...EVER!"
"D: Exceptional; the best Irish Red I have had. I highly recommend this beer to people, even if this isn't your style."
"This fucker pours with some viscosity. Pretty murky. Deep, dark scarlet red hue. Thin bubbly beige head. Lace is moderate in quantity and spotty in nature. Very nice toasted malt aroma. Very pronounced aroma that is quite pleasing. Flavor profile is quite balanced between caramel maltiness and toasted maltiness. It's a good blend. Just a titch of ghostly smoke/peat character. Hops aren't detectable. Only around for a little countering effect if anything. A bit dry on the finish. Highly quaffable and tasty."
"Pours a nice reddish amber with a light head that fades quickly to a thin cap. Somewhat strange herbal and malty aromas that are a little light. The taste is surprisingly bland. There is some dry malt, some faint fruitiness and some faint bitterness, but the flavors all sort of cancel each other out. Not bad, but pretty neutral. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and the malt starts to grow a bit as i warms up, but its not too sweet. Not terrible, just a misses the mark a bit."
"D- enjoyable, not complex but very pleasing, interesting, recommended"
"Beer poured red with an off white head. Nose is very malty with a pleasant citric hop aroma. Taste is of caramel malts with a slight hop bitter finish that leaves an acidic layer on the back of my palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with no special characteristics. Drinkability is pretty good, worth a shot at 2.99."
"Prosit, MK"
"D: Pretty good. A little too sweet for me, however."
"Overall: A very good, solid beer. I'm not sure why this is called Irish Red, but whatever. I like this beer with solid/strong foods."
"D: I split a 750ml and that was enough I won't waste my time with this one again."
"Drinkability is ok but I would rather waste my time in a better brew."
"Drinkability> sure!"
"Very enjoyable Irish Red. Slightly complex and well balanced. Recommended."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a hazy amber with 2 cm off white head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of malt, earth, and caramel. Initial flavor was a mellow sweetness, nothing real distinctive. Ends kind of the same, bland malty sweetness. Some carbonation, light lacing, light to medium body, and almost no alcohol noted. Overall pretty mediocre."
"Really good. I enjoyed this a lot. I drank it from a 24oz bottle, and if I'd had two of them I'd have cracked open the second and gotten piss drunk to be sure."
"Drinkability: I really liked this version of the style, and I've yet to have a Moylan's brew which didn't impress me. I paid around $4 for the bomber, and at 6.5% ABV, the buzz is very euphoric and present at the end without the alcohol making itself known in the taste. And though it's complex, it's balanced and doesn't lean too far over to the malt side, which, for me, throws a lot of reds off-kilter and makes many too derivative. I could drink much more of this, and if it's ever in 6-packs I could see this being a nice staple for the spring."
"D - Pretty good for an Irish red. It isn't something I'd have again, but I am not a big fan of Irish reds."
"color was a deep ruby, hazy, with a minimal tan head. subdued nose; some roasty caramel, vague fruit, and a bit of alcohol noted. taste was caramel and toffeeish sweet malts, minimal hop presences, finished sweet. almost rich mouthfeel, medium to full bodied, very lightly carbonated, viscous. decent but nothing special."
"Pours a great red/burnished copper color with a nice foamy head and wonderful lacing. Has a nice malty and sour scent, not really citrus sour, but tangy. Nice taste, a very nice malt flavor, with hints of cherry and something a little burnt, but not as much sourness as a Red from Ireland. Goes down very smoothly, a little on the thick side."
"For a beer relatively low in alcohol, there is still a bit of warmth to be felt. Hops are in the background and only tasted as the beer slides down the back of the tongue on its way to a happy belly. A malty, somewhat sweet beer."
"D= My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a 6-pack, that I know of."
"Drinkability- Overall definitely a pretty tasty brew. At 6.5% it's not chug-able but it goes down really easy and is very approachable. I actually find myself drinking this faster than usual. Glad I brought a bomber home!"
"-Oelergud"
"I will buy this beer again and again.."
"An attractive copper color. A thin off-white head. An aroma of caramel malt, butterscotch and pears. A caramel and biscuit flavor, somewhat sweet, but balanced with hops to dry it out on the finish. A pleasing medium body with a lightly nutty and caramel finish. A well made beer that screams ""October"" though nobody knows what October means in Novato."
"The moutfeel is medium. This beer is very drinkable, even in large amounts. The dry finish helps to keep the beer refreshing. This is definitely a well-conceived and executed beer."
"D: I just saw a show where a person was filmed on the 7 day Guinness Diet. I volunteer to be the first to do the Moylanss Seven Day Dannys Irish Style Red Ale Diet! I highly recommend!"
"The beer pours forth from the 22 ounce bottle an reddish orange with a demonstrative creamy white head that upon its erosion leaves a velum like coating to conceal the glass. Nose has a sour dough earthiness, somewhat sweet with a grassy tone, hints of oranges, caramel also peek though the maze. Start has a decent malt presence; mint like bitterness also present, with a touch, top is medium in feel. Finish has a stinging acidity, the hops blatantly spicy, dry as a bone aftertaste sticks to the palate like super glue, quite drinkable, a nice everyday beer."
"This is a very pretty beer. Pours a dark reddish-mahogany with a thick, chewy head. Unfortunately, that's where my affinity ends for this brew. Taste is excessively biscuity, reminding me of the hopelessly mediocre New Belgium Fat Tire. Very drinkable, and goes well with traditional Irish fare. But that's about it..."
"Opened a 22oz bottle last night and it exploded with foam all in the kitchen sink. After the initial burst, it still was foaming like mad as I poured it into the glasses. This beer was way too over-carbonated, I must have picked up a bad bottle. I managed to only salvage about half a pint glass of beer each for me and my wife. I figured we should at least try a sip or two to see what it tastes like. Actually, it wasn't too bad. It was red colored (obviously) but had a nice apple flavor aspect to it. A bit better than I expected. Too bad that we were only able to have about 4 oz each. As I am not a huge fan of Irish Reds to begin with, I wasn't expecting much. But this one let me down."
"Lightly full, medium body here. It is still fairly sweet, with that amp'd up berry character here in the flavor. Toasted biscuit malt notes are evident up front and there is a touch of dark grain astringency in the finish, though I wouldn't say there is any roast character here. Lots of caramelized crystal malt character here, this brew is practically definite by it. The hops play a supporting role here; most noticeable as a light to nipping bitterness in the finish, but there is also a nice herbal hop flavor here as well. There is an almost saccharine quality to the berry-sweetness in the finish here, not sure what is giving the beer this taste, but it is a touch distracting at times. Still this is mostly a really nice, malty beer that is easy drinking and great for those who like the malt focused equivalent of a Pale Ale."
" Well I believe this is where Moylan comes in. The color is almost ruby, aroma is very deep and pleasing, taste is a nice balance of crystal malt and clean hop finish. Mouthfeel was almost a 5 but as good as this was I want to live in a world where the best is yet to come. If I haven't said it enough times, this is a great brew."
"Nice, reddish color with a great head on top. Ho hum aroma-metallic and coppery like. Malt flavor dominates with a slight bitter bite to it. Slight bready taste to it. Metallic notes. from the aroma comes thru. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel-makes up for the ""bite"" it tends to have. A notch above average. Thanks to beerrun13 for this suprise package."
"A superb malt showcase. Not sure why it doesn't rate better - maybe it's especially sensitive to age, and old samples are out there?"
"Pours into my pint glass with a rich dark reddish amber (if that's a possible color), and is crowned nicely with an off-white head owning lingering tints of burnt orange. The beer itself had a rather mild smell, but hints of sweet malt and caramel find their way through. This ale had a very low hop presence (I like that however), giving way to mild malt and meandering honey notes, finishing clean yet sweet. A nice medium body, although probably a bit to much to be considered a session brew. Pairs great with....yep, corned beef and cabbage. Throw in a few slices of rye bread, and spin the Irish pub tunes...Enjoy"
"Pours a slightly cloudy ruby red with a medium head that disapates quickly and leaves no lacing. The smell is pretty strong and different. Vanilla, grape, sweet malt make this an interesting smelling beer. The taste is creamy and wine like. Sweet malt, some hops, and mostly dark fruit and grapes make this a very different red ale. The m/f is light with a combination of flavors that don't reallt go well together. Not horrible,but this just isn't my cup of tea. If you like very fruity beers this may be for you,otherwise try another Red Ale."
"D: Maybe I let this sit a bit too long. Possibly a bit more crisp when fresh."
"D- I like this a lot. Wish I could get it here. Love the dry finish. Also had a bit bigger body than most Moylan's."
"Nice caramel chewiness going on after you swallow."
"Notes: Ehhhh ...not for me, but not a complete dissaster by any stretch. Soft, malty brews have a place and I do like them but they haven't to have a ""hook"" and this was rather blah. 1 and done."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a weak 1/4"" beige head above the reddish amber brew. Head is gone in a flash, very disappointing for the style, leaving just a film and a few odd bubbles here and there. Some lacing present. Aroma is lightly of sweet caramel malts. Taste is reasonably well-balanced, with grain husks balanced by the sedate hops character. Mouthfeel is kind of chalky/grainy, and lacking in the carbonation department, but it goes down pretty well. Nothing I'd go out of my way to find again."
"Overall Impression: Very drinkable beer - better than most reds, but nothing outstanding overall."
"I've never been a big irish red fan, but this one was pretty decent. Good caramel, malt and fruit aroma. Taste was a touch grainy and dry with some nutty caramel flavours. Some citrus flavours too. Medium bodied, good drinkability. After taste is dry and a touch astringent. OK beer, but probably won't have again."
"Drinkable however not my type of Red."
"This beer opened with a huge burst. I expected to see a big eruption from the bottle, but none came forth. It pours a nice deep amber color with an incredible head that really gets in the way of the pour. The nose is nice deep caramel and slighty citrusy oreangey quality. There is also a peppery spiceyness as well. The flavor is more orangey citrusy than the nose. Its not bad at all. The spicey/peppery character is there just before the finish, but fades fast. The feel is moderate with a light to meduim carbonation. Overall, I do enjoy this one."
"Tap@Moylans brewpub. Under the name Paddys Irish red. Sweet nutty/toffee flavours with a watery texture, dont really like the style much, and this beer is no exception. Nothing much happening in the flavour or body department, pretty soft, smooth palate i guess."
"22 ounce bottle."
"An easy drinking mellow brew highly recommended."
"Quite red in color, with a medium, tightly packed off-white head. Aroma is malty with strong caramel notes. Caramel comes through strong in the flavor as well, where it picks up some light fruity notes mid-palate, a moderate hop bite in the finish, and an aftertaste which has a rich, molasses flavor. There's a bit of smokiness in there too which could stand to be accentuated. As it stands, the flavor is overall a bit on the sweet side for me. Medium-full bodied and drinkable enough, but not the best this brewery has to offer."
"Red gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty and sweet. Slightly hopped, mildly roasted malts. Light character to the hops. Nice flavor. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is sweet and malty, no bitterness. Nice beer, very drinkable on a warm summer day."
"The head foams up like a wave breaking on the northern California shore in a nasty winter storm. After a fairly careful pour, I was left with a good four inches of foam. The head remained at 1/4 to 1/2 inch to the bottom of the glass. The color is a very attractive red with a hint of copper. Caramel is noticeable in the smell with just a slight bit of hops backing it up. As others have noticed, this stuff goes down like water, especially at 6.5% abv."
"Very enjoyable, its only drawback is that it lacks a hop bite in the finish for a Red Ale, but you may well forget that after 16 of these."
"In my quest to join the mug club I had this beer at Moylan's today instead of some of their better offerings.  Color was a deep red and the head and lace were nice.  Taste was interesting and I could not pinpoint what it was. Overall a very smooth brew that would be a decent session ale."
"Hazy reddish amber in hue w/ a quickly dissapating off - white head.  Sweet, ripe fruit esters (smells like starfruit!), nutty malt, dark caramel and a touch of roasted barley in aroma w/ a floral and somewhat spicy hop nose.  The overall aroma is quite odd, yet somewhat enticing.  Flavorwise, this beer is an interesting mix of fruity esters and assertive caramel sweetness.  Although sweet upfront, hop and roasted grain bitterness surfaces late, w/ lightly tart yeast - derived flavors perceptible as well.  The body is a touch thin, unfortunately, leaving the mouthfeel slightly weak. The Goldings hop flavor is akin to damp flowers.  Finishes w/ biscuit notes and light, but more fruitiness lingering...  This is one strange brew.  The esters are odd, and perhaps a bit too dominant.  The flavor components don't seems to coalesce here... that being said, I found myself readily drinking this due to its oddity in flavor.  Moylan's Irish Red is worth a try, but I'm unsure if I'd purchase it again."
"Draft at the brewpub....Another exceptional beer from Moylans. Nice deep amber color, with a tan/reddish head that stays up nicely. You expect lots of carmel malt sweetness and you get it both in the smell and taste. Also some earthy, roasted smells. Very big malt flavors, rich sweet, and creamy. Just a touch of late hops, again reminds you it's Moylan's. I could see this as meal in itself, but combined with a snowy cold day, roast beef, and mashed potatos, this would make for grinning, belly rubbing heaven. Another on of Moylan's 22oz. bottles I carried over 2500 miles home."
