"Very drinkable. Malty, caramel, happiness just right. Had a few, could have easily had a few more!"
"This is a good old session beer that can blend well with any food; in the case of this tasting, I paired this beer with some hot wings."

"Food Pairing: american cheese burger with ketchup mustard and romain, pulled pork (apple cider vinegar and brown sugar not bbq sauce), shepards pie, charred steak, chocolate cake with a vanilla buttercream and fresh strawberries"
"I kept going back to the Hooker's as it was so easy sipping. And after a big plate of corned beef and cabbage it was still sippable."

"O - Quite dry with more hops character than I expected. I probably would not buy this again."

"12 oz bottle. Pours red with a long lasting, off-white head and lovely carbonation. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, bread crust, hints of chocolate and piney hops. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Caramel, earthy hops, hints of chocolate combine on the palate. Long earthy finish. Good Red but definitely not my favorite."

"O/D-Overall, this was one of the better versions of one of my least favorite beer styles. One bottle was enough for me. It could have been much worse."

"Overall not too bad, good session beer. Also have to not this beer isn't too fresh which would explain some of the lacking flavors."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty dark auburn color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is malty, a touch of caramel, not bad but a bit subdued. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a drinkable and pretty good beer."
"O - Just an average Irish Red so do not go out of your way to get it."
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky dark brown with red hues. Not much head. Almost no lacing. Aroma is slightly boozey with some bread, malt, and maybe some hints of chocolate. Taste is somewhat sour with some earthy and malt flavor. Some caramel as well. Tangy, sour finish. Light body and carbonation. Not sure how I feel about this one. The sourness is a bit much for me. Not a bad beer but not a great one either. Overall, it works alright in the mix 12 pack but I wouldn't ever seek it out."
"Pours a clear dark garnet red body under a beige one finger fizzy and foamy head. Lots of visible carbonation. Nose is slightly sweet toasted and crystal malts with some light hoppiness. Flavor is dry toasted and lightly crackery malt with just a hint of bitterness on the finish. A lingering huskiness remains. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, just shy of creamy in texture were it not for the prickly nature of the carbonation. Overall, just about what youâ€™d expect from an Irish Red. Quite full of flavor, but not in your face."
"This is a very easy-to-gulp Red Ale! Bring me some fried clams and scallops please! Yeah, that sounds good!"
"Pulled a pint of this at a burger joint in West Hartford, with a one and a half finger head. With a dark maroon color this looks ok. The head dissipates to a few clingy spots on the edges. Smells of sweet Carmel with a hint of grassy earthiness. Tastes initially sweet and Carmel which transitions to a clean slightly bitter finish. This is an easy drinker and think a BMC person could get into this one quite easily. Not a wow beer but not bad either."
"Sour malt flavor that is almost as if a malt vinegar was added. Light hop that shows up in the swallow and aftertaste can't save this one. The mouthfeel is thin."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with minimal cap of off white head, decent lacing. Scent brings sweet notes of brown sugar, burnt carmel and some grassy and roast qualities. First taste brings the brown sugar and dark carmel sweetness with a roasted nut quality. Grassy flavors as well as some earthy and smoke. Fuller side of medium bodied, slick and coating, perfect like carbonation. A nice Irish red which contains some bold flavors without being overly sweet."
"moderate carbonation, a little heavy feeling. drinkability is below average since it's a little too sweet."
"Drinkability: a highly flavorful and enjoyable brew. I'd gladly have this again."
"D - Moderately drinkable but I wouldn't really care to drink more than a couple of these. Very boring and cheap tasting from a pretty decent brewery."
"Dammit, I hate admitting that I don't remember who I got bottles from. Thanks go out to either jlindros or GoGriz for this guy (though both deserve plenty o' thanks anyway). It pours a clear ruby amber topped by about a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, rye bread, maple syrup, and brown sugar. The taste follows, emphasizing the sweeter notes, like maple syrup, brown sugar, and plenty o' toffee. A slightly sharp bit o' sourdough creeps in there near the end as well, and this somehow does not detract. The body is a nice medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, not a bad red at all, nice and straightforward."
"D) A decent Irish red but not a standout."
"best red ale i've had yet. could just keep drinking this lush and delicious beer..."
"Poured a deep red, near-brown, into an American pint glass, with less than a finger of head, spotty lacing, and mild carbonation. The smell was dominated by malt, with a little bit of caramel. The taste was a little more balanced between malt, caramel, and toffee, but still fairly one-dimensional. The mouthfeel was medium, with less carbonation then expected. Sessionable? Yes, if you love malty flavor in excess, but this beer was too one-dimensional for me."
"D: Average, not a beer tasty enough to drink a lot of, but light enough."
"The taste of this irish red from Thomas Hooker is very enjoyable. It has some carmel, more of the malts and hops as well, slightly bitter at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit sharp compared to other red ales, but pleasant and not dry in the finish. Drinkability is good in this offering from CT`s Thomas Hooker. I am surprised that I waited so long to try their red ale, it is very good."
"Drinkability: this is a nice malty beer that hits the spot when you are looking for a malty beer. Nice red ale."
"Good drinkability - well done example of the style. Would drink again."
"Bottle from JJPM74, thanks John! A nice deep burnt red with a creamy off white foamy cap. Nose is very malt forward, lots of nutty and tofee notes...a bit of vanilla and molasses. Some dark fruit. Sweet, earthy, nutty malts with good caramel backbone. A bit of sharp hops tries to balance the swetness, but it doesn't work. A bit too sweet but the flavours are good for the most part. Creamy, and overall pretty good."
"D: This is a nicely crafted Irish Red. Very drinkable with a nice malty flavor. Another solid offering from Thomas Hooker."
"D- Overall, this is a decent beer but nothing I would purchase again in the future."
"D - This is an okay Irish-style red ale. It doesn't blow you out of the water with complexity but it delivers a traditional and tasty take on the style."
"This is a light to medium bodied beer that is very easy to drink. Complex it is not. The beer is not nearly as sweet as the nose would have it. There are plenty of roasted grains, a slightly charred maltiness that interacts with the drying hop to take away the beer's sweetness. The slightly ashy flavor is the predominant flavor throughout. There is a cherried, maybe a slightly honeyed crystal malt flavor underneath, but it can't get out from underneath the charred and ashy flavors. The beer is modestly carbonated, reasonably refreshing, has a touch of an oiliness in the mouthfeel, and the aftertaste is the same charred notes found in the body of the beer. It's a decent beer, but nothing worth going out of the way for."
"Given the ABV, this is a decent, sessionable red ale."
"D - Despite what seems to be a low score I could drink this all day. Not a beer to sit and pontificate on, its a beer to drink."
"Very easy to drink Irish Red. I'd gladly reach for this one in the future."
"D: As with far too many restaurants, my beer was served at a near arctic temp. At near freezing, this beer doesn't display a lick of complexity. As it warms, the flavors grow and the beer becomes more interesting. A pretty good take on the style. It's more daring than what I was expecting from a chain restaurant's namesake beer."
"The aroma is malty with caramel and grassy hops. The appearance is deep amber with a small but nice head. The flavor is like the aroma. Its simple but quite effective. The palate is smooth. Overall this is a pretty good beer but I am just not in love with it."
"Pours a amberish gold, a nice size head with sticky lacing and good retention. Smells like a boquet of fruity aroma, with tinges of toffee and honey. Taste is a big caramel malt profile up front, with a nice bitterness in the finish. Some malt spice is present on the finish. Overall this is a good break from the Killian's style and a bit more intuitive. A good beer from a local brewery."
"6/4/6/3/13 (3.2/5)"
"I'm not usually the biggest fan of Irish red ales, but I really enjoyed this one. It was balanced perfectly and was great for the cooler weather. I wish I had a few more of these to enjoy."
"D: This is an excellent brew that hits on the maltier, sweeter side of this style."
"D - good, would mind drinking more and more of these. Great session beer. average ABV, not overpowering in it's flavor, a good Irish red. Like a Better Killians. and I like killians for a cheaper brew."
"D - No problems here. I could drink at least six of these in a row."
"Thought I reviewed this a couple years back....guess not. Pours a deep reddish brown color with a great creamy head. Good retention on this beer. Smells very sweet and a bit floral. Lots of candy in the aroma....along the lines of tropical fruit mike n ikes, or the like...or even bubble gum. Tastes of of sweet malts up front then falls off to a very thin finish with a small herbal hop bite, but nothing significant. Medium bodied mouthfeel, airy, not overly carbonated, slightly dry finish. I guess it;s drinkable but I'd go for another Red Ale within arm's reach very quickly, or any other style for that matter."
"I had this on tap with dinner in New Haven. The beer was dark red and a little hazy or maybe just strongly translucent, with a strong 3-finger foam. The smell was malty, some biscuit and a little bit of roasted malt. The flavor followed through with the malts, I didn't get much from the hops except maybe a little tempering of the sweetness. I've never counted Irish Reds among my favorites, but this one could enter the upper echelon within that style."
"Nothing too special here in my opinion. A huge malt bomb for me, almost no detectable hops at all. I also thought it suffered from a lack of carbonation which hurt the drinkability. It tasted almost like an exaggerated Killian's Irish Red to me... which is a beer I can barely drink, so that isn't saying much. Hooker's other offerings are better."
"Pours a very dark rich red amber color little head with very little lacing, smells of malts, very sweet, hints of spices. Taste sweet, malty but not overwhelming, almost taste like candy, medium carbonation, easy to drink, this is a very good red ale, i would recommend it."
"Dark amber colored ale with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is mainly caramel.Taste is caramel,coffee and toasted malt.This is a winner! I would buy and recommend.The brewery on my bottle says Troutbrook brewing,I don't know who bought who but they did a very good job."
"Pours a very dark red, almost caramel color. Rather thin head but decent retention. Not a whole lot of lacing. Smells of malt, caramel and mild spice. I expected a stronger aroma from such a dark red ale. Mouthfeel is very smooth and a bit carbonated. Tastes somewhat sweet and just enough malt, but not overpowering. A little bitterness lingers. Goes down very easy and is quite drinkable. Overall, this is a tasty and smooth red ale."
"Pours a four finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is like a neutral caramel not sweet not bitter. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"D: Nice sweet drinkability."
"D-It is good but it is not my style, I could drink one and move on. But if presented as my only option to have a few, it would not be a bad option."
"Overall: Very good brew, I wish I had more. If you like Irish red ales you'll like this."
"D - Drinkability is good. This is a mild beer that goes down smooth and quite easy. Would have liked to see a little more in the aroma and flavor categories (even for an Irish Red). Still remains a nice beer and worth a try for anyone looking for a good beer that is not too complicated."
"Pours a dark amber brown color with an average head, nothing special. The aroma is dissappointing, I pick up some doughy bread malt, not much else. The taste is of buttery malt, light caramel or toffee, no real hop profile detected. The feel is light to moderate with good carbonation. The finish is dry and astrigent. The drinkability is fine but nothing special. Much better brews out there."
"D - easy drinking, tasty brew."
"An excellent beer here, I wish I had more than just this one bottle. Straddles Scottish and Irish ale varieties a bit, but the result is wonderful."
"A nice-looking red/brown color with a medium-size white head which left a fair amount of lacing. It had a malt and sweet fruit aroma. Malt predominated first in the taste, followed by a little cherry flavor, and finishing with some hop bitterness. Fairly dry, and fun to drink."
"I'd think twice about passing on the Hooker 12-pack from now on, particularly if it was the one which included the Hop Meadow IPA. Gotta love local brewers who do something a little different with an otherwise played-out style."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tannish head, which leaves some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly spicy, and lots of caramel. The taste is malty, bitter, slight spice, and lots of caramel. The finish is dry and bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, a very nice brew from TH, always glad to have one. Thanks Mark."
"Pours a clear darker amber ruby. Nose is metallic and kind of nut-like. Flavor is deep and consistent. Carries a real earthy and slightly leafy character. On the end there is a sweet tone with a touch of light caramel to it. Feel is kind of sticky on the liquid and the bubble is low on the mouth. Overall very drinkable. Smooth and even and a good one to enjoy."
"Thanks again, John!"
"Overall I was quite impressed with this one and to be honest it has been a while since a red ale has impressed me. This was very nicely crafted and never got boring and dull. Nice palate and great feel. This was defiantly a winner and I am sure it really shines when on tap. This one is recommended."
"M/D - A fair amount of carbonation but no at all displeasing. I haven't tried many Irish Red Ale's but I can tell I will like the style. The sweetness and the balance really stand out to me and really enjoyed the first one and wish I had another. I highly recommend this beer."
"This brew is copper red with a light head but fair lacing. Not much to smell other than a hint of skunkiness. Tastes of wheat and a very mellow malt blended in nicely. It's mild with OK carbonation, quite drinkable. There is a peppery touch with a light apple background. A nice tasting red, very passable for a wide variety of occasions. Drink responsibly."
"Poured into a pint glass a deep mahogany color with a very thin cream colored head. Slight carbonation. The aroma had some floral notes and a lot of malt. Went down very smooth with sort of an astringent or drying type effect at the end. The first one had me wantng another."
"M/D-Heavy for a red(but that might have been the cask), no carb, very thick and rich....one of the better Irish reds that I have had, and a true Irish red at that."
"D: Quite tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, excellent representation of style, decent kick, this is yet another exemplary brew by TH. I could definitely drink several of these in an evening."
"There is a nice malty flavor up front, with a bit more of a hop bite than you'd expect from the style. It's nothing overwhelming, but noticeable. Finish is clean and smooth. Overall, a pleasant and easy drinking session ale from Thomas Hooker."
"Medium-bodied and smooth with a nice carbonation level, this is a decent ""sessionable"" red ale."
"After the pour, there was a decent head atop this medium-dark colored ale. Slight lace left on the glass upon settling. Nose picks up a caramel scent. Subtle malty flavor accented with a biscuity taste. While it's not a head turner, I could easily spend a session with this beer."
"It has a full malt flavor, but the richness of the mouth presence seems to dominate the experience. I'm not finding the combination as distracting as some. I would enjoy this one as a session beer if it was available locally."
"The beer pours a dark red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid malt scent that boasts of pale, crystal, bisquit, and special roast malts. It's sweet with caramel malts, yet dry with a toasted aroma. The taste is good also. It has a crisp, dry malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a bit of hops and a slight bisquity edge. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. Something with this much malt character shouldn't be this carbonated. This is a damn good red ale. It's got excellent aroma and malt flavor. One of the best red ales I've ever had."
"It's got a nice mouthfeel and fine drinkability, but it's not one that will lodge in my memory. Probably great for a party where people are just tipping back the brown bottles, but nothing to boast about."
"This is a rich, full-flavored red-ale, but it's a bit thick and tough to drink. It drinks like a stout, or something bigger than this actually is. Don't get me wrong, there's a nice caramel malt flavor with a splash of citrus hops, but it's too much IMO for a red ale. I like the flavor and complexity, but dial back the mouthfeel."
"Pours a deep garnet with a nice head that fades to a ring. Nice tang of malt in the aroma with a hit of spicy hops at the end and an underlying yeastiness. The first time I had this beer I was struck by its maltiness, but now that I review it, I detect more hops and more of a balance. Still tangy malt upfront, but medium bitter hops throughout. Fruity, maybe faint red fruit flavors, but dry. Fairly light, but clean and delicious, and enough malt to give it some body. Holds your interest."
"I was surprised by this beer, was not as sweet and malty as I thought it might be, it actually had a pretty decent hop profile, very well balanced and nice beer..."
"This beer pours a nice dark brown with a hint of red. The thin head doesn't stick around to long or lace much. The smell is all malts, caramel and toasted maltiness very little hop character. The taste is much like the smell , dominated by a full malty taste with a bit sweet but not overly sweet and again just a touch of hops. There is a touch of a metallic flavor as well but the finish is nice. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for my taste maybe slightly overcarbonated as well. The drinkability is ok this a decent irish red and is a lot better than some other irish reds that i've had."
"The mouthfeel was acidy,a bit of a watery feel,lots of tartness. Goes down good could drink a few but not a lot."
"Taste/Mouthfeel-- Pronounced but not overpowering malty flavor dominates. Subtle hoppiness peeks through. Overall a nicely balanced brew. Crisp, dry mouthfeel."
"As a newby to CT I am glad to find some local brews. This is definitely a beer that I will pick up next fall and drink throughout the winter. Also, my bro is a Killians drinker so maybe this will be that ""transition"" beer."
"D - A nice solid Irish red. I am glad I got a chance to try this one."
"A fine sessionable brew. Should go good with food too. Another quality beer from Troutbrook."
"It's quite nice, rich, and somewhat complex, although it may build on the palate after one of two. However, it's certainly worth trying!"
"A very nice brew. A very nice beer to pair with a dish of colcannon on a winter's day. Won't win the award for best in style, but it comes close and is worth hunting it down to give it a try. Great brew from a solid brewer."
"Cheers!"
"Hooker Irish Red Ale is yet another quality offering from one of the East Coast's finest breweries. I'll have to check my reviews, but there can't be too many IRAs that I've liked more. Thanks to nouseforotacon for the bottle."
"Amber brown in color with a head that doesn't quit. Lacing remains throughout...eye candy. Smell is mainly malt with a hint of hops below the surface. Taste is likewise a tad sweet with a small hop taste on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, but not to a fault..very easy on the palate. Because of its smoothness and medium body, this is a very easy brew to drink...defintely have more than one."
"Thanks to far333 for the opportunity to try this one."
"Drinkability Â– Well I usually drink a few of these - once I have one I always want a second - occasionally sessioned. Definitely worth a try folks."
"Taste and drinkability lived up to its appearance. Not outstanding, but very worthwhile. Some malty caramel undertones noted, not heavy on the hops, but pretty much a good, solid Irish red. What Killian's can only hope to be. I would definitely buy again if looking for a drinkable ale with good taste but without too heavy a body."
"D: A solid drinking red ale from T. Hooker--seems like it would be a great session brew, especially with the low abv."
"Pours a deep ruby red hue with smallish tighty bubbled head that is the color of almonds. The aroma is faintly of hops, citrusy, American, and slightly grassy. This is an Irish red but there is minimal malt aroma, and is a clearly Americanized interpretation. Taste is tea like and yes biscuity but very fleeting...theres a faint dark malt note but that all fades quickly into hops, pine, citrus zest hops and that lingers. Gentle, muted malt flavors here. Session kind of beer here, But not a remarkable one. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and fully carbonated, thought fine for style, its not helping. A session beer for certain, or an American, hop-focused Smitwicks for those who prefer hops to malt. Doesn't this contradict the style thought, basically? It's half Irish red half American amber. It probably gets high ratings as it leans toward hoppy rather than malty despite that not being part of the traditional style, so it gets better ratings here than say, Hibernian which is American but true to style. I prefer other versions, but this is not a bad brew, thought not a very special one, either."
"From a 16 ounce swing-top bottle, this pours very dark for an Irish red, with subdued, dark ruby highlights and a thick head that leaves a very substantial ring around the beer. The nose is all carapils malt, with slight, dusty hops underneath. On the tongue, those sweet caramel malts come through first, then metallic, moderately bitter hops that mesh together and balance each other rather well. Medium bodied, with good carbonation at the mid palate and a flat finish. Overall, a great session beer that I could drink all night. Smooth and interesting enough, and perfect adherence to style."
"Yummy and satisfying red."
"A good version of a style I generally don't get too excited about."
"D - moderate, may be too bitter for some, could use a bit more sweetness to it, otherwise very tasty"
"This pours a dark ruby mahogany with a smallish head and good lacing. The smell is light with only a little malt present. The taste is stronger than I expected with honey, sweet malt, hops, and some alcohol in the mix. The m/f is light, but the sweet malt clashes with the bitter hops. Not a bad beer, but the flavors don't quite mix right."
"This one was pretty good. It's easy drinking and full of flavour throughout. It's definitely worth your time if you prefer this style to lean more toward the malt side of things rather than toward the hops."
"The initial smell was mild malt and hints of caramel. After letting the beer sit for a few minutes the aromas intensified. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and tasted of strong malt with a hint of toffee and was replaced by a suttle biterness. Overall the beer had a good balance."
"D: Mild seems to be the keyword that comes to mind the most when thinking about this beer. Perhaps it's because I've been drinking intensely hoppy or malty brews this winter and this was a sudden departure from those styles. Solidly built and fairly enjoyable, but lacking any truly distinctive qualities to relish. Thomas Hooker's Irish Red is quite drinkable as such, but nothing outstanding."
"nice head with good retention and good lacing. pours a crystaline red that looks quite good. tastes of malts, breads, yeasts, and mild bitterness. very smooth and went well with a salad. it's nothing special, but it's better than most reds."
"I had repeatedly missed this on-tap for nearly four years. Finally got it on the right date. Crystalline dark red with burnt amber highlights, really thick moderately dense head that held well. A solid malt and caramel on the nose, something not unlike oat bread too. About the same on the tongue with some hop balance, a good trigger of yeast and nice thick feeling to it."
"A good version of the style. Very smooth on the palate and quite flavorful. On cask, this is one that I could drink all night."
"Malty aroma, biscuity with hints of bread crust and caramel. Same in the flavor with a more of a toasted and very mildly roasted malt character. Balanced hops and very drinkable, nothing earth-shattering but rather just a good drinking ale."
"This was a bomber we received at the last BA festival, thanks. Pour is a lovely deep garnet, and there is still a 1/4 inch tan head even 20 minutes after, hurray. I enjoy the deep malty notes that remind me of rich brown bread. Tastewise the beer delivers mostly malt up front, and some low, but mouthwatering hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium, with appropriate carbonation. Very well balanced brew, and another winner from this brewery."
"The beer poured a dark red with a thick head. That receded to form a slight film on top of the beer. The aroma was all malts and grassy hops. The flavor was sweet malts and reminded me of the the sugar toasted peanuts I used to eat in NYC. There was also a nice grassy hop kick to the back end of the flavor. the beer has a full body. The beer is quite good overall, but I think it could be a little boring to the palate after a couple pints."
"A clean dark brown beer with some ruby highlights. Has a small off white head that leaves some nice lace. There is a good assertive roasted malt aroma with hints of chocolate in the background.The flavor starts out with some malt sweetness on the tip of your tongue with a good balance of bitterness from hops and the roasted malt bitterness. With the roasted malt winning on the finish."
"This is what a cask ale should be ! plenty of flavor and body , complex with out being over done. mild malt flavor with just enough hops to give this ale wounderful balance, their is just enough malt in the aftertaste that makes me want more. good job paul!!"
"12oz. Bottle: Not bad. It is a reddish-brown color. A Fair amout of maltiness to go with a little hops. A bit of smokiness and roastiness to the taste. Much better than the commercial attempts at an Irish Red. Seems to have been improved since my last tasting of this!"
"Flavor is nice and malty, with a little yeasty chewiness. I can't detect much in the way of hops. I'm thinking that the Glacier IPA just punished my taste buds, so I'm not getting the full effect of this beer. Great balance. Very drinkable and very pleasant. Dry finish. Carbonation is low to moderate. Well done."
"Dark amber color with a light brown head. The head is small but frothy, with big bubbles bursting into craters on top. Very clingy with good lacing to the glass. Aroma is light hop. Flavor hits the front of the tongue with a hop bitterness, and finishes with well-rounded malt, some fine roasted nuances. Very smooth mouthfeel."
