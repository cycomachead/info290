4.47,29.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Smithwick's Superior Irish Ale brewed by  Guinness Ltd, with an ABV of 4.5%  This ale pours out a nice light brown color with a nice off white head. Superior Irish Ale has the look of sweet tea.  The smell is sweet, with grain, and malts. You pick up on a hit of hops in the smell.  The smell is rich and inviting. I really like the smell of this brew. Now for the taste, it sweet with some grains and malts. There is a lot going on in this brew. Smithwick's Superior Irish Ale, has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about it. The mouthfeel is rich , with flavor, but has a smooth aftertaste.  This brew is a nice, smooth drinking brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out 5. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Mar 01, 2015"

3.6,4.7,,,,,,"Not an easy style to find around MN, so I picked a bottle of this up in a mix-six.  Huge khaki head, dark red color, fairly clear.  Toasty malts and some faint floral hops on the nose.  Taste follows the nose, with a nice mellow, slightly sweet, and quite dry finish; smooth and creamy mouthful.  A very faint metallic mineral note toward the end, too...if it came out more clearly as, say, herbal or medicinal, that would be interesting, but as is, it isn't pleasing.  Except for that, this is pretty nice for the style, though it could be much more full bodied.  Would be interested to give this a go on cask.","Taybeh","Nov 17, 2014"

3.35,-2.6,4,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.5,"What a good looking beer. Huge off white head that leaves tons of lace everywhere. Slow fade leaves a nice covering. Smell is a bit of a letdown. I have to swirl the glass to get the malts to show. When I do I get light caramel and toasted grains. Grassy hops, floral notes, and grain husk. Taste starts with typical Irish red profile of a malt front, flowing into a mineral based tanginess. Malt is a bit light but offers up lightly toasted grains and whole grain bread crust. Some mild nuttiness. Hops are earthly and mild. Dry mildly astringent make for a clean finish with a tea like trace on lingering. Feel is somewhat substantive with enough weight to keep it from the watery grave that has found Harp. A coarsely creamy carbonation make it an enjoyable swallow. A decent brew but it had lost its way like Harp. It has suffered less but nonetheless has turned into a shadow of the full bodied ale it once was. Having said that it still has something to offer and is a step up from the BMC crowd.","scootny","Jul 04, 2014"

3.52,2.3,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a half finger ivory head that dissipates to a thin film leaving light lacing. Light aroma of caramel malt, mild nuts; slightly spicy. Flavor of sweet malt, mild nuttiness, light fruit juice; finishes with light caramel malt and mild grassy hops. Medium bodied. A low key, pleasant Irish red. Better than I had expected, but not exceptional. The sweet malt is reminiscent of mass produced lagers, but this has the appropriate fruit flavors and the noted light nuttiness to give it character. Average, but pleasant to drink.","LiquidAmber","Beers"
