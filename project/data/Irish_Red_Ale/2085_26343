Flavor is plain and undermalted with a slight earthy and herbal hop note. lighter body than expected for the style and moderate carbonation. Many of these brews are boring and undermalted, expecially the red ales.","kylehay2004","Jul 10, 2012"

4.43,24.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Good pouring, brilliant red/amber hue, not too much head. Great aroma, has a distinct ""heavy"" smell. Some carbonation, but not enough to ""bite."" Very refreshing, one of the best darker beers I've had for the summer. Not a lot of sweetness, quite dry, but still fresh tasting. Clean finish, almost a lemon/bitter aroma at the finish, it was there, and now it is gone.","AllensMtClemens","May 11, 2010"
3.3,-7.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"D-Not a bad tasting beer overall but just too over the top with the carbonation.","bierenutz","Apr 10, 2009"
3.33,-6.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This brew pours a beautiful cloudy deep amber with a slight head (after a fairly aggressive pour) that dissipates quickly. Definitely not aromatically challenged. I get a very pleasant & mellow malt essence with a tinge of sweet. It has a good meaty scent to it, but it's not piercing my nostrils; already, it seems balanced and tasty, and that's coming from my nose. The taste is nice, dry & crisp. Light to the sense, yet packed with malt-flavored goodness. It's a fine mix, as some ambers pack on the flavor, and the density; whereas this brew almost drinks like a lager, but yet has plenty of girth to back it up as an Irish ale. I love how there's a hint of sweet and a slight bitterness, yet it's almost like they mask each other. There's a 'bready-ness' to the taste that allows each flavor to blend and create its own taste. The aftertaste is a nice lingering malt sensation. It hits the back of my throat in a refreshing way and sits there until the next sip. I get a nice hint of bitterness in the end.","MIMicrobrews","Dec 07, 2008"

2.06,-42.3,3,2,2,2,2,"D - I hate to say it, but this was not good. The fruitiness I noted reminded me of young homebrew. Love to try this on tap, and see if that helps with the conditioning. Weak body, weak flavor. Still looking forward to try more from these guys though...","SammyDavisJrJrJr","Beers"
3.68,3.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer is unlike the few other Irish reds I've had, in fact it reminds me more of a Scottish ale, but I suppose they can be fairly similar. While it had a standard red, with white head, appearance, the aroma and flavor, especially, came off as dry, thin caramel malts with some bready flavor mixed in. The yeast seemed to add a creamy note as well, but the malts carried this beer. Tasty and drinkable, worth trying.","tempest","0"

3.94,10.4,4,2.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a dark reddish copper with minimal head. It really didn't have much smell to it at all, so I was especially surprised with the flavor of this one's! It had a pretty strong flavor with a very sweet finish which I believe was honey. It was a very drinkable beer which I will want to definitely try again.","jeremyd365","Oct 04, 2007"
3.45,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Auburn copper body, clear, with a finger of fizzyish, dirty light khaki head. Sweet caramelly malts over toasted nuts, light brown sugar, and soapy, floral hops. Lightly toasted malt and grains up front. Mildly sweet caramel and cola flavors gradually turn sourish. Finish is slightly tart with hints of herbal and citrus hops. Moderate body with a rather fizzy feel. Not bad, but not one of my favorite Dragonmead brews.","alexgash","Sep 09, 2007"
3.83,7.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Maybe it's because I haven't had an Irish red in a while, but I like this one more than I expected to. If Erik the Red (Irish Style Amber Ale) is representative of what Dragonmead has to offer, I'm looking forward to the handful of other singles that I was able to find on my recent trip through southern Michigan.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 23, 2007"
3.33,-6.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"On tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor,poured from the tap into a standard pint glass a slight hazed reddish brown color with almost no head to speak of,light aromas mainly faint caramel a light toastiness.A pretty standard malty red on the palate,big dose of caramel,buttery sweetness and firm toastiness almost a butterscotch flair going on a very faint herbal hop shows thru in the finish.Eh it was ok it is what it is a malty red with a thinner mouthfeel.","oberon","Oct 16, 2005"

2.79,-21.8,4,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Unfortunately, the beer with my name (but not hair color), has got some work to do. This brew had a nice red color presentation, but low carbonation, and no head to speak of. Forget about lacing. Smell was sort of herbal and whisky like, with a touch of sweetness. Taste was bland and kind of boring, with only minimal amounts of malt. Mouthfeel was weak and flat. Not a real good beer, maybe I got it on a bad day or something. I'd try some other offerings first.","Frozensoul327","0"
