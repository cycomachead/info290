"O: A decent beer but that weird cherry flavor in the middle throws it off a little for me."

"Pretty good beer for Samuel Adams"

"A very drinkable beer that I'll have a couple times a year. Nothing special, but better than a few other irish reds out there. A decent Sam year-round."

"O: This was a caramel bomb. The bitterness was barely noticeable, and nicely balanced the malt. This was interesting to try against the ambers that I've had. It was a simple beer, but good."

"Pours to a beige head that lasts and laces. Color is a maroonish red hue. Aroma is toasty, caramel, sweet malt and spicy, earthy hops. Flavor is more of the same with a toffee-like finish. Overall a very good Red."

"Simply the best I've had"
""

""

"Pours a pretty dark russet amber in color with a thin white head. Some spotty lacing was seen but not a lot. The aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of caramel and nuts. The taste was mostly of malt with a slight hoppy bitter finish that lingered a bit. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, it was OK but nothing special in my book."

"Maybe it's just me, but I think this beer is delicious....beautiful copper color, great aroma, and awesome, slightly malty taste. Not too heavy, very drinkable in warm or cold weather. Excellent with hearty foods like stews and potato dishes (go figure)!"

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 5/2014. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruit yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt forward profile and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Irish red ale. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"overall not bad. however i have had better Irish red ales. Conway's Irish Ale to name just one. i wasn't a big fan of this brew, so i don't think i will be getting anymore of this anytime soon."

""

""

"Despite the complexity I find it strangely awry as my expectation is stronger roasts and toasted malt. The flavors are more twangy and raisin and that simply seems wrong."
"Overall: One of the better Irish reds I've had. Perfect beer for a cool Spring day. Would have another."

"Had this poured out of the bottle into a pint glass. This is the eleventh beer I've tried from Sam. This is a pretty mild red from those that've tried. Not as smoky As I'm accustomed to, a little flat. Lacking the lingering flavor that you get out of many like beers. It did however have a great appearance, beautiful ruby red. Too bad the flavor didn't measure up."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice ""red"" beer. I drank it at ""garage"" temperature (58F) and it was just about right. Too cold and I think you'd miss the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet malts on the nose and then on the palate....some roasted notes and plenty of sweet caramel. British/mellow hops dry out the finish and provide the balance. Ehh, nothing special, but not terrible. Drinkable and serviceable every day/middle of the road kinda ale"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very easy drinking beer. Very sessionable based on taste."

"This was by far the best brew with roasted malts I have had in quiet some time, if not ever. I was very impressed by it's crystal clear red color with thick head and lacing all the way down the glass. The beer is silky and smooth going down and the roasted malts-taste mixes well with the overall flavor of the beer. The one disappointing part of the beer was its smell - not as good as I would have like, but easily overlooked with the rest of what this beer has to offer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Its a pretty good representation of the Irish red ales."
"The Verdict: It’s ok. Entirely drinkable and mostly underwhelming. If only their beers tasted as good as they looked."

"O: I didn't mind having this beer but it wasn't anything great. It felt like I was drinking a weaker version of a porter. It's a good beer to have even if on the watery side and would just rate this as an average beer."
""
""
""
""
"poured into malt glass, pours a gppd head afterwards does the the bubble show and hoping for some good barley malts in the taste it's really just bland and resembles other high production glorp like killians red , save your shillings not all that great"

"3.61/5.00"

"On the palate - initial sweetness that is very quickly counter balanced with a mixture of bitterness, roastiness, and even a somewhat sour tone - all at the same time. So here I am again, in a land of red that just doesn't do it for me. Suspect it isn't all that bad, if this is what one likes, just no for my taste."

"been a while since i reviewed anything from sam adams. with a nice ruby color and thick head(seems to be the standard when it comes to beers from sam adams). malty and not to sweet with a bit of hop bite at the end. for me i enjoy getting my feet wet with new style through sam adams they are usually very solid beers that are good examples of the style."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, SA Irish Red is a red-amber color (surprise!) with a cream colored, thick, soapy head. The nose is faint but is of caramel and grainy notes. Flavor also seems a little muted, but definitely easy drinking. Mild caramel sweetness with a bready-toasted malt flavor, hops only to balance - finish is very neutral, somewhat dry and very satisfying. The mouthfeel is medium in body with a thick, creamy carbonation. Overall, I don't drink many amber ales any more but this one is a home run in my book - smooth and not too sweet this is one you could have more than a couple of."

"3.0 D: This is about as average as it gets. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing right either. Boring beer."

"O - Appreciated this beer much more this time around. A very flavorful and pleasant red ale. Several unique flavors going, with a small amount of sweetness. Highly recommended beer."

"O) I've had quite a few different red ales and ambers recently. This was one of the more enjoyable for sure. As far as Samuel Adams goes, I put this right up there with Boston Lager, Oktoberfest, and Winter Lager, as one of my favorite offerings from their brewery."

"To me, the best way to enjoy an Irish Red is to let it roll down the back of your tongue. This may be a bad habit that I acquired in college, but it seems to work every time. This Red pours a beautiful clear amber with not much head to talk about- nothing lasting, anyway. I get sweet candy and malts on the nose, with a touch of honey and caramel. There's nice carbonation. I taste the same, finished by lovely sweet candied honey hops. (Is there such a thing? Can I say this?) This beer has everything I'd expect from an Irish Red- nothing more, nothing less. It's hard to describe this beer above that. I don't understand the harsh reviews, as this is a very drinkable beer. I don't expect complexity or richness, and find myself pleasantly not disappointed. Boston can be proud of this Irish Red. Anyone that knows more about Irish Red's is welcome to introduce me to the ""finer Red brews""."

"Pours a clear orange-red with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Thin streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, grain, and some caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and slight metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but I think the smell is better on this one."
""
""
""
"Overall - ""Eh"" is about all I can say about this beer. It's not a bad beer by any means but it is not a traditional Irish Red that I would expect. It almost seems like a watered down version. I'll drink the other 3 Irish Reds that came in this variety pack after having a couple of more flavorful beers. This was pretty disappointing for sure."
""
"This is a delicious beer, with the briefest presence in my mouth that I can remember a beer having, which again, isn't unpleasant. Probably best in the summer when you want a lighter (though not weak) brew, somewhere between a Pale Ale and an IPA. Though best on it's own, the slight sweetness might go well with a light pasta dish or contrast with a white clam chowder. Cheers!"
""
"O: Meh, it was alright, not horrible and it was fairly smooth too, I've had far worse. Just a decent beer, would pair great at a Barberque in 90 degree weather. I'd recommend it though I probably won't have this again unless it's given to me"
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Overall the Samuel Adams Irish Red is a bit of a below average beer. It really doesn't have much going for it to begin with and the off-flavors don't help. Would I drink it again? No."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not really a fan of red ales unless they're super hoppy (e.g. OB G'Knight, Lagunitas Imperial Red) and this one certainly isn't that hopped up. Still, it drinks well and I could name several Sam Adams beers that are worse."
""
" The flavor is okay, not bad mild maltiness with slight fruitiness in the yeast with just enough hops to give it some balance. The flavor is slightly creamy with bready toasted taste yet the diacteyl comes forward as it warms with a light tanginess in the yeast I am not ecstatic about. The flavor is okay, but after one of these I was ready to move on, the style is fine, but this particular interpetion is not that impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle from a sampler 12pack, pours reddish-amber in color and is topped with a frothy, off-white head that holds good retention and leaves some lacing as it fades. Malty nose with caramel, toasted grain, and herbal, earthy hop. Tastes are sweet with caramel, herbal and earthy hop again, kind of sour, with some toasty grain notes as well. Thin-to-medium body, creamy with ample carbonation. Overall, it's what I'd expect for a traditional Irish Red Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Little head out of the bottle, but a pretty,clear amber with a fair amount of red. Strong sweet malt comes upon opening the bottle. Fair amount of dryness, but more is needed for this style. A bit of fizz on the tongue from the carbonation. Overall it is a tasty variation that is welcome, but as an Irish red goes- a bit too sweet and needs to be a tad drier."
""
""
""
""
"a pretty good irish red, not as dry as the traditional ones, but a good spring mix brew no doubt. it pours a nice amber honey color with a solid white head with fine retention. the nose is a little sweeter than the style usually allows for, with a woody sort of malt vibe and a balancing hop component towards the end. the flavor follows suit, with a surprisingly delicate malt profile that makes this a real easy drinking beer. the caramel toffee English sort of sweetness comes out in the middle before the hops checks it in the finish. the hops are sort of pine like, foresty and more winter than spring in this beer. medium body and average carbonation, slightly sticky finish and a tad filling. a better than average irish red and a fine addition to the spring mix."
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a bit of the light bodied side that makes it rather easy to drink compared to some red ales, and with its dry finish makes it a good Irish red."

"O - Not really balanced between the smell and taste, the beer is kind of all over the place. Not as much taste as one might hope, and even then the initial flavours fade very quickly. Not terribly impressed, this will be my already-drunk beer if I have to pick one from the pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know how they get this perfect copper color, but it's a little suspicious. Lovely, though, and there is a float of foam, finally, on the last pour of the 12 oz bottle. Not a bad contender in one of my least favorite beer categories."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor starts off with the sweet malt notes. But then fortunately, different form the nose, there is some grassy herbal notes to it. Then the grassy refreshing notes get subedud again by some nice sweet bready malt notes. There is some slight roast but the sweetness carries through. Pretty straight forward brew. Easy to drink."
""
""
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. The beer pours amber with a light tan head that dissipates slowly. There are some visible bubbles rising in the glass. Some lacing is left behind on the glass during consumption. The beer smells of caramel and lightly toasted bread. There's also a mildy earthy smell. The taste follows the nose. There's bread crust and mild caramel sweetness balanced by the earthy hops. There's some back end hop bitterness that is fairly mild, but does provide some balance. There's almost a touch of smokiness in the flavor. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is fairly clean and the beer drinks smoothly. This is a good beer."
""
""
"Compared to other Sam Adams and Irish Red beers this is a let down for us."
"Toasted marshmallow up front. Sweetish, and a little nutty. Caramel, molasses, and cookie dough flavor build by mid-palate. Vegetal hops sneak in by the finish creating some mildly spicy bitterness. Medium-bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Not bad. Reminds me of some Scottish ales I have had."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I did enjoy this beer. It has a fair amount of toasty flavor and caramel sweetness without upsetting the balance of it being a drinkable beer. I would say that of all the Sam Adams offerings I've had, this one would probably be the closest to what an appreciator of their Boston Lager would enjoy. For these people, I would recommend it highly."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not Sam's best, but not a beer I would be above choosing again."
"O - Nice beer but nothing special. I'd drink it again but probably wont make an effort to look for it. It did go down easy."
""
"RJT"
""
""
""
""
"O: Can't say I'm a huge fan of this one. It's hard to really place what I don't like about this, but it ultimately doesn't come together nearly as much as it should."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not my favorite style, yet I really like this beer. More complex tasting than expected. A little ""all over the place"" (great look, boring smell, great taste, etc) and if they fixed a couple flaws, this could really be a champ. I'm sure there are better Irish Red's out there, but it's the best I have had so far, and blows Smithwick's out of the water."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good beer, but the taste is just above average."
""
""
"O- not a bad beer, but almost seems like a starter version of craft beer...not as if an Irish red is a very complex style, but there isn't a lot going on"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a lovely brownish amber with a thick creamy head and medium retention and good lacing. The appearance is the best part of this beer. It has a wheaty boozy smell. The taste of this beer is kind of bland to me. It taste a little metallic in the after taste. It has a weak body but ok for the style of beer and decent carbonation. This beer is ok at best and I would not order it at a bar unless all they had was light American beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This came in the Sam Adams spring pack. I don't know if I would buy it by itself. There's better Irish reds out there, but they did a nice job on this one."
"Overall a solid, worthwhile beer. Nothing stunning, but hits enough style points and is thoroughly enjoyable to drink."
""
""
""
"Samuel Adams Irish Red ---2.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This doesn't strike me as special at all, but I haven't had many Irish Reds. Not worth the time IMO."
""
""
""
"I'm happy about what I have here. Not a labor to drink through. I, first, scoffed when I saw it included in the Spring Thaw case. And now, I'm out. That was easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My neighbor brewed some and did a taste test with three others ... this beer was the best by far...and over a signature ""Irish Red"". They got this one down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer has the looks but to me is average beyond that. More body and a little more carbonation and I think this could be a good one. Drinkable but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to get again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very well balanced red... one that you could easily session but that has enough flavor to be satisfying."
"It pours a deep clear red with a tan head. The head retention is good and the lacing kicks in when there is just a thin layer of foam left on the beer. It smells toasty, with notes of caramel, bread and some very light hop aromas. The mouthfeel is heavier than exected. There is a bit too much carbonation and it is prickly. The taste is mildly bitter and astringent up front and then fades into malt and caramel. The finish is very bready. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty solid Irish Red. I'm sure I'll have better Irish reds in my life and I'm sure I'll have worse. Samuel Adams does a great job of making consistent beers. They have a few that are at the top of each style and a lot that kind of fall in the middle of the pack. Not a bad brew by any means and I'll definitely enjoy the last bottle of Irish Red that I have in the fridge. I wouldn't mind buying another, but maybe not a 6 pack. Solid brew for a good, low price."

"This pours a reddish/copper color with a slight off-white head. The scent is fairly weak, but there are some tones of malts. The taste is well blended with a decent mix of malts, hops, and spices. It’s perhaps a little thinner in texture than I like in a beer, but not bad. Drinks smooth, tastes good, and has that classic Irish red character."

"Samuel Adams Irish Red – The bottle says: “This rich and malty ale originated in Ireland in 1710. I has a deep red color and distinctive caramel flavor from its pale and caramel malts. The malt sweetness is balanced by the earthy notes of the East Kent Golding hops. Cheers!”"
"Overall, this is a decent beer. Not my favorite style, but I'd drink it if I had to. The ABV is also a decent 5.80%, so there's even more reason to take a bottle."

"Truly I expected more from Sam Adams on this one."

"Overall: simple and standard irish red. not much to the body and not very memorable. still fairly drinkable."

"A nice malt fest in my glass. Nice red hued amber ale with a faint red tint in the terracotta head. Smell is sweet and malty with the traditional Irish fruit esters. Notes of banana and pear with a touch of grape and sweet alcohol. Taste is malty with the aforementioned flavors from the nose. Yeast is a signature here and this one leaves a nice mark on the ale. good fruitiness with a clean character. Finish is dry and also clean with a touch of malted grains. Feel is well carbonated with a crisp edge. Weight is medium. A nice Irish red overall"

"While I would rate this one as “drinkable” I would not recommend buying it as there are hundreds of others that are far more enjoyable. Also you can buy every other single brew Samuel Adams makes and it will be better than this one. I just don’t see myself buying this one again."

"Appearance has a reddish amber hue supporting a dissipating head leaving a thin film and spotty lace. Smell is light on the nose of light sweet malt, honey, tea and light hops. Taste again having the light sweet malt while sucking on a bitter tea bag having a dry finish. Mouthfeel is lightly medium with good carbonation. Not a bad brew, just one I personally wouldn't go after again."

"Overall, this is good fare, and while it is most certainly not a ""big"" beer with massive flavors and a knock-yer-socks-off hop blast, it's not intended to be. Instead, this is simple, good beer that excels at offering delicious flavors in readily-palatable quantities. Having said that, I did want for at least, say, a 10% increase in flavors, or at least enough that the sugars maintain their tastiness over several mouthfuls. Still, for decent beer at roughly $1 a bottle prices ($24.99 for a case at my store), this is a great option."
"O: Thought this was pretty good, maybe not something I would go out of my way to seek out but overall decent flavor and drinkability"
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, not great either but very satisfying. Doesn't hurt to grab one and catch a flick. Salud!"

"O- Pretty average beer, it certainly is on the malty side but has some flavor."
"O: This is a great beer for the style that it is, though not spectacular in the big world of beer. If you like S.A. Boston Lager you should like this one."
"O- Looks and smells a bit better than it tastes and finishes...it's a decent beer and i'd take it over non-craft beers any day of the week; but not something that would be on my shopping list."

"O - This beer is not something I would ever go out of my way to have, heck I probably wouldn't reach to a shelf above my shoulder to pick it up, there simply is nothing really going on here. Better than the american ""light lager"" but a poor attempt for a true irish red."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a bright red, with a quarter inch white head, that leaves some lacing. Smell very bready, carmel, and some hard candy. Taste is that, very little hop presence, carmel and the hard candy blend together, a little to sweet for me. Body medium to thin, easy drinking, not dry, and plenty of carbonation. It is good for the style, but not my favorite style do to its lack of hops."
""
""
""
""
"A bit of a let-down. It's tasty, sure, but it doesn't really offer anything the big English/Irish canned pub ales already deliver. Still, it's tasty enough and does what it sets out to do."

"Reddish brown mahogony body, and not much head. Sweet malty cherry aroma with spices. Spice driven palate with a tad of citrus, hop bitterness and sweet malt balance, light crisp feel and a bit watery. Overall very spice forward and good crisp light drinkability"
"Overall a good but not great irish red. It's passable, but there are superior offerings in this style."
"Overall a rather poor showing. The taste is pretty decent but it doesn't make up for all the other short comings. Also the fact that it leaves such a bad taste makes me want to not drink more. If the before and after are no good it drowns out what the success of the taste."

"Poured 12 oz bottle into premium pint glass. Pours a nice deep dark red (who would of thought that by the name) color with a decent sized white head. Lots of caramel smell, but definitely lots of malt in it. Tastes of lots of malt, but the caramelized malt dominates. This beer has great taste and carbonation is just right. Overall, a pretty good beer and one that is great for that holiday in March."

"Opinion: This is an OK beer and it DOES makeme think of an Irish Red, so I guess they hit their mark. That said, this isn't all that great of a beer to make it stand out. I think that it is a little too attenuated, but that seems to be what I think about a great majority of BBC's beers. If you really dig this style, give this one a shot."

"O - This is a solid offering from Sam Adams. It's very easy to drink and has a pleasant, sweet caramel-forward flavor, though it was probably a bit too much for me. As a result, the grassy/earthy hops weren't very easy to discern. That said, I would have this beer again and am looking forward to trying the other offerings in the Brewers Choice variety pack."
""
""
"O - It's a decent beer. I love Conways Irish Ale, and this just doesn't stack up."
"O: a pretty run of the mill Irish red, carbonation was too aggressive, taste was decent enough, not bad, id buy a sixer on a boring night"
"D/O: The strong caramel presence and the dry finish just make this beer ""work"". I enjoyed it, and would repeat it. A strong offering from The Boston Beer Company."
""
""
""
"D/O: This beer proceeds through its display of sensory qualities in a fairly checklist-like fashion. It tastes convincingly authentic but all of the seams are left exposed, which does not lend it much in the way of endearing qualities. It ends up being forgettable, but not offensive, on the seasoned palate."
""
""
"Overall - Not a superb beer, but certainly something I could see myself drinking for an evening every now and again if it were on sale."
"Pours a crimson red with an off-white to white head that laces pretty well and succumbs to a thin but relentless layer of head. The nose smells strongly of cherry and nutty malt sweetness; almost identical to an amaretto. Taste falls into the same description as the nose. Mouthfeel is bright and has a polished carbonation. Overall, this beer is dead on to the style and is as easily quaffed as it is dissected and relished. I'm thinking this and Guinness make for a nice staple of cases for my St. Patty's get togethers."
""
"Overall-I did not buy this beer, my father in law left it in my fridge and I thought I would try it, plus their bottles are good for homebrew. This beer was slightly better than what I would expect. However given the choice between this and a Smithwicks, i will choose Smithwick's every time."
"Overall - A slightly better then average brew, but when given the choice of others (like the others in this Sam Adams brewer's choice collection) would choose others (like original Sam or whitewater IPA)."

"Bright copper-colored. Caramel is the driving flavor with some raw grain underneath. Hops are mellow with just a whisper of earthiness. It's a little watery and empty on the finish. Not much to get excited about, in fact, it's barely a step up from Killian's."

""
""

""
"Pours out a dark reddish brown with a thick sticky head that fades quickly. The smell is a nice blend of malts and yeast/bread/nut variety. Tasted very malty and not much in the way of hops or citrus. Medium mouthfeel with a rich finish. I like this style and will drink it again but it won't be right at the top of my list."

"o - Overall a pretty average red ale. The nose is more or less nonexistent, though it tasted better. Easy to drink and something I may drink in a Sam Adams mixed 12 pack, but probably wouldn't purchase a 6 pack of by itself."

"Drinkability is good for an Irish Red. Not a very complex style, but Boston Beer does a good job with this one. More taste than the usual Irish Red, but keeps a good drinkability."
""
"Overall it's a solid beer. I don't know that I would ever seek it out, but I'll drink another one if the opportunity presents itself. I'm not generally a huge Sam Adams fan, and this one kind of falls into the 'well made, decent beer, but nothing spectacular' kind of category that I feel a lot of their stock goes into."

"Overall, this beer is pretty nice. Some of the malt flavors are reminiscent of the Sam Adams Octoberfest. A good all-around ""anytime"" beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best by Jan 12 stamped on the side. This pours a reddish brown color with a nice large foamy off white head. The smells are of caramel and toffee. Feel is medium to light with decent carbonation. The taste is somewhat sweet with a mouthful of caramel along with some biscuit malts a little bit of earthy hop bitterness at the end, pretty good."

"A pleasant brew overall, but again, nothing really stands out - In my opinion, this seems to be a common trait with a lot of Sam Adams beers. Good to try once, but not something I will probably buy again."
"Overall: Sam's got a knack for balance and this is just the beer where that skill pays off. Good representation of the style, it hits all the caramel and bitter notes without abandoning the roast hint that makes and Irish red what it is. Solid brew here."
"a pretty boring beer, good for a newbie craft beer drinker, but just mehh, average."
"Overall- The style doesn't offer much to begin with, and I'm not sure the extremely sweet caramel malt was the best choice to mix with this earthy hop flavor. It becomes distracting."
"Overall: A decent beer. Not as heavy as I would expect for an Irish Red, but still pretty good. Definitely worth trying."
"O - Pretty easy drinking stuff. Nothing to write home about. Just an ok Red. Wouldn't drop money on it but would take one if offered with no problems."
"O: This is by no means a bad beer. Like most Samuel Adams, this beer is tamed down in both flavor and alcohol. It is a good beer for anyone and to be appreciated, but is not trying be cutting edge or anything."
"O: Another solid SA brew. delicious. Make sure that you get a good pour on it I have had this beer before and been less than satisfied I seemed to get it just right this time."
"Medium bodied with a crisp, spicy hop presence up front that lingers over the sweet malts into a slightly dry finish. The hop character up front is spicy and only slightly bitter providing a nice dryness that compliments the sweeter notes. Lots of sweet malt with hints of rye, caramel, toffee, nut and biscuit. Really well balanced and quite quaffable."
"At the moment, I do not know much about red ales, but I found this to be an enjoyably balanced and generally flavorful ale with a malt emphasis. It could use more complexity in the aroma, and have the carbonation toned down a bit, but in general I find this quite acceptable."
"The best so far of the three I’ve tried from the Harvest Collection (not including regular Sam Adams, better than Octoberfest and Pumpkin). A pretty good beer all around."
"While there was nothing unpleasant about this beer and I wouldn't turn it down were it free, I just wasn't very impressed nor left with any desire to try this again."
"overall, one of the better irish red's that i've had."
"O: While I get excited when I see any beer with the name ""Irish"" on it, I almost instantly fell in love with this one. The flavor is upfront and prevelant. However, the combination of hops and low abv lead to Red being extremely drinkable. I buy my beers as singles, but if I had a case of SA Irish Red, it would have been gone before I even had the chance to think about it."
"O: A so-so beer. Easy drinking. Nothing special going on."
"Is a beer good only if it stands out in your memory? Or can a good beer be one that is just very drinkable and gets the job done? Nothing negative to say about this one, just a decent brew that delivers good malt flavor and solidly balanced hop bitterness."
"Overall: A decent beer. Not very complex, and a bit on the sweet side."
"O: The first two sips I liked this beer, but then the aftertaste built up in my mouth. It's just unpleasant and seems to linger on. Too bad, because otherwise it would have been a pleasant fall brew."
"O: Nothing too complex or interesting in this beer. Got it in a combo pack. Nothing worth searching out and not the best example on the style."
"Overall, meh. This is pretty mediocre for an Irish red from SA..."
"Overall - It was pretty unoffensive. Not stellar, but not bad. Just a decent brew."
"O- A more complex beer than I expected. Some nice flavors of caramel. Maybe a bit sweet, but not bad at all."
"D: Really goes down easily.  Typical, and not very complex, but not bad overall. For what it is, it's a good beer for a weekend of watching football."
"Pours an appetizing red caramel with a sticky off white head. Smell is sweet malt-some caramel, fruitiness-maybe banana, not a rich aroma. Taste is sweet malt, not bitter, caramel sweetness continues, weak aftertaste hanging around of the same. Mouthfeel is medium, pleasant. This is another so-so sam adam's offering, nothing really stands out and the cohesion of the parts is far from better than their sum. Too sweet. I won't buy this again, there's nothing to come back to in this beer for me."
"Overall it's not a bad red but isn't outstanding. It's a nice fall beer though."
"Overall the beer was okay, I would say it was pretty average for and irish red. I would have liked it to be less cloying and have some more depth in its flavor profile instead of simply tasting like caramel."
"I'm not super familiar with the style, but if this is a mediocre example of the style, I'm down to explore around. Not my favorite beer, but it was easy to go through the two in the sampler."
"Picked up the new mixed 12. Poured a nice dark red color, with a bit of creamy white head. Pretty standard all around, both on the nose and on the palate. Some earthy hops, sweet malt, a little caramel and an easy drinking medium body. Not bad but not much more."
"Dr: Drinkable but lacking quality, especially for the style. It's priced right, but I won't be buying it again."
"O - Got two of these in a variety pack and will happily finish those. Nothing really stands out in this one, either good or bad."
"Overall a nice effort, no major flaws but not anything that will knock your socks off. Somewhat sessionable: maybe three or four pints"
"O: Another disappointment from the fall seasonal pack. Very lackluster and just not at all tasty or drinkable for me. Maybe I got a bad batch or I'm simply just not in the mood for this one. Very ""meh!"""
"A ""meh"" beer. A good example of an Irish Red, but I don't particularly like that style"
"Balance gets thrown off as it warms. Not as big a red as the last one I tried, but that was from Speakeasy. It’s sweet (there’s that word again!) enough for dessert but session-ish enough to drink more than one."
"This is one of those beers that you can't really say anything bad about, but just does not have enough flavor to make it a true stand out beer."
"This is excellent and I'll be sure to pick up a few more bottles of it while in the season."
"This beer isn't anything too exciting, but I find it to be pleasant and highly drinkable."
"O - Too bad Samuel Adams is the posterboy for craft brewing, yet I think that title is shifting, thankfully, they're beers are nothing special."
"O - Overall, there are better Irish reds out there. I bought this in a Sam Adams variety pack (with Oktoberfest, Black Lager, Pumpkin Ale, etc.) so I'm not too disappointed, and will gladly drink both bottles in the case. I wouldn't go hunting for it, however. It's not bad, it's not fantastic. It's drinkable, and pleasant enough."
"O-It's average. I like it and would drink it again because it is palatable and with the right meal would probably be pretty good."
"Two fingers of frothy thick beige head. Basic amber to red. Aromas of ... boston lager, with an extra floral hop on the nose. Some really mellow and somewhat unexciting flavors. Biscuity malt, a tad of the same floral hop on the nose. Not too bitter--it actually borders on sweet. Light mouth with a lower medium offering of carbonation. Thin cap of head, not much lacing."
"Overall a solid red ale, not overly malty and pretty clean flavors."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a deep ruby red that quickly brightens under direct light. A big, cream colored, foamy head starts around two inches and quickly recedes to a thin film while leaving a thick coating along he glass. Lots of rich malt aromas in the nose, with some light roasty/toasty highlights. Flavors are malty, but sharp, riding a highly carbonated body. Roasted and slightly smokey highlights keep the sweetness in check, and the beer has a somewhat sharp, burnt aftertaste, with a tangy, slightly sour malt overtone. Finish is tangy and slightly cloying, with a coating feel. Pretty standard for the style, but a bit on the middle of the road side compared to other Irish."
"O- I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't seek it out. Not too familiar with the style, but I look forward to trying some other examples."
"Overall, okay, but nothing to go wild about. Standard Irish style ale."
"What can I say - It’s another average mediocre offering from Boston Beer. I think the ABV was actually bumped up a little on this years release."
"O - Overall a nice drinker for the red lovers out there, but on the thin side of things.... But... most reds are thin. Has good taste and smell, but not enough after taste or pungent smell. Good drinker red! Came with the seasonal ""Harvest Collection""!"
"O- A nice smooth and roasty beer, medium drinkability but not very impressive for a red. Very average."
"Pours a deep amber and ends with minimal head. Smells buttery, caramel. The palate says: malty sweetness well balanced with a light dose of hops. This is closer to Smithwick's in Ireland than Smithwick's own imported version. Nothing amazing about this beer, but it does the trick."
"Overall, this beer has promise, but needs to be cleaned up. The odd characters put forth by the hops and/or yeast detract from the drinkability and crispness of an otherwise good example of the style."
"I would love to try this beer on draft. Maybe one day in Boston. I heard they are not that big in Boston. That's just crazy."
"Overall - Not bad. Not one of the best from Samuel Adams but definitely not one of the worst. I would drink this beer again."
"O - Not bad, but not too distinct. For a red ale its character is somewhat lacking. It seems that they couldn't quite get where they wanted to go with this one as the malts don't make much of a statement nor do the hops."
"O-it looked really good when I first poured it so maybe I was expecting a littl more flavor, it's a good beer not to complex"
"Cheers!"
"O - Not that great of a beer. Not much in the way of flavor or aroma. Probably one of my least favorite beers I've tried from Sam Adams."
"In short, another above average Sam Adams offering, though nothing that will drive you mad."
"Not a bad beer, but the flavor here is neither bold nor impressive. Overall, rather forgettable."
"Overall, fairly solid and straightforward for the style, don't mind this it will do in a pinch."
"Very much in the Traditional Irish Red Style ."
"O- Another pretty good, but nor spectacular offering from Sam Adams. Got this as part of a mixed 12, and this is one that neither turns me off of one of their mixed packs, nor turns me onto it."
"Tasty beer that is great in the fall, winter or spring. It could use a bit more complexity and flavor, but is still a good brew."
"Overall Drinkability - Basically watered down black coffee. No, not watered down. Seltzered down. Kinda weird. Not really digging it."
"Overall - a lackluster irish red. Not bad but not particularly interesting either though perhaps it would be a good beer to introduce to someone trying to branch out of the normal BMC offerings."
"I don't have much expierience with ""irish reds"" I have had kilion's which I didn't care for too much. I do have to say that I like this beer a good bit. It has a very full flavor but it's not over powering. The color of this beer is a very nice rich crimson. The flavor are of sweet malts an rich carmel with a slight vanilla wash. I have only seen this beer in sam adams variety packs, which is smelly cause would def. buy it on it's own. Thank ya now."
"Taste followed, but rather thin. Earthy sweet malt, dark grapes, a hint of hops, but certainly malt forward. Pretty easy drinking, but holding back a bit too much in flavor. Certainly on the right track with this one SA, but needs to be a bit more bold."
"O: Nothing special but hits most of the requisites of the style. Could stand more umph in the nose. An easy drinking Irish Red."
"Surprisingly, it took me more than two years into my craft beer orientation to try my first Sam Adams beer and now I enjoy several of SA's offerings, none better than the Boston Lager flagship. But this one has merit, too. Cracked open after a hot night at work, with a tombstone pizza in the oven, poured aggressively into my Samuel Smith pint glass and I must say, it's love at first sight. If I didn't know better, this one looks very much like the Boston Lager. But that's where the similarities end. Smell, I detect some caramel overtones and get flashbacks to a couple of my favorite Irish Reds in Short's Magician and Guinness's Smithwick's. Taste is superb, very refreshing, as well as the mouthfeel. Overall this is a new Sam Adams favorite. Well done Boston Beer Company !!!"
"Like most SA beers, it’s easy drinking because it’s not too bold and smooth and evenly balanced. It’s certainly better warmer and this really does have an above average taste. Overall, I enjoyed this better than most out of the mixed case."
"not bad, though i think the flavor is lacking with the maltiness, its kind of effeminate in that way."
"Pours a nice clear red with fluffy white head. I was surprised by the lack of smell from this beer. Very bitter flavor with a good amount of hops. This really reminds me more of an Imerial IPA than a traditional irish red. This is the least impressed I have been with a Sam Adams in a while, but it is still an ok beer."
"drinkability: a little too hefty to be a session beer, but is highly recommended for a night of steady sippin."
"Smooth, medium bodied and almost creamy. The flavor profile leans more toward light roasted malt with a slightly sweet toast, buttery caramel and a bit of bitter hop flavor toward the end. A very drinkable beer but it doesn't really stand out in a crowd."
"O: A great beer with a very sweet caramel taste that makes it very enjoyable. This beer doesn’t have a lot of “flavor” but if you looking for something good and simple this is your beer."
"O/D-Overall, I am not a big fan of this one. The style is not my favorite. I just do no love the flavor combination here."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and can be considered sessionable, however if I was looking for something with a bit more of an interesting flavor I would try something else."
"A touch of apple flavor seems to clarify the vague nature of the fruitiness that joins the caramel and earthy aromas. Good balance of caramel sweetness and tealike hop character with a dash of earthiness thrown in. Kinda light and creamy with a generous dose of bitterness. Well-constructed and quaffable brew here."
"Pours a small one finger head that is already disappearing, maybe some decent laving. The head is slightly off white, a little unique of a off white really. The body is a dark red, white a big hint of brown, and maybe some hints of orange as well. I'm surprised at how cloudy this beer is, it's not dark enough to not be able to see through it, but it's cloudy enough so that I can't see through it at all. Very small amounts of carbonation from what I can tell. Overall it looks pretty good, but not great. Malt malt and more malt on the nose. Unfortunately it smells like some cheap malt, maybe Munich malt, the kind I'm not a fan of, or maybe just cheap malt, also it just smells way too sweet. Either way it doesn't smell that great, and not very complex at all. No hops on the smell whatsoever, and I would hope for at least a small hop bite in an irish red. This smells just a hair above average. Yeah the taste is just so boring, boring, BORING. I mean this might be the most un-complex beer I've ever had, is that the worst thing you can say about a beer? No, not at all, but it just means it's not going to stand out from the rest at all, and this one doesn't. Is it a bad beer? I don't think so, you can tell they used good ingredients, and they didn't skimp out too much on the beer, it's not very watery or anything, it's just super boring. There just isn't anything good to say about it, there isn't much bad to say about it, but still....it's just like I would feel completely indifferent drinking it, or not drinking it. It's not very refreshing at all, there is basically no hop bite, and the carbonation isn't very high. I guess in terms of mouthfeel it's ok, carbonation is decent and the body feels right in your mouth, it's just the boring taste. I'm trying to decide if I want to give this a 3 for taste or a 3.5 for taste, because I can tell it's made with good ingredients, and I usually give a 3 to a terrible micro brew or a really good adjunct lager, and this isn't a terrible micro brew, just really really boring. I guess what it comes down to is that I think it deserves a C+, not a B-, and I can only get that if I give it a 3, so even though I don't think it deserves a 3, since it's right on the cusp anyways, I'll bump it down for the sake of the overall grade. Drinkability is pretty bad, just because I have no real reason to drink it, I don't have a problem drinking it, but I have no reason to drink it, other than the fact that it's beer, I mean it's not even crisp. Overall, what else can I say, boring, boring, and more boring, pretty average beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Not much of a head at all on the initial pour; after settling, there was just a thin layer of foam. Beer shows a very deep copper-red color appropriate to the style. Aroma is pleasing, showing nice hoppiness, but it is lacking the malty/caramel presence I would expect of the style. Malt is more in evidence upon tasting, along with some unexpected but welcome very subtle background notes of tart cherry. Despite this, I still feel the malt taste is still too restrained. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would have preferred, but the carbonation is nice, tight, and refreshing. Overall, this beer as a whole is a bit greater than the sum of its parts. While it is lacking in a solid malt presence in the nose and on the palate, it is still tasty and refreshing."
"Overall, this is decent beer. I'm not familiar with the style, but this beer is pretty good as far as styles similar to this one goes. For once, the Sam Adams house flavor didn't put me off of a beer, and I think it actually enhanced it and added interest to a good but pretty plain beer."
"Overall - Not my favorite Irish Red. At all. A decent try by those guys at Boston Beer Company though."
"Samuel Adams Irish Ale is a highly sparkling, crystal clear red beer with a thin, yellowish foam that fades to a film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The very malty, slightly sweet aroma has a hint of medicinal hops. It's medium-light bodied and quite lively. It's pretty foamy and it leaves the mouth dry and a little chalky. It's quite malty but it doesn't seem sweet. It's pretty resiny and there's a light herbal bitterness at the finish. It seems like a pretty solid session ale. It's not a main attraction, but it's unoffensive."
"D- Pretty high, I really enjoyed this one. With some minor flaws its an overall good offering from Sam Adams"
"O: I like this one. One of the better I have had from SA. Will try again."
"Overall: I enjoyed the flavor of this one better than many other Irish reds that I've had, but was a bit let down by the metallic twang that I picked up. I rate it average, and would definitely try it again to see if I'm still picking up the metallic note"
"I got this in sampler 12 pack. Not one of my favorites but a decent offering from SA. I can see me having this again maybe during a round of golf."
"Overall I cannot think of many beers that I would turn down over this one that I have had recently. Just calling it how I see it, not my favorite style perhaps"
"A decent beer but nothing really sticks out to me. Not as solid as many other Sam Adams offerings."
"Overall: This beer is kind of boring, but it is a good beer to drink when you are not looking to get messed up. It is solid."
"If anyone knows a great one that's easily accessible let me know. I hate writing off a style."
"D- not my favorite beer from samuel adams. not a really exciting beer at all. id drink it in a pinch, but its not something ill actively be seeking out."
"Poured this Irish Red ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer poured a dark amber color and it produced a small amount of head. Head retention was poor but the lacing is very nice. The Aroma was a nice; caramel and malt came through. The beer itself is medium in body and it is malty sweet. There are some hints of toasted malt but not enough in my opinion for the style. This beer is barely average."
"O: Some of my craft beer friends go nuts over this, but personally, I've had better. I would basically place this a half notch above most of the reviews on BA."
"Not my favorite from the sample pack I bought, it had a little too much yeast flavor for my taste."
"O: Not bad, but not one I will purchase again. Overall very bland."
"Pretty good SA. As I said I don't mind this coming in my Variety Packs but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy a six pack of it as I would Oktoberfest. Nice starter red, but I prefer the Dunk that comes in the Fall Pack. Stay thirsty my friends."
"I find it odd that it's taken me this long to try this beer. Oh well. It pours a clear russet-garnet topped by a half-finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises toffee, orange peel, light black pepper, and light toasted rye bread. The taste amps things up a good deal, leaving me with notes of peppery toffee, toasted rye bread (plenty o' crust), and clove-y orange zest. I gotta say, I enjoy this stuff. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a nice, malty Irish red, something I could see drinking over and over if presented with the proper situation."
"O- Average beer, nothing to really bash or truly praise. I Enjoy this beer and will continue to drink it, as it comes in the Samuel Adams variety pack. But I can't say I would ever buy a 6 pack of it by itself."
"Overall: A nice tasty Red."
"I like this beer, I just don't feel that it's as good as it could be. The color of this beer is a very nice red. The malts and hops are there on every sip. The head doesn't last very long. The Beer is very drinkable and worth trying anytime. I just feel that there are better Sam Adams brews out there."
"Nothing wrong with this beer. Worth drinking."
"Overall: Easy session beer, but seems just average to me. I think Great Lakes Conway's Irish Ale ruined this beer for me. I have no problem drinking more, but I would gladly go for anything else in my fridge. I remember getting this when it was first available, and not being too impressed with it, and that was when the only Irish Red I could compare it to was Smithwicks. I would pick most Sam Adams brews over this. Looks like something I won't get again unless it is in another mixed 12 pack."
"Overall: Apart from the Triple Bock, Utopias, and Imperial Series, Sam Adams aims to not offend. It's a nice change from the ""bigger is better"" style that permeates the West Coast, (and which I LOVE), but I don't know that it's bombastic enough to stand out in a lineup. If I had 6 or 7 decent beers in a night, I would be afraid that the Irish Red would fade into the background. Like all of Sam Adams' beers, it is certainly a safe bet, and with Sam Adams being distributed everywhere, it's almost certain you'll be able to find it."
"I am not a huge fan of this style, but I found this beer to be quite sessionable and enjoyable. It is not all that complex, but it does taste quite good and what few flavors make up the whole package are rich and true. Just like the White, this was a bit of a pleasant surprise from this mixed twelve pack."
"Overall: The brew looks amazing but does not give any extraordinary reasons to purchase more. Its not bad tasting by any means, just not exceedingly impressive. Slightly above average for style."
"Finish: Grassy and earth"
"Once again....Samual Adams does what many think impossible....a micro taste in a from a macro brewer!! This beer is red/amber with decent white head and good lacing. As with most reds, the smell is weak. The taste is decent, along the Killians line...mouthfeel is easy so it could be a lllooonnngggg SESSION! Top of the evening to YA!"
"Nicely whipped up and frothy light tan head, crests around two fingers, decent staying power in spite of its general delicacy, in turn has a credible amount of lacing sticking around. Brown to red amber in color, darker than most while also unblemished with transparency and clarity, decent activity in the bubbles. The nose is very malty and smooth with caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar and ripe cherry, plum and apricot fruit scents, has some peat, tar and earth elements as well, light grass presence but hops not factoring in here. Full-bodied, well-carbonated and close to fluffy through the attack, immediately covers the mouth from cheek-to-cheek. Lays on that molasses, brown sugar, maple, caramel, however, a brush of pine, orange citrus, raw grains, and straw helps dry it out as it moves forward. Retains that mix of cherry, berry to peach, apricot fruit. One of those beers that's hard not to like when it's in your glass and going down the gullet but unlikely to make you want to pull the trigger on a future purchase."
"Final Notes: A pretty good beer. It's nothing just out of the park, but it's a solid choice and one of the better Irish Reds I've had the pleasure of drinking. An ideal selection for a ""first beer."""
"A pretty good beer overall, easy to drink and nicely balanced."
"OVERALL GRADE: B-/B"
"Drinkability / Overall: Despite the lack of smell (which I still don't get - maybe it's me) it's a good beer. Very drinkable and I could have another - balanced, good and malty, and nice to look at. Not an amazing Irish red, but quite good. Cheers!"
"O - This is my first ""Overall"" score since the change from drinkability. I will put less emphasis on ABV considerations and things like that and focus on the overall impression of the beer. That said, the beer is a perfectly average Irish Red. It goes down easy and tastes fairly average. A alright beer, but I'd probably just settle for a Killian's due to the price of that beer and my not-so-discerning tastes for the Irish Red."
"D: Very -this is good. Pleasant, I'd have another. Easy to drink."
"Medium-full body with a dry malty finish showing a dash of hops."
"D/O- A very ""sessionable"" beer here. This would be a good one to have a 6 pack of when the focus isn't on the beer. One of the weaker BBC beers in my opinion."
"D - An easy drinking sessionable offering from the Boston Beer company... There's nothing remarkable about it, but it goes down very easily... Could have several of these in a sitting and I would never shy away form drinking in the future..."
"a beer that would be served at a happy hour said one of my drinking buddies. This is a amber red pour with a head that fades somewhat quick. Nose of dextrose and grain. Palate of just about the same too. Mellow feel but no consistent quality besides a lingering protein and aged sugars. Sees a bit too gritty like a one dimensional malt forward lager."
"D - Very drinkable, but mostly because there is not all that much going on. Pretty smooth but also not very exciting and a bit watery. Could have used some more intensity in a few areas."
"D-A very bland beer, one of Sam Adams worse offerings. I figured I'd get this and the White Ale out of the way first. There are better examples of the style and better offerings from Sam Adams. Don't waste your time with this one (unless your doing the whole Irish St. Patty's thing) or you desire to try all of Sam Adams once in your life.."
"Pours a nice amber red with a one finger tan head that fades to a single ring of lace. Aroma is mostly sweet caramel malts. Flavor-wise, you get that same caramel malt with some mild earthy hops bitterness. Dry finish. Medium bodied, slightly creamy mouthfeel. It is a little better than Killian's, however."
"Got this in a variety pack, reddish in color, white read, very mild body lighter than other reds, smooth, not much of an aftertaste, smell slightly sweet, not overly impressed, good for the style, very basic, nothing to crazy, would drink it again if in the mood for an IRA, but never really in the mood for an IRA"
"Very drinkable on its own or in quantity, not too rich in taste but not too weak either."
"D - This is an OK beer, but not something I will go out of my way for. I'd probably pick it over a Killian's IR, but I won't be keeping it in my fridge."
"D - Very drinkable, either on its own or as a session."
"Pours a dark amber-brown color with little to no head. Smells malty and a little buttery. Palate is mostly caramel malts with some notes of raisan and toffee. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Somewhat drinkable but is pretty much an average brew."
"Clear, deep copper with an inch of beige foam. Bready aroma, malty and caramel, faint grassiness. Same in the flavour, light bitterness that lingered in the finish, kind of a spicy and metallic end after a grassy middle. Slight alcohol character, lightish bodied with average carbonation. This one just didn't come together for me and felt a little harsh."
"Overall this beer has a nice sweet maltiness with a touch of hops to it. Although it is a tasty and average brew, I have to say I did it enjoy it and would drink another."
"D: while not bad, I believe BBC phoned this beer in. Still, BBC rarely misfires when it comes to the look of a beer."
"Drinkability: Average when it comes to Irish ales, which happen to be a favorite of mine for their bitterness and texture, but it wasn't bad atall. Definitely a brew I would try again espically with St. Patrick's day around the corner. Recommended if your a fan of the Irish ale genere, but if you've had smithwicks or Killian's, then this a beer for you. Cheers!"
"D) A nice brew. I'd have another one."
"Clear, dark amber color with thin, off-white head. Good head retention. Floral hops aroma with some caramel and bready malts. Caramel flavor predominates with some earthy and floral characteristics. A bit astringent and somewhat too acidic; medium bodied with a touch of bitterness."
"D: sweet and tasty. very refreshing and drinkable."
"The CPJ"
"Not terribly interesting, but not bad either. I could drink several of these if nothing more interesting was available, but I don't think it's worth seeking out."
"D - No complaints here. It goes down easy and I was looking forward to another."
"Pass."
"I would recommend the SA American mixed 12-pack for this brew and Revolutionary Rye alone."
"D - Not bad at all. Nothing extra special, but a solid Irish red."
"D: Bought this as part of a mixed sixer looking for beers to use in my beer tasting class so I only have one bottle, good thing! Sam Adams are some of my favorite beers but not this one. One is enough!"
"Pours a dark red with little head. No retention or lacing. Has light sweet aromas of roasted malt. The aroma carries through in the taste. With a hint of caramel. Lightly sweet roasted malt. Little to no hops presence. The mouthfeel is smooth and light, with moderate carbonation. Another very drinkable beer from Boston Brewing Company. It's good, but boring. There's nothing that gives it a red ale flavor. No toastiness, or richness that makes me think of ""ale"". Easily drinkable, but not worth seeking out over other offerings."
"D - GOod for drinking, even though its not that good for tasting."
"D=decent but the sweetness brings it down"
"Drinkability: Ends with this weird tartness and a lingering liquorish flavor I could do without. Meh. I hate to dish any craft brewery, but this brew... is lacking."
"Easy to drink, but not a standout from Sam Adams."
"Not something I would buy again"
"Samuel Adams Irish Red was amber in color with good clarity. It had a beige head with decent retention with a little lacing. The smell was sweet malt and a little toasty. The taste was a little sweet upfront with toasted malt and some balancing bitterness. The finish was dry and balanced. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and good carbonation. The drinkability was good as well. This is a nice and well made Irish Red Ale and worth a try."
"D- Pretty tasty but I don't know if I could drink more than a few"
"D- I would say this one if very drinkable. Picture something like a Killians Irish red with more of a bite."
"D: Balanced and very well-rounded. Robust enough without being overly complex. A fine drinking and interesting example of a lesser made style that often comes off as cloyingly simplified."
"As others have said, there aren't a lot of Irish reds on the market and Sam's offering while not a world class beer is a pretty good representation of the style and a lot better option than many of the mass produced Irish beers on the market today."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at July. Pours a rusty red color with almost no head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of bread, malts, and butter. Taste is buttery and bready, almost tastes like a Ritz cracker. A bit of a caramel twinge to it as well. Malty. Overall, it is an alright beer but definitely belongs in a mix 12 pack and not on it's own."
"I would turn to this guy if I wanted an all night beer that still had a decent flavor. It is still far from impressive, though, but I guess that is what is to be expected from an Irish Red. To be honest, I haven't had too many of this style (mainly just Killian's) so I as far as I know, this is as good as they come."
"Notes: Recommended. Other than lacking in the appearance category, this drink was great. Red ales are one of my favorite styles, and I will come back to this brew in the near future."
"Two finger head no lacing little carbonation. Beer itself is amber red. Smells of chocolate, malt, vanilla and some hops. Taste is very similiar. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is high. Very good beer that could be improved by better look. Worth your buy"
"Overall Impression:Looks better than it tastes. Tastes alright but nothing really special here. Glad they always have at least a few bottles of boston lager in there mixes to persuade me to try out the out the others."
"D: Actually, pretty good as a session beer. Though maybe a bit strong."
"Pours a nice amber color with a frothy beige head that leaves impressive lacing and retains well. The aroma is nice and earthy, with big fleur de sel caramel notes upfront, along with some grassy hops, red delicious apples, toasted bread, fruity esters and a faint hint of roast. The flavor is similar, with salty caramel notes initially, as well as red delicious apples, grassy hops, toasted bread, fruity esters, and some slight roasted notes. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, and drinkability is outstanding. A really strong effort from SA here, probably the best or second best Irish Red I've had, very sessionable."
"Quite drinkable, a nice change to the really bitter beers i normally prefer. Brings to mind sitting in a pub in the UK, sipping pints til the early morning. Not the best red, but worth a try, it's drinkable and affordable when it's on sale."
"Taste is largely unadventurous, which means its definitely brewed to style. Breadiness, moss flavor. Can't detect hops, much like the majority of the SA profile. Easy enough to drink, but isn't going to knock your socks off. A suitable upgrade for your BMC swilling friends."
"Overall, it's hard to say too much about this beer for its style. This style isn't going to wow anyone, but this Irish Red can please anyone looking for a simple and refreshing ale."
"Drinkability is good, nothing too exciting, but there's enough here to keep me interested for a bottle or two."
"A decent beer. Nothing off putting, just a little too boring. I would like to see stronger malt flavors and a bigger mouthfeel. Easy drinking."
"C'mon, sirs, you can do a little better than this. I won't be ordering one of these anytime soon."
"M/D - The first foamy sips are the best, smooth and rich, full of that butterscotch feel, medium body though, and easy to come back for another"
"Another review of a Sam Adams brew. Pours a ruby red color with about two fingers of white head that has some lacing. Smell is of caramel malts and also has some biscuit notes. Taste starts out somewhat sweet from the caramel malts, has a bready taste through the middle, then finishes kind of bitter with a hint of hops. The aftertaste is dry, and a little unpleasant but not enough to ruin the overall taste and experience. Drinkability wise, a few at a time is about the limit due to the aftertaste. Definitely not a session beer. Overall, another good offering from Sam, but far from their best."
"Pours a clear ruby red-amber color with a medium-small white head. Scent is somewhat buttery with biscuit/bread aromas. I also get some caramel malt and a bit of dark fruits. Taste is nice balance of malts with very subtle bread flavors and earthy notes. Hop flavors are there, but not really anything too special. Mouthfeel is somewhat full-bodied with a slightly unpleasant finish. Drinkability is fair."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is thick and rich but also creamy and dry on the end. Very drinkable and a nice transition beer between wintery stouts and summer wheat beers."
"M & D - very clean, very drinkable. Great red. Sweetens a bit as it warms but not too sweet. Great balance."
"Fuller medium body, higher carbonation, very sticky and chewy. Pretty drinkable, but a forgettable flavor profile and an easy loser when compared to other hopped up ambers."
"D: Like most SA beers, this is pretty drinkable and tastes pretty good. Nothing too special about this one though"
"D - Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. It is pretty good, but it seems pretty average. I would try again, but I'd like to see what other red ales are out there."
"D: Good enough. I'm ok with Irish Reds. Not a huge fan but they are ok in my book. This seems to be a decent Irish Red. I would drink again."
"Pours a cloudy reddish brown. Creamy head, dissipates quickly. Mildly bitter aroma, cant quite place it. Very malty taste, again slightly bitter, with some sweetness of the caramel variety. Detecting a hint of fruit, faint raisin. The mouthfeel is thick, yet crisp, the carbonation is perfect. The only thing holding this beer back is the aroma, which (at least this bottle) was slightly pungent or off. Worth a try, but it may need more consumptuary investigation. Yep, created a word there.... Consumptuary... It means to consume a beverage, primarily beer, for a purpose related to sharing information regarding said beverage with other consumers"
"overall it was not a bad beer by any means, but just seemed to be lacking overall for my taste."
"Poured from the bottle a crimson red with a decent off white head that lingered for some time. Smell was dominated by sweet malt a bit of roast to it but mostly caramel malt. Taste pretty much the same very one sided caramel malt with hardly a trace of hops to be found. Too sweet with no balance. Mouthfeel was decent, the beer had some smooth creaminess to it. Drinkability is there if you like the beer but I for one will not purchase another one of these. Sam adams has some decent brews but this isn't one of them"
"Overall, this is pretty descent stuff. It can go up against the modern day Smithwick's for sure."
"D- Very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is an average beer in a not so common style, so it is an acceptable choice. I like it, but I am waiting to get my hands on other offerings in the same style such as Great Lakes Conway's Irish Ale and Three Floyd's Brian Boru. Worth a try in the meantime."
"The mouthfeel is just about right, it's highly carbonated and on the lighter side of medium bodied. It's also very drinkable. A solid beer from Sam Adams. It won't offend or amaze, but is an enjoyable drink."
"This beer has a white head and ok lacing the color is redish brown with maltt aromas, this beer is overal pretty average and has a good balance f flavors of both malt and hops, I wouldn't say this is sam adams best beer but it sure isn't the worst u will have and is worth trying at least once"
"If you are a fan of Irish Red Ales - try this one as I don't think you will be disappointed, it's an easy drinker too."
"Boston Beer Company--Samuel Adams--Irish Red--Brewmaster's Collection--Harvest Collection--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.80% ABV. 15 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) Thick pour. Lacy off white rocky head. Clear dark enticing amber red color. Sweet malty toasted mild floral hop front. Malty biscuity cloying creamy mellow sweet caramel toffee mild fruit body. Malty tasty smooth mild hop end. Easy to drink. Well made. Not sure how to evaluate fidelity to the style. Sampled 12/26/2010. Harvest Mix Pack purchased @ Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle for $13.99 on 8/31/2010."
"The beer pours a reddish color with an off-white head. A nice looking beer overall. The aroma is classic red ale with notes of toffee and caramel, as well as some grassy hops. The flavor is dominated by the toffee, caramel and biscuit malt notes. I also get some light cocoa and some grassy hops. The beer has a slight bit of bitterness to it, but it is fairly sweet tasting overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I am not usually a fan of Irish Red Ales, but this one is not bad at all. Definitely one of the best that I have tried."
"This is a hit for me. Sam Adams got this one right, if I see it in a six pack id buy one."
"Pours into a dark red body with a small tan head that has decent retention and good lacing. The smell is of caramel, some malts, butterscotch, and some hops. The taste is a sweet caramel and ice tea like flavor with a hint of butterscotch and ends with some bitterness at the tip of the tongue. It has a very sticky mouthfeel that sticks to the lips in this light to medium bodied brew that has some carbonation to it. This is a very drinkable beer that I would have given it a 5.0 in drinkability if not for the harsh stickiness of it."
"All in all, a decent malty beer."
"Bottled poured into a pint glass. Dark and cloudy, like turbid ice-t in color. Decent almond head and some lacing. Nothing outstanding in the smell category, mostly of malts and light nuts and citrus. Mouthfeel was pretty full, lots of carbonation. Not a real crisp sensation, little chalky. Its a very tastey and drinkable brew. Its worth a shot."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark red color with an off white foamy head. Light carbonation and some lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel malt, fruit and touch of hops. Firm, reach, slightly oily body. Flavor is juicy, sweet caramel malt, fruit perfectly balanced by earthy hops. Finish becomes dry and earthy. I like this beer a lot."
"D - goes down very smooth. definitely good choice for a hearty dinner."
"This brew has a very intense and strong aroma. That will be the first thing you notice when you pop the cap n one of these. VEry average Irish red, a bit disappointing for Boston Beer CO. If you must drink a red, you cant go wrong with Killians. Now if youre at a party and someone gives you one of these for free, you'll enhoy it."
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. Another decent offering from Sam Adams. It's worth a try."
"very good beer overall with and enjoyable flavor. has malty floavor with perfect amount of caramel. i would reccomend it to everyone. has more caramel flavor then killians irish red and other irsih reds. goes great with thanksgiving dinner. thank you sam adams"
"Drinkability - might rate higher if not for the weird feeling after a few sips. I feel like I need to brush my teeth, and this makes me neither willing nor able to drink more than one."
"Purchased this beer in a variety pack of Samuel Adams. This particular beer was very smooth with an exceptional head when poured into a nice pint glass. The aroma of this beer made my mouth water and it tasted as good as it smelled. Another great beer by Samuel Adams."
"My dad purchased this as a part of a mixed 12 pack containing 6 different beers. Pours a clear, fairly bright, amber colour with thin off-white head. Mild lacing down the glass. Smells mostly of caramel, bread and toasted malt. Flavour is quite sweet, not much hop bitterness at all. A fairly nice red ale."
"Notes: A little too much diacetyl for my taste. Vinous and raisin-like esters are totally out of place, and the warming alcohol sensation is a bit much for a Red. I suppose the yeast is the culprit here. I'm not digging it."
"Drinkability is great, with the wonderful and aromatic scent and a taste to back it up. Alcohol is pretty lightweight, meaning you can down quite a few of these if you so had the inclination. I do find myself wishing I had another one, and isn't that one of the bigger compliments that can be made about a beer?"
"D: Sam Adams lives up to its reputation, and the Sam Adams brews are no exception. The problem is I don't expect much. I can't see how people think this company is even in the same league as SN. There is nothing special about this beer. A decent brew but not something I would ever buy."
"Drink Ability is through the roof! I can probably have about six of these and be upset I only got a six pack of it. Although, it's very robust, it's still light enough to keep wanting to drink more."
"Beer is medium bodied and mildly sweet. I think they forgot to add flavor to this beer. There is a mild bitterness at the end. This is a homebrewing trick. If you add roasted barley during the sparge you get a red color and no roast. Ever once in a while I get a little roastiness from commercial beers that use this trick. I don't funk I'll bother with this beer again."
"Irish Reds are one of my least favorite styles, so I could be a little biased here."
"Though the sight and smell of this beer weren't particularly enthralling, I must remind myself not to judge a book by its cover. The taste and body more than account for what I perceive as shortcomings, and the balance is excellent. I haven't had too many of this style, but I would get this beer again, regardless. Samuel Adams seems to constantly live up to my expectations and this is no exception."
"I drink a few of these every chance I get."
"Got a real surprise with this one. I removed the cap from the dark brown bottle and it erupted with a slow gush of head onto my kitchen counter. I about cried over gushed beer. Big light brown, billowy head of tight bubbles. As the head of three fingers calmed down it left some amazing lace on the side of my mug. Color is a 24 on the SRM chart. Rich smell of caramel, yeast, sweet barley, and roasted wheat. Enchanting taste that starts with a wave of roasted wheat and citrus, a good tart flavor of hops in the middle and a finish of caramel that lingers in the back of my throat. The flavor is well balanced and refreshing. Feels like whip cream in my mouth. I could get hooked on this beer, but I have not found an Irish Red I didn't like, so far."
"Drinkability: Better than I thought it would be, and definitely an enjoyable beer on a cool fall night with those warm caramel malts; body isn't too heavy and the ABV is pretty moderate and it wouldn't too intoxicating to sit back and have a couple of these."
"D: Nearly perfect it wasn't for that annoying soapiness."
"OVercarbonated and thin, tinny mouthfeel. Needs more body and less carbonation. A suitable offering and certainly a change of pace from macros."
"Carbonation level seems off. It is harsh at first but by the finish the beer thins out too much and feels watery. This is easy drinking though. If you want lots of malt flavors in a package under 6% ABV then this is a good option."
"Overall, an average ale yet different from your run of the mill mass produced ale. A nice change once in awhile."
"This about as middle of the road a red as I've had. Absolutely nothing about it grabs you and makes you want to have more. Lots of carbonation. Good appearance. However, I tried two at one sitting (my preferred method) and they both made me go.. ""Umph... I had better.... I have had worse."" I might drink more than a couple if they were free but I definitely wouldn't seek this out in a store."
"Probably my least favorite out the harvest pack but thats not saying its a bad beer by any stretch. I wouldn't say no to one if offered for sure"
"Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, earthy and a caramel malt. In the taste, earthy, caramel sweet, and a malty end. A small hop presence all the way through. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry hop, and slight caramel sweetness in the aftertaste. Easy to drink and nice hop presence."
"Overall a pretty average red ale by SA but nothing impressive."
"I poured the beer into a pint glass, it has a light red color body with a little bit of head to it. The aroma is of sweat malts and a little bread. The taste is sweet and balanced of malt and hops but more malt than anything and sweet lingers after you swallow. Great mouth feel and is very drinkable."
"D: An OK beer. Nothing too bold or exciting going on."
"D - This beer (compared to the Lucky 13) fell kind of short than what I would expect of the beer but it did have a nice level of sweetness that would keep me drinking the last three in the case. Pretty nice."
"Part of the Harvest Collection twelve pack. Poured into a stemmed beer glass. Very dark red color, with a surprisingly good sized head. An impressive looking Irish Red ale. Smell was petty mediocre, nothing too outstanding. Taste was reasonably good for the style. Liked the malt flavor, and it also had a bit of earthiness to it. Just a slight spice profile also. Mouthfeel was good, as I found this beer to be hearty enough for my liking, plus it was smooth enough to drink easily. A fairly decent Irish Ale. Since I don't buy much of this style, it wasn't bad, and I'd consider picking some up again. But like I said, I don't buy this style very often, so I guess I'll only see it in variety packs etc."
"This beer pours a nice garnet red color with a decent off white foam head. The aromas consist mainly of some caramel malts and the faintest of hops in the background. The flavors are intensely malty with little to no hop flavor to be located. The flavors consist mainly of caramel, both burnt and unburnt, as well as some lightly toasted malts, but very little citrus from the hops as I would have expected. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy for my liking, but overall it's not too bad. It's a nice drinkable beer that I could easily have some other times, it's not outstanding, but it's pretty good."
"D. I would definitely buy some more of these."
"Pours an amber caramel color with an off white head. Nose brings some toasted bread and a bit of caramel. Taste is pretty much limited to lightly-toasted white bread and light hints of caramel. Feel is a light to medium body. Not typically a super-flavorful style, but this one is a bit lacking even in comparison."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation and a slightly sweet aftertaste, with a bit of dryness. Overall a decent beer, but not one I would hurry to buy again. I also would not refuse one if it was offered to me."
"Overall, it's an above-average party beer, but with so many good beers out there, why settle for this?"
"Drinkability was good - this is one of my favorites from the Sam Adams Harvest pack."
"D- Easy and smooth to drink if consumed when fresh. A nightmare to drink when it's skunked or stale."
"D- it's an adequate offering when included in mixed packs or given for free, but it's not really much to fuss about"
"Drinkability - Not terribly complex, but decent-tasting. Easy to drink and fairly smooth."
"Highly recommended brew from Samuel Adams here. I'm impressed, and will soon get more."
"Has that nice red colour and a big head. The beer is quite flavouful with a good mouthfeel and lots of quality malt to show its legs. I applaud Sam Adams for over the years doing a good job bringing underappreciated styles to public forefront and packaging them in a well priced well made fashion"
"Overall I thought this was a damn good irish red and i wish i had more. If i was at the bar and had a choice between this and killians i think i would choose the sam adams every time."
"D. Nice balanced beer, nothing outstanding, but good nonetheless."
"Overall this is an average red ale. It's a nice little beer for the price. Not bad if you want simple, predictable but drinkable red ale."
"Fairly drinkable."
"D - well, its pretty good. very drinkable, and would make a great intro beer for some light lager diehards. pair this with some pulled pork and coleslaw."
"Flavor follows the nose with a balanced caramel sweetness that isn't as rich as initially thought. Offers a good texture and a moderately lingering finish. A pleasant carbonation keeps the feel from getting too slick and keeping the drinkability reasonably strong. Another decent seasonal from Sam that outclasses their standard lineup yet doesn't try too hard either."
"Reddish copper with a thin head and some lacing, would like to see it a bit brighter. The smell is of caramel malts and floral hops with a bit a diacetyl butteryness. Nothing too exciting with the taste but it is still better than average for the style. Caramel malts provide the backing over which there is classic English hoppiness, floral and earthy with enough bitterness to balance the malt. I'm somewhat reminded of boston lager and sam's octoberfest with this beer maybe by the yeast. Mouthfeel too is good the finish is clean and the beer is quite crisp with lively carbonation. Drinkability is good. This is another good offering from the BBC they don't amaze but manage to make solid representations of any style they attempt."
"Pretty bland but enjoyable, wouldn't go out of my way to buy this again but I'd like to try other Irish Red Ales."
"D- Very easy to drink and a decent example for the style but certainly not the best the style has to offer"
"This is an acceptable beer. The amount of sweet malt was surprising. It could probably pass for a somewhat rich EPA."
"This is a very tasty brew, classic flavor."
"Overall this is a fine beer and a Samuel Adams standout."
"Drinkability- 3.5 out of 5. All bitching about the body aside, this is a good, balanced beer. There is nothing challenging or strong about it; it's just an easily-swallowed, good-tasting, mouth-pleasing mild little brew, as an Irish Red should be. The drinkability score only takes a hit because of the beer's price; it's good, but not quite good enough for me to buy six packs on a regular basis. Look for single bottles or try it at the bar if you're on a budget."
"Pretty drinkable, good fall or springtime beer, maybe a little in the winter. Wouldn't recommend it in the summer so much. I nice beer drinkers beer, but I wouldn't like it on a warm day. I think it fall short of the Brick Red by Sam Adams, but it's still pretty good."
"D: Sweet and engaging, but still enjoyable to the finish. Not SA's best offering, but a decent brew nevertheless."
"A good brew. Will drink more, even as a session beer."
"Drinkability: A really good fall beer. Although it's not too heavy to be enjoyed whenever. Goes down easier than I expected."
" D- The malt flavors are a bit light and muted which is fine but the the sulfury bitterness of the hops is pretty strong. The nougat quality also grows a bit and covers some of the malt flavors."
"D-very poor, as the beer goes on, the flavors just become more and more bland. I had to drink a water with this beer just to constantly wash out the yucky after-taste that develops."
"Pours a clear, reddish copper with a small off-white head. Aromas are subdued but good. I get light aromas of caramel with just a whiff of Maraschino cherries and a hint of earthiness. Taste is predominately malty, with toastiness and caramelly flavors up front and a cherry-like tartness on the finish. Medium full body is perfectly carbonated and luxurious. Very nice."
"Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass, nice amber color but the head was unimpressive. Has a sweet, malty smell to it, average carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Taste is sweeter than I expected, malty caramel, not much hop bitterness. Definitely better than Killian's, but I'm sure there are still better Irish Reds out there. This one is decent, just not remarkable. Drinkability is pretty high though, it would be easy for most drinkers to go through a few of these."
"This is definitely my least favorite out of the Fall mix 12-pack. Gimme more of the Pumpkin!!!"
"D- low alcohol and not very complex, but an easy drinker that's great for this time of year"
"Pours a deep transparent red color, i suppose ruby would be a good word to describe it. Head stands about 2"" after the pour and is cream in color. It dissipated after the first couple sips but it left a few thin rings of lacing. Smell is mellow, sort of a sweet caramel malt with a slight bit of a clean snap to it, no hops in the nose. Taste starts with the malts, tastes like a caramel malt, then I get a slightly spicy hop, on the way down it coast your throat with a caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. Overall, not one of my favorites, but its a decent beer."
"If you can get it, this is a much better example of an Irish Red Ale than the popular macro that everyone knows. A dashing attempt!"
"D: High."
"D - It has hints of the Oktoberfest, but is just not well balanced. There is something funky in the aftertaste that puts me off. A bit too malty for me to session."
"Drinkability: A solid Irish Red."
"medium-bodied with medium carbonation. pretty style-standard. i wouldn't mind another (that said, nor would i necessarily seek one out)."
"Good drinker, tasty."
"Drinkability isn't great due to the sweetness."
"Pours a 1/4 inch head which fades to absolutey nothing. Dark beer which when held up to the light reveals brown and red ochre color. Taste is OK, you get some malt, a litte sweetness, but not complex. A drinkable beer, just a thoroughly average beer to me."
"Overall this is a malt bomb for how low the ABV is. Pass is an understatement."
"Pretty good."
"M+D: The sweetness of the caramel malts on the finish makes this one less than desirable on the tongue over time. There's obviously quite a bit of carbonation, but the sweetness overwhelms the rest of the experience and makes everything a little bit overwhelming. The beer just doesn't taste good enough to warrant putting up with the cloying mouthfeel, and I'll be using the other bottle from my variety pack as a mid-session one-off. I am a Sam Adams apologist in a big way, but I can't believe that they'd drop the Scotch Ale from the fall variety pack and still have this one in it. Eh, at least it isn't Sam Adams Light."
"A solid, no-frills brew. Very sessionable, and pretty well-done. A worthy addition to the SA line and Harvest Collection."
"D-It's been awhile since I've had this beer, and my opinion of it is much higher than it was the last time I tried it. Pretty easy drinking beer with some nice, rich flavors without being too overwhelming."
"Poured into a pint glass a nice amber red with a thick froathy slighty off white head. Great lacing. The scent is of light sugary malts. The taste is rather light as well. There's some carmel flavors that mellow nicely to a slightly bitter flavor at the end. Not much to this one. The moughtfeel is ok making this a rather drinkable beer I guess."
"d 3 getting harder and harder for me to distinguish between SA and the Michelob craft oriented offerings. they occupy a middle ground between ultraboring swill and interesting, flavorful beer."
"I have to preface this by saying that I'm simply not a fan of the style, but this was in my sampler pack so here it is. It does have the requisite amber/red coloring. The head is pretty fleeting. Not a lot in the nose...caramel is probably the dominant scent. Taste is pretty similar. Just not a whole bunch of flavor here. Nuttiness and caramel are most prevalent. There's certainly nothing off-putting, it's just not something that makes me yearn for another drink. Hey, it's much better than Killian's."
"The palate gets wrapped in a light blanket of malt and alcohol that fades is a subtle brown sugar finish. A nice comfortable and non-complex brew going on here. I found the Sam Irish Red a pleasant example of a style that does'nt get around too much. Pssst ... I'm drinking one right now. God Bless the Woman of the House."
"Pours a very dense looking reddish color with some brown highlights and a big off white frothy head that lasts for a while. Nice lacing and really pretty blood orange color. The aroma is sweet sticky malts, similar to an Oktoberfest but more full bodied,. Great flavors of toasted bread, caramel and a nice spiciness that balances out the malts. Touch of acidity too. Mouthfeel and drinkability are fantastic. Really a great red ale from Sam Adams and now one of my favorites."
"D - A very nice Irish Red with lots of flavor for a low ABV brew. think I'll have another."
"Wouldn't recommend it, but would still drink it."
"I guess this is my first Irish Red and is a pretty good beer from Sam Adams, although a little on the sweet side for my tastes."
"A solid, translucent dark red. A thick tan head sticks to the glass. Smell is also impressive, sweet caramel malts. I like the taste, not too dark, and with enough bitterness to make it nicely complex and refreshing. Finish and feel are good, mildly carbonated. All in all, just a solid beer, and great with a burger!"
"D - Well it's quaff-able like a Sam Adams brew is supposed to be. I really liked the smooth feel of the beer with it's semi rich malty flavor profile. I could easily toss back a sixer of this one, a decent beer that I'd have again but probably wouldn't buy again. Worth a try though."
"d: It's very smooth, therefore, very drinkable. If your looking for a mild and smooth red, Sam Adams Irish Red fits the bill."
"SAB, Sam Adams Brewery, not to be confused with that other behemoth, always comes to play. Let's give this brew a whirl. Popping the top yields a very malty smell with a bit of red licorice and butterscotch. On the pour the beer is a deep red with a micro bubble foamy two finger head with a pillowy top. The taste starts slightly bitter, then the malt backbone kicks in for a sweeter middle. The finish is a lingering bittersweet flavor that fades into a dry aftertaste. Good mouthfeel that starts strong but fades to the clean finish. Very good balance and very drinkable. Not a standout, but as always, much better than your average brew."
"For some reason it came rushing out of the bottle when i uncapped it. Dark copper body, no head. Scent is all sweet malt. Taste is red ale malts, a fair amount of bittering hops. Kind of a brown sugar taste. Medium bodied and fairly wet. Certainly not a bad beer, but just not my style to begin with. Sam Adams never puts out a bad beer though, this is pretty good."
"D: Nothing wrong with this one, but nothing special. Meh."
"My apologies, Jim, but I probably won't pick this one up again. Looking forward to SA's Winter seasonals."
"Pretty darn good as far as my understanding of the style goes."
"The only thing that I would tire on after a while is the cherry-berry and maybe the fullness of the beer. In fact after just one bottle at times the cherry-flavor gets a bit annoying if you're not in the fruity mood."
"Overall a smooth and well balanced beer. I think this is better than the real deal, that being Kilkenny or Smithwicks."
"Overall I thought it was a little forgettable. This was a C+ on taste and smell - my score on appearance probably helped it get a B-. It was not a bad Irish Red, but it certainly has not been my favorite. Worth a try, but I will probably not be revisiting it - time to move on."
"D - Better than some other Irish Reds. A decent brew suited to those with the preference for it's sweetness"
"D: It's quite drinkable, but not my favourite Irish red or Sam Adams."
"Mezza mezza, though with not that many Irish Reds in the market, it stacks up to be pretty good within its style. If it were up to us, we'd pick the Dunkelweizen over this one."
"Drinkability - This is definitely a decent brew in my opinion. It is a nice change but wouldn't want to make this the dominant beer of the evening."
"D: very good as a session beer."
"Drinkability - Its a nice red beer not great and not bad. I would buy again if there was not so many more to taste."
"Sweet malt up front, followed by biscuit and caramel. Fairly lively due to carbonation, sharp finish. Molasses and biscuit in the aftertaste. Slightly underwhelming."
"Drinkability: It's not bad. It's something I could have again from time to time."
"D - Tasty malts, clean hop finish, but lingering sweetness in the aftertaste makes it become a bit unbalanced. I would have another, but probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable ale, not spectacular but then this style usually isn't. Nice drinkable ale."
"That said, since I know of better examples, I will continue to avoid this in samplers and such. I'll buy a Great Lake Conway 6 pack once in a while, but maybe I can save these for guests I don't like."
"Bought this in a variety pack and got two bottles along with two Black Lagers and two Coastal Wheats. Pours a dark reddish amber hue with a fluffy off-white head that leaves plenty 0' lacing behind. Smell is of fruit (cherries, perhaps), caramel malt, and fresh-baked bread. Taste is very full and pulls through with a sweetness up front followed almost immediately by a salty, biscuity flavor. Delightful to say the least. A beer such as this has a lot going for it: alluring appearance, full heady aroma, and a complex taste. Plus the mouthfeel and drinkability are way up there. In conclusion, this is by far the best red ale I've ever had. If you're looking for a good time, pick this one up and enjoy the ride."
"Overall: Sam Adams Irish Red works well as a beer companion to pub grub or even a stew. It's a pleasant and never off-putting red ale."
"Pourd into a Bass pint. Pours a clear red/amber color with a big creamy head that lasts a long time and has great lacing. Malt and caramel aromas. Starts with a sweet caramel taste and finishes with a pleasant slightly sour note. Very mellow and easy drinking. Smooth. I actually said 'wow' after the first sip."
"Beer has a nice clean amber color with a beige head and light carbonation. It has a good beer aroma with traces of caramel. The taste almost has a touch of sweetness offset by a slight bitterness. It has a nice texture and goes down very smooth and easy. A good beer to have when relaxing or to share with fiends."
"This is a very drinkable brew. Easy drinking, easy pleasing. Would have a very broad appeal."
"12 oz. bottle: This one pours a crystal clear, reddish-amber color. There was almost no head at all on mine. No lacing. Milder but nice aroma. A touch of sweet malts along with some earthiness. A good malt body, but no sweetness to it. In fact it finished a bit dry. A bit of earthiness, spiciness and woodiness to the taste. An easy drinker."
"It's got a nice reddish brown appearance, has a nice sweet smell and a great taste. It goes down really smooth. It's Samuel Adams and it's a given that's its going to be amazing, that's my biased for Samuel Adams is my favorite beer company. Them and Weihenstapfener."
"D- This beer is very flavorful for the style. This is definitely a cold-weather beer, and while not my favorite I can see some broad market appeal for those who wish to upgrade their midmarch brew. Not bad overall."
"D - Good. I could see drinking several of these in a sitting. I wouldn't consider this brew to be a session beer, although the ABV implies it, but not poor on any accounts."
"This beer poured a deep red amber with a 1 finger head. The itself was off white and dissipated fairly quickly to practically nothing. There was minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell of the beer is a bit hoppy and fruity. The initial taste of the beer is that of hops malt and fruits. It finished with a wheat taste that lingered. This is a light bodied watery beer. There was some light carbonation visible, as well as a light carbonation in the mouth feel. Can't say that I'm that impressed with this beer, nor can I say that I will buy this brew. Worth a try but nothing special here."
"Full body with slightly too high carbonation."
"The style isn't my favorite, but this beer was more than tolerable."
"D - Not bad, decent flavours and nothing off."
"D- Very good. Very malty, leaves your mouth slightly starchy, but damn good smell and good, solid taste. A real winner from Sam Adams, my new St. Patty's Day beer, for sure."
"Drinkability - This was my first Irish Red and is definitely a style I will try again. Loved the balanced taste and smooth finish. A very easy drinking beer that would go great with food."
"Sam Adams Irish Red poured a dark amber color, wth a good size head. It had a slight carmel smell, that wasnt very strong. The taste was dry, yet sweet at the same time, and there was a pretty strong flavor, it was one of a kind. It was pretty easy to drink, and easy to drink multiples, overall I thought it was a very good beer, worth picking up."
"D - A solid beer. Definitely exceeded my expectations."
"D- Overall, I think Sam Adams did a great job replicating this style with the Irish Red. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, a flavorful and sessionable beer right on time for St. Patrick's Day. Nothing extraordinary but a good quality, full flavored brewski."
"Clear, deep ruby color with a thin, creamy head. Sweet, clean toasted caramel and light earthy/floral hop aroma. Simple caramel malt sweetness, very slightly roasted in the finish. Fruit and earthy hop bitterness, but definitely malt-focused. Medium-bodied and a little drying. Pretty solid, very ""Sam Adams", but probably too boring to warrant a purchase."
"D - I think if there was a bit more in the way of hops, that this beer would be a little more balanced and would rate WAY higher. As it is, this is a very easy beer to drink, and one that could be sessioned. Not bad...just needs a little work. I'm glad to have tried it and may stock some in my fridge in the Summer months."
"Overall: This is a good easy drinking beer with stong malt characteristic. I feel that the roasted notes is just a bit too much, not over powering just more than I would want. Id buy this again."
"This beer is a deep, burnt copper color with a firm white head. Nice looking brew. The aroma is dominated by a caramel, toffee-like smell. There's malt and a cooked-sugar smell, backed by a faint English hop scent. The taste is quite sweet. It's a little malty, but also quite sugary in the sensation. At times, this is over-the-top sweetness, without a firm bitterness for balance. It can be cloying. The beer is full bodied and quite tasty. I'm not sure that I could have a lot at once, but I did enjoy it."
"Overall: An excellent beer. I am amazed that a brewery that produces on such a large scale can craft such an ale. My hat is off to Samuel Adams. I feel like I must revisit this beer soon just to make sure I didn't have a fluke bottle that was better than the rest!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit too thick for the style ( Boulevard's Irish Ale is much better) but drink ability is still very good."
"I was impressed with a macro pulling off a micro taste."
"M & D - Sits pretty heavy in the mouth. All around a pretty solid brew from SA. I honestly can't compare to more micro-made Irish Red, but I think this is a good representation."
"Medium body and effervescence. A solid beer though not a standout."
"A drinkable ale. Not sure I'd want to have a lot of it. I am not much on the style, but this one seems true to it as far as I can tell. It's a lot like a Killians. Personally I'd prefer a little more hop presence."
"Overall, I wasn't expecting much from this, but it turns out I rather enjoyed it. I like this much more than Smithwicks for the record."
"Not a bad beer, could drink a couple of these in a sitting. Nothing I'd probably buy again."
"Poured from a bottle to a goblet. The beer poured an excellent redish brown with rich thick head with lacing that held on for a while. Malty roasted grain aroma. Disappointed with the taste, it has a very pronounced metalic flavor with a bitter coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel was pleasantly robust, but the drinkability will get low points due to the beers bitterness. I am disapointed with this beer, I would pick a Killian's over the Sam Adams Iresh Red."
"D: Definitely something you could enjoy several of in one sitting."
"Drinkability: Very good. a well done, balanced take on an irish red."
"Every Sam Adams seems to taste like SA Lager with one or two small changes and this beer is no exception from that rule. That being said.... this is a very good and extremely drinkable beer. A little bit sweet, and just a little overly malty, but again.. nice beer. Could drink it all day."
"The taste is very true to an Irish Red Ale, definately a 4.5 possibly even a 5! A great beer to celebrate St Pats day, even if you are not Irish. And if you are irish, drink it everyday. The only down point of this brew was the over carbonation, but I have had them not as carbonated."
"As I've come to expect from Sam Adams their Irish Red is a good, solid beer and it adheres to the style. But there's nothing here that's going to blow your socks off."
"Poured from a cellar temp bottle into my NERAX pint glass. It has a dark red color and a good sized head of light brown foam. Minuscule carbonation bubbles are observable rising to the top of the glass. There is some patchy lacing. The aroma has tones of caramel malts and other sweet grains. The flavor is mostly toffee, but I can also detect some bread grain flavor. The is a bit of bitterness in the finish. There is a certain malty strangeness in the aftertaste that I do not like, so I docked it 0.5 points. This is a full-bodied beer and the carbonation is strong, although not overpowering. This is a pretty good Sam Adams beer, I can see myself having a few of them."
"Final word: Makes a red headed step child out of Killian's. Sorry George."
"D-Could be a little bodler, but very good for the style. Will definatley buy again, one of Sam Adams better beers."
"$6.99 for a six pack across the border in Delaware, I can keep myself regularly stocked on a college student budget."
"Mouthfeel is pleasant; drinkability is above average, but not great. Overall this isn't my favorite style, but I certainly don't dislike it. I'm sure this would have been more enjoyable if Irish Reds in general suited my palate more, but such is life. And beer."
"Overall a good beer, something I would definitely buy again and something everyone around me would enjoy"
"D - A very solid Irish Red. the best i've had yet for sure. it's tasty, well rounded (HUGE deal for me), and interesting beer. it's more complex than i originally thought, which is a nice surprise. great job Sam Adams, Bravo!"
"D: another easy drinker from Sam Adams. Can't say that I would seek it out, in fact I prefer the Boston Lager to this version. There is nothing particularly complex or exciting about this beer, but also nothing offensive or bad tasting. All around average"
"D: Pretty nice. Would drink again."
"I would buy again."
"Very good for an Irish Red Ale. Much better than Smithwick's. Not too complex or anything so it's easily drinkable. A little dry."
"Drinkability: quite good. I would gladly drink a few of these."
"D: Very well balanced."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and malty, some hints of caramel. Taste is good, caramel and malts, fairly sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"D - That mineral thing going on in the flavor is a bit off-putting to me. A great red otherwise, the feel is very nice. After one, I'm done though. All combined it's a bit dry to keep drinking consistently. Still good and well-crafted though."
"D- Drinkable. For those who enjoy SA beers and malty beers, this is a good beer. Satisfying, though maybe not outstanding."
"D- Taking me a little while to get through this beer, and not because it is a nice beer to let sit. Wouldn't want more than one of these."
"Drinkability: I'd drink this again, especially since it's year round. Like most Irish Reds, as far as I'm concerned, this is certainly above average, but it doesn't take a lot of risks. That said, it probably wasn't trying or didn't need to."
"This is one of the better Irish/Red Ales that ive had in a long time."
"Tasty and enjoyable if you're looking for malt, but I think the sweetness hurts the drinkability a bit. Probably could only do 2 of these before the sweetness gets to me."
"D - overall, not the SA offering. i'd rate it well below even Killian's. would not invest in a six of this particular brew."
"Drinkability:Not a bad beer, could drink a couple of these in a sitting. Nothing I'd probably buy again."
"Cheers!"
"Nicely balanced very drinkable. Solid beer!!"
"A good beer. I've enjoyed this one and will enjoy the second one in my fridge."
"D: Fairly good. I would maybe have another, but wouldn't buy a sixer again for just myself. Maybe if it was for a party, but then only as a last resort."
"Not bad for an Irish Red. Enjoyable enough, yet nothing really makes this stand out either."
"D: Very drinkable. For an Irish Red this one ranks up there as one of the best in my opinion. Easy to drink and goes down nicely."
"overall a nice irsh ale."
"Notes: As I said, not a real adventurous beer, but a nicely crafted variety of flavors that could appeal to craft and non-craft drinkers, hop heads and malt lovers. No one will be wowed, but its a nice fall baseball evening beer."
"It tastes good. The malt goes from toasty to bitter on the end, and after that it's kind of grassy and sweet. Tasty and full bodied and balanced, a great Irish Red."
"D - This beer was great, I was really not expecting this to be good after listening to the post after this beer won the Longshot competition, but I really liked this one"
"D: These don't last too long in my house and therefore received a perfect score in the drinkability category."
"Beer is pretty thick on the tongue, which is a plus, but that leafy flavor leaves the mouth a little puckered, which isn't appealing to me. A pretty tasty beer, just what I'd expect from Sam Adams."
"This is a very picturesque beer; while it doesn't have an exceptionally large or long-lasting head, it is a striking cranberry red with tints of plum and shades of walnut, contrasted by an airy, marzipan-colored head. The aroma is not so special, but not bad, mostly caramel and honey with some pumpkin pie spice notes and a hop profile of wet leaves. The flavor is round and balanced, mostly toffee malt sweetness with a hint of pound cake, cola, and an unexpected berry fruitiness. Hops provide a firm, leafy spice that bitters the beer nicely. A lingering bittersweet, vaguely herbal finish calls to mind a dry Manhattan. Medium bodied but still dry, this is actually a very good beer that makes for some seriously easy drinkin'."
"D: A nice Irish Red that is very drinkable. Better than most that I have tried, a good change-up beer from the hop-bombs that are out there right now."
"Dark reddish amber beer with less than a finger of head. Slightly lighter in color than the Sam Adams Brown Ale. Fair retention and some decent lace on there. Nose has candi sugar, red licorice, some raisin. Smells decent rich. Tastes like toasted malts, waxy red licorice, brown sugar, some tart fruit quality. Some alcohol presence and waxiness are off-flavors. Decent feel, medium body and soft smooth carbonation. This is okay."
"The beer is fairly light on the stomach, but I find sweet beers to be less than ideal as a session brew. Mixed up with a couple other beers, maybe a porter and a pub ale to change things up, and you've got a good night/day/morning/whatever. Alone, this is probably limited in it's enjoyablility to around 3 at a time. Still, it's extremely enjoyable and I could easily put away a few of these without complaint."
"Drinkability: It goes down smooth and it's not hard to enjoy this beer."
"The mouthfeel is quite good and it is very drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good beer. I prefer several other Sam Adams offerings to this one though."
"D: Nice, crisp, hoppy and malty Irish red beer. Pretty interesting taste. A little too malty overall unfortunately."
"Overall: A bit off of what would be expected from this style; just average. Too much carbonation which takes away from the refreshing nature of the style. Also, overly sweet."
"Taste: Balanced nicely between the sweetness and the slight bitterness. It might have a better taste if it had a little more bitterness to compliment the sweet taste but overall it has a really nice flavor."
"D: Goes down smooth but couldn't drink a lot because it is a little heavy."
"D: Not what I expected (compared to other Irish Reds such as Kilkenny and Smithwick's, anyway), but quite good. Definitely easy to drink a few of these... yet another solid entry from Sam Adams."
"A pretty good Irish Red I must admit. At 5.5%, some people might be caught off guard with the medium body of the beer. Worth a try for sure."
"D: Smooth and easy to drink; not too filling."
"This beer has gotten me interested in the style. For some reason I always thought Irish Reds were hoppier. Now I'm off to try some of the best red's."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I would drink it again, came in a sam adams variety pack thing, pretty good irish red ale"
"M&D - this sweetness also gives it a nice smoothness and quality mouthfeel, one of the better SA beers i have tried"
"SA Irish Red is ok, but it's not a world beater in this style or on its own. Recommended to fans of the style. Otherwise, meh."
"D=extremely drinkable and enjoyable"
"D - This is just as rated good I would have another as this is not bad at all."
"D: This is a nice Irish Red overall. I appreciated the flavor complexities at work here. A very good take on the style."
"Overall a wonderful beer from Sam Adams. I have been very impressed with the Brewmasters Collection."
"D - Easy enough to get down, solid, but not great beer. Would definately drink it if it's around."
"Drinkability - Relatively so, however, it is a bit sweet (granted this is coming after drinking an American wild ale) so as for sessionability, I could have a couple but that would be about it. Overall, pleasantly surprised."
"Drinkability is good enough. I really am not craving another since this isn't my favorite style of beer, but it is enjoyable. I recognize this as a pretty good beer, but not one that I would buy a six pack of. Nice to have in the mix pack. The next one I'm saving for a food pairing as I would see this as pairing well with a pork dish like smoked ham."
"A really nice beer, nice and malty, sweet with just enough hoppiness to provide some balance and dryness. Great Irish red ale."
"Many could be enjoyed and still deliver a fine taste without overdoing it."
"A great Sam Adams Offering! Cheers."
"Drinkability: Nice Irish Red Ale overall. It is not the most exciting style for me, but they did a better job than most."
"I've been trying to branch out more in my beer drinking (being mostly an IPA guy), and I think this brew really turned me on to Irish Reds. It's got a great caramel smell, and goes down really smooth. If it weren't for the sweetness, I could see myself drinking a bunch of these, not that it's overpowering or too heavy. Not a beer that will blow you away by any means, but probably my favorite red because of it's simplicity and drinkability. Would recommend it to someone that's never had this style before, it's a good place to start."
"Overall- a solid Irish Red Ale. Worth getting when your in the mood for the style, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"D - It's a little too sweet for me to drink many of these, but I could have a couple."
"D: I really like this beer. Though at 5.5% it might be a little strong to drink all night, it is certainly enjoyable feels like a solid choice at any time of the year."
"Did I mention i love irish red."
"I tried this brew about a month ago when I first started drinking beers and the hops were way above what I could handle, however I am really glad that I didn't pour this one out because I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor in this brew. I can only imagine that this new appreciation of the brew has come with drinking some other beers that push the limits a bit more thus training my palate and giving me some more tolerance in my tasting. In the end after finishing this brew I am left saying, ""Thanks Jim for yet another well balanced and enjoyable brew."""
"D - Although this might be too sweet for some, this could be a solid session beer. The malty flavors make this a good cold weather brew, but its so easy going down I could drink this any season of the year. A very solid brew from Sam Adams."
"D - Ehhh... not the best from Sam Adams. If you poured this for me without me knowing, id have a hard time seperating this out as an ""Irish Red"""
"I thought this was a solid brew and a fine example of the style."
"I can't get over how bad it was in the glass. What a difference. Well worth the time if tasted in the bottle, release the flavors and aromas when you pour and it tastes like a malty red dog...That's not a good thing."
"Drinkability- A surprisingly well-rounded, tasty beer. I'll definitely come back to this one when i'm in the mood for a good session beer."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Poured a deep amber with a medium, pale head. I smell the amber malt, maybe some earthy hops? Tastes smooth with a little malt sweetness. 5.5% ABV was well hidden but absolutely felt. The hops are earthy, and clean up the malt nicely. Not cloying, very drinkable thanks to a dry finish. Kinda feel like this is just an American amber but with English hops, but what do I know. Its good, would like to try on tap. I'm liking the direction that Sammy is taking."
"Nose has some malt, and the taste is deep bready malt with good sweetness in the middle, dry at the end. Hops are small, easy drinker with a nice heavy mouthfeel. Not on the top of my list, but I'll take this anytime, good beer to have with lunch or dinner."
"There's very little body to this beer. The carbonation is strangely weak and the mouthfeel is watery. Quite a disappointing beer."
"D: Well if the mouthfeel review didn't emphasize it enough this is an enjoyable beer that can be had many times over."
"For an Irish Red though, it does the job nicely. If you're into these ales, go for it."
"Goes down easy as a result of its watery nature, but isn't what I would call an above average drinker."
"This one pours a deep red with a light orange head. Smells of malt. Tastes of rich pungeant malt, a bit of honey with a hint of cranberry, but not enough to throw it off. Carbonation is just right, though the richness of the flavor makes this one to sip rather than drink quickly."
"overall i just dont see much difference in this beer then a lot of other sam adams beers - so i doubt i will buy this one again i would rather drink boston lager which has more hops"
"Overall, a decent beer that was average at best. Not something I plan to seek out again."
"D - Nice and easy on the palate - could be a session brew."
"Mouthfeel is tame and a little low on the carbonation. Flavor is a huge malt bomb. Big tastes of molasses, caramel, ginger bread, toffee and caramel. Finishes very sryupy with a hint of bittersweet on the end. Not bad, but I won't seek this out most likely. Too dang sweet."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like toasted malt, bread and a bit of fruit. It's a mostly sweet smelling aroma. The beer tastes like toasted and bready malt, with a bit of fruit, toffee, butterscotch and caramel. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. This isn't a bad beer at all. It's not something I'd make a point to seek out, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down either. Definitely worth a try."
"D - Wouldn't turn it down at a party, but not seeking it out again."
"It had a sour malt taste to it that I just wasn't enjoying. Perhaps it was simply the batch. Mild fruitiness to it. I'll probably give it another shot some other time."
"Another fine outing by the crew at Sam Adams. I would happily return to this beer again. Red ales typically are not my favorite style, but if more were like this it would surely grow on me. Would pair nicely with a chocolate-raspberry tart. Cheers."
"12oz bottle that's a couple of weeks past the ""best by"" date. Pours a clear red-brown with a medium eggshell head. Decent lacing. Smells of sweet, toastymalt with some metallic notes. Strong caramel malt taste with some earthiness. Sweet overall, with hints of bitterness toward the finish. Medium body. A decent Irish red, just really unremarkable."
"D - There's nothing that bars this from a session brew. It's banana bread hints are not sticky or cloying, so you don't tire of them quickly. The carbonation and 'warm' mouthfeel may slow you down a little, especially on a hot day."
"A clear bright amber color with a medium off-white head that lasted a white.leaving spotty lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt and herbal hops. Flavor is spicy,earthy hops with a dark toasty caramel malt backbone, very strait forward but good,clean mouthfeel,not sticky or watery, a hint of hops in the finish,very sessionable and a pretty darn good brew."
"It pours into a pint glass with an average sized tan head. This beer is reddish-brown colored. It smells malty, but that's about all I can pick up since it's so overwhelming. No hops here. This beer tastes better than the smell, but not by much. It's malty up front followed by a dry, slightly bitter finish. Definitely drink this beer cold, as it gets worse as ti warms. However, the mouthfeel is decent, as the carbonation nice. The beer is a bit watery though. It's a low ABV, but the beer isn't that drinkable due to the overpowering sweetness. Definitely not the best Sam Adams out there."
"Overall - Definitely not disappointed by this one. I would consider a repeat purchase if I'm looking for am easy drinking red, but unfortunately, I only see this one in the mixed 6-packs."
"I picked up mix-n-match at Dahl's and threw a few reds in he mix. One was SA Irish Red. It's a pretty dark amber with a zesty aroma. The taste is a let-down. The malty aspect seems a bit sour, off-tasting. The aftertaste seems watered-down. I ended up dumping the last bit of the bottle. I'm not doing this one again."
"This is certainly no Murphys (my favorite red ale), but as usual Sam Adams offers a solid interpretation that will rarely disappoint."
"Poured into a nonic glass. Paired with a McDouble from McDonalds. Poured a deep amber with a thin, pale head. I smell the amber malt, maybe some earthy hops? I dunno. Tastes smooth and with a little malt sweetness. The hops are earthy, and clean up the malt nicely. Not cloying, very drinkable thanks to a dry finish. Kinda feel like this is just an American amber but with English hops, but what do I know. Its good, would like to try on tap."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is fruity and caramel.Taste is malty,fruity and a hint of caramel.Very light and goes down easy.This is just another good beer from the people at the Boston Beer Company.I would recommend and purchase again!!"
"D- Is pretty spot-on to this style of beer. A really easy-drinker for me."
"95% recommended."
"Pours a dark reddish amber with a moderate head that fades to a ring. Smells slightly buttery and malty and grainy with some slight cherry and peach to the malt. Tastes pretty typical for the style with firm malt, a touch of butter and fruit, and lightly hopped. A bit tight and prickly in the mouth, but also fairly robust for the style. Not bad."
"D= very high. Not a bad beer for the usual lackluster sam adams samplers. I prolly won't seek it out again unless its on sale. Pretty good everyday beer."
"It is a drinkable beer."
"This is a nice example of the style that I wouldn't refuse if offered one, and I probably will give it a try every few months."
"This is an easy drinking beer that pleases. It won't knock you socks off with intense flavors but provides a relaxing smooth experience. This style isn't very bold to begin with by Sam's Irish Red is good when you need to ""reset"" from hop intense or malt intense brews and just let your taste buds relax for the evening."
"The aroma is outstanding!!!"
"This beer smells fantastic, look... if you're going to get this beer, or are planning on picking it up... just take a moment, after purchase of course, and smell the s**t out of this beer. It has floral notes on top of malt that isnt overpowered by the Golding hops... Aside from that, the beer is pretty average. Tastes more like a porter than an Irish red. Nice depth though, and I like how they approached this beer. Too much of this beer's flavor comes from the overpowering amount of darker malts used in this beer. However, it tastes too similar to their honey porter to be much in the way of an Irish Red ale. Its heavy, but drinkable, and it is like velvet going down, but where is my carbonation? This is an ale, not a porter, can someone please let them know that! It is part of the brewmaster collection, and rightfully so... but I really wanted an Irish Red when I bought this beer."
"D: I do not have a lot of exposure to Irish Red Ales, so I am not sure how it compares, but I would try it again."
"This is not one of my favorites from Sam Adams but it is not bad."
"Not offensive, but just not what I am looking for in an Irish Red."
"D - Good session beer. Not spectacular, but a lot of times spectacular becomes tiring when drinking more than more."
"So far this is the best Irish Red that I've ever tried. Very enjoyable, and pretty well balanced."
" Even though it's over 5.50% ABV, this wouldn't make a bad session beer. There's just a bit of grapefruit-like acidity to this that makes it a bit harder to down than it should be but other than that, this was relativly unmemorable. Call me a beer snob, maybe I'm past the days where a Sam Adams beer stood out for me..."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth for a red ale"
"Pretty much on for the style."
"Overall one of the best things to come out of Sam Adams since the seasonals in my oh so very humble opinion."
"D - Nice red ale, very pleasing beer."
"Pours a clear reddish colored body, with a small white colored head that is somewhat lasting. Has a malty, and somewhat fruity aroma, but is very weak. A creamy watery taste, malty, and fruity. Has a somewhat fruity taste. Too watery."
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable and a tasty session beer, didnt blow me away negative or postive a decent choice i will visit again, the wierd after taste or metallic flavor was odd, wasnt terrible but not great"
"A clear red color. Appearance is similar to other reds. The taste is very good. It is slightly dry. The main taste is malty with very little taste of hops. The beer is very smooth, and very light. Very easily you could drink three or four of these. The aroma is slightly complex, it doesn't hit your nose with the malts but it has a pleasant aroma."
"this beer pours a very nice red color with an off white head that just won't quit. even toward the the bottom of the glass there is still a nice ring of lace leaving an enduring testament along the side of my glass. the aroma is lackluster but still appealing with a nice bit of sweet caramel malt and an undertone of hops. the taste follows the route of the nose, not surprisingly, delivering on the malt very nicely, and almost balanced by the hops at the end. the mouthfeel is nice, full body good co2, can't complain."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date notched; brewed with pale and crystal malts, hopped with East Kent Goldings. Pours reddish-copper, crystal-clear, with medium carbonation and a two-inch tan head that leaves some nice lacing. Sweet caramel and grassy malts in the nose, with hops and an herbal quality coming later. Lightly spicy and earthy hops on the palate, with a subtle bitterness, caramel and perhaps chocolate malts, an herbal/tea-like character, a light astringency near the end and some alcohol warmth. High in carbonation, with a crisp and dry body. A fairly balanced and easy to drink ale, but it is too ""warm"" for the style."
"12 ounce bottle taken from my friend Scott's fridge tonight, poured into a pint glass, color is a clear amber with a 3/4 inch soapy white head that leaves some lace at first, weak retention, aroma is sweetness, lots of malt, black pepper, light toffee, and a hint of vanilla, no scents really stood out or were very strong, flavor does not seem to have much of a hop presence except maybe some grassy accents early on, mostly malt that is pretty sweet, maybe some light fruit in there too, light and sweet mouthfeel, can be smooth at times, medium bodied, light carbonation, could not drink much more than a bottle, too sweet and malty overall, needs bitterness to battle it out, probably would skip next time, might be worth trying"
"Taste - The flavor is led by sweet malts and light hops but it finishes crisp but dry. Overall a pretty good experience."
"Overall, you can put these back. A tad bit sweeter than expected, but that is ok -- I dug it. It is important to remember that this one is not a one-trick pony -- lots of changes from first sip to the finish. Decent and worthy of a try."
"D: Nothing overpowering here. Good session beer."
"As a fan of all beers Irish Red, I have been awaiting the arrival of Sam Adams' product, and I was not disappointed. Although the heavy, somewhat yeasty, aftertaste took me by surprize at first, I grew to enjoy it. Without it, I suspect the beer would have been too much like a Smithwick's. It has the color I like, a deep amber with enough head upon pouring to tickle my 'stache! A fine addition to my collection!"
"Conclusion: Simple, to the point, and nicely balanced. Just how I like my Irish Reds."
"This is a beer that has a very simple taste. The bitterness is balanced with a nice malt flavor. It goes down well and has the night amount of body for an Irish Red ale."
"D: This is a great fall beer, and an excellent session beer. A great one when you're kicking back enjoying that late-season weather!"
"Drinkability: one of my favorite Irish Reds. A malty backbone is complimented by a background hoppiness. I've never seen six-packs of this around my area, but would buy more often if I did. Very enjoyable."
"Very nice head and lacing with a pleasing caramel red color. Smell is malt, malt and more malt with a slight hint of hops. Taste has malt sweetness, but not cloying...some hop undertones..just enough dryness for balance. Mouthfeel is a good balance of smoothness with a hint of dryness. Very easy on the drinkability scale. Not a session brew, but a couple go down quite nicely."
"not my style, but decent considering."
"I will buy again."
" D: Very drinkably but i like this style of beer and i also like all sam adams beer that i have had the chance to drink"
"I'll be adding it to my list of Beers served at my Annual St. Patrick's Day Party."
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/4 inch head with slight retention and little to no lacing. Smells slightly of hops and malt. Fits the style. Smooth, crisp, good carbonation. The hops bitterness is noticed first and stays relatively strong throughout. A good malt background is present. It's not too sweet which I like. A good strong malt characteristic and nice bitter note. Overall, a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability: I could see this being a session beer for those that like Irish Reds, but I will not be searching for this. I like Sam Adams, but believe they have better offerings."
"Good flavor, and nice atmosphere. Slightly complex nose, good feel, nice bitterness with a hint of sweet. Very nice overall quaff. Definitely worth buying the brewmaster's pack, or whatever it came in, to try this."
"(3.2/5)"
"This is a very solid beer from a very solid brewery. I think Sam makes good, reliable beers, but nothing that really blows my socks off. (Except Boston Lager, which is my comfort beer). Still, if you're an Irish Red fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one, and since it's a Sam, it's probably widely available."
"Presntation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"Would I Drink Again: I could see myself buying this regularly. I didn't give it a perfect 5, but it was very close. I am very picky choosing my beers to begin with and I just grabbed another good one. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a nice and smooth beer."
"Taste: Very smooth and drinkable. It's malty with the hops in the background. To me this tastes like an English pale ale."
"D: This one is tasty and unlike many other SA offerings, it drinks a little heavier than it actually is. Decent complexity and somewhat robust while remaining quite quaffable."
"A nice American version of a classic beer style."
"Drinkability: Overall a solid beer from Sam Adams, but nothing truly outstanding. A bit too malt-heavy, though."
"Drinkability: Not terrible, but not great either. I think Sam Adams is reputable for brewing a wide selection of beers, none of which are terrible, but none of which really stand out either. This one might be a good introduction for someone whose never had an Irish Red before or someone who's not used to good beer."
"Drinkability is moderate. It's not completely offensive, just missing the mark on most aspects."
"i can feel the alcohol on the middle of my palate. some bubbles towards the back. a touch of bitterness. average drinkability."
"Pretty drinkable. Couldn't have more than two, would want more that two."
"D: Highly drinkable, I would definitely like to have this brew again. I have yet to see it by itself in six pack, this was purchased in a Brewmaster Pack along with the Honey Porter and Black Lager."
"Probably one of the better reds around and would be a great beer to keep on hand."
"D - A nice Irish Red...I had three of these in one night...and I could of kept drinking them"
"Not my favourite style, but a nicely brewed example. Worth trying. I pick up a 6-pack of this from time-to-time, so for the price and availability, it is worth having again."
"I'm curious why this isn't more readily available as I feel it would surely give sales of Smithwick's a run for its money."
"Especially for the style, this one is complex and layered. I'm not head over heels for it but I'd look for it again."
"It has dark brownish red body it has a caramel tan head with a little bit of lace. The lace is tight. It has a roasted malt aroma. The taste is a little most complex than most reds. It has a deep roasted malt and nut like taste with some bitterness. The after taste has a grainy plant like flavor. The mouthfeel is medium and slightly fizzy."
"Some styles just don't work to well with european hops, in my opinion. Sam Adams is a hell of a brewer and they can always been counted on to deliver beers that are worth drinking and at least a little interesting, but this once just ain't all that great."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are spot on. Fixing to open up another with a good book."
"Pours an amber red color with a small dense tan colored head that settled into a light cap. The aroma faint and is of light caramel malt, slightly buttery. The taste is of sweet caramel malt, some honey, and a dry bitter tea like hop. The brew has a moderate body, with semi-soft carbonation, astringent, finishes with a lemony bitterness. A decent Irish Red, though it is a bit hard to review since I am not a real fan of the style. Seems to be true to the style."
"D - True to the style this is made for session drinking. Competitively priced. Could go with this easily if there is no Smithwick's available."
"Overall, a nicely drinkable Irish red. It certainly separates itself from an American Amber with less citrusy hops and more tea like hop characteristics. The caramel is also quite prevalent with a bit of toast."
"Great beer for the price and accessibility! Great beer in general. Short-top but stubborn head. Amber of course. Aroma is big and forward--the caramel and toffee and brown sugar candies. I'm not sure I can distinguish this from a typical scotch ale, though. Tastes exactly like it smells, likewise bears a syrupy mouthfeel. Because the carbonation lasts and so, nicely cleans the palate, you never feel too gooey or heavy. If the label were masked, I would definitely feel--by the overall weightiness of the beer (taste, aroma, feel)--that this were a true microbrew brew, rather than Sam Adams. Not a session beer; needs your attention."
"D - this was a pretty good beer. I haven't had this style before and was pleasantly surprised. One of the better beers I have had from Sam Adams and will revisit this one fore sure."
"D-Quite drinkable. Enjoyable from start to finish, I'll certainly have this one again (especially considering there's another in the fridge!)."
"d: I could take six of these quite nicely over a game of cards. Me proud of that sammy, ain't he sam and mary's boy? Old deacon raised that boy right!"
"A very nice offering and one of the better Irish reds that I have had. I bought a single of this, and now I would not hesitate to pick up a sixer."
"Slainte!"
"D - It took me a few of these to appreciate them. At first it just seemed like a highly drinkable beer with little flavor, but it has been growing on me. This favor is quite complex and pleasant and yet isn't an assault to the taste buds, I could see drinking a few of these in a night. A great deal at $7.50 a six on sale, plan on purchasing again. Perfect fall beer that reminds me of drinking apple cider full of spice and oranges during the holidays."
"Oustanding Irish ale. Deep redish hue is topped off with a long lasting vanilla head with plenty of lacing. The aroma is dominated by caramel, sweet malts and a bit of fragerent hops. The taste is big -mainly caramel, toffey with a smooth finish that dries a bit towards the end. A very nice session brew with a moderate amount of alcohol. One of SA's best seasonal ales."
"D= One of the better red ales with mass appeal, this one was easy to drink and would be a good choice to have with food when you don't want the beer flavors fighting with the food flavors."
"Drinkability: Easily alot more drinkable then alot of other red ales, I can easily sesh a 6 pack of these. Very drinkable without having a boring taste, Boston Beer Company does it again! Good work."
"Drinkability is good. Pitchers of this stuff would be welcome at a session. Good take on a fairly basic style."
"D- Drinks well, but too sweet for the style in my opinion"
"Smells like carmel, pretty strong actually, pours with a very nice head also. Tastes very sweet, not bitter at all, slight hint of that same carmel again. It's as if some one finally managed to make a beer malt. Well, kinda, it's not that creamy but it is extremely easy to drink."
"S & T - Good greeting of hop with undertone of malt. There is a good after taste of hop. Nothing that really excites the palate for desire to drink this beer on regular basis."
"D - When I think of Irish Red, I think of Killian's. I didn't think I would like this as much as I do. Color me surprised - I knew it would be at least competent, but I didn't expect to get into it this much. If I wasn't already full, I could drink a couple."
"It comes out of the bottle an appetizing clear mahogany brown, rather a dark coppery color, with a respectable but not persistent head. Aroma is malty with hints of spice, hops and treacle. Flavor is mouth-filling and has a nice balance of hops and malt; bitterness is minimal and nicely complements the subtle sweetness. There is also a touch of spice. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and tingly. Enjoy."
"Not the best Irish red ale I've had, but it's pretty good."
"This beer pours a beautiful cloudy red color and it has a nice mouth feel. I retried this beer after not liking it so well the first time I tried it. i must have had bad patch the first time because this time the beer is pretty good. Nice and refreshing and very drinkable."
"Very nice beer. I could drink these all night since they go down smooth."
"Overall-a good beer, a superior alternative to Killians."
"I've haven't had too many reds, but I really enjoyed this one."
"I usually don't like reds or Irish reds so was pleasantly surprised by this one. Seems like the little brother to the Scotch Ale, similar flavors but not as much of them. Still pretty good."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Deep burnt umber color with a tan one-finger head. Retention and lacing are average. Sweet aroma, mostly caramel with some honey. Flavor is toasty and grainy with some caramel sweetness and an appreciable earthy metallic hop finish with light bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, finish is mostly clean. A decent and drinkable beer."
"Not a bad American interpretation of the style. A better pick than Murphy's Red or a Smithwick's."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. A very nice looking brew a dark reddish orange color, with an extremely creamy off white head which sticks around. The nose is sweet and slightly smoky malt forward with faint hops. The taste is the weakest component of this beer it is mirrors the nose sweet malts with some smokiness, well balanced, but nothing blows me away. The mouthfeel is creamy and dry. It would make a decent session brew."
"D. This is a good solid Irish red. Good from first sip to last. As usual Sam Adams delivers."
"Tried this beer out of a bottle poured into a glass, nice reddish brown color, good malty smell with light hops. Light tan head that laces lightly down the glass. Earthy hops flavor comes through the sweet caramel of the malt. decent balance of flavors. Light cream feel in the mouth with pronounced carbonation. Somewhat above average on the drinkability scale. Overall a very decent beer. Ciao."
"Usually not one of my favorite styles but this is a pretty good beer I must say. Tried it when it came out last year and was pleasantly surprised. It pours a very nice red color and tastes very malty and has a caramel kick to it. Only was able to try 2 in the mixed pack but I'll have to pick up a sixer of it and try it our again."
"Drinkablity: Good change of pace, well crafted. I would like to see Samuel Adams increase the availability of these brews."
"Overall, I would say this is a middle-of-the-road beer for Sam Adams, but worth drinking if you have not tried it."
"This brew poured a hazy dark copper color. The best by date showed that I still had about a week before this one was past its prime, but there were still some floaters in the glass when I held it up to the light. The smell was delicious - caramel malts, as advertised on the bottle. The first few sips were great - maybe some toasted malts, and there was a balance between the hops and malts, but then it all fell a part for some reason and the last 80% of this beer was just ok. I will have to try a fresher bottle soon."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking glass. I was enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but definitely not great, and much weaker than most Sam Adams beers I've enjoyed. Alcohol level's fine, but it's just not interesting or complex enough to keep my attention for too long. Worth a try, but not something I'd seek out or drink again unless it comes in a mix pack (which it does!)."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this Irish red, although I have not had a lot of Irish reds. This seems like a good representation of the style and I really would recommend it!"
"I glanced at the presentation on the first pour and rushed through the scent to taste it on my first two bottles, but on the third I slowed enough to write this review. Every sip I took I was almost convinced that I've found my favorite beer. I had fallen in love with the mainstream Irish Red (Killian's) and I knew that I'd have to find another Irish Red when I got into actually caring about the beer I was drinking. I know there are others out there, and I'm hoping they can beat this one, but wow this is a great Irish Red."
"Try this Sam for sure it's way better than their Octoberfest."
"Overall, I really enjoyed the simplicity of this brew. I love Samuel Adams line for start up styles. I'm now curious to try more Irish red ales."
"I poured this beer into my Sam Adams Glass (the genetically engineered one). It was a very clear amber/red color with a robust tan colored head. There might even be some light lacing with this brew. The aroma is strong of caramel. There are some roasted nut fragrances noticeable as well - very inviting. The beer is initially big with malt but not overpowering. It ends bitter, roasted and a touch dry. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation is quite noticeable. I think this is an excellent session brew from Sam Adams (but it seems hard to get in my area of the country - only available in sampler packs)."
"A pretty good irish red, but not my favorite. Beats Killians that's for sure."
"It's nothing to write home about, but at least there was some flavor to this beer to keep you going. As for me, I've had enough of this beer already."
"Another strong Sam Adams"
"Drinkability: No thanks. I will not be drinking this one again."
"D: Another solid beer from Sam Adams, after having a lot of mediocre brews lately, I'm beginning to realise just how good the BBC is. Quaffable, tasty ale right here."
"I put off buying this because the few offerings of the style didn't impress me. This is really nice."
"D- Despite the rather odd tastes that I was getting out of this, I would still say that it is beter than average drinkability."
"Drinkability: Not a huge fan. I just couldn't get over the alkaloid bitterness."
"Will avoid in the future."
"Notes: This is a very easy drinking beer with simple pleasing flavor."
"Very pleasant beer, and a good session beer. A 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark cherry color, with a medium tan head and a good amount of lacing. Sweet malty aroma, some caramel too. The taste was more caramel, but the fruitiness was there too. Drying hops finish. Will have it again."
"Pretty typical for the style but the aftertaste kills it."
"This is a very drinkable brew; as a session beer, this would definitely rank high on my list. A very balanced brew, and quite attractive as well."
"I first tracked this brew down as a single on the huge wall of beer at jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH. I'll tell ya I was surprised I could not find this anywhere and it was St. Patrick season. I was impressed then but could not find it in a six pack until just recently at Kroger of all places. This beer is tricky. It is a lot like the infamous mullet hair style from the 80s. This beer is all business in the front and all party in the rear. The hops are heavily front-loaded. It is kinda hard to get used to. After the hops subside you get subtle maltiness and a refreshing finish that is heath-ledger-joker lipsmacking good. Well done Sam Adams."
"Bottle: Poured a deep caramel color ale with a huge light brown color head with some good retention but minimal lacing. Aroma consists of strong caramel malt with some nice touch of toffee. Taste is a mix between some deep rich and somewhat sweet caramel malt notes with some nice touch of toffee which were not expected but well enjoyed. Fuller body then expected with some good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Body is lot more creamy then expected and overall I enjoyed this beer a lot more then I had expected."
"There's layered flavors that just don't seem to work well together. Somethings off with this one. I will not buy again."
"D - I would have it in a bar if offered, but I wouldn't seek it out. Decent offering in general."
"D: I highly recommend and one of the better ones coming out of Boston Beer Company."
"Fairly drinkable, not a bad offering by Sam Adams."
"Overall-I'm a little let down by this offering from Sam Adams, I thought they would nail this style but it appears they missed the mark. Too malty, thick, and an off sweetness that isn't pleasent."
"D- I don't think I would want more than one of these. It's pretty heavy and not in a particularly drinkable way."
"A syrupy mouthfeel, pretty thick like cough syrup but a nice drinkable beer?"
"Notes: Good for the style and a simple,well balanced beer."
"High marks for drinkability here! Great example of an Irish Red. Nothing mindblowing about it, but balanced and tasty."
"Good brew just not big enough for my likings, appreciate the brew none the less."
"Doesn't feel insubstantial in the mouth; reasonable carbonation. Quite smooth and drinkable. Worth the price paid and worth drinking again."
"This beer poured a reddish copper color with a generous three-finger head that lingered for a while. The smell is mostly sweet malt. The taste starts off with a toasty maltiness little bit of hop bite that fades away to some sweet caramel taste. The mouthfeel is reasonably thick without an overbearing amount of carbonation. This is a tasty beer, and although it's a little rich I wouldn't be surprised if I could enjoy more than a couple in a night."
"This pours from the bottle to immediately form a nice head which dissipates rather quickly, but continues to renew itself around the miniscus as the hefty carbonation continues to work its magic. The deep red color is unusual for an Irish-style ale, having an almost burgundy hue. The rich sweet malty aroma is quite lovely, and leads well into the sweet caramel maltiness on the palate. The texture is thick for an Irish red, and coats the tongue to deliver a nice finish of malt with subtle hop bitterness. Overall, a very nice specialty beer, but not as drinkable as the Boston Lager."
"Sam Adams Irish Red poured a very nice dark amber with a nice tan head, and pretty good lacing. Smelled of sweat malt but wasn't very strong. Taste was malty sweet, crisp, refreshing, and a slight hop bite. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkability was nice as well. Overall this was a nice beer, good for the style."
"This is a nice looking beer, it has a light tan head about a finger thick and is very dense, and it completely covers a slightly hazy, red amber body with some medium carbonation. The head thins out and has some good lacing to it. It has a nice hop scent to it, a little floral sweetness and hint of brown sugar, it has a semi-crisp feel and taste on the tip of your tongue, and has a medium-to-light body, you can feel the carbonation in this beer; it is smooth and mildly sweet throughout, there is also a mild bitterness to it, and it has a faint dry finish to it."
"drinkable and sessionable, but again, nothing that stands out for me"
"Pours into my Sam Adams glass a dark reddish brown with a large off-white head. Nice lacing on the surface and side. Aroma is dark caramel with some floral hops. Taste is very toasty with lots of caramel. Not much sweetness. Finishes dry. Plenty of herbal hops with a lingering bitterness. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Fairly drinkable but not something I'd be inclined to drink a lot of. I think this is probably a good example of the style, which admittedly I haven't had a lot of."
"Drinkability- Quite nice."
"Dark red rich appearance with a thick dense head. I can't pick up very much smell on this beer. I detect a faint carmel apple scent. A little bit of a sweet scent. Maybe something's wrong with my nose. I can definitely taste way more than I can smell. It's a sweet carmel and roasted malt flavor. And the texture is great. It creamy like a milk stout. The best Irish Red style beer I've ever had."
"Not my favorite style of beer, but even with a style I don't like, it seems quite a bit was accomplished in making a bold, strong beer."
"I taste brazil nuts and minerals...hops are present but slide in on the backside. Not a bad brew, fairly drinkable, but I dont think I would buy a whole sixer of these."
"Drinkability is decent. This is a pretty big beer for the low price tag."
"Very enjoyable as a session beer and one of my favorite sam seasonals."
"D: Despite the strong malt character the beer isn't heavy. I could drink many of these. I really like this beer. SA gets a lot of flack as of late, and especially for their newer brews but I really dig this particular one. No, it's not great, but it's a really solid brew that is widely available and not overpriced."
"D: Could be sessionable, smooth and pretty good drinkability. I really liked this one, would have been an A if the smell was a little more interesting but I guess that goes with the style. Recommended."
"The mouthfeel is medium. Highly sessionable. Overall, this is one of the better Sam Adams offerings."
"overall, this was a good irish red buti dont think that i will buy it again"
"This is a great balancing act of a beer here. It has a heartiness that really satisfies. Nice creaminess, not watery. This is a solid beer. I loved it."
"Samuel Adams Irish Red is a prototypical Irish red ale that is very, very close to being good beer. Hell, it is good beer, but I can't quite pull the trigger on the next highest flavor score. I will definitely be coming back to this one in the future."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"Poured into a Boston Lager glass a nice crisp light copper with a decent frothy off-white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves great lacing. Aroma was slight caramel malts and a very slight hint of hops. The taste was a nice amount of caramel malt with pine hops lingering in the background and coming through in the finish. The beer is light, smooth and crisp with decent carbonation. I must say this is an enjoyable beer, however, if in the mood for the style, I'd more than likely just go with Harpoon or Murphy's."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a dating notch on the side into a pint glass. It was a nice rich ruby color. There was a lot of suspended yeast in there and a little carb as well. It had a small off-white head that quickly settled into a thin collar. Just a hint of lacing. The smell was heavily sweet malt with caramel overtones. I almost found it to be too sweet - almost distracting - which had me worried about the taste being too sweet. It wasn't. It was a solid Irish Red Ale. It's not my favorite style although I do like to detour here once in awhile to get away from the hop bombs. I'd like to try it on tap but probably won't be buying many sixers of it."
"D - A great beer aside from the growing bitterness in the finish. Reminded me of what I always thought Killian's ""should be"" but the bitterness in the end is a bit much for the style."
"That said, it's a bit darker in color than Killian's or Killarney's but probably right on for Smithwick's. It has a creamy yellowed tan head that indicates we're talking about an all-malt beer (some of the previously mentioned brands utilize adjunct). It has average retention and lacing. The nose is malty, expressing clean, medium-level caramel. Delicate, spicy and floral hops balance it. In the mouth it's medium bodied and creamy. The Samuel Adam's yeast character is present in the flavor. Otherwise it's just very basic and clean: straightforward caramel malts and lightly spicy/gently grassy/moderately floral hops backed by a firm bitterness. Very nice. Very drinkable. Superb balance. For the price I couldn't see passing this up for Smithwick's, and it's much better than Killarney's. Very enjoyable! A nice addition to the Samuel Adams line-up."
"This was a beer which was enjoyable and gave good bang for the buck. It was on sale for under $7 a six pack and came with a nice Sam Adams glass to boot."
" ~ This is another very impressive brew from the folks at Sam Adams. I'm certainly going to have this beer again, and I look forward to it. Anyone liking a good Irish Red will without a doubt be pleased with this brew."
"D - This is a very smooth and easy to drink beer. As with most Sam Adams offerings, it isn't particularly creative or over the top but it is solid and reliable. I'd definitely drink it again."
"Very drinkable with anything and refreshing."
"Pours out darker brown with a light tan head. Has a pretty good smell of low key hops. The smell and taste all remind me of a brown ale. I'd like it to be a little bit more distinct. It's good and easy to drink with or without food but it just doesn't have any unique characteristic to it."
"An intersting version of the style which has aspects of a malty lager with a pinch of ale."
"Pours a nice deep red color with a thick off-white, almost reddish head that is a little lumpy. The head thins but remains around 1/4"" for quite a while. Nice sweet malty aroma with maybe a hint of floral hops. Pleasant caramel malty initial flavor that has a delayed transition to a more earthy malt aftertaste and a lingering mild bitterness. A llittle bit sweet but still nice. Medium bodied and maybe just a little syruppy with active carbonation. Overall, this is a good bet and worth trying."
"D - I could drink this stuff all night long very sessionable great taste worth getting"
"12 oz bottle: A nice caramel malt up front in the aroma with definite grassy hop characteristics intermingled with a sweetness that is pleasing. Pours a clear amber color with a medium long lasting off white head. Taste is got a definite herbal hop characteristic, malt is on the back end. An interesting brew, i am kind of torn with this one. It's nice and interesting but the aftertaste is watery. Overall, I think it's alright, interesting indeed, and rather strange on my palate right now to give it anything but an average rating."
"D - I could drink this beer all weekend long."
"Overall this is an extremely drinkable brew. I could easily session this one all night at home or in the pub. A solid brew all around."
"Overall one of the best ""Irish Ales"" I've tasted. Boston Beer Co.'s hit this one on the head."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with snappy carbonation."
"Very easy to drink and enjoyable, a nice session beer without skimping on the flavor."
"Pours a light brown - red colour .. pours with a medium head, ...has a very interesting and pleasing taste, some caramel and toffee mixed with some nice irish craick (irish for good fun) ... is a good brew that i bet would craick it up on tap... the sole survivor of the six pack break at spec's..."
"Final Thought: Samuel Adams brewed one of their best beers and provides a great Irish Red Ale model to follow, even if they skimp on quantity of ingredients comparably."
"Cheers..."
"Smooth and softly carbonated; excellent drinkability."
"overall, a delicious if not exceptional beer. as I said above without this my choices would have been far worse. Thanks again Sam Adams."
"Overall, this is a malty beer that does not go extreme in any way. Easy to drink."
"All in all not bad, nothing exceptional, but great drinkability!..worth a try..."
"Full and rich mouthfeel, even carbonation. Very satisfying feel. Decent beer, fairly drinkable."
"It's definitely good to try a new one from SA. I have unfortunately not had many others of the style but this certainly made a good impression on me!"
"Not too bad for drinkability. I could see myself sessioning this one once or twice."
"Very interesting take. It's more hoppy than most red's but I prefer that! One thing though is that it isn't a session beer. It's taken me an hour just to get through two. So it isn't something you want to get for a St. Patties party or something like that."
"Pours a nice almost ruby red from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass. 2 finger head..not a lot of lacing. smells about how i thought it would. bit of malt smell some faint hops. maybe a metallic smell in there too. taste is really good! kind of a malty decently bodied ale. with a bit of sweetness to the malt, but in no way really sweet. almost a cherry taste in there. mouthfeel is nice. sits real nice on the tongue. drinkability is good. easy to drink. you know i hate a lot of sam adams beers, and i don't know a lot about irish red ales... but i really like this beer."
"I've never been a fan of ""Irish Red"" lagers, but this one is pretty good. Poured a dark amber/red color, with good head and decent lacing. Smells and tastes malty and with a slight bitter hoppiness at the end. Very smooth and easy to drink but not overly exciting. One of Sam Adams' more mediocre brews from their brewmaster collection. Better than Killians at least!"
"A clear amber color that has a mediocre tan head. Th nose has some caramel and sweet fruit followed by a small amount of hops. The taste is mostly malts but has some bitter hop flavors. A light to medium body has average carbonation. A good brew to wash down a burger."
"D: Pretty easy drinker. A little too sweet for me but overall not a bad beer. I had this on a brewery tour a little over a year ago when they were still ""tweaking"" it and enjoyed it more then when it was much less sweet."
"Bodywise, it starts off close to medium but it thins out a bit just before the swallow and it finishes with a mix of bread and a slight hop bitterness. I really like this one and I find it very easy to drink. Well done BBC! Btw, the best by date notch is November 08! Super fresh!!"
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, very tastey. Wish I had some more, lots of flavor in this one."
"Looks surprisingly perfect. Excellent lacing from a two finger off-white head and a pretty deep amber color. Looks pretty perfect. Nose is toffee malt, deep and mildly spicy dried fruit. No real hop presence. Flavor is fairly similar, although there's a slight graininess in there along with the toffee malt. Slight hint of bitter coffee in the fruit. Feel is medium bodied with good carbonation that works well with the spiciness. Overall, this is quite a tasty beer, highly drinkable."
"Really smooth and a very sessionable brew, which BBC really seems to excel at."
"A quite good red ale, quite refreshing and very drinkable."
"Poured an attracted red color with decent head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma is spicy with hints of caramel sweetness. The flavor is also of caramel and roasted maltiness that is balanced by the hops. The mouthfeel is pleasant. I thought this was a pretty good effort and also highly drinkable."
"Poured to a nice head. Head disapated quicker than other S.A. beers that I have had. Lacing was above normal. Ale was reddish brown. Smelled a little on the sweet side. Also a hint of alcohol and malt. Tasted slightly bitter and sweet at the same time. Perhaps the stronger alcohol content. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was just about right. I would be carefull making these an all nighter. The higher alcohol content was evident. I dont think this ale was as good as some of S.A. products. But it was by no means a bad product."
"All in all, a very smooth & refreshing Irish red, one of the best I've had. Now if only they could make more of this quality on the Isle itself..."
"Sam has trouble brewing a bad beer (except that cherry lambic...ugh). This one is very good as well. Red-tinted amber with a lacy head. Smells of honey, spring and moss. Hearty hoppy bite well balanced by sweet malt. Smooth mouthfeel with a crisp finish and little aftertaste. Very drinkable. I'm not a red fan, but this one is very good."
"Bottle pours a clear copper body with a small beige head that strews some respectable lacing on the glass. Aroma is toasted caramel, red apple skins, and spicy hops. Light medium body is moderately carbonated. Taste mirrors the aroma, with toasted caramel malt and a bittering spicy hop profile. Some earthiness is also noted. Very nice example of the style and pleasantly drinkable."
"I would recommend this beer."
"This beer thinned out a little over time but I could still sit down and have two or three in a session without complaint."
"Overall a flavorful and complex ale."
"Scarlet red body. Thin and slightly bubbly beige head leaves some pretty decent lace along the way. Pretty strong aroma of toasted malts and spicy hops. Flavor brings more of the same. Really decent effort at an Irish Red. Sweet caramel with some light toasted bread notes and a sweet lingering flavor. Hops add just a touch of dryness. Easy going feel on the palate and quite drinkable. Solid."
"D: Definitely sessionable--it's got a medium body and an intriguing flavor that keeps me interested. I wish I could find it in six-packs here, this one was only in a sampler 6 pack with 2 Honey Porters and 2 Black Lagers."
"The thing that really stood out to me about this beer, besides the red color, was the earthy, hoppy aftertaste. I really enjoyed this brew."
"Overall a nice easy drinking possible session beer I wouldn't turn down."
"Flavor is smooth and enjoyable. There are certainly more aggressive scotch ales out there. This one has a milder flavor profile that makes a nice easy drinking session brew."
"D- It goes down very easy and I would have no problem drinking a six pack."
"Overall, a solid beer, good for something different."
"A-Pours a deep amber with about a .75"" head that disipated over 5 min without much lacing. It smells slightly sweet and malty. It has a strong malt taste with slight earthen tones that I would associate with a bock. Very faint earthy taste though with some molassas or caramel. The mouth feel is smooth and crisp. I had this out of our refridgerator and not the beer cellar but still has good taste regardless of temp. It was very drinkable and would go with some roast and potatoes very well. I've had it with meat loaf and it was great. That's what I love about Irish Reds is that they go very well with beef. Very drinkable and I would not mind having a few during a session."
"D-I liked this beer quite a bit over alot of reds that i have had, its light and very easy to drink."
"This was one of the better SA offerings I've had lately, packing a pleasant flavor profile and at only 5%, quite the nice sessionalbility as well."
"I wish I could get this in sixers rather than the brewmaster's mix pack."
"This BBC offering pours a clear medium brown liquid with a sudsy large head. Plenty of thick lacing. Pretty good amount of carbonation as well. Smell is muted and faint. What I do get is malty and sweet. Taste is better. A nice creamy malt front. Roasted nuttiness. Sweet but balanced. A hint of a bittering hop finish. A solid come back. Mouthfeel, despite the malt character, is somewhat refreshing. I found this to be an enjoyable brew, and one that I will look forward to during it's next release."
"D: A good offering and I will definitely return. My only complaint is with a brief funk I picked up in the nose."
"This is one of the stronger Sam Adams offerings I've come across, Longshot winners notwithstanding. It's crisp and clean with a tinge of sass and earth. It's pretty much the definition of a session beer, and it all comes together to wind up tasty and drinkable. It's become one of my wife's favorites, so I won't mind at all having it around."
"Samuel Adams Irish Red pours an amber/red iced tea color with a light tan head that leaves a fair amount of lacing behind while drinking. It puts off a very nice sweet, roasty aroma with a hint of grassy hops in the background. However, the taste really didn't impress me. Not a whole lot going on up front and mainly some astringent bitterness in the back and into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good and medium with a high amount of carbonation. Though not horrible, I was a little disappointed in this beer."
"D = This is not an unpleasant beer, but it really doesn't strike me as any better than average in terms of whether I want to search it out and drink it again."
"Bright red/brown hue with a thin white cloud of a head--soft appearance overall... malty roastedness with a hint of hops--pleasant but not characteristic... medium-bodied palate, fizzy and back-mouthed...thin straight to the throat... the malt/hops balance is easy on the tastebuds, but leaves little on the way--a bit of toasted sweetness, perhaps... not distinguishable (not necessarily a diss) in its characteristics--a peaceful brew, probably pairing well with pizza or pub fare--an average approximation of the style... hate to evoke the wallet in a review, but too much like McSorlley's to be twice the price...."
"Sam Adams Irish Red pours a deep red/ amber with two fingers of white head that fades. The aroma is dark crystal malt and earthy, almost dirty hops. The crystal dominates the flavor with lots of dark fruit. The beer is very malty without being overly sweet. The malt is balanced by a crisp bitterness and loads of earthy slightly floral hops. The finish is dry and smooth but the beer's heaviness detracts from its drinkability."
"This is good. It immediately reminds me of the Thomas Hooker Irish Red Ale. The Sam Adams, however, is drier yet very rich in flavor. There's a dry caramel and toffee flavor similar to the Boston Lager, but it's complimented by spicy and smokey flavors like you'd expect out of a Scotch ale. It may be a little off for the style, btu it's still darned tasty. This is very much an American interpretation of the style. The flavors are big and the yeast doesn't do much, but this is a must-try if you dig red ales."
"This is OK, but I liked the Hooker Irish Red I had last night a lot better."
"Feels thick and a little chewy. Tiny burn on the way down. It's a bit of a choker but nicely balanced. Above average."
"Drinkability: I had two as part of a mixed 12 pack. An ok beer, but I do not find myself wanting anymore than the two that I have had tonight."
"D-Easy drinking but a beer with some depth and character. Quality brew...and fortunately it lacks the ""butterscotch"" notes I am finding more and more in the SA beers in my neck of the woods."
"Served in my SA Sensory Pint glass. Purchase before August 2008 notched on the label. Poured a murky reddish-amber color. Three-quarter inch off-white head dissipated into a thin inconsistent skim of foam. Some watery lacing present during the tasting, but weak adherence. Scent of malt predominates with perhaps a hint of caramel sweetness. Taste similar to nose. Not too much complexity here. Very mellow mouthfeel and somewhat of a smooth buttery sensation; however, the mild carbonation helps keep it a little lively. Nice sessionable brew. Solid representation of the style and easy to quaff"
"This is a very complex and extremely drinkable Irish Red Ale. It may not be ultra-authentic, but it's a solid beer from Sam Adams. They did a good job with this one. Recommended."
"This beer is nothing extraordinary but like all SA beers it does a good job of representing the syle."
"T/M/D-Hopps are pretty apparent in the first sip but one could get used to that. Not too much carbonation. This is a very drinkable brew. This brand has yet too dissappoint"
"The same toffee and sweet caramel malts come through moderately in the taste. The mouthfeel is only a surprisingly moderate to thin. The beer does not have strong flavors but is quite flavorful, smooth and creamy."
"Drinkability- I'm not a huge irish red fan, but this one is unique from the others. I may revisit it again sometime or another."
"This is a nice beer. Has a nice, deep red appearance but I though the smell was sort of funky and mossy. Very smooth malt taste with a nice balance of hop bitterness. While no one thing really stands out, this is a solid, easy drinking beer and definitely one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams."
"Not bad, not particularly outstanding. It was an enjoyable brew, but I don't have a desire to try it again."
"Overall the tannins are a little out of whac and create a little bit of off flavors. I wonder what happened. I expected a little bit more after getting a whiff."
"Sammy glass."
"It's light-medium bodied with a nice easy drinking mouthfeel. It goes down very well and is a very drinkable beer. This is a good ""sit back and watch the game"" beer. I'm glad I decided to try it."
"M/D: Very drinkable since it is light in the mouth because of smell and after flavor I would buy again."
"I bought this in a six pack at a Giant Eagle, thankfully not in a variety pack like someone else had mentioned."
"Really nicely done. Now one of my Sam Adams favorites (along with the Cream Stout and Double Bock). Nicely done."
"Perhaps I'm just not that fond of Red Ales so therefore my rankings are slightly lower than average. The beer pours a very ruby amber with not much head, some lacing on the glass, but pretty much an uncarbonated, sticky feel on the glass. The smell is bready malts, some crisp hop aromas, and some unsweetened, dryish cherry hints. The smell is pretty typical of a red ale. There are lots of caramel malts, some balance between dry and sweet grain, some bread like flavors, but pretty much the dryish unsweetened cherry fruits are pronounced in the background. The mouthfeel and aftertaste are modest, and there is a dryish hoppiness in the finish. Not bad, but I'm just not a big red ale fan."
"Only bad thing is it's only available in a mixed pack at the moment."
"I found this beer to be flavorful yet quite sessionable. Furthermore, I could see it pairing well with a variety of dishes."
"D - Overall pretty good. Not my favorite red, but drinkable. I wouldn't pass up another. Good session beer, if the grapey sweetness doesn't get tiring."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable and refreshing. Overall a pretty good red from Sam Adams."
"D: Went down really well. I look forward to another bottle of it."
"A solid addition to the Sam Adams line, it served well for St. Patricks Day."
"D - easy drinking, enjoyable brew."
"Drinkable, but not something I would go out of my may to seek out."
"good session beer. pick up a sixer and slam it down while watching the ncaa playoffs."
"Drinkability: Very nice stab at a style which often disappoints"
"D - Great great beer. I would love to try this on tap somewhere. I love the brewmaster's packs from Sam Adams. There are always great beers included in the set and I believe they nailed the Irish Red. 100% Should give this a shot when you find it. I am pretty sure you will love it too."
"Poured into a SA glass a semi-clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy tan head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, and lots of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it, thanks Joe."
"Pours a dark red-copper with big dense tan head and tons of creamy lacing. Smell: caramel malts, diacetyl, slight spicy hops. Taste: lots of sweet caramel malts upfront, floral and citric hops, sweet finish with hint of honey. Mouthfeel: very smooth and creamy with a sweet but drying finish. A tasty, extremely drinkable offering from SA."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are solid. It would not be hard to knock back a few of these. Not amazingly creamy, but still pretty smooth. I like that it packs a little punch at 5.5%. If I want to spend an evening or afternoon with these with the intention of feeling good I won't have to drink an entire sixer. I like having this one in the variety pack better than the Boston Ale. A very solid beer."
"D: This is starting to sound like a broken record, but another damn fine craft beer from Sam Adams. Truly a Springtime classic. Get it while you can, preferably with some extras to store."
"A nice, unique interpretation of the style. Good job bringing a hop kick to an otherwise malty drink. Sure beats a run-of-the-mill Irish Red Ale!"
"Kudos."
"An amber bodied beer with a thick head that had a reddish hue to it. The aroma was faint and had a caramel note to it. The taste of caramel malt is the dominant character with a slightly toasted edge and a bit of honey. A touch of hop bitterness to nicely balance things out. The body is on the lighter side, but not thin. Though this is a style I don't usually rave about, I could go for more of these when in the mood."
"D - overall, a tasty brew from Sam Adams that goes down easily and one could easily session. It does not really stand out in any particular way but it is good nevertheless. They need to keep this one around all year and sell it in 6 packs because if they did I would easily buy it to hand out whenever the family comes around."
"Pours (into a sam adams perfect pint) a nice dark red with brown hints and a frothy off-white head. The smell is sweet with a strong dose of the caramel malt. The taste starts very malty and sweet finishing with a calmer malt flavor and a hint of hop at the end. The aftertaste is a nice malty flavor that lingers. The mouthfeel is medium/light with heavy carbonation. The flavors are really powerful here, not looking to balance this one but to punch its best qualities. This is a very easy beer to drink, a quality Irish Red, worth checking out."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay Chalice. Poured a dark amber red with a large hazy head with just a bit of lacing. Aroma is sweet toffee but the taste is burnt, caramelized sugar. Mouthfeel is medium body and lightly caramelized. Drinkability is low because the taste is overwhelmingly burnt. I know this is pretty fresh. I bought it when the sampler pack came out. I have one more in the sampler pack and if it's of the same taste I don't think I will ever be drinking it again."
"A nice Irish red in my opinion. But not something I could drink too many of. Happy St. Patrick's Day!"
"Sam's Irish Red has a nice red-amber color and pours with a strong head that sticks around for about 2 minutes. From the bottle it will nicely fill a pint glass right to the brim. It smells more bitter and tart than it tastes. Its true flavor hits in after a couple seconds. A good Irish red ale. It is medium-light on the carbonation and goes down smooth. Another tasty beer by Sam."
"D: Good example of an Irish Red, definitely worth trying especially if you like malty beers."
"Pours a hazy, dark orange/amber color that is quite red with lots of off-white head that has great sustain. Aroma is light and bready, a little toasty, and slight buttery toffee notes. On the palate, it starts thin, opens to a tangy, buttery malt feel finishing dry with a risidual bitterness. Overall, its a very easy-drinking ale, with just enough interest to keep me coming back. Irish Reds are a pretty tame malt oriented style that is great for the spring. The mouthfeel has moderate carbonation marked by a creamy, slightly buttery feel, very smooth."
"Smell is woody and cedar-like some malt kicking through and clearly these characteristics are very present in the palate. Quite true to style and drinkable. There is maybe a more liberal usage of hops than in many other craft ambers but I think this is a good thing and applaud SA for making a fairly hoppy one like this. Quite drinkable as well."
"T: The taste is very easy and almost light. id say it should be more a 3.7 taste but we cant do that, so i knocked it up. It seems like it should be a bit heavier which is why i decided to knock mouth feel instead. there is no real bitterness. but its pretty good and easy to drink"
"Light tan head disappears quickly, the brew is a clear reddish amber in the glass. Toasted grain dominates the nose and the hops seem somewhat floral, grassy...not in a bad way. This brew is very well balanced. Sweet but not cloying, toasted bready malts are offset nicely with floral hops. This brew first struck me as a tiny bit thin, but the more I drink it I think it's about perfect for a session brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Very crisp. Carbonation is excellent. Very smooth and satisfying. Very, very drinkable. This is a very fine offering from Sam Adams. One I'll no doubt enjoy again."
"Not bad, but I'm noticing the hop profile in the SA varieties are almost all identical, save for the other flavors contributing. Not bad, but A little variety to the hops would be nice."
"Overall it's a very nice drink for the pre-spring. A good transition from the dark winter brews now I'm just about ready for some bocks and then an abrupt change to light summer beers. Great for the Irish day, though I'll probably be switching to a tall Guinness. It might be an Irish Red, but it's an American beer and I'd rather drink the only Irish beer I'll drink on the only day that call for it."
"D: One of the best of the SA Brewmaster series. I would love to see this in 6 packs ... the only place I've seen this one is in the mixed 12 packs."
"Pours an attractive red-brown with very nice cream-colored lacing and a head that sticks around. Would be a five for appearance but for some chill haze. Smells of rich malts (caramel, roasted, toasted a little rum?), earthy ale hops, and a little honey? Appetizing. Tastes again of full malt flavors and English ale hops (Kent Goldings according to the label). A hint of spice? Nice example of the style, in my opinion. Medium to full-bodied, but the hops dry it out nicely. Another solid offering from BBC! I might have to change my bad attitude about Sam Adams -- the Brewmaster's Collection this year has been surprisingly good!"
"i am amazingly impressed by this new beer from SA. it's a great take on the style and should be a staple in every beer drinkers diet at this time of year. definitely recommended!"
"Cheers to SA for this wonderful brew!!"
"I could have a couple of these at a sitting. Not big on the red beers but this was good."
"D - Extremely drinkable can easily put down one after another."
"I thought this beer was delicious. I tend not to love all Sam Adams, but this was an exception. It poured a nice dark gold with a red hue to it. The head was nice, about a finger, but thinned quickly. Lacing was evident as there were some spots around the glass, just no distinctive rings. S: it was rather nice, it was a toasted, malty smell, and fuggle hops with a woody smell. It reminded me of the smell when walking into a brewery... the wart. I actually liked the smell. T:Tasted nice, velvety, carbonated with nice distinct red ale flavor. Very nice, wish I had more."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a deep red/copper color, forming a thick creamy 1 inch tan head. Medium spots of lace dot the glass. The aroma is dominated by strong sweet malts, with a hint of hops. Sweet and simple. The taste is smooth sweet malts, creating a creamy nutty light caramel flavor. Medium smooth mouthfeel. Full flavor and medium alcohol make for a highly drinkable ale. Overall, this is a great session ale. Definitely a new favorite from Sam Adams."
"Very toasty and sweet smelling, caramel malt on the nose. Pours a nice head and doesn't go away that quickly, leaving nice lacing. Tastes toasty as well, with some nice peppery spices and bready malt. Nice English tasting hops on the back with a bit of soury unpleasantness in the aftertaste. This is one of Sam Adam's best beers, however, IMO. It rivals Conway's Irish Ale, which is my favorite Irish Ale. This may be slightly better. Very nice session beer."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew. Might be a little too sweet to be a session beer, but solid nonetheless."
"Drinkable beer though, as one would expect form this brewery."
"It was a good fall back beer after a dissapointing evening. (long story)"
"Definitely one of my favorite reds, i will be sure to buy this again."
"I could drink several of these in an evening and not want for anything else. I see many more of these in my immediate future."
"A good tasting beer....you could drink this all night"
"Irish Reds just don't have a TON of flavor to me. There are drinkable and there's subtleties there but I aside from pilsners - I like bigger flavor in my beer."
"Pours a somewhat clear amber with a fluffy tan head into the SA specialty glass. Retention and lacing are great. Smells of roasted malts, nuts, tea leaves and subtle pine. Taste has some sweetness which is quickly offset by hops and a slight spiciness. Light to medium bodied and fairly smoothing going down. Carbonation is adequate."
"My first Irish Red, so I can't compare with other brands, but this is well-balanced and tasty! Me likes!"
"style. Go try some."
"Truly a session beer, and an awesome one at that. I wish they brewed this year round, as this would be a staple in my fridge. Glad I listened to my fellow B'A's on this one. As this is definately one great beer. Another hit from the boy's at Boston !!!"
"I got this beer in one of the Sam Adams samplers. I had to say that it is one of the better Irish red beers you can find. A very malty taste/smell. It is not overly bitter, and has a subtle sweetness to it.Decent color and head retention. It is a very good session beer."
"I recommend this to someone looking for a tasty, easyily drinkable malty brew. I like it."
"I real treat out of the brewers collection. I am a fan of the sam adams but I thought this still tasted a lot at the end like commercial boston lager. Apperance was a deep red with a nice 1 finger head that was there for most of the beer, Smell was nice and malty with lots of spice. The taste was very pleasant with the spice up front and the ale at the end. The mouthfeel was very creamy. The Drink was good but I would savor it more than drink it to drink."
"Recommended..."
"Serving type bottle. I could only find this in the Brewmaster collection. Hope to find this in a six or twelve pack sometime. Overall a nice beer not the best but by far from the worst I've had."
"-Oelergud"
"A phenominal pour into a standars pint,a clear rich amber with a well formed 1 1/2 finger slight off white head that settled leaving a few broken bits of lace.Pleasant but milder aromas a touch of caramel/butter and a firm toastiness mainly,again light but pleasant flavors softly sweet and malty lingering caramel and fruit with a hint herbal zip in the finish all along the firm toasty grain presence is there.A real quaffer its mild but the flavors are nice a nice change of pace from in your face brews and incredibly drinkable,well done SA."
"Finish is where the hops come back with a gentle bite. Finish is somewhat tart."
"D - Not bad, but not all that great either. Sure looks pretty though. This is too similar to SA Boston Lager, and it's not very much ""to style."" This could use A LOT more hops too."
"Pours a five finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear red/amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor is balanced not malty, dry bitter finish. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"D-this is a straight up session brew,good balance,with a great finish"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Designed as an all-day session brew for the big green holiday? Maybe... all I know is it's dynamic and easy at the same time, showing off the ingredients well and having enough balls to stand up to corned beef and cabbage with extra boiled potatoes. Way more impressive than I'd ever imagined for an unfairly perceived ""boring"" or ordinary style."
"If you want to taste how Killians ought to, grab this one while you can."
"12 ounce bottle bought locally with July 2008 date. Very nice ruby color poured into a Sam Adams glass, smells great and taste the same. A very well balanced beer with excellent taste, this beer moves to the top of my favorites list...would and did buy another. :)"
"I was surprised to see this beer at my local distributor and immediately bought a case. At first glance, I compared it to Killian's Red, but after drinking knew this was indeed more of an Ale, as opposed to the lager taste of Killian's. It has a distinct Ale aftertaste (can't place all of the flavors, amateur taster at best) with a bitter tinge, but is very drinkable and I highly reccomend it. I was told by the distributo it is only available via cases, not on tap."
"12oz bottle purchased from Clarendon Wines in Boston - with a thought to Sam Adams' recent hop giveaway. Consumed in Feb 08 with a July 08 best before date. Pours a rich copper with lots of carbonation. Aroma is all malt with a bit of spice. The taste follows similarly, with a bit of rounded fruitiness in the aftertaste."
"Appearance dark red two finger off white head very creamy. Smell sweet malt with hint of roasted malt and some floral hop aroma as well. Taste sweet malt caramel and a nice balencing act with hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was mediem body mediem carbonation and had a creamy sensation. Drinkability was very good I could have this one by the pint."
"This beer pours a incredibly brilliant, deep, true red. There is a nice thick off-white head with good lacing throughout the beer. The aroma is moderately malty, sweet, caramel-like, a hint of roast. There is also a moderate floral hop aroma, good balance in the nose. The flavor is moderately hoppy, moderately bitter, and has a high caramel maltiness. The mouthfeel is creamy, body medium-full with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp with a nice balance of hop and caramel malt and drinkability is quite high. Overall this is an incredible brew, one of the best balancing acts between hop and malt. This may be the best Sam Adams brew to date."
"Drinkability: A solid Irish Red."
"Pours a cranberry muddy red. A soapy beach nut head builds about 2 fingers thick and dissipates to a nice one finger thick layer atop the beer. The head clings to the side of the glass, leaving sheets of large and small bubble footprints along the side. Smell is earthy, floral, cherry, and green apples. Taste is cranberry, black pepper, celery, whole wheat bread... the cranberry and peppry flavors are a bit overpowering. Mouthfeel is sticky with medium body, and quite carbonated. The let down for me is certainly the taste. I was very excited to drink this after smelling it, but the taste didn't pull through how I would have liked. May be good with herb crusted chicken or... thanksgiving dinner."
"The caramel is more like a sweet, buttery toffee, and the Golding hops are so bland, yet bitter, that I find myself longing for some balancing Fuggle hops. Really not so bad, but this sample is similar to the Boston Lager, except much sweeter. Not a session for me, but I'd hardly turn one down when handed to me. A little bland. More like a weak scotch ale."
"drinkability is great. this is a smooth and mellow irish red, that is neither taxing nor overly sweet, as some tend to get. cheers!"
"D - good Irish Red, definitely a cut above the average; it's a great session beer and defines the style well"
"I will buy this again, maybe even take the place of my current favorite."
"The beer poured with a beautiful red body and a big off-white head. The beer smelled strongly of sweet malts and it got me excited. Unfortunately, the taste did not completely live up to the promise of the rest of the beer. It was decent, but the malt and hop flavors did not meld together in a convincing and fully satisfying way and that keeps this beer from being truly excellent. Overall though, it was a enjoyable drinking experience. I'd get it again sometime."
"Overall impression: Nicely drinkable, plenty of flavor. This is a nice addition to the lineup."
"Another Jess's Market find. Pours a dark red/brown color with a medium head. Smells a bit biscuity, lightly so. Tastes of slightly smoky malt, caramel, slight citrus hint in the background, not expecting that but it's good. Overall it's another satisfying beer from Sam Adams, hopefully it'll be made easier to find than the Double Bock (in these parts)"
"This is definitely one of the better sam adams beers, just as good if not better than their Oktoberfest."
"I am pleased to see that Sam Adams is branching off from the Boston Lager mold. I liked this one."
"Overall very drinkable with any meats or on its own, i'd buy this again."
"D - Very drinkable in my opinion...I had several without even thinking about it..a very good example of the Red style...very enjoyable"
"As I wait until this beer arrives in my area, I wonder if it will take on the classic toasted maltiness with a crisp hop counterpart, or become grainy, artificially caramel and metalic like many other American breweries deliver. Turns out to be the former. The beer opens with a bright ruby color with hints of darkness (brown) with a terrific slight-of-tan head formation / retention and adequate carbonation. Aromas of rich malt, lightly toasted malts, nuts, and an ester that reminds me of timid berries. A fresh (wet-hop) aroma gives a distinct pungent / earthy / herbal, and at times piney character that later transfers directly to flavor. Along with the hops, the malts deliver a steady, medium malty flavor that hinges of fresh bread, yeast, and toast. A well attenuated, crisp cracker-like flavor provides a nice pillow for the piney hops and light esters. Kinda like the ale version of an Oktoberfest, but with increased maltiness. Finishes clean and with a mild, pleasant pine flavor. A very nice beer worthy of the Sam Adams branding."
"D - Another fine seasonal brew from Sam Adams. It is very sessionable."
"Overall, I am impressed with this offer from Sam Adams. I must admit I came in not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised in the result. I love big hoppy beers so this isn't a beer I would fall in love with but the malt character is very intriguing and keeps me reaching for the remaining beers. Very sessionable which is also a plus."
"A nice well-balanced beer with perfect drinkability. Would be nice to session."
"MF & D - This is a very complex beer with a reasonable alcohol content, pushing it high on my drinkability list. The bitterness from the hops is a bit much, resulting in a bit of acidity on the back of the tongue. That aside, this is a very pleasant drinking experience."
"Overall, good, solid beer that does a lot right, but not extra special."
"Drinks pretty easy, the dryness might wear on me after a while. A pretty good Irish red, but give me the scotch ale in six packs now! Cheers to a brewer out there that makes the American Beer scene better every day"
"It has a crisp, almost lager-ish mouthfeel. Highly drinkable. Not much to say about this one; it focuses on malt sweetness and does a solid job of it."
"Bright, clear, amber red appearance with a two finger head that faded fairly quickly. Smelled faintly of barley. Soft but crisp on the tongue with moderate carbonation. Decent malt flavor with a slightly metallic taste. This is a nice session beer, glad there's another red on the market."
"Drink: For a style that has disappointed me so many times in the past, I must say that I am impressed at the depth of character that Samuel Adams has crafted into their version. Not overly malty, and certainly not wimping out on the hops, either. This beer is definitely one that could be sessioned or enjoyed all evening long at a party."
"Pours a deep reddish amber with about a finger and a half of head into a Boston Lager glass. Good head retention and some nice lacing on the glass. A very nice sweet caramel malt presence dominates the aroma along with some grain and a faint touch of citrus and fruit. Taste is more caramel and biscuity malt. Pretty well balanced and a somewhat grainy finish that I could do without. Easy drinker. Pretty good Irish Red in my opinion."
"The appearance is a bright amber-red with a ridiculously thin head that does last throughout the drink. A good malty aroma overall permeates from the drink. The taste is wicked good: sweetness wrapped in flavors of malt and caramel. The carbonation allows it to be pretty refreshing and crisp. While being both malty and light, this drink might still not win over all. But, I highly enjoyed this great drink from Sam Adams."
"Certainly a 'better beer' - but for my personal taste it had too much butter taste and after taste to be a 'great beer'."
"D - This would be a good session beer."
"Pretty tasty little beer, except for the aftertaste. I would probably pick a different Irish red ale if it were available, though."
"That being said, this is pretty good. More hop presence than many, good balance as well. A pretty neutral, everyday, non-intimidating brew. Very quaffable. Would have been cool to see something more extravagant from Sam Adams, but we're not too far removed from the Imperial Pilsner and there is a hop shortage, so I can understand."
"I'm really not much into this style, but SA did brilliant work on this and made it their own. Not over sweet. Nice hop addition to really give the malts a perfect counter balance. It looks, tastes and feels great. I'll be bringing this to my towns St. Patty's Day fest this year for sure. All I can say is 'Wow'!"
"Overall a fantastic brew! I find only one or two of Jim/Sam's brews outright unpleasant, a lot of it as ""solid"" if not my pick, and then a few select to be absolutely outstanding to my palate. This is one of the outstanding in my book. I can't say it edges out Rock Art Red in flavor, but besides for being nearly as stunning (in it's own way) this is way cheaper, easier to get (at the moment), and it knocked me out by exceeded my expectations when I took a single, so I'm paying my dues and stocking it. Cheers to Sam!"
"pours a clear reddish amber color with a beige three finger head with a easy pour with some lace, could have been better. fruity aromas with a hint of caramel. taste is sweet, fruity, malty, caramel, with a slight tea finish. mouthfeel light and carbonation ok. very nice beer."
"Notes: I found this one in this years Samuel Adams brewmaster collection pack only two but it will do. I wish this one would be brewed year round but oh well if it's not. I could definately drink a few of these in a sitting. Cheers."
"D- A very good example of the style. I don't see myself keeping this around, but it is thoroughly enjoyable."
"A decent Red, but nothing too memorable. The distinct spiciness distinguishes this from other Amber Ales."
"Drinkability - already an ideal style for sessioning, this beer is an all-season winner."
"If you just read off those detected flavors, it sounds like a Scotch Ale. But it's not, it's got more of a lager-y drinkability to it, it's uncomplicated and drinks easily. This isn't meant as a harsh critique, and the Irish and Scotch alike will cringe, but it's like diet Scotch Ale. So there."
"Pours a dark oak-like color with little to no head and a small amount of lacing. Aroma is of dark crystal malts hiding beneath the surface. The dark crystal hits again nicely in the taste with a astringent and slightly weak finish. Obviously calcium-treated water which goes well with the crystal malts and the irish feel of the beer. Medium body with peppery carbonation. Pretty tasty- the astringency gets to me a bit but part of it is the water.. sort of like drinking a Killkenny.. only made in Boston."
"Really quite a good Irish Red and one of the few in the style that I'd be happy to have a few of. Ranks with Goose Island's Kilgubben as one of the best of the bunch."
"Mrdium bodied, smooth and easy to drink."
"This poured a clean brown ruby color. The beige head was smooth & creamy. It stuck around for quite awhile. Good amount of lacing. The smell is similar to the boston ale. It is sugary sweet and has notes of caramal and malt. Delicious! Complex, Rich, and sweet. The light hop flavor tastes great with the malty caramel and sugar flavor. This beer is so smooth! It is airy and creamy; somewhat like a boddingtons. There is lots going on here. I could drink this forever in one sitting."
"Very nice pour. It has a ruby red color, rather dark except when held to the light, with a thick, creamy half-inch of head on top, long-lasting. Nose is a bit disappointing. There's some caramel malt with a light floral hop presence. First taste is a lightly caramel malt, together with noble hop flavor. Quite similar to the Stock Ale, if I remember the taste right. Good body for the strength, with a neutral texture."
"Pours a nice deep golden red with a hefty, creamy two-finger head that stuck around for the duration leaving a thick sheen of lacing behind. The nose was pretty much biscuity, bready malts. The taste had a surprising citrusy, fruity sensation on the intake, moving to a cookielike buttery diacetyl presence, finishing with the mildest hoppy twinge and a long, lingering yeasty, bready flavor in the mouth. Mouthfeel was thinnner and weaker than I would have liked. Drinkability is decent -- a somewhat interesting beer that I wouldn't turn down but probably wouldn't select if it was sold on its own in a 6-pack either."
"Verdict: ok. Not too exciting, the signature yeast flavor is present but doesn't have enough supporting character to bring me back."
"A very drinkable beer. Nothing special but a really sessionable brew. I like it and will bury a bunch of these."
"I could drink this beer all day."
"The taste is deceptively complex, with some bitterness in the finish complementing sweet berry and milk chocolate malt; really delicious. Although this is moderately sweet, there is a nice touch of bitter that does not fade from Irish Red. The carbonation is well-balanced. All-around good beer, not spectacular but very good, surprisingly so. I can't say that Irish Red Ale is atop my list of preferred styles, but this is highly drinkable, delicious, and enjoyable. Well done."
"D- Very much so, I would happily have another."
"Pours a bright amber/reddish color with an immense tan head. Great retention as well as lacing. Smell is of sweet caramel malts, pineapple, earthy/spicy, citrusy. Taste is very spicy malty, earthy, fruity, bitter finish and an ever so quaint touch of peat. Medium body, well carbonated, dry finish. Pretty drinkable. This one turned out better than I had expected it to be."
"Pours murky reddish burnt orange with 1.5 finger beige head which dissipates quickly but not entirely and leaves decent lacing all the way down. Smells fresh but that is about all I can gather (my nose is not very good). Taste is very robust and pleasing with malt up front and fruit/hop hint at end. I can take one sip and still taste it several minutes later which I find pleasant. This is a good beer that has a lot going on with lots of flavor. Unfortunately only two in the SA BM 12 pack so would definitely buy on its own if I run across sixer."
"d - not quite what I was expecting. It's nothing too special. It's an easy drink and has a solid flavor and balance that you would expect from a sam adams. The smooth mouthfeel was nice, but other than that nothing really stood out, which could also be a good thing."
"An enjoyable beer. I figure it would be a great beer to introduce newbies. But like many other Sam Adams products, I think it lacks a distinctive punch, and its quality lies only slightly over the median."
"Drinkability: I'd say it's OK. I wouldn't probably buy it by itself on purpose, especially the way Sam Adams is pricing their six packs these days. But as part of a 12-pack brewmasters select collection, it's worthwhile. A nice filler, good for some variety in your fridge or for a party."
"D - This is a hell of a drinkable brew. Nice flavors going on make you want more. ABV is on the higher side of the average for an Irish Red. But not so high that you can't have quite a few of these. Definitely going to move into my rotation of session beers when I'm not looking to satisfy my hop craving, but am not in the mood for a dark beer."
"This beer pours a clear ruby color. The head is large, fluffy, and recedes very slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is lightly malty with a nice touch of earthy hops. The taste is like the aroma. It is very balance, and light without being watery. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice beer. If they keep this beer in the Brewmaster's Collection Sampler I will certainly drink it again. It sure beats the Cranberry Lambic."
"This is my first bottle of this and really enjoyed it. Definately worth a try."
"This beer has a beautiful dark red color and when I poured it into a pilsner glass it had a tan half-inch head. This dissipated after a minute and left some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. I like the smell - there's some hop aroma, and a roasty malt scent. The taste is not quite as good as the look and smell, and leaves an aftertaste that is sticky. I think this would make a good dinner beer, paired with something meaty (and Irish, I suppose). It's not a session beer, at least not for me, but overall not a bad choice."
"I very much enjoyed this ale! More than once I remarked that this is probably my new favorite red. It's the kind of drink that you can take in any time and enjoy it."
"D:Very good drinkability, smooth maltiness and fresh berries combine to make a easy, fruity drinking Irish style red that is enjoyable in multiples."
"Pours a really nice dark red color with a nice thick tan head. The beer has a sweet malty and slightly hoppy aroma. The taste delivers just that. Nice malty base with a hoppy finish with a caramel hint to it. This is a good irish red but it wasn't as hoppy as I would have hoped. Not a bad beer though, a nice take on this type of beer. This beer has a really nice mouthfeel and is a pretty drinkable beer. It has a very smooth feel to it that I really enjoyed."
"A 12 oz bottle poured into my pint glass. This beer pours a clear, deep red color. Slightly tan head is about 2/3 inch thick when poured. fairly quickly settles to a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass with decent lace. Has a nice, rich caramel, and malty aroma. Also some fruit and tart smells here. The taste is slightly roasted malty and sweet upfront with flavors of caramel and tart. Also a bit of a bready/yeast flavor. Rounded out by some hop bitterness. Good malt and hop balance here. I just wish the flavors were a bit stronger overall though. Has a full bodied, crisp, smooth, and frothy mouthfeel with moderate to heavy carbonation. Easy to drink. A good beer for sure, but SA could maybe have done a little better here."
"M + D: Again, could be a little deeper but it drinks well. A decent feeling brew, it's not mind-blowing, but there are times when that is the mood. I'd take another if it were offered, though I might not actively pursue it."
"Poured into a Sam glass and got a two-finger head that quickie dissipated. The body was a nice bronze red. The aroma is rich with caramel and malt, also can detect a flowery almost citrus hint. A roasted caramel malt taste with a bitter after taste. It is lightly carbonated with a decent body. This beer is very drinkable worth buying a six pack"
"The body here is on the full side, but the carbonation is quite low and the beer goes down pretty easily. A bit less sweetness and I'd have a few more. As it is, it'll be a novelty March 17th beer for me that I wouldn't otherwise order again."
"I like it!"
"D- nicely balanced, very smooth and juicy, its dryness at the end help it's D."
"Medium bodied with a smooth, buttery mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. A full, velvety finish with a slightly dry feel. Very well balanced and pleasing. In fact on of the better SA brews Ive had and I dont think there are many I havent."
"The beer pours a nice red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful, malty scent that boasts of sweet caramel malts. It's balanced with a mild noble hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a solid pale and crytal malt flavor. It's semi-sweet in the beginning and dry in the finish. It's incredibly balanced with a nice mild hop taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking and well brewed Irish red. It doesn't sell out in the malt department and finishes with excellent hop character."
"D - Easily drinkable and not a bad example of the style, but it isn't particularly compelling either."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a red/amber with a monster 3 cm off-white head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of sweet malts and a hint of hops. Initial flavor is malty, caramel and bread, and citrus hops at the end to balance it out. Aftertaste is very mild citrus. Nearly no carbonation, light to medium body, no lacing. Drinkable as a nice alternative to a heavy beer, or one with more alcohol, or another SA selection."
"Poured into a pint glass amd received a one-finger head that mostly receeded, but there was some constant frothiness w/ no lacings. Typical reddish-copper body, but more than what I expected w/ a smell. Nostrils picked up a faint smell of citrus and bread, but also a nice smell of flowers and malt. The malts balanced nicely with the hops, creating a springy mouthfeel that is smooth, w/ a minor dry backbite but overall a creamy drink that is nicely flavored. I will definitely pick up a 6er of this and recommend the same to any fan of Irish Red Ales."
"Taste is immediately malty and hoppy at the same time, not really separated into stages. A bit buttery, solid carbonation and a slightly bitter finish."
"At the time I voted for the dunkel but this Red will be in the fridge often."
"It tastes malty but with more bitterness than I expected it to have. The beer then finishes with a nice mild creaminess. Overall I rate this as a great beer. A good addition to the Sam Adams family of beers."
"This was a complete shocker. I expected a throw away item for SA to test out, but I now think this could be Boston Beer's best new item in quite some time. I look forward to being able to buy this in 6-packs."
"Not bad but nothing overly impressive. It's a bit too much like or at least seems like a blend of some of their other beers at times, i.e. there's nothing terribly distinctive about it. That said, it's represents the style fairly well an, along with the Boston Lager, Scotch, Honey Porter, Black Lager and Brown makes for one of the nicer SA mixed packs in some time. Liked it, didn't love it."
"I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed that this brew beat out the Dunkel for being the new Sam Adams brewmaster reserve beer. At the same time, it doesn't seem like you see much of this style around on the market, so so be it. Poured in to my Sam Adams pint glass a pretty copper color, with a medium sized white heading that eventually fades and leaves a ring around the glass. Smell is clean for the most part, with hints of cream and mint here and there. Taste starts off with a nice hop bite, followed by a decent amount of carbonation to back it up. In the middle, things get a bit creamier, then finally it ends on a buttery note. Mouthfeel is medium, and very drinkable....would make a proper session beer. Pretty impressive offering from Sam Adams right here. Reminds me a little bit of Humble Patience from Magic Hat, which was unfortunately retired some time ago."
"I would definatly recommend this beer to anyone. Good full malty flavors but still has a little complexity to it as well."
"a new Sam Adams, found in the brewmasters collection 12 pk. ; pours a hazy reddish-brown color w/ a thin off-white head which dissipates quickly leaving some lacing in my pint glass ; not much smell, some caramelish notes detected ; a crisp, almost astringent taste w/ some caramel and darker fruit undertones, a faint floral hop and diacetyl in there but not really noticeable ; a very dry, light bodied beer, good co2, just a bit too dry for me, the more i drank, the thirstier i got ; not bad at all for the style..."
" Quaffff away!"
"D: A real surprise that they haven't made this a more frequent offering as it would crush most reds out there. Smooth, creamy, and malty sweet without excessive heft -- the mouthfeel alone would make it a really nice session beer."
"Overall a great brew. Sam's site says that Irish Red is brewed all year long, so here's hoping for the sixer to come out soon. Because when it does, I'll be first in line to get it. Good work guys"
"Pours a dark copper translucent body with close to an inch of light tan head that leaves some lacing. Floral earthy hops with fruitiness and maltiness characterize the aroma. Tastes toasty, slightly peaty, with a good dose of citrusy and floral hops to balance it out. Roasty caramel malt dominates the finish. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. A pretty good drinker, this one is. Not my favorite example of the style for sure, but a fairly solid beer nonetheless."
"Pours a dark deep red with a large tan foamy head. A long lasting head with good lacing makes this a nice looking beer. The smell is sweet malt with maybe some hops. The taste is crisp,hoppy,and full of sweet malt. This is better than I thought with more of a hop presence. The m/f is light with the sweet malt and hops mixing very well. This is a pretty good beer,one that Sam should sell all year long."
"Decent if not spectacular. Sessionable as well."
"D: Ok drinkability. The Robitussin-like characteristics took away from the beer a little bit for me, but worth a try."
"Appears a mildly cloudy caramel amber red with a nice full beige head dwindles slow leaves behind even thin lacing with each sip. Aroma tart thin raisin layer with wet tobacco and herbal hop notes. Big malty caramel biscuit base with sweet doughy notes lingering. Flavor is balanced not overly sweet with some discerning tartness flavor starts tight with carbonation as it disipates an even balanced flavor with herbal tobacco leaf character arising. Mouthfeel is medium with even carbonation and a dry finish. Drinkability is solid a steady sipping brew that I could imagine being pretty popular in the six pack format. I'm not sure what the other options were for them to brew in this process, but I would love to see an American or DIPA I guess we'll have to wait a year or two for the Longshot version."
"12 oz brown bottle part of the Sam Adams variety pack. Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. Pours a clear reddish-brown with a thick rocky tan head. The foam is slow to settle leaving a nice ring of lace. Very faint aroma of sweet malt. Taste is of sweet malt with hints of caramel and toffee. Not a bad brew."
"Still, not a bad choice to include in the BMC."
"Pours a great dark copper color with nice head and excellent horizontal lacing. Nice malty scent, a little sour, nothing strong overall. Nice taste, malty with just a little zing. A bit of a sour aftertaste, along with a nice touch of spice. Goes down smoothly. Now that it's a part of the brewmaster's pack, I will be drinking several of these and enjoying them."
"In a market saturated with Red Ales, I don;t see how this one would get too many purchases if it weren't thrown in with a Sam variety pack. I voted B."
"This is an artfully crafted beer, which would be even better on tap than from the bottle, I think. Nicely done."
"Poured a rich red color, with a solid 1.5 inch head just reaching the top of the glass. Settled down after a few minutes, leaving much lacing at the top after a drink or two. Not real set on the nose, but it wasn't terrible or anything like that. Definite malt taste, the caramel flavor shines. You can pick out the hops just a bit, and a little bitterness but it definitely doesn't finish off like a hopped beer ""normally"" would - if there's such a thing, that is. I think this beer would be great in the colder weather, as the drinkability round after round seems low. Of the two at the taste event, I believe this one would be a six pack, and the dunkel would be inside a variety pack."
"Very nice brew although I voted for the Dunkelweizen."
