Flavor is nondescript amber ale with low hopping, a slight toastiness/nuttiness. Slightly sweet finish. Mouthfeel is light and slick. Overall, boring and mass produced but not particularly bad.","EagleTalon","Mar 19, 2015"

Astonishingly little in the way of aroma, maybe a hint of dried dark fruit (raisin) and toffee but largely flat on the nose. Taste was mellow toast, dilute caramel sauce, slight hop bitterness, little of the tea-like smooth bitterness and body of other Irish reds. Watery and thin, lingering sweet finish with a little cardboard. Unobjectionable but insipid.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 12, 2013"

Taste is balanced and outstanding for a macro, with a bit of a hop bite but only in balance with the full malt, taste smooth, sweetish, tea like, and definitely UK style. Better than newcastle for sure, but it has a rather unique taste. It doesn't seem like it would be difficult to imitate and beat this, but I've as of yet had a craft brewery that tried and suceeds in this style. I'd return here, and know it would win at a party.

The color is a maple amber, crystal clear, and with tons of carbonation on the sides and bottom of the glass. It looked more like a root beer, or maybe a food-colored macro. The head only looked pleasant once it had died down to about half a centimeter, and actually left a good deal of lace. The smell was metallic off the bat, although I was able to uncover some hidden honey malts with a touch of hops, after some searching. The taste was a bit watery, although this would probably be the strongest point of the beer. It is unimpressive on the front of the pallate, but it divulges a few malty flavors on the back, released by the carbonation. Mouthfeel is high in carbonation, and watery.

The citrus and faint noble hop aftertaste dominates the flavor with no herbal taste detectable.

The nose was very shy, offering a hint that there is body to the beer. Its even - too even - and mildly sweet, some malt, like the nose its shy.

The aroma was somewhat mild, but a toasty note came through. As for the taste, it again was somewhat mild nice flavors of coffee, toasted nuts and caramel with just a touch of a bitter burnt chocolate. All in all, a very drinkable beer, and a few pints will go down quite easy. That being said, its also isnt one to get overly excited about nice, but not memorable.","apintofknowledge","Dec 20, 2004"

The taste was almost like a beer with cream in it. The mouthfeel was creamy as a result of the taste. It also coated the mouth fairly well and held a nice aftertaste.

It has really taken off in the Albany NY area, can find it on tap at a lot of restaurants and is available for growler fills at both Glenmont and Olivers beverage centers. With this said I got a growler the other day and must say that this is a nice brew. It pours to a nice deep copper color with a fantastic light tan head that has fair retention and good lacing that sticks nicely for about half of the glass. The aroma is of a nice balanced brew, stronger on the malt side with highlights of caramel that seems to go along with the sweet smell. The taste of this brew goes along with the aroma, solid flavor and the sweetness that I sensed in the aroma goes well, definitely not over powering! This is a great session brew, one that I could enjoy for an entire evening.

Weak, lightly toasted malt taste that is pretty enjoyable, dulled chocolate malt notes as it warms. Watery mouthfeel, probably around the same strength of Belhaven or Boddington's.

Small but steady tan head accompanied the beer. The smell seemed a bit weak and watery but I was surrounded by food. The taste was not watery at all though. This beer was much thicker in body and flavor than I had expected. There was a caramel maltiness upfront but it wasn't really sweet. Underneath that was a toasted grain flavor combined with a maple syrup taste. Little earthy hop pricks kept hitting my tongue but a full hoppiness was never relized.

Quite empty in taste and feel, not impressed at all, was hoping for a bit more. Its a smooth and crisp refresher of a beer, but beyond that, yawn.....","tavernjef","Jul 08, 2003"
4.25,26.1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Notes: This might be the benchmark Irish Ale. I hadn’t had this in about 10-12 years, and it’s as good as I remember. I am extatic that this is available at the liquor store 2 blocks from my home. It remains an excellent example of an excellent style. If you see this beer….buy it! It is absolutely the cat’s pyjamas!","lipschitz","May 10, 2003"

3.78,12.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"A well crafted ale. Not what I would consider a bitter, though. Poured into the glass smoothly with a large rushing head that dissipated after a minute or two. Slight rustic gold coloration, a 2 inch head and thin lace that creeps towards the bottom. Ahh, lovely smell. Smooth malt aroma and a spicy/bitter hop kick too wake up your nose. Now the taste. Hmm, sweet at first. Mild bitter aftertaste from the hops. Malt overpowers the taste, though the bitterness does try damn hard. Clean mouthfeel. Drinkable. A little sweet for it's style, but overall a very good, drinkable brew I shall purchase again.","slitherySOB","Mar 02, 2003"
4.1,21.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Out of the 2 traditional Irish ales I drink regularly -- Smithwicks and Killkenny -- the Smithwicks is one that can be had in larger quantities, but the creamy smoothness of Killkenny still calls my name more frequently than here. Having said that, don't shy away from Smithwicks as it too is a very good ale. Make that great ale!!","49degrees","Jan 15, 2003"
4.21,24.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"From Ireland's oldest brewery (1710, but now owned by Guinness) comes an impressive, well-made brew. There are several versions; this one is at 5.0% and exported to Canada. The bottle is embossed with the Arthur Guinness name and the metallic green label is in both English and French. It's a Deep brass/copper in color with excellent clarity and a surprising rocky off-white head that holds exceptionally well and leaves some nice lace. The nose expresses an earthy character with just a light touch of diacetyl - very English in nature! The body is medium, and quite smooth & creamy in the mouth (although the carbonation seems quite standard). The flavor starts gently fruity, then quickly displays some sweetish caramel malt as it warms along with some leafy hop character, and finishes dry with a long lingering soft and nutty caramel note and some residual earthiness. Really nicely balanced with a firm bitterness that supports the malt but never really comes forward. Full flavored, but also very drinkable.","NeroFiddled","Jan 06, 2003"
4.92,46,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"I spent 2 weeks in Ireland, and spent much of that time constantly looking for another pint of this wonderful ale. It's right alongside Guinness in every pub, but can't be found in the UK. I like it better than Bass. Although the Guinness is definitely better in Ireland than in the states, I had a hard time having anything but a Smithwick's. Like Guinness, the Irish version is far superior to the American version. I made the mistake of pronouncing the w in a smokey run-down local pub outside of Cork City the first time I asked for one. That's something you're sure to do only once.","far333","Dec 13, 2002"
2.79,-17.2,4.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Full bodied ale but rather flat tasting and leaves you wanting more. May be an aquired taste as the more I sampled the more appealing it came to me. The colour is exceptional. This brew does have character in that it avoided a negative rating and I don't know how.","Shiloh","Nov 03, 2002"
3.83,13.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"On tap at the Tara Cross here in Ottawa.  Comes with a nice darkish red colour and off-white head.  Smooth taste of malts, but not overly heavy.  Certainly drinkable.  I have to say I prefer the nitro of Kilkenny, but this is certainly a fine beer.","the42ndtourist","Oct 05, 2002"
3.88,15.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I reviewed this beer previously but had this on tap again in Canada this past weekend and it was not what I remembered. I was pleasantly surprised to find; a lovely, rich looking, dark amber ale with a creamy smooth tan head. Not an overly complex aroma though it's a welcoming one, exhitbiting that same inviting malty richness the color suggests. A smooth full mouthfeel is complimented by the well rounded, full malt/grain bill. A spicey hop character pokes through...maybe Challenger?? This is a standout brew in a sea of mediocre red ales. It did a fine job washing down a meal, though I could put down a few of these alone.","John","Aug 06, 2002"
4.23,25.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I loved this beer when I went to Ireland. Great Irish Ale. Impossible to find in the States (they have an agreement with Harp and as long as Harp is here, no Smithwicks!) Smooth and amazing taste. Nice foamy head too.","Jdiddy","Jun 10, 2002"
3.63,7.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"My first experience with Smithwicks was on the planes to and from Shannon.  It's nothing spectacular, but it's better than most Irish Reds.  I haven't seen it around many places in the States, but it's not a beer I'd go in search of anyhow.","mickeymac","Apr 16, 2002"
