"So I love regular new castle but this werewolf was horrible, I had to chase it with other drinks to get it down and struggled to pawn it off. It reminded me of old coffee grounds mixed with old beer and dark hops just horrible."
"This was an interesting beer, and while I would have liked some more flavor, overall I have no major complaints."
"From the bottle in their branded glass. Appearance is a translucent reddish-brown with a hefty head. Slightly fruity smell and starts with a sweet taste eventually going to bitter (which saves it since I don't like sweet brews). Feels medium-light bodied with a bit of hoppy bite. (I usually don't like strong aftertastes but it's not bad here.) Overall pretty good for a seasonal and a nice change from Newcastle Brown which I like alot."
"Very poor beer; not a good effort."
""
""
"This was a nice surprise for me, a little darker than Newcastle brown"
""
"I don't think I've ever had a less enjoyable experience drinking a beer.  The aroma was a tad on the earthy side for me with a distinct hint of dirt.  However, the real fireworks arrived upon the first sip with a powerful initial burst of flavor.  I generally try to be more flowery in my descriptions but the taste of this beer can only be compared to that of saddle sweat.  I would suggest trying it, if only for the novelty of experiencing the worst beer you've ever tasted."
"I try and find something I like about every beer.  This one was hard to do that."
""
""
""
"This was one of worst things or ever put in my mouth. Two drinks was all I could get down before pouring the rest down the sink. Terrible."
""
"Does not stand out above other Newcastles'. Definitely a Halloween beer!"
""
""
"Not something I will get again"
"2.79 | 65 | C"
"Decent session brew, albeit a bit watery."
""
""
"Overall: The solvent aspect takes a lot away from a beer that had potential."
""
""
"Pours a nice red brown color with an off-white head that doesn't last long but leaves nice lacing. Taste is somewhat like a light caramel that hints at something darker and richer, but never shows its face. Disappointing. Smell is typical of most British ales. Has a lighter mouthfeel and is relatively refreshing. Overall this is something I'd drink without complaint but wouldn't go out and buy myself. Cheers!"
"I miss the old beer advocate"
"Very much a British beer style. Very tasty beer and one I would have again."

"Tastes of sweet malt, copper, a little spicy and soapy. Watery on the palate with copper aftertaste."

"Crazy red brown look and decent head. Starts very smooth with a very slight berry taste. Half way though you get a almost tart bite."

"I was not impressed by this rather plain offering.  Nothing really jumped out at me, but nothing offensive.  Just OK.  Will not revisit."
""
""
"nice clean taste of a darker ale can taste a bread and caramel taste in the finish. I was a good beer and I would drink it around my mid beer snob friends and family."

"A bit let down. Some carmel notes, but not much else."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Arom is of a slightly bready malt. Pours a deep amber red with light beige small head. Head disappears rapidly and leaves a tracing of lace. Taste is of dark fruits; date and fig, some mild berriness. Bit of bitey bitterness in the aftertaste. Warming for a chilly evening."
""
""
""
"Smooth fruity notes"
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this beer was somewhat better than I expected it to be. Although there are better options within the style, this beer is worth drinking for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful brown see-through. Aroma is light with sweet malts. Taste is ok with malt prevelance and a little bread. There is a overpowering doughy bread taste as it goes on. Overall, ok balance but seems a touch heavy on the cool sweetness."
"Pours a dark brownish red color with an off-white head with solid retention and lacing. The aroma is sweet malt, plums, raisins, and dark bread. The taste is very sweet up front with a good dose of malts and slightly toasted grain and a lingering sweetness well into the finish. Overall, not a huge fan of this one. The sweetness is overpowering for my taste buds, would have prefered a drier finish to this one."
""
""
"Im sure it's vogue to pan this beer but I found it to be rather flavorful and a decent ""Macro"" brewed Irish Red."

"poured from 12 oz bottle into a snifter, pours typical of an irish red. Little to no head and minute lacing after ten minutes. The aroma is pretty disatisfying consisting of mainly malt and smokiness, though some sugary/buttery aromas come through as it warms. The taste wasn't much better with first mouth feel tasting mainly of malt, with an after taste of crisp bread. Mouth feel was very light, but perfect amount of carbonation. Nothing I'd recommend overall."
""
""
"Had this at a tasting, this is honestly one of the worst beers I've ever had.  Nothing about the flavor or aroma was appealing.  I wish I had notes to refer back to other than a number rating so I could recall what about this specifically was so hideous, but I recall it being very unpleasant."

"Overall (3.88) : Yes, this is a beer I would drink again. It is a beer to be enjoyed and it is not bashful in its flavor. The faint at heart will probably gawk and make faces, but this beer is rich in taste and has a lot going for it. I highly recommend the Werewolf."

"Werewolf Pours a brownish color with a nice foamy head. There is a very weak aroma, some salty peanut notes. The flavor is pronounced, big hazelnut flavors, and a stale malt flavor. The body is a bit watery, but flavors are still there. Overall its a nice beer, nice body, and some good hazelnut flavors."

"Newcastle Werewolf is brown in color with a slight reddish hue to it. I personally didn't notice much of a smell at all and I took some pretty deep whiffs. Upon trying it the first thought that came to mind was this is probably what gutter water taste like. Having had a pitcher the first pint of Werewolf was pretty brutal to get through, but by the second I'd become immune to the taste. Werewolf is slightly carbonated but feels very flat. It really does taste like dirty water."
"Overall: Werewolf is good (not great) and is a decent addition to the rotating seasonal lineup from Newcastle."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is watery. Overall, it's an OK beer."

"O: Overall an odd little beer, a little off. I could see it appealing to a broader audience, but this one just isn't for me."
""
""
""
""
"Yo, thiz iz madd real, yo! As is my wont, I employed an aggro pour, allowing it to flow freely out of the bottle, which in turn began a pseudo-cascade that produced three fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention. I would put the color more as deep-copper (SRM = X), as opposed to ""blood red", but neither am I going to quibble. Clarity was button-bright and I was ready to begin howling in response. Warren Zevon was doing ""Werewolves of London"" on YouTube and so begins the day. The nose had a strawberry/raspberry scent underlain by a bready maltiness. Mmmm. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was quite unexpected, even given the label's verbiage. It had an initial kiddie-candy like flavor that was overtaken fairly quickly by a tangy bitterness. Finish was semi-dry, with the rye giving it a slight bite at the end. This was an easily quaffable beer and disappeared more quickly than I realized."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours reddish brown amber in color with a 1-finger foamy white head and settles down to just around the top and sides of the beer. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of dark roasted malts with a hint of caramel. The taste is about the same with a slight hoppy finish. Some dark fruits were also noted in the taste. A strange taste actually. Perfect carbonation though."

"Worth a shot, but not in the same class as their flagship Brown."
""
"Overall, I don't think I'd ever be tempted to buy this. My brother had gotten some when his band was on tour recently, so that's how I acquired this. But it's way too sweet and overly carbonated to be something I'd be seeking out again. But in general, I'd rather have this than a Bud Light for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: In it's entirety it would be hard to call this a bad beer. The flavors a deep and complex, but it's also very sessionable and easy to drink. The flavors present aren't really my thing, but I know some people who might be into a brew like this. Probably for someone who is just getting into craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"O - Werewolf has tons of rich burnt malt flavor and tons of bitterness, but also some fruity sweetness to keep things interesting. It's a decent brew overall."
""
""
"Color is a perfect amber. Very little head that did disapate quite quickly but is normal for an English ale. Very little aroma but the taste does compensate for that. There is the Carmel malts and some roastyness. A good session beer for the fall as the days shorten."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: I somewhat expected a tacky Halloween beer, especially given the fact that I don't particularly like regular Newcastle. This stuff hits the spot though. The candy flavors, color, and name are a perfect compliment to Halloween."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Picked up a cartloads of this brew as it was on Halloween special price where a twelver was less than a typical sixer. So did my instinct pan out? Let's give a whirl. Popping the top I get a nice zesty roasted malt smell. Pours into a trusty pint to a deep bronze with a two finger foamy head. The taste starts with a nice hop bite the phases into a sweet yet tangy malt base then transitions to a gradually sweeter finish with a broad robust yet zesty bitterness fading in the background. A very tasty brew I will purchase again as well as Newcastles Brown Ale that is also tasty."
"O: love it. it's much like the brown ale from Newcastle but with a definitive twist, I'm assuming from the rye"
""
"Light amber hue with a khaki head forming thick forced carbonation is clearly here. The nose is muted to a dose of cereal grains, toasted caramel and faint herbal hops. Flavors bring out a light fruitiness candied ale sensation, light flavors fruity and easy to drink mild herbal hops in the finish again this may be ground breaking in flavor terms for a BMC drinker but for the core of this Beer Advocate community this is nothing more than a disappointment. Light toasted malts cereal grains hints of herbal hops is the flavor profile I'm getting, the body and carbonation are standard for this type of beer. I will accept this as a seasonal drinkable amber ale from the UK for Halloween other than that it doesn't have a rotation in my dedicated beer fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours to a nice frothy beige head that falls to a permanent thin layer and some lacing. Color is brownish-red (more like dried or cooked blood) . Aroma is fruity, bready with caramel and toffee. Flavor is more of the same with a toasty, biscuity middle and a sharp, dry finish. The bitterness is almost medicinal. Mouthfeel is light, watery and limp. Overall, this is not bad but nothing special. ""Cute"" label and marketing image."
""
"O: This is definitely a seasonal beer. When you drink it, you know what time of year it is and I really like that about this brew. Not sure if I'd enjoy it nearly as much at any other time of year, but that's why it's a seasonal!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an average beer. I enjoy regular Newcastle more, even if it's a brown ale as opposed to this ""red"" one. They're somewhat similar, however. I wouldn't seek this out."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is just an average beer. Not a lot to say about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Brown ale is a solid every day drinker, however, this edition seems a bit over done. The lingering flavor is smoky and overpowers the beer a bit. I do get a little creaminess but no berry fruit."
""
""
""
"Not overly impressed with this one. It's worth a shot for someone looking for more character than a domestic lager."

"A nice example of a traditional red ale. Sweet, but with an earthy undertone, especially in the finish. I would love to try this one on cask!"
""
""
""
"Color is a beautiful reddish amber with brilliant clarity and a tan head of white foam that quickly dissipates. The nose is bready malts, 12 grain bread, breakfast cereal, spicy-almost noble- herbal hop odors. Taste is subdued, soft nutty flavor, slightly muddy, not at all crisp; a charge of bitterness without any forward hop flavor. Very malty but not cleanly so. A drinkable session beer at 4.5% ABV, but muddled and dark tasting. A cleaner and clearer profile would go a long way in taking this from good to great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tastes decidedly like a Newcastle beer (which is something that is fixed in my mind from drinking it during college in the mid-90s). Easy to drink and sessionable but not overly interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is one that I'll gladly be drinking again. It is definitely worth the money. It's not one of those ""Gotta try it beers"" but it is definitely something that is worth getting for your ""I want to drink a good beer"" everyday kind of beers."
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent beer that goes well with a casual social gathering."
"I missed out on Werewolf last year, mostly 'cause I couldn't find any singles. This year is different. Boom. This stuff pours a clear sunrise copper-amber topped by a half-finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises toast, mild toffee, and a layer of dank dark greens pervading the background. The taste brings in more of the same, but this same is relegated to near-obscurity. What replaces it is an all-encompassing melange of extremely hard water and old-ass vegetables. Great. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty slick feel. Overall, this is just a bad mess of a beer, one that makes me wonder what the hell has happened to the Newcastle line."

"Pours a rusty red with an off white lasting frothy head with some lacing. Aroma and Taste of toasted caramel malt and grains, some fruity and grassy notes, a bit of chocolate malt and some mild bitterness. A medium body on the palates, some moderate carbonation and slightly crisp. Finish with some toasted caramel malt, fruity and grassy notes and mild hops bitterness. Aroma and flavor are a bit light. Overall an ok brew."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong with caramel and malts. Taste is mild compared to the smell. Some malts and caramel, a hint of hops are present, kind of light. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm glad I tried this but I don't think I will ever buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- this is an odd one. Probably my least favorite out of newcastle's seasonal line."
""
""
""
"Nothing crazy here. A decent amber/red ale. I might buy some more next year, but it's not one I will highly anticipate."
"O. It's a bit bland, but it is very easy to drink and is very smooth. Just meh, but not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I have had better Irish Red ales but anything is worth trying for a buck."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Off-white head, high retention, suddsy lacing on a deep copper, clear body. Aroma includes caramel malts, slight hop bitterness, slight brown sugar sweetness note. Taste is also caramelly sweet and some hint of vanilla and brown sugar. Nothing off-putting, nothing too radical but a very tasty and easy to drink amber like ale."
""
""
""
"Overall: More of a chip/pretzel chaser than a stand-alone sessioon beer--not disappointing, but not upset by its ""limited release"" packaging either..."
"Taste is slightly winy toasty bread crust, barley, hints of wood, caramelised bread, lightly on the sweet side with light spicy-peppery wood bitterness and a dryish finish. It has a simple quality to it, but it is reasonably well-rounded and quite enjoyable, a good solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I found this to be rather bland and boring, but never bad. Pretty much fits the 'average' definition all around."

"palatable, but it kinda sucks. the pour is nice enough, presenting itself as a dusty amber to copper bodied beer, with more than an inch of huge bubbled airy head. the nose is weak street, extracty malts that dont quite fit the red or the amber ticket, and have a not natural sort of sweetness. the flavor agrees, sweet throughout, with more of an irish malt flavor makign a short appearance in the middle, but with brown and residual weird sugar occupyaing the rest of the taste spectrum. i liked its relaxed feel, but i thought the carbonation wasnt quite forward enough, and the body felt heavy without it, where it might have otherwise been a rounded medium. the packaging was gimmicky, the beer tasted past its prime, and frankly it just didnt taste that good, or like what it purporter to be. not god awful, but you cand find something better on the shelf or in the cooler, trust me."

"The feel is good w/ toasty texture and moderately carbonated with slight tinge of spice with mild earthy dry and moderate bitter finish. The taste is good with some roasted coffee nuttiness and light spice tinges with mild earthy notes and light woody aspect with yeasty flavor and mild tinge of pepper. The overall impression was a nice mix of flavors, but basic red ale with drinkable overall quality"

"-Overall 4.0: Very good beer that is worth a try. Would be a fantastic session beer as the under 5% ABV would allow you to enjoy several without changing into a creature of the night. I think ol' Larry Talbot himself would be proud. Now go howl at the moon... ."
"O: A fair ale. It is mellow and pleasant; it would be easy to drink a six pack. It is a solid beer, but it isn't much more than that."
""
""
"This is a decent beer. Nothing exceptional going on here and nothing done wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this one was different, the flavores just seemed unbalanced to me. Worth trying, but not one I will go back to."
"Had this at a Halloween party and it paired well with the superbly marinated grilled steak and chicken."
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall, the appearance and aroma set up expectations that the taste couldn't back up. A poor substitute to the standard Newcastle Brown Ale."
""
""
"O: This beer seems to follow style, but in a pretty weak way."
""
"Overall, it's a nice beer for a casual/fun party"
"I had heard less than flattering things about this beer, but decided to pick one up in a mixed 6-pack to see for myself. The aroma actually temporarily got my hopes up; it had a lot going on and the rye really added to it. However, this illusion faded after the first swallow. This is not a particularly pleasant beer to drink."
""
""
""
"Newcastle’s brown ale is the beer that made it popular and like the brown ale, this one is very middle of the road overall. It isn’t anything amazing, but most who try it will find it good enough to recommend."
"Overall: A fine malty session ale. Plenty of flavor and easily drinkable. This is the kind of brew you can drink for hours at a pub and not get into too much trouble. Would be a fine companion for a steak and potatoes type meal."
""
""
""
"Overall it was a pleasant ale with enough character to keep it interesting beyond a single serving, but also accessible enough for most anyone accustomed to a fuller flavored ale with a bit of bite. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good session beer: it has some complexity, no annoying off-flavors, decent mouthfeel, limited ABV, and relatively low price. The most interesting and appealing Newcastle beer in my experience."
"O - Overall, for $1.59 a bottle it isn't so bad. No it isn't complex but it is easy to drink and would be a good beer for people who are just now getting into complex beer."
""
"Newcastle Werewolf is a crystal clear amber ale topped with a bubbly, white foam that leaves nice lacing. It smells sweet and syrupy with herbal, root beer-like notes. It smells warm. Light bodied and a bit watery, it leaves the tongue a bit raw. Let's address this poisonous taste. Is that fusel? It tastes like fusel and flatulence. There's a touch of candy sweetness and a touch of juniper bitterness, but it's still pretty much fart water."
""
"Overall: I would buy it again but wouldn't smell it again. It is definitely not a bad brew, to judge a beer by this review is unjust, it more of how you appreciate it's qualities and inqualities. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not overly impressed with this one; I tend to love rye forward beers but this one just didn't come together for me"
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable, novelty Hallowen beer. Nice change from all of the fall spice/pumpkin beers. Average"
""
"Regular Newcastle is alot better. Fun to drink around halloween, and awsome lable. I thought it tasted alittle better kinda warm. Probley something i wouldnt recommend or drink again tel around next halloween"
""
"Thin and watery, waves of caramel, honey and some vanilla. Ehh really not anything much going on here. I'd marinate chicken or pork in this stuff, of course cuz of the sweetness, but as far as drinking more then this one bottle? Not likely...."
"Overall, I like regular Newcastle way better. The flavor profile is decent but the carbonation just throws it off. Not something I will pick up again."
""
"I poured this oddball beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was red for sure and I guess from the slight fruit hit came from whatever those berries are in it. The beer had a bready smell and poured a nice white head. However that did not hang around long. The beer had a bit of a bitter finish. I'm not about this one yet. I have a few more to drink before I really decide."
""
""
""
"O - Interesting though not noteworthy beer. I'm more of a fan of a good ole' Newcastle Brown than this."
""
"This is a decent beer. Maybe best in small quantities. The appearance is very good -- sharp red color with a foamy inch and a half thick head that dissipates to a thin head over a normal amount of time. I can't tell if I like the smell or hate it honestly -- there's almost a nail polish aroma to it -- it's hard to smell the malt through the alcohol. The taste is solid -- a little bitter, malty, a bit of a bite to it, but nothing truly memorable in my opinion. I once tried a 2 oz. sample of it at a Total Wine & Beer and was impressed; 12 oz. though, a little less so."

"Pours a clear burnt orange with a thin creamy tan head. Hardly the ""blood red"" described on the package. Aroma of lightly toasted bread. The flavor starts with a spicy rye bread flavor, followed by some plums, then a hint of citrus fruit. An earthy, nutty finish. Clean bitterness to round things out. Mouthfeel is good, low carbonation. Overall quite a bit better than I expected, though the description on the bottle of the appearance was quite a bit off ;-)"

"I don't love it, but it's a nice diversion."

""
""
"Seems to be a light washed out Chimay tasting drink, I really don't think I could drink a lot of these, well unless your buying."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not a bad beer, but the brewers went a direction that I don't love. That said, it's a very drinkable beer. It appears I rated this beer high above the average; I think that has to do with rating to style. For the style it is not bad; for my own palate, I don't love it."
""
"Newcastle Werewolf pours a brown-red color with a finger of head. Wet grain and earthy malts come through on the nose, with a touch of fruitiness. The taste is pretty good, it's got some fruitiness until the rye starts to cut through. The finish brings back the fruity flavor with a touch of the rye and some grain. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and drying, and the drinkability is good. Overall, this is pretty much the definition of good. There's nothing wrong with this beer, it tastes good, but there's absolutely no wow aspect here."
""
""
"Deep amber/light brown body with a fizzy off-white head. I hate when a beer has a soda pop fizz. Too much carbonation. The nose holds loads of crusty malt (kind of reminds of the crusty bread malt from Ta Henket). Definitely a more roasty Newcastle Brown. Roasted and toasted malt dominate, almost making it dry. Theres even more dry crusty bread through the finish. I like how its different from the malt, but they just dont pull it off."
""
"It wants to be bold and flavorful, but it just doesn't happen. But it doesn't taste bad, just not great."
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a brownish red color with a cream colored head on top. The head settles and doesn't leave a lacing or much retention behind. The smell of the beer is malty with some grainy aromas. Not much in the way of hops in here. Earthy is one way to describe the smell. The taste had a light roasted note with some caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel of this beer is smooth, moderately carbonated and drinkable. Overall it's not a terrible beer but not te best either."

"O: Not impressed. Really boring. This creature bit me, in a bad way. A drain pour."
"O-Very drinkable beer but not what I would call a red ale. I feel pretty similar about this as I do normal newcastle, if its there I will drink it but its not what I would seek out"
""
"O: A mediocre beer. Avoid."

"Final Thoughts: For the style, Werewolf beats Killian's in my book. Newcastle has definitely put some work into this brew. Having said that, I don't think this is a beer worth seeking out or getting overly excited about. It's just an interesting seasonal release that pairs well with a cool autumn night."
"O) Not bad, but not a Fall seasonal that I would seek out again."
"Overall, I like this one, because I do love Irish Reds. It's got some metallic carbonation in here that reminds me that it's not from a tiny craft brewer, but that's fine. Enjoyable red ale for me."
""
"Overall: its different from the standard, mostly sweeter. wouldnt rush out to buy this one though."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear dark copper with a finger length light beige head that dissipates at a moderate pace. There are some tiny bubbles visible in the beer. The beer smells slightly bready and sweet from the malt with some grain husk type aroma I would expect from a cheaper beer. The beer does taste grainy with some sweetness from the malt. There are some hops on the back end, but not much. It's also a little watery. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth, but is not quite clean on the finish. The drinkability is solid. This is a good beer."

"Overall – A very nice affordable and good session brown ale. It had a good flavor as well being rather refreshing."
"O: Not much to look at, nothing interesting in the smell or taste, and watered down. Not a fan."
"not bad. not good. but not bad"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not to bad, lots of malts and a little rye kick. Low alcohol makes this easy to enjoy a few. Worth a drink in the fall."
""
""
"O - over all this is a seasonal beer that i personaly am glad to have tried. If it never went away it wouldnt be as good so get while you can this fall."

"What was the point? It's not tasty enough."
"O - Not a bad red ale; has an easy drinkability with nice flavor."
"A very solid and enjoyable brew from Newcastle, and probably my favorite of their expanding lineup."
""
""
"- O: Curious color and hoppiness. Better than the average beer, and more interesting than Killian's."
""
"Picked up two 12oz bottles just because sometimes it's nice to fill up my Imperial pint with something from across the Atlantic. There is a serious dearth of British beers here. Pours copper red, thin khaki head. Lightly toasted with a metallic caramel note. Minimal herbal hop flavor. Dry and clean, lacks the supporting fruity yeast notes of better British beers. Eh, it's okay. More reasonably priced English beers, please!"
""
"O - This seems like it might be best categorized as an English Mild. It is a very drinkable beer with some nice flavor. I'll try it again for a change of pace. This would really excel if you are having a good afternoon session at the pub."

"The taste begins with a weak caramel malt note and then it becomes peanut butter again with a low to moderate bitterness capping it off."
""
"Pours a clear, amber color. 3/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, and hint of tartness. Barely fits the category of an Irish Red Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hops, hint of rice, hint of liquor, hint of tartness, and a hint of sugar. Overall, off-putting aroma and body, but decent feel and blend."
""

"Edit, July 24 2013: 2013 vintage is bottled 5-31-13, much less spritzy than 2012. Flavor profile is similar but with more chocolate in the finish. Subtle roasted hints."
"At the end of the day, I found this to be a pretty tasty beer. I think I would have enjoyed a bit stronger of a taste..maybe more hops, or maybe just have one of the flavor profiles be more pronounced. But overall, a good beer. It won't be at the top of any of my lists, but I can see buying another six of this somewhere down the line."
"Light on flavor. Malty, slight toasted caramel, fruity, grassy, just a dash of earthy. Medium-bodied. Clean-dry finish."
""
""
""
"Taste is like a very mild rye ipa. Malty, medium hops profile, semi dry to dry in the end. Complex enough flavor and the dryness keeps you coming back. Becomes somewhat astringent. A good beer. Better than expected. Impressive."

"O- Meh ... after the Guinness Black Lager and this, I'm wondering what all the English complain about American beer for."
""
""
""

""
"Overall - On second go around, this is a decent release, especially from Newcastle. Drinks close to a brown, and is significantly better than the more popular Newcastle offering."
""
"O: I've always been partial to Newcastle products and some of the other mainstream U.K. brews, so I don't find Newcastle Werewolf to be disappointing. For what it is, it is a good, solid ale that would be perfect with a basic dinner of roasted meats and vegetables. Classifying this as an Irish red ale, though, is a bit misleading in my opinion. This ale doesn't have enough of a caramel malt sweetness to be an authentic Irish red, and so, it is likely best to view this ale as a bitter. Reviewed as an Irish red ale, Werewolf is lacking, but taken as a bottled bitter, it is a pretty good effort for a mainstream commercial brewer."

"Werewolf pours reddish amber, with an inch of off-white head that provides for some lacing. Muted tones of toast, rye, nuts and some earthiness are present in the nose. The flavors follow the nose, with the addition of berries and some vinous (sherry?) hints, as well as some earthy hop bitterness. Lower levels of carbonation are met with a medium-light body in this ""Blood Red"" ale."
""
""

""
""
"O: It's drinkable but not one I'll reach for again."
""
""
""
"An easy drinker for sure, it needs a bit more hops to make this style one that I would gravitate towards. Per style description this to me is a B brew."
"O: I like it, especially for the price. Nothing that's going to knock your socks off, but a solid beer, and a damn sight preferable to Newcastle Brown."

"Picked up a six at Total Wine in Columbia, SC. Pours a clear coppery color with some ruby highlights. Thick rocky head with a good amount of lacing. The aroma is classic English, malty, caramel,with just a faint aroma of English hops. This beer kinda reminded me of the old Bass before InBev moved the brewing location and ruined it. Well balanced with a fruity slightly malty flavour with a little twang in the finish.I would definitely buy it again. Aaahoo!"
""

"I actually liked this beer quite a bit more than my score may show. I enjoy the experience of different kinds of beer and Newcastle is a decent beer. Their Newcastle didn't disappoint me, but didn't knock my socks off either. The best thing about this beer was probably its appearance to me. I would recommend the beer to try out to others though if your looking for something new."

"Oooooh, this be a bitter red ale, folks. It reminds me of Old Speckled Hen...and for those of you who enjoy the bitterness, more power to you. I brought this on tap at work for the Fall season. The name sold it as did the fact it was a child of the Newcastle Family. But not all Nukes are created equal. Through the ""Bartending Grapevine"" I have heard this most recent batch did not sell as well as the last. All heresay, sure, but unless my Beer Geeks beg me to bring it back at our pub, I'm not doin' it."
""
"O= I rather have a regular Newcastle. Not very drinkable. My Wife seemed to enjoy it so I would only buy again if she requested it. No wonder my friend gave it to me as a parting gift When I left his house."
"Average, I suppose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: if not for the difference in color, i could hardly tell this apart from regular newkie brown."
"Decent, not a letdown, but by no means extraordinary. Little to say overall."
"O= What the hell is going on here. Did they accidentally bottle booze or is this beer. This is the worst tasting beer I've had in a long long time."
"Would be a nice session beer, would like to try it on cask or on tap sometime. A big improvement over the more well known Newcastle."
"Picked up a 12-pack of bottles at a local bottle shop, and poured into a tumbler pint. The beer pours a ruby highlighted, copper coloring that is bright and vibrant, with a slow bubbling of carbonation. The head starts out pretty massive, as the beer pours with a ton of foam. An early three inches of foaming, frothy, off-white colored head eventually settles out into a dense, thin film. Good cling along the glass as the beer goes down. Supersweet nose of malt, nut, and plum/raisin. The beer has a smooth, rich flavor profile that comes through initially with hazelnut sweetness and a slight roasted coffee bitter to blend. Dark fruit highlights throughout the brew's flavors, with a wine-like character, as well. The aftertaste is mostly the wine and dark fruit characteristics from the end of the taste spectrum, and the finish is slow to clear, but clears completely. Interesting brew, and not too shabby. I'm not crazy about it, but it's something I would drink again."
"Clear coppery colour with a thin whitish cap, good head retention with a lot of streak lacing. The aroma was your basic English character, malty, caramel, earthy hops. Bitterness was balanced, fruity and malty flavour, slightly nutty and a bit buttery. Medium to light bodied with lowish carbonation, decent texture. Pretty easy drinking and worth a try."
"O: Strange brew, not a bad brew just a wild mix of things going on.. Not like most English Brown Ales I've had... Give it a shot, worth looking into for the different mix."
"I must admit I was very disappointed in this beer. I bought a 12 pack and I am stuck with the other 11 bottles. This is the first time Newcastle has disappointed me. The beer pours a dark amber color, has a hint of porter aroma and the taste is of a barreled porter, but not a good one. The beer has minimal foam and lace, and while it is not the worst beer in the world, I will not be buying any more."
"I bought it for the novelty of being ""werewolf"" and would bye it again for the novelty not so much personal consumption."
"This beer pours a clear amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into thin lacing. The aroma is of caramel and toffee, but is quite faint. The taste is similar to the aroma, but a little less faint. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer. However, it is on the weaker side for the style, and lacks any sort of complexity."
"O: Decent beer. When compared to Newcaste Brown Ale, it does not measure up. Glad I only bought a single. Would recommend it to try at least once."
"O: Average beer that simply does not stack up to Newcastle Brown Ale in my opinion. Bought a sixer. Will finish them, but will not seek out again."
"Conclusion: This was better than I expected, and way better than the usual mass produced ""fall beers"" that clutter shelves this time of year."
"Overall: A decent beer, but not as good as the brown ale. A fun concept, but doesn't live up to the promises on the label."
"D: Despite it's lack of flavor and aroma, this beer is quite drinkable, though, I expected a lot more from an English Brown Ale."
"Pours a clear mahogany body with three fingers of rich and frumpy foam with excellent lacing properties. Aromas are toasty but subdued and simplistic. Flavors are sweet up front before big toasty and earthy notes dominate the middle. A tea and toffee like bitterness linger long on the finish. Very tasty."
"O - This isn't a beer that I'll be buying again good for a tick but bad in the flavor department I think this stuff is worse than the original save your money and get something else"
"All in all? Meh. I was expecting a lot more, but it could have been a lot less."
"77."
"Overall this beer was just a waste of time for the brewers and the drinkers IMO. No need to try this."
"Overall: Well, I wasn't expecting much at all, merely hoping for something drinkable, like the bland standard-issue Newcastle, but this is actually quite unpleasant. I didn't even finish it!"
"Does not compare on any level to my favorite Brown Ale by Legend Brewing of Richmond VA."
"This is soo much better than regular Newcastle. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not sure I'd go back for more."
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a 2 inch puffy light tan head that settles to a small cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of a dark bread that is baked with berries in the dough. Taste is of malt, slight berries, and a bitter hop flavor on the finish. The bitterness is fleeting on the tongue. A lower level of carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel and a slight crispness. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale from the Newcastle brand. I had never seen this one before so I picked up a single to try but I wouldn't get this one again."
"Overall – very good brew, with an interesting taste and easily acceptable/approachable quality."
"I'm on the fence about this one. Listed as an english brown, but this is clearly more of a rye brew. Dried out, spicy grain, bitter snap. But then they sugared it a bit. Just enough to affect it negatively. What's good works, what doesn't is a huge distraction."
"O: The nose started off okay, but once the butter crept in, it was all over."
"Overall, this is OK. It's certainly better than the Newcastle Summer Beer, but that's not saying a whole lot..."
"O: Definitely not a fan of this one. Not that the original is a great beer, but I would take that over this anyday."
"Overall a decent offering. Solid, but unspectacular brown ale. The label is a bit misleading with its claims of a blood red ale, but oh well."
"Was excited to see this one.. but again Newcastle has let me down again... On the bottle it says ""Blood red ale"".. it pours a reddish-brown color.. smells a little funky... way too carbonated for my liking. This beer is a step up from their summer ale which was just gross. I wish I could find 6 packs of this.. all they had was a 12.. so I have 11 of these boring beers taking up room in my beer fridge."
"Pours to a faint rust color, but not the deep red promised --- has about quarter inch head. Malts and berries in the nose. Definately pickup the berries in the taste --- slightly bitter and sour in the aftertaste. Overall a decent beer and easy to drink --- works well in Sacramento where the fall is mostly 90+ degrees."
"Overall a light refreshing brew, good if you want to have more than a few but nothing overly special."
"Overall: Boring taste and too much carbonation, dont think I need to say anymore"
"Pours a brownish red with a beige head. The front taste of this beer is a well balance of malts. The ending taste highlights the bitterness described on its label. Bitterness is not too overwhelming and appears balanced enough to enjoy several bottles of this brew. The mouthfeel is of a dry feel with a hoppy aftertaste."
"I don't regret trying it but this isn't something that will be part of my regular rotation in the fall, not with a the fests and pumpkins that will be available."
"Overall: Not a bad brew. Great for those crisp falls. I wish it hadn't released so early(July) and wished we would see it here in New Orleans but I don't think we will."
"The fall seasonals are coming out way to early in my opinion."
"O - a good, low risk ale. The taste from the bottled version is good. I am certain that a draught version would be even better."
"Enjoyed this one. It's a bit of a nostalgia trip that takes me back to a time when Newcastle tasted (to me) like a top-notch beer. I would welcome this every fall (it's a fall beer I'm drinking in late summer) or even year-round, and would be happy to buy a sixer."
"All in all, one of the best beers I've had this summer."
"Overall this is a nicely drinkable ale. One thing I would change is back the carbonation level down a notch."
