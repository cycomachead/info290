"Poured from a 12 oz. can. And yes, you guessed it. That can reached my hand by way of the legendary woodychandler. Has a pretty deep amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is malty, caramel. Taste is also malty, hops are present, caramel, very refreshing and smooth. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a very easy drinking beer that I could consume all night."

"O-Great Irish red!! Has a good hop flavor and outstanding mix of malt, hops, and grain."
"O: Bought in Asheville, NC, drank in Kansas City, MO, Aug 8th, 2014."

"D: This was a decent Irish red ale. Nothing exciting, but very traditional scent and taste and body. It had a clean and mellow finish, so it was really easy to drink. Not bad to try once, but I prefer something more interesting."

"O - refreshing enough, but I did not dig the foam geyser."

"This a simple yet tasty beer. The smell was a bit off but didn't detract from the overall beer too much."

"I put this baby in gear with a squirting Crack and employed an inverted Glug, producing a massive three fingers of dense, light-tan head with excellent retention. Color was, indeed, a deep brick red (SRM = 15, hey, who am I to argue, plus it works as a calibrator) with NE-quality clarity. The Cascade hops were prevalent on the nose and allow me to plug ""Hops"" by Stan Hieronymous, printed by the Brewers Association. It is a brilliantly written tome and VERY helpful for this non-brewing hophead. Warming, I was also getting a toast-like smell, probably from the roasted barley. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, not bad, but not great, either. Forget that. The taste was great, since the hops were forward, which is a knock that I usually have with the (usually malt-driven) style. It had a grassy mintiness along with a light biscuit flavor, just right for this Baby Bear. Finish was closer to semi-dry than semi-sweet and I was CANtacting my friends for more. I really dug this twist on the style and would certainly CANsider it for inclusion in my cooler."

"Poured on-tap at the Tap House and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a caramel brown coloring, with a thin, sparse, filmy white coating of head. Nose of roasted nut, caramel, and toffee. Very rich aromas on the nose. Flavors are rich and roasted caramel forward, with a subtle resinous hopped backbone. Chocolate notes into the aftertaste to join the toffee, caramel, and nut, with a building bitterness to balance. Rich, smooth bodied, with a sweet linger into a smooth finish. Good beer."
"O: Didn't know what to expect from this beer but I am impressed. Most Irish reds I've had have been poor attempts and can't even touch this beer on a complexity level. This beer packs a lot of flavor, aroma, and alcohol and delivers it in a nice little aluminum package for you. Well done."

"The feel is smooth, lightly carbonated and a bit thick but well presented for a canned beer."

"I had an old review I'd had on tap and I liked this one. I don't know if the recipe changed or it doesn't sit well in the can but this isn't what I'd remembered."

"Reddish amber in the Duvel tulip with a modest but persistent foam. Plenty of hoppy flavors give this a bitter middle that intensifies in the aftertaste. The nutty, roasted flavors are what give it some zest. I score this highly because it's a superior example of a really dull category of beer. From the 12 oz can purchased at Whole Foods in Washington, DC."

"Taste was easily near the top of any red ale I've ever had. The pour was not near as smooth as I would normally like, but the flavor made it easy to forgive the foam after the can opened."
""

"Pretty interesting take and a memorable brew for the style. Quite different than most Irish Ale's I've had."

"Every single f^#@ing can in this six-pack has overflowed from the pour spout upon cracking, resulting in a stupidly over-foamed pour. The beer does have a nice amber color, though, under that ridiculous head. The obnoxiously overflowing pour also filled the area with lovely beer aromas of cereal grains, lemon pith, and a clean yeastiness. In the flavor, sweet caramel malts are subdued by an earthy, dry, somewhat roasty bitterness, but it all comes through just a bit thin. The light texture has some substance and energy, providing a fine complement to the flavor profile. Overall, the overflowing cans pissed me off, but after my rage subsided, I had to acknowledge that this beer is quite nice."

"O: I've had three of these on different days to see if my impression changed but this is one I won't be buying again. I had high hopes for it but it just doesn't work for me."

"Interesting beer. I like the taste, where that earth/tea flavor really shines, and the sweetness adds a lot of complexity to it."
"Overall (4.25) â€“ This is pretty interesting to me. Its got a really awesome roasted flavor to it but then finished with the familiar hop crunch. Perfect carbonation levels. The appearance is quite nice too, except, the lacing it out of control. Its like an insulating lining on my glass."
"o: a well above average red here, the deep toasted character courtesy of the roasted malt adds a great underlying complexity to the sweet caramel, pleasantly interesting for the style, drinks well"
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is an enjoyable beer and it hides the ABV pretty well, I enjoyed the hoppiness but still found it relatively easy to drink. Nothing exceptional but a better American offering in the Irish Red Ale style than I normally come across."
""
""
""
"A decent tasting beer, maybe a little much on the hints of burnt malts but I like how the dryish aftertaste keeps building long after each drink."

"A dark, copper colored brew with a healthy off-white head and major walls of lacing. The aroma brings sour mash malt, a little pine hop and fruit nougat and a touch of grassy yeast alcohol. The flavor closes the deal with deep grassy malt cider. There's a vague floral edge, slightly perfumey vegetable ideas. It has some bock-like qualities. A little skunky. A very solid red ale, easily recommended with medium body and a dry feel, smooth and modestly carbonated. Nice!"

"Certainly not standard among the Irish Reds I have sampled in the past but definitely tasty and interesting."
""

"O - I do like this beer and I think will you too. There might be better Irish Ales out there but I feel that one cannot go wrong with the Aviator Hod Rod Red. Enjoy!"

"I am very proud to say this Irish Red Ale is brewed only 15 minutes down the road from me. Nothing is over the top concerning this style of beer. Every flavor has been crafted just right. I want to see some six packs soon."
""
""
"I bought this beer because they are a local brewery from down the road. I like some of their other stuff, but this is just awful."
"O: Not too bad of a beer, but doesn't particularly separate itself from the herd."
""
"The only better Irish Red is GLBC Conways."

"Overall- This is what I imagine when I imagine an irish beer. Aviators signature brew and rightly so!"

"Served on draft at the FV draft house. Pours reddish ruddy brown color. Small wispy off white head. Good dose of lacing. Sweet up front with some caramel maltiness and bready backbone. Not much different than the Steamhead. Biscuity and bready with some yeast flavors kicking in as well. More of the chocolate malitness. Not too shabby. Tastes close to a brown ale/amber ale hybrid. Plenty of bread."
"Not a bad Irish Red. Definitely more flavor than you're average mass produced Irish Red."
"On tap at the Speakeasy in Carrboro.Poured into a standard pint a deep amber/bronze with tight one finger slight off white head that held well.Caramel toffee and brown sugar sweetness in the nose,lighter burnt toast aromas as well,the hops provide some herbal notes.Starts out with caramel malts and brown sugar with hops melding into the beer adding leafy,and herbal hops.A more hopped up red but not as big as alot of American reds."
"O: Overall a decent red, but I don't know if I'd come back to this one."
"Solid Irish ale with good flavors and presentation. Not quite anything special, but worth a try and gets the job done."
"I think I will go drink one now."
"On cask at The Wooden Nickel served in a slim pint glass a crisp dark amber with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is crisp citrus hops in front of burn caramel malts. The taste is a nice balance of burnt caramel malts and citrus hops. The beer is light, crisp and quite smooth. This is a great cask beer!"
"As a result the drinkability is good but not great. A decent enough session-style beer and a good take on one of my less than favorite styles."
"Easy drinker and hides it's slightly higher than average abv well."
"Overall probably the best red ale I've had, which, granted, doesn't say too much. But I liked this beer, would order it again, and it gets me excited to try more from Aviator. So, mission accomplished!"
"Nice flavors for an Irish Red, with hints of ""English"" hops and malts. This really strikes me as something that might be had at an English inn rather than an Irish pub. Just the same it's solid and clean. Nice brew!"
