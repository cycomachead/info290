3.82,5.2,,,,,,"330 ml bottle poured into an English pint glass. Dark orange amber in hue with minimal white head, just a smattering rimming the edges of the glass. Aroma is sweet caramel malts with a little toast ... dried fruit, butterscotch chips, walnut, with some earthy tea-like hops. Indeed, hoppier than expected, with some heavier grass and resin notes accompanied by lighter citrus. Dried plum and caramel as advertized, with some brown bread. Alcohol faintly detectable. Moderately full bodied and carbonation on the low end, rather buttery and smooth yet tannic in the finish. Does suffer from a little of the classic Big Rock caramel malt overdose syndrome but all in all a well-executed and satisfying Irish red.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 14, 2014"
4,10.2,,,,,,"Mild and full-bodied Irish style Ale. Slight indication of Nugget Nops. Warm toffee and caramel aroma, slight notes of plum. Copperish-Dark Red coloration. Very smooth. Definitely the best Irish Style Ale I've tried in Canada. 4/5.","MicroBrewOrDie","Aug 12, 2014"

I had very high hopes for this one, but it falls short. It's ok and not nearly a drainpour, but could certainly be improved, IMO. Seems like something massed produced...","chugalug06","Jun 14, 2014"

4.1,12.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall this is an interesting beer, one of my favorites from Big Rock. It's easily drinkable with a good combination of flavors (watch out or you'll pound back a case). Would definitely recommend.","CrazyMike","Aug 12, 2010"

2.93,-19.3,3.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"For the abv, it's quite drinkable. I'm not a huge fan of the initial sweetness, and find it masks any real flavour. Not a bad brew, and probably one of the better ones produced by Big Rock, but I can't really say I enjoyed this beer.","nighthawk","Apr 05, 2009"
4.1,12.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A very easy to drink, amped-up Irish ale, which, as already mentioned, goes well with many sorts of 'food'. Maybe a bit too sweet, but the extra alcohol kind of makes that a moot point after bottle or round number 2, quite pleasingly so.","biboergosum","Jan 26, 2009"
3.28,-9.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"D - This beer's defining characteristic. For a higher-ABV beer, it goes down easy; you could put back a case on a summer's night without thinking too hard about it.","stagger","Beers"

3.4,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Back in then day this was the beer that writers such as Michael Jackson raved about. Now it stands as a decent beer but still one of Big Rock's best (shouldn't this brewery have moved up to better beers rather than down?) The beer is caramel coloured, malty on the nose and big in the body. The drinkability is suspect at times with weird notes showing up on the finish. However I like this beer as it is complex for the style and well put together","canucklehead","Jan 29, 2007"
2.68,-26.2,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Tastes faily smooth, but again that Big Rock flavor, too sweet in their hop/malt balance? is evident here. A dry finish which one would expect with this type. Not bad, but there seems to be a sameness with this brewer's ales. Has anyone else noticed this??","Shadman","Jan 03, 2006"
3.55,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a fairly dark copper-red, with a very small beige head that dissipates very quickly and leaves very little lacing. Lots of carbonation, clinging to the sides of the glass and surfacing energetically, makes it look like a slightly dark ginger ale. Smell is very malty, and quite sweet. Caramel and fruitiness, with some biscuit-y notes and a mild herbal tone. Dry nuttiness as well. Taste is a bit acidic, entering with a sour note. Caramel again, to be sure, but over boiled and a bit metallic in nature. Spicy hops play a role, but only add to the sharp feeling in the taste profile. Finish is drier, with the nuts and a touch of apple showing up. Mouthfeel starts off with good body and nice carbonation, but fades near the end, and drinkability is pretty solid. Overall, the best beer I've yet had from Big Rock, which isn't saying a whole lot.","Mandrake","Dec 14, 2005"

3.85,6.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I like the taste of this one. It's probably one of my favorite Big Rock brews. Dense and fruity, malty. Good hop taste, a bit alcoholic, but not overpoweringly so. Nice bite on the tongue, surprisingly, since the beer appears a bit flat, good and warm going down. This is a very drinkable beer, especially on a cold winter night.","trevorwideman","Aug 27, 2005"
3.03,-16.5,3.5,3,3,3,3,"A brownish copper brew, with a pleasing malty aroma. Somewhat low carbonation. The head was quite small and disappeared fairly quickly. Quite smooth going down, with a fair amount of hop and alcohol bite. Some bready, oaky, and mineral hints as well. Not really my style, but still somewhat enjoyable.","fisherman34","Jul 29, 2005"
3.85,6.1,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Taste - this one is meant to be served warmer. I pour it fairly cold and it almost seems metallic, but I drink it slow and let it warm and mellow - soon the character emerges in the form of a smooth caramel, ruddy malts, and a large bitter hop contrast at the end. Goes down well with the dark finish at the end, and tastes just like something called an ""Extra strong"" Irish Ale should. Nice little beer from Big Rock.","niangelo","Jul 18, 2005"
3.38,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability is okay. A bit too thick for my liking, but otherwise fine. The slightly above average abv limits the drinkabilty.","BDTyre","Nov 09, 2004"
2.85,-21.5,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Overall: I never found the word ""Extra"" in the title on the bottle, and I most certainly didn't find it in the bottle. I hesitated to collect this one from the cooler and adopt it, but Ill always try something once, especially as it was only $1.48, so I figured I would give it a whirl, and I did..but I much preferred it if I had left this bastard orphan alone, I wouldnt adopt this one and give it a home again. I wouldnt loose any sleep if this Irish Style Ale Traditionally Brewed in Canada stayed there.","TheLongBeachBum","Oct 25, 2004"
3.55,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear amber/copper colored liquid with tan creamy head that disappeared quickly, leaving little lacing. Aroma of malt and caramel with an added sweet, honey smell. The continued carbonation gave it a nice full mouthfeel. As the beer warmed up, it gave an even stronger and fuller flavor matching the aromas. I think it is one of the better Big Rock products.","BigBry","Oct 22, 2004"

3.39,-6.6,3,4,3,3.5,3.5,"As the beer warmed some, the bitter finish faded, and I started to enjoy the beer a bit more. All in all, not a bad beer, though a more complex taste would be needed for it to stand out.","elricorico","Jul 16, 2004"
3.08,-15.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"From a brown 12 oz bottle, it pours amber with a medium off-white head. The smell is a bit of caramel with a trace of metallic smell in the background. The taste also has notes of caramel and the metallic smell carries over into the taste. Hops are on the light side, even for a purportedly Irish style ale. It's not particularly interesting but not offensive either. Two was about the limit on this one.","mickeymac","Jun 14, 2004"
3.28,-9.6,4.5,4,3,3.5,2.5,"Pours a reddish amber color with a modest head and excellent lace. Smells literally like raisin bread, with rum notes in the back. The taste is very malty with raisin, apple and caramel flavors. Theres also a very present alcohol spiciness. Even for this malt exentuated style, I think this beer is weak in the hop department. Murphy's Irish red for example is much drier and balanced. Nice subtle carbonation makes a good mouthfeel. Theres a strange pixie sticks sweetness in the finish that ruins this beers drinkability. Its still by far the best of the Big Rock offerings I have tried.","CAMRAhardliner","May 19, 2004"
3.6,-0.8,3,3,4,4,3.5,"This is a nice beer from Calgarys Big Rock Brewery which has recently been made available in Nova Scotia. The beer pours an orange-red color with little head. The aroma is more sour than floral, but not unappealing. This beer has a very creamy mouth feel. Its taste is tart and sweet almost berry-like initially, becoming bitterer near the finish. Although this beer has seven percent alcohol by volume, the alcohol flavors are well masked. The alcoholic content is apparent however with a slight warming feeling. Overall, a good alternative to the beers to the run of the mill macro or even national craft beers.","manchester81","Apr 28, 2004"

3.5,-3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a clear dark amber color with a modest in size head that is frothy in texture and the color a light tan, as the head erodes, it leaves behind a fine sheet of lace to cover the glass. Nose is malt dominated, somewhat sweet, crisp and fresh with the start having a nice malt profile, top is a bit thin for me, but acceptable nonetheless. Finish is biting in its acidity, hops are apparent, but not overpowering, dry and lingering aftertaste, a fine drinking beer, which is nice as it does show up on the shelves here every so often.","Gusler","Jul 05, 2003"

Nose is sweet malt and caramel with a hint of fruity alcohol. Medium in body and smooth and creamy in texture. Taste picks up right where the aroma left off with notes of sweet caramelized malts and buttery toffee followed by a touch of fruit and some drying alcohol. A nice brew that does a fairly good job of hiding the 7% abv. Thanks to lipschitz for the sample!","Morris729","Beers"
3.98,9.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Color is dark amber and recieves a white frothy head about a finger high and faded within a minute leaving no lace. Smell is soft with caramel malt and a hint of hop. Taste is sweet malt of caramel flavor then procedes into the balancing hop of faintly dry bite. Its mostly malty with a few nice things going for it as far as balance and body. Feel is strongly medium bodied and bold, slightly silky/buttery smooth and sweet with a nice light drying finish from hops. This is very drinkable, smooth, bold, and well balanced.","tavernjef","0"
