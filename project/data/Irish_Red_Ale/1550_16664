I ordered a flight of six of their standard beers and as I tried each one I found that each was spot on to the style. The remarkable thing is how unremarkable the beers are. Don't get me wrong, they are well worth the try and certainly above average but they are produced for a mass market. So as lazy as it may be I am going to simply say that this beer was a text book example of the style without breaking out and setting itself above.","KYGunner","Jan 21, 2014"

3.74,5.6,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"on tap at the Westminster location. an appropriate beer for st pattys day. the pour is clear brick red, nice and dark with a good inch of off white foam. the nose is surprisingly complex, lots of floral springtime essences and an orange or tangerine citric element that's uncommon in the style. all this behind a sturdy red malt body and a biscuit ale yeast. the flavor is identical to the nose, but with the orange only coming out after its swallowed. I love the layers here, and it feels just right for spring. its an easy mug to get through, with a medium body and cruisy carbonation. its not really as dry as advertised, but who cares. the long finish allows the orange and flower petal thing to really come out. overall I like this a lot, especially for a chain produced red ale. I think rock bottom is pretty impressive for a chain though, the food is fantastic and the beers are always a little creative. also, proceeds to charity for this one, so props for that.","StonedTrippin","Mar 10, 2013"

Nice deep malty scent, with slight sugar and caramel tones. Wonderful taste, with a great middle-depth malt deepness, with good caramel undertones and a nice crystal malt sweetness; decent hop finish under a nice tangy maltiness. Goes down extremely smoothly; very refreshing and cleansing.","JamesS","Oct 24, 2010"

The nose brings some light bready and caramel malts with a bit of roast. Slightly roasted malt character alongside some light caramel and toffee. A bit of citrus in there with some bitterness following along. Drinks fairly well and the lighter malt is complemented by light citrus hopping.","Thorpe429","Mar 28, 2010"

Since it's a beer that has been released at numerous Rock Bottoms around the country, and since most BAs don't seem overly fond of it, I wonder if the recipe was predetermined by corporate headquarters. Better to let the local brewmasters unleash their creativity. At least then there'd be a chance at good beer.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 25, 2006"

3.5,-1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The appearance is a medium brown/copper, with a beige head, mild lacing. Aroma is a very muted hint of malt. Initial taste consists of a gentle caramel (but not as sweet) grain, few hops, dry and mildly carbonated. Few high notes. Designed to be an average crowd pleaser. I know the brewmaster (John) and his standards are higher. He is planning some awesome brews for the coming months after March 2006. Stay tuned.","palliko","Apr 05, 2005"

2.7,-23.7,3,3,2.5,2,3,"Served at Rock Bottom Chicago. Here it was presented as an Irish red ale, and I dont think any of us has many great expectations from this style. Still, there are some nice roasty malt notes, and a noticable hop profile in an attractive red body. A decent enough session ale.","DrunkMcDermott","Apr 13, 2004"
3.93,11,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Its clear, deep copper body has an orange-ish glow to it, and its creamy tan head holds well before dropping to a thin surface covering that leaves thin splashes of lace. The nose is caramelish and fruity. Its medium body is accentuated by a crisp carbonation that gently "zests" the tongue and wakens the tastebuds. In the flavor, a juicy, berry-like fruitiness is found up-front; followed by a caramel-tinged, toffee-ish malt and lightly spicy and floral hops. It's very well balanced by a firm bitterness, and its fruity and toffee-ish flavors combine brilliantly. I didn't think I was going to like this one as much as I did... but I just had to have a second pint. Very well done, and quite drinkable!","NeroFiddled","Mar 31, 2004"
3.75,5.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Flavor is well balanced with a malt forefront and a hop zing. As the finish comes on and the malt flavor takes a break the hops come back and dance on the tongue to wipe the caramel and bring us back to a zing for the next sip.","drewbage","Mar 30, 2004"
3.65,3.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a dark amber color with a white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a light malt scent along with some mild aroma hops. The taste is decent. It is a little weak in the malt department as well as the hops department. This is supposed to be an American pale ale. That usually means some good hop flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied brew with good carbonation. This is like most of their beers, weak and made for the masses. It falls short on style.","WesWes","Mar 20, 2004"
4.1,15.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep reddish amber color with a thin layer of light foam. Lace was minimal but there was some. The aroma was floral and mildly malty, somewhat earthy.

Fire orange in color, a bit hazy and topped by a generous head, the aroma is mellow and hints at just a bit of spicy hops. The first sip brings forth a smooth, rounded brew with a mild maltiness and a nice bold, but not aggressive bitterness that carries through in the finish. Not like any other steam beer I have had, but fairly tasty by any standard. Very drinkable, even caught on with some of my beer-wuss buddies.","beernut7","Beers"
