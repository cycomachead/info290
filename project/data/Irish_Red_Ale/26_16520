Expect the fact that its extremely well balanced~ I would say a nice even balance of Hops and Malt~ Really just a perfect brew for session drinking~ Such a great take on what is traditionally a rather boring and dull style~ I can't believe I'm tasting 'Strawberry' in a NON sugary processed adjunct ale, Its naturally sweet and delicious~ Overall: 92","BrewUSA","Jan 12, 2014"

3.42,-15.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured this 22 ounce bomber into a weizen glass (for size, not style). Color is a cloudy deep copper, with an inch-deep ivory head, well-structured but not persistent. Citrus hops scream on the nose, with more subtle caramel notes hiding beneath. More hops on the palate, but of the piney variety and more than a little tart, giving way gradually to undertones of toasted malt. The body is a bit flabby with little carbonation and a non-descript finish. Generally enjoyable and refreshing but I would have expected a bit better focus from this brewery.","AnotherBeerGeek","Jul 03, 2013"

4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, Spring 2013 bottling. Pours lightly hazy reddish orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, grapefruit, orange zest, floral, grass, slight pine, and light yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with all around great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with moderate hop presence and good strength. Taste of caramel, apple, golden raisin, grapefruit, orange zest, toast, toffee, floral, grass, light pine, biscuit, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, citrus, floral, grass, toast, toffee, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, fairly crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Irish Red style! All around great complexity and balance of malt, hop, and ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 06, 2013"

The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is fantastic. This is just a great beer. I could see this being a favourite at the bar, that is if I could get it there.

Taste: There is a wondeful light hoppy citric/pineapple character that jumps right out in the flavor before the expected toasty bread elements and a slightly sweet caramel emerge. A deeper note of dark roasted coffee appears. Finally a delicious washing of juicy citrus into the finish which is dry with a lingering interplay of coffee roast bitterness and citric juiciness. If there is any disappointment its the body, which seems a bit on the light side to me. Very interesting and enjoyable twist on the dry, malt forward Irish red style.","JackieTH","May 31, 2012"

Feel is a little tingly/fizzy with a slightly glassy component. The hops are nicely prominent without taking away from the style. Grassy and a bit herbal, they finish with a bit of dryness which balance off the sweet clover and makes for a pretty unique but satisfying (and drinkable) Irish Red! A solid brew for sure.","Durge","Apr 08, 2012"

The smell on this leans heavily towards the malted end of the spectrum. I like to smell a bit more hops, but perhaps my expectations for the style are off. There are some nice caramel and vanilla notes as well. The taste is strange. In addition to the malt forward character of this beer, it has a taste as though it's heavy in alcohol despite being only 5.5% ABV. Very odd. The mouthfeel is very malty in a way that sticks around and coats your mouth for an extended period of time. There's an astringent quality to this that I'm not too keen on, and again, it gives off a feel as though it's really boozy. Overall, this is average. Not one of my favorites from FFF.","Retail1LO","Mar 24, 2012"

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Brian Boru pours a very attractive reddish copper color. A two finger head recedes gradually leaving nice lacing and a thin white coaster. The nose is very hoppy. Smells like an IPA! Was not expecting that. Taste is hop forward at the start with some nice citrus characteristics. Hops give way to a nice malt backbone mid palate. Big caramel and toffee notes are present. Hoppy bitterness returns towards the end, and the finish is dry with a slight lingering bitterness. The beer is medium bodied with a bit of viscosity to it. Carbonation is medium. Overall, Brian Boru is a tasty, very drinkable brew from Three Floyds. I certainly appreciate their hoppy take on the style and would gladly have this again if given the chance.","Sideswipe","Jun 07, 2011"

I categorize this somewhere between Alpha King and Dreadnaught - it's like a beefed-up, slightly maltier Alpha King or a Dreadnaught that's been balanced with some caramel malts and had the hop regimen dialed down a few notches. Not so Irish Red, but hey. It's delicious - can't knock it too much for that :)","machostacos","Apr 03, 2011"

Pours a clear, deep ruby color with a thick off-white beige head. Retains very nice lacing throughout the drinking session. Beautiful! Nose picks up pine-y hops, citrus, caramel malts, biscuit, buttered toast, toffee, some pineapple, and resin. Flavor of pine-y hops, honey, resin, grapefruit and orange citrus, toast, herbal notes, and definitely a nice share of caramel malts. Light-medium bodied, with average carbonation throughout and a dry, bitter finish in a very good way. Crisp, refreshing, and extremely well-balanced for the style. Perfect amount of hops and bitterness. This brew has become my favorite for the Irish Red Ale style. I'm actually surprised to see this at under 6% ABV, so it's definitely sessionable!","CuriousMonk","Mar 08, 2011"

Slightly malty, bready, green hops, apricots, slightly bitter finish. Medium to light bodied with a medium carbonation. Not the best example of the style but I really like it.

BB pours a cloudy dark amber to red color with good head retention and laciness. The aroma is hoppier then traditional reds, but still has that malt blend. Other traces of citrus and some piney scent are noticeable as well. The taste is good but maybe too hoppie for traditional styles. But I'm a hop head so its all good. The taste is not as hop dominate as the smell would indicate. Very well balanced. A good flavor malt with a mix of base and sweeter malts (maybe lighter crystal) and a slight caramel flavor. Almost reminds me of an American Barelywnie toned down. A definite hop citrus is present but doesn't overpower or lingering. Very easy to drink and a great flavor to boot. I think it's ironic that I picked up a great tasting ""Red"" Ale that has the same home as the Cincinnati ""Reds.""","GBB","Dec 22, 2010"

The hops are there, but seem to fade quickly with just a hint of the grapefruit flavor. There is a doughy yeast characteristic as well.

Three Floyds Brian Boru pours deep copper/crimson and is generously capped with scads of beige froth. Good lacing is immediate, and stays the course. There's lotas of hops in the aroma, which is both strange but suprisingly welcome for a beer in this style. Fruity aromas take second place, and win the silver medal. Third place goes to caramel and burnt malts. But hops win the oscar. Sweet fruit and bold hops are the main flavour contenders, and suragy malt, burnt molasses have decided to tag along. Boru finishes sweet with good length of bitterness and ripe citrus. I'd drink Irish Ales all day log if this was the archetype. Really very well done. Again Philip, you have my thanks.

I stand corrected...Boru was quite good. Poured a nice, reddish brown. Adequate head, generous when warmer; but quickly fades to just a skin of foam across the top.

3.76,-6.9,4,3,4,4,4,"An active and bubbly head slowly turns into a thick and fine pure tan froth and leaves a tall, sticky lacing behind. Color is a rusty red. At the nose, citrus hops are about all I can discern. Possibly some tea and caramel malts underneath. Lack of a big profile here does is not necessarily a bad thing, as it's subtly is pleasant. On the palate a good amount of sweetness mixes with some nuanced hops and faint tea notes. An undercurrent of citrus works itself into the equation after a bit. The light to medium body works well here, as it's not fleeting going down, but gives you something to think about, and has just enough weight to keep it from being a full on summer session brew. Apparently, the Irish Red is a hard style to conquer, and it seems nobody has really made a truly great one, but FFF has come the closest as far as I can tell. Then again, it just might be that the style is not quite in favor right now, but this one hits the spot for me either way.","stephens101","Jun 06, 2009"

Tastes of caramelized malts and grains, orange peel, candied lemon, toffee, more caramel. This red ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation for the style.

The aroma is big malt up front with a good amount of orangey citrus and just a bit of pineapple. The flavor is much of what you would assume a red ale is supposed to be. Malty up front but still very balanced. Sweet, but not overly so. There is a bit of orange hops, but they are much milder on the palate then they are in the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit full with a tickling amount of carbonation. It's really nice to see Three Floyds doing a toned down beer.

A slight breadiness as well. The taste is definitely some earthy hop with a stern malt backbone. The caramel malt and bitter earthy hops are well balanced. I can taste some nice breadiness too. Maybe a slight alcohol tinge? Mouthfeel is pretty low to medium carbonation with a somewhat slick feel down the throat. Overall this is a good irish red. It's solid but not outstanding. I wouldn't pay top dollar for this so, it's a tad overhyped/overpriced but pretty solid.","ShrLSU","Dec 19, 2008"

However, it's not very complex (although I don't expect it to be). That earthy, wet grass hops flavor doesn't much suit the malt backbone of the beer either. Mouthfeel is good, what I want from an Irish Red. In the end, while I could drink this beer for a while, I'm not impressed enough to want to.

I'm not a hop head per se, though I like the occasional DIPA, but a stronger than average hop presence to balance a strong malty base is my idea of a red ale, and Three Floyd's does a great job with this one. The aroma is light, and doesn't pull up into the nose well, and the head was weak and the rust color became a barely noticable blob in the center of the very, very red-ruby-red beer. If in a well lit bar or a sunny patio, the red color, from a distance, could be mistaken for a summer fruity beer.

Grapefruit and pineapple hops in the aroma with additional notes of leafy hops, faint tea, and caramel. There is mango and pineapple on the palate with a light to medium bitterness and a firm, toasted malt backbone with hints of tea. It has a medium body that is somewhat dry, and near the end of the first pour it's a bit watery, but the second pour cures that. Overall a good, quite drinkable Irish red that really brings out the hop flavor without getting all the bitterness.

Three Floyds hops the shit out of everything, and this is no exception. With an open mind, this is no doubt their take on an Irish Red, albeit untraditional. Piney hoppiness dominates the flavor of this beer. Underneath all the hop bitterness lies a caramel and toasted malt flavor. Gets a touch seltzery. Definitely unique for the style, but off the mark, if you ask me. Hop heads will probably enjoy this quite a bit, but I don't feel this is inline for an Irish Red.

The malts and hops are balanced beautifully in the aromas of mandarin, pineapple, toffee, and caramel. Carbonation is minimal. MF is creamy initially, becomes dry and biting halfway through, and then goes back to the malts. I cant say that it really fits the style, but it obviously isnt meant too.

Taste was similar- grapefuit, and orange hop dominating this ale. Doughy, pleasant, bready malt hanging way in the back, quietly providing backbone, not at all sweet, and without any roasted acridness, there was even a slight aftertaste of tea. And all the time grapefruit, oranges, lemon, hops, and hops, and very dry - hey!! : This is really an IPA in disguise! Mouthfeel was smooth and full, very satisfying, with moderate carbonation.

The hoppiness transfers over in the taste as well, mixing with orange and herbs on the tremendously long finish. The mouthfell was just right. Not too heavy or too thin, but perfectly balanced. I ended up having 4 or 5 throughout the evening, and at 5.9% alc (which suprised me when I found out) it was easy to drive the hour and a half home.

4.5,11.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22 ounce bomber. This beer pours out dark red with a large, dense head. For a beer, this smells a lot like grapefruit. There is also caramel in the aroma. The flavor is grapefruit again, but not at all sour or bitter. Malt flavors come out as the beer warms. While this beer has a lot of flavor, it is somehow light and fluffy. Addictive drinkability. Hop burps are among the best I've had. Between this beer and the Gumballhead, Three Floyds has proved how far they can take what are usually known as non-experimental styles of beer.","beveragecaptain","Jun 03, 2005"
4.22,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Another damn fine beer from Three Floyds. Only drawback could be price. At $6.99 for a bomber, I can see having one or two a year. Knock that down to $6.99 a sixer, and I'll have at least a case a year. Definitely worth a try at any rate.","RonfromJersey","Jun 02, 2005"
4.35,7.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I have been on a streak lately with some great beers. This one courtesy of starchild. It pours a firebrick red out of the bottle. Very clear. Great light refraction against the wall. Thick foam head. Stringy lace. Nose is old pine with an awesome malt and caramel backdrop. It is what my ""Martha Stewart"" SO refers to as worn. Flavor is much of the same, malty and piney; only more pronounced. Lots of roasted caramel on top of a nice hop layer that provides a great balance. Maybe a little ctrius too, but I cannot narrow as to what citrus is could be... Mouthfeel is halfway between medium and full bodied. Nice finish that leaves the mouth dry enough to want another sip, bit not so dry that the sip needs to be water.","MuddyFeet","May 31, 2005"

4.42,9.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Freed from its bomber, this brew fills my glass a red orange hue, with some haze. Slight whitish head. Aroma is hoppier than I would have expected - not at all a bad thing. Toasty malt and sweet caramel coexist with clean citrous and floral hops. Smooth malts lead the flavor with some toasty breadiness apparent, as well as hints of caramel. Hops are crisp and present in a big way. Bitter citrous and some resinous pine threaten the malt backbone. Quite hoppy for an Irish ale, but you'll never hear me complaining about that. Finish is slightly drying citrous mixed with a little sweetness. Cheers to Three Floyds for their take on the style.","BeerFink","Apr 27, 2005"

Plus they're really not that bitter, just flavorful which is good for an Irish Red imo. Caramel, biscuit, pine, and light fruit notes are in the malts. Nothing too sweet, in fact, sweetness is held to a minumim. Great balance. Tons of flavor without any excess sweetness or bitterness. Very well made, I bet the Irish would drink this by the gallons!","granger10","Apr 26, 2005"
4.3,6.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a dark amber color with a tall head that has decent retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops. Bunches and bunches of citrus hop with just a touch of caramel malt. The flavor doesn't have the extreme hop profile that the aroma foretold, but there's still some hop flavor. Slightly fruity with a nice malt character. Pretty well balanced and enjoyable. Light body and easy to drink.","clvand0","Apr 25, 2005"

Citrusy and although you know some nice carmalized malt is in there it is not very detectable due to all the hop fragrence. Upon tasting the hops are not as immediate and some of the malts come shining through. A bit fruity. Suprisingly light considering the color. The hoppiness of it balances out the malts nicely and make it much more drinkable. Proabably a bit to hoppy for the style but a damn tasty and quality beer.","sabrills70","Apr 23, 2005"
4.12,2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Cracked open the bottle and immediately smelled hops. Poured the entire bomber into a large mug, the red body with a cascading thin head, with tons of carbonation. Smells of flowery hops with a bitter back to it, fruits, maybe a peach... or apple... and caramel malt. Taste. Hops are on the tip of the tongue, with a nice sweet caramel and even a little fruit, more of the apple seems to be coming through. Let me take a second drink. Definitely taste more of the caramel with the hops. I can probably drink this entire glass within the next five minutes, but I shall savor it instead.","HoboAGoGo","Apr 21, 2005"

This reminds me of a pumped up, red version of Yards' newest edition of their Phily Pale Ale. Anyways. The aromas is all citrusy hops, pineapple, and toasted, biscuity malts. Nice. The taste is juicy with the fresh hops, and nicely malty as well, with a sweet biscuity kiss. This stuff just smells and tastes so fresh and juciy that it slides down the throat with eaze. Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied and drinkability is excellent!","francisweizen","Beers"
2.65,-34.4,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Orange-amber body, lasting beige ring. Rather dull aroma, this seems so simple and feels like déjà vu as much as anything else. Ample grapefruity/tangerine like hops dominate (while being fairly fragile) the leafy and rocky aroma. Mineral palate, thin-medium bodied, highly carbonated. Very dry palate boasting more astringent hops than is recommendable. Very earthy, herbal (lichen, algae).. Those hops feels raw and attaches to the palate, this is not aggressive, its just dull in the same sense than a fly you want to push away.

Streaky lacing was left on the glass. Big piney hop nose. This hit me as a bit of a surprise with a red ale, but then again it is 3 Floyds. Even with the huge hoppiness there is a great sweet maltiness that manages to show itself. Very excellent aroma. Caramel malt upfront on the flavor with a backend hop kick. Floral and piney hops are plenty. Tasty stuff that ends with a bitter sweet finish. Great mouthfeel and it is quite creamy. Very easy drinking and it is quite sessionable. Reminds me of what they did to the Porter with Alpha Klaus. Great stuff all around especially for the hop heads.","meathookjones","Apr 13, 2005"
4.02,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall, the beer leans heavily towards the hops, moreso than I'd anticipate for the style, but still a very tasty product. It carries all the character of a beer brewed by the Floyds in Indiana. Clean, bright, bitter, with an appropriate malt as called for by the style. Definately worthwhile.","drewbage","Apr 09, 2005"
4.25,5.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Thanks to orbitalr0x for this one. It pours a deep amber color with a 2 finger head that falls to a finger over top of the beer. The nose is nice and piney, with a good sweet caramel underneath the hop. Very nice. The flavor is actually more mellow than expected. How I like it. The first to hit is sweet caramel, followed by a very mellow, but very flavorful piney hop. The feel is moerate wtih a moerate carbonation. As far as red beers go, this is the most flavorful one I have ever had. I know its not what is supposed to be for style, but damnit all if I don't like this take more than the style. Very easy drinking and smooth.","kmpitz2","Apr 03, 2005"

4.57,13.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I absolutely loved this brew on-tap at the Hopleaf in Chicago so I had a friend pick me up a bottle from Kahn's on his way to Lafayette. It appears to pour just a shade darker than from tap, a nice ruby tinged with a light brown supporting a 1 finger pale tan head. Citrusy notes of Amarillo are strong in the nose as well as a nice carmel malt-ish sweetness. A little bit of chocalate rounds out the aroma. Very impressive for an Irish red. Taste is very crisp. Although one could easily say that Three Floyd's over uses Amarillos, I love the edge that they give to their brews. The intial citrus punch soon fades into a sea of sweet malt finishing with notes of caramel. Superbly drinkable. I'm not usually a fan of ambers/irish reds but I absolutely love this beer. I'll surely miss Three Floyd's after moving away in a few months.","soper2000","Mar 17, 2005"

However I don't feel the malt is there to support the hops in this delicious monster, at least enough to call it an ""Irish Red Ale"". The hops are all grapefruit in punch and I would like to see more dimensions to the hop characteristics. This is another good solid beer from 3F's but not a great beer yet.
