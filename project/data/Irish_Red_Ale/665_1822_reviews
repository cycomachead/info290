"Pours out to a rich creamy buff head that lasts and a deep auburn color. Aroma is caramel, biscuit, bread, nuts and  and cooked veggies. Flavor is nondescript amber ale with low hopping, a slight toastiness/nuttiness. Slightly sweet finish. Mouthfeel is light and slick. Overall, boring and mass produced but not particularly bad."
"I get a toffey taste from it or maybe it's caramel. To me it is a refreshing taste from all the floral taste out there! I would recommend it to my friends."

"Great beer. Smooth and easy to drink but still has lots of flavour. One of my favorites!"

"NOT sure what to say here....Not a BAD beer...But Nothing I would recommend either....Go with Murphy's Red if you have a Choice"

"While it may lack the depth of taste of a truly good craft beer, it remains one of my gateway beers to the Craft scene. After not having one in a while, it's still a good beer, especially at an Irish theme bar!"
""
""
""
"A decent beer. A serious brew head would give it a low score but it is a good adventure beer for folks looking for something light but different."

"The Rest: Decent body and carbonation, but fairly unremarkable otherwise. It lacks a robust, appealing malt profile; this is much to grainy tasting."

"O-The beer could be summed up with one word and that word is okay."
""
"12oz bottle, no freshness date. I haven't had a smithwicks in probably ten years. Now I know why. Boring aroma and flavor, both were grainy and forgettable. Deep red color.I would likely never buy another one of these unless I was actually in Ireland."

"Sampled on tap at a ""Scottish ale house"" serving mostly Irish and local brews. A red to dark chalky brown ale with some light butterscotch foam. Astonishingly little in the way of aroma, maybe a hint of dried dark fruit (raisin) and toffee but largely flat on the nose. Taste was mellow toast, dilute caramel sauce, slight hop bitterness, little of the tea-like smooth bitterness and body of other Irish reds. Watery and thin, lingering sweet finish with a little cardboard. Unobjectionable but insipid."

"Has a lovely red brown color. Advertized as a red ale. Thin head on draft in a Guinness glass. Almost no aroma, or my nose is plugged up. A very disappointing taste, mildly citrys, little hops, no malt. Very fizzy, almost like a cola. I'm glad to have sampled it, but i wont be trying it again. At least the fish and chips were good!"

"So many ales have a bitter aftertaste. Smithwick Irish Ale satisfies long after the swallow. The only problem I have with this ale is locating it. I try to buy as many six-packs as I can when I locate it on the shelves. Nevertheless, eventually the stores seem to just stop stocking this beer."
""
"One of my favorite beers. Looks and tastes like a excellent craft beer should - not too hoppy. No strong odor or bitter aftertaste. Drinkable and smooth. No comparison to Guiness, as this one is very drinkable and not ""heavy"" like Guiness Extra Stout. Great history of brewery as well."

"O - This was a light beer, nuetral, ~no hops or malt. Then with black patent added. I would not buy again."
""
""
"My pour produced better than two fingers' worth of dense, light-tan head with great retention in today's heat and humidity. It looked like the top of a coffee ice cream cone. Color was a deep coppery-red with NE-quality clarity, the shade that makes me swoon when it is on a woman. Nose was malty, fairly sweet, nothing terribly remarkable. Mouthfeel was on the thin side and other than a mild sweetness, it really lacked Ooomph of any sort. It was not bad, just lacking. Finish was equally ho-hum. I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth, but this was not doing anything for me."
""
"Overall, an average red ale. I would have no problem drinking it again, especially in hotter days. But it is not unforgettable."

"Taste is mild and malty, again, with the hops coming in near the finish. Overall, a very plain and unremarkable (even forgettable) ale. Won't pursue this one again anytime soon."

"It pours a reddish brown in color with a light foam head. The nose is mostly malty with some hints of earth and nut. The beer flavor is pretty simple and clean. There is a slight hoppiness to the finish which is really the most distinguishing characteristic aside from the nose. Its okay but with a whole world of beer out there to try I am not sure when or if I will drink it again."
"The body is light with a slight dry finish. As mentioned, clean and crisp. Overall this is kind of like a hybrid amber/lager with limited taste overall. Very easy to drink and easily attainable in Ireland."
"This is one delicious Ale. Arrives a deep ruby color with a finger head that doesnt go away for a while and leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Smells pretty bitter up front and so does it taste, but it goes down smooth and the faint taste of bread is what is left on your tongue on the end."
"I love the Irish Reds, and one brewed in the Emerald Isle will always get my taste buds' attention. This is my favorite of all the bottled redheads I've had through the years. I enjoy just about everything this beer has to offer. The color, aroma, and taste are all outstanding. Only the aftertaste, maybe something to do with the bottling process, could be a little better in my book."
"Taste - Malted and mild. Not bitter at all. A distant hint of hops."
"D - Drinks OK nothing special, I've had better reds"
"On tap at the Irish bar and restaurant Grasshopper Too in Wayne, NJ. Pours very dark black with a good amount of head. Smells sweet, a bit of clove, very roasty. Very easy to drink. Dark, sweet caramel taste. Very malty, a little bit of hoppiness but not very noticeable. A little watery, but the Irish should be proud, this is a fantastic effort."
"D: Malts and flattish feel could get tiresome, but certainly nothing offensive. Better than many of its style."
"Pours nicely with a medium head with light lace neither of which lasted very long. Medium dark amber color. No real nose for me to appreciate. Taste slightly sweet, mellow hop, no overtly carbonated. Immediately gave a flat somewhat watery mouthfeel but still pleasant. I found this brew easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Not very heavy, drinkable if you actually like it. A little on the wrong side of average."
"Overall this is a decent beer. Better than a lot of other macros, but you can find better beers."
"Overall...not bad...beats up on domestics. very drinkable...not too heavy."
"Smithwick's is an easy beer to find in the USA, and it is common to see it on the store shelves in many stores- even small carryouts. But Smithwick's, while certainly acceptable, is a little on the boring side, with a taste that attempts to be complex but that doesn't offer enough body or character to reach its full potential. It is also a tad overpriced, too, and I can think of many beers that taste better and cost less. Still, the taste is good enough to imbibe a few bottles when there is nothing better available."
"Good clean appearance with a decent head. Malt smells with definate but modest hints of apples. Slightly bitter taste (was expecting a little more). Carbonation was light which was what I was expecting. Overall was a decent beer but one that was just average."
"The pint came a dark caramel brown color with a wispy head. Aroma is light with a generic maltiness coming through. Fairly light caramel and toffee on the palate. No hop or bitterness to mention. A fairly light flavored beer, but refreshing nonetheless."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer more than I thought that I would. I feel that I could have had a few more and will be buying/ordering this beer again."
"The taste is similar, mostly lightly sweet, dark-bready with hints of burnt caramel and earth. It has only a faint hint of bitterness. It's somewhat bland and one-dimensional, thinning out at the end."
"Tasted: 06/16/07"
"Drinks easy though and makes for a better session beer than many other mass brews."
"Thiner mouthfeel than I expected but a good if not great beer."
"Drinkability : a good beer in Irish red ale style (but I prefer the draught version)"
"Drinkability,....it definitely left me wanting more,....this will be an excellent afternoon BBQ beer or a great one with a snack and a good ballgame!"
"Smithwick's has good balance with a bitter hop finish. The full body complimented the tight-bubbled head that left a great deal of lace on the glass. Frankly, I expected far less. The only distraction might be the lack of aroma, but I find this to be commonplace amongst those poured in a bar--by the time the beer arrives the smell is nearly gone."
"D: Drinkability is surprising easy and quite good. I really enjoy the minerality in the water and the sweet toasted malt lacing in the finish of this beer. decent per style."
"I won't be drinking this stuff again."
" ~ If the flavor were more enjoyable this would be a solid session brew. As for now I think I'll pass."
"This is a decent ale. It poured with a good sized head and left nice lacing in the glass. It smelled faintly of sweet malts. The taste was pleasing and balanced, but a bit muted. A touch more hops and a stronger malt backing would make it a lot more interesting. A good everyday ale, if a bit pedestrian."
"D-Fairly drinkable. Not really anything to write home about."
"From a bottle this poured a copper to brown color with a nice fat tan head and good lacing. Nose of nuts, caramel malts, and toffee is present. Smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is sweet with touches of malts and light hops, and the finish is dry. Decent Irish Ale."
"Nice aroma, slighty sweet and malty. Tastes similar, and has a nice off white creamy head. Delicious, very easy to drink, with almost no hoppy bitterness whatsoever. Very smooth aftertaste. Drank on draught at 2 locations in Austin. The first was definitely less carbonated than the second locations, yet it is still a lightly carbonated beer, either way. Would definitely get again, and enjoyed. Would make a decent session beer"
"I enjoyed it."
"this is my first true irish red ; pours a med. ruddy-brown color w/ a thin head which dissipates quickly leaving little lacing in my pint glass ; a faint burnt caramelish aroma, no hops to speak of ; a little on the thin side, there's a crisp, caramel malt-like flavor at first, followed by a slight floral hop bite w/ some nutty undertones, similar in taste to an eng. mild brown with less hops ; a light, almost watery body w/ a modest amount of co2, would be dry if not for the ""wet"" taste ; not a bad drinking beer, a good style example (though i'm not too familiar w/ the style), but i could knock back a lot of this..."
"Final Statement: Pretty bland mass produced irish red. Not a good example of the style. I remember it being better 3 or 4 years ago."
"A dark ice tea color brew with a thin but sturdy off-white head and decent lacing. The aroma is a light chocolate malt. The flavor suggests some charcoal and malt. It is finely carbonated with a peppery sense at the front and a hint of chocolate in the background. A little acqueous, still a solid choice. Mellow and quite drinkable."
"Had beer at a ball game where other Guiness ales also available. Dark amber color with nice white creamy head that it stayed for a good while. Aroma is mild. Nice full flavor that is similar to smell, nothing spectacular, but very drinkable. Mouthfeel is good and aftertaste stays full."
"Pours nice amber color with small creamy head that it retained for a good while. Aroma is a little on the weak side, but pulled roasted malt and some caramel from it. Decent flavor that is similar to smell, nothing spectacular, but extremely drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth, but thin. Lacing was minimal."
"Great Irish beer, good deep red colour, finger thick head that lasted for quite a while. It has a real mellow ale taste, good mouthfeel. I had it multiple times in Ireland and each time was as good as the last. It definitly leaves you wanting another pint."
"I recently tried this on tap at a local Toronto eatery and found it to be an alright brew. The colour was a brownish colour, slightly dark with an off-white head that didn't stay long. The aroma was slightly malty and sweet but weak. The flavour was slightly malty at the start but became better as I got closer to the bottom. Like other ales I have tried it was thick on the tongue with little carbonation. This is one of those brews that when provided a list on tap...if I've previously tried them all...occassionally I'll pick this one."
"Pours a beautiful translucent brown-red with a very thick and persistent head. Pleasant aroma is mostly malty but has some hoppy hints. Flavor is more malty than hoppy, with some hop bitterness and a hint of caramel. A smooth and very enjoyable ale, definitely worthy of one's time and money."
"D: Decent beer to drink one after the other. Not great, but easy to wash down some Irish food. Pretty refreshing ale."
"Drinkability: A good drinker, I got 2 sixes on sale for St. Patty's day and had two left to review. I liked it. I was a change of the usual Irish dry stouts I guzzle on the 17th. From what I understand this imported US version has slightly higher ABV. I would love to try the ""lighter"" version and just drink the day with this beer."
"D: Other than just trying out the bottled version for Pete's sake, I don't think I'll ever order this or even drink on a weekend afternoon."
"brew."
"D - Good session brew if you just want to slake your thirst or get drunk at an Irish pub. Good Irish bar brew for non-BA's that have a ""fear of the dark"" and want to stay away from Guiness."
"I got this on tap at Tommy Condon's in Charleston, SC. Though not bad in any aspect, I found this to be very average. Nothing exciting or original in any of the characteristics, although it is quite smooth and this improves its drinkablility. It has a light bready taste with a dry finish. Light-bodied, but the lightness causes a lack of flavor. Can neither complain nor reccommend."
"Overall, it was not my favorite. Not complex enough or well enough developed. Two-dimentional beer at best, but I'm sure it's a decent pick if you like this style."
"pours a good two finger off white head which leaves about a quarter inch at the finish dark brown in color. smell is like fresh bread. taste is caramel or brown sugar all malt. light, smooth, very nice. drinkability is very good something everyone can enjoy."
"16 oz can. Poured well carbonated into a tall glass with a good white head and no foam fall. Aroma was of strong hops and the first sip confirmed it: very bitter. Malty character flavors with some oaky flavors and even some pine essence, but not enough to overcome the bitter hops."
"Nothing that really sticks out as great, but nothing that detracts. It's a good drink that goes down smooth and fast, and a beer my wife can enjoy too."
"Not the beer I'm looking for!"
"This is probably one of the best import beers we have available in our province run liquor monopoly. I'm pretty impressed with the beers that are associated with Guiness. Guiness itself is usually quite good on tap, Harp is one of my favourite Euro Lagers and Smithwick's is quite enjoyable as well. I'm not a big Kilkenny fan, but it's better on tap than in the can. Coming from a large scale brewer like this, these are really good quality beers."
"I hadn't had this in years but it's about as I remembered. A good session beer but kind of bland."
"looks a nice red with a creamy head and lacing. Smells watery, however, like an inoffensive macro. Taste is a little weak, but still nice. A touch creamy in flavor with burnt caramel. Watery mouthfeel, but easy to drink. A tasty drink, but you might as well just order yourself a pitcher as it goes down fast."
"D - Not bad but a little bland/boring."
"On tap it had a good head and a dark brown color. It smelled malty and slightly sweet. It tasted a little bitter with a blend of caramel and malt. Mouthfeel was quite soft and creamy. It wasn't too heavy to drink. I really enjoyed my first ever Smithwick's."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I do think this is a solid brew, and I'd drink it again. I don't know the 6-pack price or anything, but this went down very easily and went very well with my Bangers and some of the spiciness of that. Maybe not the best IRA, but I'd drink more of this."
"Certainly in my opinion, this is something that I could drink on a regular basis....which I probably will with the multitude of bbq's this summer. I recommend it to those who like a mild smooth taste of an ale. And yes, goes great with any bbq."
"I wont buy this again. No point."
"Good amount of carbonation, enough malty taste to fit the amber style. Very light hops with almost no aftertaste. Easy drinking session beer. A bit more malt and it would be good. as is it's decent, better than some, but not the best."
"This beer pours a copper red with a very frothy off white head. It smells like Irish yeast with other mild maltiness. The taste is also very malty with some hop bitterness. It has a good mouthfeel, nice and thick and overall its not a bad Irish ale, but I would have to take a Highland Gaelic over this one any day."
"Pours a thick-headed, big, and bubbly head with a strange, muted, translucent brownish hue for a red ale. Left a creamy dolop at the bottom of the glass. Smells mild, lightly grassy, and of sweet malt. Taste is balanced and outstanding for a macro, with a bit of a hop bite but only in balance with the full malt, taste smooth, sweetish, tea like, and definitely UK style. Better than newcastle for sure, but it has a rather unique taste. It doesn't seem like it would be difficult to imitate and beat this, but I've as of yet had a craft brewery that tried and suceeds in this style. I'd return here, and know it would win at a party. Nothing I'll buy regularly, but I'd be excited if I saw it on tap."
"cheers..."
"Light and fizzy on the palate with no discernable hop bitterness or floral/fruit mouthfeel. Only slightly bitter. Malt is more firmly planted as primary flavor. Mediocre at best. An Irish macro ale."
"Drinkablilty: I thought it was refreshing, could drink one or two"
"Easy drinking but not worth going out of your way for."
"Well, I could see this being pounded back by someone getting drunk at a bar, but to actually drink for the pleasure, I'll pass."
"I paid way too much for the six-pack; hopefully they were just sticking it to me right before St. Patrick's Day (indeed, the reason I sought it out), as opposed to that being an extra buck and a halfI can expect to pay for this when I go looking for it again, which I will."
"Drinkability: These go down pretty good - nice on St. Paddy's day, but there's not enough going on to warrant another purchase."
"Not too bad. I got it on sale for $7. I would buy again at that price, but not the normal $10 I usually see it for."
"D- i dont know if id have this again, but its certainly easier to drink than guinness. yes i am a weakling."
"Smitchwicks pours out a copper color with a small head. I detected absolutely no aroma in this beer. I stuck my nose so far in that I inhaled foam, but I never smelled a thing. The flavor is quite watery with a bit of caramel. There is some metallic flavor. A hint of hops comes in at the finish. I can't really call this beer bad, but it has almost no flavor. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, without the creaminess I was hoping for. Not something I'll be wasting my time with again."
"Drinkability: Flavorful but not demanding; well-balanced and easy-to-drink; I liked it more than I expected - Happy St. Patrick's Day"
"Picked up a six at a local Ingle's for $7.97. Pours a dark amber color with a nice thick head. Not much in the aroma department, just a little light dry malt. Taste was a disapointment too, faint pale roasted malt with little hop bitterness. I hate to say it but I would prefer a Killian's over this. Way over priced. On the label it says ""From a recipe inspired by John Smithwick."" I'll bet if John had one of these, he would be pissed to have his name on the label."
"light sweetness up front, sting sizzle pop carbonation in the middle and soft lingering malts to finish. Reminds me of something Gordon Biersch would make, forgettable for the most part."
"Musings: Bought a 12 pack of this because of a SPD sale. It's drinkable, but I won't be going back anytime soon."
"Aroma is dissapointingly light. Just a light malty aroma but nothing really jumping out at me. Taste is more of the same with a fairly light mouthfeel. Not a ton of flavor, just a bit of malt and grain with a smooth flavor front to back. Nothing jumping out or off balance. Finishes fairly dry. I was expecting more malty flavor from an Irish Ale. This one is a bit light on flavor and a somewhat overly dry finish."
"Cheers!"
"The mouth feel is light in body and moderately carbonated."
"Over all Smithwick's is an okay beer. Other reds I've had seem a little sweeter. Still goes down easy and is quite drinkable. I'd probably say it would be a good session beer, maybe good for the golf course."
"First time I have had this style I hope there are better ones out there."
"I bought this in a 6-pack at a local store which occasionally has a few imported-beers of note. Would I buy this beer at a bar? Yes, probably-- but if they had this to offer, they'd probably be offering others that would tempt me more greatly."
"Appearance was dark brown/amber w/ a good sized head and nice, consistent lacing. Not much to speak of as far as smell goes, but it is sligthly sweet, as is the taste. Spikes of smoky caramel touch the taste buds. I found the mouthfeel totally enjoyable -- definitely a beer I could drink all night. I actually tried this for the first time from a Chili's that was offering 2-fers...I got one Guinness, and one of these. Guinness is one of my favs, but I took an immediate liking to Smithwick's. This won't blow anybody away, but it's a totally enjoyable beer and I hope it continues to become popular here in the states."
"I guess this is the new In beer for our area; it's popping up in all my usual hangouts. After tasting it, I'm not impressed. It""s a dark amber color with a thick white head and some nice lacing. It had a weak toasty odor, and tasted of grain with some slight hoppiness. I really didn't appreciate much flavor. An average beer."
"As far as beers go, this one struck me as very unimpressive to look at. As soon as I poured, i was overcome by the head, which at one point was about half the glass. The color is a maple amber, crystal clear, and with tons of carbonation on the sides and bottom of the glass. It looked more like a root beer, or maybe a food-colored macro. The head only looked pleasant once it had died down to about half a centimeter, and actually left a good deal of lace. The smell was metallic off the bat, although I was able to uncover some hidden honey malts with a touch of hops, after some searching. The taste was a bit watery, although this would probably be the strongest point of the beer. It is unimpressive on the front of the pallate, but it divulges a few malty flavors on the back, released by the carbonation. Mouthfeel is high in carbonation, and watery. Drinkable, fine for a round or two, but you wont see me drinking the night away with this."
"This pours a dark ruby color with a smallish head. The smell has a slight malt aroma,but it is pretty weak. The taste is all malt sweetness with a slight hop presence. The m/f is light and pretty well balanced,but this is just an average beer at best."
"Pours a dark amber with a nice fluffy head that recedes to a spotty lace. Smells malty, grainy, and like buttered biscuits. Taste is very heavy on the malts with a toast-like finish. Feels thin in the mouth. Not a bad beer, but not one I would pay my hard earned money for. If it was free I would gladly accept though."
"Fairly drinkable, brown/red ale. Maybe not the best example of the style, but still a good beer."
"EDIT: I let the beer warm up some more after my initial comments, and found the caramel character to be more evident (and more enjoyable.) I bumped up my score to reflect this, but I still don't think this is a beer to scream from the rooftops about."
"Decent drinkability, but overall not too impressed. A beer that pours way better than it drinks"
"This beer really did not live up to my expectations. I thought it would be a lot better. It is the color of iced tea. There is a decent sized head. The smell is similar to a light beer. The taste could use some improvment. There is quite a bite to it. I will not buy this again. There are much better options for red beer than this."
"This seems to be slightly different, less flavorful and more carbonated, than I remember having it while on an Ireland trip a few years ago."
"The taste is a mix of malt and faint hops....not at all exciting nor complex but certainly not offensive. I'll let my next bottle get closer to room temp and if there are any noteworthy changes in my opinion of this brew, I'll edit my review. As it stands now, this just lacks the flavour that I was hoping for in a UK session ale. Too bad."
" Not a good first pint for any country in my opinion. I probably won't be sampling this again any time soon. Not recommended."
"Not bad, makes a decent session beer, but not the tastiest one. Good caramel flavor with decent drinkability. Recommended."
"Pours a deep amber-red with a reddish tinged head that builds to about one finger before dissipating fairly quickly and leaving little lacing. Smells of caramel and coffee, with malts and sweetness apparent. Taste is a bit medicinal, with the caramel muted by a phenolic overtone that puts a damper on the taste. Mouthfeel is a bit flat, with slight carbonation. Drinkability is solid, but not that impressive."
"This is pretty good, seems to go well with pub grub and other heavy British Isles food."
"Overall: A pretty typical ale; not bad, but nothing to write home about."
"Lovely amber color. Good clarity. Fruity, slightly hoppy nose. Initial mouthfeel was very full, malty, lots of nonfermentable sugar feel... but then finished as a clear amber lager. A good session beer, one I'd like to stock up on if the price is right."
"Pours a bronzish copper with good clarity. Two light tan fingers of dense bubbles retain well and leaves some stubborn patches of lacing. Lightly toasted pilsener and caramel in the nose. There's also a whiff of hops that seem both noble and citrusy. Nice blend of crystal malt sweetness and pilsener spice, but the malt profile is still lacking for the style. The citrus and faint noble hop aftertaste dominates the flavor with no herbal taste detectable. Airy body is light but not thin; and a high level carbonation keep a crisp mouthfeel, but it retains some texture without becomeing diacetyl. Finishes mostly clean, but more like an APA."
"Deep garnet/mahogany in color, no real head to speak of. Nose is a little too subtle, metallic peat with a hint of smoke. Flavor is even more subtle - metallic bitterness, and a hint of smoked bread. Mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. Another underwhelming brew from the British Isles. Sadly, in my experience they tend to be watered down and lacking in character. Nothing that I'd particularly seek out again, though it made an adequate substitute for water with my meal."
"This beer came amber brown with slight reddish hue. Smelled of sweet and dry sour malts, a bit like bleached flour. Tasted of a good smokey sour malt, a bit of molasses and a nice sour coffee finish. There was a nice combo of sharp contrasts in the flavor between the smooth brown ale-like malt and a sharp hops. Mouth feel was medium bodied, slick and creamy. Nice flavor in this beer. Very smooth with a nice assertive flavor. Ill look for this one again."
"The flavor can best be described as delicious, lighter in flavor than most beers of this color and at only 4.5% alcohol you can go ahead and put a couple of these back."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but nothing special. I can't say I'll ever have another."
"Take your time and enjoy this one! I bet it goes really well with a porterhouse with carmalized onions and some buttery greens."
"D: This would be an excellent session beer -- nothing to slow you down, no overt complexity, just nice taste and relatively low ABV. For what it is, it's pretty decent. If it's available, have a couple, but don't go out of your way to find and get some."
"I enjoyed this beer very much though I've had better. Nevertheless, I found this beer to be delicious and satisfying."
"This Irish Ale is dark red/brown in color and pours with a rich, thick head. A high level of carbonation creates a sparkle of effervescence on the tongue. A crisp, somewhat astringent, hoppiness characterizes this beer, along with a rich, mid-palate malty sweetness. Notes of harvest apples, spice, and molasses make way for a lingering, sweet aftertaste."
"everyone sitting with me at my table tried this and everyone (non-beer drinkers included) was very impressed. This is now my go-to beer!!!!"
"This beer is good overall. It's not a very strong irish ale, like george killians, but it is a different kind of beer. It's a bit thick, but not guinness extra stout, a bit sweet. Appearance and smell are better than average. all in all a pretty good beer. i would drink it again."
"I could drink Smithwick's daily, it is one of my favorite Irish imports. Do yourself a favor and try this one out."
"Drinkability  The drinking experience was rather uneventful, but theres nothing here that will activate your gag reflex."
"Not too bad. Left a strange aftertaste though. I don't see myself buying again."
"This beer poured a reddish copper orange color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head was pure white in color, semi-dense and thick but not long lasting, it fell quickly to just a ring on the edges. No lace seemed to be present. The aromas were fairly simple malts, lots of caramels, light hops and a creamy fresh butter tones. The tastes were much like the aromas - caramels, malts, seemed there were more hops present in the taste then the nose, seemed some sweetness slips in and out bitter cocoa semed present on the swallow then ended up with a grainy taste. The body was on the light side. An OK beer, but if you get a chance to try other Irish reds I would suggest doing so. Decent, stands up, but not really noticed."
"A decent session beer if nothing better, but there were plenty of things better at the bar where I had this. The Mac & Jack's amber I had before this would be a far better choice for session drinking."
"Tasted very average. Creamy and smooth, but just lacking. I would buy it for the nostalgic value, not for the taste. Man I wish I could travel back in time and have that beer in Kilkenny..."
"Pours dark amber with 2 fingered beige head. A little lace. Light sweet malt aroma. Medium body and dextrinous mouthfeel. Flavors malt and caramel and earthy hops in the finish. Not what you expect from an Irish Ale. Makes you wonder what changes it has undergone since its ownership by Guinness."
"Swithwick's Ale pours to a beautiful, deep ruby red color with a thick white head that eventually fades and a moderate to soft amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is wonderful with lots of soft sweet malty aromas, paired with flowery hops, and light touches of plummy estery fruit. The palate is soft and buttery, with lots of good sweet malt flavors, biscuity malt, a touch of caramel, and undertones of ripe estery fruit that just glide over the palate. This beer finishes with more malt and fruit up front, then ends with just a slight bit of grassy hop bitterness, to balance the sweet and fruity flavors that linger."
"Pours deep amber with a huge, long lasting, brownish, frothy head with fair amount of lacing. Some Smokiness and slight caramel flavor upfront that giveaway to a dry finish. Nothing overpowering or heavy. Goes down smooth. Overall a good beer, but nothing that stands out."
"Smithwick's, which I gather has just recently been launched in the US, is an odd-looking beer. It's a diluted dark brown color, with a huge head full of random, enormous bubbles. It looks like sourdough bread or swiss cheese. Smells malty, with some smoked and buttery diacetyl undertones. Tastes surprisingly good, smooth and malty with a pronounced smoked character that I did not expect. I have no idea how this compares to the Smithwick's served elsewhere, but the label design is different and my girlfriend claims the version she got in Ireland was much better."
"Overally, this brew is very easy to drink, refreshing, and not bad. However, for $3.75 a pint, I'd pass on another to be quite honest."
"Appearance, was this beers strong suit, poured a nice amber, with a frothy meringue-like head, that left broken puffs all the way down the glass, smell was rather vague, sweet malty aroma, dried fruit perhaps, taste waspleasant, rather weak, unsweetened tea-like taste, very light, and slight hop dryness, but a nice beer on a warm day, as it is here right now, Mouthfeel, is light bubbly,smooth. Drinkability: is average, not bad, but not that great either, good session brew, because of the low abv, you could probably drink this till ""the cow's come home""....if you are so inclined."
"This beer was hoppier than what I expected, but since I'm a hophead, that's a good thing. I ordered this beer thinking I was just getting something better than the everyday macros, and I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this one."
"Brought it back home from Pazzo's in Lexington (Plug for Pazzo's! Yay!) It is deep brown in color with a strong red tint. It would be a lot better looking if the head hung around for more than 0 seconds, but hey. Smells very sweet (in a fruity way) and yeasty. Not too complex, but rather refined in its simplicity. The taste is surprisingly subtle and fades rather quicky. As expected from the nose, there is a sweet yeasty taste, the aforementioned fruit being drowned out. It finishes with a dry, grassy taste. Normally, I'd prefer more carbonation than this, but somehow, this beer pulls it off without much at all. A very nice beer."
"There is supposedly some story that Smithwicks couldn't be sold in the US for a number of years due to a non-compete with Bass? Makes sense; this is a superior product to Bass. Also, I am told it's pronounced ""Smitticks""."
"This was a bottled offering that I had to try, I have had draft and enjoyed that. Pours a deep red with a full off white head. There is malt in the nose but no hop bitterness, what is an irish red ale anyway. The flavor was malt driven, although light, some bitterness is present, no hops detected. The bitterness does linger after the malt goes away, this one finishes dry and bitter."
"Pours a reddish brown, with an cream coloured head. Faint caramel in the nose, along with some diacetyl. Taste wise, nothing stands out, but nothing offends. A very safe beer. Some caramel, grain and a little hops. A step above most national brands. Crisp, medium bodied."
"Appearance is red amber with lots of fluffy foam that produces sticky lacing. Aroma has brown sugar and malt, butter (diacetyl) and few hops. Initial taste contains notes of roasted barley, sweet malt, toffee, a touch of bitter hops, and reminds one of Killians. Body is thin and watery, carbonation needs a booste. Finish is unsatisfying, leaving the tongue wondering where the flavor went."
"Smithwick's Ale is what the horticulturally-inclined might call a garden variety Irish red ale. It looks pretty good (even though a little red would provide some needed visual interest), but it can't back it up with regard to the other senses. My sense is that there are much better examples of the style and that this one is skippable."
"Draft at Ship & Anchor in Sandy Springs, GA."
"The taste was fantastic, very rich with a slight malt taste. Very sweet subdued after taste. In all a great beer. I am kind of partial to this beer however, I would take a Smithwick's anyday!"
"A much better Irish Red than the Killian's that I drank the night before. Looks like Coca Cola with nice ruby and orange highlights. Has great head retention. Smells malty sweet and herbal. No reall hop detection. Tastes toasty sweet, slightly biscuity, caramelly, and malty. Round mouthfeel, but not heavy. Finish is malty and tacky to the palate. Never detected much hop character, just enough to offset the sweetness."
"I thought the draught version of this beer was a little better than Killian's, but the bottled version? Not so much. Dark amber with a medium beige head. The lacing is sticky and thin. Light malt aroma. Medium-bodied with flavors of malt and caramel. The finish is hoppy but not very flavorful. I can take it or leave it."
"A pretty average example of the style, all around. Did pour a nice, glowing amber with an impressive head. Aroma was muted, with some vague malt. Seemed a bit underweight - all along I had the impression that the beer needed more malt substance. Mouthfeel was on the thin side. A bit of tartness and some caramel, but not all that much. A snoozer."
"Clear copper with a great, billowy cream colored head and lots of lacing. Smell is pretty weak. A little caramel biscuit can be detected along with some mild hop. Taste isn't too bad. A tad watery on the palate, though very smooth. Tastes like a bit of sweet caramel, very light, some biscuity malt, and a faint hop bitterness. I wanted something light tonight, but this goes a bit too far in its wateriness. Certainly nothing offensive about it though."
"This surprised me. I wasn't expecting much as I am not a fan of this style in general, but for being an easy to find mass-appeal bottled beer, it's not too bad."
" I have already purchased 12 bottles of this beer and began to share it with my friends. Enjoyed very much."
"Decent at best, taste mass-produced and to light on the palate. Many American brewers make a better Irish style red ale."
"Overall-this beer got off to a great start then turned rather adequete and plain in the end. Seeing as Guinness now produces it, it may be the ingreadiants have been changed, or perhaps it was always like this. Regardless, this is a decent Irish Red that is passable and true to the style...nothing more."
"I never new this was available in a bottle until today and I must say, I liked it better out of the bottle compared to the taps I've had at two places. Solid amber pour with a thin off-white head that faded into a mill but held and laced all the way down. Very malty and sweet on the nose, made my mouth water almost instantly (good). Brutally smooth and crisp, malts through-and-through with a hoppy sting on the finish. Very drinkable."
"I'll have to experiment and post my results."
"Slightly too much carbonation in the taste but a very nice brew, smooth and easy to drink, refreshing."
"Biscuity, bready, maltiness in the nose. A very well balanced, smooth, taste with a thin but crisp mouthfeel. I must admit that I like this beer even though I had serious doubts. I could chug several of these down after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day."
"Good, but nothing special."
"Pours a deep amber color with a nice cascading effect, ending in a half-inch creamy head. Nose is kind of funky, like a cheap American adjunct lager - a little bit of sweet malt, but mostly skunkiness/garbage. The taste is a little smoky up front, with a bit of a phenolic quality. Overall, it's bitter, but not from the hops - maybe the tap lines haven't been cleaned in a while. Mouthfeel is good, rich and creamy. Not the most drinkable beer, but it goes down easier after a while."
"This beer pours a clear amber with a nice off-white head... has a good head retention and leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroma is lacking, with slight notes of toasted malt, and not much else. Flavor is ok, but fairly bland. Notes of caramel and a light bitterness. Over carbonated for the style... fizzed up like a soft drink. While this beer has a strong reputation, I find it difficult to believe that it hasn't suffered at the hands of Diageo. If you're looking for an Irish Red, you could do much better."
"Too bad they have been bought by Guinness which has since been bought by Diageo. I drink this every now and then and have noticed a decrement in quality."
"Makes do, but nothing much more than that."
"Drinkability: Very. I'm not crazy about red ales, but this is one that I have a hard time passing up."
"Lots of carbonation in this one. Overall a good drink that could be a bit more complex."
"If you like Irish Red, you would be better off going for a Beamish Red or a Porterhouse Red, if you happen to be near a Porterhouse."
"Somewhat reddish/amber color. Nice,slightly tan head. Low aroma-slight malt smell with a touch of toasted malt. Malty flavor. Very low hop bitterness. Nice residual malt sweetness. Good enough body for style and to balance with flavor. A decent enough beer-probably a good session beer. Lacking a few intangibles that would make this a better brew."
"Had on tap at Galvin's Public House in Chicago. Not a very impressive looking ale. The head on this beer is an oddish white color. Color is red. A little bit of lacing that doesn't seem too sure of itself. Not much smell, a little fresh fruit and/or tea leaf. Taste is pretty unobtrusive and inoffensive. Clean with a little hop aftertaste. Malts don't do much, which is too bad. Overall this is an okay session beer, which I occasionally end up having one too many. Bad pick-up lines to follow..."
"I like red ales in general, so maybe that made me like this beer more than dislike it. However, when it came out of the tap it had almost no head at all, and that was unimpressive. The taste was bitter and fruity, with a pretty smooth feel. It's definitely drinkable because of the pretty good taste, but after a while I could see myself getting tired of it. I'd rank this beer in the middle of the pack."
"The best part about this beer, by leaps and bounds, is its beautiful deep, dark amber color. Gorgeous in the glass with a short white head that leaves lacing up and down the sides. Smells lightly of alcohol and grain; not altogether offensive, but (the horror) almost reminds me of certain American pale lagers. Tastes first of caramel, then of grain, and finally thin, fizzy bitterness. For all its color, finishes bone dry with a tragically meager mouthfeel. Not an offensive beer -- often the best thing available at ""Irish"" pubs that only serve macros -- but I wouldn't seek it out where better beers are available."
"Drinkability: It is good one, but nothing for selling my soul to the devil. :)"
"For sure, its a good-looking brew: a dark burnt-amber colored liquid, very clear, with a beautiful frothy white head. Not much aroma at alla little grain and a bit of caramel, and all very faint. Almost no hops in the aroma at all. The body was notably thin, which seemed notable even before the taste. A bit of malt, but very understated. Very quiet finish. This beer really didnt do anything for me."
"Taste is dominated b a bready crisp maltiness with some underlying hops to offset the sweetness. That's about it for the flavor, very straightforward beer. Lightly bitter aftertaste and a bt thin in the mouth. Easy drinker but somehow doesn't put it all together to be anything distinctive."
"One of the best Irish Red's I've had, though I do recall having a bottle of one some time ago and it not being half as good which is probably a result of it not being a hot seller around me. I recommend checking for freshness before purchasing bottles."
"Sweet caramel malts up front, buttery cream in the middle of the sip and then a watery seltzer finish. What happened? This beer started out okay, but finishes on a weak note. Too bland for a true Irish Red. This is not something I see myself drinking again."
"I must say I was disappointed it what was my first ""true"" Irish Red. The color of this brew is almost beyond desciption - a fantastic, clear, ruddy-orange that had a metallic, copperesque quality. Nice 1"" cream colored head of tight foam with very clingy, slow lace. The nose was very shy, offering a hint that there is body to the beer. Its even - too even - and mildly sweet, some malt, like the nose its shy. Throat was clean with some subtle citrus, but otherwise an uneventful brew that didn't hold its true ""colors"". Too bad, because it was beautiful to look at. I guess personality does count...LOL."
"Disappointingly, blah at best, I doubt I will purchase again, unless for St. Patrick's Day events."
"The draft pour was wonderful: dark mahogany brown with an excellent brown head that laced all the way down. Just a lite malt/ grainy aroma and taste, but not too heavy for a spring day before the baseball game. Great body with this one, perfectly carbed, only had two but it left me wanting more. I will look for this one at *Irish* bars."
"This is sooo much better than Harp. Smittik's is a beer that you can drink more than a few of and still enjoy. There are no funny flavors and it is very well balanced Not too hoppy and not too sweet. I will definitely pick up a couple of sixers to keep around for a cool refresher during the Hazy Hot and Humid Jersey Summers. Is it me, or is Harp becoming hard to find?"
"Very pleasant to drink brew. Complex enough to keep your attention, but never harsh. An excellent choice for a session beer."
"Pours out to a dark amber / brown colour with a long lived, dense white foamy head. No real odor to speak of, kind of a stale smell, with a touch of maltiness detected. The flavor left quite a bit to be desired, as it comes off as plain, bland and generally mediocre. I'd prefer a cheaper Irish Red any day, but this may be up your alley, as it's very smooth, and goes down well. Worth a try."
"Mouthfeel was thin and smooth. Very slight dry aftertaste. Drinkability is slightly better than average, mostly because it is unoffensive and sports a simple taste."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. Pours an amber/red color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma wasn't very nice. Hard to describe, but I didn't like it much. The flavor has a bit of caramel character and some slight sweetness, but I just didn't care much for the flavor of this one. It's not bad, but it's not great either."
"From notes. This beer poured a slightly brown, deep amber color wtih a 2 finger head that falls slowly. Ther ewas a slight caramel malt in the nose, but also a sweetness that didn't sit well with me. I think it was from corn. There was a touch of hops, but nothing really grabbed me and said it smelled nice. The flavor was slightly spicey in the hop and slightly caramel on the malt, but overall, I was not all that impressed with it. The feel was light and watery with a light carb. All around lacking. The beer was easy drinking and smooth, but taking all the other qualities into account, I was not all that impressed."
"Slàinte!"
"This beer's taste is by far its best quality. Other than the nice red kick, there's not a whole lot of characteristics that really stand out."
"Finally decided to try this when I found a single. The beer appears dark amber with a sudsy white head and large bubbles. The aroma is plain, I would probably think it was a German lager blindfolded. The flavor is fairly clean with a little graininess. Mildly malty with possibly a faint roasted flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but highly carbonated and a little astringent. Overall its an OK Irish Red that sure beats the artificial Irish Red that is made by you know who. Still not too intersting in my opinion."
"On tap poured into a Smithwick's tulip pint glass. It pours a deep amber color with two fingers of head. Just a touch of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very light. There's some caramel maltiness, but not much else going on. The taste is very very sweet. Lots of pale maltiness with caramel flavors and just the slightest bit of hops. The mouthfeel is decent, and the drinkability is fairly nice. Just your average Irish Red Ale."
"This here is an excellent session ale and it goes great with Irish food."
"This one pours out to a very, dark amber in the glass with a good-sized head. The aroma is of malt and bread dough. The taste is good, with a nice maltiness giving way to a light sweetness. More flavor than typical amber offerings in this class. This one screams ""session"" as I could see having several of these at a time."
"The beer decamps the 12-ounce brown bottle a pellucid brown with a substantial frothy light tan head that after its decomposion leaves thick layer of lace to surround the glass. Nose is sweet and a touch earthy, nice caramel tone also noticed, fresh and crisp, a nice lightly sweet start that is nicely malted and the top light and gentle on the palate. Finish is modest in its acidity with the hops delicate and the aftertaste dry, nice to see it here in bottles although fresh from the tap is my choice for sampling this nice session beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and a tad creamy with healthy carbonation. Fills the mouth well. Drinkability is good...as it goes down easy...however this is not something I'd regularly go far."
"Sampled at local beer distributer at Thursday night tastings. Poured an attractive copper color with enormous long-lasting head. Smell was non-existent. Taste was so smooth I felt I wasn't even drinking a beer. Probably would appeal to a Coors Light fan"
"The appearance is exceptional, certainly, a nice mellow brown color with a medium white head that sticks around for a good long time. But other than that I was amazed at how bad this beer managed to be. Better than macro-swill, but only very slightly so. I'd rather go with just about any Leine's or Michelob brew for less money, or spring for a real Irish like Beamish or Guiness Extra Stout (never been a fan of the Draught)."
" Pours a nice, reddish-brown color, with a very slight white head. Subtle malty odor. The flavor is also quite malty, with a subtle hint of hops providing some bitterness. The flavors in this beer seem to blend together nicely; nothing is too overpowering. Incredibly drinkable- Smithwicks goes down very easily, and has become my new favorite session beer in the multitude of Irish pubs around here that are usually top-heavy with macros."
"Writing this review has my mouth watering for beer...work needs to end soon."
"I did not realize this was considered a red ale until looking on this website. Looked much darker in a smoky bar last night and felt heavier on the stomach, reminded me a porter. Therefor, this loses some points in comparsion to other reds. A good balance of hops and malts and drinkable enoght o enjoy two in a row."
"I wanted so much to like this. I found it unremarkable in the extreme. For an ale, this is actually a decent light lager. See also: ""Lawson Creek Red Ale""."
"Not a bad session style beer more along the lines of a mild...subtle in every aspect....nothing I would seek out but I wouldn't turn it down either.."
"Overall impression: All in all a nicely drinkable beer. Nothing too outstanding, but a decent choice if you want an easy drinker."
"The beer completed the fish and chips nicely--has more body than the Harp lager also on tap at the pub, but is less filling than Guinness stout which has, of course, a nice taste but is rich and heavy, especially eating fried food along with it. During happy hour the special was buy one get one on draught pints, so I had two and the drinkability was good, with the smoothness shing through the most."
" Drinkability: Not bad. Enough character to make it interesting and slightly unique, but not too heavy. I could drink several of these in a sitting."
"A huge letdown versus the draft sample."
"I will agree that the relatively high carbonation hurts drinkability. Hopefully pub managers on these shores will learn to dial down C02 pressure and ease up on the chilling to give this baby the presentation it deserves."
"Alright, today is 20 Feb and I have had another one of these things. This really is terrible. I think I was extemely generous in giving this stuff a 3.something or other for an overall rating. If Sprite made a beer, this would be it. WAY too carbonated."
"Given to me by Mark at 3 Corners."
"Pours a dark amber color and has a frothy white head that leaves a ton of lace. The aroma is of caramel and a touch of hops is in there too. The flavor is a bitter hop bite up front and a nice smooth ale character in the middle followed by a hoppy, dry finish. More proof that our friends on the other side of the pond can brew some groovy beer. I could definitely drink this all night and not get bored."
"The beer pours a reddish/amber color with a creamy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry slightly malty scent that boasts of pale and bit of crystal malts along with some hops to boot. The taste is decent also. Again, it is slightly malty with a dry finish, but the hops stand out a bit more as it's quite bitter. It goes down easy, but seems a tad watery fro my tastes. I guess that's the Irish style. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied brew with good carbonation. This is a fine Irish ale. I wish it had a little more malt character, but it fits the style just fine; a good drinker."
"Darker red in color, small off-white head. Smell is maltcentric, slightly roasted. Hops are not a big part of this beer in any stretch of the imagination. Taste is full and sweet, but has some depth to it provided by the nice malt and slight hop presence. Fairly good beer, nothing I would seek out again, there are tons of better reds out there."
"Smithwick's is a very dark red-amber color with a pure white head. I was impressed as to how balanced this beer was between maltiness and hoppiness. The malty flavor wins out here slightly. A very warming beer, caramel-like malts make it very satisfying."
"Didn't expect to be blown away by this, especially after reading some other reviews, and overall I wasn't. However, this is great for what it is - a light, flavorful beer that doesn't demand too much of the taster - somewhat lower in ABV and wonderful for a session beer."
"This practically has ""session ale"" written all over it. I suppose those looking for an Irish beer that isn't a stout will enjoy this. Nothing groundbreaking, but still rather enjoyable."
"Garnet in color with an off white head which left a fair amount of lacing. Nice malt and mineral aroma coming off this beer, with very little hops. The flavor is malt dominated ranging from sweet to toffee and then roasted, with a bitter finish to balance. Nice carbonation and body. This is perhaps the best of the three Irish reds Ive had, with more body and richer malt character than Murphys or Killeans."
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer. I'd not go out of my way for it, but it's much better than many of the ""standards"" you find on tap. I'll drink it again."
"Moderate of both body and carbonation. This is a session beer all the way. Not a bad choice."
"Not bad, but I'd find other first."
"Taste was well balanced, with a sweet malt backbone and a kiss of herbal hops bitterness. Crisp and refreshing, with biscuity malt and a lot less hopping than the American red ales I've grown accustomed to. Very enjoyable, particularly with the deli's signature dish of grilled shrimp and asparagus salad."
"Outstanding! I've had this on tap and in bottle.Perfect appearance with a long lasting head and clear dark amber color.Bubbling carbonation and spotty lacing. Very Refreshing crisp mouthfeel and well-balanced with just the right bitterness and malt flavors.Perfect when are not in the mood for Guinness,Harp,or Bass.Highly drinkable again refreshing.Aroma could be more distinctive.This could easily become a staple beer for me.Medium bodied with a sweet malt finish."
"Hearing this selection was an Irish Red, I was surprised when a tall dark pint appeared at my table, almost as dark as a Guinness, but with significantly larger bubbles of carbonation. The aroma was somewhat mild, but a toasty note came through. As for the taste, it again was somewhat mild nice flavors of coffee, toasted nuts and caramel with just a touch of a bitter burnt chocolate. All in all, a very drinkable beer, and a few pints will go down quite easy. That being said, its also isnt one to get overly excited about nice, but not memorable."
"Had this one on tap at some Irish pub in SF. Nice creamy head with an amber body to it. The taste was creamy as well. Had hints of malts and light fruits. The taste was almost like a beer with cream in it. The mouthfeel was creamy as a result of the taste. It also coated the mouth fairly well and held a nice aftertaste. It was very refreshing and made it easy to pound a few down in no time. Give it shot if you like Wexford or Belhaven's Best."
"So glad I took the salesman's advice on trying out this wonderful brew."
"Drinkability is a average with this overall average beer."
"I gotta say this wasn't all that bad. A nice example of a session brew. Wouldn't mind having this in my rotation once in a while."
"I will update next time I get it either bottled or on tap."
"Appearance: Light caramel amber tone with an almost white cream head forms nicely leaves fine lacing behind, not bad. Aroma: Pale malt sweetness with some residual caramel notes as well tame floral hops seems light and airy overall. Taste: Flowery hops light caramel malt sweetness blend nicely very balanced and unoffensive as a whole finishes slightly earthy for me. Mouthfeel: Medium to light in body evenly carbonated can't complain too much. Drinkability: Very sessionable not too watery but not flavorful enough for me, I enjoyed it in Canada when throwing darts and drinking in bars with little or no beer selections glad to see it made it's way back to the States."
"-All in all not bad, but certainly nothing to write home about either. Might make a good black and tan though."
"Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. Perfect for a quiet night out of rest and relaxation. It's smoothness ensures it goes down very well but I wouldn't recommend it as a drink to be taken with a meal due to the fact that it is quite a filling ale. Nonetheless, as an Irish man, I can't help but feeling proud of this crowning ale."
"Well I have been enjoying Smithwicks for the past few months and guess I have forgotten to review it! It has really taken off in the Albany NY area, can find it on tap at a lot of restaurants and is available for growler fills at both Glenmont and Olivers beverage centers. With this said I got a growler the other day and must say that this is a nice brew. It pours to a nice deep copper color with a fantastic light tan head that has fair retention and good lacing that sticks nicely for about half of the glass. The aroma is of a nice balanced brew, stronger on the malt side with highlights of caramel that seems to go along with the sweet smell. The taste of this brew goes along with the aroma, solid flavor and the sweetness that I sensed in the aroma goes well, definitely not over powering! This is a great session brew, one that I could enjoy for an entire evening. Also see that this brew has been able to bridge the gap for some friends that are usually macro drinkers."
"Again a cleas mouth feel and easy going down. Good for more then one."
"This is a pretty typical English/Irish ale. Its got a similar flavor to the stuff like Boddingtons and Bass, but it doesnt have a lot of flavor. Very slight hops, a bit of estery fruitiness and a touch of malt. Its easy drinking, but also very forgettable."
"Priced at the premium import range, this would be a tough beer to turn to. Nothing wrong with it at all, I would probably have more of in were I drinking it somewhere localy. A nice IR ale, does well and it's like Guinness to produce something as easy drinking as this."
"Not the best beer I've ever tried, but a fine brew nonetheless. It will always hold a special place in my heart, and I owe it thanks for setting me on the path to beer righteousness."
"Drinkability: Easily enjoyed and one of the best session ales I've ever had. It's great to have it widely available on draft in the States. If only it's price were on par with US macros, I think this could develop a real following."
"Had not seen much of this in the USA before I glanced at the taps after I entered Kells Irish pub in Portland. So while me and the wife waited for a tabel I ordered one. Very attaractive clear brown beer with a lovelly off white frothy head. Nice aromas of slighly roasty malts. Not a bad tasting Irish Ale at all..smooth and malty with a small hint of hops, maybe a littel toffeeish taste too. Its sort of average on the palte, maybe on the ""lager"" side of thin. Overall a nice session ale for watching ""footie"" on the big TVs."
"Clear nutbrown, red colour topped by a thin lace of light tan/cream-coloured head. The aroma was nutty and had a definite caramel quality, but little to no hop presence. Nuttiness carried into the flavour and light, fruity esters were present. Malt sweetness was nicely balanced by hop bitterness, but there still wasn't a lot of flavour character from the hops. The finish was clean and slightly bitter. Medium body and medium/high carbonation that was more evident towards the finish."
"Taste: very smooth, with a small drizzle of hops, and larger helping of malt. Feels slick, caramelly, easy to toss back, just enough flavor, but not really enough to make it more than a session ale..something to pass the time, without worrying the mind...who's up for darts?"
"A nice ale to have as a session beer, or when hanging around the pub with some friends."
"Brownish red ale. Nutty caramel nose. The taste is caramelic and hoppy, excellent balance between malt and hops actually. Great nutty bitterness. Very well done simple and light ale. Surprisingly decent as I'm not a fan of any irish beers that I know of."
"This was my first time trying this beer. It was quite popular in Ireland when I was there, but I chose to only drink Guinness and Baileys for the entire trip. Good to see it make it's way to the States."
"This beer pours an attractive brown amber, with a nice head. The smell is on the dull side. The beer has a deep caramel malt taste, followed by a quick hit of bitterness. It is a pleasant, although not overwhelming, taste. It is has a medium body, and I would say that overall it is quite palateable and drinkable."
"This reddish-brown ale poured a decent sustained head. Smell was a wee bit smokey. Taste was of caramel malts blended into a muted hop finish. Mouthfeel was decent and lively. This is an easy drinking beer, very enjoyable."
"I think I have found a new Irish session beer. I think it is better than Harp and Killians. Not real ""exciting"" in any particular category, but pretty solid in balance and appearance. I'm planning to go to Portland, ME on business this week and will seek this one out on draught at Brian Boru's or RiRa's--I wonder how it tastes?? Also, it will probably appeal to my business colleagues, who before traveling with me were pretty much wedded to Bud and Heineken (yuk!!). I'll purchase this one again."
"This beer poured a nice dark copper/brown color with a slightly off white head. Aroma is malty with a slight hint of smoke. Not a very assertive nose. Flavor is very well balanced. Heavy malts press against a nice smokiness that becomes more prevalent as the beer warms. A tad bit of bitterness is to be found as well. It possess a medium body and I definately would nominate this as a decent session brew. Plus it's sweet enough to offer to your friends who can't stand hop bombs, although it won't be in my regular purchasing rotation."
"Pours a brown amber with a nice head, lacing is average at best. The smell is very nutty and of brown sugar, slight hints of molasses as well, the tate a little to scotch for my tasting, very sweet of brown sugar and molasses and no hop balance to blend with the sweetness, medium bodied and wouldn't recommend to anyone."
"I would call this a fairly boring beer. Move along and try something else"
"Pours a copper bronze color with lots of big bubbles and a long lasting creamy head. Theres plenty of lace on the glass. The aroma is of a yeast fruityness, pleasant diacytel (buttery), caramel and aroma hops. The taste is well balanced with a big dose of caramel malts, a distinct fruityness and herbal hops. Bittering hops are sparse. The mouthfeel is grainy. The finish isnt bogged down by the sweet malt flavors, very clean. overall this is a very good ale, and its available on tap in a lot of places too."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew."
"I heard that this is owned by Guinness, which must be why it seems to be popping up just about everywhere. Being owned by them doesnt seem to have impacted the quality much."
"We dropped by The Office in Morristown, NJ tonight and found this on tap. The ale came out a nice reddish brown with a matching head, it also was translucent. A very nice looking beer that added to the anticipation. The smell was light, with just a little bit of malt and alcohol in it. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. A very mellow malt flavor with a slight hoppy finish. It is medium with some carbonation. I found this to be a very pleasant experience and will have to make my way back to The Office to do a little more research on this one."
"My disclaimer: This beer is popular and in reading reviews, other BAs really enjoy it. I'm not sure what it is but maybe it's just not my cup of tea. Maybe I've been drinking too many bock style beers, stuff from Belgium, and big IPAs... who knows. Maybe it wasn't so good because I wasn't in Ireland while drinking it this time around. Regardless, I just wasn't impressed."
"Pours a garnet red with some brown highlights and a thick beige head that stays fluffy down to the bottom of the pint. Really kind of hard to pick on any aroma other than some weak, earthy malt and a dulled fruitiness, maybe a dash of cocoa. Weak, lightly toasted malt taste that is pretty enjoyable, dulled chocolate malt notes as it warms. Watery mouthfeel, probably around the same strength of Belhaven or Boddington's. Easily drinkable due to low ABV. This beer has some character, but lacks some at the same time. A touch acidic in its malt profile and a bit minerally in its water content."
"I had this on-tap at The Black Rose, an Irish pub in downtown Grand Rapids. I believe this is the only place in Grand Rapids where I could get this beer, so I had to try it out. The beer had a really dark amber color to it that turned copper when held to light. Small but steady tan head accompanied the beer. The smell seemed a bit weak and watery but I was surrounded by food. The taste was not watery at all though. This beer was much thicker in body and flavor than I had expected. There was a caramel maltiness upfront but it wasn't really sweet. Underneath that was a toasted grain flavor combined with a maple syrup taste. Little earthy hop pricks kept hitting my tongue but a full hoppiness was never relized. I believe this beer is only 3.9% abv and considered a session beer but I don't know if I could have too many of these. But it was still a solid beer."
"A lot of carbonation, a bit of malty taste. Did not go flat after an hour - robust. Some hops and a bitter bite aftertaste. Quench your thirst..then after that..You could do worse, its an easy summer drink. Carmel and mid-sip fruity taste, and carmel colour. Session beer."
"This is one of my dads favorites. He had it while on a trip to Ireland and has been raving about it ever sense. He will be glad to know its now available on this side of the pond!"
"Malt predominantes in the taste, with a slight backbite of hops underneath a silky mouthfeel and clean finish. Nothing terribly spectacular here, just a decent brew. I switched over to Guinness without trying another. Not bad."
"It may be my Irish beer of choice next time I return there."
"First sip reveals an average bodied beer with fine rolling carbonation. Flavor is not robust but is tasty. Some sweet malt flavors mix with the earthy hops that were present on the nose. As the beer warms the hops are more flavorful and dominant. Quite an easy drinking brew that rolls to my belly very smoothly."
"Clear darker amber appearance with a pale creamy head of excellent duration. Fat dripping rings for laces. Slight grain to the aroma, but not too much else to read in that department. Body is fine, the carbonation is done right, just enough to call it quaffable and creamy. The flavor just leaves me wanting something more to hang a hat on, very obvious pale caramel and powdery sugar to begin with, then a fade to black without much of any hop sense. There's nothing obviously wrong here, but the bottom falls out after the attractive looking pour."
"Pint glass presentation. Nice light tan head on dark amber brew, and laced excellently. Aroma and taste similar to that of Guinnes (which I have never been able to describe with words), but less intense. This is not so much a bad thing. Mouthfeel very good, and drinkability is excellent. Could and would be interested in drinking this more than once."
"Overall- a very good beer to have on tap alongside bud, miller, & coors!!!"
"We had a great night at Derry's Pub near Miller Park stadium in Milwaukee. Our group found this a good session beer for a mixed bunch of adventurous and less adventurous drinkers. While I like the beer I could not help think that Guinness is basically just filling in their line from a marketing perspective- Guinness, Smithwicks, Bass, Harp."
"Deep amber color in the glass with a decent beige head and lace. Roast malt and sweetness are the major tastes upfront. The brew then smooths in the mouth. Sweet malt smell. A hint of grass taste in the malty hazelnut finish. Smooth medium mouth. A solid session kind of beer."
"On tap. I was pleased to see this at a Macro ""pub"" close to my work. Something worth trying. Poured dark amber with a creamy white head. Nice Malty,earthy nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Malt, nutty and a bit of peat in flavor profile. This was a pleasant suprise, a dencent Irish ale, good session brew."
"Now available in many bars in the New York Metro area, I have had occasion to sample this ale a few times this past week. Wonderful taste, completely absent of any bitter aftertaste. There is a mild sweetness, can't describe the flavors... Great dark color, and a decent head. Very easy to drink, with mild effects the next morning. My absolute favorite beer."
"Nice to find Smithy's here in Greensboro at Mc'Couls Public House,pours a deep copper with some amber highlights with a pretty thin head.Aroma is roasted and very fruity with some big caramel notes,I also got a some doughy flavors in the background.Much more fruity than expected,I really liked this beer will become my staple when I go to that bar."
"Bottle: Poured a brownish looking beer with a nice bubbly head with standard retention. some notes of creamy and caramely taste. Overall, this is a very decent session irish ale but nothing out of the ordinary or too complex.Aroma is a mix of hops and sweetness. Taste is quite bitter with a dry finish and also has"
"when i was in ireland, i consistently heard this was an old man's beer, with guinness and kilkenny supposedly being the standard and younger-crowd beers, repsectively. i sampled it quite a few times over there just because you couldn't get it here at the time, and i must say that i thought it was a decent, albiet non-daring, brew. now that's it is being imported, i figured i'd give it another go. it pours a nice dark amber colour with a fluffy head that just looks rich and creamy. the smell and taste are pretty much the same: a bit sweet, a bit buttery, a bit creamy and a bit of caramel malt. it's quite an easy drinking brew that has a good amount of flavour while remaining pretty much as basic as you can get. this is a great session brew if you're looking for something simple."
"It was poured with a nice thick head that quickly dissipated. It was a dark amber in color, that was several shades darker towards the center of the glass. Kind of neat. It had a nice wood finish to the taste. It is a very well-rounded beer and allows for the drinker to taste the hops and a dark malty aftertaste."
"To be honest, I didn't go in thinking much of this, since it was a product from the Guinness/Bass/Harp people, but it honestly wasn't that bad at all. A nice bitterness on top of the malt kept them both fairly balanced for good drinkability, and this beer is certainly something that I could drink as a session brew."
"Had a pint of this at the local Irish pub. They were advertising it heavily so I stopped in to try it on tap. It pours a very nice amber with a good-sized, tannish head with decent amounts of lacing. There was little aroma to ale but the atmosphere was very smoky, which made it hard to smell the beer. The taste was average with a nice malty taste, little carbonation, and no bitterness. It had a decent feel in the mouth, but overall this is not a favorite. I actually think that I like Killian's better and that's not even Irish."
"Smithwick's was a dark amber color with a trace of copper. The head was insubstantial and there was no lace. The aroma was meek, a little caramelly with a slight floral bouquet. As for taste, there was not much happening. It was mellow, and dry with slight touches of caramel, coffee, a bit of sweetness, and a little hop bite. The finish was dryish and chalky. Overall I was disappointed. To me it was a bland beer."
"This beer is a rich brown yellow, not much in the way of red color. Dense creamy foam. Smells nice and sweet with something else I can't put my finger on. Very subtle. Taste is malty with no burnt or roasted notes, maybe a little chocolate. Tiny bit of hop bitterness. Tastes pretty darn good. Low carbonation. Does not taste water thin, but it's light. And goes down very easy. Great session ale"
"The hops possess a tea-like quality and just a hint of lemony citrus. It begins and finishes dry."
"Had a great frothy off-white head and some decent lacing. Ruddy amber in appearance. Hoppy nose with a base of sweetish malt. The malt in the flavour seemed a bit more grainy than on the aroma, balanced by a bitter hop finish, yet had an astringent aftertaste. Mouthfeel was full, everything seemed to be in its place, but this really didn't do anything for me, actually seemed pretty unremarkable for an amber. Now I remember why I hadn't tried this again after so many years."
"I've seen this at a couple of places where it seems suspiciously heavily promoted. I tried it on tap at O'Connor's, where it was served so cold my fingers ached on holding the glass. It had a pleasant amber color, but hardly any head, and only a faint scent of hops. It was too fizzy and cold for me; I could barely taste much but faintly sour hops. Only the prospect of having something else got me to finish this."
"Draught in Ireland: This one is a crystal clear amber color. A bit of a tight, white head. Somewhat sweet and malty taste, with just a hint of bitterness. What a real Irish Red tastes like!! I'm not sure if it tastes differently anywhere else, as I have only had it in Ireland. I'm interested if it is any different in the States."
"I used to drink this when there was nothing else in bars, but now i avoid it"
"A solid, easy drinking session pint. My guess is an irish red ale. Whatever it is, I was glad to have enjoyed a pint on a Sunday evening, in an irish style pub. Satisfying and delicious."
"Passing good, but not one I'd go looking for."
"Drinkability: Glides down pint after pint after pint."
"Reddish copper color with a big light tan head. Strange aroma that I can not quite place, not very interesting, maybe malt ,maybe hops hmm not sure. Light and malty with a hint of roast in the finish but then disappears.Not much happening here, it's finish is ever so slightly bitter and somewhat soapy. Not really recommended."
"No head to speak of with a nice deep amber color. Very smooth to drink with a clean aftertaste. Slight malt with a distinct carmalized hop finish. Not an extreme hop style but very smooth and easily drinkable brew. I really liked this brew."
"Slainte!"
"Notes of caramel and not too much hops. This is a very good Irish red ale and was so tasty it even took me away from Guinnes while I was there..."
"A fine looking dark tawney amber that has a very nice large off-white head with great lacing. The nose is light and provides subtle hints of understated caramel malt. The flavor is a musky, light affair with very subtle hops in the background. The feel is a soft, creamy, and uncrisp bit of wispy-ness. Good drinkability once you're used to the style."
"Other: I suspect we'll be seeing more of this in ""Irish"" pubs in the USA and Canada soon."
"After buying this in Ireland and carrying it 3000+ miles I noticed the best-by date was June 1999 so I had grave misgivings about even drinking but even with an ABV of only 4.0% it still had the sweet malty taste. Poured with a good head, some lace, malty nose, ruby amber color too bad it is only a 250ml bottle."
"Browner then amber in color with a handsome crown of off-white foam thats tall, thick, rich, and steady. Some patchy lace sticks but most of it drips back down. Smell is a dirty, musty, lightly roasty malts and grains. Taste is cleaner but I sense alot of grains, its got a touch of roastyness and light hops with a crispy finish. Quite empty in taste and feel, not impressed at all, was hoping for a bit more. Its a smooth and crisp refresher of a beer, but beyond that, yawn....."
"Notes: This might be the benchmark Irish Ale. I hadn’t had this in about 10-12 years, and it’s as good as I remember. I am extatic that this is available at the liquor store 2 blocks from my home. It remains an excellent example of an excellent style. If you see this beer….buy it! It is absolutely the cat’s pyjamas!"
"F."
"A well crafted ale. Not what I would consider a bitter, though. Poured into the glass smoothly with a large rushing head that dissipated after a minute or two. Slight rustic gold coloration, a 2 inch head and thin lace that creeps towards the bottom. Ahh, lovely smell. Smooth malt aroma and a spicy/bitter hop kick too wake up your nose. Now the taste. Hmm, sweet at first. Mild bitter aftertaste from the hops. Malt overpowers the taste, though the bitterness does try damn hard. Clean mouthfeel. Drinkable. A little sweet for it's style, but overall a very good, drinkable brew I shall purchase again."
"Out of the 2 traditional Irish ales I drink regularly -- Smithwicks and Killkenny -- the Smithwicks is one that can be had in larger quantities, but the creamy smoothness of Killkenny still calls my name more frequently than here. Having said that, don't shy away from Smithwicks as it too is a very good ale. Make that great ale!!"
"From Ireland's oldest brewery (1710, but now owned by Guinness) comes an impressive, well-made brew. There are several versions; this one is at 5.0% and exported to Canada. The bottle is embossed with the Arthur Guinness name and the metallic green label is in both English and French. It's a Deep brass/copper in color with excellent clarity and a surprising rocky off-white head that holds exceptionally well and leaves some nice lace. The nose expresses an earthy character with just a light touch of diacetyl - very English in nature! The body is medium, and quite smooth & creamy in the mouth (although the carbonation seems quite standard). The flavor starts gently fruity, then quickly displays some sweetish caramel malt as it warms along with some leafy hop character, and finishes dry with a long lingering soft and nutty caramel note and some residual earthiness. Really nicely balanced with a firm bitterness that supports the malt but never really comes forward. Full flavored, but also very drinkable."
"I spent 2 weeks in Ireland, and spent much of that time constantly looking for another pint of this wonderful ale. It's right alongside Guinness in every pub, but can't be found in the UK. I like it better than Bass. Although the Guinness is definitely better in Ireland than in the states, I had a hard time having anything but a Smithwick's. Like Guinness, the Irish version is far superior to the American version. I made the mistake of pronouncing the w in a smokey run-down local pub outside of Cork City the first time I asked for one. That's something you're sure to do only once."
"Full bodied ale but rather flat tasting and leaves you wanting more. May be an aquired taste as the more I sampled the more appealing it came to me. The colour is exceptional. This brew does have character in that it avoided a negative rating and I don't know how."
"On tap at the Tara Cross here in Ottawa.  Comes with a nice darkish red colour and off-white head.  Smooth taste of malts, but not overly heavy.  Certainly drinkable.  I have to say I prefer the nitro of Kilkenny, but this is certainly a fine beer."
"I reviewed this beer previously but had this on tap again in Canada this past weekend and it was not what I remembered. I was pleasantly surprised to find; a lovely, rich looking, dark amber ale with a creamy smooth tan head. Not an overly complex aroma though it's a welcoming one, exhitbiting that same inviting malty richness the color suggests. A smooth full mouthfeel is complimented by the well rounded, full malt/grain bill. A spicey hop character pokes through...maybe Challenger?? This is a standout brew in a sea of mediocre red ales. It did a fine job washing down a meal, though I could put down a few of these alone."
"I loved this beer when I went to Ireland. Great Irish Ale. Impossible to find in the States (they have an agreement with Harp and as long as Harp is here, no Smithwicks!) Smooth and amazing taste. Nice foamy head too."
"My first experience with Smithwicks was on the planes to and from Shannon.  It's nothing spectacular, but it's better than most Irish Reds.  I haven't seen it around many places in the States, but it's not a beer I'd go in search of anyhow."
