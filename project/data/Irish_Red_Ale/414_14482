Diamond Bear flat-out knows how to make kick-ass malt-forward and "balanced" beers and this is at the forefront. I don't know if this is a "true" Irish Red, but damn, it tastes so good!","EagleTalon","Feb 25, 2014"

2.94,-15.8,3,2.75,3,3,3,"Pours a crystal clear ruddy hue of amber; thin cap of foam s falls quickly. No notable aroma. Tastes rather bland, some caramel, watery cola, slight earthiness. Body was fairly thin on this, nothing exceptional whatsoever about this beer. Definitely an English style. Next.","youradhere","0"
3.4,-2.6,3.75,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served on-tap at the tap room at the brewery in a standard shaker. Pours a reddish, ruddy brown like a wet split piece of red cedar. The head is very minimal and dissipates in a flash, but carries a mildy orange hue to it. No lacing left on the glass. The smell is malt, like white bread (very little) and some maybe floral edge to the smell of the hops. The taste is pretty sweet overall; the 32 IBUs really don't show up very much. There is a little bit of a dry finish, but not much bitterness overall. Mouthfeel is a little watery, but not too bad. It's a fairly average beer, and I liked it overall; just nothing dramatic about it.","estlinska","Dec 24, 2012"

3.41,-2.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: Decent beer. Nothing special, but good flavor. A very suitable session beer, because of its continuously interesting, but mild, taste and fairly light body. I will drink it again.","BeerMeInMS","Apr 21, 2011"
3.3,-5.4,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"(12oz bottle courtesy of Fata!!). Pours clear mahogany with thin off-white head. Nice lacing and light carbonation. Aroma of dark caramel, jell-o chocolate pudding (?!), brownie, and biscuit. Taste is sweet and malt forward with light bittering hops. Medium bodied and oily texture. Pleasant bitter finish. Not bad for a style I generally don’t care for.","trappistlover","Dec 30, 2010"
2.91,-16.6,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"The mouth is on the thin side. Not a whole lot going on here. No off or odd notes, but not a lot of flavor either.","Redrover","Jun 24, 2010"

3.03,-13.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Admittedly not my favorite style, but this one is not great even for the style. Definitely drinkable, but too light and not the best from their stable of beers. Pours red with a medium head, nothing special, but nice enough. Smells sweet and a little corny- smells of adjunct. Tastes similar, with more sweet adjunct flavor and very light hops. Just okay.","Georgiabeer","Sep 10, 2009"
3.58,2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: This is a nicely done beer, I could sit with a few of these for a little bit, but the sweetness in the aftertaste deters me from drinking it all night.","Jayli","Aug 24, 2009"
3.88,11.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer with some substance that is worth drinking for a while.","TheManiacalOne","Aug 14, 2009"

3.7,6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall- Nice and clean. Good balance between the malt and earthy hops. My 1st from Diamond Bear and a good 1 at that.","NJpadreFan","Jun 16, 2008"

3.56,2,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Picked up a bottle while in Fayetteville. This is an interesting red ale. I'm getting nutty flavors that remind me more of an English brown ale, while this still looks and largely tastes like a red-amber hued, caramel malt. There's also a nice tan head that lasts the whole beer through. And while this is a tasty beer overall, the body is bit thick, making it feel more like the heartier American red ale style. Still worth a try for an interesting take on the style.","tempest","Oct 31, 2006"
4.13,18.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Very drinkable and sessionable. A surprisingly yummy little ale by Diamond Bear.","tavernjef","Jun 28, 2006"
2.84,-18.6,4.5,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"This beer looks incredible. Nice rich, red body topped by a thick light tan head that shows nice lacing and decent retention. Aroma has some nice caramel notes and a bit of hops, but also a fair amount of what smells like corn or DMS. And holy crap, it's actually bottle conditioned! Swirling it a bit to pick up just enough yeast to make the beer slightly hazed effectively covers the off aroma and throws more of a bread and caramel note in the aroma. Amazing transformation. Flavor actually smoothes out a bit as well, but it still has a slightly skunky & adjunct flavor. Decent bitterness comes through in the flavor. Mouthfeel is fair. Drinkability - well, not a favorite of mine, but I will finish the sixer. Definitely a step in the right direction from the BMC fizzy yellow beers, but not quite a leap. But hey, it's brewed in Arkansas, and it's more than I though I would find down here! And for the record, I find Arkansas to be a beautiful state, just not real beer friendly. I drove for hours from Texarkana to Fort Smith and I swear the entire trip was through dry counties, so to find beers brewed in Little Rock was a real treat. Honestly.","aaronh","Beers"
3.22,-7.7,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"flavor is somewhat light, but dominated by a caramel malt sweetness. faintest hint of cherries and a wisp of smoke. fairly light mouthfeel with a medium-high carbonation and a clean finish. comes off more as an amber ale than a red, but it's drinkable and inoffensive.","Prufrock","0"
4.34,24.4,5,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Mouthfeel- Pretty good for a Killian like Irish red beer. But this had more flavor and personality too it. The carbonation helps the flavor move on from the tongue.","scruffwhor","Dec 07, 2004"
3.35,-4,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Nice enough sliding down the throat, rests pleasantly on the palate, but I had a hankering for a beefier taste. Just a little, anyway.","feloniousmonk","Oct 12, 2004"
3.55,1.7,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Brown with coppery-ruby highlights, largely clear, there is just a whisper of haze. A few bubbles were noticed in the liquid, they lazily raced towards the head, which was beige in color. The foam reached almost two fingers in height before fading quickly to a thin cap. This cap lasted awhile but left the beer completely before I removed all the beer from by glass. There was no subsequent lacing. The nose has modest potency but the most vocal aroma was toffee. Very light sweetness, in fact it is a little dry. Toasted malts with a slightly earthy undertone finishes the bouquet. Clean. Simple. Inviting. The palate is pleasant. I like it. Malt leads the way, Brown Ale-like roasted malts (tasty), toffee, light sweetness, some earthiness, chocolate, and at the finish is a tickle of hop-induced bitterness. Throughout the taste is a small note of astringency. The finish is creamy but dry with a Scotch Ale-like vibe. There isnt much about the taste that says Red Ale but, thankfully, this beer works, it works well. Tasty stuff. Of the three beers Ive tried from Diamond Bear this one is the best. Medium in body, maybe a little bigger, the carbonation is modest, the mouthfeel is very good, filling. This is a pleasant quaff. Id buy a six-pack and drink away the day. It is a solid, uncomplicated beer. A good complement to stews or chili I would think. I have no criticisms about the taste, mouthfeel, or drinkability. I do wish the nose were louder and richer in smells. Oh well. If this was my local Id be happy. Thanks rugger for the bottle.","bditty187","Beers"
4,14.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a solid 4 point beer. Even if I am a little biased. This beer pors a beautiful amber red with a nice head that leaves little lacing but looks nice in the beginning and then it seems to bow out when it is time for the flavours to shine throught. The smell is almost belgian like with a nice fruity nutty earthy smell. The first sip is of a nice sweet and nutty feel. The mouthfeel is nice and bold and it almost seems to be on the heavy sice, but for a nite cap beer it fits the bill. Very drinkable and worth a try. I am glad this is carried up in my neck of the woods.","rugger","0"
