"O: This fits the Irish Red Ale description but IMO this would be better with a bit less sweetnes"
""

"Medium-light body, lightish carbonation. Dry finish, heck, dry middle, dry beginning, even. Not harsh, but dry. Relatively easy to drink."
""
""

"Pours an amzing clear reddish color with a nice head and a fair amount of carbonation that feels great on the palate. I get a touch of bread and dried fruit on the nose. Carbonation is definately the dominant trait at first mouthfeel. The bitterness of some hops is very present and I get a touch of nutty earthiness as it drinks. Overall, a great refresher for a hot day !!!"

"Overall: Nice red ale. The taste is sophisticated enough that it's not boring. Should be a crowd pleaser for ""we need a lot of good beer that's not expensive or weird"" type events."

"Overall Drinkability: Slaint√© to this one."

"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, amber coloring with a thin, filmy, clingy, white head. Aromas of roast caramel and nut sweetness, with hints of smoke. Flavors are richly sweet and roasty, with caramel and sugary notes. Smooth, light bodied with a tangy sweet aftertaste. Clean, lingering finish, with floral and sugary notes left behind."

"notes: my 2nd Maine beer in an hour. this is a nice ale, well balanced, interesting enough to be distinguishable. would drink again."

"overall: A malt focused beer with a nice dry finish. An easy to drink, food friendly beer. It has the caramel flavor but lacks the initial sweetness for the style which just fine by me but sort of forces me to hold back on a point there."
""
"O - This is an excellent Red ale with big flavor. I love the balance between the rich flavors and the crisp finish of hop character."
""
"Wonderfully heady pour into a 14oz. pilsner glass. Nice hazy ruddy red color. Subdued sweet malt nose with a little hop nuance to get the nose hairs to stand up. Nice hop character up front and on the finish with malt sweetness balance the bitterness. Dry finish. Sturdy mouth feel, I would say this is the poster child for medium bodied. Not fizzy and very smooth. Overall this is a wonderfully easy drinking red ale whose flavors are an easy all season sell."
""
"O- a good session brew here but not as balanced as I would like to see."
""

"O: this is a very good Irish Red and would definitely have this again."
""
"O - An excellent red ale. Nice malt flavors meshed with a nice light hoppiness along with a good aroma. I could easily see myself having a few of these with friends. Highly recommend if you have the chance to try it."

"Dr: A very drinkable red ale with no bold flavours or any unique characteristics. Quite pleasant; a great session beer (by Irish standards). I'd like to try it on draught at a pub. The toasted malt in particular is quite nice."

"So so sad. This used to be one of my east coast faves. Then it disappeared for a while and tonight I paid 9$ for a six. Mistake. Used to be a fresh tasting ale and tonight it was a run-of-the-mill Shipyard brew--ie, ringwood (yeast) city. Major disappointment."
"Overall - I finished this before I knew it, so I guess it can't be bad. I just barely noticed I was drinking a beer. I'm just not one for red ales, but it wasn't bad."
"I was happily surprised by this beer. I could enjoy this one with a good meal or around the campfire straight from the bottle. If you're looking for a good Irish Red, this one comes highly recommended."
"Goes very well with lobster chowder, lobster rolls and boiled lobster with potato salad and corn on the cob...and melted butter!"
"Drinkability: I was pleasantly surprised by this; a great Irish red."
"Would easily have this beer again no problem"
"Ran into this at Jameson's Tavern in Freeport, ME. It had a light clear copper color with very little white head that disappeared leaving no discernable lacing. The aroma is cider malt mash and light grass hops. The flavor is lemony hopped malt with lots of caramel cardboard. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied, a bit limp in feel. Fairly drinkable but not great enough to warrant more than a couple I think."
"Value: Perhaps the greatest thing about this fine red ale. I paid $6.99 for a six pack at the grocery store. Hard to beat that."
"Friend of mine passed this one along from the beer-of-the-month club. Poured a rich amber with ruby highlights. Small tan head that persisted. Bready maltiness in the nose with a hint of hops. Caramel malt sweetness but balanced more toward woody/grassy hop flavored bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. Finishes dry with the hop flavor carrying through in the aftertaste."
"light to medium body, smooth, w touch of resins in finish. gentle to moderate carbonation can be tingly but also moments of creaminess."
"Drinkability: Some of the bitter and metallic flavors are a little off-putting and limit my enjoyment of this beer"
"D) As stated before a good balance between the malt and hops. I'd drink another."
"Poured with a very small, off-white head. Body is mostly clear with a trace of haziness, and a dark amber color. Good aroma... average maltiness present, some caramel, and light yeast. Great on the palate: smooth, medium-body with a creamy texture; soft carbonation. Progresses well to the terrific flavor: caramel and malt, nice and creamy, with a medium-duration finish. The beer does not look like anything special, but it's easiest one of the best Irish Reds I've tasted... could drink this all day for sure."
"Very nice flavor. A lot more dry and bitter hops than I expected. Malt sweetness balances things somewhat, though the finish is definitely dry. Woody and biscuity. Touch of spice. Mouthfeel is light, but very refreshing. Overall a very good red ale and a great offering from Casco Bay."
"A well-balanced cacophony of malts and hops greet the the palate and ride out smoothly. Bitterness is kept at a moderate level, allowing some fruitier flavors to develop like red grapes and sour apple. The maltiness is slightly sweet and suggests caramel and toasted grains, while the hops assert themselves mostly on the finish as they chime in with a fresh greenery of resin and floral notes. Body is on the lighter side of medium, and the active carbonation level turns the creamy mouthfeel into a zesty, popping finish. All in all, a very flavorful, very well-crafted Irish Red that I would be happy to try again. Nice job Casco Bay!"
"Very thick mouthfeel -- a nice substantial beer. A good amount of carbonation, but feels about right with the heavy-ish body. Couldn't go on drinking these all night, be would be a great beer to have a couple of watching the game with the guys."
"D--Yeah, it's drinkable, but not overly refreshing nor challenging/rewarding."
"The mouthfeel is dry with this much effervescence; a nice, full-bodied presence, very drinkable."
"D: Very easy to drink, low ABV which makes this enjoyable."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a nice mahogany color with great clarity. The head was a thin skim of khaki foam that did not retain well. The lacing was equally un-impressive. The aroma was a good blend of a semi-sweet, lightly fruity malt, hints of roasted malt and some hop bitterness. The flavors were at first a flash of sweetness that then became more roasted malt before going into a pleasant bitterness, hints of wood and a long roasted malt finish. Yum! The body was medium, the carbonation perfect and the mouthfeel quite good for the style. A very enjoyable beer and it would be top-class if only it looked a little better."
"Another Mainer from the BOTMC. Very malty with trace hops on the smell. Some butterscotch, some peanut brittle. Pours to a deep amber with a thin tan head. Taste is malty throughout with a little bitterness starting in the middle, becoming a little more predominant in the the end then fading away to a malty finish with only hints of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very viscous with the carbonation perfect to enjoy the flavor of this brew. This is an excellent ale, not to mention, amber ale. Good flavor complexity, not a constant balance throughout but a flip-flopping between bitter and sweet. I will have to get more to keep on hand."
"I really dig this beer and would drink more if I had more."
"D-Very, very, drinkable. This is one seems like it will hold up in the long haul without letting you down. I wish I had picked up a few cases of this on my way back from Maine."
"Nice brew. Goes well with food, or alone as a sipper. Enjoy if local, try to find if not."
"Pours a light amber with a nice half-inch head..some lacing. Smell is light malt with grassy elements. Nice malty, floral taste..a hint of roses? A bit different from the usual red ale. Mouthfeel is dry and refreshing. Drinkability is good, with a medium mouthfeel."
"Medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer and a pretty darn good example of the style! I wish it were more readily available around here; I would probably drink a lot of this if I had the chance."
"Can't really say a bad thing about this brew, other than it's an exceptional brew in a category mired by numerous clones. This red is one to reach for, however."
"Beer poured red with an off white head that is sustaining pretty well. Nose had a hint of hops upon opening but is primarily malty half way down the glass. Taste is quite nice, very malty with hints of biscuit and nut. Beer finishes with a light citrus hop. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite full for the style. Drinkability is good. This is a nice red ale with an emphasis on the malts. A nice departure from the hoppier reds."
"Tasted on 2/21/08."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was reddish in color and had a bit if a tan head. The beer was malty in smell and rick (kightly) in taste. The beer was nothing special but was still a goodbeer I thought. In fact it was enough that I will buy again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability - After the smell I never thought this beer could recover, but it managed to pick it's mouthpiece up off the canvas and get back into the fight. Then was knocked out due to the stink. There was something unpleasent about the first half a second the taste hit the mouth. All in all not the worst beer ever, but not the best either. Hooray for stink beer!"
"Poured smooth with a slight film of suds just enough to cover the surface. It looked a translucent chocolaty orange. First thing that came to mind when I smelled this were autumn leaves. Nice balanced flavor that starts with the malts and ended with a moderate amount of hops showing thru. Overall I thought this was a very good drinking beer. I could defiantly put down the additional two that came with beer of the month club but then I'd be all out."
"Drinkability: Goes down nice and easy and has just the right balance."
"Into a twelve-ounce mug, this is a nice reddish-mahogany color with a small but firm head on top. Good malty aroma, a little toasty, a little caramel. The palate is firmly malt-driven, with a crisp biscuity toastiness backed by some sweet caramel, just like the aroma implies. Bitterness is moderate and hop flavor undetectable, but this beer is mainly about the malt so it hardly matters. Neutral yeast character as well. Nice creamy texture and a medium body."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thick tan colored head that laces the glass all the way down. The smell is of nice roasted malts, and layered with a hoppy bitterness and a sweet fruity smell. It tastes of deep roasted malts as a nice base layered with an excellent sweet fruity taste, perhaps of apples but the bottle says peaches, then finished with a nice citrisy hop bitterness. It has a really nice crisp mouthfeel and an excellent drinkability. Definately worth a try if you can find it."
"D: Full flavored, easy drinkin' great session beer."
"Taste was fairly well balanced between the caramel malt and the hops and citrus, bit buttery but not too much, a pretty good red ale offering."
"Pours a fiery red-orange. Sugary sweet aroma. Very nicely balanced caramelly with strong hints of roasted grain, just how I like my red ales! Thick and smooth, but with an interesting smoky finish. Excellent. I hope I stumble upon this one in my neck of the woods sometime."
"Drinkability- A very pleasant, dark colored but light bodied brew."
"perfect while enjoying down home Maine!"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, good representation of style, this is a good beer to keep drinking consistently for an evening or to drink with a nice meal."
"Casco Bay Riptide Red Ale has to be classified as a pleasant surprise. I had no idea what to expect from this brewery or this beer. What I got was a delicious Irish red that favors the bold end of the style spectrum rather than the wimpy one. Thanks to jrdegriselles for the opportunity."
"note: disregard the placement of the pts.in the score"
"Same here the label was hard to read, I think it says 06/20/06 stamped on the side. Nice amber red color to it. Lots of head when I poured it in a glass. I enjoyed this beer for a Red Ale. First beer that I have tried from this company located in Maine."
"A 12 ounce bottle with best before 10/22/06 stamped on the label (I think, the date was difficult to read). This class of beers always look beautiful to me, and this was no exception. Red /garnet in color, with a nice medium head. Malty aroma, with a hint of sweetness. Breadlike taste, with some tang to it. An enjoyable beer."
"This beer pours a dark rich amber with a giant tan foamy head. A really beautiful beer. The smell is a nice sweet malt, floral, and maybe vanilla? aroma. The taste is rich and creamy with a nutty, sweet malt, and a vanilla or cinnamon aftertaste. The m/f is light and well balanced making this a truely quality beer."
"Caramel amber appearance, a little cloudy but nothing to worry about. Small, faint head that dissipates quickly. Smells sweet and sugarry with some hops. The body gives an initial hops impression that dominates the flavor profile without being bitter. A little bitterness lingers on the finish, but then it goes clean. A refreshing, effervescent warm weather brew."
"Maybe a little too heavy to drink in large quantities but still, I've been meaning to try this for a while and I'm glad I did. Full-flavored, well-balanced, and one of the best I've had within the style."
"A very nice red. Color is spot on and it sustains a nice cap but leaves little lacing. Smells of piney hops layered over a good malt driven beer. It taste is a little bready but a good malt character with little sweetness and nice cutting hops to keep it interesting. A good red and a great local thing to have, I just don't live in Maine, but if I did this would be a sesion beer for me. Easy body for sipping or slamming."
"Rip Tide Red poured a cloudy but distinct red color. The cloudy is a sign this beer has not had the yeast filtered out, that's good; the grain husks from the mash that poured from the bottle with the beer was a little sloppy on the part of the brewery though. The smell was light and had caramel notes with not much hop aroma. The taste was pleasant and light with a malt base, a slight caramel aftertaste, and a pleasant hop character. The mouthfeel was good, not too light but not heavy. Very drinkable and worth a try, I do not know if I would buy this by the case, but it is a good beer."
"Smells was hoppy with floral undertones. Taste was rather below average which disappointed me since I thought there'd be more here. There was a certain element of the yeast I believe that didn't settle well with my palate.I can't really recommend this beer, but it wasn't awful."
"Medium bodied beer. The mouthfeel is smooth with a light crispness at the start. The finish is slightly crisp, and caramel ride the tongue for a few seconds after swallowing. Great drinkability. Very enjoyable beer."
"deep reddish brown with a creamy head that slowly disappeared and lacing that clung decently in patches. roasted smell with grain and woodiness; floral note. sweet malt taste with a slight hop push at back of palate and a little fruitiness thrown in. slowly diminishing balanced finish. great refreshing mouthfeel. a drinking beer for sure! could've had a whole pitcher."
"Casco Bay's Riptide Ale has a medium froathy head that seemed to stay in the pitcher for most of the session, with a nice golden brown color. The color seems to seperate towards the bottom. The smell is a nice mixture of sweet malts and hops with a fruity aromatic smell. The taste was nice, mellow hops with a smooth aftertaste. The red ale is full of flavor. It hits the back of the tongue and has some nice bitters in the aftertaste, however the bitters disapate quickly. Not as rich as some other Irish Red Ales, but definately a good choice."
"Thanks to brewguru."
" The aroma is a well blended treat of malts and hops. The taste starts out with a quick dose of sweet malt and caramel followed by a direct but not overpowering shot of hop. The mouth is left with a slight grainy dryness that leaves the mouth crisp and refreshed. A nice Irish red indeed. Drinkability holds up well anytime."
"Pours with a two-finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Hoppy nose. Starts as a mix of malt and hops but finishes hoppy with a hoppy aftertaste. The brewer says ""5 different malts and 3 hop varietals, carefully blended, results in a perfect balance"". But the hops dominate. $1.35 for a 12 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium ruby red color with three fingers of off-white head. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very balanced with lots of sweet maltiness and a great dose of hops. Very pleasant. The taste is malty at first and fairly sweet. A little bit of tart cherry tones down the sweetness in the middle. The finish is nice and hoppy. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth for a red ale. The drinkability is great. I was really impressed by this beer!"
"The beer gushes from the 12-ounce brown bottle a slightly beclouded copper color with the head portly in size and frothy in texture, the color a light tan with the resultant lace a fine covering upon the glass. Nose is dominated by the sweet malt, crisp and clean to the senses, start is slightly sweet, a decent malt profile with the top light to medium in feel. Finish is pertinently acidic with the hops mild and pleasant in their spiciness, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting a drinkable beer."
"Certainly, one of the most drinkable ales I encountered on the Maine coast. Very well done."
"This is a great tasting well balanced red ale that I'd like to find on tap soon."
"Poured a bright and snazzy clear copper in color with a thick and long-lasting off-white head. Nice lacing of the glass. Aromas are surprisingly hoppy (always a nice thing for this hop-head). There's a mixture of floral and grassy hops mixed in with some brown sugar sweetness. Flavor, too, was hoppy. Nice dose of malty sweetness keeps this one in check. What was most interesting with this was the pronounced chocolate flavor that came in at the end. Not too over-malted and that is a great thing. Very smooth mouthfeel and aftertaste is a dollop of chocolate on your tongue. Quite tasty and one that I'd seek out again."
"The RipTide Red is a spectacular example of what a red should be, a definite must if you ever are near Maine."
"This is a very drinkable amber ale and I would suggest this beer for someone trying to find a beer to style. The color is a little off but other than that it is a great ale."
"This will stand up well, and not get tiring if you're having a couple."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"Not my style, but I enjoy the richness of the malt. It's almost like an unsweetened caramel."
"Short lived off-white head fades to a film. Aroma is a mix of piney hops and tangy malt. Clear, cola brown colored beer. A pretty light bodies beer, a bit slick, nothing special. Flowery hop flavor with a bit of bitterness stand out above the roasted barley. A decent beer, not my favorite style, nothing really stands out."
"Showed up in the February BOTM shipment. Pours a beautiful deep red with a smallish creamy head. Aroma of deep roasted malt and a bit of yeast. Wonderful taste - sweet malt, lightly fruity, with a bitter, slightly smoky finish. Dryness of the hops lingers in the aftertaste. Nice body - rich, slightly creamy. A great example of a red ale."
"Poured into a pint glass, nice inch head formed, which slowly dissipated. Malt presence is obvious from the opening of the bottle, if you have a nose. Excellent taste balance of hops and grain, deep red hue makes this what a red ale should be. Highly recommended..."
"Thanks JohnnyP."
"A tasty brew, although the butterscotch flavor was a bit overpowering. Whether it was actually the beer or the lines were dirty, I have no idea. I'll have to give a bottle of this a shot, as I've never seen it on tap in CT."
"On tap at the GLB. What better place to sample a fresh Maine beer. Medium amber-reddish color. More red than brown in color. Glowing shiny color, nice bubbly beige head. Medium carmel malt smells, sweet candy smells. Taste was full of rich sweet carmel taste. Candy, and a slight bitter snap to finish. Hops were way in the back and very sublte. All about a nice smooth malty sweetness here. However, there was no feeling of slick sweetness or aritificial amber ale tastes that are so common for the style. Medium to full bodied, this would compliment a lobsta or serve as a nice autumn treat. Right up there with the Rogue American Amber in my opinion."
"A very good red ale."
"This stuff pours red (I think the hummingbirds went after it). I savoured its light, floral, slightly tart (and clearly hoppy) smell on my back porch in Maine. I was enticed. As the tan head receded, I took a sip and discovered a smokey citrus taste, like a pink grapefruit aged in an oak cask. It's a different and intriguing brew. A third sip, and I'm still working on describing the aftertaste: just a bit bitter, but not distressingly so. A good brew: I recommend it."
"I'll have to have more of this."
"Pours a deep red/amber, good sized tan head, and leaves good lacing on the way down. Aroma is lightly sweet (caramel), and strong on the bitter floral hops. Flavor starts with the caramel, middle and end are dominated by the hops, with a little hint of chocolate sneaking in somewhere. Medium body, easy drinking, perfect for a session around the campfire in Maine this summer."
"That said, if it is the only beer that you are drinking in one session, it should go over well enough. I did make the mistake of drinking about 1/3 of a bottle and then taking a swig of (Brand B red ale) before finishing my own. Initially after (Brand B red ale) it tasted like, well, nothing, but gradually the flavors came back in as I drank more and it came to taste like an off batch of red..."
"Cheers to the BA Beer exchange at Victory Brewing for the sample!"
"Clear light ruby hue. Vanilla white, thin, spotty head leaves tattered lace. Mild citrus and lightly perfumed hop nose along with dark lovibond caramel malt with a roasted tinge in aroma. Sweet biscuit and mild toffee initially in flavor gently gives way to slowly augmenting hop bitterness and a snap of roasted barley sharpness. Mid palate hop bitterness becomes assertive when coupled with the apparently minerally, perhaps sulfate rich, water and facilitates a concomintantly thirst quenching and inducing nature. (Maybe this is what MJ means by hop bitterness being ""moreish"") Light in body, but crisp and relatively soft on the palte. Understated red currant like fruit esters surface late along with mellow, sweetish biscuit. Finishes clean and dry, with hints of toasty Munich. A well balanced, flavorful red ale with excellent drinkability. RipTide certainly has more overall character than the norm for the typically insipid style. Thanks, Mainebeerman for the Marc beer fund donation!"
"I had never heard of this beer but when I was at the Springhouse Drafting Room I saw this and decided to give a try,and Iam glad I did.Poured a deep copper/red color with minimal head,smell was roasty and somewhat fruity.Taste was very roasted and a little chocolaty with some fruity flavors also comin thru,I think that this is the way a true ""red"" should taste but many cant live up to the style.This one sure did live up to the style,maybe one of the best if not the best I have had,really well done."
"This product tastes like what I would expect a quality Irish Red Ale to taste. Pours a bright red with a nice creamy head. The initial taste seems to emphasize the malt characteristics of the product while the finish places more emphasis on the hops. Smooth mouthfeel and pleasant and lingering aftertaste. I would expect that this might become Casco Bay's flagship product despite the brewery's highly acclaimed (and justifiably so) Pilsener. Wish it were available in NH."
"This beer poured into the glass amber in color with a slight red highlight. It was slightly opaque and fairly well carbonated. The head that was produced was a medium beige/tan color that was thick and creamy, some chunky parts mixed in the foam, and seemed to last fairly well. The lace that it produced stared off as sticky sheets then slid right into a decent lace that was sparse in some areas and chunky in others. The aromas that came from the glass were strong at points and slight in others. I nosed floral hops, sweet malts, chocolate, citrus, fruit, roasted malt, coconut, nuts and some bread. Surprisingly complex and diverse aromas from this beer. The tastes that flowed over my tongue were of bitter hops, flowers, roasted malt, bitter chocolate, creamy chocolate, earth tones, biscuits, and a slight alcohol warmth at the end, and it left a slight hop flavor in the aftertaste. It was medium to full bodied. The warmer this beer got, the more the flavors and aromas increased. A good beer and very drinkable, I would get again."
"Not my first, and certainly not my last... A slightly hazy, deep amber body is capped by a frothy ivory head that drops shortly to a creamy collar and light surface foam. It holds well and leaves some thin, transient lace throughout the pint. Bold floral hops welcome you; and a sweet, biscuity maltiness becomes apparent with a little more nosing around. It's medium/full body combines with a fine and moderate carbonation to leave it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor is rich without being overbearing. It's biscuity and gently caramelish malt provides a perfect counterbalance to its vibrant citrusy and mildly resinous hop flavor. A solid bitterness anchors it without distracting. It finishes with some dry maltiness and a ghost of its hop flavor before fading into a lingering, mild bitterness. Refreshing and fulfilling! A clean, exceptionally well-balanced, and highly drinkable beer! Very nicely done and well worth trying."
"F."
"This beer was awesome. And at $4.20 for a six pack how could I not buy it? It poured a thick, foggy, orange-red with a really off white head. The smell was very fruity and reminded me of peaches, which was very pleasing to the nose. The taste was just a little bitter with a nice mellow malt flavor, and a nice citrus undertone. I really like this beer! Maine is a lucky state."
"Overall a very nice red ale. A pleasure to drink in summer or winter with a complex and well balanced flavor. A little more aroma and it would be almost perfect."
"Rich looking hazy amber with a tan head and some nice, decorative lace. With the aroma, right off the bat this brew hints at the malty and hoppy goodness to come. Those flavors are in perfect balance creating an incredibly drinkable ale. I think I¬íll keep this around on a regular basis. In fact I went back to the store and bought the last two sixes. Without being overly complex, this brew revels in simplicity and that makes it a real pleasure to drink. A nice find and a keeper."
"This flavorful bold red ale has a very complex character. The bold malt aroma drifts from the glass to fill the air. The initial roasted dark malt flavor gives way to a light hop spice and a sharp lingering bitterness. Pretty drinkable, quite tasty."
"385"
"Nice red/amber color with a good head that dropped off quickly but left some really nice lace. Great flowery hop aroma with a bit of sweet malt. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with medium-low carbonation. Flavor is nice, rich toasty malt, not really sweet, not darkly bitter with just enough citrusy hop flavor to make it work. Another great tasting easy drinking beer from the Pine Tree State."
"The beer arrived with a dark reddish amber color with a small off white head which left some nice lace.  It had a nice aroma of malt and hops.  The flavor was of malt, hops, caramel and some spices.  Slightly tangy, yet slightly bitter as well, finish.  A very enjoyable beer."
"Notes: Absolutely delicious! One of my favourite Casco brews! A regular in our Dad's fridge in York Harbor, ME. I can drink this one all-day long ... shame I can't get it in MA."
