"I did go to their website to look for merchandise and didn't see any. I like to collect brewery t-shirts."
"Pours a crystal clear medium gold color with a smallish white head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of bready caramel malt and light earthy hops to counter. The flavor is what I expected from the aroma. Sweet bread and caramel with hints of fruit and earth. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Serviceable ale, reminds me of something I would have been really into about 10 years ago, but today its just ok."

"The taste is like the nose in that toasted bready malts and butter kick in right off but there is a low to moderate earthy bitterness hanging around at the end to add just the slightest bite. Easy to drink but pretty ordinary."

"Poured from bottle into tulip. Pours a copper color with some white foam and a lot of carbonation. Malty and bready fruity lager aromas. Taste is slightly below average, but its close enough to a 3...Crisp malt flavors, slight sweet fruit notes and a hint of yeast. its not bad, but there are better options out there. Mouthfeel is over-carbonated and dry. Again, give it a try but dont seek out."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, muddled, copper-yellow coloring with a frothy, white, small bubbled foam of head about half an inch tall. Aromas are light and smooth, with a light sweetness atop some toasty and bready tones. Flavors are off-balance a bit, with a decent, strong roasted caramel malt backbone and some subtle fruit highlights overpowering any of the toasty and biscuity qualities that were present in the nose. The beer is light to the point of watery in mouth, which makes it easy to drink, but not overly rewarding. The aftertaste is cloyingly sweet, with a slight floral twist. The finish is a bit watery, and leaves a slight film behind. Like I said, it's easy to drink, but there are better beers worth your time and focus out there."
"O/D- I am not a fan of this style. This was actually one of the better one I have tried from this style. Sweet and simple. Less coarse than other Irish Reds I have had. Nowhere near bad."

"Poured a pretty 1.5"" custard head with decent lasting power. The body is a clear radiant orangy amber, which doesn't exactly look like an Irish Red Ale to me but it still looks nice. There's not much smell, just some malt. The taste has malt, it's creamy, and a little sweet. Body is pretty light weight. This strikes me as a decent everyday workhorse beer alternative to BMCs."

"Aroma is of light caramel, roasted nuts, light touches of butterscotch like sugary notes. Warming brings out a very earthy and pronounced flavor to it. Really nice done but a touch light. This is my only complaint as it did not have the pop I was really looking for at the time. Smooth, even flavor really did not deviate much from beginning to end as the overall impact was nicely put together. A bit light on the feel"

"The feel of this beer is somewhat smooth. It does feel pleasant but there is a lingering aftertaste that was a little tough but a decent beer."
"Mouth feel was ok taste lingers on tongue. Like most of the Wachusett beers Ive tasted drinkable but not delicious."
"Pours a nice clear brownish red. Has a mild foamy head that doesn't last too long. Has a mild bitter taste with a hint of lemon. A faint hoppy aroma. This seems to a balanced brew that doesn't overpower in any one area. Nicely carbonated. Has a nice zesty feel to it."
"Looks good. Mostly clear, amber in colour, with a solid half inch of light beige foam. A bit sticky with good head retention. Malty aroma, a little toasty and buttery. Slightly metallic. Pretty much the same in the flavour, low bitterness, kind of fruity in the finish. The body was fine up front, but fell away at the end. Medium to low carbonation, sort of creamy. Not bad overall, but I'm not clamouring for more."
"Thanks to Larry P for bring these back for us."
"Served at my brother's BBQ this past weekend. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark auburn color. Nice sized white head. Smell had a hint of pine to it with some noticeable hops aroma. Flavor was very tasty, as there was plenty of malt to satisfy my palate. Mouthfeel was smooth and I definitely felt that this beer had a nice aftertaste to it. Drinkability was quite good, as this beer had enough body to stand up to grilled foods. A nice red ale to drink by itself or pair with food."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a translucent copper with a frothy, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a thin, consistent skim. Some spots and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose reveals some caramel malt and fruity esters. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavor profile thins out a bit. Some biscuity malts also come out as well as a light hops bittering; fairly non-discrete. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Not bad, but a little lackluster"
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a ring, leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Bready nose. Flavor is malty, caramel and very little hops, unusual for an amber. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma. Best by Jul 2010."
"Drinkability: Nice sweet sessionable bready flavor that is barely above average for the style. This one is pleasant to drink but does not jump out the way some other beers from this brewery do."
"D: I wrote ""Blech!"" which pretty much sums it up. I'm glad I only bought the single."
"(D) A decent beer. Follows the form for an Irish Red, but not a stand out ale."
"This beer pours a nice deep, clear amber color. The head is an offwhite color, relatively decent retention and slight lacing left on the sides. The nose is very weak, almost no scent at all. There is a touch of breadiness and pale malts, but other than that - not much to the nose. The taste is also very blase but a little more to it than the nose. Starts off with a malt flavoring, slightly sweet, slightly bready. Touch of hops but not enough or well blended to work well off the malt and sweetness. Medium bodied beer - decent carbonation, but a bit of a sour aftertaste to it. Overall, it's drinkable, but I would certainly pick something different. It's an ok beer but nothing really stood out."
"Nonthing fancy, but another solid New England beer. It makes love living in a region that's so prone to brewing its own beer, and doing it well. Again, even though this beer is nothing to shout about, it's something that I would buy again should the appropriate situation arise in terms of company."
"This beer poured a copper-color with a two-finger head. The smell is caramel and toasted malt with a bit of nuttiness. The taste starts off with a slightly grainy sweet caramel taste that gives way to a metallic taste and a tiny bit of hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a some crisp carbonation. I'm not a fan of the metallic taste, but this isn't a horrible beer."
"This is very mild for being an irish red ale. I would like a bit more flavor and body to follow this style of beer."
"I will not seek this brew out again. I never choose this style to be honest."
"Drinkability: Good Irish Red with nice complexity. High carbonation may limit how much you would want, but very tasty and seemingly low ABV may it quite drinkable."
"I'm not a big fan of Irish Reds, so I need to preface any review with that disclosure. The beer is moderately carbonated, typically reddish in color, with some sweet malty caramel aromas, with the red fruity aromas typical of the style. The taste is malty, caramely, a bit flat tasting, some cloying sweetness, and the very typical copperish/reddish flowery taste of the Irish red ales. Nothing new in this beer. It is very typical of the style, nothing more, nothing less. It's okay, I'm not a big fan, I'm moving on."
"Overall a tasty and easy drinking Irish Ale."
"Light bodied, smooth feel, but slightly thick at the end. Leaves a light film. Smooth drinker. It's good and balanced: the hops and malt are both bitter but also flowery."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, not the best representation of style, itâ€™s a decent beer to keep drinking for an evening."
"The beer pours a golden/light amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a pale and light crystal malt scent along with a fruity/sour yeast aroma. There is something wrong with the aroma. The taste is not very good. It has a real yeasty flavor that overpowers the weak malt bill. It seems almost past it's prime. The malt bill is simple and consists of pale and light crystal malts. Hops are faint and probably English noble varieties. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is the worst beer Wachusett makes. It's back to the drawing board with this one."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a more of a lighter copper color than an amber a thin wispy white head atop,toasty aromas along a touch of butter and caramel.Light to medium mouthfeel but quite crisp it went down quite well,quite toasty a lightly sweet and caramelly with a hint of mineral.A basic amber here not much hop presence but it drinks easy."
"This tasted different from the Quinn's I remember a few years back when it was labeled as an Irish Style Ale rather than an Amber Ale. If the formula has been ""tweaked"" in the process, it has not been to the overall benefit of the product. This used to be my favorite Wachusett seasonal. It now seems to be more of an average decent product but one with no special appeal to cause a followup purchase."
"Pours a golden amber. Fluffy head,with good retention,and lacing.Body is light to medium,and carbonated. Smell is of roasted malts. Nice,but weak. Taste is roasted,and sweet with a bit of hop in the finish. I'm not all that famliar with this style,but this is a refreshing good flavored brew. I would try it again."
"D - Really easy to drink, refreshing, but still has a substantial amount of flavor for a light-bodied brew. I'll have more of these"
"Notes: This beer has lost something over the years, very pedestrian and certainly does not stand above any of the traditional Irish Reds."
"D- eeeh."
"Mouthfeel has a strong, chewy body that exhibits easy drinking smoothness with mellow carbonation. This one goes down easy. A well built ale that I wouldn't mind drinking more often. Thanks to MuddyFeet and BIF20 for this one!"
"Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with caramel malts throughout each sip. A nice hop presence helps balance this beer out. Wachusett brewery biscuit and bready flavors in there too. The feel on the palate is very ""soft"" and with syrupy malts."
"Not one of my favorite style, but now definitely one of my favorite brews for the style. Pours a clay color, like infield dirt with a big foamy head and lots of lace. Aroma is malty with hops very faintly in the background. Flavor was very sweet malts and hints of some sort of nut. Chestnut perhaps? Kind of an earthy feel to the whole flavor. Made me think of a foggy morning. Mouthfeel is pretty well carbonated with a medium body. Finishes very crisp. Very smooth to drink and tough to put down."
"Nice, if brief, hops at the front, then disappearing, evaporating, fading, along with the body. Begins medium, then bottoms out. Malt dominated, crisp on the palate, but disappointing after the hoppy introduction. A passable Irish Ale for the ""punters"" in the crowd, (the label for this one calls it an Amber Ale, not an Irish, though).but...alas, not grabbing me."
"Overall: A decent brew, easy to drink."
"Here's an okay beer. With the slightly off aroma aside, this is a very non-descript brew--neither offensive nor interesting. Worthy of a taste, but perhaps not a six pack."
"This ale poured a clear, amber-red color with creamy, tan foam that settled. The smell was sweet malt with a hint of caramel. The taste was malty and only lightly hoppy with notes of caramel. Overall the flavor was ""mellow"". The mouthfeel was dry and smooth but with a crispness. It had medium body and moderate carbonation. Not much to say about this one, but it is a decent, easy drinking, not overly complex beer."
"Clear copper appearance. Pale yellow head, creamy in texture, lasts at 1/4 of an inch for just over a minute. Spare lace, crown-like rings. Spicy aroma, light grape astringency with some nutmeg. Flavor starts easy going but oddly slick, a fruity sense with some pear flavors, honeyish as well. Keeps its texture but the flavor pans out to mildly watery mid mouth, the hops could step up to the plate more as well. Toward the end of the glass, I was picking up weird aftertastes, something like parmesan cheese. Good appearance and start, decent overall drinkability, the close was a little off for me. Thanks to Liza P. for bringing a bottle back from a short Easter break in Rhode Island."
"This was an amber beer, topped by a bit of fluffy whiteness that died quickly. Lightly fragrant, I found a bready maltiness to chew on amid the fine bubbles. With the clean bitterness in the hops, I could have a couple more. Very nice."
"Pint glass presentation. Fluffy off-white head on deep golden-brown brew. Malt outpowers the hops a bit on this one, but they have obviously worked hard to get both constituents in balance for this brew, in preparation for their prime St. Patrick's Day window of sales. Taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability are all great on this brew, and I would recommend to anyone for a ""with-dinner"" beer. Enjoy..."
"Better than average, considering I caught this at the edge of its lifespan."
