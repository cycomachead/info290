"Very tasty. Rich red lager with a slightly hoppy taste. Probably one of the best and most interesting red beers available."
"This was a decent brew, not one that I would have regularly or probably buy again, but I have two more of these left (got 3 as part of the Short's Autumn variety pack), I definitely won't mind drinking them."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 9/26/2014. Pours moderately hazy deep red/copper color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Irish red ale. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: A quality beer that would be much better with some bubbles. Underrated beer overall in my opinion."
"This beer really does nothing for me except encourage me to dump it out."
""

"Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied. It washes down rather quickly. It leaves a faint coat near the back of the tongue, and finishes slightly dry."

"Overall, I'm shocked at the 77/100 rating. That's a decent score, but I actually thoroughly enjoy this one, and it's one of my new favorites from Short's. That sour smell, tart flavor, malty finish.. all of it comes together well. May I have another?"

"I hate when you try beers when you're...well...""tipsy"" and then make an effort to try them sober and things seem totally different. I remember this being such a nice harmony of styles with such interesting character. This version seems so-so. Kind of a mildly sour dish of amber tones and I can't quite say what else. I really wish I had taken notes when I tried this first, wherever it was. But, alas, more sober ponderings are probably more accurate ones."

"O: a strange brew, not to sure what to make of this one, kind of one, Alot different then any other brew I have had latley, deffinatly not bad, Not a huge fan of the aftertaste though..."
""
""
""

""
""
"O - This was a drain pour for me. There was nothing about this - from the floral hop profile to the overly sweet malt bill - that was inviting to me."
""
""
"O- Good, much better in this style. The Great Lakes version reminded me of cooked cabbage."
"Overall - A nice, complex, well balanced beer. Not overly sweet at all, and very easy to drink. Enough hops to hide any alcohol whatsoever. This would make avery good, interesting and refreshing sesssion beer."
""
""
"Overall quite a solid brew with good malt complexity."

""

"O – A cool brew from Short’s. I was expecting more of a fusion-style brew, but this seemed to be more of a traditional style. Solid drinkability, it’s too bad I only had one bottle…"
"I'm very impressed. I don't often buy malt driven beers that aren't either a stout or a porter. By far the best Irish Red I've had."
"O: I wasn't expecting much but this is pretty good. Very malt-heavy, almost no noticeable hops, but at the same time it's quite light and thin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely not my favorite from Short's, but it's not too bad. None of the flavors are really overstated, which is a very good thing."
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down smooth and I could easily have a few glasses of this throughout the evening. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, and a good representation of the style. It is definitely one of the better Irish Red Ales that I have had so far. I recommend trying it out if you come across it. I would buy it agian."

"O: Overall I like it and would drink it again and would like to try this on tap somewhere."

"Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this beer. So far, pretty impressed with Shorts, this is another offering I have never had before. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn Tulip. This is an ugly looking beer. Looks like Storm drain water/something I would find in a rest stop toilet. Little to no head. Visible small bubbles streaming from the bottle of the glass. I assume this is going to be pretty carbonated. Smell- strawberries, a hint of plastic. Some off-flavors here on the nose. Taste- watered down plastic mixed with strawberries. Something is wrong here. I'm not sure I would call this a drain pour, because other than the plastic flavors, its a pretty easy drinking beer. There just aren't many redeemable qualities to this one. Overall, not a fan. Other offerings from Shorts have been very strong, this is an exception."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep amber color with an almost non-existant head. The nose is malt forward with a mixture of dark fruits, caramel, biscuit and nut. Flavor is all malt too, with the caramel and fruity notes coming to the forefront. Mouthfeel is quite viscous with a very thin carbonation and slightly drying finish. Overall a very drinkable beer, would be easy to tip back a few of these."

"o: not my cup of tea. needs better balance with hops and less raisins."
"The tangy aftertaste kind of ruins this for me. Not bad before then, but nothing good going on either."
"O - It's not a bad tasting beer. The mouth feel is the biggest turnoff for me."
"O: I didn't pick hardly any of the infection in the nose, but it's definitely there in the taste. This wouldn't be a bad beer if it weren't for the infection."
"O: Not a very good red ale. The strange fruitiness and metal note didn't do much for me."
"I don't like red ales...and this confirms it further."
"O- Probably one of Short's less impressive offerings. I'm glad I opted for the single as this just tasted a little weird to me. I just found it a little too much to have the fruitiness without much else."
"A good strong ale, the heat hidden well enough, and with a healthy balance of sturdy malt, and peppy, yet restrained hops."
"O- Lackluster. Not horrible, but not appetizing. Won't seek out again. Forgettable and mediocre."
"A very solid beer, but quite one dimensional."
"Overall: I was not expecting so much sour - at first I thought the beer was bad. Besides that, this brew is just an Irish Red with a sour, peppery zing to it. Nothing special."
"O: Overall this is a good beer, a light borderline session ale. flavors are not palate shocking and more is better in this case. I found a far cry of a qisper of a sour note on the finish as the glass warmed. As a wild ale this would not only be a good base, but an interesting combination."
"Appearance is red-brown with about one finger of head. Its` smell has cherries, toffee and bread...& tart. Upon sipping, I think that this is different than other Irish Reds that I have consumed in the past. The malts are there that I would expect, but spices such as pepper are more pronounced and also a sour aspect that really sets it apart. I was not expecting that in this style. MF is light-med, good carbonation. For me, this was pretty good, partly because it is so different from most other Irish reds."
"O - Well, I can say I've had it. Tried to be objective, but have a hard time finding any redeeming quality of this one."
"Overall: An interesting beer with a few strange flavors pitting against each other and a deliciously simple malt backbone in the distance. Unique albiet confused."
"Overall- I’m starting to find that a lot of Short’s beers are very hit or miss, some of them are absolutely amazing and on the other hand some of them are absolute avoids, and this is of the latter. There is nothing going on here really, weird flavours and only bready malt and very slight earthy hops come through at all. Personally I am not a fan and as far as the reviews go it seems like everyone is pretty much on the same boat. Avoid this one as there are so many more better Short’s offerings out there for you to discover."
"O: both of the Irish Reds I’ve rated I’ve enjoyed more especially the GLBC Conway’s Irish Ale. I was a little disappointed by this beer but it was horrible. But if you’re a huge Irish Red fan go for it, if no there are better alternatives available for this style."
"Disappointing. Short's brews often contain flashes of incoherent brilliance that leaves one reeling, but this is another effort marred by...something. Faint sour notes really bring this one down. Coulda been a contender."
"Notes: This one is a very unique Irish Red ale which is a good thing. The sour notes set it apart from other Irish Red ales. Cheers."
"Edit - On drinking another bottle a month later, I noticed a little bit of a sour taste. I think they may have some sloppy sanitation procedures because previous bottles didn't taste like this and this style shouldn't."
"The beer appears amber in color with a thin head that leaves a bit of lacing on the snifter. The aroma brings malt, slight sweetness, and a hint of caramels. The flavor is pretty simple - malt with a bit of caramel. It's decent enough, but rather bland. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. An OK beer, albeit unexciting."
"Pours a murky dark red color with small white head. Scent is malty and grainy with a hint of caramel. Taste is initially toffee and caramel, but immediately followed by a skunky/tart off-flavor. The maltiness is put off by this. Now I LOVE me some tart/sour beers, but this one is just not that pleasant. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and a little light. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this is not a good beer at all. Would not seek this out again."
"O: It's a little dry/tart for my personal preferences, but it's still a decent red ale. I probably won't go out searching for this beer, but if I'm at a store with a limited variety or at a friend's place, I wouldn't mind picking it up again."
"Slightly sour note picked up, cherries, raisins, woody....Interesting brew, moderate complexity. Toffee malts come through loud and clear. Moderate, drying hop bite late. Not bad, but unlikely I'd go for this one too often..."
"Taste begins sweet, sour cherries in the middle, with a lightly chalky close. More sour than would hope/expect. Mouthfeel is average, and drinkability is okay. Not sure what is up with the sour, but since it was only in-state for a limited amount of time, I have to assume that this is what it should be."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, drinkable and interesting but not my favorite from Short's by a longshot."
"Drinkability: It's quite good. While I prefer a bit more of a hop presence, this is very smooth and thirst quenching. Perfect for a hot day...or anytime really."
"The beer is sweet and not much else. I guess it doesn't taste bad it is just a bland plain Irish red ale. Nothing to see here, move on."
"Described on the bottle as a ""Dark Red London Style Ale", this is a classic Irish ale with a little more complexity than most. It is a few notches below Great Lakes Brewing's version."
"Has signs of infection, but somehow I think it's meant to taste this way. Not terrible, but tastes incredibly off, not enjoyable."
"O - A good little brew. Quality Red with great characteristics. Good brew in a good trade! Thank you Another6pack!"
"Slightly sweeter than the smell would suggest. There's an element of fresh blackberries. Decent hop presence but it is subtle. The aftertaste is sour but short-lived. Decent body."
"Not a fan of this beer. I continue to be baffled why some folks go crazy over Shorts. Frankly, I just don’t get it."
"Hard to rate overall as I'm not that familiar with the style. On it's own terms, it is flavorful, though I'm not sure all the flavors are desirable."
"Medium body and carbonation, super smooth and easy drinking. It looks like some other people have had issues with this being infected, but my bottle was spot on. I enjoyed the fruit integration with the malty backbone - would definitely drink again."
"O: I wouldn't seek this out, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Enjoyed on 3/17/11 in a Pint glass. Pours reddish amber. Foggy with a dense foam, unfortunately brief. No lacing at all. Very perfumed aromas in nose, memories of oranges & coriander. Sweet citric flavor. Tartar aftertaste. Light body but difficult to drink, fat in mouth. At first sight it promised much more than it has been."
"o - Categorized on this site as Irish Red Ale, the bottle says Dark Red London Style Ale, I call it candy beer. Perhaps this is what Homer Simpson meant when he asked Apu for skittle-brau? This beer is candy in a bottle. I dig it. I could drink this again and again and wished I had a few more of these. I am surprised that every review isn't glowing on this one. Kind of like a sour and quite tasty. A standout from Short's for sure."
"Overall its a beer that won't make you rush out to buy more but it won't make you totally disappointed that you bought it in the first place. Take that as it may be..."
"Overall (Drinkability): It's not generally a style I'm a fan of, but I will admit for what it is, it's good. That being said, I don't think I would want any more simply because this isn't a style of beer I generally drink. Give me an IPA..."
"Thanks to funkyaudio for the extra! Poured from 12oz bottle (no date stamp) into a snifter glass. Pours deep red with a staying, frothy, off-white head. Aroma has red berries, primarily red currants, some dry tartness, caramel and a sulphuric hint. Flavor is flat, thin, fruity tart, lots of berries, tastes like it's mildly infected. So-so carbonation, thin and dry. Fine finish, though, with some milky chocolate and mild bitterness. It is unfortunately a below par brew."
"Overall: I love the complexity of this brew with the dark fruit and malt combo. Glad I got a six. Not sure how true to the style this one is as I get no tea flavors, but it tastes amazing."
"D - I enjoyed the first of the beer, but made me pucker midway through."
"A great Irish red, one I would drink more than one of. I may seek out a sixer of this for next st. Patty day. Nothing extravagent, pretty basic, but the bodty sparks my interest, Im not use to irish style beers to have this much depth, and that's what im looking for."
"Ho hum. Tastes like an average homebrew. Probably wouldn't get it again."
"Here's a nice surprise-- something that is usually not sold outside of Michigan yet I managed to snag a bottle in corseted Belmont, MA, courtesy of the surplus from the Extreme Beer Fest. Deep red in color, roughly fizzy and toasted just enough to emit fumes of coffee and a little root beer (?); also green apples. Very dry finish as well. A decent beer that offers some of the flavors of a good stout without the weight of same."
"Thanks to schmittymack for bringing this one over to the house last Saturday night. Bottle poured a clear dark reddish amber with a lingering ring of amber foam. Aromas of carmel, light fruittiness and light earthiness. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors ofcarmel, light fruittiness and light earthiness with a crisp lingering fruity finish."
"DB- The first few sips to me were very promising. The more I consumed, the more the tart cherry flavor built with an almost medicinal feel. What I thought was gonna be very good turned out decent in the end."
"I guess the category is ""overall"" and not ""drinkability"" anymore. As with most Short's brews, I'd definitely try them on tap first before confirming 100% if I really like it or not....however as for bottles, I don't I grab another bottle of this. Availability is kinda low as they're only found in MI."
"O: Nothing offensive here, certainly easy drinking. On the other hand its really rather bland and boring. Normally this wouldn't be all that terrible, but you come to expect a certain profile from Short's and this doesn't live up to your hopes."
"Overall not bad, nothing special, just a typical reddish ale, with a decent hop base and decent malts, very drinkable, but with a slight sticky finish."
"The CPJ"
"O - Overall, nothing special for me. It's fine, ok, not bad - just not that impressive. If at a bar and this is available I probably would not get unless it is facing off against the macro crowd and not much else. Its not at all offensive, just not that interesting either."
"A pub sipper. You can't blast thru this, and this is not a thirst quencher. Not a match really for food either. Very good and unique."
"D-This was one of the best reds I've had. I thought the flavors blended together well and made me want another sip each time. Most reds take a little lip-smacking between sips, but this one was pleasant"
"Bottle from Champagne's seasonals. Reddish tinge. The head dissapears quickly. Neutral smell. Creamy mouthfeel, however, the sourness I associate with this brewery was everpresent in the finish, and added and subtracted to the experience. I would rather it was not there. A malt experience nevertheless."
"overall not a bad beer glad i had a one off chance to try some beers from this brewery and not at all disappointed with my purchases."
"Pours a dark brown with cloudy glowing reddish highlights when put to light. Smallish off white head dissipates quickly. Smells of caramel, chocolate, sulfur, tart cherries, misc dark fruits. A rather odd smattering of aromas waft from my glass. Thankfully the raw sewage aroma that I thought I smelled after I first poured subsided. Taste is tart and fruity with a creamy finish. Mostly tart cherry maybe some plums mixed with some caramel or toffee malt flavors. Thinnish body, light level of carbonation. I don't know what I have here. It's listed as an Irish Red Ale, but tastes like a fruit beer. I would say its infected, but there is very little carbonation. It tastes ok if a little tart so how the hell do I rate this? Irish red this is not!"
"The mouthfeel was on the thinner side and carbonation was below average. Drinkability wasn't that good, it had some very strange flavors for the style. It felt very fruity and tart, which just didn't seem to fit at all. It didn't taste sour or infected at all, but something didn't seem quite right given the description of the beer."
"D: I can safely say, from reading what it should taste like, that I got an infected bottle. From what I've received in a trade, 1 out of 2 Short's are infected or gone bad. Very disappointed."
"Pours a dark amber with a slight off white head.  Smells are caramel malts, sweetness and a slight nuttiness.  Tastes sweet malt, slightly sour but as in lacto, and a nutty finish.  Decent finish, good mouthfeel and drinkability is pretty high."
"To my mind, i find The Magician to be a nice drink overall, however, i feel that a few elements, such as the flavor and mouthfeel, could be improved upon. I would not say this beer seems to be most impressive Short's beer, yet I wont say its the poorest, either. I would buy this one again, as it would make a nice session beer to enjoy with friends, and its reasonably priced at my local beer merchants."
"Poured a dark murky brownish red with a two finger head that quickly disappeared. The aroma was sweet and malty with a trace of hops. This ale was way too cloying. A rich malt sweetness that never allowed the hops take hold. From the beginning to end this ale remained out of balance. Irish ales should provide enough bitterness to balance the heavy malt bill. A strange, cloying after taste was evident in the finish. This a an ale to avoid."
"D: ill finish it, but i might take a nap in between."
"The mouthfeel was medium in body. I poured this one out. What a colossal disappointment."
"M/D. This is a nice smooth crisp clean medium body feel that is easy to drink. This is not a bad drink to have once in awhile, but this tea like ale just isn't my cup of tea."
"Drinkable, but there are many other beers that I'd rather have than this one. Damn. I really wanted to like this one."
"A very drinkable and enjoyable Irish Red from Short's."
"3.0 D: This isn't something I'd like to have another of, but my review is a bit harsh as most of the scores were on the border of the next highest level. In any case, I don't know where this sour grape component is coming from, because there is no mention of it in the description."
"Overall this was mediocre beer, Nothing about it really stuck out from the rest of the Irish reds, and usually shorts brews stick out. It was nice to try but I don't think I will be buying this anytime soon, but it is better then killiians."
"D- My first crack at this style beer. Not to bad of a drink, pretty smooth for the most part. Nothing really blew me away but could drink a couple of these."
"Clear, deep red colour with a thin cap of off-white foam that settled into a lasting collar. Sticky, spotty lacing. Malty aroma, a bit earthy, caramel, toffee, raisins. Mild to moderate bitterness, more malt sweetness, caramel, brown sugar, slight apple fruitiness. Medium bodied, lowish carbonation, decent texture. Decent beer overall."
"Drinkability: Sour caramel? What will they think of next? Not sure this was intended - interesting but disappointing"
"D: Not terrible, and different for sure. Probably takes away from what it once was. I see a few other folks also found the sour note, but I have to think it was not intentional. As I worked my way through the sixer it didn't really get more soured, but did became more astringent and dryer. Drinkable yes, but not what I think of when I think of some sort of British isles red style."
"I cant get past the Shorts yeast. Except for the IPA Huma I am not a fan."
"D: Good, but not outstanding. I would like to try it on tap, but I probably wouldn't buy it in bulk."
"D- This beer was a pleasant surprise. I noticed that people have been giving it average scores but this is more than a average Irish Red. Short's is known for all their crazy beers but this one shouldn't slip by. I personally could drink a sixer of this and am glad I live only 5 miles or so away from Michigan so I can pick up more!"
"D - uninspired if anything. lacks both any sort of hops for balance, as well as a solid malt base to build upon. half of a glass of this is enough."
"overall - very interesting with all the crazy flavors, but not particularly good."
"Overall- In a word, Weird. Not a drain pour, but I would not drink this again. I wouldn't even qualify this as average for the style."
"D - Not too drinkable for me"
"Also, nice malt notes. Mouth feel seems to coat well, giving a slightly creamy taste. A nice medium to maybe medium light body. I could honestly see myself being able to sit down and have 2 or 3 of these on a cool fall day."
"Big thanks to enelson for this extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a murky red-brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no apparent lacing present throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and citrus hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruity hops, and a slightly sour note. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good Irish Red. The slightly sour note was very different than what I am used to, but I rather enjoyed it as I am a big Wild Ale fan too. With that said, this one is worth trying given the opportunity. Seeking out... Not so much."
"I appreciate the thought in including this one, mothman, but this one was a failure."
"I'm getting proud of the beers my brother is bringing home from the store nowadays. This one pours a clear crimson topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuits, rye bread, and some strong-ish flowers. The taste follows closely, but adds a nice layer of blood orange flesh, bringing a whole new dimension to the proceedings. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light carbonation and a velvety feel. Overall, a pretty tasty red, which makes me even prouder of my brother."
"drinkability is ok. seems like the bottle might be off, but the carbonation seems normal and doesn't betray it having soured. might have to give this one another shot when i can find another bottle."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Not bad, but a little off."
"M & D: The off flavors ruins it the ale. Too bad too, because the nose has a really nice aroma."
"Pours a slighlty darkened amber with a little head and little lacing. Smell is of slighlty roasted malts, bread, light fruit, some hops, and a bit of caramel. Taste is similar, but a bit bland even though i'm getting quite a few flavors. Medium body. Okay drinkability. Not a great representation of the style."
"drinkable - yes."
"I could swear at first that the sharp souring/tart tang of this was an infection but as this warmed; it became more readily apparent that this was actually part of the flavor profile. It was definitely interesting but I don't see myself wanting to get into another bottle of this anytime soon."
"Deep reddish, amber color with a small head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Malty aroma with hints of caramel and butterscotch (probably a touch of diacytl) with some herbal and floral hops. What I thought was diacytl in the aroma is much more noticeable in the flavor. A little too buttery. Otherwise has a nice caramel malt base with some mineral and earthy characteristics. Just a slight sour in the finish. The flavor is just a little rough around the edges. The body is light and nicely carbonated. Nothing really stood out. An interesting Irish Red that misses in a few areas."
"Pours a cherry wood tinged brown with a little light tan head that has decent staying power but leaves poor lace. The aroma is both malty and earthy. It has some nice toasted bread and toffee notes that combine with earthy herbal hops to create a classic aroma. The flavor is malt forward but with plenty brown sugar, toffee and toasted nutty character. Dry herbal hops are also present. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side and the finish is equally thin, though fairly well balanced. The herbal hops really linger on the tongue, and I find myself wishing the malt was hanging around as well. This is not the most compelling Short's beer I have ever had, but it is still a quality product."
"D: Goes down easily, not too filling, ok representation of style, a touch too sweet for me to drink all evening, but a nice beer none-the-less."
"Drinkability -- As soon as I got a whiff of this, I swore it was infected. Upon reading a few reviews I found out that this is just the character of the beer: dry and roasty + tart/lacto + diacetyl. I typically like dry and roasty red ales, but this was a bit of a mess. On the heels of Bellaire Brown, this was a big letdown."
"Good, but nothing overly special."
"Overall: The flavor profile is way too accentuated towards tart fruits which is not what i look for in a red ale. Better than the Bellaire but not my cup of tea."
"Kind of an awkward beer -- I would probably guess it was a fruit beer of some kind in a blind tasting. Not my favorite."
"Overall, decently drinkable. The sour notes surprised me a bit, but they fit well with this beer for some reason and I didn't mind it."
"Overall a pretty darn solid offering here. Not the best I have had from them, but not the worst by any means."
"The beer is dark rust colored, about an 18 SRM, a little chill haze, and very little foam. The beer smells spot on for the style, more malty than hoppy, toasty biscuit-like malts. Same with the taste, although something more than malts shows up in the aftertaste, a lightly sharp bitterness that must be hops-based. The beer is a little sweet up front but the aftertaste is bitter biscuit. Maybe my favorite from the style, it didn't convert me but it was still enjoyable."
"D-Not a bad beer but the tart fruity notes really hurt the drinkability on this one for me. Nevertheless, an interesting beer that I'm glad I got to try."
"D - If the bottle was fizzy, I could say with certainty that this had been infected, but it wasn't and the contents weren't quite at the vinegary, puckering level of ""infected sour"". Still, I have to believe this bottle was at least partially infected. Perhaps this is what the brewers intended, in which case it's one screwed up Irish Red Ale."
"Not quite sure what to make of this one. Quite interesting. Wouldn't mind having a few more to compare."
"The pour is a dense reddish-brown. A small (1/2 inch) collar of foam forms. The head is tan colored. The nose is delightful and suggests sour cherries and hops. The initial palate also suggests cherries, the middle is light roast and caramel with a finish that reminds me of dried dates with a hint of figs and some decent sour notes. The body is light-medium-light and the carbonation is low. The alcohol is not evident. Delicate Belgian lace forms. It is very smooth, bright, and dry. Somewhat moreish. I have put this thirst quencher on the repeat purchase list. Easy to quaff and not cerebral."
"Fairly rich toasted/biscuit malt aroma with hints of cocoa. No hop aroma or fruity esters. Short off-white head never really amounts to much. Slightly hazy light brown beer has an amber glow. Thick, smooth chocolate malt flavor up front with light biscuit notes. The flavor sort of disappears towards the finish. Not really fruity, and no hop flavor or bitterness. Mostly cocoa. Moderately light carbonation and medium body make it easy to drink. A solid beer that is quite easy to drink. Thanks to Erik for bringing this one back from Bellaire."
"I knew from the pour that The Magician would have a pretty low carbonation level. It's not quite still, but it's pretty close. Fine by me. The texture borders on being syrupy. Smooth and slick, it's an easy drinker, even if the flavors may be a bit of a challenge (or off-putting altogether) to some. A pretty good beer to accompany the debut of Stephen Strasburg...probably the first time that anyone watching a Washington Nationals game consumed alcohol without intending to drown sorrows or liven things up."
"D: If it weren't for all of the other reviews posting similar experiences, I would swear that this is a bad batch. Way too much diacetyl, and there is also the weird twang. I don't know what it is, but it has no place being there. Their goal was to let the malts take the stage, but they failed."
"The flavor, which is what really matters anyway, do have a lot more pronounced things going on. Caramel and crystal malt are the first thing on the taste buds. They warm everything right up. The middle has brings out raisins and dark cherries and the back end has noticeable smokiness and white pepper to it."
"M/D: Decently drinkable in spite of the over sweetness"
"Another winner from the good people at Short's! Very drinkable..."
"Also, Michigan has a bunch of great brewers... I'm vacationing here for the first time and love the variety."
"D-this is actually making me nautious. too syrupy and thick without enough carb to balance, tastes like caugh syrupy and diacetyl with lactic acid underneath. drain pour."
"Overall, I found this beer unenjoyable and just not working together at all. I don't think this is a bad bottle in any way, there were just too many combinations that didn't work well."
"D- It's a pretty easy drinker. Intruiging, yet subtle. It had an interesting combination of flavors that really worked together. I wasn't ""wowed"" at first, but something makes me want to try it again."
"I am very impressed with the Short's Brewery's take on Dark Red London-Style Ale. They're a good local brewery I have taken a liking to, and I'm pleased to say that they have not failed in this endeavor. I would absolutely recommend this beer to a friend, it would be great for a barbecue (I can see it going well with steak) or other get-together."
"This is a malty but tart palated beer. Like maybe a little vingegar fell into the mash tun. But still a flavorful Irish beer."
"D: A decent, but rather indifferent beer. Thought the maltiness might help it pair up with a meal, but the twanginess just made it clash horribly. As for the sourness, this isn't a Belgian-style sourness - it's much, much lighter than that. And its not a bad bottle either - the sourness is deliberate. Reminds me a bit of very very toned done NG Old English Porter in the way it seems as if some of the mash may have been deliberately soured."
"A dark reddish brown color body with a small short lasting tan head , medium carbonation , leaving lots of jagged lacing behind . Aroma is very malty , lots of caramel , toffee , nuts , dried fruit and a hint of smoke . FLavor is sweet with lots of character , caramel , toffee , rasins ,apple skins, wood , butter and a hint of chocolete , hops are not really noticeable but there for a touch of balance to keep this from being a total malt bomb. Full body , creamy mouthfeel , short sweet finish . A good brew and quite sessionable ."
"D: I was prepared to be disappointed by this after hearing some less than glowing reports from some my BA buds. It was pretty good. Not great, but good."
"Taste: Fairly tart, which is something I didn't experience when I drank one straight from the bottle. Don't know why it seems so tart in a glass, perhaps the bottle is a little off?"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a SA glass on a rainy afternoon. Frothy white two finger head, disipated quickly. Deep rusty opaque color. Smells of toasted molasses. As rich as this is, I was suprised to find no lacing on the glass. Light carbonation with some richness in the mouthfeel. Taste citrus, hops, caramel?....definitely citrus with sweet then hops. Overall solid amber ale. As usual not let down, even with the high expectations I have from Short's!!"
"Poor feel, not an easy drinker."
"This ones tasting pretty fresh with some proofing dough coming through on the nose, although the the butter on the palate is a turnoff for me. Otherwise a sessionable brew as long as those cherries stay in check and don't ramp up into an infection."
"Overall- Not too sure what to think of this brew- Its the first Shorts brew that I have had that I am not head-over-heels about. The color and aroma are very intriguing, and the super toastiness/malt complexity makes for a fun brew, but it might be a bit too much toast for my taste, resulting in a lower drinkability score. No sweat though, I am still smitten for Short's!"
"D - Pretty good. Would go well with a hearty dinner."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, slight hop, maple syrup, and slight citrus. Fits the style of an Irish Red Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale hop, pale malt, sweet malt, hop, slight roasted malt, and slight yeast. Overall, a good body, aroma, and blend."
"D: Very good. I'd order a second and will probably buy six of these at some point."
"D_Low abv and great flavor.Could easily polish off a few in one session."
"Drinkability - Not bad at all. I'm glad the sweeter/nutty flavors are up front because I prefer a more tangy/sour flavor at the backend of my sips. This beer is surprisingly better the more I drink it. However, as with most of the offerings I've had from Shorts, this is sort of a ""one and done"" type of deal. I'm glad I was able to try it but it's not something I would go in search of."
"D- something very unusual for the style. not really my thing. i had high hopes and expectations for this one (and anything shorts does) but it didnt quite cut it."
"Taste starts with some doughy, caramel sweetness. Slight mineral water bitterness and some flint around the edges. Earthy hop flavor and hints of tobacco. Lightly toasted malt and hints of bittersweet cocoa in the finish. Medium-bodied with a dry finish. Nice and tasty."
"Overall, a great hoppy session beer."
"Alcohol presence is low, but the flavor isn't really pleasant. This is one of the few Shorts' beers I haven't really enjoyed."
"Not being familiar with the ""Dark Red London Style", it seems decent enough to wash down some fish & chips, but not what I would order with a gourmet dinner."
"Overall quite drinkable, a decent beer, easy to consume, and worth the cost of the ten-dollar sixer. Overall I just don't have a lot to say."
"Overall a good amber ale, but not great. Glad I tried it but probably won't go back for more. My first so-so brew from Shorts."
"D - REALLY DISSAPOINTED with this, I love Short's beers overall but this is by far my least favorite, I am bummed I have 4 more bottles of it. Oh well."
"D: Drinkability of this beer was good. I could sit down and drink these all night."
"D- A sweet, buttery beer. Not really a stand out, but it wasn't bad."
"I've never had a bad beer from Short's and this definitely keeps with the trend. Pick one up sometime!"
"Like most Short's brews, the mouthfeel was spot-on, the kind of thing that I strive to recreate in my homebrewing efforts. Gold standard for malt heavy ales, and lives up to its name as well, truly magical. I cant wait to see this on tap at my local, Bellaire is a bit of a drive from down here! I imagine that tasting it at the source can not be beat though!"
"The current version of the Magician has an ABV of about 5%. It's a sessionable amber ale. Remember, hops are wonderful, but sometimes a good malty ale is just as great."
"mouthfeel is creamy, slightly bitter, good texture and easy to drink."
"For an Amber, I would rate Magician a decent pick. I like Oktoberfest beers, and this reminds me strongly of that style. If it was available year-around at a bar near me, I would probably drink it semi-regularly, because it bridges the gap between tasty and quaffable pretty well. It's nothing remarkable, but I like what it has to offer."
