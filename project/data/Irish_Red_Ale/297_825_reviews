"way better on draft than, in nitro can"

"O- the taste and aroma are pretty bland, but its the mouthfeel that ruins this its like beer flavoured water!"

"No taste whatsoever. Weak consistency but still totally under my expectations. Bitterness is completely nonexistent."

"Overall: the best way to describe this beer is with but one word: boring. If it was in fact a premium 5%+ beer it would probably be alright. The right flavours are there, they are just way too muted. Add to that a price tag over AU$75 for an equivalent case of 24 x 330mL, and you've gotta be joking."

"Food match: I would have previously said ""Irish pub fare, stews and shepherds pie"" but now (at the new flavourless 3.8% ABV version) I say plain crackers with cream cheese for dipping... also make sure that cream cheese doesn't have any added flavourings."
"I suppose not many 3.8% beers really get me excited and this is no exception, there's not much going on here shes a pretty average brew"

"Not the grandest of rip-snortingly pungent flavours going on here, I suppose, but perhaps this isn't the venue for such a thing - the Irish, and we willing tourists and diaspora, if I recall correctly, use this type of watery sideshow as a respected moderator for their Whiskey habit. I sure could go for some of the latter, as a matter of fact."

"The taste is so watery. It doesn't taste like an Irish red at all. Of course, it doesn't advertise itself as one either. It self identifies as a ""smooth Irish Ale."" Mildly hopped water with a hint of grain is how I would describe this. Maybe it tasted better before Molson Coors bought it. Who knows. But this doesn't really taste much like beer. It's lack of carbonation makes its thinness even more noticeable. That mouthfeel of cold flat water makes it refreshing, but lacking in any beer-like quality."
"Overall, this isn't really the beer for me. It tasted fine, but It's just not something I'm really into"
"O: Quite honest Irish red ale. Typic pub ale"
"Overall - A nice easy drinking beer that is ideal for a session. It is along the same lines as a Kilkenny Irish cream ale. I could drink a few of these every now and then."
"Mouthfeel is smooth,creamy. A bit watery as the carbonation dies down. Outstandingly drinkable. A long session could be built around these, if they were drunk fast."
"Had this at an Irish pub in Toronto. Was hoping for a pint of Murphy's Irish Stout, but they were out of it, so decided to go with Caffrey's. Pours a clear amber colour. A finger of nitro-assisted white head is there and doesn't dissipate at all. Some very mild lacing. Some floral hops with a lot of caramel in the smell. Flavour actually has more bitterness than I remember, some sweetness as well. Creamy mouthfeel from the nitro. This is an ok beer, nothing special though."
"Notes from Old Chicago (2001): A beautiful pour from a nitro-keg. It takes forever to separate. When it does, it is a clear red-golden with a creamy nitro-infused head. The aroma is very mild. Much better in terms of flavor. While still a bit mild for my tastes, it has a definite apricot note that I rather enjoy. As would be expected given the means of dispensation, it is very clean and smooth on the palate. It lacks a certain richness but it's not bad overall."
"This reminds me of my beloved John Smith's Extra Smooth. Poured a beautiful deep amber with a creamy and persistent head. I didn't get much in the way of aroma but the toffee and malt flavour was really enjoyable. Carbonation is low and very fine. The problem with this is quaffability. I can smash down a whole pint before I can even taste it so drinkability is huge. There's not a whole lot going on in terms of complexity and it is a bit watery but this suits me as long as the flavour is there and though the toffee and caramel is subdued it's still there and balanced. Good but not great."
"D - A tasty irish ale, and great to have on tap. Nothing mind blowing here, just an all-around tasty beer."
"D- My favourite beer on tap at one of my favourite pubs. Very smooth and very drinkable."
"I have to say this was way too easy to drink - like flavoured water."
"The smell is pleasant and the taste is sweet. The beer is smooth and creamy, but it definitely lacks something - the taste is very straight forward and not too complex, which prevents the beer from being a really great one."
"Rather average, but not at all unpleasant."
"D: Even with its faults, it's a highly drinkable beer."
"D: This reminded me of a darker Boddigton's ale. No flavours are strong in this, very bland and pale. I wouldn't buy this again - maybe it's the style it self, but it's a weak beer."
"More sips revealed nothing intereting whatsoever. It's the most unrewarding beer I've ever sampled. I bought a 12 pack for Â£8, making each can only 66p. So I've no probelms in giving the rest away or pouring it down the sink. A complete waste of drinking time."
"Poured into a pint glass; translucent amber, with a thin off-white head, and very little lacing. Was surprised by how light colored this was for the style. The smell was predominantly yeasty, biscuit, toffee, and apple, while the flavor was exceedingly dominated by malt. The mouthfeel however was velvety smooth and medium-bodied, likely the result of the nitro. Felt nice enough to session, but didn't have the requisite flavor. I don't think that I'll buy this one again."
"Drinkability: This lacks taste for me, there just seems to be no substance behind it. The smoothness of the feel is impressive but without taste, it is sadly a sub-par beer."
"Nothing surprising, nothing outstanding, would not go out of my way to try it though."
"D-Overall a drinkable beer but nothing to write home about."
"D: I'm glad I tried this one, but it's not likely I will buy it again. It looked and smelled great, but the taste was a bit to meek for my taste."
"It must be tough to make a beer this bland and flavorless. The good news is that there are no bad tastes, but pleasant flavors are also MIA. This is one bland and watery beer."
"Drinkability - very good and I would definitely recommend. This is a bit expensive for a 4-pack but definitely a good beer that helps remind that spring is coming."
"bought this can at Somerfield's (british supermarket chain) .... not impressed by the smell: somewhere around not very fresh fish and wet hay ... I almost felt being at Billingates Market (the fishy smell disperses a bit after a while though) .... taste is creamy and malty paired with fresh hops, but not very powerful .... mouthfeel is rather watery ... all in all a rather below average brew ...."
"I tried this beer on March 15, 2008 at 'McCabe's Irish Pub' in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The beer was a nice translucent orange/gold colour with a thick, creamy white head that lasted throughout the experience. The aroma was primarily malt with a slight hoppish hint. The mouthfeel was thick, and creamy, with very light carbonation. When taking into account the lack of carbonation, the flavour was nothing more than malted water. One could easily drink 5-6 of these as they go down easy...on this day, one was enough for me."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the Irish red ale style"
"I wouldn't reach for another, but not bad, a sort of lesser evil."
"Whilst this is a great tasting beer, it lacks in other areas and this is evident in my rating."
"Whilst in Ireland I tried both Smidicks and Kilkenny and thought that these were both superior."
"Pours a deep red color with a solid finger of off-white head on top, nice and foamy. A very light touch of lacing. Nose is extremely mild, but mostly caramel malt. Taste is likewise, mild but with a fair bit of caramel malt. A little citrus. A touch of hops show up at the end. Feel is full-bodied and creamy, a meal in itself. This one was alright, although I wouldn't have to many because of the thickness and the general blandness."
"The beer pours a clear red with a thick white head that holds beautifully. The smell is sublte malts. The taste is all amber malts. It is very smooth. Overall though, not too drinkable. I really do not enjoy it all that much."
"Considering this beer shares my name, I was kinda underwhelmed with it. It poured a light amber with an inch white head that stayed throughout. Good amount of lacing on the glass. The smell was standard of hops and alcohol, and the taste was pretty basic. This was a smooth beer tho, so the drinkability is high. However, I think I'd reach for a Tetley's before reaching for this."
"Cheers!"
"Was foamy, otherwise a bit amber and nothing special to look at. Little in terms of taste, on the bitter rather than malted side, however there is caramel. Creamy mouthfeel, not too carbonated.Could not finish it. A bit of floral hop smell.Light bodied."
"Pours a deep reddish-copper with the nitro bubbles reaching the whole way to the bottom before they precipitate out and leave behind a very tight white head that is about a finger high. The head stays down to the bottom of the glass and leaves good lacing; classic nitro, except for the odd whistling farty noise when I opened the can. Smell is faint, with floral hops and some caramel as well. Taste is caramel and roasted malts, with a slight hop finish. The mouthfeel is pretty thin and watery, and flat as well, but not terribly so. It just lacks the usual creaminess that is the upside of the trade off between appearance/mouthfeel and taste/smell. The drinkability is very good though."
"If this was my local brew, I wouldn't turn it down. It's not, however, and I don't think I'd ever make a point of seeking it out or ordering it."
"I have had Caffrey's on draft in my Basement Pub for a year and can't find a better nitro ale to replace it. Although Caffrey's has little or no nose appeal, the head is very creamy and always super smooth going down. On draft there is a slight bitter or fruity finish that is clean and crisp. This irish ale is smooth as silk and enjoyable in quantity or alone. The best nitro irish ale I've had."
"Well my hopes were a tad bit too high on this one, but only because I was expecting so much more for taste. Oh well, wont have to buy this one again."
"Creamy and pleasant on the palate, Caffrey's Irish Ale is not bad but is , unfortunately, in my mind, rather disappointing."
"Pours a deep orangey gold color with an amazing tight white head. The head could almost pass for actual cream, and it sticks around for a while. For the life of me, I can't smell a damn thing from this beer. Had to smell some food to make sure my nose was actually working. Not sure what to make of that. The taste doesn't really taste like much, sorta like the guinness nitro cans, except not near as sweet. It's slightly bitter, and a very very faint toffee flavor, but not much else at all. Mouthfeel is great, it's really creamy, again, it could almost pass for real cream. I probably won't be getting this again. Even tho I love the mouthfeel and appearance, the flavor/scent just isn't there."
"Clear, light amber with an orange hue topped by a dense, white head of fine bubbles (nitro really helps out here). Great head retention and it leaves a thick lace on the glass. The aroma is quite muted, but there's some caramel maltiness, a hint of fruit, and some floral hops. The mild flavour is matched by low bitterness. Caramel malt and light fruit start things off, with hops kicking in towards the finish. Low carbonation (of course) with a light body and a dry texture, especially as it warms. This is a great session beer, especially on nitro-tap... not very complex, but tasty enough to have several."
"yeah, one of these is probably enough. its a fairly good beer, nothing that really stands out for or against. probably just not my style (and going by the description, i would say this is fairly close)."
"This is a very tasty beer and certainly a nice low ABV session beer. It's got all the good characteristics of an ale from the British Isles with the typical hearty amber ale fruitiness. A bit more hops and it would have been a part of the regular rotation."
"Quite drinkable but could become boring after a while."
"This beer lots really cool when it pours as the widget effect is one of a clear body emerging from a maelstrom of foam. Well, that is the best part as this beer is underpowered in all aspects. Needs more malt, more hops and more finish. I find Molson Canadian more challenging than this brew."
"Bought the draft can...nitrogen in the delivey....poured a creamy amber with a big off white head...virtually no aroma....taste is watery and non distinct with a quick finish where some hop bitters are slightly detectable...a very weak ale with a nitrogen can gimmick."
"The beer as its spills from the can a slightly hazy gold color with a prodigious and creamy off white head, and as it evanesces the lace forms a fine velum like sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is musty and sweet, fresh and appetizing, start is sweet and the malt personable, top is light to moderate in feel. Little carbonation and the hops quite mild also very dry aftertaste, a drinkable brew and one that used to be available readily on tap, but alas, I can now only find it in cans, mores the pity, a great change of pace beer."
"I found this bitters a delightful way to spend time in the airport."
"Someday, I'll likely give this another chance, just to check and be 100% fair."
"Not a bad ale by any means, very drinkable"
"Overall this is an average beer, made more sub-standard by becoming too commercialised."
"Price was expensive compared to other nitros so will be passing next time."
"Poured from a 440 ml can, beautiful creamy pour, especially considering this wasn't a nitro can. Gorgeous clear amber/orange body, thick creamy cap of a head that lasts the whole way down. Massive lacing. Sweet caramel malt on the nose, accompanied by pear and light flowery hops. Flavour contains a cidery apple/pear along with sweet, almost bready malt. A bit of hops come out on the finish, but are slight. All that said and done, the mouthfeel is on the oily side, and the overall experience is actually not very impressive. Far better English ales out there to quaff and save for session brews. This one falls along the wayside."
"""Hey Waitress! I thought I ordered a beer?!"""
"Light brown color. Medium head is a beige and foamy. Aroma is malty and very sweet, touch of fruit. Medium bodied amber. Rich malt flavor, slightly too sweet. Good balance of hops and malts. Rich smooth taste. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter."
"F."
"Made the mistake of following a Guiness on tap with this in a nitro can. The nitrous oxide puts on a good show cascading the head toward the top. The final appearance is nice with a deep amber hue complimenting the thick and creamy head. Unfortunately the taste and smell does not match the appearance; the smell is stale and the taste somewhat hard to define, but definitely leaving a sense of sourness. No hops are noted in the brew at all. The mouthfeel is creamy yet bland in its residual palate sense. Watery liquor taste. Not a pleasing taste to be sure; won't go back."
"I have had this on tap a few times,a nice creamy look to it with nice creamy head.Kind of a dark gold almost amber color.Smell was nice and appetizingly sweet,the taste was a little bland for the look and smell of this one.A little smack of hop will hit the farther down the glass u go.A pretty good Irish ale but nothin to spectacular."
"When living in England my place was near an O'Niels Pub, which soon became my local watering hole. It was there that I was introduced to Caffrey's Ale, which soon became my beer of choice. I am kind if biased, but this is one of my favorite beers. It was this beer that introduced me to the wonderful world and awseome variety's of beer that is available to us. I owe my eye opening to this beer!"
"I asked for a sweet ale, and this is what I got. Wonderful selection, I enjoyed it very much. Had another. Went back to the same place 2 weeks later simply to have another and was told it is no longer made. What's up?! I loved this beer. Wonderful aroma, exceptional taste, sweet (if you like that thing) with a delightful flavor all it's own. Slightly red or coppery color, would this be considered an Irish red ale? Are there any others similar?"
"This is a very good Irish ale. I'm not sure if it would be considered a cream ale, but it's very creamy in color and taste. Everytime I go to the local Irish Pub, I start off with this beaut. It's easy on the tastebuds and get's ya ready for the night. The head is always a nice thick cream color and it's real thick too. The seperation it does in the beginning is just like Guinness, which is another great beer in my book. Anyways, the finish is nice a sturdy, but light at the same time. It's not stouty or bitter, which I think is the reason it makes a great ""starting out"" beer."
"Great head creation and retention from the Nitro can. A pinky finger width head stuck with the beer all the way til it was gone. I was very impressed by that. Has a very alluring redish orangish color to it. If this beer were a woman she would be a supermodel. Flavor was good but disappointing. Tasted a little watered down but that may just be the style; I have nothing to compare it to. Kinda hoppy and bitter. Fragrance is a reflection of that."
"Wow what a different brew in England. I still am not a huge fan but the brew is improved on tap and fresh. It took 3-5 mins. to settle. Slightly sweet nose. Thick white persistant head. Sweet chewy malt taste with the usual hop metalic finish. This is what I dislike the tin-like finish to this brew. It was less watery than the can but still not a stand-out!"
"Tried this one in a steak house. Pours a light reddish colour topped by a thick white head that settles rather easily. It's a fairly refreshing beer with nice smell and i wonder why this Ale is not found in every pub in Cyprus. Only some selective pubs or steak houses have this beer"
"Caffrey's on-tap is less creamy than the nitro can, but seems to be more substantial.  A decent session ale that is quite quaffable.  (review taken from notes before Coors pulled the plug on the brand in the U.S.)."
"The nitro can pours out a beautiful looking brew... cascading creamy copper-gold, which eventually becomes translucent with a persistant thick white head.  The flavor and aroma are somewhat hoppy, but very little bitterness.  Overly creamy mouthfeel, bordering on flat.  This is a brew that is slightly better than average, but doesn't have enough complexity to keep me interested."
"Typical nitro pour, this one was lighter colored and not quite as pretty to watch as some.  When settled the head is 1/4 inch with hanging murkiness beneath.  A little sourness to the yeasty aroma.  Velvet mouthfeel, pretty good toffee-like malts and a trace more hoppiness than some.  Drinkable enough, but aside from Young's Luxury Double Chocolate, I'm geting pretty bored with these nitros...just not enough flavor."
"Excellent pour that started out butterscotch-colored then settled into the more typical Ale hue. Creamy almost to a fault, as there was not much of a beer flavor to it at all. Slightly tannic, and overall the flavor does not live up to the looks."
"A very good Irish beer.  Nice and thick although light in color.  It has a head that really sticks to the glass all the way down.  Very sexy.  A well rounded brew that is balanced in aroma and flavor.  Prost!"
"Looks very nice, with a thick cloudy appearance similar to Guinness, but obviously much lighter. No smell or special taste to speak of, but certainly not bad. Very easy to drink."
"Decent head, creamy, Caramel tastes, hints of homey and malt. It was way too watery though. bland bland bland."
"Sweet/fruity taste. Smells burnt but very very lightly. Creamy and quite drinkable although somewhat thin. These widgets are heaven-sent."
"another amazing nitro head, and plus it has pleasant burnt fruit like aroma that i always like, which translates itself to a faint grape flavor in the mouth.  pretty creamy and smooth, but with an extremely thin mouthfeel.  if this had some more body it would be awesome.  malts and hops are there but the watery aspect of the body really robs the essence of the beer.  chuggable nonetheless."
"creamy and bland, but i suppose its drinkable, but its creaminess doesn't really appeal to my tastes, had it on tap and from the can, they both tasted the same."
"This ends up to be a beer that needs to be consumed quickly. It loses its luscious texture the more the nitro pulls away from the liquid."
"I also had this hand-pumped in England; it was the house beer at the local pub, and it was smooth and creamy beyond belief, with a subtle caramel sweetness to cut the edge off the bitterness. I was thrilled when they finally started selling it here, but was quickly disappointed; too watery, and not much flavor, an average beer at best. Perhaps it's not fair to compare what you get here in a can with what you get there at a pub, though."
"Notes: I don't care what anyone says, Caffrey's is a fine beverage and so easy to put down that it often scares me. A Friday lunchtime favourite for my buddy Dee and I. We always have 2 or 10."
