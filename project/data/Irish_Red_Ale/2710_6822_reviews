"No lacing/walling at all, which is a huge hit to the appearance score, but I do like the color and appearance otherwise. Overall it's a decent beer, but I wouldn't pay $5/per glass for a sub-par beer when they have Green Flash and Firestone Walker on tap."

"Also, BJ's is a great spot to grab a bite and watch a game or ten. Enjoy and find a DD."

"Overall - Really enjoyed this red ale; the strong-bodied taste is a surprise after minimal odor; very nice red ale; would definitely drink this beer again; I can understand the fairly high reviews. Would have liked to see more head (but the lack of it might have been due to a weak pour). Recommend this beer."

"At Greenwood, Indiana location... poured an excellent deep red with wonderful head and very nice lacing. Huge deep malt scent with a nice tang in the nose. Wonderfully deep malty scent, with a great tang, and hints of chocolate. Very smooth, rich and deep, with no hint of the relatively high ABV. My favorite at BJ's."
"Pours a clear light brownish-red with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some slight fruity aromas. Taste is the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp on the mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good red ale but like the Nutty Brewnette the alcohol on the finish is slightly jarring."

"Would like them find a hop bill similar to their pihrana pale substituted for this beer."
"Overall - I thought this was a decent beer. It was on the verge of being a little too sweet, but turned out pretty well."

"Overall: A solid malty red ale."

"Poured a reddish-brown with a small, off-white head that left some patchy lacing. Basic aroma of sweet malts, caramel; toasty. Same in the taste, with nice caramel malt sweetness, mild hop bitterness, and just a hint of the above-average alcohol content. A little chewy with a slightly off aftertaste, but nothing intolerable. Medium bodied and nicely drinkable."
"Had this beer las night as a part of their 8 beer sampler. Overall, I have to say that the Jeremiah Red was my favourite. It had a deep reddish amber colour, which immediately caught my eye. There was a bit of head but not much lacing. The smell was wonderful with a slightly fruity aroma at first, followed by some malt notes and the slightest bit of hops. The taste was quite bold with rich caramel and toffe malt flavours paired with the slightest bit of hoppiness, which was riminiscent of the aroma. A slight bit of fruitiness but almost no alcohol except for a slight tingling. The alcohol was very well hidden for the reported ABV. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Overall the beer was well balanced and my favourite of the BJ's brews. Definitely getting a pint next time I drop by for a meal."
"D-Very drinkable and went perfectly with my burger melt, a high abv keeps you honest"
"Sampler actually brewed by St Arnolds Brewery in Sugar Land TX for BJ's . Pours a dark ruby amber with a nice white foamy head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, some breadiness, and light fruity nose. Taste is similar to aroma, with some hops. Palate is nice med body, good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, ending with a slight hoppy fruitiness. Overall a very nice and drinkable irish"
"The drinkablility of this beer is high I really liked it, I would go as far as call it a session beer."
"Pours a nice reddish amber color with a slight off white head which is about one finger in size and gives way to web lacing down the glass. The aroma is of caramel malt backbone with some roasted malt and hint of ever so slightly of hops. The taste has a caramel malt backbone along with a touch of roasted malt. In the middle there is a hop bitterness of wet hops and earthy hops as well as some dark fruit. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall this is a nice beer, it is an easy drink, its not as complex in the nose as i would like but the rest of the beer is good. It has a nice balance."
"D - No thanks. I didn't even finish the sample size. Time to move along."
"D: Very drinkable indeed I drank the whole thing!"
"A vigorous pour into a pint glass yielded over an inch of off white head that leaves nice lacing as it is consumed. It is copper colored. I smell roasted malts with a hint of smokiness. I am drinking this growler two days after purchase but it has held its carbonation very well. It is malty in taste and goes down pretty well. BJ's is not my favorite brewpub but the old lady likes the food, as do I, so I will continue to go there. Hey, it's better than drinking Miller Lite at a chain restaurant."
"D: decent beer, not at all what I was expecting. I simply went off of the Red Ale name without reading anything about. expecting an Irish Red, I got a bit of shock upon first taste but when I corrected the style in my head it allowed me to see it was a good beer."
"Srong toffee malts combine well with sunkist barley notes for bright caramel tastes and a depth of kilned barley variations. Dark copper-mohogany in color, this beer releases a thick, dense, barley-stained head that lasts the session and laces very well. The malts dominate the beer throughout, however there's a fresh hop flavor (piney and grassy) that only shows up in the taste, everso lightly in the nose, and struggles for balance in the mouthfeel. Alcohol content is evident with a sharp prickle to the mouth and light numbing. Confectionate sweetness accompany the barley notes from nose to finish, while always edging out the hops. Finishes with that cotton-candy sweetness and alcoholic numbness. Yes, bold for a Red which hurts drinkability but I like it for a variation."
"Probably the best Irish Red I have had. I am not surprised it has received medals. The appearance of this is beer is a light coppery color. Moderate lacing on the glass as it was consumed. The nose is excellent, a malty and ever so slight citrus hint at the end. It has a wonderful light malty flavor with a good hop balance. I had to go for two of these. It packs a heavier punch than most Irish Style Reds at 7.4% ABV. Without a doubt the best of the year-round beers that BJ's has to offer."
"D: Very dirnkable beer. A nice tasting choice in a style that has a lot of pretty average beer."
"The pour is an amber color with a reddish hue. The nose faint and hard to describe. The taste has a very complex malt character. There is a sweet, roasted toasted and caramelized. There is not much in the way of hops. The finish is clean and sweet and simple with hints of bitterness. Overall very tasty beer"
"Great malty brew. Back in the day it was probably my favorite. I can remember getting a keg of this for my 23rd birthday. Worst hangover ever."
"Pretty much like most reds except with a little more punch to it. The bitterness, as with most BJ's brews, comes on strong at the end. It was not as smooth as I would have hoped."
"A pleasant lunch at BJ's. This was a dark amber color, with a medium head and some nice lacing. It had a mildly fruity aroma. The taste was a little more malt than fruit, but still was a nicely balanced beer. I think this was a very drinkable beer, and probably would have enjoyed this a little more if it was the only style I drank at lunch."
"On tap at BJ's in Cupertino. Pours a clear reddish brown body, with a white head, good retention. Sweet malt in the nose and some fruitiness. Taste is sweet, malty, caramel and a bit nutty. This is no Arrogant bastard, but it still hit the spot. Finish is dry, and grainy. Good amount of hops for the style. Good drinkability for its ABV."
"A decent brew that I would drink again."
"Drinkability: It's a pretty good beer that is nice to enjoy with a pizza. I'd gladly have it again."
"Original review from 1/4/2005: This is another one of the standard BJ's beers that are apparently brewed year-round at all locations. Jeremiah Red is a deep red-amber in color with a small head. Smell is light and somewhat fruity. The taste is very nicely balanced with fruity notes. The finish is a little bit more malty. ABV is not perceptable at all. This is another very good beer from BJ's, though the taste is just a step from great."
"The mouthfeel is fairly full. The alcoholic content is blended well, keeping the drinkability high."
"Drinkability: definitely a high octane and malty red, but drinkablility suffers slightly with the higher alcohol level."
"DRINKABILITY: For those who prefer malts over hops...this is a well-made and easily consumed brew."
"The red is copper-hued little beauty a bit more red than most copper bodies. The smallish off-white head did some mild lacing. The nose is malty with hints of caramel and slight whiffs of friuty spice. The flavor is spicy as well with good malt presence. The feel is medium with a fine finish. Very nicely drinkable."
"Had this one on tap and then I got a growler to come home with me. It poured with a huge off white head that lasted for a good 5 minutes before it settled into a nice lace. There was not much smell at all comming off this brew other than malt, and once I started drinking I found out why. The beer was allmost all malt with very little hop bitterness and spice but it seemed to work out just fine. Everything mixed together wonderfully and I really enjoyed the taste of this brew. Like I said, I brought a growler home and most of my friends who are not into the stuff I get really liked it...so this may be a good cross-over brew!"
"Jeremiah Red is a decent, if understrength, beer. The 7.1% ABV came through a bit strong but maybe because the rest of the beer seemed to be coming up a bit diminished in flavor."
"Medium red color. Small head. Aroma is malty and sweet. A medium bodied red ale. Nicely malty (a blend of five different malts). Not too hoppy, yet it balances well. Malts are slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Pours a reddish amber color with a short off-white head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is dominated by sweet fruit with a bit of toasted malt. Medium-bodied with a big sweet malty palate with a touch of fruity yeast as well as some faint buttery diacetyl and toffee. Finish has some lingering residual sweetness. Considering the ABV, the alcohol is fairly well hidden. A nice red ale with a lot of complex malt flavor. Sampled locally at the BJs at 4901 Beltline in Addison."
"Originally sampled on 12 April 2002. In the past, I've never thought much of 'Red Ales'. Everyone I had sampled, didn't have much flavor. This one did. There was plenty of malty flavor to enjoy. In my opinion, this is well worth trying. Had it @ the BJ's in Irvine, CA"
"This particularly sampling of Red was from the cask with a large dose of East Kent Goldings to pick up the nose. Normally a bright deep ruby color, the cask version of the beer was a hazy brown with virtually no head on the pour. The EKG's were prominent as intense floral notes in the aroma while they lent the palate a lingering grassiness. The beer's flavor is a crystal malt chewy extravaganza cut by a strong tingling sensation of alcohol and american bittering hops."
"The beer arrived a very dark amber color with a decent tan head. There was a roastiness in the aroma that I wasn't expecting of an amber ale. The roastiness held over into the taste also. It was more of a stout in its taste, but a hair lighter. Which is to say by no means was this a light beer. This was very full bodied and flavorful. Quite tasty, in fact!"
"As one would expect a sanguineous color, the head portly and the consistency spumescent, tan in color and the residual lace a nice sealing sheet. Nose is sweetly malt, fresh and clean with a malt-laden start, top middling in its feel. Finnish is mildly acidic, the hops apropos to the style, dry lingering aftertaste."
"CHEERS"
"It's a good-looking red, and it's actually red.  The smell is a bit on the light side, but it does have a nice malty sweetness.  It doesn't taste bad, but it's nothing spectacular.  Hints of caramel and toffee are present, but the flavor is just a bit lacking.  The alcohol content was a little high and noticeable considering the style."
