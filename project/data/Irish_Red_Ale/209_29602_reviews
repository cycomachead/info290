"Inoffensive, easy drinking, boring.  Had way worse, but, won't purchase again."
"very good smooth beer a little bitterness not much could drink this beer anytime and more than one"
""
"Solid pull off the shelf."
"Draught pour in a branded glass in my local village pub. Appearance is a dark ruby-red with a creamy head, it smells fruity, hoppy and with hints of caramel. Taste is balanced, not too sweet or too bitter and feels great going down, not too heavy but also not too light with a light, not bitter, caramelly aftertaste. Overall his is one of my favorite beers and I do a ""BlackSmith"" when I want to transition to a heavier stout. Can drink this all evening."

"Auburn copper color with whiteish head; not much here to smell;lite bitter taste and linger;lite mouthfeel; overall, wet carpet finish."
"Super awesome beer it tasted like the sweat from a super model"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels a bit watered down. Not much smell. Might have something to do with it being poured from tap."
""
""
"Overall:  I really like this beer!  It’s not spectacular, exceptional, or even great, but it’s a very, very, good, solid malt forward, slightly sweet ale.  One of my favorite session beers!"
""
""
""
"12 oz. bottle from Cost Plus. Pours a reddish amber with a lasting off white head and plenty of spotty lace. Flavor of caramel malt with hints of honey and a pleasant dry finish. Balanced, clean and refreshing. The body is medium thin and lager-like, but with a creamy mouth feel. Not particularly complex but it’s not supposed to be. A really nice 4.5% ABV session ale."

"Pours dark reddish brown tiny head.Taste mild bitter after taste.I think this glass would taste better if it was not served so cold.        After the glass set and got just a little bit warmer it tasted more smooth."

"To me, this sets the standard for Irish Red Ale. It is dry, balanced, and has a wonderful aftertaste. I've tried other Red Ales that aim for a bolder flavour, but Smithwick's is consistently enjoyable. Overall, it is also well priced for an imported beer. This is a go-to for me, any it is in heavy rotation for St. Patty's day celebrations."

"Pours a nice light amber color with decent head retention. The smell had some hops to it, but also what seemed like cooked rice and little bit of oak. The flavor was a little underwhelming with most of the flavor being in the aftertaste. The beginning has a bit of bread flavor while finish has a bit of hop bite that lingers. Not bad, but nothing great either."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor follows with  those flavors as the beer is generally malty. Cereal grain and a decent body Lacking in flavor and then a corn-like flavor comes in. A slightly metallic finish."
"Dark red almost brown. Smell is yeast. Toasty caramel malt. Light mouthfeel. No head. Light carbonation. Sweet taste but not in a good way. I did not like this"
""
""
"Being from Ireland I drink a lot of this stuff. Light enough to guzzle all night and not have a banging head the next morning. Tip: If in Ireland ask for a Smithwicks with a Guinness head ;)"

"An Irish red ale that predates Arthur Guinness's famous brew, it is a pleasant beer that contains both a sweet and bitter taste at the same time with a fruity aroma. Ideal for those heavy sessions when you don't want a massive hangover. This beer deserves more credit in my opinion"

"On the once a year I drink Irish beer, I prefer this or a black and tan depending on my mood.  It's decent, just as the ratings indicate, but nothing outstanding.  Surprisingly low alcohol in this one, probably done that way on purpose so you can have several of them at a time."

"Pours a deep brown amber in color with a good 2-finger foamy head that stays around for a white. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of caramel malts and floral hops for the most part. A bit more going on with the taste with some roasted malts, toffee and slightly nutty flavor in the mix also. Slight bitter aftertaste that lingered a bit more than I would like. Overall, it was OK."

"I had my first Smithwick's while in divinity school last summer. It's dark full bodied flavor was the perfect beverage for the peppered venison tenderloin I sizzled up for supper on several occasions. This is a smooth, non-bitter, manly brew."
""
""
""

"This is a fairly light, sessionable and refreshing beer but with a good deal of flavor. Nothing special, but nothing overbearing or off-putting- just an all around good beer. Bought as part of a six pack for about $8.50 (on sale) at Hennessey Market in uptown Butte. Believe it or not, this is a fairly rare beer to find in these parts."

"O: An OK beer with little character. Drinkable but disappointing."
"This was an okay beer. I poured a Dale's pale ale through it and it tasted better. Tell you a story about this, my brother was in Ireland and his wife ordered a Guiness draught. When it came my brother's turn he said he would like a Smithwick's draught. The publican looked at my brother then at his wife and said, ""so the wife is having the Man's beer and himself is having the Lady Guiness."" That about sums it up."

"Clear dark amber pour with a dark ruby cast. Average head and lace retention. The nose is slight and has a slightly burnt aroma. Nice medium body with average carbonation. The taste follows the nose with a slight burnt malt off flavor. The finish has a bit of effervescence and the burnt off flavor lingers. If you want a red ale, get an excellent one like Green Flash Hop Head Red."

"One of my favorite beers at my place of work. We have it on draft which definitely creates a better experience. It pours a very pleasant copper/red and has a sweet malty aroma. Its sweet aroma transitions nicely into a semi sweet flavor that makes for a very easy drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"I remember really relishing in this beer before I discovered craft brews. Not so much now. This one pours a handsome copper red hue with a generous white head and nice lacing. The aroma is malty but unfortunately in the way of a mass produced beer. The flavor is light and sweet and refreshing but yet again carries the taste of the use of inferior grains(I.e. corn). Its a good beer and better than typical lawnmower beers....but not by much."

"Now sold with the modernized red label. Pours dark amber with a 2 finger off-white head. Decent carbonation with malty and slightly skunky aroma. Taste is metallic bitterness then turns malty and sweet. Medium mouthfeel with some slight grittiness? Finishes off typical of mass produced brews. Good but nothing stands out."

"Smithwicks pours a dark reddish color with a nice large lacing head. There is a rather stale and weak aroma but with some malty notes. The taste is a bit wet, but has a sharp malt backbone. Weaker flavors, but still there. Overall its a decent red ale, looks good, and the taste isn't bad."

"Overall: Like a lot of long-standing European brands, Smithwick's has kind of been outpaced by modern craftier takes on the style. Still, it's a very reliable beer, and I can't see myself every turning one down, especially on an early Spring day when it's getting greener outside and stout-and-snow season is fading."

"This is really rather lackluster. To me, this is the beer to get when there are no other options because Bud and Miller stuff at the gas station. The smell is so faint, and the taste is just barely there, but enough to tell it's a Red Ale (barely). I confess I'm not big on this style. I probably wouldn't ever go out of my way to get this. However, yes, it is drinkable."

"Pours a reddish amber color with a thin white head. The scent is of hops and caramel with a bit of malts. The flavor is a nice balance of hops malts and caramel. The overall mouthfeel of the beer was good and it was very well balanced. Overall i enjoyed this one and would drink it again."

"Poured a clear amber red with a one finger white head that receded to a white ring leaving abundant lacing down the glass. Pretty good for the style. Scents of skunked hops, caramel, toasted malt and slight nutty aromas. Not the best scent in the world, but not bad for a red ale. Flavors of toasted malt, caramel, some grainy malt and moderate levels of floral hops throughout with some slight nuttiness. The finish is semi-dry and toasty with a toasty aftertaste. Not bad, not extremely complex but good for a session ale, the toasted, nutty and caramel flavors are quite nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with medium carbonation and a slightly watery mouthfeel. Not bad for a session ale, quite drinkable. Overall this is a decent session ale. Nothing bad about it, but nothing amazing, its still a good enough offering. I'd have it again."
""
"Overall - I recall having this on tap about a year ago and it was a very solid beer, revisiting it reminds me that while a good beer, there really is nothing exceptional and would look to other offerings in the future."

"DATE TASTED: November 28, 2013... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky pint...OCCASION: kicking back--another Thanksgiving Day hosted well and right... APPEARANCE: cloud-evoking white head; solid dark amber body; slow, steady effervescence; nice, hazy lacing... AROMA: slightly fragrant with a soft, mostly malty bready dough scents... PALATE: medium-bodied; monolithic, flat mouthfeel; a bit creamy; drinkable, but not distinguished...TASTE: a bit of toffee mixes with malts to create a rather dry, basic ale--little to deliberate on or over...OVERALL: not a bad beer for talking over or complimenting hors d'oeuvres pre-meal; after desert, not much of a motivator or nightcap..."

"Draft poured into a pint glass. Little head and no lacing as you drink it. Nice medium brown color. Little aroma--just a bit of grain an toffee. Flavor is mild, not complex--grain and malt with a bit of toffee. Not a lit of hops, or perhaps it is a type of hops I am not familiar with. This is a style of ale that I don't know or understand. Mouth feel is OK, not creamy. Overall this was disapointinting--an OK ale but not one I would seek out."

"O: I enjoyed this more that the other offerings in this mixed pack. I would like to see this offered in cans on a regular basis, it would make me a regular customer."
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, not great, it's just a very quaffable red ale with no standout characteristics. Basically, it's one of those ""chug 'em and forget when you're in some faux-Irish pub"" brews."
""
"Nice Guinness sampler in cans this one appears a pale copper amber with a big highly carbonated khaki tan head, fine bubbles cling to the sides of my glass great head retention. Aroma has biscuit malts with a fresh baked bread note, very tame nose on it with a hint of herbal hops in the backend. My wife loves it and I'm frankly okay with this beer enough flavor to keep me interested. Bready malts hints of faint herbal hops well balanced mass produced drinking ale, you can't really go wrong with at least trying this beer especially well protected from the light in can form. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied smooth flowing natural carbonation arises across the palate, I know I like it. Overall, an impressive beer that I would like to indulge in a couple pints of without having to worry about whether or not it's considered craft or not it's an acceptable Irish ale better than most imports these days and that's good enough for me to spend my hard earned dollars."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very basic beer. The taste doesn't put me off, but there also isn't anything in the flavour that I would call really likeable or enjoyable. If someone bought this for me in a bar, I'd drink it, but this is not something I'd go out of my way to purchase myself. There are other ambers that I think are much better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"it smells like a bar, though. it smells like a typical commercial mass-produced beer. I wonder if they have changed the recipe? either way, I wont be buying this one again. there are way too many other brews out there with more satisfying flavor than purchasing this import from 6000 miles away. California is FULL of average grade brews.... and GOOD ones too!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured to a bubbly head, very airy, with moderate lacing and retention. Had a rich, ruby color with a mild, malt / toffee aroma. taste was a mild caramel toffee back with some malty notes up front. dry finish was a light, almost watery mouthfeel. Not a bad drink, had not had in a while and is not a good as I remember it being."

"Nice deep copper appearance with a tall, thick head. The smell and mouthfeel are understated and fairly flat. The flavor is the high point, but it isn't anything extraordinary. It tastes kind of like a very light Guiness I supposed. Definitely not a summer beer. Perhaps best on a very cold December night in Ireland?"
"The Smithwick's did not overwhelm. Lovely color, but comparatively bland overall. From smell to mouthfeel, just short of interesting. Paired with oysters on the half shell and the beer definitely could not stand up to cocktail sauce. Might be OK as a pure pub beer with low expectations."
""
"Very smooth ale. Hints of caramel, fruit, malt, sweat, honey, smoke. Very easy to drink, if its on tap, and I am in the mood, why not. Is one of my top go to beers if nothing else is on tap I feel like, and when you go to an Irish bar (down the street from my house) and you don't like Guinness, this is one of the best alternatives. I love to drink my setting, and this will do just fine for my Irish bars. Go Groggs!"

"Overall- A little above average. It's worth a try and is quite sessionable. More of a drinking beer than one you mull over. Probably won't purchase again as there are plenty of better beers (and styles) for the same price or cheaper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent, unpretentious beer that doesn't go anywhere as far as distinctive flavors go. It also seems a little watery. Still, a good thirst quencher, especially if you're not looking for hop or malt bombs."

"Great in appearance. Rich dark brown. Little weak on smell but pleasant. Tasted a little watery going down but after taste is medium. Left you wanting a bit more bite but still wanting another drink. Lacked that tightening sensation of the checks and tongue that dark beers give (light on the hops I guess) but ok. Over all its a good beer! Does not have an over powering alcohol taste like the IPA's. Not that there is any wrong with an IPA. Try it you will like it. Bottoms up!"

"I tried this irish ale out of the bottle and into a pint glass. I noticed the head is medium to deep depending on the pour. The color is right away the head turner, a beautiful deep ruby. Unfortunately it is a very deceiving characteristic. The deep color reminds me of fools gold. While the caramel shines through with woody hints, the power of flavor seems to be lacking. It seems the ease of drinking this red style ale is it's second positive trait. Think Guinness Black but with a lighter carbonation. I did enjoy this beer for its ease of drinkability and deep color but i feel the flavor and alcohol power is lacking. An Irish keg beer. A gateway beer for people that do not drink dark ales or reds."
""
""
""
"Overall – Not a flavor powerhouse but rather easy drinking and a good brew for the more session level of alcohol. Overall it’s rather well done."

""
"Pours a clear, dark amber with moderate cap of dense foam. Scent brings toasted and roasted malts with a moderate dose of caramel, light herbal hoppyness. Taste is quite pleasent, malt forward with equal notes of toast and caramel, light herbal and grassy hops. Little bit more body than expected from the ABVs. Solid, easy drinking."

"A pretty average beer. Nothing particularly unpleasant, just lacking in anything intriguing or noticeably well done."
"Smithwick's is one of my over all favorite beers it has never let me down in taste, color, and or appearance. It's a beer i find my self drinking when i just want to relax and enjoy my night. A: Nutty brown always with a creamy head. S: Smells malty but nothing over bearing T: The Swithwick's does lack on the taste a little but in a good way beginning it tastes very malty then just as fast the malt goes away to finish with a small hint. Nothing is left on your tongue a over all great beer if you're out for awhile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice alternative on St. Pat's day, i don't have this nearly as much as Guinness but its a good trade off for a full bodied ale but one thats a bit more bitter"
""
""
""
"Good dark color with nice foamy head off the pour that laced nicely. Malty and smooth, nothing jumps out as great, but nothing bad either. Just a good old reliable pub choice that I could drink anytime if nothing better was available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this to experience the presence of diacetyl and found it near the finish. Not off-putting and appropriate to the style, it made me analyze an old favorite a little harder. I found it to be an easy drink but not as flush with character."

"Received as a gift and I popped a top. The bottle appearance is unimpressive, who the hell is Smithwick, but it does say Guinness which I find decent. Smell, faint sweetness. Taste, bad hops and metallic brewing vessel, long finish with a bad aftertaste. Mouthfeel, thin but decent carbonation. Overall this beer sucks, I gave it a three on appearance because it is a bottle of beer."

"12oz bottle had a friend's house. Pours a clear light copper color with small sheets of lace on top. Mild sticky lace clings to the glass. Aroma of light citrus, sweet malt, husk. Crisp clean feel. Easy drinking with a good amount of bubble play. Simple flavors with a mild bitter smack. Some residual sweetness balances it out. Touch of fruit and alcohol as well. Not a bad little Irish beer. I'd gladly drink this one with a steaming bowl of Irish stew!"

"O: A decent average beer, certainly beats almost all other American tap offerings"

"The beer pours a dark, dark red, somewhere between ruby, burgundy, and light black, with a lovely white cream head that sits a fingers width above my mug. The lacing on the mug is thin and spattered across my glass. On the nose, the beer smells of sterilized caramelly malts with a touch of staleness. The nose is fairly simplistic, and not the most pleasant but not the most unpleasant either. The smell is a little cloying with sweet malt, but subdued enough that it doesn’t turn you off to the beer. The beer tastes very similar to the smell with sweet sterile caramel malts and a faint touch of bitterness. It begins with almost sickly sweet malts, but quickly pulls itself back with a faint hint of biscuit and more caramel flavor, which balances out the taste into the finish, which is clean and only faintly tingling with the sweet sterile caramel of the malts. On the mouth, the beer feels thin to medium body, with velvety smooth carbonation that reveals only a slight tingle on the close of the sip. Overall, this is a mass produced beer, but it is an Irish mass produced beer, and Ireland just seems to do mass production better than everyone else. Sure it is not as flavorful as some beers, and definitely has some almost-too-sweet flavors to it that are both sterile and weird, but this beer is generally very drinkable, and not offensive to the palate. It’s not a fancy beer, but it’s one that is easy to find and easy to drink, and it does have a hell of a lot better of a flavor than other mass produced beers. It’s a good drink."
"A decent enough beer."

"Pours a clear amber red color with a very thin white head. Quickly disappears and no lacing. Smell is very mild, there's a little bit of caramel and a hint of fruit. Taste is malty sweet with a slight bitterness towards the end. Medium carbonation and a fairly light body. Mouthfeel is slightly watery. Overall this is a decent beer, but just nothing spectacular. Not what I would imagine getting regularly, but worth a try."

"This beer pours a maple syrup clear brown with a 2 inch lingering foamy head, leaving substantial lacing. The nose is mostly honey with some citrus notes as well. Taste is sweet malt balanced well with hops and a lot of carbonation. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery. Pretty good beer although I don't have much to compare it to."

"From a bottle into a lager glass .Pours a dark cherry red with a two and a half finger head. The smell is of sweet candy. Lots of sweet candy. Unfortunately, The taste is of agave and tequila. I hate tequila, thus and so why it is getting the current rating that it is getting from me. The mouthfeel opens up nothing else, Just more agave and tequila. Sweet, Yes, Drinkable, Perhaps, Bad tasting? depends on whether or not you can drink Cuervo. The only beer I have had that tastes like it should be made into a liqueur, Or better yet, A tequila. I'd avoid, But I got the bottle for free, So no true complaints. Overall, A 2.."

"O: Relatively easy to drink but not one of my favorite beers - I think this one might be a little more enjoyable on nitro than it is on tap. This is just on the border of being sessionable - might be just a hint too bitter."

"I'm not going to do the ASTMO for this beer. It is average in almost every respect. I did like the appearance, with it's dark amber and full rocky head, but there was nothing else remarkable about it. A biscuity malty aroma leads to a biscuity almost malty flavor. Nothing grand, nothing offensive either. A slight flavor of English hops... EKG? Fuggles? I would definitely not go out of my way to drink this, but I would also be happy to see it among the normal lineup of BMC beers. I will add that drinking it from a glass was significantly better than from the bottle, as is usually the case."

"Dark brown pour, large bubbles, decent lacing. Not many overarching scents, soy and a hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is rather smooth, though nothing special. Lots of malt in the taste, and a bit of chocolate rounds out this average brew. It ends with a strange aftertaste I can't quite put my finger on."

"I poured from a bottle into a jigger. I got a four fingered head of creme colored head that faded to some lacing. The color was of an amber/tea color and very clear. The nose was sweet with malt and a hint of grass and lemon on the back end. The flavor was sweet with a tiny bit of bitter from the hops and a dry finish. The mouthfeel was nice, being bready and good carbonation. Overall a good solid beer, but not outstanding in any area. I will buy this again from time to time as it's very drinkable."

"Poured into a Guinness pint glass. Pours clear dark reddish copper with an abundant off-white head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. It's a faint smell. It smells of bread and it has that nutty/grassy type of aroma. The flavor is fairly neutral. There are flavors of caramel and it's slightly nutty. There's a slight back end bitterness. The flavor is fairly average. The body is light to medium and it's moderately carbonated. It's fairly easy to drink. Overall, this is a mostly average beer. I purchased this as a single and would not purchase this again as a six pack."

"Mahogany reddish colour, close to 2 fingers of creamy eggshell/tan coloured head, some rings of lace at the top of the glass. Smell is malty and almost cereal like, some nutty scents come off of this, lightly sweet toffee and carmel are present but are minimal, for the most part this had a fairly neutral aroma. Taste is a little better, cereal like malts, earthy and nutty flavours, light sweetness and caramel, light bitterness towards the finish, clean aftertaste. The nitro made this creamy and light but unfortunately also makes this close to flat, light carbonation and feel. A pretty ho-hum offering and not something I would order again unless of course I found myself in an undesirable bar with limited offerings like the one I consumed this one in."

"Overall – I really enjoyed this brew. It is complex, balanced, smooth, and highly sessionable. Honestly this may be one of the better Irish Reds out there, and I’m not a huge fan of that style. I’d absolutely drink and buy this again!"
"Smithwick's pours a rusty amber with one-inch of frothy, cream colored head that leaves a good deal of lacing throughout. Sweet malt aromas, mostly biscuit and bready notes, dominate the nose, with hints of caramel poking through as well. The same sweet malt in the nose erupts on the pallet before subsiding into some caramel and hop bitterness that blend perfectly to make this a very well balanced beer. A very crisp and clean finish is a product of a medium amount of carbonation and a creamy, medium body. Exactly what a Irish Red Ale should taste like."

"Overall: A nice tasting Red Ale. On the lighter side but good for the style."
"O: Still my favorite of generic Irish brews (Harp, Guinness, Smitwicks). Nothing complex but makes a great black and tan. I'll probably always get suckered into buying atleast one for St Patricks Day. Would be a great tailgating beer in the fall. Nice on a chilly march night."

"Poured from bottle. Has a nice large soapy head with minimal lacing. A nice deep, dark amber in color. Smell carries notes of caramel. Abundantly carbonated, but not too much.

"Presents a single finger of head with heavy lacing on top of a standard amber with great clarity. Smells initially of a fruity ale yeast esters but it is short-lived, eventually settles down into a normal biscuit malt aroma. Flavor is a grainy and biscuit malt base with an creeping rise of diacetyl butter in the finish, texture is light, crisp and fresh. I cannot find any significant hopping character in either the flavor or aroma, and this is fresh from the tap!! If only the level of butter was reigned in slightly, and some kind of significant hopping accent were present, this one would have been pretty great."

"I tried Smithwick's irish red at the Tilted Kilt today...good beer and good service. The beer pours a deep clear amber with white head that left some lacing on the glass.

Overall it is a decent beer."

"one of the better large scale imports. pours deep amber in color with a fluffy white head. smells like a cross between a guinness and a bass, malty and roasty and defiantly english in nature, although its not made in england. flavor is very well balanced, drinkable for its color, and fairly priced. finish is a bit dry, but it adds an appealing character to this brew. one of my favorite beers to take on the golf course"

"Light tan frothy head disapates fairly quickly. Dark brown yet clear color. Nice lacing down the side of the glass records every drink you take. Good carbonation with a smooth malty carmel flavor. This has been one of my all time favorites for years, but as my beer experiences continue to evolve I find it seems a bit thinner than it used to be. Still a great beer."

"Has more in common with a glass of Pepsi than a pint of traditional Irish Ale. Looks great, but the flavor is too light and shallow and the body only accentuates its flaws. Before you can find much flavor, the bubbles scrub your tongue clean. Not a terrible beer by any stretch, but it lakes smooth body, balancing hops and intriguing malt character that Irish Red Ales should strive for. I think its fair to say this is a ""dumbed down"" example of the style."
"O - Standard irish red. Good with food. While standard for the style, I'd recommend plenty of others."
"Smithwicks Irish Ale: I sampled a Smithwicks on tap during at the Minneapolis airport. It must have been near the bottom of the barrel, as the bar tender had to resort to filling a pitcher with beer and foam, let a glass of beer settle to the bottom and then pour my glass. So this pour may not be a fair review of Smithwicks, but what can I do. I paid top dollar for this beer, so I will review it as it came. There was a deep tan color to the body with light carbonation. The head was thin and off white with a good aroma of malt and some subtle spice. The Smithwicks had a great malt flavor tempered with a subtle bitter at the finish, some heft to the body. Overall a good Irish Ale, even when I got the bottom of the barrel. It went down easily, and I would have had another if it were not for my one beer per day rule."
"O: This is a very nice Irish red ale. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it is solid and widely available. I think this will remain a standard in my refrigerator."
"Pours a deep, coppery red with decently thick, cream-colored head. Low visible carbonation. Grainy aroma with caramel and bread notes. A hint of floral hops but not much going on there. The flavor hits pretty hard with the caramel malt, with some nutty and grainy undertones. A touch of bitterness and a sharp, cold crispness hit the tongue."
"Overall a little watery, bland and boring but above average. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"D - all in all a great beer. It's simplicity is one of its strengths, but it is by no means flawless."
"Overall - Goes down easy, a friendly beer. Still, its not as good as others but its something a little different that I can recommend."
"O: Not my choice, but not terrible. I wouldn't pick it up again"
"An OK beer but nothing to seek out."
"This use to be one of my go to beers. I don't get it very often anymore, but it sure is nice during the hot summer days."
"O - I don't know if I've had a beer that smells so much like its ingredient malts than this one. It smells just like a nice hot mash tun and its oh so clean."
"D - Very well rounded and easily enjoyable. I don't mind having a pint of Smithwick's every now and then, not at all."
"O- A perennial favorite of mine. Tastes like a more expensive micro brew yet is readily available. Very good session beer."
"O- It's a good beer. Standard run o the mill type brew, but you can't go wrong with it if you were at an irish pub"
"Overall: A little more bitter than I like. The aroma is non-existent. One of the better regular beers at your standard irish pub."
"Overall, this is a pretty standard beer. Nothing to write home about, but certainly drinkable."
"Overall - Simple. Middle of the road. Pedestrian but that is sometimes a good thing. There is nothing bad about this beer."
"an absolutely boring and uninspired beverage."
"O: One of the better Red Ale's I have had. Nothing extremely complex but it is still flavorful."
"Apperance is copper red with foamy head that lasts decently and lovingly laces the glass. Malty not bitter just slightly hoppy. A nice clean and clear beer with no aftertaste; one to drink several at a time of.(especially prevalent around March 17th.!)"
"Pour is a dark amber brown with a white fluffy head. Aroma and taste light caramel malts some yeast, fruity and grassy notes. Palate is medium body a light fizzy carbonation that dissipates quickly and watery mouthful. The finish is sweet malt, some yeast and grassy notes along with some light hops. Overall an average brew."
"Very dark, with an off white head. Minimal head and lacing. Can't see through this beer at all. Nose is fairly weak. Some yeast, fruit, malt. Not much happening here, and it's fairly one dimensional. Taste is slightly better, with nut and caramel malt added to the nose. Fairly smooth, and very drinkable too. Mouthfeel is smooth, but has a bitter component as well. Fairly thin and dry on the finish. Overall, this is an OK beer, but nothing special going on here. Can't really say I'd get this one again, but it's alright in a pinch. Cheers."
"Overall - I'd never had Smithwick's till tonight. I have to admit I expected a little more. I can't in good conscience call it a bad beer, but I wouldn't call it a great beer either. For an amber ale it's pretty middle of the road, and there's nothing wrong with that. As someone else here said there's a place for beers like this. With its low alcohol content (4.5abv), and overall average drink-ability it would make a good session beer."
"A good crisp red. The red color is nice and bright. The mouthfeel is terrific and gives it a terrific drinkablility at an Irish pub that you can't always get in a Guiness. The head is about one inch and has a sweet foamy flavor that belies that rest of the the flavor profile."
"Nothing bad here but nothing to rave about."
"D - Could use more flavor; not bad for a traditional style red ale from the UK; it was enjoyable and I could have definitely had a few more"
"Overall: this is a smooth-drinking, tasty beer. Its light sweetness and bitterness balance each other well, and its low alcohol means it is a good session quaffer."
"Rather one dimensional, but it's not a bad dimension. This is my go-to St. Patty's day drink."
"Overall, this is a decent ale, and given its safe, middle-of-the-road approach (which is not a criticism; there *is* a place and purpose for such ales), it's easy to see why so many choose this as their drink of choice. It definitely goes down easy, and could be quaffed in great quantities."
"Better than expected. More complex than some of its mass produced qualities would lead a drinker to expect."
"O- Good brew, but not great. I enjoyed trying it. There simply isn't much that stands out here."
"I've been meaning to try this for a long time but never got around to it until now. That's unfortunate for me, because this stuff is pretty decent. Nothing fancy, but a perfectly sessionable red ale; I certainly could have picked much worse for my 100th review."
"overall- a good irish red very satisfying"
"i think this beer lacks character, and thats why i did not score it better."
"A - poured a massive three finger head with patchy lacing - good rention - a dark amber colour with a ruby hue - S - malty, hint of hops, a little bready - T - a dry discuit, a stale malt, some bitter hops - nothing to write home about - decent carbonation and medium body - overall nothing spectacular and not worth seeking out"
"O: Decent Irish red ale. Nothing special – and a little watered down. Nothing I would keep on hand or grab again."
"Pours a clear amber color with a 2 inch off-white head that fades to a puffy small cap. Nice rings of lace form all down the glass on the drink down. Smells of caramel malt and maybe some fruity aromas. There is also a distinct herbal/hoppy smell as well. Taste is of caramel malt, bread, and a bitter herbal/hop finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a smooth and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and my first of this style."
"O - A decent enough Irish red ale and the most popular one here in Ireland. I often find myself drinking this in most pubs in Dublin due to the fact that American adjunct beers are all the rage here and no other ales are stocked! :("
"D: Smithwick's isn't bad, it's just not very distinctive or complex - it isn't even really all the roasty. It is, though, very sessionable and full of biscuity goodness; it seems to be relatively easy to get on tap around here, to boot."
"Poured a 3"" linen colored head. Body in masstone looks like brown tea but held up to the light it's really an attractive clear auburn brown. I got no smell at all from it, not even after warmed. Taste when cold was any basic BMC, after it warmed it had the slightest hint of the weakest of dark beers. To me this is another beer just built to look a certain way while having nothing offensive of any kind in the flavor to make sure it has mass appeal."
"This beer is really nice to have from time to time. The beer poured out as a really nice red color, the beer is clean and clear looking. The smell of the beer had a good malt quality to it with a bit of earthiness as well. The taste of this brew is good in my opinion, it's got plenty of malt and just a touch of hops to bitter the finish of it. The mouthfeel is very smooth and easy to drink. Overall I like the beer quite a bit. Worth trying for sure."
"As soon as I popped the cap, I was met with a small amount of foam coming through the opening. My gentlest of pours still created better than two thick fingers of tawny head with excellent retention. When they describe this as a ""red"" ale, that red is a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity, like an Autumn sunset. Drool! As the massive head slowly fell, it created some beautiful lacing. Nose was quite biscuity, not terribly sweet. Mouthfeel was medium and the biscuit malt taste was prevalent on the tongue. Finish was slightly dry and definitely refreshing on a breezy summer afternoon."
"Poured this Irish Red Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The ale pours a clear reddish amber color and produces a nice off white head. The retention is average and it leaves an average amount of lacing. The aroma of the Irish Red smells of toasted malt. The taste of the ale is slightly toasted with some caramel maltiness. There are sweet undertones and some hop bitterness. The finish is a little on the dry side. Overall this is an average Irish Red Ale."
"Whatever the case, this adjunct (syrup) ridden example can out-compete the fellows it keeps company with (macro lagers), but pales in comparison to the finer ales of the world."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown, with a nice finger of foamy off-white head. Grains and sweet malts in the aroma, with hints of herbs. More of the same in the taste, thick, sweet caramel malts, toasted bread, a bit leafy, with slight notes of dark fruits. Very little to speak of in the way of hops. Smooth, medium bodied, and very drinkable for a mainstream beer, and a preferred choice of mine for casual drinking."
"Definitely wouldn't seek it out again."

"Bland. Pours a nice reddish amber. Looks ok, but Irish Red? eh. Vanilla. Not in flavor but just nothing special. Certainly not bad, just vanilla. Tasted like many adjuncts. Actually, Corona came to mind when I was trying to figure out what this reminded me of. Next time, I'll pass."
"Everything about this is average. I liked the coloration and the head was decent, but is faded quickly. Smell is muted, taste even more so. Went down really easy; watery. You could drink this all day (and night) long.. Not impressed, but it was the best offering they had...."
"O: Nice, easy drinking beer that goes well with dinner or for just having a few pints."
"O: This is unlike any other beer I've ever had. It's not over-the-top with flavor, but still, it's uniquely satisfying. If I see it again on nitro-tap, I'll definitely be down."
"O- I was slightly disappointed; The bitterness really took away the sweet flavor it gives at first. Definatley an above average beer- and I was suprised in how many different flavors I went through. Easy to drink, thats about it."
"D: Better than expected. Why did I doubt Guinness LTD? Not a ""great"" brew, but certainly worthy of revisiting in the future. 3.0."
"O: Wasn't a fan of this one at all. The burnt toast thing was really off-putting."
"Not all that great, somewhat disappointing given it's from Ireland, but still better than average."
"M - Thinner but very crisp and drinkable. Very dry finish that leaves me craving another sip. Overall, fits the description of the style to a ""t"."
"Loose and delicate head, even if it tops out over three fingers, eggshell white, mainly microfoam with a hilly surface, decent retention given its delicacy, thick streaks of lacing, albeit razor thin. Trim amber color with a redwood brown influence, pleasingly aggressive bubbles streams, orange tint grows around outer edges. Mildly burnt character to the nose, like sugar left too long on the stove, malty with toffee, chocolate powder, carob, roasted chestnuts, has its loamy/earthy side as well, pinch of pepper, touch of unprocessed grains but little outright bread or dough, can appear herbaceous at moments, especially when warmer. Medium-bodied, foamy with a level of carbonation arguably above what the body should have to support. Smooth like fine sandpaper, you feel some grit and then it immediately releases. The sweetness seems frontloaded, cocoa and carob, cola, licorice, honey and orange peel before a momentary flutter of apple, pear, cherry fruit, then more biting grass and straw notes, semi-caked in dirt. Still, the carbonation ensures a creamier finish. Good pub beer style, likely better on tap."
"A satisfying brew."
"O For being mass produced, this is a great ale that can be found most anywhere. It is light enough to be enjoyed any time, but dark and heavy enough to let you know you're drinking ale."
"Mouthfeel is mild and smooth with fine carbonation and a little coating sweetness. The finish is all grain tasting with a slight drying. A solid brew that is easy to drink and satisfying. Other then that there isn't much personality to it."
"O: Not too bad. Rather average. I had the most pleasant memories of drinking Smithwick's in pubs when I was in Ireland and quite enjoying it. This was the start of my fondness for beer and now revisiting it over a year later, the taste is not as good as I remember. Despite that, my fondness shall remain."
"D: Despite the fact that I don't like this as much as I used to, still a very drinkable brew."
"D/O- Like a dark semi-sweet soda water. Nothing really to it."
"D - Slightly above mediocre. Worth drinking, but nothing terribly special. It's OK as a change of pace."
"m/o: again, nothing spectacular happening. a little on the creamier side, doesn't really bite at all, making it really drinkable. Obviously I enjoyed this enough to keep drinking it, even though a Sam Seasonal was looking at me all night, I stuck to the Smithwick's."
"Beautiful amber colour, clear but dark enough to be almost opaque. Subtle aroma of malt and caramel, followed by a complex and well balanced taste, and a clean but satisfying finish. Overall a delightful ""session ale""!"
"not a bad option for a mass produced beer, and a good option at bars without better craft options."
"O- It must be my tastes changing but this was nowhere as good as I remember it being. Easy to drink, but there's nothing that exciting about it."
"D: Decently drinkable, certainly not a drain-pour but also not particularly memorable."
"We did have fun pronouncing it properly. Smith'ick's. At least that's how I was reliably informed by resident Irishers."
"Decent medium body and carbonation, a bit creamy and smooth on the tongue. You know, this really isn't THAT bad, especially compared to other macro offerings at bars like this. I wouldn't go out and buy it, but I'd drink one if there wasn't many craft options."
"Poured a darker amber brown color with just a bit of head. Not a whole lot of aroma to it, just some malt coming through. Taste was not too bad, sweet, nutty, slightly bitter. Relatively light bodied beer. Pretty decent overall."
"Not a bad beer overall. It's not something I would chase after regularly, but it's a solid Irish beer and is very drinkable. The low ABV makes it ideal for longer drinking sessions. Worth a try if nothing else."
"Pours a darker brown color with a fairly thick, off-white head on it. The scent of malt is very evident here. Has a smooth mellow taste to it. Is very nicely blended so not too much of one item sticks out. I got a small cocoa/coffee hint from it. Nothing out of this world, but a very well made and drinkable Irish beer to enjoy on St. Patty's day or any other day!"
"Blandly drinkable is the best thing you can say about this beer. Oh, it actually looked pretty good, but that doesn't mean jack once you've tasted it. I won't bother with this again."
"Overall, this is an average beer. The flavors of the beer leave something to be desired, but not a bad Irish beer to drink on St. Patty's day."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a deep, amber-red color that is crystal clear. There is a huge, chunky off-white head that has reasonably big bubbles and remains for quite some time. Semi-sweet caramel and nutty smells on the beer. Super sweet and tangy malts on the tongue when you first taste the beer. There is a very subtle underlying hops bitterness that creeps up on the end of the flavors. It helps greatly to balance all the sweetness. Also, there is a roasted quality that reveals itself after the beer has had some time to warm in the glass a bit. There is a crisp and slightly sour bite to the finish, with a subtle caramel aftertaste. Tasty beer."
"Doesn't poor much of a head. It is dark brown in color. Somewhat see through, but not much. It looks very interesting. I smell some malty sweetness on the nose. Maybe some apple cents as well. Other fruits are possibly here also. Other than that there isn't much to speak of on the nose, pretty weak. Oh man, kinda disappointing on the taste. It tastes like an irish beer for sure, but not nearly as full as say a Guinness. It has a very nice crispness to it, but it just doesn't have that umph that some other irish beers have. Not much hops in the flavor, it's really all just malts, like I expected. Mouthfeel is ok, but like I said, not much umph. Drinkability is very high, but that's to be expected with an irish beer. Overall it's a decent and somewhat unique irish beer, but not as good as some other irish beers."
"O: Shitty, but not without its charm."
"M/D. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but leaves the mouth with a dry feel and having a light bodied feel makes it easy to drink."
"D - in right setting Yes , but would likely try something different in round 2"
"From the bottle. Pours amber with a very foamy white head. It kind of smells like a pilsner. Very light notes of caramel and malt, hops are very understated, almost non-existent. This ale is very easy to drink, but there's just not much to get excited about. Boring."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark red with a thick, long lasting, off-white head and much lacing. Aroma is of caramel, ripe fruit and grassy hops. Light-medium, crisp body. Flavors are some caramel malt and earthy hops. Short, watery finish. This brew tastes like a macro on steroids."
"it poured a dark brown with ruby highlights and a 2 and half finger head that died down pretty fast but hung around until the end. it smells fairly light a little roasted malt and some nuttyness and a little bit of grain. the taste is very similar to the smell but more pronounced roasted/burnt malt taste and a little bready that coats the entire mouth. this is a very drinkable ale not too complex but not too light on flavour which is a good thing."
"Its an easy beer to drink but I don't like the way it makes me thirsty afer drinking it."
"D - I have this beer quite often, and I go up and down on it. It is much better out of the bottle than off tap IMO. A well crafted beer for the most part."
"Overall, this is a simple, light session ale."
"D-Pretty decent..alittle watered down but the roasted malts that come through make this a decent beer."
"Brown bronze color with bone white froth on top. Smells like light malts, tastes light with lots o bubbles. Slightly bitter but doesnt taste like its from hops. Not to impressed with this one but better than killians irish red. Tastes kind of flat but theres plenty of carbonation... Puzzling?"
"A sessionable and serviceable red ale, appropriate for an Irish pub setting if Guinness isn't what you want."
"This is the closest beer i have had that is similar to guiness. Dont get me wrong guiness is in a realm all its own. But smithwicks taste is very close. I have had this also on tap and its just as good. This beer is best served ice cold, but then again what beer isnt>?"
"Very drinkable"
"Medium bodied for the most part though it does become watery at times, the carbonation is brisk and has a decent overall mouth feel; drinkability isn't a problem because of the low abv. This is worth picking up from time to time."
"This beer is pretty plain but I could have a good drinking session with it some day"
"Fairly decent for what it is, an easy going sessionable ale that would go well with rich flavorful foods. Not fantastic though."
"No reason to drink this one, unless one needs to hydrate and there no water in sight."
"Usually on tap poured into pint glass. Pours a clear dark amber-red with a dense white head that leaves plenty of lacing. Great lacing a matter of fact. Toasty, nutty, light earth, and light coffee aroma. Decent malty flavor with lightly toasted grain, light roast, and a lightly earthy bitter finish. starts with just a very light sweetness and ends dry with he roast and hops cleaning up. Medium bodied and creamy textured. Very sessionable if a bit industrial and processed."
"This has a nice color to it for a red ale. There wasn't much head after pouring, which was very pleasant. The aroma had a roasted smell to it that reminds you of a coffee house, as well as a caramel-like smell.Definitely a dry beer.I like to look at it like wine and think of what to pair it up with as far as food is concerned. It think it would taste fabulous with grilled or pan-seared chicken. It leaves a nutty flavor on the palate. I would appreciate this beer in a casual setting so that I could drink it slow and appreciate all its flavors. This may not be my beer of choice but I would absolutely drink it again!"
"This a good all around kick back beer. Dryer than the nose lets on. Easy drinking."
"D: Easily drinkable as the from the start to finish, the beer is not exactly lacking in flavor but it is not bursting with it either. Overall a very agreeable and that solid beer that I cannot see be unpleasing even to the those with a less discerning palate."
"This is really just like Killians, but a little bit thicker."
"M & D - good balance, served at a lesser than freezing temp, which is what most on-tap beers seem to be served at, and this temp worked fantastically. This is a very well-balanced, great tasting beer. I could drink this very regularly."
"D: Easy to drink but one is usually enough to get the picture and move onto something else. A bit more expensive than I'd like a macro-like beer to be."
"D: Really not much going on here. It's not bad but it's not good, it's just an average session beer."
"D - The lighter body and low ABV make this an easy drinker. Coupled with the overall pleasant taste, a great beer to keep stocked in the fridge. I always like to try new beers, but Smithwick's is one of the few that I'll buy on a consistent basis."
"D- A solid offering that may not be all that complex, but is a solid and enjoyable alternative to other brews that are produced on this scale."
"D--all in all, not bad, but not very good either"
"Found this beer by accident, was looking for a partner for a Black and Tan. Our local LCBO doesn't carry Bass Ale anymore so Smithwicks was suggested as an alternative. Now my beer of choice. Being of German descent i've always enjoyed German beers, Smithwicks is now 1rst choice"
"I didn't know this was pronounced ""smiddiks"" until last night."
"D: One of the good beers for this style"
"D: It's a decent beer. Nothing great but it gets the job done if you enjoy this style."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a mountain of fluffy tan head and copious amounts of sticky lacing chasing the beverage out of the glass. Aromas of dry roasted malts. On the palate a slight sweet carmel malt with a bitter finish. A smooth medium body brew with a desent amount of carbonation"
"Smithwick's has a thick, beige, whipped cream-like head, and a very clear, copper appearance, with medium carbonation. The aroma is a light malt, and the taste is mostly mellow breadiness, with just a touch of hops in the under-taste. Mouth-feel is light and watery, and Smithwick's finishes smooth and refreshing. This is a very drinkable Irish Ale, and I would recommend giving it a try. RJT"
"this is a beer that goes down easily. not the strongest, or boldest, but definitely a staple amongst the style."
"Smithwick's is the classic Irish Red Ale and is largely responsible for defining the style. Where the diacetyl is acceptable, and celebrated in this beer, it still provides an ill-concieved distraction for me."
"Overall, a decent red ale. It is both flavorable and smooth, would recommend a try."
"The beer pours a beautiful amber/red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, caramel/roasted malt nose with little to no hop aroma. It's light with a stiff dryness. The taste is the same. It has a very drinkable pilsner malt flavor with a touch of caramel malt sweetness and a faint roasted feel. It's light and easily quaffable; a fine session ale. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This isn't the most complex around, but these brews generally aren't. It's an accessible beer that most can enjoy."
"A quizzo beer, I thought I'd gone through all the Guinness products for review, but here I am. It pours a nice thick white foam on top of a red body. The smell i found to be rather faint in nature, but from what I could grasp I found there to be a slight nutty bread note with a touch of sweetness. The taste happens to be pretty standard with this beer. There is the caramel malty sweetness, no real hop character and but the faintest of roasted notes on the back of the tongue with this one. The mouthfeel is just a bit thin for the caramel flavor, but nothing that'll take away from this beer. This is a easily enjoyable beer one of the good beers from Guinness IMO."
"This is easy to drink, and if you can get it a bit fresher it can be a good option when little else is at hand."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty good beer. I could have a few of these. Nothing truly outstanding, but nowhere near horrible. Probably wouldn't want to make this my dominant beer, but if this were all that was available. I could make do."
"Drinkability: not a bad beer. It's sort of interesting and not too overpowering. Might be a nice dinner brew."
"In short, Smithwick's definitely merits a try. In fact, I may pick up another bottle."
"D - I prefer this beer when there's Guinness floating on top. but overall decent."
"Drinkability: I'm preferring this revisit in the bottle over my prior near-tasteless on-tap tastings. Sure, it's still kind of simple and forgettable, but a $3.99 six-pack was a deal this cheap jerk couldn't pass up."
"D- This is a good beer, rather mild in flavor but very smooth. Its a nice beer for a chilly day."
"Hardly an A+, but something that is a good staple to have in the fridge."
"The taste is a very fresh fruity one. Apricot, maybe apple, and a nice balance at the end with crisp hops. Great prickly mouthfeel and very drinkable. Go Irish."
"No complaints here, oh Danny boy. Pretty yummy stuff. Nice crystal malt flavour, caramel of course, light hoppy finish. Wouldn't say robust, but not timid either. Doesn't taste macro-ish. Sessionable, especially with the meat & pototoes crowd. Come back to Erin, my boy!"
"Smithwicks is probably one of my favorite beers to have at any time of day. When poured out of a tap there was 1 inch of head at the top. The color was magestic dark brown with a red tint. The flavor is pretty good although slightly bitter at the end of a sip. It is easily drinkable but only if you drink one at a time. It's not very good to drink with other beers. It does have an almoundy taste with a kind of toffee flavor. It is pretty exceptional overall and I highly recommend it. I will always have a Smithwicks whenever I feel like having a cold brew."
"D - Average but I would not recommend it."
"Pours a deep brown black color with ruby hues and a thick tan head that sticks around awhile and some decent lacing. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and roasted barley with some hints of smoke. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and roasted barley and maybe some wheat. Mouthfeel is very nice with a thick medium body. Drinkability is decent."
"This beer looks like a root beer float in my mug. Big (three plus fingers) whip cream like head of light brown bubbles over a dark body of beer. The beer color is dark brown, rating a 30 on the SRM chart. Smells like I want to drink it before I get a good smell. I can smell dark chocolate, coffee bean, wheat, some spices, and roasted wheat. Flavors are coffee, cocoa, raisins, lime, wheat, barley, and hops in a nicely balanced brew. Velvet in my mouth, need a little less zing. I have had this ale before and like it bunches. Oh yes I will drink this again. Very flavorful, yet not too heavy. Good buzz factor, but sets well in my tummy and no bad morning after."
"One of my favorite session beers."
"Pours a moderate darkened amber color with a bit of an off white head. The nose brings forward a bit of roasted and toasted malt as well as some slight hop characteristics. The taste is quite bready with some roast and a bit of hops. Moderate feel with good carbonation. Drinks fairly well and is a decent alternative at some bars, but nothing I'd really come back to."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. It doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't. It would be very low down on the list of ales that I would search out, but I would say that about most Irish Ales that I have had."
"Time changes a lot of things. I still have a ton of respect for this beer as one of the gateways into craft and import goodness for me. But, unless it's free again, I don't see myself ever ordering one outside of some need to experience nostalgia in my olden days far from now..."
"Great drinkability. A tasty Irish Red, solid enough. Dont get it that often, but always enjoy it when i have it."
"I find this beer to be very drinkable and smooth; before you know it, the glass is empty. An above average beer to enjoy with any occasion. A downside to the beer is that it's not as complex tasting as other beers out there."
"This beer is highly drinkable, easily could have a couple of these in one sitting. Good beer to keep in the fridge for friends poping in."
"D: Overall this is decent yet uninspiring ale. It's quaffable, but mostly because of its relative blandness."
"Like pretty much all Guinness beers, it's a macro at heart, but is still decent, highly drinkable."
"D- Not a beginners beer. Somewhat thinker then the ordinary beer, its made by Guinness which has a reputation for its beers to be on the thicker side."
"Drinkability: A decent, unassuming ale. While certainly not the best out there, you could do a whole lot worse."
"Every person has their own taste. This is the absolute best beer I have ever had. The color was a darkish brown red with a perfect cream color head. The taste and flavor of this beer far exceeded what I expected and left me wanting more. It was a heavy beer to me which is my style but may not be agreed upon my others. Overall perfection here in my book. I wouldnt change a thing, but thats all just opinion."
"Another Quizzo beer. We came in second this week (couldn't repeat, dammit...). It pours a darkish amber-copper topped by finger or so of ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises orange peel, light caramel, and light flowers. The taste is nearly identical to the smell, though ever-so-slightly caramelier. Not by much, though. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a nice brew (I've been drinkin' 'em for years, now), nothing overtly special and nothing very emblematic of Irish reds in general, but a tasty- and drinkable-enough brew to enjoy while rockin' fools at pub trivia."
"Deep brownish-red color with a pleasent off-white head that reduces to a healthy cap. Sweet, light, toasted, malt aroma with a hint of fruit. Light bodied with low carboation. Nice toasted malt taste with with very light fruit flavor with a dry, toasted malt finish. Easy to drink."
"Overall I was disappointed. Frankly, a big gulp, bolus to the gullett is best. I'll have a few more and see."
"M: Even at the beginning it is refreshing the felling change fast to a bitter intense not very cool."
"This isn't a bad beer. I haven't had many beers in this style before, but this could make me seek out more."
"D: Good choice went at the pub or any place really."
"Cheers!"
"D: This beer was first recommended to me as ""Like a Newcastle, only moreso"". The appellation is not without merit, especially when this beer is drunk straight from the bottle, which seems to dampen the sweet notes and accentuate the malts, giving it the character of an English Brown Ale. Smithwicks certainly shares the humble agreeability of it's English cousin, with the added boon that there is a far greater consistency of flavor and character between beers. I don't know how many other people have shared my experience, but I believe the clear bottles are to blame for the radical variation in that other beer. But I digress. Smithwicks is extremely drinkable, versatile, consistent, and tasty."
"Overall, I was very impressed with Smith's. I had this in a tasting alongside stella artois and peroni, and this beer was the best. It has the perfect bitterness, and only slight carbonation. Is it my favorite? No. Does it stand up very well against other imports? Yes. And the best part is that I had low expectations"
"I like that Smit'ick's is actually from Ireland. As appose to the Canadian Guinness of U.S.A., which taste nothing like Irish Guinness. Smit-ick's tastes the same in Europe as America."
"This is a nice solid ale. Well worth trying."
"This is a golden red colour, with a big frothy head, very smooth and creamy, almost buttery. There is some kind of earthy flavour present in the background, but overall quite a sweet taste, with a bit of a metallic finish. A pretty pleasant overall combination."
"A nice Irish Ale, i'll definitely order this at a pub sometime soon or perhaps pick up another 6-pack."
"Drinkablity is good. Certainly and easy drinking beer. Not particularly complex in flavor but not a bad choice for a session beer. I wouldn't mind having it again."
"I love smittys for a much cheaper beer its very good."
"M: Pretty smooth, not quite what I would call creamy."
"Easy to drink although not many complex flavors. I would be interested to know what this stuff tasted like before Guinness took it over."
"I had this beer once before this review and I didn't have a problem with it. This time around, I was not impressed. If someone offered this to me, I'd probably drink it, but I won't buy it on my own."
"The taste has a slight bitterness that you'd expect from roasted barley, with little hops presence. Malty sweetness is paired with a somewhat unpleasant metallic taste. Overall it's not a bad beer, but the off flavor puts me off a bit. The body is fairly light, and the carbonation is prickly. Drinkability is OK."
"Sampled in July 1, 2010. It pours more amber brown than red with a decent half-inch frothy head and a good amount of lacing. The aroma has a nice malty-nutty sensation. The mouthfeel is medium-thick with a honey like texture. The taste is on the bitter side with a fairly nice but lightly hopped ending. Likeable overall."
"D: Nice malt character and good looking beer. Pretty good in a style with a lot of average beers."
"I'd love to say that this was a sensual, satisfying pint and that I found all the charm of the Irish local in the (so-called) Irish pub in which I drank it. Unfortunately, neither could be further from the truth. In both, all I found was bastardized commodities that market the illusion of Ireland without the thinnest of actual veritableness or virtue."
"Drinkabilty is average, you will get bored of this beer faster than you will get full or buzzed."
"Poured a caramel brown with around a finger of off-white head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, followed up by a pleasant taste of brown sugar biscuit and more caramel. Quick finish with minimal bitterness or hoppy presence. Nice session beer, though it lost much of its zip as it warmed."
" It has a certain creaminess to it due to the carbonation."
"Nice combo of balanced malt flavors from lightly toasty with a hint roast to the broad spectrum of caramely flavors. Hops are minimal. Finish is clean. Pretty basic for the style, then again it's a pretty basic style."
"D: I found nothing holding me back from nice long drinks, so a ""5" it is."
"Drinkability: Pretty good but I would rate higher if it wasn't for the thin watery mouthfeel. Certainly worth keeping in mind."
"D - Not bad really. It has a pleasant malt character and avoid balancing hop presence. Nothing special but a reasonable example of the style and certainly not the worst choice at the kind of establishments where one is likely to run into it."
"The color is a combination of amber, burnt orange, and copper. There's a subtle sweet malt smell, but there's really not a lot going on here. Actually, there's not a bunch of flavor either. Some malty caramel, brown sugar, and a grassy note but not much else. It's definitely an easy drinker and mildly refreshing as well."
"Really, for the price, you can't go wrong. It's a good beer, not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better than it's price tag would suggest."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"D- I can most certainly see myself drinking more than one of these in a sitting. This is one of my more favorite beers. Everything from the color to the lace, to the taste is beautiful."
"D - pretty easy drinking brew, malty, decent smoothness, roasted dryness at the end"
"Smithwick's is a very clear, solid amber ale with a big, fluffy, frothy head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a dank aroma, like a cave. There is a light maltiness, light grassiness and slight funk to the smell. It's medium-by-light bodied; Smooth and creamy, with a pretty crisp, mineral finish. There's not too much flavor, but it's not bland. The light, grassy bitterness is balanced with malt that avoids being sweet. They combine to form a resiny flavor. There is a soft, wooden quality to it and a touch of musk. This is clearly a session ale. I kind of assumed it would suck because it's such a big name but now I feel like a jerk for never trying this before. I bet this would be great on cask."
"Drinkability: For a solidly full tasting brew, this beer could be imbibed several times over, but the excessive diacetyl is a little disappointing, though my opinion on it is so undecided that it could fluctuate from one pint to the next. Better than average, but not exactly good."
"M/D: Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Somewhat smooth and creamy. Pretty easy to drink, but the taste is lacking and not the best, so this does affect the drinkability in my book."
"Maroonish color with a creamy fluffy head. Smells pretty light. Some grain and light caramel malt. Taste is light. Some bitter hops, grain, a bit of caramel. Feels thinner, a bit watered down and slightly flat. A tad creamy. Not the best crafted red. Drinks easily, kind of like water. Average beer at best."
"D- Guinness once again fails to impress. Pretty pathetic excuse for a rich, malty Irish Red. Go with Samuel Adams' Irish Red, much much better."
"While the psychological effect of drinking this beverage in its homeland definitely ratcheted up the enjoyment a few notches for me at the time, I still find this to be a pleasant, sessionable ale. The flavors and aromas are simple and well balanced. The malts are a bit toasty, a bit nutty. There's a light fruitiness mid swallow before the fairly dry finish. A bit of grassy bitterness lingers. Medium-light body with a rather crisp feel and plentiful carbonation. Smitty's gets an easy thumbs-up."
"Drinkability: No...I'm not liking this one. It didn't go well with a meal and the taste isn't something I can see sitting and sipping, or even having alone. Maybe this one is past freshness?"
"An old favorite, and my default whenever I'm in a pseudo-Irish pub and need a good draught."
"D - Meh... I really didn't like it too much. One and done."
"Surprisingly thin for a darker ale but very drinkable. Just not anything super special."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and has a surprising amount of carbonation. This goes down fairly smooth, but is nothing very impressive. Not difficult to drink whatsoever, but not something exciting to drink. Overall a decent brew."
"Overall a decent brew, but the sweetness overstays its welcome."
"Small head that didn't stick around long. Very deep red color that looks black at certain angles. Very small nose that's mostly caramel malts. Taste is of roasted malts and a slight metallic note on the finish. Very fluid mouthfeel. Quite drinkable for style."
"Happy St. Patrick's Day!"
"All in all this is a surprisingly good very drinkable red ale! Just a good easily sessionable beer. I may have to revisit the other members of the Guinness family now. I'll bet this is fantastic with a meal as well... fish and chips anyone?"
"D - This is easily a very sessionable brew. There's a reason you can find Swithwicks on tap almost anywhere you go...and that's the ease of drinking it. It may not be the perfect example of an Irish red, but it has got its place in the beer world. I'm not embarrassed to spend a night at the local pub drinking this brew."
"Very drinkable, a great beer to pound with food."
"Overall, not as exciting (and way more expensive) than most Irish Reds you'll stumble upon. Smithwicks is an easy drinker, probably great for watching soccer matches, but I want an irish red with a bit more gusto."
"Drinkability is quite high due to it's light alcohol content and silky smooth characteristics."
"However, upon drinking it - it was just forgettable - not much flavor at all. Nothing objectionable, but nothing recommendable."
"drinkability- Easy to drink, but no wow factor here. Just a mediocre brew."
""
"Overall: I am disappointed with this seemingly mediocre product from Guinness. Maybe this is a bod bottle, but it doesn't taste ""bad"" or infected, just sort of bla."
"Once poured in my ""bayern mug"". Look: Bright red color, poplar white foamy head, very good lacing; Smell: Toffee malt and floral hops; Taste: Roasted malt, toffee, grains and pine hops; Mouthfeel: Clean, medium bitterness, light to medium body, somewhat creamy, medium carbonation; Drinkability: Easy to drink, soft, quite the contrary to the great Guinness."
"taste is sweet, heavily carbonated, malt, bitter hops in the background, little bit on the tangy side (soda water), and buttery in back, ends a little dry, and somewhat bitter."
"Well made Irish ale from Guinness, imported from Ireland. Competitively priced in Ohio at present, $12.99(+) for twelve bottles. Pour into classic Libby ale tumbler, it is a mahogany colored beauty with luxurious rocky headed foam. A deliciously direct taste. Unpretentious and balanced, very drinkable."
"Poured this reddish tinted beer into a pint glass with a fine inch foam that reduced down to a faint amount of lacing. The aroma of the beer was that of toasted grains and a faint sugary smell. The taste followed suit but had added flavors of a fruity and caramel tinting with overall flavoring of a charcoal or roasted malts. Overall this beer is a great tasting beer. One that everyone should try."
"Drinkability was average. Nice toasted malt flavour, but not much else to set this beer apart from others."
"Poured a nice ruby red with a two finger offwhite head that dissipated quickly to a thin film on top of the beer. Good lacing throughout. Aroma is very malty and grainy. Taste is similar with a very slight roastiness. Feel is medium-light to medium in the mouth with a crispness from the carbonation. Some slight oiliness on the finish. Overall drinkability is good with a sessionable quality."
"D: Simply average. More flavor than BMC products, but nothing special at all."
"Dr. Good, better than it sounds above."
"Buy Again? No"
"Almost no flavor at all. Some sweetness up front, no roast, no bitter no alcohol nothing. Blank. Its like drinking colored water. Oh well."
"D - Not bad. Goes down alright. Nothing very good about it either."
"12oz bottle poured in pint glass - mild malty aroma with hints of coffee, banana and smoke; perfectly clear rich mahogony color with an inch of creamy tan head, good retention and nice lacing; light-medium bodied and remarkably smooth and creamy with flavors of caramel, toasty malts and overall roastiness; light carbonation, creamy and gently bitter finish. Very drinkable nice tasting and nothing complicated. I can drink several at a sitting."
"Pours a dark reddish tinged brown color body. Creamy off-white head, lastingish. Good lacing. English aroma, malty, some dark fruitiness. Malty taste, that similar Englishness too. Some fruitiness in the taste, maybe apple or strawberry-like. Pretty refreshing."
"D - you can definalty sit down and and have a few of these with out getting sick of them"
"The taste is just good , it has a light hoppy finish. This is a session beer through and through. Thanks Lisa for this Christmas present."
"It pours very carbonated and the head is soon fleeting. It has a pleasant enough color and I was expecting a decent malt flavor but what I got was fizzy tasteless ""beer"". Not enough substance to go on about mouth feel and such. There are much better Irish beers out there for sure. $1.50 is no loss and now I learned.."
"D: This is this first irish style beer I enjoyed. Maybe it's the fact that there is carbonation in this one, or a better choice of beer. It's simple but good."
"Drinkability: Quite good, and I thought very refreshing. In that sense, it almost seemed more like a lager than an ale. Certainly worth keeping in mind."
"I didn't think I would enjoy this as much as I did. This is a great beer to sit down and drink a few (a case)."
"D: Not a bad beer, easy to drink."
"F: Finishes slightly bitter, a little spicy hop flavor, fading sweet malts, a little bit of that nagging not so tasty syrupy extract flavor. Finishes pretty clean otherwise."
"This one is a caramel brown color with a quarter inch of head. Smells of malt, and tastes of malt with a bit of sourness on the finish which was a little off-putting. Carbonation is fine, and the low ABV packs more of a punch than I expected, and while it's a drinkable beer, it's nothing special."
"A nice alternative to Killians or other Irish Reds. Slightly hazy reddish in color. Thin head with very little lacing present. Nice taste, slightly fuller than Killians. Excellent drinkability, goes down smoothly and very quickly was ready for another. No overpowering after taste. Definitely would drink again."
"d - easily drinkable but not a very good beer."
"D- Very drinkable. Goes down smooth, and no particular aroma or flavor attribute becomes overpowering. If only the nose and mouthfeel could be improved!!!"
"Served in a pint glass it has a small head that leaves ample lacing. The appearance is amber and clear. The aroma is mainly of the malts with no detectable hops. The taste is mildly bitter with moderately sweet malt. The feel is light bodied with moderate carbonation. It's a refreshing and less filling ale."
"Very drinkable and comfortable brew. Had another right after."
"D: May not be the Irish Red with the most personality available, but I found it pretty solid across the board, and quite easy to drink."
"D - Not bad, but wouldn't want to session. Not hoppy enough for my liking."
"D - A nice red ale. Goes down well."
"Smithwick's is nothing I would go out of my way to track down, but it is a good session brew, and I'd buy it again. It is a much better choice than Killian's, but there are better alternatives out there."
"D: At a very low 3.8 ABV (on the side of the can) you could drink lots of this.... But overall not a lot going on here.... I think I like the American Smithwick's I've had better than the UK can version.... I will revisit the American Bottle and Tap soon."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. Would order at a bar if they had nothing else of note. Good session beer, with subtle, but quality flavors. Bad nose was off-putting, but otherwise, quite nice."
"you'll enjoy ireland's oldest brew...can't wait to make it there sometime soon..."
"I'm thinking this ones worth another drink from the tap at the Irish pub down the street"
"Drinkability: I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised; not inspiring but accessible and acceptable"
"Drinkability: I continuously drink this beer and feel you can keep drinking it for a full night versus other Irish red ales which can get a bit heavy."
"D - Very drinkable session beer. One that is typically available in common establishments like ball parks, Irish pubs and non-craft beer centered bars. Good standby beer."
"I will definitely have this beer again and pick up a six for the fridge."
"Pours an amber ruby color with a faint head that disappates very quickly with little or no lacing. The aroma is of caramel sweet malt but is rather faint, there is a slight grassy hop finish to it. The taste is much of the same the main flavor is a sweet caramel and toffee malt. I search for hops and there is the slightest hint of a grassy hop there. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. Overall all it is an average beer, it doesn't do much to make you want to come back and the flavor is pretty weak."
"Guiness should really stop charging people $8 a six pack for an $8 a 12 pack beer."
"Very mediocre and not worth what I paid for a six pack."
"Knock the carbonation way down. Get rid of the corn. If knocking the carbonation down hasn't already done it, increase the body a bit through some other means. Add a touch of wheat to get better head retention. ""Inspired by the original recipe"" my ass!"
"I'm not sure if I would order it again (definitely not at the price I paid for it...but I digress) because it wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special."
"Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this one just doesn't have enough flavor to keep me wanting more, but what is there isn't really that bad. Hey I'd probably have it at an Irish pub or whatever..."
"I could quaff many of these, no complaints here."
"Reddish, light brown body with a coarse head and sleight lacing. Dry, amber malt with a heavy body and remarkably smooth filling. Barely noticeable hop structure, medium carbonation (tap) to high (bottle) and floral, caramel syrup structure. Dryness contributes tremendously to the drinkability and smoothness of the beer. This is a great session ale that is heavy in body and color, but refreshing, crisp, and not filling."
"M/D - It's an easy drinker, as I said a good session beer, but nothing special."
"This is a session beer with a nice taste. It's not awesome, but it's way better than average."
"D - An inoffensive session red ale, with not much flavour to keep the drinker interested but easily drinkable"
"Drinkability: This seemed very drinkable, and even with the fizziness I did not feel bloated at all. I cannot imagine downing these quickly but over the course of an evening I don't think it would be unpleasant to have a couple of these. I would definitely recommend Smithwick's to someone wanting a bolder take on an ale, and I will be adding this brew to my repeat business list."
"The body was slightly thin yet solid. Drinkability was nice but on the dull side. You could drink several of these, but why would you? Overall a nice enough, if unspectacular, beer."
"D - I really enjoy this one and could drink more than my share. Drinkability is very high!"
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a dark brown with reddish tint color and a 1 inch head. Aroma is sweet and malty. Taste was rather bland compared to the color and smell. Not bad, but not a lot of flavor. Felt good in the mouth and is definatly drinkable. Overall a fairly decent beer."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The brew has a brick red color and a big fluffy white head, lots of lacing. The aroma is a bit musty, not much going on. The flavor is of a pleasant bitterness that has a solid malt backbone. Not a real complex beer but good for a session, fairly easy to drink 2 or 3 of these."
"On tap at ""The Local"" Irish Pub June 17, 2009 in downtown Minneapolis (formerly Old Chicago). Dark pour, thin body with hints of caramel, biscuit malt. Thin, just not a lot to get excited about in my opinion. Good session beer, for the right mood."
"Overall, this is a disappointing beer. All the flavour seems to be brewed out of it. It can be nice on a hot day as a thirst quencher with the addition of some ""red lemonade"" that counteracts the slight bitterness making a refreshing shandy."
"I'm not a big fan of the style but this was a solid option. Beats the hell out of BMC anyday."
"D= This is by far the best offering I have had from an Irish brewery. I really enjoy this beer as it pairs well with fish and chips, turkey burgers, and many other things. Highly sessionable."
"Edit - oh, I see BA gives it a ""B". Nevermind, rant over... ;)"
"Comes out of the tap a nice clear warm brown, almost mahogany, with a decent pale beige head. Aroma is malty with hints of caramel and spice. Flavor is mainly malty and has undertones of toffee and caramel, and just a touch of cloves. Texture is quite smooth and fairly fizzy and jazzy, as a beer should be."
"This one's not complex, but it's got a nice mix of hops, malt and grains and a good balance. This one's my favorite of all the Guinness-produced brews."
"Drinkability - Overall, I liked this beer. It probably won't make it into the regular rotation but every once in awhile would be great."
"Overall it is a decent beer was a good tasted but it feels like am drinking a Guiness Ultra."
"Drinkability: Nicely drinkable for a few pints but not much complexity here so it's a beer for socializing over and not for reflective moments. However I'll not be searching out this beer again with so many others waiting to be tasted."
"D - Nothing is overly offensive, but there is nothing outstanding either...it goes down pretty easy..."
"Over all , not very good. This beer is better than most macros but i dont see myself spending money on this beer ever again. The drink ability is above average based on its lightness, but its lack of flavor deters me from wanting to drink it again"
"D - a very drinkable and altogether enjoyable brew"
"Not bad but not too interesting, pretty average."
"I always get this on tap when I go to the local irish pub. It has a typical dark irish red color with a white head. It has a bread/carmel aroma. The taste is a bitter start with a smoother light bread/carmel finish. lighter mouth feel and for me extremely drinkable. It has a simple taste that is not overwhelming and for me is just a nice simple brew."
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear dark amber with a large, off-white head that clings well to the glass. Straightforward, light caramel malt aromas. Overall sweet character. Taste again shows slight caramel malt character and maybe a hint of hops, but nothing too apparent. Light-medium body. Not much character."
"Style-wise this feels more somewhere between an Irish Red and an Irish Stout. Surprisingly pretty good flavors: not monolithic, but not wild either."
"Appearance is a dark amber with a healthy head and fair lace. Smell has a lighly toasted malt, toffee and hop. Taste is a on the weak side that goes along with the aroma. Mouthfeel is light with a little slickness to it helping it go down with good carbonation. Overall it's not a great beer, nothing special, but drinkable."
"Had a pint on draught at Devlin's in Brighton Center this past Sat night. Even though this beer is on tap just about everywhere, I have not had one in 5+ years, so I figured on one for old time sake. Served in a standard pint glass. Brownish red color. Barely visible head. No noticeable smell. Taste was pretty average. A bit malty. Kinda tart in the finish. Very watery body. Not sure how people can drink these all night. Overall very boring. I have not missed much by skipping this beer for so long."
" D: This is a very drinkable beer that i order on a reguler basais when i go out to eat i would for sure buy cases of this if i saw it at the beer store."
"Mouth: Sensually rich feel."
"Loved the color of this beer nice dark red, but the smell was not too impressive, the taste is exceptional. This is definiately my go to irish beer or beer during st. patties. I think this beer goes great with any traditional Irish food like bangers and mash or a nice shephards pie. Very tasty and since I am not a huge fan of Guiness beer, I will be getting more and more of this one."
"D - Since this beer is almost not noticeable in terms of abv, flavor, and fillingness, I would say its a drinkability winner. Very sessionable. Heck of a consolation prize here."
"hey look, this actually quite decent coming from guinness/diageo. easy to throw back quite a few with some corned beef, a hearty stew, or roast game."
"On tap at Virtu's in Waterbury, CT, this well known brew poured into the pint glass a dark carmel color with a giant, slightly off-white head, and lots of thick lacing. The aroma is yeasty grass hop bitterness and caramel malt. Not too complex but decent enough. The flavor is very consistent with the aroma, grassy tartness with thin malt background. Peppery carbonation, fairly thin and refreshing, pretty easy drinking if you like the tart side of ales. Not bad but nothing exciting to me."
"D - Im getting a rather bitter finish but I specifically remember it being smoother than this the last time I had it. Its a rather drinkable beer. Maybe this experience warrants a revisit down the line."
"Overall a very easy beer to drink, and makes a good transition beer for somebody who wants to switch from a typical BMC product. I'd say this is a pretty good alternative to a lager for a BBQ/mowing my lawn type brew... Quite session able."
"I wouldn't call this sessionable. I like to enjoy my session beers. With the almost complete lack of taste, this is past the point of sessionable and nothing more than a pounder or a pre-gamer. If drinkability were just measured on how easy it is to slam a beer, this would get a 5. However, this earns a 1 in the enjoyment part of drinkability, so I don't feel too bad for giving it a 3."
"Overall: Very easy drinking sessionable beer. A little low on the attenuation, would like just a little less sweet."
"mouthfeel is crisp and this beer has good drinkability."
"This is a nice session beer as well as a beer that can be combined with Guinness for a black and tan."
"Drinkability - The drinkability depends on the drinker if you are like me and enjoy a beer that offers alot of different feelings in one bottle and you don't mind the aftertaste this is a very drinkable beer. I enjoy a beer that has the consistency of beer not water so I really enjoy this particular brew. All I can say is try it. It is on my top favorite beer list and is way better than Killians. I put these away in a pretty consistent fashion."
"D: it's bitterness as compared to some others makes it not as drinkable as i prefer, though it does taste and feel above average, it's a bit harsh for only a 4.5 ABV."
"very drinkable, fullfilling and refreshing. i like this beer, it may surprise you and it gives you a lot for the price."
"Overall: Mouthfeel is about standard, nothing special. Drinkability is great for Smithwick's I could put down this one all day. Wonderful beer."
"Fairly drinkable, but seeming a bit too hop-forward, though not in a good way and seeming contradictory to the style. Overall, not bad, but not something I would go too very often."
"Easily drinkable. Low ABV and good balance. No overpowering flavors. However, there isn't anything complex either. A good session beer."
"D: a nice change of pace for a St. Patrick's Day libation."
"D- Definitely will have a few of these today!"
"Overall not a bad beer, it seems like it matches up with the style nicely, so it might be a bit unfair to compare it to other styles of beer. This is a pretty good irish red. Enjoy it."
"Pours a copper/red color, nice big fluffy head to it that sticks around with a lot of lacing. Taste is pretty light bodied, nice mouthfeel though. Nice and malty, some caramel taste in there. Pretty well balanced and smooth, definitely very drinkable. The lightness of the body hurts this beer a lot IMO, but still pretty solid. For being a mass produced import it was much better than I thought it would be... it's St Patty's Day weekend... be Irish and give this beer a try."
"D: Great beer, definitely going to have a few more for St. Patti's day. Irish Red is one of my favorite styles and this is a very good representation of that."
"FYI - The W in Smithwick's is silent. For those of you who like sounding all intellectual and stuff."
"D: The beer is smooth, and what Smithwick's does right it does very well (roasty flavor). Its a sweet tasting beer, with a bit too much carbonation for my taste. However, if you're looking for a sweet tasting beer with some toasty goodness, this beer goes down easily."
"D= Very easy to drink and without compromise."
"Nice amber color with some head noticed and good lacing to boot. A malty smell in toe. Bitter in taste, sweet if you will. Gulp factor is on the high level. Medium bodied makes for easy sipping and a sweet pleasant withdraw of the malt is the star of this beer. A very drinkable brew that I will be returning to when available. This one caught me off guard, wish it were more hoppy, but you have to respect the style of the land. I recommend over Guinness any day of the week, cheers!"
"This is a nice all around brew, very light in body to the mouth but also creamy. The head never quits right down to the bottom. Very drinkable and with a low but fizzy carb. Yeasty aroma and only a hint of bitterness from its low level of hoppiness. Some tinny aftertaste that reminds me of Newcastle Brown Ale -- this is much like that but creamier and a bit sweeter. Recommended."
"I could and have drank these all night long. No problem. In fact my picture is from Halloween three years ago where I was drinking pitchers of Smithwicks by myself. The wait to get a beer from the bar was half an hour long so when we got up there we would just order pitchers for ourselves and drink straight out of those. Needless to say it was a messy way to drink. But a fun one."
"Poured a fairly dark brown color with amber highlights. The light tan head did not last long at all. I got whiffs of caramel and sweet maltiness. Malt flavor dominates the taste also but the hops are there just enough. Nice and smooth. This was a good nacho coolant, nothing special but kinda enjoyable at the same time. Solid irish red."
"The last time I had this, I made a ""Blacksmith"" with this and a nitro-can of Guinnesss Draught. Very good."
"As something from the Guinness/Diago family of beers, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I know it's likely to fall under that ""macro""/"mass-produced"" definition for some, but I actually think that this brew is quite good. It's similar to some stouts that I've had, but it's far easier to drink (if that's even a problem for you in the first place). I don't know if that was the intent of said brewer(s), but it's a good pick-up if you're looking for something ""safe."""
"D: I had one and switched to a brown ale with a bit more flavor. but this beer is better and most and a good session beer as well."
"It poured a nice dark amber/light brown color with plenty of white head. My sniffer was out of commission from a cold, sorry. It is rather smooth, has a bit of a caramel flavor very little bitterness, goes down good. This one is very enjoyable. I finally got a good one from the World Market International Pack."
"It's an average example of the style, and it's worth a revisit every now and then."
"Ahh, Schmidt-icks...my old friend."
"This is a stellar session ale, one I will continue to enjoy when in UK/Irish-theme pub land. It's also amusing/confounding to ask for this at the typical locations, in the manner in which the Irish pronounce it, and getting blank stares."
"Fairly watery roasted and toasted malt flavor profile. Overly carbonated and lager-esqe mouthfeel. It is actually pretty unoffensive and has just enough flavor to keep it somewhat interesting. A decent Irish poundable beer. Pint after pint is easily attainable with Smithy's...not bad at all."
"notes: the real weak spots in this beer are the lack of flavor and mouthfeel. otherwise it really isn't all that bad, but nothing special."
"Drinkability - good character, willing to have a few of these."
"Was a little light bodied but carbonation was perfect. Drinkability was higher and i was surprised to find myself wanting another, I even recomended it to another at the table."
"The taste of Smithwicks is somewhat sweet up front. Throughout the middle I can taste the toasted almost burnt malt. It definitely has a grain background reminiscent of bread or wheat. You get a slight hoppy bitterness in the end which balances well with the malt. Smithwicks is a medium-bodied brew which is easy to drink and finished smooth."
"Smithwick's poured a dark amber, almost brown, with a very nice tan head. The smell was of light caramel and faint hops. Taste was very nice with hints of caramel, brown sugar, and slight hoppy citrus bight. Mouthfeel was ok, maybe a little less carbonation would be nice. Drinkability was nice. Goes down well, and could easily put down a few of these a night with no problem. Overall I enjoy this beer very much. It one that I can always go to and enjoy. It might not be the most complex beer, but it is nice. This is a favorite of mine, sure I have had better beers, but this is a beer I keep going back to."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: I guess it is drinkable in the sense that you could knock them back if you wanted to . I didn't find it enjoyable (I switched drinks) and I wouldn't go out of my way to have another. It was a monotone and diluted experience for me."
"Pours a clear brown color with a sudsy off-white head that became rocky as it slowly settled into a puffy cap. The aroma is light, some caramel malt and mineral water. Light toffee flavors are forefront, honey, and mineral water, kind of heavy on the mineral water. The feel is light, watery and quite fizzy, finishes slightly dry. An average brew, some light flavor mixed with fizzy mineral water. Easy to swill."
"Copper and orange. nice two finger head with generous amounts of lacing. smell is slightly skunky - maybe the types of hops, not that the beer is spoiled. there is a smell of caramel. the skunky kind of smell seems to have toned down since i let the beer settle out a bit. taste is malty, with some fruitiness towards the end. some notes of caramel. beer is pretty smooth, and has a good mouthfeel. slightly creamy, but with plenty of carbonation."
"D= pretty high. Not much flavor or anything interesting going on here ut its not too bad"
"While not bad, I can't endorse such a bland, unremarkable product."
"Overall this beer is decent at best. The best part was the lacing, which was not even that outstanding. I have had this on tap and it was much, much better."
"Drinkability: easily drinkable due to the non-intense flavor."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and a little watery."
"This was mediocre for me. Not bad by any means, but nothing that I'll remember."
"D - This was leftovers from some 'Black-Smiths' we made (Guinness/Smithwick's). Seems to be better w/ Guinness, not so much by itself. I'd drink this over AB or Miller product but I would get sick of the taste and stingy carbonation."
"D - I could drink a few of these, though it's a bit too filling to drink all night."
"Nothing transcendental, but a well balanced, solid quaff."
"A startlingly light and tasteless version of the style. Granted, I do not find any off or offensive flavor. However, there is very little flavor of any kind to be found at all."
"One dimensional and pretty boring."
"Pours a clear mahogony hue with a soapy sudsy white head. Herbal, caramel malt aroma with notes of apples and hay, some roast and burnt notes. Most of the flavors are roasty, dry and lots of cramel malt flavor and dry grain. some notes of apple and cardboard. Sorry I did not like this at all and had a hard time finishing it."
"Overall there's nothing overly spectacular about this beer, in fact there's nothing even very good about this beer. It's a good session beer when you're looking to give your taste buds a break."
"Had this at a friend's holiday party tonight and found it okay but not remarkable enough to find its way into my own refrigerator. The best thing about it was its appearance: poured a lovely clear copper with a creamy white head that hung around awhile and enticed. Faint aromas of sweet, toasty malts but unfortunately they didn't translate into much in the taste department beyond barely discernable sweet malts with earthy hops. The creamy feel, however, was quite satisfying."
"i would have more but not my first choice"
"Overall, its not bad, but not something I will order again unless its Smithwick's or a american light lager. To sum it up in a word...'meh'."
"Overall: This is my favorite beer. In comparison to other irish ales i have tried, this one trumps them all. Anyone who is a fan of Killians should try this."
"D - an overall really good beer to enjoy"
"Had on tap at Shakespeare's - San Diego. Very dark for an ale. The aroma is terrible, a mix of b.o. and livestock feed. But, this beer redeems itself with the taste. Creamy like a Boddington's, but drier and crisper. Slight malt and hops. Good beer."
"Overall: The finish was short. It was an okay beer."
"- realized that I placed this one under the wrong smithwick's when reviewed a few years ago."
"Overall - Quite decent and definitely more creamy on tap than from the bottle. However, I do enjoy the bottles more. The tap makes it a bit too uncarbonated and a little too silky for the Smithwick's bottles I'm used to. Definitely sessionable though. Thank you, Ireland!"
"If I were to really simplify the taste it's if Guinness and Sierra Nevada had a baby. It's got a hoppy flavor, but not too strong so it probably won't turn off the average beer drinker. Also, it's got a bit of the sweetness (a bit of molasses I think, but could be wrong) that Guinness has with a rich fullness that I really look for in a beer of this caliber, perfect for the winter months. Great mouth feel, and the foam is just right not too airy. All and all it's a very good beer, and I would never turn one away, hell I'd probably even order one from a bar."
"Serving type-Either bottle or on-tap (though I lean more towards the on-tap variety)"
"Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable I'd like to try this on tap and would definately try it if available."
"This is a really good beer. Could become one of my favorites."
"D - This is probably my favorite session beer. It also makes a good 'gateway' beer for those who drink American macro lagers. It's not too complex but has enough flavor to keep me coming back for more."
"Deep honey brown, almost reddish in colour. Nice tan head. Fairly little carbonation. Some lacing to it that follows it down to the end of the glass. Somewhat sweet in smell, notes of caramel. Very smooth, nothing overarching in flavour. Overall, a good brew. Would definately have it again with some friends."
"when you have this on tap it is WAY better than from a bottle. it becomes a lot more of a well shaped beer in some way. this is without a doubt the only worthwhile irish beer of any sort! pours a nice syrupy looking dark with an off white head. malts and yeast in the nose, and basically the same in the body. this is a pretty light bodied beer for something of this color. plenty of yeasty goodness with mild hops and some malts. very low ABV makes this a pretty good one to have if you're at an irish pub. try it with some black pudding and a fried egg!"
"Mouth feel was creamy and smooth. Drinkability was decent, but not a lot of complexity here."
"Pretty drinkable beer. Not too heavy with a decent roasted flavor."
"D - Yep, waitress - lets have another."
"D: This goes down very easy but the sweetness eventually wins out against the roasted flavors. Something that I could have a couple of without a problem."
"Off the tap this beer was a deep amber/mahogany color with a thick khaki cap for a head. The lacing was minimal because the cap was so sticky but the retention was quite great. The aroma was understated, some caramel malt and something like iced tea. Odd. The flavors however were pretty good, pale malt and toasted malt with some hops muted in the background and caramel sweetness that lingers a little artificially in the finish. The body was rich, velvety and the carbonation soft so it was easy to quaff. But the flavors just weren't grand and I felt in general there were improvements to be made."
"Light-medium body with some light carbonation make this a smooth, easy drinker. A simple brew that is not too complex that makes for laid-back sipper or something nice to quaff; a great beer to enjoy and not think about with your mates. A tad bit expensive for a 6'er, but I got this one for free :), so no complaints!"
"Put simply, this is the everyday beer I've been wanting Sam Adams to produce for a while now."
"The drink is too pale in color, bubbly and sour. The flavor just doesn't sit right with me at all."
"Easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Has a nutty smell and very decent lacing. You can drink this straight from the bottle or great in a pint glass."
"D - An easy, mild session brew. I had no problem downing a few pints of this, though the sweetness can be a bit much after a while."
"Final note: I drank half the bottle while waiting for dinner, a chicken curry, and the second half with dinner. The beer did not hold up well to this spicy dish."
"If I'm buying, I'll stick to the McNally's Irish Ale from Big Rock..."
"2.5	D 2 pints without much problem, but would not consider a 3rd. resulted in headache and lousy overall feeling."
"The slight wateryness aids the drinkability and the mass appeal. I see why, an ok red. It would be a preferance over a Killian, if I want my true red from Ireland."
"D- Average when it comes to drinkability. I don't know if I could have a ton of these without getting sick of them."
"D- Drinks real well for a Red"
"4/8/2005. Tried this on a suggestion by a worker at this beer store (I was looking for something new to try). I'm glad I did. Pours an amber body with a nice thick off-white head and quite a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild malty with hints of chocolate and coffee in there. Slightly sweet tasting with a mix of roasted malts and a mild hop flavor. Only negative I can think of is it could use a little more to it, mouthfeel may be a little thin and could use the kick. I would have no problems drinking this again though."
"Pours with a nice thick frothy head. Very dark color, with a hint of red. Very clear. The smell is nothing special, light, fruity-malty with little to no hops. Nice creamy texture, with a tad more carbonation than I'd like, but it finishes very nicely. On the palate, there's a nice dark roasty flavour coming through, grainy and deep. Like toast. It carries a bit of hops with it as well that become more apparent in a few seconds, blending nicely with the nutty toasty flavours. It doesn't carry the same 'weight' that you'd normally associate with such a dark ale, and I think I could probably spend a whole evening putting these down."
"Great beer I will definitely buy again."
"Drinkability is pretty good either with food or as a session beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and substantially effervescent, with enough action to lift food off the palate and accentuate the terrific balance of all ingredients. It never gets dull, and the beer only gets better as it comes to temperature. A totally unexpected winner for me, and it's available everywhere."
"These go back pretty easy. This one is much much better on tap. Good middle of the road brew, decent session sipper."
"Poured a deep with a decent off white head. Nose was sweet, mild roasted malts, faint hops. Taste was slightly grassy hops, malts are sweet but a bit Creamy mouthfeel quickly thins out with a more astringent than bitter character. Nothing special but certainly drinkable."
"M&D-Medium to light body with a little to much carbonation not to bad though overall a pretty good session i could drink a few in a setting."
"D- easy enough to drink. i remember it being better out of a bottle."
"Had on tap at a local pub served in a large ""pint"" glass. Aroma was subtle wasn't able to pick up on much except for some creamy maltiness. Pour was a very dark amber with thin creamy head and little lacing. Thick mouthfeel for an ale with a full easy finish. The flavor was pretty good, creamy with a distinct maltiness. I had been looking forward to trying this beer, but overall it was simply decent. I question the freshness of the keg and the cleanliness of the taps and glasses so perhaps there is a slight injustice. I plan on trying out a sixer in the future and revisiting this review."
"D. Something about Smithwicks makes me happy. I love drinking these. Good as a Black N Tan as well, I prefer this to Bass. A good session beer."
"Poured from bottle to pub glass. Dark reddish color with very little head. I was expecting a 'Killians' when I first picked this up and was unusually surprised. It was more on the verge of a stout than an Irish Red. Basically to summarize this beer, it is like a watered down version of a stout without the strong coffee flavors. I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, it is easy to drink but for the price ($8.99/six pack) I'll stick to a full bodied stout as to my personal preference, but wouldn't mind one of these every so often to mix it up, give it a try!"
"D: Decent drinkability. This may be more filling than guinness due to the carbonation. OK but probably would not get again."
"Serving - Bottle"
"A pleasant Irish Red, I'll certainly try it again."
"I would call this a ""round"" beer with lots of British characteristics. For a mass-produced beer, this is superior with an easy drinkability."
"Pours a deep, deep red with a dense off-white head that lingered the entire session and left an absolute wall of lacing from top to bottom. Definitely one of the best looking irish reds I have ever seen. The smell is sweet and mainly malts with caramel and nuts. The taste has a strong malty sweetness as well but has a little bitterness in the finish to balance it out a little. The mouthfeel was a little over carbonated but still fairly smooth. I was actually pleasantly surprised by this one and thought it was very drinkable."
"D-Nice drinkability, could forsee having another one in the future."
"A medium-bodied brew that is a little thin and slick for an ale in my opinion, but still maintains a slight malt taste although it isn't as chewy as it is overcarbonated. Not a bad beer, but I'll take a Guinness Extra Stout over this when I'm in the grocery store."
"D : Easily sessionable. Will probably be my preferred Irish beer on St Patty's."
"Served a nice ruby red almost brown with a nice frothy head that lasts andleaves truly beautiful lacing. Aroma was burnt caramel malt and a hint of hops. The taste is a decent amount of caramel malt with subtle hops in the back. The beer is nice and crisp with decent carbonation. I've had this one several times before and found it to be a little bland, but this time I see what others see in this beer."
"Notes: Overall it's a very drinkable beer with a good body and flavor although not quite as deep as I would like to see. Still it's very drinkable."
"A good Irish red, but not as much caramel malt as I am used to in a red."
"D - ""I'll have another Smittix, thanks!"" was what I said after I finished the first two."
"i would recomend this beer for sure."
"D: Drinkable, but not something I would crave."
"This is a good beer, but cant have too many takes a little bit to put down, but not heavy by any means."
"Gulps down nicely. A definate session beer. My wife (who doesn't drink beer) even enjoyed some of this one. Nice alternative to Euro Lagers and other standard easy drinkers."
"Drinkability: This is a highly sessionable ale, as it has been proven in the US and Ireland. Light-medium bodied and refreshing."
"Poured to a nice head that was off white in color. Head lasted forever. Also left some nice lacing. The ale was a light brown in color. Was very light in the smell area. Slight hops smell. Tasted light also. Had a slight bitter after taste that hung on for a little while. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation I thought might be a little excessive. I could drink these on occasion. I dont think I would make it a session beer."
"Look is incredible. Deep red color with a massive fluffy white head on top that seems to never dissolve. Nice lacing. Really solid appearance. Nose is very mild toffee malt, light bitterness. Flavor is similar, mild toffee malt and a hint of smokiness. Not a ton going on, and it's masked further by the slightly excessive carbonation that sort of nettles the tongue. Light hops at the end. Overall, it's not a bad brew, not objectionable at all. Fairly mild...a solid session brew."
"Overall, I think it is a good beer, especially considering its mass production and distribution. Normally these beers don't stay strong when that happens."
"There is a relatively clean finish to the brew. The toasted malt still rules, but hops show up to balance out the end."
"D: This is a very good session beer. It is an easy beer to drink not over-bearing. This beer has two different taste. There is one flavor when it is cold but if it sits awhile at room temperature you will have a little more flavor."
"Had this beer on tap at the Nine Drunken Irishmen in sin city. The beer is nice looking nice amber color and 1/2 inch creamy head that fades to a lace in about two minutes. The nose is lacking slightly grainy, some hay, not a whole lot present. The same for the taste, I was really unimpressed some sweet maltiness upfront followed a very faint hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is refreshing and dry, could be an ok session beer if nothing better was around."
"Another great beer from the makers of Guinness!!"
"The first taste was almost silky to the palate and the flavor had a tinge of maltiness without being predominant. Successive sips accustomed the palate and initial maltiness blended into the great overall taste of this beer. There was absolutely no bitterness that I could discern. I'm surprised at how smooth this beer is. The second bottle was more pleasurable than the first. It's a downright delight to drink."
"D: I guess this one was alright, just didn't seem to stand out"
"Drinkability is not to bad, I could certainly have another of this but if there is something else on tap with more flavor I'll go for that."
"D = This is a very easy drinking beer, good for session drinking."
"MF/D: A little dry, medium body, not as carbonated as I originally thought. Drinkable for sure, but settling in for a third, I felt rather bloated. A decent beer, a nice step up from the mass-manufactured lagers for the masses that I'd recommend to a domestic drinker as a ""gateway"" drug! ;)"
"I had this on tap at Lagers. This beer was a nice amber color with a descent white head and minimal lacing. The aroma was a nice roasted malty smell. The taste was again a sweet roasted malt taste with a nice hint of hops. The mouthfeel was medium body. Overall a suprisingly good beer. not bad at all and I would have one again. This beer was a good standard beer."
"Got this on-tap. In the glass, it appears a brown/amber color with nice, white head that leaves plenty of lace while drinking the beer. The nose is ery light, with just a bit of roast and grainy maltiness. The tast is also light, with a bit of sweet roasty malt up front with a brief little hop zing mid-drink. There is a bit of an astringent bitter aftertaste. the mouthfeel is a bit watery but still good. This is a very drinkable beer. The flavors are very light but none of them are bad."
"Drinkability: About average not bad but not great. A good every once and a while beer."
"This beer poured a dark copper with reddish highlights and a frothy two-finger tannish head. The smell is mostly toasty caramel malt. The taste is start off with some sweet caramel tasting malts and a bit of nuttiness that goes into a tiny touch of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with a fair amount of carbonation. This is a tasty little beer, and I could imagine having a couple without any problem."
"Drinkability: As I stated earlier, a good bier to have with your bier-novice friends. My Irish friends are all over this so be careful of any derogatory comments about the irish and bier. Just kidding. Enjoy a six-pack."
"The aroma is sweet caramel maltiness and faint hoppiness and the taste is much of the same. This is a pretty smooth ale and could fill in for a session ale. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has ample carbonation. Overall, an easy drinker that I would go back to."
"D: This is a good beer if you let it warm up enough. First drink I couldn't taste or smell anything, but the coffee and chocolate flavors came through in the end."
"Settled as a dark amber appearance with some decent lacing. The drink had a bit of a syrup-like smell to it that was of sweet malts. The taste, to me, had an almost licorice candy flavor to it, supplemented by some bitter hop flavors. It had a good, medium body to it; nothing too powerful. Overall, a decent beer."
"This was a pretty good brew. It was kind of red I guess but I thought it was a little more brown than red. It had a great head that stuck around for quite some time. It went down very smooth with a very mild bitterness. I think that is was a very good drink."
"D-Very flavorful and pleasant to drink."
"Nothing outstanding, but pleasant. Something to drink at a bar when nothing else is available."
"Drinkability: Not too filling, and quite refreshing."
"MF&D - Highly carbonated and somewhat bland. Watery, but drinkable. A decent quencher, but not much flavor in this one."
"Feel is creamy, probably from carbonation. Palate is on the sweet side. Dairy sourish with some metal. Finish is caramelish with lots of residual sugar. Not bad, I guess, just a little weak on flavour overall."
"D - Refreshing and a pleasant Irish Red Ale, goes down smooth and easy any day."
"Not one of my favorite red's I'll stick with either Sam Adams or Great Lakes."
"Wow this surprised me. If you like red ales I think you'll like this. Though if you don't I doubt it will change your mind. Cheers."
"Nothing special."
"Not bad, a good one for the season."
"Drinkability: light and refreshing with low alcohol and decent taste. Won't necessarily seek this out, but not a bad beer."
"D: I really don't think I could drink more than one for the experience. I suppose it is worth a try. If this beer is your style, more power to you, but as for me... not so much"
"This was recommended by a friend I visited out of state a few weeks ago. Granted I haven't had to many Irish red's, but this beer definitely did not meet my expectations. It has a nice lacing that stays all through the beer, but there is no real flavor. I would classify this along with most light beers -you can drink alot without getting filled up or overwhelmed by the flavor."
"D - Kind of filling. But overall good. Could enjoy some of these, if I don't get full first."
"D: A very good social beer. Not interesting enough for me to drink it by myself, but perfect for a night at the pub. Goes down easy."
"Overall, this is a nice looking beer. It is an easy drinker. Alas, it is not very tasty."
"D - I really enjoy Smithwick's as a very 'sessionable' Irish red. I really think it's a good standard by which other Irish Reds could be compared to, not only because it's relatively common in distribution, but also because of it's simple (but good) qualities."
"A good choice for a second step up from BMC. This beer is also good for realizing that there's more to Ireland than just stouts."
"Very easy drinking ale with nice dark copper color and good lacing. Makes a good session ale or good beer to introduce to non craft beer drinkers who will occasionally drink Guiness Stout."
"Dark copper color with two finger head with decent staying power and leaves lots of thick lacing. Smells like the inside of a whiskey barrel...slightly burnt wood soaked alcohol scent that works well for me. Taste is not complex, malt up front with hop bitterness bringing up the rear with dry finish. Light in body therefore highly drinkable. A decent, solid beer that goes down easy."
"Light bodied, smooth and crisp. Easy drinking and refreshing. Not going to blow you away by anymeans, but a nice little session beer."
"I drink this beer quite often. It goes great with any food I've paired it with; and is very enjoyable on it's own as well."
"This is a definite session beer, which I've done in the past. I actually like Smitticks and would choose it over many other pub beers."
"D: I've always enjoyed this beer. It's nothing to write home about, but it is tasty and easy to find. Better fresh, so if you buy a six pack, plan to drink it pretty fast (or share). Good, sessionable beer, and with St. Patty's day right around the corner, you can't go wrong with this one."
"D: Very smooth, easy drinker, easily a good session beer."
"A nice refreshing beer, but really very simple. Could be a nice sessuon beer."
"This is a session beer through and through. Not much to remember about it. This is a gateway beer for people to take the big scary step towards craft beers. You can drink alot of it and still be find. The taste is not offensive or heavy. Great beer to drink when you are thirsty and not in the mood to enjoy complex tastes."
"Pours a clean/clear dark amber color, some carbonation, little fizzy off-white head, some tiny islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is mostly malts and caramel. The taste is malty with some caramel. Light body. Drinkable I guess, but I would not buy it again."
"M&D: The mouthfeel for this is nearly perfect for the flavors on the palate as everything comes together for a very enjoyable brew. I don't know that I would call this one ""balanced"" in flavor as there is definitely little in the way of hop bitterness, but man, this stuff is easy drinking and highly enjoyable."
"Bright clear reddish-copper with a big, foamy off-white head. Smell is quite soft, but has some toffee and tea-like sweetness mixed with lightly toasted malts. Medium bodied with a fizzily carbonated mouthfeel. Light in taste as well with a tea-like and almost fruity sweetness mixing with lightly toasted grains. A touch of bitterness dies in a relatively clean and fresh finish. Not complex but nicely drinkable and refreshing, and better than your average macro."
"Pours a yellow-ish/ copper color with an off-white head. In the aroma, a caramel sweetness. In the taste, again caramel sweet maltiness. A light body, with a nice bitterness in the mouthfeel, and a dry, caramel maltiness in the aftertaste. A nice caramel presence, yet nothing too exciting, a nice OK stand-by."
"This is an okay beer, but hardly one I'd drink on a regular basis. It's simply too thin and lacking a bit in flavor. As I said earlier, it's not without charm, but still sort of average overall."
"D - This is one of those beers that you can session and do other things than think about the beer I'd drink this while playing in dart leagues"
"D - Good drinkability, could easily session this beer and enjoy a few at a sitting."
"Overall, this is very drinkable. I actually kind of like it. It is not something I would actively seek out, but it is available many places and is a good step up from BMC. I would consider this a solid, middle-of-the-road red ale."
"Drinkability - much better on-tap, I'd session this easily."
" Not a bad choice when your options are limited."
"Overall a good brew, not the best example of the style, but worth checking out."
"The feel was actually pretty similar to Guinness. Smooth and creamy, but this one was a bit more crisp. Altogether makes for a very drinkable beer."
"The only real negative would probably be my own tastes.. I can only see myself having 1 of these at a time, and I will probably never buy it again outside of Ireland."
"There is nothing too terribly wrong with this one, it just tastes a little empty in the finish. If I had to sum it up, I'd say it's essentially like Guinness, but with an abrupt end to the taste just a few seconds after drinking. I probably wouldn't buy another six pack, but if one were served to me I wouldn't complain."
"It had a very thin and quickly diminishing head with a reddish brown color. The aromas were of caramel and hops. The taste had strong caramel flavoring and hoppy bitterness. There wasn't much else to this beer it was light and definitely an enjoyable beer and I could put down many in one sitting."
"Pours a deep amber brown with a nice frothy head that stays around for the most part. Aroma is a buttery caramel but very subtle. Goes down clean, crisp, and slightly malty with a dry finish. Very smooth, but perhaps too light for me. It's a very good representation of the style."
"Toasted malts, less sweetness than the smell indicated. Mouthfeel is a little watery. Easy to drink though, and quite enjoyable."
"This is not a bad brew, just nothing that stands out. It is pretty smooth on the finish, not over powering, very easy to drink."
"Overall Impression: (4.5) The leafy note in the taste and the last leaf of Fall appearance makes this the perfect Autumn beer. Taste is simple, but interesting enough to make a great session. Glad to see this one in bottles in Texas."
"Great beer! I can't believe it took this long to try it. After 2 all I could think was I want more. Terrific malty taste with a dark amber color. The head had small bubbles that had just the right amount of mouth feel. Lasing stuck right to the glass."
"Dark brown with a red hue and little to no head when in a pint glass from a local bar. The smell was of malt with a note of roasted barley. The roasted barley comes through more in the taste with a coffeeish character present, perhaps from chocolate specialty malts. Medium to light body with crisp carbonation. Goes down smoothly. Drinkable."
""
"I tried it origionally at a bar and had to puchase some more. Alittle pricey however, $9 for a 6-pack in centeral Wisconsin. Pours with a great head and beautiful appearance. I have been told it is used to top off a true Irish Black and Tan of a glass of Guinness with Smithwick's added to the top. Sounds tastey to me!"
"It's not too sweet, and not too dominating in any way. If you're staring at this or a McSorley's, go for the former, and support Guinness Ltd. a bit more, yeah?"
"Great beer. When mixed with Guinness for a REAL black and tan is very tasty."
"Drinkability - I could very well see drinking this daily. It's very smooth and has an enjoyably sweet flavor. Hops bitter is fairly mellow, but allows sweet, full malt characteristics to come through. Roasty malt floavor could come through more. Very nice drink."
"Drinkability: This is a great, flavorful session brew. Offers decent flavor in a light package."
"I really liked the way it looked when pouring it into a glass. Not the best red ale, but worth a shot in a pinch. Could have used a bit more hops, but it had great head retention. I had this in Ireland and was advised to try a black and tan with Guinness."
"The pint pours beautifully. A thick, creamy, everlasting head. The beer is coppery with a tinge of brown, looking like a foamy iced tea. The aroma is very mild. Maybe a little grassy, but only the merest hint. The flavor is balanced, and both the bitter hops and sweet malt hit you at the same time. The malt stands out a bit more, giving it the essence of a proper Guinness stout. It's smooth, but a little thin. Medium bodied at best, so it's not going to be overly filling."
"An about average, non-offensive beer. Reminds me of the old Murphy's Amber, which I suppose is the point."
"Pours out a wonderful shining copper color and has a fantastic head and great lacing. Has a very nice smell, towards hoppy, but with a slight sweet tang. The taste is the opposite, it has a nice malty sweet flavor with just a slight bitter aftertaste. Very mild but pleasing. It goes down very, very easily."
"D - Very high. Very smooth and light with a relatively low ABV at 4.5%. You could easily drink a sixer of these in a night."
"One could do worse....certainly worth another try and more than 1 at that"
"This would make a terrific session beer, as it goes down smooth, and becomes better tasting the further into the glass you get. Not a beer that will make you stop and ponder life's mysteries, but a great lunchtime/afternoon drink."
"(And it is ""SMIT-icks"" to the Irish and not ""Smith-wicks"" like we yanks say.)"
"It is like the younger brother, but where the older brother got the best genes."
"An easy to drink offering. It had been a while since I'd had this beer and decided to pick some up as it was on sale at a good price ($5 for a six pack). It's not a beer I'd drink on a regular basis but overall it's a solid but not so memorable offering. Good but not great."
"Very much what I envision when I think of the ""Irish Red"" style."
"Well first off there was a price increase that came with getting this beer in a trendy restaurant/bar. Doh! Nice amber color, very little head and that vanished quickly, patchy lacing. A good ale taste to it with very little lingering taste. Yep, I'd rate this as a drinkable beer."
"Overall...an average beer. A bar that carries Smithwick's should also have Guinness....I say just go with the Guinness."
"Pours an amber color from the tap at Brazenhead with a little white head resting on top. A light roasted aroma with some sweetness to it. Smell is of a lot of british hops in the background. Taste is doughy, and little roasty flavor with some bittering toward the end. Mostly creamy, syrupy mouthfeeling that finished dry."
"I enjoyed this. Drank it out of a bottle in the dark, so I can't justifiably comment on the appearance, but it was quite tasty. Tastes of malts and carmel, with some hop bitterness, and some chocolate hints. Mouthfeel smooth, yet creamy. I will definitely seek these out in the future."
"Not bad by any means, but very ""eh."""
"This beer is quite enjoyable and goes down rather well,nice beer to start off your evening before moving on to something else."
"Pours a nice amber-red color with an ample head. Very impressive head that is also slightly reddish in color. Aroma is rich and malty. Taste is very much the same. Goes down smooth and somewhat sweet. Lots of lacing left in the glass. A very drinkable beer that I would probably buy again, unless I find something better for the style."
"Final Thought: Good Stuff!"
"Drinkability: Simply great. Goes down smooth and is not overly bitter or sweet. A perfect balance between flavours make this a truly remarkable beer. Easily a sessionable brew that I would gladly enjoy all day"
"D - Amazing drinkability, I could and have drank this beer all day. The bitterness refreshes so well, and the beer isn't too strong or complex to get in the way of simple enjoyment."
"It has a well rounded body but is not bitter."
"overall this isnt too bad a beer but not something that i can see myself buying in the future"
"D: Good offering here, but I would like to try more in this style to be sure how the rest stack up against this one."
"Draft. Pours nice amber color with small creamy head that it retained. Good flavor, nothing spectacular, but extremely drinkable. Head is decent but doesnt hang around for long. Flavor is of slight caramel nutiness. Decent session beer. Would recommend to those of you that like Irish Ales."
"D-This is where the beer shines, if you want a smooth, good tasting beer that is not high in ABV, this is a terrific choice for sure. I also recommend buying the ladies this one. It will intrigue them to go into the ""good beer"" genre with its smooth, user-friendly flavor. Definitely a decent choice at a pub or if the selection is limited where you are drinking..."
"Enjoyed this after a long day sailing on beautiful Lake Michigan. Pours a dark amber with a very small and slightly tan head which quickly dissipated - a very attractive beer nonetheless. Smell was mild with some hops and slight alcohol. Taste was similarly mild but well balanced with just a little sweetness to balance out the hops - refreshing with no lingering aftertaste. Mouthfeel was interesting, in a good way. Highly carbonated but with very tiny bubbles lends this one a creamy feel that finishes clean and slightly dry. Drinkability was excellent and I will enjoy this one again in the future (although this particular night I had some Bell's to sample). :)"
"$4.50 / bottle at dinner"
"D: very drinkable, not muc to it but not bad either."
"D - This one is pretty boring, but it makes up for it's lack of distinction with a gentle and tasty drinkability. Nothing special, but I would order this again with a burger."
"D: Very good, low in alcohol and good taste makes this an easy drinker for a night at the pub, or an evening at home; you can stick with this one for the whole night."
"Drinkability - This was nice. I expected something less complex and was suprised by how much I enjoyed this beer. For something out of a ""mass market"" producer, this is a good stable beer. I'm not very diverse on Irish Red Ales and this makes me want to try more. I would very much grab another."
"Poured this pretty beer into a tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice mohogany amber color with a light brown head that was big fat creamy and mighty fine. Nothing really outstanding about the taste other than it was just really good. Nothing really jumped out at you as far as what it taste like. I would buy again."
"Nothing special, the US version is very mild and unobtrusive."
"D: Too much residual sugar for my palate."
"overall, this brew is very well crafted. the smell and taste are robust, but withdrawn enough to be very drinkable. a tasty irish ale."
"(I also prefer this in bottle rather than tap)."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, pretty well carbonated, and smooth. All in all, it's drinkable. There's much better out there, but I'd take it over a number of beers found in most bars. Overall, decent beer. Certainly worth a try."
"pours a very dark amber color with a thick foamy head, tons of malt in the aroma, i almost smell a slight hint of licorice, Tastes a bit more chocolatey, or caramel like than it smells, still malt is present. no real hop taste at all, aftertaste is coffee like. decent beer, alot of folks have compared this stuff to newcastle. dont know how they dont seem anything alike and i'd rather have a dog for the same price."
"Overall this is a drinkable beer and worth a go, especially if the selection is limited. Definitely lacks sweetness, which I wish it had a touch of. Dryness and carbonation seem a bit much, but the flavors should match many meals quite well."
"Like I said, this beer exists, and it doesn't hurt you, and it has enough flavor to be respectable. It beats the hell out of macros, and it does fine against Bass, but not against a good esb or pale ale."
"very drinkable. I would recommend this for a setting like a family party."
"It poured a dark red with lots more head than barley wines usually have. Aroma is deep and a malty smell that is roasty rather than sweet and has some sourness. Flavor is coffee up front and at the finish, with some out-of-place sour notes. Mouthfeel is fairly carbonated, again not typical of the barley wine style. Not bad."
"drinkability - I like irish red ales, the few that I have tried. Add this to list. I enjpyed this."
"The beer pours a brown/red color with an inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like sweet malt, nuts and a bit of citrus. The beer tastes the same way to me, but it has a bitter/sour finish. Mouthfeel is light, and has a bit too much carbonation. Drinkability is OK, but not impressive at all. Overall I think it's an average beer. I'd drink it again, but it's not a beer that I would make a regular choice of mine."
"D- this is a great beer but not the best irish red I have had. Its pretty drinkable. The taste does get better as the carbonation fades away so keep that in mind if you pick this one up. It gets much smoother and enjoyable."
"Drinkability - Being how light this is on the stomach and the exceptional taste for a generic Irish Ale, this is a great beer to sit down and have two or three brews."
"Marks are all over the place on this one, but the flavor saves it from being an average beer. Since that's what counts most, and the alcohol level is low, this can be considered a highly drinkable beer, and an excellent session choice if that's what you're after."
"Good, but not quite great or memorable."
"It has a dark amber color when poured with a nice rocky off white head that seems to be hanging around for a long time. It also leaves frothy lacing down the glass as you drink it. It smells pretty malty. It has a pretty mild malt flavor with a hint of carmel and a faint bitterness and hops flavor at the end. This beer is really smooth and refreshing. It would be a pretty good session beer."
"Poors a nice dark amber, with a 2 finger head from a vigurous poor. Smells sweet, with a good amout of maltyness. Taste of malts, spices, and just a bit of bittering hops. Im enjoying this more then i usualy do, probobly because today was my first day of work in a while, but overall, a pretty good brew to pick up ocastion"
"Pours an opaque reddish-mahogany in color with near 2 fingers of slightly off-white head and some spotty lacing. Smells of lightly toasted malts. Has a nice caramel malt flavor that is balanced by a nice subtle hop bitterness that finishes with a nice malty sweetness. This beer leans towards malt but has a nice balanced flavor none-the-less. Good mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. Overall this is a solid brew and quite enjoyable."
"D - This is a highly drinkable ale, I know this not only from my experience, but from my mom who absolutely does not drink beer at all. She tried a smithwicks and said she could actualy drink it and said it didn't have a typical beer taste."
"When poured the color presented was a dark red with a faint head that didn't last long. Spotty traces of thick lace are shown circling the glass. If it had more head retention this could beer a high rated beer. Drinkability is exceptional! I look for Smithwicks at every Pub or any Restaurant I go to. It's the perfect staple session brew. Perfect malt/carbonation/hops ratio. No real bitterness noted on the finish. Smooth and refreshing, it's lighter than it's color appears. Slight hop aroma, but mostly all light sweet malts. Aroma could use a touch more hops. Also, On the finish I can taste some Phenolic action. The light sweet honey taste is delightful. The taste is not too complex giving it only a 4. Overall Great,,a must try."
"Smithwicks on tap is one of my favorite session beers. Its sort of the perfect session red ale. In the bottle though it really misses the boat. Still a great beer and very drinkable, but the over carbonation and added macro sort of flavor are somewhat of a turn off."
"this is a nice spring time quaffer. recommended for the style."
"D - Goes down easy, but doesn't especially ""light up"" the senses. I really had to work to get anything from this beer."
"Smithwicks pours a copper red into a pint glass, forming a good head at the top. It has a sweet smell that's mixed with a grainy scent and a vague DMS. The taste is a tad sweet, with a buttery follow-up. Bready notes are recognized, and it has a quick hoppy bitterness at the end of each sip. Finishes dry. A decent brew that's worth a shot."
"Note: For the USA, this is one of the few beers still actually imported from Ireland. Most of the Harp Lager and Guinness Stout sold in the USA is made in Canada, thus can still be called Imported, but is somewhat misleading."
"D - This is a pretty good Irish Red Ale. I've had it on tap before and it was much better, but it is still pretty good from a bottle."
"pours a chestnut color with a large egg shell colored head thatholds well with excellent lacing. earthy, musty, slighty spice aromas. taste is same with nice hop balance. mouthfeel is light, crisp, lots of carbonation. good session beer for any time of the year. also think it would do well with most types of food."
"Poured into pint glass from bottle. The color is dark red to copper and pours a nice creamy head that lingers thru sampling. The smell is almost nonexistant. Light malt with very little hop behind it. The taste is smooth and creamy with malty alcohol feel when it hits the tongue. The boozy aftertaste remains and there is no real bitterness in its taste. The beer is ok, but not the type of beer that moves up on my list of choices when out and about. It is not offensive, but there is nothing about it that makes me want it again. I could see folks liking it as a session beer."
"D- This is a very light flavored, average beer in a ""importee"" bottle. Not much character or depth."
"Mouthfeel was thin and a bit fizzy, which, coupled with the low ABV, makes for a fairly sessionable beer. All in all, this was a fairly enjoyable brew, although I wouldn't go out of my way to get another one."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Reasonably good taste, and a low ABV make it quite sessionable. It is unremarkable but a nice St Patty's Day offering."
"Even taking this into consideration, though, I can't help but give this brew some very high marks. It manages a wonderful complexity without going overboard on anything, it's interesting without being punishing. It is, simply put, a wonderfully brewed beer."
"Drinkability- Wish I hadn't bought a sixer."
"This is a great brew for just going to the pub and grabbing an ale. I feel the same way about this as I do the Guinness Draft - not the most complex thing in the world, but it is always there, and always worth a pint or two."
"Erin Go Drinking!"
"Being able to find this almost everywhere (Meijers even has this in the cold section), pricing is right, makes this one of the best Irish Ales I've had."
"A very good ale."
"All in all I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offerred to me, but unless I'm in the mood for one, I'll grab something more to my liking at the distributor."
"Nice example of the style. Slight oxidized character added complexity, but detracted somewhat. Dark malt drying could be more pronounced to sharpen the finish."
"Beer poured out a nice deep brown, with decent head and carbonation. Smell gave a nice hop aroma, and the taste had a nice surprising hoppiness to it as well. Mouthfeel seemed to be a little syrupy at times, but overall was surprised at my enjoyment of this one."
"Overall: Very enjoyable. I could easily drink a lot of these in one sitting if nothing better was available and not even complain. Can't say that about the other Guinness brews, there's only so much Guinness and Harp a person should have to endure."
"Very drinkable beer, I usually give this to my friends who enjoy drinking the foul delights of Bud Light. Very lightweight in the mouth. Too fizzy for my taste. I am almost confused as how this falls into an Ale catergory as this is very Lager-like. Very little head when poured into a glass, very nice red color to it as well. Its a nice alternative to my everyday beer."
"Had a bottle of this last night, a very solid brew. Nice brown color with good head retention (it is a Guinness brew). Slight carmel smell. A bit of malty sweetness and a bit of hop flavor; nothing overpowering in either but a good blend with plenty of flavor. A smooth finish. Overall a very drinkable beer."
"The taste is the same. Fruity and floral. Nice and sweet malt flavors. Has the taste of hops, but no bitterness. Not even the slightest hint of roasted or caramel malt. Like I said, it lacks its balls. Almost tastes a bit foo-foo. It is still quite pleasant and easy drinking. I would probably drink it again even though it is the epitome of pedestrian brew. Despite its downfalls (or rather, lack of high points), it is a very good all around beer. I am surprised it is made by Guinness, considering I loathe the lack of flavor in Guinness and Harp is no better, IMO."
"Has a nice ruby red color with rich and smooth head that recedes with a nice lace. Has a sweetness to the aroma, very smooth on the tongue with just the right amount of carbonation. An extremely easy drinking ale with tones of chocolate. Hop aroma is virtually none existence which is perfect for this style all malt."
"Other comments: Would probably never have heard of this beer if it wasn't in a 24-pack mixed case my mom had bought from Sam's Club. I can say without a doubt that I would still have died a happy man if that had been the case!"
"A wonderful Irish ale, it pours a dark amber with a fine white head. It tends to have a pleasantly sharp taste with sweet malt qualities. It is very smooth and full bodied. It's a family favorite and is a great ale to accompany a good meal, snack time or a movie at home."
"D: I could drink a few of these before I would have to switch to a nice stout."
"Tried a Smitty's tonight at a fine Irish pub. A nice, dark red ale with a good, white head that retained throughout the beer, lacing galore. Smelled a little malty and toasted. Tasted very toasted; reminded me of a stout. Nice mouthfeel; thick enough where you know you're drinking a good ale. Very drinkable all the way around; recommended."
"Light to medium mouthfeel.a bit grainy.Very drinkable a smooth and refreshing beer.My first Smithwick's,didn't get a lot of good imput on this beer. A pleasing suprise for me. I found this to be a very good beer."
"Dark reddish in color, maintains a solid copper head throughout. Caramel malts graze the nose; light notes of burnt toast become more noticeable during warming. The taste is solidcaramel malts, wheat crackers and white bread toast. The palate is left creamy, with a touch of almonds. Medium bodied, decent flavors and passes the test for the style. Simple and easy going. Nothing to complain about."
"It certainly starts rather pretty, and while it struggles a bit in the nose, the final verdict is certifiably positive. While nothing stands out, it accomplishes what I think it sets out to do, which is to come off as nice, pleasant, and if a bit above average, quite drinkable as well. So it will never be my first choice, but I wouldn't gripe if it pulled my fat out of the fire in a barren beer-scape somewhere."
"Drinkability was good."
"The taste is quite a good balance of hops and malt; it never gets overly bitter nor sweet. The malt does come through a bit more than the hops though. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full and dry, yet there is a good amount of carbination. The beer goes down incredibly easy, and is quite drinkable. It is certainly reccomended if you enjoy a sessionable dark ale."
"Drinkability: It's a half-decent session ale and an okay choice when faced with some of the other options at most English or Irish-style pubs in the US."
"I usually drink this brew whenever I go to an Irish pub here in Austin. It's a fairly easy drinking beer, kind of like if AB where to switch to mass producing an ale instead of a lager. I like it, but there are better Irish ales out there."
"Pours to a unique delightful metallic brown in colour. Nice macro bubble head that holds up nicely. Head clings nicely. Good lacing. Smell is malty. Taste is kind of neutral. The balance of malt and hops is too good and nothing stands out at the beginning but the hops bitter comes through in the end. Rare taste for an ale. Carbonation is perfect. Not bad but don't think it will be on the list of favorites for imbibing. They may want to stick with the Guinness."
"Goes down pretty good. All around good beer. I would take this over a Guinness Draught."
"Ahh, my Irish eyes are smiling. Another one of my favorites. Its dark in appearance but doesnt taste like you would expect. Unlike most people who use Bass, every time I have a Black & Tan, its gotta be with this stuff. However, it is slightly over carbonated for my taste. Overall its a good malty ale with nice body and a light carbonation."
"This brew pours a clear dark red color. The head is two-fingers in height, and recedes slowly into decent lacing. The aroma is of malty and mildly spicy. The taste is amazing, but not in a good way. I am amazed at how a beer this dark can have such little flavor. There is absolutely nothing there while the beer is in my mouth, and the aftertaste of caramel malt is very mild. The mouthfeel is overcarbonated, which might account for some of the lack of flavor. It is also very light in body. Overall, this beer is a major disappointment. I will not buy this again."
"I poured this 12oz bottle into a glass mug which managed to raise a thick head which slowly became creamy as it thinned. The brew is an ambery brown and a bit more carbonated than I expected. A slight malty sweetness both in smell and taste, slight bitterness. Solid mouthfeel, pretty drinkable."
"D- its okay, im not too impressed, its definitely not awful, would drink again, probly would not buy again though"
"D - This is a pretty quaffable brew. I think it might get old during a session since it is virtually devoid of any hoppy character, but it is certainly the sort of brew one could drink every day. A decent food brew for sure."
"Sweetness is held in check very well making this an easy drinking brew that would session easily."
"Pours a nice ruby red color with a one finger width head that fads to a nice film and leaves some lacing on the glass. Just by looking at the glass I can tell that the bar is serving the beer too cold. The beer has a sweet smell with a small hint of hops. At first taste the beer is too cold and the flavors are muted. Wraping my hands around the pint glass helps warm it to a good temperature. Once the beer is at a good temp the flavors come out much better. There is nice carmel sweetness with a slight peaty smokeyness and only a slight hint of hops. The mouth is a little on the heavy side with low carbination. A good irish red."
"Pours a dark amber color with creamy white head with pretty good retention. Aroma is clean with malt, biscuit and nuts. Much like the aroma, the taste is roasted malt with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall, this is a solid brew that makes for a good session."
"Thin mouthfeel, especially amplified by the temperature it was served at. Smooth, but thin. I managed to knock back about four or five pints before last call so I'd have to say that it is indeed a decent session beer, but nothing I'd order at a real beer bar."
"D: The smoothness and sweetness makes it very easy to drink. It’s one of those beers that you can pound away without realizing how much you’re drinking. I had tried this beer previously and remember the taste being too strong and too bitter, which made me hesitant to try it again and made me question the hype that I had heard about it, but I’m thinking it might have been skunked that first time. Overall, I think this is a very good beer and would certainly recommend it, especially if you’re looking to try this style for the first time."
"Drinkability: I could drink these all night, but the average yellow beer drinker may not be able to hold more than 2 or so before drinking yellow water again for alcohol instead of flavor."
"I poured this into a conical pint, the beer has alot of carbonation, lots of bubbles creating a foamy tan head which disappears steadily over time. Color is a nice dark amber, smell is very mild aroma with hints of hops and roasted barley. The taste is mild, more of a teaser yet still has plenty of flavor. Mouthfeel is good, overall this is a nice beer that you could drink year round, it has a decent amount of flavor but wont overwhelm the taste buds, will go down smooth. and leave a nice lace on the sides of the glass."
"This beer pours a nice deep reddish-brown with a thin head that leaves quickly. The aroma is rather thin, but it smells sweet, roasted, with a touch of alcohol. The taste is also a little thin but it is nutty, and a little tart at the finish. Smooth throughout but not quite bold enough for me. It has a great mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation, not too thick. It is a beer you can drink all night if you are feeling like mild tasting beer."
"Poured to a brownish red, with thick white head that lasted long and then left very good lacing. Not a real strong aroma, but what was there was a nutty, almost brown ale nose. I enjopyed the flavor more than an American Brown Ale, although it was hard to pick out a distinctive flavor. Had a decent finish. Not a bad beer all and all."
"Get my buzz on- y"
"Drinkability: I wouldn't want to drink a whole six pack (but I would), but I'd definitely greatly appreciate 2 or 3 of them."
"It makes a great session ale, but there's really not much more going on. If I were out at the pub I'd have one or two of these and then switch up to Guinness. Some of the other versions, however, offer more character."
"Nice appearance, amber with a slight head. the aroma was slightly fruity and herbal, with a touch of malt. The flavor was mostly malt with some slight herbal hoppiness, a nice complement but not terribly brilliant or innovative. The mouthfeel had a rather large tannin quality, it was similar to drinking iced tea (but yeah it was really beer). A bit off, I think I'll pass next time."
"This is a good representation of what an Irish red ale should look and taste like. A: Deep auburn with med brown body,med carbonation with little to no head and light lacing S: Caramel malts with peat like undertones T: very mild maltiness with a little hoppiness on the back end for balance and a strong finish. M: medium mouthfeel with enough coverage and body to satisfy D: easily drinkable with session prospects quite high. Overall it was a good ale with repetitive samplings easily desirable. I was unable to tour the brewery while in Kilkenny last August and hope to return some day as this is a great Irish ale."
"Smithwick's Irish ale was dark amber in color with a large light tan head. The head faded to a thin layer, but remained until the beer was gone, leaving a little lace behind. There was some sweet malt in the nose. The taste was fairly light, sweet malt upfront with a bitter finish. The body and carbonation were both on the light side. It would make a good session beer."
"Poured into a tumbler pint glass. Standard American bar pour, so very little head. What head there was left an acceptable white ring around the edge. Color was a clear, dark reddish brown. Smell was a strait forward hop malt mix. Slightly bitter, slightly sweet. Taste added a bit of orange peel to the mix. Mouthfeel was clean and refreshing. Irish Reds are straight up session beers, and it's really hard to screw one up. In this session I had about 6 over about an hour time. Good times."
"I think Smithwicks is the more drinkable Guiness. I know some that swear by Guiness, but some of that is the ""Irishness"" of the drink (like it's cool to be Irish, you know?). But Smithwick's is good, especially on a fresh keg. Unfortunately, not everyone knows about it so a keg can sit at my drinking hole for awhile. On the other hand, when the bartender tells me the keg is new, I drink the stuff until I can't stand. Good taste, good to introduce to friends. Enjoy a pint."
"Drinkability: overall, a decent beer. Smithwick's is a lighter, more carbonated version of Kilkenny. Worth trying."
"might make a good session beer."
"Taste has a bit more bitterness than I expected, which is nice, the roasted character comes through a lot more, and the sweetness, which still a bit cloying, is balanced by a nuttiness and astringent citric acidity. Hop presence is very pronounced. Quite a bit of bite on the tongue in this one, but not overcarbonated, not too watery either. All in all, a decent ale, and one I could tip back a few pints of on a night out."
"Originally reviewed March 21, 2005. On tap at the Irish Times Pub - Laurium, MI. Deep clear ruby pour with copious offwhite head and decent lacing. Strong rich malty aroma. Flavors of dry bread, yeast and light caramel malt. The strong dry oak and bitter finish kind of bothers me, but is probably typical for the style. Leaves too much of a bitterish astringent aftertaste for me."
" I would reccomend this to anyone especially guiness fans. God it's so drinkable! Adios"
"A good brew for me since I have been away from reviewing for a while."
"Smithwick's pours a reddish brown with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I'm just not getting much aroma at all. Taste has a caramel flavor. Not much to it, not a terribly exciting ale. Nothing to particularly recommend it. Inoffensive and uninteresting."
"I have enjoyed Smithwick's over the years but it has been a while since my last taste. Things haven't changed - Smithwick's is as I remembered - a hearty ale that reminds you that there is , in a brewing world dominated by non-descript blandness, still an old standby to be had and appreciated.."
"This pours a dark amber with a large white head and good lacing. The smell is light with only a small amount of malt detectable. The taste is thin with a real metalic undertone only some hops and malt were present. The m/f is light ,but the balance was off with the sweet malt clashing with the bitter hops. This really isn't a beer that I would try again unless it was free."
"Reccomended."
"Poured a rich mahogany/cedar clear color with an off-white head that subsided to about an inch. Not bad lacing. Color is the most impressive trait of this macro. Grainy/malty nose with a hint of carmel. Smooth taste, nothing overpowering. I like this one chilled to cover up some of the grainy-ness. Mouthfeel again good, but nothing overpowering. Good offering from Guinness for the macro/import Amercan crowd that's constantly looking for a fad. This is one of those fads, so I keep this on-hand for my import buddies."
"Extremely drinkable brew. Could have many of these in a row, and probably will!! Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is a light-medium bodied with a sweet malt and breadiness that is overly dominant on the front the front of the tongue and in need of a bit of bitters and a more full mouthfeel."
"Its serves slightly warm in N. Ireland where I had it 1st in the town of Bushmills (after the whiskey), but in the republic its chilled. I couldnt really notice any major differences in the flavor profile. Both were enjoyable."
"Cheers."
"Amber color, acceptable head. Not much in the way of aroma except maybe a little malt. Taste is not bad, with sweet malt and an almost toasty finish. Very little hops. Mouthfeel is very clean and smooth, this beer almost has a lager characteristic to it, in my opinion. Overall, a very smooth and drinkable beer with okay taste. I wouldn't turn it down if someone offered me one."
"Very well-balanced, with the toasted grain flavour staying with you as you drink."
"It has a medium body with a light cleansing ability. Overall, very nice suprise since I had not heard of this beer and ordered it out of curiousity. Very drinkable. Easily a good session beer."
"Cheers!"
"It was refreshing, lending to its drinkability, but could become boring."
"Smithwicks is one of those beers I could drink and drink and drink. Not that I'm a big fan, but it goes down pretty darn easy. I'm not huge on hops and this wasn't overwhelming, so that's probably part of the reason I'm good with it. It doesn't leave much of an aftertaste either, so that's a bonus. Other than that it's pretty average and nothing to get terribly excited over."
"Can be sessioned well and not too heavy for a summer day."
"I was impressed however with this ale's drinkability. It wasn't overly smooth and had a very good hop presence."
"Taste was about the same as aroma. The biscuit seemed to fade. A balanced beer between sweet (at first) and dry (finish)."
