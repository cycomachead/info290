"The smoothest and best tasting I've had in a long time."
"Bought a variety pack of Guinness beers.  Liked this one the least of the four, but it was still a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : Visually stunning and...poor in flavors. The craft is good with a nice freshness, but it's a very soft beer that is overly accessible."
""
""
""
"Enjoy"
""
""
"(Draught in can)Clear classic Irish Ale ruby red colored body. Has the classic ""Guinness"" style foam head that's a a good finger thick and appear to be staying for the duration. Creamy malt spice aroma. Low carbonation. Crisp light sweet malt taste. Smooth velvet mouth feel with a faint feel of carbonation on the tongue. Refreshing and wanting more already."
""
""
""
"It has not been available in my area since back in the 20th Century. Out this year in a Guinness mixed 8 pack."
""
""
"-you can tell its Irish by its flavour"
"How smooth and creamy this ale is.  I only had it one other time on tap.  A similar cream ale to Boddingtons in my opinion.  Easy, drinkable beer."
"Had a bit of a bland, boring flavor. Drinkable, but"
""
"Pours a dark red color with quickly dissipating creamy head, a bit of which stays to the end. Very faint grain and malt aroma. Flavor is light caramel, nuts, milky-smooth and pleasantly malty. Medium body with low carbonation leads to a silky and creamy mouth feel that continues into a velvety finish. Subtle, but enjoyable and super drinkable."
""
"O- nitro cream ales have their time and their place, and when I'm in the mood for one, they hit the spot perfectly"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A beautiful chestnut color with a nitro-induced off-white head, this is otherwise an average and forgettable ale.  Smells of malt (very distant) and not much else. Nit has little hop character, except for some small balancing bitterness.  Smooth, but not a lot of flavor.  Nothing offensive, but not really worth the time."
""
""
""
""
"some floral comes through on the finish along with some bitterness from the malts. Pretty water"
"very poor not worth a review."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a lovely Irish red cream ale. Definitely one of my favourites down at the pub. Well-rounded and easy to drink."
""
"Poured an amber body with a nitro cascade that settled into a clear amber body with one finger of thick, creamy head. A very good looking pub ale, quite appealing. Scents of caramel, low toffee character and very light toasted malt and grassy hop aromas. Overall impression of aroma is of a clean, malty ale, true to style and pleasing. Flavor begins moderately sweet with notes of caramel and toast. Middle is medium dry, moving into flavors of lightly toasted bread and light toffee. Finish is medium-dry with a light roasted malt flavor, toffee, and toast. Aftertaste is lightly roasted malt and toasted, nutty malt. Overall impression is of a malt-forward ale that begins modestly sweet and finishes nicely dry. Very pleasant. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with medium body and light carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good Irish Red Ale, very pleasing. Overall this is a nice Irish Red. It has a true to style aroma and flavor with a creamy good mouthfeel. A good, simple pub ale."

"Nothing beats a creamy Kilkenny. Easily one of my top three favourite beers worldwide."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium red in color, thick creamy foam from the nitro pour.   Very mild in aroma and taste.   Very  easy drinking, smooth."

"My favorite beer by Guinness. Poured in tumbler. Ruby red with white finger and a half head. Smell is dry and malty, smells like a Guinness stout. Thick nitrogenated head to light syrup mouthfeel almost water like but slicker. Sweetish, dry."

"Really really really gooood"
"O â€“ Goes down very easy leaving a nice coating at the start which gives way eventually to a dry feel. This beer is pretty well balanced. Not particularly exciting or pronounced on any element in the scale this beer is a good session beer pleasing but not really anything to write home about."

"O: The nitro-tap makes this beer have an incredible mouthfeel that is both creamy and smooth."
""

""
""

"Initially, the beer displays a turbulent and hazy storm, with granular sandy liquid gradually settling to a pretty ruby hued body with a thick and pure tan collar. The aroma brings some sweet malt, lightly fruity, grain notes. Similar flavor. The nitro-tap really does wonders for beers of this ilk. Smooth and creamy. Easy to drink. No harsh flavors detectable. Simple and easy going. Nothing to wrote home about, but this is a solid beer to find when I thought perhaps there may be no decent beer options."

"I've always been content with this as a perfunctory default at that sort of bar, both here and even in Eire herself; but now, upon closer circumspection, a few blemishes become increasingly evident - a certain plainness all around, be it malt, hop, or well, overall flavour. Which, I suppose is this one's appeal at the pub - toss in the lower than average ABV, and this beer is sessionability, incarnate."

"O - good example of the style. The nitro tap helped out the scores for appearance and body, but overall I did enjoy it."

"Arrived in an official Kilkenny pint glass, deep reddish-brown with around two fingers of light tan foam. Kilkenny smells like faint caramel, with fruity notes and hints of floral hops. As is often the case, this example was served too cold but unfortunately the aroma remained subdued even after things warmed up. Taste is that of a classic mass-produced Irish red, with caramel/toffee the predominant malt flavor along with a little roasted barley and some red grape fruitiness. Body is rather thin and the beer comes off watery and on the bland side, but there is a tea-like tannic astringency that I like in this style and some earthy hops in what is a decent bitter finish. A bit of cardboard and metal make an unwelcome appearance but all in all I'd drink this before many other macro-brewed UK offerings. Its designed with ""drinkability"" in mind: Smooth creamy mouthfeel and few overtly loud or bombastic flavor elements to dissuade the average pubhound."

"Was extremely happy with this beer. Had it while at an Irish pub in Canada. The taste was very good and the creamy head (which never dissipated) gave a sweet taste to counteract any bitterness. My first impression that it would be extremely heavy which at the time would be bad because I was about to enjoy a nice Irish meal, but the beer was much lighter than expected. If I could find this stuff in the US, I'd be getting some for the holidays!"

"O-easy drinking, but not overly flavorful"
""
""
""
""

"This beer has some features that are redeeming but in the end it just doesn't hold together well. The taste, aside from the metallic aspect, wasn't too bad, but there was not much depth or body to hold it together after the creaminess goes down. I would have this over a AAL and its an interesting style to try but I'd like to assume I can find more interesting examples."

"Great looking beer when poured and settled but everything else about it was fairly average sadly. The aroma was bland and unexciting, definitely not an ale worth looking out for. I'm not sure if it would be better on draft and I'm not sure if I really want to find out either.It was drinkable and the nitro can was a plus."
"All I really have to say is this beer feels like a practical joke. It looked like it would be a decent beer since it was poured from a nitro tap and I had to wait 5 minutes for the head to settle to even taste the damn thing, but alas, a flavorless waste of time. Instead of straight up slamming this beer I'm just gonna say drink anything else that is available. You'll make the right decision."

"D - Definitely a big letdown for me. Maybe I got a bad can, maybe it's old, I don't know. I recall having this on tap a while back and I don't remember any terrible off flavors. Another one to re-review down the road I guess. Shame."
"A nice way to cap a train trip out of the City and as a prelude to a nice sushi dinner from down the street. This stuff pours a lightly hazy bronze topped by a nice finger of cream foam. The nose comprises light sweet malt and even lighter powdered sugar. I think some light sweet flowers may have wafted in there from time to time as well, but I could have been imagining things. The taste brings in more of the same, flowers and all, only stronger and with an addition of mild caramel and even milder grass. Th body is a light medium, with a firm nitrogenation and a subsequently silky-smooth feel. Overall, this stuff wasn't bad at all. I could easily see myself downing pints of this as a Guinness replacement at Irish-style pubs around here (if they carried it...)."
""
""
""
""

"Overall I like to drink this when I'm having a few in an Irish pub, don't think I'd buy it to drink in the house though. The low abv and easy drinkability makes this excellent for long sessions."
""
""
""
""
"O: Extremely easy to drink but not a lot of specialness in the taste or smell - this beer's best qualities are the appearance and the mouthfeel. Definitely enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is NOT a beer that will impress you through your tastebuds. Rather, it's the kind of beer - like draft Guinness - that only works in the right situation; yet when it does, it inspires the ability to put down multiple pints of this in a single sitting. Accept it for what it is, and you might enjoy it a lot. It gets high marks here just because it's so easy to down."
"Interesting to compare after a Guinness - much lighter all in all."
""
""
""
"Overall- I loved this beer from the tap and from the can. This might just be my favorite session beer that isn't a microbrew."
""
""
""
"Definitely worth trying on tap."

"O- Passable beer. Might be a good standby when Guinness runs out."
""

""

""

""
"Final Grade: 2.97, a comfortable C. If I had to choose between this and Guinness it'd be a tossup; they're of comparable quality but I doubt I'd ever be in a situation where nothing better is available. Kilkenny is just more cream and less roast. I wouldn't turn this down, but it's not something I'd want to be a staple... at least it makes for a decent St. Patrick's Day session."
""
""
""
"O - good beer, but not something I feel is worth having too often"
""
""
"O-Very refreshing,but nothing 2 special about this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - One of the brews I like to revisit once in a while, when I'm looking for a mild brew. A decent cream ale, but could use a little work to avoid wateriness. Beautiful appearance is noteworthy."

""

"Serving type: nitro-tap"

"O/D - Smooth. Extremely uncomplex. Simple and drinkable, yet in no way interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a nitro tap into a Smithwick's glass. Nice ""raining"" as the beer settles, leaving a thick, foamy head. Smells sweet and creamy. Flavor is creamy, roasted barley; mildly bitter with hints of black coffee. Unique and very tasty."
""
"Not a very well balanced beer and one that I would probably not seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was worth trying once, but I'd much rather have a Tetley's if I wanted a lighter ale on nitro."
"Pours a dark copper with an inch foamy off-white head. Leaves a good amount of lacing along the glass. Smell is sweet and malty, but the taste is a little flat. It's smooth and creamy, but just not a lot of character to it. If you're looking for a smooth ale, I'd go with Tetley's or Boddington's Pub Ale. This one pales in comparison."
"Overall - This is the type of beer that I feel like I could drink a dozen of with no issues. It goes down way too easy and it has a fantastic appearance in the glass. The taste is pretty subtle, but that adds to the drinkability."
"D- Not a bad beer, but doesn't hold a candle to some other Irish beers."
"O: a good ""irish red"" from the nitro, but I'd take a Guinness for what I got for this and be happier."
"O - Nothing big or complex about this but a real looker and ice-cream smooth for what that's worth and perfectly sessionable."
"o - Very pleasant and drinkable macro-beer. Definitely one of the best imports available in South Africa, and worth the price. This is the first time I've had it in the nitro-can, although it still came off rather well I would still prefer draught."
"O- It's easy drinking, but the depth and volume of flavor is not there."
"O: Save the missing and vegetal nose a winner for what it is. I wasn't expecting much and it delivered above expectations."
"Smell is blocked slightly by the heavy head, but there are hints of mild roasted malt. Taste is low key. Barley, wheat, roasted smokey flavors pop hear and there. Hints remind of guiness...slightly coffee flavoring. The feel is what does it for this brew. Incredibly rich and creamy thick feel in the mouth. Little to no carb from the base of the beer, but my goodness every sip captures some of the huge head on top and it is like a nice iced coffee that has been frothed. Overall, a nice cream ale. Really lives up to in on the feel, but could certainly use a bit more in the flavor and smell department...especially with the lack of carbonation in the beer itself."
"Had it in San Antonio and fell in love with it. It's not the greatest beer ever, but very smooth, has a Guinness type feel drinking it. It is very hard to find so when I find it again, I will def get it. I enjoyed this beer and wish they had it in cans or bottles around me."
"This was a pleasant surprise. In Montreal sampling as many as I could find and stumbled along this Irish red. Pours a reddish amber, some lacing along the sides of the glass. Smell is faint but smells malty, even spicy. Taste is of malty sweetness, drinkable and mouthfeel is creamy enough. There was nothing really spectacular about this beer but it was a solid drinkable brew."
"Yeah, so have a Kilkenny."
"Poured a lovely two-finger frothy head that died ever so slow on top of a brownish body. Very mild aroma of citric, bitter hops and sweet malts, but almost non-existent. While it is somewhat smooth and creamy, it can also be said to be almost watery. Very little hop or sweet malt tastes; just kinda goes over the tongue w/ a little noise and finishes easy. It was an alright beer to sip on at the pub while playing darts w/ my buddies but nothing else to say other than an average beer at best."
"Overall: Nice drink for pubquiz"
"How disappointing. I drank a bit of this years ago and thought it was good but not anymore."
"O- This beer is light everywhere except in the appearance. A interesting beer for the fact that I didn't expect much of this and it delivered a little more than I thought it would."
"Overall Impression- I wasn't ready for this Irish Red Ale to be so good! It was an easy drinking beer and almost felt like there should have been some futbol game in front of me while drinking it. Had good attributes all-around and since I had everything else on-tap, this was a fun one to go."
"M: Head is creamy and smooth, like nitro-poured stout should be. Medium-bodied with little carbonation."
"Dr: Average or below average ABV depending on your perspective, extremely drinkable, and a great price in France. You won't find it out of the bottle back home. Tastes a bit different (especially those damned esters!), but still of course a welcome beer anytime. You owe it to yourself to give it a go, especially if she's off the draught."
"It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. I wish I'd gone with one of the local brews also served on-tap but I felt like I needed to try something from across the pond at a Scottish pub. I won't seek this out again."
"The aroma was a subdued grain malt scent and just a hint of yeast. The flavor was the same, pleasantly neutral. The body was nice, full and smooth. Drinkabilty was good, the went nicely enough. Overall, a decent, if unspectacular, beer. Worth trying if you see it, probably not worth seeking out."
"Overall its not bad, very easy to drink but not the most exciting!"
"Looks like a red Guinness. The color was a very nice looking clear amber. The head was creamy thick and white from the nitro. The aroma had some sweet malts in there not a whole lot else going on in the way of smell. The taste was very smooth and had some hearty malts in there. The mouthfeel was light and had no carbonation. This beer went down like water to me. I could have drank several of these without any issue for sure. A very nice Irish Red here. Enjoyed it fully."
"O; malty ale not that exciting but a nice beer after work. a tipical irish red ale with low alocohol. i like the american styls better more taste."
"Fairly gentle, drinkable beer. I'm a sucker for just about anything decent on nitro-tap."
"O: I just don't enjoy these nitro cans. Not that the nitro can had anything to do with the lack of aroma and taste. But they just seem to watery for me. Not something I'd recommend. The appearance is the only good part."
"Overall: I guess I just don't like this style."
"O- It is what it is, alright! It's St Patricks day afterall! Great appearance & mouthfeel is what this beer is all about, there's nothing off putting. I've got a soft spot for this one."
"Happy St. Patty's Day everyone!"
"A good standby around St. Patrick's Day or whenever I find myself in one of those pseudo-Irish chain bars Canada seems to have in spades. I can certainly have quite a few of these in a sitting - the light ABV and thin mouthfeel make for easy drinking."
"D: not bad. Kind of reminds me of Smithwick's. Nothing earth shattering here."
"poured from a 440ml can the colour is dark amber with a creamy off white head. The nose is very sweet and malty. I get alot of sugary candy too. The taste is pretty much the same and the mouthfeel is flat and very creamy. Only the slighest amout of bitterness on the finish. Not a great beer, but there is enough here to keep you interested and its very easy to blow through quite a few in short order making this a great sports beer down at the local pub. Which I believe is what its supposed to be."
"From the Pub can that contains a floating widget. One of the creamiest heads on a beer. Head lasts unti the bottom of the glass. Really sweet aroma of candy and caramel. I know beer is supposed to have hops but I would be surprised if this had any. Creamy, smooth, goes down easy. This is as just as drinkable as water."
"Easy drinkable, at least it has more characters than any nitro-tap beer that I ever had."
"D: This is a nice session beer in the vain of Tetley's and Boddington's. It's not terribly complex, but does its job well enough."
"Overall - For a macro that's readily available, it's pretty good. It's easy to drink, and has enough complexity and taste that it's a ""go to"" if only the typical macro line-up is available. It's hard to find ales here in Austria in general, so I'm glad this is around and easy to find."
"A good beer to have while in Ireland and different than anything I have ever tried before."
"Food match: Oysters or light game hen with a green salad (rocket) and mashed potato."
"The beer had a light feel to it, as expected, but the beer was extremely drinkable, crisp, very smooth and very creamy. I could drink this beer all day every day."
"Serving Type: Nitro-can"
"When poured from the tap, there was not a ton of foam in the glass, but, two tons and after finishing off the pint, there was one ton of lace on the side of the glass. The color was a light hazy cream brown when served, but after a few minutes, the color was of a clear medium goledn brown. The smell of roasted malts and a hint of spice? or fruit? or whatever had a pleasant aroma. The taste was of the sweet/bitter roasted malts and a nice balance of, whatever the components were in the ale. I really enjoyed it, especially being in an Irish Bar in SF."
"The ABV is low at 4.3%--a perfect choice for session drinking. One of my early favourites."
"D- Give this to me any time and I'm gonna enjoy it! With or without food, this is so easy to drink...low alcohol, creamy, sweet throughout, yet bittering enough to just balance the flavor profile. A great starter for anyone just discovering beer outside of BMC types, and just a great session beer!"
"I've never had an Irish Red on nitro before, so how could I turn this down. This pours a beautiful cascading ecru foam leaving a firm fat finger of head. This covered a nice amber red body that is how it was supposed to look. The aroma was rather bland in nature there was a bit of hop and green apple. The flavor consisted mostly of malted barley and green apple. The green apple almost made me think I had mistakenly ordered a cider, but this was not true. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. The flavor however was muddled greatly due to the nitro tap. I'm not sure how good it was supposed to be but the kind I had was extraordinarily water. This is the worst mouthfeel I've ever given a nitro-tap. It was drinkable no real problems taking it down, but It's not really the best beer I've had from Guinness, but it held it's own, and was definitely an interesting experience."
"The Crack & Glug also included some odd noises as a result of the widget priming itself, I suppose. Man, I do love watching the cascade when pouring from an N2 CAN!It resulted in a finger of thick tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep-coppery orange with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a lightly malty sweetness which was okay with me. Mouthfeel was creamy, which is as it should be with this serving style. The taste was pleasantly mildly bitter with a hint of nuttiness on the tongue. Finish was slightly dry, pleasant, easily quaffable. This was a nice, simple beer, somewhat unobtrusive, but with such low alcohol that I could easily see having it in my cooler for a day out."
"Kilkenny pours a murky brown with a light tan head. Light aroma, hard to get anything but some mild malt. Flavor fails to impress, mild nutty malt and lactose are there but very light. The mouthfeel is so slick and dare I say too smooth, since it lacked any real body or substance. I'd stick to Smithwicks, Guinness or Harp over this one."
"Pours a pretty dark gold almost a light red. very nice creamy head. kinda smells and tastes like a guinness yet without the roasted notes but they are a bit noticeable in this one. aftertaste is just like a guinness imo. also tastes pretty watery but a good kind of watery.. not like light beer, but it actually tastes like this was brewed with good quality water.. and it goes down pretty good. not something i would drink too often as it isnt really my thing but its pretty good and i could see a few people really take a liking to it."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"Pours a deep amber colour with a finger of thick white head. Head doesn't dissipate at all and leaves nice rings of lacing on the glass. Smell is of sweet toasted malt with the slightest hint of floral hops. Flavour is balanced of sweet and bitter, but it is a bit lacking overall. Mouthfeel was very creamy. A nice beer to have sometimes, but it is just ok."
"In the end, a drinkable beer and mostly enjoyable, but a fuller mouthfeel would really help it. Not my favourite, but okay."
"Cheers!"
"D-not robust at all. the light flavor is disappointing after an appealing aroma. I would not have this again."
"Overall, not terrible, but lacks depth. Fairly easy to drink, but you teeter on the edge of mediocrity/boredom with this one."
"D: This is, as I said before, made to be an easy drinker. Better than some other big name Irish Reds. An ok choice, but more taste in the bottle."
"I don't dislike it but it seems average."
"D: A nice alternative to Guinness for me to have with my rasher cashel blue cheeseburger and fries."
"Pours a dirty anber color with a fist thick frothy head which gave way togobs of lacing up and down the glass. The aroma was of faint malts with a hint of fruit notes. The taste followed suit with a nice malt backbone, caramel and english malts with a slight musty wet hop bite and some mild fuitiness. The mouthfeel was mild carbonation and dry. The drinkability was high, a very easy drink, nice flavor with a nice balance of bitterness and sweet. You could easily drink more than one of these."
"D - Dry and bitter, this comes across more like an English bitter than an Irish red. Even so it would be a poor bitter with a weak malt profile that is not up to dealing with the strong hop character. A drinkable beer, and perhaps better than average as Irish beer goes, but not something to go for if you have access to any real beer."
"I'm not a fan of Irish Red, and Kilkenny does not really improve that view."
"Overall - A nice refreshing beer - perhaps more typical of an English Mild but not particularly malty."
"Comes out of the tap a clear, dark golden amber with a very fine-bubbled creamy-white head. Aroma is malty, slightly fruity and slightly hoppy, not all that strong but still appealing. Flavor is malty and somewhat, but not nastily, bitter, with a whisper of fruit. Texture is velvety smooth and slightly fizzy so it goes down the pipes nicely."
"Tastes like what Boddington's goes for but doesn't quite accomplish: a very smooth, lightly fruity, lightly hoppy english pale."
"There are no bad tasting flavors in here, so in that regard it's drinkable, and at only 4.3% abv you don't have to worry about the alcohol, but if you're looking for something tasty, this isn't it. As another reviewer put it ... ""it's good for washing down the pub food", but that's about it."
"Pours a clear amber brown color with a typical white nitro head. Hardly any aroma. Medium-bodied and creamy. Has a light flavor which is hard to describe... some malts, a slight bit of sweetness, and a bit of bitter hops in the aftertaste. A pleasant and enjoyable nitro-tap beer that works nice as a session beer."
"Surprisingly good compared to the rest of the Guinness ""family""."
"Overall there's really nothing special about this beer but it is easy to drink. Not worth seeking out but also not worth turning down."
"Overall a decent ale on nitro."
"D - The last time Ive had this beer was probably seven years ago in Singapore and I remember it being better then I think I'd rather have a smithwicks or Guinness over this"
"The nose is slightly malty but also offers the flavor of a roast, however slight. The palate is clean and smooth but also very watery and not have to be a genius to understand that this beer does not drink it, even if it is obviously regret a flagrant lack of taste. We emphasize, however, some hints of caramel in the finish with hop bitterness and bubbly."
"Feel/Drink: Mouth is very thin. I expected a lot more out of a cream ale. Drinkability is decent at best."
"Taste is nothing special, but its worth a try because of the creamy smoothness."
"I could see throwing back a few mugs for a nice pub session or just having one to cut the grease associated with a plate of fish and chips."
"Pours a hazy tarnished gold and amber color with the look of a nitro pour - stiff, creamy head, cascading etc. Good retention and sticky lacing. Smell is almost non existant, only the slightest hints of fresh grain and not much more. Taste brings a little bit of carmel sweetness and fresh grain, faint touches of earthy hops, the nitro must be covering up an already mild flavor. body is nice, creamy, smooth. An ok beer, just wish the scent and taste exibited some boldness to cut through the nitro pour."
"Disappointing."
"D- Goes down super smooth... almost like a creamy glass of water!! Very drinkable and very sessionable."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served with my Irish Breakfast on St. Patrick's Day. It has a rising foam head, like a Guinness. It's a think, white cream foam about 1 finger in height. The body is clear and colored dark copper. There aroma isn't very strong, just a whiff of grain and slight glassy hops. It has an all-malt flavor. There is a hint of caramel, but nothing spectacular. There is a dry, toasted grain finish. It has a medium body. There isn't much carbonation in the beer, but the foam head is nice and creamy. It has a normal amount of coating. It's very drinkable. It doesn't have the best taste, but it certainly goes down easily. You could drink this one all day, if you weren't looking for a beer to focus on (i.e. it beats the bland, mass-produced domestics, but doesn't compare with many craft beers)."
"Drinkability: Instantly forgettable. My goodness, was that ever a whole bunch of nothing, lacking entirely in the departments of aroma and flavor. Sure, it's smooth and easy-drinking, but if it isn't going to taste like anything, what's the point?"
"Overall a good cream ale, but the taste could be improved. It looks absent..."
"I had never heard of the beer before I saw it on tap so I didnt know what to expect, I probably wouldnt order another one but it wasnt a bad beer."
"D - This is a fine anytime macro-beer. This is what large wealthy beer companies should try to make. Easy to drink. Non-offensive to beer novices and snobs alike. Very sellable."
"On nitro tap at the Lansdowne Pub near Fenway. Not on the menu, but I saw the tap handle behind the bar. Served in a Kilkenny glass, which is another thing I like about this pub (unrelated). Super dark red color, almost brown. Nice thick and rich creamy head on top. Had a bit of a malty and floral smell. Taste was not overwhelming, but just good enough. Hints of roasted barley here and there on the palate. I don't normally order Irish Red style beers, but I certainly will again if it's on nitro. It really adds a nice layer of texture to the beer that I enjoy. The low abv made this beer an easy drinker. While not the most flavorful beer, it was a nice pairing to my bangers and mash dinner."
"pours a dark amber colour with a beautiful thick creamy head. Attractive aroma. tastes dry with hints of caramel and malt also packed with plenty of hops. this beer goes down extremely smoothly and is highly enjoyable to drink. all in all its a great beer and one of favourites that i'd highly recommend."
"D: Goes down, almost to easy. You could call this a ""beginners-ale"" - many of the greatness from ales are present, but very mildly."
"Poured a deep reddish color with excellent carbonation and a nice creamy white head. Nose is dry, caramel malt, but thats about it. Taste is grains, caramel and dry but creamy. Mouthfeel is sordove creamy but light on ABV for sure. Not much going on."
"Watch your pour and enjoy the beautiful cascade effect."
"Drinkabilty:: Good...& will & have had more"
"I'd push for a little more carbonation to giver a lighter feel than this beer. It's a fair bit too dense in my opinion."
"It is a shame you cannot get this state side... some one needs to get this states. Great beer from the little islands."
"Smooth, light, bittersweet, unassuming. Nice on a summer's day. I like it, but not necessarily love it."
"there are much worse beers out there that you can drink but this was a little boring"
"I've had this in nitro-can as well, and would ding it down a couple of notches in that presentation."
"Overall, a little bit too subdued, but one could do far worse."
"D: for a nitro, fairly solid. The last cream ale I had was quite a while ago (Spotted Cow from New Glarus) and I can barely remember that."
"Overall, kinda boring. I remember being bored with this from the tap, and it's the same from a can. Nothing off-putting about it, but nothing compelling either. Just, boring."
"Easy to drink, but almost tasteless. This would give American lagers a run for their money!"
"Pours a ruby with a thick rich creamy head from the nitro. Nose is lightly sweet maltiness, that's about it. Tastes like a creamy less bitter Smithwick's, moderate malts giving it body but not making it too heavy. Very drinkable and refreshing."
