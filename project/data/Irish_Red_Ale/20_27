3.52,5.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a crystal clear medium gold color with a smallish white head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of bready caramel malt and light earthy hops to counter. The flavor is what I expected from the aroma. Sweet bread and caramel with hints of fruit and earth. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Serviceable ale, reminds me of something I would have been really into about 10 years ago, but today its just ok.","johnnnniee","Apr 17, 2014"

Taste is slightly below average, but its close enough to a 3...Crisp malt flavors, slight sweet fruit notes and a hint of yeast. its not bad, but there are better options out there.

2.82,-15.6,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, muddled, copper-yellow coloring with a frothy, white, small bubbled foam of head about half an inch tall. Aromas are light and smooth, with a light sweetness atop some toasty and bready tones. Flavors are off-balance a bit, with a decent, strong roasted caramel malt backbone and some subtle fruit highlights overpowering any of the toasty and biscuity qualities that were present in the nose. The beer is light to the point of watery in mouth, which makes it easy to drink, but not overly rewarding. The aftertaste is cloyingly sweet, with a slight floral twist. The finish is a bit watery, and leaves a slight film behind. Like I said, it's easy to drink, but there are better beers worth your time and focus out there.","GarthDanielson","Mar 15, 2012"

The body is a clear radiant orangy amber, which doesn't exactly look like an Irish Red Ale to me but it still looks nice. There's not much smell, just some malt. The taste has malt, it's creamy, and a little sweet. Body is pretty light weight. This strikes me as a decent everyday workhorse beer alternative to BMCs.","MoreThanWine","Jan 11, 2012"

Really nice done but a touch light. This is my only complaint as it did not have the pop I was really looking for at the time. Smooth, even flavor really did not deviate much from beginning to end as the overall impact was nicely put together. A bit light on the feel","mikesgroove","Dec 10, 2011"

3.06,-8.4,4,3,3,3,3,"Looks good. Mostly clear, amber in colour, with a solid half inch of light beige foam. A bit sticky with good head retention. Malty aroma, a little toasty and buttery. Slightly metallic. Pretty much the same in the flavour, low bitterness, kind of fruity in the finish. The body was fine up front, but fell away at the end. Medium to low carbonation, sort of creamy. Not bad overall, but I'm not clamouring for more.","DrJay","Mar 05, 2011"

Smell had a hint of pine to it with some noticeable hops aroma. Flavor was very tasty, as there was plenty of malt to satisfy my palate. Mouthfeel was smooth and I definitely felt that this beer had a nice aftertaste to it. Drinkability was quite good, as this beer had enough body to stand up to grilled foods. A nice red ale to drink by itself or pair with food.","morebeergood","May 12, 2010"
3.33,-0.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a translucent copper with a frothy, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a thin, consistent skim. Some spots and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose reveals some caramel malt and fruity esters. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavor profile thins out a bit. Some biscuity malts also come out as well as a light hops bittering; fairly non-discrete. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Not bad, but a little lackluster","Jwale73","May 11, 2010"
3.57,6.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a ring, leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Bready nose.

2.74,-18,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"This beer pours a nice deep, clear amber color. The head is an offwhite color, relatively decent retention and slight lacing left on the sides. The nose is very weak, almost no scent at all. There is a touch of breadiness and pale malts, but other than that - not much to the nose. The taste is also very blase but a little more to it than the nose. Starts off with a malt flavoring, slightly sweet, slightly bready. Touch of hops but not enough or well blended to work well off the malt and sweetness. Medium bodied beer - decent carbonation, but a bit of a sour aftertaste to it. Overall, it's drinkable, but I would certainly pick something different. It's an ok beer but nothing really stood out.","Jayli","Mar 23, 2009"
3.95,18.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Nonthing fancy, but another solid New England beer. It makes love living in a region that's so prone to brewing its own beer, and doing it well.

2.92,-12.6,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,"This beer poured a copper-color with a two-finger head. The smell is caramel and toasted malt with a bit of nuttiness. The taste starts off with a slightly grainy sweet caramel taste that gives way to a metallic taste and a tiny bit of hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a some crisp carbonation. I'm not a fan of the metallic taste, but this isn't a horrible beer.","TheTrevor","Feb 08, 2009"

3.47,3.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I'm not a big fan of Irish Reds, so I need to preface any review with that disclosure. The beer is moderately carbonated, typically reddish in color, with some sweet malty caramel aromas, with the red fruity aromas typical of the style. The taste is malty, caramely, a bit flat tasting, some cloying sweetness, and the very typical copperish/reddish flowery taste of the Irish red ales. Nothing new in this beer. It is very typical of the style, nothing more, nothing less. It's okay, I'm not a big fan, I'm moving on.","albern","Apr 04, 2008"

2.73,-18.3,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"The beer pours a golden/light amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a pale and light crystal malt scent along with a fruity/sour yeast aroma. There is something wrong with the aroma. The taste is not very good. It has a real yeasty flavor that overpowers the weak malt bill. It seems almost past it's prime. The malt bill is simple and consists of pale and light crystal malts. Hops are faint and probably English noble varieties. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is the worst beer Wachusett makes. It's back to the drawing board with this one.","WesWes","Jul 11, 2007"

3.21,-3.9,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"This tasted different from the Quinn's I remember a few years back when it was labeled as an Irish Style Ale rather than an Amber Ale. If the formula has been ""tweaked"" in the process, it has not been to the overall benefit of the product. This used to be my favorite Wachusett seasonal. It now seems to be more of an average decent product but one with no special appeal to cause a followup purchase.","Greenlabel","Mar 18, 2007"

3.98,19.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with caramel malts throughout each sip. A nice hop presence helps balance this beer out. Wachusett brewery biscuit and bready flavors in there too. The feel on the palate is very ""soft"" and with syrupy malts.","Hibernator","Jun 12, 2005"
3.95,18.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Not one of my favorite style, but now definitely one of my favorite brews for the style. Pours a clay color, like infield dirt with a big foamy head and lots of lace. Aroma is malty with hops very faintly in the background. Flavor was very sweet malts and hints of some sort of nut. Chestnut perhaps? Kind of an earthy feel to the whole flavor. Made me think of a foggy morning. Mouthfeel is pretty well carbonated with a medium body. Finishes very crisp. Very smooth to drink and tough to put down.","MuddyFeet","May 31, 2005"
3.52,5.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Nice, if brief, hops at the front, then disappearing, evaporating, fading, along with the body. Begins medium, then bottoms out.

The taste was malty and only lightly hoppy with notes of caramel. Overall the flavor was ""mellow"". The mouthfeel was dry and smooth but with a crispness. It had medium body and moderate carbonation. Not much to say about this one, but it is a decent, easy drinking, not overly complex beer.","UncleJimbo","Oct 11, 2004"
3.45,3.3,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Clear copper appearance. Pale yellow head, creamy in texture, lasts at 1/4 of an inch for just over a minute. Spare lace, crown-like rings. Spicy aroma, light grape astringency with some nutmeg. Flavor starts easy going but oddly slick, a fruity sense with some pear flavors, honeyish as well. Keeps its texture but the flavor pans out to mildly watery mid mouth, the hops could step up to the plate more as well. Toward the end of the glass, I was picking up weird aftertastes, something like parmesan cheese. Good appearance and start, decent overall drinkability, the close was a little off for me.

4.01,20.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pint glass presentation. Fluffy off-white head on deep golden-brown brew. Malt outpowers the hops a bit on this one, but they have obviously worked hard to get both constituents in balance for this brew, in preparation for their prime St. Patrick's Day window of sales.
