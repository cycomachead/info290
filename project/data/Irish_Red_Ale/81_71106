3.92,22.9,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"From the bottle in their branded glass. Appearance is a translucent reddish-brown with a hefty head. Slightly fruity smell and starts with a sweet taste eventually going to bitter (which saves it since I don't like sweet brews). Feels medium-light bodied with a bit of hoppy bite. (I usually don't like strong aftertastes but it's not bad here.) Overall pretty good for a seasonal and a nice change from Newcastle Brown which I like alot.","Capt_Pete","Mar 05, 2015"

However, the real fireworks arrived upon the first sip with a powerful initial burst of flavor.  I generally try to be more flowery in my descriptions but the taste of this beer can only be compared to that of saddle sweat.

Having had a pitcher the first pint of Werewolf was pretty brutal to get through, but by the second I'd become immune to the taste. Werewolf is slightly carbonated but feels very flat.

As is my wont, I employed an aggro pour, allowing it to flow freely out of the bottle, which in turn began a pseudo-cascade that produced three fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention. I would put the color more as deep-copper (SRM = X), as opposed to "blood red", but neither am I going to quibble. Clarity was button-bright and I was ready to begin howling in response. Warren Zevon was doing "Werewolves of London" on YouTube and so begins the day. The nose had a strawberry/raspberry scent underlain by a bready maltiness. Mmmm. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was quite unexpected, even given the label's verbiage. It had an initial kiddie-candy like flavor that was overtaken fairly quickly by a tangy bitterness. Finish was semi-dry, with the rye giving it a slight bite at the end. This was an easily quaffable beer and disappeared more quickly than I realized.","woodychandler","Feb 21, 2014"

Popping the top I get a nice zesty roasted malt smell. Pours into a trusty pint to a deep bronze with a two finger foamy head. The taste starts with a nice hop bite the phases into a sweet yet tangy malt base then transitions to a gradually sweeter finish with a broad robust yet zesty bitterness fading in the background.

Light toasted malts cereal grains hints of herbal hops is the flavor profile I'm getting, the body and carbonation are standard for this type of beer.

Taste is subdued, soft nutty flavor, slightly muddy, not at all crisp; a charge of bitterness without any forward hop flavor. Very malty but not cleanly so. A drinkable session beer at 4.5% ABV, but muddled and dark tasting. A cleaner and clearer profile would go a long way in taking this from good to great.","Aaron_Ramson","Sep 14, 2013"

This stuff pours a clear sunrise copper-amber topped by a half-finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises toast, mild toffee, and a layer of dank dark greens pervading the background. The taste brings in more of the same, but this same is relegated to near-obscurity. What replaces it is an all-encompassing melange of extremely hard water and old-ass vegetables. Great. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty slick feel. Overall, this is just a bad mess of a beer, one that makes me wonder what the hell has happened to the Newcastle line.","TMoney2591","Aug 13, 2013"

For what it is, it is a good, solid ale that would be perfect with a basic dinner of roasted meats and vegetables. Classifying this as an Irish red ale, though, is a bit misleading in my opinion. This ale doesn't have enough of a caramel malt sweetness to be an authentic Irish red, and so, it is likely best to view this ale as a bitter. Reviewed as an Irish red ale, Werewolf is lacking, but taken as a bottled bitter, it is a pretty good effort for a mainstream commercial brewer.","mrfrancis","Beers"

3.65,14.4,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Picked up a 12-pack of bottles at a local bottle shop, and poured into a tumbler pint. The beer pours a ruby highlighted, copper coloring that is bright and vibrant, with a slow bubbling of carbonation. The head starts out pretty massive, as the beer pours with a ton of foam. An early three inches of foaming, frothy, off-white colored head eventually settles out into a dense, thin film. Good cling along the glass as the beer goes down. Supersweet nose of malt, nut, and plum/raisin. The beer has a smooth, rich flavor profile that comes through initially with hazelnut sweetness and a slight roasted coffee bitter to blend. Dark fruit highlights throughout the brew's flavors, with a wine-like character, as well. The aftertaste is mostly the wine and dark fruit characteristics from the end of the taste spectrum, and the finish is slow to clear, but clears completely. Interesting brew, and not too shabby. I'm not crazy about it, but it's something I would drink again.","GarthDanielson","Oct 16, 2011"
