"Three Floyds Brian Boru is an Irish Red Ale with a 5.5% ABV and 40 IBU's~ Pours rich and translucent Copper red, Caramel tints when light up~ Nose is full bodied with Tobacco, Bubble Gum, Grapefruit, Pineapple, Caramel, Chocolate and Toffee~ The feel is Medium, Creamy, Rich and well balanced, delightful~ Tons of tiny Bubbles, Big white head with tons of lacing~ Taste is Strawberry, Caramel, Toffee, Bread, Cream, Toast, Citrus, Honey, Brown Sugar and some Pine and Oat~ Honestly really nothing jumps out... Expect the fact that its extremely well balanced~ I would say a nice even balance of Hops and Malt~ Really just a perfect brew for session drinking~ Such a great take on what is traditionally a rather boring and dull style~ I can't believe I'm tasting 'Strawberry' in a NON sugary processed adjunct ale, Its naturally sweet and delicious~ Overall: 92"

"O Sessionable for sure! delicious with a good mix of earth and juicy fruit with a strong malt presence. smells completely different than how it tastes. /89"

"O- This was a decent Irish Red Ale that was definitely better then your average Irish Red, however there wasn't anything that really made this beer stand out. There was a nice underlying fruity presence and a nice sweetness but the beer still remained a little bit one-dimensional."
""

""

"Poured this 22 ounce bomber into a weizen glass (for size, not style). Color is a cloudy deep copper, with an inch-deep ivory head, well-structured but not persistent. Citrus hops scream on the nose, with more subtle caramel notes hiding beneath. More hops on the palate, but of the piney variety and more than a little tart, giving way gradually to undertones of toasted malt. The body is a bit flabby with little carbonation and a non-descript finish. Generally enjoyable and refreshing but I would have expected a bit better focus from this brewery."

"O: As previously mentioned, this is how FFF does an Irish Red - and it's awesome. FFF makes a lot of great beers, and this one is near the top for me. Fantastic beer that hop heads and malt heads can all enjoy."
""
""
"This does not get the name recognition as some of the other Three Floyds beers do, but it is definitely a solid Irish Ale."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, Spring 2013 bottling. Pours lightly hazy reddish orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, grapefruit, orange zest, floral, grass, slight pine, and light yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with all around great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with moderate hop presence and good strength. Taste of caramel, apple, golden raisin, grapefruit, orange zest, toast, toffee, floral, grass, light pine, biscuit, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, citrus, floral, grass, toast, toffee, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, fairly crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Irish Red style! All around great complexity and balance of malt, hop, and ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

""

"Taste: Starts off with a hoppy bitterness that fades into a sweeter maltiness that I would expect more from a red."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I love me some FFF, but this one is a miss. I do not really get what the goal for this brew was. Flavor seem to get lost and are overall forgettable."

"Beer is medium-bodied with medium-light carbonation intensity, leading to a smooth, somewhat crisp, slightly foamy beer that's easy upon the palate. Closes fairly dry, with fairly substantial stickiness remaining across the palate."

"Overall, it's a shame this doesn't come in 6-packs. I normally shy away from Irish style beers, but this is great."
""
""
""
""
""
"There's enough bulk to this beer to support the strength and depth of flavors, but it doesn't drop off under the weight. It actually has a nice creaminess to it right up front along with the crispness that remains strong to the end."
""
""
"O- Love the Amarillo hops twist on the Irish style. Only downside may be it seemed a bit too divided from the carmel/pineapple vs hops - there seemed almost a clear division. And, wish it was a bit thicker and frothier. That said, all great flavors, dank nose was really nice. This may be one of the best Irish style beers I've had. Three Floyds continues to impress."
""

""

"O-Never thought I'd have an Irish Red this well made. The best of the style I've had."
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this take on an Irish red ale. I'm not usually a huge fan of this style but Three Floyds adds their signature hop twist which results in a unique and perfectly balanced beer. I loved the atypical tropical fruit notes in the aroma. The rest of the beer is very true to style and pretty tasty. It's a really nice, easy drinker. I honestly couldn't imagine a better interpretation of an Irish red."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-I would have to say that this is a miss for three floyds. Or it could be that their other brews are so good you expect that from them every single time. Their is quality here, you can taste it in the hops put forward. It's not bad by any means but it just doesn't do it for me. 3.5"

"Very interesting beer. Not sure if it is supposed to highlight the hops or the malts, but an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An easy-drinking Irish red. If you like Gumballhead, I think you'll like this too. Since it's a seasonal, it's probably just a once-a-year purchase for me."
""
""
""
""
"As usual, another stellar beer from 3 Floyds. I wanted to not like it because it's a style I don't care for but this is really good and goes down readily. The alcohol is relatively low so you can have at it and not worry about jail time."
""
""
""
"As with all things 3f, a hoppy example of the style. Good malt character, though, to carry it through."

"O- so this was a great red, and I'm glad I chose to pick it up. Most reds I've had punish you with malt but this had a great balance with the hops without it being a hoppy beer. Three Floyd's always brings great beers and this is not different."

"Overall: Not my favorite style but why the hell does FFF almost always do it right and to the point where a non favorite style of mine becomes a win in my books. Once again they just continue to wow me and this one too has wowed me."
""
""
""
"Initial scent of cereal grains, toasted breads, and a dab of marmalade spread on top. Flavor is more toffee-centered, but still has toasted bread with bitter orange peel marmalade used as balancing material against the malts. There is a very light roasted coffee and chocolate malt nuance that doesn't really appear until the glass warms up for a while. Overall, very well done!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Perhaps it is a personal affinity for red ales, but this beer is simply wonderful. It goes down so smoothly, begs you to continue drinking it, and makes you lament the empty bottle sitting in front of you as the last drops slide down your throat. The toffee notes really make this beer a special red ale. It does not quite top the brilliance of Tocobaga, but if that beer is not available in your neck of the woods, this will certainly fill the void as the differences are almost negligible. 17.5/20"
""
"Overall, this really is a wonderful beer. The balance is really as close to perfect as I think you can get. This is my first beer from Three Floyds after finally tracking some down in KY. Not sure when I'll be able to pick up some more but I am very anxious to try some of their other offerings."

"I picked up a bomber of this at 3 Floyds in early 2012 for $8. Pours a dark copper orange with a fluffy head. Scent is hoppy mixed with pineapple delivering a thick, flavorful taste. Very nicely blended ingredients that makes for a great sipping beer."
""
"This beer pours out a hazy amber with two fingers of head. The aroma has a fantastic citrus and floral hop nose. There's some caramel malts in there as well. The taste follows the nose, with a big burst of juicy hops at first. This is followed up by toasty grains and caramel malts. The best of both worlds. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is fantastic. This is just a great beer. I could see this being a favourite at the bar, that is if I could get it there. It's cut from the same cloth as beers like Lagunitas Imperial Red and Cigar City Tocobaga, but ""lighter"" feeling."
"Poured into a standard pint and enjoyed over good conversation, this beer pours a pretty standard amber in color with two fingers width of clingy white head. Smell is nice and hoppy.. Citrus notes, and sweet toffee. Taste is strongly balanced with those citrusy hop notes presenting them selves once again, nice mild malt.. Toffee and caramel with just a hint of toasted grain. Really well done, This beer was way to easy to enjoy"
""
""
""
"medium body with a slight creamy feel. lightly carbonated.. overall i'm kind of disappointed in this one. 3f makes some awesome beer, and i was hoping they'd step it up a bit when it comes to such a bland style, but they went the traditional route. it's not bad for a red, but not really what i was expecting from the brewery."
"A hopped-up, super tasty version of an otherwise pretty lame style. Well done, FFF!"
""
""
""
"O) Man, I really do enjoy red ales with a bit more hops. This one is really tasty. I rank it right up there with Cigar City Tocobaga and Lagunitas Lucky 13. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"totally unexpected for this style but the toasted caramelly malt grain are right on cue. Taste: There is a wondeful light hoppy citric/pineapple character that jumps right out in the flavor before the expected toasty bread elements and a slightly sweet caramel emerge. A deeper note of dark roasted coffee appears. Finally a delicious washing of juicy citrus into the finish which is dry with a lingering interplay of coffee roast bitterness and citric juiciness. If there is any disappointment its the body, which seems a bit on the light side to me. Very interesting and enjoyable twist on the dry, malt forward Irish red style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with just the slightest copper hue. The white head attenuates very quickly to a thin cap and, then, to nothing but a few bubbles.  Very light notes of Amarillo hops in the nearly absent bouquet. The mouthfeel is very pleasant with a thin, oily, moistness that would make nearly anything taste better. Clean Amarillo comes through with a little more grain depth than Gumballhead or Pride and Joy. There is a discernible flavor of peat in this beer that seems to define it's overall character. Not a bad effort. Not stellar either. "

"A very good beer, but somewhat middle of the road for 3f."

"Despite some interesting and unexpected fruity hop character this is still an easy-drinking pint with malt-focused flavors and a dry, roasty finish. Were it easy to obtain in the SF Bay Area, I'd put this near the top of my list for go to examples of the style. Thanks again, Mike for including this in the box!"
"Feels creamy from the malt, then gets a nice shot of bitterness to cut it off. Starts off sweet, then ends dry."
""
""
"Pours a dark murky orangish red with a yellow tinted white head, tons of it with tight bubbles leaving a thick lace. The nose is sweet and grainy with a slightly off twang to it. The grain smells stale and the hops oily with a fleshy orange peel. The taste has a huge toasted malt and chocolate malt flavor that was unexpected. The hop presence is much lighter than in the nose and actually more balanced. Lightly citric and bitter with a moderate sweetness, crisp finish with an assertive carbonation."
"The beer had a medium body to it that had a nice amount of carbonation to it. The beer was creamy, a bit sticky and finishes with a nice dry balanced taste. Overall, high quality from this brewer and the next time that my wife is in Indiana, I will have her pick more up."
""
""
"Overall, I'm impressed once again. If you're not a fan of Red Ales I would still try this one if you can find it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter bodied with a pleasant creaminess."
"Overall, 3 Floyds did it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"A real fun beer, not sure if I would highly desire this in the style, I'd look towards a meaty more malt backbone but it is quite unique and tastes real good. Another win for the Floyd here glad to have tried it. Would have again anytime."
""
"A clear golden copper color with a solid off-white fluff and very good lacing. The aroma offers a mild citrus hop with pineapple and caramel with a bit of spicey yeast. The flavor brings a unique grassy hop bitterness and tropical fruit sweetness. Once again I get plenty of caramel with definite honey. This is medium bodied with full but delicate carbonation. Feel is a little tingly/fizzy with a slightly glassy component. The hops are nicely prominent without taking away from the style. Grassy and a bit herbal, they finish with a bit of dryness which balance off the sweet clover and makes for a pretty unique but satisfying (and drinkable) Irish Red! A solid brew for sure."
""
"As a person who liked hoppy beers, I like the smell of this one as it seems a bit hoppy for a red....which works for me. A very drinkable brew, quite tasty without the aftertaste of most of the hoppy brews that I like. This is the first place that I have found this brew, but if you can find it, I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
"It's quite balanced and drinkable... but a little hard to get in these parts."
""
"M- Nice and creamy, with the hops giving the beer a nice bitter leave that sticks incredibly well. The hoppy bitters dry the tongue, mmmm."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, smooth and easy to drink. This is a well made beer, and it is hard to believe that a beer with 5.50 % abv is packed with so much flavor. The best Irish Red Ale I have had by far."
""
"M - Medium bodied with light carbonation. One of the smoothest beers I have ever had, I love the low to medium carbonation, makes it a pleasure to drink"
"Easy drinking, and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Excellent red ale with a bit more hops than normal for the style. The balance is really nice and the beer has a great malty profile."
""
"D - Consensus seems to be that this is brewed very much out-of-style, but those FFF house hop notes work well here. I doubt I'll revisit again but worth the purchase."
"Beer pours a nice reddish/amber hue, just about what you'd expect from the style. Leave a marginal head that vanishes quickly with next to no lacing. The smell on this leans heavily towards the malted end of the spectrum. I like to smell a bit more hops, but perhaps my expectations for the style are off. There are some nice caramel and vanilla notes as well. The taste is strange. In addition to the malt forward character of this beer, it has a taste as though it's heavy in alcohol despite being only 5.5% ABV. Very odd. The mouthfeel is very malty in a way that sticks around and coats your mouth for an extended period of time. There's an astringent quality to this that I'm not too keen on, and again, it gives off a feel as though it's really boozy. Overall, this is average. Not one of my favorites from FFF."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Three Floyds did an amazing job with this brew IMO. The balance is fabulous and the complexity is awesome (for this style of beer). I found the transitions in the taste to be ""spot-on"" and it makes for a highly drinkable beer."
"This is an exceptionally easy-drinking, nice tasting beer. Very sessionable. Given its hop profile, I don't know if this is necessarily a good representation of the style, but it tastes damn good."
"O: Interesting contrast between the hops in the smell and the relative absence of them in the flavor. The aroma is its best characteristic. Quite extreme."
""
""
""
"O: A hoppy Irish Red with a restrained malt bill in the Three Floyd's style."
""
"O: This brew is exactly what you might expect: an Irish Red with FFF's signature delivered by an added level of hoppiness. A very enjoyable brew. Slainte!"
"Overall. Nice amber here with some interesting flavours going on."
""
"o: Don't have much experience with this style. Good flavor. Nothing extraordinary but good nonetheless. One to have on St Patrick's Day."
"-Festive with fun packaging and some overt flavors, but not necessarily interesting or exciting"
"O- good beer and very good Irish red. Will have again around St. Paddy's for years to come."
""
"22 oz bomber in tulip glass. This is the 3rd time I've had Brian Boru. Thick off white head. I'm a pretty experienced beer drinker, but I overflowed this. Heavy lacing. Regular 3 floyds west coast citrus nose. FFF is the best. Classic Irish red with FFF signature. Happy St. Patrick's day. Bomber #2 ready in fridge."
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: Picked this up for $6.99 in Ohio because I wanted to drink an Irish beer on SPD. This is tasting better than the month old Nugget Nectar that I had last night...no joke."
""
"A style I had started to move away from but Three Floyds really hits it well and makes it one of the best."
""
"O: This is a very good Irish red ale. I am sure that traditionally speaking, this is overhopped, but it really is an enjoyable beer for me."
""
""
""
""
"A big thanks to Billakowski for sending this one out my way! The beer poured out as a nice looking red/amber color with a light tan head on top. The smell of the beer was hoppier than I expected with some malt aromas coming off of it also. The taste of the beer gives off this really interesting musty/aged flavor. The flavors kept me guessing on what it was that I was tasting. The other flavors were of caramel and some bitter hops in the finish. The mouthfeel of this beer was smooth and lightly carbonated. Overall it's a good brew and I'm glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
"O- I really liked this one, a really tasty hop-forward take on a red ale."
"Smell was very harsh and kinda like BO. Taste was similar. Very harsh bitterness, some astringency, skunky (like Heineken), and a pleasant aftertaste was not left. No sweetness was detected."
"I am not kidding about this. It smelled and tasted like body odor. I would rather drink Bud Light than this."
"O: Surprisingly hoppy for an Irish red but that is no shocker coming from 3Fs. Very drinkable."
""
""
"As usual with FFF the style is hopped more aggressively than normal which is how I like my reds anyway. I'd had a few that are better, but this one is up there."
""
""
""
""
""
"From a bomber in a duvel tulip. Clear amber red with a 2 finger white head that fades slowly. Aroma is Amarillo hops, tropical fruit, and some toffee. Taste is of caramel, toffee, orange, and mild grapefruit. This red has somewhat of a tropical feel to it. The mouthfeel is creamy and the flavor lingers. Awesome Irish red."
""
""
"O: A very good Irish Red. Some might argue whether it should be considered as such but it always seems that 3f can take a beer style and add an interesting twist. I wish it wasn't seasonal but it does make for a good spring and summer beer."
""
""
"O: Really good beer. The sweet and bitter qualities of the taste is kind of unique and also quite delicious. Also, the mouthfeel is very nice and the beer is highly drinkable."
"O- Didn't know what to expect with this one but really loving it. For the price I may grab a few more bottles. Can't beat it"
"O- Certainly not a traditional Irish Red, tastes like a hopped up amber ale. This beer actually tastes more malty at first, but further along this really tasted more hopped up, especially with the big pineapple aftertaste."
""
""
"M/O - Medium body with great carbonation, chewy body and is soft of the palate. A little over-hopped for the style IMO but it is a ""not normal"" 3Floyds beer so that is to be expected but doesn't detract from how good it is. Either way it's a good beer and easy to drink."
"3.5 D: This is more like Alpha King than an actual Irish Red Ale. Oh well, it's tasty, but I was expecting an Irish ale so I'm a bit disappointed."
"O- This beer was about as good as I expected it to be and more weird then I expected but I never really know what to expect from 3F. Its not physically red and has citrus notes that embarrass many big IPA's so don't expect to be drinking a typical red here. This beer is as unique as they come and really defines a new style of beer."
""
"Draft to imperial pint. Looks good; red and pretty translucent, especially for a FFF beer (probably to adhere to the style). Smells good too; like a hoppy amber. Conjures up an image of a lighter Nugget Nectar. Tastes good, but much more like an IPA than an Irish Red (and it loses 1/2 point because of this, even though the taste itself doesn't warrant it). Mouthfeel is good too. Overall, a good beer that is miscategotized."
"D/O: A delicious, highly drinkable, enjoyable, repeatable hoppy treat. Just not much of a ""Red Ale", for those that are considering purchasing for that purpose. This is closer to 3F's Arctic Panzer IPA than it is what other breweries refer to as ""Red Ale", IMO."
"O: A ton of flavor for such an easy-drinking, low-alcohol beer. One of my favorite FFF monthly offerings so far."
""
"Cheers."
""
""
"Overall another solid offering from 3Floyds, I am going to have to hunt for another bottle or stop by the Lizard one more time this month for one more bottle."
""
""
"It pours a light bodied pure copper in color with a nice shine and good clarity. It reveals only a slight off white lacing around the glass. The nose is nice and fresh. It gives off aromas of citrus alongwith pine and a touch of onion. Not really typical for the style. The flavors are very light and crisp. It features light pine, light onion, and fades into some light toffee and amber malts. Probably as complex as it can be but most importantly, drinks very hoppy for the style. It's light and drinks pretty light in body. It's very refreshing. Overall this is a really nice Irish Red, probably the best around."

"Very nice...I would definitely try this one again!!!"

"Pours a hazy brownish Orange, with moderate tan head. Smell is hoppy with roasted malt. Flavor screams of caramel and maltyness. Medium body with underlying bitterness, tastes like tea. This is a very nice beer. There is a pleasant balance between the hop presence and the toffee/caramel flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll go B+ on this one, but have a feeling it might have been superb if it was fresh. I love that FFFs uses those Amarillo hops so well. A very distinct note that you are drinking one of their beers. Bravo."
"O: Overall not a bad irish red. Not my favorite style and this might be my favorite. I recommend letting it warm up, it is a totally different beer. I had to come back and edit my scores after letting it sit out for quite a while."

"O: Very easy drinking, had no problem with drinking it and would gladly do so again. Liked that this was a hopped up Irish Red, as it falls more in line with my natural taste. Another solid beer from FFF."
"Swee toffee, hoppy malt scent, almost like a hoppy stout. Deep dark thick amber color. Very nice mouth feel, clean and refreshing. Watery caramel, hops, with a touch of citrus. Also grapefruit and not very bitter in the taste or finish which is nice. Easy to drink and not as complex or harsh as some of their other beers which is a nice change of pace for them. A very nice ale."
"O - For me, the hop presence is a big improvement on a traditional amber. I would like to see more Irish red ales around. Would definitely like to try a fresh bottle."
"Brian Boru pours a very attractive reddish copper color. A two finger head recedes gradually leaving nice lacing and a thin white coaster. The nose is very hoppy. Smells like an IPA! Was not expecting that. Taste is hop forward at the start with some nice citrus characteristics. Hops give way to a nice malt backbone mid palate. Big caramel and toffee notes are present. Hoppy bitterness returns towards the end, and the finish is dry with a slight lingering bitterness. The beer is medium bodied with a bit of viscosity to it. Carbonation is medium. Overall, Brian Boru is a tasty, very drinkable brew from Three Floyds. I certainly appreciate their hoppy take on the style and would gladly have this again if given the chance."
"O - A good example of an Irish Red. Enjoyed!"
"O: Red velvet cake with hops. Truly an awesome brew. However, I'm not sure what the Irish would think of it..."
"Overall, I'm not sure that I would call this an Irish Red, but I would definitely say its an enjoyable beer that I would love to have on a summer day. The hop profile was very refreshing and mighty tasty. Definitely recommended."
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this red ale. Great combination of flavors that go through every range on your palate. It keeps drawing you back for more, and boy did I oblige."
"Medium mouthfeel with some typical hop oil texture. Overall, I really like this brew and would gladly have it again."
"The reveal is...Brian Boru Irish Red! Big Want of mine; thanks Kyle! I was hoping they would have this at the brewery when I went to DLD last month, but they didn't, so very glad to try this now. This is one of the FFF beers I hadn't had before tonight but I really enjoyed; the nose is amazing and makes this one of the better Irish Red ales I've had. Thanks again Kyle!"
"I like it but don't love it. I do like what I detect in the background but all the hops drown it out just a bit. That said, it's Three Floyds. That distinctive hoppy flavor is part of what makes them great."
"Overall: Brian Boru is a good session beer with big flavor, although a bit unbalanced."
"D: Brian Boru is a flavorful and pleasing beer that has a lower abv. I consider it to be one of my favorite monthly Three Floyds bombers. "
"(22oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!). Pours clear amerber color with white head and nice carbonation. Aroma has lots of pine/citrus-grapefruit and guava-and a hint of cardboard. Taste is sweet malt backbone with a light/bright bitterness. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Finish is bitter, but very pleasant. This is a really easy-to-drink beer because of its bright hops. There is so much flavor in this beer. Awesome beer!"
"O - a fine beer to be drinking for St. Patty's and beyond."
"D- Overall i think this is a great representation of this style, I could drink 2 or 3 bombers of this during a nice cookout. Love this beer. will get again"
"O - I enjoyed this brew from beginning to end; I will drink the hell out of it, should I see it again."
"Overall this is one of the most creative interpretations of the Irish Red as it's more or less a showcase for 3 Floyds' fondness for hops - especially their ace in the hole, Amarillo. I categorize this somewhere between Alpha King and Dreadnaught - it's like a beefed-up, slightly maltier Alpha King or a Dreadnaught that's been balanced with some caramel malts and had the hop regimen dialed down a few notches. Not so Irish Red, but hey. It's delicious - can't knock it too much for that :)"
"Overall- A very nice take on the normally mundane Irish Red Ale. A bit out of the norm, but a bit better than the vast majority of the beers of the style. You could drink a boat load of this if you chose to! Slainte & Pouge Mahone!"
"O: Good seasonal beer. Wouldn't be my bread and butter, but come St. Paddys day reach for this one if you get sick of the Guinness and Harp. Spend some time to learn about the History of the Ard Ri's, you'll appreciate this beers name sake."
"This is Gumballheads big redheaded brother. Big on the roasted malt and well balanced with 3 Floyd's heavy hop hands. Smells of Creme Brulee with Citrus Essence. Nice average head. This is how one should celebrate St. Pattys day! Cant wait till next spring!!"
"O: Finally a good Red Ale that has flavor. Typical hop characteristic of Three Floyds."
"Overall, this brew is a great one and should be bottled in six packs and sold year-round."
"Overall this is a solid red ale but doesn't beat out my favorite the panama red limited. This guy though does come in a close second, and it is a ridiculously good beer to drink when paired with a nice steak."
"Note: This got an A-, but it could have easily been a B+. It was on the boarderline between B+ and A- for me."
"D- Yes. I can and do drink this when given the opportunity. The taste profile lends itself to easy drinking and the abv concludes the ease of drink. Simply put, Three Floyds has made a nice American Irish Red."
"D: My only complaint is that it can get a bit cloying, but really it's basically perfect."
"Thanks to funkyaudio and hurfer for the bombers - just in time for St. Patty's week! Poured from bomber into a dimpled mug. Pours a clear, deep ruby color with a thick off-white beige head. Retains very nice lacing throughout the drinking session. Beautiful! Nose picks up pine-y hops, citrus, caramel malts, biscuit, buttered toast, toffee, some pineapple, and resin. Flavor of pine-y hops, honey, resin, grapefruit and orange citrus, toast, herbal notes, and definitely a nice share of caramel malts. Light-medium bodied, with average carbonation throughout and a dry, bitter finish in a very good way. Crisp, refreshing, and extremely well-balanced for the style. Perfect amount of hops and bitterness. This brew has become my favorite for the Irish Red Ale style. I'm actually surprised to see this at under 6% ABV, so it's definitely sessionable!"
"Imagine that - doesn't suck at all, nice malt profile and creamy mouthfeel of pale ale, without same level of bitternesss. A bit sweet, but not too much with a slighly astringent finish where you notice the alcohol, but not too much. ALso leaves a tannin taste similar to tea, which might keep me from drinking more than a couple, but nonetheless a very solid beer."
"Extremely sessionable. Not too high ABV but full of flavor. Readily available by me, however I probably only have 6 weeks to get as much as I can."
"D - good drinking, not too heavy, but a funny aftertaste slows me down a bit."
"This beer is part of my #1 beer per style project, best Irish Red Ale currently on beeradvocate.com, and I agree."
"D-very drinkable. Taste gone in no time"
"Pours an amber reddish with a bit of pure white head. Geat head retention. Smells sweet. Honey forward. Lots of hops. Tastes sweet. Honey and hops. Lots of sweet malts. Caramel and honey... Just a great profile. Solid drinkability. A bit hoppier than i would like but really very nice"
"I suppose it's fairly drinkable, but after so many top notch brews from 3Fs, this is a disappointment. And as far as value, it's not. A chug of this will set you back the same as a 6 pack of a comparably good red from a brewery as far away as the West Coast. And 3Fs is local. Figure that one out. It's not as if their ingredients are triple the price. Hopefully we see more classics coming out from 3Fs in the future...sorry guys, but Brian Boru seems like a half-effort."
"Drinkability -- Very pleasant. Brian Boru is a nice change from the typical hoppy FFF beer; the honey malt sweetness and tropical fruit notes are brushed aside, leaving a dry, resinous Irish Red."
"SLAINTE!"
"Overall-- quite drinkable. A very hoppy take on the style that impresses me. Three Floyds motto is ""it's not normal," and this beer certainly fits in that line of thinking... Sometimes, not being normal is a very good thing!"
"Bottle poured into Black Raven pint glass. Reddish orange body with a small off white head that fades quickly to a collar with some nice lacing. Smell is very hop forward for the style but great regardless - tons of amarillo, soft ripe fruits, peaches, slightly dank. Taste is much more subdued but still hoppy. Slightly malty, bready, green hops, apricots, slightly bitter finish. Medium to light bodied with a medium carbonation. Not the best example of the style but I really like it. Balanced toasted malt and bitterness with a little extra hop aroma, very drinkable."
"D: Much to my surprise this is very good! Didn't think I would be too crazy for the Irish Red brew but I will be picking up a couple more of these bombers!"
"Thick beer going down, drinkable enough. Might buy again."
"A fellow BA and friend suggested to stop by Jungle Jims in Cincinnati. I'm glad I did as I picked up FFF's Brian Boru, among other taste brews. BB pours a cloudy dark amber to red color with good head retention and laciness. The aroma is hoppier then traditional reds, but still has that malt blend. Other traces of citrus and some piney scent are noticeable as well. The taste is good but maybe too hoppie for traditional styles. But I'm a hop head so its all good. The taste is not as hop dominate as the smell would indicate. Very well balanced. A good flavor malt with a mix of base and sweeter malts (maybe lighter crystal) and a slight caramel flavor. Almost reminds me of an American Barelywnie toned down. A definite hop citrus is present but doesn't overpower or lingering. Very easy to drink and a great flavor to boot. I think it's ironic that I picked up a great tasting ""Red"" Ale that has the same home as the Cincinnati ""Reds."""
"This beer, brewed and bottled in the spring, might be a bit past its prime. But it's now or never so let's give this a try. Poured into a duvel tulip, my favorite beer glass, I get a mahogany colored brew with the slightest of heads. I don't get a hop kick in the smell but that's understandable for its age. What I do get is a red ale with lots of caramelly smoothness and a subdued hoppiness that really plays out in the taste. Great mouthful and drinkability. Will definitely pick this up fresh in the spring."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Awesome example of the style with a FFF take."
"D. Drinks like an imperial and frankly I'm digging it in this beer."
"The flavor follows the nose quite closely. Lots of sweet and sticky caramel and toffee work well with the orange, grapefruit, and pineapple. This beer is big but not overwhelming, well balanced but not bland. Full bodied and well carbonated, somewhat chewy, and finishes slightly dry. Overall this is a beautiful beer. This is a refreshing hoppy take on a somewhat overlooked traditional style"
"Drinkability isn't bad, with some very light syrupy flavors on the finish, a nice bitterness that comes on in the finish but nothing heavy. Low abv and the nice combined flavors bring a decent drinkability."
"D. I had a lot of this at a FFF tasting recently where it paired quite well with some spicy Jamaican chicken - the sweet malt helped offset the spiciness while the brisk carbonation helped keep the oils from sitting too long on your tongue. This is a good beer that can be phenomenal with the right food."
"You might love this hoppy Irish Red. For me, it misses the point. I'm all about experimenting with established styles but this beer seems more counterintuitive than anything. There's a decent, interesting beer here with unrealized potential to be something more."
"Wow, wow, wow, I just drank this one tonight and I am so impressed by this beer... I nearly gave it 5 stars across the board! The only thing I can say about this beer that isn't positive is the beer is just hard to drink by yourself... you just want to keep having everyone take a taste of how magnificent this beer is! I loved this Irish Red, I usually get me a Smithwicks when I go out and eat but damn it do I wish they would have this on tap when I went out to eat... everywhere I go out to eat!"
"D: Fairly low abv so it goes down easy. Definitely very drinkable and an enjoyable Spring-time option. Also, the flavors come together much more smoothly from on-tap then from the bottle."
"I just pick up hops on the nose and not much else though. When cold, there is a nice balance in this beer. As it warms up, the malt fades and leaves mostly hops in my mouth. A amber reddish color that is not overly impressive. Gives a decent head on pour."
"mild carbonation and very drinkable ."
"D- Goes down reasonably well. I wouldn't turn away from another bottle..."
"In the past the Irish ales I've tried has a tart taste to them. Brian Boru is different in regard of the taste profile. A bit too sweet to my liking."
"DR- Split the bomber with my wife. Wouldn't be able to finish it by myself as it too sweet for my liking. I'm not too big on Reds so I don't hold it against it."
"The first sip is hard to get anything but malt. The sweetness carries the hop across. Somewhat bitter with a smooth medium carbed body. Pretty delicious. I would drink it more often if it were available."
"Drinkability is quite good, though not spectacular considering the abv and style. Certainly not much effort to finish a whole bomber on one's own. A nice beer for a rainy summer day, very pleasant."
"Overall, a very interesting take on the style and I enjoyed the blend of flavors quite a bit. Give it a try if you get the chance and look for a fresh bottle so you get the unique hops."
"This is, by far, the best Irish Red I have ever had."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit of a smooth creamy feel to it. After reading the label I'm guessing that is from the Irish oats. Drinkability is very good, it was a very good and interesting beer. I liked their take on the style with a higher amount of hops and the addition of Irish oats. probably one of my favorites of this style overall."
"D- Goes down easy. I like this beer. It really draws attention to a style that I usually find to be mediocre. The alcohol is none existent. Its nearly sessionable. This bomber will be no problem for me."
"Tasted from a 22 ounce bottle. Pours amber with a thin white laced head. The aromas are of grapefruit hoppiness, pineapple, and caramel malts. The taste is actually mild for what I was expecting from the smell. The caramel malts come through with a toasted toffee character. The hops are there, but seem to fade quickly with just a hint of the grapefruit flavor. There is a doughy yeast characteristic as well. The palate is almost creamy, and very lasting with average carbonation. The caramel flavor lasts for a while on the aftertaste. Overall, this is a very easy beer to drink. Not terribly complex, but very well integrated and solid overall."
"D - Nice, but would tire pretty soon."
"Nicely done for an Irish red by an American brewery."
"Very good beer."
"D: Really enjoyed this hoppy irish red. I personally haven't had anything like it in the style so I would venture to call it my favorite irish red. Extremely drinkable. I could drink a 6-pack of this (if they made one) relatively easily. Another solid Three-Floyds beer. I enjoyed the original take on an old style. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"Very drinkable brew. Given my limited knowledge of beer styles, not sure if this is truly an Irish Red, but I like it anyway."
"At 5.9%, this one is incredibly drinkable. It's light on the palate, and relatively well-balanced. The hops stick around, like with most hoppy beers, and dominate the palate...but I like it...and I love this take on a style that doesn't get much revisiting. Make this one into a six-pack, please!"
"D- Quite interesting to have this very hoppy Irish Red Ale. As much as this brew is pretty much blasphemy to a traditional representation of the style- drinkable, irish red filled with smooth and creamy caramel malt; I still really enjoyed this beer although I am pretty hesitant to call it an Irish Red. Another well done, but strange brew from FFF."
"Drinkability? The taste and relatively low abv makes this a very good quaffer indeed so I'm super pleased to have had 22oz at my ""command"". A delicious Irish Red Ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly sweet, chewy, with spritzy carbonation leading to a smooth finish."
"Drinkability: If I could get Brian Boru in a six pack I would. This is very sessionable and would be nice to sip on as the night passes me by."
"Maybe a better descriptor of this beer is an IPA-strength Amber Ale but with the amber-ness of an Irish Red rather than an American Amber... yea, that makes no sense. Maybe just drinking this wonderful beer is enough."
"Too expensive to be a ""session"" beer but this would definitely qualify if sold in 6packs. Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable..."
"I don't drink Irish Reds too often but this is very enjoyable and very drinkable."
"Overall, the best Irish Red I've ever had to date.. Its a real pleasure to drink and could easily session this one..."
"Hop heads should have no trouble putting away maybe ten of these because Brian Boru is one drinkable beast."
"The taste was unique, as the initial hit was the usual malty, sweet flavor that most Irish reds have, but it added a solid amount of hops that made for a crisp finish. It was a nice surprise and very drinkable."
"Great session beer here."
"pours a dark copper with highlights of ruby red. 4 finger off white head with ok lace. the smell is sweet and piney with aromas of fresh, resiny citrus hops and a hint of malt. strong and sexy, just like you'd expect from a FFF. the taste is lighter. biscuity bread, caramel, and grapefruit. mouthfeel is sticky. the finish is pleasing, long, and bitter. another winner out of Munster, IN. i could drink about 45 of these. by far the best irish red ale i've ever drank."
"The Irish Red Ale is a style that did not predispose me to expect much, and I was pleasantly surprised at what big beer 3 Floyd's pulled off here. Lots of malt, as one would expect, but a very flavorful hops character, as well. Bittering might push this beer out of the style parameters, but someone has to push the envelope every once in a while. Seemed much bigger than the abv would suggest."
"D - Easy to pound these back all day with the low abv and great taste."
"Drinkability: Was a good beer. I pick it up again next year when it comes out again. It kinda reminded me of Alpha King."
"This has to be the best red ale made if not the only good red ale."
"Overall, I don't really think of this as a typical Irish red, which maybe made me like it a lot. It just seemed like a red ipa. Whatever, I liked it no matter what you call it. Good little beer here."
"Mostly fantastic all arond, and quite possibly the finest Irish Red I have ever tasted. Crisp, bitter, peaty, and mostly refreshing. High marks."
"Overall, this beer is tasty but not what I remembered/expected. I still like it but am slightly disappointed with the forwardness of the hops. While it is not a straight up Irish Red, I'd still recommend it as a good beer if you find it near you."
"The great hop/malt balance combined with the smooth body makes this very easy to drink."
"Overall rather drinkable, but this is way more hoppy than I remember it. Aroma and smell have an intense raw hop-cone presentation, which is great, but quite intense for the style. Overall, I really enjoy this beer, and would probably keep it regularly on-hand if it was brewed year-round."
"D: Solid offering from Three Floyds which seems silly to say as they pretty put out something good each go around. This is a beer that needs to be drank fresh though to get the full effect. Interesting take on the style but malty enough to fit in to the guidelines well enough."
"Got this on tap at 3Fs. Nice reddish amber color w/ an off-white head. Good lacing. Smell is much hoppier than a typical red. Taste is also. Nice citrus bite, biscuity malt character in the finish. Wonderful oakey aftertaste. Slick, medium bodied mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Nice!"
"Overall, this is a good beer in each aspect but not too much of any one. This makes it easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"D: Great looking brew with a nose that I find likable, just when it hits the tongue it's a different story. I'll be weary of the Amarillo/Honey forward beers from 3F from now on."
"(D)- An interesting irish red made interesting with 3 Floyds behind the wheel. Good citrus-like hops and honey. An enjoyable beer despite its bottle age. I am sure this would only be better fresh!"
"D - My latest tasting of a Three Floyds beer makes me crave their other beers that much more, this is truly a great beer"
"D- I was blown away with this beer. I didn't really expect anything as flavorful as this beer. Irish Red Ales are not a favorite style for me but FFF did a good job of making this style more interesting."
"Again, the venerable Philip comes through with hard to find stuff, and is as generous as can be. Thank you! Three Floyds Brian Boru pours deep copper/crimson and is generously capped with scads of beige froth. Good lacing is immediate, and stays the course. There's lotas of hops in the aroma, which is both strange but suprisingly welcome for a beer in this style. Fruity aromas take second place, and win the silver medal. Third place goes to caramel and burnt malts. But hops win the oscar. Sweet fruit and bold hops are the main flavour contenders, and suragy malt, burnt molasses have decided to tag along. Boru finishes sweet with good length of bitterness and ripe citrus. I'd drink Irish Ales all day log if this was the archetype. Really very well done. Again Philip, you have my thanks. Great!"
"D - Very drinkable. This is really incredible for a style that is not typically very exciting. FFF almost always impresses, and this is no exception."
"D= Awesome. Again this is a true pure red ale. Great example of the style an one of the most balanced beers I have ever tasted. Awesome job again by Three Floyds."
"Very nice beer, although I'm always a touch let down when the beer peaks with the smell. This one smells great, & tastes good...but if FFF can get the taste in line with the smell, they'd have a top-shelf Irish Red here. But I'll take it as brewed, too."
"Another fantastic beer from the boys at FFF. I've yet to find anything from these guys that I don't love."
"Overall, a very good representation of a not-so-mainstream style. I'm impressed with this beer, until I remember it's brewed by Three Floyds, at which point I write it off and realize I should have been expecting that to begin with."
"This one pours a dark blood red with a slight head, and this after I practically dumped it in the glass. Smell is a very mild aroma of malt. Tastes mildly of malt, caramel, and the taste improves substantially as it warms up, but it's still pretty mild for this style. Carbonation is just about right, and it's pretty drinkable, but unremarkable for a 3F beer."
"Drinkability: Considerably high. This beer isn't for everybody though, as it is so sweet and malty. I enjoy the difference between this and most highly-hopped 3 Flioyds offerings (which I also adore)."
"D: Very, very drinkable. Irish Red is not by any means my favorite style, but this was one of my favorite beers of Spring '09."
"I thought this was a good beer. This is a style that I typically avoid. The citrus really gave this one a nice spark."
"Drinkability: The two things that hurt this beer is the availability and the price. Maybe not the price at the right location, but certainly the availability. It's one of those beers that you have to know somebody that knows somebody that know someone that lives in the area of 3 Floyds distribution. Other than that, this was by far the best Irish Red that I've ever had."
"Medium bodied, it improves as it warms. A strong malty backbone, caramel and bread, opens its way to a nice hoppy bite that adds to the usual irish red flavors. Citric and fruity notes round it up; a major improvement over the usual boring red ale; another great offering from the best brewery ever (IMHO)."
"I have to admit, I didn't expect much out of Brian Boru. An Irish hero? Fine, I'll buy it. But an heroic Irish red ale? I suspected I would have trouble swallowing that! I stand corrected...Boru was quite good. Poured a nice, reddish brown. Adequate head, generous when warmer; but quickly fades to just a skin of foam across the top. Aroma and taste reminded me of a light Robert the Bruce (hundreds of Irishmen, green and orange, simultaneously rolling over in their graves). Medium body, not oily. Above average drinkability. No appreciable difference cold or warmed."
"This drinks a lot heavier than a 5.9% abv, but does taste good and I enjoyed trying it."
"pours a copper red brown color with a 1/2 inch head that settles down slowly to some nice lacing..the smell is malt,caramel toffe that really permeates the nose a slight hop/spice smell in the background..the taste is a toffee and malt explosion to the senses followed by some nice bitter hops that balances out to a smooth irish red the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and quite drinkable kind of tastes like a scoth ale mixed with a strong amber its a style i dont drink to often ...3fff always makes great representations of styles that are delicious ..this one falls into that category for sure..recommended"
"MF is right in the middle I'd say and the carbonation is almost non-existent, but still makes for a pretty good finish. I's stick with about one of these this beer is not that drinkable to me because it's not that refreshing , but regardless the taste is there."
"An active and bubbly head slowly turns into a thick and fine pure tan froth and leaves a tall, sticky lacing behind. Color is a rusty red. At the nose, citrus hops are about all I can discern. Possibly some tea and caramel malts underneath. Lack of a big profile here does is not necessarily a bad thing, as it's subtly is pleasant. On the palate a good amount of sweetness mixes with some nuanced hops and faint tea notes. An undercurrent of citrus works itself into the equation after a bit. The light to medium body works well here, as it's not fleeting going down, but gives you something to think about, and has just enough weight to keep it from being a full on summer session brew. Apparently, the Irish Red is a hard style to conquer, and it seems nobody has really made a truly great one, but FFF has come the closest as far as I can tell. Then again, it just might be that the style is not quite in favor right now, but this one hits the spot for me either way."
"D - The low ABV and mild carbonation make it easily drinkable, but I'm just not into the taste all that much. I have no idea how this compares to other Irish Reds, but I'm assuming it isn't all that representative of the style (being a Three Floyds brew). Still, if this was among the better options on-tap somewhere I'd have no problems having a pint."
"Bomber poured into pint glass. Smell is fresh piney and hoppy. Taste is mostly caramel.. slight hops and light tomato. I haven't had too many of this style other than the few mainstream macro ones, but this was a pretty decent drinkable beer. Not too out of the ordinary or exciting, but definitely seemed to fit the style well."
"D - Exceptionally flavorful and easy to drink due to the well-concealed alcohol presence, Brian Boru may very well be the best Irish Red Ale I've ever had. It's another example of FFF pushing the envelope of what can be done with a relatively dull style."
"Excellent stuff, one you don't hear of too much from FFF."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Low abv. and great taste."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle split with psycohops and brothercannon. Appears a murky dark amber color with about two fingers of fluffy creamy ecru foam. Head retention is excellent and it leaves a sticky lace on the inside of my glass with each sip. The nose consists of sweet grains, toffee, citrus hop notes (orange), fragrant and grassy. Tastes of caramelized malts and grains, orange peel, candied lemon, toffee, more caramel. This red ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation for the style. This beer has a lot going on across the board considering the relatively low ABV. Great stuff! Check it out if you have the opportunity."
"D- A fairly hearty beer for the ABV. This is probably my favorite take of the Irish red. Enjoyable and definitely worth a try."
"Overall, a good beer, but nothing special."
"I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Very drinkable and it really blossomed as it started to warm up."
"To be fair, I am not sure I am a huge fan of the style, which is not the fault of the beer. That being said, overall I am underwhelmed in general, and especially given the price."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Red in color and a small amount of white head. Smell is hops/floral/citrus. Taste of hops, citrus, and malt. Mouthfeel is light bodied and fresh/crisp. Easy to drink brew but too many others I prefer over this one."
"Overall, a solid brew. If you like IPAs but want something lower in alcohol and lighter then this is the beer for you."
"D- Very easy to drink. Average abv and smoothness make this one go down the hatch easily. Nice."
"Overall, this is a very mediocre beer. Nothing groundbreaking."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Mediul bodied crisp and creamy. Very good."
"good beer, glad i bought a few of these and the price was lower than most FFF bombers. low ABV made this easy to drink, could have easily popped open another."
"Poured from a 22oz, poured a rusty orange color with a foamy white head with good retention. Aromas were of sweet toffee and caramel with some unexpected hops. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and flowed nicely around the palate. Flavors were great up-front malts, mainly caramel and toffee notes, but the balance from the presence of the hops gave it a nice finish. One of the better Irish Red Ales I've had."
"D: totally easy to drink with good flavor profile."
"D: This is a better example of a Red Ale than most that I've tried. Can definitely drink a bunch of these."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and crisp, but slightly oily."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a dark reddish amber with a big rocky white head that left little lacing as it crept down the glass. The aroma is big malt up front with a good amount of orangey citrus and just a bit of pineapple. The flavor is much of what you would assume a red ale is supposed to be. Malty up front but still very balanced. Sweet, but not overly so. There is a bit of orange hops, but they are much milder on the palate then they are in the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit full with a tickling amount of carbonation. It's really nice to see Three Floyds doing a toned down beer. I wish this would be a start for a whole line of small beers."
"Pours a nice hazy amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is big on malts, getting some cherries, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, cherries/caramel. Medium body, the finish is dry. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew."
"Good, quality stuff. As mentioned, lots of underlying flavors present."
"Drinkability: Probably the best Irish Red I've ever had. Another winner from a top five brewery, as far as I'm concerned, and 5.9% is plenty to sneeze at. Though it's not my favorite style - the malt complexities just aren't my thing - it's nonetheless a really tasty beer, and one that I would be more than happy to have again. Recommended."
"It is malty, with a definate house character (that happens to be a nice one). A bit too much on the pineapple for me, though the maltiness has a nice taste - just overpowered by house taste and a bit too much hops for the style. A different, unique, spin on the style."
"Drinkability - Three Floyds has turned a normally dull style into an enormously flavorful beer. I didn't think you could pack this much taste and flavor into a red ale, but Three Floyds really shows what they're made of here. Dynamite in a bottle!"
"Pours a deep brownish red with a cloudy look. There is light tan bubbly foam around the rim of the glass. The nose is of earthy hop scents and caramel malts. A slight breadiness as well. The taste is definitely some earthy hop with a stern malt backbone. The caramel malt and bitter earthy hops are well balanced. I can taste some nice breadiness too. Maybe a slight alcohol tinge? Mouthfeel is pretty low to medium carbonation with a somewhat slick feel down the throat. Overall this is a good irish red. It's solid but not outstanding. I wouldn't pay top dollar for this so, it's a tad overhyped/overpriced but pretty solid."
"Pours a wonderfully dark red color with a bright white foam- great carbonation, not over the top. Smells of caramel malts, that grassy three floyds hop aroma, and a bit of fuit maybe? Tastes a lot of caramel malts and once again, the characteristic three floyd's hop flavor. However, it's not very complex (although I don't expect it to be). That earthy, wet grass hops flavor doesn't much suit the malt backbone of the beer either. Mouthfeel is good, what I want from an Irish Red. In the end, while I could drink this beer for a while, I'm not impressed enough to want to. However, I'm still glad I got to try it, being that I can't get it where I live."
"This has been my least favorite offering from Three Floyds but its still a great beer."
"Thanks to Tattorso for this awesome sympathy beer."
"This was pretty damn good for an Irish Red. I have a feeling it's probably hard to find one in the style that is tastier than this, but at the same time it's not exactly true to style, as I'm sure FFF likes it."
"This beer pours a brownish-red with a small, oily white head. Aroma is of sweet malt, rosewood, sugar, maple, vanilla, and oak. Very deep and complex for an Irish Red. Flavor is much the same with pinches of nuttiness and a barely noticeable hop taste. Caramel and sugar cane emerge later as it finishes. Considering how simple I have seen some other Irish Reds, this beer is a symphony."
"drinkability - I was tinking this beer was going to offer more, but not much going on here. Easy drinking beer, but I hoped it would of been on the sweet side."
"D- Highly drinkable and recommended. Well done."
"Pours a deep red and a greyish head. Aroma is moderately sweet, grapefruit, some pineapple, caramel, light tangerine., biscuity Malts with some Amarillo. Flavors of toffee, raisins and oranges. More piney as it warms. Definitely plenty of hops, but not especially bitter. Watery medium body, some resin."
"D - This is a pretty good irish red ale. Very different from most, but still quite good."
"Well call me surprised by this one! The hop profile of this was quite the welcome surprise and held up extrememly well considering that this bottle was at least 6 months old. Probably the best Irish Red I've had to date!"
"Overall I thought this was excellent. Perhaps my favorite that I have ever had in the style. Rich, surprisingly complex and easy to drink I could do no wrong with getting this one all the time. I would definitely seek it out as it really is a great example of the style."
"Drinkability- This beer has a ton of flavor, low abv, and a great mouthfeel, making it a great beer to have quite a few of. I could easily sit down and enjoy a few bombers of these Irish bastards. My first FFF beer and I'm not disappointed. This beer has me extremely excited to try their other two offerings in my fridge."
"A: Pours a hazy orangish brown with a dense cream-colored head that lingers for a while and leaves decent lacing. The aroma has a big bready malt sweetness with a hint of pine hops in the background. The taste is a bigger version of the aroma with the sweet caramel malts dominating throughout. The pine hops kick a little up front and come back to leave the slightest bitterness in the finish. The spices and a little orange come across as well leaving a bit of a tea taste on the palate. The mouthfeel is creamy but with strong carbonation that leaves the tongue tingling through the finish. This is a very, very good Irish red, possibly the best I've had. Highly recommended."
"D: A great big interpretation of style and definitely worthy of a re-visit. You wont be disappointed here."
"D: Great example of a dry Irish stout. A nice refreshing version of a non hoppy red."
"D- very easy to drink, im glad i picked up this lonely bottle in the liquor store. ill have this one again if i get the chance."
"D: Hooray! A bomber for me!"
"Prosit MK"
"D - A really drinkable beer to me. I would recommend this to those who enjoy Hop head red, Nugget nectar, but expect more malt subtlety. This is not mindblowing or hopped to the point your tongue feels coated, but is just well made and ease to quaff. I would say this is not dull in the least, rather it is a very easy drinking red without the Irish character. This has the 3F's stamp all over it and is just what you would expect them to produce for the style. A lot of American hops and this seems juicy w/ easy Summer quaffability. This went very well w/ my aged Irish cheese which gave a contrasting sharpness to the gentle sweetnes of this balance red"
"D - Very nice beer. The whole bomber went down very easily. But I'd buy Red Rocket five times for everytime I picked this one up."
"D: Perfect. I'm proud to live in a state where this is made."
"low malt complexity, not bad but let down for a beer thats spossed to be a little more complex, really let down because the major flavor is a dry hopped wetness"
"D: Super sessionable. By far the best Irish Red I have ever had. While not the most exiting style three floyds made this one interesting."
"M/D - The sweet malt clings to the roof of your mouth and leaves a pleasant taste. Smooth, low carbonation, and extremely drinkable."
"Thanks to younger35 for the hookup!"
"Notes: This one was a big surprise. Absolutely the best Irish red ale I've had."
"D - Well balanced and not too sweet like some red ales. Alcohol is not much of a factor. Would be nice to see this beer in 6 packs perhaps instead of bombers. Worth picking one up, especially if you like the style."
"ahatcher78 is a hell of a BA and I thank him for this Powerball gift!"
"D- Decent. It is a little too malty for me to session."
"Pours a murky wet red with a one finger khaki colored head that dies down to a creamy layer. Very nice webbing sticks to the sides. Smell up front consists of spice, leather, and pine. A good amount of toffee and caramel malts in the nose as well. Some citrus is hidden underneath all that malt too, nicely done. Metallic on the tongue to begin with, followed by gritty earth hops and a load of sweet caramel malt. A peppery spice is noticable all the way through, but not doesn't overpower. Toffee and roasted malts in the aftertaste, pretty solid in the flavor department. Medium body with a somewhat abrasive feel to it and a full carbonation. A style that seems to be overlooked, I'd like to see more American breweries attempt this style. Good one from FFF, give it a shot."
"The perfect beer to have with lunch. Tasty, yet not overdone. Great job."
"Overall a great beer that is definitely worth seeking out especially if this is a style that you're really into."
"D- A very tastey, well balanced beer. Great for a session."
"HV"
"Overall: If I drank this blindly, I would think of it as a red stout. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer, complex and very easily drinkable."
"Wow does three floyds make a bad beer.Deep carmel color With a nice off white head that leaves quickly.It taste of carmel and toffee with a very light hop touch.It leaves the mouth dry but i guess that is to be expected with this type of beer.I would say that this is a session beer"
"Drinks very easy, a solid Irish Red, that is pretty true to it's roots. I could session on this, but would rather move on to the Dark Lord..."
"This is a typical irish ale with a hint of hops but the caramel and spices really come across here. There's a malt-sweetness that reminds me of caramel and some kind of fruit. This is very balanced. Nice session beer."
"Worth a try but not great."
"D- Nice easy drink brew. The cask makes it even easier to drink."
"Pours a great dark red/burnished copper color with a nice thin head, although there was very little lacing. Great scent, a nice tart aroma with hints of cinnamon and citrus, and a great malty kick. Excellent taste, as well, a nice tart and sour Irish red, a great malty flavor, with a slight bit of citrus, and a nice slightly hoppy finish. Goes down great, one of my favorite Irish red style beers."
"I know this bottle is fresh(maybe not extremely) since it was bought at the brewery. Hops are much more present in the nose. Light citrus and some pepper. Also, much stronger in the taste as well. The tea is still strong but seems liikes it's mroe in place this time. Overall, a more enjoyable brew."
"Big thanks to Beervirgin72 and Kryptic for bottles! Pours a rich, hazy maroon color with a nice head. Smell was very tea like. Hibiscus and floral in particular with no real hops noticeable. Flavor was pretty balanced, not sweet or hoppy but flavorful with tea flavors again. As far as FFF goes, not remarkable, but for the style, about as good as it gets, I'd say. Enjoyable, easy drinker."
"Thanks go out to kmpitz2 for the opportunity."
"Another great one from FFF. This one ranks up with Lagunitas Imperial Red, and Great Lakes Nosferatu, for top honors in the red category."
"I'd drink this frequently if only it was available in my area. Another solid offering from Three Floyd's."
"D - Overall, another great FFF beer that is super easy to drink. Found the fruit flavors to be a bit of a surprise that I would not have guessed to find in this one. The caramel malt and smokiness really do dominate this one and almost make it seem like a meal in itself. It would be good to session but it is a bit thick for that."
"D - Very good. Hops could become overpowering with too many in a sitting, but they aren't so harsh as to cause you to make a face. Very tasty drinking."
"This is very well balanced, packed with flavors, and smooth. As much as anything, I'm thrilled that I had the rare foresight to grab a second. Outstanding, and highly recommended."
"Drinkability is high, a very tasty brew."
"Medium bodied, crisp and clean. A nice drinker. Hop bitterness is kind of sneaky in the end. All in all, a pleasant beer."
"Drinkability: This is a very tasty beer with good complexity. It is not too heavy and therefore the drinking is very easy. One of the best Irish Reds I've tried. Highly recommended."
"D - Good beer. I like it a lot. It's a lot creamier than I expected."
"Drinkability- Everyone knows Three Floyds makes big hoppy beers. This definitely takes the Irish Red category to the limit hop wise, but for the good. Its really well balanced and ridiculously tasty. Great beer I highly recommend!"
"Pours a deep clouded ruby with a light tan head. Nose is caramel and sweet. Flavor is slightly sweet with a leafy caramel character. At first I felt the flavor was dropping off too fast, but then I realized it was just too cold. As it warmed, the flavors became smoother and stayed longer. There's also a nice hearty aftertaste you get as well. Good carbonation and thick and nice on the liquid. Definitely drinkable and a good one to try."
"Appears a deep caramel copper body, with a light tan beige head dwindles slowly I'm salivating just thinking about this one. Hop aroma flowing strong with no one else in mind. Herbal alcoholic flow again on I can't believe it let's do some more damage to our brain cells. What a great flow of aged hop aromas that come our way flowing oh so nicely. Flavors flow well so easily the malts blend nicely with the hops I'm burping up the combo of the two. Flavors contain caramelized biscuit malts with strong herbal slightly piney hop flavors really goes well together. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is sturdy but no overplayed flows really easily. Drinkability twenty two ounces is effortless enjoy this one and raise your glass to Brian Boru I'm about to Google his ass sounds pretty badass."
"D: Outstanding. This is a beer that exhibits incredible balance, great mouthfeel, and an overall immaculate beer. The versatility of this one is off the charts; I honestly don't think there's any time that I wouldn't want to crack one of these."
"drinkability is good. light and drinkable, i'd just enjoy it with a touch more body."
"Overall, A very good red ale. It is what I would expect from the Floyds. The only issue is that it is a bit on the high end of the price scale for an Irish red. You get what you pay for in the end."
"Deep amber color with some golden hues around the edges of the glass. Nice white head with good retention. Aroma is sweet caramel and spicy and citrusy hops wtih some black pepper notes, and a bit of alcohol as it warms. Taste starts off pretty promising with a nice citrus pressence to start but it seems to be lacking some malt character towards the back end. It just seems to fade off the palate leaving a spicy hop finish. There is a little malt present but there should be more in my opinion. Mouthfeel is medium. Not a bad beer, but a little overrated in my opinion, especially at over six bucks for the bomber."
"Poured into a nonic. Poured a nice head that sat for a while, then fell leaving a thick lace white lace. Aroma is of malt, some yeast and some (less than expected) hop. The hop aroma is of typical FFF hops. ""C" The taste was thick and of malt, lacking the carbonation I was looking for. Typical red with more hops. The mouthfeel was a bit thick, but drinkable. Very sessionable. Too bad it wasn't on tap."
"Bomber courtesy of Viggo. Big thanks for this tasty treat! Pours out a cloudy redish orange with very good head retention. The nose is sweet malt and hops. Taste- really citrus hop forward initally and then the rich matls kick in. Tons of caramel in this one. Drinkability is very high- great blend of juicy hops and thick malt. One of the better FFF brews Ive had the chance to try."
"Drinkability: Certainly capable of going through one of these 22oz bottles. This is a worthy beer that should be shared and consumed a lot. I wish they distributed to PA more. Quenching."
"Impressive little know brew, cant believe it got down here in S.W. Illinois under the radar. A red ale you should not miss."
"D: A very likable beer, rich and flavorful. Lovely aroma...easy to drink at under 6% and one I had no trouble finishing. One I'd like to have again - thanks Kathryn."
"A nice beer from top to bottom. This one would go great with a roasted whole chicken. One of the few where the sum of the parts makes a greater overall whole. Definitely worth the try."
"Nice, round beer. A hefty feeling red, even though the ABV isn't particularly big. I bought a couple bottles just a week ago. First ime I'd seen the stuff. Hope I see it again."
"An interesting beer. I love reds and this is a great example, although the balance does seem to lean very heavily towards the hops. Very three floyds."
"Overall a very tasty and easy drinking red ale. Nice malt subtleties and an attractive ABV."
"Update: had it every year since. Nice clarity. Big amarillo nose when fresh. Big and luscious mouthfeel for this abv. As good or better than alpha king? This is more like a killer rich caramelly apa or ipa than an irish red..."
"Poured a hazy, reddish-brown with a thick, rocky head that lasts. Smell is moderately hoppy and somewhat balanced by a mild, underlying malt aroma. Taste is very malty and much less hoppy than I would have expected from a beer by Three Floyds. Mouthfeel is good with a dry, crisp finish. This brew is definitely well carbonated. Drinkability is above average. Personally, this isn't one of my favorite styles, but it's good nonetheless. I just expected a little more hop flavor than the beer provided."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Pour is a deep red amber with a tiny tan head. Light lacing. Aroma is that familiar FFF hop profile with notes of caramel and grapefruit. Flavor is a big citrusy, caramel followed by a mellow hint of hop and pine. Very mellow and well balanced. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Smooth with a quick bitter kick at the finish. A real winner."
"It's called Irish Red style by 3 Floyds, but this is really an exceptional Amber American Ale."
"Pours a cloudy red/brown, rusty looking, thick tan head, settles down to a thin layer, nice lacing. Smell is caramel and grapefruit, super malty with 3F hop twist, lots of pine, pineapple, more malt, nice balance. Taste is very malty as well, thick toffee and a bit of roast, chocolate, some floral, pine, very rich, long finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, smooth drink, tons of flavour. I really liked!"
"D- I think it is really good. Nice balance of all the flavors and the best Irish red I have had."
"D: A well crafted red ale. Complex for the style and the selection of hops gives this beer a different angle. Recommended."
"Split a 22 oz bomber of this with a good friend. Pours a very slightly hazy reddish-brown. Small white head, pretty good retention on it. Love the smells right away... hoppier than expected, a touch piny; dark, sweet fruit; toasty grains; touch of caramel. Tastes are nice and complex - they travel well. Small, hoppy beginning that blossoms into a rich, grainy middle, then ends with a piny, spikey hopped finish. Good aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel - highly drinkable beer. Overall, a fine example of the style. One of my favorite Irish Reds. Would gladly reach for one of these again."
"D: Image a well balanced pale ale with a dose of crystal malt for color and sweetness fermented by a yeast with a dry, slightly fruity profile. I enjoyed this beer and the legend on the bottle immensely. The guys at 3 Floyds are giving all of us from Munster something to be proud of."
"On tap at Cole's.poured from the tap a deep bronze with a thinner but well sustained slight off white head,mixed aromas of sweet caramel and spicey/leafy hop made it very appetizing.A big lightly sweet toffee presence really showed itself along with a hint of caramel melding into a big spicey hop finish with notes of of leafy mint lingering.A solid and somewaht complex red ale a good combination of malt and hops,another winner from FFF."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink."
"Three Floyds does some amazing things with hops. The get big juicy fruit flavor from hops that I haven't expierenced from other breweries. Another winner from them. This would be a good one to be able to buy by the 6-pack."
"Deep ruby body topped by a bright, creamy head. Head retention is good, as is lacing. Aroma is sweet malt with hints of fruit and herbal hops. Flavor has some malt initially, but a strong woodiness enters which is then followed by an ashy bitterness on the finish. A soapy hop note continues to build as I consume the glass. Mouthfeel is thin enough to get out of the way, but enough to savor. Drinkability is much better than it should be. I think the hoppiness makes you thirsty so you keep drinking more of it. Whatever the reason, I drank this one quickly, even though I didnt completely enjoy it."
"Thin feeling with a little residual hop oiliness although it does have more moxy than any other Irish red I've tried. Very drinkable and if I were with a Killian's drinker I feel like I could convert them to the world of craft beer in a split second with this brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This one tastes a little watery and leaves almost an oily aftertaste. It's okay. I honestly feel it's a little subpar for Three Floyds. But, maybe I'm just not a big fan of the style. Overall, it's okay. A far cry from some of the other classics we love from this brewery."
"I don't usually pay 7.99 per bottle of beer for something to take home after work but this beer had been intriguing me for some time and I bit the bullet.It poured very dark for a red and had a robust scent with a hearty head that lasted well into the drinking. The drinking was the highlight, I am not a fan of reds as a rule but this has body and flavor with a hoppy feel. I don't see this being a consistent purchase but it was quite good , money spent aside."
"D: Surprisingly vivid hop flavors for such low ibu's. Low abv coupled with interesting flavors and aromas make for a beer that can be enjoyed all day."
"Drinkability: I'm not a big fan of the style but this is a very nice beer; as with Gumballhead, the Floyds have taken an often insipid style and turned it on its head"
"-Oelergud"
"Like every Three Floyds beer I've had so far, amazing..."
"D: Amazingly drinkable, great session beer. I could have easily had a few more. (But I had to save room for the Dreadnaught and the Black Sun...) Man, I love Three Floyds!!"
"Drinkability - Great - I could really drink a lot of this beer. It is very well balanced, has a great interesting aroma, and a nice appearance."
"Drinkability is pretty good but this beer could've been much better. This is a disappointing effort considering Three Floyds lofty standards."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper/red color with a small white head. It smells like citrus hops (grapefruit), some sweet malt and floral hops. It tastes more like floral hops than citrus hops, but I can taste both along with some sweet malt as well. There's a pretty good balance with this beer. The mouthfeel is medium, but a bit watery. Drinkability is good, it goes down smooth. Not my favorite of the FFF beers, but it's still better than most."
"Pours a deep red brown with a thin white head. Nose is sweet hops and some malts. Taste starts out malty, then the hops come in, and there's a nice piney finish. It's like hops grown in a coniferous forest. Pretty good. Mouthfeel is average-ish; it's a pretty drinkable brew."
"I enjoyed the bottle, but wont be sneaking it out again."
"Good-sized head and a beautiful deep-red color. Great hoppy, pineapple, malt aroma. Tasty, with malt and citrus hop flavors accompanied by a bit of alcohol flavor. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. A very drinkable beer that you can certainly enjoy a lot of at only 5.9% ABV. This remains one of my favorite 3F's beers."
"Mouthfeel is pleasant and makes it easily drinkable."
"the style guidleline predicted a tea-ish hoppiness. the only way i can see that is in the near lack of bitterness, at least relative to the other hop characteristics."
"While I had tried this beer at a beer tasting, it seemed a bit different when having the bottle. For starters, it is a good beer but just a bit too heavy for an Irish Red. It borders Scotch Ale in my opinion. Great color, fantastic smell but all in all a bit too heavy to be a nice session Irish Red. However, I read a review that compares it a heavier Red Seal and I totall agree. Has that Red Seal taste. It is a hoppy/malty mix. It's ok but I would not drop $7 a bomber again for it."
"This beer is good, but obviously better when fresh."
"Thanks much to shbobdb for this fine beer!"
"M & D: Watery for a red but easy to drink. Prefer it thicker but i could drink a couple of these, but would need to wash it down with something as it leaves my throat tight."
"Id buy this again, but Not at that price point."
"Cheers!"
"The mouth is light on the front, smooth and bittersweet on the finish, as the hops and sugar both assert themselves, leaving a sticky residue upon the lips. A little sugary on the back to be highly drinkable. Has a solid overall balanced, but seems slighly off balance. Not one of the best from FFF."
"Drinkable when available. A bomber might be a perfect single serving size; but I shared mine with a fellow homebrewer."
"Poured a nice ruby red color with a tan head that disappeared almost as fast as it developed, quite disappointing. Smell was awesome, pineapple and resiny hops greet you, probably not very true to style, but it's smells so good. Taste reminds me of red Kool-Aid for some reason, piney hops kick in to help out and a slightly roasted finish. I just didn't care for the Kool-Aid taste, maybe I'm missing something. Lower carbonation and light to medium bodied. It was a decent beer and loved the smell, but I can't say I'd search this out. This is the first FFF's that I didn't find to be awesome, but then again, maybe I'm missing something. I'll probably try it again to double check."
"The fruitiness was different for the style, but quite enjoyable."
"Tasty brew... Drinkable... Similar to Red Seal Amber on a good day though Red Seal has more PNW type hops and this was a bit more earthy."
"This is a tasty and drinkable beer, but just a little too heavy on the hops for the style. I realize that 3F doesn't really adhere to many style guidelines, which I generally love. But, I was really in the mood for a straight-up Irish Red, and this beer just didn't quite scratch my itch."
"Unique version of the style, and recommended..."
"A very strong Irish red ale with a caramel and fruity base and a robust (for the style) hop presence--perfect, for my personal prefernces. I'm not a hop head per se, though I like the occasional DIPA, but a stronger than average hop presence to balance a strong malty base is my idea of a red ale, and Three Floyd's does a great job with this one. The aroma is light, and doesn't pull up into the nose well, and the head was weak and the rust color became a barely noticable blob in the center of the very, very red-ruby-red beer. If in a well lit bar or a sunny patio, the red color, from a distance, could be mistaken for a summer fruity beer. The the slightly creamy but full body mouthfeel would tell the difference for you immediately. Give this one a shot if you can get it."
"Had this as an after dinner relaxer. Nice red color very much like it should be with a dominate white head that fades slowly. Smell is of caramelized malt with a strong arm of hops grapefruit with spice. The taste enthralls the palate holding it before passing on and giving you a dry finish. Very much a Irish red but strengthed and grown a mustache. Good body and a bomber will do you fine."
"A bit thin for my taste, although the carbonation is just about right. A beer with this much character should be thick in the mouth."
"Mild pine hop profile coupled with a slightly biscuity malt character. Mouthfeel is super smooth, but overall this is simply an adequate beer with nothing exceptional."
"22 oz. bomber with no freshness date. It pours a dark garnet that is clear with medium carbonation and a half inch tan head, and the second pour contributes some sediment. Grapefruit and pineapple hops in the aroma with additional notes of leafy hops, faint tea, and caramel. There is mango and pineapple on the palate with a light to medium bitterness and a firm, toasted malt backbone with hints of tea. It has a medium body that is somewhat dry, and near the end of the first pour it's a bit watery, but the second pour cures that. Overall a good, quite drinkable Irish red that really brings out the hop flavor without getting all the bitterness. I just wish it, like a lot of 3F offerings, were a bit cheaper."
"A solid drinkin' brew. Its cleanness is respectful to its balance as it has a wonderfully crafted oily tone to it that makes for solid enjoyment."
"Drinkability- A nice pleasant brew, good for all occasions."
"Poured a 22oz. bomber. Appearance was a clear copper color with a medium size head. Aroma was malty/sweet with molasses coming to mind. A faint whiff of grass also came through. Taste was primarily sweet (molasses again, blackstrap in particular), with some bitterness from the hops at the end. The flavor was very well balanced. Body was medium and carbonation was quite low, leading to an almost flat mouthfeel. Very smooth, however. This was a drinkable beer, but, to me, quite filling."
"Awesome looking brew. Pours a very brilliant amber, redish color, very clear. A nice one inch thick, cream colored head forms. Fades a little slowly, leaving a ton of delicate lacing. Citrusy hops dominate the smell as with most Three Floyds brews. There is a musty, dusty, malt smell in the background. Very well balanced flavor of citrusy hops and caramel malts. A tad sweet, very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and medium bodied. Drinkability is great, this beer goes down smooth, not filling at all, and leaves you wanting more. Another great beer from Three Floyds."
"drinkability: pretty good, seems to improve a bit as approaches room temperature"
"Drinkability: The ale's strong hop character does not impair the drinkability. I would like to see a bit more malts, but overall I have little to complain about."
"The color was burnt pumpkin with a creamy head. The aroma was mostly hops over a slightly caramel background. The flavor was a little roasty, a littel caramel, and definite hops. I put the mouthfeel at a 3.5 because the body seemed a little thin. But I'd still get it again."
"Drinkability: Yeah, this is extremely delicious, insanely complex, and, well, very expensive, at least as far as I'm concerned. Do you get what you pay for in this instance, though? Yes. Would I buy another one? Yes. A fantastic brew all around."
"Aroma is caramel and grassy and herbal hops. Overall the nose is fairly mild. First sip reveals an average body with gentle rolling carbonation. Flavor starts with some chocolate and caramel thenn rolls to some lite grassy hops that linger and come back with each burp. The beer is smooth an very drinkable, not overly complex or robust, but a solid example of the style IMO. Worth a shot."
"I would like a fresh bottle, this showed signs of aging or mistreatment."
"D: Three Floyds is interesting. They make some of the best beers in the world, but wow are some of their beers mediocre. Not that ambers are usually a stand out style, but I suppose I was hoping for a bit more."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear amber color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of citrus hops is clearly dominant. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt caramel and some overpowering hops. Seems to me this another one of those 3F recipe where they take a traditional style (Pride & Joy, Robert the Bruce) and drop some major hops on top of it. A bit too one-dimensional for my own taste."
"Drinkability: Average abv and low bitterness/mid body beer make it almost slammable."
"Cheers!"
"This is one very easy to drink beer. The beer that proves that Irish ale isn't just a marketing gimmick to sell Killian's red. Tasty ale that will appeal to a regular beer drinker with lots of extra flavor that a real beer fan can love."
"Drinkability is really good. This would be a great brew to enjoy on tap."
"Yet another great beer from the folks at Three Floyds."
"A little to hoppy to be a red in my book, but still a very nice beer."
"I think I can say this is undoubtably the best Irish Red I've had to date.. my Lord, I'll be burping up hops for the rest of the night. Three Floyds, you continue to amaze.."
"D - A hoppy take on the irish red style. I was hoping for a little more from 3F but still a tasty beer."
"A nice copper/brown color, with an off white head, that laces nicely. The aroma is very surprising, I was expecting the malt to be the dominant aroma, it is there, but the distinct aroma of hop spiciness and earthy scents are very apparent. The taste the malt is very strong, then I am left with a question. What happen to the hops? The hops seem to diminish in the taste, they do bring some flavor at the end, but not what I was expecting. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, the only characteristic that the hops leave behind is a dry finish. This is a pretty drinkable beer, though the aroma could scare some off, the taste would be enjoyable to some."
"Drinkability  This one started off looking and smelling good but in the end disappointed."
"on tap @ Track 84 in warwick, R.I., poured clear almond Amber, with a standard tan head, and leaving minimal to minor lacing, bland malty nose. This a pretty tame, malty Red Ale, notes of vanilla and honey picked up amoungst the decent malty crest of this brew.Very minor hop character. Looks like this beer in bottles is quite hoppy....interesting cuz the tap version pint that had, was malt and more malt. Nothing special, but a decent sessioner, if your thing is middle of the road malty brew."
"Pours a deep brownish garnet in color with a thick creamy tan head. Piney aroma with a caramel malt underlying to it. Soft, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Three Floyds hops the shit out of everything, and this is no exception. With an open mind, this is no doubt their take on an Irish Red, albeit untraditional. Piney hoppiness dominates the flavor of this beer. Underneath all the hop bitterness lies a caramel and toasted malt flavor. Gets a touch seltzery. Definitely unique for the style, but off the mark, if you ask me. Hop heads will probably enjoy this quite a bit, but I don't feel this is inline for an Irish Red. I love the label illustration, though."
"This is really a terrific offering from Three Floyds. While it is not spectacularly complex, what Irish Red is? It is very flavorful, and stays true to the style by being very drinkable despite the copious amount hops that is typical of FFF. The smell is off the hook...piney hops that just are incredibly inviting. The taste is more subdued, with a mellow citrusy hoppiness that just begs for another sip. I would buy this beer constantly if it were available in Mass and were less than $7 a bomber."
"Overall this is just an enjoyable brew that I could find myself using as a session brew if it wasn't as pricey as it is. This is definitely worth a try if you see it anywhere."
"Drinkability: An extremely drinkable beer. A big, hoppy Irish red, who would have thought? 3 Floyds again shows why they are one of the better craft brewers. Plenty of hops to satisfy most hop heads, but also very well balanced. A great session beer, especially at 5.9% abv. Not true to style but who cares, a damn good beer all around. Seek this one out and enjoy."
"That actually sums up my experience with this beer overall -- I guess I was expecting more."
"The best thing I can say about this beer is that it got smoother with every sip...but I definitely wouldn't get it again. Sorry Floyds."
"Poured an intense dark copper/rust color with a frothy head that just sat there for a few minutes leaving behind plenty of lacing. Full of carbonation with tiny bubbles speeding to the surface to join the party. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, grass, roasted malt, and rubber; exciting and a bit unusual. The taste followed the scent with a malty core that was surrounded by juicy, citrus hops. Fruity and earthy sweetness gives way to bold and potent hops that linger in the finish generating a bitter taste. Good mouthfeel, just a tad slick. With the taste and aromas this is a flavorful beer that can be enjoyed again and again without a problem."
"Drinkability & Notes  Its a fine beer, I just wish that Three Floyds didn't have to pile hops into every beer they make. This is a lot like a sweeter maltier version of Alpha King. I'd take Conway's Irish Ale over this if I was looking for something a bit truer to style, but this is still a tasty beer if you look at it for what it is."
"I will drink this again, for sure."
"A clean copper/red beer with deep ruby highlights. Has a big bubbly beige haed with a tinge of red and a little bit of lace. The aroma starts with a strong duo of floral and citrusy hops. With a hint of carmel malt in the background. The caramel malt lands on the tip of your tongue as the floral and citrusy hops character rushes by the sides. There is a dry finish with a tea like note at the end"
"This strikes me as elements of multiple styles melded to produce a very pleasing mesh of tasteful compatibility. It's got a credible, warm ABV, but it's very crisp, clean, and drinkable in spite of its apparent size. It goes to show that in the hands of a master, a diverse Many can be wedded into a damned good One."
"Overall this is a good brew. This is a red ale that any hop head would love. Nicely done."
"This is just outstanding on tap, way better than I remember it being in the bottle. Wow! Brian Boru blends biting pine and orange zest hop flavors with robust caramel and brown sugar malts. Its full of body and spunk. It looks good with a red amber body and thick tan cream head. The malts and hops are balanced beautifully in the aromas of mandarin, pineapple, toffee, and caramel. Carbonation is minimal. MF is creamy initially, becomes dry and biting halfway through, and then goes back to the malts. I cant say that it really fits the style, but it obviously isnt meant too. Its a great beer that just happens to cost way too much in the bottle these days. All the more reason to seek it out on tap."
"I am not typically an Irish red ale fan, but I have great faith in Three Floyds, so I gave it a shot. Deep, satisfying red color. The overly malty-sweet quality that drives me away from Irish reds was not there. It had a grapefruit-esque smell similar to what you find in Alpha King. The front end had a surprisingly crisp, citrus hop quality with nice subtle malty undertones. Clean mouthfeel. I will definately drink this again if I encounter it on tap."
"This was poured from a 22 oz. bomber- it produced a 1/2 inch head that subsided into just surface skim, and left decent lacing on the way down. The ale was deep reddish brown, like tea. Powerfull and pleasant citrus aroma - citrus, grapefuit, some pine, pretty much all hops, no hint of malt-. Taste was similar- grapefuit, and orange hop dominating this ale. Doughy, pleasant, bready malt hanging way in the back, quietly providing backbone, not at all sweet, and without any roasted acridness, there was even a slight aftertaste of tea. And all the time grapefruit, oranges, lemon, hops, and hops, and very dry - hey!! : This is really an IPA in disguise! Mouthfeel was smooth and full, very satisfying, with moderate carbonation. Drinkability- This goes down easy ! This is an excellent ale and I will certainly enjoy it from time to time."
"I had been waiting to try this beer for some time and it was certainly worth the wait (I know I said the same thing about the Dreadnaught, but its so true.) especially since I know I wont be disappointed by Three Floyds."
"On tap at Track 84 in Warwick, RI. This beer pours reddish brown with an unholy darkness to an Irish Red Ale that was truly awesome! The smell is classic Floyds in that it had a fresh, flowered hoppiness to it not found in any other Irish Red Ales. The hoppiness transfers over in the taste as well, mixing with orange and herbs on the tremendously long finish. The mouthfell was just right. Not too heavy or too thin, but perfectly balanced. I ended up having 4 or 5 throughout the evening, and at 5.9% alc (which suprised me when I found out) it was easy to drive the hour and a half home. It's a shame this beer isn't around longer, but I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
"Slainte"
"The color of this beer is a rich amber, slightly hazy and topped by a thick tan head that shows nice retention. I love the aroma of 3 Floyds beers. See my comments on the Black Sun stout. This beer has even more rich hop aroma. The same floral character I get in many of their beers, but with a more intense citrus/orange character in this offering. The flavor is slightly sweet with a bright edge of citrus grapefruit that hits you immediately. Malty finish of caramel and toffee. Slick mouth feel, not particularly full. Good drinkability, no alcohol feel. This is one of the better beers Ive had of this style, but not a favorite 3 Floyds. Still very nice."
"D - Very nice on all accounts, a nice interesting flavor and one you could sit with for a long time."
"Drinkability is good on another tasty winner from the floyds."
"Mouthfeel- Great carbonation, and being just shy of 6% abv, a great session beer. The balance of hops and malts makes this beer so very appealing and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this brew. Several pints can be consumed in a session. Worth a look."
"Drinkability could be better. Very dry and bitter, not exactly one of the most refreshing Irish Reds I've had, but leave it to 3F's to give you a kick in the ass with their spin on a seemingly ordinary style. Good stuff, but I don't know if I will revisit it. Once again, tied with Dark Lord for the most badass label ever."
"Rich dark amber color, yet perfectly clear, and a very nice off white head. The smell is mainly hops, not overly malty. This is odd, it says on the bottle there are pineapple aromas, and I can actualy detect a hint of it in the citrus aftertaste. Other than that, which in truth is a fairly minor note, this is pretty hoppy for a red, but well balanced with the complex malts. The mouthfeel is slighly sticky, but again, well balanced. Overall, this is easily the most enjoyable red I've had. I don't usualy go for red ales, but I am a pretty big fan of the Three Floyds brews. As far as I'm concerned, this redefines the style."
"Drinkability is good. This seems to be a more interesting version of the style, but I can totally dig it. Hops are nicely over expressed."
"Clear reddish brown with almost no head. Piney and grassy hops in the aroma. Some nice sweetness too, caramel and vanilla mostly. Caramel and brown sugar make this sweet with a lingering bitterness balancing the flavor. Some slightly citrusy notes that came out a little more as it warmed. Thin to medium bodied. This would make a pretty nice session beer."
"1st of 5 beers tried at our first meeting of the South Bend Coalition of the Drinking. Good looking bottle and i anticipated the beer greatly since i'd just been up to 3 floyds this past weekend. pours out nicely. some carbonation, reddish brown color. some lacing. odor is biscuity with some hoppiness. Not much hop taste. more like caramel and biscuits, grapefruit, weak bitter chocolate undertones. Bitter aftertaste. Not best tasting red i've had, but fairly good. Damn good drinkability though, gimme another."
"In conclusion, while the popular Smithwick's is certainly no slouch of an Irish Red Ale, it just doesn't have the complexity or the spirit to compete with the FFF gang."
"tasty, and not as ""challenging"" as some of the other 3Fs offerings, I like this and when reasonably priced it is worth picking up, it has a nice little mix of everything."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is just a fantastic effort. Maybe the most friendly bomber presentation for cross over drinking. Just a fantastic meduim bodied beer with a proper amount of carbonation. This beer slides right down the throat."
"Drinkability: About as Irish as a St. Patrick's Day parade, but I'm not complaining too much. Midwest represent!. A nice hoppy red ale with some chutzpah."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Great overall beer!!!"
"I wanted Brian Boru Old Irish Red to be bigger, more resiny and more unrelentingly hoppy, but I've made my peace with what it is rather than what I wish it was. The bottom line is that it's another fantastic effort from those hop-obsessed Hoosiers. This is Borutiful beer."
" The mouthfeel is light, yet somewhat syrupy, from the hops most likely. The carbonation is mid-level. The drinkability is fantastic, due to the low ABV and clean finish. Other than the hoppiness, which seems to increase as the beer warms, this might be a good introduction to craft beer for the nonbeliever."
"But not really drinkable -for-me-. The blend of flavors is just a bit overpowering. It seems like an interesting experiment and a well-made beer but the particular hops used (and quantities thereof) don't allow me to fully appreciate it - not even enough for me to order a second one..."
"Slàinte!"
"This is a very good beer."
"Pours deep clear amber with a thin tan head that leaves patches of lace. Has a lovely aroma that's full of juicy floral and piney hops. Flavor begins sweet and malty with notes of caramel, then finishes with a hoppy bitterness that is spicy and satisfying. The beer has low carbonation and is quite light. Not one of the most in your face beers the Floyd's have put out, but quite tasty and refreshing."
"Thanks go out to the Ard Ri of reviews...cokes."
"Drinkability- Seems like the in thig to do is to make a Red Ale taste like an IPA. Oh well, it was pretty good whatever it is."
"red-clear-fizzy. not much head. aroma is engulfed by bigtime caramelly malts and sweet/tart grapefruit hops. slight hint of sweet smokiness and something floral to boot. explosive for a red, true to three floyds. medium mouthfeel and rather hoppy throughout. estery honey smacks you in the aftertaste. bitterness is quick and rolls by leaving no trace. very drinkable and huge on flavor. i will buy this beer if i ever come across it again. nice bottle and label which adds to the stellar appearance."
"The beer pours a nice ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a fine malt scent that is full of caramel and toffee aroma. It also has a tremendous hop aroma that is citrusy and highly bitter. The taste is good. It has a smooth caramel flavor with a bitter hop edge. It goes down easy and finishes dry, yet sweet with loads of citrus hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a great red ale. It has awesome aroma and taste; a real treat."
"Overall. Dangerously drinkable. And at just under 6% alcohol you can drink a lot of it without getting too drunk. Another great beer from a great brewery. I think I will go have some more."
"outstanding beer overall -- will try again."
"Very nice, although I've never had an Irish Red like this. Maybe more brewers should follow suit."
"Drinkability is good one of the better reds out there even with its small imperfections. Buy some now if you can give it a try know I will be."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the slightly hazy (yet still clear) coppery amber brew. Head dims but stands tall at half height, with delicate, if somewhat sparse, lacing. Aroma is malty to style, yet the piney hops are an integral part here as well. Taste is almost perfectly balanced, with ample grains and hops complementing each other. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb for the style, going down creamily and with ease. Best red I've had at least in a long time, if not best period."
"Drinkability - perfect balance of big beer flavor and approachability. A top-notch beer for 'crossover crowd' tasting parties. One of the most sessionable beers in bomber format I've ever had."
"Thanks, Joe, for luring us to this well stocked Indiana packy. Its been 2 days since I have had a brew from the masters at 3F and I am feeling the hop NEED!"
"Drinkability: Nothing like any Irish Red Ale that I've sampled before, but not a big surprise coming from Three Floyds. This one seems to be some kind of Irish Red hybrid, but succeeds on its overall quality and fine construction. Excellent drinkability. The Amarillo hops really work well here. Very tasty!"
"22 ounce bomber. This beer pours out dark red with a large, dense head. For a beer, this smells a lot like grapefruit. There is also caramel in the aroma. The flavor is grapefruit again, but not at all sour or bitter. Malt flavors come out as the beer warms. While this beer has a lot of flavor, it is somehow light and fluffy. Addictive drinkability. Hop burps are among the best I've had. Between this beer and the Gumballhead, Three Floyds has proved how far they can take what are usually known as non-experimental styles of beer."
"Another damn fine beer from Three Floyds. Only drawback could be price. At $6.99 for a bomber, I can see having one or two a year. Knock that down to $6.99 a sixer, and I'll have at least a case a year. Definitely worth a try at any rate."
"I have been on a streak lately with some great beers. This one courtesy of starchild. It pours a firebrick red out of the bottle. Very clear. Great light refraction against the wall. Thick foam head. Stringy lace. Nose is old pine with an awesome malt and caramel backdrop. It is what my ""Martha Stewart"" SO refers to as worn. Flavor is much of the same, malty and piney; only more pronounced. Lots of roasted caramel on top of a nice hop layer that provides a great balance. Maybe a little ctrius too, but I cannot narrow as to what citrus is could be... Mouthfeel is halfway between medium and full bodied. Nice finish that leaves the mouth dry enough to want another sip, bit not so dry that the sip needs to be water."
"Drinkability was high for the aggression of this brew. Really enjoyed and savored each glass."
"Mouthfeel is thin for an Irish red as well. I would expect a bit more body from the makers of Dark Lord, but I was let down. Not one to seek out again, at least, not in my book."
"Freed from its bomber, this brew fills my glass a red orange hue, with some haze. Slight whitish head. Aroma is hoppier than I would have expected - not at all a bad thing. Toasty malt and sweet caramel coexist with clean citrous and floral hops. Smooth malts lead the flavor with some toasty breadiness apparent, as well as hints of caramel. Hops are crisp and present in a big way. Bitter citrous and some resinous pine threaten the malt backbone. Quite hoppy for an Irish ale, but you'll never hear me complaining about that. Finish is slightly drying citrous mixed with a little sweetness. Cheers to Three Floyds for their take on the style."
"Drinkability: Smooth and wonderfully drinkable. This would make an excellent daily drinker if I could get more of it."
"The body is so smooth with loads of malt complexity. Hops are well shown here but not near as dominant as in the nose. Plus they're really not that bitter, just flavorful which is good for an Irish Red imo. Caramel, biscuit, pine, and light fruit notes are in the malts. Nothing too sweet, in fact, sweetness is held to a minumim. Great balance. Tons of flavor without any excess sweetness or bitterness. Very well made, I bet the Irish would drink this by the gallons!"
"Pours a dark amber color with a tall head that has decent retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops. Bunches and bunches of citrus hop with just a touch of caramel malt. The flavor doesn't have the extreme hop profile that the aroma foretold, but there's still some hop flavor. Slightly fruity with a nice malt character. Pretty well balanced and enjoyable. Light body and easy to drink."
"Special thanks to cmaruschak."
"Pours a deep amber with a nice long lasting head and great lace. An immense amout of hop bouquet is immediate. Citrusy and although you know some nice carmalized malt is in there it is not very detectable due to all the hop fragrence. Upon tasting the hops are not as immediate and some of the malts come shining through. A bit fruity. Suprisingly light considering the color. The hoppiness of it balances out the malts nicely and make it much more drinkable. Proabably a bit to hoppy for the style but a damn tasty and quality beer."
"Cracked open the bottle and immediately smelled hops. Poured the entire bomber into a large mug, the red body with a cascading thin head, with tons of carbonation. Smells of flowery hops with a bitter back to it, fruits, maybe a peach... or apple... and caramel malt. Taste. Hops are on the tip of the tongue, with a nice sweet caramel and even a little fruit, more of the apple seems to be coming through. Let me take a second drink. Definitely taste more of the caramel with the hops. I can probably drink this entire glass within the next five minutes, but I shall savor it instead."
"A clear tea-steeped reddish liquid with a nice head of white foam that syats around for the long haul. Aromas are the unique three floyds hop blend (amarillo+?). This reminds me of a pumped up, red version of Yards' newest edition of their Phily Pale Ale. Anyways. The aromas is all citrusy hops, pineapple, and toasted, biscuity malts. Nice. The taste is juicy with the fresh hops, and nicely malty as well, with a sweet biscuity kiss. This stuff just smells and tastes so fresh and juciy that it slides down the throat with eaze. Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied and drinkability is excellent!"
"Orange-amber body, lasting beige ring. Rather dull aroma, this seems so simple and feels like déjà vu as much as anything else. Ample grapefruity/tangerine like hops dominate (while being fairly fragile) the leafy and rocky aroma. Mineral palate, thin-medium bodied, highly carbonated. Very dry palate boasting more astringent hops than is recommendable. Very earthy, herbal (lichen, algae).. Those hops feels raw and attaches to the palate, this is not aggressive, its just dull in the same sense than a fly you want to push away. I do like dreadnaught and alpha king, but I dont recognize 3 floyds here"
"I always cant wait to taste a new to me 3 Floyds product so I had to try this the day I bought it. Crystal clear amber with a tall cream colored head. Streaky lacing was left on the glass. Big piney hop nose. This hit me as a bit of a surprise with a red ale, but then again it is 3 Floyds. Even with the huge hoppiness there is a great sweet maltiness that manages to show itself. Very excellent aroma. Caramel malt upfront on the flavor with a backend hop kick. Floral and piney hops are plenty. Tasty stuff that ends with a bitter sweet finish. Great mouthfeel and it is quite creamy. Very easy drinking and it is quite sessionable. Reminds me of what they did to the Porter with Alpha Klaus. Great stuff all around especially for the hop heads."
"Overall, the beer leans heavily towards the hops, moreso than I'd anticipate for the style, but still a very tasty product. It carries all the character of a beer brewed by the Floyds in Indiana. Clean, bright, bitter, with an appropriate malt as called for by the style. Definately worthwhile."
"Thanks to orbitalr0x for this one. It pours a deep amber color with a 2 finger head that falls to a finger over top of the beer. The nose is nice and piney, with a good sweet caramel underneath the hop. Very nice. The flavor is actually more mellow than expected. How I like it. The first to hit is sweet caramel, followed by a very mellow, but very flavorful piney hop. The feel is moerate wtih a moerate carbonation. As far as red beers go, this is the most flavorful one I have ever had. I know its not what is supposed to be for style, but damnit all if I don't like this take more than the style. Very easy drinking and smooth."
"22 oz bottle pours a clear bright amber with a creamy off white head that leaves lots of lacing in my glass. Citrus fruity aromas, pineapple, grapefruit and caramel flavors. Unlike any Irish Ale I have ever had. Medium bodied with a somewhat watery mouthfeel, finishes bitter, this is very tasty."
"A nice amber. And nice too to have something not widely tried yet. Higher than average carbonation on hops and malt and caramel. More hophead feed. Grapefruit, floral aroma in hops.Mid-sip toast. Medium mouthfeel. Not the best Three Floyd.Radekfest #2."
"That said, this is kind of the maltier version of the FFF mold...not surprising or even that noteworthy. Moreover, for $6 a bomber I would much rather go with Founder's Red Rye, which is an absolutely comparable beer for much cheaper."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a dark tan head. Smell is pure amarillos. Nice lemon and grassy smell. Taste is dry and of light caramel. Mostly dominated by hops of the amarillo variety. Very tasty red ale, but nothing really irish about it. Mouthfeel is nice for the style, not too thick, but not thin by any means. I would love to drink this stuff by the gallon. Very nice, but as said before, not very irish"
"This is another great brew from my favorite brewery. IF you can find this, you have GOT to try it! ...I wish their limited beers weren't so limited, and were available in 6-packs...."
"22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium ruby color with three fingers of head. There is a good deal of lacing on the glass. The smell is a little bit sweet, but overall just very very hoppy. You can really tell those Amarillo hops in there! The taste is nice and malty at first, slightly sweet and a touch of honey flavor. The finish is nice and hoppy, but not super hoppy like the aroma. It's actually a very well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is super thick and heavy. The drinkability is great as well. Three Floyds knows their shit."
"I'm finishing this bomber, but won't be buying more."

"22 ounce bottle purchased at OUAV in Richmond for $5.99. This has very little Irish about it except the label and is an American Amber."
"I absolutely loved this brew on-tap at the Hopleaf in Chicago so I had a friend pick me up a bottle from Kahn's on his way to Lafayette. It appears to pour just a shade darker than from tap, a nice ruby tinged with a light brown supporting a 1 finger pale tan head. Citrusy notes of Amarillo are strong in the nose as well as a nice carmel malt-ish sweetness. A little bit of chocalate rounds out the aroma. Very impressive for an Irish red. Taste is very crisp. Although one could easily say that Three Floyd's over uses Amarillos, I love the edge that they give to their brews. The intial citrus punch soon fades into a sea of sweet malt finishing with notes of caramel. Superbly drinkable. I'm not usually a fan of ambers/irish reds but I absolutely love this beer. I'll surely miss Three Floyd's after moving away in a few months."
"Exceptionally drinkable. That is all there is to say about this one."
"Mouthfeel is nice with a smooth, creamy body that is rather full. This goes down so easily I could drink it all night. I must say..this is the Irish Red I want to be drinking on St. Patty's Day. Three Floyd's has done it yet again. Highly recommended."
"This beer named after a rumored ancestor poured a dark reddish amber color and formed a nice off white foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops and slight bit of caramel. The flavor was of of malt, hops, caramel and and slight hint of pepper. The finish is slightly astigent with a definate hop edge to it. Leave it to the Three Floyd folks to twist the formula."
"Leave it to Three Floyds to break the mold on a straightforward and common beer style. This beer is a dark clear reddish-amber color with a tall and foamy beige head. Thin patches of lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is amazingly floral, with hops and malt in the wings. Medium-bodied and very hoppy, with some citrus, malt and caramel flavors. The finish is bitter and hoppy yet somewhat smooth. Stacked up against the rest of the Amber Ales out there, this one definitely raises eyebrows."
"D-This is not your father's Irish red. It is an Irish red that 3F's made their own. It does have a big burst of hops and a great flavor. However I don't feel the malt is there to support the hops in this delicious monster, at least enough to call it an ""Irish Red Ale"". The hops are all grapefruit in punch and I would like to see more dimensions to the hop characteristics. This is another good solid beer from 3F's but not a great beer yet. I will be buying more to age."
"While this is far from anything one might expect from an Irish Red, this has definately been stamped by 3F, with signature citurusy hop flavors and bold, yet tasty, proclamations of beer enthusiasm. Still pricy for a bomber, but worth a shot for the season."
"So far only availible at the brewery, go out and get some if you have the chance."
