"Serving type: bottle."
""
"Single 330 ml bottle poured into a tulip. A rather dark ruddy brown with a huge frothy beige head that initially filled two-thirds of my glass before settling to leave a few dollops of lacing here and there. Aroma quite sweet and malty with a clear fruity overtone: Brown sugar, apples, apricot, faintly woody yeast. Less sweet on the palate and by my reckoning features less of a toffee pudding or cookie flavor than do many other Irish reds. More sour fruit, nut, and molasses character with some citrus iced tea and herb notes. Medium thin pale ale-like body with a dryish herbal finish in which I can detect some leafy hop. More hop character than is typical for the style. Quite crisp and refreshing if on the fizzy side."
"My ""gateway"" craft beer. Still good anytime I have it."

"O- Above average, roasty and tasty. Otherwise just OK."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Irish Red Ale."
""
"Overall this is a very good red ale, smell and taste is spot on, very clean and flavorful especially for the low ABV. Worth picking up for $1.75."
""
"Pours a dark clear rusty brown, a medium slowly fading beige head, light lacing. Aroma and Taste of toasted caramel malt and grains, yeast and fruity notes with some earthy hops bitter notes. A medium body, crisp, good carbonation. Finishes with toasted caramel malt and grains, fruity, some yeast, with an earthy hops ending for balance and mild nutty flavor. A good beer for the style, has the typical Irish Ale characteristics. A good drinking brew."

"Pours a dull reddish brown. Nice, warm color. Some cloudiness. A couple fingers of off-white head. Good retention. Rich malty aroma. Lots of sweet bready malt and toasty caramel. Mild spicy hop character. Fairly simple aroma, but for a 4.4% abv beer, it's relatively big and rich. Taste is similar. Considering the strength of the beer, there's lots of sweet caramel malt flavor and a good undercurrent of hops in the background. Carbonation is pretty low. Just a bit of prickliness. Kinda soapy. Finish is a bit mineral-ish, and the beer mostly dries out. It's a nice, low abv red ale with a mild hop character and rich malt. Easy to drink."
"pretty solid example of the style and I like a flavorful brew that I can drink several of without getting buzzed"

"O: Porterhouse did a great job staying true to style with this one. This is a textbook Irish Red, and the body/mouthfeel is truly great. Highly sessionable to boot. I could see it pairing very nicely with a grassy Irish cheddar. Unfortunately, the American palate tends to only appreciate sweeter, hoppier ""Americanized"" reds. I can see this gem slipping through the cracks in our market. The high price tag doesn't help."

"A pretty tasty Irish red ale - my go-to has always been Smithwicks (sometimes even just to pronounce it properly), but were this as readily available, the contest wouldn't even be close."
"Well balanced and fairly complex. Better than the majority of reds Iâ€™ve had in the last little while. Light and slightly spicy hopsg with juicy, roasty-toasty sweet malts and long finish makes this a joy. An approachable beer for most, but not complex enough for the seasoned, the flavour and mild complexity make a great and affordable everyday beer."

"This is an Irish red ale? Okay. If you say so. Seems to carry a decent spicy hop thing in there. I'd say there is a pleasant malt base on there as well. Perhaps I am used to explosive flavors American brewers are delivering. Or perhaps it's just that not many people are making irish red ales, so I don't know what to compare it to or what to expect. Either way, this is a pretty nice ale. Good character. Well rounded. Pleasure to drink. I can dig it."

"Irish Reds are a style generally bereft of character, but this beer's got it in spades. Interesting, complex, drinkable, and low-abv, a fantastic session beer if you ask me."
""
""
"This is a fine beer for the uninitiated, and could easily be a transitional brew from the mass market to the world of craft beer. Otherwise, this would be well suited to a tailgate party or other event where beer is not the focus."
"O: A decent beer, not overly complex but fits the style. I could imagine myself downing a few pints of this with some traditional Irish cuisine at a pub."
""
"O: Really enjoyable and really refreshing - this is very much a session beer. Very good example of the style and drinkable like the other beers I have tried from this brewery."
""
"Single finger head with decent lacing on a deep amber and garnet body. Aroma is very sweet with malts and even some dark fruit notes. The flavor is also mostly malts but they are strongly represented with a mild hop bitterness to the finish. This is very robust red, even for an Irish red. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Very complex Irish red, one of the best out there."
"O: A slightly above-average offering, but wish there was a bit more complexity here. Easy to drink and quite smooth, but they have better offerings for sure."
""
"Overall this beer certainly emphasizes drinkability with enough malty sweetness/flavor to keep me interested. Given it's NYE and I've got a long way to go, opening up with a modest but well-flavored beer like this made sense to me."

"This brew poured out as a rather nice looking red color with a healthy looking tan head on top. The lacing is very light but the retention is good. The smell of the beer is earthy, slightly sweet and a little nutty. The flavors are creamy, nutty, a bit of caramel and some grains. The mouthfeel is smooth and very drinkable. Overall this beer was really quite nice for a good drinkable brew."
"Overall a pleasant red ale on par with other Irish craft reds. Definitely not to be put in the same brackets with the only macro red brewed in Ireland - Smithwicks and it's nitro sibling Kilkenny. Recommended."
"Pours brownish red in color.White brief crown is dense with small bubbles.Yeast & fruity aromas, chocolate hints.Smooth hoppy flavor slightly sweet,hues of chocolate & dry nut notes. Crispy mouthfeel, full body & good carbonation. Brief dry bitter aftertaste.Refreshing."
"O - A very well crafted red ale, something that the style most certainly needs in terms of refinement and freshness, highly recommended."
"o. Not a huge red ale fan, but a wonderful unique taste. Nice for a cool day."
"Pours rich deep red color with the thick amount in carbonation. Initial aroma is thick hoppy and roasted caramel with a trailing aroma of cocoa. Rich hoppy taste with an initial taste in of hopps with only slight bitterness and finishes smoothly and bitterness mellows out rather quikcly."
"Taste is light plumy fruitiness up front, some faint caramelly grain, and a tea-leaf bitterness with hint of peppery bit that takes over lightly at the finish and lingers. It has nice balance, a little nice complexity, and is very good."
"This is just a slightly above average brew with a decent chocolate flavor. The cap is probably the most interesting part of this brew."
"Overall: A bland, unoffensive beer from Porterhouse. This is tough style to accomplish, since it is so easy to make a boring beer. I don't understand why they put this on nitro; it killed the little complexity this beer had. Maybe a cask would be a better vessel for this brew."
"D. I would appreciate this far more if it had much less carbonation in it. Nice to try but once is enough thank you."
"But is this supposed to be on nitro?"
"The taste was quite bitter but still malty. It was refreshing, would make a perfect bottle to chug while waiting on the barbecue!"
"Taste-Toasted malt,soft mineral note,subtle English hop bite. Very friendly and drinkable. Clean, smooth, and flavorfull. Would make an excellent St Pat's day session brew at 4.4ABV, however price is a bit prohibitive."
"D- I may never go back to American Reds again. Fantastic beer."
"D- It had a watery, malty finish. Overall, a definite must try from the Porterhouse selection and as an Irish Red. Would have again although not my first choice in Irish Reds."
"D: Overall drinkability was not bad, but certainly not what I envisioned or come to expect from a irish red. Felt really strange and ends up drinking better if you don't think about it the second time around."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very light bodied and smooth. It isn't worth the plus five dollar price tag that I payed for it. I would much rather drink a Great Lakes Conway's Irish. The flavors here are subtle, which can be nice at times. But they just don't present themselves enough."
"Pours a deep dark golden almost reddish in color with a good sized fuzzy white head that slowly recedes to form a cap and lots of sticky lace. Smells great! Dark crystal malt sweetness hints of dark fruits and burnt sugar. Very little to any hop present in the aroma. Taste is malty sweet with light caramel slightly bready with some dark fruit and an earthy hop bite that surfaces just long enough to keep it on the right side of cloying. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation and a medium to light body. Very simple but quite tasty brew, very easy to drink sessionable ale. If not for the price tag I could easily see more of these in my future."
"It pours a handsome clear dark amber with a fairly thick, if not too persistent head. Aroma is fairly strong and malty with a fruity undertone. Flavor is fruity and malty, a bit on the thin side. Texture is somewhat fizzy and a little watery. Nevertheless, it is still palatable."
"Expensive, 4.99 a single and 15.99 a four pack???WTF is going on here in Ohio. Clear copper hue with a bright khaki head forming thick fine speckled lacing. Aroma has some herbal/grassy notes not so much pine, but it's there a bit. Hints of caramel but no candy like tones in the nose, really subtle malt profile, kind of airy. Flavor is really dry not even bready malt, kind of watered down cereal grains. A pretty big disappointment to me, based on what I paid for it. It looked like craft imported beer, but ended up mediocre import selections. Goes down smooth with bitter earthy finishing hops dry bitterness actually. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied mellow carbonation that finishes bone dry. Drinkability is unimpressive a decent beer but not one I shoud be paying top dollar for due to rarity."
"D: The beer goes down very smoothly; I could easily drink this beer all night long."
"Hops -- Galena, Nugget, East Kent Goldings"
"Overall a tasty and rather complex red ale."
"Toasted malts dominate the flavor profile of this beer. Not so much as to be overly sweet by any means. I could taste biscuits, crackers, and white bread crust. The hops added a little grass and earth to keep some of the sweeteness in check. The mouthfeel has some a nice dryness to it that adds to this beers awesome sessionability."
"D-a good pairing or session beer, not a stand-alone star"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer with enough flavor and substance to make it worth pounding for a long time."
"Pours a big frothy deep caramel brown, solid head retention. Smell was a big bitter, skunky almost pale lagery after pulling the cap. Taste was nothing like the smell, almost watery and light, but definate roasted malts. This is quite drinkable but nothing special."
"D: At least it's 4.4%, but come on. If I'm at the Porterhouse, I'll have the Brain Blasta for near the same price."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hinr of sulfur, and slight hop. Fits the style of an Irish Red Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight hop, hint of sweet malt, sulfur, and hint of grain. Overall, the sulfur hurts, but other than that a generally weak Irish."
"Appearance is pale reddish amber with thin white head. Nose is fairly faint despite the appropriate serving temperature. Some pale caramel comes out. Palate is round and pleasantly wide with solid carbonation. There is that classic roasted malt that Irish reds are known for. Balance is found in this beer and it's subtle. Would be easy to drink a bunch of these, if only I liked the style. Oh well. Can't like them all right? (Still find it to be a well made beer.)"
"The aroma is pretty good but not exactly like most red ales ( not that that is a bad thing). There is plenty of grassy, hay like hops, a bit of yeast, and honey. The taste is like the aroma with malt of front and hop bitterness at the back end. The palate is thin for the style but smooth from carbonation. Overall a good beer but that's about it."
"drinkability: this was just an avg red ale. nothing remarkable about it."
"The aftertast last for a long while, and I could taste it a few minuttes after I was done. Not a bad beer at all, just not exceptional."
"OK, I'm done with these guys for a while, that's for sure. If yesterday's Oyster Stout is their best beer," ouch!"" to that I say. This pours a beautiful Red Amber. Lots of carbonation and another creamy head. No lacing on this at all though. Smell, what there is of it, is gone as quickly as the head is. However, when it's there, it's loaded with nice stone fruit - cherries, peaches, nectarines, and some sweetness. Flavor is a different story. There's nothing there. As quickly as it hits your mouth, it's gone into a long and faint finish. Some saltiness, but not close to what's in the stout, and some hoppiness, but they instantly fade into this vibrantly colorless finish. Not worth tracking down."
"D: Not at all bad, but there's nothing here that makes me want to drink this beer again. It's fairly bland and uninteresting. I'm not trying to be a ""typical American"" here and need some monster ABV, but some nice flavor would be a good start."
"Overall there was nothing special about this beer however there rarely is with Irish Red's. A nice beer that likely benefitted a bit from the nitro-pour. Worth a shot."
"Light amber, reddish color. Very mild aroma. Amazing taste and mouthfeel. Buttery biscuits, a little cherry and strawberry. The flavor is just on the cusp of caramel and toffee flavors. The hops are virtually unnoticeable till the finish. A slight wheat character comes through in the smell and taste. I could definitely see myself taking my time with this beer at a bar. Probably an excellent pairing with any sort of pub food."
"Drinks: incompletely. Porterhouse Red has a lot of malt complexity for such a mild beer. Were it not for the mouthfeel, I'd call this a very decent Irish Red. As it stands, however...meh."
"D: A drinkable beer."
"The body was typical for a nitro red, semi-full and smooth. Drinkability was very good, easy to drink and clean. Overall, a nice little beer, worth trying when you see it."
"Pours a very excellent light burnished copper with great lastiing head and excellent lacing throughout. It has a wonderfully malty scent without being too deep (true to an Irish red instead of an Irish stout), with that great Irish red twist in the nose. Great taste, a wonderfully malty beer with a nice tart tang and very slightly fruity finish. Goes down great, a little too smooth in fact! Well done on this Irish red."
"D- Goes down nice, but just not a lot going on with the beer that would make me order another."
"I haven't completed my 20 reviews yet or else I would add it to the list and give it 4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5 The food at the brewery is also excellent!"
"Drinkability: my overall impression of this red ale is that it is served way...too cold. The temp. certainly doesn't help because in my point of view, a good ale has to be served in a slightly chilled or just cool condition for the nose and body to be revealed. Alas, for this potentially pleasant half-pint I simply didn't have unlimited time to wait for it to warm up. A real shame."
"I visited the Porterhouse on my trip to Ireland and was hoping to try some true Irish brewed beer. The Porterhouse is the only microbrewery in Dublin and so that is where I ended up - Good call. Their Red ale is simply awesome. Opaque orange/reddish color body producing a sick-ass creamy off-white head that lasts all the way to the last drop. Smell is light with roasted malt and fruit notes. Sweet malt flavor throughout with a satisfying hop bitterness. Great caramel flavor. An enticing dryness in the end which just makes you want to take another sip. Not very strong at 4.4 but it tastes great so who cares. You can just keep on drinking em! Mouthfeel is very thick and rich for a pale ale. It has the mouthfeel of a stout. Absolutely amazing. Highly recommended if you ever visit Dublin."
"Very watery body, with some toffee in the aftertaste."
"Was pretty good, but a bit timid in flavour, and for me had a bit of a buttery taste which i didn't mind, but didn't like. Lightly sweet malts in the start, lightly dry and not really bitter hoppy finish. A bit light, yes, but not bad, Irish Red Ales have never been a favourite."
