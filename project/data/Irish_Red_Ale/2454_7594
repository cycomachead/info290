3.23,-10,,,,,,"No idea how old this is, but it's a gusher. Took 5 minutes to see what color it was. It's amber with a billowing cream head. Aroma is metallic, with nutty notes and specialty malt fruitiness. Flavor is also metallic and nutty, with herbal hop notes. That metallic character dominates, though. Becomes phenolic as it warms.","barczar","Oct 04, 2014"

The flavor is more balanced with a nice hop bitterness, but the sweet caramel malts are still a bit dominant, but not quite as fruity as the nose would suggest. Medium bodied, but it feels a bit thin because of a fine carbonation that is almost reminiscent of an adjunct-lager.

Light copper red to orange color, complete transparency without seeming watery. The strength of the caramel and roasted coffee is out of balance with the whole, hence the nose is very dominated by the former, over time managing to offer honey oats, burning hay bales, stone moss and a thin slice of lemon. Medium-bodied, here the malts not as roasted, more so Nestle Quik powder, caramel and honey oat cereal. Carbonation fits the overall weight and flavor level. Hops akin to straw slowly lit by a match, one by one. No citrus notes. Finishes smoothly enough, doesn't lose much weight but didn't have much to begin with.","farrago","Feb 15, 2009"

3.63,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Biscuity and doughy malts in the aroma, which morphs a bit into a woody and toasted nuts taste. Nice. Dry and crisp finish, if in South Carolina Id say go for a sixer anytime. I was bumming I only had one.","Vancer","Jun 11, 2007"
3.7,3.1,3,3,4,4,4,"Poured a nice hazyorange, with no head and some decent lacing. Nice streams of carbonation coming from th botom of the glass. Smell was light, grainy with a hint of sweetness. The taste really caught me off guard. Came off vey sour. Hints of grapes and pears, more complex then I thought. Very light and well carbonated, and goes down very smooth. Overall tis wasalot more of a beer then I thought it was going to be. Seems like they have done a bit of exploring with this. Very complex and a good drinker.","mikesgroove","Mar 25, 2007"
2.9,-19.2,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Pours a reddish orange with only a lacy head around the edges of the glass. Smell is sugary and dry malts, and marmalade, some hops in the background. It smells thicker than it tastes, not much of a hop presence outside of the smell though. The mouthfeel is sturdy at first, but not much after that. It doesn't hold up over time. A decent beer, but there are a lot better red ales out there.","saintwarrick","Feb 14, 2007"
3.03,-15.6,4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Seems like they're on the right track but they need to change something somewhere in the process or ingredients to make this highly quaffable. Glad I only sprang for a single.","daliandragon","Jan 21, 2007"
3.39,-5.6,3,4,3,3.5,3.5,"I get the feeling that Thomas Creek didnt set out to redefine the style with this beer, but rather settled on something very average and safe. This isnt a bad beer, but its got little to help it stand out from the pack, either. I do like the fact that its brewed in my state, folks in SC need all the help they can get.","kkipple","Oct 27, 2006"
3.07,-14.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Smell was sweet malts. Period. In fact, this reminded me of a breakfast cereal. Taste was a bit bitter up front with some dry malt on the finish. Mouthfeel was very thin and lacked carbonation. Overall, this was a very, very average offering.","SilentSabre","Oct 09, 2006"
2.83,-21.2,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Got this on tap while waiting at the airport... Pours a medium amber color with orange tones. Had a one finger off white cap that dissipated to almost nothing, and leaving very slight lacings up sides of ""airport plastic cup"". Aroma is caramel, cloves, citrus, coriander, and hops. Flavor is a little watered down, but the light caramel malitness comes through with medium hop bitterness. Slight citrus undertones and a little spice and slight peppery-ness. Has a hoppy earthy aftertaste that doesn't quite agree. Body is light, with medium carbonation, and a little on the watery side.","jabocu","Jun 13, 2006"
2.86,-20.3,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"In some ways this beer, while average, is fairly decent and yet run-of-the-mill with warts this doesnt cut it with me. This isnt something Id want to drink again as there are much better similar products. Nevertheless, thanks timtheenchanta for the bottle.","bditty187","May 03, 2006"
3.15,-12.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"12 ounce brown bottle from a local brewer in Greenville, SC. Pours a hazy dark orange/amber color with a good sized head that quickly dissipates. Minimual lacing. Nice malty aroma with some spiceness (cinnamon?) in the background. Taste is sweet malt with a little spicy flavor and very little ho bitterness. Not a bad brew, just not one I would seek out. I prefer their amber ale over this one.","clemtig76","Mar 28, 2006"
3.48,-3.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"This beer pours a amber burnt-orange with an extreamly frothy offwhite head that leaves a bit of lacing and a little film all the way down. The smell is mostly malty with sweet aromas and the chararacteric malt smell that seems to come along with all thomas creek beers. The taste exhibits the same characteristics as the smell. This is mostly sweet malts with a bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel is well carbonated with a nice thickness. There is also a slight dryness associated with it. Overall, average on drinkability. That characteristic maltiness that seems to be consistent throughout all Thomas Creek beers just isn't to my liking","MSchae1017","Mar 12, 2006"

3.8,5.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nose is sweet malts, caramel. Tastes of sweet malt and caramel throughout, with hops pushing back to balance and leave just a bit of bitternes in the sweet finish. Mouth is full and modertately carbonated. Drinks rather easily, would be nice to have another tonight!","babydoc","Jul 09, 2005"
3.83,6.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This slightly hazy, deep-amber ale has a wonderful, creamy, off-white head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. It's malty and sweet in the nose with a hint of yeasty fruitiness. Thin streams of steadily rising bubbles reveal its moderate carbonation; and it's smooth and creamy in the mouth with a dextrinous, medium body. Sweetish, caramel and toffee-like malt dominates the flavor, which is laced with floral and delicately citrusy hops, and backed by a firm bitterness. A basic, approachable and drinkable beer!","NeroFiddled","Apr 29, 2005"

3.77,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle. Purchased at Total Wine in Charleston, SC. Add some additional bittering to the flavor to tip the balance toward bitter and this could be a real winner.","GCBrewingCo","Sep 20, 2004"
3.65,1.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Cloudy amber red in color. The head was hard to judge as I tasted this at a festival in a 2.5 oz shot glass. Immediately pick up sweet malt on the nose that dominates any other scent. The taste was clean, sweet malt with a very robust, lingering finish with average carbonation. I agree with the other reviewers in that this is much better that other American Reds. A great improvement over their Pilsner.","Loki","Apr 20, 2003"
3.03,-15.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Nice looking slightly hazy amber/red. Decent tan head. Aroma is similar to sweet wort with some faint, leafy hops. Flavor is predominately malt as it should be for the style, sweetish and biscuity. An easy going hop finish makes for a decent red. A good crossover brew for someone discovering better beer.","John","Dec 18, 2002"
