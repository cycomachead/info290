"Very nice red ale. I'll buy again."

"A nice smooth red ale.  Smoother and very so slightly sweeter than Killians.  I'll buy again."

"Not very good but who knows how well the restaurant maintains its tap lines.  I do give the Longhorn in Greenville credit for serving a local brew."

"Overall: Not the most tip top Irish Red I've had, but definitely a solid, traditional recipe. It just needs a little more polish and finesse. In its current state, especially with the diacetyl factor, it reminds me of an award winning homebrew ...in a small, regional competition."
"No idea how old this is, but it's a gusher. Took 5 minutes to see what color it was. It's amber with a billowing cream head. Aroma is metallic, with nutty notes and specialty malt fruitiness. Flavor is also metallic and nutty, with herbal hop notes. That metallic character dominates, though. Becomes phenolic as it warms."

"Color typical of the style; deep copper. Lingering, off-white head in the glass. Caramel malt in the nose, no hop presence. Good malt flavors mid-palate, with light English hop flavors and roasted malt well balanced. I'd say medium body but with crisp mouth feel and dry, light roasted and very smooth finish. Very easy drinker."

"Pours a clean orange-ish to reddish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a sweet caramel like malt. In the taste, sweet caramel malt, citrus notes, and a sweet to dry roast. A small hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry caramel and citrus aftertaste. Nice citrus hop and sweet caramel malt."

"Solid red ale, good meal beer"

"Taste is medium toasty malt upfront, citrus in the middle, with a clean close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. Liking this one."

"O- This beer needs MORE specialty grains. More crystal malt, more toasted and/or roasted grains. Not a horrible beer by any means but definitely one of the poorer examples of the style."

"Served from tap into a mug. Poured a deep red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, citrus, and subtle pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, citrus, citrus hop, caramel, and subtle pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing on this brew really stood out to me. While it was a decent brew from the style, it wasn't overly memorable. Worth trying if you haven't done so or if you see it on tap and want something a little lighter on the night."

"Pours a nice clear and slightly reddish amber with a thick and fine-bubbled, if not persistent, palest golden head. Aroma has yeasty, malty, pear and banana notes. Flavor is mainly malty and yeasty, and fruity undertone is largely banana and pear. Texture is smooth, average-bodied and fairly fizzy."
"Overall: Good drinkability here, the Red Ale does a fine job at just simply being a Red Ale. Though the label states the beer as being 6.2%, I'd prefer the 5-something listed here on the site, to keep things even more easily drinkable."
""
"Single finger head, lots of lacing on a clear amber/gold body. Nice head retention. Very nice sweet caramel malt aroma however not very strong. More sweet caramel malt with a minty notes throughout the experience. Mild typical red ale bitter finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall a very attractive beer with the mint note making this one enjoyable and rather unique. Not as drinkable as some reds however."

"This is kind of baffling. The aroma is weak and powerless. Tastes good at the start of each sip but totally falls apart by the finish. I wish that weren't the case; this beer is trying to be decent. As is, there's no need for me to finish the bottle."
"O-easy to drink not much to think about can use it to convert some friends definitely better from a glass rather than the bottle"
"Pours an amber color with a one finger head and some lace on the glass. The nose is of caramel malt and some fruitiness. The taste follows the nose a nice caramel malt backbone with a dark fruit sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is modearelty cabonated. Overall a solid amber not the best but certainly not the worst."
"Even though Thomas Creek considers River Falls Red Ale to be their 'flagship beer', it's more of a sturdy little tugboat. It would also be best if they took the tagline 'Sink The Status Quo' off the label, because this stuff is the very definition of the status quo."
"O If you a relatives that have no idea what a good beer is and you want to fool them into thinking you do then give them this. This should have a Coor's lable on it"
"O: Not a bad beer, but really wish the metal wasn't there. Would help the beer a lot if that aspect could be fixed."
"D - a pleasant red ale for sure, but too plain and subtle to generate much interest."
"D-Very crisp and refreshing. A nice example of a red ale. Easily a 2-3 pint beer. I enjoyed this beer very much."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly. I could easily drink a few of these in one night."
"The bartender told me it was one of his favorites, I thought it was good, but not a fave. Being called a red ale I thought there would be more red to it. More copper looking than amber. Very decent drinkability, I think a lot of people would enjoy this, but there was nothing special for me to point out."
"Coppery amber with a dense sand colored head. Toasted malt and subdued floral hop notes in the aroma. Sweet malt well balanced with mild herbal hoppiness. Flavors of toffee and candied orange peel with a mild breadiness and soft herbal hop bittering. Well balanced and spot on for the style. Medium bodied and smooth. An easy drinker and a nice example of the style."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, somewhat lighter amber color. There was a bit of a fizzy head on it that dropped off rather quickly. It leaves a little lacing. Lighter but decent nose. Some floral and toffee notes. The taste is OK. A little lighter in the body. Mildly bitter, with just a bit of caramel malt sweetness. Very faint roastiness. Decent enough, but nothing special."
"Right on target here, it's a style in which you don't want massive complexities clinging on the palate or flexed flavors bursting at the seams. Balanced and very drinkable--not a flaw showing."
"Not much body and that metallic tang continues into the aftertaste averting you from trying another. I left five of the bottles from the six-pack in the hotel."
"4.0 D: After looking at the average for this, I'm not quite sure why everyone hates it. It's a solid red ale that tastes more like a brown ale. I'd happily drink this again."
"Drinkability overall is pretty good. I can't get this beer in KY (picked up in Asheville, NC), but would buy again if the price was right."
"My Sam Adams Perfect Pint is a little disappointed, but I suspect a fresher offering would be worthwhile as a tailgate beer. You know, something that quenches ones thirst while lowering inhibitions, without feeling like a waste."
"Easy drinker, but just not worth the effort."
"Pours a glorious reddish copper color with a very thin, creamy head. The aroma is largely a very fruity, berry-like malt sweetness. The flavor is more balanced with a nice hop bitterness, but the sweet caramel malts are still a bit dominant, but not quite as fruity as the nose would suggest. Medium bodied, but it feels a bit thin because of a fine carbonation that is almost reminiscent of an adjunct-lager. By no means am I comparing this to a Killian's, though, as this one has a nice malt sweetness but is also fairly balanced, making it a good (but not great) beer."
"Overall impression: Not something I'd seek out necessarily, but a pretty solid offering."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a light amber with a 2 finger white head. The aroma is a bit grainy. It has a bready flavor to it, not real sweet, the finish is crisp. A medium bodied quaffer. IMO this is more of an amber ale, but overall a decent beer that is easy to drink."
"Drinkability: decent beer but it needed a bit more bitterness IMHO. The beer was easy to quaff."
"Seems that this beer was mishandled by the distributor or the storekeep. It's a shame because this is my first encounter with this brewery. It's not their fault and I'll try to find some more of this beer and their other offerings again and revisit."
"Pours with a solid head of cream colored head, pretty much runs down swiftly to a thin surface covering, lacing shows a bit more tenacity. Light copper red to orange color, complete transparency without seeming watery. The strength of the caramel and roasted coffee is out of balance with the whole, hence the nose is very dominated by the former, over time managing to offer honey oats, burning hay bales, stone moss and a thin slice of lemon. Medium-bodied, here the malts not as roasted, more so Nestle Quik powder, caramel and honey oat cereal. Carbonation fits the overall weight and flavor level. Hops akin to straw slowly lit by a match, one by one. No citrus notes. Finishes smoothly enough, doesn't lose much weight but didn't have much to begin with."
"This was a tasty, light and crisp session ale. I was a bit disappointed that it lacked the toasted malt character found in most examples of this style. Nevertheless, it was definitely worth a try."
"Label on the bottle says ""River Falls Red Ale"". Pours a mostly clear, copper/orange body with a medium beige head. Good retention and plenty of patchy lacing on the glass. Restrained aroma has hints of toasted caramel and vague hops. Light medium body has medium carbonation. Taste is malty, mostly caramel, but not overly sweet. Hop bitterness is restrained but balances well. A nice red ale that goes down well. Unassuming, but nicely put together with no obvious flaws."
"Drinkability: Not bad a bit better than average."
"Drinkability - better with food than by itself, this could be sessionable (more likely on tap) but I'll need an appetite to work with."
"D: I didn't find this one particularly drinkable. The taste wasn't complex and was fairly uninteresting."
"More bitter than usual for style. Not something I'll be going back to."
"Biscuity and doughy malts in the aroma, which morphs a bit into a woody and toasted nuts taste. Nice. Dry and crisp finish, if in South Carolina Id say go for a sixer anytime. I was bumming I only had one."
"Poured a nice hazyorange, with no head and some decent lacing. Nice streams of carbonation coming from th botom of the glass. Smell was light, grainy with a hint of sweetness. The taste really caught me off guard. Came off vey sour. Hints of grapes and pears, more complex then I thought. Very light and well carbonated, and goes down very smooth. Overall tis wasalot more of a beer then I thought it was going to be. Seems like they have done a bit of exploring with this. Very complex and a good drinker."
"Pours a reddish orange with only a lacy head around the edges of the glass. Smell is sugary and dry malts, and marmalade, some hops in the background. It smells thicker than it tastes, not much of a hop presence outside of the smell though. The mouthfeel is sturdy at first, but not much after that. It doesn't hold up over time. A decent beer, but there are a lot better red ales out there."
"Seems like they're on the right track but they need to change something somewhere in the process or ingredients to make this highly quaffable. Glad I only sprang for a single."
"I get the feeling that Thomas Creek didnt set out to redefine the style with this beer, but rather settled on something very average and safe. This isnt a bad beer, but its got little to help it stand out from the pack, either. I do like the fact that its brewed in my state, folks in SC need all the help they can get."
"Smell was sweet malts. Period. In fact, this reminded me of a breakfast cereal. Taste was a bit bitter up front with some dry malt on the finish. Mouthfeel was very thin and lacked carbonation. Overall, this was a very, very average offering."
"Got this on tap while waiting at the airport... Pours a medium amber color with orange tones. Had a one finger off white cap that dissipated to almost nothing, and leaving very slight lacings up sides of ""airport plastic cup"". Aroma is caramel, cloves, citrus, coriander, and hops. Flavor is a little watered down, but the light caramel malitness comes through with medium hop bitterness. Slight citrus undertones and a little spice and slight peppery-ness. Has a hoppy earthy aftertaste that doesn't quite agree. Body is light, with medium carbonation, and a little on the watery side."
"In some ways this beer, while average, is fairly decent and yet run-of-the-mill with warts this doesnt cut it with me. This isnt something Id want to drink again as there are much better similar products. Nevertheless, thanks timtheenchanta for the bottle."
"12 ounce brown bottle from a local brewer in Greenville, SC. Pours a hazy dark orange/amber color with a good sized head that quickly dissipates. Minimual lacing. Nice malty aroma with some spiceness (cinnamon?) in the background. Taste is sweet malt with a little spicy flavor and very little ho bitterness. Not a bad brew, just not one I would seek out. I prefer their amber ale over this one."
"This beer pours a amber burnt-orange with an extreamly frothy offwhite head that leaves a bit of lacing and a little film all the way down. The smell is mostly malty with sweet aromas and the chararacteric malt smell that seems to come along with all thomas creek beers. The taste exhibits the same characteristics as the smell. This is mostly sweet malts with a bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel is well carbonated with a nice thickness. There is also a slight dryness associated with it. Overall, average on drinkability. That characteristic maltiness that seems to be consistent throughout all Thomas Creek beers just isn't to my liking"
"-UF"
"Nose is sweet malts, caramel. Tastes of sweet malt and caramel throughout, with hops pushing back to balance and leave just a bit of bitternes in the sweet finish. Mouth is full and modertately carbonated. Drinks rather easily, would be nice to have another tonight!"
"This slightly hazy, deep-amber ale has a wonderful, creamy, off-white head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. It's malty and sweet in the nose with a hint of yeasty fruitiness. Thin streams of steadily rising bubbles reveal its moderate carbonation; and it's smooth and creamy in the mouth with a dextrinous, medium body. Sweetish, caramel and toffee-like malt dominates the flavor, which is laced with floral and delicately citrusy hops, and backed by a firm bitterness. A basic, approachable and drinkable beer!"
"Not a bad amber, certainly there are better out there, but I could drink a few of these pretty easily."
"Drinkability: Pleasant drinker; a decent example of a style that I rarely seek out"
"12 ounce bottle. Purchased at Total Wine in Charleston, SC. Add some additional bittering to the flavor to tip the balance toward bitter and this could be a real winner."
"Cloudy amber red in color. The head was hard to judge as I tasted this at a festival in a 2.5 oz shot glass. Immediately pick up sweet malt on the nose that dominates any other scent. The taste was clean, sweet malt with a very robust, lingering finish with average carbonation. I agree with the other reviewers in that this is much better that other American Reds. A great improvement over their Pilsner."
"Nice looking slightly hazy amber/red. Decent tan head. Aroma is similar to sweet wort with some faint, leafy hops. Flavor is predominately malt as it should be for the style, sweetish and biscuity. An easy going hop finish makes for a decent red. A good crossover brew for someone discovering better beer."
