"Saranac Red Ale is unbearable (at least on my palate). It's bitter and tastes like the inside of a cologne bottle. This is seemingly what some beer advocates like; the more bitter and unbearable the tastier it is? I don't get it. Maybe it's like cheese; the stinkier and more bitter the higher the review scores? That said, if you are a regular beer drinker like I am (I drink all different kinds of beers), then you most likely will cringe at the taste of the Red Ale. It's not a beer to drink in your Adirondack Chair; it's a beer to drink when you're already wasted from a few Landshark Lagers."

"This beer is a go to for me for the fall. I don't know why Saranac doesn't make this a stand alone seasonal. The flavor is full and smooth. It had a very clean finish which is to be expected from Saranac. One of my favorites. Very malty. Hops don't really come through which is fine. Overall one of the best Irish reds out there."

"Pours a copper with two fingers of off-white head that quickly dissipated. The nose is lightly bready. There is some notes of caramel malt present in the flavor profile, but the taste is not very bold. There is a pleasant hoppy finish. This is a well-balanced red that is sessionable, but not terribly memorable."

"Overall - A fine beer but it misses the mark compared to other Saranac brews"
"Copper amber color with decent head and moderate carbonation. Hoppy, sweet, caramel aroma. Malty flavor. Flavors are very well integrated and balanced. Slight spice flavor and the floral hop flavor also comes through. Finishes a bit drier than it starts. Could be a bit sweeter."

"A solid red ale that is worth a session for a get together. Would please craft brew novices, but may lack the depth that some craft beer nerds (myself included) look for. Pretty good brew."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, light, copper-auburn coloring with a filmy coating of off-white head clinging to the surface. Aromas of roasty caramel and toffee malts that are rich, but balanced. Flavors are smokey and roasted initially, with a sweet, rich caramel backbone that is both tangy and slightly bitter. Sweet, buttery and caramel tangy aftertaste that leads to a slick, sweet, and slightly cloying finish. Not bad for the style, but overly sweet for my tastes. A bit more balance would make this one a great go-to for an Irish Red."

"O- Decent beer. Suffers a bit from too much sweetness."
"I can't think of anything nice to say about this, other than it is one of the many beers I would grudgingly prefer over Abita's Jockamo suckfest."
""
""
"Taste is really creamy sweet caramel malts. Its smooth and easy drinker. Nice session brew, and really not a bad Irish red. There isnt much wow factor but its solid and drinkable...sometimes thats all you need."
"Not bad but not recommended."
""
""
"Aroma was pretty good. Would have liked a little more ummpgh in the flavor department. Nothing bad but nothing too exciting. I would definitely drink this again."
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad Irish Red...very easy drinking and clean...nice sweet flavors with a bit of earhtiness to the beer"
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and an average representation of the style."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 9 oz glass. Pours a reddish amber color with a light brown head that dissipates quickly but leaves nice lacing. Smells of dark roasted malt and a small bit of floral hops. Tastes of roasted malt, but does not have the hop tone that the smell gave off, as is expected in this type of beer. This beer has a great finish, but seems to have a little bit too much carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
"O: A pleasant surprise. Easy to recommend, particularly as a rather inexpensive brew."
""
"Not bad, esp. for game day."
""

""
"Not my favorite of ""What Ales You"" mixed twelve pack, but a decent if kinda boring and not all that tasty red ale. Price point is the only notable feature of this one."
"O: tastes nice enough, i would be happy to see this in a six pack as i dont really love a few of the other offerings in the what ales you mix pack"
""
""
"An average ale from a below average style. Lightly sweet but more dry and oddly bitter."
""
"Moderate one finger plus head of light tan coloration, evaporates too quickly to really dimple, mostly smaller bubbles, the lacing appears a thin sheet which drifts quickly down the side of the glass. Copperish color to the liquid, very clear with a horde of loose bubbles rising inside, more bright orange around the rims. Pralines, candied nuts, brown sugar, molasses, kind of grapey with date, fig, banana aspects, does have a bit more grains and hoppiness than expected, gives it better posture in the nostrils. Light-bodied, would likely feel flat were it not for the quite aggressive carbonation which keeps it sloshing around the mouth. Here you get a light metallic aspect along with quinine and more indistinct herbaceousness. Not as sweet as the nose would suggest, however, you do get caramel, cane sugar, molasses, bubblegum notes along with Challah bread. The fig, apple, pear fruit basic enough, supplemented by some orange peel. The nuttiness helps flesh out the finish. All in all, not bad for what it is but not something I’d seek out per se."
""
"O- A drinkable Irish Red Ale, but could really use a bigger body to give it more depth. Nothing special and would only drink again if not much else."
""
"Overall - A fine beer by Saranac. I haven't had many of this style so I'm not to fond of the dry finish, but the flavors are pleasant and its quite sessionable."
""
"Overall – This is quite a nice brew. Very flavorful and drinkable."

"Pours a clear, deep copper. Lots of slow carbonation. Off-white film. Smell is equal parts mineral & toasted malts. Taste starts off bitter, morphing into semi-sweet crystal malts and finishing sort of nuttty and tannic. Feel is flat & smooth. Decent."
"I've only been able to find one 6 pack of this beer and it was well worth it. One of the best Irish Red Ale's I've had that didn't break your wallet, but now I can't seem to find it anywhere. Compared to Sam Adam's or O'hara's, it is hard to beat based on price and taste. Another quality beer from Saranac!"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was kinda amber colored and poured a decent off white head. The beer had a nice toffee smell that Was also in the taste. This is one of those beers that does not knock your socks off but is a good all around beer. I will buy again."
"Not bad. Overall, well rounded and smooth. Not a bad take on the style."
"This was an ok beer. I have yet to find an Irish Red that is real impressive. I guess this was on par with typical Saranac offerings – very drinkable and nothing too extreme."
"Pours a clear copper red, with deep white foamy head that dissipates quickly.No lacing of the glass. No aroma to speak of. Taste is excellent, caramel malt with the lightest touch of hops to balance. One of this brewery's better offerings!"
"From the 12 beers a fallin' variety pack poured into my Geordie Schooner. Definitely a red brew with a medium head. Malt dominates the aroma, quite pleasantly. This reminds me of a Killian's only better. This was easy drinking and quite mild. Not super complex (actually no complexity). A sold basic red."
"Overall: I enjoyed it out of the 12 Beers A Fallen pack during a football game. :)"
"O- Eh, I've had better and probably won't go searching this one out again."
"This beer poured out with a nice looking red color with a light cream colored head on top that fizzled away quickly. The smell of the beer was malty, had some light grainy aromas and some hops also. The taste of the beer had a pretty good balance of sweet and bitter to it. The mouthfeel was drinkable and went down pretty easily. Overall this brew wasn't too bad. I wouldn't say I'd buy a case but if it was offered to me I'd drink it again for sure."
"O - Not a bad beer at all, just nothing worth seeking out (it came as part of the fall variety pack). A little more hoppiness and it would have some legs."
"My pour left me with two dense fingers of tawny head with decent retention. Color was a deep coppery-red (with NE-quality clarity) that makes me think of former G/Fs and women with that natural hair color that speaks to the reptilian/neanderthal part of my brain. Goo. Bup. Nose was much hoppier than I anticipated and now I cannot tell you whether that is good or bad. I like hops, sure, but necessarily in my IPAs. Mouthfeel was full and creamy and I got hops initially on the tongue, but quickly followed by a biscuit maltiness. Finish was more malty than hoppy, so it all worked out in the end."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a amberish brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit on the malty side. Taste is malty, a touch of caramel, just a bit of hops are present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"Picked up a six pack of this one at Logan Liquors today, simply because of the great price. Poured a dark copper color with a generous light brown head. Aromas of caramel, toasted malt and toffee. Medium bodied and sweet, with toasted malt and caramel."
"O-Like most everything from Saranac it is ehh. However I prefer this Red Ale to Sam Adams. With a choice between the two go with this one."
"D: This is a nice & balanced IRA. Caramel/toffee without too much sweetness. Toasty dryness without much darkly toast flavors. Nicely to style and appropriately with balancing hops. Appropriate heft and strength. Well made and nicely drinkable."
"O - This is a pretty nice Irish-style red ale. It would make a nice session ale."
"This was a nice little session red that I enjoyed tremendously. Nice light amber pours with a huge head of white that came up a full three fingers in height. Smooth settling left a good bit of side glass lace and a nice and even coating across the top of the glass. Interesting aroma as it started out with a nice and well rounded bready malt that seemed to slowly evolve into a grassy, herbal hop profile with a bit of a kick from the caramel. Did not seem to have a clear direction, but the taste made up for it nicely. Very smooth, nice caramel and malty tones that won me over with ease. Smooth even flavor, crisp, clean and well balanced. Smooth notes of grassy bittering hops coming in at the finish gave it a nice little drying effect and warmed it up. Very drinkable as it went down smooth and left me looking for more right away."
"Appearace is dark amber red, almost brown. Nice thick creamy head with slightly above-average retention. Nose is sweet and more sweet. Caramel and sugar flavors take center stage, with some secondary candied apple. Light bodied and low carbonation makes for a very drinkable ale. Overall, a pretty good showing in a generally unremarkable class."
"D - Very drinkable. Very smooth but also fairly simple. There is not too much flavor really going on and it could have used a bit more here or there. Still a refreshing and crisp beer though."
"O- Overall, and good cheap Irish Red Ale."
"This is an OK beer overall. The low ABV and light body make it an easy drinker."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very low on the carbonation, which is the only major downside to this brew. Overall a decent beer to find on tap at a bar amongst the macro rubbish."
"D: Very drinkable, a good St. Patrick's day session ale."
"D- This was a completely underwhelming Irish Red. Didn't particularly care for it, and not a good representation of the style."
"The feel of the beer is light and has a smooth feel going down that was a bit sweeter then expected. It has a nice drinkable feel as well and goes down easy."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of the ""What Ales You"" mixed 12pk. Pours a crystal-clear deep copper color with a half inch of off-white head. Biscuitty malt with slight herbal hops in the aroma, but you really have to look for it. Sweet bready malt with caramel notes and a hint of herbal hops. Medium in body and carbonation. Tasty, balanced, and quaffable. Not a bad beer."
"Taste-Faint toasted malt, artificial tasting caramel, sweetish and watery, a bit of a metallic finish. A bit of a dissapointment. Certainly much better Irish reds to be had out there."
"Easy to drink but not very inviting"
"Drinkability is very high. Much like the other Saranacs this one can be thrown back with ease time and time again."
"While this one isn't stellar and could use more depth, it's a solid representation of the style and quite drinkable."
"Taste- Hops come through about mid palate, I get the traditional Irish Red taste, but something seems off balance. Mouthfeel is pretty good, drinkability is about average; The hops seem a little off."
"From 12 ounce bottle (bought a 6 beers variety pack). Pours a mahogany color with a nice tall lacy head. Too dark for Irish Red. Aroma is sweet caramel malts. Body is thing but crisp. Flavor of sweet caramel malt in the beginning with barely noticeable earthy hops in the finish. Boring, characterless brew."
"Not a bad beer but not a good one either. Ill pass."
"Beer paired with a stuffed pepper. Poured into standard American pint glass right from the fridge, pours a deep copper with touch of red, 1-finger head, average head retention and lacing. Aroma and taste actually come out with the same notes and levels of toasted malts, slight caramel and slight toffee. There isn't much more to say, other than this beer is extremely drinkable and smooth. It does not numb the palate, nor overpower the taste buds. This is top-shelf stuff for a cheap 4.5% beer (believe it), and I would happily stuff my fridge full of these for relaxing days if I wasn't so into tasting and reviewing all kinds of other beers. BUY THIS BEER."
"D: Flavorful and smooth. Easily drinkable even though the crystal malt was pretty dominating."
"Drinkability: This would go well as an easy-going session brew, or with some bangers and mash, but as far as a version you'll admire, it really doesn't strike that kind of chord."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Pours a translucent copper with a loose, half inch, tan-colored head that quickly disperses into a tight, bubbly band around the edges - no lacing on this one. Nose is almost non-existent but suggests a light, malty body (perhaps caramel malt) and a slightly metallic quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, a slightly skunky quality is expressed towards the middle and the metallic character resurfaces at the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a lively, assertive (almost prickly) carbonation and some astringency. It's definitely drinkable, but really not all that impressive. A swing and a miss - no need to try this one again."
"This is a typical Red through and through it poured deep red in color is has a very nice color but absolutely no head remains after a few seconds much like a soda. The aroma is of malt and grains but nothing distinctive. The tastes begins sweets and as the carbonation builds it drys and leaves a grain taste on the tongue. For the price its drink increases but overall doesn't stand out."
"The taste is actually pretty good, some caramel, toffee, malt. A prickly mouthfeel, very refreshing and drinkable. A good all around beer, yet not extraordinary. I would drink it again."
"Not much to this beer, even though I have not had much in the style. And yes, I do have Irish in me, but I'll pass on this from now on."
"D. I could put a sixxer of this away without a problem at a party. Not an extrodinary beer but an average red ale that I wouldn't look past at the store."
"Pretty decent beer. Not my favorite Irish Red Ale but I would definitely consider getting it again. It came in te fall seasonal variety pack for Saranac. It's a pretty well made fall beer."
"Good sipper, not much to dislike about it. Would be easy to session but not quite great."
"D: A bit on the tame side but good for a couple."
"D: Good drinkable beer and sad by the seasonal status."
"All in all, this wasn't half bad. I see this best as a beer to enjoy along with a meat pie, burger or simple grilled chicken sandwich and some fries."
"Drinkability: Doesn't taste good enough to warrant many more"
"Side note: I went to see Umphrey's Mcgee this summer at the Saranac Brewery and in between sets they were giving out free Irish Red."
"Saranac Irish Red Ale fits into the TMBC lineup pretty much where I though it would. For those upstate New Yorkers looking to drink locally and save a few bucks, have at it. For anyone looking for an enjoyable Irish red... keep looking."
"Smooth and drinkable as a session beer, good for a St. Patty's day celebration."
"This beer had a medium creamy tan head with a very dark red body. The smell didn't have much of a hop aroma. I was picking up a slight yeast smell, but also toffee. This beer is lightly carbonated witch fits well with soft undertone of Carmel and toffee. I believe the toffee is however more noticeable. The beer seems like a light Irish RED or watery to me. I was expecting this beer to be bolder. This Irish Red is drinkable, but not something I will buy again."
"Overall this is a pretty basic irish red, nothing really stands out from this beer but for 3.99 a six pack I might find myself drinking it again since it has some flavor to it."
"Clear amber with a creamy tan head that leaves some fine lace on the glass. Caramel and roasty malty aroma with a touch of floral hop. Sweet and malty upfront with some minty hop bittering in the finish. Medium light bodied with plenty of carbonation. This is one of the better examples of the style IMO. It won't blow your mind but would any Irish red?"
"D - A very enjoyable and sessionable irish red. Not overly sweet which serves to enhance the drinkability. A nice example of the style."
"Comments: Overall, this beer presents some good attributes, but other key components seem to be missing."
"Appearance is a medium/dark red. Smell is slight nuttiness and alcohol. I taste sweet maltiness with some sweet cereal, with a dry finish. There is a good amount of carbonation, but it is really thin. Drinkability is good, not the most delicious beer, but very easy drinking."
"Notes: Overall it's not bad but to me, it is rather simple and light."
"Poured to a red-amber color. From my vigorous pour I received a thick, tall head which dwindled quickly but stuck around from there on. Sweet malt on the nose. Sweet flavor as well. Hints of sweet caramel. Develops into a light hoppy bittterness in the finish. This was an average beer for me. Nothing really stood out for me. It wasn't bland. Just a sweet beer with no real strong flavor. Probably won't get this one again."
"Pours a decent mid-red color, with just a bit of initial head and no lacing. Clean malty scent, but that's about it for the aroma. Decent clean malty flavor, as well, but without much of anything else; did not have that nice extra sourness red ales from Ireland have. Goes down smooth. Not a great beer, but a drinkable one. I'll not buy another six pack but I wouldn't turn down a free one."
"D - Not a bad red ale. There were a lot of coarse characteristics (carbonation, saturated malt) that blanketed a lot of potential features. It's worth a try though."
"D- This was one of my first stabs at Saranac and don't know how I feel about it. It is a step above BMC but not by much. Will try others from the brewery but don't know if this is one I will revisit."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable - goes down easy and quickly and went nicely with a simple fish meal. There are other Irish reds out there I enjoy more though. Still, if it was available, I'd take it."
"One of my favorite style....love the malt!"
"D: OK. At least it's light, has some flavor to it. Not one I'd get again, however."
"D: Nothing wrong with this beer at all and IMO one of Saranacs best made beers!"
"pours an bright amber with nice intricate lacing. smells of toasty malts...nothing spectacular, but fresh. full-bodied mouthfeel allows the tang of hops to accent, but allow the malt character to remain stage center. not bad at all. much better than Killian's....a bit dry, not one-dimensional, but not 3 or 4 either...good for quaffing something that has flavor."
"Drinkability: This is a great low abv session beer. Perfect for St. patties day and will make an appearance in place of Killians any day of the week! Great effort and sessionability."
"Pours a copper, amber, red color with a strong and sticky, foamy off white head. Caramel malt sweetness, a strange piney wintergreen note, and a strong musty, bready yeast aroma. Simple and pretty well balanced, no detectable flaws, crisp and highly carbonated. Very easy to drink, had 2 yesterday with a spicy chicken breast sandwich, dead on. Strong effort here from Saranac."
"Pours a nice amber red. Sweet caramel smell. Tastes of caramel and toffee, and maple syrup. Feels mildly smooth in your mouth. It's a good beer for drinking while eating food. The mild bitterness contrasts hearty meals very well. Not much foam when poured which is nice indeed. Overall a good beer."
"Pours a clear bright burnt umber with a half-finger of ecru head that diminishes quickly and leaves a miniscule amount of transitory lacing behind. The smell is of figs, dark malts, molasses, brown sugar, and citrus. The taste emphasizes the sweet malts and adds a bite of spice and a healthy but not overwhelming dose of hoppy pine and bitterness. The body is a solid moderate and runs smoothly over the tongue, but the high carbonation detracts slightly. Overall, a tasty and drinkable brew indeed."
"Overall, this is a bland thin irish red that I would not return to."
"Easy enough to drink. Sweet touch, but not too sweet. A thin, mild interpretation of the style."
"A very good example of an Irish Red Ale."
"Cheers"
"Saranac Irish Red is a fairly drinkability, enjoyable beer. A lot of beers around here have Saranac or macros to choose from, so I will always be happy to see this Irish Red on tap."
"Drinkability- A veritably drinkable beer on the upper echelon of being mediocre, defiantly worth a try."
"Goes down easy, nothing off. Very drinkable, just not overly exciting."
"I decided to try this ale after hearing some good things about it. I am quite impressed with it, overall. It certainly isn't earth shattering, but is a very enjoyable drink. It produces an off white head that, unfortunately, dissipates fairly quickly and leaves only a small amount of lacing. The color is an inviting and rich amber/red. It smells very pleasant ans mildly sweet. The mouthfeel is ""average", fairly smooth and slightly heavy. The balance of malts and hops is very well executed creating a very satisfying experience from the start to finish of each sip. As the beer warms it does take on a slightly more malty taste. The aftertaste is also malty and lingering (in a good way). It is a very solid ale that is certainly worth trying."
"The mouth feel is medium bodied. With good drinkability."
"Overall a decent ale."
"D: One could session this red at 4.5% ABV, and with a pleasant-enough malt flavor and chuggable finish, it could score high amongst non-discriminating red ale fans. A forgettable option, but worth a shot if you're a Killian's drinker looking for a possibly more economic solution."
"This bottle was a gift from a friend. The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a reasonable off-white head. The beer is reasonably clear, and the reddish color is moderately intense. The aroma is quite good...nice bread-crust and lightly roasted, crystal and caramel up front. This is backed with a little herbal hop flavor, but the malt dominates. The taste is initially sweet, with a continuation of the toasted-bread theme. Hop bitterness is pronounced in the finish. The taste has a metallic characteristic that's not fantastic, but is also not overly distracting. rinkable, but maybe a bit heaftier than necessary. Reasonably good overall."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a glass mug. The beer is a brown/ruby color and has a significant amount of head, made of small tan bubbles. The aroma is a good mixture of pine and herbal hops and toffee malts. The flavor seems to taste strongly of toast; I imagine the yeast ued to brew the beer has imparted itself to the flavor. There is also a hint of bitterness form the hops. It has a medium body and noticeable carbonation. It can be felt on your tongue as you swallow. This is a pretty drinkable beer. It isn't exceptional, so I would be tempted to order something else after the first round, but I certainly wouldn't complain if I was faced with a six pack."
"A beer of ideal strength for sessions. Has enough flavor to keep it interesting and is certainly very forward in the malt dept."
"Served in a pint glass. Pours a clear dark amber red with a thin tan head that disappears. Aroma is bready malty and sweet. Flavor is mild, smooth, sweet, malty with a bit of carmel. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is pleasant. Easy drinking, but nothing to write home about."
"pours a medium brown or dark copper, short head leaving rings of lace with each sip. weak caramel nose. taste is sweet malt with a light caramel otherwise a little bland. mouthfeel is light and good carbonation. basic red ale nothing that grabs your taste buds and says this is really great."
"Pours a four finger cream head that fades fairly quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear garnet color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Flavor is light caramel with the hops balancing. $1.55 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"A nice-looking beer. In a pint glass, it was a cherry amber color with a thick off-white head and a bit of lacing. Aroma a little bland, just some sweetness. Better taste, like a caramel apple. A little on the tart side. I found it to be refreshing, and would drink it again."
"Drinkability: Pretty damned good. It's mainstream, but it still has some nice malt and hop character; and it's really nicely rounded and balanced. It's not the best Irish amber I've ever had, but it certainly hits the mark for the style. Surprisingly good. A great backyard BBQ beer!"
"drinkability - Nice tastey beer that wasn't that bad. Easy drinking beer."
"D. A real good red ale I will have some more of these as they have just been released for the fall."
"M/D - decent carbonation with a slightly bitter finish, nothing to exciting with this one and I don't know if I'd have it again"
"Comments: Definitely the most bland out of the ""What Ales You?"" pack. I'd have this as a third or fourth beer in the evening, when you're not so much drinking for the taste as the enjoyment. Goes down easy; not bad, just not that good either."
"There's not much going on here and thus not much to comment upon either. It pours a reddish amber color with a decent slightly creamy off white head. Some retention and lacing going on too. The nose is sweet crystal malts and the taste follows suit. There is a roasted graininess and a slightly pricklish mouthfeel. It is a sweet malt, pretty low carbonation, not much else other than it is eminently drinkable and a decent beer that is none too complex."
"This is a good enough beer to drink more than one."
"This is an okay Irish Red, maybe a little light on the flavor."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Extremely fizzy and thin, the most macro-esque in terms of texture of the entire lot. The bubbles, though tiny, remain quite discernable the entire time, never easing up and becoming more smooth. This factor, more than anything, sinks the drinkability score."
"D= very drinkable for most occasions and in-session."
"This is a pretty good Irish Red. Nothing spectacular but a solid and easy drinking brew."
"Kind of bitter/sour. Easy to drink, mild body...but lacks any real style to it. Out of Saranac offerings, I would put this on the lower end. It was too dry and lacked that malt kick that kind of came through wit the scent. Above average."
"Sweet sugary toffee notes--as the label declares--and buttery popcorn (?) softens the nostrils... handsome clear amber red body with thin, white head that embraces the pint glass... medium-bodied, effervescent--balanced around the mouth and tongue... a bit of roasted malt and sweet candied sugars produce a rather flavorful, American-style ale...not much difference betwen this ""Irish"" ale and the average American ""amber""--mellow, compatible with many dishes, and easy drinking enough to pound--clever marketing for the St. Patty's Day rush? A nice surprise in the Saranac ""What Ales You?"" 12-pack..."
"bottle from a mix pack. Pours a red brown with little head. No real aromas, thin palate with little fruits. A little spice, maybe cinnamon towards the finish. Really average with what saranac puts out. I could drink another, but I have better options."
"D: Really hate to hit a beer when its down but came off as a very boring and bland drink deprived off body and flavor. Undistinguishable, unmemorable and cant honestly cant recommend. Easy enough to down but certainly lacks any incentive to do so."
"It is smooth and easy drinking. Not complex, and not a great beer... but, again, a real good one"
"This beer poured copper with reddish highlights and a thin head. The smell is pretty subtle, just a tiny bit of malt and yeast. The taste starts off with a bit of caramel malt and that's about it. Not unpleasant, but incredibly one-note. The mouthfeel is a bit watery but there's enough carbonation to keep it crisp. I can't help thinking that this beer may have been made specifically to drink in large quantities on a certain March Holiday."
"Give it a shot."
"Not a very distinctive beer, but Irish Red isn't really much of a style. Probably too bitter and insufficiently malty - not unpleasant to drink, but nothing exceptional about it."
"(D) A decent brew, but not stand out."
"Final Thoughts - My current favorite of the mass produced Irish reds. Definitely pick up the mix pack and give it a go."
"Note - There was a distinctive fizzy sound to the beer until the head settled..."
"Like most Saranac products - good, pleasant, but not great."
"The initial taste is fresh and shows a surprising hint of hoops and plenty of carbonation. Shortly after, the malt kicks in and unfortunately, so does the metal. The aftertaste is refreshing at first but ultimately turns gritty. This is a reasonably decent interpretation of the style but not overly inspiring. Typical Saranac, really."
" Oh well, you can't dig 'em all."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, might not be the best Irish Red out there but it's a solid beer that is worth drinking for an evening."
"The appearance is a translucent deep ruby red with virtually no head. Malts are the key aspet of the aroma followed by something sweet. Medium mouthfeel. The malts were not as evident in the flavor as that of an overripe fruit, weak hops and a dry finish. Adequate."
"D- Drinkable only because it's so bland and watery. This brew is a dud..."
"I may have been a little overly harsh with my review, but the fact remains: there was nothing for me here. Most underwhelming micro breweries, including this one, make beers that are definitely drinkable, beers that I probably would have enjoyed a few years ago. As things stand now, however, I'll probably pass."
"Overall this is close to being a really good beer, but if you haven't learned already, I thought it was too sweet."
"Overall a good beer. Definitely one of the better beer claiming to be an Irish Red - whatever that means...."
"Nice deep amber to red in the glass; decent head with some lacing. Malt (lightly roasted) in the nose and in the initial taste. Little hops flavor, though the hint of bitterness helps balance the beer nicely. Great body, perfect carbonation and a nice dry finish make it easy drinking. Enjoyed it a lot. Another winner from Saranac. Happy St. Patty's Day."
"pours a clear deep reddish-brown color w/ a thin off-whitehead which rapidly dissipates leaving a decent lacing in my nonic ; a rather weak smell, some steely, caramelish grain with hints of toasted nuts and a very faint dark fruit presence as it warmed ; taste is very similar to smell, but with a bit more nutty flavor w/ a bvery well-balanced hop-malt flavor, a slightly tart,yet crisp finish ; a light body, dry and very well carbonated ; a very drinkable brew, and much better than most irish reds available.."
"Overall- Not bad at all. I would by a 6er of this for a poker night."
"Poured with very little head that dissipated immediately. Has the reddish color I was expecting. Nothing too impressive on the nose; maybe some graininess and some strange sourness as well. Things don't get any better when I take a drink. Some initial sweetness and a tiny bit of bitterness, and then nothing. VERY thin, OK carbonation and a lingering graininess that isn't too pleasant. I live in NY and try and support my local brewers, but this beer isn't very good"
"Kinda like training wheels in craft brew, Saranac is great for getting beer drinkers ready for more complex and diverse beer styles. However they tend to keep it pretty safe, which isn't a bad thing. Appears a traditional deep caramel red hue with light beige head forming nicely above the rim of the glass. The head retention is decent and comes complete with minimal scattered lacing. Smell of this brew carries mild metallic qualities witha mineral water like quality. The cereal grains amongst the party carries caramel and biscuity wheaties notes with a touch of herbal hop in the finish. Flavor is mild slightly tart and metallic with a touch of acidity amongs a sweet rolling malt profile. Mouthfeel is light bodied a tad heavier than most michelob ""craft"" styles. Drinkability overall is solid something I would buy due to affordability and quaffabillity definitely falls in the session beer category all adorned with an Irish flag on the six pack holder."
"Seeing that this was new I decided to pick up a 6 pack. The brew pours to a nice copper color with a thick off white head that has good retention and has left a nice amount of lacing. The aroma is malt, slight caramel and sweet along with a aroma that seems to come with a majority of Saranac brews, must be from their yeast strand. The flavor is very similar to the aroma, caramel though you do get a toffee note. Besides what was mentioned I am not picking up much more. This is a fair brew from Saranac, good for the price. The one thing that I notice is that I get a lot of the same aromas and flavors from a wide variety of their brews."
"Pours a clear copper with a redish hue. Fluffy white head with excellent and laceing. Body is thin and carbonated. Aroma is of sweet malts. Nice but on the weak side. Taste is a mix of sweet malts and fruits. Little bit of spice in the finish. Nice!!"
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted scent that boasts of pale and roasted malts. There is a mild hop bitterness as well. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry, crisp flavor that boasts of pale and roasted malts. It's pretty straight forward with a touch of hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinker that pretty close in style. That said, it's not a very interesting beer, but nothing Saranac brews is."
"D - at 4.5% abv it would be pretty easy to session this beer."
"On-tap at Clark's Ale House in Syracuse. Appears a clear orange in my pint glass with an off white head that quickly disappears. This beer is not big on aroma or flavor, but I could drink the hell out of it. All of a sudden I looked down and my glass was half empty. Now I wouldn't call it bland, the flavors are just more subtle than most craft beers. There's a mellow caramel and white bread taste with a hint of spicy hops at the end. I guess this is more a local competitor to Killians - I pick this every time."
"Pours a clear deep copper hue with a soft two finger off-white head that falls to a thin layer which lasts throughout. Nice thick lacing sticks on the sides of the glass. Aroma is heavy on the malts with bread and muted hops. Caramel and crystal malts with some toasted grains as well. Taste starts with some nutty flavors and sweet caramel followed by a slight metallic sting. Midway, watered down dark fruits and chewy grains emerge. Pale malts and dry earth in the aftertaste, better than Killian's, but still lacking on the tongue. Pretty creamy light to medium body with a mild carbonation. This is a session beer that I would have no problem enjoying on St. Patty's day. Hopefully it'll be an option on tap in bars around here come March. At $6 a six-pack, you can't go wrong."
"Drinkability: Sessionable and light enough not to be too overwhelming. This roughtly reminds me of a homebrew American-style Amber Ale I've made, in the Fat Tire style."
"Mouthfeel, while usually my biggest complaint when drinking Saranac, is pretty appropriate for the style. Not too much of a soda-like consistency like with other beers (although I am drining this beer at room temperature while all my other Saranac reviews have been of cold beers). Mostly a medium body that molds well with the hop bitterness and crystal malt flavor. I'm enjoying drinking it. It's not a half bad Irish Red and I'd like to order up a couple of these for my friends on tap if I ever see it."
"Saranac Irish Red Ale is a very clear amber ale with a small off-white head that fades. It has a malty, grassy, slightly sweet, fresh aroma. It's pretty light bodied and very carbonated. It's simple and crisp. It's pretty nicely balanced-- starts a tiny bit sweet, but the finish is dry. This is squarely a session ale."
"Let's see, smooth and easy to drink. Obviously a decent session ale. Even with the thin mouthfeel, this would be a decent beer to have a few of. I like it."
"Have to say I was expecting more from this ale. It was definately on the light side of the Irish red ale spectrum. This was very fresh when consumed, but the flavors didn't pop like I thought they would."
"Pours a nice mahogany color with a good amount of head and tons of effervescence. Smell is nutty with a touch of caramel notes in there. Taste is very smooth and has a creamy mouthfeel to it. Has a nice body, some nice bready and caramel tastes in there. Finishes clean and is very drinkable. While not spectactular, this Irish Red is well above average.. another solid addition to the Saranac line up."
