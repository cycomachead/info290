"O- ok but nothing special a passable red that is drinkable"
"O: The malt profile this beer has is very interesting, and combined with the earthy woody hop flavor underneath i'm a fan. However.. the carbonation from this bottle was out of control and made it more filling then it needed to be."

"Pairing: best with hot wings, I advise against nachos, jalape√±os overpower the beer yet the wings did not."

"O: It was alright, average beer for an average price, I guess I wouldn't mind having it again but it's not something I would seek out for."
"O - Overall a pretty good red, but there's better out there."

"Overall - I was surprised by the flavor of this beer.. I thought it was going to be a typical amber ale. It's very good. It's not far off from a wine cooler though."
"When all is said and done, it's a nice red beer for a cool fall day, but there are many better reds out there."

"Enjoyed at the brewery. Single finger head with nice lacing on a clear amber body. Caramel and toasted malts with light strawberry and herbal aroma notes. Flavor is plain and undermalted with a slight earthy and herbal hop note. lighter body than expected for the style and moderate carbonation. Many of these brews are boring and undermalted, expecially the red ales."
"Brewery is nearby. I look forward to sampling a few Dragonmeade beers fresh."

"Hard to get excited for this beer. Some off flavors going on here but they seem to be intended. Glad I just have the one bottle."
"Light mouthfeel with a tangy finish. Not something I would drink every day, but an interesting spin on a red ale."
"Overall, this is a fine but maybe undistinguished red ale. It sort of cements Dragonmead in my mind as a fine but maybe undistinguished brewery with the exception of Final Absolution."
"Overall: Refreshing and much more flavorful than expected for the style"
"Good pouring, brilliant red/amber hue, not too much head. Great aroma, has a distinct ""heavy"" smell. Some carbonation, but not enough to ""bite."" Very refreshing, one of the best darker beers I've had for the summer. Not a lot of sweetness, quite dry, but still fresh tasting. Clean finish, almost a lemon/bitter aroma at the finish, it was there, and now it is gone."
"D-Not a bad tasting beer overall but just too over the top with the carbonation."
"This brew pours a beautiful cloudy deep amber with a slight head (after a fairly aggressive pour) that dissipates quickly. Definitely not aromatically challenged. I get a very pleasant & mellow malt essence with a tinge of sweet. It has a good meaty scent to it, but it's not piercing my nostrils; already, it seems balanced and tasty, and that's coming from my nose. The taste is nice, dry & crisp. Light to the sense, yet packed with malt-flavored goodness. It's a fine mix, as some ambers pack on the flavor, and the density; whereas this brew almost drinks like a lager, but yet has plenty of girth to back it up as an Irish ale. I love how there's a hint of sweet and a slight bitterness, yet it's almost like they mask each other. There's a 'bready-ness' to the taste that allows each flavor to blend and create its own taste. The aftertaste is a nice lingering malt sensation. It hits the back of my throat in a refreshing way and sits there until the next sip. I get a nice hint of bitterness in the end."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a small amount of carbonation."
"A hazy amber pour,with two fingers of soapy white head.Aroma of bread, toasted malt and herbal hops.Flavor is sort of a toasty ,piny,nutty,and herbal hops,medium sweetness, A sweet honey type finish.Thin mouthfeel,kind of a watery body, drinkable but nothing special"
"D - I hate to say it, but this was not good. The fruitiness I noted reminded me of young homebrew. Love to try this on tap, and see if that helps with the conditioning. Weak body, weak flavor. Still looking forward to try more from these guys though..."
"This beer is unlike the few other Irish reds I've had, in fact it reminds me more of a Scottish ale, but I suppose they can be fairly similar. While it had a standard red, with white head, appearance, the aroma and flavor, especially, came off as dry, thin caramel malts with some bready flavor mixed in. The yeast seemed to add a creamy note as well, but the malts carried this beer. Tasty and drinkable, worth trying."
"$2.69 single at Sicilianos."
"mouthfeel is nice, good weight, good flavor, and very sessionable - a great irish red!"
"I would order again."
"Poured a dark reddish copper with minimal head. It really didn't have much smell to it at all, so I was especially surprised with the flavor of this one's! It had a pretty strong flavor with a very sweet finish which I believe was honey. It was a very drinkable beer which I will want to definitely try again."
"Auburn copper body, clear, with a finger of fizzyish, dirty light khaki head. Sweet caramelly malts over toasted nuts, light brown sugar, and soapy, floral hops. Lightly toasted malt and grains up front. Mildly sweet caramel and cola flavors gradually turn sourish. Finish is slightly tart with hints of herbal and citrus hops. Moderate body with a rather fizzy feel. Not bad, but not one of my favorite Dragonmead brews."
"Maybe it's because I haven't had an Irish red in a while, but I like this one more than I expected to. If Erik the Red (Irish Style Amber Ale) is representative of what Dragonmead has to offer, I'm looking forward to the handful of other singles that I was able to find on my recent trip through southern Michigan."
"On tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor,poured from the tap into a standard pint glass a slight hazed reddish brown color with almost no head to speak of,light aromas mainly faint caramel a light toastiness.A pretty standard malty red on the palate,big dose of caramel,buttery sweetness and firm toastiness almost a butterscotch flair going on a very faint herbal hop shows thru in the finish.Eh it was ok it is what it is a malty red with a thinner mouthfeel."
"D - Very drinkable. I could have one of these almost hourly. Overall a really good beer that I highly recommend. My favorite Dragonmead thus far."
"Unfortunately, the beer with my name (but not hair color), has got some work to do. This brew had a nice red color presentation, but low carbonation, and no head to speak of. Forget about lacing. Smell was sort of herbal and whisky like, with a touch of sweetness. Taste was bland and kind of boring, with only minimal amounts of malt. Mouthfeel was weak and flat. Not a real good beer, maybe I got it on a bad day or something. I'd try some other offerings first."
