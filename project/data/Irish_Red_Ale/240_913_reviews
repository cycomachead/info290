"On Tap in the only Irish Pub in the area that carries it - Paddy Cassidy's, Cocoa Beach, FL. I enjoy the clear, red-amber pour, the malty sweetness and it's slight bitter taste. (I'm not a fan of sweet-tasting brews.) It's light-bodied enough to be a regular brew for me and anyone that likes ales, especially if you can find it on tap. I've also tried the bottles but definitely prefer a correct temperature pour on draught."

"Drank it on-tap in an Irish Pub here in Rotterdam. Liked most aspects of this beer (color was nice, smell was okay, mouthfeel was above average) but the taste did not live up to those standards. A shame, really."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/29/2013. Pours slightly cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor balance and solid complexity of bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light hop flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very solid Irish red ale. Nice balance and solid robustness of bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering."

"O: Very easy to drink and enjoyable but not anything overly special - I could easily have a couple of these in a session but it will not likely find a regular place in my fridge."
""
""

""

"M: Feels thin at first, but coats the mouth decently. Carbonation is high for my preference - slight tingle on the tongue. A nice dry finish."

"330ml bottle. Pint glass. Amber color, clear appearance. Off-white froth creates a creamy, fairly good retention, crown. Floral & toasted aromas, wet grass & eartht odors to the nose. Crispy, toasted & earthy bitter upfront. Medium to light body. Moderate carbonation. Dense to watery texture. Sparkling & spicy palate. Dry bitter finish followed by slight woody notes & dried nut touches on the aftertaste."

"It's not a bad beer - the malts make it sweet and smooth to take down - although there's definately a metallic after-taste that almost gives off an alcohol taste. Which isn't horrible, but gives it a bit of a harshness to it. I wasn't expecting much, and Murphy's didn't give much. I wouldn't buy it again, but I suppose if you want to get into a St Patty's spirit once a year and you happen to buy this beer, it's definately drinkable."

"Aroma: some kind of woody smell. Appearance: Amber/red color, clear liquid. The head is minimal white/tan. Taste: light bitterness and light sourness which finish a bit salty. An average duration Palate: light body, oily texture and a average carbonation Overall: a nice pub beer."
"This is a nice Red, although if I close my eyes and think ""Heineken", I taste a Heineken. I'd like to side-by-side with a true Irish pub-tapped pint..."
""
""
""
""
""
"I get the ""tea-like"" flavor in the generic Irish red ale description posted on BA and find this to be very satisfying for the style. There is a nice balance to this subtle, understated beer. Probably not what a fan of US west coast-styled IPAs would like, but certainly for someone looking for a mild yet distinctive beer. I'd certainly enjoy knocking back a few more..."

"Nothing special, but an easy drinker."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and a slight hop aroma. Taste is much the same with a toasted bread flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is nothing all that special, but it is solid and easy to drink."

"Light body with strong carbonation and medium size bubbles. Well balanced beer."

"Pretty great beer. I got a single bottle and drank it from a large mug. The appearance was a beautiful red with vibrant carbonation, the smell was great and the taste was, to me, above average. It left no bad after taste and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I still don't know the exact alcohol content as it is not labeled on the bottle, but it is a really great beer. Overall, great beer and I would recommend it."

"Overall: I enjoyed this one. I recently tried the Newcastle Werewolf Red Blood Ale and was very disappointed. This one had more flavor and was not as watery."

"A bit dull, and a poor value, but easy drinking and with a hint of character hiding in there somewhere."

"Overall: standard for the style but little that sets it apart from the mainstream irish reds."
""

"Overall, its an average, highly drinkable red. Nothing really makes it remarkable or bad, and it goes down easy. But its not a great stand-alone beer to drink with. Safe to try, but if you have a better red as your go-to, this probably won't convince you to switch to it."
"O: Not a fan. Too sweet. Drain pour halfway through."
"O: A very non-offensive beer that goes down easy. Goes best with food."
"Some will argue Murphy's Red as a quintessential example of its style. That argument must surely be based on the merit of its lineage rather than its actual qualities (it's like a king ruling the country because of his genealogy, rather than his credentials). This very well may be how the Irish now brew their amber ales, but others nations do it much better."
""
""
"Flavor is mild and malty. I get a bit of citrus hops in the middle, but it's quite subtle. Finishes sweet and pretty overbearing, though. Fair to average, overall."
""
""
""
"Pours reddish-copper with a healthy finger of head that dissipates quickly. There are spicy notes in the nose. The flavor is light, but there is still a healthy dose of malt anyway. The finish is dry. Decent beer to session, but nothing here to write home about."
"D - Bland, uninspired, and just not real fun to drink. I'll pass on it."
""
""
""
"Pours out a typical reddish-brown color with partial haze and a two finger eggshell colored head that persists for a minute or so, leaving behind mild lacing. Smell and flavor both have a strong presence of sweet malt with a buttery diacetyl structure and semi oily/buttery texture on a lighter body. Minimal to nonexistent hopping. Not a very memorable beer in my opinion."
""
""
"Overall not bad."
"Burnt red, thin white head. Steely caramel with a hint roast like barely burned toast. Some coarse earthy bitterness livens it up just a bit. Mouthfeel falls off at the end leaving a thin impression. There are plenty of better beers, but this beer tends to show up in places with poor selection so I end up drinking a pint every once in awhile."
""
""
""
"O: So what we have here is something more like a (Heineken, if there were one) amber than a traditional Irish red. Frankly, I think Coors (Killians) makes a better Irish red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent red which I recommend"

"Overall Drinkability - I heavily suspect this is either an out of date or skunked bottle, but I can't be sure because there is no clear date. Lesson be learned, brewers!"
"A very pretty beer with a clear amber red and a rocky head with a dusky off white hue. Smell is malty with butterscotch notes. A faint earthinesss as well. Taste is malty and smooth with a mild but respectable bitterness. Medium weight but a touch on the fizzy side detracts from a pleasant overall feel. Not bad, but not great. A nice enough session ale. Smooth and easy drinking with enough flavor to make a couple of these a nice moment and a decent gateway brew."
"Like a classic Amber Ale--big, semi-sweet crystal malt beginning, plenty of biting hop in the swallow. The aftertaste is short-lived, though. The flavor is not multidimensional. Good body, high carbonation. This is a good beer when other micros may not be available."
"Again, a little bit of sweetness, and not much else makes up the flavor profile. Light toasting and grain. Really not a whole lot going on, how can you tiptoe around saying its pretty plain? No hops. Light body, some metallic notes. Meh."
"Draught: This one poured a clear amber color. It had a tight, white nitro head. Almost solid lacing down the glass. The aroma was lighter, but decent. Somewhat sweet, caramel, floral. The taste is OK. A bit creamy. Fairly neutral on the bitter/sweetness divide. Malts, faint fruits. Hint of roast. Drinkable."
"O: if you can get over the smell and the appearance its not an entirely terrible brew, i could have one or two but thats about it for this one"
"Not much going on in the smell, some sourness which i also tasted when i took the first sip. A decent beer but not more than that. Next time better a Belgian beer on the tap!"
"Pours pale for the style, a pale orangish gold. Decent foam and lace. In the smell, grainy, lightly floral, kind of macro-like. In the taste, a one dimensional malt sweetness, grainy bite, ghost like hop bitterness and a more or less clean finish. It is a lighter bodied ale, similar to some english ales, but rather bland."
"nothing special but the color of this beer even though its a great beer to have on a hot day like it is today. but on the other hand the masked 5.0 ABV can make you pass your capacity without even filing it ..."
"Overall better than O'hara's but still not that great. Probably won't buy again."
"Overall: Simple mass consumption beer, no taste layer, not complex at all, nice for pub quiz and (the real) football though."
"This beer poured out as a pretty nice looking red color. The head was white and fizzled away not leaving a lacing because. The aroma was mostly malts and other grains. Not much hops in there. The taste was smooth and was full of caramel malts. The mouthfeel was a little thin and wasn't as interesting I was hoping for. Overally I was a bit disappointed with this brew."
"O: An Irish Red Ale isn't to complex as a style, this one was no exception."
"Overall: This is just an overall average beer. The flavor is a little too light for me, and there just doesn't seem to be a whole lot going on."
"Dr: 5% ABV is concealed - not that that's a difficult feat to accomplish. It refreshes on a Berlin summer's day, but would be better served a bit colder. Perhaps the label's advice was sound. It's a decent beer, but I understand now why we don't serve it in Ireland: none of the lads would give a shite. Very affordable in Berlin. I think it was something like two euro."
"The body is light to medium, and the carbonation is just a touch too spritzy for my liking. Otherwise a nice crispness stays the whole way and it's fairly smooth overall."
"Surprise! This wonderful beer can be described as a Brown Ale ""light"" which would be true to it's style. Smooth and clean it is obviously well brewed with a great process, quality yeast and water."
"Overall, this is a decent session beer with enough aroma and taste to carry you through a few pints."
"D - Doesn't require much thought or effort to enjoy, because there simply isn't much here. Nothing bad, mind you, just nothing that sticks around."
"O: Good session ale. To be enjoyed in a British / Irish pub"
"RJT"
"This beer looks the part of a great red beer. To be honest I was very excited to try this beer. I have also been on a can lick as of late. Sadly it taste like a instant made, Mr Beer if you will. Smell, look and feel are all good to above average. But the taste is way off, taste like it is out of a can. I will review again when I find in a bottle."
"O-I happened to like this quite a bit. I was skeptical going to something lending itself more towards mass production, but I was happy with the beer and would buy it again if I wanted Irish Red."
"The beer was a red copper color with a thick foamy white head that left a lot of lacing. Smells of grassy, lemony hops with a slight aroma of toasted caramel malt.The flavor is pretty much the same with the bitter lemon and grassy hops, there is an aftertaste of toasted bread. The feel is light with some stinging carboination and a dry finish. I thought this was a decent beer, it hasn't got very good reviews but I would drink this any day."
"It's not a very good beer. Has few redeeming qualities and not something I'd want to drink again. Not even sure I want to finish the glass."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a crystal clear, copper-red coloring with LOTS of carbonation. Pours a huge off-white head that cascades down to a manageable two inches. Caramelly nose with bubble gum/cotton candy notes, as well. Slight toasty scents, also. The beer has extremely light flavors riding a crisp and light body. Sweet flavors ranging from nutty to caramel, but lacking in any robust features. The beer tastes watery. Low malty aftertaste, the beer has a weak and rapid finish, which is the only merciful thing about this. Disappointing."
"I was given this beer by my bartender when I asked him to just give me a random beer. I was relatively surprised to find out that I enjoyed the heck out it. I ended up ordering two more. It's easy to drink and has real fine taste. At first it has a little bite but as you sip it you will be refreshed. I highly recommend this beer, as it is easy to drink. I plan on having this beer again when I get the opportunity."
"D - Not a great beer but OK for a session"
"This is a very drinkable beer, nothing overly exciting but it was a good beer."
"I'm not a big fan of this Irish Red but I'm glad I tried it. 5 more bottles to go. Maybe I'll throw some in a stew of some sort."
"Pours a light amber gold and clear with some nice lacing. The lacing is quite respectable despite its othe qualities. It smells of lightly toasted malt and not much else. It tastes like it smells, pretty one dimensional, not bad, just nothing special. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with some carbonation. I could probably make this a session beer if nothing else with more character is lurking about. Cheers."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink, not great."
"12oz bottle. Pours amber color with a small, white head. Aroma is of caramel malt and piny hops. Body is quite thing. Flavor was a big disappointment - stale, earthy hops. At least I did not have to pay for this. May be I'll rerate it when I have a chance."
"D - Goes down fairly smooth. Not unpleasant. Easy drinker for those who usually stick to domestics."
"Overall, what we liked most about this beer was the relatively deep colors of the brew itself. However, the generous tins and metals given through the nose, and followed in the taste, make this lighter beer less than satisfying."
"Poured into a pint glass. The color is a moderate amber with an off-white head. The nose brings some light biscuit and caramel malt along with a touch of earthy hops. A very slight floral character as well. Taste is mostly some light bread and toast with a bit of bitterness that comes through in the finish and helps add at least a touch of complexity to this. Otherwise, pretty plain."
"D: This is tasty, super drinkable, and a terrific session beer."
"It's a good, solid beer, straightforward but effective with some malt and hop character, decently well-rounded, and certainly has some hop taste and bitterness to it, but it does seem a bit rough and thin."
"This is an easy drinking beer. Good dry finish. My only complaint about this was the metallic flavors coming through. Otherwise a good Irish Red."
"A serviceable, malt-forward red ale. This beer pours a transparent reddish-amber with a creamy, off-white head. The aroma is mostly caramel malt with some lightly toasted bread notes mixed in. There are also traces of smoke way in the background. The taste is relatively sweet, fairly water. Less intensity in the mouth than the nose. The feel starts smooth and almost good but it gets very thin and watery after the initial sensation. I'm not entirely sure what differentiates this beer from a (mediocre) Scottish Ale. It's not hard to drink, but I'm bored after only a couple sips."
"The feel of this beer is average, the alcohol is present, but the beer has a decent body and carbonation. The beer is drinkable in a pinch, I would take it over a BMC but not much else."
"D: It's a nice light tasting beer. Goes down nice. Very drinkable. I guess I was expecting more."
"MF/D: rather flat leaving the drinkability rather average, however a step up from a cheap light beer. i'd banish it to the beer pong table."
"Overall: reminds me of a shade of ale, almost a sample--because the odd lagerish quality, one that fizzes and makes great pace, makes this more of a swiftly produced Irish-themed seller for March...I can accept that I am easily led by holiday displays at Bottle King, but there are cheaper, local brews that can do the same as this..."
"Atmosphere is decent. Pretty solid appearance, although it seems a little 'thin'. The nose is pretty characteristic of the style, and nothing really exciting to talk about. Flavor is kinda' harsh. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
"D - It's boring and tastes bad, but guess it's easy enough to get down."
"I'd gladly accept one of these anytime, and sometimes at these BG bars, this is the best offering. Not too bad, but not something I'd go out of my way for."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear reddish/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is bready malt, some light hops and a bit of a metallic smell. The taste is slightly better (but not much) compared to the aroma, it tastes like bready and toasted malt, and grain. Not much else to this beer, really. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, and is well carbonated. Drinkability is average. It's not hard to drink at all. If someone gave me one, I'd drink it. With that being said, I certainly wouldn't seek this out either. I'm only drinking this now because I wanted to try it and I picked up a single at World Market. It's not awful, but it's not exactly good either."
"A very average beer, nothing really stands out, this alkaloid bitterness is not my favorite."
"Murphy's Red is a crystal clear amber ale with a big, fluffy, lumpy, off-white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a metallic aroma with a soft sweetness and a toasted note and... something medicinal. It's medium bodied; really smooth with a really clean finish. It starts malty and almost sweet, but a green, botanical, medicinal bitterness rolls in and kind of takes over. It leaves me thirsty for another sip. It's squarely a session ale. There's nothing stand-out here but it's very drinkable."
"Amber Bronze color with aromas of nuts, bread and lightly roasted malt. The entry on the palate is creamy and well balanced, you can also see in it a presence in acid aftertaste like a red fruit that is not yet ripe. The finish offers a point where drought and a slight hop bitterness. An Irish Red, which offers a range of flavors and considerable power to quench interesting obviously gives a good beer."
"Sweetish, but balanced... A decent, standard, Irish Red."
"Mouth/Drink: Mouth is a bit thin and is mildly carbonation. I can drink these easily but I wouldn't buy a sixer."
"D: Not a bad little beer, not the best Red I've had, but a pretty good Red... the low ABV is good, so you can drink a few, but the overall feel is a little weak... Nothing really stands out or jumps at you."
"You could probably put these down pretty quickly...if you really wanted to."
"D: A fair Red Ale. I liked it, but it's not a beer to wow you, just an easy drinking pint."
"Drinkability??? Not sure why I'd want to drink more than one."
"Notes: Overall it is nice easy drinking Red Ale."
"Not a lot of flavor but this is a refreshing beer. I have no problem drinking these, I just wouldn't pursue it."
"Avoid unless you can try it on tap."
"SKÅL!"
"Aroma is crisp and malty, rather typical but not displeasing. It pours a nice clear orange-amber with a fairly thick pale butterscotch head that sticks around for a little bit. Flavor is malty with a hint of hoppy bitterness and just a whisper of fruity sweetness. Texture is smooth, tingly, just a bit on the watery side. Fair to middlin' overall - not great, but worthy of a try."
"The feel is a bit watery, but this is a very easy drinking beer. Its one of those I won't go looking for it but I wouldn't turn one down either."
"This beer had a smell that reminded me of some of the cheaper, lower quality beers from my past, which was a shame, since I really enjoy this beer. I would consider it a higher class, middle class beer. The taste is sharp, and fools you into thinking it has a higher alcohol content. The color is nice, and the head was satisfying. I drink a six pack of this about once a month or so, but it is not going to always be a beer I take over other brands and styles. Definitely my favorite Irish red, however."
"D- This beer was sadly a one and done for me. I was looking forward to trying this beer out and well....it wasn't anything I should have tried I think in the long run. Glad that I didn't have to buy this beer."
"It´s assumed that i can´t drink because i have 22 days with cough, but i have to die someday. Once poured my ¨Club America¨mug: Look: Bright coppery red color, foamy head is thin and very white, i like the contrast with the beer; Smell: Regular, toffee malt and herbal notes; Taste: Roasted malt, toffee and hibiscus with a background of pine hops, well balanced; Mouthfeel: Clean and slightly woody, medium bitterness, very soft body; Drinkability: Very acceptable but i was waiting for more."
"Overall, it's a nice variation from the regular path, but not something that I'd get to drink with the guys. Cheers."
"It pours a beautiful color of brown and red. The head is real nice in that it stays with the beer and it laces the glass. It has a rather lively carbonation when first poured. Overall, this beer looks great, but it just doesn't taste near as good as it looks. The flavor can be rather disappointing. Having said that, it's not a bad beer. It goes well with food and the flavors improve as it sits."
"D: Allthough not impressive as a taste pallete, I still think this beer is very drinkable."
"Poured from a 16oz. can. Has a brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is somewhat sweet, fairly mild. Taste is also sweet, a bit of malts and quite refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and goes down with ease. Overall this is a quality brew worth checking out."
"D: Very drinkable, but why would you want to? Even Killians is better than this."
"D: Not bad for providing refreshment and cutting through sharp flavors. I had this with lamb biryani at an Indian restaurant and it was a nice relief from the spiciness of the dish."
"Pours a very effervescent light amber color with a thick creamy off-white head. Nice lacing and retention. Aroma is cereal grains and a metallic twang reminiscent of copper. Flavor is sweet caramel up front, tangy toasty notes in the middle, and then a lasting grainy finish with a bit of mineral character. Not too bad actually. Mouthfeel is thin and overcarbonated."
"D- A good beer. The style celebrates subtleties. I can see drinking a few in a sitting, but all said, I'm not going to seek this beer out."
"This beer goes down easy but downs have a little bitterness in the aftertaste. Is a pretty easy drinking beer and is light in ABV making a for a good session beer."
"D - Easily drinkable and somewhat flavorful. Nothing special or memorable."
"Overall a good beer. Not something that your going to sit and ponder, but a solid drinker you can grab without wory."
"D - After all that's stated above...I could drink this beer as a session beer...it was a nice choice at the Irish pub"
"Summary- The unloved child of the Murphy's family and for good reasons. Stick with other Irish Reds."
"Don't waste your money, this beer is not what you think it is. Not even close. Murphy's Stout kicks ass but this is mislabeled garbage."
"A significantly average beer, nothing really horrible, nothing extremely great"
"Pale copper in color with a light foam head that quickly breaks up when poured into a pint glass. I am not able to pick up anything striking on the nose. The taste seems a bit odd and is reminiscent of some macrobrew or over produced craft beer that I have had but cannot place. I wouldn't call it a great beer for sure. It is pretty common. I suppose I could see some being into it, but it just doesn't get it done for me."
"Picked it up on tap at the local pub. Little to no head, but that is basically how all pints are poured there. Arrived a darker, but very clear red. Very thin aroma, can't really characterize it. Taste is smooth and light, not nearly as full as I would have expected from an Irish red. Very drinkable though, due to its overall lightness."
"D - Easily drinkable. Not much here as far as a great beer goes. Its a pretty standard beer that, if you want something different from an MGD, it'll do ok for you."
"Pours a malty brown color with a thick foamy head that took about a minute to disapate. Leaves a thin lacing down my glass. Smells mostly of a roasty malt. Tastes similar with a sweetness to it. Didnt really like it at first, but after a few sips it began to grow on me. Its actually quite tasty. Its better than other Irish reds i've add (read: Killians) but its not fantabulous. Its a bit on the thin side, but that is my only complaint."
"D Great drinkability and I believe that this style lends itself to drinkability."
"D- Ok to drink there's just better out there."
"Conclusion: This is a good Irish Red, not great...I'd probably pick up a Sam Adams Irish Red or a Boulevard Irish Ale over this"
"D - While I can drink these easily, it doesn't mean I will. Middle of the road brew."
"Nikki"
"Final Thought: Brewed in Amsterdam, wtf? The only drug sold in Amsterdam (that is worthy) is not a brew, so specialize in what you do best. Disappointed!"
"Mouthfeel is in the same boat, not fantastic just ok. This beer reminds me of drinking a weak iced tea that has been brewed with some dirty tap water. An above average beer but only inches above that line."
"This beer poured a copper color with a big two-finger head. The smell is malty with a bit of hops. The taste starts off with a little bit of malt that is cut by a fair amount of hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a tiny amount of carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer, but didn't really stand out in any way."
"Pours a golden amber brownish color body, clear filtered. Average creamy white head lasting. Very malty aroma, some nuttiness. English beer aroma, clean and watery. Crisp grain taste, very English malt tasting. Clean taste, not heavy. Has the qualities of a session ale. Some light fruity aftertaste."
"Aroma screamed macro lager: light bread and metallic. Appearance is this beer's best feature: 2 finger somewhat off-white head on a reddish amber transparent body. Fizzy head dissipated quickly, but maintained a small (<1/2 finger) head throughout. Flavor was watery and much like a macro, lacking depth. No bitterness or sweetness. Palate was watery and went down like water. Not lingering and very forgettable. Metallic aftertaste and finish. Overpriced for what it is, lacking in depth and character. Not enjoyable on it's own. Probably will not have again. I was, however, impressed by the mild head retention throughout."
"Nice amber pour and with a little white head. Not much to the smell basically just a bit of malt. Tastes pretty good I was worried that it might be a little light in taste. Flavor came more alive as it warmed up near the bottom. Overall it wasn't bad a decent beer that you can enjoyably have a few of."
"D- Definitely a drinkable beer several times during a sitting."
"Eh, nothing too great here. Not as good as Sam Adams or Hooker in terms of the style as this one is kind of boring. It's light bodied and easy to drink which gives it alot of points though. Some caramel malt can be detected but not too much.. a decent beer but nothing great."
"Definitely a good session beer!"
"Bottle. Pours a clear amber color with a medium white head. The aroma is sweet caramel malts and some light grassy notes. The taste was fairly skunked; sweet caramel malts, light hops and grassy flavors also. Overall, decent, but a bit off. Slightly bitter finish."
"Overall-an ok Irish Red, not nearly as good as some others but not the worst beer I've ever had. I'm much more partial to the stout."
"Pours a very light red/amber color, very see-through, with just a bit of head and a little bit of nice lacing. Nice scent, very sweet and malty, and very slight. Good taste, malty and sweet, with a nice Irish red tang to it, with just not quite enough hops to give it a better balance. It does go down very smooth, extremely nice and clean on the palate."
"M/D - Thin to medium feel and decent carboantion. A little on the sticky side. Nothing I would seek out again but also not a beer I would pass on if offered."
"Perhaps the can wasn't the best way to go, but hey. Poured (yeah, I poured it from the can) a light red that was seethru with a minimal head and no lacings. A metallic smell (go figure) with just a hint of hops and I couldn't detect any malts clearly. Too medicinal for my liking, there is an alcohol burn even though this isn't very strong. Contained a decent hop punch with some punch as it passed over the tongue but then left my pallete dry. Hints of some roasted/caramel malt to make it pass, but it turned a little watery. I don't know which I prefer, this or Killian's, and that's not a good thing. The Murphy's Stout is much better."
"Served a crisp light copper with a thin frothy head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves slight lacing. Aroma is a bit of caramel and very slight hops. The taste is much fuller and well balanced, crisp caramel malt and earthy hops with a slight dryness. The beer is medium bodied and dry with slight carbonation. This is a great example of the style and at least on draft, seems much better than the reviews show."
"Overall this was a beer I would recomend, and it is from my grandma's area of County Cork this was definatly a brew I would highly recomend, I thougouhhhhly engoyed this beeer, I am drunk by the way. soo I cannot participate in the great rev9ew process. I actully think of this beer as an amuture Irish beeer."
"D: Terrible - I cannot finish at all. I'll never buy it again."
"Palate is light bodied, slightly harsh, light malt flavor with weak hops to balance. Almost like a bud light version of an irish amber. What went wrong with this beer?"
""
"I have to say, this beer is hard to define with the smell and does not taste as usual for a red beer. Nevertheless, it was a good beer to drink but on glass was enough."
"medium-light mouthfeel, decent carbonation and all pretty crisp-clean, though maybe a tiny sticky on the end. could definitely continue on these for quite some time, though in all honesty really not my style."
"Had this beer on tap at the Nine Druken Irishmen in Sin City. The appearance is nice deep red with a creamy lace head. The nose has slight hoppy spiciness, not much else. The same for the taste better than you average american macro, but lacking. The taste was watery, refreshing, slight hops. The mouthfeel fairly carbonated and refreshing. Could be an OK session brew."
"Looking at the pour it's not very red. More gold with a subtle red hue. Doesn't make a strong impression in any regard. Taste is malty as heck with just a touch of hops to barely balance things. As malty as it is, it's not overly sweet. Fairly drinkable, but there's better reds out there."
"poured into a pint glass pours a reddish hue with a minimal head that leaves little lace on the glass. Smell is a bit skunky, I was dissapointed this smell coming from a can. Taste was a bit bland a bit of a bitter mess with a hint of hop sweetness in there as well. Overall I had some High expectation of this beer but was totally let down. I will not try this again."
"D - The aroma is a bit weak, but the flavor is spot on for the style. Overall, it is quite drinkable but I can't say I really liked it; something about the balance of the malt character is just kind of unpleasant."
"This could definitely be a session beer if you're in to this style."
"D- good D though, watery and chuggable!"
"Drinkability : an average beer in Irish red ale style"
"The canned version doesn't start off promising in flavor (comparable to the tap version I had some time ago), but given some time to warm up, it becomes a more palatable beer with less astringency. I choose this beer for St. Patrick's day when I was at my friend's house, though the irony is this is brewed in Holland by Heineken. Nothing impressive, just a decent mass producd red ale."
"Murphy's Irish Red Beer starts off unimpressive and finishes the same. The pour brings up a quickly disappearing head and my first reaction was, where's the red? It smells better than it tastes. Flavor of a I.R.A. is there but very very subtle. The mouthfeel is that of a moderately carbonated water. Best part of this brew are the burps."
"D - Good to experience probably wouldn't have again."
"Smooth enough to drink a good amount of these. Just not enough taste to want to."
"D - This is an incredibly boring Irish Red. It's so clean and lacking any sort of ale character that I'm inclined to believe this is a lager - after all, the title is Red 'Beer' and...I noticed it was brewed and bottled by Heineken. In fact, it reminds me a lot of how Heineken tasted in Amsterdam as there really isn't even much toasted malt character to it. I suppose it's a decently done 'beer' but I was very disappointed with this, as I really wanted an Irish Red ALE."
"D: Not bad. Not great. Right in between. A decent session beer that I wouldn't turn away. But it's not at the top of my shopping list."
"Amber, reddish, transluscent pour with frothy offwhite head. Smell at first is a touch skunky, metallic, malt and a touch of yeast as it sits for a bit. Milt metallic malt taste at 1st, with a light bitterness throughout. I liked this a bit better as it warmed up a bit, actually, which I usually don't. This is fine, and drinkable, but I wouldn't miss it much. I thought Smithwicks was much better for the style."
"Pours a nice amber color with a servicable head. The first one I opened tasted skunky akin to a heineken or grohlch minus the gree bottle. It has a sweet carmel flavor with toasted bread. How can this taste skunked in a brown bottle? Is this the heineken that did not make the cut and is passed off as another brew? Will try again if i see it on tap."
"12 oz. bottle, contract-brewed by Heineken. The beer is a crystal-clear light amber, with medium carbonation, and a three finger tan head that I can tease above the rim of the glass - as the head settles it forms pits and peaks, and delivers nice lacing. Pretty simple in the nose, with grains, adjuncts?, a dash of hops, and some sweetness. Quite clean on the palate, with caramel and toasted malts providing the base, upon which skunky/spicy and grassy hops build a fairly pronounced hop edge; tastes more like a lager than an ale due to the cleanliness. The body is lightish, dry and smooth, with medium carbonation and some lingering hop oils that add to its medium finish. Overall a good go-to beer that is tasty and easy-drinking."
"The taste doesn't really have much malt characteristic. Again the yeast and it's spice and sweetness dominate. Almost like a dubbel in taste but milder. It has moderate carbonation and a light/medium body. Finishes with a sweet aftertaste. Reading the other reviews this beer must suffer from some QC issues with flavors all over the place."
"Pours red amber with a thick three inch white head. Smell is best classified as a bitter hoppiness. This beer actually comes across a being pretty good until you taste it. The taste is excessively bitter and it seems like you are actually tasting the glass, not the beer. I've heard good things about this beer when it's served on tap. I'm guessing there are problems with bottling and transportation."
"First off, I really like the bottle that this came in. Its a shame that the beer didnt taste as good as the bottle looked. Poured a 12oz bottle into a Smokestack goblet. Poured clear copper with lots of red hints with a nice off white head. Aroma is of grains and hand soap. Not like the nicely scented Dial but of plain, scent free, cheap, bought it at Aldi's hand soap. Taste is slightly sweet and creamy not much else. Mouthfeel is a heavier, medium body with a oily sensation that doesnt make the taste linger...odd I thought. I am pretty sure I drank this in Ireland and really enjoyed it, but I will definitely never seek this beer out again."
"Overall, this is a pretty much spot on example of the style - if you don't like it then you probably just don't like Irish Reds. The finish could be a little drier and it could be a great beer if it was upped to 6% or so with a bit more of everything but it's a competent, if uninteresting, example of the style - exactly what you'd expect from a big-name brewery. To be honest though, complexity is not a characteristic of this style."
"way under rated. not a rare find, but a great irish red none the less, copper red in color, a nice finger thick head that stick a little. the taste is crisp and has a mellow hop flavor, and a nice lingering finish. the mouth-feel is tingley and sharp, and it goes down a nicely as any other red on the planet. when (not if) you happen upon this give it a try, be it on tap or in a bottle."
"Drinkability - I would not willingly order a beer with the metal edge this one has, but this is marginally better than Smithwick's on just about every front."
"Overall I found this to be a drinkable beer, that had some ok flavors. I would drink it again. Probably would buy it again as well. It was pleasing, but not overly complex."
"Overall: Murphys Red is not a top of the line beer but it is quite interesting and enjoyable. It is well-balanced and nice to drink. Worthy a try but easy to forget."
"Well. To quote singer Björk: Theres more to life than this!"
"drinkability - a slow sipper a little sweet for me"
"worth a try."
"This particular product was brewed in the Netherlands, purchased in South America and imbibed here in the Pines. Smells like a typical caramel brew, very malted. Poured the bottle into a pint glass with a tremendous creamy head. Color is a rust brown. The head is very structured. Upon tasting, this is a heavy beer with good body. Very malty brew, but it does have a semi bitter hoppiness present throughout, from start to finish. Thisis a well balanced beer with consistent flavor. A little too sweet for my tastes but quite respectable."
"A pretty average beer. Pours a good color, very clear copperish amber. Big white head that fades to a small white head. Leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is not strong, malt is the most familiar aroma. Taste is very average. The first sip is malty with a kind of earthy flavor. As you drink some more, it is slightly malty with a hops bittering finish like a lager. Mouthfeel ok, I didnt see it as too thin. Drinkability is fairly good. I had mine on the deck with some pistachio nuts after doing some outside painting. Just right for this kind of evolution as a thirst quencher, but it is not one I would seek out. O'Haras is a much better Irish Red Ale."
"Final Note: A Grand Irish Ale!"
"Dry rough flavour, mouth of caramel, buttery, some hidden hints of coffee and tobacco. Very good one, and easy to drink at any moment."
"Poured this out of a 12oz bottle. It poured a dark amber to almost caramel color with a small off white head. The head didn't last long and there was no lacing on the glass. The smell was a bit malty, but the taste was sweet, with a hint of hops. This is a very quality beer in my opinion. This is a good beer for watching the game, or even make a good session beer. I would definatly recomend this beer to anyone. Just a little harder to find in my area though."
"Drinkability- A good versatile beer for just drinking, eating or darn near anything."
"Poured a rich brown rather than red. Creamy rich head atop a clear liquid. Smell is somewhat nutty with a mild malt characcter and almost no hops. Taste is mild slight nuttiness a bit of sweetness. The aftertaste is dry despite the sweetness. Body is medium to rich with a light carbonation. Overall a quaffable brew and better than the avg macro but nothing great."
"Overall: crisp clean roasty malt flavor that diminishes quickly. Probably too expensive to be a session beer."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style and not a good interpretation"
"Poured this beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. The beer was a pretty gold red with a nice creamy foamy white head. Nice fresh bread smell. Clean smelling clean tasting beer with a slighly nutty/malty taste. Great lacing alo. I liked the beer and will buy again."
"Murphy's Red Beer was an amber color and clear. It had a white head that was quickly reduced to a thin layer. The aroma was lightly malty and a touch toasty. The taste was a little sweet malt upront with a dry lighly bitter finish. It was light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was average. This is definately not best Irish Red Ale out there."
"D-the simple taste and exceptional mouthfeel make this an extremely drinkable beer."
"Not something I want everyday, but seems very well suited in terms of drinkability for this particular holiday."
"Not a bad Irish Red Ale. A good amount of tasty toasted grain. It's definitely worth a try."
"D - An okay red beer. Not as good as Murphy's Stout."
"Mouthfeel is pretty watery with some building foam of carbonation. Medium light body. I'm sure this beer is better about 15degF colder, but I don't get the feeling that it gets that much better. Most likely the last I'll ever have."
"Very drinkable as the abv is low, and it has a decent taste. Just not something to look forward too or seek out"
"D - A good red, but too carbonated in that it masks the flavor. Fairly drinkable, although there are better reds out there at better prices"
"Although this beer claims to be ""brewed to the original recipe since 1856," I highly doubt that to be true. Perhaps it is the macro brewing techniques surely used by Heineken that drain character from this beer. I would call it overly crisp for a red, not enough rawness to the characteristics. It has the distinct bittersweet malt notes of a red yet they seem to float around in a watery texture. Endnotes are just a fade out of earlier flavors with mundane hop bitterness. A highly macronized red beer, I guess it lost its characterization somewhere in the process of macronizing."
"Gave this brew a try last evening and I can say that I feel it was a somewhat disappointing choice. The brew was poured to a amber color with a good sized head that broke down quite quickly leaving a little lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma seems to be really just malts that I think gave off a nut and caramel like scent but that could also be coming through in the flavor as that is really what I am picking up after taking a sip. Not a bad brew, just nothing to write home about. Probably a few years ago I would have thought that this was a good brew, now it seems just average at best."
"D: Not very flavorful, but easy to drink and not too filling, it’s a good beer to pound if macros are your only other choices."
"Drinkability: a dull and boring session beer. Better on tap than in bottle, but still not one I long for."
"Drinkability: My first and last. I picked this up beause I heard a rumour it was not going to be made much longer. Personally, I don't think that would be much of a loss to the beer world."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown, ending in a nice hazy red finish. 1/2 inch head, that faded quickly, leaving little lacing along the glass. Little nose on this one, but what is there, is a slightly sweet aroma. The mouthfeel is medium. The taste is suprisingly better than expected. Slight amount of sweetness, but not overpowering. This being my first experience with an Irish red ale, I cant really compare this to any others. Overall, this is a very tasty beer, and a very easy beer to session."
"Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Although this beer is anything but impressive, it isn't offensive either. Good session beer, but nothing for a special occasion."
"Cheers!"
"I am not sure what to say about this beer. It was a sharp tasting beer with full flavors, but It taste a lot like a lot of other beers i have tried. I see this beer has gotten pretty good scores but i honestly didn't find anything special about it. The best thing about this beer was the bottle."
"Pours a pale ruby orange with decent clarity and streams of fast rising bubbles. An effervesent three finger head of dense cream shows excellent retention and lots of sticky lace patches. Clean nose, some mild toasted malt and english hop aromas. Sweet toasted malt and english winter barley flavors upfront, followed by tons of dextrin and a mellow clash of herbal hops. Semi-drying aftertaste, light sweetness, and very balanced hop bitterness. Light bodied with medium-carbonation; an exceedingly smooth mouthfeel. Finishes easy with a touch of residual caramel and mild english hops to match. A session ale for sure."
"WHO-DEY!"
"This was a favorite of mine way back when I first started drinking imports and craft beers and it disappeared in my local market for several years. It has resurfaced at the World Market and i'm glad it did. A: Deep red with a very creamy head that lasted till the last drop with excellent lacing. S: Sweet malts dominate with mild hints of almost oak wood. T: Smoothe delicious maltiness that is a little milder than the appearance and nose would suggest. M: Thick enough to represent the beer without hurting drinkability which is strong. Even though Heineken took over Murphy's I still enjoy this beer."
"Poured a crystal clear copper color with massive slightly off-white head. Smell is minimal with a slight metallic note present. Taste is very enjoyable with a nice malty sweetness in the doreground blanaced well with a strong hop bitterness. Finishes very refreshing and craving another taste. Good session beer."
"D: Downable like a light beer."
"Murphy's Irish Red Beer pours a slightly reddish light brown with a thick off white head from a sixteen ounce can. Smells inoffensive if uniteresting. Mild tasting, caramel present, some hops. Not bad, probably tastier than Killian's anyway. Worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"I will buy this beer from time to time when I'm looking for a simple beer. There's certainly nothing complicated about it. I admit, it's quite disappointing given the quality of Murphy's stout. The aroma is rather weak, with traces of malt. The beer does look red but tastes very little like other reds I've had. The flavor is a little malty, not very hoppy and with a faintly tart aftertaste that resembles many Dutch beers. All in all a mediocre beer only good for washing down food or quenching a thirst."
"Pours a dark redish gold with a thick white head. Smell is nothing out of the ordianary, a bit of hops, a bit of malt. The taste is sharp and strong, with some bitter notes. Tastes like a hyped up macro, but not by much. I love Murphy's stout, so this one is a bit of a disappointment for me. It has average carbonation, a light medium mouthfeel, and a good balance of flavors. I could drink these a lot but not for the price. If I had to choose I would pick a cheaper Irish Red and not find a huge difference. Worth a try if you are into the style."
"D - Quite drinkable."
"Overall, it is a very drinkable beer but uninteresting."
"Not hard to drink, just bland and uninteresting."
"I really enjoyed this brew. Light red/dark brown color with a small head. Leaves a good, thick lacing on the glass. Taste is slightly bitter, but refreshing. A good session beer. Goes down smooth. Much prefer this to Killian's. Good session beer. Can't wait to have some more of this beer in the future."
"Poured the required amber with no real head retention or lacing. A bit of floral hops on the nose. Slightly caramel hoppy, but it came off as being way too biscuity and harsh. Not very drinkable and surprisingly bad from the same folks that make the stout."
"Taste is fruity, dry with distinct caramellic notes, some maltbitterness and actually pretty clean. A good beer of which I could have a couple, not overly complex or big-bodied. Just a good pub-beer."
"This beer isn't too bad. It's easy to drink, but for the price I can get much better session beers. The aluminum can flavor is bothersome overall, so I'd be interested in trying it on tap or in bottle. Even had I not known, I would say that this beer definitely tastes like Heineken...not many beers do and this, while different, certainly does."
"It might have been the serving and it being too cold, but I still believe the draught version is better in this beer."
"The body is limp, kind of watery and weak, it reminds me of iced tea. Not much punch in the alcohol dept. so I find it hard to recommend this strange red beer."
"I have never been so unpleasantly suprised by a beer."
"Overall, i am very pleased with this beer. Nice enough complexities to let me enjoy one, but also a beer i think i could have for the whole night."
"Poured out the color of dark iced tea with a thin, white head. Decent sheet-like lacing. Smell was of toasted malts and not much more. Pretty one-dimensional. Tasted very sweet and grainy. Decent enough hop bitterness in the finish. Really, though, just like the smell, there wasn't much in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel was OK; a bit watery for my taste. Overall, this was fairly average. Neither bad nor good."
"This beer poured with a thick frothy heah. There is a thin layer left. The color is similar to sweet tea with a reddish tint. The smell is a bit bitter. The taste is not a strong point on this beer. There is a bit of harshness that is hard to overcome. This lingers into the mouthfeel. The drinkability would be higher if not for the sharpness. Smooth it out a little and get rid of the bite and this beer would be much better. Average for a red beer but there is much better out there in this style."
"Mouth feel is a bit watery, but carbonated quite well."
"Not my favorite style, but I'll take the exception from this good brew. Other than being a safe beer with little standout characteristics, there are very little to frown at. A solid caramel malt flavor that hinges slightly on maple syrup flavors and toffee. Lightly bready, but mostly toasty and nutty. Low butter-popcorn flavors. These characters come out in the aromas and subdue into the flavors and expecially the finish. Lightly malty finish keeps from becoming as clean as desired, but still a fine beer."
"Da good red ale. Could definitely enjoy this in a long drinking session. Easily enjoy 4-5 more."
"For Irish Red it is an average beer, but still perfect for social drinking"
" This is drinkable but certainly not well crafted nectar of the kind that most of us seek most of the time. Instead, this beer is good for tailgating or social events where the crispness is more important than the taste, which isn't this beer's strong point."
"Not for me man...."
"This brew pours a clear blood red color with big bubbles of visible carbonation. The head is large, creamy, white, and long lasting. The aroma is mildly sweet with some butter, and cream notes. The taste semi sweet, but kind of watery. The mouthfeel is light bodied with too much carbonation; so much that it masks the flavor. Overall, this brew is okay, but I don't think I will be purchasing it again."
"A completely ordinary beer."
"Mouthfeel is good. Not real thin, but less than medium bodied. Drinkability is good also. A nice pre-dinner beer."
"Light mouth with decent carbonation. Drinkable once I got past the nose, but way too boring for another."
"This beer came a light copper around the edges that faded to a dark burgundy in the middle of the pint glass. The head was smooth and off white. Smelled of dry ash and sour red grapes. Tasted of sweet roasted caramel malts with a dry and crisp hop balance that reminded me of a lager. Very simple yet assertive flavor. Mouth feel was medium bodied with a light small bubble carbonation."
"Flavor is odd. In general, red ales are not a favorite style of mine, but this one just tastes off. Sour stale oily hops. Malts that don't really taste enjoyable. Just not enjoyable. I poured most of this out so I could have something good."
"A little rough but drinkable, with a somewhat lingering metallic bite in the aftertaste."
"Pours a pretty clear amber color - almost looks like it has been darkened with coloring of some sort. The head is watery and thin. The aroma is of a weak sweet-toasty malt. Taste is not very complex, with a simple malty flavor and a tinge of commercial-grade hops. Very carbonated - some acidity on the tongue. Pretty drinkable as a session beer, but a bit too expensive."
"Not bad for the price. Pours a deep, more brown then red color with a full head that sinks to a nice lace that lasts. Has a strong malt smell. The malt predominates the initial taste ending with a touch of fruit. Nice light mouth feel and easy going down. You can drink more then one of these. For the price, I keep a six-pack of this beer around to impress my Budweiser drinking buds without spending a lot of money."
"This is not a bad beer, but it's not a good one either. I remember liking it quite a bit back when it was ""Murphy's Irish Amber", so I'm not sure if the beer has changed or my tastes have. The stout is still wonderful, however."
"Rates very high in the drinkability section. Well made and very smooth brew and would be a pleasing session choice. I am very impressed with this Irish Red."
"Started strong with the presentation but things fell off from there. Nice red color, brassy aroma, metallic taste and unpleasantly sharp aftertaste. Maybe this is better from the bottle/tap? Certainly drinkable but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one."
"Appearance is light, pale brown with a hint of red. Foam is good, lacing remains. Aroma consists of loamy and metallic hops that overwhelm any malt that might be present. The mouth feel is not unlike drinking half and half, taste has some roasted toffee malt mellowed out by the bitter hops. Finish is surprisingly clean. But there are better beers for less money."
"The beer is quite drinkable, if for no other reason than it's rather unremarkable. I'd drink it again, but I'll not search it out, especially at $9 a six-pack here in KC."
"Nice red color, small white head, some carbonation is visible. Smell is slightly sweet with carmel malts, slgiht metallic, and a little hops. Full malt flavor, which quickly and smoothly fades into a nice hop finish. The malt does have a richness to it that is very satisfying. I think think this is a very good example of the style. Well rounded and full bodied."
"Arrived in a tulip pint, a pale red with a small head that fell to a foamy platform. Plenty of carbonation. Smell was nearly non-existent. Bland. Taste is bland too, somewhat bready with some malt. Thin finish. This is nothing special. No off flavors, nothing bad, an easy drinking ale, but not much of interest here."
"The mouthfeel was a trifle thin, but the carbonation seemed about right for this style. Easy enough drinker, but there are better reds to search out first."
"Light bodied, lowly carbonated. Drinkability seems to increase with each sip, but it still can't muster much more than average."
"Medium bodied brew with a nice creamy flavor to it. Smooth with a sweet caramel malt presence. Dry hops on the finish. The major feel of this beer focuses on the bready and grainy qualities in the mouthfeel. Average to slightly above average drinkability level. Not bad, but nothing I would go out of my way to find."
"Brewed in the Netherlands for Murphy's. Color is reddish amber with a rather large head. The smell is lightly malty with a rather strong presence of grain aroma. The taste is moderately sweet with plenty of grain taste. A light herbal hop taste is barely in the mix. Finish is sweet and mildly drying. This is a pretty good overall beer for when you're in a mood for something fairly simple, but still tasty. However, for an ale this beer tastes very lager-like, and it seems the typical graininess of other beers from the Netherlands has found it's way into this beer."
"this beer is average. certainly drinkable, nothing resounding in the flavor department. flavor is muted overall, and i don't like the finish much. this is basically mid-brow ale (that barely has any ale qualities). doesn't do it for me."
"12 ounce can, ""brewed according to Irish tradition"" in Holland! Go figure...Pours clear and the expected reddish shade of amber. Light tan frothy head, with decent retentive powers exhibited. Leaves creamy, medium bubble extensive lacing. Nose is some sweet malt, and alot of sulpher. Light bodied brew, mostly just sweet malt picked up, low hopping levels. Slight sulpher again picked up. Metalic, cabbadgy off flavors present, make this a forgetable beer and surely not one to seek out with much effort."
"Wonderfully creamy body, too, and the low carbonation make this a great session ale."
"Once again- the can seems a wise choice for an import here. Fresh and fit."
"Crystal clear copper to amber color. Thick white creamy head disappears quickly. Small patches of lace on the glass. Some caramel notes, grainy along with a typical pale lager smell. Sweet caramel malt, astringent and hints of fruit. Fair amount of floral hop bitterness. Dry finish. Light to medium body, moderate carbonation. Decent beer. The dry finish takes away from the drinkability for me."
"A very drinkable red ale. Minimum carbonation, and not much of a head to speak of. Poured out to more of a amber/brown/golden color than red, but none the less remained consistant with what one would expect from a red beer. Overtones of a lightly dry brew with hints of maltiness. A touch on the bitter side for my taste. Worth a try."
"This is a decent Red Ale with a much better flavor than aroma. I recommend trying this though its nothing amazing."
"Well, happy that I am not working in this beer segment! Have to say I always loved the Guiness... what is a stout but from Ireland like every BA should know and from what I think is a good beer. This though is somthing else... nice colour, .... what is the only thing I like about this one.... bad foam, worse taste that has nothing but malt and oxidation smell. Flat and oxidated taste and no aftertaste at all... guess one of the worst beers of a big brewery that I know."
"On draught at Nine Fine Irishmen in Las Vegas. This beer is a reddish amber color with a thin light beige head and very little lacing. Roasted malt aroma is difficult to detect. The mouthfeel is on the thin side, similar to other low-end Irish beers like Killians. Sweet malt flavor with a touch of caramel and hops. The finish is slick with just enough hops to even it out. The beer is OK but definitely not worth the $6 price tag at this joint."
"I had never had a real Irish red ale so when I found out this was contract brewed in Holland I was little disappointed. It poured a deep red with a large head quickly receded. The smell was odd at first, not inviting at all. When I tasted it though it was better. Still it didn't have that much taste and it was thin almost like an American lager. It seems like I'll be able to drink a few of them, but otherwise, I don't think I'll drink this beer again."
"Clear plastic pint cup presentation. Nice 3/5"" light beige head over the deeply reddish brown brew. Aroma is of medium malts, with a slight hoppy presence. Taste is pleasantly malty, with a well-balanced flavor. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both reasonably good, with the sessionability of this brew being quite good."
"The beer pours a golden/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a weak malt scent that I guess has pale and light crystal malts. It seems like there are some adjuncts as well along with lager yeast. The taste is average as well. It is a bitter beer with some maltiness, but not much. It is dry and watery. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer just sucks. It has terrible aroma and taste. It's one and done for me."
"On tap: Nice red hue and good solid head. Roasted malt aroma, no hops and not much yeast. Nice sweet roasted malt taste, with slight metallic taste (which I attribute to rotation). Good mouthfeel. Overall a descent beer, I would say it is tastier than Killeans, and Id order it again."
"This is not what I expected from an Irish ale. It was rather disappointing."
"Pours a reddish brown color with one finger of head. Not too much lacing. The smell is sweet with caramel malt, maybe a little toffee. The taste has a little bit of a coffee flavor, almost espresso bitterness. Some toffee sweetness, but a slightly dry finish. The body is good and thick, and the drinkability is nice right at 5.0% abv. Not too bad for my first Murphy's."
"The beer pours a clear red bronze with a matching head. It's smell is sharp of malt and hops. The taste is a little surprising as it is maltish with a hint of berries. The feel is oily and a little thick. I have enjoyed this beer with a variety of foods and by itself. Nice to find it on tap at Fran's in New Hope, PA."
"On-tap at The Liffey: Clear reddish brown, thin smooth vanilla hued cap, specks of lacing sticks. Aroma has much ado about nothing, I wiff and wiff and I get hardly anything. Faint of all faint sweet malt. Flavors are just as offering, hello, I'm I drinking something or not. Very mild, very faint, and very quick malty sweetness with a smidge of toastyness. Irrefutably tasteless. No off flavors, just no flavors. Feel isn't watery really, just thin and lacking. I had this in a bottle some time ago and it was so bad I decided not to review it. Saw that it was on-tap so I figured, maybe, it might be a bit better. Um....nope."
"An Irish red beer brewed in Holland. OK. The Dutch and Irish are the friendliest people I've met in my limited world travels, and I've had enjoyed superior beers in both countries. This pseudo-Irish red beer, that begins with such an exceptional appearance fails to impress, when it gets past its superior looks. Is this now brewed by Heineken, or what?"
"Murphy's Irish Red reminds me of a redhead who fails to make the finals of a beauty pageant: decent looks but utterly without substance, and a bit too nasty to be in the running for Miss Congeniality. Now, about that tall brunette who's a Phi Beta Kappa..."
"This reddish, dark amber, clear beer has a very big, cream-colored, bubbly, foamy, thick, active head. It leaves some spots of lacing on the glass. The smell is sourish and almost lagery. A faint caramel front introduces a darker malt middle that sweetens a little with a touch of fruit. The finish sours some and sports a nice bitterness with some nuts. Not great, not bad (and needs to warm up a little to develop much taste)."
"A refreshing and satisfying brew that I will be look for again."
"notes: Nothing special to me here, I think even for $1 I can do better, but you can certainly do worse too."
"With a slightly hoppy aroma I expected a bit more flavor. Unexpected skinky/heinies aroma and a funky aftertaste really hurt this beer, but it was still fairly drinkable. Amber body and tan head, not a bad looking beer. Flavor was sweet and pleasant with a funky aftertaste. Thin mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but certainly nothing to hunt down."
"Hmmmm...I saw the name Murphy's and decided to try it. I love their Stout, but this is not that great. Appearance was ok, reddish, but little head and lacing. Taste was way to sweet, with a catch in the mid palate and later the throat....Drinkability suffered ...too oily...too sweet to enjoy. Disappointing."
"This is not a beer that I would turn down, nor would I feel abused if I found it on tap at a local restaurant. But I followed my last one with a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, and the comparison was not one that the Murphy's people would have appreciated."
"Funny, on the back of the bottle it read ""Product of The Netherlands"". Contract? Did Ireland move and I didn't get the memo?"
"Drinkability: did not want a second one"
"The aroma is mostly of cut hay and peat, with a vague scent of cracked malt. The malt body is liquid and smooth. The fairly malty taste is offset by tea-like and a light citrusy bitterness. A light metallic bite is noticed in the back of the throat, as is just a touch of Euro hop taste. It's not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find more, unless maybe on tap."
"Not a bad choice for an easy drinking session brew, but there is better (and cheaper) out there. Murphy's is probably better off sticking to stouts, but this is an offering that would probably please your average Joe 6-Pack."
"Pours a gorgeous dark amber-brown with a thick off-white head. Smell is sweet, slight, and simply pleasant. Starts with a creme-like flavor and a tasty malt smoothness. Full-bodied with flavor suggestions of cinnamon, rich creme, and perhaps some semi-sweet chocolate. Just a little hop bitterness throughout. Finish is not remarkable. Aftertaste is *thick* but not terribly heavy."
"a supremely good drinking beer, murphys red sets the benchmark for any in the style. perhaps others have done better since, but these fellows have brewed something anyone can drink and enjoy. i know i always do."
"An Irish Red brewed by Heineken, yeah! Actually my bottle just says Murphys Red Beer. I purchased a single 12-ounce bottle in Lincoln for a $1.50."
"Its a drinkable ale..would make a good session beer."
"Label says brewed and canned by the Heineken Brewery.Hissed at me when I opened it.Poured nicely,head was an inch above the rim of the mug and took it's time settling.Aroma was weak with sulfur.Taste was more sulfur.Mouthfeel was watery and finish was dry,bitter and once again sulfur tasting.This may be a bad batch, but I think Killian's tastes better overall.I've only had Killian's on tap and this can could have kicked around a hot warehouse for awhile so my comparison my not be fair.I enjoy the Murphy's stout, so I'll have to try this on tap to be fair."
"Although not bad in any way, this is a frightfully forgettable beer, one of those you want when you don't want to know that you're drinking beer. Terribly dull, but a notch above that Killian's stuff you see everywhere you go."
"I had this at a Moscow beer bar. It came out a deep burgundy red under a creamy off-white head that left nice lace lines as it accompanied the liquid down to the bottom of the glass. The nose is strong with malt and just a touch of fruit. The mouthfeel is a bit prickly, but firm-bodied. The taste is malty strong, with a good hoppy aftertaste. A pleasant enough brew, this serves well as a back-up when there is nothing more interesting to try."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. Pours a dark amber color with a nice head that sticks around for a little while and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts, but not too strong. The flavor is very strong, but it's nothing to write home about. The taste is only slightly smooth and the aftertaste is pretty dry. It's a little sweet, but this seems to be just an average beer."
"Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is slightly malty and corny. A light bodied Irish Ale. Light malt flavors that get overwhelmed by the corn adjunct. Not very hoppy. Not much flavor, and not much else to say. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and very sweet."
"The label states it was brewed by Heineken for Murphy's. Ok. That explains the heinie smell. It pours to a thin white head an an articficially clear caramel color. Aroma is of euro-lager and weak malt. Flavor is powerfully bitter with malt coming up the rear--backwards when you think about it. Finishes dry and bitter...not bad at all. This is a beer I would not personally stock but if it were between this and a Heinie..."
"Pours a rich,deep amber color with a light to medium head,aroma is malty and toasty.Flavor ismalty but not quite sweet enough in my opinion with some decent toasted malt elements.I think a better than average amber ale, when I want a good amber I would definently buy this one."
"Ultimately this is a pretty predictable, uninspiring beer. Not rotton at all. I'm sure this is how it was designed. I hope Heineken can make a profit from this brand so that the company will thrive into the future and continue to bring us niche-like beers based on recipes from lots of different places. In the meantime drink Wexford or Guinness or something."
"The taste is surprisingly good. Its got a wide malt flavor, slightly peaty, and a wonderful aftertaste. The rusty, almost husky feeling left reminds me of my palate when I was in GB. Pretty darn good for a can."
"A little thin and lacking in flavor, drinkable but forgettable."
"Comments: Absolutely nothing spectacular here, but it's drinkable. It certainly better than anything BMC offers."
"Oxidized copper penny color, chill hazed clearish. Nice 1/4 inch head of good duration and one that forms sticky laces. Spicy cinnamon toast aroma. A medium brown sugar malt, a bit of orange impression. Light bodied and medium carbonation. Finishes slightly nutty with ""Red Hot"" spicy hops and a relatively dry impression for an Ale. This is certainly pleasant and drinkable enough though it lacks a bit of distinction."
"Kinda going from memory, for I served this to some guests, oh six weeks back. It poured bronze color with an ivory head that faded fast. Carbonation was medium, so it had some fize to it, but lace was ok, not thick, but present. The aroma was of toasted malt. The taste was also with a grassy bread-like hint to it.The mouth was left crisp, with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Not a bad burger/ Irish stew beer. I thought it was a better guest beer than Carlows ""Molings", of Ireland, that I also had at the time."
"Crystal clear reddish bronze hue. Vanilla white, well retained one fingered head leaves respectable lace. Non descript caramel malt and grassy hops along with a tinge of nectar like sweetness in aroma. An unfortunate metallic twang is perceptible as well. Faint toasted malt upfront in flavor is followed by a slightly coarse hop bitterness that seems overkill considering the meager, token caramel driven malt presence. Mild butterscotch eeks in mid palate along with vaguely floral hops. Lightly bodied, but passably smooth in mouthfeel. Very well attenuated, with functional residual sweetness at best. Finishes dry, with a hint of sulfur and very mild bready sweetness. Not particularly good, but innocuous enough for easy quaffing. Akin to a Killian's Red / Pete's Red Rush hybrid, but maybe a bit better. Thirst quenching at best. An Irish Red it ain't..."
"In conclusion, not bad, but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Brewed under license in Denmark? Why? Anyway, this is a very good looking beer that poured out a very dark amber, almost light mahogany color. A full, rich, ivory head capped the brew and held on for quite a while leaving some pretty darn good lacing. The look is better than the nose or taste, though neither are bad. The nose is mostly malt with some light hops kicking in as the head fades. The taste is mostly malt, but balanced more than many other Irish brews. There are some slightly disconcerting notes of metallicity. Feel is full, smooth and crisp. Light, but lingering aftertaste."
"After pouring this beer with the color of a golden amber, with no red hue what so ever. The smell and was of roasted malts and a hint of a bitter hoppy nature. The taste had a sort of chemical and metalic balance to it. Not a beer that I would purchase again. Smelling it again, it also had an aroma of hair spray? Not promising!"
"This brew pours a rather brown amber color. I found it to be quite pleasing for some odd reason. It has a nice head with good staying power. You can really smell the full flavored hops. The taste is excellent but the malt flavors really are much better if the beer is served at room temperature. This is a very good brew and would really drink it much more often if it wasn't so expensive."
"F."
"This is a rather unoffensive beer. I caught a unique taste towards the end, rather pleasant, that made this beer stand out in my mind a little bit. This unique taste wasn't what I would consider malty or hoppy, it was like a flat in between those two types of tastes. There are better beers for less money. Good to drink once a year on St. Pat's."
"this one pours a clear, reddish tinged rust colour. a thin but persistant head is backed up by some carbonation and a slight lace. a thin malty nose is complimented by an earthy and slightly grassy hop aroma. light toasted and biscuity malt tastes are paired with a light and crisp mouthfeel, making for a both flavorful and crisp, refreshing lager. bits of perfumy and earthy hoppiness abound from start to finish. not too bad and quite drinkable. just good enough to appeal to both the mass swill drinker and the particular palate. i probably won't be revisiting this one, though."
"It may be the Irish Catholic in me, but I really like this brew. I consider it an old stand by when I go out to a pub and I get tired of Guinness. It had a very nice deep radish color, with a white head that lasted a while. The taste had some undertones of citrus, but a lot of hops. Aftertaste was smooth and rolled down the ole esophogas pretty easily."
"Beer poured a slight redish color. Not as dark as you might expect in a red beer. Small amount of head lingered in the glass. Smelled a bit like Heineken, but not quite as skunky. Mouthfeel was refreshingly carbonated, a bit more carbonated than in lager, which is nice. The taste isn't anything special, but is not bad either, rather average. Drinkability wise this is an ok beer. A couple of them go down nicely, but the desire for more than that just isn't there. I'll get this again, but not in the near future."
"This beer was served in a green (actually aqua) glass which made it hard to tell the color of the beer. Maybe that was just as well because I was roundly unimpressed with this beer. The aroma and taste were bland. The menu said it had a ""touch of malt and slight hops."" To my taste I could not detect much of either. It finished as bland as it started. It was as drinkable as a tall glass of water."
"This bottle came out of a beers of the world box set that I received as a gift. This beer poured a medium amber, head was thick and retained very well. Lacing was pretty good with some nice sheets concentrated at mid glass. Aroma was sharp and slightly cheap smelling, reminded me of a macro almost. Taste was malty and on the sweet side, nothing really stood out but it was fairly smooth. Thinnish mouthfeel and drinkability nothing to write home about. It's not awful but it's hardly good either. Probably won't have it again"
"Poured a clear dark copper color with an airy white foamy head. Aroma consisted of malt, hops and a touch of sweet caramel. Mouthfeel is crisp, yet smooth. The first thing I noticed was the smooth malt sweetness of the flavor. It's followed up with a bit of caramel and biscuit. Crisp finish has the perfect hop balance to it in regards to the bitterness. A very mild red beer."
"Sláinte"
"Pours a clear reddish amber color with a bubbly white head that fades into a nice amount of lace. Nose is sweet malts and is a bit earthy and musty. Taste is lightly toasted sweet malts with a bit of caramel and a slick, oily hop finish. A nice if unremarkable brew. I have some fond memories of sitting at a bar and drinking these all day long one St. Pattys Day many years ago."
"A somewhat hazy deep amber color on the pour with a pleasant sized head and oodles of fine lace. The nose is mostly malt, lightly sweet and pleasing to the senses. Start is malt and sweet, the top middling and the finish nicely carbonated with a modest but pleasant hop bite and the typical dry lingering aftertaste, quite good in its own right, but give me the draught version, which is becoming quite scarce here in Arizona."
"Reddish-brown in color with a thick off-white head that lingers well after the pour.  Lots of broken lace with slight carbonation.  Fairly strong aroma of toasted malt with some earthy character as well.  Taste begins with rich, slightly sweet toasted malts, little in the way of hops, finishes with mild earthy flavors.  A decent, but unremarkable amber."
"Pours a nice deep copper / golden color, with a nice white head. On the nose there is a decent sweet malt aroma. On the palate decent malt flavor, touch of caramel in there, very drinkable brew. Lacks a well rounded flavor, but good malt character and very drinkable."
"An American-style amber Irish amber - hmmm, seems a little odd.  Nice head, but it didn't last long.  Amber color seemed thin, a portent of the rather watery mouthfeel.  Aroma is a little sharp, with a hint of mineral.  Slightly tart, with some just-there caramel malt.  Finish is mildly acidic.  Not much going on here."
"Pours real foamy (hard to keep it in the pint glass).  Mineral, ale-water backbone (like a Bass) with a pleasant malt character.  Barely noticable hop presence.  Goes down easy.  Doesn't kick much.  Great session beer."
"The beer was a dark brownish amber color that left a white head with some nice lace.  A slight aroma of malt, but barely even that.  The flavor was of malt.  The finish of is was very light and the beer seemed watery.  I was rather disappointed with this, since I was hoping this on tap would be better than the other macros they had."
"Not bad, but just a little bit watery in the end, no real standout character, i guess they focused this beer to a wider audience, drinkable."
"Nice reddish color, fuzzy off white head with red hints.  Nice malty smell and taste, earthy roastedness to it. Kinda slippery and slider, but tastes pretty good. Alot of malt taste, what you expect.  I never knew it was imported by Heineken. Ok going down, maybe one at a time. Haven't really had much in this style to compare it to."
"Nice deep copper/brown in color. Fresh smelling of sweet malt with a touch of carmel.  Taste is similar, somewhat flat tasting, but good malt character."
"Run O' the mill Irish amber."
"Kind of disappointing.  I liked Murphy's stout, and thought i'd give the amber a try too.  I think I'll stick to the stout."
