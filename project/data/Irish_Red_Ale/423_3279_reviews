"Served in a Mug"
"I love the color and the foam this beer provides.  It's a rich coppery color with a tan head.  The smell isn't much of anything, just a slight malt.  The taste is a good mix of malt and roasted grains.  Smooth with some depth of flavor.  A nice mouthfeel and only a slight bitter hop finish.  This is a very good ale."

"Nice Irish Ale with the quality that has come to be expected from Boulevard"
"This is a great take on the traditional Irish ales.  I'm really glad I went for this instead of one of the mass-market ones (Smithwick's is probably the best of the lot, but not as good as this) at this time of year.  Nice color, lots of lacing, big head, just a really nice looking beer that tastes great.  One of Boulevard's better beers for sure."
""
"Overall: A very solid take on an Irish Red. Has the toasty caramel malt presence you expect with a wee bit of roast."
""

"O – A very well-made version of Irish Red, just not a lot of character, throughout.  But the cleanness of the aroma and flavor profiles are impressive."
""
""
"Overall - this beer surprised me. I liked it a lot and would gladly buy more."
""
""
""
"Nice copper/rusty color. Floral and slightly hoppy taste, a tad malty and a little sweet."
""
""
"I always expect it to be better, and am always let down..."
"Pours slightly hazy light brown tinted amber under a 2” off-white persistent foam cap. Has a clean malt driven aroma with caramel and bread crust. A light caramel sweetness on the introduction dries out with a light roast and grainy finish. Medium body and moderate to moderately high carbonation, which seems a little high and washes out some of the malt flavors."
"Another solid standard from Boulevard.  Crisp full bodied goodness."

"This is the one beer from Boulevard that I won't buy.  If you hand me one I will drink it though. I am at odds with many of my friends who love this beer though.....guys who wish they could get it year round.   The yeast aroma is too strong.  I'm not sure why it is more pronounced in this beer when compared to other Irish style red ales though.  Overall not bad, but not the best showing from Boulevard."
"Overall (3.43) : may not pick this one up again but it is a respectable amber. Glad I got to try it at a cheap price!"

"Pours well from bottle to pint glass. Head is nice and thick, taking a while to settle. It is not a very sweet Irish Ale, it is a malty ale, with a somewhat bitter finish. This is a full flavoured beer, that is neither overly filling or too complex. This is a great beer from bottle or tap."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark brownish red amber with a two finger light khaki head that seemed fizzy during the pour, but had good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark stone fruit and a hint of grassy hops. Flavor is biscuit malt with a light toastiness, earthy; finishes with a mildly astringent dry grassy hop bitterness with dry biscuit malt. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A nice domestic take on an Irish red ale, covers all the bases for the red profile, with a nice lightly toasty maltiness and a dry almost tannic finishing bitterness. Pleasant mouth feel."
""
""
""
""
"O- I think that bottle conditioning adds a bit of complexity to this one, very drinkable and a great example of the style"
"I like where they were going with this, I just wish they would've taken it ever so slightly farther. Flavor just lacks a little punch and the mouthfeel is a bit fluffy. However, you could probably pound these on St. Patrick's Day and not turn into a complete mess before noon if you were so inclined. Overall though, I like this. Better than a lot of your more mainstream Irish ales. Seasonal, so get it while it's out."
""
""
""

""

"If it had more alcohol and hops, I would rate it higher, but it is priced right for its value. I had six pints yesterday, and did not become overly attracted to ugly women. My head felt ok this morning, and I made it through the day without being too irritable."

"And me (purposefully) without some corned beef... Anyway, this stuff pours a sunset amber-ruby topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises rich caramel, a hint of roast, and a healthy smattering of earthy, almost mossy greens. The taste brings in more of the same, with a hearty balance maintained for most of the proceedings. Things topple a bit in the end, though, as the greens puncture through with a mild wave of soil-laden grassy bitterness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice little red lass, nothing to write home about, but yet another solid offering from Boulevard."

"O-A decent Irish Red. Usually not a fan of the style but this one was decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good and interestingly flavored brew."
""
"Poured into an impy nonic a deep amber shade with a large blooming light tan colored head atop.Aromas are lighter with deep caramel and dark fruit notes.This is a real deeply fruit Irish red here,dark fruit and caramel over lightly roasted malt notes,a bit of drying earthiness in the finish.Alot of frutiness to this ale wich might not be true to style but it's pretty damn good."
"All in all a very enjoyable ale. Nice with some corned beef and cabbage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: I think this beer has a good balance of hop and malt flavors. The carbonation brightens it and it has a great reddish/brown color."

"All in all a beautifully balanced brew that is 6 pack worthy for sure.... Do you ever just crave a nice hop and malt balance where one does not over power the other... If so, then this is your ticket. VERY NICE BREW<<<"

"C"
"O- a splendid offering from boulevard. one of the better and more balanced red ales i've tried"
""
"Beer is a little apple-like in the mouth, a mild roast on the end, very subtle. A mild bitterness, a nice medium bodied. The finish is nice as well. I'd have it again."
"It's very drinkable with no alcoholic taste, but it's nothing outstanding."
"O: Goid tasting beer that is well balanced. A great St. Patty's Day beverage. Not my most favorite Irish red but a solid one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a decent beer at best but not one of Boulevard's best."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's simple yet inoffensive in taste, and it's easy to drink. This is a beer that plays it safe, doesn't take any chances and succeeds in doing just that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very drinkable irish ale. Yet another beer from boulevard that I've enjoyed and want again"
""
"O- After the last few Boulevards I had in the twelve pack sampler I was having some doubts. This Irish Ale though is quite good. Would buy it again."
"M: A bit on the thin side for my tastes."
""
""
"Mouth has decent heft. There is nothing bad here, but nothing that exciting either."
""
"Boulevard Irish Red pours a light shade of mahogany, with a half-inch of off white head that provides spotty, yet sticky lace. Sweet malt, caramel, and some herbal hops are noticeable in the nose, with the slightest hints of roasted malt discernible as well. The flavors of this brew closely follow the nose, with the sweet malt dominating the pallet out front, hints of caramel and toffee poking through, and a long, sustained finish with a touch of floral hop flavor and bitterness in the end. A medium level of carbonation is met with a medium-high body. Another wonderful example of the ""Irish Red Ale"" category."
""
""
"O: A solid Irish red. Nice malty flavors with a subtle hop finish. Not overly complex, but easily drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: I initially has this beer pegged around a 3, but it built on me. This is not my favorite style, nor a beer I would regularly reach for, but was enjoyable enough for what it was."
"D/O: This balanced ale is safe but respectable, able to cultivate mid-range flavor qualities that seem to find some new territory between that of the amber and brown ales. While the smell is representative of the flavor, it seems like a less interesting version of what greets the palate. It should pair well with most savory foods."
"Overall this is an easy drinker. Nice to have on hand to compliment any kind St. Patricks Day celebration. Another well balanced beer from Boulevard."
""
""
"not a huge irish red fan, but this one is really nice, and a bit different from the conventional. pours a nice ruby hue with a massive fluffy tan head. smell is red malts and dried fruit, maybe cherries or plums or something, just barely some residual sugar. taste too has some fruit in it, even more than the nose. mostly featuring the malt here, but some sappy hops come in near the middle. nice malty finish and a decent mouthfeel. leaves a bit of a yeasty/tart aftertaste, maybe from the bottle conditioning that i think isnt perfectly congruent with the rest of the beer, but a very drinkable red ale, with just enough abv for the spring days that still have some chill in the air. another worthy boulevard brew"
""
""
""
"pours a rusty brown with a quilt of light latte foam and excellent clarity. Spotty lace. Nose is of floral malts and a little bit of caramel. Some tea like, earthy hops. Metallic flavor over a decent amount of sweet malts. There is a certain dry, tart character I'm not really digging. Medium bodied with moderately hi carb and a good dry finish. This is okay, nothing more."
""
"I appreciate the balance struck on this beer; it's rich and malty yet has a nice bitterness that cuts through the malt to keep it from being cloying."
""
""
""
""
"(D)- A nice little beer with a wealth of malty flavors. A bit too malty for my tastes with really no other noticeable flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty darn good as far as i'm concerned. I wouldn't drink this year round but for St. Patty's day I'll be knocking back a few every year."
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: Looks good, smells good, feels good, but this bottle falls a little short in the taste department. I imagine this is a hard style to get just right because it includes subtlety, but this is a good beer all the same, it just doesn't shine out as world class."
"Overall - This brew will get away from you quick. I started the night with one, and have had a whole bunch since then. It is easy to drink several of these bad boys and not really pay it much mind. An excellent brew, I really liked it. Recommended, especially for the spring/St. Patricks Day/March timeframe. Enjoy!"
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent Irish Red, but again, with all of Boulevard's beers, there's just too much carbonation I think. When you pour the beer, the head blossoms as if you're pouring it into a chilled mug -- not good. But it's well balanced with malts and hops, and I do like this beer, but it's not perfect."
""
""
""
"O: This just isn't as good as I was hoping. Irish Red Ale's are really hard to perfect and this one has a lot of flaws that need to be worked out."

"I picked this one up a while back as part of a mixed six pack. Poured a dark reddish-brown color with a good beige head. Aromas of grassy hops, toasted malts and caramel. On the palate, this one is light to medium bodied with flavors of caramel, grassy hops and toasted malts."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce short brown glass bottle, served in a Plsener glass."
"Pours sparkling ruby with an average sized creamy off-white head, mostly lasting, good lacing. Aroma is average malt (cereal, nutty), average hops (flowers, grass), average yeast (sweat) with notes of pear and paper. Light bodied, thin texture, lively carbonation and an astringent finish. Average duration, light sweetness, acidity and bitterness; foamy metal, raw hop and cereal malt flavor."
"Probably one of my top 12oz seasonal offerings from boulevard"
"O- The hops are a bit stronger than the malt but both are a bit soft and there is not a lot of depth in the beer but it has some nice flavors and is easy to drink."
"The taste is far more astringent than I'd expect from an Irish red. It's a little too obviously hopped. It tastes sweet enough and there are SOME toasty characteristics, but I'm displeased with how much they are masked by the excessive hops. The toasty and sweet malt profile should be allowed to shine. I really think that Sam Adams does a better job of the Irish Red. I'm going to have to say this is average."
"O- I'll be honest, I'm not much on the style. But I tried to grade by style and this is quite a good little beer, both within style and in general."
"Overall, this is a nice Irish Red. The acidity in the finish is the only detractor here."
"Drunkability: this beer is fairly tasty. If today was St. Pats day I would definitely get drunk off this brew."
"I got this beer in a Boulevard Sampler pack and it was the seasonal selection bought in Clinton Ia. Very reasonable priced. a very average beer"
"O - A good beer for dinner with some pot pie or a burger (my choice) I enjoyed it and it disappeared faster than I hoped which means they did something right for sure."
"Top of the evening to ya!!! It's St. Pat's and what a perfect reason to taste the wonderful pot of gold known as Boulevard's Irish Ale! Thsi beer is very good....better than Killians. This beer is a nice clear ruby red with thin white head with slight lacing. The taste is agreat balance of malt and a lil something sweet! The mouthfeel is great and I could session this bad boy!"
"This one seems to be getting slightly dumbed down over the years. Still drinkable and flavorful compared to Harp, Guinness, and some of the big name Irish Reds, but past years seemed to offer a touch of roast and more in the way of hops."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Boulevard's Irish Ale pours a very nice dark red color, perfect for the style. A tan head emerges but quickly dissolves. Head retention is below average. The beer leaves slightly above average amounts of lacing. Aroma is not great, only slightly malty, with just an ever so slight hint of caramel. The beer is very malty and tastes much better then it smells. The toasted malt flavor dominates and it finishes smooth. The beer is slightly sweet and well balanced. The mouthfeel is very nice for a Irish Red and it i give it high marks for drinkability. I think this is a good representation of the Irish Red style- if it had a little more aroma, it would have very high marks."
"Overall, this could be the consummate session beer. flavors are light, well balanced and refreshing. The price is very reasonable at around 6 dollars a six pack (also, i can get this for around 3 dollars a pint at the local watering hole). Nothing exceptional, but a great go-to that never lets me(or leaves me) down."
"Ample amounts of carbonation and quite dry. A somewhat complex beer for a lighter ABV profile."
"The beer was a copper, marroon color with a thick, rocky, off-white head. It has an earthy, dirt smell along with some toasted caramel malt. When you take a sip there is a slight bite on the tongue that smoothes over with some roasty malt flavors and herbal hops, there is just a bit of sweetness to it. The beer is medium bodied with prickly carbonation. This is a solid beer, it's very easy to drink and the flavor makes it enjoyable."
"Well, this beer is easy drinking. The tannins/tea don't mess up anything and provide a backdrop."
"Pours out a root beer lollipop brown with two fingers of slowly dissipating tan head. Smells of molasses and malts. Tastes of a dry roasted malts and, some cherry and walnut hints, a slight after taste of semi bitter hops. Medium thick mouthfeel, a little light on the carbonation. I'd recommend a pint to a friend its quite drinkable."
"Overall a pretty average brew. Probably not something I would try again to be honest, not bad per se just underwhelming."
"A nice middle of the road Irish Ale. It poured a darkish ruby red, ahd sported a long lasting head which left plenty of lace. The aroma had a subdued malty, toffee chracter to it. Overall, this was a malty and somewhat sweet ale. A smooth bitterness could be picked up only in the background, but the fully body malt character had the last say. A very nice session ale."
"Overall, a tasty Irish red."
"Overall/notes - It's a solid Irish red ale from one of the best breweries in middle-America. A good beer to drink while relaxing."
"O: While not exactly as I remember, Irish Ale is a solid seasonal from my local guy, Boulevard. If they could just ramp it up to like a 7 or 8 on the volume knob (it's like a 5 right now) I would enjoy it more. That being said, it's worth a try and I will probably buy another sixer or two this year."
"A very tasty Irish red, great value too. One of Boulevard's better seasonals."
"Overall/notes - What can I say? It's a solid Irish red ale from one of the best breweries in middle-America. A good beer to drink while watching a film with a friend or two."
"Drinkability: This irish red ale fits the style description perfectly in my mind. This style is far from my first choice, but I enjoyed drinking this and will probably pick up a sixer."
"Pours a brown/red color, with a thin off-white head, average carbonation and clarity. Smells sweet and malty. But no sweatness in the taste. The toasted malt taste is accompanied by a surprising taste of alcohol. Other than that, I'm not tasting much of anything. The beer isn't very full, it's a little watery. The combination of the toasted malt and the alcohol leaves this beer quite dry. As with most Boulevard offerings, it's not bad but not great."
"This beer varies year to year. Some years it's good, other years it's outstanding. This one leans toward outstanding to me. It could probably handle a bit more bite from the roasted malts, but as it is it's very, very good, and well worth finding. Great job by a great brewery."
"Also had this beer on tap at johnnys tavern during the chiefs playoff game. This is a good beer. Nice dark red color almost black when not in the light. The look of this beer is amazing I love a beer with deep color and character. The smell is nice with alot of malt and a little bread. Lots of lacing on the glass. The drinkability of this beer is amazing. A nice Irish ale."
"Drinkability: One is too much. I've really wanted to like Boulevard's brews, but I haven't been able to find any (thus far) that I like. This Irish ale should be revamped or just retired."
"Taste is dryish, caramelised barley, some toast, light dryish plum and wine, light tea and woody bitterness balancing the light sweetness."
"Pours a decent red-copper color with a bit of nice head and some decent lacing throughout. Odd scent, with slight malt but a distinct alcohol tinge; shouldn't be there at < 6%. Decent taste, some nice malt with that nice tartness that comes with an Irish red, but not as strong as would be liked; very little hop at the end, more of a sudden drop. Goes down fairly smooth, though."
"Good Drinkability, a decent craft irish-american ale with nice hop bitterness."
"D: Easily drinkable. Flavorful, balanced and moderate ABV."
"I've got to say that this was definitely one of the better Irish Reds that I've had in a while. Lots of robust malt flavors with just the right amount of earthy hops providing balance. Plus the feel and drinkibility on this were great for nearly 6%. Maybe not entirely true to the sytle with all of the hops involved but I was still impressed by this Boulevard offering."
"Pours a clear amber color with a large off-white head that had good retention. The head settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is different from most Irish Reds. More hoppy than malty. A large dose of citrus and spicy hops before the malt underneath can be detected. The hops also play a large role in the flavor. Almost has a German Pilsener hop charactor. The typical caramel malt flavor comes in after the initial hop flavor. Bittersweet is a perfect discriptor for the taste. The body feels a little light which is not surprising considering the malt profile. Atypical for the style but it might appeal more drinkers because of the hops."
"Very nice example of the style. Goes down easy and smooth, and there's enough in the taste to make it interesting. Worth checking out, glad I tried it."
"It pours a nice amber color with a good head. The smell is that of grain with a hint of malt. The taste is crisp with a bit of bitterness. The body is light and smooth with a dry finish with a hint of bitterness. Is an enjoyable beer for kicking back."
"Cheers."
"Drinks well-sessionable especially on this murky spring taste in the MidWest."
"It is a pretty tasty overall Irish red. I could have several especially at the $2 happy hour draft price."
"This is a very fine example of an Irish ale just perfect for St. Patricks day or really any other day you have corned beef or soda bread. Or pizza for that matter."
"This Irish Ale is a very nice beer that shouldn't offend or demand attention. Just an easy drinker and wonderful at that."
"M & D - Delicious crisp and refreshing with a nice light to medium body that balances well with the flavors. Very drinkable with a lower ABV. Good stuff from Blvd."
"Drinkability would be better if the finish was more balanced, otherwise a good session beer."
"A deep amber color is poured with touches of ruby red along the sides of the glass. A quarter inch thick beige to light beige color head forms on top. The head dissolves away quickly leaving some traces of lacing to become thin film on top. The sweetness of malt along with cracked grain, bread, and biscuit are the main fragrances. The malt also dominates the taste as well with a hearty bread flavor with the addition of sweet caramel. A biscuit flavor develops towards the end it finishes with a mild grassy bitterness. A light and watery feel grows to become more medium bodied. Halfway across the palate the foaming sensation of carbonation come out cleanses the back of the palate. This may the closest beer to this style I have had yet. The strong malt scent and flavor is spot on, with the classic color and soft feel, makes me crave some bangers and mash to have this beer."
"Very hop forward for the style and on the lighter end of medium body. Lots of dry earthy bitterness with some dry sticky pine along with some sweet citrus notes. There is a nice slightly toasty caramel malt backbone that provides some balance with hints of toffee, nut and biscuit. Although there is some decent balance this beer is very, very dry and is dominated by the bitter piny hops. Not much like an Irish Ale at all really but is still pretty tasty. Long dry bitter hoppy finish."
"had on tap at old chicago in uptown in a pint glass the color was auburn brown with a little head bot with a nice beige ring and lots of sticky lacing..the smell was was caramel .toast, some roasted toffee a little coffee and some earthy peat smells..almost that of a winter warmer..the taste was the same it was a roasted malt and oat taste with some caramel and bitter hops..the moth feel medium with a slightly bitter taste..overall a good drinking beer for late winter early spring..i liked it"
"I was quite curious to see what Boulevard could do with an Irish red ale after drinking their winter seasonal, Nutcracker. I must say I am impressed because, while this is not an explosive beer by any means, it is very full of flavor and to me very pleasing. Sitting down with this would be a pleasure, and this is not a style that piques my interest easily. The affordability is also appreciated. Better than Sam Adams Irish Red for my money."
"First Boulevard brew for me. Irish Ale lives up to the Irish appearance: Tan foam, dark orange reddish appearance, and good launch pad for air bubbles. This beer smells damn good it has a two row barely smell right off the bat in conjunction with sweet caramel and subtle hops. Packs the flavor! Sweet caramel and many different malts hit the palette first. After a second these flavors subside and come to a yeasty sweet wet finish. Fine Irish Brew."
"Overall, this is a decent beer to drink and has a reasonable balance but didn't seem to come through on the whole."
"Mouthfeel is good, as is drinkability."
"Slainte."
"Very drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good example of a style that isn't one of my favorites. And to those who accuse me of not reviewing to style, ha!"
"D: Goes down smoothly but (and I can't believe I am about to say this) maybe a little bit over the top on bittering hops. I would also like a little more on the aroma hops."
"D: Pretty good representation of the style but not great; definately a good spring sessionable beer"
"an average irish ale."
"Pours a very nice slight hazey golden amber color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy light tan head, with some very nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of caramel. The taste is malty, nice sweet note, with some caramel. Medium body, with a dry/bitter finish. Drinkable, this is one fine brew, thanks Lane."
"D: Very drinkable, wish I had more of this!"
"This is neither the best beer in the world nor one of the most complex. It's probably not a beer people are going to be clamoring for throughout the country. However, I think it is very solid in aroma, taste and drinkability."
"Overall I liked this beer. It has a sweet malty aroma there is not much for hops. It has a dark amber body with a little bit of a red hue. The head was very impressive. It had a tan head that was very bubbly as well as the lace. It has a malty and fruity flavor with some hop bitterness in the after taste. The body was just right for the style."
"D- This is one of the better brews from Boulevard. I could drink quite a few of these."
"It is sweet, but its is a round sweetness that makes this really smooth. The aroma did not stand out to me in any way. The flavor is not complicated; it is just enough to make it quite enjoyable. I think it would be good with crackers, salty cheese and nuts. The color in this beer is nice, a deep amber, with enough red that it could advertise it. Hop flavor is in proportion for the style. Good one Boulevard!"
"NOTES: BBCSD-0904-Geoff"
"d: pretty smooth beer with good balance and decent flavor"
"A very drinkable session beer. Wish I could regularly get Boulevard here in Michigan."
"D - Not being a big fan of Irish reds, this has a decent taste. Nothing complex, just a straightforward ale. Not bad, but still not something I would want to drink several of in one night."
"Mouthfeel is crisp due to a medium/high amount of carbonation. Flavor is pretty muted and tame. A very malty brew. Definite caramel malty goodness. Bitterness is really low. This is a very drinkable beer. Low ABV + mild sweetness = high drinkability. Recommend."
"My first Boulevard and although thie Iris ale is not my choice in sytle...I'm impressed with BLVD."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep reddish-brown with light tan foamy head that crowns just over the top of the glass. As soon as it starts pouring you get a strong smell of malts. Upon further smelling I get mostly roasted malt with a scent lingering on the end that reminds me of a wheat beer. Taste is malt malt malt. Definitely a malt bomb, but a good one. Biscuity malt flavor coats every inch of the tongue with this beer. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a very dry finish. This is an easy beer to session and I do so every year when it comes out. Another beer that shows Boulevard is one of the most consistent, solid brewerys around."
"D-Easy to drink not sure its somethin I would pick up alot but once a year or so or if there was somewhere i could grab it on tap its very solid"
"The color borders on dark amber/light red and had 1/2 finger of head. It has a nice malty flavor with very slight twang that makes it a bit interesting. Goes down good and the flavor lingers just long enough to be enjoyed. I LIKE IT !"
"This beer is okay - it just seems to get an ""eh"" overall."
"It needed a little more bite, but otherwise decently inconspicuous for the style. Goes well with grey meat & olive-colored drapes. :P"
"I really like this. A good flavor and an easy beer to quaff. Something I would recommend and purchase again."
"In my opinion, Irish Ale is the best of Boulevard's seasonal beers."
"Overall I think this beer was brought in for the upcoming St. Patrick's day festivities, as the bar I had it at is right in the heart of the Dallas Parade route. The beer is very drinkable, and for me that makes it good. Smooth, sweet, with a great finish/aftertaste, and no bitterness make this one of my favorite red ales!!"
"Pours a dark amber with average size, creamy off-white head. Aroma of toasted malt, slight caramel, toffee and smoke flavors. Slightly earthy, yeasty, but the hops are blended and not in forefront of this ale. Bottle conditioned. Lacing mostly diminishes. Taste is lightly sweet with a slight bitter finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation and light alcohol presence. Pretty good for its class. Also, the bottles I purchased were all at 5.8% ABV. Not sure where you are getting the 4.26%. Even another site has ABV for this beer at 5.3% Please look into this - Cheers!"
"Overall impression: I hate to say it, but this one is better enjoyed straight from the bottle - it makes a decent session beer. When it opens up, the aroma is less than pleasant."
"A nice session brew that can complement a wide variety of foods. Bitterness is on the high side for an Irish red."
"D-A very sessionable brew. I drank a few of these last weekend and was quite pleased. Again tonight, pleased with this brew."
"D- It's not really filling and has a smooth enough taste that makes is really easy to drink and the fairly low ABV makes it possible to drink alot of these."
"Certainly would be nice if one could enter an *Irish* pub and enjoy one or two of these."
"On homebrewer on the tour reported have the just released bottled '09 version and found the tapped Red far superior."
"Pours a slightly hazy, amber color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, and slight spice (coriander/ginger). Fits the style of an Irish Red Ale. Mouth feel is mooth and crisp with average carbonation. Tastes of roasted malt up front, sweet malt, and then some hops. The roasted malt dominates the finish which is also slightly dry. Overall, not a bad beer, but nothing out of the norm."
"Poured into a pint glass it poured kind of a dark red and brown color. It had about a one finger head that disappeared rather fast leaving very little lacing down the glass. The aroma is very sweet, caramel smelling. The taste of this beer is very sweet, and has a a kind of tea taste to it. Not bad at all and fairly drinkable especially with a fairly low ABV. It's not a style I drink a lot but I definitely could drink this pretty easily."
"M/D - easy to drink, the flavor is just ok, nice carbonation, but overall nothing too outstanding"
"D - This is one of my favorite styles for session drinking. A good example of an Irish ale. I could drink a few of these!"
"Whoa, taste pulls a 180 here and gets much more Irish ale-like. It still has a sweet feel to it, but much more toasty. Hop bitterness is there as well, and to a much lesser extent some hop flavor. Fruitiness found in the nose diminishes significantly. Pretty light bodied and moderately carbonated. A good session ale with plenty of flavor."
"Drinkability: A fine session ale, that has enough flavor to make things interesting"
"Nose of toasted bread, with some hoppy earthiness in the background. Flavors of toasted bread and caramel, with some moderate hop bitterness coming in toward the end. Well balanced. Medium bodied, with a sort of sharp carbonation. Not overly bubbly, just kind of sharp. Finishes dry."
"Overall, at 4.26% abv this is a very sessionable beer. It is a really great irish red and something I could easily buy again."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable red ale very tasty easy drinking, could see buying this again for a session brew wouldn't replace my favorite red but is a nice change."
"Conclusion: Samuel Adams' Irish Red may claim to be a bit hoppier that typical for the style; Boulevard's is even more so. It's got a decent kick of bitterness on the finish, along with nice, herbal hop flavors and a touch of roastiness that makes this quite tasty."
"Pours a deep reddish-amber colour with a foamy off-white head that dissipates quickly to leave a few small bubbles. I probably shouldn't be reviewing any beers during the height of cedar pollen season, but even though I'm pretty bunged up today I'm still getting a good nose off this beer. Plenty of hops, a bit of spice and some yeasty breadiness. Once in the mouth there's a nice balance of maltiness but the hops are still to the fore. Full bodied but a little over-carbonated I feel. Even so, I'd go back to the bar for another one of these."
"What can I say? Another good seasonal brew from Boulevard."
"Dark reddish-brown in color with a slightly less than one-finger tan head that really never fades completely, only shrinking a bit, and leaving a thin lace behind. Smells malty and slightly spicy with a hint of wet grass in the background. Tastes big on the caramel malts with an undercurrent of bubblegum and a slight hint of hops in the very back. Goes down on the dry side and is fairly carbonated with a pure medium mouth-feel. Tasty brew here of a style that can end up a little weak sometimes. Liking this one."
"Notes: This really reminds me of Fat Tire."
"Taste is toasted malt hints of molasses, and a hint of citrus. Overall: This is a good Irish style beer by boulevard. There is a slight bitterness with a clean crisp finish. The body is medium to light."
"I am drinking an Irish Ale right now. It is an irish red brewed by my friendly neighborhood brewer, Boulevard. I love the Irish Ale. I even love the Celtic-ish label. It pours a deep reddish/caramel color with a decent foamy head that settles into lacing for the entire beer. It smells like sweet caramel, a little bready and malty, and a bit fruity. The taste is also caramel malts and sweet, but has some nuttiness, and a tiny hint of hops. The body is fairly light, and sparsely carbonated, and basically I love this beer."
"Not one I would look after, might try on tap local. I could put down a pitcher of this and not be sad."
"D - Session beer. Think this is above average Irish red."
"Drank pretty good, the dryness would get to me after a while. A passable Irish Red, bottle conditioned, so may be better a bit fresher 2 months post Saint Patricks"
"Sampled on 4/8/08."
"Pours a slighty muddied mahogany color, white head with some nice lacing that settles fairly quickly. Smells very sweet, maybe pears, faint hints of vanilla. Taste is an ever so faint hop note, with a peaty feel to it. Mouthfeel is a bit over carbonated. Very low abv makes it easy to drink a few of these. I've had other Irish ales that i like better, but it's a solid brew."
"Thanks bort11 for your generousity. Pours a tan yellow with a foaming white head. Beery cheese aroma. Toast in there and on bitter side, not getting too much malt and no hint of recognition of a 5-malt complexity, metal in the finish. Aggressive carbonation,not bad but oh so dry Irish.Thanks again Tim!"
"I look forward to this ale all year long. I have to get my fill because after spring, ZON comes out, and I'm not a fan."
"D - drinks nice and tasty yet light. A session beer anyone?"
"I had to work late on St. Patrick's Day, so I had two of these when I got home from work. Poured a copper/red color. There wasn't much of a smell, but what smell there was came across as malty. The taste was malty with only a slight amount of hops. I haven't had a ton of Irish Red Ales, but this one tasted good to me. I would definitely try it again."
"Nice deep red color with decent foam. Smell was a little funky -- toasty malts, but also picked up a mossy, overly earthy smell too. Sweet, bready taste, but what really does it for me is the hint of citrus and bitterness from the hops to go along with the malt flavors. Nice job."
"A nice pour from the bottle produced a frothy, cream-colored head settled on a dark amber body. Not much aroma from this, just some malt. Taste is of semi-sweet malt with some light hoppiness in the finish and a bit of a toasted flavor. A medium-bodied beer that is simple in style and very drinkable."
"A nice beer - definitely a good St. Patrick's Day choice far exceeding the traditional brews served up, but nothing to go out of the way for."
"Yet this isn't the equal of Three Floyd's brilliant Brian Boru, not close. Nor is it close to Boulevard's Bully! Porter. A good, steady beer, certainly, and not one to turn down. Just not in the upper strata."
"pours a dark reddish color with a big opaque head. smell isn't very strong, some malty characters and some biscuit aromas. taste is pretty good though, has a lot of interesting malt flavors, one of the better irish ales, most of them seem kinda bland, but this one is pretty good, and only a few days till st.pattys day!"
"I'm really enjoying this style. It's like a sweeter pale ale and much more smooth with the malt presence. I easily enjoyed a couple of these one evening. I could also easily persuade myself to buy another six-pack. I keep coming back for a whiff; it's really pleasing."
"Pours out a rusty orange-red with middling carbonation and a pretty, thick head atop. Leaves some thick lacing. Smells of sweet malts and a good deal of toasty crystal. Lot's of fruity esters going on that I tend to associate with Boulevard. There's kind of a tinge of piny hops. Taste is sufficiently malty with a good bit of toastiness. There's the fruitiness here which reminds me of fruity bubblegums. There's a bit of that ""beyond-toasted"" malt character that I get from Fat Tire and much of the New Belgium line here which almost gives off the effect of cocoa powder. Slight medicinal flavors. Bit of pine hop in the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate to light in weight and extremely creamy. Drinkability is OK. I really didn't like this beer right off, but as I work my way through the 6 pack over the course of a couple weeks, I find myself liking it more."
"With such a low abv you could drink this all day, but i would probably choose something else.. wouldnt turn it down if it was handed to me though. Decent brew, nothing extraordinary"
"D - This is a tasty Irish Red and perhaps one of the better beers that I've tried from Boulevard. I'd certainly pick this up again 'during the season o' the Irish'."
"Poured into tumbler. Dark amber with a 1"" head that quickly breaks into a thin layer leaving some lacing. Smells of toffee and maybe candy corn. Not a lot of hops, malty and smooth all the way through, caramel, wood, sweet with very slight bitterness at the finish. Not the best red ale I've had, but pretty good."
"Had on tap in a Boulevard Pint Glass. Pours a dark coppery orange with a slight tan head that dissipates into a thin layer that leaves just a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma isn't out of this world. Pretty basic with a big caramel sweetness finishing with citrus hops that gives it the sensation of smelling orange rinds. Taste is much the same with a malty presence the melds into the hops. It's not as sweet as the nose would have you believe. My biggest problem is that there is a slight metallic taste to it. Mouthfeel is a bit thin I think. I think that they could have done a bit more with the beer."
"D: This beer is good, but flawed. Good for someone who likes dry, hoppy ales--as I do--but lack of malt body and watery palate preclude greatness. Great session beer though."
"This is a good example of the style from Boulevard. Irish Reds are a style I can't really get to excited about but this would be a good beer to drink if you were sitting down for a game or in a more social situation where more than a few would be consumed in a night. Thanks Vance!"
"d: A good brew from Boulevard, not one of their best, but its pretty good. Irish ale is an above average, though not spectacular, irish red."
"Buy this six pack."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color. The head is medium sized and fades away pretty quickly. Smells bready and yeasty. Taste is malty, buttery, and slightly toasty. There is also a nice earthy taste from the hops. The bitterness levels are nice as well. Mouthfeel is good, with smooth carbonation. Very drinkable, it would be easy to drink several of these."
" Very drinkable I think. I could see this being a session choice with some frequency if it were sold here."
"Draught: This one pours a fairly clear, amber color. there was a bit of a head on it, and it left some lacing down the glass. The aroma was a bit light. What was there was pleasant, with notes of roast and a bit of caramel. It does taste pretty good. Taste is slightly caramel malt sweet, with a hint of roastiness. Hint of hops providing a nice balance."
"Overall: Not my favorite beer nor my favorite Boulevard brew, still this is a decent beer from a brewery which makes several good brews."
"An easy drinker, but it's pretty average stuff, close in vibe to your everyday average brown or amber ale."
"A very smooth yet tasty drinker...I've had this many times before and I was surprised to find that I hadn't reviewed it yet. I think this is a top notch example of the style and I *believe*, my favourite to date. Very well done, Boulevard!"
"Thanks to Bort11 for the trade. Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date of 5/1/07 lasered on the neck into a pint glass. It was a clear reddish color. It had a couple finger head that settled into a thin film during the session. Good carb. The aroma was a little muted but had good malt backbone and slight toasted smell. The taste was good, not spectacular but nice easy drinking kinda beer. Mouthfeel was good. Overall, it's a good session type beer that quenches the thrist with above average taste. Recommend if you can easily get. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"D - Good stuff. Nothing memorable or outstanding, but it's a fine lower-abv session beer. A good session choice for St. Patty's day if you are bored with Guinness, Killians, and Bud Light in green aluminum bottles."
"Pours a deep, clear, reddish brown color with a small, quickly disappearing white head, and small amounts of lacing on the glass. Aroma is of sweet malt, and a bit of fruit. Taste has a nice sweetness, and a bit of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and this is an easy drinker. Nothing too spectacular, just a solid red."
"I'm much more impressed with the final few ounces than I was with the first few. Whether the improvement was due to warming or to the goodies at the bottom of the bottle, I couldn't say. Boulevard Irish Ale still can't touch Great Lakes Conway's Irish or Three Floyds Brian Boru, but it's damn good beer all the same. I'll be sure to look for it again next March."
"A fine brew. If there's one thing Boulevard's good at, it's making palatable beers that even newbies can enjoy, and this is a perfect example. A great session beer and a great crossover beer."
"Far from an overmalted watery brew it's a malt-driven but balanced brew, easy sipping for a German (Mai)Bock fan or any other malt-mouth, the funky apple yeast flavor that emerges will please Belgian fiends, and lovers of local/craft beer will appreciate the midwest TLC applied to this classic style. Cheers, KC, best beer brewed."
"D - Very drinkable session beer. I actually enjoyed it more at a colder temperature...as it warmed, the body seemed to thin out, but still a great Irish Red."
"Boulevard Irish Ale was a clear red-brown color with good clarity and a light tan head. The head was a good inch thick and had good retention and lacing. The aroma was sweet caramel malt. The taste was malty upfront with some nice hop flavor towards the dry finish. It was medium-light in body with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a nice session beer that I look forward to in the spring."
"Nice little pop of alcohol at 5.3abv%, a smooth drinker that warms the cockles on a snowy Feb. day."
"Nothing spectacular, just good, fresh local beer."
"This year's batch seems a bit bolder than what I remember of last year's. Good stuff. I know spring is coming soon when these hit the shelves"
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Almost clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Starts almost sweet maybe caramel, clean finish. Hints of hops in aftertaste. Best by May 1, 2006. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"Drinkability: Good enough, but I don't think I'd drink more than one. Not really my kind of thing."
"This brew pours a clear blood red color. The head is huge, fluffy, reddish off white in color, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is very faint, but some fruity sweetness and caramel can be detected with a lot of work. The taste is sweet with enough fruity esters to add some complexity. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good Irish red ale that I can see myself buying again."
"Better than Killian's but there are much better brews out there. Of course I have to say I like over hopped beers so one whould take that into account when reading this review."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It's a bit sweet with a dry, bitter hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a dry, roasted flavor that boasts of crystal malts and roasted barley. It has a mild hop bitterness and a dry finish. The yeast seems to give it an overly dry flavor. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a decent brew. I think I may have aquired an older bottle, hence the overly dry and carbonated feel."
"Pours out a reddish, copper color. Maybe a two finger head. It leaves some lace as you drink it. The beer is very typical of an Irish Ale, hoppy and slightly bitter. It goes down very smooth. Goes great on St. Patrick's day, if you don't have any Guinness or Harp on hand."
"Dvery drinkable, I wish I had discovered this a long time ago, a very solid red ale that could be a nice session brew"
"pours out of the 12 ounce stubby bottle a less than clear dark auburn colour, with an off white frothy head. sticky lace makes it a looker. citric aroma, some subdued fruity maltiness, too. toasty maltiness backed by a touch of fruit and floral hoppiness. makes for an easy drinking session ale. body is quite light and refreshing; the mouthfeel is slightly prickly but otherwise soft and smooth. this is a nice, unoffending red ale. refreshing, tasty and just perfect for spending st. patricks day at home."
"Drinkability: Very easy to pack these away. Low alcohol content makes this an excellent sessioner, on that I am likely to have again on St. Patty's day."
"Gotta say, this is one brew that wasn't as good on-tap for me. Seemed a bit too thin and lacked the complexity of flavor that the bottled version had. Still a pretty good seasonal from Boulevard that's worth trying."
"Appearance has a smooth creamy tan caramel tan head body is amber red leaves even thick chunks of lacing. Aroma contains caramel malt sweetness with pine cone scented hops definitely hoppier than the average Irish Red, which is a plus in my book. Taste has upfront malted wheaties sweetness touch of caramel creamy tone altogether with a mild bitterness but complex piney hop flavor. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied mildly carbonated very smooth with each sip. Drinkability is very nice all around definitely better than many other beers of this style, go Irish this March with Boulevard's take on the style."
"I'd hoped for better. Too strong a hop presence for my liking in this style."
"Very nicely balanced, nothing overdone. Very smooth and extremely easy to drink. One of the best ""Irish Ales""."
"12 ounce bottle. Best by 05/01/05. Thanks to BIF20 and jimdkc!"
"Pours a sexy brown amber with a tan headskie. Something striking about this brew... Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Wow, what drinkability, but I havn't even gotten to the flavor yet. Tastes good. Haha, yeah, that's the simple truth. Nice full flavor is simple yet subtile and it works! A nice ale."
"This one pours an amber color with a medium head that has nice retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly sweet and has a buttery thing going on. The flavor has a strong caramel backbone with a much stronger hop presence than the aroma would tell. Fairly large in body and easy to drink. Nothing wonderful, but a very nice offering for the style."
"Purchased from John's Grocery in Feb 2005 and consumed that same evening. Reviewed from notes. Pours a 1/2 finger tan head over a red brown liquid. Smells chocoaltey sweet and lightly of coffee. Tastes lihglty chocolate with some coffee, too. Flavors are quite mild and some stornger malt sweet would have added a playful dimension. Medium mouthfeel, which is a surprise, as I've found Boulevard products to usually lack in this characteristic. A bit overcarbonated but all in all an enjoyable beer."
"This beer pours a nice rubied amber color with a nice coat of head over top. The nose is caramel and slight diacetyl with a spicey hop. Interesting. The flavor is a little better than the nose. The hop is more dominant, with not a very prevalent buttery character. The caramel malt comes in on the end. I like it. The feel is nice and thick, with a moderate carb. I'm impressed with this beer. One of the better Irish beers I've had in a while."
"The taste has a certain fullness and balance. Just a hint of tartness at the finish. Certainly drinkable and well above the reds and limp Irish beers I tend to see available. Just not as much of a stand out as the other BLVD beers."
"Bravo Boulevard, Bravo!"
"The taste was quite redeeming of the smell, though it seems somewhat subdued. Initially the taste is of roasted barley and wheat malts, caramel, and the perfect balance of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth. Also, this is the first beer I can remember drinking recently with an ABV under 5: thus, I could drink these all night. This beer is an awesome balance between huge taste and low alcohol. I will probably buy more before the seasonal stock runs out."
"Pours a dark mahogany color and had a tan head that did not stick around. It has a very sweet malty aroma and a touch of hops in there too. The flavor is really balanced and refreshing. Quite complex actually, way above my tasting skills. But from a pure enjoyment standpoint, it is just plain good. Worthy of any true beer lover's refrigerator."
"Pours a dark red hue, wwith a big creamy off-white head. Very beautiful color. Smells of roasted malt, and sweet carmel scents, with some floral hops in the background. Taste is very sweet at first, then tart, then those flavors fade to reveal a roasted malt backbone that really works well with it's final transition, into adequate hops presence. Very good, well rounded, with a flavor that I could sip all night."
"Deep copper in color, with an off-white head that fluffs itself up and lasts for quite some time. There's even some patchwork quilt lacing on the glass. Impressive. Aromas are toasted grains and dark druit. There's even some spicy character to it. Flavor is balanced. Sweet malty flavors mix nicely with the hops, aided by a dash of doughy yeastiness. Finishes with a caramel-nut aftertaste. Good session beer."
"More kudos to the Huge one."
"A very tasty irish red ale, with an intriguing, almost belgian flair. This is my first Boulevard beer, and the folks in Kansas City have a good thing going. Unique and interesting. I could drink these all day."
"Body is lighter side of medium...this is nothing to jump up and down about but it is a pretty tasty, low ABV, easy drinking , session-style beer....I rate drinkability as a 3.0 because while it IS easy drinking, it's not one I would be dying to drink again....that is what I consider ""drinkability"""
"I took some of this to a family gathering, and even the macro drinkers liked it!"
"Overall, a good, balanced amber ale. Big thanks to bditty187 for this gem!"
"Pours to a reddish color and permanent head. Aroma is roasty and malty with apple notes. Flavor is malt dominant, earthy and balanced with tangy hops. Finishes malty and warm. This is a very good red ale, so good in fact that, in Oklahoma at least, it is a $1.00 more per sixer!"
"Kinda boring, but adequate, drinkable, sure, but passable. Give me that Red Rocket by Bear Republic instead, thats my kind of Red!"
"Fully dark oxidized copper color, clear. Sugary head of decent staying power. Slightly dripping ring lace. Briefly malty aroma, with a sprightly orange slice candy touch. Nice beginning, braodly sweet with caramel tones, good medium mouthfeel, and a bit of wintergreen. Finishes a bit thinned in impression, with just a bare re-inforcement of minty hoppiness. Slighlty warming in the throat. No real problems with the beer, the mid mouth fall-off is the biggest miss. I'd drink it again."
"Clear burgandy/scarlet red appearance. Head is thin and creamy. And retention adequate. Nice toasted tones on the nose as well as some roasted malt and nuttiness. Some slight toasted malt hits the palate first and is followed by a roasted bitterness and dry hop finish. Nuttiness is quite subtle and caramel notes lay in the background. The body is about medium full. A quaffable Irish Ale it is."
"This brew is a brown color with some red hints, big tan head topping off the brew. Nice smell, some fruits, dominate the nose, with some hops/malt peeking through. The first thing i notice with regards to the taste is how well it is balanced, nice hop bitterness counteracting the malts, some nuts and fruits showing through as well. This beer outperformed my expectations, and is worth try in my book."
"One of the better ""Irish ales"" I've ever encountered. Great thanks to marc77 for sending it!"
"Deep clear- amber in color, has a nice white head that doesn't last very long, light malty bready aroma. Sweet caremel malty flavor, mild hop profile it does have a nice clean dry finish, medium body, seems kind of bland, overall not all that bad but average."
"Acquired via trade. Pours a beautiful rich dark amber color with a frothy medium beige head. Aroma is pleasantly toasty and malty. Full sweet malt flavor with a touch of hops and caramel. Finish is sweet and rich. Not bad at all. Boulevard has a pretty respectable line of beers from what I can tell so far."
"This is an all around good beer! Pours dark copper color with an off white head that sticks around for awhile, leaving a lot of lace in the glass. First sip was great, really refreshing. It has a nice malty sweet taste to it with a nice lingering sensation in the mouth. Had it out of a keg, not sure how similar the bottle is, but after drinking this I decided I had to go out and get some more. Great seasonal brew!!"
"A very drinkable beer from Boulevard. It is mellow without being bland."
"Boulevards spring seasonal, available Mid-Jan through mid-April. Irish Ale pours a beautiful, deep, burnt orange color with an amazing, nitro-like head of tan, tiny-bubbled foam, creating a sheeting blanket of lace down the sides of the glass. The head lasts forever... The nose is very understated, but a vigorous swirl reveals a slight, roasted malt character. The super-smooth, velvety body feels like nitro, but without the helium aftertaste. The taste is pretty nicemalty, without being roasty or thick, and still quite fresh tasting, like recently cracked malt. With the obligatory, low hopping rate, this beer tends toward a bit of sourness in the finish, but not too much. Also, this beer is sweetish, but not overly so. The hops make a very brief, herbal appearance in the middle of the flavor, and then recede again, forced into their minor role by the complex maltiness. I keep coming back to the smoothness of the body though. Its really extraordinary. If this isnt the perfect macro to micro transition beer, I dont know what is: sweetish, but not syrupy, barely hoppy, but not at all bitter, and easier and smoother to drink than proper Guinness. I really wish I had more of this stuff"
"Bronze, highlights of orangey-copper, creamy off-white head, dissipated quickly, laced well. Faint nose, gentle nuttiness and mild caramel notes, yeasty (acidic-fruity) at the end. Tasty! Mild caramely-sweet, malty, slightly nutty the hops are ideal, yeast is noticeable. Balanced, malt leads but the hops cannot be ignored. Finishes slightly acidic, sweetish, candy-like malt not sticky in the slightest, clean almost. What a smooth quaff. Off the charts on the ease to drink scale. Great seasonal beer for all your session drinking needs Id recommend it."
"A nice red ale. Always have liked the way this beer looks. Try pouring a glass full and hold it up to the light, I really love the color of this beer. After you do this 4 times it gives the world a rosy glow."
"Dark bronze / red hue. Clear w/ a dense head that leaves an intricate lace. Light, nutty caramel notes in aroma, followed by a subtle yeast fruitiness. Slightly sweet, toffee & biscuit malt notes in malt flavor. The well calculated hop bitterness provides sufficient balance for the malt sweetness, but lets overall malt flavors to dominate. There's a slight hint of Kent Goldings hop flavor, but that can be overlooked. Well balanced flavor profile all around. Medium bodied, w/ a very smooth and agreeable mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a touch of fading, clean dark caramel malt with hints of roasted grain. The overall balance of flavor & high drinkability make Boulevard's Irish Ale an excellent session beer."
