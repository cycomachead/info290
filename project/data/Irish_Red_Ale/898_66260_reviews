"Respectable red. Worth a try if you like a malty brew with a kicked up ABV"

"Picked up a bomber of this for $4.99. Red ales have always been one of my favorite styles of beer and this beer doesn't change that. Pours a nice dark red color, great mouthfeel and caramel malt backbone with just a perfect mix of hoppiness. Great all around beer, goes down very smooth and easy and finishes clean. For it's higher ABV it really drinks way too easy, the Heavy Seas line has been surprisingly good and this is definitely one of the better ones I've tried."
"This beer will not overwhelm your palate; nor will it grab your nose by the balls and squeeze. It can be described as a moderate selection from the Boys In Halethorpe,the Baltimore suburb that is home to the brewery. Yet, it is a decent quaff that possesses a strange crispness amid a nicely stuctured body of malt. Nice brew."
"This is probably one of the better Irish red's I've had. It's well balanced, easily drinkable, and offers more flavor than I'm used to for the style."

"O - A solid brew. Would like to try some others in this style."
"O: I like this beer. It's very drinkable and predominantly biscuity. I would have another. Totally recommended. The whole Mutiny Fleet is worthwhile."
"A nice above average beer that was highly drinkable. Not my favorite style of beer, but still well done and good enough that I enjoyed the whole bomber."
"Tasting the beer, up front there are the maplesyrup and brown sugar notes. In the middle grainy tastes and malt switches the palette. At the end a light bitterness finishes this very drinkable beer. Overall a nice beer, but Heavy Seas certainly made better ones."
"I was dubious about the classification of this, expecting it to be an American Red, but yeah, it's not hoppy enough, and to be honest, it's not very interesting at all. Very average."
"A dark maple syrup color with a decent light oatmeal colored head, this brew also shows a very solid lacing. The aroma gives off punky cider malt, even a nice hint of juniper or something sort of minty almost. The flavor at room temperature is much like the aroma except deeper and better. I get cider and peat, haystack herbal sweetness. I really like this taste and it’s very drinkable for an imperial brew at only 7 percent ABV. There’s maple syrup and brown bread ideas here. Nice stuff in a medium light brew with nice, fine carbonation and a somewhat aqueous feel."
"Strong, inviting aroma is malty, yeasty and spicy with just a whiff of hoppy wood. It pours a beautiful clear dark mahogany with a decent, if none too persistent, light tan head. Mouth filling malty flavor has spicy and earthy tones and just a hint of caramel. Texture is very smooth but has a respectable tingle to it. Aaaargh matey!"
"Glad to have tried it, and certainly cannot say this is a bad beer, it just not the most exciting beer I've ever had. Then again, red ales never have been one of my string favorites."
"Thin head, less than a finger of deep tan foam, mixture of bubble sizes, dissipates with ease, the lacing is wispy, however, sticks in fairly wide streaks. Deep amber red color with a mild metallic orange tinge at the glass, a few meandering bubbles as well as tiny particulate matter. While the nose has a hoppy spine of grass, herbs and pepper, it mostly expresses chocolate, cake crumbs, carob, caramel and grilled nuts, soft touch of fig, cherry, blackberry fruit scents, not especially citrusy nor flowery. Full-bodied, the carbonation may be too fine to do more than lift it just off the tongue. Tends to layer itself on the palate, does have a slight mineral water aspect to balance out the caramel, butterscotch, milk chocolate and coffee candy aspects, never gets excessively sweet although you’re unlikely to call it dry too. Here you get a clearer expression of white grapefruit to orange citrus. Challah bread, scone and lower nuttiness, any toast or roast kept well in check. Fig, apricot, peach, cherry fruit, not as dark as delivered in the nose. Keeps that peppery bite, especially at the end. For its weight has good drinkability, maybe suffers from not taking more chances at forging a distinctive personality."
"Overall- Reminds me a lot of Smithwicks and I don't really taste the higher ABV good effort by Heavy Seas"
"The taste begins with a lot of the same; toasted and bready malty grains, caramels, toffee sweetness. As it warms there is some light earthy, almost metallic bitterness, which is rather unpleasant to be honest. The finish is pleasantly dry with some detection of mineral water flavors which adds a nice dryness. Overall this is nothing to write home about or seek out because of the generic flavors, especially because of the unnecessarily high ABV which inhibits further consumption. If I'm consuming something over 6 ABV it needs flavor, which this is lacking."
"o - Overall a good red ale that is heavy on the toasted and caramel malts. Worth trying if you like red ales."
"Pours a clean copper to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a faint, small maltiness. In the taste, a small, sweet malt and a bit watery. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry hint of caramel in the aftertaste. Quite mellow and watery, eh, label sold me on it."
"Overall this beer isn't as dry as many in the style but the robustness of the malt flavors makes up for that shortcoming. Not a traditional Irish Red but a nice beer nonetheless. Worth a shot."
"An imperial Irish red,every style is gonna get ""imperialized"" or barrel aged at some point I think.Poured with good clarity into an imperial pint glass a deep bronze color with a well defined one finger off white head.Carame and brown sugar notes mainly in the nose,there is a whiff of leafy hop but its not anything that really jumps out.Sweeter on the palate then it needs to be,big buttery caramel,brown sugar,and some alcohol sweetness,the leafy hop presence is masked for the most part from the sweet malty flavors.Not a bad beer if you like big sweeter malty ales,I thought it was ok but to one dimensional in its sweetness,it can be malty without being overly sweet."
"Pours a nice crimson-tinged amber color, with a thin off-white head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is lacking, with some caramel and fruity esters upfront, along with slight floral hops and biscuit malt in the backgound. The taste is similar with caramel and toasted bread notes initially, along with some fruity esters and biscuit, floral hops and a strong alcoholic finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thick and oily, and drinkability is hampered by the alcohol presence. Decent red ale, could use more malt depth and less evident alcohol though."
"Would give it a third try but not going to hunt for it."
"O: I've come to expect this sort of good quality beer from Clipper City and they have once again delivered with this Irish Red. Quite enjoyable and drinkable."
"Light copper with a dense off-white head with great retention and lacing, this is a good looking beer. The nose is malty with a mildly stale caramel malt along with some hops. It smells like a blend of English and American hops were used here, earthy and green with some fruitiness. The palate opens sweet, mildly chalky with some caramel and sugar sweetness. Sweet on the finish with soft carbonation, this has a nice hop flavor with pine and citrus. Solid stuff, it does strike me that this beer's suffering from a bit of an identity crisis."
"Shrug. This would probably be a good beer for someone just starting to drink craft beer, who doesn't want to drink anything too ""heavy"" or flavorful."
"D: A somewhat memorable Irish Red in a sea of otherwise forgettable ones. Clipper City hits its trademark ABV point of 7% while ensuring the alcohol never really takes center stage. Nicely balanced, sweet and malty, but I'd skip on purchasing another pint or a bomber in the future."
"Overall, a good red. I enjoyed the blend of hops and sweetness. It was very well balanced. I wouldn't have more than one and I wouldn't go out of my way to have one, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it's a pretty good beer. It had some pretty good malty flavors but wasn't overly sweet. It went down pretty easy and was an enjoyable beer to start off this St. Patrick's day evening."
"The sweet caramel malt is also prominent upon first taste, with a rich grain flavor resting in the back. There is a citrus-hop finish that is subtle enough to compliment the sweet malt characteristics. The beer is smooth overall, and very drinkable. Though there is nothing too complex about this Aarsh Ale, it is very enjoyable...especially on the eve of St. Patrick's Day."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A very easily drinkable beer. I enjoyed this one a whole lot and will pick up another bottle if I see it again in stores. My bottles was very fresh. It was sort of refreshing to have a red ale without being overwhlemed by sweet malts. The sweetness is there; it is just perfectly balanced with the hops and ethanol. This beer is definitely not an 'aarsh' hole."
"Drinkability: This is another decent offering from Heavy Seas. Their beers never blow me away, but are almost never bad."
"-Cheers"
"D: Very drinkable. Anyone in the immediate distribution area for Heavy Seas: Please consider this one for your St. Patricks Day brew!"
"D: a great march time/ st. Pattys day beer but nothing too amazing."
"Pours a deep copper with a fluffy but disappointingly short-lived hear. The aroma is roasty, with a nice reddish cherry edge. The flavor is a little too roasted, like they sacrificed taste for color - it's roasted but lacks a lot of deep malt flavor, and the hops are simply too light. The mouthfeel is extremely prickly."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a clear reddish/copper color with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is caramel and bready malt, and a bit of hops. It's a nice but weak aroma. The brew tastes like caramel and toasted malt, dark fruit and some hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit smooth and creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, the alcohol is well hidden and it goes down very easy. This bomber didn't last too long at all. I thought it was a decent enough beer."
"One of the first bottles I split with my friend this past week and a pretty impressive one for an irish red ale. Had the typical characteristics of an irish red ale, but it was richer, hoppier and had a smooth finish. Drinkablity was up there with the bests I've had in the style given it's isn't one of my favorite style. If your looking for a great red, this might be your beer."
"The flavor is great, very elegant with a creamy yet bubbly mouthfeel. The malt profile is clean and has a delightful finish. Reminds me a lot of a Twix bar with a crisply bitter and hoppy finish. A solid beer all around, as are most of the Mutiny Fleet offerings. Great balance, smooth malt, and crisp hoppy finish."
"D: This was an average strong red ale that was fairly tasty but not that clean. Body was only ok, but the alcohol was well hidden so at least it was really easy to drink. Not a bad beer, but definitely not impressive either."
"Pours an amber-red color with a moderate amount of off-white lacing. Fairly-good retention. The nose brings forward some caramel malts along with a bit of additional sweetness. Amber malt comes forward along with a touch of hops. Nothing too complex, but a good balance between hops, malt, and yeast. Mouthfeel is medium and hides the alcohol quite well. Some bitterness in the finish. Drinks really quite well. Solid effort."
"D - no major issues here. support local business!"
"These Mutiny Fleet beers are often hit or miss with me but I ended up really enjoying this one. The key was keeping that ABV on the lower side of the ""Imperial"" style, as 7% seemed about perfect for the fullness of the flavors and body here while still keeping this very approachable and drinkable. This one could have easily been a mess but kudos to Clipper City for showing some restraint. This was well done."
