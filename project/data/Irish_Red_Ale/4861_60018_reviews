"There's good crispness and smoothness in a light body that might barely reach medium.  It ends up a touch thin just into the end but keeps up well into the finish."

"O:  Really well done.  Picked this one up in Frankenmuth, MI, drank in New Hamburg, ON Aug 24th, 2014.   Well done and to style.  Went to the brewery in Frankenmuth, which is quite cool.  The beer is fresh, to style, and worthy of drinking!"

"This is the second time I have had this beer, and I was equally disappointed. Thankfully, I was not the one that brought this to the bottle share. The beer poured a dark red color with a very slight aroma that could best be described as metallic. The taste is also faint. Though there are some sweet malts present with a hint of bitterness, the taste does not create a strong impression. In the aftertaste, on senses the malts becoming somewhat sour but nondescript. In my personal notes, I wrote the word ""boring"" from the first time I sampled this beer. I would say that adjective still applies."
"Beer pours rust to copper with a fair amount of lacing. The aroma hints at some sweet malt flavors, perhaps honey or molasses. Unfortunately, none of these flavors make an appearance. The initial taste is metallic, gradually fading to a faint but unpleasant bitterness that lingers. Mouthfeel is standard for an ale. Red Sky starts promising, but ultimately comes up short."

"Overall, it's just not that great of a beer. Bad by no means, but the beer would be much better if it had more of an aroma to it, and didn't have that odd, unnatural tasting aftertaste."

"Drinkability is okay on this thing. It is easy drinking, but not much to the taste, so not sure you would want to drink much of this beer."

"This beer pours a bold, clear copper with no head or lasting lace. The aroma is caramel with some hints of wood and grass. The flavor leads off with caramel and nuts followed by bread crust and a mild hop bitterness. It's mouthfeel is light-medium, drier than most Irish reds. Frankenmuth Red Sky Ale is a decent beer, recommended."
"P.S. This is better when warm."

"O: A distinctly tart irish ale that's a welcome change of pace from the average."

"This beer poured out as a nice deep red color with a cream colored head on top. The smell of the beer has some roasted malt aromas as well as some sweet caramel as well. The taste of the beer is much like the nose, the toasted malts and the caramel come through with a nice crisp hoppy finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was carbonated nicely with a decent body to it. Overall I found this one to be pretty good."
"Rusty red color, hazed over, though the topping of head is impressive. Hint of caramel in the nose with some maraschi- no cherry, toasted bread and a bit of yeast. Super smooth, medium bodied. Twang from the yeast fades quickly, and a toasted malt sweetness comes forth. Hops are modest but aim for balance. Fruity and yeasty in the middle. Maltiness stays clean and runs from sweet to toasted, to mildly biscuity. Malty finish lands semisweet. It is what it isâ€”a malt bomb of sorts, and a damn good rendition of an Irish Red Ale at that."

"Overall I was pretty unimpressed with this brew and I thought it was slightly below average. As a whole this beer was very one dimensional, it was pretty much all malts, it needed some hops to balance out all the malts. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, besides being a little too fizzy it was pretty spot on. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor, it was a one trick pony that only offered a bland malt flavor and nothing else. The lack of flavor hurts the drinkability a lot, yes I could drink another one, but with hardly any flavor to look forward to why would I want to. I wouldn't buy this beer again, there are many other better Red Ales easily available to me that I would much rather have then this bland attempt at the style, I'll take Samuel Adams Irish Red any day over this beer, I also wouldn't recommend this to anyone. This is a miss from The Frankenmuth Brewery and so far my least favorite beer I have had from them and the worst Irish Red Ale I have had to date. You guys may want to stick with the German styles cause this isn't working."
"Interesting Amber ale that is a Summer session ale in my book. Especially if you palate enjoys teh more tart side of the taste spectrum."
"Overall: I really like this beer. It's nothing special, but it's a good beer for the style and perfect for sipping on while it's warm out."
"O: Thin on flavor. One and done."
"D- A very solid take on the style, although it is not very memorable. Drinks nicely."
"Not a bad brew. On another day, I might have given this a better score...but as I said, not a bad brew."
"To me the only thing that makes this red a red is the color if you gave me a pint with a blind fold on I wouldn't know it wasn't a brown, there is just no hop that I am used to coming in a red ale..."
"Overall, a decent nutty red. Nothing special...but a really sweet (but expensive) growler."
