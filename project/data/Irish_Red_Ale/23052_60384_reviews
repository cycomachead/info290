"O - Not terribly interesting. A little to sweet, but that could make it a great gateway beer for people who aren't into craft brews."

"O- tasty easy to drink red in a pint can with around 5% ABV liked this one"

"Solid red ale. Good balance and descent flavor. Easy to drink also."

"Drinkability: I do not have much experience with Irish red ales, so I cannot comment on how the beer fits the style. Overall, though, it is too sweet for my taste. It is far from my favorite Great River beer."

"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Would go well with roasted corn, salsa, spaghetti with a tomato sauce. Might even be very good to put into a tomato sauce."

"Overall: Another solid beer from Great River! Riminds me of Fat tire, but I prefer the Roller Dam Red. Its worth you time! Convience of a can and priced great at 7.99 a 4pk of tall boys."
"O= This is a pretty fun beer. The malt flavor is unique to me and unlike anything I've ever had. I'll be buying this again for sure."
"O: While I'm not blown away by this beer, it is pretty good. Its relatively low ABV makes is very easy to drink, and a solid session brew. I'll be returning to this one from time to time."

"Not what I want in a red ale, but definately well crafted. I will go back to their pale ale for sure. I see this is classified as an Irish Red instead of an American Red. Not sure how I feel about that since it is brewed with Sterling hops and American yeast."
"Overall: I bought a 4 pack of 16 oz cans for $6.29. A bit pricey IMO but I wanted to give this a try as I liked the name and like to find good craft beer in a can. An enjoyable beer and well worth trying."
"O: A very drinkable, sessionable ale that I was pleasantly surprised with."
""

"I actually rather like this one-there's not much special to it, but it's an easy drinking irish red with just enough malt character to make it special. I could knock back a few of these for sure."
""
"Pours red-amber with a short-lived head that dissipates leaving no lacing. Smell was earthy, Lipton tea. Taste is subtle sweetness, but primarily tea leaves and biscuit-malt. A noticeable hop oil bitterness comes in late around the edges of the tongue. Bitterness lingers. Medium mouthfeel, but lower than expected carbonation. Not great, but drinkable.. I did enjoy their IPA a bit more."

"O- Ok beer. Fairly easy to drink it well balanced for a amber."
"And again, mouth feel is a little bit of an issue. I would really enjoy this one being much creamier and just sliding over the tongue."
"overall i am very impressed and this could be a regular session ale and one to introduce new people to craft beer"
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice flavorful beer with some substance making it worth drinking for a long time."
"O: A nice English style amber; nothing crazy here but flavorful and subtle"
"Thanks again to cpolking for sending this beer. This beer rushed out of its can and produced an amber color with a 1.5 inch head. Smell is of caramel malts. Taste is also malty, a touch of hops, slightly sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"D/O- Thirst quenching...to say the least. I want more hops in my red...to say even more. I guess that'd no longer be and Irish Red but still, my preference. This would be a good ""local"" go-to sessionable beer for me as I'm enjoying it thoroughly."
"O - This beer as real drinkable and is a solid red ale."
"This pours dark amber and has underwhelming head/lacing/retention. There is a nice dark toasty malt flavor that finishes off pleasant and bready, I can even taste a sweet grain/almost corn flavor. There is no sourness that is sometimes seen in Red Ale. I enjoyed this representation of the style. The drinkability is great, and probably the highlight."
"O: A fine example of the style, and a really nice beer. This beer begs to be paired, and I'm thinking that Irish Stew would be a good choice-- no strong flavors to compete between the two. Will need to test that theory the next time the weather is cold enough. Kudos to the folks at Great River for another tasty brew."
"light amber pours with a huge head of white that came up a full three fingers in height. Smooth settling left a good bit of side glass lace and a nice and even coating across the top of the glass. Interesting aroma as it started out with a nice and well rounded bready malt that seemed to slowly evolve into a grassy, herbal hop profile with a bit of a kick from the caramel. Did not seem to have a clear direction, but the taste made up for it nicely. Very smooth, nice caramel and malty tones that won me over with ease. Smooth even flavor, crisp, clean and well balanced. Smooth notes of grassy bittering hops coming in at the finish gave it a nice little drying effect and warmed it up. Very drinkable as it went down smooth and left me looking for more right away."
"M - Not too much to say here. Good carbonation, pretty average mouthfeel. Quite drinkable."
"Poured from 16 oz can into that ol' trusty shaker glass. Poured a nice amber color with a very small whiteish head that quickly disapated. Aromas of malt, caramel, and something I can't quite put a finger on. Taste was sweet malt and caramel with no hop bitterness. Quite quaffable; I could do this one as a session beer and would definitely have this again on draft."
"Verdict: Good enough, but not great. Try it if it's cheap."
"This style is usually one of my least favorites, but I really enjoyed this beer. From the few beers I've had from Great River Brewery, I have had a good experience with every one of them, and am looking forward to their other offerings."
"Nice medium bodied brew, somewhat complex with a hint of a powdery dryness. A surprisingly warm finish for a brew with a lower ABV."
"Would I buy more of it? - St. Patrick's Day is about 4 weeks away. Time to load up..."
"Received a can of this one last night from my friend Schmittymack. Thanks Dan. Had this one late Saturday afternoon, before dinner. Poured a nice amber color with a medium white head. Aromas of caramel malt and woody hops. Nicely balanced, medium bodied, with flavors of sweet malt, woody hops and caramel/toffee."
"D: Really quite drinkable, but simply nothing fantastic. 4"
"Drinkablility: Overall a well done Irish Red that fits the profile well."
"Roller Dam Red Ale is dam(n) fine beer if you like red ales that have perfect malt-hop balance. The recent change in Iowa law allowing higher ABV beer to be brewed was great, but RDRA would've been possible back in the bad old days of 2008. Good job Great River. And keep 'em coming."
"Notes: A nice, although fairly typical, Amber/Red ale. Plenty of toffee and nutty flavors with some caramel. Sweet maltiness, but nothing too overboard. Another good, not great, offering for the brewery. Great options for getting a canned beer and for introducing people to craft beer. Worth picking up and trying."
"Love the Crack & Glug! Beer as an auditory pleasure in addition to everything else. My pour netted just over a finger of light-tan head that burbled, bubbled, exploded with CO2 and phased itself out of existence. Red? Like a coppery amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a sweet, malty, raspberry-like quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a very sweet caramel taste on the tongue. Phew! I am not a fan of sweet beers, but anything in the interest of the quest. Finish was bittersweet with a light metallic tang. Bottom line for me was that it was simply too sweet for this self-avowed hophead to want to drink on a routine basis."
"Rich maltiness, fruity raisin and plum again, possibly from the ale yeast. Drying aftertaste of molasses. Bready with Crystal malt caramel sweetness. Not all that bitter, though the can states 30 IBUs. Fairly big malt flavors, and light bodied, making for an easier session. Well made and full of flavor, still it could use a touch more hops to make it really great."
"3.85 - O: I'm glad I stumbled upon this beer in desporation while out of town on business. I'll be sure to be on the lookout for other offerings the next time around."
