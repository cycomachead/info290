3.85,9.1,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Amber pour with a nice red hue. Very nice head and lasting lacing. Nose is of toast, nut and caramel sweet malt. Light bodied with medium carbonation. The flavor profile is a laid back blend of malt flavors that ends up being nicely complex and balanced. Like the nose, toast, nut and caramel float over a slight sweetness. The finish is smooth and at the end, Goldings are detected. A solid red ale.","tillmac62","Jan 08, 2014"

3.95,11.9,4.25,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours murky caramel brown, with a thin 1 finger khaki head that sits for a minute. I like the look of this Irish red more than others I've had. Very earthy aroma with some citrus notes of orange. Also a lot of sweet wheat bread. The sweetness carries over in the taste. Most of the citrus is gone, replaced with caramel and more of that breadyness. Mouthfeel is quite wonderful, very easy to drink, and very thirst quenching on a hot day. I am always weary of this style, not a fan by any means. This however, I like a lot. It does seem more of a American take on a Irish red, but regardless this is a great beer.","screamking","Jul 29, 2013"
3.44,-2.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I have found the Thirsty Dog brewery to be somewhat inconsistent, and this beer is certainly one of their better choices. Hop presence is just about absent, but there's plenty of roasted malt, caramel, butterscotch, and nut in the nose and on the tongue. The smell is sweet, and the taste is too, but not as sweet, and that's a good thing. For a beer with a relatively thin mouthfeel and modest ABV for the style, the flavors are bold and the beer is relatively complex. I liked the malt flavors, but I also recognize that the beer could be better with more hops and a bit less sweetness. It goes down easy and the mouthfeel is smooth and not sticky despite the sweetness in the taste, but it's just a touch too thin.","DeFaz","Jul 09, 2013"

3.88,9.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of crystal and biscuit malts. It has a sweet caramel aroma with a mild bread-like character. The taste is good. It has a smooth crystal malt sweetness with a dry roasted malt finish. It goes down incredibly easy with tons of malt character, yet only a hint of residual sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good red ale. It appears to be overly complex (aroma), yet it stays in check and drinks well.","WesWes","Jul 09, 2012"
3.4,-3.7,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Sweeter flavor than the smell suggests. There's a berry flavor to this brew. Again, there's no notable hop. The body is watery with a high level of fine bubbles (so, it isn't too soda pop-ish).","smcolw","Apr 28, 2012"

The Irish Setter poured a clear red amber with sligthly off white head that left some lacing. Mostly malt on the nose with touch of sweetness. The taste carried a caramel malt base with some hop balance. The mouthfeel was light to medium body with good carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer.","WoodBrew","Jan 01, 2012"

3.5,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Aroma is of light caramel, roasted nuts, light touches of butterscotch like sugary notes. Warming brings out a very earthy and pronounced flavor to it. Really nice done but a touch light. This is my only complaint as it did not have the pop I was really looking for at the time. Smooth, even flavor really did not deviate much from beginning to end as the overall impact was nicely put together.","mikesgroove","May 22, 2011"
3.11,-11.9,4,3,3,3.5,3,"O- A disappointing Irish Ale. A little bland, not overly medicinal tasting but the taste is definitely there.

3.53,0,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had a bottle at Liberty St Tavern with a slice of pizza. Overall, this was a simple and smooth red ale with a velvety caramel bread character and medium body. It wasn't too thick, like some Irish reds, there was just enough balancing bitterness so the hops weren't too sweet. Just a fine pizza beer.","tempest","Mar 12, 2011"
3.47,-1.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear copper/red color with about a half inch off-white head that went away pretty quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is caramel and bready malt. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all malt. I don't notice any hops in either the aroma or taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and easy enough to drink. It's a decent brew, it's not one of the best Irish Red Ales I've had but I still think it's worth a try.","bluejacket74","Mar 11, 2011"
3.48,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a dark caramel color burgundy amber brown color with a nicely formed off white tan head, fine speckled lacing scattered evenly. Aroma is roasted malt, caramel amber malts, and a touch of nuttiness. Flavor wise it's clean as far as hops go maybe a bit of underlying earthiness from the low hopped East Kent Goldings. Flavor is full of caramel breadiness all malt not filler here, solid drinking Irish Red. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with even carbonation light drinking complex Irish Red style ale from Akron. Drinkability overall is solid the type of beer that does well for the micro craft community during drunken holidays like St. Paddy's Day.","WVbeergeek","Mar 06, 2011"
3.41,-3.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pretty to look at, there's not much taste to this beer. That's not bad if you're looking for a forgettable session beer, but not so much if you want a tasty craft-brew.","TheHoppiest","Mar 02, 2011"
3.88,9.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"On-tap at Winking Lizard, this was their glass-of-the-month selection. Poured a dark, brick red. A tan ring laced the glass. Smell was rich and malty, with a hint of bitterness. Taste was big and caramely, nicely balanced malty sweetness and a pleasing bitter base. Feel was smooth as a caramel too. Drinks well, a good brew.","sixerofelixir","Sep 23, 2009"
3.8,7.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured a nice deep amber with an aroma of roasted malt and subtly floral hops. Flavor is a fairly typical but well-executed red ale, full bodied without being heavy with medium dark caramel overtones and a clean hop finish. The mix of interesting but not heavy-handed flavors makes for a very drinkable beer.","HeightsEats","Mar 15, 2004"

3.23,-8.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"This is a very nicely crafted beer with just a bit too much caramel malt sense to be considered a top offering. The nose is definitely caramel malt with little else impressing. The look is a reddish amber with an ivory head and decent lacing. There is grain in the finish but little hop sense is noticeable. Creamy with too little carbonation to put crispness in the feel. Good effort and enjoyable, but the style has better representatives - a lot better.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 08, 2001"
