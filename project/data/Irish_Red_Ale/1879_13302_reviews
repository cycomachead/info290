"Decent red ale, certainly highly drinkable, but neither is it among Garrison's better brews. Still, when it's consumed within sight of the harborfront, it adds a certain something to the experience."

"Overall: Good but not amazing."

"I tried one of these while on a vacation to their brewery in Halifax in August 2012. Compared to the few reds I've had, this was a pretty pedestrian offering; nothing offensive yet nothing to write home about. I found myself wishing I'd ordered something else instead and that's kind of disappointing."

"Overall - A standard Irish Red by Garrison. It hits the mark on some of the style's traits, such as dry finish and tea-like flavour, but otherwise does not offer much else new."

"O: One of my more enjoyable Garrison brews. It's very easy to drink and enjoy, but not lacking to much character."
"D - decent flavor, probably my least favorite so far by Garrison but still enjoyable."
"Overall. I liked this. Light and refreshing with nice hints of fruit."
"D - maybe not a session beer but could definitely enjoy a couple"
"This darker amber/red ale pours with a light skimming of a head. An aroma of nutty malts and earthy hops both stick out. Very small amount of carbonation is noted in the glass, but it is more noticeable on the tongue. A sharp bite. I find this to be an Irish Dry Red, if that is even a category, as that is how it leaves my mouth, sticky also. Overall, a typical beer for the price and for what I was expecting."
"O - Overall a tasty red ale with some ESB characteristics. Worth a try, but nothing spectacular."
"Sweet and somewhat generic, doesn't really stand out for the style."
"An Irish Ale with an identity problem - it maintains the big, enjoyable old-school malt base, but the other off-flavours, at times, push the low-rent local brew boundaries. Still easy enough to drink, I suppose, but certainly not all night."
"The red has a smooth finish and I could see this being drinkable. This was not one of my favorite irish reds by any stretch, but it is still a decent beer."
"If it was my university years again, a pitcher of this for me would be just fine at the pub. Pretty drinkable."
"Bottle: Poured a light red/amber color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and not much lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with light cereal notes and some residual sugar. Taste is also dominated by dry caramel malt with light sweet notes and no discernible hops. Body is a bit light with OK carbonation. Decent but a bit too bland to be truly interesting even as a session beer."
"D: Not terrible, but not very smooth. The odd things about this beer likely won't make me buy it again."
"not the best red ale I've had but nothing to be ashamed of either. thanks again Long813 for this one yet another worthy beer from the other side of Canada"
"Yep, this is infected. Mouthfeel is overly carbonated. Taste is pretty foul, with rotten fruit and cherries. Still some chocolate in there, but yea, this is a pretty nasty bottle. Shitty really on my end, since I'd have to travel 2,000 miles just to get another bottle. Very dissapointed. But all the other Garrison brews I had were terrific. So, cant get too mad about one bad apple."
"Not many microbreweries offer an Irish Red (and even less offer a *good* Irish Red). I had forgotten just how respectable this style can be when put in a capable brewer's hands. Garrison makes a number of solid beers in styles much more exciting than this, yet I think the Irish Red may just be my favourite of the bunch. Thanks ThatWineGuy!"
"341 ml bottle- A deep mahogany pour, with a creamy and beige off white cap. A malty and fruity nose. Mostly earthy malts with some caramel, red plum, some spices. Tastes of sweet malts, quite grainy, some fruity notes, a bit of spice. Creamy and malty finish. Good. Thanks Darlene."
"Enjoyed this on draft at The Rope Loft Restaurant in Chester, Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, overlooking the water. Dark red with scarlet edges when held in the light, thin off-white head leaves quickly, thin ring, minimal lace. Smells of fresh cut wood, balsa possibly, and some malt coming through. Good steady low carbonation. Thin body seems out of whack with malty flavours, a bit of molasses, malt front and centre with a bitter malt finish. Minimalist head regenerated easily with a swirl of the glass, small bubbles, smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a beer with good refreshment value that's just a bit intriguing as well."
"Poured with a nice little head but it died pretty quickly and left little lacing. Smelled decently, a good balance of malt and hops, but also a bit of lemon tea, which seems to be common for the Garrison beers I've tried so far. The taste followed suit, and while it's nothing exciting, I found it to be pretty solid and balanced. Mostly sweet malty/caramel flavour with a sort of tart bitterness, partly citric and partly coffee-ish. Mouthfeel and drinkability was fine, would not be hard to make this into a session beer."
"It's not a complex beer at all, but overall it's an easy-drinking and enjoyable beer."
"Pours a dark red-brown color with plenty of thick sweet head. Head stuck around for a while and left minor lacing on the glass. Scent consists of some sweet malts, which match the taste. Some roasty flavors at the end, as well as a somewhat creamy taste. Somewhat muted, but very drinkable overall. One of my favorite Garrison brews."
"Note: after having got this one from the Maritimes, I was able to try another sample at BeerFest. Now is readily available in Calgary. I will definatley have this one again."
"Rich chestnut body with a smooth, creamy tan head - definitely looks the part. Laces quite well. Aroma is dominated by sweet malts, along with a light fruitiness. Nice light caramel flavour, with decent levels of breadiness and fruit in the background. Medium-light body and medium carbonation. Very drinkable and good for the style."
"Garrison's website has a fair bit of info on all their beers, but I was surprised to see they labelled the bitterness as low for this beer; it certainly stands out for me."
"Still fairly drinkable, just wish i could of had a clean sample. Perhaps another day..."
"Notes: Very conservative brewing for a microbrew. Nothing wrong with conservative but you have to hit the marks if you go for an easy drinking brew and this one misses. So far I'm dissapointed in the local offerings. A night out at Taps located downtown hopefully will change my mind overall."
"Taste is mostly mellow with a light cramel and fruit sweetness, lots of malty sweetness and a definite peppery bite. Cellarlike damp eath flavour comes through as well, and a light floral note. There's a bit of acidic sourness to balance it out a bit, or else I think it might be too sweet, but it's not bad. Medium body with medium carbonation, light dryness, slides down quite easily. This is a decent example of the style and a sessionable beer to boot."
"Pours a clear red/orange, big fluffy off white head forms, settles down to a thin ring pretty fast, some lace spots. Smell is sweet and malty, caramel, sugar, citrus, floral hops, very fruity and yeasty, pretty decent. Taste is very sweet, caramelized sugar, tons of fruit, pineapple and pears, a bit plasticy, bready, bit of sourness, malty finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, little bit rough and prickly. Not too bad, nothing spectacular, but I enjoyed drinking this. Thanks Peter!"
"Far better than the Garrison Brown or Amber ales...still one dimensional but an all malt ale with subtle falvor and good drinkability."
"Arrives at my table a brilliantly clear and bright red, with a modest off-white head that is reasonably well retained and leaves some lacing for the first half of the pint. Smell is bright and fruity, will notes of strawberry, apricot, and pear dominating the malty profile. Taste is similar, with a very fruity base and little hop bitterness to balance its sweet and malty nature. Mouthfeel is slightly watery, but still decent and with nice carbonation, and drinkability is good. Not a bad offering."
"This beer is OK but it lacks the malt dimension of the Brown Ale, and has more of the off flavors. Kind of like mediocre homebrew."
"This is one-dimensional, grand cru level coriander, and water. Very watery, it owuld be nothing iwthout over-the-top coriander. Decent amber colour. Aggressive carbonation. Was unfinishable. Have had much better Maritime ales, bt a worthy experiment."
"The label calls this Irish Red Ale Draught - unpasteurized and all natural. The great joy of micro-brews is the absence of all that extra stuff. Pours out a dark amber/red with a small brown head that disappears quickly leaving a slight touch of lacing. Wonderful malt smell (I like that) that is reinforced in the mouth. Great aftertaste - strong and secure. Good beer. Drank two: the second one was great with a garden salad laced with bacon, spicy Hungarian salami and old cheddar. Good stuff."
