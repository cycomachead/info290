3.64,-0.8,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Single 330 ml bottle poured into a tulip. A rather dark ruddy brown with a huge frothy beige head that initially filled two-thirds of my glass before settling to leave a few dollops of lacing here and there. Aroma quite sweet and malty with a clear fruity overtone: Brown sugar, apples, apricot, faintly woody yeast. Less sweet on the palate and by my reckoning features less of a toffee pudding or cookie flavor than do many other Irish reds. More sour fruit, nut, and molasses character with some citrus iced tea and herb notes. Medium thin pale ale-like body with a dryish herbal finish in which I can detect some leafy hop. More hop character than is typical for the style. Quite crisp and refreshing if on the fizzy side.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 05, 2014"

Lots of sweet bready malt and toasty caramel. Mild spicy hop character. Fairly simple aroma, but for a 4.4% abv beer, it's relatively big and rich. Taste is similar. Considering the strength of the beer, there's lots of sweet caramel malt flavor and a good undercurrent of hops in the background. Carbonation is pretty low. Just a bit of prickliness. Kinda soapy. Finish is a bit mineral-ish, and the beer mostly dries out. It's a nice, low abv red ale with a mild hop character and rich malt. Easy to drink.","popery","Mar 10, 2013"

Flavor is really dry not even bready malt, kind of watered down cereal grains. A pretty big disappointment to me, based on what I paid for it. It looked like craft imported beer, but ended up mediocre import selections. Goes down smooth with bitter earthy finishing hops dry bitterness actually.

However, when it's there, it's loaded with nice stone fruit - cherries, peaches, nectarines, and some sweetness. Flavor is a different story. There's nothing there. As quickly as it hits your mouth, it's gone into a long and faint finish. Some saltiness, but not close to what's in the stout, and some hoppiness, but they instantly fade into this vibrantly colorless finish. Not worth tracking down.","SolomonGrundy","Aug 21, 2010"

I'm not trying to be a ""typical American"" here and need some monster ABV, but some nice flavor would be a good start.","womencantsail","Aug 12, 2010"
3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall there was nothing special about this beer however there rarely is with Irish Red's. A nice beer that likely benefitted a bit from the nitro-pour. Worth a shot.","glid02","Jul 27, 2010"
4.01,9.3,4,3,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Light amber, reddish color. Very mild aroma. Amazing taste and mouthfeel. Buttery biscuits, a little cherry and strawberry. The flavor is just on the cusp of caramel and toffee flavors. The hops are virtually unnoticeable till the finish. A slight wheat character comes through in the smell and taste. I could definitely see myself taking my time with this beer at a bar. Probably an excellent pairing with any sort of pub food.","Chaserr","Jul 18, 2010"
2.91,-20.7,4,3,3,1.5,3,"Drinks: incompletely. Porterhouse Red has a lot of malt complexity for such a mild beer. Were it not for the mouthfeel, I'd call this a very decent Irish Red. As it stands, however...meh.","Phelps","Jun 07, 2010"

3.53,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,4.5,"The body was typical for a nitro red, semi-full and smooth. Drinkability was very good, easy to drink and clean. Overall, a nice little beer, worth trying when you see it.","beertunes","Feb 25, 2009"
4.85,32.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Pours a very excellent light burnished copper with great lastiing head and excellent lacing throughout. It has a wonderfully malty scent without being too deep (true to an Irish red instead of an Irish stout), with that great Irish red twist in the nose. Great taste, a wonderfully malty beer with a nice tart tang and very slightly fruity finish. Goes down great, a little too smooth in fact! Well done on this Irish red.","JamesS","Sep 29, 2005"
3.49,-4.9,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"D- Goes down nice, but just not a lot going on with the beer that would make me order another.","TommyW","Apr 28, 2005"
2.26,-38.4,4,3,2,2,1.5,"I haven't completed my 20 reviews yet or else I would add it to the list and give it 4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5 The food at the brewery is also excellent!","box299","Feb 23, 2004"
3.07,-16.3,5,3,3,3.5,2.5,"Drinkability: my overall impression of this red ale is that it is served way...too cold. The temp. certainly doesn't help because in my point of view, a good ale has to be served in a slightly chilled or just cool condition for the nose and body to be revealed. Alas, for this potentially pleasant half-pint I simply didn't have unlimited time to wait for it to warm up. A real shame.","wl0307","Aug 19, 2003"
4.56,24.3,5,4,4.5,5,5,"I visited the Porterhouse on my trip to Ireland and was hoping to try some true Irish brewed beer. The Porterhouse is the only microbrewery in Dublin and so that is where I ended up - Good call. Their Red ale is simply awesome. Opaque orange/reddish color body producing a sick-ass creamy off-white head that lasts all the way to the last drop. Smell is light with roasted malt and fruit notes. Sweet malt flavor throughout with a satisfying hop bitterness. Great caramel flavor. An enticing dryness in the end which just makes you want to take another sip. Not very strong at 4.4 but it tastes great so who cares. You can just keep on drinking em! Mouthfeel is very thick and rich for a pale ale. It has the mouthfeel of a stout. Absolutely amazing. Highly recommended if you ever visit Dublin.","palma","Beers"

3,-18.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Was pretty good, but a bit timid in flavour, and for me had a bit of a buttery taste which i didn't mind, but didn't like. Lightly sweet malts in the start, lightly dry and not really bitter hoppy finish. A bit light, yes, but not bad, Irish Red Ales have never been a favourite.","rastaman","0"
