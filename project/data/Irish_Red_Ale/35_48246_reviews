"apparently only available in Boston, part of Sam Adams charity program."
""
""
"I believe this is only available in Massachusetts, but if you are in the great city of Boston, you would be better served by trying another craft beer that you can't get in your home state/country."
""
"I have had this a couple of times now, and nothing special. I consider it below average."

"Is only available at a handful of bars in Boston.  This beer is brewed as a ""thank you"" for the early adopters to sell Sam Adams.  High quality."

"Very similar to an Irish red and easy to pair with a good chowder."

"O - Actually a decent red ale, not too sweet, moderately balanced."
""

"Wonderful Irish red ale. It reminds me of McSorleys Red which I had years ago in New York City. It's creamy and rich and has only the slightest after taste of bitterness. It has a soft texture. I think any experienced beer palate will enjoy this beer. Personally I loved it."

"Second Favorite Sam Adams beer next to Noble Pils. If you can only get this on tap around Boston, I suggest getting it and you won't regret it."

"Draught @ Doyles: This one pours a crystal clear coppery color. There is a decent off-white head that left lots of lacing. Nice nose. Caramel malts, a subdued sweetness. Some spicy, earthy hops and a touch of pine. The taste is good. Very clean, well balanced, malty. Slightly dry, bitter finish. Nice."

"O: This was an OK beer but kind of what I have come to expect from Sam Adams - nothing too risky, fairly safe recipes that would appeal to gateway craft beer drinkers. I'm glad that I happened to find this on tap while visiting Boston for the weekend because otherwise I would not have had the opportunity to try it."

"This and 26.2 (Both Boston exclusives, unfortunately...) are both two of the better Samuel Adams varieties. I can understand and appreciate why they're only available in Boston, but I still wish they'd bottle it and ship it!"
""
""
"Pours a deep amber almost red with a decent sized tan head that shows great retention. Smells of malty caramel and toffee with just enough earthy floral hops to make it a Sam Adams beer. The taste is a little sweet and a bit malty with a great Irish Red caramel feel to it. Spicy earthy hops provide some balance to the sweetness. Medium body with a moderate to spirited level of carbonation and a sweet malty mouthfeel. This is a nice Irish Red with a bit of a kick in the hops. I liked it a bit."

"It was a treat to have a ""rare"" SA beer while in it's home town."

"O - Boston Brick Red is a nice and solid example of the style. In particular, it is very drinkable and a great accompaniment to a meal (I had this one with pizza). It is rare and I definitely would like to see more of this one."
""
""
""
""
"It's a good restaurant beer. I would be interested in trying it in a bottle for comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The malt profile is nice. This is an alright beer, but not particularly interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer was a red color and the taste was fitting of a red ale. Descent amount of head on it but nothing stood out other than the fact you can't buy it in bottle form and it's rare to see anywhere. Not bad with some Chowder. On par with Killians Irish Red."

"O-A more than decent effort worthy of your attention."
""
""
"O - Very similar to their Boston Lager, with heavier malts and a lighter hop profile. A decent beer to at least try if you get a chance when you are in the Boston area."

"O: Just an average irish red. I'd get it if you see it because of the limited aspect of it, but don't be disappointed if you're let down. Maybe it was the plastic cup for me, but who knows"
"I had this beer when we went on the tour at the BBC in Boston. The beer was a nice golden yellow color with a very thick head. The smell was pretty average. Got a bit of malt and tiny bit of hops. The taste was pretty average. To me it was like a watered down version of the Boston Lager. The Mouthfeel was nice. I got a good amount of crispness. Overall this beer is perfect for what it is meant for (local bars and restaurants). It isnt the best beer in the world, but I love the meaning of this beer."
"It was aaite. I'm usually pretty quick to shut down a Jim Kosh beer, but this one was aaite. I had it at the Bell In Hand, supposedly the nations oldest tavern in Boston. We also had some Sam Boston Lagers around too, and came to the agreement that it was like they took the Boston Lager recipe and switched out yeasts and fermented it at 68 degrees. This isn't to say we didnt like it. The grain bill was solid, nice hop aroma and flavor, it looked pretty in its glass, it just didn't do much else for me that any other American style ale would do. Like I said though, I'd give it a solid aaite and probably order another if given the chance."
"O- Not all that impressive of a beer. Drinkable, but it's a bit of a disappointment considering how much I like most Sam Adams beers."
"While not one of my favorites, I would still recommend trying it once just because I haven't tasted anything else quite like it."
"Didn't know anything about this beer until I got to the brewery in Boston last summer. The brewery was giving samples of this along with a few others. Since it's only sold in Boston I'll need to make my way back there if I ever want to have this beer again. The color of the beer is a deep red color with a pretty decent looking head on it. The lacing was sporadic along the glass. The smell has a pleasent aroma of hops and malts. The taste also has a hoppy and malty flavor. The mouthfeel is drinkable and just about medium bodied. Overall it's a good brew and really worth checking out when in Boston."
"I wish I didn't have restaurant distractions while trying this beer, but based on the taste it was great brew and was enjoyed with food but could easily be a session beer."
"Great medium body that pairs perfectly with the caramel and hints of chocolate. Some bitter hops towards the end and a semi-dry finish. Overall it is very good. One of the best I've had for the style."
"Sampled earlier today at Epcot in Disney World. Light mahogany red in color with a short off-white head that reduced to a light cap. Plenty of sticky lacings. Malty caramel aroma with a very slight hint of floral hops. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation. Big malty caramel flavor up front, dark cherry and grape fruit flavors through the middle, and light floral hop finish. Very enjoyable."
"Certainly recommended."
"On tap somewhere in Massachusetts. Rusty head with excellent retention. Nice malty aroma with a hint of hop. Very smooth with a subtle hop bite that balances out perfectly with the beers malt. Some chocolate malt? A nice, smooth Irish red. Great for the style. I could drink this all afternoon!"
"The malt makes it to be on the heavier side, but it was a very nice beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it might not be the best beer in the style but it's decent enough to be worth drinking for a while."
"This beer is only available on tap in the boston area. Its not in every bar either so you have to look around for it. Its got a great color a deep brick red color (hence the name). Its got a nice malty sweetness to it with a mild hop finish. Its a great red ale and one of sam adams best beers in recent times."
"Two enjoyable pints later, I appreciated the subtle complexities of this beer more than I had on previous occasions. There was something off of about the grainy hoppiness in the beer I couldn't place; but it's a highly drinkable, suitably unique Boston Beer Co. offering."
"While it's not the best red I've had or anything, it's a good beer to get you in the Boston frame of mind and a good offering from Sam Adams."
"Drinkability: An above-average and drinkable red, but nothing more."
"D: A so-so Irish red ale that gets more props as a Boston-native tap-only selection. The flavors and ABV are sessionable, but it's sort of a tough pair and not entirely interesting enough flavor-wise to keep going back to. Glad I tried it, so should you, and I might be inclined to get it again if nothing outshines it on the tap line. It's worth a try."
"D: a very pleasant English style red ale. I could spend an evening drinking these."
"I saw this on draft at a number of bars in boston and had never seen it before. I wasn't even sure what type of beer it was. Irish Red makes sense. This was ok. As with all of Sam Adams' beers it was very solid and good. But, as with many of their beers, not altogether outstanding. Good amber/red color, nice carbonation, very drinkable. This is one of those beers that's always the most interesting choice among a small selection of marcros"
"Had this on tap at a local pub today, pours a dark red, tasted like a pretty standard Irish Red, pretty malty, yet smooth, not alot standing out to me as I drink this beer. Pretty nondescript, not sure how this is much different than their other red ales, I'd have to do a side by side comparison, sorry for lack of detail but a very standard run of the mill red ale, not bad, but not great either. A very average beer."
"It pours a clear amber red with a khaki/tan head more than a finger strong. Solid wall of lace clings to the glass with very good head retension. Floral hops and malty sweetness comprise the aroma. Taste is crisp and malty sweet with an alcohol taste filling out the body. Caramel notes are present and it has a warming finish. Medium feel with moderate carbonation. Very easy drinking."
"Drinkability: A hoppier Boston lager...A very good beer that I could sip all day. One of Sam Adams better offerings and one of the better I have had in the style."
"It had a clean after taste and a definite drinkability. I didn't want anything else while I was in Boston."
"Cheers!"
"Sam Adams has an interesting take on the irish red - and a pretty good one at that."
"a pretty standard irish red. nothing to write home about, but worth a try."
"Overall, I could do better. Easy to drink, but kinda lacking any real punch to make me want an encore. Worth a try, but just that."
"D: Not SA's best effort by a long shot. Very malty but too much toasted flavor with an strange abrupt hops finish that adds up to a poorly cohesive brew."
"Tried this beer on recommendation from the staff and found it quite enjoyable. I had never heard of this Sam Adam's product so was pretty excited. Served in a Becker which nicely accentuated the deep red color of this beer and the 2 fine finger eggshell head that stuck around well and left some good lacing. The smell was a little worrisome as it was virtually not there, but being in a steak house sort of over whelms the senses so perhaps it had more than the slight maltiness to which I would give it credit. The taste seemed to be very forward on the palette but with very little after taste. This beer seems like a more full version of many of the Red's I have tried. I could enjoy a few of these any time and they could be well served to compliment a good steak any day."
"This beer is dark red in color and clear, has light to moderate carbonation with a slight head. There is a slight plum and Carmel aroma and the taste is of alcohol and plum. This is an ok session beer and I was happy to find it on tap, though I do wish it was a bit more remarkable."
"Pretty authentic take on an Irish Red, unfortunately the horrible aroma brings the drinkability down in my book"
"A great beer without being flashy. One of my favorites by SA. Very similar to their Irish Red."
"Reviewed on 06/22/2009. On tap at Sunset Grill, Boston. This beer pours a dark brownish red with a white head. The aroma is of indistinct sweet malt. The flavor is sweet initially with lots of sweet malt. This is just a bland, malty mess of a beer, nothing special. Meh."
"I know Irish Reds are supposed to be malty, but this one just seems a bit too malty to me. Perhaps it's the one-note dominance of the malt flavors. It's a decent beer, but most likely not one that I'll have again, especially if there are better options on tap."
"D: Not bad but pretty standard."
"This beer pours a deep crystal clear red. When served, not much of a head, more like a slight film that was offwhite. Nice wispy lacing left along the glass. Nose is somewhat muted with most notably caramel malts present. Taste makes up for lack of scent. Very sweet, this beer is loaded with amber, caramel, and toffee malts, there was a touch of breadiness in the middle, and finished out for more sweet caramel malts. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium body, nice carbonation, crisp going down with a slightly sticky finish. I'm generally not a fan of Sam Adams brewery, but I've found a brew that is highly enjoyable and very drinkable!"
"On tap only in the city of Boston (and Cambridge) for a limited time, so I have been trying to have a pint whenever I can. Had a pint on Saturday night at a bar on Boylston St. Served in a pint glass. Clear, bright red color. Minimal head, and good amount of carbonation. Smell was nothing special. Taste was good and different at the same time. Good in the sense that it had a nice balance of malt and hops, and different in that it didn't really taste like a Sam Adams. It was refreshing, but I would not have guessed SA. I think I like this one more than the Irish Red they've had out in the past. A nice one-off beer to serve to the locals."
"This was a very enjoyable Irish Red, not sure how close to the style it was but nevertheless very malty and smooth."
"I've always found ""Irish Red"" ales and lagers to be a bit bland but Sam Adam's does it again, I really liked this. Had a nice malty smell and drank very smooth and had kind of a sweet aftertaste, very tasty . Brick Red is the perfect description of the color because it was a deep, dark amber/red color. I really hope this gets marketed and is in stores, it'd be one I'd pick up on occasion that's for sure. It went really well with the buffalo wings I had."
"This beer has a great feel to it, with a nice refreshing. crsip taste. It goes down easy and is pretty darn smooth."
"Fairly drinkable beer, pretty average overall."
"Glad I tried it."
"Far more bitter than I expected. Good malt flavor which means its well-balanced. The aftertaste is short lived. Full bodied with a proper level of carbonation. Overall, a decent Red."
"For my bachelor party, my pals took me both to Doyle's and the Sam Adams tour. At both places, the Brick Red (which they said was released Thursday, Feb 26th) was being served. The tour guide described the drink as being similar to the already aptly named Sam Adams Irish Red Ale. From memory, this drink was much darker than the Sam Adams Irish Red Ale (hence the ""brick"" name). A frothy head with some decent lacing was also noticed in both the sample cup and glass I had at Doyles. Aromas of malty spice were noticeable. A sharp malt sweetness was enjoyable prevalent in the drink. Other flavors included hints of hops, toffee and bread wrapped in the roasty crispness of the carbonation. Overall, if you are in the greater Boston area, you should try this up while it lasts."
