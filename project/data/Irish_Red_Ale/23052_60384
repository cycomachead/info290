3.08,-13.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours red-amber with a short-lived head that dissipates leaving no lacing. Smell was earthy, Lipton tea. Taste is subtle sweetness, but primarily tea leaves and biscuit-malt. A noticeable hop oil bitterness comes in late around the edges of the tongue. Bitterness lingers. Medium mouthfeel, but lower than expected carbonation. Not great, but drinkable.. I did enjoy their IPA a bit more.","JackieTH","Jan 16, 2012"

3.53,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Thanks again to cpolking for sending this beer. This beer rushed out of its can and produced an amber color with a 1.5 inch head. Smell is of caramel malts. Taste is also malty, a touch of hops, slightly sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer.","tone77","Jul 23, 2011"
3.91,9.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D/O- Thirst quenching...to say the least. I want more hops in my red...to say even more. I guess that'd no longer be and Irish Red but still, my preference. This would be a good "local" go-to sessionable beer for me as I'm enjoying it thoroughly.","Duff27","Jun 19, 2011"

3.85,7.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This pours dark amber and has underwhelming head/lacing/retention. There is a nice dark toasty malt flavor that finishes off pleasant and bready, I can even taste a sweet grain/almost corn flavor. There is no sourness that is sometimes seen in Red Ale. I enjoyed this representation of the style. The drinkability is great, and probably the highlight.","beerdown77","May 29, 2011"
4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"O: A fine example of the style, and a really nice beer. This beer begs to be paired, and I'm thinking that Irish Stew would be a good choice-- no strong flavors to compete between the two. Will need to test that theory the next time the weather is cold enough. Kudos to the folks at Great River for another tasty brew.","AmericanGothic","May 10, 2011"
3.53,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"light amber pours with a huge head of white that came up a full three fingers in height. Smooth settling left a good bit of side glass lace and a nice and even coating across the top of the glass. Interesting aroma as it started out with a nice and well rounded bready malt that seemed to slowly evolve into a grassy, herbal hop profile with a bit of a kick from the caramel. Did not seem to have a clear direction, but the taste made up for it nicely. Very smooth, nice caramel and malty tones that won me over with ease. Smooth even flavor, crisp, clean and well balanced. Smooth notes of grassy bittering hops coming in at the finish gave it a nice little drying effect and warmed it up. Very drinkable as it went down smooth and left me looking for more right away.","mikesgroove","May 03, 2011"

3.47,-2.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from 16 oz can into that ol' trusty shaker glass. Poured a nice amber color with a very small whiteish head that quickly disapated. Aromas of malt, caramel, and something I can't quite put a finger on. Taste was sweet malt and caramel with no hop bitterness. Quite quaffable; I could do this one as a session beer and would definitely have this again on draft.","Schmittymack","Apr 18, 2011"

3.88,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Roller Dam Red Ale is dam(n) fine beer if you like red ales that have perfect malt-hop balance. The recent change in Iowa law allowing higher ABV beer to be brewed was great, but RDRA would've been possible back in the bad old days of 2008. Good job Great River. And keep 'em coming.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 29, 2010"
3.95,10.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Notes: A nice, although fairly typical, Amber/Red ale. Plenty of toffee and nutty flavors with some caramel. Sweet maltiness, but nothing too overboard. Another good, not great, offering for the brewery. Great options for getting a canned beer and for introducing people to craft beer. Worth picking up and trying.","FreshHawk","Aug 24, 2010"
3.78,5.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,3,"Love the Crack & Glug! Beer as an auditory pleasure in addition to everything else. My pour netted just over a finger of light-tan head that burbled, bubbled, exploded with CO2 and phased itself out of existence. Red? Like a coppery amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a sweet, malty, raspberry-like quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a very sweet caramel taste on the tongue. Phew! I am not a fan of sweet beers, but anything in the interest of the quest. Finish was bittersweet with a light metallic tang. Bottom line for me was that it was simply too sweet for this self-avowed hophead to want to drink on a routine basis.","woodychandler","Beers"
4.05,13.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Rich maltiness, fruity raisin and plum again, possibly from the ale yeast. Drying aftertaste of molasses. Bready with Crystal malt caramel sweetness. Not all that bitter, though the can states 30 IBUs. Fairly big malt flavors, and light bodied, making for an easier session. Well made and full of flavor, still it could use a touch more hops to make it really great.","emerge077","0"
3.99,11.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"3.85 - O: I'm glad I stumbled upon this beer in desporation while out of town on business. I'll be sure to be on the lookout for other offerings the next time around.","dpnelson1978","0"
