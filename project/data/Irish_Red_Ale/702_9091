A not too overwhelming caramel and chocolate, big malts on the tongue mixed with touch of bittersweet spice from the hops, again a little bit of a smokey/roasted feel.

Poored deep copper in color with about 1/4"" of cream colored head that dissipated quickly but had bits hang on around the edge of the glass that left nice lacing.

Mostly malty smells here, but there's a slight stony or sulphury element lurking in the background. On the palate, juicy caramel malts and a bit of a roasted character balance with a bit of hop bitterness and dryness at the finish -- but only a bit; the beer is rather sweet overall. Mouthfeel is still and heavier than expected due to the low carbonation level. Overall, this is a pretty delicious Irish red that would make a great session(ish) ale.","geexploitation","Oct 01, 2007"

3.18,-14.1,4.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,"Pours a rich amber hue with a huge khaki colored three finger head that takes a very long time to die down to a good layer of lacing throughout. Stickiness is great, holds on all over the glass. Smell is of a sweet brown sugar malt sweetness with a tiny bit of dirty hops. Taste seems off to me. I detect iced tea with a smokey malt background, not very appealing taste. Aftertaste is a nutty malt flavor with some bitterness from some hop. Mouthfeel is light with a good amount of carbonation. I take away from the drinkability because of the strange taste. I wouldn't seek this one out.","BeerTruth","Jun 04, 2007"

Caramelly malt aromas, with a nearly butterscotch character (but not quite). Faint floral hop scents. Sweet caramel maltiness up front on the palate, with a slightly spicy and floral hop interlude right before a surprisingly long toasted biscuit finish, which is probably my favorite aspect of this beer. There is a slight melon/pear/kiwi fruitiness somewhere around the middle of the sip, but overall this is a malt-based Irish red ale. Light body, moderate sparkle and tactile piquancy. This is nowhere near outstanding, but it is a damn good session brew. Downright quaffable. Flaship beer ahoy!","orfeu","Dec 28, 2006"

Full and malty backed by a mild hops presence. Dark bread and caramel most notable along with a hint of earthy peat. The taste is actually a bit of a let down. ItÂ’s not bad, but following such and attractive nose it just doesnÂ’t live up to expectations. It starts and finishes nicely but I find the middle pretty dull in both flavor and mouthfeel. It has a medium body, lightly dry texture and low carbonation. It definitely has a lot of qualities I admire, but it needs some tweaking to make it something IÂ’d recommend seeking out.","ski271","Nov 26, 2006"

I don't mind yeast, not saying that, but it just came on a bit strong at first, but the flavor more than mitigated what I saw as the sole setback. This is probably a bit more complex than your average session beer, but with the manageable ABV, it is certainly as drinkable as many others, if not more so.

Really strong coffee or espresso bean character pops right out at you, interesting and a little bold for a red ale. Also a nice mixture of malt and hops in the scent, balance is key. Taste is equally good. The mentioned espresso taste is more subtle in the taste, nice. Big carmel malt notes up front with a nice milky creamy taste. This is a solid beer all around - excellent smooth mouthfeel, medium to big bodied. Great complexity without being too much.

3.65,-1.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkable? YesÂ… very much so in fact. I could sit back and kill a six-pack of this. Hell I might kill to try this beer on cask. If this beer were a local I would drink it often. As is, I need to thank shippos for including this bottle in the Secret Bunny Exchange!","bditty187","Jan 17, 2005"
3.45,-6.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Mildly sweet caramel malt aroma. Small light tan colored head fades quickly to a thin film. Transparent deep brown colored beer with an amber hue. Toasted, biscuit malt flavor up front mixes midway with a bit of hop tea and finishes slightly bitter. Light bodied beer with a soft mouthfeel. Flavor is a bit strong and strange up front, but otherwise a nice beer.","HappyHourHero","Jan 09, 2005"
4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A dark, juicy looking red colour with a nice, ample head of white foam. Aromas are of juicy, fruity hops. Caramel malts, bread, and pine. The taste is very juicy with a subtle hop flavor that is very juicy in nature. The maltiness is apparent but somewhat subdued as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and VERY refreshing which gives the drinkability of this brew a very clear edge.","francisweizen","Dec 07, 2004"
3.95,6.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This was a cheap single, a last-minute grab while leaving the beer store. I didnÂ’t expect much, to be sure, but found a hell of a good brew. ItÂ’s a dark amber, nearly reddish-brown, brew with a beautiful, long-lasting head. ItÂ’s really an attractive beer. The aroma is intense and of roasted malts and alcohol. Chocolate, bit of coffee, and somewhat peppery. At times, thereÂ’s an intrusive harshness, but I found that kind of enjoyable. Only slightly sweet, and very well balanced. Medium body and very smooth. I really enjoyed this one.","Suds","Dec 03, 2004"
3.7,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"I see why this one has a higher score than, say, the casco bay riptide. It's much smoother - nicer to drink (well, especially if it's not hot out - and when is it hot in Maine?). If they cut back on the chocolate malts and maybe upped the hops a bit this would be an awesome beer...","charlesw","Sep 19, 2004"
3.08,-16.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Ruby red hue, thick pure white head. Nose is pleasant Â– some fresh baked bread, dark roasted malts. Thin bodied, but not in the way of flavorings; some coffee/espresso notes, dark roasted malts, rather dry. Vienna malts come to play, rather over carbonated, minimal hop presence. Non-offensive, but average at best. Freshness may be an issue here.","GeoffRizzo","Sep 10, 2004"
4.15,12.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark ruby color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a kick ass malty scent. It is complex and full of pale and crystal malts. It has a dry feel and a creamy finish. The taste is good. It has a dry, yet malty flavor with a bit of bitter hops in the aftertaste. It goes down smooth and finishes bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine red ale. It has great aroma and complexity; an awesome brew from Buffalo's finest.","WesWes","Sep 05, 2004"
4.11,11.1,5,4,4,4.5,4,"now the first bottle i had was awesome but the second seemed a little off and had some chunks of yeast in the bottom of the glass. so this beer might vary a little due to QC, still give this beer a shot.","shippos","Aug 17, 2004"
4.05,9.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"A very good drink, but the heaviness definitely becomes a factor in terms of drinkability. A great version of the style and one to seek out of your partial to 'reds'.","NEhophead","Jul 10, 2004"
3.98,7.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a 12 oz. longneck brown bottle, a blurb about the ale on the back of the label. Small gold foil over the cap, and the cap itself oddly enough says ""Gringo light"". Too cryptic for me to decipher. A robust chestnut in colour, it becomes a radiant cherry oak hue when held to the light, quite stunning in fact. Decent off-white head that settles to a ring. A great deal of sweet malts on the nose, toffee, chocolate, small dose of coffee, hell, I can even pick up bubblegum. The malts dominate the flavour as well, caramel, dry dark chocolate, toasted malt, with some coffee on the aftertaste, with a minimum appearance of hops, although the hops become a bit more prevalent as the glass warms up. Light mouthfeel, a bit of carbonation on the finish. A very rich red ale, it could have easily fooled me for a brown, it could use a stronger dose of hopping for my tastes, so as not to be so overhwhelmed by the plethora of malts. Many thanks to northyorksammy for the fresh sample.","IronDjinn","Beers"

4.8,29.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is a standout Red. Rogue, Red Rocket, Red Seal, etc are all too hopped up to be a red.should be considered a ""India Red"" as Landmark has properly done. Regardless, I would purchase Aviator over all of these, even without the homestate nod.","wailingwench","Mar 24, 2003"
