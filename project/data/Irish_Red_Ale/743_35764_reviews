"Poured from a growler I got 7 days ago from the brewery. Seems that 7 days may have been a little much? This seemed to have more sharpness to it last week but maybe ti was the food I was eating? Nice middle of the road sweet beer"

"This was tough to rate since it is categorized as an American Red Ale, which it doesn't really present itself as. In which case I thought it was a below average American Red Ale, but a very good Irish Red Ale."

"Had this on tap at the brew pub. Served in a pint glass. A beautiful rich amber color with a nice one and a half finger head on it. The aroma was nicely developed and not overwhelming to the point where it overpowered the beer. When I drank it I could taste the richness of the hops and malts which made the beer that much better. If you can get this on draft get it! I said to the bartender that they should bottle/can this brew, and the bartender said that he would pass it on."
"I like this brew and found it easy to drink and refreshing, I would order a pint of this if I was sticking around for a meal too."
"A simple, well-balanced choice from LBC. Poured a clear, copper brown, with a thin white head and noticeable carbonation. Mild malts and grains in the aroma, and a hint of hops. Toasted grains and malts on the tongue, nutty, and again, just a hint of hop bitterness. A little stale in the aftertaste. Medium-light mouthfeel, not too flavorful, but drinkable overall."
"poured a deep amber. it was bittery and hoppy. smell was not really all that upfront. lively. this one was an ok drinker too hoppy for my tastes, but a great try for the hop heads."
"D- its good drinking, but probably shouldn't be considered an amber...was talking to the bartender, and they apparently qualify it as an Irish Red. I'd say that would be a little more apt."
"Watery finish and barely noticeable carry-through. Very dry finish, leaving me with a bit of an over-roasted grain dryness."
"D: Okay, but the flavor is a bit too bland to want a second."
"D- The flavor was good bit some times overwhelming. A nice beer to have on occassion but not something i would drink every day or every week."
"D: I probably wouldn't reach for another right away."
"Poured a clear deep amber/red color with a good 3/4"" of bubbly off-white head, good lacing. Smells are of very grainy malts with just a touch of hops. Tastes very sweet and malty, like caramel and bread, with a bitter hop finish. Medium in body with good carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. A very sessionable amber ale to enjoy while at Lancaster Brewing."
"D: The abv is reasonable, low even, and the flavors are strong enough that I'd belly up for a few more."
"D - Not my favorite beer from Lancaster, more of a palate cleanser, it lacks what I consider drinkable qualities. Too much gas and it a long while for the malt to even grace my tastebuds. I will skip this in the future."
"This arrived with a decent, bone-white head that had decent retention throughout. The color was rust-red with NE-quality clarity. The nose was lightly sweet with malt. The mouthfeel was slightly thin and had a mild hoppiness to go along with the sweetness. The finish was mildly bitter, but it also had enough sweetness to keep the malt set happy. This was another red which did not overwhelm me with its sweetness. I may have to rethink my stance on red ales as a result."
"The beer pours an amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a tame pale and light crystal malt scent. It seems a bit grainy. It has a mild hop aroma that really rounds out the nose. The taste is decent as well. It has a light, malty flavor with a dry bitter finish. Again, there is a grainy element, but nothing too bad. The hops are light, but welcome in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This a decent amber ale. It's light and easy drinking; nothing too complicated."
"An OK beer, but there are better beers at the brewpub to select from."
"This is an easy-drinking red ale. And by easy-drinking I mean it's smooth but lacks much flavor. I think there's a little bit of crisp and spicy hops, but it mostly throws off an otherwise creamy mouthfeel. It kind of reminds me of Killian's Irish Red, even thought that's a lager. Oh well."
"D- A good beer all around, balanced."
"Well, the Celtic Rose has made its debut and it's kind of interesting. It tastes somewhat like the Red Rose although, I admit, it's been quite a while since I had a pint. Matter o' fact, it even looks a little like the Red Rose. Check it out, new batch on tap!"
