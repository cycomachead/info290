Smell is malty, caramel. Taste is also malty, hops are present, caramel, very refreshing and smooth. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a very easy drinking beer that I could consume all night.","tone77","Aug 16, 2014"

4.28,18.9,5,4.5,4.5,3,4,"I put this baby in gear with a squirting Crack and employed an inverted Glug, producing a massive three fingers of dense, light-tan head with excellent retention. Color was, indeed, a deep brick red (SRM = 15, hey, who am I to argue, plus it works as a calibrator) with NE-quality clarity. The Cascade hops were prevalent on the nose and allow me to plug "Hops" by Stan Hieronymous, printed by the Brewers Association. It is a brilliantly written tome and VERY helpful for this non-brewing hophead. Warming, I was also getting a toast-like smell, probably from the roasted barley. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, not bad, but not great, either. Forget that. The taste was great, since the hops were forward, which is a knock that I usually have with the (usually malt-driven) style. It had a grassy mintiness along with a light biscuit flavor, just right for this Baby Bear. Finish was closer to semi-dry than semi-sweet and I was CANtacting my friends for more. I really dug this twist on the style and would certainly CANsider it for inclusion in my cooler.","woodychandler","Oct 29, 2013"

Nose of roasted nut, caramel, and toffee. Very rich aromas on the nose. Flavors are rich and roasted caramel forward, with a subtle resinous hopped backbone. Chocolate notes into the aftertaste to join the toffee, caramel, and nut, with a building bitterness to balance. Rich, smooth bodied, with a sweet linger into a smooth finish. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Oct 18, 2013"

3.89,8.1,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Reddish amber in the Duvel tulip with a modest but persistent foam. Plenty of hoppy flavors give this a bitter middle that intensifies in the aftertaste. The nutty, roasted flavors are what give it some zest. I score this highly because it's a superior example of a really dull category of beer.

The beer does have a nice amber color, though, under that ridiculous head. The obnoxiously overflowing pour also filled the area with lovely beer aromas of cereal grains, lemon pith, and a clean yeastiness. In the flavor, sweet caramel malts are subdued by an earthy, dry, somewhat roasty bitterness, but it all comes through just a bit thin. The light texture has some substance and energy, providing a fine complement to the flavor profile. Overall, the overflowing cans pissed me off, but after my rage subsided, I had to acknowledge that this beer is quite nice.","devilben02","May 03, 2013"

There's a vague floral edge, slightly perfumey vegetable ideas. It has some bock-like qualities. A little skunky.
