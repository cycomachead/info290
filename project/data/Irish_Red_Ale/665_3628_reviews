"Poured from a nitro-can into a shaker pint, the beer has the cascade effect into a caramel coloring with a dense, smooth, cream colored head. Aromas of tangy cream, sugary and caramel sweet notes, and roasted notes. Flavors are roasted sweet forward, with caramel and nutty notes blending together, and some sugary highlights. Smooth and light in mouth, and the nitro really rounds out any edges. Tangy and sugary aftertaste, most noticeably caramel linger through the smooth, easy finish. Classic, and easy enough to drink, but there are better Cream Ales out there."
"I have a soft spot in my heart for Kilkenny. I picked up my obligatory St. Patty's 4 pack of nitro cans today. This really is a lovely looking beer - I do love the cascading action as it assembles itself for consumption. The aroma is a faint bread and yeast, and the flavour is super soft on the palate. This is beer for people who don't really like beer, in many ways (my wife loves it). Overall, though, drinking a Kilkenny is a good thing."

"Maybe I drank differently then I was supposed to, but it tasted like water with a little bit of milk to me."

"These draught can cream ales are not supposed to be ""in your face"".  They are mellow, have low ABV, and are meant for easy drinking.  This one fits the mold perfectly."

"One of the smoothest beers you'll taste."

"Overall: Decent Irish red. Wouldn't not drink again."
"The creamy texture is the only thing this one really has going for it.  Macro flavor with nothing that really stands out."

"I don't mind having one once in awhile, but it is not a beer I actively seek out."

"Aroma and flavor is caramel malts, mild fruit and nitro/creamy finish.  Not bad but probably would have been a little better without the nitro."

"I think this is a enjoyable choice. I could see myself grabbing some of these for the holidays as it kind of reminds me of the consistency of light eggnog (not the taste). Definately better than the Winter Spirit I reviewed and has a lot more going for it as far as appearance, body, and complex flavors.  Not everyone may like it, but definately is a nice change if you want to try something different. Cheers."
"Overall: This is not really a spectacular beer. I have had a lot of better beers, A LOT, but this one allows me to wax nostalgic. Its better than a lot of beers out there but if I had just had this one for the first time it would honestly get probably a 3.5 or 3.75, but I am biased based upon a youthful tromp through Europe when I drank this beer many years ago. It still good. If you can find it try it for yourself. I wish they would make it more readily available in this part of the USA, I would buy it more often for sure."
"O: delicious toasted red"

"I had this at Ri Ra at Mandalay Bay in Vegas. A very drinkable Irish ale - soft creamy mouthfeel. Nothing extraordinary but rather tasty. Lightly carbonated and malty - not extremely hoppy. A few hints of citrus bot nothing overt. It has a nice finish. Went perfectly with fish & chips."

"This rating is for having it on tap in Ireland. In the can, I would give it 3.65. On tap, it has a delicious, creamy body and iron flavor."

"I love the nitro widget on offer in the canned variety. What a novelty. The creamy texture really does it for me with this ale. It has a deep reddish hue, topped off with a thick layer of cream. I feel really indulgent when I drink this beer and I would recommend it to anyone who has not yet experienced it."

"This is a beer that is totally different on nitro draft and scores can vary a lot. Very smooth eay to drink red ale import. Has much better flavor ok n nitro draft vs can. Sooth light caramel malt. Very low hop presence. Creamy fluffy white head and a sliky smooth body"
""
""
"Overall: A nice beer, one that highlights subtle malt and nut flavours, and could be likened to a lighter, less roasty Guinness (in a good way). It is not as complex as I would have hoped, but is ahead of a lot of other 'macro' beers out there. Definitely relies on the nitrogen carbonation to stand out, but worth trying anyway."

"O: Lacked a lot in the taste and mouthfeel. Needs a lot more flavor to give me any reason to come back for more. Hopefully this was just a bad experience since I did not have it on tap."
""
"Medium bodied with a watery, drying finish. Very light effervescence. A smooth brew, easily quaffed in quantity and agreeable to the palate. Not a standout but a solid performer."

"I do not have much experience with british beers and am right now trying to learn more. Personally, I found it a very decent beer, which I plan to try again and see how my tastebuds will judge it."

"O - The entire time I was drinking this I kept thinking that it was just a nuttier version of Guinness draught with a copper body. I don't think that's such a bad thing though. Its an easy drinking beer with a bit of flavor to it. I could easily drink this all night, especially at 4.3% abv. Nitrogen or bust though."

"O: The lack of aroma and taste of this beer is a bummer because it looks proper and drinks amazingly smooth. It drinks very, very smooth and is quite refreshing; however, not overly enjoyable. Reminds me of drinking cream soda as a kid growing up (good memories), but I'll pass on this going forward as it is too sweet for me."
"O --- On a warm/hot day it would be a pretty good beer, but it's not one I would go back to very often. I think my wife would love it!"
"I decided to try Kilkenny ale tonight because it was the only offering at the bar that I had yet to sample, and apparently I discovered why this beer not more popular."
""
"Overall - I had not tried this beer for perhaps 15 to 20 years and did so largely because I was getting bored of Guinness! I would only drink this again in similar circumstances and will not be seeking it out!"

"Very easy drinking beer and very popular as well. Had my first in Amsterdam. I'm surprised it's not been added. I could drink this stuff all night and night get bored."
"Taste is similarly sweet with a creamy, velvety mouthfeel. Has a slightly bitter pang to the mid-palate but finish and linger are creamy and soft. Main palate tastes of that Irish cream with a slight herb flavour and a distinct vinegar acidity on the back. Mouthfeel is so smooth, one might expect it to be sweeter. It is interesting and rewarding though, but not as quaffable as it may have been. Still very pleasant drinking, and a great after-dinner drop."
"The brewery tacks the slogan ""smooth and distinguished"" onto each can. Smooth? By default, yes. Distinguished? Someone please get these people a dictionary. Is that meant to be tongue-in-cheek? Let me be plain and simple: this doesn't smell, taste or feel like beer (and you could make the case about this artificial carbonation) so in my mind, it simply isn't."
" Drinkability? I will not be drinking Kilkenny from a can for a long time, though I'm tempted to give it a second chance on tap."
"Overall it's good, but as a fan of Irish reds, I think the taste profile could be better."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and carbonated with just a little fizz nice and easy to take down a really nice session beer with the low abv what a great brew to just sit back and enjoy with friends."
"Arrived as a cloudy reddish brown. Creamy white bubbles filter to the top as it settles, making for a bit of a show. The taste was a delicious creamy, slightly sweet flavor, with some mild bitterness. Really smooth and tasty, though a bit dry in the end. It reminds me of a really good Guinness, but not as heavy."
"Drinkability - the low-alcohol, high-taste is a winner. Many of these could be put down in a night."
"I had this beer on tap in Ireland numerous times on a trip there. The taste and mouthfeel are outstanding. Very nice mix of hoppiness and malts with a stronger malt character.The head stayed with the beer the whole glass. Very smooth and drinkable beer. I wish it was available here."
"D- A refreshing change from Guinness and when the bar runs out of it then you shouldn't be disappointed. The body gets in the way of its endless drinkablity, however I enjoy the style and its certainly more friendly per pint then Guinness. If you like Guinness than revel in a new found beer."
"Final Thoughts - When I think this beer, I think of Guinness. This is probably because of the nitrogen tap. That being said, this beer seems to suffer from all the flaws of Guinness (heavy, bitter aftertaste) with few of the advantages (rich and strong flavor, creamy feel). Frankly that would be fine if the beer was lighter to the stomach. I would probably never buy this beer again, it's far too heavy for far too little flavor."
"I've always been content with this as a perfunctory default at that sort of bar, both here and even in Eire herself; but now, upon closer circumspection, a few blemishes become increasingly evident - a certain plainness all around, be it malt, hop, or well, overall flavour. Which, I suppose is this one's appeal at the pub - toss in the lower than average ABV, and this beer is sessionability, incarnate."
"A light aroma of malt but not much to speak of. The flavour is quite dry with a grainy malt backbone. Pretty bitter but still light on the hops. Pretty reminiscent of a Guinness for me. Creamy mouthfeel and pretty soft carbonation. Not too bad."
"It has a deep and dark red body with beautiful cloudy carbonation unit the beer settles. The head is amazingly frothy and creamy. Both the head and lace stick around until the bottom of the glass. The head does get thin it just seems to settle to about an eighth of an inch. Just like most Irish beers it is more about malt than hops. It is hardly bitter at all. The flavor is bread like with a mild amount of caramel. It has thick mouthfeel and is mildly creamy. It is creamier in the can than on tap in my opinion."
"A good ale to drink anytime of the year."
"Pours a really nice tea like red with a thick white head that stays until the beer is done. Nice sticky lacing that follows the beer to the end of the glass. For smell and taste I couldnt get that much. Very very smooth with almost no carbonation. Could easily have another but the taste just isn't there. For the price of a 4 pack, I dont think I'm going to buy another one of these for awhile."
"Ultimately, this beer is pleasant. Nothing tickles my fancy, or even gets me really interested. However, it is certainly not a disappointing or offensive brew. I wouldn't turn it down, but I can't sing its praises."
"Poured a dark amber color with a creamy, white head. Thick, reddish hue to the color. Sweet smell, with a smooth, dry finish. I enjoyed this beer nevertheless. Not heavy and goes down smooth. Would drink again given the chance. Its better than Caffreys to me. Cheers."
"Drinkabilty:: my goodness, I really did struggle to get it all down, but in the end I did due to passing it around for others to try (some liked, others didn't). Just too watery, & absolutelty nothing to invite me back for another one...a shame really!"
"Drinkability is good as well. It feels so wonderfully velvety rich in the mouth, but it's not filling and it finishes to nothing very quickly. And there's so little carbonic acidity and flavour that I could chug these all evening."
"D: Very good. Wish I could get this at home. It truly is better than Guinness and Boddington's and I know buy into the hype. I could drink this all day if it wasn't $2.50 a can."
"I have found that many others I work with have also fell in love with this beer but bummed about its distribution."
"I first discovered this beer through a friend at a gym I go to. He is British and was familiar with many beers from the UK. I was tired of the same old beers we have here in this little province of PEI Canada, so he suggested I try some English and Irish beers, Kilkenny was my first, I've tired a dozen or so others but keep coming back to Kilkenny, it's my favorite of all. Smoothest I've ever tastes, and really goes with almost anything, its texture is so creamy and the head is so dense and inviting. Recently it became available here, not sure if it's because of my pleading. Everyone who come over I give them a glass full and no one has ever not been impressed with it. I highly recommend people try it out."
"drinkability: high"
"Good abv for sitting in the sun."
"D- Excellent drinkablity, I had plenty of these while in Europe."
"D: Virtually no abv but goes down real smooth. A nice drink Id like to have access to once in a while. Id give it the nod over Guinness, better layers of flavor."
"D- A night in an Irish pub in Europe is a great time, this beer helped push the party on."
"D: This is not my favourite style, but I must say that I have enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would. It is very easy to drink, so I could see myself downing a few of these at a time. It's also relatively low in alcohol so you could have a few before you really feel it. However, I still find the flavour quite muted so I don't know how much of this I plan to drink in the future."
"Nothing I'd order again, and really wouldn't recommend trying."
"D - Couldn't go for another"
"At 4.3% abv it is highly quaffable but I'm not really a fan. It lacks an essential character that others in the style have. I enjoy others in the style but the taste and weak mouthfeel throws me off. Might be better on tap."
"Deep amber colored, almost orange, topped by a creamy white head that lasts all the way down (thanks nitro!). It has a toasted aroma with just a little creaminess. Similar flavor too, but a little sweeter. As it warms up, a little fruitiness creeps from underneath. Smooth and creamy on the palate, light, and dry. Like many nitro-infused beers, it's quaffable, making this a solid selection for a session beer. Certainly better than Smithwick's, and one beer I wish was sold in the states; I would interchange this with Murphy's and Beamish at the Irish pub I routinely go to."
"Overall a decent brew that goes well with most food especially basic pub fare. worth a try."
"Review translated from french 6-11-2008."
"Overall, this is definitely my favorite brand of beer. It simply has everything you can ask for out of a beer."
"One benefit of starting to actually critique the beer you drink is a growing awareness of the nitro-can, I find it hard to look at this beer the same way I did a year ago. The layered head is two-plus fingers with amazing retention and foamy presence yet there appears to be no carbonation. Feint odour of grain, yeast. There's just a hint of hops in the mouth, mildly bitter, rye bread with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste is a bit sweet. Actually, it isn't anywhere rich as it looks and I think it drinks quite well for a cream ale. I wouldn't hesitate to try this on tap sometime."
"Ah, the cascading display that is the niro-can. After the show, I was left with a rich copper brown brew, very clear, with a gorgeous off white to tan head, as thick as cream, that really never went away. Some rich roasted malt aroma is prevalent if you can get past that head that acts like a aroma seal. Some immediate tea-like bitterness followed by a sudden rush of roasted caramel malt which never overpowers the experience. The drying finish is there along with some hop bitterness. Altough somewhat creamy and very smooth, it was a tad on the watery side. Still very drinkable in large quantities by this reviewer."
"This beer is an example of what every Irish Red would hope to be. From the first pour, it resembles a Guinness, with the dark red color and thick white head. Its as smooth as beer gets. The flavor resembles a somewhat fruity amber with a surprisingly short aftertaste. This is the type of beer you have to unwind and relax, since it is a heavy brew. The only con I can think of it getting a hold of it. I have only had it in Montreal...well worth the trip!"
"Possibly I'm being a little generous, but this is a real easy drinker with no clear flaws apart from the watery mouthfeel. I prefer Kilkenny over Guinness when given the choice on most occassions, but I have somewhat lost my fondness after an awful St Patrick's day hangover."
"Excellant mouth to this one, medium body that goes down thin but creamy at the same time,very very smooth,and the head, that turns into a nice 1/4 inch collar,stays with you all along, and adds to the creaminess,wonderful to drink,could easily drink 3 or 4 of these at 500 ml. before moving on to some thing else.Very enjoyable and highly reccomended."
"Cute waitress wrote ""Yay"" in the foam on top. It stuck around for a while, in a thick foam about an inch, over a deep red colored beer. Looked amazing. Unfortunately, appearances can be deceiving. Nose was nearly non-existant, just some very light caramel malt (I think I got my nose wet trying to find any odor). Taste was likewise, extremely mild caramel malt. Body was excellent, thick and creamy. Overall, this one wasn't terrible, but I really could do with a little more kick in my beers."
"Thick creamy Guinness like head, slightly lighter in colour. Slightly bolder taste than Smithwick's, a little more full bodied I felt, I did have in on non-nitro and it seemed even more full bodied, nitro had slightly drier finish. Good beer anyhow."
"Another British ale that just didn't please my palate (yet my friends tell me that someday, my ale will come!). This beer has a darker colour than I normally like (I prefer golden nectars) and a weak aroma. It went down very smooth however. It felt thick in the mouth, very little carbonation. The flavour was alright, very malty."
"The taste is simple, a balance of malt and hops that quenches more than it does excite the palate. A super-smooth mouthfeel and easy drinkability makes this one good for people who are looking for something light, or people who don't enjoy beer much. If you're a fan of the style, this is a pretty good rendition. If you're not, this isn't going to change your mind."
"I had this brew on tap at a cafe during a late afternoon walk around Milan. It's a light yellow colored liquid with a very slim head. The aroma is faint, with a slight whiff of hops and a bit of grass. Not much else to speak of in the smell. The taste is similar, a hint of grain and a touch of hops. There's also a slight sweetness. The consistency of the brew is watery, with modest carbonation. Frankly, it reminds me of an American lawnmower beer. It served to quench my thirst, but didn't excite the beer lover inside."
"Like Caffrey's Irish Ale, Kilkenny is very impressive. Pours a dark amber color with a creamy, white head. Thick, reddish hue to the color. Sweet smell, with a smooth, dry finish. I really enjoyed this beer. Great beer to just sit back and drink all night."
"Mouthfeel: Only Jesus himself could create a creamier beer than this. Not just because of the nitro can, it's just a dessert of a beer. Drinkability very highh."
"It's far from bad, but it's not really outstanding either. An optimist might call it balanced; a pessimist might call it dull. I'd just call it a pretty good beer. I would have no qualms with buying this again, but it probably won't be a priority."
"The taste is slightly tea-like, which conforms to the style and reminded me of Caffrey's  though better. The mouthfeel and overall effect were more flavourful, with roasted malt and a dry finish. A nice full body and creamy mouthfeel, too."
"not bad but the finish hurts the overall beer experience."
"Mouthfeel okay, but I didn't make it past the halfway mark. Overall a very disappointing beer."
"D- I've only had this beer a couple of times. Once a while back and now. I didn't enjoy it either time. Because it is watery with low ABV, it goes down easily enough, but it is not really a pleasant experience."
"A nice beer, but not even close to the pint of Kilkenny I had on tap recently. Still a good beer and very drinkable."
"This beer was very attractive with its thick head and red color. It felt as smooth as it looked, which was delightful. The taste was good, however, I felt like it could have been richer to go along with the look and feel of the beer. Rather, it was kind of light, which did make it quite drinkable, but I felt took me in the wrong direction. Overall a good beer though, far better than what I typically get on tap."
"Good for morning tea."
"This is one for a session!"
"I have had Kilkenny many times over the years, but had not really appreciated it until I had it recently, served at the right temperature and poured correctly (at the Harp pub in Tempe, Australia). I was pleasantly surprised - the beer was a nice red-amber colour with an inch-thick creamy head that stayed to the bottom of the glass. Aroma was minimal, but smelled slightly malty. Taste was smooth and slightly toffee-sweet, with minimal bitterness. Very, very easy to drink, and I was halfway through my pint before I knew it. I wouldn't say this was a great beer by any standard, but a good session beer to be sure."
"Pours clear and reddish with a moderate white head. Faint aroma of caramel with toasty overtones. Flavour is the same but weaker than aroma thanks to a faint butterscotch sweetness, no hops, low carbonation and the overpowering flavour of the nitro widget. Some faint lingering astringency. Disappointing overall."
"Pours out to a reddish cherrywood color with a stormy presenation that calms slowly, leaving a dense creamy head of foam. Nice. Aromas of toasted bread and grains. Taste is quite light, nearly weak; light malt, caramel, some tea like bitterness. Not bad, but too light. Mouthfeel was good, rather creamy and smooth. Drinkability is average. Not bad, but needs a big boost in the taste dept. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: not bad! this one is pretty light, has nothing objectionable, and of course it's got the nitro going for it. Definitely a session candidate. Think of it as Boddingtons' Irish cousin."
"This is one of my favorite session beers. If I go to pub I always get a pint of Kilkenny. It might not be that great to savor but it will do for a long night of drinking and debauchery."
"Drinkable, just not that enjoyable."
"Drinkability: high drinkability and moderate alcohol content make this a solid session beer."
"Comes out with a nice auburn copper color and a thicker egg white head. Looks like a lighter Guinness from the pour. Good sheets of lacing around the glass. Aroma is weak. Maybe some toffee and pear but that's about all I get. Taste is also too weak for my liking. Some caramel is in there along with hints of fruity hops. Creamy in mouthfeel but this is still a bit too watery for me. Just kind of bland all around. I could session this, but why would I want to. Reminds me of Wexford's offering but not as good. Not impressive."
"Mouthfeel is total nitro: creamy, lightly bubbly. Needs to lose a bit of the metallic harshness to become more drinkable."
"amber colour with lace, only a bit of head. Light mouthfeel, creamy and on dry side. Not much taste, but quaffable, in fact quite smooth. Good amount of malt and some carmel. Decent aftertaste though drying. Session ale. Whiff of roast in aroma. 440 ml."
"D: It's a little filling, but it's still a great session beer. It use to be my winter staple... very hearty."
"The mouthfeel is utterly amazing. The carbonation levels are absolutely perfect, and the beer is absolutely silky smooth, with a good body to it. I'd certainly have trouble drinking more than one or two of these in a session (despite the slightly lower alcohol content), but it's still a joy to drink on those occasions when I do want to treat myself to something a little pricier and for that it still scores some points in the drinkability category. Kilkenny Irish Cream Ale is certainly worth a try, and I will say that, if nothing else, it's one of the few beers I've ever had that presents just as well from a can or bottle as it does on draft."
" Kilkenny is not run of the mill macro swill but still not very good at all. Somehow I just feel the recipe probably is decent but the brewer tried to use cheaper ingredients and faster methods and this is the result."
"Smell is very sweet, slight roasted malts, not much of a bitter or hoppy smell to speak of. Taste is quite bitter and roasted. Slight sweetness, but the scales tip on the side of bitterness. Not much complexity. Mouthfeel is extremely watery, nothing to bite the tongue at all. Maybe this is a nitro thing? Not really my cup of tea though. I like to feel the beer in my mouth. Sticks to the throat though, dry finish. Slides down like nothing at all. Drinkable, but not so much my thing."
"This is my favourite Irish Red, which isn't that big of an accomplishment seeing how the style isn't really for me. I can honestly say if you do like Irish Reds, you probably will love this one."
"Pours a deep red with a light beige head consistent with other nitro beers I've had: thick and creamy. Smells pleasant, roasted malts and a bit of sweetness. Taste is slight, with some smooth malts and hops presenting the most strongly. Creamy and easy to drink, an enjoyable brew."
"Pours a clear light copper under a thick one finger light beige head that lasts literally forever - most of it was still there when I drained the glass. Very little lacing, however - interesting. There's a pleasant nose here of malt and spice, with a touch of cinnamon sweetness. The mouth is light, clean and mildly carbonated, smooth as milk somehow. Everything about the taste is mild here: opening malt with a touch of fruit, followed by some dry and bitter hops. A slightly bitter aftertaste fades fairly quickly, leaving a watery feel. It's OK if you have no better choice, but the experience is ultimately unsatisfying."
"Drinkability- Was rather a nice thirst quencher at the time, but other than that, nothing spectacular."
"It disappointed as I think it was a better drink from the can"
"I brought a bunch of the delicious brew back from a trip to Ireland several years ago and really had to savor each can; because when I asked Guinness USA why this beer isn't available in the US, they told me that it would be a direct competitior to the pub can stout that they produce. Fair, it would take away from sales of the original, I'm sure. But this is s completely different style of beer. This is a Red-Cream Ale, with an enormous and beautiful head, and a smell of a heather field from the Emerald Isle herself. It has a full, rich body with malt to spare; and the finish goes on forever. I highly recommend this brew, and would consider trading to get my hands on more."
"Drinkability: Goes down unbelievably easy. I could toss these back all night long, but nothing memorable except for the smooth feel."
"Bleech. I've never been a big fan of Kilkenny, but I hadn't tried one in several years and thought it was worth another shot. Especially since it's my brother-in-law's favourite beer. Bought a 4 pack and split it with him. Both of these wound up going down the drain. I can't get this pine taste out of my mouth. I feel like I've been sucking on a branch of a Christmas tree. I don't know if it's psychological, but I don't think I've had a nitro can yet that I enjoyed. Shouldn't be the nitro that puts me off, but whatever, yuck. It'll be several years before I have one of these again... unless it's on tap, that might make a difference, but I doubt it."
"Red in colour with your typical nitro qualities of a lasting head and thick mouthfeel. There are some candy-sweet malty aromas from this one, a slight mineral note, and a somewhat strange veggie smell as well. The flavors are dominated by a slightly sweet malt component, along with some iron-like well water flavors. Overall, it's an ok session beer, but nothing special."
"On-tap, served in the proper labelled glass. A nice looking inch of off white head of creamy thick bubbles. Bright , clear pale amber body. The head lasts the whole way down, with full coating of lace on the glass. Nitro kills alot of the aroma, buyt there is some caramel comining through. Full flavored with toasted caramel malt balanced by some hop bite in the end. Nice creamy thick mouthfeel and it goes down smooth. Better on tap than from the nitro-can."
"Pours a dark red color, almost brown. Smell is strong like a traditional lager, almost like Stella. The taste is like a lager as well, although there are many more hops added to it. Its almost thick going down, no doubt due to the nitrous. There is lots of overall flavor, and its very multi-faceted but its heavy in consistency."
"First time I had ever saw this beer,never saw it in the U S.Poured from the a nitro tap a deep amber with a nice creamy head on top,pretty blah aromas though some highly kilned malt and caramel but pretty faint.Like alot of nitro ales flavors are pretty week,nice creamy mouthfeel helps but the faint caramel sweetness leafy finish is just to faint and subdues.Well Iam glad I had a chance to try this but its not something I would look for again."
"I guess it depends on what you are after. If you want a beer to sit and drink with friends this is a good one, but if you want to focus on the beer, there isn't much to keep you interested in the long run."
"Its a little pricey as well. But overall, a good pub beer if your pub has limited selections."
"Not bad at first, but I find the whole ale gets downright disappointing by the time I've finished half a glass. Not my ale of choice, that's for sure."
"Looks good out of the can - dark amber with strong lacing and head retention a little too good, and artificial-looking. Smell - chemical, aluminium can, some hop scent but not nice. Taste - I'm ambivalent. I think the real flavour that goes with this beer is the ashen smell and taste of old men in a small smoky Irish pub. Somewhat lacking when the surroundings aren't right. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, a little harsh from carbonation. So easy to drink that you could enjoy it anywhere out of the way when you felt like a few pints. Costs too much for what it is, but it's better than a lot of shit they try and serve us."
"Better on tap, but very nearly on par in the widget-cans."
"It is right in between Caffry's and Guinness on the flavor scale."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed to discover this brew and I recommend it for a heavy drinking night."
"*This beer was in a nitro can, I forgot to put it in that category*"
"Worth a try, but dont go out of your way for it."
"This beer was, as advertised, deliciously creamy. It pours sort of an reddish brown. The appearance is almost guiness like in terms of the thickness of the head. It does not have a particularly pungent smell, and the smell is that of a typical pub ale, such as boddingtons, or the like. This beer's greatest attrubite is, in fact, its spectacualrly creamy mouthfeel."
"A great session beer in my mind...and always better on tap."
"All in all, a nice ale, probably will buy again, the nitro really helps the head and creaminess"
"Deep coppery brown with a dense, cream coloured head. Plenty of lace down the glass. The aroma was very mild, with some floral hops and light toasted malts. It had a light biscuit or toasted malt flavour with a mild bitterness that lingers through the finish. Fairly smooth, partially due to the light carbonation, and it had a light body. Dry finish, partially due to a light grain astringency."
"Notes: Had this one in the Temple Bar District of Dublin in April of 2004."
"Nitro can: Poured a creamy light brown beer with a nice thick creamy head that has lasting retention (the head is similar to the Guinness). Aroma is very light with some small notes of malts. I founded the taste to be very creamy with some small notes of roastiness and sweetness. This beer was a bit dry at the end with a small watery aftertaste but again subtler then Guinness. Overall, this is a very enjoyable session beer from a decent brewery."
"I do not really know cream ales enough to judge this one on another basis, but it was certainly not my favourite. The pour, brown with a head and sinking bubble appearance like a stout, immediately releases a considerable malt aroma that describes most of what the beer is- extremely sweet on a full body with no carbonation, and just a slight bitterness at the end, which doesn't match with the rest properly."
"Back in the days when i was totally into cream ales, i gave this one a try. Upon pouring the appearance looked very nice, nice creamy head, darker looking red ale. Smelled of hops, and malt. When tasting, all i can remember is tasting what i thought was tin, not very impressed. For the available cream ales we have here, i reccomend Tetley's anyday. Although i don't care much for cream ales anymore, even though my nickname implys i love it. Back to the Belgians for me!"
"Do not bother with this, yet another inspid ""creation"" from a once great brewery."
"is this a good indication of the style? im not sure...i think in the end, kilkenny is o.k, but give me a murphys irish red any day of the week."
"Poured out a dark red with a thick creamy head that pretty much stayed 'til the end. Thick lacing too. Not particularly exciting. No strong nose. No strong presence in the mouth. A light hopy aftertaste. It was just too thin for my liking. If offered this beer at somebody's home I'd take it, otherwise I wouldn't bother. (4.3 abv in a 440 ml can)"
"Notes: Overall nothing special but definantly worth it for a night of constant drinking. Would choose the draught over the can any day."
"The head is super dense and levitates on a redish/brown/orange hued sea. Smell is rather meek but taste is slightly fuller. Taste is sweet, mellow, with a touch of vanilla? but lacks the bite of other red ales Ive had such as Erie and Murphys. Mouthfeel is typical of the Guiness family--thick, creamy, and luscious. The beer is drinkable but rather boring, especially when other options are presented."
"4.3% abv from a 440 ml nitro can. A great looking ale, big, thick creamy head topping a clear pale amber body. The head lasts the whole way down, far more than just a thin cap. Aroma is primarily of sweet caramel malt. Taste directly matches this, with a small touch of hops on the finish. Nice thick mouthfeel and it goes down velvety smooth. Nothing exceptional about this ale, it's actually pretty plain and average and very straight forward, but it makes for a good session beer, and it sure looks pretty."
"Aside from the insanely thick and dense white head on this pint, I really can't say I find anything special about this one. The color is a reddish amber, and the nose reveals very little about this one. It goes down easy enough, but the hops and/or malts just aren't prominent enough for me. I was expecting alot more judging by the looks. Ah, well - at least at this pub they also had Murphy's, which is a far better alternative for me! :)"
"Flavor is rich and creamy, with a sweet maltiness and loads of apple and pear fruitiness. Light caramel flavor, with a mild hopping in the finish, provinding some dryness. Smooth creamy texture. I didn't notice any metallic taste, which was good, considering it came from a can."
"pick up a six pack at the liquor store."
"At the end of this review, all that remains is the original thick creamy head minus a little of its original depth."
"There are so many versions of Smithwick's/Kilkenny now that it's almost impossible to keep up with them! Still, I think I've got it under the right heading here. This is a nitro can exported to Canada with 4.3% abv. It pours a deep copper with an orange/reddish cast. The off-white nitro head is exceptionally creamy and maintains a solid 1/4"" cap throughout the pint (well, 14+ ounces anyway). It leaves some nice lace and gives the impression of ""a proper pint"". Within the nose a softly sweet and gently buttery caramel malt darts in and out through mildly earthy/mineral Fuggles hops. The body is light but creamy; and accentuates the balanced toasty, caramelish, and lightly fruity malt. It finishes dry and biscuity with a lingering note of dull buttery caramel. It's very easy to drink with a decent amount of character. A nice session beer! Worth trying."
"F."
"My little bro introduced me to this beer a few years ago and alas, its not bad but not as good as the memories of it."
"Do not waste your time and money on this beer if you buy the can. If you want a great beer, drink this beer from a tap. But, they do not sell this beer in the U.S., yet. What a waste of brewing this beer and putting it in a can!"
"i've heard kilkenny is just smithwick's renamed in order to appeal to a younger crowd, but i can assure you it's a completely different beer. a very good irish red ale that's an excellent session beer. pours a reddish amber with a fairly thick, creamy head. i had this on tap while in ireland, but i believe it's still unavailable in any form in the US, which is a shame because i certainly miss it."
"Cheers"
"First one was pretty smoothe but the second didn't tase as well."
"Readily available in Canada, I regularly partake of this classic beer.  Few beers have a better appearance than Kilkenny.  The deep red colour and cascading carbonation of a freshly poured pint are prime examples of the style.  The taste is near heavenly; smooth and well heeled, without significant bitterness.  Kilkenny is truly drinkable, I could drink this daily for the rest of my life and be a happy man.  I feel sorry for Americans, since you apparently can't find Kilkenny in the States.  My favourite beer, hands down."
"A hearty Irish red ale...unlike the watered down versions we typically see in the US. Darker too than most with a pleasant, not cloying sweetness. A smooth, easy drinking but flavorful session ale. While not necessarily something to be sought out, it was a nice find amongst the many pils styles on a recent trip to Europe."
