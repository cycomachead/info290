The aroma is very pleasant and is of bananas, cloves and citrus for the most part. Even more going on with the taste. Lots of sweetness is right up front with the above flavors with some honey, black licorice with a hint of coriander even. Not to sweet and this is a sipper with the high alcohol content that warms your tummy. Perfect carbonation and full bodied with lots of good flavor. Goes down fairly easy but take your time and enjoy.","BeerWithMike","Jul 29, 2014"

The flavor follows suit. Quite sweet but tangy at the same time. Definite alcohol and yeast notes but we'll balanced by the sweet malts.

4.16,2.2,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 8/16/2013. Pours lightly cloudy golden orange color with a small foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy esters; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, bread, honey, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, banana, clove, pepper, bread, honey, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately crisp and slightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a great tripel! All around great complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

Pours a somewhat hazy, golden-amber color; heavy cloudiness in the middle, fairly volatile with a large, foamy white head that dissipates surprisingly quick. The aroma is great - baskets of sweet, earthy esters, spicy Belgian yeast and bread, clove, white pepper, phenol alcohol, bananas, apple skins, pears, and a nice whiff of bubble gum. The taste is no slouch, either. Final Absolution hits the palate soft and slightly silky, medium-bodied and with a high amount of carbonation. Belgian yeast flavors - bready, spicy clove, pepper, banana esters, earth, and bubble gum - dominate the palate. Some floral and perfume-like hop notes hit up front with a very short and sweet bitterness that quickly gives way to the rest of the flavor profile. The aftertaste is heavy on the bread and yeast flavors, like you would expect from any decent Tripel.","tectactoe","Jul 01, 2012"

4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer was poured into a snifter from the bottle. A cloudy gold color was observed during the pour with hints of banana growing during the pour. The banana scent is a reflection of the Belgian yeast that is very apparent in the scent and taste. The initial taste was a pleasantly tart banana taste that danced along the sour borders of the tongue. A hint of spice may be observed by some during the initial sip. In the aftertaste, a hint of butterscotch becomes somewhat apparent but the banana continues. The trippel is smooth yet thick enough to stick to the tongue and allow the taste to linger. As the alcohol warms on the way down the gullet, it becomes apparent that the beer looks, tastes, and feels good.","JohnnyHopps","Apr 22, 2012"

At first glance I see it is bottle conditioned as it has yeast on the bottom, give a swirl and let it rest a bit as to avoid playing "beer hunter". Popping the top of this brew it smells, well, yeasty. Also very malty with hints of licorice, spices and candies. Pours to a cloudy yellow orange with a fizzy off white head that recedes quickly. I'm letting it warm a bit as this is one I don't want to drink too cold. On the first sip the first standout is mouthfeel. Mouthfeel is like syrup with a fizziness that adds to flavor. The flavor is sweet at the start almost citrus like but then quickly shifts to a sour tartiness that then transitions into a slightly bitter finish.

Suggestions of some pith. Peppery throughout with a fairly dry finish. Body is very heavy for a tripel and the carbonation a little lighter than normal. Unfortunately i like my tripels feather light and cottony. Drinkability is ok. This is definitely a different take on a tripel, not bad at all, but not one of my favorites.","numenor1","Mar 27, 2006"
3.88,-4.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Amber. Phenolic, fruity and spicy aroma with hints of sugars, banana, clove, cinnamon and ginger. Again, very phenolic and a rather typical creation that shows a lot of fruity esters, banana, clove and fruits. Yeasty as hell and the hops are quite spicy in their lingering bite. Sugary. Good stuff.","Crosling","Mar 27, 2006"
4.04,-0.7,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Think with not very much carbonation, has some fruity esters in there, has a spicy kick to it as well. The 8.5% alcohol warms up the mouth and throat.

4.38,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours crystal clear orange color with a creamy looking white head that dissipates slowly. Sweet malty and fruity aroma with a slight clove/coriander/spice character. Medium body, good carbonation, sweet malty background with a moderate fruity flavor and warming alcohol feeling. The light bitterness and spices balance out the maltiness and the candi sugar sweetness quite well. Not to miss for trippel fanatics!","blackthistle","Jul 15, 2005"
3.95,-2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Nice. Poured out to a golden amber color with a nice foamy head that held up well. Some lace noted around the glass. Scent of spices and pine are noted as well as some sweetness. Traces of hops and an almost vinegar like character were also noted. Flavor was complex, with overtones of caramel, clove, spice, hops and a good kick of alcohol. Finished with a syrupy like taste and feel. Kind of weird. Still, its a well made beer, but on the expensive side for what you get. Recommended for trippel fans.","Frozensoul327","Jun 01, 2005"
3.38,-17,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a golden amber with a slight head. Aroma reeks of malt with some acidic green apple notes, alcohol, and faint bananas. Taste is very rich malts enfused with bitter green apples. Although there is some subtle bananas, the apples really come though. An interesting take on the trippel style, although I'm not sure I really like it. Alcohol is present in the flavor, but to a small degree. Mouthfeel is kinda thin, nothing too interesting. Overall, the flavor is pretty acidic, on account of the apples. It diminishes the drinkability. Not sure if I would pick this one up again, but it was interesting nonetheless.","BeerFink","May 13, 2005"

The taste is of a sweet triple ladden with spices in the nose the alcohol carries slightly into the finish and follows with the yeast flavor. The body is thickish but I enjoyed it and I could have several more of these.","Higravity","Dec 14, 2004"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep copper, much darker than most trippels I have encountered before. Stick, yet small bone white head. Aromas of candy sugar, bananas and pineapple. Sweet malt and sugary palate. Again, bananas show up in the finish. A very pleasing palate. Well done. Coating, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Thankfully, the good carbonation prevents it from being too thick. A nice beer. I hope this brewery's other offerings are just as good. Definately worth a try. Thanks to Realale for this opportunity.","winomark","Dec 13, 2004"

3.8,-6.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nearly clear, golden colour with a thin, long-lasting white head. Very mild sweet/fruity (banana) aroma with a light spiciness. The flavour was quite complex, with ripe fruit, spice and belgian candy sugar all coming to the forefront at different times. A light alcohol flavour was also perceived, but was not strong and didn't detract from the other flavours. Lightly carbonated, medium/heavy body and very smooth texture. Quite a decent beer with a nice balance.","DrJay","Aug 05, 2004"
3.87,-4.9,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"12 oz. bottle brought back from Michigan from BA pals cupbeerman and beergeek279. Pours a deep orange copper color with a short-lived tan head. Very decieving, colorwise, for a tripel. Nose is very sweet and tropical, like Swedish fish candy. No hops discernable. Phenolic and estery. Fusels meld the taste with the aroma. Reminiscent of Heavyweight's Lunacy Grand Cru a little bit. Further notes of tropical fruits; papaya, banana, kiwi and mango and a good dosage of clove. Good, but flawed a bit by its synthetic, tropical taste for it being classified as a tripel. Healthy carbonation. A little too amber tasting for what I like in a tripel-style Belgian; it's missing that dryness I so yearn for.","crookedhalo","Jul 31, 2004"
3.85,-5.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Served from a 12oz bottle, sent to me courtesy of trbeer. Color is a fuzzy deep orange, just a bit hazy, graced with just wisps of thin white head. Aroma is very sweet and full of peach and fruit esters. Taste is initially fruity and just a bit bitter, then becomes very sweet and malty through the middle, nice caramel flavor. Alcohol was noticeable but not overpowering throughout. Finish brings out the barest hint of peppery spice, as well as a slight bit of banana and some of the bitterness comes back to wrap it up. Hops make anice appearance in this tripel. Body is quite full, but a nice dryness in the finish as well. Very enjoyable.","mikeys01","Jun 09, 2004"

Plenty of tea-like sweetness and herbal character, backed by a dominant, and aggressive spicy/yeast character, more pepper, phenols and faint grass that rounds the soft bitterness. Warming alcohol presence. Some toasted malts, caramel and blossom honey characters are also present. More clove. Bubblegum flavours pull through as the beer warms, toward the end, where the beer finishes with yeast residuals. Pretty decent tripel, complex and tasty.","Todd","Dec 30, 2003"
3.82,-6.1,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"I heard that they only bottled a few cases of this so I guess that I am lucky for being able to get it. Anyways this was one solid tripel but its flavors were slightly immature. Definitely a strong yeast precense and the yeast strain was excellent and made the beer what is was. The other flavors were very fruity and strong banana flavor at that. The banana flavor was almost too strong. I also noticed some grape flavor and plums. Slightly bready and slightly bitter in the finish. This beer was well carbonated and had a nice slick mouthfeel. All in all a good beer but definitely could use some aging to mellow that banana flavor.","granger10","Dec 28, 2003"
