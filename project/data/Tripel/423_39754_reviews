"This is a phenomenal tripel.  It is really well constructed and balanced with a nice dry finish. More please."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very nice tripel, hops seem to be providing a unique character to it; comfortably sweet, nice and plush, modest aromas..."
""
""
""
"Overall-Had high expectations for this beer as a Belgian style brew from Boulevard, and wasn't disappointed. excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another very good beer from Boulevard, not spectacular, but certainly enjoyable and worth a try.  4."

"Best tripped I've had this far"
""
""
""
"Golden with huge white head and good lacing.  Bubblegum and white pepper most prevalent in the aroma. Peppery alcohol and honey smoothness in the mouthfeel and taste, with hints of apricot, pear and a bit more gum.  Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What a cheese ball name...and I love the Grateful Dead so I had to try this latest punnery...OH MY GOD...what have I in my paws but the most delicious Tripel I have ever tasted. The alcohol so well hidden and such a complex flavor, a unique color. This this trip was better than the one at the Alpine Valley shows where myself and these three girls ended up in my tent and ...went to sleep. Great shows though, and great beer!"
""
""
"This beer does nothing for me.  First it is too strong and difficult to drink.  It tastes like grapefruit juice water.  I don't see how this is rated so high.  Just my opinion."
"O - This is an outstanding Tripel. The flavors are very balanced and make this an enjoyable experience."
""
""
""
"T: Balance is spot on, not too sweet or heavy-handed with the Belgian candi sugars like some other beers I've had. Excellent peppery, lemon, and woody hop presence keeps the banana in check. Slight sulfur, and good pear flavor."
""
""
"Tastes great! Wish my favorite store still had some."
""
""
""
"O - Very good Tripel. Makes me wish I'd bought the 22 0z bomber."
""
""
""
""
""

"A well executed Tripel. Complex and true the its Trappist counterparts."

"If i had to choose a beer to sit back and relax on the beach with, this would be it"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice American representation of the style - very enjoyable. The beer is relatively easy to drink though there is a light amount of alcohol present as the beers warms up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light color, lots of foam.  Dry.  Typical Boulevard taste.  Should have checked the date on the bottle before I bought it.  Will try a fresher one next time."
""
""
"In the end, there was a little wet cardboard stale taste to this pour, which I am willing to write off as age.  Will update my thoughts on a re-review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a classic beer here from Boulevard.  Solid flavor yet unique and keeps the drinker interested.  I would like to try it fresh, this bottle was aged a bit, but very nice."

"Wonderful Belgian! yeasty.....weird purple grape taste in there.....dunno what that is but it just tastes great! one of if not my favorite belgian! I like it better then Chimay! and its less money when you can find 4 packs!"
"Very good beer worthy of repeating."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a well made, easy to drink beer. A lot of character and complexity with this beer."
"A standard pour yields a voluminous rich whipped froth with a waffled top comprised of big airy chunky bubbles...  Rock star retention...  The color is a very pale muted amber...  There is a slight haziness throughout...  A cyclone of micro bubbled quick carbonation in the center of the glass with a few stray bubbles elsewhere...  A subdued Belgian yeast presence...  Some overly ripened light colored fruits...  Golden raisins...  There is a mix of floral and grassy notes mixed in as well...  Just a light touch of honey as well...  Good depth and complexity...    The palate is an exact reproduction of the aroma...  On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Prickly carbonation...  Sleek with a touch of dryness throughout that intensifies on the finish...  Slightly sticky...  A rock solid Tripel...  The apperance is the rock star here with all other facets being solidly above average...  Good stuff...  I'm becoming a bigger fan of Boulevard with each and every passing brew I try..."

"Overall: Full disclosure, this is one of my all time favorite beers in the world. I tried it for the first time two years ago when I was visiting a friend in Utah and it has haunted me since. I've had the pleasure of its company only twice since we first met. If anyone knows where to find it in NYC, please let me know. If you see it at a store, take it home with you. You won't regret it."

""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is quite a good brew. Unfortunately, I read in a few other reviews that this beer tastes kinda soapy and now I CAN NOT shake this thought from my head every time I take a sip. When I first tried this I would have rated it higher but it really is kind of soapy. What can I say, It's no Fin du Monde but it is a welcome change of pace."

"A very well done, tasty Tripel."

"OVERALL:  this is an excellent Tripel, tastes like it came from Belgium but was made in Kansas City, MO.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style.  It's reasonably priced at $8.99, I'll definitely buy this again."

"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Golden color with a luscious thick head. Nose has notes of light stone fruit and white pepper. Tastes great; triple is a style that is growing on me. Perhaps too drinkable. Lemony flavors abound with a nice kick of both alcohol and spiciness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is slightly hazed golden yellow with a tight white head. Nose has a fair bit of tangy yeast and peppery spice up front. A bit of soapy hop and some lemon notes. Taste is a bit more soapy, yeast isn't quite as pronounced. Lemon is moderate, not sweet but the balance is a bit soapy. Body is a bit syrupy but the strong carb helps to balance it."
""
""
""
"High alcohol content that does not take too much away from the flavor. bready and banana ar e the high points of the taste. Head is good and flavor is surprisingly balanced. Hops are balanced and go well with the banana, yeasty flavor. Great overall balanced brew and a must have for the true beer lover. Great Trippel"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle a light gold with only a touch of haze from the rising bubbles. The white head starts big, but leaves quickly. A fine aroma of bananas, yeast and spice. The taste follows the nose with lots of banana, apples, yeast and a nice sweetness. The carbonation gives the mouth a light crispness. Simply an excellent tripel that tastes like it came straight from Belgium."
""
""
""
"The beer itself pours a smooth, small bubbly white head that dissipates fairly quickly but still collects around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a hazy gold with a bit of orange notes. The smell has strong banana yeast notes with strong hints of bready malt notes. The beer also a slightly sour hop note that seems dulled by the other notes. The beer itself is fairly bananas. The banana notes are just as strong in the taste as it is in the smell but the hop sourness adds a bit of balance to the yeast and candi sugar notes. The malts have a stronger bread taste. The mouthfeel is fairly medium bodied with biting carbonation but on the lighter side. The beer also has a very smooth feeling despite the carbonation. Overall, a pretty good Tripel and most certainly one of the greats."
""
""
"I'm shocked that a brewery in Mississippi can produce something so akin to the products of the monks of Trappist Abbeys in Belgium. If I had to choose between the Long Strange Tripel, or Chimay White, I'd have to choose both! Will definitely drink this beer again. If there were just ounces more of hops per barrell, I might rank this a pure 5.00. That's pure subjectivity, however--the beer is still world-class!"

"This is really good. A better tripel than some Belgians make. Overall, it's tasty and easy to drink. A good beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a great example of a balanced tripel. I like sweeter beers, and have had tripels which are much more honeyed or sugary, but this beer argues the virtue of its approach."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
"Overall - happy to have enjoyed this offering, however, I enjoy a handful of other tripels more."
""
"Overall: a good american tripel. much more alcohol prone than most but not in a bad way. lots of good flavors and worth a try. This one is past its best by date but I wouldn't worry about that with this big tripel that should continue to taste good for years to come."
""
"Golden yellow with an slight orange tint. One finger head when poured, which persisted to some extent the entire time I was drinking the beer. Sweet aroma with the presence of alcohol noted. Very nice Tripel; one of the best I have had. Sweet, slightly fruity with a dry finish. Lots of small carbonation. Medium body; there is some substance to the beer - not thin or watery. Overall a great Tripel. Would definitely drink again!"

""
""
""

"Overall- This american triple beats many Belgium that I have had...Hands down...With that said 90% of my beer intact is a form of Belgium style"

"O: A beautiful Tripel, above average for an American offering, slightly above center mass for an authentic Belgian. This beer is all about the complementary aromas and flavors. The main is just there to carry the good stuff to you for your enjoyment. While the aroma is not powerful, the flavors do follow, and jump it up a bit. Not a bad beer, and a good fit to the Smokestack series."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is absolutely fantastic. The most memorable tripel I have had in quite a long time."
"A really well made tripel that stood up very well against La Fin du Monde. Pairs well with aged sharp cheddar cheese."
""
"Overall an excellent tripel but lacking some of the peppery,more spicy flavors I enjoy with other tripels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. This one is top shelf tripel. Boulevard dont play"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a orangish body with massive two finger head that dies slow and leaves lace. A spicy and fruity aroma mostly, although yeast and orange are there as typical with a Belgian style beer, but more along some floral spices and sweet fruits or close to (it could be anything although I want to say sweet apples that I like). The beer is light bodied and has a spicy edge that I found leading to a crisp finish, for the most part I get sweet, tropical fruits (apricot, mango, something in that range) and some sugary malts in the beer as this triple seems to be more sweet than most of this style. I enjoyed this beer a lot but I guess when I order a triple I expect something closer to style and not so sweet as the sweetness became overbearing at times."
""
"Overall- A good, solid tripel that has suggestions of being really good. Definitely worth a try and I will be buying this again."
""
"O: Boulevard threw in some twists to this tipel to take the traditional style and throw in some WOW factor. The taste and nose are very prevalent just like I enjoy. A must buy if looking for a tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A wonderfully constructed Tripel full of subtleties and nuances that make for a great example of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty awesome beer. Tasty, clean, has classic Trippel flavors but comes across as, not mild but balanced, restrained. Controlled. A nice sipper for a long strange evening."
""
""
""
"Will pour a five+ finger white head that fades slowly but leaves no lace. Almost clear pale amber color. Fierce carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet fruity malt nose, and flavor is sweet citrus and coriander. Higher ABV is hidden. Best by Feb 2014, $3.69 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
""
""
""
""
"Gold, clear with little floaters everywhere (sinking fast to the bottom) and a whole bunch of carbonation bubbles. The head on this is fantastic. Large, billowy, sticky foam. Aroma is sweet, floral, delicate, spicy, and soothing. Warm apple pie slides to mind. Taste is a welcome match. Sugar cookie dough, fruit, spice, banana cream, and coriander-like. Mouthfeel is smacky through the finish/almost chewy. Smooth and medium-fullish body. Delicate carbonation distributed evenly throughout. Overall very nice. Always a great style for the holidays and this is a very enjoyable example of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" All in all, a bit weird, unique for sure, but the flavor's don't work together as well as some of the top Triple's. Certainly good enough for a second chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer. Something different. Not my favorite style, but lots of flavor in this beer. Would only take one or two! Will pick up from time to time for sure"
""
"The feel is not as carbonated as one may expect with the rush of bubbling in appearance. Light, refreshing but not thin at all this hides the strong ABV very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you didn't look at the bottle, you would never guess it was an American Belgian. Boulevard nailed it."
""
""
""
"A very enjoyable brew. This beer was certainly one I plan to have again. A very nice example of a tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Loved it, and I think the extra (and accidental) bottle conditioning didn't hurt."
""
""
"D: I am no purist and am far from an expert on this style but I found this to be a relatively tasty brew and very drinkable. Not a big fan of heavily phenolic brews and this one suits me just right. Would definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - There is nothing at all wrong with this beer and a lot of good things going on with it. It is almost a perfect example of the style with a hoppy finish. I really like it and will get my hands on some more and try later."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice looking beer with a smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation was spot on. The alcohol was well hidden due to the spicyness and sweetness. It's like it doesn't want you to know. Overall a great example of an American take on a Belgian style."
""
""
""
""
"Taste mimics the nose to some extent. Bright, rich and juicy, with guava, lemon, grapefruit, green raisins and honey. All enshrouded in yeasty funk. Seems juicier tasting than a traditional tripel, but there's a buttery richness in the middle that speaks to its heritage. Starts out really bright and dangerously drinkable, but as it warms and mellows becomes sort of buttery, warm and boozy. Very nice, unique, refreshing quaff."
""
"Wow. I found this in my supermarket, which will remain nameless, for $10 a four pack. This is one of the best beers that I have ever had, AND THEN I find that the Bros. gave it 100pts. Their description is perfect. I wish I hadn't read it before I wrote my review, because now I don't know what else to add. The smell is divine with fruit and malt and everything as it should be. It poured just like a good beer should, with plenty of sticky head backed by a subtle and subdued carbonation factor that was pleasant in the mouth and the nose. All of the tripel flavors are there and in full force. What is wrong with this beer? Nothing. I love the effort, I love the concept, I love the homage, and I wish I has been born Trip Houge and been able to live up to this gift. I hope that my life can one day be summed up in an offering such as this. Reach out your hand if your cup be empty. Hopefully, some king head will fill it with this."
"Very flavorful, fairly hoppy tripel that matches if not exceeds my expectations. I continue to be impressed by Boulevard and this beer didn't disappoint at all. It hides the big alcohol very well and manages to even be a pretty easy drinker. Not overly sweet, just a little light in body, yet that's not a problem at all. Subtle hint of spiciness, which goes well with the fruity flavors. A very solid tripel that I will drink again. If not more than once."
""
"Overall, a highly enjoyable beer. Packed with flavors, rich texture, and I would say dangerously drinkable given the 9% ABV that sneaks up on you."
""
"O: I do not like belgian tripels too much but I would buy this again."
"Boulevard is a class act IMO"
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the better Trippels that I have had to drink. Refreshing and full of flavor. Try it if you see it. Thank you Matt for the bottle."

"Overall (4.5/5): Long Strange Tripel is probably the best American take on the Belgian Tripel style I've had to date. It's fairly traditional, but there's nothing wrong with that. It's fruity, yeasty, generously carbonated, and–despite the high alcohol–quite easy to drink. Awesome flavor and exceptional feel. Get it when you can in four packs."

"Long Strange Tripel pours a a golden color with a nice large lacing head. There is a sweet yeasty aroma with strong notes of Belgian candies. Taste is much of the same, very strong yeast and strong Belgian candy flavor, with a finish that is of banana like esters. Full flavors full body, but just too sweet. Overall a flavorful tripel that is differently good, but on the sweeter side."
""
""
""
"O: One of the best American tripels I've had. Very easy to drink and is nicely complex without being overwhelming. Great value as well. Get some if you're a fan of the style"
"I am becoming a BIG fan of Boulevard's Smokestack Series - I sure wish Boulevard distributed to Michigan! - hint, hint."

""

"Big, very delicate head, close to four fingers of off-white foam, so interwoven you hesitate to call them discrete bubbles, some dimpling before is slowly settles back down into more of a gentle wave, pleasing amount of stickiness in the lacing, broad streaks too. The liquid has a hazy golden yellow to apricot orange color, fierce amount of bubbles but dispersed and not in tight beads, seems to be some very fine particulate throughout. The nose starts off with a peppery burst before cinnamon, clove and allspice begin the sweetening, culminating in banana, peach, apricot, white grape and spiced orange peels, over time you also get toasted bread crust, pretzels with a white vinegar edge. In the mouth it’s full-bodied and thick, the carbonation creates a rich creaminess rather than refreshing briskness. Here the sour orange to white grapefruit citrus leads the pack leading into salt and pepper, clove, chamomile and bitter grasses, the latter welcome as a foil to the at times dried fruit sweetness in the apricot, apple, peach, pear, pineapple fruit, fairly tropical. On the clean side and not blatantly yeasty, its sourness keeps the palate tightening. The banana and bubblegum make a minor appearance at the end, retronasally and stronger as the beer warms. Great drinkability, no overt sense of its higher ABV."

"T: Caramel and slightly bready malt upfront with a nice kick of spicy yeast in the middle. Citrus peel, mainly orange, coriander, hints of earthy hops and just a hint of alcohol on the finish. Very smooth. A nice tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was good and a fine American version of the style, but it lacked something and let me down just a little bit; it was good, and easy to drink, but I wish there was perhaps more hops adding some different aspect of the flavor profile and attack. Hopefully this beer was consumed as intended; I ordered it online from LetsPours and the bottle listed Batch T12230 with a “Best By Date” of 05-2013 – I ordered this in mid-June 2013, so that was disappointing to read after it arrived. Overall a good beer, but did I miss its peak flavor???"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-not normally a huge fan of triples but this is excellent. I'd definately recommend this, even if tripel isn't your favourite style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An enjoyable, well-balanced Tripel. I'll gladly have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid American tripel. Golden and beautiful, this is a great beer to look at. The nose is a little less inviting, not in an unpleasant way, but rather behaving like a parent who is too busy to show up for their kid's soccer match. The hops shine through here more than most tripels, and It's easier to drink than its 9.25% abv would suggest. Crisp with a good amount of carbonation, this is lighter and easier than say Allagash Triple or Chimay Cinq Cents, but a little less complex than something like Tripel Karmeliet. Definitely worth a shot if you enjoy tripels or Belgian goldens."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Boulevard's Smokestack series is among my favorite lineup of beers, and this one is no exception. This one is up there when it comes to tripels and it's everything you want in the style; refreshing, drinkable, complex beer."
"Overall: One of the easiest drinking 9% beers I have had. This is also a fantastically balanced, superb Tripel. Boulevard really knows how to make some killer Belgian-style beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good represention of the style and has some nice complexities in the smell and taste. Some alcohol is noticeable in the taste, but it doesn't really detract too much from the drinkability."
""
""
"Overall: A fantastic domestic tripel. Among the best that I've had in fact. Should be relatively easy to obtain and you should definitely give it a try. This has been a go to for me for a while now and I still get it regularly"
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium golden amber with a healthy three finger white head that dissipates slowly leaving chunky lacing. Classic tripel aroma of bready malt, apple and pear juice, cardamom, Belgian yeast; peppery. Flavor follows with initial apple and pear juice, bread malt, finishing drier with well developed cardamom and clove bitterness. Medium bodied with a nice mouth feel from carbonation. A very nicely made domestic tripel, a bit astringent on early drinking, but developing more flavor and a balanced finish as the glass is emptied. Well done."
""
"D - Great complex and balance tripel. Very smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Stellar. I don't much care for Boulevard's everyday shelf offerings, but the Smokestack series is truly a remarkable step up. For $2.50 a bottle this is a winner through and through, and would have no problem standing toe to toe with other world class brews in the same style."

"Pours an attractive light golden amber. A very careful pour is required as the cotton white head grows quickly and sinks slowly delivering tons of lacing. Smells of bready malts, honey, pear, fuji apple. The sweetness is cut by the high carbonation and there is a slight sourness on the finish with lingering hints of tree fruit and grain. Despite its growing size and popularity, forcing a shift to larger and larger batch sizes, Boulevard continues to impress and delight!"
"O: Tasty with some good complexity, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth sipping for a while."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with medium-high levels of carbonation, resulting in a slightly fizzy mouthfeel that takes a bit of time to reach a foamy, smooth state on the palate. Perhaps my only gripe with the beer, albeit minor, is this slight fizziness. Closes quite dry, satisfying, with moderate stickiness left across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A truly exceptional tripel. One of my favorite styles and this one does not disappoint. Such a beautiful beer with complex aromas and flavors that is well balanced."
"Overall: Very delicious. Though I don't have much experience with tripels I wouldn't hesitate to get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors of sweet malts, honey, straw hops...with a slight tingling from the carbonation, and a touch of white pepper and pink grapefruit rind. Overall a darn tasty tripel in my book...smooth yet full bodied, inviting yet complex."
"A well done tripel. Still have enjoyed most of the offerings from this brewery."
"Overall this is one of my favorites from the Boulevard Smokestack Series, along with Sixth Glass and Rye-on-Rye. This absolutely one to try and is highly recommended, IMO."
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good take on the Belgian Tripel style. Nice balance of spices and fruit esters. Very zesty."
"O-very good Tripel and a decent price point for this quality"
""
""
""

"So listen to some Dead when you drink this beverage. I mean what else pairs with this. Years ago I went to a great Dead concert. That you missed. Garcia would play long great guitar solos just out in space. Go hear 1969's Live/Dead; Workingman's Dead, American Beauty, or my fave Anthem of the Sun!"
""
""
"Overall, a very nice beer. One of the better Tripels I've had in a while, well done Boulevard."

""
"Overall: Pretty solid tripel. More please."

""

""
""
""
""
"I’m a few beers deep into Boulevards Belgian styled offerings and I am impressed. Very solid stuff."
""
"Overall, very good. The mouthfeel and flavor work very nicely together, and it's got a lot going on at a subtle level without needing any one overbearing taste. Very drinkable, and the 9% isn't really noticeable, which is probably very dangerous. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoy trying Belgian style ales. This is an OK one, but not one I'd hunt down again."

"Poured into an over sized wine glass. A cloudy yellowish-orange look nicely complimented by a thick foamy head with a lot of staying power. Citrus and spice smell dominates with a sweet malty aroma underneath. Dry, tangy fruit on the front, malty sweetness in the middle just like the aroma, and warm alcohol at the end. Very nice. Smooth and velvety mouth feel. An outstanding and well-balance tripel. A must try!"

"O- Happy to find another domestic brewer producing Belgian beers. A very good Tripel that I would try again, especially at this price range."

"Pours a mostly clear, deep golden color under a fittingly large, rocky head of thick, luscious foam. Aromas of softly sweet malt, light dough, spices, herbs, and dried fruit. Malt is toned down in the flavor, though there's a nice cake-y element. Increased phenolics, peppery spice through the middle, with apple, apricot, and slight citrus juice. Creamy, fluffy mouthfeel - appropriately carbonated, drying, and not too sweet. Never boozy. Well done..."
"Pours a sparkling apple-juice-yellow color, with a massive, foamy, eggshell-white head. The aroma is an expected combination of light, tart apple-like yeastiness against dry grassy hops. The flavor has a light, bready sweetness and a bit of banana, but it is mostly a very dry, grassy, almost dirt-like bitterness that lingers in an unpleasant aftertaste. The light, very active carbonation plays off this flavor profile, leaving an exceptionally drying sensation in the finish. Overall, I will readily admit that tripels aren't a preferred style for me, but I have been able to enjoy some in the past... just not this one."
"Overall a very good representation of the style, only one I put above it that I have tried is La Fin Du Monde, which full disclosure is my favorite beer I can get locally."

"Served into Boulevard glass. Appearance is bright gold with striking clarity and cascading bubbles. Frothy white head is formed and retains very nicely and leaves heavy lacing. Nose features floral notes with heavy spice and clove character. Bready Belgian yeast looms large with accents of lemon zest. Taste is straight forward and clean for a tripel. Plenty of belgo character which provides some sweetness, fruity esters, light banana, moderate clove, and minimal bitterness. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with a medium weight mouthfeel. Overall, a refreshing, clean, and full flavored tripel."

"Overall- Pretty good tripel as far as I’m concerned. For a 9% beer, it certainly does not drink like a 9% beer. Very Unique"

"The beer pours a hazy orange yellow with a big beautiful head on top that stays for awhile and is full of sudsy bubbles that sit at top as creamy smoothness. The beer’s body is hazy, lightly translucent, and peppered with a thick torrent of carbonation bubbles racing to the top. The beer’s lacing is fat and wall-like, with rather large bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass like snow on the ground. On the nose, the beer smells quite hefeweizen-like with thick clove and banana scents alongside sweet lemon bread notes that reveal the Belgian yeast in the beer. The fruity esters on the beer are bright and lively on the nostrils, also hinting towards pineapple and some lighter tropical fruit. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly bitter, but also strongly of banana bread. The taste begins as bitter and lightly medicinal hops which slowly open into lovely banana bread flavors with splashes of lemon and pineapple, though the medicinal bitter remains as an undercurrent on the taste buds. The finish is strong with banana bread, but the aftertaste returns to the surprising amount of hops hiding in this beer, and rings with grassy medicinal bitters. On the mouth, the beer feels fierce with carbonation. The beer is medium in body, and leaves a sticky ichor briefly on the tongue as it travels down the throat. The mouth is left a little burned from the carbonation, and quite dry from the hops, though the tongue does retain some small reserves of saliva. Overall, this beer is surprisingly bitter and harsh on the mouth, but has an awesome smell and some awesome flavors. I think a little gentler of a hand when hopping this beer could be used, but it is an American Tripel after all, and what are we American’s known for if not our overdosing of hops? This is another success from Boulevard! Try this beer."
"This is a nice Tripel. The traditional flavors are evident and the strong ABV is noticeable, but tucked away. Overall, this is a solid offering with a traditional flavor profile. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Belgian beer."
"Pours cloudy gold with a dense, soapy white head that settles to a nice cap, leaving behind lots of sticky lacing. Big Tripel aromas of bubblegum, light clove, orange peel,and wheat. Very crisp and clean. Taste is similarly clean, very balanced with light wheat malt, banana, bubblegum, and mildly spicy clove phenols. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a medium body and good carbonation. Really excellent Tripel, one of my favorites of recent memory."

"The sample I got popped and fizzed like New Year’s champagne, so if you get this in a bottle, open with care - and have a towel handy. It comes out of the bottle a clear, bright solar yellow with a thick, fluffy snow-white head that leaves very generous lacing. Strong, yeasty aroma has apple and pear notes and a hint of malt. Fruity, yeasty flavor fills the mouth with apple, pear, and a hint of butterscotch, as well as a whisper of hoppy bitterness. Lively texture has good body and fizz, leaving a fruity, tingly, slightly yeasty and malty finish. Keep your eyes peeled for this one."

"Pours hazy golden with a massive head. Aroma of banana, citrus, and funky yeast. Slight bit of spice on the nose. Nice sweet banana orange flavor follows, a bit of sweet honey, and some dryness to boot. Smooth with light mouthfeel. Nice carbonation. A bit of bite on the way down. Solid tripel from a brewery that I have mixed feelings about (though, limited experience with them)."
"Verdict: A well made American Tripel from Boulevard and I think that this can be considered another success of the series. It may not be their strongest Belgian style offering, I still prefer The Sixth Glass and Saison-Brett, but this is definitely a worthy beer for anyone who enjoys this style."

"Long Strange Tripel is delicious, if a bit sweet and thin for a tripel. The high ABV is not noticable while drinking it, which along with the flavor, makes this a dangerous ale. It's very versatile, though, because the flavor and feel would be appropriate to warm weather or a special occasion."

"O: A great example overall, there is nothing lacking here. You get spice, fruit, sugar, and a little bit of hops. It reminds me of some trappist tripels that are outstanding. St. Bernardus tripel and Westmalle tripel might be slightly better, but not by a lot."

"O- for 9% abv its extremely drinkable. A mix of light fruit, bubblegum, earthy, and candy like sweetness. It's a very enjoyable brew."

"This tastes more ""Belgian"" than most Tripels I've had. Certainly one that's worth seeking out and it's an education in the style, not to mention being a relative bargain. Bought at my local Ibis Market in Mission Hills, San Diego."
"Really well-balanced. Without a doubt, one of the finest American brewed tripels available and compares favorably with many of its Belgian counterparts."

"The color of the clear body was a highly attractive golden yellow, and the pour formed a three finger head being fed by lots of carbonation streamers. The nose has a distinct aroma of lemons and coriander. The taste was very refreshing due to a sweet biscuit like flavor. There were notes of coriander and orange peel in the taste, and the finish was very dry. The beer was extremely easy to drink, and hid the high carbonation level very well. Reminded me a lot of Duvel in the overall construction, which is a great thing in my book."

"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint. Pours a golden color with foamy bubbly thick head. Great yeasty hoppy aromas, maybe some citrusy hops. Really nice funky belgian yeasty malt, with a good amount of hop flavor...peppery, spicy but mellow. Somewhat boozey malt in the finish. Mellow, balanced, flavorful, and just plain good. Great brew and worth a purchase for sure. Also..awesome name. On a similar side note... In the same ""genre"" - cambridge brewing has great (what i believe to be) Phish references..."

"gladly, my beer cellar survived sandy! a pretty good trippel, leaning towards a heavy saison. not really the right style for the season, however the high alcohol content is making this heatless night right. no electricity, no heat, but this boulevard beer is making things ok tonight."

"O-This tripel was not what I was expecting and I'll admit that it took me until the second glass from the bomber before I began to enjoy it. There was the typical tripel spice profile, but I missed a lot of the banana and yeast flavors that I was expecting. Nevertheless, it was complex and interesting enough to keep drinking."

"I really enjoyed this tripel, this was my first, I loved everything about this beer, from the the color, taste and overall drinkabilty... Great beer! I was not used to opening a corked bottle but the effort was worth the wait! I will definately buy this brew again."
"Overall (4.0): This is a very solid tripel in my opinion, not as spice-forward as a lot of others and not as fruity or dry as a BSPA; just balanced, in a lot of ways. It may not quite compare to the best examples of the style, but this is easy-drinking, smooth, and very satisfying. It’d be a very good intro to the style for those not familiar with it, actually. I’ll definitely be looking for this again—just a very solid tripel."

"Pours an almost-clear golden color with a large, frothy white head that takes some time to go down. A small amount of floaties in this one. Scent is spicy and yeasty, as a good tripel should be. Lovely pear and green apple aromas with some nice, peppery spices. Hints of white grapes as well. Taste is tart white grape at first, followed by fresh pear, and finishes with green apple. Nice balance of fruity and spicy. Great Belgian yeast flavors, and definitely one of the spicier tripels. Some definite hop bitterness, but well balanced by the spice and fruits. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, dry, and tingly. Drinkability is very high, as the ABV is well-hidden on this one. Overall, this is a great tripel. I think I've come to realize that Boulevard knows exactly what they're doing when it come to Belgian-style ales."
"O: This is a wonderful American tripel. It reminds me a lot of Green Flash's classic version with the heavy fruit character and the nice spice undercurrent. Clearly American in its approach, well worth seeking out."

"""What a long strange trip it's been."""

"sort of reminds me of avery's nineteen. similar butterscoth flavor, but this one is more balanced and understated. pours a chaotic hazy gold color with maybe a 4 inch head in this tulip glass, pure white. smells fruity like peaches and pears, but not sweet. also notes of butterscotch, floral hops, and one hell of a fun yeast. flavor is great too, very fruity at first, then tempered by the yeast which has some spice to it. touch of candy sugar sweetness in the finish, which itself is mellowed by more hops that is common in a tripel feel is eipc, smooth and brightly carbonated, drinkable forever, medium body. this is a complex brew that is worthy of its grateful dead inspired name. i bought it for that reason, and am happy i did. the smokestack series is maybe one of the best big beer series in the country right now. they have all been unique and cash money delicious. gotta check out this brewery on my next trip back east"

"Who kidnapped the monks and put them in Kansas City? Long Strange provides a quality beer experience with plenty to talk about."
""
"Appearance is yellow, some clouds, a fluffy two finger white head. Its` nose contains orange, candied sugar and lemon. While this tripel style has a taste of apricot, coriander, spice and caramel. Although it is a variety of flavors, none of them seem to stand out or present themselves as overbearing. Mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation. There is crispness to the finish. A very good tripel from Boulevard but not quite as good as I had hoped for."
""
"Beer is strikingly dry. There's no caramely aftertaste or high final gravity typical of unfermented candi sugar in syrupy Belgian style ales. No alcohol heat to betray the 9% abv, but the dryness is completented perfectly by a healthy wet hopping. Spicy and peppery. There's an intensity of flavor in this beer that suggests it might be chalky, or burn out your palate, but amazingly there's zero aftertaste. There's ample carbonation, which upon reflection, works fantastically with this tripel."
"Nice looking Belgian, dark wheat color with 1/4"" whie head with some lacing. floral aroma, belgian hops. some light citrus flavors. Alcohol was well masked, enjoyable and more complex when it warmed. I like this better than the quad- but a different style."

"O: A super yeasty and spicy tripel, mostly overpowering everything else. Doesn't make it bad at all. In fact, I quite liked it."

"O - Boulevard hits the nail on the head with their Long Strange Tripel. Aroma and feel resemble that of a straight-from-Belgium tripel! While the appearance is pretty disappointing, this Smokestack series beer can certainly hold it's own against imports."
"I absolutely loved this. Poured a 3"" champagne velvet head with a long life and floating merengues. The body is a hazy gold and the effervescence persists. It smells of Belgian sugar, malt, and a touch of sour. The taste is rich indulgence mirroring all those smells but also adding tropical fruit highlights. Fairly long finish. My only complaint is I don't really think there's anything ""strange"" about it, but that's just a name."
""
"Overall - I let the beer warm some because of the high alcohol content, poured it into the correct glassware, everything. I just don't know if the tripel is really my style. I certainly lean more towards the English style ales than the Belgian or German, and this didn't help that out. I think I will give this one another chance one day, but not if I have to pay for it."

""
"overall, a well done beer. I've been trying to get more into Belgians and this one helps out a lot. Somewhat sweeter than I expected, but maybe with a little longer aging, the yeast would finish off some of the sweetness."
"O: I think this beer is pretty good, but it doesn't quite do it for me. I've been supremely impressed with a lot of the Boulevard Smokestack series beers, but this one isn't on the same level as some of the others. All that being said... it's a pretty decent tripel."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled 04/24/2009; so this is pushing on 3 years old. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice lacing clings to the glass; with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, apple, orange peel, apricot, biscuit, toffee, pepper, clove, and yeast spices. Nice and very well balanced Tripel aromas. Taste of big apple, apricot, lemon, biscuit, toffee, pepper, clove, herbal, honey, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus, biscuit, pepper, and spices on the finish for a while. Great balance of flavors, with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink at 9%, but is still a bit of a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and well done Tripel that has held up nicely over the years. Nice flavor balance and smooth drinkablility."
"overall it was a really nice tripel."
""
"D - A great example of the style. There's nothing extraordinarily unique about it, but it's damn good and I'll have it again."
"Feels full in body with mild carbonation. Oily slick and warming in the end... Very good interpretation of the style!"
""
"Overall- This is a great tripel but I wish it had just a little more body to it."
"Pours a clear golden color with an off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grains, spices, yeast, and some sugary/honey aromas. Taste is very much the same with a slight alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good tripel with some delicious aromas and flavors."

The nose comprises clove, banana, slightly waxy orange peel, cracked wheat, sweet flowers, and the slightest possible kiss of lemon zest. The taste shows off more of the orange (now complete with some flesh) and wheat, but the rest is still easily found. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slightly grainy feel. Overall, a very nice tripel, unsurprising seeing as it comes from the quality-producers at Boulevard. Good times."

"Very highly recommended and a personal favorite."
"Overall: It fits the sweet up-front, bitter at the finish Tripel profile. The white fruit meaning pear and apple flavors make it a bit unique; however, the finish keeps this from being a very good example of the style. Glad I tried it but there are many other tripels I prefer."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, a light fruitiness and just a note of candy sugar. In the taste, a nice fruitiness, dryer yeast, and a mellow presence of candy sugar. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruit and note of alcohol in the aftertaste. Nice fruitiness and hides the ABV well."
"Well, its a good beer, very standard for the style, nice malts, spices, belgian yeast fruit, esters, nice warming booze. Perfect beer for bunkering down in the middle of a very early season blizzard with no electricity. Good for keeping warm."
"O: LST is a nice tripel that could reach unbelievable with a couple of really easy fixes of more carbonation and toning down the alcohol component."
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer. was a tasty tripel with really good mouthfeel. Would try this again."
"The taste is stronger on the alcohol side than the smell indicates. Also, there is a stronger peppery taste, particularly in the swallow. The start is almost creamy. The body is full and the carbonation is high, like a good Tripel. Perhaps the highest praise I can give is that this seems to be indistinguishable from the excellent Tripels from Belgium."
"Overall: This is arguably the best tripel I have had so far. I love how clean it is and the spicing seems just about right. I could certainly see myself picking this up again."
"overall a very good, borderline great triple; flavorful and tasty, would definitely revisit."
"A very good tripel, but I would like to see the carbonation toned down to improve the mouthfeel."
"I've traded this away many times, and am somewhat embarrassed that I have never actually had it myself. So, here we go: this bottle was so difficult to get the cork out of, that I almost used a wine opener to get into it. Seriously difficult, my wife said ""I hope its worth it!"". After finally getting the cork out, it let out a large POP. Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a cloudy light orange color, huge fluffy head fills the glass. Retention for days before I can actually drink it. Beautiful really. Smell- tart cherries, lemon citrus, bisquity bready aroma. Taste- nice sweet and tart cherries, followed by a dry bitterness, some watery qualities to it, but not a knock on the beer at all. This is refreshing, complex, and overall hides the 9% ABV like a charm. Glad to be able to get this year round, yet another solid offering from Boulevard's Smokestack Series."
"I picked up a bomber of this one at Lukas Liquors a while back, and eagerly looked forward to cracking it open. Poured an opaque golden color with a large, prickly white head. Aromas of bubblegum, yeast, candi sugar and white pepper. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of bubblegum, spice, lemon, pepper, yeast and candi sugar. Quite enjoyable."
"Great beer."
"Packed with flavor, the only strange thing about this Tripel is how little it strays from the best Belgian examples of the style. Well done."
"O: hands down one of the best tripels I've had and easily THE best belgian I've had from an American brewery. I want more!"
"Very refreshing, great mouthfeel, highly enjoyable beer."
"Boulevard gets its grubby American hands all over the traditional Belgian Tripel and finishes with a beer that is bound to turn off the most purist of the beer drinkers. However, the Long Strange Tripel is really only different and not inherently inferior. It lands right in the middle on the totem poll, and maybe even a bit higher depending on what mood your tongue is in. The appearance actually forebodes what the beer has to offer. It's a deep amber color, very orange. This differs from the usual light and yellowish tint most tripels have. The head is slightly off white, about 2 fingers worth, and the beer is wonderfully carbonated.The smell is where the beer is most triumphant in its uniqueness. I get a lot of yeast, some roasted malts and apples. Some alcohol is present along with more fruits. A richer aroma indeed. Then the taste really kicks your purist gut and doesn't apologize. I prefer the traditional brew, but clap clap to Boulevard for doing something new in a year round manner. Yeast, alcohol, apples, pear, roasted flavors highlight a beer that stands out, but not really above, the pack. Mouthfeel is heavier/creamier then most tripels, but is wonderfully carbonated and works extremely well to enhance the enjoyability of the beer. Overall, worth a taste. I may not go back to it, but the new flavors may attract some repeat customers."
"Overall very enjoyable, and an uncommon-tasting tripel."
"Ovearll a good tripel but, for $10, I would go with a St. Bernardus or Westmalle for a little more or a sixer of New Belgium for a lot less."
"Overall probably my favorite year-round beer the boulevard has, great flavor great beer!"
"O: A unique tripel. It's a bit thicker and darker than most tripels, but it works fairly well. I just wish it had a somewhat lighter body and less bread/yeast flavor. Still, a decent beer overall and at least it's not another sticky sweet bubblegum bomb like many tripels."
"ENjoyable and straightforward, I enjoyed this more than the other tripel I split during the evenings events."
"DELICIOUS, SEEK IT OUT!"
"I've read that this is a very good interpretation of the style. While I don't have a lot of experience w/ the Tripels or even some of the Belgians for that matter, I have to say I really enjoy this beer. Now I have a solid idea, from this & some others, what to look for in a Tripel. Prosit!"
"O: Honestly, this is absolutely the best Tripel I've had in a while. Maybe it's because I dig Boulevard's taste profile in this setting? Dunno... but this one worked for me."
"Drinkability: A nice, flavorful drink. Unfortunately, this doesn't make it to Ohio, so one and done for me."
"This is a nice little tripel from the good old USA. I think I paid about $8 for this bottle when I bought it. I would say that makes this beer a nice value. Well made and nicely drinkable."
"O: A good Tripel. For drinkability's sake, I'd rather have a New Belgium Trippel, but this Boulevard entry may be more true to the style. Of the Smokestack Series I've tried thus far, I'd rate this ahead of the Seeyoulator Dopplebock and below Tank 7."
"Well done, Boulevard. This smokestack series continues to impress."
"(750ml bottle courtesy of jrorie!!). Pours a hazy apricot color with quick dissipating head. Lots of carbonation. Aroma has candied sugar and dried fruit. Taste is sweet with a bit our sour. Bitterness is very low and reminds me of citrus peel. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Finish is smooth with the alcohol noticeable mostly because it warms the throat and chest. The sweetness is a tad to the high side, but its a pretty nice beer. I’d drink this again with pleasure."
"D - interesting tripel here. Reminded me of an amped up wit or Weiss bier. Pretty different tripel,"
"Nice hint of yeast and bread in the aroma. The taste is a little peppery, and not as sweet as other tripels I've had, which is fine. Alcohol noticable in the finish, may want to age a bit to smooth out, but a nice tripel nonetheless."
"I like to start my reviews in the order of the way one would drink the beer. So to start it has a nice amber look to it with a little murky tinge to it. If not poured properly you will get a lot of head. Not a bad thing, but just delays drinking the sweet nectar. Long strange is a very sweet and sour beer. I taste oranges and lemons. The finish is very sweet almost like biting into a piece of candy. Overall, this is a very good beer and well made. I would recommend this beer as an after dinner drink. Cheers."
"Pours a golden color w/ a three finger egg colored head which lingers a little bit. Carbonation is pretty high w/ this beer. Smell is that of spice, corriander, yeast, lemon peel. Citrus smelling without being overbearing. Nice... Taste is that of corriander, spices, yeast. The alcohol at 9%, is completely hidden to me. I'd almost like a little alcohol burn on this one, just like my favorite Belgian Tripels. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and light, and the aftertaste doesn't stick around forever- medium range length for the aftertaste. All in all this is a good example of a tripel, and I'm really glad work sent me to a part of the country this was available."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being on the higher side. Overall it was a pretty decent beer. It had some nice flavors to it and was pretty drinkable as well. not bad with regards to style either."
" ~ This is a good beverage. I think it to be worth the sampling."
"Opinion: I am really happy with this beer. It is undoubtedly a Tripel and it definitely holds water against the classic examples of this style...so I think that is saying a whole lot...so kudos to Boulevard and their Brewmaster. That said, I would pick up St. Bernardus or others over this one, but they didn't come from The States...and that is a plus for this beer as you don't get this high of a quality Tripel from The US very often. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"Pours a dark golden color with almost no head. No head on a tripel--are you kidding me? Bad, bad, bad. No good. The nose is a bit of malt with some very light phenols. Taste has a bit of bread with light yeast character. Not impressed. Feel is light with low carbonation. Overall, not impressed. This is nowhere near a tripel, let alone a good one."
"Now comes the imortant question...anyone got a recipe? :D"
"Drinkability- Easy to drink Tripel for me. I enjoyed the bottle with a friend and could easily have popped another one. Now onto a Chimay."
"Drink- Outstanding for a US tripel. Loved it."
"D: Fairly decent, pretty good bang for the buck a bit high in the abv, but a nice one to share with friends."
"Mouthfeel: Low/medium body with slightly coating feel to it. Alcohol is hardly present, even at 9%"
"I would like to feel more carbonation and/or hops on the finish just to give it a 'zing'. Otherwise, it drank very well and pounded the whole bottle rather quickly. Excellent"
"D: For an american belgian tripel, thsi is quite close to some of the best authentic belgian beers. They haven't messed with the style and it is quite enjoyable. i would buy this again."
"D: Where's the fresh orange? Oh wait, wrong tripel. My head is still focused on Tripel Sec. This is an admirable entry into the tripel realm, solid flavor and little in the way of booziness (despite the bigger strength)."
"I prefer this to the Westmalle Tripel I had last night. Very flavorful, I wish I could get more of Boulevard's big beers!"
"Notes: Not entirely sure what to think of this. The flavors were nice, but then I thought they got to be a little overwhelming. Strong on the spices but a slight sweetness in the background."
"D: Very good and would recommend"
"All in all, it's a good example of style...perhaps not my favorite, but it's solid. A bit disappointed at the lack of spiciness."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light to medium body, with some fine carbonation that makes this beer pretty smooth. This beer is 9% alcohol and it really is hidden very well. It's not my favorite tripel that I've had, but a decent brew nonetheless."
"I drank a different beer while this one warmed up. It got fairly warm but it is very appealing. Nice carbonation and medium body. Very drinkable. I could not detect alcohol. It is like I could drink more of this but I know better. These guys are turning into one of my favorite breweries. I have yet to have one of their big bottles that I didn't like."
"Boulevard...I married my best friend there and we keep coming back to the gorgeous brews to be had."
"Overall/notes: First time using this glass (Maudite snifter)! Found it cheap. While the appearance isn't all that grand, it tastes fantastic and should be appreciated. Finally, a really good Missouri beer. I'm proud of my state!"
"Lots of toasted fruit flavors mixed with some very light caramel malt flavors. Te carbonation gives teh palate a dry pop at the front. The alcohol just warms and relaxes the palate and body. Pretty good."
"A terrifically easy drinking brew... Well done Boulevard"
"D - I think the dryness of this one makes it stand out against other tripels."
"Very impressive, looks like someone did their homework before jumping feet first into this Belgian style. Kudos to Boulevard for this most excellent Tripel."
"D- Alcohol will hit you, but this is still a good drinking tripel."
"Average drinkability due to the thickness but perfect the way it is. Wouldn't want them to change it for anything."
"A pretty decent brew. I prefer it on the cooler side, say 45F."
"Hmmm....this beer is medium to light in body and has some carbonation on the palate. Beer finishes slightly dry with an out of place bitterness on the back that makes this beer slightly hard to drink. Not my favorite tripel for sure."
"And I say all this despite the high ABV, a parameter that I tend to prefer around the 5-6% range (generally, at least for everyday use), and have difficulty with when it's up in the 8.0 and higher range. Not today. This 9% tripel blows that theory out of the water. Delicious, a five on taste for sure, and an amazing 5 on drinkability. Well worth the price I paid for it ($7.50). I can't wait to get another. I'm bringing a couple of bottles of this for special occasions with my closest contacts for sure."
"This is a very solid example of the Tripel style, certainly one of the better American versions I've had. It retains a very Belgian nature while also expressing an Americanness (mostly because of hops). Worth drinking."
"Poured a hazy orange color with a large frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate to heavy citrus, yeast and small alcohol aroma. Medium body with a smooth sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Solid complex brew."
"D- You don't feel the 9%ABV until you have finished the beer. It never peaks out and the crispness of this beer makes it quite thirst quenching. Another Boulevard Smokestack beer that impresses me. I am looking forward to trying some of their regular offerings."
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a large white head. The aroma is orange citrus with Belgian yeast, spices and some alcohol. The flavor is alcohol, citrus (oranges and pears) with some coriander, pepper and Belgian yeast. The alcohol is rather strong in the aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation."
"D- A unique and enjoyable take on the style. The alcohol is a bit apparent, but the enjoyable flavors to this keep this drinkable. I prefer this over many Belgian examples."
"Overall, very good. Pick some up if you can find it."
"D: Substantial flavor and body in a tripel that not too over-done."
"D - This is a fantastic beer. Boulevard is probably the most underrated brewery in the country."
"pretty damn good and recommended. i love all the sweet and juicy spiciness this smokestack offering provides. yummy stuff."
"d: Very drinkable for the style, I would pick up this bottle again. Thanks Buddy for having me over to try!"
"Drinkability: High, this one disappeared"
"""Looks like there's tapioca suspended in there."""
"D: Like a mash-up of a hefeweizen and a tripel...in my book that's a good thing. I continue to enjoy Boulevard's Smokestack series...well done! If you are looking for a more by-the-book tripel, you might want to look elsewhere."
"Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this but I really didn't enjoy much. I can't say it was bad but the Tripel is definetly a different beer style. I have had several of the other Smokestack series and enjoyed them all very well - just don't know on this one right now."
"Extremely drinkable for the 9% ABV. A really well-crafted beer overall, one of the better American examples of this style that I've had."
"Long Strange Tripel was a different beer. It had some similarities to a hefeweizen. It is a dark yellow color, with white head that lingers. You can definitely taste the alcohol in this beer, it is 9%. That might affect the drinkability for some. Overall, a decent beer, but probably not my favorite."
"Although not up to my standard for this style, which is La Fin Du Monde, still a nice beer. It is a bit spicier than usual, which makes it an interesting choice. This one is very reasonably priced here, making it an excellent bargain."
"Drinkability is pretty high given the abv. This is a really excellent tripel. I'm really looking forward to trying some other beers in Boulevard's Smokestack series."
"D: easy drinking here, especially for a triple. Definitely not for everyone, but this beer will be in heavy rotation in my collection."
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable, I suppose, for the ABV, but the alcohol and mouthfeel combined make for a brew that's a bit hard to get down in any greater quantity than slowly sipping it. I wish the rest of this brew held up to the appearance and nose, which were phenomenal."
"Drinkability: A very solid tripel, and one I'd be happy to try again. Sure, it has its flaws - a little chemically in places, too phenolic and spicy in others ... the yeast strain on this one was a kicker, no doubt - but on the whole it has more plusses than minuses, and that makes it a winner in my book. I'd love for them to Brett this one like they did with the Saison - now that'd be something to taste. At 9.0% abv, it's a little on the top end, but again, not so much for the style. Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability is a strong point for this beer. A really enjoyable and quaffable American triple. This stays true enought to the style while not being as intimidating as some others. A good effort by BLVD."
"D: Yet another excellent Boulevard Smokestack series beer. Delicious and very refreshing!"
"Mouthfeel is quite amazing, therefore the 5. Drinkability is amazing as well, seeing as I consumed this within 45 minutes."
"Not remarkably complex, but it is very drinkable and the alcohol well hidden."
"There is a bit of a flat quality to the flavor. Maybe aging isn't so good, (if that's the issue). The initial aroma had a great fruity quality that I was never able to capture again anywhere else in the drink. Nonetheless, this is drinking just fine. Finishing off the 750ml solo won't be a significant issue."
"I would say get some. Around here the price is quite good by comparison and the ale stands up with anything for drinkability, though the depth is a bit lacking."
"Finally got to try the Boulevard Tripel, unfortunately I was a little let down. Not quite as flavorful and complex as I hoped, especially after I was impressed by their Quad. Still, it is a pretty good beer and was worth the $8."
"Lastly, while this didn't factor into the score, I did love the bottle and the name (but I love the Grateful Dead song in question)"
"I found this beer at a local grocery store that had about two dozen good micros; a below-average selection for this area. Among those, however, was a case of this stuff for $8.99 a bottle. I don't know what the beer buyer there was thinking, but I shall be patronizing this store again soon."
"D: A good tripel that hides the alcohol fairly well; a very drinkable beer"
"Great effort at a Belgian style tripel! Poured a large foamy frothy white head and a load of lace. Aroma is subdued. Flavor's spot on. Has that Belgian vineous character. The Belgian version might be a tab more dry and crisp. This one has plenty of body and a hair less carbonated. Feel the booze. Tasty."
"Well, I don't think this is the best tasting since I've had this beer before and I don't recall this much chalky/musty character. Perhaps this bottle is too old? It's hard to say since it only has an undecipherable bottling code. Stay tuned for another review with a hopefully younger and better bottle."
"Poured a corked and caged 750 into my Smokestack chalice. This beer pours a burnt apricot with a massively tight, creamy, off-white head which leaves Double IPA like lacing down the sides of the glass. Really sticky lacing. The head retention is amazing. There is always a half inch head sitting on top of the beer. Boulevard has mad a really pretty beer. The aroma is typical Tripel. Apples, pears, sweet Belgian candy sugar, all tied together with a nice Belgian yeast spiciness. Boulevard has mad a spot on Tripel. The flavor profile is exactly what a Tripel should be. The flavor hits up front with orchard fruits imparting overly ripe pears and crisp green apples. Next comes light pale malts, sweet confectioners sugar, and white pepper. A slight green apple peal twang lingers on the palate. This beer is extremely balanced and with a 9% ABV the alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is light, with a bright carbonation. I wish the mouthfeel was a bit creamier. Over all, I think Boulevard has made a great example of the style."
"Taste is also sweet and spicy with fruity notes and the 9% abv comes out after a few glugs..Sharp carbonation on the tongue with average drinkability."
"D= A damn good American tripel, among the best I have had from this country really. If they left everuthing else the same and doubled the amount of yeasty funk flavor, this would rival the best of Belgium. Excellent!"
" D- This beer is a bit thin and light which is ok until the big boozy alcohol heat and pungent hops bitterness covers up all the subtle flavors."
"A solid tripel from a domestic brewery and I was glad I was able to obtain many of the smokestack beers through a friend. My only complaint is it felt a little too full in the body but I won't have any trouble finishing this whole 75cL bottle by myself."
"Soft carbonation up front that tickles the tongue with a heavy yeast medium body. Lots of earthy funk that again is not sour or acidic. Lots of estery light golden fruit, especially apple, pear and most prominent, banana. Nice peppery spice with a bit of zesty corriander that is slightly countered by a subtle malt backbone. The spice is very prominent up front and lingers throughout over the other flavors into a long dry finish which is slightly bitter. The alcohol is evident in the flavor but their is no warmth whatsoever, making this one dangerously drinkable. A bit to heavy on the spicy side but has a nice full body and complex flavor."
"I think that the flavors are quite appropriate but they are not balances well with phenols and other yeast character. The body makes me want a Chimay White. Thanks again Exiled!"
"mouthfeel is excellent, very well balanced. excellent drinkability here although it's a touch sweet."
"D: For 9%, it's good. I could throw back a few and there's not anything that would hold me back. Very sippable as well. But I'm just not crazy about it over all."
"Mouthfeel had pin-prick effervescence. Alcohol sizzle. Medium to full bodied. One of the best Tripels I've had."
"D - Refreshing but noticeable ABV."
"D. Sweeter than other Tripels, which suits my preference. Very drinkable and almost no trace of the higher ABV. I am yet to be dissapointed with a Smokestack Series beer."
"I'm glad I tried it, other BAs think it is good and my hat's off to them, but this isn't one I'd drink again. No slant on Boulevard intended as I find *most* of their brews very tasty and very drinkable. This just wasn't for me."
"750 corked & caged into a Chimay goblet. That ""pop"" always makes my mouth water. Light, cloudy golden in color with a ""snap, crackle pop"" soapy head. Smells of flowers, butter, and pepper. Is that good? It is, but I just can't make it sound that way somehow. Aggressive spice up front that melts into a warm caramel roundness and a crisp apple finish. Very, very, very nice. Mouthfeel is dead on, slippery and very carbonated. Drinkability? I pity the bottle that it is not larger. Which is saying something at 750ml. Very balanced and refreshing, a note of alcohol warmth and my evening just got an extra star in my own personal Michelin guide. Prost!"
"Mouthfeel- Mildly carbonated, a little slick in the mouth."
"Very nice triple. In the middle of the Smokestack series, but another very nice effort from Boulevard. I'll keep buying them if they'll keep pumping out fresh brews."
"D- Anytime, all the time."
"Probably tastes as good as a Hennepin (which is so not a farmhouse ale it isn't funny) but I'd NEVER buy one given the label."
"Great beer, I enjoyed this."
"Drinkability is hard to pin down. Alcohol is toned down, flavor is quite tasty, though chalky bitterness hurts it a bit. Otherwise, a finely crafted beer."
"dark golden yellow head. huge head, lacing everywhere in glass, nose is spicy and floral, hints of ginger, clove, taste is spicy, somewhat floral, a bit hot, overall quite nice. served about a bit on the warm side which seems to add to the hotness. quite peppery throughout. mouthfeel has a good level of carbonation. deceptively easy drinking"
"Large bottle, caged and corked, pours cloudy darker apricot, loose and also fine bubble light head and film, bubbles rising to the top....light sheeting and just spots of lace...fruity nose, notes of tropical fruit, gin, juniper bite, smoke, yeasty goodness. Tasty and complex triple from Kansas City..who would have thunk it...good stuff"
"Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy golden orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice three-finger thick/creamy off-white head, with some very nice creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast and spices. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, yeast, and a nice touch of spice. Medium body, a little to spicy/hot for me. Drinkable, this is a nice brew, but not as good as other's I've had to date."
"Conclusion: This is a very nice tripel and a great value in retail stores for around $7.99...this was on special at Kelleher's for $9.00 a bottle, what a steal!"
"The depth and attention to detail that this Tripel provides is top-notch. This truly takes the great Tripels, you know and love, and takes it up several notches. I love the Americanized edge, yet the reminiscent spot on take on the Belgian Tripel style. I've always been a fan of Tripels, and this one definitely impresses. Very nice work Boulevard!"
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet fruits, melon, peppery spices, and yeast. Flavor of spicy bready yeasts initially with sweet fruits (apple, pear) and tingling spices. More spicy/yeasty than fruity. Solid triple, very drinkable."
"Boulevard has stepped up their game in the last year or so with the release of their Smokestack series. Long Strange Tripel is one of the best American examples on the market without a doubt in my mind. Thanks again for the bottle, Jeremiah!"
"Bold orange pour. Billowing fluffy belgian head. Spicy clove, white pepper, honeyed malts, and some minty and grassy hops. Nice pear and green apple flavors upfront. Ghost bannana notes from the the yeast esters. Lighy biscuity pale malts lead into a spicy dry peppery finish. Very complex. Nice full on body. Carbonation is spot on. Wow, this is a great example of the style. If this were a blind tasting, I would be sure this was a belgian import. Fantastic job Boulevard. Would love to have another one of these to put away for a while. Big thanks to Springdogg for the chance on this one."
"This is a wonderfully authentic tripel. The folks at Boulevard seem to really get Belgian style brews. Its nice to see another authentic tripel brewed on this side of the pond."
"A 750ml corked bottle poured into my basic tulip glass. The tripel appears a clear bright amber color with two fingers of fizzy bone white foam. Nose and flavors consist of spicy yeast, fruits such as pear, pineapple, tangerine, black pepper notes, honey, sweet and dry with very little alcohol presence. Carbonation level is medium to moderate. All tripel fans should look for this one."
"Excellent, I have had a few trips, quads and the like and this is a must have."
"I've really been enjoying the Smokestack beers I picked up. All of them are relatively true to style, yet the put enough of a twist to make them their own. This one has a little something in the aroma, I'm thinking a dash of American hop, I'll check their website after this review. I usually don't care for overly peppery belgians (unless it's a really good saison), but this one is fantastic. What more is there to say? If you are into complex, challenging craft beer, you need to try this."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I'm really impressed. After the saison's, this one really shows they know how to do Belgian blondes. For a stronger tripel, it's super tasty, clean and smooth. Decent price for the premium packaging to boot. I'm looking at the scores I'm giving it, as they keep creeping up through the bottle, but I really can't knock it further in any category. Really well done tripel, I didn't even have to give it bonus points for the overt reference to my all time favorite band!"
"Overall, one of the best there is imo. I love this stuff so much."
"drinkability: high, especially a little bit warmer"
"D-Moderate. Not the best hit from Boulevard's Smokestack Series, but by no means a miss. This would be an enjoyable brew to share with a few friends on a cool spring evening."
"Thanks to ballewblake for the opportunity to try this one. 750ml bottle - batch T8007 served in my Allagash tulip. Poured a golden-orange with a frothy, off-white head that dissipated into a solid skim; spots of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose is herbal, muted candi sugar, toffee and some light fruit (star fruit perhaps). Taste follows nose, but I also get some apricot in there as well. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied and sparklingly effervescent. Not your typical tripel - different in character but very enjoyable."
"Update 3/5/15: Still think this is too close to a saison, not enough bright bite to match most tripels. That said, it is delicious."
"Recommended."
"overall just an average tripel, does not match up to others."
"D: Pretty deceptive for being 9%. This one goes down very easily. I would recommend sharing it though. Nice beer all the way around. I'll definitely be picking up another one of these."
"D- All in all this is a pretty good example of an American Trippel. It has all the right notes and is fairly complex. My only complaint would be that the alcohol is a little to prominent on the backend and gets stronger as the beer warms. I will drink it again for a change of pace, but there are several good Belgiums for around the same price I would buy first. Cheers!"
"Pours a huge foamy whitish colored head, bubbles, but diminishing somewhat. Very floral aroma, dusty. Sweet and strong. Very perfumy. Sickly sweet smelling. Light soft taste. Some carbonation. Very floral taste. Light fruit, like pear or apple. Some malty skunk present too, but very light. Pretty tasty."
"D: Very drinkable for a 9-percenter. A solid tripel and quite enjoyable."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the trade! 750mL corked and caged bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a somewhat crisp pale orange that is hazed by massive amounts of bubbles and floaties. The beer is topped by a nice frothy eggshell head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves slight lacing. Aroma is sweet malt, orange peel and a touch of citrus and yeast. The taste is a nice blend of slightly sour fruit and sweet malts with a nice spice presence as well. The beer is slightly heavy with a slight syruppiness, but still maintaining a refreshing character. This is a very respectable American brewed Tripel."
"D: This beer drinks much lighter than its ABV. I had to make sure I didn't down this too quick. The beer's alcohol is almost completely masked, which is quite the accomplishment with this much of it on hand. This is a very nice tripel that I'm glad I picked up."
"Drinkability: Although it lacks a little in the complexity department, the beer more than makes up for it in drinkability; no fusel alcohol flavors that mar so many tripels"
"Pours a golden color with a head of larger sized bubbles. Had this beer right after I tried the Saison. The Tripel smells almost identical to the Saison. The noticable belgian yeast aromas mixed with an apple fruit aroma. The taste was much like the smell. Belgian yeast and slight apple fruit flavor. There was a nice warm alcohol and spiciness in the finish. There was some hop bitterness in the finish, but the alcohol and spice overpowered the bitterness."
"A pretty good stab at a Triple. I can't say if it is one of my favorites of the style, but very enjoyable. Something I would recommend."
"750ml bottle $8.50. Clear yellow color, almsot no head. It smells like spiced apples. I guess this does taste like a tripel but its subtle and the alcohol is well hidden. The quad and the saison have been my favorite from this series so far but this was tasty."
"Overall a very nice tripel! This is, to me, actually preferable over Duvel. This would be a good one to bring to dinner parties for the beer-drinking-challenged."
"Pours a hazy golden color. Huge head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, banana, slight hops, and slight tart malt - smells really enticing. Fits the style of a Tripel. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly chewy with a high carbonation level. Very smooth and easy drinking. Tastes of tart malt, banana, sweet malt, slight hop background, a nice smooth finish of tart malt. The relatively high alcohol content is well hidden and the associated dryness/tartness of a Tripel are lessened by Boulevard. I highly recommend this brew!"
"D - One word can describe this beer. Phenomenal. Wonderfully subtle, amazingly drinkable, this beer is sure to please. Do not expect an in your face brew, the beer has a million subtle notes and is meant to be savored, sit back deep into an adirondack chair, watch the sun set with this beer accompanying you. Yeah, its that kind of beer."
"D - very smooth and drinkable"
"Poured into a 375ml chalice glass. A golden/ coppery color. Wonderful head retention. Doesn't have an overpowering alcohol flavor. A beautiful, smooth example. It was my first beer from the Boulevard Brewing Co. will be purchasing again, for sure, and looking forward to trying some of the other beers."
"Overall the best of the Smokestack Series I've tried so far (this, Double IPA and Saison), very nice to drink."
"D: Wow. Yes. It's drinkable. Problem is, it's too drinkable. Doing this review after the first glass, and, can't wait to tear into the rest of the bottle."
"D: A very quaffable brew. Damn, Boulevard!"
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy orangey/copper color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of spicy yeast with some fruity ester and nice Belgian malt backbone. Taste is also a nice mix between some spicy and somewhat peppery yeast and some fruity ester with light peach notes while being very well supported by medium sweet Belgian malt. Full body with limited filtration and good carbonation while alcohol is not apparent. Very well done and probably one of my favorite US brewed tripel."
"Long Strange is admittedly a bit strange, but this is a good American Tripel and with some tweaking, I think could be up there with the best. Recommended if you find it."
"Thanks to kkipple."
"Still, this is super balanced and drinkable."
"Rich layers of crystal and Belgian malts unfold and quickly mix with grassy hops and fruity yeast esters. The booze balances on unrestrained, but never quite crosses that threshold, instead contributing a welcome warmth to the finish. As this tripel warms, the booziness intensifies, but it never becomes unpleasant. Mouthfeel is of medium consistency and super well-carbonated, bordering on too much bubble, but, like the alcohol level, never crosses the line. I can feel my stomach warm as I near the half-way point of the first glass. *smiles*...Pretty solid Belgian interpretation, here--kudos to Boulevard!"
"Very drinkable beer if I could stay sober long enough to drink more than 1 of these huge bottles! I might have to put the cork back in just to see how the other half of the bottle holds up in the fridge over night."
"This beer pours a majestic golden pale color with a very large white head that sticks around for quite sometime. This beer looks amazing, it's paleness reminds me of that Duvel color minus the slight yeast haze this beer possesses. Smells of bready yeasts with some fruitiness to it as well. Taste is pretty solid on the sweet bread-like tripels usually have. Slight fruity sweetness to it, fairly balanced with a hint of alcohol on the finish. Pretty well rounded tripel, nothing standout amazing, but solid as an American offering."
"Drink: This is very drinkable for the abv. I could see my self getting into trouble with this beer."
"Probably my second favorite of the Smokestack series."
"Drinkability: nice b eer alcohol heat brings the drinkability down a bit."
"This is another very good beer from the Smokestack series and, so far, I'm impressed with this series. Looking forward to trying the others."
"D- A nice drinkable tripel that offers up a little taste of belgium. For the price point and being made in the USA, this is a nice treat. Will drink again."
"This is honestly probably the most accessible Tripel I've ever had. Maybe not as authentic as some would like (not as much extreme funky yeastyness), but it is a really drinkable, balanced, and enjoyable beer. In all truth, one of the most exciting beers I've had recently: shows that American breweries are capable of making good Belgian-style ales that don't taste of alcohol and aren't obvious copycats. I certainly won't give up my Westmalle, but this will certainly get on my 750 mL rotation around here..."
"Drinkability- Another good tripel. Not quite Tripel Karmeliet, but very good and quite exceptional for and American brewer. Would not turn down a glass of this."
"D. Not an excellent attempt, but a good one and an excellent beer name and label!!"
"This beer pours a cloudy light orange color. The head is a massive, billowy three inches in height, and recedes very slowly leaving lace chunks all over the glass. The aroma is of passion fruit, orange peel, wet hay, barnyard funk, with a hint of floral hops. The taste is very funky up front, with citrus fruits kicking in later on, and then receding into a lingering funky finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice and lively tripel. I will certainly drink this again."
"I've now fully realized that this Smokestack Series is something special."
"Pours hazy gold with a frothy white rocky head. Clean, fresh aroma of spun sugar, clove, apricots, straw, yeast, and gingerbread. Sweet, yet tangy taste without being syrupy. the combination of clove and rosemary is incredible as it gives it a taste of sweet sage. More clove and yeast towards the back, with the gingerbread cookie finish. Everything is subdued without losing any flavor. Excellent beer."
"A very fine tripel from the folks at Boulevard. So many nuances to smell and taste."
"Been waiting awhile to taste the series and I was not disappointed by this one! I live outside Chicago but am from KC and finally found the beer in Iowa."
"Good stuff. Plenty of fruity hops step forward as the beer breaths. Yum."
"I would definatly have this one again. This is the best of the series from Boulevard Brewing Co."
"As far as the artwork on the label, if we graded these this beer would get an A+ from me for the groovy, hippyish label art."
"Wow! Who knew such a good, authentically Belgian triple would come out of Kansas City!"
"Super impressed with the Smokestacks I've had the pleasure of trying. Well done, Boulevard."
"Beer starts off sweet and spicy on the palate, giving way to some tart fruit, with a yeasty banana finish. Finish is a bit dry and a little heavy on the carbonation for me. A very good tripel from Boulevard. Probably my second favorite of the initial Smokestack releases behind the double wide."
"Drinkability- I rarely enjoy tripels (unless we really count some of those Unibroues as tripels), but this one did almost everything right that most tripels do wrong for me. The 9% goes down quite nicely, never trying to show up the sweet and spicy flavors. I could drink a lot of this in one sitting. If they fixed the head retention, this beer would be a monster. This beer could have a Unibroue sticker thrown on it and you wouldn't second guess it. That's a big compliment in my book."
"D - I totally enjoyed this brew and will trade for more."
"The head bubbled up with a tiny delay, making me glad that I poured the glass only slightly over half full. The clean white bubbly head simmered down quickly, however, leaving just this thinner layer after a minute or so. By the time I finished, there was just a small, thin ring of white lacing at the bottom of the glass. The smell was clean and fruity, with an earthy undertone, and a heavy reality check on the alcohol content (9%). The appearance was a bright golden hue, cloudy and carbonated. The first sip was a knock out for me, not having had anything else to drink before hand. ""Whoo, that's some strong beer!"" came from the husband. (But he drinks Bud Light.) The first sweet, fruity, malty hit on the tongue gave way to some crunchy, pepper-ish sensations. This beer is not heavily carbonated, and after the first initial sips, the alcohol-burn seemed to go away. Or I stopped noticing. I liked it. A lot. But like other abbey tripel style beers, I can't drink too many. They make me sleepy. :)"
"Drinkability is moderate to high. It's good tasting, and a pleasure to drink. After a few sips you start to notice the alcohol heat, but it works well."
"Mouthfeel was fine and as far as drinkability goes, I wouldn't pick this one up again, I strongly preffered ""The Sixth Glass"" over this one."
"D - Probably my favorite of the series, vying for first place with the Sixth Glass quad. This is outstanding beer that I wouldn't hesitate to drink again... despite the high price (which really isn't that high if you calculate how many equivalent 12 oz 4% ABV beers are in this heavy hitting brew...you really are getting some bang for your buck)."
"A medium bodied solid Tripel that is very authentic and worthy. I think Boulevards Smokestack Series are top notch in quality and style."
"An American made Belgian style brew that can actually compete with a true Belgian. Very nice job here. Tasty, with subtle fruitiness."
"Enjoyable and easy to drink tripel, another nice Belgian style done by Boulevard. There smokestack series continues to impress."
"With this in the Duvel glass and me kicked back enjoying a crappy day indoors; it can't get any more drinkable. A good brew and I must say one of the best American takes on the style that I have tried so far."
"Pours a hazy golden with a huge white head. Smell is Metallic, phenolic, decent, not great. Taste is better, a light amount of malt, followed by a flavor of bananas, with a light finish of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, carbonation levels slightly high. Drinkability is good, a great example of a Tripel, another good one from Boulevard."
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs, Imperial Beach CA"
"A very impressive beer from Boulevard, it sure is nice to support local brewers with a smile. High ABV once again makes for limited consumption but definitely worth trying out. Look forward to trying out the others in the Smokestack series."
"Poured a hazy, creamy orange color with a nice two finger head, into a chalice. Somewhat floral aroma, grassy, big hits of lemon, mild banana, spice, and slightly boozy. Very nice. Taste is sweet up front, a bit grassy, spicy, hints of malted wheat, a touch of citrus, and long, dry finish. A mild alcohol warming in the mouth and throat. High ABV presents itself, but in a good way. Good carbonation, feels slick and smooth on the tongue, creamy, medium-full bodied to say the least. An excellent take on a Belgian-style Tripel. As close to the real thing coming from this side of the pond."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1"" beige head above the clear dark golden brew. Head is moving and grooving, but keeps on trucking, with average to good lacing. Aroma is sweet and effervescent, with spices present amply as well. Taste is a spinning experience of sweet, spice, and alcohol warmth, all flavors coming on spearately now and again. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and drinkability is good. Numbness does seem to slowly appear on the tongue and at the back of the throat, but this one's worth the effort."
"Pours slightly hazy with some nice orangish colorings,the head is tall and light with a soft appearence,but it holds itself up for quite a while. The nose is dead on,citric tart and spicy. Flavors are much the same as the nose with one ingredient not standing above the rest,this is a great Tripel. Lots of clove and pepperiness,slightly sweet and consistantly yeasty. The mouth feel was first class,good texture and carbonation. Damn I'm glad this was a big bottle. Get some people!!"
"D - This is quite a nice tripel. Boulevard continues to impress me with their Smokestack series. I was a bit skeptical at first, but this is the second that I've been pleasantly surprised with. Check it out if you can."
"D: This is a balanced and easy drinking brew that hides the alcohol well. Oh, and you've got to love the name."
"Still pretty tasty and a decent cut at a difficult beer to brew, but I doubt if I would seek out another bottle of it."
"Excellent."
"This is possibly the best of the smokestack series that I've had, besides the saison. will definitely buy this in the future for a solid tripel."
"D-Would love to have this around often and would also love to age one to try I belive this would be the best of all the smokestack to age."
"A good Tripel but far from my favorite. High ABV ensures limited consumption. I did enjoy this one more than Boulevard's Saison"
"Split two ways into two pint glasses. Pours a light yellow with alot of carbonation and strong head. Smell has some light fruit and spice. Taste is not as pronounced as most tripels, but it's certainly not subdued by any means. A good amount of sugar in the taste. Not overly carbonated like alot of triple, making this beer pretty drinkable."
"D: Pretty deceiving ABV, but damn good taste, if not a bit sweet. I could drink this all night probably."
"Thanks to whoever brought this bottle to the RBSG 08 Grand Tasting. Gold pour with an excellent facsimile of a lacy Belgian head. Overripe green apple aroma, some sweet citrus. Flavor is doughy malt with apple and banana esters and a touch of clove spiciness. Medium-thin body, well-carbonated, dry finish. A pretty standard tripel."
"pours a champagne like cloudy lemon color with a ton of carbonation. the smell is good, has a sugary aroma to it with some citrus in there too. taste is great, the effervescence on the tongue is awesome as is this the whole beer, i dont know what makes a tripel a tripel, maybe the yeast but it sure is awesome."
"very drinkable beer, good looking, tasty just a quality tasty tripel that is rather true to style."
"Pours a hazy golden, huge and thick white head forms, drops a ton of lace and settles down to a thick layer, great retention, looks great. Smell is sweet and sugar, white wine, fruits, yeast, wheat, orange and tangerine, apricot, some spice, really good. Taste is sweet, honey, grass and wheat, yeasty, a ton of fruit, wine, spicy finish, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, very smooth and easy drinking, alcohol is well hidden. Very nice tripel! Thanks Russ!"
"Overall not a bad Tripel. Alot of American versions don't really come close, but this is pretty standard, just nothing special. Worth trying if you can find it..."
"This is the third Smokestack Series beer I've tried and each has impressed me more than the last. Everything about it mimicked the great examples of the style. Their Long Strange Tripel, along with their Saison, are styles they've understood and the result has been ideal beer."
"Appearance is a very murky yellow-orange despite being careful to store upright and pouring slowly. A vigorous white head nearly clears the lip of my tulip glass but then settles into about a centimeter of foam for the duration. Aroma has some nice esters of lemon and orange along with the familiar spicy Belgian yeast characteristics. Unfortunately, there are also some distinct fusel alcohol aromas akin to nail polish remover lingering around. Flavors of the same lemon and orange along with a nice balance of sweet malt are quite nice but alas the fusel alcohol overcomes the finish and causes me to curl my nose as I swallow. Moderate hop bitterness and the effervescent carbonation may also contribute to the dominance of the fusels as well. This beer had some great potential but the fusels need to be removed."
"Another solid Smokestack series brew and a good sippin' Tripel thats crafted solidly by Boulevard."
"Exploding cork. A mild gusher. An alive beer. Yellow color with a full foam. . Light aromas, polish-like, with herbs and light fruits. Flavor has nice balance and a nice malt and yeast complexity. A lot of fruit character (peach, pear, nectarine) with the notion of spices from the yeast. I really think it's a beer of high quality."
"Tastes wet sweet to start with strong flat phenolic. Not clovey and not quite smokey. Yellow cake and esters of orange, rather than my lemony expectation. Grassiness from yeast mixes with the phenolic in an unpleasant way. I know some people dig that flavor, but it makes me cringe. Bleech. Dry finish leaves lingering phenol. Light body, but finish isn't quite as crisp as I'd expect in a Tripel."
"Outstanding beer, an excellent tripel. The Smokestack series is one of the best things American brewers have concocted and released in the last year. All I've tried have been terrific, and this ranks among my favorite tripels. Highly recommended."
"Try this with an apricot stilton and you will not be dissapointed."
"Cloudy, murky copper. Bigass thick crop of pure snow white head. It sticks around for fucking ever. Lace is quite full. Aroma has warm biscuity malt feeling to it with some fruitiness and spiciness as well. Also some cake batter sweetness. And yeasty esters. I guess this smells pretty damn good. As it turns out, it tastes pretty damn good too. The cake doughiness transfers to the palate nicely, and that's a quality I love in tripels. Sweet yellow batter. Just a hint of alcohol spiciness. A little cracked black pepper. Some light peachy fruitiness. Nice even flowing mouthfeel. Carbonated to perfection. Light-medium bodied. Very nice beer. Overall, the Smokestack series was pretty impressive (except for the Double Wide). Glad I dropped the coin on them (except for the Double Wide)."
"D - drinks incredibly easy but a bit lighter taste than I would've preferred for a tripel."
"Excellent! I wasn't impressed by any of the standard Boulevard lineup, but this is the second wonderful 750 I've had from them."
"Jimi is an awesome trader.. Cheers."
"This Smokestack Series beer is one of the nicest surprises of the past several months. I'm floored by the fact that a brewery in Kansas City, MO is capable of brewing a Belgian-style tripel that could hold its head high in the best beer bars in Brussels. Simply put, Boulevard Long Strange Tripel is a home run."
"Grabbed a nice haul of new goods from Boulevard for the holiday weekend. Nice to see them step it up a notch and branch out into the bigger beers. Love the psychedelic label as well. Let's get to this. Pours a hazy golden orange with a huge 2 and a half finger beautiful off-white head. Head settles down in an unhurried fashion leaving little to no lacing behind while the active carbonation keeps things interesting for a while. Smell is complex but not as robust as some of the other tripels I've tried, but has quite a bit going on with sugar, malts, bananas, oranges, some yeast, some sweet bread and a hint of spice going on. Tastes creamy up front with the alcohol heat, the next thing I noticed, not as blended as I prefer in my tripels. That being said, it still tastes darn good with some hops thrown in actually putting an edge on the malt goodness, along with creamy banana and spice. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium-bodied and creamy. All and all a great tripel that will definitely be revisited in the future. Kudos for Boulevard for branching out and kicking butt on this one."
"Well worth the money. Don't pass this one up."
"Overall, this is a great example of what an American made Tripel can be."
"Greeted with a loud pop upon prying out the cork. Pours a nice clear copper/orange. A torrid of carbonation in the glass. Huge frothy head. Smells yeasty, rich sweet malts of light candied fruits. Subtle but noticable low AA hops on the tongue, vibrant and alive. Yeasty booziness strikes next. The candied fruits follow up with a grainy aftertaste mingling with the fruits. Light mouthfeel."
"750 ml bottle: Batch T7341: This one pours a hazy, golden color. There was quite a bit of a white head on it, and it had an audible fizz. Leaves almost no lacing. Nice aroma, if a touch light for a tripel. Notes of peppery spices, yeast and a bit of breadiness. The taste is also a touch light for a tripel. A bit bready, citrus, banana, spicy notes. Nice."
"Drinkability: Very smooth finish - quite drinkable."
"M - Bubbly feel that has a slightly bitter aftertaste."
"Drinks fairly easy, but the boozeyness does slow you down a bit. A solid tripel, hits most of the right notes, but just doesn't really reach me"
"D - This is a nice version of a tripel. It's the first Smokestack beer that I've tried and it is quite good."
"Drinkability: The Long Strangly Sweet Tripel was just a hair too sweet for me."
"Atlanta Ale meeting. Good head on a Belgian light colour. Thick mouthfeel and lots of malt. Quite yeasty. Smooth taste, yeasty aroma and yeast in taste. On the sweet side, but not too sweet. Spices like corriander. Well suitably carbonated. Not a bad one."
"This is a pretty tasty tripel. Very solid effort here from this brewery, and although this is my first experience with Boulevard I hope it's not my last."
"The only thing I wanted to say about this beer is that trying a fresh tripel as opposed to one aged, usually due to shipping time, is that it shines a new light on this style for me. The brewer is belgian and I thought this beer was very true to style but the freshness was what makes me love it. I keep trying to keep one and age it but can't seem to stop myself from drinking it. Great beer."
"A big dissapointment. But 3 out of the 4 offerings were decent. They just whiffed on this one."
"Mouthfeel is lighter in body, but slightly sticky. The alcohol is hidden well, but sneaks up on you by the end of the bottle. Very enjoyable indeed!"
"Notes: I've liked all the new Boulevards that came out recently, but I know I'm biased to my local brewery."
"A very pleasant, easy to drink beer. Not an in-your-face kind of Belgian but it has a nice relaxed Belgian character. Much rounder, fuller and softer than other trippels I've had. Nicely restrained phenolic esters, earthy spice and alcohol presence give way to a silky maltiness with a supple bready biscuity malt finish supported by a lingering, fading bitterness. Great balance and complexity."
"Smokestack Series is shaping up to be pretty damn good."
"D - Very high for the ABV. A little on the sweet side for some maybe."
"Spicy aroma with plenty of cloves. Medium body. Lots of spicy flavors from the yeast. Alcohol is not very apparent. Some fruity flavors. Fairly dry. Very easy drinking. Nice beer."
