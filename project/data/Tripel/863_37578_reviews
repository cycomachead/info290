"O- a different take on a tripel, it’s got the classic triple flavors, but enhanced by oak and los of fruity notes"

"O: A fantastic beer that I've been sitting on for far too long. The alcohol is well hidden with just a hint of a warming sensation."
"Had a bottle at toronado, san diego. Not cheap. Every year Russian River does damnation aged and I figured I would try it out. The bottle says aged with oak chips. Definitely note of something a bit woody with a stronger mouthfeel than regular damnation. Goes down smooth with a bite at the beginning. Taste is similar to damnation with a distinct twist. The appearance is a perfect amber color with a little lace around the glass. It smells a good bit like hay. While I would prefer almost all of Russian Rivers beers over damnation, I do enjoy this beer. Was it worth the 20 dollars I spent on the bottle? Hell no. The idea of drinking a limited beer is nice but I would take most of their other brews over this one. Still very good as are all of their brews. This weekend I take on pliny the younger!"
"Overall - An odd beer. A smell I can't quite place. The flavor is complex, but not really a tripel. Points for being interesting."

"Overall this session was amazing. I'll admit I was a little concerned with the amount of time this sat in the cellar and how it would age. Those concerns were unnecessary. This is an amazing brew and Vinnie knows exactly what he is/was doing. The oak chips brought out something special in this beer (not a huge fan of the Damnation) and it is not to be missed. Pricey? Maybe. Worth it? Absolutely."

"O: Interesting tripel. Very unusual. Not much oakiness to this one. It's quite sweet and has an odd funkiness to it that I don't usually get. Lots of sweetbread and yeast at least. Didn't quite hit me right but it's not horrible - just not as good as I was expecting. Not a big fan, and tripels are usually my favorite belgians."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Didn't really pick up on the oak as much as I would have expected, but a fantastic beer. A really great drink to sip on during the colder weather. I liked this one much better than the regular Damnation."

"The beer pours a clear amber color with just a layer of off white head. I'm getting lots of Belgian yeast spice in the nose along with a sweetness. The taste is a bit more interesting. I'm still getting the Belgian spice along with a malt sweetness, but there is also an oaky note and a fruity note. I would say this is a well balanced beer. The head sticks around all the way through the pour."
""
""
""

"O: This is like a slightly stronger, slightly drier and more tart variation on regular Damnation. Pretty good."

"Taste is outstanding full bodied as the aroma, with all of those elements, zesty but slightly oily, lightly spicy, faintly sweet, tingly and engaging."
""
"O: Overall I thought the beer looked and smelled really good, but it was not quite as dry as I enjoy Tripels. The spicing seemed to be done very nicely, but I don't know how much oak aging this beer has actually made an influence on it. I could not know this...it could have a profound impact, but there really isn't much ""oak"" to it. I didn't get any alcohol burn although the flavors did come through a bit...most likely the aging has taken care of it. It's a good Tripel to try, but I wouldn't go out of the way to get it again."
""
""
""
""
"D - this is a good take on the regular version. I didn't realize this was a triple and not a blonde ale, but given the change up in styles I still really enjoyed this one. Another winner from RR!"
"Aged my other bottle 15 months. Not much has changed, still strongly carbonated. The major difference is the alcohol burn has mellowed significantly. Odd bubblegum/banana note still there and I like it. Bump it up another tenth of a point or so. It's just great."
"I can't pick up on much taste, the alcohol just destroyed me. Really a burn in the throat as I drink it. The oak is bright enough to make me wonder if it is a virgin barrel. I just can't endorse this one, its primary and final impression it left on me was ""damn, that tastes like I'm drinking gin/vodka."""
""
"o - overall the oak is an improvement on an already great beer. very happy with batch 23. love me a good tripel and this is a great take on the style."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy bright golden color ale with a super huge foamy had with excellent retention and some very good lacing. Aroma which consists of citrus and floral hops are well balanced against the sweet notes of the malt bill. Taste is a great mix between some citrus and floral hoppy notes and some semi—sweet malt notes. Oak is very subtle but seems to bring a rounder taste at the end. Yeast strain a somewhat fruity and can be detected. Body is full with great conditioning and some excellent carbonation with no apparent alcohol. This is a great improvement IMO over the regular version which is just too fruity."

"M: Medium"
"This brew blends the components well and is one of the more complex triples I have had the pleasure to enjoy."
""
"This is an excellent tripel, though this particular batch is really striking me as a bit too hot. Maybe it needs some time to mellow out. That issue aside, this is still pretty good. Through the burn I am getting nice character and a good profile. Even though this might need to mellow a bit, it's still nice."
"375ml bottle of batch 69 that I shared with a friend. Golden yellow color, decent head. Smells estery and a whole lot like Damnation to me. The flavor was a bit of pear, belgian yeast, maybe I haven't had Damnation in a while but this tastes a whole lot like what I remember. I did not taste any oak whatsoever. I will say that the alcohol was imperceptible which is pretty amazing given it was listed at like 10.8% or something. Nice beer but nothing to go crazy for."
""
""
""
"O- Very tasty and eerily drinkable for the style and alcohol content. The quality is tip notch. Highly recommended."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Excellent Tripel with great balance. The oak is a really nice touch that adds some great complexity as well."
""
"O: 'Regular' Damnation is quite possibly my wife's favorite beer and is quite delicious in my book, too - so an oak-aged/stronger version of it? Hell, yes! This did not disappoint at all - so flavorful and mellow, with barrel-aging complementing wonderfully. At 12.7 oz split two ways, it disappeared far too quickly. Would love to have this again - it was a great night cap to an excellent birthday."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a slightly hazy amber with no head or lacing. The nose is an incredible orange rind bitter-sweetness with pungent alcohol. The taste is light and sweet with a subtle touch of oak. The aftertaste is a honey sweetness followed by some wood, but it's hard to recognize. The aftertaste is just as light and refreshing. Honestly, this beer was way better than expected with big citrus notes from the tripel followed by an interesting wood infusion. Very drinkable beer, possibly the best BA tripel I've had... although I still have my bottle of Allagash to try next."
"Overall this is a well crafted brew. I am not much of a funk fan but this is done very well. I marked the taste and overall score down as the coriander and lemon zest is a bit too dominating in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste wise though, is where this beer starts to excel, It asserts itself on the pallet nicely. Very fruity, apply/ tart like notes."
""
""
""

"4.5 D: Definitely a solid tripel. Not the most complex, but great flavors that come together well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very different. If you like this type of different, you'll enjoy it."
"O - Good beer, has a sharp flavor with some added oak accents that bump it up. Well done, and refreshing for a slightly warm night. Will be interested to see how this ages, thanks for the extra bottle Kurtis!"
"Complex and flavorful Tripel, brings a ton of different angles. The only thing I don't really notice is the oak, but the beer itself seems better than the damnation I had somehow."
""
"Pretty awesome, a whole different beast from the regular Damnation."
""
"A delightful beer with lots of flavour, a nice rounded body and lots of citrus. The oak seems to be missing but I still like it."
"Bartender poured into this into a tall tulip glass, revealing a slightly hazy golden hue. A finger-width's worth of creamy foam capped it off. The nose is sharp with Belgian yeast, lemon zest, faint tangerine. The mouthfeel was much smoother than anticipated, aided by the oak chips, no doubt. Light bubbly finish. Light hoppy flavors meld well with the yeast character, and then finishes with a mildly-tart citrus snap. Spicy lemons come to mind with this beer. I liked it quite a bit. RR has made another standout brew here. Glad I had the opportunity."
"O - Good beer. Oak is right on target, finish is smooth. It is overcarbonated as hell, but the flavor is just great. Without a massive head, the beer looks great. Great overall and I would happily drink this again."
"Overall - loved it. The complexity and balanced between Belgium yeast, hops, tartness, and richness was splendid."
""
"Overall, I thought this was exactly how I anticipated a Russian River Tripel to taste like. Very nice and complex. I highly recommend."
""
""
"Overall, I loved this one. Gonna grab a few more bottles too, see how it holds up with a little age. This, to me, is the ideal tripel."
""
""
""
""
"DOA"
"O- A pretty good tripel, lots of complex flavors, drinkability is very high (I'm actually surprised at the alcohol content), Russian River never disappoints."
""
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, especially considering the ABV. If you've tried the regular Damnation or you're looking for a good American-made tripel, this is a good option."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best tripels I have ever had, although it could use more funk. If you like this one; seek out a similar one by A La Fut out of Quebec called Tripe à 3 Brett."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew that is very carbonated. It has a solid warming factor about it and a nice arrangement of flavor initially that sort of falls apart as it warms up and more sips are taken. I think the oak and hoppy bitterness clashes with the yeasty spices and it overall distracts from the experience instead of complimenting it. It lingers inside the mouth with almost an oily feel that mixes with a bit of astringency. It isn't a horrible brew by any stretch, it just isn't quite for me and what I expect from a tripel."
""
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I shared the bottle with my family and we enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For an 11% offering, this one hides its boozy side very very well. Otherwise, a very solid tripel though the barrel-aging barely shows up in the flavor profile."
""
""
"My bottle at Stone Brewing Bistro and Gardens. Yeasty aroma mostly. Starts sweet and then finishes bitter. Funkier as it warms. Hits the style and also funkier than the style. Would be much better with food. 375 ml is sufficient without it. Enormous head."
""
"O- I like this beer this beer a lot. I want to age a few bottles but they don't last. Long in my cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 3 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random dots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of Belgian yeast, spices, grain, and some light fruity aromas. Taste is pretty much exactly the same with a slight woody flavor on the finish. There is a slight astringent bitterness and a bit of alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a very crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good tripel and another great beer from Russian River. I am very happy I was able to find one of these."
""
""
"O: This was really a great beer. Definitely one of the best tripels I have enjoyed to date. It hides the high alcohol dangerously well, it has a great complex taste, and is well put together overall."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being high. Overall it was a very good beer of the style. The oak seemed a little more subtle, but did provide a little more depth to it. It had a nice range of flavors to it and was a very good tasting beer overall."
"Another damn fine beer from RR. What else needs to be said?"
""
"This beer pours a hazy star color with a huge fluffy white head. It's like there is a cloud on top of my beer. The smell is lightly spicey with hints of bready malts, I also get hints of the oak. The taste is pretty similar to the smell with a little bit of a bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium body and fairly dry with high carbonation. Overall this is a really good beer and I am glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Another winner from RR. The nose was a little subdued for me, but that is my only substantial critique. Delicious. RR's mastery of both American and Belgian styles of beer is truly amazing. The addition of oak added a subtle, yet significant, layer of complexity to this brew that elevated it to the next level for me. And to boot, it is dangerously drinkable for 11%."
""
""
""
""
"Russian River is my favorite brewery, so I HAD to have this. I will say, its not something I need to seek out again, but I'm super happy to have tried it. Its certainly not bad by any means, just not smoething I need more of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a good beer, but I don't think it was an improvement on the base beer. It's very similar and there is not much oak at all. I think the normal Damnation looks a little better so this rated slightly below it (4 vs. 4.03), but both are good beers. Interested to see what happens to it with some time on it as the alcohol was there in the taste."
"This is an OK beer at best and to be honest, at the price Russian River asks for it, Damnation 23 is flat-out unacceptable. I really have to wonder what the grades would be for this beer if it didn't say Russian River on the label."
"Overall pretty nice, light and refreshing. Not that complex but drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Should have compared this side by side with the regular Damnation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with some soft carbonation up frot along with a champagne like efervesence that gives off hints of bready yeast and light fruit esters. Lots of sweet apple and pear along with slight booze and spice but this is nicely mellowed out by the oak presence. Not overly dry or toasted with hints of coconut and vanilla that nicely masks the high ABV. Some virgin oak beers taste like charred tooth picks but here it is nicely integrated into the flavor of the base beer. Complex, flavorful and dangerously drinkable."
""
"Overall: A tripel takes a lot of finesse, and this one has a fair amount. In the end, its just a little too one sided with all the spicy, yeasty, mustiness."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer, really surprised me, I was not expecting the fruity refreshing light characteristics that came out, the abv is really hidden for being 11%."
"D: Eh.... I hate to say Vinnie makes a bad beer, but if he does, this is probably it. I won't pay $12 for this again."
""
""
""
"D/O: In general, the wild ales of Russian River are a glorious expression of imperfection, possibly some of the most extreme, challenging, and coveted American-brewed beers. This wood-aged batch of Damnation is most of those things, yet it is less challenging and seems to be nearer to perfection. Appearing as much like an imperial Sanctification as a wild version of Damnation, it lacks the palate-scorching sourness which has come to define that other beer in recent times. It is beguiling and drinkable, not suggestive of the high (10+ percent) abv, thanks in large part to the rewarding textures it is imparted with."
"Damnation Batch 23 (69) pours what vacillates between a hazy goldenrod and lemon yellow, depending on the degree of backlighting. The creamy white froth that forms at the top of the glass reaches just short of three fingers in height. Head retention is very good, but lacing is nonexistent (as surprising as it is disappointing). The first whiff is all juicy pale fruits, gobs of granny smith apples and pears. In time a rounded oak-y aroma melds nicely with some light phenolic notes to play against the fruitiness. It would be nice if they were a bit more apparent though. The flavor is a little less one dimensional, as while the fruits still take center stage, everything else jumps out a bit more. Specifically, there's a bit of hoppy bitterness, as well as a slightly more pronounced clove and pepper yeast presence. Woody influence from the oak is a bit more subdued here than in the nose, and there's a light warming sensation from the alcohol. For some reason, my immediate reaction on the first sip was that the beer is overcarbonated, but that's definitely not the case. What is the case is that the body is absurdly light and dry for an 11% beer. The carbonation is creamy and lively, just about spot on. Batch 23 is a bigger, badder version of regular Damnation (a fantastic brew in its own right), and one I'll have to look into getting some more of. Another fantastic beer from Russian River."
""
"This, in my opinion is an improvement on normal Damnation. Not amazing, but tasty."
""
"The beer pours cloudy gold with an orangy hue and certainly has a persistant head of whipped white. Beyond that, the beer is overall much fresher and spicy. Perhaps some vanilla this time around and less oaky. The extent of the oak is in the tannic aftertaste which would be easier noted if it were not there. Certainly picking up lots of apples and shades of banana and booze. Spicy and dryish. A bit ""bigger"" all around from the previous batch."
"This beer pours a medium bodied honey gold in color with a billowing three finger, soapy white head. It took about five minutes for the head to recede. The aroma consists of some spicy Belgian yeasts, orange peels, coriander, fruity esters, and a slight floral componenet (can't pinpoint the flower). It's nice and aromatic. The flavors are smooth and yeasty. I pick up plenty of fruit esters, slight bubblegum, spicy yeasts, more yeast and slight banana. There is also some slight butter, most likely from the oak aging. Since they don't say, I'm curious as to which oak they used. Local, French, etc.? Regardless, it's solid. It drinks very well for being 11% and the alcohol isn't noticeable at all. This is a nice tripel and pretty drinkable. I'd like to have this again but for me the standard is still La Fin du Monde."
""
"Pours darker than regular Damnation; cloudy golden orange with a fluffy off white head with average retention and lacing. Sweet aroma of oak, honey, bready malt and fruit like mango, melon and citrus. Much less yeast and spice than regular Damnation and much more fruit and sweetness. Slightly fuller body with high carbonation and a dry finish with mild tart notes. A little more enjoyable fresh than the bottle of Batch 46 we tried a few months ago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful orange color with a three finger soapy white head. Good lacing, and great carbonation coming up from the bottom of my snifter glass. The nose is a little funk, grass, wood, slight alcohol and clove. Not super balanced, but I get plenty of aroma. Very sweet and smooth as well. Ah... interesting taste. I get wood, a tiny bit of funk, tangerine, grass, and spices in the background. Excellent taste. The feel, for me, is the weak point in this beer. It's medium bodied, w/ good carbonation and a strong, smooth malt backbone. However, there's a real biting acidity that takes over and destroys everything else feel-wise. If it was a little more in balance, it would be a higher score. Overall, this is a really outstanding beer. I would definitely have this again. Cheers."
""
""
""
"23 is better than the usual Damnation, but not by much. I hardly get any oak."
"O: nice balance, ABV is well integrated"
""
"Overall, a really solid beer. Very glad to have this, as I missed batches 23 and 46."
""
"Golden, full bodied, aftertaste that only gets better, the damnation batch 23 is a tribute to the name and embodies the perfection of Russian River at its best. Not much more to say about this beer other than Grade: A and you have to try it. If you find this beer buy it."
""
"O: A really great beer although one would probably be my limit. Too bad it doesn't make it out here"
"O: A pretty good beer. Nice fruit flavors and the oak brings a nice component as well. Not something I would go to all the time, but would certainly drink it again."
""
"D - Very tasty. Surprised I have not had this one before."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. Russian River is special to me, having lived in Santa Rosa for a few years when it was still under the radar, but this is probably my emotional favorite. It's delightfully balanced, complex, and oaky as all hell. Not to mention a bit of funk even with no claimed Brett presence. If you ever see one fresh, go for it. You won't regret it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Damnation 23 is a very good beer. I liked Damnation, I love Damnation 23. I love the bigger more intense flavor but I love the balance that is maintained more. The oak aging does wonders for the beer, really adds depth the moves this beer into a higher tier. The alcohol is very well masked making for an exceptionally drinkable beer. Pick up a bottle if you run into one, well worth your while."
""
"O: Good and easily drinkable, though I've got to admit this one was quite a bit more subdued than I was expecting it to be."
""
"Batch 69. I didn't even know they aged any of this on oak, let alone on regular intervals, until tonight. Right on. This stuff pours a clear pale gold topped by plenty o' cream-white foam. The nose comprises orange peel, bleached wheat, light soap, light balsa, and light banana peel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light orange zest and some light Brett-like funk. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very nice bit o' brew, though I feel like the oak was far too subdued for everything's own good (yeah, I admit I was looking for some crispy oak notes in there...). Good times, nonetheless."
""
"Batch 69. Pours a very hazy, golden-orange color with a large, frothy white head that has a slight orangish hue to it. Scent is immediately funky with definite barnyard aromas and some tangy, tart fruit scents. A bit of tangerine mixed with cinnamon spice and Belgian yeast. Spicy and fruity with just a bit of hoppiness. Taste is initially bready, buttery yeast flavors with citrus. Funky yeast flavors with some clove and orange flavors. The oak comes through in the flavor more than in the aroma. A bit of alcohol as it warms. Pepper and just a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is very creamy and full bodied. Drinkability is high, especially for such a big beer. Overall, I enjoy this a lot more than regular Damnation. Yet another solid offering from RR."
""
""
"Overall – Actually am enjoying this. Normally tripel’s are not my beer of choice but this one, with the classic RR twist on it is quite good. Glad I have a couple to cellar."
""
"paid 10.99 for the bottle. wish it wasnt the last one"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious beer for sure. Balanced and filling."
"Head. TrOpical fruit nose, a little bread, some Belgian notes. Flavor of roasted pineapple and white bread with a faint hop bitter that pairs with a hint of oak tannin and vanilla. Nice drinking, a little high on the carbonation. Really good, much more than the regular Damnation."

"Boy O Boy! Onto something here, mmm HM!! I let this warm up some out of the fridge to about perfect temp. Poured with a colossal, foamy, frothy, fluffy, sudsy, off-white head that soon settles down to some scud and some lace. Color is a clear amber with bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, hop, malt, oak, caramel, spice, bread dough and makes me want to quit screwing around and DRINK IT!!! Flavor doesn't let me down a bit - very similar to nose, but all have more impact, vineous, and flat out tasty. Very true to style. Body and carbonation is similarly true to style. Finish is like flavor and trends more towards vineous and has the slap happy boozieness. Wot a beer. Yessir."
""
"Mouthfeel is nice and to style. Russian River is a Master of hops and yeast, but the malt character of this particular beer just wasn't wowing me. The oak also brought very little to the party. Though I have to say I didn't sense the 11% abv in this beer at all. Props."
""
"Overall: A solid, oak-aged tripel. Yes, that's what we call it."
""
""
"Overall: A very good Tripel. This is a better version of the original."
""
""
""
""
"O - I have been trying to track this one down for quite a while, and luckily there is not an ounce of disappointment to be found here. Hard to remember 'em all, but this might be my favorite tripel to date. Standard issue Damnation is good, but this takes it to another level. Gonna have to seek out a couple more of these while they are still relatively available."
""

"Truly enjoyed this brew; props to Vinnie & crew for creating another great beer."
"This one pours a golden light orange with a solid white sticky head. Smells of lemon pepper, sweet fruits, orange and banana. The taste is similar with a tartness of citrus, tangarine, oak, and alcohol. It's medium to light bodied, well carbonated and not much heat from the amount of alcohol. To be honest I was I little dissapointed with this beer I think I had my hopes set a little too high its still a very good beer."

"O – This is great, much better than the standard Damnation, would love to find more of this rare little gem. One of if not the best Triples I have had. And does not drink like an 11% beer."
"O: I've not much experience with Belgian style beers, tripels, but I feel that this review will stand: an amazing beer!"
"Hops are really fragrant but it's not a bitter beer. Hugely drinkable for a strong beer. Nice lacing and carbonation as well. On tap at Pizza Port in Ocean Beach."
"O Very enjoyable, worth the purchase and I would probably get it again for friend to try."
"Overall, a great representation of the style. Kudos again, RR."
"O: Verrry nice, but how can you go wrong with this style from RR? Really good, maybe even great, but not mind-blowing."
"Dr: Very drinkable. Expensive, but quality. I'd have it again. It was a real treat to enjoy it on draught."
"I've never had regular Damnation, but this is a great take on a tripel. Very robust in flavor. I rarely enjoy beers above 10 percent ABV because I don't like the boozy flavor, but it's not present here."
"The way this beer hides it's alcohol content is pretty insane, I sense black magic here from Vinnie. I always enjoy the every 23rd batch of Damnation, certainly more than the original Damnation. Still, Russian River makes other beers similar to this one that I feel are more focused in their approach and are considerably better, despite this, it's still a very good beer."
"Verdict: This is a really great beer. I like the Damnation as it is, but it’s not really one to blow me away. This batch with the oak flavors brings out some added complexity and really takes this beer to another level. I’ve had it now in a bottle and on draft and both are exemplary."
"decent, lacks some complexity though."
"cheers"
"Overall, its not that great. I liked damnation better and I don't need to seek that one out again either."
"How appropriate that Damnation 23 is my 666th review!"
"Overall: A very drinkable transitional sour. Very complex flavors/aromas, well carbonated. I'm excited to see how this one ages."
"Very close to if not full bodied with a delicate level of carbonation, the mouthfeel is outstanding! With all the pluses I'm getting from it, the alcohol is almost barely noticeable. I'm digging Batch 23 big time!"
"O: This beer is really good, but I have to admit I know very little next to nothing about tripels stylistically. The yeast wasn't exactly estery, but the breadiness of malt married suggestions of light citrus to perfection. The mouth had this spritzy effervescence that makes me think this is something to consume fresh. There's a great deal to appreciate in this beer, and I can see a lot of non-beer drinkers picking this out as a favorite in a tasting. Definitely give batch 23 a swirl sometime, I think it's Russian River doing what they do best. Scary drinkable for the alcohol."
"I'd be interested to see how this develops with age. Cheers!"
"This is a great beer, and it hides the 11% ABV amazingly."
"Poured from bottle into duvel tulip. Easy pour yielded a sizable head, about 2.5 fingers thick. Not very stable, it settled quickly. Soft white with residual bubbles. Nose is complex. Yeasty esters take front, white pepper, sesame, evergreen trees and wood. Taste is noticeably deviant, pretty dry, yeasty, a lot more wood, as it warms its even a very very small bit tart in the back. Not my particular style preferred, but it is strangely alluring. I enjoyed it much. Lots of carbonation on this one early on, but mellows out nicely. No lacing to be found. Nice treat, glad I came across it (without having to go to the brewery at that)."
"O: great great beer. On par with Bruery Premiere for me"
"O- very well excited beer, very true to the style. Nice treat from RR."
"Didn't really get too much oak, but lots of spice, and a great yeast presence."
"O - Nice and funky, but light and refreshing."
"O: This beer has pretty much blown me away. A fantastic beer which has great age potential. I'm thinking 3-6 years."
"Wonderfully smooth, with any rough edges sanded down and given a light polish. Bright and lively, with sharp carbonation and a moderately fruity character that avoids straying into an excessively yeasty realm. ETOH is well integrated into the flavor, lending a bit of black pepper bite toward the end. A top-notch example of the style that can go toe-to-toe with anythign from Belgium."
"O-Like the regular Damnation a fine brew. The wood flavors creep in ever so slightly and once again there is a solid hop backbone in the finish."
"O: A nice beer to try, I like it better than regular Damnation. Nothing to get to excited about though, overpriced, but not a bad effort in an of itself."
"O: A really nice Tripel. The oak is not overdone and adds nice balance. I enjoyed this more on tap than in the bottle. Certainly would enjoy more of this if I could get my hands on it."
"jd"
"Interesting beer. I was incredibly excited until I tasted it. The taste is alright, but not great."
"Shrug. A very well crafted beer, no doubt, but I guess my expectations were a bit unreasonably raised, given my experience with the bottle version a few years back."
"Honestly this batch wasn't all that tasty, but regardless of personal preference it's well put together. Had a batch 23 750mL of this years ago (thx Dave) and it wasn't really the same. This was much more estery and wine forward. edit: Sampled on tap next day at the brewpub also. Seemed a bit less yeasty and a touch more drinkable, but still had the same dominant white wine flavor."
"This is a tripel that is light in body yet complex in flavor. I wish Vinnie made this regularly, instead of making us wait through 23 batches of regular Damnation."
"The regular edition of Damnation is one of my favorite beers and no surprise, I absolutely love this spin on the recipe."
"This has held amazingly. Ultra smooth and integrated. No alcohol flavor. The fruit has really blossomed. Drink 'em if you got 'em!"
"O-This is great stuff."
"Not as bold as their other sours, but a great take on an already pretty good beer. Very tasty. I'm interested to see how it ages."
"O: Well Done Vinne! This beer lived up to my expectations even though I've been waiting for a few years to try it. Carbonation, Malt, Alcohol, and flavor all balanced very well!"
"Drink- Well Greg I can't say thanks to you enough. Never thought I would see a bottle of this and you pull out likes it nothing. Till 46 comes along I wait with bated breath."
"A far sweeter, slightly more woody, version than the original Damnation. A different beer entirely, in my mind. I prefer the original Damnation."
"O- looking at the reviews, this beer is just over 4 years old. time has been very kind to it. id love to try a fresh bottle from the next batch and compare. i also wouldnt mind picking up another one from this batch. check this one out if you can. be warned though, the alcohol will sneak up on you."
"Overall: A very nice beer. I've had this many times but am happy to finally review it."
"drinkability: a rare treat, Thanks Eddie!"
"O - I wish this brew had more of a dry pale base, because the caramel notes are detrimental for me, to an otherwise fantastic beer."
"Pours a slightly-cloudy golden color with a large off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. The nose brings forward a bit of bready malt and then carries through with some oak. Beyond that, there's a good amount of yeast coming through with nice notes of banana, bubble gum, and some clove. Medium body. Light dryness from the oak. Light booze in the finish as well. Really nice beer that I was thrilled to finally try. Thanks again, Eric."
"I should look up to see if RR calls this a tripel or if this is some BA nerd that added this as a tripel. In my opinion it is too sweet and not dry enough to be a tripel. This is probably better called a strong pale or something in that family but I digress. Beer is medium to light in body, moderately carbonated on the palate. The beer leads off with this sweetness and the mid palate of the beer is quite fruity, like apples or white grapes. Some nice oak overall, a great beer. I really enjoyed it, not quite my favorite tripel or strong pale and not my favorite Russian river Belgian ale but this was really good and I'd have it again."
"Thanks, madtowndmb1, for the opportunity"
"Low carbonation but adequate to the task, a soft or creamy mouthfeel, excellent. I liked this SO much better than I expected. I'm gonna save the other bottle for another 8 months or so, and see if the oak diminishes a little (even though it's delicious now)."
"Pours a nice crisp yellowish orange with a nice amount of head. Smells oaky and yeasty. Lots of floral aromas and yeast but the oak is most present. Tastes oaky. Oak oak and more oak. Very nice yeasty profile. Nice light fruity flavours. Incredibly drinkable and very smooth. So so much better than damnation."
"O-very good. Wish I could get more"
"Poured from bottle into snifter glass. Pours a hazy effervescent golden with a dense white head that retains throughout. Dry, fruity aroma with a mild vanilla oak presence. Some chalky Belgian dry phenols, dry doughy yeast, orange, sweet oak, and prunes. Complex aroma. Fluffy light body with a softly sweet flavor. The Belgian malts dry out leading to chalky phenols. Some sweet ciruses are present as well with mild vanilla from the oak. All the sweet notes are very soft and subtle with some peppery vegetal notes on the back. Dries out nicely. A nice U.S. version of a Belgian Tripel. Glad to had the Batch 23 and traded my last one for a bunch of 3f beers. Good times."
"Drinkability is gorgeous - I really think this is perhaps the most drinkable 11% beer i've had thus far, the style comes through, and it maintains all the spice and dryness a triple should have."
"Don't hesitate if you see this on tap. It's a MUST HAVE. Home Run. Never experienced an American brewer nail a Belgian style like this before. Well Done."
"Medium bodied, silky, with medium levels of carbonation. Fairly easy to drink, but the oak is too overbearing for me."
"Massive thanks to womencantsail for this tick in my quest to try all of the RR -tion brews! Batch #046! Served from bottle into a Firestone Walker sampler shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, oak, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. It had a very different flavor than what I was thinking it would taste like. The flavors present were very nicely balanced and worked well together. The aroma was very nice as well. Very glad that I got the opportunity to try this. Thanks again Andrew!"
"D: Very different from regular Damnation, and probably for the best. I really enjoyed this beer. Would love to have it again."
"Poured golden orange in color with yellow highlights that had a thin frothy head and left some good lacing sticking to the glass. I did detect the oay character upfront on the nose with citrus, booze, and faint belgian yeast notes. The belgian yeast character and dark fruits were more apparent on the palate with oaky and citrus accents but with slight tart notes. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a citrusy, mild fruity, oaky, and tart finish. I like the regular damnation but batch 23 is pretty intresting and drank good. I'm glad I've got to try it a fews times now."
"Another great show of Vinnie's barreling skills. Love Russian River and they never let me down. Keep them coming!"
"Overall, a pretty solid trippel. Not as oaky as I was expecting, but it didn't sit too long on the chips. It is pretty drinkable for the abv. I like it."
"Bottle. Batch 46, courtesy of mothman. Pours a deeper hazed amber orange color than the regular Damnation. The head is a tiny bubbled small head of an offwhite color. Very good retention and lacing as it settles. The nose is more subdued than the regular version as well but it has notes of citrus, pineapple, pear, and oak. Some booze notes as well. Light/medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. The flavor to me is very strong apricot with mixes of oak. Nice hop notes as well. Ends dryly."
"Very drinkable, though I split a glass with my brother, should have had my own. Top notch, well worth it if you can find it."
"Drinkability: A bit lacking in flavor, although the high ABV is well hidden."
"Quaffable, original, tasty, gorgeous. Wonderful."
"When I was out in Santa Rosa, I went out to Russian River. While I was their, I bought a bottle of the Damnation Batch 23. I took this to a Free the Hops meeting. I watched as everyone a round the room poured a sample and tasted with a happy face. When I tried the beet it was about straw in color, it had a thin head. The smell was fantastic sweet with hints of coriander. The taste was of carmel malt and vanilla. This was a great beer, wish I had bought more then just one bottle."
"Russian River brews the single best beer in the known universe (Pliny The Younger) and plenty of others that are special as well. Damnation Batch 23 is solid, and has aged well, but it isn't the outstanding effort that I was hoping for."
"D - Shared a 750ml bottle and that was a good serving size, although I could have gone for a little more."
"D: This was much better than the standard Damnation. It had lots of rich complexity, but was still very delicate and refined. Fantastic to sip, with the only negative being that it's still a bit hot. Perhaps another year of age to perfect it?"
"Thanks Jeff for the opportunity to try this one and many other RR beers."
"D: very, very drinkable, beware with the alcohol"
"D-this is tasty, lighter, and soft on the palate. fantastic beer and quite easy and pleasant to drink. the oak falls off a little in the taste but was still a great brew!"
"Russian River has not disappointed me yet! (Except their distribution habits!)"
"D- Overall this beer is kinda quirky-but awesome. I love the complexity and the spicy heat that the flavor profile provides. Not really what I was expecting at all as this is completely different from regular damnation-but still great brew by RR."
"The palate opens with a noticeable alcohol bite and prominent, juicy, fruity character with citrus, pears and ripe apricots. Moderate vanilla comes through mid-palate, and coupled with the rather big alcohol character, it makes me think of what a good flavored vodka would taste like. Mild spice character mid-palate with a little clove, a little pepper. Not particularly yeasty. While a little sweet, this beer dries up quite well on the finish. Medium-light in body with a moderate carbonation, the finish is particularly excellent, with a blend of fruit, spice and drying tannins. Vinnie does not disappoint. This is going to fuck me up, but it's going to be a pleasant trip."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is citrus (both lemon and orange) with some oaked character. The flavor is orange, oak, lemon and a nice dose of vanilla. The alcohol is very well hidden and unless you look at the label, you would have no idea this beer was 11 percent. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I love this beer and it's ridiculous that an 11% ABV beer is this drinkable. Sweeter than most tripels but balanced by the oak - a wonderful beer."
"Overall I didn't pick up on any huge differences between this and normal Damnation however the nose in this one was a bit more robust. Worth a shot."
"It poured a cloudy yellow and left a massive lace. It smelled like citrus, earthy, yeasty, some spicy hops mixed in with some banana and clove. It tasted a bit sweet at first with a little grainy with a spicy hop flavor, slightly bubblegum, banana, some light oak notes. The alcohol seemed to be pretty well hidden in this beer."
"Overall, this is a great beer. It retains all the qualities that make a great triple but then ads a great uniqueness with the oak."
"D: This one fits the bill for a tripel and is a very enjoyable drink. It is deceptive in that it is not too heavy. In the end though this one is best enjoyed when aged for an extended period of time"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slight with a good amount of carbonation."
"Thanks to Chris for giving me a chance to try this."
"D- Drinkabillity is good with this beer. There is a sweetness that is a little annoying but you almost get used to it by the end of the beer. Very glad I got to try. Russian River makes amazing beers that I could drink over and over again."
"Drinkability: A cornucopia of flavors and aromas, this one's truly inspiring. At 11.0%, it's not what anyone could really call ""drinkable," though it was definitely a New Years Eve beer if there ever was one - light, crisp, varied, and terribly complex, a perfect harbinger for what is hopefully a light, crisp, varied, and terribly complex 2010. Wait. Something like that at least."
"D-Heck yeah....a more aggressive, spicier and drier version of ""regular"" Damnation. This is a mighty fine brew."
"Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured cloudy yellow color with a large frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Complex woody, citrus, earhty and yeast aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation and thin particles. Medium to heavy citrus balanced flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate duration with a small alcohol bite. This is a refreshing standout beer."
"Overall: This is a good beer. I would expect nothing else from Vinnie."
"Surprisingly sweet at the start, with honey, banana and citrus taking the lead. The finish cuts some of the sweetness with some light hop bitterness, a bit of alcohol and some light oak notes. I wish that the oak were a bit more noticeable and the sweetness gets a bit unruly at the beginning but, overall, this is a very interesting triple. Seems like aging might cause the flavors to blend more seamlessly."
"Drinkability: The abv holds this one back but not the flavor profile!"
"Very glad I had the opportunity to try this one."
"Overall - Very nice, and a quite a bit different then the regular version. I would have no issue at all with having this again and I could see easily why people rave about this as much as they do. Very well put together and really a very nice offering from them. Look forward to trying another."
"Cloudy blonde with good inch worth of head that dissipated to a ring for the rest of the glass. Some floaty particulate, looks like I stirred the sediment with my bad pour. Wheat/Heffe very prominent in the smell, some apple skin, candi sugar and a bit of oak follow. More wheat/heffe in the taste with a healthy dollop of oak, and some woodsy hops. The ABV is very deceptive, not very detectable in the taste. Bright clean finish, not much lingering aftertastes, good. Some mild carbonation, not effervescent as some. I'm glad Larry helped me with this one, it's not good to tackle this one solo. The ABV would sneak up on you and take you down like a skilled ninja."
"Another amazing Russian River beer. I didn't expect this to be such a big departure from the regular Damnation but this knocked me on me heels. I'll keep my eyes open for this one in the future."
"This batch of Damnation pours a gorgeous dark golden. A small head leaves a bit of lace clinging to the glass. Aromas are rich with spice and fruit. Flavors are similar, with dark ripe fruits and spices offered through a huge presence of oak. This is the flavor that really dominates this beer. The body is medium and pleasant on the palate. 23 is pleasant to sip on, and the alcohol hides very well."
"D - A very nice beer with lots of flavor and a great balance. It's been a while since I've had the regular Damnation so I can't really say how this differs but it's a very good beer."
"Taste has a very nice balance between the malt, the sour/tart funkness, fruit and spices (especially coriander), and the oak aging, all of it works together and not one element takes the show, the strength is very well hidden and I found myself easily drinking the entire bottle (although you certainly feel it later)."
"notes and comments- label said beer will age 'til 2013. every 23rd bottling of damnation russian river makes a special batch, a triple aged in oak chips."
"D: The alcohol only began to rear its' head at the end of the glass. Up until then, however, this was a completely charming beer."
"D: Very high APV. I tried this on a clean pallet and the first couple of sips were intense, but after a few more became very drinkable."
"Pours a light, hazy gold in color. A bigger one inch head sits atop the beer. Smell is belgian candy sugar, some yeast and just a hint of oak. You really get more of the oak and just a bit of lemon in the flavor. The oak really smoothes this beer out. Incredibly creamy and velvety smooth in the mouthfeel. This is dangerously drinkable for the ABV. I think the oak aging takes away from my favorite characteristic of the regular Damnation, and that is it's carbonated mouthfeel. This beer was gone before I had a chance to realize it. Extremely drinkable, but be careful, at this ABV, one is more than enough."
"For my own mental notes: Blindfolded, I would guess this is Brooklyn Local One or a diluted Southern Tier's Cuvee Series One (Oak Aged Series). Nice, but I'm not very into this style.."
"Pours a slightly cloudy but still glimmering orange brown (more orange, really) with an extremely well retained white pillowy head. Masterful appearance. Smells of spiced malt, bananas, oak and ethanol. Tangy, sweet mix of Belgian flavors. Yeasty, and some coriander/green hops. Ethanol strong and a little hot on the finish. I get the higher alcohol but the oak contribution is less obvious. Extra body is the real story here, which makes the beer much easier to drink and helps the flavors come together a lot more. Very smooth. This is more of a sipper than its regular incarnation, but that's a-ok with me."
"D- This one just seemed a lot more balanced than regular damnation. The wood characteristics really did it for me. I'm not the biggest belgian fan but found something great in this beer."
"Good representation of the style and one of the best in its class."
"No problem finishing a bottle of this on my own. Pretty sure I could have started in on my next without much problem. Smooth all the way around. Nicely done."
"D: 100% better than regular damnation. The oak aging took an ok beer and made it world class. Only 23 more batches to go now...."
"d: Big thanks to rallisonfor this one. I've never had anything like it. Absolutely fantastic and well worth seeking out."
"Like Tony the Tiger, this beer's Grrreat!"
"Drinkability isn't to bad for such a strong beer. It took me a while to get used to it though. First glass washed down my chili nicely, and the rest was a nice digestife. Still, it's overkill."
"Deep blonde/light amber. Small white head that lasts for a long time. Smells fruity and spicy. Tastes fruity and spicy. Really, IMO this is pretty much what the style is all about."
"D: Much better than regular Damnation. This is a great beer."
"poured cloudy amber with a minnsl white head that disapperas into lacing. Aeona of funk, grass and spice. Taste is similar, with coriander spiciness present throughout, combined with malty sweetness. Oak is present, but not dominant. Thick mouthfeel and medium-low carbonation. Hides it's alcohol exceptionally well."
"D: Belgian ales aren't one of my favorites but this is a well balance, smooth sipper. I would likely never drink more than half a bottle at one time, but that's just me. Good beer. Would drink again, but unsure if I would intentionally seek it out just do to my bias against spicy belgian ales."
"Bottle @ O'Brien's. Poured hazy gold with a thick, foamy white head. Some lacing on the goblet. Lovely sweet French oak barrel, Belgian yeast, cloves, and lots of lighter fruits (apples, grapes, peaches). Effervescent mouthfeel, very light. Compliments the flavor nicely. Sweet peaches and white grapes up front, even sweeter yeast and malt. Nive vanilla/clove spice combo, close to what you may find in a trippel. The oak gives this a flavor far different than the usual Damnation. It is still sweet, but the slight earthiness keeps this from being sickening. Dry finish. Great beer."
"I purchased a bottle of the original Batch 23 once when I was at the brewpub and did not take notes, but remember the beer being quite good and worth the extra cost. This new batch does not disappoint. The bottle says this can be aged for up to four years. I would love to sample this beer as it ages. I would also like to see MJ mentioned on the back of the bottle when mentioning all things 23."
"Picked up a bottle from City Beer in SF. Opened it this week and wow! I tried the standard Damnation but the wood chips of the 23 really make this a unique and great tasting beer. On first sip there a strong and full hop flavor and after a few seconds that hop flavor gets overshadowed by a pleasing oaky flavor. The drinking experience of this beer is very unique and tasted refined. I would buy this beer again and would recommend it to anyone that likes pale ales as well as belgian ales. It strikes a inventive balance between brute force hop taste with the complex depth of some belgians."
"Great beer. Thanks to mom for getting and broski for sending."
"Drinkabilitu is very high because if I had more bottles of this stuff I would hoard them and never share. Can't wait till they make another 23 batches"
"D - Overall good. Will drink again."
"Drinkability is quite good. I was shocked at how easily this went down. What a well put together and complex triple this one is. I think this is a beer that would benefit from some time too. It could smooth out even more, and be super. With that said, it's still an excellent beer."
"Definitely my favorite of the style."
"D - I enjoyed this beer mainly because of the extra dimension the oak chips brought to the overall flavor. Not really my style, but still delicious."
"T&M: Malty sweetness hits the palate first, grainy and fruity. The oak is very well dialed in, not overbearing on the palate but present enough to add some pleasant notes of vanilla, earth and soft tannins. Medium-light in body, crisply carbonated; spot-on. Really dries out in the finish, becoming more peppery and crisp. I really enjoyed this one, it's got a very authentic Belgian tripel character that most American breweries fail to achieve."
"Really tastes like I expected. Color is on the darker side of straw/gold, with a small white head. Taste is light oak, Belgian yeast, fruits, earth. Vinne should brew this more often than once in 23 batches.."
"Tap at O'Briens 15th annv. If I could get this damnation all the time I would. Oak gives that added texture, a little vanilla and superb body and length. Really a stand out beer for me. Vinnie noted it was batch 46, I guess it seeks oak every 23 batches. Would love to see this with 1 or 2 years of age. This was from Keg and outstanding."
"Not sure what it is but I can always tell when I am drinking a Russian River beer. This one happens to be very well-rounded. You don't taste the heat, and it's quite drinkable..."
"D - Not sure if the age has added more oak aroma/flavor but I was a little disappointed in this one."
"Thanks to IrishBoy for sharing this bottle at the RBSG 08 Grand Tasting. Poured into my La Chouffe goblet. Pale gold in color with a white head. The froth reduces to a halo, leaving sticky lace everywhere. Aroma is oak-forward, with banana esters providing sweetness. Flavor is very fruity, mostly banana with accents of tropical and stone fruits. Boozy mid-palate with an earthy oaky finish. Very smooth, classic RR mouthfeel."
"Pours creamy and hazy gold. Smell is bright, fresh malt with a touch of yeast. Taste is sweet slightly lemony, belgian yeastiness and a noticeable oakiness at the end. Pretty tasty stuff and I liked this better than regular Damnation for sure."
"Yellow gold in color with a full head. Unimpressive nose. Flavor seems to have a fairly agressive hop character, with some herbaceous and lemon notes. Also, it's sweet with some fruit-like flavors. The oak provides a fairly nice component, though clearly the oak influence would be more enjoyable, had it been aged in an actual barrel. Lots of heat and definately not a lot of subtlety. The finish could be longer as well, it fades quick. Just seems rough and unrefined, it lacks depth."
"Overall this was a wonderful beer a huge vanilla oak bomb that I loved. The flavors are incredibly rich, which, sadly, hampers its drinkability slightly. But it's not as if I'll be pounding pints of any 11% beer."
"Drinkability- Warming, but deceptive. Oaky, but not over the top with wood. Sticky, but not gluey. I like it."
"Very smooth and just slightly bubbly. Very easy to sip for a long time as it gets better as it warms a bit."
"Very nice."
"Darker than normal Damnation gold with a rightly capped white head of billowing foam, that remains, but dies down and is revived with a swirl of the glass. Excellent lacing and head retention on this wild pup of a beer. Aromas of strong classic golden ale perfection, apple, a bit of spice from the yeast esthers, sweet biscuity malts, and slightly dead vegetal hops in the back. This version also has a big hot boozy oak note that dominates the front aroma quadrant. Taste si big with the oak and alcohol head, a bit hot at this point but will be oh, so, smooth in about 14 month time. Oak chips, mix with spicy yeast/hop notes with a metallic twinge of biscuit malt in the back palatte. Mouthfeel is smooth, but this is hot which hurts it's drinkability a bit. Still damn good. Was not rar at all when released but now impossible to find, which sucks. Should of picked up that case for $80 when it came out as this will be stellar in a few months...."
"Taste is extremely deep and comforting with tons of malt, oak, vanilla. Herbaceous and maybe a little medcinal. Fruity and spicy with some peppery notes. Orange, peach, tangerine, maybe a little tropical note. Lovely and complex, and as great as advertised. Soft and a little creamy in the mouth, but not too heavy duty in the body. Carbonation is zippy, but not obnoxious. Dries nicely. Overall this is an exceptional beer, superb balance and packed with flavour. I may never drink this again, so I'm going to savour the moment!"
"Much better than standard Damnation in my opinion, idea of aging a pale Golden ale is interesting b ut it works, highly recommended if you can track down a bottle, hope Russian River will do this with another batch in the future"
"Well, like all Russiaan River Belgian style beers, this was amazingly drinkable. I'm generally not a fan of beers that use oak chips as compared to full barrel ageing, but this one was restrained enough in the oak department to still be quite tasty. If wholee barreels had been used it probably would have been ethereal- especially ones that had been softened by long use. Poured very pale golden with an excellent head that faded tto a ring. Smelled sweet and oaky with some light notes of Belgian yeast. Tastes a bit sweet to start with more oakiness quickly following as well as some apple and pear flavors as well as a bit of straw. Crisp and refreshing with a just a bit of tannins on the end. Goes down very easily, even with the oak- shocking for its high abv. Not my absolute favorite beer from them, but very nice."
"Pours a clear light copper hue with a fluffy two finger bleach white head. Stickiness is all over and doesn't plan on letting go. Lots of tiny bubbles constantly racing to the top. Smell is of white grapes, fresh autumn apples, and sweet citrus. Spices and some pepper also emerge as well as a tingle of honey in the nose. A tiny hint of wood also mixes in throughout. After the first sip, the one thing that comes to mind is a sweet NY Riesling. Honey and pear up front with a spicey corriander tingle. Pleasant oak flavors with a honey and banana combination. The aftertaste is a bit boozey with some vanilla. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy with a medium body. Carbonation is very smooth, I really enjoy how this one feels in the mouth. I may be taking a different approach with Damnation by trying Batch 23 first, but hey, everyone is different. A non-oak aged version is in the fridge waiting as we speak, Batch 30 to be exact. Russian River continues to blow me away. Keep up the good work Vinnie!"
"Cheers!"
"Aroma is sweet, lightly spicy, with twinges of alcohol and oak coming out at the end. Taste follows the nose's guide, with the front being the sweet/spice area, and the latter half being oaky and alcohol focused. Halves meld together better as the brew warms. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very impressive. Except this is the only bottle I have, so I'll have to just remember this one, and keep an eye out in the meantime."
"Pours a hazy honey and straw gold with a decent white head that quickly recedes to a ring. Aroma is sweet honey, soft vanilla, lemon, and some grassiness; a little agitation also produces some nice woody oakiness and some booziness. Nice soft sweetness cushions the palette up front before some lemon and citrus develops, a touch of tartness fights to surface but is held pretty much in check by the sweetness. Nice grassy and straw flavor towards the end mix well with a crisp effervescent bite on the tongue. Alcohol becomes evident mid taste thru the finish but is never overpowering in the taste. Oak flavor also comes in mid taste and pushes into a drying finish. Really wish I had another one of these as this seems that it will develop very nicely with a couple years in the cellar. Thanks to Tim for the chance to try this."
"Poured from the bottle at the brewery on July 25, 2007 into a thin chalice. I am immediately taken aback by how mellow the oak is. This isnt an overwhelming bourbony oak by any means, just a light dusting of wood and vanilla. Body pours a brilliant and well carbonated gilded copper with a 2 inch off white head that dissipates quickly to a steady but thin lace. Loads of butter in the aroma like a California Chardonnay. Taste is sweet and boozey. Orange and sweet apples, tannins, vanilla, and a touch of spiciness. Chewy and very warming mouthfeel. Barleywine like. Fairly drinkable. I managed to finish the bottle, mostly by my self so it must be. Should improve with time. Plan on revisiting in a couple years."
"This beer definitely is strong, while the 10.5% does not quite hit you over the head, it is still noticeable. I really am enjoying the soft, orange like flavors & aromas in this beer; these notes pair quite well with some of the oak components. I have a feeling this beer will age quite well for a long time. In fact, this beer really needs to age for quite some time as it is a bit too young right now; perhaps a year but maybe even three would do this beer wonders To tell you the truth, I wouldn't be surprised if this peaked at 5 or 10 years even. It is certainly not a bad tipple right now, it is just that I see this getting a lot better."
"Luckily I am able to get this beer easily from my favorite shop in SF, City Beer! I will lay down several bottles because this one will be a great beer if not already in a few years. I have sent(traded) at least a 6 back east and can't wait to see them review it."
"Quite a bit different from the regular Damnation. I like this a bit more than the regular because the flavor and aroma are more complex and rewarding. Great one-off beer by RRBC. Better get your hands on this while it lasts."
"I really feel that the drinkabilty of this ""batch"" dropped with the increase in alcohol and body. Overall I feel that this is a very good beer however very different than past Damnations. Sip this one. Plan on laying a couple bottles down."
