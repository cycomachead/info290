"A belgian tripel with pumpkin and spices. Sounds odd, but actually works well. The floral belgian yeast compliments the pumpkin and spice nicely. Clean undertones of the pumpkin and spice make it work, instead of being big and overwhelming. A well done beer with a unique twist."

"Pale malt flavor start.  The swallow is creamy with an all spice bite.  There's a touch of sweetness.  The aftertaste has cream, nutmeg and cinnamon notes.  With the sugar, it works.  Decent alcohol warmth on the back of the throat.  The body and carbonation are quite good."

"O- the pumpkin spiced triple is a style that I hadn't seen before this, but I like it.  The pumpkin spices seem to complement the base triple flavors & aromas quite nicely.  I'd like to see more of this combo tried in the future"

"Love this blend of pumpkin, nutmeg and normal triple essences. Lots of spice in the aroma. Initial foamy head subsides rapidly. Taste comes alive with lots of butter, coriander, floral notes. Velvety smooth, nice spicy finish."
""
""
""
"A great tripel with a lack of pumpkin taste that loses points but still stays strong as being to true to its overall style."

"Not a whole lot of quality canned Belgian styles, so this is a treat. A hazy and heady bright blonde beer, it definitely looks the part. Sweet candy sugar and wheat malt nose is really intensely Belgian, with pear and apple and winter spice notes from the yeast, big no doubt too, with a little booze showing through. Floral at first sip, yeast meets hops, and I immediately the hop dosage here, more than other examples of the style and it's a success. Yeasty too, heavy from it despite ample carbonation, and more sweetness than I care for usually, but that's more a commentary on the style, not necessarily this specific beer. Fruity and spicy both, this yeast is gnarly. Grainy texture is cool, but one is enough. I like what these guys are doing for canned beer, cool to have this as an option, although I prefer their IPA."

"Deep golden yellow color in the body I expect a bit of haze in a tripel, this one has some herbal vegetal pumpkin earthiness off the bat.  Fine creamy head with nice patterns of lace.  Aroma has a bubblegum note,, with honey coated biscuit malt, and spice with pumpmkin flesh.  Flavor  a bit too sweet and cloying for me.  Spices although subtle just don't mesh well with this 8.2% abv Belgian style tripel, comes off cloying after the first few sips.  I can feel the alcohol in this one, way more well hidden booze notes in the dark baltic porter, the tripel seems a bit fusel.  Mouthfeel doesn't burn with alcohol but the warmth hits me, carbonation is not effervescent enough spices linger and don't belong in this style but each sip stays on the palate.  Overall, I want a straight up tripel but pumpkins and spice sell in this season!"
""
""
"Overall, I like the baltic porter better than this one. There just isn't much in the way of pumpkin character here and it ends up being more like a messy tripel. Still, it is a good beer but not really to style."
""
"Overall, I say this was pretty good as I know I would have it again, but pumpkin,  well I didn't really get it."
"Overall: A good twist on a Belgian style Tripel. Good pumpkin flavor that stands out but doesnâ€™t bury the Belgian fruit esters. A nice unique brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While this was a tough beer for me to rate, I really like it. I am not big into strong pumpkin flavors, but I am very happy with this beer and would drink again."
""
""
"Overall: not an outstanding tripel, but a perfectly serviceable one."
""
""
""
""
"Finally a 21st amendment beer that I like."

"It's a pretty clear yellow color.  Has a spicy smell and taste.  Lots of carbonation.  Pretty good spiced triple!"

"This poured a deep yellow with plenty of yeast floating in it for haze.  Fat head of cream colored foam that fell slowly enough and left a film on top and a ring.  Nose is as brilliant as the shine form out of the body of the beer. Soft malt, biscuity , sweet with honey.  Fruitiness and a bit of the pumpkin.  Spice and floral.  The drink is outstanding. A nice pumpkin and spice flavor lightly meshed with a stone fruitiness. Juicy sweet and has a taste of honey.  The malt is a treat and it's supple.  A good carbonation on a medium body and this finishes dry and with just a hint of booze. A wonderful tripel from these folks."

"The medium body offers a nice, creamy smoothness off a light crispness. The overall effect is clean, even as it dries out into the finish."
""
""
""
"A well done Tripel with the pumpkin playing a light, pleasant role."
""
"Overall: I like this one better than the porter. The pumpkin and spice seem to add quite a bit more to the beer, and it balances out nicely. I never would have thought to make a pumpkin tripel."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this was an interesting combination. With there was a bit more pumpkin in this one but overall, quite tasty."
""
""
""
"O) 4.25.... higher? possibly."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer, overall. The mix of pumpkin ale and tripel works alright, though I wish there were a bit more depth in the flavor and less bitterness."
""
""
"O: I found this beer to be a rather nice blend between a Tripel and a Pumpkin Ale. It's a nice treat for the fall season if you like pumpkins but want a beer that's a little different compared to the rest."
""
""
"Poured from a can into a tulip goblet. Huge creamy white head (long-lived), nice honey color, clearly unfiltered/tremendous lacing. Very Belgian yeast smelling, apples/pears- smelled tart, a bit of leather/band aids as it opened up. Tastes of honey and Belgian yeast, lingering bitterness o the backside, which balances the sweetness of the beer nicely. Nicely carbonated with a medium-heavy body. This is an excellent beer. Would I have it again? HELL YES!"
""
""
"O- There's something off-putting about the aroma but the rest of the beer works well. I like it much better than the Pumpkin Baltic Porter that makes up the other half of the 4-pack."
""
"12 ounce can, canned on 09/09/13. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy dark gold color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like pumpkin, bready malt, cloves, Belgian yeast, and some peppery spice. It tastes like pumpkin, pumpkin spices, peppery spice, Belgian yeast, candy sugar, and some mint and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. To me it's more of a pumpkin ale than a tripel, but I'm not complaining. I liked this brew, definitely worth a try especially if you like pumpkin beers."
""
""
"O - Well, one of the better pumpkin brews I have ever tried combined with a great triple. Does not get much better than this one"
"A very good Pumpkin Ale. If you are looking for a traditional Tripel, this does not do the trick."
""
""
"Not bad and perhaps a smidge better than the Baltic Porter but lackluster. I appreciate the effort to brew something different but this just didn't quite deliver."
"Overall not bad, pumpkin and spices get a little much but still kept in check, spices eventually get overwhelming, but still tastes like a beer so not too bad, nice malts and booze profile."
""
"O: My neighbor gave me a 4-pack of this stuff as a gift. Impressive!"
"A fantastic brew."

"Overall I'm quite impressed. I like the boldness of it, and the brash slap of alcohol. The spice is interesting, and I like the way that it's dotted with short notes of sweetness, and finally mint. Quite unique."
"The Crack! and inverted Glug went smoothly, resulting in two dense, rocky fingers of eggshell-white head with good retention. Color was a hazy golden-yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7) and the Guess Who were back on a reunion tour. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it was Croesus, Mammon and King Midas, all fighting for a sip. I am not sure how I feel about the nose. It has a mustiness from the yeast that seems to be at odds with the spices. It is kind of evocative of pumpkin pie, but at the same time it smells odd. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous and it feels like a glob in my mouth and on my tongue. There is also some alcohol heat going on, giving the spices a real opportunity to be experienced. Phew! I have yet to try Crime and/or Punishment, but this may be as spicy as I would like. Finish was dry, really dry, dry to the point that I may need my inhaler later. Phew! This is no-playin'-around beer!"
""
""
""
"I may finally be warming up to these pumpkin spice beers. Keep the actual pumpkin to a minimum, and I am generally happy."
"This is not a great Tripel. It's not a great pumpkin beer, either. But it's better than the sum of its parts. At the very least, it's consistently interesting, and worth a try."
""
"Mixed with the Tripel He Said: a far more balanced nose, spices play with pumpkin to a nice backdrop of roast. Mouthfeel is fuller than either alone, and the taste is again more balanced; it's as though one only tastes the best parts of both brews. The finish is shorter, again perfectly balanced, but at the very end becomes almost too vegetal. I'd rate the mix at 4.85, it is so close to the perfect pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love the nose on this. Airy and slightly sugar toned with a hint of pumpkin tone to things. Flavor is smooth. Nice balance of sweetness and consistent accents of pumpkin. Very smooth feel as well. I can tell that I like this much more than the Baltic porter version. Very nice beer."
""
""
"O:"
""
""
""
"Overall quite nice, and I like the fact it's not very pumpkin forward, does feel like a spiced tripel. Good job."
""
""
"Overall â€“ This was a rather enjoyable drinking brew. Just enough pumpkin pie to give the flavor, all while maintaining enough lightness to maintaining a very easy drinking and non offensive taste. Sweeter, fruity, and lightly pumpkin pie spiced with a very easy drinking and delicious taste."
""
""
"Overall an interesting concept beer, but I would rather the two styles have been separated. Not sure I'll be revisiting this."
""
""
"Poured from a can into a snifter, the beer is a bright, hazy, honey-gold coloring with only a very thin, sparse coating of white head. Aromas of subtle pumpkin sweet, coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, apricot, clove, and bubblegum. Rich, sweet, and spiced, all together in a balancing blend. Flavors are pumpkin sweet and cinnamon and nutmeg spiced on the forward tongue, with a more heavily spiced character on the tail end, more typical of the Belgian styles, with some fruity sweet notes, as well. Coriander and clove join the pumpkin spices, leading to a moderately spiced, tangy sweet aftertaste. Mid-bodied and very crisp, with a linger of spices in the tangy sweet finish. Solid brew."
"I used to live in Seattle and I was an avid attendee of the Elysian Pumpkinfest every year- such great beers, not just by Elysisan of course, but they always had an amazing six or eight different varieties of pumpkin beers they brewed themselves, and most were very good, and they surely were creative. I was excited to see that Elysian was involved in this. This pumpkin tripel is not bad at all, but perhaps a tad on the sweet side. Nicely spiced with fall spices, and with a touch of pumpkin creaminess. I'd like a bit less sweetness and a bit more pumpkin- not just the spices, still I enjoyed it well enough."
""
"Golden yellow with an orange hue and a deep haze. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Spicy coriander and sweet pumpkin aromas with belgian yeast notes underneath. Medium bodied with smooth viscous feel and tangy semi-dry finish.Sweet pumpkin flavors and spices throughout. Tangy hop bite in the middle leads to a semi-dry finish. Much bigger pumpkin presence than I had expected. This was excellent.Â "
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice tripel first. The quiet spicing plays well with the esters and phenols from the yeast. A well balanced and drinkable beer to pair with fall foods."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a disappointment, but not unpleasant. If you're really looking for pumpkin beers..."
""
""
"Poured this from the can, it has orange color body with a small head. The aroma has a light smell of spice. The taste has a light spice to it, a little pumpkin but not much. The mouthfeel is smooth and leaves a little bite and overall has a good form or the belgium tripel."
""
"TASTE: Medium body, very smooth, stone fruit, dry maltiness, stodgy pumpkin, pie spice, peppery alcohol, mild phenols, leafy hop, clean alcoholic twang, lingering spicy finish, lands dry"
""
""
"O - I think it could be better. The smell is great but the taste and mouthfeel leave a little bit to be desired. Overall, I like that it's a lighter pumpkin beer and not spice dominated."
""
"O: A cool concept providing two beers in a 4 pack, generally what I do when i create my own six anyways (two of each). I liked it, a great beer, but not a great pumpkin ale, for those of you who were looking for one."

"I an really liking this beer - especially considering I'm not a fan of either tripel or pumpkin styles."
"A pretty decent brew, tends almost towards saison flavors, with a nice balance of pumpkin. The pumpkin actually feels a little weird with this style, so its good that they kept it subtle. This is worth trying at least once and I like it, but it's also strange enough that I'd consider it kind of a novelty. I prefer the porter out of the two of this series, but this one at least lives up to the pumpkin label more noticeably."
"The body was pretty typical for the style, medium and slightly sticky on the finish. Drinkability was OK, the spiciness accumulated over the length of the glass, and I was a bit tired of it by the end. Overall, one of the better P-beers I've had. I can't honestly recommend it, but I won't tell anybody to not try it either. If you like Tripels, and you like Pumpkin, you'll probably like this beer."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits, pumpkin, some spices. Taste is fruity, Belgian yeast up front, some pumpkin and spices later. A bit unusual, alcohol is well hidden. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a unique and pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, a good pumpkin beer since the pumpkin doesn't overwhelm."
" The taste brings an odd herbal aspect with what I am guessing is a tarragon/ galangal but is also sort of floral with a gentle spiciness which augments the malt sweetness in a balanced way. The taste has a mild vegetal fullness with some mild alcohol which accentuates the spice after the swallow. As the beer warms more spice which has an earthy ginger-like taste which borders on medicinal with the phenols of the yeast. Overall I liked this but would probably not get it again based on the spice being a little forward for my taste."
""
"Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a fine two finger white head with decent retention and lots of lacing. Aroma dominated by pumpkin, clove and allspice, a hint of nutmeg and Belgian yeast. Flavor is pumpkin; nearly pumpkin pie filling in character with Belgian yeast and a combination of pie spicing (clove, cinnamon, light nutmeg) and classic tripel cardamom; nicely balanced. Medium bodied with light creaminess, satisfying. A well melded pumpkin ale that retains tripel character while presenting the pumpkin pie character nicely. Spicing is deftly handled. I either really love or hate pumpkin beers and it really hinges on authentic pumpkin flavor and a light, but distinct use of holiday spicing. This one scores on both fronts. A really enjoyable pumpkin beer and an unusual style for pumpkin that I will put into my fall rotation if it is made again."

""
"Ambitious take on the classic, that misses the mark...one and done here fo sho"
""
""
"All in all, this installment of the He Said duel is a good beer."
"Overall: This is a damn good triple! I really enjoy the addition of the pumpkin beer flavors to the typical triple flavors. Iâ€™m certainly getting this again."
""
"Looks like a tripel-yellow gold with a slight white head coating the surface. Ripe fruit (apple, banana, pear, citrus) and spice (besides typical clove, nutmeg and cinnamon) in the aroma. Very dry with some fruit flavor in the beginning, then bitterness, ending in alcohol warmth with a touch of creaminess. Just a whiff of the pumpkin pie spices as I exhale after a sip, but not sure that I'd get that if I wasn't looking for it. Not a great example of a tripel."
""
"A beer whose kindred spirit is Really Good Bran Muffin or Paper Rose -- a simple, approachable entity that the majority of those encountering it might not readily deem ... definitively stellar. That said, I WILL eat superior bran muffins with some frequency and paper roses are hella hard to make so, like, mad props, you know?"
""
"Interesting beer, but not really working for me. Not bad, I just think it would need some revision with the spicing or malt selection to strike a balance with the yeast that would make it more enjoyable."
"Overall: I appreciate the different take on the style. The pumpkin is more present at the beginning and meshes well with the tripel flavors. Creative..I would get this again."

"Interesting beer. It's basically your typical attempt at a Tripel by an American brewery. The pumpkin spices are barely noticeable, in my opinion. Solid beer, but nothing too exciting. I enjoyed He Said Baltic Porter way more."
""
""
"It's not bad, but not good either."
""
""
""
""
"Overall for $2,50 it was pretty sweet. I like smooth Triples that hide the ABV well so it's a winner for me. Very sweet vegital taste as well."
"Overall: Delicious, interesting beer. Both an excellent tripel and a refreshing departure from the more common pumpkin beer styles."

"Spice profile completely dominates this beer to the point that it's distracting. A lot of stuff going on with a nice, almost clean finish. It's a good take on the style, but leaves something to be desired in the long run."

"O/D-Really surprised to find that I like the Tripel He Said more than the Porter He Said. It's pretty neat. The pumpkin works surprisingly well with the Tripel style."
"D - Definitely much more of a Tripel than a Pumpkin Ale... The pumpkin notes are uber subtle... If I didn't now they were present, I would have a hard time actually detecting them... With all that being said it's a solid and enjoyable beer, but not quite what I was expecting... Not sure I would rank this high in terms of either Tripels or Pumpkin Ales, but for those seeking out unique offerings this one may fit the bill..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a beer that you really need to try, between the taste / aroma and mouthfeel it's a very unusual and yet pleasing beer."
""
"O: Honestly this was much better than I was expecting from a pumpkin tripel, and definitely something I'd look to purchase again! It's pretty competitive with Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale for my favorite pumpkin beer, though since they're different styles it's difficult to compare. Anyway, you should totally check this beer out if you get the chance."
"O- Very complex and interesting beer. The pumpkin pie and Belgian tripel notes actually blend together quite well and complement each other. Lots of sweetness but it is cut by the alcohol and bitterness so it is just right."
""
""
"Classic tripel flavors mixed with a soft pumpkin, not so much pumpkin pie, but more of a pumpkin shortbread cookie. The heavy pie-like flavors were absent. I feel the flavors balance nicely. Nothing to write home about, but also nothing to pass on when at the store. with 2 cans of this and 2 of the baltic porter costing a mere 9 bucks, check it out."
"Serving type:"
"Drank from a pint glass. Comes in a 12 oz. can"
"O- very nice take on a pumpkin beer, great combo, very creative. The pumpkin flavor isn't too obvious but it's there. I must say I liked the porter better but this is solid"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"PS I keep getting more and keep uprating it, seems to be a beer that tastes better the more you get used to this mix of styles."
""
""
"OV: This is a very enjoyable brew, wonderful aromas and a flavour that makes you want more. Might have been even better had the flavours of pumpkin/spices and the flavours of a Tripel blended more instead of coming in stages, but this is still a very solid and tasty beer. Nicely done from 21st Amendment and Elysian."
""
"One of my new winter favorites"
""
""
""
"O.A.: a good beer from a great brewery, I love these guys and will try just about anything they do, especially their brews that are more on the wild/different side, to have a four pack with 2 each of two separate style of beers is genius! keep up the good work 21st a.!!"
