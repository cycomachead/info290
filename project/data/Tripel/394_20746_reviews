"I have a bias to Belgian goldens so these will inevitably be my higher ranked beer but this lacked depth. It didn't quite linger as long as I'd expect for a Belgian style ale. A bit more aroma would've been nice too. Props to a domestic brewery though for puttin out a Belgian. We need more of these."

"Overall I would say that this is a good beer! In fact, I would definitely recommend trying it. If you could, put this up against a La Fin Du Monde and compare. I would love to do that some time. I would bet that there is a pretty big difference. I am going to give this a 3.8 out of 5 overall. I like it and want to drink it again, but I've recently had better and can recall the flavors. This might be better if it was cellared a year!"

"O: Overall, just above average Tripel. It looks great in the glass, but the smell and taste were underwhelming."

"Overall: Really tasty and well-rounded balance of flavor, and light-bodied enough to have more than one. I particularly enjoyed drinking this beer."
""
"O- I remember this being better back when I didn't know the style as well."
""
""
""
"O: An alright tripel overal, though nothing spectacular. It's a little lacking in depth and body, but is far from bad."
""
""
""
"Poured into a chalice. Pours mostly clear golden with minimal head and some yeast sediment. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. There is some of that banana and clove smell. I also detect the alcohol in the aroma. This tripel definitely as plenty of banana expression in the flavor. There is sweetness and breadiness from the malt with some back end bitterness and spiciness. The alcohol is detectable in the taste. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is smooth and not as dry as typical tripels. This is a very good beer."
"For an American tripel, pretty solid."
""
""
"Overall: Not too bad. This one would make a great base beer for barrel aging. Nice beer."
""
""
""
"I was really glad I purchased this case. I wouldnt pay top dollar for this but it is certainly a well made Tripel and worthy of any reasonable price tag."
"Overall, a disappointing attempt at a tripel. Alcohol overwhelmed the palate, and the flavors really seemed dulled."
""

"O- I'd take this over some of the Belgian examples of the style. May be a bit too sweet for some, but I think it really works, and makes for a very approachable, and delicious Belgian Triple. I also see in many of the reviews that the alcohol is too forward in this brew, and I just don't get that. It is certainly there, but at no time dominates the sip. Great stuff."
"Overall this brew is very basic, malt, yeast and hops and not much else. Additionally, the alochol is not well masked and remains on the palette as an aftertaste."
"Overall: another solid tripel out of all the ones I have had over the years. They seem only to get better with time. Even though the Belgiums have been doing this for many many years, breweries over here in the states seem to be putting out a good product also."
""
""
""
"Plenty going on here without becoming too unwieldy or dropping the ball. Not the most complex tripel I've had, but very enjoyable & one I'd be happy to grab again. Now if I could only get to the bottom of that IKEA association!"
""
""
"Neither here nor there... this is a Mr. 5 beer that doesn't wow but doesn't disappoint *too* terribly. The unfiltered, pillowy, peachy-iced-tea color is the most attractive thing, but otherwise this is far too muted for a tripel. The aroma and taste that one expects from a tripel-- salty, hammy, funky bread-- are present but they seem unable to escape from the padded bag into which they've been stuffed. You won't have to work very hard to decode this beer. A reasonable intro but not much beyond that."
""
""
""
"Overall I like this brew. The bottle conditioning brought the carbonation level up rather high. After writing this and reading some other reviews, it appears that the carbonation level I had in this bottle might have been excessive, skewing the M: score down a tick. I will have to try another if I can find a different lot."
""
""
"Overall – While not the best Belgian triple I have ever had, very enjoyable none the less. Nothing stands out, but nothing brings it down; overall moderately balanced."
""
"Bottle courtesy of my sister. Clear golden hue capped by a small foamy head with almost no retention. Light citrus, grass, and dull earthiness in the nose. Taste is big cracker sweetness, sour apple, light clove, and flowers. Big full body, light carbonation to assist. A good solid beer."

"Morey's Bottom Line: This just isn't my favorite style of beer. I like them, but I've yet to have one that I love. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this is one of the hardest beer styles to differentiate between."
"O: Haven't had many of this style but I have to say I enjoyed it. Now to clean that sediment off the bottom of this glass."

"Overall, good but not great. The Belgian yeast is the star of this show."
""
""
""

"Golden orange in color with a heavy haze. Poured with a short white foamy head that quickly reduced to a thick cap that leaves random sticky lacings on the glass. Earthy, musty, belgian yeast and banana aromas are dominant with hints of citrus orange, sugar and booze. Medium bodied with rich, lively carbonation. Tangy citrus orange up front that immediately transitions to banana that carries through to almost the finish. Strong musty belgian yeast flavor from beginning to end. Finishes with a yeasty, bready aftertase and a definite boozy character. Not the best triple I've had, but I enjoyed it thoroughly."

"Overall, this is a brew I have bought before and will bu again. I think I aged some once but it didn't change much in character - maybe a little mellowing."
"Notes: Well, I gotta say. When I tried this beer at just over a year old it was amazing. More complex than the fresh bottles and it really sang. Now...almost at 2 years old...not so much. Kind of in a quiet mess stage. Got a few more bottles, we'll see what happens."
"Overall I am not sure how old this one is (nice bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle) but nice beer overall."
"O - I haven't had many tripels but this one seems pretty good for an American version. Would definitely buy again."
"Bottle into tulip (sampled 6/24/10). Poured a beautiful dark amber with a bright white head that fell slowly throughout the drink. Nose was heavy of banana, peach, and raisin, as I would expect from an abbey style trlpel. It was a little slick and very creamy on the tongue but the flavors mixed well with a slight spice bite at the end to balance everything. Overall this is a fine effort and a good example of the style."
"O - This was a decent tripel...nothing too exciting from the nose...but the flavors and finish came together nicely"
"I try not to be overly critical of certain flavors. I feel like a rating shouldn't suffer because I don't like one particular flavor, but I really freakin hate the intense banana vibe to this. Maybe if it were balanced out by a little dryness or spiciness, but the brew is pretty one-dimensionally sweet. Good effort, but I certainly wouldn't spend the $13.99 they want for a 6-er of this."
"This is a pretty solid tripel brewed here in the U.S., not bad at all, I'd have it again. Stoudt's always comes though."
"Pours an oragish gold color with a tight one finger head which gives way to some lace. The aroma is of belgian yeast along with banana's and citrus fruits. The taste follows suit for the most part, belgian candy yeast with hints of banana and citrus flavor. There is also a spiciness which balances out the sweet flavor of the beer. The mouthfeel is well carboanted. Overall it is a solid beer but not the top of the glass. The spiciness of the taste brought a nice balance to the beer. This is something I would drink again."
"Poured a slightly hazy golden-orange, with a fluffy white head. Aroma of biscuity pale malts, banana esters, and light sugars. Pretty typical for a tripel. Bready taste, yeasty, infused with malt sweetness, banana and apple skin, with light sensations of clove and pepper coming in later. Medium mouthfeel, chewy, and pretty drinkable for the style."
"O- I was a little disappointed in the aroma. It wasn't as complex as I was expecting. There was a bit more in the taste but still not as complex as I would have liked. Overall I really enjoyed the beer but it fell short of what a Belgian Triple should have. It had the basics, but needed a bit more"
"O- Decent beer. Not outstanding, but a solid brew that's on the light side for it's style. I enjoyed it though, and it definitely has some potential w/ aging."
"Overall a brilliant beer from this city, one to look for when there."
"Drinks pretty good. I wouldn't want it all the time, but the occasional sixer would work."
"www.thepizzaproject.blogspot.com/2011/02/boozein-50-words-or-less-stoudts-triple.html"
" Very nicely carbonated with a good amount of smoothness to it. This was a medium bodied ale; slightly lighter then that without any thinness though. Definitely not too light or bad really in any way,"
"O - Very easy to put back and huge bang for the buck. I could see myself having a grand evening with two or three of these. But, I wouldn't recommend doing such a thing. I love this beer. Really impressed. Honestly I wasn't expecting much from it as I don't recall anything from Stoudt's being very memorable. In all fairness I haven't given them much of a chance. I will pay more attention to them simply because of this beer."
"D: While I'm not a big fan of Belgian styles in general this is a very well crafted beer that has held up nicely for 2 and a half plus years. I only had one, but it would not be a problem to put back a few more."
"Pours a cloudy orangy light amber, minimal white head and minor lacing left on the glass. Smell is strong of citrus, plum, vanilla, and mild clove. Sweet and somewhat creamy, tastes of sugary orange and plums, with a slightly hoppy finish. Minor spicy overtones, also with a delicate honey like flavor. Just an average tripel from a mass producer."
"The beer has some minor flaws, not harsh and unforgivable, but not what I would seek in a Tripel."
" Feel could use a boost or three, seems kinda dead in the water to me, not lively enough is what Im trying to say. A nice medium body with light carb and not enough activity going on in the mouth. I need more zing. This just places the fruits blandly without any crisp punch. This is really the only fault I see in this beer, it really exceeded my expectations. While I could not drink a shit ton of this, I would buy a sixer to drink throughout the year. This is one of the better American Triples I've had recently, at 1 ½ years old."
"Drinkability: Stoudts makes some good beers but this isn't one of them; they are not a brewery noted for the Belgian style and this is a good example for why that is the case; this is overly sweet and hot and lacking in yeasty complexity"
"As I said, they did a decent job, better than i'd anticipated. It has that malt liquor thing going on, but a somewhat sturdy base of a triple underneath. Overall its character didn't at any time strike me as Belgian, despite the Belgian yeast in the recipe. I'll stick to their other offerings."
"D: This is not a great interpretation of the traditional Belgian style but not many American breweries can do it well."
"I could have another one sure."
"Pours a nice pale straw color with a little white head and tons of suspended sediment. Smells of fruity Belgian malt, banana, clove, a little orange zest, a little caramel. First taste is a lightly spiced Belgian wheat with yeast, some of that clove and citrus previously mentioned, banana, and some light flavors that are escaping me at the moment. Finishes sweet and a little thick, a little lingering citrus and spice. Carbonation lightens the body to medium-ish, otherwise it would be a thick and chewy texture. The amount of yeast floating around was a little surprising, and it doesn't really settle out, but that's not really a hindrance. Easy to drink, and hides its ABV dangerously well. Doesn't taste quite as mature as your typical triple, but still delicious. This has become one of my more regular purchases."
"D: Amazingly drinkable for a 9% ABV brew. The only thing that hurts this one is the fact that there is a lot of stiff competition in the Tripel category. Still, Stoudts is a very good brewery."
"I was really hoping for a lot more from this beer. There are some great Belgian characteristics (tart spice, sweet fruits), but that nagging alcohol burn is really unsettling. Maybe this one would do better with some age, but I really think this is an average American attempt at a classic Belgian style."
"Drinkability: a nicely drinkable tripel, if a bit hot on the alcohol flavors. I would have this again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Stoudt's has proven that they can be on the same level or even better than the Germans in the Helles style, but the Belgian Triples are still way better than this one."
"A pretty good beer, good flavor though not a lot really stood out for me. But it was very refreshing and very easy to drink."
"Not the best, but I do enjoy this beer and have a spot in my heart for it."
"Pours a largely clear orange, copper body, with a small white head that dissipates after one minute. Aromas are remarkably similar to those of a German wheat beer: mostly sweet, a bit yeasty, and with a whiff of sourdough bread. Taste-wise, the highly effervescent texture notes give way to a distant, un-named dark fruitiness."
"A real sipping beer. I wouldn't go for more than one in a session. Should be paired with appropriate foods as well, bolder foods like smoked ham or cheeses and whole grain breads or crackers. Not a bad offering. But my favorites from Stoudt's are the lager and pilsner styles."
"Stoudts Triple is a slightly hazy, very sparkling golden ale with a dense off-white head that fades to a sturdy film that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a fruity aroma with notes of bananas, clove, peaches and phenol. It's medium bodied, foamy and very smooth with a clean, dry finish. It's well balanced, fruity and phenolic. It tastes very much like the aroma. It's spicy and a touch bitter at the finish. This is really tasty and drinkable stuff."
"Bottle. No freshness date. Pours a slightly hazy golden light orange color with a fluffy 1 finger head. A very clean aroma with notes of spice and belgian yeast esters. Almost has a metallic smell to is, hmmm. Sweet malt flavors up front followed by notes of banana and spice. Slight bitterness and alcohol notes at the end. Medium mouthfeel."
"Smell is lightly fruity, the color is orangeish gold, taste is spicy and malty with a finish of pepper, makes for a very pleasant experience sipping it. Not my favorite of the style but a good example none the less and drinkable enough. Would be good with chicken and pasta."
"pretty run of the mill triple, Ive had better Ive had worse. Appearance was good, poured a nice 2 finger head, with decent lacing, taste was good, what can i say it tastes like a triple. There are better triples but this one is just fine for the price it just doesn't blow you away. I love belgians, and it passed my test I will continue to buy it periodically. Give it a try!"
"D - Very nice. Not the greatest Tripel in the world but I would never turn this beer down."
"D-very interesting, a little sweet but a good balance of spice. pretty solid tripel. booze comes through a little but not too bad."
"Drinkability: A nice solid well made beer worth drinking again even though its not at the top of my list of triples. While it lacks a certain subtle complexity found in the triples I prefer (e.g., La Fin du Monde, Westmalle) it is a well-made worthwhile beverage that I'll probably be sipping on tap again one day.b"
"For 9% abv, this is a fairly easy drinking triple. A bit too sweet for me, but otherwise it's nice."
"I'll try a few other tripels, and maybe revisit this one."
"Buy Again? No."
"D - fair."
"Not a bad tripel, not a great tripel. Would recommend."
"D: Very Drinkable as usual Carol and her brew crew do a fantastic job of creating a great brew."
"Drinkability- very super easily drinkable but simple not complex at all for a belgian triple, lacks that secondary complexity and zing, its not bad but not great, nice value price was but alot better still out there"
"Poured into chalice lightly chilled with a soft, shallow head that faded to just a hint for most of the drink. Color was golden haze..much more cloudiness than expected. A good, (again) soft nose, with light floral notes with sweet undertones without any astringent alcohol scent despite the 9% ABV. Taste again was subtle but sweet, oranges, subtle spices and just a shadow of warmth from the higher alcohol content. Not bad...it's actually quite good. This would be a great beer on a warmer day out on the deck or out people-watching in Oostende. Mouthfeel was smooth and pleasant, no harshness at all. Drinkability is down only for the alcohol content but for a tripel...I could drink two of these for sure! Overall, quite a good beer and I'll have to pick up more on my next trip to PA."
"Drinkability is good for this level abv and strong flavors....very nice."
" D- This beer is a bit too sweet and the sweetness really makes the hops too bitter. The fusel notes works well with the sweetness but perhaps some age would help the hops fade."
"Had this in a sample tray at Stoudt's brewery. Loved this one from the first sip."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sweet fruits and spices. Taste is also of fruits and spices, some hints of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality brew."
"Overall: I was pleasently suprised with this beer. I expected a darker heavier beer, but found the lightness and balance of this beer to be well done."
"This is the first Stoudt's beer that I wasn't very happy with."
"D: Solid and I could sit back and have a few of these in a sitting."
"I bought this as a wildcard beer and was relatively impressed. Maybe not the best Abbey I've ever had but it's certainly worth trying. I'll probably pick one or two of these up in the future."
"All-in-all, this beer is great. For those of you who enjoy the American-craft-Belgian-inspired stlye, this is one of the best. Although Stoudts is small and largely unrecognized, they represent this style of beer superbly. Way to kick ass Stoudts!!"
"Notes: Nice, solid tripel."
"D - Not bad at all. Definitely worth a try for a tripel and non tripel fan."
"D- I have found a wide varying difference in this style. The common flavor profile I find to be some what consistent is the sweetness, so I have to be in the mood for this style. This one is a good, not great. I would have this one again....I see me drinking this n the winter as a warmer upper."
"D - It's a good Triple but the aroma is lacking slightly and the spiciness might be a bit too strong. Otherwise it's a winner. I wouldn't have more than one though and the longer I sip at it the more cloying the spiciness becomes."
"Drinkability, this is a pretty good tripel not the most awe inspiring American version but very pleasant"
"Bought a six pack straight from the brew pub. Good Belgian taste. Pours a yellowish-copper color. Nice head. Can both taste and smell the alcohol, even with the 9% ABV. Pleased overall. For some reason, the first time I tried it (about a year ago?), I was much more pleased with this beer. Even still, I wouldn't mind drinking this one all night if I could handle the morning afterwards."
"Drinkability: A slow-sipping, acceptable American-born tripel, though I'm quietly reminded why I haven't regularly purchased this one in the few years since I first tried it."
"Taste is very Belgian as well, yeasty, bready and sharp. That's about it, pretty good for an American Belgian style beer."
"I bought this bottle at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH."
"Don't drink and review."
"This was a great sleeper of a beer. Had no idea what was going on here..."
"Pours a beautiful yellow-golden with a fairly thick white head. Aroma is not strong but malty and rather fruity, mainly apple or pear. Malty flavor has a firm undertone of fruit, almost like a ribbon of cider through the beer. Texture is pleasingly smooth and quite tingly and jazzy."
"hazy golden color thin white head and some lace. smell is better, peachs nectarines green grapes warm alcohol aromas and bubble gum. sweet rock candy taste, fruity warm alcohol finish smooth mouthfeel just slides down waiting for the next sip. mild smooth and warm real nice. just watch how many you have."
"The alcohol is well masked and I gave this beer good marks because it just satisfied my craving for a good tripel."
"Pours a nice light gold, some yeast, some head, very little lacing. Sweet smelling with some clove and lemon. Very well carbonated,taste is better than I had expected. Very light and refreshing. Sweet, slightly unbalanced. Alcohol is not too well hidden. Good, not great."
"Drink ability was above average. Alcohol was a bit too apparent to be session able. Mouth feel and lack of a fluffy head were the main things that separate this beer for the great belgium style ales out there. Would drink again but not available to me locally and not good enough to want to trade for it."
"Medium bodied and mildly carbonated it goes down smooth and easy. Be aware of the high abv which isn't detectable in the smell or taste."
"The beer has a medium body, smooth, creamy and very easy to drink, especially given the higher ABV. Carbonation feels a bit light for a Belgian. Overall a very good beer."
"Poured the nice yellowy-orange I would expect from a beer of this style. There wasn't too much foam on top but I wasn't too concerned about it. This was a very normal tasting triple. I don't use ""normal"" as a negative adjective, it just didn't especially stand out from other triples I've had. Delicious nonetheless."
"I thought it was a good looking poor, nice color with just the right amount of foam. It smelled great to me, hints of spice, fruit and malt. It tasted pretty good too, a nice full flavor. Their was a bit of an alcohol aftertaste however and that turned me off a bit. Overall I liked it."
"Drinkability: Sipper for me - I can't session these Belgians Tripels/Quads. This beer is awesome on tap. Not overly carbonated like a Tripel Karmeliet. Not filling either. I highly recommend this beer as a prime example of a Belgian Style Tripel"
"Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, bordering on too much. I'd prefer less with this style. Keeps this triple from being a smooth abbey ale."
"Great job IMHO. Looking forward to their Double IPA."
"First impression wasn't great, but it opens up as it warms."
"D: Due to the sweetness you would not want to drink more than one of these"
"Fairly drinkable. Not my favorite Tripel. But still have a great deal of respect for Stoudts."
"I think this isn't a bad example of the style. Again, easy to drink. You should check this out."
"Still a pretty good beer, but not sure how often I'd want to have something like this."
"3.5 D: Not bad, but the alcohol is a little too aggressive."
"D: A great beer for a change of pace... It isn't the best Abbey Style Triple out there, but it is worth a try if you can find single bottles.. This is probably amazing on tap."
"d - easily drinkable."
"Nice beer but the sweetness is a touch to much.May need some age.Tasty though"
"Off the tap at the American Flatbread debut event this beer was a deep gold color. The head was thin and white, it left some decent lacing but didn't retain very well. The aroma was semi-sweet and spicy, Belgian yeast and ripe fruits. The flavors however were not so impressive. Too many alcohol esters and too much fruit sweetness that only became more apparent as the beer warmed up. Hints of spiciness were pleasant but the lack of hop balance added to my issues. The 9% was well hidden, however. The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation pleasant and the body medium/full."
"The feel is creamy and a little chewy. Burns on the down: yikes! A pretty good, pretty sweet, pretty strong Tripel. Diggin' it."
"The taste is a bit tart, and a bit too much ABV. There is a clear banana, clove, floral Belgianeque taste to the beer. It doesn't quite have the yeasty efforvescence and mouth feel of other Belgians, it is also less carbonated. There is definitely a sweet, honey flavored present, with a slightly acerbic bite to it in the finish especially. There is a flowery ginger quality to the beer as well, but the sweetness and the too pronounced ABV do diminish this beer and its potential. This isn't a bad Tripel, it does have a throaty ABV burn that takes away from some of the nicer banana and clove and other spices that get too overwhelmed."
"Pours a cloudy orange/gold color with a one finger white head made up of tiny bubbles with little retention and no lacing. Aromas of banana, grains, vanilla. Spicy flavors up clove and corriander mix with banana and orange and some candy sugar. Low carbonation, low to medium body, the mouthfeel is a little syrupy but smooth. Solid drinkability worth a try but there are better triples widely available."
"Pours a small white head with a clear orange body and fair lacing. Average malt and hop flavor that is well balanced, with hints of citrus and grapefruit and a lovely candi sugar smell. This triple is medium bodied with lively carbonation. It is sweet, lightly acidic, and seems to sit on the tongue well into the next sip. A good belgian triple that I would definitely have again."
"Great beer, and a rather good representation of the Tripel. Fruity aroma along with some sweet and sour, rather typical. Beautiful light orange pour with a nice fluffy head that stays and some decent lacing. Mouthfeel is upfront and crisp with a nice smooth finish, the alcohol is noticeable but in a really pleasant way. Flavor is fruity with a medium yeastiness. Mildly spiced, wish this was a touch more dominant. Sour apples keeps coming to mind. Nice one."
"This is typical Americanization of a Belgian style, where the brewers make the beer too sweet and the esters too big, leaving a beer that lacks subtlety. Still, the flavor has a pleasant mix of apple and berry punch flavors with a bit of peppery spice. And the 9% alcohol is well hidden. The sweetness, however, will keep me from going back for another glass."
"The upfront bite makes it less drinkable than other tripels."
"Pours a clear dark golden color. Smells very sweet and malty. Taste is very crisp but not as clean as other tripels. Goes down very well though. Very sweet, malty, with very slight hop spice. All around a solid tripel. Try it."
"Bottom line: The appearance promised a lot but in every other category, this one fell short for me. Still, it's worth a try as ymmv."
"The Drinkability is ok, the brew tries to be nice but comes up short in the total package. MK"
"A slow sipper. Enough trademarks of the style are there to put it in this category, but it could use more complexities. A decent stab at the style, but that's about it."
"Poured into my St. Bernardus Watou glass a cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some spices. The taste is malty/yeasty, nice touch of spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty Tripel, thanks Joe."
"D: The alcohol as noted, is not hidden. A tasty sipper but one you notice and are aware of as you drink it. Not nearly the best of the style, but not too shabby."
"This beer poured out a nice hazy golden straw color with a fast falling head and minimal retention in the glass. The smell is pretty much typical for a tripel... strong malts, yeasty, estery, and with a fairly strong phenolic scent. You can also pick up the alcohol through the nose. This is a good tasting version of a tripel... very yeasty with lots of esters, a nice warming alcohol sensation, and a tart/crisp finish. By no means the best tripel out there... but not bad. A thin bodied brew with a sparkling carbonation feel in the mouth. I found this beer fairly easy to drink despite the 9.0% ABV... it seems to be hidden fairly well by the yeast and malt qualities. If you find this in your travels... it's worth a try!"
"Overall- an enjoyable beer, is it the best triple-no, but still enjoyable"
"D. A bit low due to the high abv. This is definately a strong tripel."
"Not as good as the Triples I've had from Belgium but a pretty good attempt at one. Pours an orange color topped with a thin head. Some lacing ends up on the glass but appearance wise it just doesn't look as good as some of the Belgian Triples. The aroma is quite strong with banana, citrus and vanilla and all of it appearing to be quite sweet. Flavor starts with a spicy citrus flavor with a yeasty wheaty taste mixed in then turns slightly sour and alcoholic. It does seem a little like a stronger Hefeweizen but it's a tad too sweet. The texture is rich and syrupy but I'd like a fuller, better balanced mouthfeel. Overall it's a good beer but it's hard to rate it any higher when there are so many better options."
"A very solid triple in my opinion."
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter glass. pours a very pretty cloudy gold with a white two finger head. the smell is fruity with just a little bit of spice comeing through. This beer tastes very good with fruit ad some hops and just a little bit bitter. The mouthfeel is easy drinking but with the high alcohol (9%) I would not drink to many. definantly a good beer"
"Hazey deep yellow with an orange tint. Large white head that latsed forever but barely stuck to the glass. The smell is very fruity as apposed to spicey upfront. The spice is there but its subdued by fruity esters and alcohol along with some sweet malts as well. Taste is maily a sweet malty backdrop with some bannana and bubble gum flavors overiding the clove and spice, while alcohol and yeast are apparent throughout. The feel of this ale is admirable however the overall taste and drinkability is a little off due to the alcohol overshadowing much of the other flavor."
"D: At 9%, the booziness of the ale hits you square in the forehead. Go for two if you have a DD."
"Drinkability is really only average, a bit rough, boozy and thick, although if I was out somewhere in the mood for a Belgian and this was all they had, it would certainly work."
"A good brew, but I like the Belgian brews where the alcohol is more restrained and light."
"I wouldn't mind drinking this one down more regularly."
"Overall, I have to say I am disappointed in this beer. If I had just picked it up from the store on a whim I would been only mildly disappointed, but I expected more from Stoudt's. I have really enjoyed some of their other beer's and this one just fell flat for me. I don't know if the recipe needs to be changed, but I think the fermentation process could be improved and they can make a much better Belgian Triple."
"This is a good American try at a triple. I think the brew still need to be tweaked a little, to be up to the other awesome brews I have had from Stoudt's"
"D - One and done... Not a session beer in my estimation..."
"#2 in my belgian lineup was this Am. example BOD 11/07 ; pours a very cloudy light gold w/ a thin head which dissipates quickly leaving a moderate amount of lacing and big chunks of sediment all the way down my snifter ; a malty, banana bread-like aroma, alcohol and darker fruits present as well ; a rich malty flavor, some hop bite initially as well, hot alcohol and cereal grains, a hint of floral hop mixed w/ dark fruit in the finish ; a med-full bodied brew, moderate co2, drinks like a 9.00% ABV beer ; a good brew for sure, not as quaffable as the Westmalle, but still a decent tripel..."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. It goes down easily and has a pleasant taste. It's not as vibrant or complex as its Belgian counterparts, but good nonetheless."
"Poured out a gold hazy brew with a weak thin head.Smells of sweet estery typical belgian smell.Taste is a bit odd. Sweet and tart, a bit too much for me,,not good.Leaves a lingering aftertaste.Not a brew ill buy again.The more i drink the worse it gets."
"Tastes like a run-of-the-mill Belgian Tripel, if there were such a thing. It couldn't hang with an Allagash Tripel, but, at the price, and the serving size, it's pretty much unparalleled. I assure you, this captures all the essence, if not all the flair, of the finest Belgian Tripels. Besides, an average Tripel is still a damn sight better than an average macro-lager in my book."
"Good creamy mouthfeel, a little strong on the bannana to get a great drinkability."
"Stoudt's Triple pours a hazy gold with a nice thick head. The aroma is sweet with dry chalky yeast and fruity esters. The aroma is a bit sweet with plenty of pale malt and a bit astringent, almost sour. There is plenty of flavor from the yeast, just a bit of the banana clove taste I would expect from a german wheat beer, and the finish is dry. The alcohol is fairly well hidden for the strength. The odd sour, astringent flavor kind of dominates, and lingers in the finish, and hurts what is other wise a very good beer."
"d: I like this one a lot and it's one of the few beers my girlfriend loves. This is the main reason she agrees to go to Stoudt's with me."
"A heavy beer at 9%, it will do well with spicy steaks, lamb or other gamey meats."
"D- a very decent and good beer. easy to put a down a six pack and very smooth. The spices are a little strong and might cause trouble for those who dont like spiced beer."
"D: Not really drinkable in great quantity, but a nice brew. Even though it's not technically to style I'll still give this brew high marks"
"This beer poured a golden straw color with a fluffy two-finger head. The smell was of yeast and sweet malts and a little bit of alcohol. The taste was a bit peppery melting to malty sweetness in the middle with a little bit of yeast and a punch of alcohol at the end. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with a pretty small amount of carbonation. A decent sipping beer, but I certainly wouldn't reach for it in any quanitity."
"Copped a single, 12 oz bottle from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa... Nice, hazy and cloudy appearance with a frothy head that soon dissipated... Smell was replete with citrus, florals, and sweet, ripe fruit... taste wasn't above and beyond for the style, but wasn't bad nontheless... very sweet and slightly cloying, with strong sugar and candy essences... Aftertaste is loaded with sweet candy and sugar as well, with a pretty good thick and rich mouthfeel and a slightly above average drinkability that took a hit due to the ultra rich flavor and strong sugar notes present... all in all, not a bad brew... A sweet rendition of the style... Worth a try..."
"I couldnt drink more than one.. too sweet.. and 9% is well hidden."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too fizzy and watery, slightly bigger body and slightly less carbonation would go a long way here. Drinkability is moderate. Not a bad beer, i wish it hadn't been so lightstruck, but it still probably wouldn't have been what i was looking for."
"The beer poured a slightly cloudy, light amber color with a thin white head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. It had a wonderful sweet aroma : hops, candy sugar, and earthy. The taste was the unique banana-esque Belgian yeast-induced flavor, with candy sugar and sweet malt in the background - outstanding. The mouthfeel was a bit fizzy, but still a great job in duplicating a true Belgian triple ale."
"Overall, a tasty beer. Not quite what I've come to expect from this style. A bit thin, a bit hot. Still worth picking up from time to time."
"Pours a slight clouded gold. Nose is extremely doughy. Flavor is heavy with dough. There is the sweet tone as well that is not really overly strong. It is bit boisterous and bright, but it is very even and never changes as it progresses. Feel is thick and doughy on the tongue. Overall a pretty good example of a tripel I say. Especially for an American producer."
"A cloudy golden ale with a big foamy white head that settles quickly to a thin cover of bubbles and fair lacing. There is some sediment settling at the bottom. The aroma is a typical wheat/alcohol that I would expect from the style, some sour apple. The flavor is a pretty thick bready and licorice with plenty of alcohol. This just isn't my style. It has a nice medium-heavy body with a slight oily quality with plenty of fine carbonation. But this stuff is just to heavy on the alcohol dominance for my tastes. I lose the other qualities. It's probably more my aversion to the style than to the brewer here but I am not into this. Not at all drinkable, as far as having more than one although the flavor becomes a little more refined as your taste buds try to adjust to the alcohol bashing. Got admit i didn't finish this one and happily popped open a luscious Goose Island IPA to relieve the crippled taste buds, but I expect this will do better with the Triple fans, so I tried to rate it fairly."
"D- Un-complicated enough to be quite quaffible, although ABV would make this practice unwise."
"Mouth hapiness: As a local triple I'm more than happy to stock it for every day tripel tiple"
"Flavor is very spicy. Belgian spices and heavy on the pepper. Alcohol is evident, fruits secondary to heavy spicing. As far as tripels go I enjoy a bit more sweetness, and a bit more reserved with the spices. Still, this is a good tripel."
" High abv limits this as far a sessionability but definitely one to share amongst friends- a good holiday treat."
"Pours very dark for a tripel, really amber with some reddish tinges, and no head. Smells of rich fruits -- apple and pear -- and dark, rich, sweet malts. This doesn't smell like a tripel; it smells more like an English barleywine. On the palate, thick and sweet initially, although some hops do come up toward the mid-palate and stay into the finish. The light sweetness of pale Belgian malts is replaced with thick, graham-and-honey elements more befitting a barleywine than a triple. Overall, this is a poor example of a tripel. It's too dark, too sweet, not bitter enough, and has some odd fruit notes. Style isn't everything of course, but I don't see how you can call this a tripel under any circumstances. Even with no style stated, the flavors involved here do not deserve high marks on their own."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet pale malt scent along with a wonderful Belgian yeast aroma. It's sweet and fruity with just a bit of earthiness. The taste is decent. It has a very sweet pale malt scent along with a really fruity yeast character. There is a hint of earthiness and some warmth as well, but nothing to pronounced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent drinking triple. I've had better, but it's a solid offering nevertheless."
"D: Not a bad tripel, but a bit spicy for me."
"Drinkability: Not the first time I bought it."
"Drinkability- Even the alcoholic bite fades away over the course of the tasting, and there's a lot going on here to compliment. I would love to pair this with Belgian mussels or some other light fare that would let this beer really show its potential."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. This is a great american interpretation of this beer. It is bold and flavorful and is worth trying at least once. Can be enjoyed easily year round."
"D - Not bad, the only thing that would prevent me from drinking many, would be the taste, and effects, of the considerable alcohol."
"Pours a cloudy orange-ish/ yellow color with an off white head. Aromas of candied sugar and malty alcohol. In the taste, sweet malt and alcohol very present. A bitter mouthfeel and a malty and alcoholic aftertaste. A bit sweet for a triple, but ok. Alcohol is not hidden and very present."
"Overall, it's a very smooth triple, with a more subtle alcohol (as compared to Victory's Golden Monkey) and a more clear and concise flavor progression (as compared to Weyerbacher's Merry Monk's, which has a lot of flavor). It probably is on par with the latter brew, and better than the former, at least in terms of local (brewed in PA) Triple's."
"Drinkability for me, is very low. The highreal ABV and that it seems that way, makes this not a sesion beer, if you ask me."
"Drinkability: Decent, but lacks the complexity of Belgian triples and the alcohol character is a bit too potent."
"Pours a hazy pale orange with a thin head that quickly diminishes to a slight ring. The aroma is some sweet malts and spice, but nothing that strong. The taste is about what I've come to expect from most American attempts at the style. a decent spice blend against sweet malts, slight yeast and moderately present alcohol syruppiness. The alcohol gives it a rather heavy body, even for 9%. This is another one I'm glad to have tried, but nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability: I'd have another if I wasn't paying. Drinkable, but I wouldn't opt for it."
"Sorry if this is an ignorant review.... but I'm 125 beers into my ""journey"".... (still a rookie.... I guess...) .... Personally, I can't recommend this beer... maybe I'll give it another try in a couple of years (when my beer tastes have matured....)"
"D - A sweet, big on malt and fresh yeasty beauty. A fuller mouthfeel and spice situation. The great malt flavor and candy sugar complexity alongside the strength are well worth the price of admission. The ability to drink many, though is average since it packs a punch and it is too big to really be considered above average drinkability."
"Pours a hazy, burnt orange color with a thin tan head. Aroma consists of clove, banana, and sugar. Taste begins with a spicy clove flavor, that gives way to sugary malt and banana-like backbone, with a slight yeast presence and alcohol warmth in the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky, with the aftertaste hanging around long after the beer is done. ABV limits drinkability, but still a great winter time beer in my estimation. Belgian fans will dig this!"
"D: not the biggest fan of this beer, mostly just because of the alcohol content though"
"Overall, not bad, but not great either. Unfortunately, it was fairly expensive, so there are better options out there. Personally, I prefer River Horse's Tripel Horse or Weyerbacher's Merry Monks."
"Drinkability - Good triple (love this style) for the price, and very drinkable despite the rather high alcohol content. Well recommended."
"Light mouthfeel,juicy,with some grainyness. The alcohol has the sneak up effect kidda kicks in when you least expect it you know it there just don't realize how much. Has some drinkability needs to have more aroma to be more appealing. Just seems a bit lacking overall for a triple."
"Drinkability: I have to say that this tripel was a little disappointing. I guess that I was hoping to get a good Belgian tripel at a bargain price. For an American tripel, I prefer Golden Monkey, but I haven't tried any of the really highly rated American triples yet. Next stop, Allagash Tripel Reserve."
"This is a great tripel, true to style, delicious and satisfying every step of the way. My favorite Stoudt's offering so far."
"This looked a bit better than average with a very cloudy brown- orange pour. Smell was quite nice with plenty of spice, banana, yeast, cooked fruit, and just a touch of alcohol. Sadly, though, everything was very average. Not bad, just very average. Taste was sweet and malty, cooked fruit toward the finish, and that slightly metallic taste that so many tripels have. Alcohol becomes apparent on the finish, but isn't overpowering. Mouthfeel is same weight and texture as 100's of other tripels. Again, neither offensive nor fantastic. You could do much, much worse I suppose. Still glad I tried this."
"D: Much better domestic tripels out there than this offering. Overall disappointing and something I would not purchase again."
"Poured a fairly cloudy, deep orange color with a smaller white head. The nose has aromas of candied citrus and fruit, and just a little bit of musty yeasty character. Flavor has just a touch of what i think of as the tradional tripel flavor, its got candied fruity flavors mixed in with a big sweet caramelish malt body, some orange, some spice, hint at vanilla. Big mouthfeel, kinda thick almost. Its a good beer, goes down pretty easy with some good flavors, just a touch on the sweet side for my liking, and a bit one sided."
"I plan to stock up on these and tell my friends about them too. They are really potent however, and you shouldn't plan on doing too many physical activities except laying on the couch!"
"I'm surprised and really glad that i had the opportunity to try this one."
"drinkibility-great for the high alcohol content. good example of a Belgian Triple"
"Overall very good. I had this on tap at Stoudt's. It as served in a pint glass. It was a cloudy oragne color with half inch white foamy head. It had a fruity smell and flavor. It was quite tasty and typical for a tripel. Orange/citrus. Medium bodied and good carbonation. Normal drinkability. I could have had another and maybe even another after that."
"Poured a deep orange color with plenty of yeast floating about. The head was disappointing and no lacing was detected. This sample was bottled on 4/27/06. The smell is of candi sugar and Belgian yeast. The taste is similar to the smell with the addition of banana bread notes and a hint of vanilla wafers. There is a bit of an alcohol harshness towards the back end. This ale is well carbonated and moderately bodied, and finishes with a strange bitterness to it, unlike most tripels. This is a drinkable tripel not the best I have had. The first American version I have had."
"Drinkability: While the alcohol is relatively high, it is well masked, not overwhelming, and quite enjoyable."
"Bottle courtesy of Adrian910ss: Poured a medium golden color ale with a small white bubbly head with minimal retention. Aroma of sweet malt with some alcohol. Taste is way too sweet for the style with some warming alcohol which didnt really fit in there. Body was about average with some medium to low carbonation. Overall, I thought this beer was definitely off the style and way too sweet with some burning alcohol."
" Wavz"
" simple triple style."
"This is a very smooth and balanced tripel. The atringent spice flavor found in most of the American brewed tripels is not present here. The malt backbone is prevelant, and balances the drink nicely. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. This is certainly a drinkable beer, but at 9% you'll start to feel it pretty quickly. Stoudt's ale isn't going to quite give true trappist tripels a run for their money, but it is the best American version of the style I've tried."
"Nice...I like it."
"this beer is good but the aroma is off, it has the american ale aroma, when belgian yeasts are way more estery."
"This beer poured a hazy yellowish orange color. Nice clean white head that dissipated rather quick with a mild lace. Smell is very fruity and floral. There a certain hints of banana and caramel in the nose. Some presence of pale malt and a strong dough like yeast scent. Quite a complexity of fruit tones mixed in. Taste is smooth and mild. Lots of banana up front with a mild tone of yeast and a hop mix in the aftertaste. Very dough like, hides the alcohol rather well with no real strong over powering alcohol flavor. Very enjoyable with lots of changing flavors tones of plum and raisin mild caramel and lots of other essence. Maybe some light lemon hints. Quite drinkable but still can take some getting used to the flavor. Not for everyone's pallet. Still packs quite a punch form the ABV."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with some chunky floaties. Produces a thin and quickly vanishing head. No lacing at all. Pleasant, fruity aromas of apricot, pear, green apple are dominant with some notes of spices, malts and banana lingering in the background. Mouthfeel was disappointingly flat and sticky for a Belgian-style Triple. One would expect a much more lively level of carbonation for this style. Flavor was quite authentic to style revealing sweet, ripe fruit, caramel malt, spices and a touch of pepper, lemon juice and a restrained hop bitterness which kept the sugary sweetness in check. An admirable attempt at the style, but if Im in the mood for a Triple Id prefer the real deal from Belgium over this anyday."
"I'm not very schooled on the belguims yet, but i enjoyed this beer and most likely will try it again."
"Sometimes these get a bit to sweet for me to drink a couple, but man they sure evoke alot of unique flavors and are great for sipping. Not to bad overall from Stoudts....solid!"
"got this in a trade a while ago and I dont know who sent it but thanks who ever you are. poured a cloudy tan orange with a small light tan head that didnt last long. aroma sour fruits, spicy, yeast. flavor cantaloupe, which I do not like and wont eat it but I will make the sacrifice and not include that in my rating and finish this beer, got some orange and a nice sweetness which I am glad of because of the aroma being so sour, and a nice alcohol burn, yeast, and some nice spices got the glove and a hint if lemon. not to bad"
"This tripel poured a hazy, reddish amber color with tan foam that settled to a thin coat on the surface of the beer. The smell was malty with a typical but light Belgian tripel aroma. There was a slight sweet tanginess in the smell. The taste was Belgian and malty with quite a pronounced sweetness, almost sugary, and a touch of tanginess. The hops were moderate. The mouthfeel was sweet with medium-full body and modes carbonation. The sweet malty flavor lingered. This was an OK tripel, but a bit overly sweet."
"Props to GnomeKing!"
"Poured this beer into a tumbler at 50 degrees. Beer is certainly an Abbey Beer. Complex yeast'fruity sweet like taste like somekind of flowers. A decent attempt at a Abbey beer I thought. High % will knock you for a loop for sure. Will not buy again though."
"937"
"note: If I hadn't added the rest of the yeast/sludge to this it would have been like this: 3.5, 4.5, 3, 2.5, 2.5, respectively."
"I have really liked the other Stoudt's beers I have tried (Double IPA/Fat Dog Stout) but will have to say that I am a bit dissappointed with this one. Recommended only if curious."
"Drinkability: Tripel may just be my favorite of the traditional Belgian styles. It was delicious, sweet and fragrant but at 9% of course beware. I also cooked shrimp with this and they came out excellent!"
"Pours a burnt orange with a large white head that leaves almost no lacing and disappears quickly. Good color,but the head disappoints. The smell is musty, with alcohol, spices, and candy sugar. The taste is sugar, sweet malt, spices, alcohol, and some bread yeast. A much better taste than smell. The m/f is medium with the flavors mixing well and hides the alcohol pretty well. Not a bad beer, but I hoped for some more hops to balance the taste. Cheers."
"Bottle conditioned ripe auburn copper body. Thick pad of white khaki head. Nose is carrot cake, banana rum, cream soda dum-dum, spicy metallic pepper, and yeast. Singed caramel and sugary malt up front. Slight tang (wheat?). Fruity midsection gives way to warming alcohol esters and peppery hop bitterness. Dry finish. Medium-bodied with a well-carbonated feel."
"D - Not all that bad, just needs a better balance. I like more from my triple than what this provides and a medium body brew."
"Overall, the aroma is pleasant, but the flavor on the follow through is too harsh on the tastebuds and the palate."
"Overall I found it to be a decent tripple, it lacked some general character but overall enjoyable."
"I'm new to Stoudt's beers, but so far they seem like a winner. A fine American example of the Belgian style."
"A solid tripel, with the sharpness at the finish being the main drawback to not scoring it higher. Still, quite drinkable considering the big ABV...."
"The 9% ABV will keep these to a minimum but overall a very delightful american-brewed blegian Triple."
"D: Spicier, pilsner maltiness is a little less featured, but still pretty decent. I'd put it in the Affligem sweeter-Tripel style rather than the drier Chimay/Westmalle. Even then, it's not easy to drink because the alcohol taste is a little more noticeable than I would like."
" Scored and reviewed verbatim from notes."
"pour is a nice golden, hazy color. Unfortunately, there is no head whatsoever! And not much lacing to speak of. Very disappointing. However, the smell is redeeminig - an excellent example of the tripel style: tart, fruity (cherry and apple), and spicey. The taste seems less impressive - if only slightly. It has all the markings of a great tripel - very spicey, cirtus orange, with a pleasant tinge of alcohol - but it is unnecessarily sour at the end, I think. Overall though a solid beer, and very enjoyable sipping. But is it worth the price? Only you can decide..."
"Pours to a hazy copper color with off-white head that lingers through mid-glass, and leaves good lacing. Initial aroma of malt and dark fruits, mostly grapes and figs. Flavor at first is spicy fruit, with malty sweetness. As beer warms at mid-glass, alcohol becomes more evident in both the aroam and the taste. Finish leaves a sweet, syrupy aftertaste, accompanied by an alcohol-induced warming sensation. a good beer for sipping one, but definitely not a session beer."
"Pours a dark brown (a bit darker than i expected) with a thick tannish head. Smell is chock full of spices and alcohol. Taste is similar. I thought the alcohol was hidden very well and it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Fairly malty. Coates the mouth very well. Drinkability is high, especially given the alcohol. My only complaint is that the other tastes didnt really come through as much as i hoped they would. other than that, a pretty good session beer."
"This beer pours a dark golden color with a big head. There is also an interesting swish that goes on when its poured vigorously. The smell is just like a traditional tripel, with lots of spices and the alcohol just peaking through. The taste is similar. Starts out almost like sweet juice because of all the malt, and the alcohol is hidden well. This beer goes down really easy. I would say that this is an ideal brew if you are not used to the strong alcohol taste of normal tripels, but It really doesn't cut it if you are looking for something really special."
"Drinkability: I had a pretty good buzz after just a pint, which I suppose makes sense due to the ABV, but I enjoyed it and I'd sure have it again if I see it on tap. Haven't had it in a bottle yet, though, either."
"This beer poured a dense, amber/copper color with a slight white head that ran away quickly and left a small white ring around the edge and a floating island in the middle. The nose of the beer a bit citrusy and sugary with some yeast notes. The taste is more of the same along with some cherry tones. The mouthfeel is smooth but there is a nice alcohol burn on the tongue at the end."
"Rich buttery ripe plum coupled with a heady dose of alcohol. Some sweet malts present midsip lending this a fairly authentic Belgian feel."
"The high ABV made this beer work for me...I think without the extra alcohol kick, it might have been too sweet, but that balanced it out very well."
"No real head forms but reveals a gorgeous orange-ruby (grapefruit coloured) appearance - very nice looking. A candy-esque bubblegum nose - both sticky and sweet. Aroma spicy and intoxicating, letting it's strength and contents known. Mouthfeel with a light burn and a light peppery note. Very authentic tasting. The burning would come to agree quite well with me, it was short lived but with every sip. This one is potent, what a dense mouthfeel for this style, once again, let's its strength and contents known! A little fruity zest that took some time to show itself, letting this one warm helped compliment it. Thanks to Harry for sharing both his company and his bottle for this sitting..."
"M/D- Definitely has a warming effect, high carbonation, medium bodied...pretty ok overall."
""
"This poured an orangey/amber color with a small white head in my duvel chalice but it quickly fell . THe smell is a quite nice combo of fruits, a whif of banana, and yeast. Wow, what a great Tasting ale and spot on for style. The finish is suprisingly smooth with candi sugar providing a sweet and mellow ending. Good mouthfeel and decent drinkability even though this weighs in at 9%. Where did they hide it???"
"A decent brew but pretty unbalanced and with alchohol presence is a bit rough. Not a bad drink but not by any means the first Tripel i'd reach for"
"Very little head, but otherwise nice appearance, kind of golden-amber and fairly clear. Aroma is awesome, has hints of rose, clover honey, and a wine-like light citrus character. The flavor is very good too, starts kind of dry and acidic with a slight spiciness but it doesnt' finish very dry at all, with hints of candy, golden malt, and cookie-like character along with some more spiciness and a light bitterness. The mouthfeel is light and spritzy, and overall its a pleasant drink that would go well in the deep winter as well as on a hot humid Tennessee day (in moderation, of course)."
"Special thanks goes to Bill N. for buying me this one."
"D - moderate drinkability, kinda oversweet"
"It looks and smells good, hinting at a nice beer. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, like the description says it should be. Taste is pretty good, certainly malty. A bit too sweet for my liking. I get a yeasty taste in this - another mention the book says to look out for. There are flavors here I've never tasted. So I don't know how to describe them. Little to no bitterness to speak of, which raises this in my eyes. Loses something as it warms. Drinkability is average, since I don't see this as a beer you can break out at any given time. Certainly a mood beer. Probably a beer you have one of and then move on to something else."
"The mouthfeel is a little syrup like. Not bad, just a little sticky. It's drinkability is a little lower due to it's ABV, and the fact that you have to stick it in a cellar for a year to get this result. Still a little hot and green when fresh, but much better with a little patience."
"Quite nice! The current version is certainly less yeasty than it used to be; and it seems a little lighter in the flavor with fewer kilned malts. The alcohol could be subdued some as well, but I think that hinders the head retention more than it does the flavor."
"This is a very interesting beer, and I have to say, I've never tasted anything quite like this. The combination of medicinal bitterness, burnt rubber, burnt orange peel, bananas, and roasted wheat husk all contribute to a very odd, but enjoyable brew. As far as triples go, it's far from the style. As far as beer goes...it's pretty damn good. A sipper."
"Caramel colored small head remains. Alcohol, sugar, fruit on the nose. Molasses, sugar, plums?...great taste. Mouthfeel is substantial, syrupy. The taste is very candy-like. Smooth and easy to drink for the high alcohol content. This is a definite sipper that is worth a try."
"A drinkable beer yes but far from a great one. Lots of things about this beer are off for the style. It is a bit too hopped up and dark for the style. The hops are astringent in a beer style not noted for that. Mouthfeel is average at best. I just can't see myself buying this wherever I can get a St. Bernardus Triple."
"Bottle dated 2/18/06: Pours a hazy copper color, looks very much like unfiltered apple juice. Mild carbonation with tons of small particles suspended in the glass (i'm assuming that it's yeast sediment, this being a bottle conditioned ale). The aroma is sweet and fruity, some candi sugar, perhaps? Taste is fruity as well, hints of apple, orange peel and (surprisingly) peach. The alcohol is fairly noticeable on the swallow, not overwhelming but it makes its presence felt enough to take a little off the drinkability factor. Average mouthfeel. Overall, a nice warming sipper, I will be picking up more of this very soon!"
"Pleasant, but not stand-out. When a beer's this big, alcohol-wise, I'm looking for something a bit more special."
"The booziness of this beer in its current state is a put off. Maybe some time in the cellar can fix that. I really liked the nose."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with very little head. It smells a bit fruity. The taste is definitely in line with the style, there's no doubt this is a bottle conditioned trippel, but yet something seems a bit lacking compared to the Belgian trippels I've had. I can't quite put my finger on what's lacking, and actually this beer seems to be growing on me. Definitely worth a try, but I'm still kind of up in the air on what I think about this one. I think I might need a couple more to really decide."
"Beer is good. Happy local tripel beering."
"Drinkable ? Why not ? I'm not driving."
"Big powerful flavors in this one. Very pronounced alcohol, spicy (white pepper, paprika, etc), caramel and molssess in the malt. Nice drying hoppiness inthe finish. Quite sticky mouth though with a bit of alcohol in the aftertaste as well. A sipper for sure but a damn interesting one."
"This was a pretty good triple. At $9 a six, I cannot complain either. Very fruity, nice carbonation, and sweet finish, in true belgian style. Not overly yeasty. Tangerine type texture to it, very drinkable and very high alcohol content. Nothing offensive about this one. I've now had 2 Stoudt's beers and they've both been excellent."
"poured an attractive orange-amber color with only modest white head that quickly fell to a thin ring. Smell is a nice combination of summer fruits, bananas, and yeast. Taste is truly enjoyable with the summer fruitiness and yeast joing together to create a pleasureable drink. Finish is extremely smooth with the candi sugar gining a pleasnt sweet ending. Hard to believe this was 9% alcohol until I checked my spelling in this review. I think its a nice conservative example of this style that gives a goog interpretation without becoming too extreme."
"Pours dark brown, caramel with not much head. Only a smidgen of carbonation. Moderate lacing. They put it in a pint glass for me, though, was a little offended. Nose is rather lacking, raisiny, bready, malty. Taste is also a bit less than I expected. It's good that you don't taste the alcohol, but the rest is all just toned down as well. Sugary fruits (raisins, etc), malts, all proper components there. Balance was a bit off as well. Too sweet and grainy. Overall, I was not so impressed, but I think that it was partially due to the wrong glassware."
"I'd love to taste this tripel next to the Aged White Cheddar @ Hollingsheads Deli in Orange."
"Pours a one-finger cream head, that fades to a ring and leaves no lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Color is a slightly cloudy amber color. Nose alcohol and raisins. Starts sweet, nice raisiny flavor, finish is warming but the high ABV is hardly noticeable. $2.49 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Nice beer. I'm not so big on style guidelines as I am on enjoyment, so maybe I ranked the taste too high. Like the man said, I don't know much about art, but ... This one had to convince me it was worthy, and it did. I'll buy some more if I see it."
"Tripel may just be my favorite of the traditional Belgian styles. I've had several excellent versions lately and have been blown away by their combination of power and complexity. Unfortunately, Stoudt's Triple doesn't measure up. It would have been nice to see what it would have tasted like with a few more years of (hopefully) mellowing rest under its belt. Too bad that I chose to open my one and only bottle today."
"Appears deep bronze honey color thin white head leaves absolutely no lacing down the chalice seems way undercarbonated. Smells very sweet and boozy at this point I was used to trying Stoudt's Triple when it was effervescent and a bit more refined, some heavy tropical fruit soaked in alcohol tones coming through mild touch of hops evident. Tastes vinous deep rich maltiness some evident bitterness lacks dimensions of a great triple style ale seems to be fruity sweet with alcohol and mild hops not enough layers for me have any Belgian tripel over this brew. Texture was syrupy really needs some work in my opinion, I hope this one is better in the twelve oz. bottles. Drinkability for me was a bit cloying low carbonation needs to have some spritziness to it alcohol really came out in the flavor."
"D - I don't know what to think. When I first had this beer, it was delicious, sweet and fragrant. Now it something completely different. A real disappointment. I guess that must have just been a better batch or maybe a lot fresher. But I really don't want another."
"Cheers!"
"An amber colored beer with an off-white colored head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of bananas, tropical fruit, caramel, and alcohol seem to come out. The taste is similar to the smell with a strong sugar presence that is closely followed by a juicy bitterness. Leaves behind a sweet aftertaste that is enjoyable. Yey another excellent beer from Stoudt's!"
"Overall- decent Triple that hides the alcohol up front but it comes back with a vengance, burning the throat! Sweet and not as harsh as you would seem. Decent. Wouldn't turn 1 down, wouldn't seek it out either."
"Mouthfeel is fairly creamy and medium bodied...a bit thicker than I expected but it still flows down fairly smoothly. Overall...a pretty enjoyable tripel..but it just didn't grab me enough to make me want to seek it out again anytime soon. Worth a try."
"A pretty unsuccessful tripel that smells better than it tastes. Flavor wholly overwhelmed by alcohol."
"overall: i think this one deserves to be ranked higher than it is purely on potential. there are complex aromas and flavors in there, but they're just crushed by the alcohol presence. i took this into account and therefore the drinkability took more of a hit. i have a couple more of these to lay down, but i think the alcohol may already be too much. close to being great, though."
"I could definitely deal with more of this."
"Cloudy orange in color with a ok white head that dissipates quickly. No lacing. Spicey clove smell with a hint of banana and alcohol. Spiciness really stands out in the taste with a hint of caramel sweetness. Alcohol comes through farther down the glass. Initially comes across as very complex but as you drink more it becomes kind of one dimensional. An OK beer that is worth a try but not one that i will chase after."
"-UF"
"This is a good beer. I've certainly had better tripels, but this is a pretty good one. It could use more funk, more carbonation, and generally more complexity. Recommended."
"drinkability: easy drinking, as is the norm"
"I'd hesitate getting this on tap again (though I recall enjoying it in the bottle)."
"Bottled on 12/12/04"
"A nice interpretation of this style. Maybe a tad sweet which lends itself to not being so well balanced."
"Carbonation is rather sharp on the sip, but this full-bodied ale really gets nice and creamy. I could drink this a whole lot!!!"
"Mouthfeel is light with a slight carbonation bite. I would prefer a less cloying version, something with more dry balance. A good tripel but lacks the depth to be great; cellaring may improve that."
"mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp yet smooth"
"Most of the characteristics remain, but the alcohol definately calmed over the last four months in my cellar. The alcohol burn is still in the stomach and on the tongue, though not as present on the nose. Will bump taste up 0.5 points as a result."
"Drunkability  Alcoholics and surgeons will appreciate this high-octane barrel of booze, but most aficionados of the style will cry foul. For all those people who say they have to lay off beer for a few days because they have a cold . . . drink this!"
"dark orange pour evoking peach iced tea. bubbles keep on coming up to the surface.. nice! syrupy, no head here. really thick. daunting. blatantly orange nose with candi sugar coating. nice and, well, belgian. sweet to the lips, pleasant alcohol buzz in my sinuses. wow does this pack a punch! malty sweetness and bumblebee floral bouquet. delicious. drinkable and smooth for something that looks like burnt corn syrup. i dont expect much from stoudt's but this is certainly a tripel id come back to."
"Marginal foam in pour. Fruity golden colour a la peche/.apricot. Yeasty fruity aroma. Smooth drink, well balanced. Fruit yeasty taste, but also drying metallic. Light carbonation, some spice and banana. Alcohol kicked in prematurely, but a good sleep on a hot summer night. A good effort."
"This is a mily-orange brew with a modest white head. It presents a yeasty, slightly tart aroma, with a bit of yeast in the background. Theres a little tart, citrusy-reminiscent fruit in the smell as well. Fleeting phenols and a distant funky aroma are also thrown in the mix. Its not a very sweet brew, but instead presents an almost medicinal flavor. Slightly harsh, and notably alcoholic in taste. Its got a nice, heavy body, with a moderate to low carbonation and a solid hop finish. All in all, I really expected more from this brewery. The beers good qualities are not folded into the experience, and the unfavorable ones are too pronounced. I really appreciate the drinkabilty and how the brew is satisfyingly full and smooth. It just doesnt come together as a singularly flavorful and complex beer."
"Finger licking good!"
"I skipped dessert this evening to share mine with my girlfriend as a night cap, along with a few water crackers topped with Saint Andre. Good choice on my part, if I do say so myself."
" A noble attempt at the style, and a drinkable drink, but nothing to jump up and whoop about, really. Keep on trying...needs something more elevating, more ethereal, more unexpected...to really rank as a tripel."
"With considered attention to the pour, a good film of multi-sized bubbles covers the offering and has a medium stick throughout the libation. Hue is deep gold and hazy orange with a not insubstantial amount of continuous action. Tart lemon/lime, coriander, and lemongrass on nose. Cloves and light cinnamon on mouth initially followed by a tinny characteristic that detracts; malt is very full and nice though. Almost a velvetiness to this which makes it more than medium-bodied. Pretty good Belgian-style ale."
"Taste is a horse kicking me in the kidneys. In a good way. Everything from the nose, plus a potent alcohol, esthery near-graininess. Sweet and pungent. Very heavy, thick, fruity. Good consistency and cloys just enough to make you want to drink faster than is advisable. Sticky in the mouth and on the lips. Very very nice. Excellent drink with which to start a night of boozing or to have after dinner, to my taste."
"A sip of this beer brings on many of the tastes of a Tripel  plenty of yeastiness, clove spice, and banana backed up by a weak hop background. The alcohol taste is quite prevalent, and the hop characteristic is simply a background player. This causes a bit of unbalance, but nothing horrible. The mouthfeel is quite nice, a syrupy thickness combined with spot on effervescence."
"12 ouncer sampled w/o any freshness dating to be found. Pours a cloudy orangy light amber, minimal white head and minor lacing left on the glass. Strong nose of alcohol, paint thinner. This one is a fairly nasty brew with overpowering notes of hot alcohol. Heavy thick bodied, not very pleasant stuff. A healthy dose of nutty yeast on the botom of the bottle did add a softer layer to the finish., For a tripel lover this was quite a let down, obviously finer tripels are out there."
"It came served in a Chimay goblet, with a thick, foamy white head that slowly subsided, leaving behind a wispy head in its wake. It had a very sweet nose. It was a clear, light amber liquid without a lot of carbonation in evidence. It had a medium mouthfeel with a very sweet finish. Had I had more time, I would certainly have ordered another."
"EDIT: Now that some of the CO2 has faded, it IS cloying. This triple has moved from ""not bad"" to bad in a hurry. Looks like a dumper. If you are going to try this beer drink it quickly."
"Definately one of the more interesting looking brews I have seen before. It was a cloudy cream color with a white head. The beer was so cloudy, I couldn't see through it. The head was fluffy and white, lasted only a short a while. The taste was a little bit on the hoppy side, when compared to other Triples I've had. It was also a little too strong in the alcohol department. Overall an interesting brew. I'd like to see how this one would do after being set aside for a short while."
"Not all that bad, but this Tripel seems to lack some balance, thus the alcohol is allowed to be the more dominant character. I would have preferred a bit more hop character and dryness, less sweetness, and a sneaking alcohol."
"Poured a nice orange color with a fluffy white head that quickly fell and left some lacing. The smell was of belgian candi sugar, and some spices. The taste was of candy, oranges, spices, and a touch of alcoholic warming and hoppy bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was full bodied and well carbonated. This was a pretty good beer. Lots of flavor and fairly complex, I would have no problem drinking more of this."
"Poured a dark orange color with a puffy, white head. Very striking color. The nose had a wonderful fruity character, full of juicy peach and orange peel citrus with a sweet syrupy undertone. The flavor was tart and flavorful with a nice yeasty baked note coupled with a warming alcohol distinction and a creamsicle finish. Nice zesty mouthfeel. Another big beer from Stoudt's that impressed me."
"Drinkability: I like this example, it seems to have an aire about it that makes it special, and perhaps even different than any other beer out there. It certainly doesn't compare to the Belgians, but it does offer up a nice spin on this classic style of beer. I'd be interested to see how these age, especially with the huge amount of sludge put in to conjure the bottle conditioning. Overall, a pretty nice beer. Very satisfying, as if made for a chill evening. One note: when I poured the 1/2"" I let in the bottle down the sink, it oozed out and was the color of a cappucino. Quite the yeast-beast."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a thin tan head. Leaves little lacing anywhere. On the nose it is initally malts, with fruit background. A tiny trace of hops come through. Quite a sniffer. Tastes fruity as can be, with a very tart, citrus appeal. A little too tart on the finish though, not as well rounded as the 750ml version. Feels too carbonated and light in the mouth. Just an average mouthfeel though, not too bad. Needs to be a bit chewier. When it's all said and done, this is a very solid Tripel. The 750ml version is a little better. As for most of Stoudt's beers, it's a consistent and very good beer. But, again as with all Stoudt's beers, it's nothing unique or spectacular. Try it anyways, you'll probably like it."
"12 oz. bottle. poured out a nice cloudy orange color with a stiff white head. The smell was malty and sweet. The taste was good. Very bready with a banana like taste. Noticeable alcohol in the taste. Hops well balanced. The mouthfeel was rich but not thick and well carbonated. The drinkability was good."
"Smelled of sweet malt and wheat. I would describe the color as a lighter shade of pumpkin which was topped off by a bright white head. Mouthfeel was full-bodied with tight, abrasive bubbles. Taste was complex and spicy with sugary notes of banana, as well as a surpising hop bitterness. Not a very unique interpretation of the style, but a solid representation."
