In fact, I wanted to sip it but I declined because I wanted to see how long the head actually stayed. Aroma is of belgian yeast with the slight candi sugar presence that most Belgian brews have. Very light in color (about 8-10 SRM). Tastes of sweet estery goodness! I get subtle banana, golden raisins, and wheat upon first sip. Following the next few sips I get some port Wine on the palete. As a 10% abv triple, it's the strongest one ever had, however, it's the best overall up to and including the later brews.","Budinetz","Mar 15, 2015"

4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"these guys just crush it for me, one of my favorites, although i see their beer so rarely its always a treat to find one. this is a real heady tripel, foamy as can be in the tulip, bone white several inches on a slightly cloudy blonde straw colored base beer. the nose is sweet like most tripels, but this one for me is more about the yeast. it feels rustic and ancient, summery and different, not so fruity in flavor as other, but not spicy either, its sort of off the spectrum in that regard, which i like a lot, has a mustiness to it as well, which suits the sweeter base beer. maybe some oats in here, there is plenty of body, and i am surprised to learn its so strong, it drinks so much easier than this with its effervescent carbonation and only medium body. a bit of lingering sweetness, but made appealing by its interaction with the yeast flavor as it goes down. so cool to have this one on draft, i need to find more of their stuff. i am not usually a huge tripel guy, but this one ranks.","StonedTrippin","Feb 24, 2015"

However, despite this brew having quite a bit of age on it, the alcohol is well pronounced but integrated fairly decently in this brew. If anything, the warmth of this brew distracts just a bit from the overall ease of drinkability. The last time I had this brew it was from a 750ml that was 17 years old. It was not the best of experiences but this even with its own significant aging was much better. I am curious now about having a bottle as fresh as possible just for the sake of comparison. If you havent had this yet, what are you waiting for? I will need to put this on the to-do list to grab more of these when I see them.","stakem","Feb 26, 2013"

The nose comprises light banana, mild vanilla, wheat, mild booze, and light orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with a good deal more funk and tartness, which actually kinda works here. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, somewhat sticky finish. Overall, a surprisingly tasty tripel, one whose age and ""abnormal"" characteristics somehow haven't had any negative influence on things, but rather seem to have augmented them ever-so-slightly.","TMoney2591","Jan 07, 2013"

The aroma is practically god-like. A complex and intriguing marriage of bitter and sweet. Desirable yeast aroma is present along with caramel, both sweet and sour apples, pear, banana, lemongrass and spices. Taste - velvety and bready Belgian yeast and malt. Tart and tropical fruits, lemony hints. Spicy phenolic characteristics as well as a definite bitter hop presence. Honey, although not nearly as sweet as the aroma may have suggested. This beer really coats the mouth well and the finish is somewhat dry. Some Belgians are borderline cloyingly sweet with no other complexities - not so at all with this masterpiece.

Flavor is like nose with lots of yeast bitterness followed by hop, just a little sweet, good carbonic tang, white wine, apples, pears, hint of funk.

4.42,6.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5," The flavor has a strong yeast tropical fruit taste with a gentle raisin and subtle melon with hint of citrus rind and mild hop bitterness with mild herbal accent. There is a light sweet candy-like edge after the hints of floral hops and mild pineapple from the yeast kicks in. A mellow caramel, date and light dry pepper taste lingers and some alcohol joins the complex flavor profile of this tripel. The amount of dried fruit flavor is pleasant with mild raisiny sweetness and there is hints of honeyed banana. Overall I enjoyed this a lot, not the best Tripel since it has some noticeable alcohol, but plenty of other stuff going on to distract from that, I would gladly drink this anytime. This went very well with my New York Scramble at brunch which had salmon egg and caramelized onion with parisian potatoes.","Slatetank","Jun 20, 2011"

4.83,16.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability and Overall Impression: If you want two words to describe this beer, think “complex” and “balanced.” I found this one dangerously drinkable in that each sip followed naturally and easily after the one before it and the temptation was to sip too rapidly for the 10% ABV. I certainly would be happy to have another (after the effects of the well concealed alcohol wear off a bit). In addition, I’ll be looking out to have this one again. My overall impression of this beer is that it is a first rate tripel that provides an example of what a tripel should and can be. It well deserves its high rankings.","drtth","Apr 17, 2011"

Flavor lets you know the alcohol content upfront as well, a bit boozey and one dimensional semi sweet biscuit malts with spicy herbal Euro hops and spicy bitter yeast notes. Bottled 8/2010 not bad has a little age on it. Again super carbonated version of a tripel I'm used to effervescent CO2 but this is literally hard to take a sip without burping. The bottling condition was a bit out of control from the get go, but as it settles in the glass it becomes much more approachable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied I spoke about the carbonation issues, a linger sweetness overrides each sip as well as a kick of alcohol that doesn't let you forget who you're dealing with one Mad Bitch. Overall impression is that this could be world class tripel if it had more table manners but I don't think De Dolle or the Dulle Teve are ready for that.","WVbeergeek","Apr 09, 2011"

This Belgium Abby Tripel poured a huge foamy head that seemed forever to subsize and a dark copper appearance. The beer gave off a sweet aroma of beligan yeast, hits of citrus and orange peels. Tasted sweet, reminds me of Delirum Tremens, gave off a big peppery bite to it. Mouthability was medium-bodied and had a nice carbonation with a huge head that lingered throughout.

A great aroma of some fruity esters that vary on grape, cherry, plush tropical fruits and a orange/citric twang and maybe pear). Yeast aroma is prevelant as aroma overall is not too boozy and there are some sweet malt and spicy notes in nose as well. A light body with some stickiness yet still flows past the tongue with ease. A beer with a touch of spicy pepper and a little alcohol, there is a somewhat vinous taste of apple, pear, and grapeskin (with possible figs or raisins in the beer). Has a tart edge and is aided by some citric fruit/hop flavors like orange as well as a strong carbonation that prickles the tongue. A sturdy malt base in the backbone of the beer provides balance as some caramel and bread malt peek out. The beer finishes sharp and spicy due to flavorings and carbonation and is just a well-made beer that anyone should sip on.","clayrock81","Dec 27, 2010"

4.38,5.8,4,3.5,5,4,4.5,"D - This is an interesting beer, the yeast character is quite dominant with malt and hops playing small, but vital roles in the overall experience. The aroma is extremely phenolic with some clove, but mostly it is a series of more unusual pepper and spice notes as well as a slightly unpleasant rubbery tinge at the end. The flavor is equally spicy, but with some fruit the lends balance and makes things more interesting. The dominant yeast characteristics here are pepper and mango, which is an oddly excellent combination. It even works beautifully with the flavor of the alcohol as the slight solvent notes of warm fermentation echo the turpentine tang of pepper and mango. Due to the powerful yeast characteristics, the malt is not as noticeable as it is in some examples of the style, but it does help to provide a smooth, bready background for the yeast and hops to act out their roles. Overall this is what I would expect from De Dolle; it is interesting, complex, slightly flawed, and utterly unique. The aroma could be better, but the amazing flavor characteristics more than make up for it, this is a beer that any Belgian ale lover must try.","nickfl","Oct 07, 2010"

It pours a hazy, nearly opaque honey golden with a fairly thick white head. (Be careful when opening, though - the sample I got fizzed like champagne!) Strong, inviting aroma is fruity and a little malty, as well as subtly sweet. Rich flavor is mainly fruity, mostly apple with hints of banana and pear.

Not really the most attractive shade of brownish-orange, but the head on it is great. Classic tripel nose of apples and pears, with orange oil, pepper, clove, and grass. Very pleasant-smelling. Flavor is also very smooth and full, with zero alcohol presence to hinder the enjoyment. Estery up front with pears and candied orange, then a nice caramel/toffee character that takes over until the finish, which is grassy with a modest but welcome bitterness. The body is sublime on this one, perfection. The only complaint here is that it is over-carbonated. A few swirls around the glass immediately reconstitute a nice head while simultaneously getting rid of the excess bubbles. In terms of flavor and aroma this is basically the quintessential tripel. Great beer.","illidurit","Jan 02, 2010"

The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Not much lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is different for a tripel. It has a distinct mead-like aroma. But this beer also has strong spice notes. No alcohol is detected. Has a complex flavor. Hints of honey, cloves, pepper, and faint fruit notes. Sweetness is moderate to high. Alcohol flavor is kept to a minimum but the warmth is there. I was expecting more booze flavor considering the 10% ABV but was pleasantly surprised. The body is a bit on the light side but it is nicely carbonated. Overall it does not hamper the flavor. Considering the high ABV, it goes done very easy, dangerously easy. Glad I only had the one bottle.","morimech","Dec 15, 2009"

Aroma is sweet and fruity, it smells like pears, Belgian yeast, peaches, candy sugar and apples. It tastes like candy sugar, yeast, black pepper, bready malt and apples. The taste isn't quite as fruity as the aroma is, which was a bit surprising to me. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating, and also has very high but soft carbonation. A bit too much carbonation for my liking, anyway. Drinkability is good, but would be better if the carbonation was lowered a bit.

Bitter apples at first, very light sweetness from malt or candy sugar, light Belgian yeast and pear like tartness. Slightly hot at the finish, as to be expected very very dry.

Scents of yeast, light-skinned fruit, candy sugar and a lingering tartness in the back of the sinuses. Some complexity in the mouth. I still can't quite tease out the fruit flavors, but there is a really nice balance between the fruit, spice (clove & coriander), sweetness (candy sugar & honey) and alcohol character. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, warming and pretty smooth considering the head.

The head wouldn't go down fast enough in my eagerness to enjoy this rare jewel for me. Moderate lacing on the glass with a low encapsulating head around the amber brew. Smell is easily the best I've had to date, especially for the tripels, very sweet and very De Dolle, that same distinctive yeast they use in seemingly all of their beer. At a loss for words, intoxicating aroma that makes it hard for me to want to finish the drink. Taste isn't to disappoint. Crisp and sweet with obvious candy sugars.

Fruity and spicy in the nose, with pineapple, peach, apple, citrus and doughy yeast - very nice. Strong flavors - similar to the aroma - with the addition of candy sweetness, red and green apples, and a light dosage of green hops on top of a tingly and dry, almost full body.

Viewed in my new Oerbier tulip glass, the look is reminiscent of some hot apple cider I had in Minnesota one fall. Aroma is slightly spiced, but disappointingly underwhelming. Taste, however, is magical. Taste, at first resiny, evaporates into the tonsils, leaving an apricot and corinander flourish.

Excellent retention and island chain lacing is left behind. Complex aroma is fruity and phenolic, with banana and pineapple fruitiness melding with funky barnyard yeast, caramelized sugars, coriander, and a harsh note of ethanol. Mouthfeel has effervescent carbonation and a silky medium body. Taste is all over the board with considerable complexity. Pineapple, banana, honeydew melon, dank and earthy yeast, bitter Saaz hops, warming alcohol, and burnt toffee. An interesting note of caramel maltiness enters midway through. Finish is resplendent with dry and earthy yeast, bitter hops, and a pleasant accent of fruity pineapple. Mad Bitch, indeed! This is a Tripel that is unashamed in its nakedness.

Huge. Body is golden amber with yellow edges. Head is creamy dirty light tan. Big candy fruit aromas stand out. Sticky-sweet pineapple and sugar overshadow some bitter hops and resins. A little alcohol too, but not medicinal like Stille Nacht. Taste is, not surprisingly, all about the sweet malts. Candy apples and concentrated fruit cocktail syrup overmatch traces of pepper and hop bitterness. Thick, full mouthfeel that borders on too syrupy. Warming, alocoholic finish that luckily avoids being robitussin-like and cloying. I guess I prefer tripels that aren't so sweet, so this isn't my favorite.

Lots of grassy hop flavor, backed by a very sweet maltiness, somewhat bicuity. The finish is loaded with bittering hops, and dries up the mouth nicely.

Very creamy, spongy mouthfeel with usual De Dolle medium-high carbonation. Warming dry and slightly alcoholic finish.

4.72,14,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"It is common at my local beer store to find, with some digging, older bottles with lower prices from days gone by stuck in back of the newer product. This comes in handy if you are looking for an aged bottle, or just a lower price. Digging into the very back of the Dulle Teve row in the cooler I happened across a partially moldy bottle that was $2 less than the front ones...bingo. Had it been there for months...years? No dates on the bottle. After cleaning some black crud from around the cap, I poured the nectar inside into my Duvel tulip. The beer was a hazed/cloudy vibrant golden-yellow-orange color, and was topped by a billowing tower of off-white head, which slowly settled down into a nice hilly blanket form. The nose was wonderful, with notes of fresh sweet/tart granny smith apples, intermingled with aromas of pineapple, citrus zest, stalks of lemongrass, and ancient mustiness. This was liberally accented with smooth coriander and a spicy hops. The moldy exterior was not detrimental to its taste either. I experienced potent honey/mead-like malts that warmed the throat while releasing excellent gewurtztraminner-grape flavors and notes of pineapple and cinnamon-clove-musty spices. The finish presented a nice pop of spiced dessert wine flavors and an excellent spicy bitter hoppiness. Alcohol was evident here but it melded perfectly with the flavors throughout. The body was creamy, smooth, silky, and a bit fluffy...working extremely well for the flavors and character of the beer. This tripel was a vibrant, delicous, and masterfully balanced flavor monster. This mad bitch is quite loveable, despite being a little unattractive on the outside!","HiroProtagonist","Sep 30, 2004"

Has fine suspended particles and cottony lacing. Nose is of wheat bread, lightly sweet malt, yeast, and only faint citrus and esters. Flavor is less citrusy than other tripels but quite tasty. Grainy malts lead here followed by some medium acidity in the finish and very late bitterness. Some orange flavor does come through after a few ounces. Nice stuff.","Doppel07","Sep 09, 2004"
3.98,-3.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"75 cl capped bottle. No freshness dating and the bottle seems to be rather old because the cap and underside lip have some powdery mildew on it. The bottle didn't seem as full as other 75 centiliters, so I think excessive carbonation in storage forced some out, hence the mildew. Opened with a loud hiss, so it seems we're good to go. Pours a clouded golden yellow with a frothy, soapy light beige head leaving some tattered lacing. Sharp apple, malty, musty, honeysuckle and spicy aromas. Pungent alcohol warmth, orange citrus esters, cidery and malty and phenolically spicy at the same time, hops are there, too. Extremely bitter and dry finish after having a nice orangy, nutty, malty sweetness in the start. Good tasting tripel; my lord it's strong. I think I just felt the Mad Bitch pimp-slap me and demanded to know where her money's at. I think I got a bottle that had been jarred around too much during transport. The carbonation was fair, not explosive like I've noticed in other reviews. This only affected the mouthfeel, because a higher carbonation level would have cut the solvent-like alcohol burn a little better. I'll just have to be more careful in inspecting bottles before purchase in the future...","crookedhalo","Sep 08, 2004"
4.26,2.9,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Immense multi-layered head with frothy, large bubbles at the base and fine meringue top. Lasted for ever, leaving beautiful lacing behind. Throughout my sampling this beer retained a small head. First nose was of floral hoppiness followed by hints of apricot and spice. Initial sip reveals...apricot, sweetness, some acidity followed by a wonderful warmness. Overtime I picked up spice, perhaps clove, white pepper? I also noticed a fleeting smokiness. A fairly thick, viscous beer helped to feal lighter by the the consistent presence of fine carbonation. Finish was long with a pronounced hop. As tripels go very decent, however, in my opinion the alcohol seemed a bit out of balance.","thadkaster","Aug 31, 2004"

A very carbonated beer, it takes about 10 minutes just to pour the entire bottle. There is lots and lots of lace chunks left on the glass. The smell is sweet and fruity, with granny smith apples and lemon coming through. A little bit of spices linger. I'm waiting for the head to die down enough for me to get to the sweet liquid. Wait for it, wait for it. Ok, we're there. The taste is good and malty, with lots of fruity sweetness. Some citrus, like lime, but also some white grape. Not many hops in sight. Ends with a slight alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and heavy. The drinkability is pretty good for a 10% brew as well. A nice tripel.","SheepNutz","Jul 10, 2004"

The head died down a bit, but still stayed with me as I enjoyed this beer. I found the aroma spicey but muted, which I liked. Taste is also a bit spicey, with top citrus notes. I thought the beer had great full mouthfeel, with some slight bitterness in the finish. A well-made, very good example of the style. I new it was a big beer, and it hid that almost perfectly.

4.47,8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"With a name like the mad bitch this beer had certainly better produce some results. The beer pours a hazy orange-gold color, and produces a prodigious white head. There is a lightly dusty, herbal, floral, and grassy aroma to this beer. It is sharp and herbal in taste, and is very well carbonated. It is lightly sweet with notes of honey and spices. It is almost spicy hot in character, quite interesting actually. This beer is definitely musty in character, it is like it has been lightly dusted with some pollen from a slightly astringent, yet floral flower. It is slightly lemony in character, with a hint of apple to it as well. The beer gets a bit sweeter as the copious amounts of carbonation starts to dissappear. There is also a nuttiness here in the middle of the beer, which adds to the complexity. I really like the interplay between the spiciness and the fruity sweetness, a very good balance that melds into an incredible beer.","Gueuzedude","Feb 09, 2004"

I love de dolle yeast flavors, bright, thick & nutty. This beer tasted well balanced between the elements, good carbonation throughout. Elements of bread, spice, nuts, banana, pear, apple, clementine. All together another quality offering. I truly believe de dolle beers are great for introducing non BAs to flavorful origianl beers that do not overwhelm with overpowering oddball flavors. This beer does so as well","counselor","Jan 23, 2004"
4.38,5.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served from a 750 ml green bottle with a cap and cork. This is the first time I've had a de Dolle beer from anything other than an 11.2 oz bottle. Thank god I had more than twice that amount to enjoy. The head was an absolutely huge, craggy white beast. It settled a bit but still looked like foam on a storm-ravaged sea. The smell is a bit alcholic, with lots of peppery spice and substantial tartness. Much is happening in the taste: spice, barnyard funk, grape, and cherry. It was a bit reminiscent of a nice Grappa. Despite a somewhat alcoholic blast in the smell, it's well-hidden in the taste, making it dangerously drinkable. Another winner from de Dolle.","mickeymac","Jan 18, 2004"

Earthy aroma of yeast, sweet malted grain, hints of pineapple, and a marvelous beer to sniff, start is ambrosial and thickly malted, top is fair to middling in feel. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hop powerful but pleasant in their spiciness, very dry and long lasting aftertaste with the 10 percent ABV, applying a bit of Belly Warming, a fine beer from a fine brewery, and one I see rarely for some reason.","Gusler","Dec 28, 2003"
4.02,-2.9,4,4.5,4,3,4,"The highly charged fizz sound from popping the cap leads me to beleive this one's got some carbonation going. It pours out a murky looking golden orange tone. A huge, uniformly bubbled ivory white head graces the surface. It becomes rocky as it dissipates. Retetention is phenomenal. Aroma is yeasty and bready, fruity and alcoholic. And very much like cookie dough. Really a nice aroma. The mouthfeel is quite charged, but not so much I can't enjoy this nice Belgian beer. Body seems to be fairly light. The flavor is quite doughy. A little like rumcake. Yeastiness plays a big part in the overall flavor profile. Some fruity esters float about as well. Flavor has some nice spiciness to it as well. Pepper, nutmeg and cinamon.

There should've been, the way the cork exploded off. It had an aroma of citrus, clove and other spices.

4.1,-1,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Bottle was a gusher!  Had to wait a few minutes before I was able to pour.  Hazy dark golden hue, w/ flowing currents of yeast.  The aggressive bubbling helps support a mountainous and overly thick head.  Candy sweetness combined with brash peppery hot alcohol hit the nose at first, then are ensued by ripe kiwi - like tropical fruitiness and light clove phenol.  Light yeast must is perceptible at the end of the aroma. As the beer breathes, alcohol notes fade, and the aroma takes on a florally sweet character.   An initial snap of honey sweetness in flavor is ensued by pleasant herbal melange of rosemary, star anise and clove, then a drying breadiness that offsets sweetness emerges mid palate. Now unhindered, peppery, lightly solvent like alcohol asserts itself into the flavor profile.  Once the initially furious carbonation mellows, the body is revealed to be moderate, w/ a dextrinous mouthfeel.  Black licorice surfaces towards the end of the taste and lingers into the finish, which is dry, heaty, lightly sweet and eeriely akin to the Italian liquor Uzo.  Wow.  Mad Bitch is so flavorful she almost overwhelmed my taste buds.  The alcohol flavors aren't masked and let you know that this a brew to be reckoned with.  Like other Dolle bros brews, this is a stylistic bastard, and is reminescent of a tripel on steroids. It's not at all like a Belgian Dark Strong.","marc77","Sep 07, 2002"
