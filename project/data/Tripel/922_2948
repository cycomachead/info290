Pours a cloudy, caramel orange with a massive coarse white head that dissipated quickly to a more persistant thick cap with great lacing. A bit of a gusher, lost a quarter of the bottle, but managed to save most of this nectar. Great aroma of bready malt, Belgian yeast and spicing and nicely balanced light and stone fruit. Flavor follows with excellent mixed light and stone fruit, bready malt, nice strain of Belgian yeast, clove and coriander. Flavor reserved but nearly perfect. Medium bodied with active carbonation. A classic Belgian ale, leaning more towards a dubbel than a tripel, but just what it claims to be, a Belgian blond ale. After a week of some pretty big ales, its nice to return to something a bit reserved but beautifully balanced and flavorful. An excellent Trappist ale deserving its reputation.","LiquidAmber","May 15, 2014"

It's carbonation level aids in the drinkability of such a sweet beer but, it's also the cause of the beer exploding all over the place, and it's not the first time it's happened to me.

4.29,5.7,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy light orange with a two finger white head. It looks fantastic, a good tripel in appearance. Scents of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, moscato wine, apple juice, slight honey, slight spice, caramel sweetness, and very faint hints of bubblegum. A very Trappist aroma, quite sweet, yeasty, fruity and deep with faint spice. Quite nice, excellent, enticing and complex. Flavor follows the aroma, quite sweet upfront, with hints of moscato wine, apricot, slight citrus peel bitterness and sour tang especially in the middle, candi sugar, some hints of Belgian yeast, and spices, some very faint alcohol, and some graininess on the finish. The finish is also quite dry. Very nice combination of flavors, on style for a tripel, which is certainly what this beer is. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Quite on style for a tripel, yet again. Overall this is a very good tripel, one of the better ones I've had. I recommend getting a bottle and giving it a try. It's got an excellent and complex aroma, and a nice taste that melds with a very nice mouthfeel. It's not the best Trappist, but it is one of the better beers I've had.","Auraan","Nov 03, 2013"

3.8,-6.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"330 ml brown bottle, at home. Poured into a tulip glass. I have this bottle for almost one year in my cellar. ABV 8%. Slighty hazy, deep orange colour. On top, two fingers of snow white, sopay head, very good retention. Leaves light lacing around the glass. Aroma was all malts when I opened the bottle, now that it sits in the glass, aroma is fruity, a bit yeasty, some notes of the alcohol too. Very nice flavour, very complex as well. Quite bitter, even from the beginning. Again, lots of fruity notes, a bit of malts. Aftertaste is sharply bitter. Alcohol very well hidden.Great. Full body, a biting carbonation, but only for a second.Quite dry on the palate. Overall, a very good belgian strong ale, the amount of bitterness surprised me on this one.

Immediately upon opening the bottle it made a slight hiss then filled the air with the scent of apples. The smell changed slightly in the pour openingup notes of caramel, toffee, honey, smells as if it's going to have a very big thick flavor. Taste starts with a light bread flavor then tastes like there's mixed fruit jam on th bread- apple, raisin, plum, peach with sweet toffee candy on the end of the taste.slight alcohol aftertaste with sugars and candy lingering. The toffee caramel and sugar influence is heightened actually when the sediment is poured. It's an amber orange-brown color with bubbles rising from the bottom towards a thick head that starts 3 fingers and lowers while sipping but never goes away. More toffee and sugar flavor in the head- more bread and fruit jam taste in the liquid. An excellent drink- though I hear some people prefer a young bottle o this.

Aromas of pear, pepper, apple, herbal, clove, banana, bread, candi sugar, grass, earth, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of apple, pear, banana, clove, pepper, bread, earth, grass, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying flavors at all, very crisp. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly slick and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent tripel! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on.

I typically use a tulip or balloon shaped goblet for beer like this, and don't usually see a ton of lacing... but this glass, which has sides that are more vertical seems to allow for much more lacing to occur...

Fortunately, the taste is WAY better. I get fruit, caramel, sugar, spices, and burned toast in the taste. Much better than the nose.

Some minor malt as well. Great tasting with some spicy pepper like qualities up front followed by a yeast-grainy feel and some very light fruit (lemon peel) at the end of the sip. Slightly sour. Big carbonation and dries very quickly in the mouth. Overall I feel this is a very nice Tripel and obviously as authentic as it can get. Not as fruity or sweet as other Tripels which is a nice change. Not sure I could do more than a small bottle though as it does numb the tastebuds after a while.","kaseydad","May 15, 2011"

Random spotting of lacing on the glass as the head settles too. Smells of Belgian yeast, spices, mild fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is very yeast forward with spices, lemongrass/citrus, and some malt on the finish. Slightly bitter citrus zest flavors on the palate after each sip.

4.04,-0.5,5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Clear, golden body is highly effervescent, literally boiling from the streams of upraising bubbles, topped by ever-lasting rocky white head that gets dimply and clumpy as it slowly retreats, leaving thick patches of lace hanging on the walls. The head never fades off completely and sets to a thick, firm cover instead. Aroma is prominent orange-like esters and clove-like, mildly spicy phenols, light pils-malt sweetness and a tinge of alcohol. The medium-light bodied beer is airy on the palate although the high alcohol content adds creamy sensation. Flavor is an interplay of spicy, peppery phenols with esters of orange. High carbonation, attenuation and bitterness that seems more phenol rather than hop-derived lend dry finish with lingering yeasty, spicy aftertaste. A nearly flawless triple without any alcohol warmth, as it should be. (330 ml, BB date reads 20.

Fruit and spice is there too, golden raisins and peppery cloves. The first thing you notice when tasting the beer is the mouthfeel. It's a contradiction. It's at once effervescent yet creamy, light yet heavy. Really incredible. The actual taste is a flavor explosion, with just a ton of different things going on. The light sourness carries over to the taste, with some sour apple notes that belie a sweet orange marmalade finish. In the middle there's a really nice light caramel sweetness going on, helping to cleverly mask the high ABV.

Aroma is similar in a way to the bavarian weiss with the banana and clove, but different - lot's of malt, yeast, honey, a little hop, and white wine. Flavor is much the same with good interplay between bitter and sweet. Satsifying. Good for a few sips and perhaps, a couple of quaffs before returning to sipping. Great finish too.

While being neither as colourfully estery nor as profoundly malty as some other Tripel ales, I like this one for its (almost) pure integrity, an achievement made possible by people (the monks!) who really know their stuff and proudly keep the long tradition.

Taste is grainy, earthy, hints of honey, and slightly sweet almost cake batter-like middle and endlessly dry on the finish. Very aggressive carbonation scrubs the tongue. This one needs to mellow out a bit on the table before I continue on with it. Yeah, the carbonation has gone down a bit but it doesn't do anything to help the mouthfeel.

A lot of bready, doughy yeast is also predominant, along with a light spiciness. Slightly tangy upon first tasting thanks to the yeast, with sweet fruitiness playing against spiciness. Very bready, somewhat reminiscent of a Chimay brew. Some bitterness comes along toward the end to make this one quite refreshing. I do remember more hop presence from the bottles I've had in Belgium, but this one has crossed an ocean and sat for a full year, so it's easy to understand.

Aroma reveals yeasty spice, green apple skin, hint of mango, and some leafy green hop. Taste is largely fruity...mostly a pear flavor, shadowed by a metallic finish. Light in body, and pretty drinkable for a Tripel. While this might be the smallest of the Trappist breweries, I cannot say that it is the best, or put as much faith in to it as my friends in Western Massachusetts. Sorry, but I have a feeling they are playing a favorite game based on image as opposed to quality of product. This, along with their Dubbel are great beers, but aren't nearly as good as some of the other Trappist examples IMO.

There were no yeasty bits which is a plus. The smell is very, very appealing. Candied sugars, coriander, apple, banana, all the typical Belgian smells. If you like Belgian ales, the smell will entice. The taste is slightly disappointing in that I had really high expectations. This is a medium bodied beer, less syrupy, fewer candied sugars, not as much banana as I would have liked. You'll get some peppery spiciness and more alcohol notes that I care for.

Not enormously complex, but I don't think the style is meant to be. A beer of this quality could age quietly and gracefully for years, mellowing even further.

Smells up front of light fruit esters pears, apple, maybe even kiwi, no banana or fruits from warmer fermentation ( this is my guess any how). I also get a little spice, maybe some white pepper, yeast is in there, hops are minimal needless to say great aromatic balance. Taste is crisp and refreshing with just enough carbonation to make it move, but not get annoying. Begins with a slight sweet spiced character, then a into a dry finish. This is very complex and subtle at the say time. All of the fruit esters are apparent in the taste and manifest in a great way. This beer is great to drink alone, but would also be wonderful with food maybe some cheese and crackers or a fish soup, or fish period, even meat and potatoes.

Emphasizes musty earth, yeast, caramel, and hops rather than overt fruit. Tastes earthy and yeasty, with rough hops, a bit of bitter lemon funk and alcohol bite in the finish.

On the palate, Achel Blond is familiar and comforting. Slight tart sweetness starts things off, followed by some citric acidity laid over a wonderful bready malt character.

The subsequent lacing was disorganized, pocked, but prevalent. The nose was rather lively with tart and funky, citrusy lemon grass upfront. Then a note of distant pepper, cloves, and a good amount of herbs can be found in the middle, the finish shows the alcohol and yeast. I like the potency but the aromas dont really mix that well, each seemed a little too naked. I feared the palate would be harsh, it wasnt, I mean, wow, this is like night and day! The palate is soft and well rounded; yes there is a raw alcohol burn at the end but the medley of apples, pears, citrus fruits, hay, grass, cloves, dates, earthiness, bready maltiness and yeast really propel the flavors in a tasty direction. It manages to be complex yet kind of straightforward, does that make sense? So what, it does to me. The taste is enjoyable but I dont think this is an outstanding Triple. Medium in body with low and natural carbonation, kind of airy, Id say the mouthfeel is quite agreeable. I found this to be plenty quaffable but I wont go out of my way for more.

Chunks of yeast obscure any sight of bubbles. Leaves nice chains of Belgian lacing all over the goblet. Aroma is typical Belgian, with pink grapefruit and baked bread in the spotlight. Cloves and allspice also share top billing. Mouthfeel is thick, almost chewy, and is tart and bitter. Hops make more than a cameo appearance. Taste is complex, with biscuity yeast, sharp citrus, and bitter hops. Not what I was looking for in a Tripel. The yeast chunks settle to the bottom at room temperature, but the taste remains bitter.

Sweet sugar, yeast, coriander, orange zest, caramel and alcohol are all quite separate and distinct.

And there's barely a trace of alcohol in the flavor. Breadcake. Yeast. Dough. Pepper. All blend quite nicely. The mouthfeel is very attractive. Smooth and velvety. Easy drinking. I could view this as a session beer. It's that easy to drink. The only problem is that a session of 14 of these would cost me close to $100. No thanks.

The aromas that came from the glass were of spicy yeast, bread, citrus, sweet malt, bananas coriander and cloves. Fairly sweet in the nose and it was soft in nature. As for taste, I experienced flavors of sweet malt, honey, spices (cloves), yeast, fruits (banana, citrus), bread, slight bitter hop and a small hint of alcohol. It finished on the dry side. Nice blend of spicy/sweet and dry flavors. Body was on the creamy medium side.
