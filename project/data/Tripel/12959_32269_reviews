"From tasting notes. Perfumy, flowery, peach, fruit, citrus nose. Pours brilliant deep amber under a 3” finely bubbled persistent foam cap that leaves thick lace. Yeast driven fruity palate – large pitted fruits with touches of citrus on a light malt backbone with a hop accent on the finish.  A hint of cardamom and herbs. Medium body and medium to medium low carbonation."

"From bottle at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Not the best triple I've had but not bad. I'm a big Belgian fan & this lacks the balance to the sweet side that I anticipated. I'd like to find it on tap to be sure."

"Quit enjoyable tripel. The 10% alcohol was barely evident. This is a well done hop forward beer that went down a little too easy."

"Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Has a somewhat boozy aftertaste. Not made as well as I would have hoped for, but I'm glad I had a chance to try this."

"Overall this is a well made beer, but this isn't the ultimate tripel for myself. Wouldn't turn this down though for a second, and its an interesting take on the style."
"O: This is not your typical type of tripel and is quite interesting as it has some hop aromas and flavors that you would expect to find in an IPA (but without any bitterness)."
""
"A lil bland for such a big beer but incredible deniability at its strength. Tastes a bit old like some of the flavors are faded but the beer itself is very smooth.I could be wrong though. Initial sweetness along with a bit of spiciness. Dry finish with a very mellow alcohol bite. Reminds me of golden monkey a bit in its simplicity but it's dangerous drinkability . On that note though I do like it better as there's a bit more balance rather than the super dry after taste that golden monkey has. This beer leaves a faint belgian like sweetness lingering in the mouth reminding you of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really solid Tripel and one of the best from a USA brewery. Definitely worth a try if you find it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Like bitting into a tangerine skin and all dusted with some spice. A good Belgian Triple hit all the notes for style, which in BJCP doesn't say you have to use Continental hops."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is nice but perhaps not traditional- lighter mouthfeel (medium light), moderate carbonation, not any resin but an earthy feel. This tripel is out of the ordinary but they do specify that it's an ""American Tripel"" and not trying to imitate the Belgian tradition. A lovely beer, nothing wonderfully sophisticated except how hidden the alcohol is, but very nice to drink."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice complex Tripel with great balance."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Tripel Karmeliet oversized tulip glass, a clear golden color with a full 3-4 fingers of frothy white head, that sank to a thick layer within a few minutes, leaving sheets of lacing on the glass; lively carbonation. Flowery aroma, sweet corn, toasted grains. Taste reflects the aroma, sweet, pale malts, corn, toasted biscuits, stone fruits, herb; notes of chlorine as it warmed. Crisp, clean mouthfeel, quite drying, light-medium body, quite drinkable, but a bit hard to finish. Keep on ice, or share it with a friend!"
""
"Overall, quite good. An interesting beer. I find it a bit hard to call it a tripel, really, since it is so hop focused (at least my bottle is). Still tasty."
""
""
"Overall- I dont know if they are the first to do this, but its my first american tripel and the Captain does it again. I seriously love everything I've had from them except liquid gold. First tripel I could say I really liked, almost loved"
""
"The taste is exquisitely hoppy with a clean, lingering sweetness followed by an extended, dry bitterness. Towards the end of drinking, and after most of the beer's incredible carbonation has burned off, a lot more of the malt comes forward...but the alcohol will still melt your eyebrows off. I'm pleasantly surprised by how this beer drinks and it's definitely a tasty tripel."
""
""
"O-The problem is that spices starts to dominate and the hops are not really there for this American version."
""
"Overall: Usually with tripels you expect the apples, pears, and Belgian candy. This is insanely hopped and you seem to miss out on the characteristics due to the hops, but they are all still there."
""
"Overall: I like this beer quite a lot. It's not a traditional tripel by any means, but I am really cottoning to it. I just wish it were more readily available in my area."
"This one was a gusher upon opening. Pours a cloudy golden hue with a huge white head. The nose is spicy with hints of hops and light bready malt. The first sit is excellent. The hops really yield themselves nicely to the backbone tripel flavors. Overall this is a very tasty interpretation of a tripel and drinks very easy for a 10% beer. Recommended for a hot summer day."
"O: Wasn't too impressed by this one, perhaps it was past its prime but it was not a good representation of the Tripel style"
""
"The rest of the experience with the Xtra Gold was great! Very flavorful, complex, and delicious! The best Captain Lawrence brew I've had yet!"
"EXPLOSIVE!!!! Cracked the crown on this and nearly half the bottle came flooding out all over the counter. Brutally either overcarbonated or infected. Anyway, after about five minutes of letting this one air out, I poured a half glass - lovely golden with a fine white foam atop. Slightly herbal hops, some nice sourish tones (nearly tart apple with hint of lime). Tastes like a tripel with refined tones of yeast and a really pleasant lees creaminess. medium bodied with lighter carb now. Nice beer. Wish it wasn't a brutal gusher."
""
"O: This beer really impressed me. An American Tripel?!?! Would have never guessed...but I LOVE the confidence!"
"Complex taste, quite good."
""
""
"O: Not a fan of funky beers and I drainpoured it. Really a bummer because it seemed like it was going to be halfway decent. If you like funky beers you will probably love it."
""
"Pretty good Tripel in the American style. I hadn’t had one of these in a while and this was one of my gateway styles. Very nice to see it still alive. (4.0)"
""

"O: Possible bad bottle? Don't know, but it's not as if this beer was bad - it was certainly drinkable - but it's not as if it was all that great either."
"Impressively constructed and complex Tripel which I would definitely buy again if the opportunity presented."
"750 ml bottle into chalice, no bottle date. Violent gusher upon opening, but I did not lose very much of the beer. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice fluffy 2 finger off white head with fantastic retention and reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some decent lacing clings to the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge lemon zest, clove, orange zest, pear, pepper, grass, light biscuit, and yeast spices. Damn nice big citrus forward aromas. Taste of big lemon zest, pear, pineapple, apricot, orange, pepper, clove, grass, biscuit, tart grain, and spicy yeast. Lingering notes of citrus, pepper, pear, yeast spices, tart grain, and clove on the finish for a while. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that drinks pretty easily for being 10%. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden; with hardly any warming on the finish noticed. Overall this is definitely an excellent Tripel; with big fruitiness and nice flavor balance."
"D: This is an excellent example of a beer that respects its Belgian roots while adding a unique American interpretation. It's dangerously easy to drink considering the ABV and the flavors will keep you coming back for more. Highly recommended despite the relatively high price-point."
""
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this tripel. There are definite true Belgian tripel characteristics in this beer but the bitterness and light fruitiness is very American. An interesting take from a brewery I am really enjoying."
"D - An exceptional Tripel all the way around... Not my favorite for the style, but quite remarkable none the less... I would gladly purchase another and can recommend with a clear conscience to my fellow BAs..."
""
""
"D - This is an unusually nice example of the style especially coming from an American brewery. The yeast character is as complex and appropriate as any Belgian brewed Tripel with plenty of thick malt to back it up. It is sufficiently dry to keep it drinkable and there is just a touch of herbal hop character in the background to balance things."

"O: I totally wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was. To date, the best damn Tripel I've ever tasted... seriously."
"Highly impressed, another quality brew by Capt Lawrence."
"Drinkability – I didn’t read anything saying this beer has any brett, but there is a definite phenolic funk that screams brettanomyces. Nice malty notes of honey and fruit. Finish is perfect with a balance of spice, funk, and sweet."
"O: I really liked this beer but wish its flavors had a little more cohesiveness. I think that this beer can really improve with some tweaking of the hops to go a little less citrusy and more floral and to dial down the phenolic, medicinal components. Still, good job Captain Lawrence. Both this and the Reserve IIPA were damn fine brews."
"O: Very enjoyable take on the tripel. In some ways, there was a resemblance to Sofie from Goose island which is probably why I enjoyed this so much. 4.0."
"Pouring a clear golden color with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing, this is a good looking tripel. The nose is quite excellent. Moderately hoppy with some fruity aromatics, I also get some honey, plenty of fruit character from the yeast and a touch of bread. The hops lend a bitterness, while the yeast adds a fresh blend of apples, pears and stone fruit. The palate opens fresh and fruity, with all pears and peaches making this seem bright and vibrant. A bready, mildly straw-like malt character is present, along with a noticeable honey character. Towards the end of my pour, I get a little more of the phenolic character from the yeast. Drying and mildly bitter on the finish with a touch of alcohol, this beer is medium-light in body, with a soft, smooth carbonation. Much better than the barrel aged variant, this is a very good tripel."
"O- I'm not a gigantic fan of Tripels to begin with. Not a bad beer by any means but im not too interested in the style"
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. I love the hop flavor balanced with all the traditional aspects of a tripel. I would definitely get this again and recommend this to others."
"O - Interesting beer, and interesting take on this style. I like a lot of CL beers, this one isn't bad."
"This pours a brilliant golden color and a bit of swirling and good pour releases amazing smells of what i believe to be a huge amarillo dry hop. The first sip of this beer is amazing as it is like a very hoppy belgian trippel and pretty much kicks you in the mouth between the hops and the booze. This is another wonderful beer from captain lawrence."
"The draft version is as good or better. One of my favorite Captain Lawrence offerings. The brewery is one of the best on the east coast and very adept and both American and Belgian styles. I highly recommend this beer."
"Pours a pale gold, unfiltered several fingers of bright white head. Webbed lacing is left behind and retains its head nicely. Nose has a variety of fruits with nice hopping and a real American feel to it; pear, pineapple, apricot and some slight grassy notes. A bit of yeast and light spicing - probably more of a 4.25, but I'll give this one the benefit of the doubt. Taste is dry initially, mild grassiness and lighter fruit notes as per the nose, solid hop character. More pear and apricot, with a dry and spicy finish. Mild alcohol in the finish. Medium high carbonation, and good drinkability. Interesting and a nice Americanization of the style."
"D- I can't believe that I am going crazy about another brew from Captain Lawrence! Xtra Gold is so delicious and drinkable as well. They need to get to Syracuse ASAP!!!"
"I've had this many times at the brewery...it's a staple at tasting room times, but I decided to review it while I enjoy the bomber I just opened. Been cleaning my house all day, took a break to quench my thirst, and wouldn't you know it...this bottle was peeking up at me from the lower shelf on the fridge door. Big, pure white fluffy head on the pour. It was a little too cold, so it was HUGE. Let it settle, but it's hangin' on. Citrus, hops and booze on the nose...but the fruity component is making my mouth water. Taste is just like the smell. Fruit all the way through, but citrus up front and hops to finish. Nice clean smooth burn of alcohol. This is a fine beer. Captain Lawrence is my friend. Now, back to cleaning...."
"Overall Grade; B+/A-"
"Overall a well made beer. Great style fusion. I wish I had access to this,if I did it would be in my fridge alot. Complex enough to make you want to sip But refreshing and tasty enough to want to down a whole glass. Great beer"
"750ml bottle: This one pours a clear, straw yellow/golden color. There was a HUGE frothy white head on it that last a while and leaves some lacing. This one has a nice nose to it. Bready and yeasty up front. Some spices and fruits coming through also (lemon and pineapple). Nice silky feel on the tongue. There is a nice balance between the bitterness of the hops and the sweetness of the malts. Bready, yeasty, hint of pineapple and lemon to go with some spices. Drinks real easy. A nice tripel!"
"I'm not sure this is an entirely successfull marriage of styles, as I'm left prefering an IPA or a Tripel on their own merits - none the less, it is a tasty hybrid if you can put expectations out of your mind (particularly if you are a hop-head who can enjoy Belgian styles - though perhaps less so if you are the other-way-around)."
"D: Pretty drinkable for the style for me, as tripels aren't always my favorite. Not too sweet and approachable hop profile. Nice."
"Drinkability: A drinkable beer, but a cautionary note (outlined above in mouthfeel) stands. At 10%, this was a sipper that should have perhaps been sipped a little faster, but was also fairly solid at the rate at which I took it. Truly looking forward to cracking the bottled version soon to see both what it looks like with a year or so of age on it (how much of those hops have faded?) and what it's like with actual carbonation. Regardless, a great take on an old favorite."
"Alcohol is well hidden. Easy to drink and delicious. Style-wise Id say this lies somewhere between a Saison and a Tripel."
"An easy drinker. It's a bit hard for me to come by as I don't get the Captain down here in Cincy but I am impressed with my first offering from them. Will be seeking out some brews in the future."
"overall nice, but may have to revisit."
"4.0 D: For how yeasty this is, it never got overly bready. The alcohol is hidden really well. Good enough taste and different enough to keep things fresh for me. Overall no problems. Thumbs up for this."
"Hazy golden color with one finger of head that quickly settled to a thin film. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Not really Belgium in appearance. Really hoppy aroma of citrus. I have a hard time detecting any Belgian qualities in the aroma. Pale malt is the only other player in the aroma. It does smell inviting with the American hops. These American hops dominate the flavor and that hurts the overall score of this beer. The Belgian malt and yeast do their best to overcome the hops but fall short of doing something great. The Belgian qualities do make their appearance near the finish with some nice clove and vinous qualities. Bitterness is very high for a tripel but knowing this is an American intrerpation of the style, it seems appropriate. Medium body with peppy carbonation helps lift this hoppy beer. Overall this beer is a little too hoppy with American hops to work. But at the same time those hops are quite flavorfull and adds it's own charactor."
"Drinkability: At around $10, this is a pretty awesome sipper. I feel like I may have recently had a brew like this -- not an overly hopped American version of the style, but something that's less heavy on the Belgian characteristics but still imparts enough to give full credit to the original style. Another stellar brew from a brewery that I continue to be impressed with."
"D- Fairly high. Boozy, but very tasty. This one'll sneak up on you, as it's a pleasure to drink. I'll be buying more when I go back to NY. One of the better US tripels I've come across, avoids being too sweet or syrupy. I r-e-a-l-l-y like this beer, and was surprised at how high it scored when the dust settled."
"A pretty good beer."
"D: Wow, definitely doesn't taste like 10% abv. More than drinkable. Doesn't have the typical banana and clove tripel taste, but it works quite well the way it is."
"drinkability: good"
"Man. I love all things sweet. Fill me up with chocolate & maple syrup & ice cream. But this? Just too sweet. Pretty good, but I can feel my dentist laughing every time I take a swig. Too sweet!!"
"D: I was disappointed with this one. Not a terrible beer, but a pretty mediocre example of the style in my opinion. The carbonation was especially off. Below average."
"750 from Manchester Wine, Manchester, CT"
"Overall, this was a very good beer and I'm happy to have tried it. Captain Lawrence continues to impress me and I recommend trying this out as soon as you can. Worthy. Cheers!"
"D - Decent tripel with a well hidden abv so be careful. Would definitely recommend it."
"This is a bit of a tough beer to review, because it's not a typical tripel, but it wasn't intended to be. Still, I expected it to resemble a tripel a bit more, while adding some hop character. Instead it doesn't bring the sweetness and yeast complexity that I had expected. It drinks as a pretty simple beer, which is why even if I blur style guidelines in my mind it still is just a good one and doesn't really come very close to being great. Regardless of style, more complexity would have been nice, particularly if it were yeast derived. A pretty good beer, but there are better American made tripels out there."
"D: Yum! What is most striking about this beer is that although it changes drastically in flavor as the temperature rises (the peaks and valleys becoming more and more dramatic with each degree), it's damn damn tasty throughout the spectrum. Served it around 40 degrees (a bit cold), and drank routinely up through room temperature. Awesome beer the whole way up."
"Overall, I was pleased with this. It is not as sweet as a lot of American Tripels, although it is sweeter than the Belgian examples. Worth trying."
"This one was a gusher, way over carbonated. Popped the cap and 1/4 the bottle was all over the marble. No lacing. Fruity aroma; flavor isn't right for a triple, hops are adding a lont but in the wrong way. Mouthfeel suffers from the heavy carbonation as well, as does the drinkability. Wasn't particularly crazy about this one; give me Curieux."
"Adequately carbonated with a spritzy and peppery mouthfeel, this is a nice American-Belgian pale ale/tripel mix."
"Captain Lawrence suggested drinking this out of a goblet. I did, but since I always enjoy my tripels in tulips, I had my second glass out of a La Chouffe tulip. I thought the presentation & the nose where superior when it was in the tulip glass. The taste, maybe it was more psychological, also tasted much better in the tulip. I say go with a TULIP GLASS instead."
"d - A pretty nice beer. I didn't think it smelled or tasted too much like a tripel, but it had some notes of that style in each. Lots of bananas, citrus, and fruity malts. Would try again."
"F: Finishes with a lingering hot booze with spicy booze. Some sticky sweetness but mostly dry. Some lingering Belgian malts and tripel like flavors. A slight rustic flavor too."
"Not a bad beer, just not a good tripel if thats what you were wanting to drink. Worth trying if its around don't trade for it."
"D - This is a solid tripel. Not as spicy as I like but still quite good."
"D- Incredibly drinkable for 10% ABV. Nothing in the flavor, aroma or mouthfeel is overpowering. I will definitely finish this 750mL tonight... and I'm sure it will leave me feeling GOOD!"
"Drinkability: Very complex. I like the dryness of this tripel and the tropical fruit. One of my favorites in the style, this is a one per sitting beer as the alcohol sneaks up. Very worth the price."
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, HUGE three-finger head which finally settles down to some really thick/creamy off-white sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, bready, with some bananna notes, coriander, slight peppery note. The taste is malty, yeasty, bready, nice touch of bananna/coriander/pepper. Medium body. Drinkable, pretty tasty brew."
"D: Very easy to down a couple of six ounce pours of this Tripel. The 10% ABV XTra Gold is a pretty harmonious marriage of the American IPA and Belgian Tripel. Just the right amount of funky, spicy Belgian yeast strain character to go along with those pungent and citrusy, yet balanced, hop influences."
"D - This is a good beer, but by no means great. Drink a Straffe Hendrik Brugse Tripel instead; you'll thank me."
"Overall a fair approximation of a Belgian Tripel but falls well short of the best in the style and well short of my expectations from this brewer based on their other beers I've tried. It has a lot of the elements for a good Tripel but somehow it doesn't quite come together for me. Now that I've posted this review and see how highly this is rated I can only assume there's some variation bottle to bottle."
"Overall, this is another quality beer from Captain Lawrence. Sours seem to be their specialty but based on this beer it looks like they can probably do a pretty good job with any style they brew. It's definitely worth checking out this tripel and I will probably seek out some of their other brews. Also, if you like strong sours, then you'll love their Rosso e Marrone. Quality brewery."
"I really thought this beer was going to be a mess but it is extremely well balanced for all the flavors. Definitely will go back for more."
"Overall it's pretty impressive, especially taking into account the American twist on the Tripel style. It's an easy drinker. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Overall, I found this to be a very unique take on the style. To me it was like a blend of a Tripel, Saison, and Belgian IPA. It is a bit too peppery for my liking, but I still kept reaching for the glass out of curiosity."
"Cheers to Cuzco for sending this bottle along. The beer pours a nice golden yellow. The fluffy white cap is initially impressive (3 fingers or so) and leaves plenty of lace, but retention is poor. The nose is primarily of lemon/orange citrus notes from the hops, with some clove and traditional yeast spiciness there as well. The taste is largely a blend of the same, and the problem with both is that the balance is too far tilited towards the hops. The bottle refers itself as an ""American Tripel"" and the beer is just a little too much American hops and not enough traditional Belgian tripel flavor to live up to its billing. The beer has a nice body to it, suitably creamy, but it's noticeably undercarbonated. The best thing this beer has going for it is its drinkability, as the hops are focused on flavor rather than bitterness and the alcohol doesn't have much in the way of a presence. I appreciate what Captain Lawrence was going for, but for my money they went to far in mixing American hops and Belgian style."
"D - Although it has a high ABV, it still comes across as refreshing, with crispness and high carbonation."
"D- This was a good drinker but after one glass I was ready to jump into something else. Look forward to drinking this again but just not back to back. Nice beer overall though...would recommend."
"This isn't a huge old Belgian strain tripel, this is a more subdues and drinkable American take on the style, and it works well here."
"The carbonation is a bit below average for the style but fits well. The body is thick and sugary with an almost grainy feel to it. This is one of my favorites. One bottle is plenty for right now, but I'll get it again."
"M + D: Mouthfeel is one of the best points of this beer, I found. Body is on the lighter side of medium, with an active carbonation and absolutely no stickiness, which works well for the sweet flavours... it keeps them in check, and doesn't make anything seem cloying (though I don't think that would happen anyways, honestly. Alcohol is barely noticed, with just that little bit of spiciness adding to the mix... quite nicely done, and a good choice for evening sipping."
"Overall impression: A fine tripel, and certainly worth seeking out."
"Quality craft brew from the Capt. Fresh and clean characters aid in the enjoyment of this brew. Great twist with the additions of amarillo hops and increased sweet malts. Great to see brewers taking there craft to outter boundaries. Can't wait for distribution to Massachusetts."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking brew. Almost too easy."
"A unique take on an ""American Tripel"" that doesn't quite hit the mark in regards to both flavor and body. Appearance is average, pale and cloudy golden with a short lasting cream head. Aroma is sweet, solvent and tonic-y. Age has taken edge off the hop bitterness but the hops are still much more present than expected for the style and provide some of the sweetness. Flavors of ripe fruit, apple, pear, lime, some tropical flavors and a lingering dry and sweet finish. Hard to get an objective take on the body and mouthfeel with the extremely sharp, fine carbonation. Alcohol is still present and warming throughout even with the at least year age. Despite the negatives, I still found this to be an interesting blend of flavors but this is the most disappointing beer I've had from CL so far."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice drinking Belgian inspired beer. The citrus and fruit flavors went very well with the Belgian yeast flavors and helped make it more drinkable. Probably one of the best Triple's I've had so far."
"Otherwise a decent medium bodied pour. not a bad tripel for the americans, but this is a field i believe they've still to master."
"Smooth, malty and balanced. The peppery spice is again present on the palate but is matched by a sweet and tart lemonade-like quality. There is a little warmth going down but the alcohol is very well masked. Carbonation is soft. There is a bubble gum quality that comes in at the end but overall the beer finishes dry. Delicious and well rounded."
"D- Smooth again and light for a such a strong beer. I'm not crazy about Belgians and this one is very similar, so I could have a glass but that's probably it."
"Oh boy, my first review...been a beer geek for a while and have known about BA for some time. Thought it was time to start rating. Cheers All"
"Nice! I like a good surprise one in a while and this one really shocked me with how good it was. Well balanced, with a fresh hoppy vibrancy to it, and a killer feel and drinkibility for the size. I'm glad that this is one of the easier Captain selections to find, I'll definitely be revisiting this again in the future."
"D- This is a very interesting take on a Trippel that I thouroughly enjoy. Reminds me of a Stone Cali-Belgique. I wouldn't grab this if you are looking for a classic Trippel. But if you enjoy beer, and out-of-the-box beers, you'll probably enjoy this one. I always enjoy the CL offerings."
"Drinkability: Very good for a strong sugary brew. I think the hops and the mouthfeel are helping here."
"Drinkability: I have been sitting on this bottle for a year (maybe two), which I imagine has reduced the hoppy bitterness a notch; perhaps that adds to the enjoyment as a lot of the fruity complexity is able to join with the bitterness; neverthelss, this is not a beer that is highly drinkable in quantity as the fruit and citrus tend to wear out the tastebuds after a while"
"Drinkability - drinks very light for such high alcohol level. This is going to sneak up on me later, but I would go back for a second bottle in a heartbeat. Very nice beer. Seek this out."
"D: Pretty good a nice American version of the style."
"The appearance is a cloudy golden straw color with a full white fluffy head and good lacing. The aroma is bready/musty clove and sweet yeasty malt. The flavor is very consistent with the aroma. I get orange and lemon highlights as well. At first there is a metallic edge but it disipates quickly with a little warming. It's well carbonated, finely, and bites the tongue with tart citrus clove. There is plenty of rye bread in this mid-bodied beauty with lots of fine suspension. Refreshing, fairly drinkable if you like the style. This does better as it warms and ultimately is a slightly muted and enjoyable version of a typical Belgian trippel. It has some guts, a bit of alcohol, a good entry from the quality crew at Captain Lawrence."
"Overall, I am glad I am splitting this one with friends. I could hardly finish my glass of this. It just wasn't my type of triple."
"The alcohol presence in this beer is certainly there, but it does not interfere with the drinkability, in fact it enhances the flavor character of the hop additions and helps to create interesting floral aromas. For its 10% heft, extremely drinkable almost quaffable. That is until you stand."
"Thanks for the chance to try it beerloco!"
"Thanks to edbeer for grabbing this for me at Halftime. 750ml bottle served in my ST tulip. Bottle opened with a pop and slowly foamed forth from the neck. Poured 80% head - thick, foamy, rocky and bright white. Head eventually settles into a consistent quarter inch cap with delicate, fluffy strands of lacing exposed as the brew recedes. Color was translucent orange-gold with quite a bit of effervescence evident in solution. Nose revealed citrus, yeast, perhaps a hint of candi sugar and lemon zest. Taste consistent with nose - lacking some of the sweetness that I've come to associate with the style with perhaps a touch of hops bittering in the mix. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation level just shy of lively. Some astringency and fairly dry finishing. Pretty delicious tripel and top notch on draft. Lacking some of the sweetness typical of the style, but I actually think that enhances its drinkability."
"Well done, Captain Lawrence!"
"Very well balanced with a lot of estery Belgian yest notes and amarillo hops. Earthy hop bitterness balances out the crisp light fruit notes. Apple and pear along with some grape notes. Nice balance of bitter and sweet. Alcohol well masked making it quite quaffable."
"Well, this takes some xtra time to consume, and on a night where i wanted to drink a lot, i still took my time with it. Not as bold as other examples but i guess the slight alcohol taste combined with a odd yeast strain makes the taste hurt a bit and maybe cuts down on the fruits true cababilities. I would suggest spliting this with a friend, If you can find one."
"D: Easy sipping beer and very nice for the fall"
"Medium body a bit over carbonated, but still nice. Great Belgian IPA from CL."
"Drinkability: Pour me another please!"
"D - Very drinkable. Another winner from CL. This is one of the better American tripels out there."
"An excellent tripel with a complex and well-integrated taste that brings a bunch of different elements together extremely well. Highly recommended!"
"Cheers!"
"A 750ml bottle, one of at least a dozen I've had of this beer. This particular bottle was shared by psycohops. Thanks Bob! Poured into a matching pair of basic tulip glasses. The tripel appears a crystal clear rich golden yellow color with at least two fingers of fluffy, cloud-like off white foam. The nose and flavor consist of fresh citrus hops such as tangerine and orange, tropical fruits, melon, apples, spicy yeast, great sweet malt balance, a bit of black pepper, and some white grapes. An awesome, hoppy American tripel. The ale is just as good with some time in the cellar. A notch or two better than medium in body with ample carbonation. Surprisingly drinkable given the high ABV. Great stuff!"
"D - A nicely hopped Triple, the American hops do nothing but help add dimension to a trully strong almost boozy tripel. I enjoyed the beer but would have to take my time if consuming a bottle."
"HV"
"M & D- medium bodied, carbonation is on the high side but it goes well with the belgian candi sugars and fruitiness. Drinkability is alright, the alcohol is defiantly a defining factor here."
"I poured the xtra gold into a Duvel tulip glass. The appearance is a medium hazy yellow with a large frothy head. It smells of citrus and some light spice. Taking a sip, I taste grapefruit, hops and some of the malt. It tastes very, very good and it is a great tripel from the U.S., which is not always the end result of this style from U.S. brewers. The mouthfeel is sweet, hoppy, some of that warm alcohol comes through as well. But for 10%, xtra gold is by no means overpowering. Drinkability is there on this spectacular beer from Captain Lawrence, very glad that I picked up this bottle after finally making the trip down to see their brewery in person."
"I really like this beer and it's a perfect compliment to a warm summer day."
"Picked up a 750 capped bottle at New Beer Distributors in the Bowery. I like it when labels tell the truth and this really does taste like an American-style tripel. It's more crisp (and fresh) with juicy citrus hops rounding out a more traditional spice and pepper malt and yeast flavor. Sometimes US brewers try to put their own American spin on a Belgian, but the beer just comes out too plain, this beer doesn't do any of that. It takes the best of both worlds making for a delicious and satisfying beer. I'll also note that fans of hoppy Belgian's should look to this beer."
"Overall, a really good tripel, and I would definitely recommend this, especially to fans of hoppier Belgian-style brews."
"This is a refreshing good beer."
"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a solid pale malt scent along with a warming alcohol and fruity yeast ester aroma. There is a bit of citrus and an earthy undertone. The taste is exceptional. It has a very nice pale malt flavor that's warming. The yeast adds a ton of character. It has an awesome fruitiness with a dry earthy finish. It's also quite bitter. I'm guessing Chinook hops, because of the grapefruit character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a very good drinking tripel. It's loaded with taste and aroma; a well brewed beer."
"Worth trying if you can get ahold of it."
"Zesty yet dry in the mouth. Saltine cracker maltiness, with a nice burst of juicy fruity hop flavor. Kiwi, mango...of that variety. Zesty, juicy, then dry mouthfeel. Touch of tartness on the backend. Alcohol very well hidden...excellent version of an American Tripel...probably the best I have tasted. And a very nice beer for my 200th review."
"Light-medium bodied with a lot of carbonation and a dry, crisp mouthfeel. A delicious beer."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Wow. Maybe the best American beer I've ever had. This is a masterpiece, right up there with CL's Nor'Easter."
"Drinkability: Not a bad brew. It needed to be a little more delicate with the spice and alcohol as they do get cloying. Not terrible."
"D: Excellent. Great balance between hoppy, spicy, and sweet. I found it hard to detect any alcohol and I was shocked when I went to enter my review and I saw that this weighs in at 10% abv!"
"Taste is sweet, spicy, cloves, caramel malt, yeasty breadiness, and a very distinct dry, hoppy mint. Tropical, pineapple. Unique and delicious. Finished dry, crisp minty hop bitterness."
"Very easy drinking beer. I'm not a stickler for beer styles so I can accept this beer as an American Tripel and just enjoy it."
"Interesting beer. I like it, but don't 'love' it. I put this with Cali-Belgique and Le Freak. For me, Le Freak is solidly the best, with Xtra Gold way ahead of Stone Cali-Belgique."
"A nice American version of the tripel."
"A great one to keep around and change pace from traditional Belgians. Not as in your face as a BIPA and therefore a wonderful surprise for all who partake. Get two bottles as one is a tease."
"D: Great sipper, compelling nose, balanced taste."
"D- As far as sheer drinkability goes...after at least 6 months the ABV is very subdues and barely noticeable...making this very deceptive. The flavors of this brew are very good-and very soft. If chilled its best to let this warm a bit before drinking-otherwise you are doing yourself a disservice. Its very good...but very soft...so I really didn't taste much during the first glass (which was slightly chilled). Another wonderful brew by Captain Lawrence!"
"Overall for a triple, this was fantastically drinkable. No hints of alcohol at all and really just amazingly complex. I would love to try this one on tap as I heard it is mind blowing. This is one that needs to be sought out!"
"D: Very drinkable for a 10% beer."
"D- Clean and easy to drink. Overall, this is a very good tripel, however, CL has put out better beers."
"D- I was pleasently surprised by this beer! The boottle describes it as an American Triple. It is a fitting description as it takes the best of the belgium style triple and puts a good old American spin on it. I thought it was very balanced between the fruity sweetness and floral hops. It definatly stand out in its catagory for me and a joy to drink. I will be picking up a few more next time I'm at Whole Foods. Cheers!"
"D - I found this to be quite a complex tripel with a noticeable hop presence. Nothing really overpowered the flavor profile, making this a well-balanced brew that was easy to drink."
"Oh, and the bottle art pictured here is quite old.."
"D: A great Belgian style American beer, warm , spicy, great hopping that stands out and good cola flavor. Great yeast bite compliments an already good beer. Definitely a recommend."
"Taste is a perfect balance of belgian and IPA. This is the first of the style that I have thoroughly enjoyed. The hops are very citrusy and work well in this Tripel. Plenty of carbonation and bitterness in the hops that create a wonderful mouth feel. Wonderful beer and you never notice the 10% ABV. I could drink this regularly, very well done and enjoyable."
"smoke from the oak to follow."
"I'm pretty sure this bottle has been sitting in a warehouse for a while because the hop flavors are not nearly as intense as noted by others, but that's the beauty of it. While the hop flavors have become less intense over time, it's still a damned fine tripel. I hope to get a taste of this fresh in the near future."
"Notes from 2/20/07"
"Excellent aroma of spices, apple, apricot - quaff just mirrors these and adds a sturdy malt backbone. A touch of hops still kick in the finish. Well carbonated and sips like a dream - no hint of the high power abv. Maybe it's the aging, but this is a top-notch tripel - American style."
"D: Westcoast hoppy take on the triple style. Captain Lawrence's pale ales are ver popular and this creation has some cross pollination to the triple. More spicey and light than the full body and sweeter versions."
"This is a beer that I have heard good things about. It pours a cloudy yellow/gold with a gigantic white frothy head that leaves good lacing. The smell is pungent with banana,cloves,citrus scents,wheat,and pepper. The taste is very crisp with a bitter hop and citrus lemon flavor. There are also lemon,pepper,banana,cloves,and some alcohol. The taste is very good and the alcohol is pretty tame,but the citrus flavor is fantastic. The m/f is light for a high octane brew which makes this a very good beer. It's my first from this brewery,but it won't be the last."
"D_A very interesting take on the tripel style. Very American in the liberal use of hops but with all the classic hallmarks of the style. I have had this on tap a few times before without reviewing it but I have to say I am glad to have that i haven't. The bottled version is superior."
"D: Really great beer. The orange flavor on this beer makes it amazing. I have a 2006 in the cellar. This one might be better fresh and you would loose the wonderful hop taste."
"Xtra gold is very nice. More reminiscent of an IPA then a true tripel. This ""Belgian IPA"" is very very tasty regardless of style. Well worth sampling if a fan of Belgians or IPAs"
"D - Certainly a unique brew, with a distinct flavor profile that doesn't quite fit into any one category. I enjoyed it, though I usually don't enjoy the style."
"Notes: When I decided to step it up a notch at the cask fest I picked this one and it was in among the top 5 for the night."
"This was a Tripel I could sip slowly, and would want to share a bottle with 1-2 others. If I can get a fresher sample i'll re-review this. Thanks to EehaiCJ for sharing!"
"D: A heavy and heady brew, but I drank most of a growler by myself anyway. Not sure if this says more about me or the beer."
"I am having this with lunch, on a workday, which might be a mistake, because a 750 of 10% (which is EXTREMELY well hidden) might make for a very unproductive afternoon, but what can i do now, its open! I have one more of these I am cherishing now I think."
"Xtra Gold is my favorite from Captain Lawrence so far, after only 5 or 6 of their beers. I love the twist they put on this tripel with the amarillo addition. I'm going to try and get my hands on more of these bottles because they're damn good. Thanks again Shannon!"
"Drinks (too?) well. While thiere is a slight alcohol bite, it doesn't show its true abv intil the tongue gets numb - even after slow-sipping - half-way through the bottle. This is interesting. Not a true example of a tripel, but, it wasn't meant to be. An American invention, with a nod to the Belgians, as claimed on the label. Doesn't matter. It's so unusual, and changing, that my written notes are in a mess. It's one of those that I like more for its uniqueness/inventiveness that ""works"" than as something I would regularly purchase. Unique and interesting. An American twist (in a heavy-handed way) to a broadly fitting in with a Belgian Tripel inspirated brew."
"Pours a foggy sunset orange hue with a full two finger pillowy white head that slowly dies down to a soft layer of foam. Nice lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell is pretty hoppy up front, I guess that's why Scott calls it an ""American Tripel"". Sweet grapefruit, honey, and yeast in the nose to begin with. Some apple and pear combined with faint pepper and spice as well. Sweet fruit flavors consisting of pear, tangerine, and white grapes at first. Midway the bread-like characteristics emerge with the yeasts and pale malts. Aftertaste is a touch dry with honey, grapefruit, lemongrass and lingering alcohol. Best tasting Tripel that I have experienced by far. Soft medium body with a pleasant carbonation. The 10% abv is hidden extremely well, be careful with this one. I'm not a fan of the style and I haven't tried too many, but this is by far the best overall Tripel I've sampled. I'm thinking because it's hopped up, but hey, that's the hophead in me. Hell of a beer, get your hands on this one for sure."
"An interesting American take on the style, and a good bottle to split with a friend. Very enjoyable."
"Bottle courtesy of Beerlando: Poured a deep golden and lightly hazy color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of Amarillo hops with a medium sweet malt base with some light fruity ester. Taste is also dominated by some light fruity ester with some medium-sweet malt base and a hoppy finish which kind of detract from the fine mal base. Full body with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting and different take from the classic Belgian style but in the end the finish is too dry and hoppy to raise this beer to classic level."
"I thought this one was very tasty and refreshing, despite the high alcohol."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a huge white head that dissipated into a chunky cap. The aroma is of sweet tropical fruit, light lemon, tart apple, and booze. The taste starts off with a quick shot of bitter hops which is quickly neutralized by a sugary lemon sweetnes and tart apple. The brew also has a tin like metal flavor. The feel is moderate and quite fizzy, there is a good balance between bitter and sweet; finishes with a slight belly burn. This beer definitely gets better as you drink it. At first the mix of flavors seemed to be a mess but as I got through the glass, the flavors came together. A very good tripel, not cloying or overly sugary."
"Drinkability is good. A very nice American take on the Belgian Tripel, I am glad I got to drink this one. Quite tasty, and well worth trying."
"This batch was not as well integrated, and due to the fact that less Amarillo was used, was not nearly as aromatic and hoppy. It was still funky and good, though I much prefer the new batch"
"By the time I finished my pint, I was completely blown away. This immediately became one of my favorite beers. That said, I had it again a few days later at barcade and it was overly lemony in both nose and taste and the body wasn't as impressive. Not sure if this was from batch variation or handling or tap lines or what, but that one I had at the Ginger Man came pretty close to the perfect pint."
"D: Nice and rich, light body and a big punch. This is a refreshing unique brew that is entertaining and worth a long session."
"Notes: Not sure what the big deal about this one is. Decent stuff, but nothing special."
"Over all a decent beer, that I recall being much better in the bottle, I'll have to go back and test a bottle again when i get a chance. For only 5$ a glass at Spuyten Duyvil it's definitely worth a try"
"Thanks go out to scootny for this one. Pours a foggy gold with a thin white head. Nose is spiced with some citrus and a pleasant tone of alcohol. Lemon is definitely there. Flavor is spiced and funky. Slight alcohol. It's pretty tangy. Nice feel to it. Good liquid body and a biting and distinct carbonation. This is a nice tripel. It's a bit hot, but still well made."
"Beer poured a light golden body with a medium white head, nice lacing and ring on the edge. There was a pleasing citrus note that mirrored the taste as well. The nose and taste also had definite tones of hops, bitterness as well. Balancing this all out was a present but not overpowering malty sweetness. I also detected some peach notes in the taste as well. Overall a solid beer."
"It matched perfectly with a roasted salmon on lemons."
"Drinkability is moderate, this is a peculiar beer that seems to be a bit off-style with the high hop presence that is compounded by over-carbonation, overall a decent beer but a bit disappointing from what I've heard about CL, either way I definitely look forward to trying more styles from this brewery in the future"
"Drinkability: Complex flavor but nice finish. This beer hides its strength well."
"If looks are any indication of the high price, than I can certainly understand... One of the best appearances I have seen in the style, with a golden colored hue that included obvious carbonation and a gigantic foamy and frothy head with immense staying power... the head was absolutely huge and actually kept rising instead of shrinking and then just proceeded to sit on top of the golden-colored brew... The smell was very spritzy with citrus and lemon-like nuances... this has to be one of the most authentic Belgian-like brews I have come across or tried that have actually been American-made... the taste is very similar to many Fantome beers that I have sampled with an apparent champagne-like characteristic, and pepper-essence and less of the sweet, candied flavors that are in other depictions of the style.. Mouthfeel was very thick, rich, and creamy with a candied-flavor certainly noticeable... drinkability was good, and the alcohol is hard to detect behind an amazing conglomeration of rich flavors... it only took a hit due to the hefty 10% ABV... otherwise, an outstanding brew... Definitely recommended..."
"This one is worth a repeat, in my book."
"Drink: Yeah, could...in fact did finish this 750 myself. Nice. Would certainly like more and I'm sure I would have the same tastes and experience from first sip to last."
"Not near as good as their Cuvee de Castleton but most of their beers probably are not, this is one hoppy tripel, a nice American mix of a Belgian beer indeed, recommended if you can make a trip to the brewery or get in a trade, not too bad overall"
"Overcarbonation might have occured at the time of bottling or it might be due to faulty bottle conditioning. In any case, Captain Lawrence Brewing's Xtra Gold Tripel Ale is a disappointment relative to expectations. Maybe this year's batch will be better."
"Another great Captain Lawrence, this yummy hybrid of a bitter IPA and yeastiness looked good, smelled good, and tasted great. So what the person I shared this with and supper thought it overly hoppy and likes sweeter Belgiums. More for me. Very drinkable.Creaminess from the yeast, which starts sweet and then gives a good controlled bitterness from the tasty Amarillo."
"I gotta say that I wanted to take a sip as soon as I opened the bottle and smelled the wonderful aroma. I am a big fan of Captain Lawrence and Scott Vaccaro. It was a big plus for our area when Scott moved back to NY state. Such a wonderful ale!"
"Big thanks to EriktheRed for hooking me up!"
"Wonderful citrus nose and flavor. Sweet taste upfront with a pleasantly bitter taste on the back end. Lots of grapefruit taste. Very interesting beer. Alcohol taste was a bit too present. A very unique beer, definitely worth trying. I will be on the look out for other dank beers from this fine captain."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3"" off-white head above 1"" of clear burnished golden brew. Head is big bubbled and fades gradually, with heavy thick lacing, and lots of it. Aroma is sweet, spicy, and lightly citric. Taste is malt sweetness upfront, dpicing in the middle, and a warming alcohol close that radiates down the throat as it goes. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, and drinkability is on par with the style. Not liking this one quite as much as the first time around, but still a good tip."
"Belgian style IPA or American tripel, it boils down to a basic brew that's blended enough to come off as nicely complex. The hops and yeast are interesting bedfellows. The ABV comes up big, but hey, nothing wrong with a nice-drinking buzz. This is my first Captain Lawrence beer, but rest assured, it will not be my last."
"Pours a pale straw gold, nice haziness with a large fluffy white head that very slowly recedes leaving some nice lacing as it does so. Aroma is lemony and clean, citrusy, pineapple, a sugary sweetness and evidence of the alcohol strength. Taste is large hoppiness, strong mango flavor, more soapy and perfumy clean, a good alcohol punch with a spicy pepperiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium, a good amount of soft sugary feeling balanced with thye pepperiness on the tongue from the hops and slightly effervescent carbonation. There are hints of belgian sugars and yeast but this beer is screaming with hops. My first CL beer and it is unique and a surprise, definitely not what I expected when I saw it listed as a tripel. I'd like to age this beer a bit to let the bitter edge back down and allow the fruitiness to come forward a bit. Thanks Alex for the opportunity."
"Drinkability: a wonderful version of a Belgian Tripel that pleases the tastebuds and puts a smile on your face. Noticeable alcohol knocks the score down a notch, but this is still quite easy to quaff. Great beer worth picking up."
"Excellent!"
"Scotty, beam me up! I have been to heaven and back in the world of American Tripels. The citrus, sweetness and bitterness are all pretty amazingly perfect. Reminds of something similar in 'philosophy' to the Houblon Chouffe, which is a compliment indeed. This is superbly drinkable and I like it as much as, if not better than, the original - though the original was really good in my eyes (I have not reviewed it yet). Was supposed to but oh well - I have a few bottles left so it will come in time, like many other things. Bottom line here is very, very nice Scott!!"
"if the capn can improve a batch so furiously from #1 to #2, i can only imagine where they will be in five years."
"Served in a tulip glass, the beer was an opaque haze of gold. Bit of white head, but didn't leave much lace at all. Smelled extra hoppy for a tripel -- fruity (Cascade?) and a touch spicy (the yeast?). Delicious! The hops were dominant -- definitely an American take on the Belgian style -- but there was a bit of the yeasty bitter spice and a honeyish undertone. Full mouthfeel, and went down smooth for the style. Another feather in CL's cap!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, sugary, bready with medium volumes of CO2 that fit well."
"Scott V. is brewing some fantastic stuff ."
"Nicely tart with a subtley sweet apple/pear flavor that is coupled with a bit of doughiness. A nice interpretation of the style, and very close to home for me."
"Belgian style large bottle, capped, pours cloudy light, lemony amber, raises an initially huge Duvelesque light tan head, showing fine retentive powers, dissolves very slowly to a ½ inch thick film, lively carbonation continues to send bubbles rising to the top, and leaving thick gobs of sticky lacing. Bold nose of citrus infused hops. This is simply a delicious brew, hoppy/American style tripel is a style made in heaven, at least for my taste buds. Notes here of fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, pears, grapes, all balanced by a healthy jolt of grainy, citric hops.Nutty, yeasty final pour puts this one over the top... Nice, nice, nice.Got an extra bottle this afternoon to help wash down the Thanksgiving Turkey and fixins. Drop what you are doing and get over to the good Captains to secure yourself a few bottles of this complex, well crafted elixir!"
