"Poured from the bottle into a clean beer snifter. Extraordinary head retention! I have never seen anything like this before!! In fact, I wanted to sip it but I declined because I wanted to see how long the head actually stayed. Aroma is of belgian yeast with the slight candi sugar presence that most Belgian brews have. Very light in color (about 8-10 SRM). Tastes of sweet estery goodness! I get subtle banana, golden raisins, and wheat upon first sip. Following the next few sips I get some port Wine on the palete. As a 10% abv triple, it's the strongest one ever had, however, it's the best overall up to and including the later brews."

"these guys just crush it for me, one of my favorites, although i see their beer so rarely its always a treat to find one. this is a real heady tripel, foamy as can be in the tulip, bone white several inches on a slightly cloudy blonde straw colored base beer. the nose is sweet like most tripels, but this one for me is more about the yeast. it feels rustic and ancient, summery and different, not so fruity in flavor as other, but not spicy either, its sort of off the spectrum in that regard, which i like a lot, has a mustiness to it as well, which suits the sweeter base beer. maybe some oats in here, there is plenty of body, and i am surprised to learn its so strong, it drinks so much easier than this with its effervescent carbonation and only medium body. a bit of lingering sweetness, but made appealing by its interaction with the yeast flavor as it goes down. so cool to have this one on draft, i need to find more of their stuff. i am not usually a huge tripel guy, but this one ranks."

"Wow it made it America in one piece! It still held its head, I've been so disapointed in what we are getting in Florida lately! Chimay headless! How dare they! Great Beer! Bier!"

"Nice beer all around. I always have difficulty and a personal preference against triples that come off sweeter and this one toes the line."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Textbook Triple. Quite warming but hidden by the nice fruit sweetness. Held up well over 3 years. Recommended if Triples are your thing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I feel like this beer is a bit past its prime. I was hoping to get a nice, aged beer but this one has been on the shelf a bit too long. Hopefully I will be able to try a fresh sample one day."
"Pours a rusty orange amber with a medium white head. Aroma ripe apple, pears, Belgian yeast, fruity alcohol esters, some dark fruit notes as it warms up. Taste of Belgian yeast, fruity flavor of dark fruit, dried plums sweetness and a mild tartness, sweet alcohol. Palate is a med to full body with sweet tart Belgian yeast and moderate carbonation. Finish is of sweet ripe dark fruit, dried sweet tart plums, Belgian yeast, with mild bitterness and sweet alcohol. Overall a very good, tasty and all around flavorful brew, very nice"
""

"O-This is a pretty solid tripel. It is very aggressive, with the alcohol but the flavors are nicely balanced, so the beer manages to get away with being so in-my-face. The hops are especially well-done here. The mouthfeel is a little fizzy for my liking in a tripel, but overall this a solid beer that I will drink again if I need a break from my usual Karmeliet fix."

""

"Seemed to me like a mix of Belgian IPA with a Tripel. An alcoholic punch and a bit too sweet resulting in low drinkability. A must for Tripel lovers."

"MF – Medium-light body with a real dry finish. Clean, fizzy, sharp. 3.5"
""
""
""
"Pours a murky yellow-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, honey, fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy malt and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has flavors that are a bit more earthy than the smell would indicate."

"O/D - Great stuff. Very nice and sweet but not cloying. So many layers. Definitely one of the better Tripels out there. Very drinkable but it took me a long time to get through half. Great stuff."

"Pours a slightly hazy dull amber with billowing dense white head, settles slowly to a half inch with big chunks of lace left behind. Smell: honey, spicy, melon, grassy. Taste: amped honey, spicy, fruity, finishing grassy with citric-esque acidity cutting through honey and pale male sweetness. Delicious hider of alcohol."

"I'll always have a weakness from tripels - clean flavor profiles, potent but not abrasive, often gorgeously presented. De Dolle nails this one - a definite classic - lots of honey, clover, yeast, bubblegum, clove - all the classic profiles. Extremely drinkable and refreshing."

"I rank this amongst the best tripels I have had; it is smooth, light, tasty, flowery and and just good to drink."

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is never fizzy, but gently foamy and smooth. Ethanol is rather easily noticeable on the throat and in the nostrils, less so on the tongue, and particularly so after each sip when the beer warms somewhat."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a lively but not overdone amount of carbonation. The flavors are spot on for what anyone could want/expect in a tripel. However, despite this brew having quite a bit of age on it, the alcohol is well pronounced but integrated fairly decently in this brew. If anything, the warmth of this brew distracts just a bit from the overall ease of drinkability. The last time I had this brew it was from a 750ml that was 17 years old. It was not the best of experiences but this even with its own significant aging was much better. I am curious now about having a bottle as fresh as possible just for the sake of comparison. If you havent had this yet, what are you waiting for? I will need to put this on the to-do list to grab more of these when I see them."

"O - Hard to drink. semi nice aromas. simply- too boozy. i won't buy this again."

"2002 vintage. By now, she must indeed be pretty pissed... Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy amber-gold topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light banana, mild vanilla, wheat, mild booze, and light orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with a good deal more funk and tartness, which actually kinda works here. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, somewhat sticky finish. Overall, a surprisingly tasty tripel, one whose age and ""abnormal"" characteristics somehow haven't had any negative influence on things, but rather seem to have augmented them ever-so-slightly."
"o - terrific tripel and one i'll go back to again."

"D - there's a lot going on in this beer, but it doesn't fatigue the palate, even though you expect it to with its strong aroma and high abv level; to some extent the phenolic/alcoholic finish does limit the drinkability some, but I certainly didn't want it stop at one with this beer"
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent drinkability. Great beer. De Dolle quality"
""
"O - An intense Tripel with alot of personality."
"From the 33 cl bottle bought in Gent at Beer and Gin House. White cap says bottled March 2012. A beer well worth trying if you're looking for an education in Belgian beers."
""
""

"Simply put, this beer is rather amazing. Super dry, yet super sweet, and everything in between. I love it."

"Man. Been a very long time since I've had this beer; and I've probably been doing myself a disservice. So smooth and distinct. Really even and well balanced. Great character, with things staying consistent and even. This is an outstanding beer; delivering a great body of flavor that shows clear brewing expertise. A must try for all beer lovers."
"I love this brewery and I love all their beers. Poured a massive all-head in a vanilla cream froth with long life. The body is a hazy golden yellow. Not much of a smell initially but caramel and dried fruit slowly emerge. The taste is quite complex with candies like butterscotch and caramel, fruits like pineapple and fig, and a touch of sourness. Long finish. Nice tripel."
""
"OVerall - Very tasty and easy to enjoy. The sweetness is slighty overpowering, therefor taking away from the balance of a world class tripel. If you like tripels, or very sweet, floral belgium beers, this is a must try. Cant touch St. Bernardus or la fin du monde in balance and price, but is for sure worth a drink."
"This borders on being too spicy, sticking to the back of your throat, but it never gets there. That's commendable, but it could use some banana esters to balance that out. Lots of goodness in here, but a bit too heavy to make it an excellent Tripel."
""
""
"O: High score for originality and overall gravitas. An indulgent ass-kicker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice. Maybe a little too boozy for the style, but I wouldn't turn it down."
""
""
""
"O - this is a great tripel... Maybe a little slightly too sweet, but I like it... 4's on the board"
""
"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong but well-disguised kick, good representation of style, this is a very good stronger Belgian-style beer to drink for a while."

"Pours an absolutely ideal shade of gold. A bubbly, fluffy head is perched upon the top, thanks to the strong, continuous carbonation. No visible sediment. Very picturesque. The aroma is practically god-like. A complex and intriguing marriage of bitter and sweet. Desirable yeast aroma is present along with caramel, both sweet and sour apples, pear, banana, lemongrass and spices. Taste - velvety and bready Belgian yeast and malt. Tart and tropical fruits, lemony hints. Spicy phenolic characteristics as well as a definite bitter hop presence. Honey, although not nearly as sweet as the aroma may have suggested. This beer really coats the mouth well and the finish is somewhat dry. Some Belgians are borderline cloyingly sweet with no other complexities - not so at all with this masterpiece. One of my absolute favorite beers. I cannot imagine how this could get any better!"
""
""
"O: Certainly a very big and loud tripel. Whew. Aroma and taste are very strong. Carbonation is high to boot. Lots of pepper (almost overly so) and belgian yeast in this one for sure. Excellent example of the style."
""
""
"Incredibly smooth triple. Very nice flavor. All of the sediment in the bottle and glass was not very appealing, so I'll need to track down a fresh bottle and give it another shot. Overall, an incredibly nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Update: Paired with Chimay cheese and noticed a little sweet booze towards the end of the taste. Otherwise very well concealed for 10 percent."
"Appearance is a dark golden tone, with a big, frothy head. Its` nose has candy, booze, citrus and belgian yeast. Upon sipping this serious tripel and I taste bread, vanilla, caramel and bit of a sour aspect. Mouthfeel is full bodied, a nice sharp, sweet finish. A very nice tripel, one of my favorites out there."
""
"Overall this is a fantastic beer. I would drink many more if I weren't already drunk and had any extras. For a 10% beer I am completely sold. I was sceptically to spend $7 on this one, but I understand the price tag given the robust flavor and extremely satiating flavors..."

"Bottled August 2010. Poured to duvel tulip the beer is a mostly clear orange amber with a billowing 3 finger white bubbly head that continues to crow at least 2 fingers out of the glass, wow. Yeast particles noticeable even after a careful pour. Appears extremely carbonated. Superb retention and lacing. Nose is a light crisp sweet apple fruit tone with hints of clove, citrus and belgian yeast. No hint of alcohol. The flavor is very aggressive with the light crisp fruit flavors, mild bitterness, clove, spice, and citrus character. No hint of alcohol. Finishes crisp and dry. Good carbonation, medium bodied. Overall, a nice Tripel. Crisp and aggressive yet complex and refined. Enjoyable."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled July 2010. Pours cloudy golden orange color with a huge 2-3 finger foamy off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice lacing clings to the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head nicely. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, pepper, apple, grape, apricot, banana, candi sugar, bready grain, and spicy yeast. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big lemon, apple, grape, apricot, pepper, banana, clove, candi sugar, biscuit, tart grain, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of apricot, lemon, pepper, clove, biscuit, yeast spices, and tart grain on the finish for a while. Nice balance of flavor with nice complexity. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent, complex, and well balanced Tripel. I would have this one again."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber with fine particulates floating in it. Massive fine to coarse head takes up half the glass with a careful pour. Good retention and leaves massive lacing. Aroma of sweet light fruit, citrus, cloves, Belgian yeast. Flavor is intense light fruit; stone fruit, apple, oranges. Finishes much dryer with the hops and cloves asserting a sharper flavor and a bit of a floral element. Quite a delicious start and pleasant flavor progression. Medium bodied. A quite enjoyable and well made tripel. I enjoyed this more and more as it opened up in the glass over time."

"O: Glad I had it, nice performance in a lot of categories. Worthy buy."
""
""
""
""
"O: Another standout beer from De Dolle."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is a little heavier then average with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a pretty solid beer of the style. It was pretty balanced, flavorful and relatively easy drinking for the style."
"PS: I also don't see any reason why this label costs 50% more than St. Bernardus, Guldenberg, Westmalle or other great beers/brewers."
""
"O: Easily one of the best tripels I have tried, and although it isn't my favorite style...it's very clear that this is a very respectable beer."
"Very decent. Not a top favorite, but one of the good ones."
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't dislike this beer but It didn't make a huge impression either. I would certainly drink it again but I will never pay that price for it in the future. Also, for that kind of money it should have been served in the proper glass."

"One of my all time favs. Served at a great temp with a grand, billowy, soft, foamy, frothy, fluffy, off white head that sits there for a while before burping and lots of clingy lace. Color is a clear amber with loads of bubble trails. Aroma is yeast on top, then malt, vineous. Flavor is like nose with lots of yeast bitterness followed by hop, just a little sweet, good carbonic tang, white wine, apples, pears, hint of funk. Body is champagne like, expansive, yet of substance and carbonation is out of sight. Finish is like flavor, without flaws and lingers pleasingly with a friendly alcohol warmth. Don't know of another tripel like it. Delightful beer from the Mad Brewers!"
""
""
"This beer poured out as a nice hazy golden color with a fluffy white head on top. The smell of the beer is spicy and has some sweet grainy aromas in there. The taste of the beer was pretty good. I felt like that this beer wasn't as good as it should be flavor-wise. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a solid carbonation to it. Overall this beer was good but not that great in my opinion, I should probably revisit this one someday and see if my tastes have changed."

"O: Not bad at all. Definitely a lot going on in this beer. I like it. Would buy again."

"Overall: Average at best. There are better tripels out there."
"O: This is a solid tripel that is noticeably more bitter than most. Not the best effort from de Dolle, but still quite good."
"Overall. a very nice tripel but not one of the best. If the alcohol was toned down just a bit this could be fantastic."
"This is one of my favorite tripels."
"Notes: Intense and balanced if not a little but pleasantly abrasive."
"Pours a murky hazy yellow orange. Lots of nice white head. Looks pretty light for a triple. Smells odd. Fuity, light, sweet. Tastes a touch raisiny and oxidized. Sweet fruits, very unusual flavours. Very interesting taste. Highly carbonted. Overall great mouthfeel. Very interesting beer."
"O-gets better as time goes on. Very nice"
"Overall very unique, for a tripel really enjoyable. Wonderful drink."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O- I didn't expect this beer to be extremily drinkable. De Dolle makes some very interesting and peculiar ales that have strong and sometimes suprising flavours. I knew I had to expect a palate challenging beer. This one though felt really over the top: too prickly on the palate and overall quite messy. felt a little more balanced as it warmed"
"It's quite good, but I can't say I love it. It's a bit too heavy and sweet, but I can see why many people love this one."
"Sampled from a well-aged bottle, so the flavor profile might have changed a bit. Overall, a pleasant beer, but didn't seem to follow the tripel style very well - significant caramel malt notes with some brown sugar background - more in keeping with a dubbel."
"The only rival to Westmalle as a world class Tripel. While Westmalle Tripel is more supple and complex and demands full attention in order to be rewarded this is immediately hedonistic, loveable and delicious. Two different interpretations but both beautiful extremes of the same style."
"O: a good tripel. A bit on the pricy side, but worth it. Flavorful and crisp, it's one of the better tripels out there."
"Had this on tap at Monk's Kettle, in the Mission district of San Francisco. Poured a medium honey color with a light frothy head. Smells light and airy almost as if you could smell a late summer barley harvest. Highly drinkable, hints of allspice and overall a very good beer. Would deffinately order this again."
"O - Overall this was spectacular. Hands down the favorite of the night behind Cantillon on tap."
"I find it to be quite similar to Straffe Hendrik (another favourite of mine)."
"Serving type: draft"
"The CPJ"
"Feels very good in the mouth, good balance with carbonation, leaving the feel of foam on your lips. A very nice ""mad bitch""."
"Probably my favorite tripel that I have had so far. Noted: the head retention has remained excellent throughout the whole session."
"Dr: High ABV, easy enough drinking, but not exemplary quality. High pricing by Belgian standards. This beer is mostly hype."
"A great tripel, surely one of the best in this style you can get from Belgium."
" The flavor has a strong yeast tropical fruit taste with a gentle raisin and subtle melon with hint of citrus rind and mild hop bitterness with mild herbal accent. There is a light sweet candy-like edge after the hints of floral hops and mild pineapple from the yeast kicks in. A mellow caramel, date and light dry pepper taste lingers and some alcohol joins the complex flavor profile of this tripel. The amount of dried fruit flavor is pleasant with mild raisiny sweetness and there is hints of honeyed banana. Overall I enjoyed this a lot, not the best Tripel since it has some noticeable alcohol, but plenty of other stuff going on to distract from that, I would gladly drink this anytime. This went very well with my New York Scramble at brunch which had salmon egg and caramelized onion with parisian potatoes."
"An exceptional tripel with a truly interestin garoma. Great flavour. Interesting and complex."
"At $8 a bottle it's on the expensive side, but I don't mind paying those prices for something this good."
"Lots of grains here with a touch of yeast in the aroma. Light banana and lemon. touches of grass and even the slightest bit of grape. light, and full of flavor, light notes of yeast and wheat, some light fruit backed in as well. Nice hints of peach and a touch of wine like alcohol, but very light and more of a subtle nice surprise then anything else. The flavor was good, and at times effortless. The finish was dry; almost a champagne like dryness to it with a long lasting flavor of grass or wet hay, and you just had to go back for another sip when it was done."
"Despite its 10% ABV I could easily have another bit I won't - one mad bitch in the house is enough."
"This is a fantastic beer. Seek out."
"D: Overall pretty good. However, I'm not especially feeling the peppery emphasis that much. But would buy this again, and I'm glad I tried it."
"O- I had never had this beer before and was pleasantly surprised. This isn't my favorite tripel, but it's a REALLY good one. Definitely pick it up if you see it on the shelf, it's tasty."
"Medium bodied, plenty of carbonation, and there is a sweet aftertaste. This is a really good Tripel from De Dolle. I need to seek this out again some time."
"Poured slightly hazed amber with a nice white head that dissipates a bit. Aroma of floral hops and a bit of spice. Taste of light fruits and light sugars, some alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is medium, with a bit of harshness from the alcohol. Moderately drinkable. Good beer."
"Taste is hugely fruity and vinous, loads of alcohol. Too big for its own good? Maybe. The body is rich, but the malts light..which leaves alcohol and yeasty phenols picking up the slack. A little overcarbonated, but a few hard swirls fix that pretty quick. Yeast really throws its weight around here, I dont know if I have ever had a fruitier, yeast driven beer before. Interesting beer, but I dont think I would buy it again."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: If you want two words to describe this beer, think “complex” and “balanced.” I found this one dangerously drinkable in that each sip followed naturally and easily after the one before it and the temptation was to sip too rapidly for the 10% ABV. I certainly would be happy to have another (after the effects of the well concealed alcohol wear off a bit). In addition, I’ll be looking out to have this one again. My overall impression of this beer is that it is a first rate tripel that provides an example of what a tripel should and can be. It well deserves its high rankings."
"Super carbonated honey pale hazed golden amber with a bright egg shell white head rising thick above the rim of this open faced Bornem chalice...aromatics contain a bit of fusel alcohol with pineapple fruity tropical esters clouding the senses as well. Flavor lets you know the alcohol content upfront as well, a bit boozey and one dimensional semi sweet biscuit malts with spicy herbal Euro hops and spicy bitter yeast notes. Bottled 8/2010 not bad has a little age on it. Again super carbonated version of a tripel I'm used to effervescent CO2 but this is literally hard to take a sip without burping. The bottling condition was a bit out of control from the get go, but as it settles in the glass it becomes much more approachable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied I spoke about the carbonation issues, a linger sweetness overrides each sip as well as a kick of alcohol that doesn't let you forget who you're dealing with one Mad Bitch. Overall impression is that this could be world class tripel if it had more table manners but I don't think De Dolle or the Dulle Teve are ready for that."
"Overall - a very good-tasting beer, with good complexity and subtlety."
"jd"
"Carbonation is way too high."
"Overall: A pretty good Tripel. Not a style I find very interesting and this did nothing to sway me."
"Overall a great and complex triple that relies greatly on the Belgian yeast for it's favor profile. I would definitely heve it again."
"This is a fantastic tripel-the aroma was killer, and the flavor was quite good. This is a clean, elegant beer, and just kicks ass."
"A wonderful Belgian Tripel with loads of flavor. Compared to other Tripels, its got great balance. As with everything I've had from De Dolle so far, this tastes like a beer that had a great fermentation."
"Like stated earlier, extremely highly carbonated, medium to light mouthfeel. Belgian candied sugar flavors abound"
"D: it's a sipping beer; easily could pass a half-hour on one glass"
"The body is medium light and carbonation is high but appropriate. Im definitely impressed by this beer, the alcohol flavor brings it down though because it is just too prominent for a tripel."
"M - Aggressive carbonation, light bodied. Like you're drinking alka-seltzer foam."
"D: Worth the price, despite being a bit out of style, I think. A very, very good beer with plenty to think about. Not something to pound, but still, eminently palate-pleasing."
"There is also a lingering yeasty, bread flavor that is also slightly powdery, which dries the tongue a bit. Interestingly as the beer warms, the peppery alcohol prominence goes from too excessive to balanced. A well made Tripel indeed."
"D- the best trip I've ever had. Hands down. This was worth the wait, so many years of living from bottle to bottle and now this. Big ups to onix1agr for making this all happen."
"D: On the pricey side but I think I did better than most. I really liked this one quite a bit. If it were cheaper this is something I would buy more often. Great example of the style."
"10% ABV. Beligum Abby Tripel, poured from .33L bottle into a tulip glass at Smith Commons in DC ($14). This Belgium Abby Tripel poured a huge foamy head that seemed forever to subsize and a dark copper appearance. The beer gave off a sweet aroma of beligan yeast, hits of citrus and orange peels. Tasted sweet, reminds me of Delirum Tremens, gave off a big peppery bite to it. Mouthability was medium-bodied and had a nice carbonation with a huge head that lingered throughout. Drinkability was nice smooth, sweet, and a very pleasant concept by De Dolle."
"A lot to appreciate here - grand presentation, an attractive scent, and a confectionery taste. Tone down the degree of ethyl madness and you've got a damn-near perfect triple."
"Drink- It took me a while to get one but I am very glad I did. Will have to pass this beer on to some friends."
"Pours a translucent reddish orange with a rather too large frothy head that takes forever to die and leaves lace patches. A great aroma of some fruity esters that vary on grape, cherry, plush tropical fruits and a orange/citric twang and maybe pear). Yeast aroma is prevelant as aroma overall is not too boozy and there are some sweet malt and spicy notes in nose as well. A light body with some stickiness yet still flows past the tongue with ease. A beer with a touch of spicy pepper and a little alcohol, there is a somewhat vinous taste of apple, pear, and grapeskin (with possible figs or raisins in the beer). Has a tart edge and is aided by some citric fruit/hop flavors like orange as well as a strong carbonation that prickles the tongue. A sturdy malt base in the backbone of the beer provides balance as some caramel and bread malt peek out. The beer finishes sharp and spicy due to flavorings and carbonation and is just a well-made beer that anyone should sip on."
"D: Pretty drinkable since it has such a high abv, the mix of flavors was nice and fruity."
"Bold, different, quality tripel."
"This bitch isn't that mad actually. It's quite warming, tasty and a damn fine bitch of a beer. The Slutty Bitch is much more fitting as you'll be wanting to give this bitch another whirl. Fo' sho."
"De Dolle Dulle Teve after a very careful pour looks a rich gold, slightly hazed with a ton of carbonation and a huge head and lace. Aroma of belgian yeast, cotton candy, a whiff of floral hop. In the taste, fruity esters, spicy hops, alcohol and white grapes. Mouthfeel is light bodied and highly carbonated, semi dry. Decent drinkability, and a solid tripel. Given it's strength, this would be an ideal nite cap."
"Very well carbonated, moderate degree of weight in the body and a dry finish while the alcohol warms up."
"Pour an orange-ish color, with an off white head. In the aroma, yeasty, fruity, and a really nice hop presence. In the taste, quite hoppy and earthy, with a dry to sweet fruity presence. A hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry and fresh hop aftertaste. More fruit presence than expected, especially in the nose. A nice fresh hop presence all the way through."
"Decent at best. You might want to do a slow pour as it's foamy. However, once that foam recedes, it's more than worth the wait."
"Notes: Very spicy for a triple, almost like a massive saison really. Reminds me a bit of Avec les Bons Voeux from Dupont. Would be curious to see this with 4 years on it."
"It was medium bodied with good carbonation. This beer has good drinkability with a bitter finish."
"D - Boozy and sweet. Not what I was expecting."
"D: Very easy drinking. No aspect is too extreme. I want to go find myself some bottles of this to have on hand. If the draft list here at the Lion's Pride wasn't so impressive and full of beers I want to try, I would order myself a second glass."
"D: Don't need more than one but good."
"D-Another phenomenal beer from De Dolle."
"I really don't what else to say. It's somewhat sour, bitter, and has enough malt to somewhat tame this. It isn't bad. It isn't good. I have to say I've had better Triplels and I am not a huge fan of them to start with."
"This is the best bitch i have ever encountered!"
"D - This is an interesting beer, the yeast character is quite dominant with malt and hops playing small, but vital roles in the overall experience. The aroma is extremely phenolic with some clove, but mostly it is a series of more unusual pepper and spice notes as well as a slightly unpleasant rubbery tinge at the end. The flavor is equally spicy, but with some fruit the lends balance and makes things more interesting. The dominant yeast characteristics here are pepper and mango, which is an oddly excellent combination. It even works beautifully with the flavor of the alcohol as the slight solvent notes of warm fermentation echo the turpentine tang of pepper and mango. Due to the powerful yeast characteristics, the malt is not as noticeable as it is in some examples of the style, but it does help to provide a smooth, bready background for the yeast and hops to act out their roles. Overall this is what I would expect from De Dolle; it is interesting, complex, slightly flawed, and utterly unique. The aroma could be better, but the amazing flavor characteristics more than make up for it, this is a beer that any Belgian ale lover must try."
"Amyliz4 gives it an A."
"Price = $3.50 at Witherspoon Wines"
"D - One of the better examples I've tasted of the style, although I prefer the balance of Westmalle or Karmeliet. The alcohol is a tad high, but if I'm in the mood for a sturdier tripel, Dulle Teve ranks up there with Allagash Curieux. Recommended."
"M) Lively carbonation, smooth but strong. Refreshing."
"I won this bottle in a raffle when I attended the GALS (Georgia Ale & Lager Sirens) meeting at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur. It pours a hazy, nearly opaque honey golden with a fairly thick white head. (Be careful when opening, though - the sample I got fizzed like champagne!) Strong, inviting aroma is fruity and a little malty, as well as subtly sweet. Rich flavor is mainly fruity, mostly apple with hints of banana and pear. There are also malty and hoppy undertones and a little bitterness. Texture is smooth as soymilk and has a good fizz to it. Definitely worth looking for, but as I said, open with caution!"
"Poured in a Duvel tulip, massive head nice golden color a little/barely cloudy and a few yeast sediments(still a good sip left with the dregs in the bottle). The smell is spicy and yeasty. The taste very spicy, lots of clean smooth malt, subdued apple. The mouthfeel is good, clean and slightly hot. A fairly drinkable beer, I could have another easily."
"Beer is medium to light in body. Heavily carbonated in the mouth and finishes well. Mostly sweet up front, again minimal breadiness and yeast character. Its really easy drinking (especially for 10%). The alcohol is hidden well. The forward feel is all pilsner malt, tastes like a brand new beer really. Some fruitiness from the esters in the midpalate and almost no bitterness at the back of the mouth. It is perhaps a little too carbonated in the mouth but nothing is perfect. I would definitely have it again."
"D- It was decent. It's Belgian, so I had my bar set high. There was nothing wrong with it, but being a tripel, I just do not think it's remarkable for that style. It is a good beer, and was a fine drink; however, I do not ever seeing myself seeking one of these out, especially if there are other tripels around. I would order it if there weren't much else, but if an establishment has this, then they'll at least have Chimay and their tripel is superior."
"OVERALL: Not impressed. Far too carbonated, alcoholic, and completely out of control. The bad alcohol burn and thin, airy body made this one a total chore to drink. The brew calmed down a little after about an hour in my glass, but there are too many better, smoother triples out there to worry about this one again. Pass."
"one of the best triple's i had"
"This one is over a year old, and oh my! it is a gusher! Just gushes out with a huge, sediment-filled body! This beer has the most sediment I've ever had in a beer. The taste is AMAZING! So damn sweet with fruits and malts that I've never had in a Triple before. This is by far the best Triple I've ever had. First time reviewing it....but will buy this every time I see it. Amazing beer with a mouthfeel that could never be duplicated. Why is there so much sediment though? Great drinkability!"
"pours a hugh hazy 3 finger head that has a white slowly receding billowing head then a nice off amber color is revealed..the smell is fruits ,dark fruits,and some candied malts,spicy yeast follows with a malt slight toffee smell..the taste is plum and melon with spice and belgian yeast it finishes slightly sweet with malts and toffee on the palate..the mouth feel is full it fill the mouth with the above mentioned flavors..drinkability is a slow savor of this brew let it warm and taste the nuances it will reveal..its a great tripel that will hit you when done @ 10%..its great"
"D: A very nice beer to review for #900. A wonderful blitz of interesting sweet malt and light fruit flavors coupled with spice and a warming alcohol presence. I will be revisiting this one again if I can find it in 750s."
"A really nice version of a tripel, more malty than most, not to fruity nor too sweet, it is just right."
"D - This is a classic Belgian beer that no other country can emulate. It encaptulates everything great about Belgian beers and why they are the best."
"De Dolle has it going on, 3 for 3 so far with me, very good and unique take on traditional Belgian styles."
"Note: I have opened many a gusher, but even with careful handling coming straight off the storage rack, this beer simply exploded unexpectedly upon opening, soaking my entire left side, part of the kitchen and two friends standing nearby. The spray shot outward for 3-4 feet in all directions, leaving only about 4-5 ounces to drink -- the rest on the floor or in the laundry. Mad Bitch indeed."
"Definitely a winner. I will quote Jason Alstrom, who says about this beer, ""Slap!", yes ma'am may I have another"""
"Notes: Really glad that I finally got to try this one! Bravo!"
"Notes: Vintage 2009. Pretty good Trippel, but not necessarily my favorite. Well balanced and a solid offering of the style. Alcohol is well hidden and there is a good mix of flavors. It looks like I may have been unlucky and got a bottle with something wrong with the carbonation (no real head). Still fairly good offering though. Worth a try, but nothing special."
"D: If you're in the mood for a tripel, you won't be disappointed. Great beer."
"Much better balance when the sediment is stirred up. Very cloudy, but VERY GOOD! This almost puts La Fin Du Monde to shame because it is a similar taste with a more hoppy balance. Price makes it slightly prohibitive for a regualar treat. Definitely HIGH QUALITY and worth it for special occassions."
"D: This beer needs to be sipped given its alcohol content; however it's not too difficult to drink after it warms up."
"Drinkability is sub-par. This was just too freaking hot. Maybe, just maybe, I'd try a bottle that's at least 3-4 years old. But this beer just doesn't cut it for me, and I love a good tripel."
"D: Of the 4 Belgium beers I had this night, although all were good, this one stood out the least."
"considering this beer has a great reputation, and i paid about $5.50 for it, i'm disappointed. i'm gonna take the next 5 minutes considering making it my first drain pour. maybe one day i'll revisit this brew and have a better experience."
"D - classic easy to drink strong belgian beer."
"This is a really good beer, with an entertaining name. It is reminding me how much I need to return to this style. The character of this beer is just as entertaining as the name!"
"There are better Belgian trippels out there I suppose.... but they are very few and far between."
"Lovely"
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding! Wow, what a fruity aroma. The yeast character is second to none. The malt bill is primarily pale malts. It's tart almost cider-like with a nice earthy dryness. The taste is good. It has a warm, pale malt flavor with a light bitterness and a dry, earthy yeast finish. The yeast fruitiness is less aggressive in the taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good tripel. I love the simple malt bill with loads of yeast character. What a treat."
"Drinkability is very good. Despite the 10% abv, the beer appears both light and complex at the same time. I could drink a lot of this before realizing the error of my ways."
"My only problem with this beer is that its positively mammoth head was so damn persistent that it made it difficult to drink. Looked great, though."
"D: Very easy for a 10% beer. This beer went down very smooth"
"D: A very good tripel, quite flavourful. A sipper for me, a beer to relax with at the end of the meal."
"This mad bitch poured quite the heavy head. The second I opened the bottle it started to foam out (after sitting for 3 hours). Great retention as well in my Duvel tulip--with an aroma similar, just similar, to a green apple. Taste is very strong and crisp with fruity flavors and tons of carbonation. Also packs a punch at 10%...Brewery De Dolle is a beast---enjoy!"
"This is an awesomely easy to drink tripel, especially at 10%. My only complaint is that the flavor is a light, wish there were some bold flavors that would make this world class."
"D- a very drinkable beer given the 10% ABV, so complex you have to have more than 11.2 oz, i suggest a bomber... split in two however"
"D: Quite possibly the best triple I have ever had, a new favorite of mine that will have to be revisited soon."
"D - Too sweet, fruity, and strong for me to do a whole lot of this."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. First DD beer I've had that hasn't spewed foam all over the place. Not really the most attractive shade of brownish-orange, but the head on it is great. Classic tripel nose of apples and pears, with orange oil, pepper, clove, and grass. Very pleasant-smelling. Flavor is also very smooth and full, with zero alcohol presence to hinder the enjoyment. Estery up front with pears and candied orange, then a nice caramel/toffee character that takes over until the finish, which is grassy with a modest but welcome bitterness. The body is sublime on this one, perfection. The only complaint here is that it is over-carbonated. A few swirls around the glass immediately reconstitute a nice head while simultaneously getting rid of the excess bubbles. In terms of flavor and aroma this is basically the quintessential tripel. Great beer."
"Careful not to disturb the yeast at the bottom of the 330ml bottle, yields a hazy golden color with a large white head that had good retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Not much lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is different for a tripel. It has a distinct mead-like aroma. But this beer also has strong spice notes. No alcohol is detected. Has a complex flavor. Hints of honey, cloves, pepper, and faint fruit notes. Sweetness is moderate to high. Alcohol flavor is kept to a minimum but the warmth is there. I was expecting more booze flavor considering the 10% ABV but was pleasantly surprised. The body is a bit on the light side but it is nicely carbonated. Overall it does not hamper the flavor. Considering the high ABV, it goes done very easy, dangerously easy. Glad I only had the one bottle."
"This beer is great with food but big and complex enough and with enouch richness to be a sipper. This one is a delightful surprise of a truly delicious beer. The balance is fantastic but with huge flavors, layers and character. This is my kind of beer - an ""extreme tasting traditional."""
"Had this on tap at the Portland Int'l. Beer Fest (2009). The colour was straw-golden with no head. The aroma was that of granulated sugar and spice. On the palate, more sugar, some caramel and spice and a hint of floral character which came through on the finish, primarily."
"A top notch tripel, but not my all-time favorite."
"At ten percent, this is a warming, but delicious Tripel. Not as dry as I would have expected, but nevertheless an outstanding beer."
"Easy drinking, sweet, but not too sweet. Alcohol is hidden, I could stick this all day"
"Served in a St. Bernardus Trappist chalice. Took the bartender a bit of time to perfect and tame the pillowey head on this beautiful ale. Complexity at every turn, no one flavor stands out as the balance of fruit and spices in this tripel are masterful. Complexity actually increases even further as this beer warms toward optimal temperature. Had to drink this one to figure out where the name is derived...your date will be a ""mad bitch"" if you only buy her one of these delicious treats."
"Not my favourite tripel due to the more obvious alcohol, but certainly a worthy example. Recommended to try, but I'd probably reach for a St. Bernardus instead."
"A potent, well rounded Tripel - though not quite as transcendental as this brewer's other offerings can be."
"330 ml bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy dark gold color with an inch and a half frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. Aroma is sweet and fruity, it smells like pears, Belgian yeast, peaches, candy sugar and apples. It tastes like candy sugar, yeast, black pepper, bready malt and apples. The taste isn't quite as fruity as the aroma is, which was a bit surprising to me. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating, and also has very high but soft carbonation. A bit too much carbonation for my liking, anyway. Drinkability is good, but would be better if the carbonation was lowered a bit. Overall I think this is a good beer, I've had a few De Dolle brews now and I haven't been disappointed in one yet. Recommended."
"Great beer in the tripel style."
"D: It goes down way too quickly for a 10% beer. I am not usually a big fan of the style. This one is fantastic."
"Had this last night as part of a De Dolle session. Poured a gold color with frothy white head that faded very slowly and left tons of heavy lacing. Smelled of belgian yeast and fruit. Tasted like a bouquet of fruits and yeast. Fairly smooth, though slightly dry. Tasty and drinkable."
"I got this at the Kulimnator in Antwerpen on Jul. 24 2009 as a 1994 vintage. It was quite earthy in color and smooth in the mouth with a subtle carbonation. Fifteen years turned this beer into almost a cider, with dark sweet tastes such as apple, raisins, and a reduced presence of alcohol. Served in a De Dolle glass, I would highly recommend this to anyone. Need to try a fresh bottling, though, because this brew is in stark contrast to all I've heard up until now about Dulle Teve."
"Very drinkable, with the alcohol well hidden and everything tasteful and in balance. It's not one that knocks your socks off, but is good all around."
"D- I splurge on a bottle of this from time to time as a treat and it always impresses me. The drinkability on this is high but I take my time and savor it. Crisp and refreshing year round. The alcohol is not noticable at all. I just wish they came in bigger bottles. Not intended for aging as De Dolle's website states."
"A 750ml bottle poured into my Duvel tulip. Purchased at Somerville Supersaver in NJ. Not sure on the age of this since I have not seen the 750's around in the US for quite some time. Appears a mildly cloudy muted golden yellow color with about two fingers of fluffy bone white head. A great pour. Notes of fruit such as green apples, pears, pineapple, black pepper, spicy yeast, sweet candi. This tripel drinks and finishes as dry as a desert with more than ample carbonation. Don't pass by this bitch."
"Very enjoyable and one to consume over time. Don't think I could have more than one in a sitting. Good Tripel."
"Drinkability isn't terribly high given the punch of the booze and the price. That's not to say that this isn't a tasty beer. It's just not super-drinkable in the grand scheme of things."
"From an alcohol perspective, it's very well hidden. However I have to say the carbonation makes it a little harder to drink than I'd like. If it was less carbonated, this beer would have achieved a much higher rating from me. Still, a great beer since Flavor and Smell are the things that matter most of all to me."
"This is a drinkable tripel. Nice & hoppy with strong herbal & earthy qualities. Goes great with Lebanese food."
"Notes: This is a very nice tripel, and a nice way to unwind after a shitty day at work. Like a glass of fruit bubblegum with a very pleasing spiciness and some booze to keep you on your toes! This Mad Bitch is sweet and playful in between the sheets!"
"A very sophisticated beer....makes me wish I would have purchased another, or even a 750 ml bottle were they to offer one. I'd like to have a little more to get a handle on it. All in all though, just like any other de dolle, a good offering and a nice unique take on a classic style."
"D- Goes down too easy. If I had the money, I could drink several of these in a session with no regrets... until the next day."
"This is a fantastic beer. It's been a while since I had one and I really forgot how good it is. one of the better tripels out there."
"Overall this is a trippel that's very well done. Definitely worth a shot."
"After having quite a few more of these I have to add that the beer's apple smell has a sour taste. I believe the beer has had a saison mix added or a sour/aged beer has been blended to the brew. Brilliant, complex, you will need to drink at least a dozen of these (though the course of a month) to understand this one."
"Another unusual beer at the local Bavarian Lodge. As an example of a Tripel, this is outstanding, really one of the best I have had. Hazy pale orange in the glass with a thin dense head, the aroma oozes forth from the snifter with all sorts of interesting ester-y, phenolic components. The smell can entertain for hours. Densely flavoured on the palate, apricots prominent, a taste profile that runs from sweet initially to a lingering slightly bitter finish. Very concentrated. A yardstick against which to measure others."
"Palate is crisp carbonation, with a nice syrupy, heavy body. Delicious beer."
"Drinkability- this is a really complex beer high in flavor , but its is a whopper and definitely meant for sipping, one i will have to visit again and see how my experience differs,"
"D: A commendable tripel with a sick name."
"Pours a brown colored body, with a rrothy white colored head. Has a strong banana aroma, with clove & spices. Some alcohol, complex aroma. Fizzy mouthfeel, spices, some banana. Clean aftertaste. Sweet and nutty. Watery as it warms up."
"Had high expectations for this beer, but felt that it left me wanting more from it."
"A real bitch of a beer, reminds me of an ex wife, but this bitch is much easier to handle."
"D= An exquisitely drinkable Belgian ale. I am in love with the De Dolle yeast strain as it brings so much unique character to their beers. This is definitely on par with the best of the Belgian tripels in my book."
"This is a very fine Belgian Tripel. It's a beer for sipping and relaxing with, not for chugging. This is one mad bitch I wouldn't mind meeting again."
"The beer had good carbonation to it and it was very easy to drink, although with the high ABV I would not drink too many at one time. Definitely a beer to drink slowly and enjoy. Very tasty and I hope to try again."
"This is a standout beer."
"I would buy this again for a friend to demonstrate how vodka and beer share similar mouth feel and warmth."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle and served in a tulip. This beer poured a pale amber with a slight cloudiness and a thick head of foamy, beige bubbles. Very slow to settle, and very heavy on the lace. The aroma was made of apricot, lemon zest, sugar-coated orange peel, and some alcohol. The flavor heavily favored dried orange peel and alcohol warmth, with some mild honey and caramel coming in at the finish. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and creamy smooth. Moderately carbonated with a slightly dry finish. The aroma didn't come across as overly inviting, but the flavor was very nice, if not a little alcoholic. Worth a try."
"Poured into New Belgium goblet. I poured slowly into the side but got a rush of head bubbly head. Hazy rich golden color. Highly carbonated. Almost 3"" of off white head, torrents of bubbles and yeast sediment. Rocky head settles to thin film after drinking leaving no lacing to speak of. Aromas of tart apple, pineapple, yeasty funk, little spicyness. Taste is fruity, tart, spicy, funky, very complex. Smooth on the front and middle of tongue, carbonation very high and prickly on the sides and back. Alcohol is evident on the funky finish. Drinkability is low due to carbonation and alcohol. Unusual tripel, not the smoothest 10% triple I have had, but interesting."
"This was probably the most interesting tripel I've had that really adds something else to the traditional tripel. The only other one that I was so surprised by was Koningshoeven Tripel. I highly recommend this for those who love tripels, but don't expect the ordinary."
" Body is bubbly and just a little sticky, but overall very pleasant. This is a very nice, strong version of a tripel. Be careful, because it doesn't go down very easily, but is a very nice slow sipper."
"Overall good tasty brew that hides the alcohol very well. I could have a couple of these."
"D- Let this warm a bit before drinking it. Its downright awful and boozy when its cold. Once it warms a bit plenty of more complex characteristics come through and this one really shines. A pretty good beer overall."
"7/4/6/4/14 (3.5/5)"
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a nice white foam head that settles into a lasting lacing. Lots of visible carbonation. Aroma isdominated by light, crisp fruit and alcohol. Very quaffable considering it's strength. Light crisp fruit notes such as apple, pear and banana with a nice alcohol warmth. Very tasty."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian triple."
"D: A nicely balanced beer, spicy, good drinkability, and stands out against most."
"A solid brew and I look forward to trying more from this brewery."
"Pours a clean golden color with an extraordinary head. A bunch of bubbles rise in the beer contributing the the retention. The head doesn't leave much lace. The smell is intensely of candi sugar with some floral notes as well. The taste is also of candi sugar but also has a nice earthy, barn-like quality on top if the sweetness that makes this beer pretty special. It has a medium body. Great beer, great name."
"I would have liked to know how old this bottle was, because I have seen this beer on the shelf for a long time and didn't pick one up until today. Kick back and sip on slowly."
"Pours a hazy gold with a white head that leaves lacing. While this beer expertly hides it's 10% alcohol, it's a touch sweet, but I suppose that's to be expected. The flavor and aroma focus mildly funky apple, orange, and berry fruit flavors with a spicy hint of hops at the end. Personally I like my tripels a little spicier and drier, but this is an excellent beer that will put you in a ditch if you're not careful."
"The last time I had this crazy mother of a beer was in Belgium. It was a treat and honor to drink the stuff in the heartland, and remains one of the finest in its class. Still what I'd call a ""headache beer," so I would tend to save this beer for special occasions and then only drink one 12 oz. bottle, enjoy the hell out of it, and call it a night."
"D- this is certainly a different trippel than im used to, but it works. easy to finish, would probably want another if it wasnt so damned expensive. good for a treat once in a while. de delle comes through with another solid beer."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, especially if you like Belgians. Tasty, complex fairly easy to drink."
"Slow and steady wins the race with this fine effort. Sip and savor."
"Suprised to see the Alc at 10%. Hidden. Interesting nose of dark butter, wood and orange carmel. Really interesting. Somewhat of an acidic mid and short finish. Still the aroma is outstanding. Almost tannic and closed. Maybe time would help this brew come around? Still very interesting. Would have been better served with friends and shared, not sure even an 12 oz bottle is for just 1 person."
"Mouthfeel was a bit hot. Zesty and mouthfilling carbonation."
"The overall sweetness, what with the malts and candy sugars, combined with the high ABV would keep this one in my 'special occasion' category. Not that multiples couldn't be consumed, it's just more special than that."
"I tried MAD BITCH at a local bar in Newtown, PA. The place was nice but I can't recall the name of it. They had a tasting of Spaten and I think I say the ad on this site. I admitt the beer was purchased for name sake only, but that beer was very good. The high achohol content is why I can't write anymore about it."
"Another great beer from By The Bottle in Vancouver, WA. This pours a glowing golden and has a silky tan head with good lace. The nose is very fruity and has some nice candy malts. There is also some spicy hops and herby Belgian yeasts. This has a delicious malt structure with candy, bready sugars and tropical fruits. Perfectly balanced by the hops and yeasts. Full body fits the brew nicely. Near perfect example of the style."
"Drinkability is limited by the prominence of the alcohol and the disheartening sight of a glass of beer with absolutely no head and no lacing. It just looked dead in the glass. From other reviews of this it is clear that a lot of people have enjoyed this beer and will continue to enjoy it, but it was certainly a disappointment for me."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into 20oz pint glass. Like all De Dolle the Mad Bitch pours with a massive head that refuses to receed and coats the outside of the glass. Chunky dark sediment seeps out with the dregs of the pour. Beer is a medium amber slightly hazy. Nose is very faint, light hops and malt. Taste is fairly light, and slightly bitter. Bitter apples at first, very light sweetness from malt or candy sugar, light Belgian yeast and pear like tartness. Slightly hot at the finish, as to be expected very very dry. Mouthfeel is nice and develops as it warms. Very drinkable but will sneak up on you at 10%"
"A couple of days after this review, I had a bottle of the 1994 vintage (first year) at de Kulminator. It was incredible. Less sugary, more fruitiness and spicy tanginess. Definitely something that gets better with age."
"T/M: Mouthfeel is very nice. Nice and slick. Medium bodied. Perfect creamy corbonation. Taste is prickly up front, fading to nice juicy fruitiness. Cinnamon apples and cider, fading to a semi-warm honey flavor finishing with hop bitterness and spiciness which lasts for a while. Alcohol not readily apparent but really warming on finish"
"I have just had my tastiest triple to date. I absolutley cannot wait to try another brew by this Brewery."
"This may be my favorite Belgian Tripel, hands down. It's incredibly well-balanced, and the flavors are unique to this brew while being grounded in the style tradition. Great, great, great brew!"
"An intense, interesting, warming sipper. My educated guess is that it would do well with some hearty food (pork?)"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Tons of esters and phenols on display here, but with a greater hop presence to balance them. Banana, apple and lemon with an earthy bitterness underneath. Sweetness is moderate but it dries up quickly in the finish. The body is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is high, almost champagne-like."
"Pours cloudy orange gold with a huge foamy head. Aroma of yeast, geass, citrus, light fruits, and spice. Tastes much the same with a vineous quality that shines through at the end. Finishes very smooth with a warming alcohol. Excellent beer. One of my favorite tripels."
"Served in my DFH snifter. Poured a rusty orange-brown color (similar to farmstand apple cider). Dense, fluffy two-inch head with some effervescence present in the solution; excellent retention with lots of sticky lacing. Body was almost opaque, but some light penetration. Scents of yeast, light-skinned fruit, candy sugar and a lingering tartness in the back of the sinuses. Some complexity in the mouth. I still can't quite tease out the fruit flavors, but there is a really nice balance between the fruit, spice (clove & coriander), sweetness (candy sugar & honey) and alcohol character. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, warming and pretty smooth considering the head. Drinkability is quite good for a tripel; alcohol is well-hidden, and the harmony of flavors makes this a really pleasant brew to sit back and savor."
"The smell so the beer has a lot of fruits to it, and it has a tartness to it. The beer has a big bite from the carbonation and has a sweat wheat taste to it. The complexity of the beer makes it quite difficult to taste everything. The alcohol is also quite prevalent. The flavours include some sweet apples flavour to a slight banana taste from the wheat. However a hint of tartness is there right before the alcohol hits. The feel is creamy and carbonated. The beer tastes good, but it's not something I'd want again."
"Finish hides the alcohol well and is incredibly drinkable for such a high ABV ale."
"This is an incredibly interesting beer with loads of taste. Worth a try for sure."
"Mad bitch is a real good tripel. It has a bit more peppery spice and alcohol I'm used to in a tripel, but they only serve to add to the enjoyment."
"Drinkability. This is one that you want to keep sipping and are sad when it's gone. The alcohol will keep you in check but another bottle will cure the sadness of finishing the first :)"
"The feel was crisp and refreshing. It is a great triple. Definitely a great beer to enjoy. I could definitely enjoy a few of these after a long week!"
"Drinkability - This is one great tripel. I personally am a big fan of triples and this is one of the best I have had so far. I could see myself knocking back a few in a sitting."
"On the whole, a delicious brew. Still, I don't see myself spending the money to pick up another bottle. I can't imagine aging this beer would do anything except make it syrupy and even sweeter, which in my eyes wouldn't be a desirable thing. A solid offering, though I'll still take Westmalle's tripel above all else if given the option."
"Poured from bottle into a Duvel tulip because every De Dolle beer I pour into my Oerbier glass goes everywhere! The head on these beers is insane and even the most gentle pour is a challenge with keeping the head in the glass. Opaque amber brew with a head the went to the absolute top of the glass. The head wouldn't go down fast enough in my eagerness to enjoy this rare jewel for me. Moderate lacing on the glass with a low encapsulating head around the amber brew. Smell is easily the best I've had to date, especially for the tripels, very sweet and very De Dolle, that same distinctive yeast they use in seemingly all of their beer. At a loss for words, intoxicating aroma that makes it hard for me to want to finish the drink. Taste isn't to disappoint. Crisp and sweet with obvious candy sugars. Easy on the tongue and very drinkable. Yum."
"Slender Belgian bottle with no freshness date, but probably a year or so old. All-malt, with white candy sugar in the kettle. The beer is golden-orange with a few dregs, medium carbonation, and three inches of white head that leaves lace and clumps of foam on the glass. Fruity and spicy in the nose, with pineapple, peach, apple, citrus and doughy yeast - very nice. Strong flavors - similar to the aroma - with the addition of candy sweetness, red and green apples, and a light dosage of green hops on top of a tingly and dry, almost full body. A very nice ale, fruity and spicy - another winner from the Mad Brewers."
"Drinkability: Quite impressive, but the cacophany of flavors is not something I would want everyday"
"Drinkability is incredible given the alcohol content. I could drink this all night. Boot and rally. Wow."
"Tastes similar to the nose with the yeasty and spices on the front lines backed up by a complex fruitiness and malts. I did even know this was over 7% until I looked it up on BA. Great beer."
"D - Age did nice things for this beer. Among the best examples of the style I've had. Not too intense, but exciting."
"This beer is one to enjoy at a comfortable pace."
"Pours a lightly hazy golden color with a big foamy white head that fades slowly to spotty lacing patterns. Visibly effervescent with suspended 'bits'. The smell is nice. Full nose of earthy Belgian yeast , sweet with notes of orchard fruits. I think the aggressive nature is partly from the alcohol, which is quite enjoyable. The mouth feel is lmedium bodied, effervescent and creamy. Full flavored, the taste is similar to the smell and is complemented well by the texture. Quite sweet and fruity with a wonderful lingering aftertaste. The 10% ABV is integrated well into the nose and mouth yet reveals itself in a warming swallow. A very easy drinker. Highly recommended."
"Copped a 750 ml bottle from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa... Dark-green bottle with a purple and yellow logo sticker with a pissed-off woman with the phrase ""mad bitch"" on the top right corner... Corked bottle that when popped, unleashes a strong whiff of alcohol coupled with a pear and fruit aroma... like the smell, the taste is heavily alcoholic, with esters, fruits, citrus, and a floral taste.. Candied, sweet aftertaste lingers on the tongue long after the first sip... definitely a beer to be enjoyed over a long period of time... the 10% ABV is certainly noticeable and makes its presence known with a warming alcohol glow... taste is very multi-dimensional and complex, with deep, rich flavors pouring through... slight sediment visible, and the mouthfeel was good although the strong alcoholic notes compromise the drinkability... the beer possesses a very champagne-like quality and with carbonation present, I would consider this one a sipper... overall, really good stuff, a strong depiction of the style... a powerful tripel that packs a punch... Recommended..."
"Lively bubbles, oily in tongue, taste is acid, apples, peaches, flowers and the chocolate background. It seems to me kind of a mix between a white and an abbey beer."
"From bottle at the trappist in Oakland. High carbonation, excellent head. Very ripe fruit flavors, especially tangerine. Nice bready, doughy notes in the aroma. Extremely low hop flavor and aroma as you might expect. Nice and dry, but not bone dry. I really enjoyed this beer."
"On tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a very hazy golden, virtually opaque, but without lots of yeasties floating around. Smells of tangy Belgian yeast with pronounced aromas of bananas, clove, and spice. The taste is wonderful. Flavors of apricot, candi sugar, clove, black pepper, juniper come together seamlessly. There is a nice finish of spice and bright, slightly spicy hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is long and attenuated. Very little sweetness on the finish. Absolutely delicious on-tap and one of the better tripels out there."
"A total treat, but the high ABV keeps it from being super drinkable, but man this is a fantastic Tripel. I'll be coming back for more some time in the near future I know"
"Drinkability- Decptively high. I wouldn't know I was getting totalled on this 10% monster until the damage had been done. There is alcohol on the mouthfeel, but not to the point that it would be percived as a big beer."
"Beautiful tripel. Hazy bubbly orange with a foamy dense head. Nose is tart apples, sharp and biting, with sugary spices. Taste is heavy on the alcohol, it kicks in early and stays strong. Strong sweetness comes through, and yeast. Mouthfeel is quite good, it swims heavily through your mouth. Drinkability is hampered a bit from the ABV and lingering alcohol flavors. Still a great beer, but alcohol hurts it."
"DRINKABILITY: Couldn't handle the alcohol flavor. I love big beers, but this one doesn't hide the alcohol at all..."
"Drinkability on this beer was a mixed bag. I really enjoyed the flavors and aromas but I found the alcohol to be a bit overwhelming."
"Sample at Firewaters in Atlantic City. This beer pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a medium rocky white head that lasts the whole (small) glass. Large patches of lacing. The aroma consists of yeast, citrus and different spices. Medium body with sweet clove and malt flavors, along with touches of hops and alcohol. Nice fruity undertones as well. The finish is both fruity and spicy. All in all this is a solid Tripel."
"Pours a hazy golden, big thick white head forms, nice lacing, super retention, head just won't quit, settles to a thick layer. Smell is sweet, caramel citrus, apples, alcohol, sugar, more apples, neat. Taste is similar, sweet and malty, wheat, apples, alcohol, caramel, quite sugary, bready, spicy finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, very warming, almost hot going down. Not a bad tripel, thanks for sharing Jan!"
"Bottle poured cloudy amber large white head that lasts thru the whole experiance . Aromas of grapfruit and wondeful spices . Sweet fruity and spicy almost pepery flavors along with a alcohol warmth and a light bitter hops finish . Bubbly and dry on the palate . A great Tripel"
"Explosive carbonation leaves quite a tingle on the tongue. Tremendously light ,airy, and well attenuated. Alcohol not noticeable at all combine this with dry body leaves you with a brew that can sneak up you. Highly recommended."
"Overall - An outstanding Belgian tripel... a nice way to celebrate my 400th review... recommended...."
"D- Great aroma and a very nice taste that is well balanced with some soft sweetness and a light bitterness."
"Despite being 10%, this is quite drinkable. Not a session beer by any means, but I could easily drink more than one."
"Tasty, yet rich enough to help you keep the speed in check, and lacking the digestibility I look for in the style. Honestly, I'd have guessed this was from the U.S. in blind tasting, it's best attribute is that, while heavy tasting, doesn't drink at 10%"
"Edit: Upon further drinking the beer....I'm finding myself enjoying the drink a bit more. The taste still not be my cup of tea, but it is still drinkable."
"Great beer... will visit again..."
"If you are into aging beers this is a winner."
"Alcohol was hidden quite well."
"Hey, this is my first beer reivew. So it goes. Purchased at the Bacchus Cornelius beer shop in Bruges 7 weeks ago and opened with trepidation, this Tripel poors a white, perfumy head that looks identical to the Proseco my wife has just opened. Viewed in my new Oerbier tulip glass, the look is reminiscent of some hot apple cider I had in Minnesota one fall. Aroma is slightly spiced, but disappointingly underwhelming. Taste, however, is magical. Taste, at first resiny, evaporates into the tonsils, leaving an apricot and corinander flourish. I doubt you can buy this in the states--that's why I bought it."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a bit of a biting carbonation, and the drinkability is good. I bought my bottle several months ago, and it took me forever to get around to it because I was a little sick of tripels at the time. I'm glad I waited until now because I think I enjoyed more now than I would have when I purchased it."
"D - I think I could have a few of these, but not a beer I could stick with all night. Sessionability is once again low due to high alcohol content and complexity of flavours which ought to be enjoyed thoroughly and slowly."
"Marvelous. I've had about half of it, and I'm surprised by how the hotness and the spice are balanced by that smooth creamy malt backbone. Well worth trying."
"Truthfully, I found this to be a little too aggressive for the style. While most tripels weigh in at 9 or 10% I simply found this one to posses less grace and be a tad harsh on the palate. This wouldn't be one of my top choices for the style. I will say though, this is merely my own personal taste and with all considered Dulle Teve is still a pretty nice beer."
"Good body and depth of complexity and flavor: really nice balance overall. Not a drop-dead world class tripel, but an outstanding ale of high quality, full flavor, and a lot of well-concealed alcohol content. Enjoy responsibly."
"I could drink quite a few of these mad ladies in one night, but you kinda have to pace yourself. This is a true sipping beer. Enjoy."
"complex in many ways"
"Pours a very cloudy golden hue. On the sweet side for a tripel, with a full body. Reminds me a little of the Unibroue 15 with it's sweeter character. I enjoyed this all the way through, and the ABV does not detract. De Dolle has always been interesting to me, if somewhat erratic. I would certainly recommend this one to fans of the style."
"The distinctive De Dolle ""funk"" is more pronounced, but it seems like the alcohol has almost completely taken over, which is interesting. Usually the alcohol mellows out with age. This beer is definitely better when it's fresher."
"Drinkability not that great. Could be because I just had an Oerbier; and it was soo much better."
"A bit full bodied for a tripel, but more complexity too. Well-balanced. Not my favorite offering from the dolle brewers, but still a complex and tasty ale."
"Strange and wonderful."
"Good god! No lack of flavor found here. The first tastes are a vodka-esque alcohol note with citrus and wheat. More ""mellow"" hops and spice notes finish and get better as it warms. Give this thing a while to sit, as the mouthfeel is offensive at first. After a good effervescing, the beer was much smoother and more drinkable. Call it an interesting beer and a lively tripel. It'll definately get your attention on the first taste, although it can be a bit too intense/unbalanced to be considered overly drinkable."
"Others have spoken of yeast cakes and multiple floaties from this brew...none were observed with this bottle. Mike at Hi-Times Cellars said that it had just arrived, so this may just be a very fresh sample."
"Very drinkable, very tasty, just a little syrupy sweet and thick to drink all the time."
"Pours a four finger, white head that quickly fades to a ring leaving a little lace. Nose is alcohol and raisins. Cloudy pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor piney raisins sweet and tart with hints of alcohol. $5.70 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Certainly a decent Tripel, but to be honest, Allagash is cheaper and tops this easily. The Mad Bitch is still quite respectable, but could use a little less sweetness and complexity for my liking."
"Into a chalice, pours a not-too-attractive dark peach, kind of dirty looking, a foamy bone white head settling on top thats settles down to a spattering of foam, nice lacing> Too bad its an aweful color, cause its otherwise a very pretty beer. Aroma is delicious, a very very fruity triple, apricots and peaches, plums, and pears, spices like corriander and cloves, lovely. Taste has the same bunch of of delicious fruits, Belgian sugars, a herbal hop streak through the middle, yeasty, the alcohol warming nicely. The body is fantastic, the whole ride is just great. Really, this is just a great beer. I just wish it were cheaper. Good thing I have several more from these crazy brewers."
"This poured with a huge, billowing, big-bubbled head, which faded quickly to a dense coating. It was a cloudy, golden tan color. The aroma was wonderful. It had a coy, belgian aroma, slightly fruity, enticingly mild. The flavor was surprisingly bitter. Between the bitterness and the carbonation, there was a nice bite. There were flavors of oak, bread, raspberries, strawberries, citrus, pine, and dare I say, peanut. The bitterness lasted long into the finish. There was a strong alcohol burn. As it warmed the flavor mellowed a bit, but the bite was still there. Overall, this was a very tasty example of a beer I'm particularly fond of."
"It is a nice beer to sip on. I like it."
"Drinkability: awesome tripel but the alcohol levels drop this score down a bit. Find this one and enjoy it. It's great on tap."
"Not your standard tripel, but very enjoyable. Recommended!"
"I love this tripel, and I love this brewery. They rarely disappoint, and this is no exception. Perfect balance with the malt and yeasty flavors make this incredibly complex, and worth seeking out. Highly recommended. Now If I could just find another bottle of the Dulle Teve Reserva..."
"Mouthfeel is medium to high, it envelops the palate like a sweet nectar, and encourages sipping. One 11.2 oz. bottle is good, be sure to share a 750, or you might wind up on the floor..."
"The beer was in a small capped not corked bottle. The smell was pleasant with a fruity hint of possibly apple. The beer was cloudy and golden. Although not usually a fan of triples this beer was an exception. The taste was smooth and crisp. The carbonation was slightly strong but enjoyable. This mad bitch made me respect triples again."
"Quite yummy on the palate. Initial flavors of spiced banana bread warm my mouth followed by a feint mineral taste and some yeast finishing with a little alcohol. Somewhat on the dry side and scrubbing on the tongue. Very delicious and punchy."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, mildly sweet, and addictive. Tiny carbonation bubbles are aggressive at first. but turn to a smoothness that delivers nicely."
"A very good tripel in my opinion. I am enjoying this beer with stuffed shells which is just an ok match. It brings out more of the sweetness in this beer. Unfortunately the dryness in triples are what I love. Get this beer."
"Overall, a very good tripel, but not my favorite. I probably wouldn't seek it out, but I might buy it again. Definitely glad I tried it."
"Drinkability/Overall: an impressive tripel overall. Fruity, spicy, dry - hits all the bases and remains balanced despite a substantial booze presence. One of the better tripels I've had."
"Drinkability: Big sweetness wears a little, but an interesting and enjoyable tripel. Thanks to Orfeu for the bottle."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink with a good balance."
"D: This is delicious. I'm not a huge fan of this style but its the best triple I've ever had. Never had a triple with this much depth. Great stuff"
"D- Well, it is really strong, but if I could get more at this price I would buy it by the sixer."
"Overall a balanced and interesting beer. Highly recommended. I would drink this often if it was readily available."
"Overall a good tripel, but nothing great."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a super heady and foamy light cloudy amber color. Aromas are very estery, some bubblegum, citrus, and hints of coriander. Fermentation temps must have been through the roof! Flavor is huge, lots of body, spice, sugary sweetness and bready yeast. Warming alcohol hits you in the end. This is a pretty amazing tripel, perhaps in my top 5. Would improve had I let it warm up a bit more, but this is a special treat and I'm glad I finally tried it."
"Clear amber color  white frothy medium head  nose of yeast , malt , cereals , grains and citrus / orange  taste of malts , yeast , cereals , grains , sour red fruit , and citrus  cream raw body , and dry style  aftertaste slightly bitter , chalk , and yeast"
"I was excited to see another small Belgian brewery to make a Tripel (as St Bernardus is my favorite), but this never seems to develop into anything worthwhile. Pours a golden color with a moderate head that dissipates quickly. Unlike most tripels, there is not a lot of effervescing going on in the glass after this beer is poured. There seems to be too much carbonation, which never lets the spices or malt develop. The aftertaste is citrus-like, but again it dissipates quickly."
"Overall, this is a middle-grade tripel. The flavors are good, the appearance is pleasing, the mouthfeel is decent. Recommended, but not as highly as others of its style."
"D - Give me another baby, this Mad Bitch is always a welcome companion to me."
"Drinkability is good a fine Tripel and an enjoyable beer. Want to thank babydoc and BCG BIF for this beer."
"Very interesting. Not at all what I expected but I very much wanted another one."
"Super drinkable for the strength. I'm not a huge fan of tripples, but I love the mad brewers & this is easily one of the best tripples I've had period. May not be yeasty enough for some"
"A sweet, tasty ale that truly that is great after a meal. Pours with a very thick head and a cloudy, amber color. The taste is a mix of sweetness with subtle overtones of fruit hidden in there somewhere, along with a dash of hops. It is quite effervescent which is typical of the belgian style. Very satisfying."
"D - Incredibly drinkable for the strength. Bold approach to a tripel which works out very well indeed."
"Drinkability- This flavor hits home as more of a saison than a tripel. This is one of the better beers I have had no matter what style, period. If it had a bit more sweetness, like most tripels, this one would be off the chart. Terrific brew and highly recommended."
"Notes: Pretty kick ass brew and although not a rare beer I haven't seen it around until my latest trip to the wine house just off the 405 freeway. Seems to be getting a nice stock of some harder to find brews. I would buy this more often and I'm sure its priced fairly but at 6 bucks a 330ml it is a once in a blue moon type brew."
"It has an attractive orange/kopper appearance, and bubbly head. I ranked the syrupy smell pretty low, but just because it is about the same as most Belgians, which is still pretty good. The taste is what I thought was the most outstanding aspect of this beer. It has a long drawn out after taste that is all over the place, from heavy Belgian syrup to a whole array of fruity flavors, but it stayed relativly dry and didn't get too sweet. This is a pretty heavy (and expensive) beer so it didn't get the best drinkability from me, but this is more than a ""worth a try."""
"from the bottle. poured acloudy copper with lots of bubbles and a large fluffy white head and a ton of lacing. aroma, spicey coriander, gloves, lemon, orange, yeast, some sweetness. flavor, cinnamon, orange zest, gloves, bready, hops, sweet as it warms alcohol came out nicely. good beer"
"Taste was different, no sign of the oxidation (if there was any at all) and the iron taste was not present. First impression was good, an alcoholic firm beer with higher alcohols, ripe banana's and a bitter, dry aftertaste. There is also some acidity in the aftertaste, but that is really in the back. Second impression was that the beer is more or less out of balance, there is too much alcohol to really be drinkable, so I cannot rate this as high as my colleague reviewers. Too bad, because I had high expectations from the Dolle Brouwers!"
"Let this one warm up. Not my favorite style, but a solid example. Better than most tripels, but a tad expensive. I got this 330ml for $4.99."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Purchased this in Belfast today in the singles box. Pours an extremly hazy golden color, thick head that last forever. Smells sweet and yeasty. Tastes a very strong taste of yeast and alcohol, with quite a bit of sweet malt in there. Thick moutfeel. Very much a beer that you can only have one a night. Powerful stuff."
"Sweet malt and yeasty aroma. A lot of mashed fruit smells. Cloudy brown/orange color with a thick white head. Sweet fruit fore then a very creamy cereal-like middle and a VERY malty finish. Odd flavor sequence, but this does taste good though the after taste makes me feel like I burped up this mornings Total Raisin Bran."
"Notes: The phenols in this beer are quite strong. The intensity of the flavor is a semi-distant 2nd place when compared to De Dolle Stille Nacht. Quite good, alcohol is quite strong, so this is a slow sipper. Definitely warms you up on a cold night. I wish this beer had a little more balance between the flavors from the yeast and the malt."
" A mad bitch she is but mighty fine."
"The abv% is noticeable but doesn't overpower the complexities of this tripel. Another homerun by de Dolle."
"A very nice trippel. The beer is big, easy to drink, and exceptionally memorable--as long as you don't drink too many."
"Beer is good. Happy tripel beering. 104/4.02"
"Over the top on all counts and not very balanced in my opinion, nonetheless thanks to Biglove for the opportunity."
"The mouth is full and the alcohol component threatens to make it rough, but it all works out in the end. This is, in no way, a session beer. Maybe two bottles....maybe. The real beauty of this beer is not only is it big, bold, and all up in your face, but there is so much complexity going on here."
"Overall: Damn, I didn't even realize it was 10%. No wonder I was a little bit more dehydrated than I should've been Sunday morning. Definitely worthy. would've liked to know the name meant dam bitch at the time..."
"Drinkability: This beer is potent and tasty. Unique flavors are very impressive and the beer is a nice warmer on a cool winter evening. Well rounded and impressively spicy."
"I like my Belgian Tripels a little drier and with more zesty hop flavor and pronounced bitterness in balance. Where this one resides a bit more on the Belgian Strong Golden Ale side, it doesn't finish as rich as those either- making this a great choice for those of Tripels but with a nagging sweet tooth."
"11.2 oz bottle served at cellar temperature into a goblet. Cloudy orange body with two fingers of thick, creamy, offwhite head. Excellent retention and island chain lacing is left behind. Complex aroma is fruity and phenolic, with banana and pineapple fruitiness melding with funky barnyard yeast, caramelized sugars, coriander, and a harsh note of ethanol. Mouthfeel has effervescent carbonation and a silky medium body. Taste is all over the board with considerable complexity. Pineapple, banana, honeydew melon, dank and earthy yeast, bitter Saaz hops, warming alcohol, and burnt toffee. An interesting note of caramel maltiness enters midway through. Finish is resplendent with dry and earthy yeast, bitter hops, and a pleasant accent of fruity pineapple. Mad Bitch, indeed! This is a Tripel that is unashamed in its nakedness. Very assertive, featuring some challenging complexities. Not for the faint of heart."
" The mouthfeel is creamy, and well carbonated. The drinkability is good. This beer has a very clean finish."
"This is a very powerful beer and one will pretty much KO you. Very quickly in numbs the mouth and you wont be drinking a second bottle of this in a night. Far too powerful for a lunch beer. A special brew for special occasions, that limits its drinkability score."
"Thanks to biglove for the trade sample. Pours a hazy,somewhat darker then average golden color. Big head that slowly receedes. Yeasty and phenolic aroma. Flavor is very astringent and phenolic. A ton of spice in there-especially black pepper. Almost too much for me. Good enough mouthfeel-the high carbonation level makes it quite lively on the tongue. Overall I only find this to be an average triple. Too spicy in my opinion and the spices that are there are just overpowering."
"I think I'll pick up that bottle of the Dulle Teve special reserve that I saw at the store the other day."
"Conclusion: I'm sort of surprised to see other BA's talking about a sweet brew. I found this brew to be slightly dry & pleasantly bitter. Nevertheless; this is a very tasty tripel indeed, but man is this stuff strong. I'm off to bed."
"Mad Bitch is a fantastic tripel that has flavor and attitude to spare, yet is as cultured and as refined as the best of the style. If you've been searching for the beer equivalent of the wild party girl that you can take home to Mom, and who will charm the socks off her in the process, your search has ended with De Dolle Dulle Teve."
"A big bold flavourful strong ale, very good"
"A very good example of the style. Complex smells and flavors, smooth as hell, and one hell of an alcohol kick. What more could one want?"
"I remember having this (vaguely) a couple years ago at the Art Of Beer Festival, and I think I liked it. Out of the bottle it pours with an explosive amount of rocky head. Huge. Body is golden amber with yellow edges. Head is creamy dirty light tan. Big candy fruit aromas stand out. Sticky-sweet pineapple and sugar overshadow some bitter hops and resins. A little alcohol too, but not medicinal like Stille Nacht. Taste is, not surprisingly, all about the sweet malts. Candy apples and concentrated fruit cocktail syrup overmatch traces of pepper and hop bitterness. Thick, full mouthfeel that borders on too syrupy. Warming, alocoholic finish that luckily avoids being robitussin-like and cloying. I guess I prefer tripels that aren't so sweet, so this isn't my favorite. Still, it's heads and tails above Stille Nacht (blechh!)."
"Harsh and to be avoided in the future."
"This was very drinkable, which is dangerous given the amount of alcohol. I really enjoyed this brew, one of the tastiest Tripels I have had."
"If Belgian Tripels exploding with alcoholic flavor is your favorite category, this extreme tripel is a must taste."
"Taste is again lots of alcohol, sweetish candy but further dry. Some light maltarome but alcohol is mostly present. Aftertaste is moderate bitter in a forever staying alcoholbath. Mouthfeel is ok but alcohol and carbonation are IMO far too high. This hurts drinkability also enormous."
"I'd stick with the st. bernardus."
"Bottle. Probably shouldn't have tasted this straight after the Oerbier. Lovely hazy orange gold with a massive rocky white head which looked spectacular in my Duvel tulip. Orange peel and spicy alcohol dominate the aroma with acetyl notes and subtle hops in the background. Taste is dry and herbal, dominated by the warm alcoholic finish; the mad bitch definitely bites. Feel is good, but not up to the Oerbier."
"A fairly clean (spotted some tiny particles, Maybe from the cork)( OK it much more cloudier as you go thru the bottle) golden amber beer. Has a big spoonable white heat and a very good lace. There is a peppery spiceiness to the aroma. Along with a light sour apple note. Ther is a very prickely carbonation start to the taste. Followed by a dried fruit and fig character. The finish has the peppery hops with a tabacco note in the back."
"Bottle: Poured a murky brown color ale with a small off-white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma is spicy with some barnyard malt. Taste is somewhat spicy (honey, cloves?) with some notes of floral malt and light funky yeast. This is not bad but was expecting a bit more character and Im wondering if something was not wrong with this bottle, will have to re-rate that one."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Superbly creamy and delicious. Fine carbonation which fills the mouth and tickles the tonsils. De Dolle can do no wrong. Long Live De Dolle!"
"Pours a hazy peach with huge creamy white head and loads of lacing. Smells of peppery spices, juniper berries, and dry yeasts. Absolutely fabulous flavor and mouth-feel. Peppery and lemony initially, developing into strong alcohol-tinged juniper berries and finishing quite dry and effervescent. Very refreshing, with a long and tart finish. Alcohol very well integrated. I could drink plenty of these!"
"Sampled last weekend at the Map Room in Chicago. The beer poured a nice hazy golden color with 2 fingers of head that sits fluffy over the beer. The nose was somewhat apple sweet, but with a bit of sourness and a slight acidic tone as well. The flavor was so nice on this. The initial sour and tart flacors meld together with the fruity tones to make this one finish sometwhat like a sweet-tart candy. Nice. The feel was moderate, slightly creamy with a healthy bit of bubble. Solid beer. I could easily have drank this beer all night, but why when there were so many other choices..."
"poured from a corked 750ml bottle. this is a hazy honey color with a gigantic head. Yeasties are all around my beer, as I have noticed with other De Dolle brews. Aroma is of grassy hops and sweet candy maltiness, backed up by a good whiff of alcohol. Taste is delicate, yet very full. Lots of grassy hop flavor, backed by a very sweet maltiness, somewhat bicuity. The finish is loaded with bittering hops, and dries up the mouth nicely. Great mouthfeel - Full yet fluffy, almost leaving my tongue numb. If there is such a thing as a belgian IPA, this is it."
"1/8-inch creamy and tight head stuck for a good way throughout. Apple cider light brown hue with tons of chum looking closely it was possible to make out some action within. Clover honey, clotted cream, and some cinnamon on nose. Christmas pudding sweetness followed by a plum and raisin fruitiness and a flaky malt finish; also, a grape-like resin to the follow-up. A soothing offering overall."
"Lush creamy mouthfeel, drinkability is limited by it's ABV, and to be honest, it's a somewhat tough profile to get my arms around to want to drink this more than once in a while. I really like it, but want to save it for occasional times."
"Hazy peach. Turbulent - little yeast chunks caught up in the cyclone. Hugemongous eggshell head never subsides. Smells very faint, alcohol and nutmeg with a bit of almond and herbal dust. Flavor starts as sweet honey and slowly evolves into a leafy, peppery dryness. Wonderfully balanced and so silky smooth."
"Very drinkable. I never tired of this one and kept lamenting that my glass had less and less as I drank more an more."
"Drinkability: Why did I buy only one bottle?, This is fine brew, seek it out and enjoy"
"Cheers..."
"Beautiful appearance like always, yeast sediments a plenty at the bottom of a cloudy golden/honey body over which lies the typical, almost caricatural mountainous rocky/sticky white head. Expressive grassy (clover) nose with hints of alcohol, honey, hop perfume and cloves. Good malt base in mouth, but also a strong grassy and flowery hoppiness leading to a moderately bitter finish. Very creamy, spongy mouthfeel with usual De Dolle medium-high carbonation. Warming dry and slightly alcoholic finish. Solid, as expected, in the same vein of many tripels with a greater name, but I cant say its my favorite from the brewery. Once again, thanks to Boise pub crawler Sham. <br> A 750mL sample showed a lot of difference. Here the yeast was very dominating, musty while the malt was particularly candy-like. Spicy, full bodied, and well carbonated, but extreme level of yeastiness was perhaps too much.. not changing the score."
"This beer is a clear, orange-gold, awash with carbonation. Cloudy last pour. It has a commanding, solid, fleshy, white, 3-inch lid. Big, thick rings of lacing. The aroma is sweet, alcoholic, bready, soapy, spicy, buttery, fruity. It's everything. The beer starts spicy and bitter with some apple. It moves through a buttery phase: thick, fruity, malty and thick some more. It finishes bitter, floral, spicy with an alco kick. It's just really, really nice: buttery, spicy, fruity, alcy."
"Great accompanyment to our lunch. Pours incredible foam and leaves lace. Of course, wait for the foam to dissipitate. Light yellow, darker cloudy yellow at bottom. Somewhat spicy coriander orange citrus pale strong with substantial yeast. Has the bite to it. Easy on tongue."
"It is common at my local beer store to find, with some digging, older bottles with lower prices from days gone by stuck in back of the newer product. This comes in handy if you are looking for an aged bottle, or just a lower price. Digging into the very back of the Dulle Teve row in the cooler I happened across a partially moldy bottle that was $2 less than the front ones...bingo. Had it been there for months...years? No dates on the bottle. After cleaning some black crud from around the cap, I poured the nectar inside into my Duvel tulip. The beer was a hazed/cloudy vibrant golden-yellow-orange color, and was topped by a billowing tower of off-white head, which slowly settled down into a nice hilly blanket form. The nose was wonderful, with notes of fresh sweet/tart granny smith apples, intermingled with aromas of pineapple, citrus zest, stalks of lemongrass, and ancient mustiness. This was liberally accented with smooth coriander and a spicy hops. The moldy exterior was not detrimental to its taste either. I experienced potent honey/mead-like malts that warmed the throat while releasing excellent gewurtztraminner-grape flavors and notes of pineapple and cinnamon-clove-musty spices. The finish presented a nice pop of spiced dessert wine flavors and an excellent spicy bitter hoppiness. Alcohol was evident here but it melded perfectly with the flavors throughout. The body was creamy, smooth, silky, and a bit fluffy...working extremely well for the flavors and character of the beer. This tripel was a vibrant, delicous, and masterfully balanced flavor monster. This mad bitch is quite loveable, despite being a little unattractive on the outside!"
"Pitch the yeast if you will. I encourage you to do so. Throwing her that food will bring back a bit of the sweet fruitiness you loved to begin with. But don't mistake her true nature. She is mad. And at 10% ABV, she's got the equipment to *do* something about it. Beware!"
"Not too drinkable with this harshness, maybe a bad bottle??"
"Resembles a volcano with its pendulous white peak, shallow caldera, and substantial seismic activity in an underlying honey-colored core. Has fine suspended particles and cottony lacing. Nose is of wheat bread, lightly sweet malt, yeast, and only faint citrus and esters. Flavor is less citrusy than other tripels but quite tasty. Grainy malts lead here followed by some medium acidity in the finish and very late bitterness. Some orange flavor does come through after a few ounces. Nice stuff."
"75 cl capped bottle. No freshness dating and the bottle seems to be rather old because the cap and underside lip have some powdery mildew on it. The bottle didn't seem as full as other 75 centiliters, so I think excessive carbonation in storage forced some out, hence the mildew. Opened with a loud hiss, so it seems we're good to go. Pours a clouded golden yellow with a frothy, soapy light beige head leaving some tattered lacing. Sharp apple, malty, musty, honeysuckle and spicy aromas. Pungent alcohol warmth, orange citrus esters, cidery and malty and phenolically spicy at the same time, hops are there, too. Extremely bitter and dry finish after having a nice orangy, nutty, malty sweetness in the start. Good tasting tripel; my lord it's strong. I think I just felt the Mad Bitch pimp-slap me and demanded to know where her money's at. I think I got a bottle that had been jarred around too much during transport. The carbonation was fair, not explosive like I've noticed in other reviews. This only affected the mouthfeel, because a higher carbonation level would have cut the solvent-like alcohol burn a little better. I'll just have to be more careful in inspecting bottles before purchase in the future..."
"Immense multi-layered head with frothy, large bubbles at the base and fine meringue top. Lasted for ever, leaving beautiful lacing behind. Throughout my sampling this beer retained a small head. First nose was of floral hoppiness followed by hints of apricot and spice. Initial sip reveals...apricot, sweetness, some acidity followed by a wonderful warmness. Overtime I picked up spice, perhaps clove, white pepper? I also noticed a fleeting smokiness. A fairly thick, viscous beer helped to feal lighter by the the consistent presence of fine carbonation. Finish was long with a pronounced hop. As tripels go very decent, however, in my opinion the alcohol seemed a bit out of balance."
"11.2 ounce bottle. A nice beer, with quite a few things going on, but missing a bit of complexity."
"A complex and ever-changing flavor. Incredibly smooth and easy drinking. Agreat beer."
"Happy now, be back soon. Yum!"
"Sampled 4/30/04"
"Simply delightful in its flavor. Rich, sweet and spicy tripel/big belgian barley wine. Notes of pear, peach, banana and clove. This is a winner."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep gold color with four fingers of head that just keep growing and growning. A very carbonated beer, it takes about 10 minutes just to pour the entire bottle. There is lots and lots of lace chunks left on the glass. The smell is sweet and fruity, with granny smith apples and lemon coming through. A little bit of spices linger. I'm waiting for the head to die down enough for me to get to the sweet liquid. Wait for it, wait for it. Ok, we're there. The taste is good and malty, with lots of fruity sweetness. Some citrus, like lime, but also some white grape. Not many hops in sight. Ends with a slight alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and heavy. The drinkability is pretty good for a 10% brew as well. A nice tripel."
"The mouthfeel is medium. The flavor is OK with the ribs and that is quite a challenge. The tartness competes with the flavor of the meat. The medium body.... it works. Thanks to the family for continuing to brew."
"Drinkability is very good. Classic Trippel IMHO. Very spicy and alcholic, very tasty as it warms."
"This was a very tasty offering this week at Anam Cara. The pour was a cloudy goldenrod, topped with a frothy head that was reminiscent of whipped egg whites. The head died down a bit, but still stayed with me as I enjoyed this beer. I found the aroma spicey but muted, which I liked. Taste is also a bit spicey, with top citrus notes. I thought the beer had great full mouthfeel, with some slight bitterness in the finish. A well-made, very good example of the style. I new it was a big beer, and it hid that almost perfectly. Would get one again, but only one at a time."
"A mild astringent medicinal flavor enters as it warms."
"Glad I picked this one up. Just a great complex beer. Certainly not for the weak of palate."
"Very lively and highly enjoyable. A strong and flavorfully potent Trippel. I enjoyed this one."
"Damn Good."
"With a name like the mad bitch this beer had certainly better produce some results. The beer pours a hazy orange-gold color, and produces a prodigious white head. There is a lightly dusty, herbal, floral, and grassy aroma to this beer. It is sharp and herbal in taste, and is very well carbonated. It is lightly sweet with notes of honey and spices. It is almost spicy hot in character, quite interesting actually. This beer is definitely musty in character, it is like it has been lightly dusted with some pollen from a slightly astringent, yet floral flower. It is slightly lemony in character, with a hint of apple to it as well. The beer gets a bit sweeter as the copious amounts of carbonation starts to dissappear. There is also a nuttiness here in the middle of the beer, which adds to the complexity. I really like the interplay between the spiciness and the fruity sweetness, a very good balance that melds into an incredible beer."
"Cloudy dark gold w/ lots of sediment floating about. Highly aggressive, in-your-face taste dominated by hops and a good dose of yeast. Bitter and not for the faint of palate. A beer w/ tons of character."
"super looking tripel. thick, fluffy head that would not quit above a murkey,hazy golden amber beer. the aromas were well balanced yeast, malt, hop well balanced. I love de dolle yeast flavors, bright, thick & nutty. This beer tasted well balanced between the elements, good carbonation throughout. Elements of bread, spice, nuts, banana, pear, apple, clementine. All together another quality offering. I truly believe de dolle beers are great for introducing non BAs to flavorful origianl beers that do not overwhelm with overpowering oddball flavors. This beer does so as well"
"Served from a 750 ml green bottle with a cap and cork. This is the first time I've had a de Dolle beer from anything other than an 11.2 oz bottle. Thank god I had more than twice that amount to enjoy. The head was an absolutely huge, craggy white beast. It settled a bit but still looked like foam on a storm-ravaged sea. The smell is a bit alcholic, with lots of peppery spice and substantial tartness. Much is happening in the taste: spice, barnyard funk, grape, and cherry. It was a bit reminiscent of a nice Grappa. Despite a somewhat alcoholic blast in the smell, it's well-hidden in the taste, making it dangerously drinkable. Another winner from de Dolle."
"The beer after decanting a beclouded yellow orange with tons of dross and a rather substantial head that is creamy in consistency and an off white color, the lace forms a fine sheet to cover the glass. Earthy aroma of yeast, sweet malted grain, hints of pineapple, and a marvelous beer to sniff, start is ambrosial and thickly malted, top is fair to middling in feel. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hop powerful but pleasant in their spiciness, very dry and long lasting aftertaste with the 10 percent ABV, applying a bit of Belly Warming, a fine beer from a fine brewery, and one I see rarely for some reason."
"The highly charged fizz sound from popping the cap leads me to beleive this one's got some carbonation going. It pours out a murky looking golden orange tone. A huge, uniformly bubbled ivory white head graces the surface. It becomes rocky as it dissipates. Retetention is phenomenal. Aroma is yeasty and bready, fruity and alcoholic. And very much like cookie dough. Really a nice aroma. The mouthfeel is quite charged, but not so much I can't enjoy this nice Belgian beer. Body seems to be fairly light. The flavor is quite doughy. A little like rumcake. Yeastiness plays a big part in the overall flavor profile. Some fruity esters float about as well. Flavor has some nice spiciness to it as well. Pepper, nutmeg and cinamon. Overall a nice brew from a nice brewery."
"Now this was an interesting find I have to say,pours a hazy orange/yellow with big fluffy head that natyrally leaves some nice lacing.Aroma is lemony and a little musty with a sweet background.Really liked the different flavors I get from this beer very yeasty and slightly tart with a malty finish that lingers along with some alcohol notes.This beer is pretty dangerous because it seems almost to easy to drink with all that alcoholic punch."
"""You messed with the Mad Bitch!"""
"I will buy this again."
"Dry mouthfeel, full and warming body."
"This is a lively beer with a lot of character. Intense. Nothing laid back. I enjoyed much of the experience, but could not really get beyond some of the overpowering bitterness. Otherwise quite remarkable."
"Orange gold color. Large foamy white head. Aroma is fruity, spicy, and yeasty with a touch of mustiness. A medium bodied Belgian Triple. Fruity and spicy. Very fine champagne like carbonation. Orange, apricot, grapefruit, peach and vanilla flavors. Spicy and tart. Light and lively. There is a slightly alcohol bite at 10% but it not that noticeable. Damn interesting beer, as are most of the De Dolle brews. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet and very spicy."
"Comments - The Bros say to rate the beers using personal preferences and, personally, this is one of the best bottles that I have ever laid down."
"What a pleasant surprise. This tripel poured a yellow/orange hue with loads of foam and lace from start to finish.The smell was very fruity with a hint of malts. The taste was of a fruity nature with a soft, sweet maltiness. Rich and effervescent. Make sure you pour this tripel nice and slow or you'll have your glass full of bubbles. Again I'll repeat, Fruity aroma and a soft, sweet maltiness. Rich and effervescent."
"Impressive. Tenacious. Somewhat devastating. Defnitely a full-throttle beer that's only accessible to the initiated. Be prepared - this one will kick your ass! This is the beer to have when you're only having one!"
"Half tripel half artisanal strong pale ale, this was some whole other s#@t. A fine classic Belgian beer with Stone aggression and impact."
"F."
"Some beers do a great job of concealing their high amounts of alcohol. This brew is not one of them..."
"There is no beer with a more appropriate name than this."
"Wow, the cork just popped on this one after I took the cap off. She really must be mad. The head flowing out of it needed time to work down. After it calmed down, I was able to pour a cloudy gold beer with a nice bubbly white head that left some circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. There should've been, the way the cork exploded off. It had an aroma of citrus, clove and other spices. The flavor was of clove, a touch of anise with a slight smokiness and hint of the alcohol to it. The finish was a touch astrigent with elements of the smokiness. With the alcohol level present, this bitch could definately slap you silly."
"Clear and golden brew with a nice fine-bubbled white head.  Sweet, spicy smell - floral, a bit yeasty, and somewhat resembling bubblegum.  Oily, bitter hop taste, with notes of yeast and malt with some floral and fruity notes.  Fruit flavor becomes more prominent towards the finish.  Chewy and slightly rough mouthfeel.  I'll have it again soon."
"Bottle was a gusher!  Had to wait a few minutes before I was able to pour.  Hazy dark golden hue, w/ flowing currents of yeast.  The aggressive bubbling helps support a mountainous and overly thick head.  Candy sweetness combined with brash peppery hot alcohol hit the nose at first, then are ensued by ripe kiwi - like tropical fruitiness and light clove phenol.  Light yeast must is perceptible at the end of the aroma. As the beer breathes, alcohol notes fade, and the aroma takes on a florally sweet character.   An initial snap of honey sweetness in flavor is ensued by pleasant herbal melange of rosemary, star anise and clove, then a drying breadiness that offsets sweetness emerges mid palate. Now unhindered, peppery, lightly solvent like alcohol asserts itself into the flavor profile.  Once the initially furious carbonation mellows, the body is revealed to be moderate, w/ a dextrinous mouthfeel.  Black licorice surfaces towards the end of the taste and lingers into the finish, which is dry, heaty, lightly sweet and eeriely akin to the Italian liquor Uzo.  Wow.  Mad Bitch is so flavorful she almost overwhelmed my taste buds.  The alcohol flavors aren't masked and let you know that this a brew to be reckoned with.  Like other Dolle bros brews, this is a stylistic bastard, and is reminescent of a tripel on steroids. It's not at all like a Belgian Dark Strong."
"Notes: Knockout of a brew, triple in style with the hops taken up a notch or two. Big phenolic and fruit ester flavours splashing in the palate. Mad Bitch is right, this brew does a number on your tongue by slapping it around and telling it that the Mad Bitch is boss. ""Slap!", yes mam may I have another."
"Awesome Belgian Triple!!! Although it was a bit cloudy, I think that was due more to the fact that I had just received the shipment and I should have given it more time to settle. The aroma was good, slightly sweet and fruity. The flavor is INTENSE, everything you expect out of a triple along with a bit of a hop spiciness. The 10% alcohol presence adds to the intensity. A definite must try for all you Belgian beer lovers out there."
