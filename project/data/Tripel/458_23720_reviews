"Such a great tasting beer! On tap it's close to heaven"

"Disappearing head and minimal lace, light gold in color. Sweet dried fruit aroma. Sweet raisin and orange undertones. Good brew"
""

"Very nice beer. Not for the weak of heart"

""

"Disappointed by this one. Big fan of this brewery."
""
""
"Probably the best Texas beer I have ever tried! Very good taste given the high ABV"
""

"Very good drinkability for the ABV. My favorite real ale beer thus far"

"Great buzz, soft hop profile, more like an ale, but too pungent and sweet.  Not my cup of tea.  I'm more of a bitter IPA, RIPS fan.  Took about 3 to 4 bottles to get used to it.  No great, but not horrible.  Eh...."
""
"This is one of the better tripels that I've had."
""
""
"Nice combination of fruit and alcohol, with a decidedly sweet finish. It's definitely a Tripel, though not as rich and full as some of my other favorites, especially among the Belgians. Good enough, however, that I buy it when I can, and look forward to it year round. Great color and taste, but not quite as much head as I might like. Love to drink it on tap sometime: only had it from the bottle so far."
""
"Flowery nose; oily mouthfeel...definitely tastes like a tripel...alcohol fairly prominent...non-existent head, which was disappointing, although maybe it was a bit too chilled.  Pretty good tripel from one of the best brewers in South Texas."

"These words are true; this beer has a high ass ABV, with deceptively smooth flavor that can lead to severe drunkenness (comparable ABV beers such as Dogfish Head 90 Minute or New Belgium Rampant tend to remind me exactly how potent they are with their flavor intensity and thickness, while this brew goes down easy like a light beer but hits just as hard), and unique, smoky, crisp overtones that have serious nostalgic value for a guy who was raised in and has lived in Texas his whole life. Sipping this I am reminded of outdoor fire pits and the sensation of warmth in the winter. I seriously recommend this beer for anyone who has the opportunity to try it. It might be a little more expensive than some of the other Real Ale brews or a larger pack of lower quality beer, but trust me, it's worth it. If I could get paid to tattoo this beer's label across my back I would. Enjoyd"

"This is a staple in my beer fridge. I am lucky to live in Dripping Springs, Texas which is only a few miles from the brewery, located in Blanco. Real Ale makes fantastic brews (Fireman's 4 is another staple), and even though they are a very high quality house, we can get alot of their great stuff in just about any convenience store/gas station in the Hill Country. As a huge aficianado of Belgian Ales (especially Trippels - best in the world, IMHO), I had tried many so called craft ""Belgian Trippels"" before with usually great disappointment, but I was blown away by this one when Real Ale introduced it in 2010 - they got it right, and they have kept on doing that!"

"A bit of background: this beer has been aged approx. 7 months. There is a listed warning to drink by 3/29/14. It is currently July 2014. Usually there is not a 'sell-by' date on beer, and one can usually age Belgian beer many years if desired. Therefore, not a true Belgian beer, but an attempt on the style."

"This had potential. Even with the wild, all over the place aroma, it still could have locked in to be a good brew. The flavor starts that way, than... poof. Gone. It's just too watery in both mouthfeel and especially the end of the drink to rate it too highly. Close, but no cigar. Or beer, for that matter."

"O: Pretty good Tripel example, maybe a bit too hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- A pretty nice American take on a tripel that had a lot of character, but the booze came through pretty prominently even for the style."

""
""
"I always love a good Belgian Tripel and this is a great Texas example of the style. It is a light golden color that deceptively hides its high alcohol content, but while the color is light, there is nothing light about the taste. It has all the signature Belgian yeast notes with some spicing and a slight hop to help balance out the flavors. It has a robust mouthfeel with a smooth balanced finish. This is a solid Tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not terribly impressive. Maybe I have a bad bottle on my hands? I'd like to think so. I get some tripel-type flavors, but the bitterness really usurps the whole experience. Frankly, I'm surprised by some of the scores on this one..."
""
"O - While it is a timid tripel, I found it enjoyable. The banana and Belgian yeast spiciness were complimentary and refreshing."
""
"O: A really good, drinkable Belgian style beer."
""
""
""

""
""

"Low C-"
""

"That said, what I like about this beer is the price. High ABV for the same price as the other offerings of Real Ale. It definitely is a good nightcap kind of beer."

"O: great change-of-pace brew with all of the major key notes of a tripel. wine-drinkers would love this brew."
""
""
"It's tasty. I don't personally think it's RABC's best, but then they have made quite a few beers that I really enjoy, so it's a bit hard to choose. OK it's still a tie between four squared and altbier, if you force me to tell. But the Devil's backbone is pretty good too."

"Being a huge fan of Belgian Ales, from this golden style to a deep, dark divinity like Chimay Grande Reserve, this one is right up my alley. The hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste is not strong like an IPA, somwhere around 35 IBUs? Poured from a bottle into a 16oz, short bell-shaped glass with handle. Color is a beautiful goldenrod, and smell is fruity, like subdued bananas and sweet malts. Feeling on the tongue and palate is thicker than wheat beer, but nowhere near amber or dark Belgian ale. Head dissipates very quickly in such a wide-mouth glass, and barely lasts 3min in a thin, fluted glass. No matter, because if you like a little bitter with your golden cream, then this is a beer for your roster. I give it a 4/5 because it lacks a little in complexity, though there are spices noted throughout the tasting experience. I will definitely buy again, as it delivers a simple Tripel experience without the Belgian Tripel price. A very Americanized version of a classic, this one is good for advocates to become acquainted with the heavier Belgian styles. Excellent for a sweet tooth, and quite refreshing!"

"Overall: Very nice drink. It's almost *too* deceiving because three of these will get me woozy. I would never think that this was 8% from how smooth it goes down. One of the more tasty beers from Real Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite the tang on this one. Somehow it works well enough, but it's not really bringing balance or a level of complexity that keeps it interesting. I think I can sum if up by saying that it's pretty one dimensional. And frankly, this is what Belgian styles of yesteryear tasted like when coming out of the U.S."
""
""
""
""
""
"I drank this fairly warm and picked up slight alcohol vapors and flavor which provided a nice warming sensation. Could use a bit more carbonation. Pretty nice tripel overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice example of the style. I thoroughly enjoyed this and found it a notch or two better than the Dick's Belgian Tripel (Centralia, WA) which I also had the same night."

"O: a decent tripel overall. A bit heavy and not as balanced as I'd like, but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"drinking this one from the bottle seems to add to the style. Pouring it into a tulip is all well and good, however theres just something special about drinking straight from the bottle. It tones down the fruitiness and alcohol taste. This beer needs to be reviewed by the bros for sure."
""
""
"Good flavor, nice blend."
"Not bad, especially if you aren't familiar with the true Belgians."
""
""
""
""
"Thoroughly pleasant brew that may not be a world class Tripel, but it does credit to the style. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Pinkie's in San Angelo, Texas."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very drinkable a pleasant beer, albeit deceivingly high in ABV. Grab one on tap if you can."
"Got from Total Wine in Dallas. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer; it's by far the best I've had from Real Ale. A sweet start is topped off my a nice spicy, semi-smokey finish that perfectly masks the ~8% ABV. It is classified as a abbey style tripel, however it's not really like any style beer I've ever had before."
""
""
""
"O: Wouldn't be my first choice for this style but it definitely gets the job done."

"You can certainly taste and feel the alcohol up front. There is some citrus fruit taste to me, but not overpowering. A bit of bitterness at the finish. I'm really starting to like Real Ale Brewing Company."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth and creamy, somewhat bitter and peppery. Lingering dry aftertaste. Vague fruitiness thats hard to pin down, though orange and apricot come to mind. PLenty yeasty and phenolic in the taste, following the aroma. Seems pretty solid, a textbook tripel."
"Is it a decent beer? Compared to big brew, yeah. Compared to other lines from Real Ale, it's average."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of hops, alcohol, slight yeast, sweet malt, hint of citrus, and subtle spice. Fits the style of a Tripel. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol foremost, citrus, sweet malt, slight yeast, spice, and a hint of hops. Overall, good body, blend, and aroma."

"#BOTG 72. This is a local brew that I shamefully haven't ever tried before. Thanks to my boy Brandon for sharing this with me. Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. fluffy, white head doesn't recede much, and billowing amounts of carbonation flow off the bottom of this crystal clear burnt orange colored beer after I get it in the glass. Really nice looking. Smell- honey, burnt caramel, candied sugar, spices on the end. Nice. Taste- hmm. I got a mouth full of spices- maybe nutmeg, cinnamon in there. Some sweetness behind it, but what I didn't get that I was really expecting was that honey/burnt caramel flavor that I got on the aroma. This actually has a fair amount of bitterness on it, and doesn't have that big backbone that you would expect to get from a tripel. Regardless, this is a solid brew, one that I would have again. One of the great things about the #rootrootdrink challenge is being forced to try new beers, and this is a nice outcome- finding a local beer that you've passed over before that is really pretty good."

"Good carbonation, and quite drinkable. Check it out if you like tripels and belgians, but if you tend to shy away from them, this may not be for you."
""
"spiced seasonal and having said that I think I like this better."
""
""
"The appearance is clear gold with white head. Head disappears quickly and leaves minimal lacing. The nose is full of ripe banana and mild waves of clove. There is also a bit of honey and lemon present. The taste is sweet up front with grape, banana and lemon. Spicy cloves balance out the sweetness nicely. The body is some what big and the carbonation is low. Overall, this is a great American tripel with lots of delicate banana flavor."
""
""
""
"Very nice job on a Tripel from a good Texas brewery."
""
""
""
""

"Tastes light and delicate, with a lot of nuanced estery flavor I pictured lavender fields with a touch of honey at the end. Delicious."

"Overall Impression- For my 1st brew from Real Ale, I may need to go back to TX to live again and see what other brews they offer from all their breweries! This Tripel was great and very complexed! I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a great example of this style or would like to have a fully complexed beer with tons of malt, sweetness, and spice."

"12oz bottle sent to me by somebody here but I forgot your name, thanks man. Light golden yellow color with a couple wisps of bubbles atop, looks good. Smells bready and estery, a little banana. The taste is good but subtle, some sweetness, some yeast and esters, very little alcohol in the taste. Overall this was pretty decent and I don't usually like American tripels."
"Atmosphere is good. Deep golden appearance, but not much head or lacing to speak of. Nose, however, is a good combination of grains and citrus. Flavor is hoppy, grainy, with sweet and fruit tones. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"D ~ Great American Tripel in 6-pack format? More breweries need to be doing this. Dangerously easy to drink. Would love to have one at the peak of freshness to taste a greater hop profile. Big ups to Brad for this want!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"O: Could have used a lot more carbonation and significantly more flavor."
"The bottle claims this as a seasonal, the back of the bottle says ""Keep Cold"" and ""Drink Soon"" at the bottom. Thought that was funny."
"O - Very impressed. One of the best pure tripels I've had."
"Pretty good beer. Without that earth-tinge, this would be a very good tripel, but that muddiness really does the taste no favors."
"O: I loved this beer. It was very balanced and there was just enough funk and tartness in the taste to keep my interested and coming back for more. I recommend."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one with the aroma and tastes just so harmonisously balanced. As a side note I bought a sixer in Houston at Spec's for 8.50. Above average Trippel and worthy of a visit."
"Overall is a god beer. I really liked this."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a clear gold with a white head that lasts throughout the beer and laces nicely. Aroma has a strong sweet fruit and floral note with some candied sugar and sweet grains. Flavor is a bit more mellow with a semi sweet grain start that becomes sweeter with candied sugar and light fruits. Drinks lightly which is nice and refreshing. Medium bodied mouthability."
"Overall, although not the be-all, end-all of tripels(obviously there are better out there), still a very solid interpretation that I would highly recommend, and definately pick up again. Very impressed with the complexities of this Real Ale offering."
"Well, I think anyone who drinks this can tell it's not brewed in Belgium, however, that's not a knock. It's not exactly like I remember other tripels but this is still a good beer. And I appreciate its 9% ABV without it really being prominent. For a hot Texas summer, this is a good pick for a more complex yet drinkable beer with a little more booze than normal. Like I said, at $9.99 for a six pack of a good tripel, I don't see how anyone wouldn't recommend this."
"6.2/10"
"It’s pretty good for a Tripel."
"EDIT: this beer is not good, it actually sucks sorry if i sent someone an extra of this, my mind was clouded. 9/21/11"
"4.5 D: I liked this a lot because it's the first tripel I've had in a while that is this clean. Love the spiciness as well."
"It pours a hazy golden yellow with a soapy white head that left just a little lacing. The smell consists of lemon, wheat and candisugar with a hint of black pepper. The taste is mostly sour lemon and wheat there is some candy flavor, spicy hops and it's slightly tart and alcoholic. This beer is smooth as silk with a medium body, perfect carbonation and a dry finish. I'm not a fan of tripels but this is my favorite one so far."
"Overall- Very nice strong beer from Real Ale. A must for summer in Texas. If drinking the 6er solo do it at home, it sneaks up on you."
"O - A very easy to drink tripel. The ABV is not noticeable at all and the strong flavour profile makes this one a pleasure. Highly recommended, one of my favourite seasonals from Real Ale."
"Love it. Neck and neck with LFDM. Big ups to Blanco!"
"O: Not on the same level as Allagash's Tripel, but a good beer none the less and at a fraction of the price!"
"Overall it was not bad, alothough I have had much better."
"A clear golden in appearance with a creamy white head. Smells strongly of ethyl alcohol and a hint of banana. Taste is initially candy sweetness, followed by a spicy yeast character, then a neutral bitterness and a bit of grainy wheat. Alcohol is detectable. Mouthfeel is full, smooth carbonation. Overall a good tripel, tho a bit boozy for my tastes."
"Overall-Great beer. Theres not many tripels that I buy on a regular basis but this one would be if it wasn't a seasonal brew. Real Ale continues to put out some very nice limited beers, too bad there rotation beers suck."
"Poured into a tulip. The beer is dark gold in color with a white two finger head. There isn't much head retention but there is some lacing. There is lot of Belgium yeast in the nose along with a trade mark Belgium spiciness. There is also plenty of candy sugar and malts along with some very present alcohol. Taste is pretty mild considering the aromatics. There are mild malts and grains up front along with floral hops. Through the middle to the finish you get Belgium sugar, spices, and bready yeast. The alcohol is still present although more toned down. The mouth feel is excellent. It's smooth, easy, and the carbonation seems to be just right. Overall this is a very well crafted American version of the Tripel style. I always look forward to this release."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Thanks, FreeVerse, for the opportunity"
"D: it was drinking average cause the booze was definitely there on the taste but was a solid tripel IMO."
"D: I liked this beer and I would enjoy working through a six-pack but in the world of tripels, this probably fits somewhere in the second tier."
"Opinion: I was really anxious to like this beer, but I can't say that I do with regards to style. As with so many other American breweries that try to make Tripels, I have to try to convince myself that they are Quadrupels instead so I can let my brain get over the style-guidelines and rate the beer on how it tastes. As a Tripel, this beer leaves a whole lot to be desired from the hops to the attenuation, but as a open-ended Quad, the beer is pretty decent. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer again, but I am not going to have a problem deciding between the St. Bernardus Tripel or this one...I will just drink this one because it is a decent high-gravity beer by one of Texas's bigger Micros."
"D - It took me much longer to work through my 6oz than it did for Mike - I think I ended up pouring out a bit. I wouldn't bother with this one again."
"D - Average drinkability and average beer for the style. Interesting name and location, but just good for a one time drink."
"I think if this bottle came from Belgium it'd have higher reviews. This was a very well put together beer by Real Ale."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a fizzy head that fades too fast. Then no lacing no head, no ring. Smells like a cross between a triple and saison. A little fruity, pears, and a little straw and grass. The taste is slightly fruity, kinda dry, and a bit spicy. Some peppery notes, some noble hops come through but all in all its muddled. Mouthfeel is kinda one dimensional, prickly and a little sharp. It drinks ok. While a tasty beer it was imho a poor example of a triple. I thought it tended more towards saison."
"Pours a golden color with a nice white head and a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose brings some slight spice and Belgian yeast as well as a bit of citrus and some light fruits. Taste is a bit of pale spice and light fruit. A good dose of alcohol in there as well. Feel is slightly spicy and boozy with a good body. Drinks fairly well and is better than the blonde I had from them, but perhaps needs a bit of time to mellow."
"D. A friend brought this back from a trip to Texas. While he really enjoyed it, I can't get over the alcohol taste on swallow."
"D - Not a bad tripel overall and it actually goes down very easily...maybe too easily. I guess I expect a little more alcohol bite, flavor/spicey intensity, warmth/heat and this is just a bit too tame for a tripel. Tripels are usually more of a sipping style for me but this one demands big gulps and disappears quite rapidly."
"Best domestic tripel I have ever drunk. Not quite as good as La Fin Du Monde, but given the price difference I may have to switch! A ton of flavor, hops aren't overwhelming but you can definately taste 'em. Not a beer to mess around with due to its alcoholic content (8.1%) but I am glad to be trying it. Real Ale is making Texas residents like myself proud."
"Thanks Marc. Poured a bright clear gold with a huge, pillowy white head. Sweet, Belgian yeast, some tropical fruits, but dominated by a kind of charred character that clashes badly with the yeasty elements. Quite hot, almost vodka-like on the finish. Maybe a spoiled bottle, couldn't really finish this."
"http://1yob.com/post/939341902/backbone"
"Notes - In my opinion, this is the best Texas beer out of a commercial brewery. We once did a tasting between this and Fin du Monde, and it was pretty much neck and neck. If you like tripels and you get the chance to try this one, go for it. You won't regret it."
"Overall, this beer is just okay. It doesn't have any standout qualities and it's flavor didn't impress me."
"Conclusion, I liked this one and would defiantly have it again. So far this has been my favorite from Real Ale and I would choose this one over New Belgium Trippel w/Coriander. I thought this was a pretty good American take on a Belgian Tripel. There's still room for improvement, but this would be a great introductory beer to someone interested in exploring Belgian style ales."
"Poured into an oversize wine glass, this settles a foggy yellow golden color with bright yellow highlights under a quickly diminishing bubbly head. A floral bouquet fills the nose with hints of candied sugar, pumpkin pepper spice, and lemon. This opens up with a lively and spicy big tart taste that makes way to a juicy, huge, delicious, full-flavored, malty center and burnt sugar follow through. By the sip, this slowly goes from being an aggressive brew on the palate to a smooth and complex treat that I particularly enjoyed with Prosciutto de Parma."
"Pours a hazy blood orange - yellow - gold, small head with some lacing. Not particularly spicy smelling, some nice sweet malts and light fruits like apricots and pears. Taste is similarly sweet but enjoyable, pears and other light fruits. Mouthfeel is good and only slightly thin, nice slightly creamy carbonation. Good drinkability. Seems like a cross between a trippel with some bananas and cloves."
"Very nice beer from the folks at Real Ale..."
"D- Good. High alcohol content, but I like how well Real Ale covered this. I can't wait to try it on tap next spring."
"Devil's Backbone, eh? Sounds sinister. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose banana, clove, pepper, rye bread, lemon zest, and a touch of citrus hops. The taste is similar, though with a heavier tilt toward those hops. As such, the citrus-y bitterness, not unlike an orange rind, is quite pronounced, driving the yeast-y and spicy notes underground, popping up only when able (or when crime is afoot...Turtle Power!). The body is fairly light, with an active carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a solid tripel, a bit heavy on the bitters for me, but not enough to ruin things. Worth a try for sure."
"An excellent Triple. I have always enjoyed this on tap when the season came. I am so happy this is now bottled. I think it is even better out of the bottle (which is the only reason I am doing a second review). Probably the best American version I have had of the style. Again, well done Real Ale."
"This is a mouthful of of just a different combos of spices and sort of a hint of banana cream. At first sip it is great then after a 3rd or even 5th sip you sense the alcohol taste and somewhat of a sting to your cheeks and gums. Its a drink you know the alcohol is there, but still is a great drink to chill with the friends not something I can handle all night and just chug."
"Poured into a Westmalle Chalice hazy Golden Yellow with a thin white head, decent lacing. The scent isn't too strong, but the belgian yeast is very noticable. The taste has the rather smooth Saaz hop bitterness and that candy sugar mixed in with that strong belgian yeast giving a citrus flavor. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and leaves a sting to your cheeks. Might be something that could mellow out with age."
"D: I really like this tripel. It may not be the best representation of the style, but Texas doesn't have too many Belgian's...this beer surprised me as it is actually good!"
"D - I've heard this described as a hybrid between an Tripel and a Hefeweizen, and I'm inclined to agree; the fruity, banana flavors that I typically associate with Hefes are present here. It's a solid beer, but Hefes are one of my least favorite beers, so that knocks it down a bit."
"I'd like the alcohol toned down a bit. It was just a little too obvious in very aspect."
"I've only had a couple of beers from Real Ale and I've been pretty impressed with both. The low carbonation takes away from this one but it's not a bad attempt at a tripel."
"D- The alcohol is hard to find- the perfect body and funky yeast covers it all up."
"D - This is a nice attempt at a Belgian-style brew; not entirely successful, but fairly enjoyable regardless."
"Flat out didn't enjoy this."
"d - A decent tripel. I thought it smelled very good but wasn't as big a fan of the taste. Would give another shot."
"My favorite of their special/seasonal offerings so far."
"Cheers!"
"Hazy golden in color with a thin but active white head that leaves lacing right off the bat. Smells of peaches, lemons, and pepper. Taste is sharp and citrusy up front, then has a dusty malty carob-y thing that takes over. It finishes dry and sharp, with just enough of that dusty finish to make you want more. The aftertaste is a touch metallic and bitter, not at all what you get from the rest of the taste profile. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and slippery, it stands up & fights back. Drinkability is good, though limited by the aftertaste. Very good, but not great. That being said, one I would buy again and I'm very excited to see some local breweries branching out beyond the standard IPA/brown/blonde/pale ale offering."
"Verdict: Devil's Backbone is a solid American Tripel, but fails to really grab me. It's just a little too muddled and leafy for my tastes."
"Godd drinkability. I don't think I could drink it all night but two or three would be a good start."
"Drinkability: I think this is a decent brew and a step in the right direction for RA, as I feel their beers leave a lot to be desired. Not the best tripel, but tasty and moderately priced. I would get again, but not in a rush."
"It is pretty drinkable imo though I wouldn't want to have more than on e of these and will not be buying more. But thanks for the offering and the privilage to try this good Real Ale."
"The beer pours a clear medium yellow color with a white head, which quickly disappears. The aroma is very fruity with lemons, oranges, pears and mangoes with alcohol, coriander and candi-sugar. The flavor is lemon, peach, oranges and pears with yeast, candi-sugar and spices. The spices are pepper and coriander. Medium mouthfeel and a medium carbonation."
"Not that much complexity, but it's very enjoyable and at a resonable price. On par with Golden Monkey, but a notch below LFdM & Westmalle Tripel."
"Overall I thought this was a nice tripel but would have liked more complexity. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Not a horrible beer but really hard to get down."
"D - quite drinkable. It will sneak up on you if you aren't careful"
"The 2010 Backbone is great. The aroma is clean and fruity (pears, grapes, honey). It's a gorgeous translucent (almost opaque) amber in appearance, like clover honey. The head dissipates fairly quickly, with a bit of lace clinging to the glass and around the edges of the beer. It's very drinkable, even in a month or two when it's going to be warm here in Austin...dry, spicy, fruity finish. Yum, guys!"
"D: A very strong effort out of Blanco, TX. I am always leary of Tripels that are outside of the Trappist traditions, but this is great. I will concede a local bias, though."
"Taste is a pungent and tasty mix of fruit flavors, candy sugar, and a touch of hops. Hop and alcohol notes are detectable, but almost entirely concealed by the standard tripel flavor. The finish is just a touch bitter, however, which wasn't expected. Mouthfeel is probably the standout area, as Devil's Backbone has a rich and creamy body that is more substantial than I've ever tasted in a tripel. The strength of flavor and ABV limit drinkability a touch, but this is definitely an enjoyable beer!"
"The flavor starts well enough with some doughy pale malts and cracker crust. A quick kiss of spices, light fruits, and floral hops drop out of the middle. Could stand to be a bit sweeter, especially in the finish, where the bitterness gets acerbic and slightly harsh with booze. Body is on the chewy side of medium, with a nice carbonation level, but the aftertaste causes the mouthfeel to be taken down a notch...drinkability, too. Still, a well-crafted American tripel, and one that would probably cellar well if it were bottled."
"Silky smooth and creamy sweet malts! Lightly caramel with loads of alcohol and a nice crisp bittering finish. The mouthfeel on this beer is exceptional. With maybe 6-12 months, the flavors would meld together perfectly. It is really good now, but the individual components are a bit dramatic. Very good tripel, put this in a bottle please!"
"at 4.75 a pint it was a tad expensive for me, but in the end it was definately worth shelling out the extra cash for the beer. gave me that droopy eyed feeling after a very short amount of time"
"Pours a light amber with a thick head that reduces to fingers then a rim. Smells more of hops than it tastes, with a hint of sweetness. Tastes rich and sharp with lots of amber malt in there. Some complex tastes are hiding in the back, and it has a great aftertaste, combined with sharpness from the alcohol up front. Feels thinner than I'd expect from a tripel, with some cut from the alcohol. Overall fairly better than average."
"I sampled this at the brewery. It's nothing out of the ordinary, but tasted smooth and like I expect a tripel to taste. It was slightly less sweet than anticipated with a very gentle amount of carbonation. Of the 5 or 6 beers I've had from this brewery all have been above average. The workers at the brewery are friendly and the tour was great."
"Pours a pale cloudy body, with some foamy head, dIminishing. Has a belgiany sweet aroma, flowery. Smells good. Light taste, flowery, belgiany. Clean aftertaste. Warming up...a lot of spices. Tasty. Very good."
"D - Very enjoyable and a solid representation of the style."
"M/D- Creamy and soft texture. Easy to drink. I didn't notice the alcohol."
"In appearance, this is a burnished golden color with a moderate head of foam on top. The nose is spicy with a light fruity sweetness. Malt is moderate in the taste, accompanied by a lot of phenolic yeastiness. Moderate fruity character as well, maybe a hint of sweet citrus. Bitterness is restrained. The strength sneaks up on you at the end."
"Pours golden with a light white head. Smell is spiced yeast and malt. Very fruity and spicy. Taste is dryish but sweet and flavorful. Spiced estery, yeasty character, medium bodied with average carbonation and somewhat sweet for the style. Well made beer."
"had on my lunch break and the next night at BoonDoggles... Lots of fruit, bubblegum, and other similar aroma's .... fruit and candy in the taste, very very delicious stuff.. Another fine beer from the true brewing professionals up in Blanco.. This was a pleasure to drink!! A wonderful tripel that I wish more people could try!!"
"There's a quaint wheatiness that reminds me of a witbier. This is a lighter, softer tripel than I'm used to. No wild and zany phenolic fun, but oh well, it's tasty."
"D: Hella drinkable for a tripel. It is pretty cool that such a fine triple is being made right here in TX!"
"A pleasure to enjoy and savor-strength and weight make this a great sipper"
"It was a hazy orange-copper beneath a full head of off-white froth. The head held well, and it left beautiful creamy walls of lace in its wake. The nose was honeyish and spicy with a bit of alcohol and some phenols that left it perfumey. The mouthfeel was bristling with tiny-bubbled effervescence, and it was medium in body. The flavor followed the lead of the aroma, but added in an orange/citrus side that was unexpeceted. The rye was clear, and it's peppery edge cut through nicely. The bitterness was moderate, as it should have been, with the spiciness of the rye and alcohol keeping it dry. It finished honeyish and dry, with lingering notes of black pepper and phenolics. It's a sipper for sure, and a pint of it during a party was not the way to really enjoy this beer. I'd much rather have had it in a quiet setting as a sipping beer. Still, I enjoyed it nonetheless, but I went back for a pale ale instead. Interesting and enjoyable."
"Pours a bright golden color with a bit of an orange sunrise hue and a creamy white head. Nose is floral honeysuckle along with some Belgian spice and a hint of perfume. Taste begins with fruity orange citrus (and maybe a bit of pineapple?) and honey malt followed by some biscuity notes and a bit of clove. A thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"astringent bite with some spice to it. The aroma is complex, with sweet competing with astringent."
"Notes: Color is off, not enough belgian funk to it. Needed to have more spicyness and possibly a little thiner on the body. Its very drinkable, but I'm not sure if this qualifies as a tripel."
