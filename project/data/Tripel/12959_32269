Yeast driven fruity palate – large pitted fruits with touches of citrus on a light malt backbone with a hop accent on the finish.  A hint of cardamom and herbs.

Dry finish with a very mellow alcohol bite. Reminds me of golden monkey a bit in its simplicity but it's dangerous drinkability . On that note though I do like it better as there's a bit more balance rather than the super dry after taste that golden monkey has.

Some decent lacing clings to the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge lemon zest, clove, orange zest, pear, pepper, grass, light biscuit, and yeast spices. Damn nice big citrus forward aromas. Taste of big lemon zest, pear, pineapple, apricot, orange, pepper, clove, grass, biscuit, tart grain, and spicy yeast. Lingering notes of citrus, pepper, pear, yeast spices, tart grain, and clove on the finish for a while. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that drinks pretty easily for being 10%. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden; with hardly any warming on the finish noticed.

Moderately hoppy with some fruity aromatics, I also get some honey, plenty of fruit character from the yeast and a touch of bread. The hops lend a bitterness, while the yeast adds a fresh blend of apples, pears and stone fruit. The palate opens fresh and fruity, with all pears and peaches making this seem bright and vibrant. A bready, mildly straw-like malt character is present, along with a noticeable honey character. Towards the end of my pour, I get a little more of the phenolic character from the yeast. Drying and mildly bitter on the finish with a touch of alcohol, this beer is medium-light in body, with a soft, smooth carbonation.

Really hoppy aroma of citrus. I have a hard time detecting any Belgian qualities in the aroma. Pale malt is the only other player in the aroma. It does smell inviting with the American hops. These American hops dominate the flavor and that hurts the overall score of this beer. The Belgian malt and yeast do their best to overcome the hops but fall short of doing something great. The Belgian qualities do make their appearance near the finish with some nice clove and vinous qualities. Bitterness is very high for a tripel but knowing this is an American intrerpation of the style, it seems appropriate. Medium body with peppy carbonation helps lift this hoppy beer. Overall this beer is a little too hoppy with American hops to work. But at the same time those hops are quite flavorfull and adds it's own charactor.","morimech","Nov 29, 2010"

It drinks as a pretty simple beer, which is why even if I blur style guidelines in my mind it still is just a good one and doesn't really come very close to being great.

3.68,-8.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"Cheers to Cuzco for sending this bottle along. The beer pours a nice golden yellow. The fluffy white cap is initially impressive (3 fingers or so) and leaves plenty of lace, but retention is poor. The nose is primarily of lemon/orange citrus notes from the hops, with some clove and traditional yeast spiciness there as well. The taste is largely a blend of the same, and the problem with both is that the balance is too far tilited towards the hops. The bottle refers itself as an ""American Tripel"" and the beer is just a little too much American hops and not enough traditional Belgian tripel flavor to live up to its billing. The beer has a nice body to it, suitably creamy, but it's noticeably undercarbonated. The best thing this beer has going for it is its drinkability, as the hops are focused on flavor rather than bitterness and the alcohol doesn't have much in the way of a presence. I appreciate what Captain Lawrence was going for, but for my money they went to far in mixing American hops and Belgian style.","axeman9182","May 22, 2010"

Age has taken edge off the hop bitterness but the hops are still much more present than expected for the style and provide some of the sweetness. Flavors of ripe fruit, apple, pear, lime, some tropical flavors and a lingering dry and sweet finish. Hard to get an objective take on the body and mouthfeel with the extremely sharp, fine carbonation. Alcohol is still present and warming throughout even with the at least year age.

Poured 80% head - thick, foamy, rocky and bright white. Head eventually settles into a consistent quarter inch cap with delicate, fluffy strands of lacing exposed as the brew recedes. Color was translucent orange-gold with quite a bit of effervescence evident in solution. Nose revealed citrus, yeast, perhaps a hint of candi sugar and lemon zest. Taste consistent with nose - lacking some of the sweetness that I've come to associate with the style with perhaps a touch of hops bittering in the mix. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation level just shy of lively. Some astringency and fairly dry finishing. Pretty delicious tripel and top notch on draft. Lacking some of the sweetness typical of the style, but I actually think that enhances its drinkability.","Jwale73","Nov 01, 2009"

Poured into a matching pair of basic tulip glasses. The tripel appears a crystal clear rich golden yellow color with at least two fingers of fluffy, cloud-like off white foam. The nose and flavor consist of fresh citrus hops such as tangerine and orange, tropical fruits, melon, apples, spicy yeast, great sweet malt balance, a bit of black pepper, and some white grapes. An awesome, hoppy American tripel. The ale is just as good with some time in the cellar. A notch or two better than medium in body with ample carbonation. Surprisingly drinkable given the high ABV.

It's more crisp (and fresh) with juicy citrus hops rounding out a more traditional spice and pepper malt and yeast flavor. Sometimes US brewers try to put their own American spin on a Belgian, but the beer just comes out too plain, this beer doesn't do any of that.

It has a very nice pale malt flavor that's warming. The yeast adds a ton of character. It has an awesome fruitiness with a dry earthy finish. It's also quite bitter.

It's so unusual, and changing, that my written notes are in a mess. It's one of those that I like more for its uniqueness/inventiveness that ""works"" than as something I would regularly purchase.

Smell is pretty hoppy up front, I guess that's why Scott calls it an ""American Tripel"". Sweet grapefruit, honey, and yeast in the nose to begin with. Some apple and pear combined with faint pepper and spice as well. Sweet fruit flavors consisting of pear, tangerine, and white grapes at first. Midway the bread-like characteristics emerge with the yeasts and pale malts. Aftertaste is a touch dry with honey, grapefruit, lemongrass and lingering alcohol. Best tasting Tripel that I have experienced by far. Soft medium body with a pleasant carbonation. The 10% abv is hidden extremely well, be careful with this one. I'm not a fan of the style and I haven't tried too many, but this is by far the best overall Tripel I've sampled. I'm thinking because it's hopped up, but hey, that's the hophead in me.

The aroma is of sweet tropical fruit, light lemon, tart apple, and booze. The taste starts off with a quick shot of bitter hops which is quickly neutralized by a sugary lemon sweetnes and tart apple. The brew also has a tin like metal flavor. The feel is moderate and quite fizzy, there is a good balance between bitter and sweet; finishes with a slight belly burn.

The smell was very spritzy with citrus and lemon-like nuances... this has to be one of the most authentic Belgian-like brews I have come across or tried that have actually been American-made... the taste is very similar to many Fantome beers that I have sampled with an apparent champagne-like characteristic, and pepper-essence and less of the sweet, candied flavors that are in other depictions of the style.. Mouthfeel was very thick, rich, and creamy with a candied-flavor certainly noticeable... drinkability was good, and the alcohol is hard to detect behind an amazing conglomeration of rich flavors... it only took a hit due to the hefty 10% ABV... otherwise, an outstanding brew...

4.12,2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Wonderful citrus nose and flavor. Sweet taste upfront with a pleasantly bitter taste on the back end. Lots of grapefruit taste. Very interesting beer. Alcohol taste was a bit too present. A very unique beer, definitely worth trying. I will be on the look out for other dank beers from this fine captain.","tendermorsel","0"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3"" off-white head above 1"" of clear burnished golden brew. Head is big bubbled and fades gradually, with heavy thick lacing, and lots of it. Aroma is sweet, spicy, and lightly citric. Taste is malt sweetness upfront, dpicing in the middle, and a warming alcohol close that radiates down the throat as it goes. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, and drinkability is on par with the style. Not liking this one quite as much as the first time around, but still a good tip.","ppoitras","Jul 19, 2007"
4.08,1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Belgian style IPA or American tripel, it boils down to a basic brew that's blended enough to come off as nicely complex. The hops and yeast are interesting bedfellows. The ABV comes up big, but hey, nothing wrong with a nice-drinking buzz. This is my first Captain Lawrence beer, but rest assured, it will not be my last.","Foxman","May 19, 2007"
4.03,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pale straw gold, nice haziness with a large fluffy white head that very slowly recedes leaving some nice lacing as it does so. Aroma is lemony and clean, citrusy, pineapple, a sugary sweetness and evidence of the alcohol strength. Taste is large hoppiness, strong mango flavor, more soapy and perfumy clean, a good alcohol punch with a spicy pepperiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium, a good amount of soft sugary feeling balanced with thye pepperiness on the tongue from the hops and slightly effervescent carbonation. There are hints of belgian sugars and yeast but this beer is screaming with hops. My first CL beer and it is unique and a surprise, definitely not what I expected when I saw it listed as a tripel. I'd like to age this beer a bit to let the bitter edge back down and allow the fruitiness to come forward a bit. Thanks Alex for the opportunity.","hoppymeal","May 04, 2007"
4.36,7.9,5,4,4.5,5,4,"Drinkability: a wonderful version of a Belgian Tripel that pleases the tastebuds and puts a smile on your face. Noticeable alcohol knocks the score down a notch, but this is still quite easy to quaff. Great beer worth picking up.","Gavage","May 02, 2007"

4.67,15.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Scotty, beam me up! I have been to heaven and back in the world of American Tripels. The citrus, sweetness and bitterness are all pretty amazingly perfect. Reminds of something similar in 'philosophy' to the Houblon Chouffe, which is a compliment indeed. This is superbly drinkable and I like it as much as, if not better than, the original - though the original was really good in my eyes (I have not reviewed it yet). Was supposed to but oh well - I have a few bottles left so it will come in time, like many other things. Bottom line here is very, very nice Scott!!","gpcollen1","Apr 11, 2007"

4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Served in a tulip glass, the beer was an opaque haze of gold. Bit of white head, but didn't leave much lace at all. Smelled extra hoppy for a tripel -- fruity (Cascade?) and a touch spicy (the yeast?). Delicious! The hops were dominant -- definitely an American take on the Belgian style -- but there was a bit of the yeasty bitter spice and a honeyish undertone. Full mouthfeel, and went down smooth for the style. Another feather in CL's cap!","jbsteiny","Dec 17, 2006"
4.28,5.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, sugary, bready with medium volumes of CO2 that fit well.","weeare138","Dec 02, 2006"

4.33,7.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Belgian style large bottle, capped, pours cloudy light, lemony amber, raises an initially huge Duvelesque light tan head, showing fine retentive powers, dissolves very slowly to a ½ inch thick film, lively carbonation continues to send bubbles rising to the top, and leaving thick gobs of sticky lacing. Bold nose of citrus infused hops. This is simply a delicious brew, hoppy/American style tripel is a style made in heaven, at least for my taste buds. Notes here of fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, pears, grapes, all balanced by a healthy jolt of grainy, citric hops.Nutty, yeasty final pour puts this one over the top... Nice, nice, nice.Got an extra bottle this afternoon to help wash down the Thanksgiving Turkey and fixins. Drop what you are doing and get over to the good Captains to secure yourself a few bottles of this complex, well crafted elixir!","Billolick","0"
