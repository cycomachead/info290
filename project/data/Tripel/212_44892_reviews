"Pours clear deep golden to orange with 3-finger white head, recedes to 1-finger in several minutes. Aroma not as intense, yeasts, floral traits, pale malts, vinous. Taste contains tons of alcohol,  outshining nuances of the style. It's actually hard to define them."

"Had this in Dellirium, great setting to have this for the first time. Have it with it's intended glassware."

"I live in Florida where a premium beer is Budweiser! I probably rate good beers higher than reality but Kasteel exceeds FL standards. It's drinkable and not overly filling. Nice balance of fruit flavors. Going from drinking good beer up North to scalvaging a good one when the ship comes in, ahh a good day!"

"Very heavy, not well balanced. Tough after taste."
""
"Ok a little to dark though"
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with one finger thick fizzy white head, fades to a thin ring, a few dots on the glass. Smell: pear, dried apricot, golden apple, clove and booze notes, sweet with spicy hopping not making too much of an impression. Taste: pear, soft golden delicious apple, clove, pepper, grape and coriander in the finish, vanilla-ish booze. Lighter-medium and slick, growing carbonation midsip then ending in a sticky finish cut by clove. A bit messy and boozy but pretty tasty overall."

"Bottle to go from World of Beer. Dated 2012/04/07, so clearly been around a bit. Pours slightly hazy golden color with a one finger quickly receding head. Aroma is a bit pungent with massive notes of booze and rotten fruit, honey, pears, smells incredibly sweet. Flavor is overly sweet and funky booze pears and honey, not much else going on here, banana and yeast esters, a hint of spice. Heavy on the palate with very high carbonation. I think 11% is just way too much here. Tough to choke down."

"330 ml. bottle.  Pours a deep golden colour, with a medium head that fades quickly, leaving a small lace. Semell of apricots, banana, clove, floral, honey., cloves. Surprinsingly medium to light boyd, I expected more froma Kasteel on the palate. Taste of apricots, citrus, honey and full bodied wine, the kind of sherry or manzanilla, or oloroso."

"OVERALL - I really like Imperial IPAs better than Tripels. This one is cloyingly sweet and a bit too boozy for me."

"One of my favorite Belgian breweries. High carbonation, medium to low head. Nice amber color. Smells like bread, nuts, caramel and a tiny floral. It has some noticeable alcohol aroma. They don’t hide the strong taste of alcohol. At room temp the alcohol is even more noticeable and with a flat head. I still prefer the Rouge and the Cuvee the Chateau"

"but its what I’d like a tripel to be."

"O - this beer in very,very unique. It's unlike an triple that I've ever had...more than that,it's unlike any beer I've ever had. The honey notes,combined with the spicy finish,are odd, but weirdly do work. I would suggest pairing this beer with some like a Chinese honey chilli chicken, some sort of sweet and sour dish. I give this beer a 4 overall, for being a very enjoyable and unique experience. A must try for Belgian beer geeks like myself."
""
""
"Overall 4.0: The most unusual triple I have ever tasted. I would dare anyone to try this beer blindfolded and tell me it is actually a beer. Everything that makes a beer a beer is gone from this brew's flavor profile: no malt and no hops. Still, what is here is like alchemy: lead into gold a brief foray into the magical. This beer is strange; it grows on you and if you are a home-brewer like me, you wonder what kind of yeast cleared this out of sugars like this, what kind of wood is that I taste...not the best triple I have ever had, but surely the most interesting and challenging to the style. Recommended."

"O: Good drinkability. Classic Belgian Tripel. Good"
""
"Pours a clear gold with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, spice, and cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with honey, spice, fruit, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some oxidized qualities that actually don't really detract from the other aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
"""It's a power house"" that ought to be tasted against the best Trappists. A bit strange and a bit peppery and sweet at same time. Arc from sweet to pepper."

"Finishes dry. This hits hard right away. Reminds me of thier donk is so many ways"
"O-many strong flavors in this beer, it is a good winter type beer for me"

"One finger uneven white head leading to thin broken layer, quick dissipation over medium gold body, a bit of chill haze, minimal visible carbonation. Coriander and noticeable sweetness in the nose, almost a candi sugar aroma. Boozy taste masks the coriander notes, funky mouthfeel, not very effervescent, this seems a bit under-carbonated. The alcohol is pretty overwhelming, wonder if this might be better after a year or so of cellaring. Don't think I will have this again."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 1/10/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apricot, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, light honey, light bread, and phenolic yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and moderate malt flavors; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, apricot, light banana, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, light honey, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and pale malt notes; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Tripel. Good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and surprisingly crisp sipping for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Pretty solid tripel, but tasted really sweet. Everything else was spot on."
""
""
"Not the most complex of Tripels, but still average, and I felt that this beer could be a bit more balanced if it had more body or flavors (not sugar) to conceal its petro. That said it is still a good beer that fits this cold day."

"O - This is a very fruit tripel, dominated by something more like sour apple than the typical citrus. Well balanced overall, and is is a nice change from the typical tripels."

"O- This bottle had no or signs of infection or major issues, so i'm reviewing the beer for what i had, which was still decently enjoyable, but mediocre and lacking complexity. It seemed to me like they were trying to bolster things up by just raising ABV"
""
""
"O: There's no mistaking the strength of this beer given the notes of alcohol in the taste but it is a nice beer to sip and a good representation of the style."

"A beer I used to love, but my palate has changed and I have tasted so many epic tripels now. One of the first of the style I ever enjoyed. That was a younger me. This beer actually exceeded my expectations; perhaps, I feared the booziness of the big bottle and refrained from revisiting it over the past few years. It's been at least that long since I've last had one. And, guess what, I'd go after another one sooner than later. I guess it just still sticks with me."
""
""
""

"Overall, I'm pleased. I would definitely drink it again!"

"D: A delicious tripel with a modicum of ethanol power. Good stuff."

"Pretty much by the book tripel. It looks and tastes good, but it does not excite. At 11%ABV it should have some kick in the rear besides alcohol. Compared to Belgians it is an also ran, good but not great and certainly short on body, head, flavor and smell. For my money I'd invest a few cents more and buy a better experience than this rather bland offering from Van Honsebrouck."
"Overall the beer is a nice mix of freshness and dryness, however the fruit taste doesnt last that long and gets way to quicky overwhelmed by the dry tast.."
"O - This is a pretty good tripel. Kasteel makes pretty good beers."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured golden yellow with a three finger white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grain, sugar, fruit, banana, spice, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, sugar, alcohol, grain, banana, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Upon first inspection of the aroma on this one it was pretty close to what one would expect from the style as far as the notes given off throughout. Once I took the first sip I was really off-put by the alcohol note going on in this one as it was very distracting from the other flavors going on in this one. There was a nice representation of the style going on despite this fact, but the alcohol just dulled it down for me personally. Worth trying if you get the chance especially on tap."
"O- Nice crispiness, fruit flavors really open up at near room temp. Alot of alcohol in both the nose and taste... again...11%. I think I'll start this at room temp the next time I open one. This is to Triples... what Devil Dancer is to IIPA's. This will forever be in my rotation! I love high octane brews on occasion."

"It's a very manly beer, and not everyone is going to like it. It's not something I want to dry again for a long time as there are plenty of other triples out there to try."
""
"Thick on the body but only average. Carbonation is also average."
"Actually a good value for $8.50. Not as complex as I prefer, nor the dark fruit undertones I love, but very Farmhouse Ale that tastes like 7%ABV- but it is actually 11%."
""
""
"Pours a light golden in color with a thin white head. Smells lightly of apples. Taste is a sweet caramel finishing with some ethanol. Mouthfeel is rich, low carbonation. Overall a good triple. However it is a bit higher in alcohol than I typically like."
""
"Such an extreme Triple with bold aroma, flavor, body yet also alcohol lurking."
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor of this brew to me is lacking, just tastes like a high alcohol brew instead of a true tripel."
""
""

"Overall a nice beer. Nothing really exciting, but good drinkable. It looks great, has most of the style characteristics and serves my needs in the triple field."

"O - A lovely beer. Very clean and sweet. Good spices. Strong alcohol flavor, but no heat. Would drink again."
"Overall this is a decent beer, but it seems incomplete and could possibly better with age. (mine was about 13 months old from bottling when tried.)"
"O: a good solid beer, nothing wrong with it, altough a rather heavy one"
"O: As with my Rouge, the bottle was very old - over 18 months in this case. Still, you have to expect a tripel to hold up to 18 months, and I didn't sense anything off about it, just wasn't good. Maybe the year and a half took off some flavor."
"O- a good triple but $$..it a treat 2 have one now again"
"Pours a golden yellow color w/ a nice one finger white head. Super transparent- this could almost pass for a lighter beer in appearance. Nose is that of apple, honey, grape, grain. Somewhat sweet on the smell. Taste is pretty similar to the nose, with fruit sweetness and malt really coming through. Feel is medium, with sweetness, malt, and alcohol burn all competing for the top character. Overall, this is a good tripel, just not a great one. The good news is that it's priced well, and readily available around Washington DC. A good solid beer, and one I'm glad I tried on draft."
"I could drink it all day except that 11% would knock me out."
"Overall this a very nice enjoyable Triple."
"O - A solid tripel, with a strong, earthly alcohol kick."
"The fragrance is sweet, rich in sugars and there sees a touch of vanilla. The flavor is mostly sweet alcoholic and without that beer lacks balance. At the tasting, it is quite creamy, round palate and easy, if not pleasant to drink. Lingering bitterness in the finish. It is much more pleasant in the mouth Kasteelbier Brown and the dose of sugar is much lower. Lovers of sweet beers, but still fear the loathing will be delighted."
"Kasteel Triple is a crystal clear golden ale with a small white head that quickly vanishes. It has a light, slightly sweet aroma of clove and stone fruit. It's full bodied and pretty slick all the way to the finish. It tastes pretty phenolic with hints of apple and apricot. A light, green bitterness emerges at the finish. There isn't a lot of flavor, but the alcohol is hidden pretty well. It doesnt seem super refined but it's pretty inoffensive."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving a little lace. Clear pale amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Sour apricot nose and flavor is sweet and sour but malty, some lemon, smooth. Finish is clean, warming. High ABV stays hidden. Nice triple. Keeps well - bottled on Aug 19, 2009. $8.39 for a 750ml bottle from Madden Beverage Saco, Me."
"O - A very solid beer that beats the Duvel hands down."
"Drinkability: average beer in the style tripel (more like a Barley wine)."
"It's a decent beer, but there wasn't much of an attempt to disguise the alcohol warmth."
"O- I can actually hear the fizz popping every time I take a sip. The apple flavor and fizz really dominate this beer with not much other character and no hops showing up at all."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, deceptively strong kick, decent representation of style, it’s not the first Tripels I would select but it’s still a decent beer."
"Though not the quentessential tripel ale, this beer has a lot of merrit because of it's malty sweet and succulent flavors, moderate alcohol impact and lightly syrupy feel- making it more akin to a complement to a fruity desert or as a stand alone digestive."
"Im very disappointed with this beer. I really wanted to like this beer. It has a great aroma, but when poured into a glass, there are chunks of hops or yeast floating in the glass. I actually thought I poured it into a dirty glass and had to get a new glass which was crystal clear and the same thing happened. At the bottom of the glass was a buildup of some sort of sediment. The beer left a bitter taste in my mouth as it is way too sweet. There was an average amount of lace and head. Overall, a way overpriced and unsatisfying brew."
"O: Definitely not the best triple, but is very very unique, and worthy of purchase again."
"Unbalanced, but tolerable drop."
"Not entirely sure how long these bad boys last. It says, ""Bottled on 091201"" I assume that's December 1st, 2009? Haha I hope so. Better not be September 12, 2001."
"Overall: Not bad actually. I was a bit apprehensive at first but it turned out ok. The ABV is extremely well hidden and not felt at all. Worth checking out."
"O: Overall this is a very good Belgian Triple. It isn't over the top, drinks easy, and it packs a punch at 11%, It is thoroughly refreshing and easy to drink. I am always looking for beers to share with my lady who tends to like Tripels, and for 10 bucks for a 750 bottle I will definitely buy this again. A good buy and a good drink."
"Overall it's not bad. Not sure I will get it again. Too many other beers to try. If it was cheap that would be another story."
"2.5 D: I must say that I'm not a big fan of this and probably Kasteel in general. This is the second of their beers that I've had tonight and both have been pretty underwhelming. This was a pricey brew, especially given the price tag."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a medium sized white fizzy head that dissipated quickly and had poor lacing. The aroma was of grain malts, a light herbal hop and a cobweb scented yeast with notes of citrus and honey. The initial flavor was slightly sour and acidic with a hint of honey and finished with a bitter yeast flavor that had a hint of citrus and a slight alcohol aftertaste that lasted a little while. Mouthfeel was very light and mild in body with a watery texture. Overall a surprisingly refreshing brew that is a little to easy to drink considering the high alcohol content."
"A hefty and unique Tripel. Decent."
"jd"
"Served: February 13, 2011"
"Drinkability: Pretty good. Do not notice the alcohol in the taste, just the spinning of the head. Nice overall. Easy to drink example of a Belgian tripel. Not the best but a reasonable example and worth drinking again."
"Very clear appearance. Light, slightly yellow, orange color. Dense, cream colored 1/4 head at pour. Settles to a thin ring around the edge and some fine cover to the face of the beer. Bright, bready aroma. Seems like there might be some spice to the beer, but definitely pick up the orange, and other citris notes. Highly carbonated. Body seems medium to slightly heavy with the alcohol and yeasty/breadiness of the this one. Pick up more of the citris notes towards the end of a drink and on the finish. Dryness of alcohol becomes slightly greater with warmth. Hasa decent mouthfeel, but dryness on end limits the drinkability of this one. Finish doesn't stay too long but, just enough to remember"
" If you want a real powerhouse, this here's your dog! Kasteel Tripel definitely deserves wider recognition and madder props than it gets...try a bottle out on some friends and see what happens."
"I'd have another but I know for sure I've had much better."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a slightly murky pale orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is tart lemon and sweet fruits with a hint of spice. The taste is a nice amount of sweet fruits with a great spice kick of coriander and pepper. The beer is medium bodied with just slight alcohol presence. This is a great draft Belgian beer, I'd love to see it on-tap more often."
"This review was taken before I hit the Normandie Camembert (very ripe) and crackers (garlic and herb flavoured). However the second half of beer went very well with food and they complimented each other perfectly."
"Drinkabililty: Although the flavors are on target, the mouthfeel and the heat just don't cut it for me, so this would not rank among the better Tripels I have encountered"
"wow for something that is so high in alcohol it was quite refreshing and perfect with korean food. the pour show a meek head but it has a continue supply of bubbles to replenish. golden clear with a finger of small white head. nose is ester rich port wine, pineapple, and lemon zest. palate is smooth with a nice carbonation that broadens a very crisp take on something quite simple. pollen, belgian yeast, citrus mild fruit ester blending with malt and sugars. not too much of any one type of effect. very lean but well placed abv."
"D - This is an enjoyable beer it has a good taste decently drinkable for being 11% its worth a try sometime"
"Drinkability: This beer does some things really well, and some not so well. All in all its OK. The too-high alcohol is one of the main problems in that it makes it too hot tasting and probably hurts head retention and lace. There are better tripels."
"A solid beer. Kasteel makes a rather light tripel that is both refreshing and unique. While certainly not the best tripel on the market, it is unique."
"D - Smooth and easy going with 11% well hidden."
"D-great balance on this beer, everything you want to see in a triple and integrates the huge abv in with full flavors masking the true power of this tasty treat."
"D-Disturbingly easy to drink for an 11% beer. This one's been in my fridge for two months and the high temperatures have slightly abated, allowing for a my first heavy beer in a while."
"Poured into a Kasteel chalice, a lighter color with a white head that disapated quite quickly. It has the aroma of alcohol and sweetness. It tastes just the same, huge alcohol presence and a candied sugar burn. It is a nice beer, but it is a bit too big and sweet for me."
"A little too sweet for my liking but not bad."
"D: This was a very nice tripel that was very clean and tasty. The body was good not great, but the alcohol was very well hidden, so it was quite easy to drink. More like champagne than beer, but I liked it. Not sure if age would help (this was nearly a year already)."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, alc level extremely hidden with a very great balance, just be careful this hits you hard but its very enjoyable, will try again for sure"
"Light yet full bodied, unbelievably drinkable given the weighty abv, this is a sipper to be savored, one of the quintessential examples of the style."
"Taste is very nice with pears and Belgian hops. A hint of malt in the finish. Very nice medium mouth feel with bubbles. Way easy to drink. I can't believe it is 11%"
"I have to say this is my favorite tripel so far, I prefer it to both Fin Du Monde and Westmalle!"
"T--It has a celery taste mixed with caramel. It's got a strong alcohol undertone to it. It's quality, though not in love with."
"D: A good tripel but the pungent alcohol quality makes this beer a slow sipper"
"D- Overall, Kasteel Tripel is a pretty decent Tripel that is worth trying."
"d-a bit sweet to drink a bunch of. 11% alcohol is hidden well. dry this beer out or up the hop bitterness."
"Too bad the flavor is lacking."
"Overall it's not bad but certainly not one of the best. This is usually a style I think goes great on a day like today - a warm sunny spring day - but today it's almost too much. A slow sipper indeed."
"Considering the strength of the alcohol, this beer felt a lot lighter than it really is and I had to hold back from drinking this faster. A very tasty and very enjoyable beer that I will have again."
"D- Surprisingly light and composed. Easy and dangerous if drunk too quickly."
"D- Very tasty tripel but not what i was expecting! Much more malty than expected but the fruityness is very pleasant, taking away the expecting syrupy sugary sweet quality. Alcohol very well hidden in the mouth, but soon made my head fuzzy after half the glass! Only 1 thanks!"
"Overall, I would definitely try this one again."
"Overall Drinkability - 4.0 - Pleasant, uncomplicated and drinkable. Lacking the complexity and depth I like in a Tripel, but very easy-going considering the high alcohol content. This one could definitely sneak up on you."
"D: For an 11%er, this hides the alcohol well. Intense sweetness definitely does most of the hiding; it could be a little less sweet and a bit more dry, but overall, that is a minor gripe. It's certainly not cloying, but very sweet. An excellent sipper, and even better aperitif."
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer has a translucent golden yellow appearance. There is a thin ring of white soap bubbles on top of the beer. After swirling the beer around the glass, it deposits a good foamy film. As the amount of beer in my glass got lower, I noticed that looking straight down through the beer, it was clear; it was only transparent when viewed through the sides of the glass. It has a lemon citrus aroma, with a bit of musty yeast. The taste has some flavors of Belgian yeast, crisp lemon citrus, and both crystal and candy sugars. There is some hops present in the aftertaste. It has a medium body and plenty of carbonation that makes it feel a bit peppery. There is a little bit of mouthcoating, but not as much as the ABV lead me to expect. It's a crisp beer, but the sweetness and strength would make me limit myself to one pour."
"Finish is big malty fruit. Nice if you like a big malty brew."
"Easy to drink, though the alcohol is high enough that you feel it after one glass. Could be a bit too hot; I get a warming in the chest but also in the head. Ultimately, it's a very good shot at a higher than normal alcohol Tripel."
"Perhaps because of its heavy carbonation, it's not particuarly quaffable in large doses. It certainly tastes, smells, and look wonderful, but the carbonation is a bit too much to overcome to be sessionable."
"very drinkable and nice for an 11% tripel, though just a bit over the top in my opinion, i prefer ones that are slightly drier."
"Drinkability: Based on taste alone, this should get a 5, but the high alcohol content is the only detractor here. At 11% ABV, I could only have one, maybe two, in a sitting. But that is the only problem here."
"The bubbles kept going and going helping to keep the nose vibrant and full of life. The nose reminded me of grapefruit or tart candy. The mouthfeel was excellent, full of body and fizzy. The taste was beautiful with citrus, floral notes and tasted like champaign."
"Drinkability: quite good. I could drink this all day, but it is probably best that I don't."
"This is a fine beer, and the first Ive had from the Kasteel series. Certainly powerful but undeniably beautiful."
"No bad words about this tripel. In a perfect world it would have a hard time, but now it's holding it's own."
"D: A very nice tripel that holds its own with the many fine beers in this class. The high ABV makes for a good nightcap. Definitely worth the pickup."
"Notes: This is a decent tripel that definitely hides the 11% ABV well (until the finish at least), but the rest of the flavor profile seems kind of weird and is all over the place at times. The citrusy notes seem to clash with the soft fruits and overwhelm them with that tart, acidic sensation that makes it taste kind of awkward. The aftertaste is rather off-putting as well, and really hinders the drinkability as a result. Overall, this one missed the mark as far as I'm concerned."
"Bought a 750 mL bottle at my local grocery store. Poured into a Rochefort Belgian style goblet. The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1 finger head (not what I was expecting from a triple). The nose is malty and floral but not overwhelming. Very soft, fuzzy mouthfeel. The taste is malty sweet up front with a slight alcohol finish. The hops are well blended into the flavor and the alcohol is not overwhelming despite the high content (11%). I found this beer to be very drinkable. A good representation of the style."
"A good Triple that strays away from the category norm, this may put some people off but most will appreciate. Definitely not as good as the same breweries brune"
" Not my favorite of the style, but a damn good beer."
"Drinkability - Well, with US law being a factor, the drinkability of this beer is still high. Lovers of Belgians and novices alike will enjoy Kasteel's Tripel. It's damn good!"
"A nice enjoyable brew."
"Overall this is a great tripel. I found this much more enjoyable than their bruin, due to the appearance, and this brew masks its alcohol a bit better."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is spicy.Taste is sour green apples,spices and alcohol.When you look at this in the glass it looks very much like a macro.Then when you smell and drink it you can definetly tell the difference.Very warming and enjoyable.Recommended and I will purchase again."
"I love this beer, I prefer the donker/dark but since it has been about 7years since I had that last I am going to have to hold out till my visit to the brewery this summer to make my final judgement."
"Great summer evening closer. Close but not quite as tasty as Triple Karmaliet."
"Feel and Drinkability: Body is light and the aftertaste is longer lasting than Maredsous, yet that green apple is there followed by an almost astringent alcohol. Carbonation is light and delicate, just a bit more would be nice if you ask me. Nothing special nothing damning. As far as drinkability, I'd go for the Maredsous over this one, better flavor and considering that this one is 16 and change for a four-pack....well it'll be a while till I drink this one again if ever. It really doesn't do it for me. Not a bad beer, but it should be better for the price...I mean the Donker and the Rouge are worth the price, this one....not so much so."
"Again, a very easy-drinking Tripel, despite the alcohol content. Just be careful as this can sneak up on you!"
"drinkability is pretty good. nice balance. a fairly balanced tripel, but not quite my favourite."
"Overall, the 11%ABV obviously makes this something you wouldn't really want to session. Putting that aside, the lingering sticky-sweetness would probably make me pass this one over in the future. However, I'd call this beer a good value at $8 or so for the 750, and it's definitely not something I'd classify as 'undrinkable.'"
"OVERALL: A very strong triple, dominated by the unnecessarily high ABV. It's too boozy for my liking and not smooth enough on the way down. I could finish it, but it wasn't really enjoyable. I've had more than my share of triples and this one was a bit of a mess. Doesn't hold a candle to their wonderful Bruin. Not a favourite and I won't be picking this one up again."
"Overall this is a rather average tripel. I'd reach for a number of other tripels first, but if this is all that's available it's decent enough brew to please most people."
"This is a big beer. Good drinkability, but not sustained drinkability. Pretty dry. A pretty good Belgian trippel worth trying."
"This beer is a somewhat hazy golden liquid. The head is massive and brilliantly white. The aroma is a little spicy, with some alcohol and fruit notes (pear, lemon, and apple). The spice is a bit peppery, and there's also a little yeast in the smell (no notable hop aroma). Although the taste is a semi-sweet, it is balanced with a not-quite hot spiciness. Alcohol warming is intense. There's considerable bitterness that starts in the hind-taste, and continues well through the finish. Medium body and very carbonated, giving the beer a 'prickly' sensation. Good tripel."
"Overall-Rather nice beer. Not the best triple I've tried, but I wasn't disappointed."
"11.2 ounces with a bottle on date of Nov. 28, 2007. Beer poured into a Kasteel chalice. Hazy golden color with ample carbonation. Enough lacing to admire. Aroma is yeasty and doughy. Alcohol and floral notes are there as well. Was expecting more of a singe from the alcohol given the ABV. A lot of yeast and bread in the taste; the hops give it a nice bite. Really shocked that this beer is 11%; the alcohol is there but is masked quite well. Beer has a champagne like effervescence. A very worthy tripel; I'm still not sure how they masked the alcohol so well. If you like tripels, this is a good bet. Not the best that I've had but a good bang for the buck."
"Notes: Consider me impressed. Everyone should try this beer and especially if you love Tripels like I do."
"D - While the taste is nice, the 11% would knock me out if I had more than one or two of these."
"The smell was fruity and had mostly sour notes like apples. It was lively in the mouth and had a good amount of carbonation which seems to be typical of this style. It was semi dry and had a good bitterness to it. Overall I enjoyed the brew and would buy again once a year or every two."
"Rich golden color with hyper-aggressive stream of bubbles filling the middle, renews the light white froth across the surface, clings effortlessly to the glass walls. The nose aims for a steamroller of sweetness, candied lemon to orange peel, honey, molasses, brioche, beeswax, flower water, pear to peach fruit, doesn't offer much counterpoint, soaks into your nostrils in a simple, upfront manner. Medium-bodied, fun frothy attach which fills up the mouth momentarily, emphasizing golden honey, tangerine citrus, wax, yellow apple, banana to apricot fruit, cinnamon stick, clove, polished mouth feel although one might say the carbonated fizz ain't all that classy. Looking for hops? Look elsewhere. This is full throttle kid run amok in a candy store sweetness. And it's good."
"D: This is a mixed bag of a beer. Some aspects are strong, but the taste is decidedly average."
"Pours a very bright golden color with a decent white head. An obvious smell of candied sugars that you find in most Belgian beers. This beer masks the high alcohol content fairly well but has a bit of an aftertaste. As it warms the taste mellows and you get a bit of a fruity flavor, but the aftertaste is still there and lingers on the tongue. I like this beer but have found better versions in the style."
"Overall, this one remains representative of the style, but boy, others do it a lot better."
"not my fav. trippel but worth trying"
"Some like it hot, some don't. If you like it hot, you may like this."
"Drinkability is medium for me, the high alcohol content would stop me from having too many. Overall a decent beer."
"Impressive beer from Kasteel."
"Served on tap at the Belgian Beer Fest at the Muddy Pig in St Paul on 9/14 and again on draft on 9/17(leftovers, woo-hoo!), this pours a hazy golden color, with a small white head that quickly dissipates, leaving a fine white lace on the glass. The smell is fruity and citrussy. The taste, oh the taste! To me, this was the best tasting Tripel at the Fest, and there were a bunch of them(including Gouden Carolous, St Bernardus, St Feullian, Val Dieu, La Rulles, and Des Rocs, as well as some domestic versions). The flavors I tasted included banana, cherry, a brandy-like alcohol flavor, a slight citrussy lemon/orange flavor, a sweet caramel/honey flavor, and a light crispness I found irresistable. The disparate flavors blended into an outstanding whole. The mouthfeel is light yet full-flavored. This is a fantastic beer, and one I will continue to enjoy until it's gone(hopefully, not for a while!)."
"Tried a bottle of this as recommended by a very good friend of mine during a Friday night visit to La Cav DU Vin several weeks back. An 11.2 oz bottle poured into a fat tulip glass. pours a cloudy, crisp looking medium golden color. The white head was well over an inch when poured. Good retention and lacing here indeed! Eventually settles to a good 1/3 inch and then 1/4 inch. malty aromas, vanilla, clove, and other spices. maybe a bit of fruit here as well such as apple or banana. Has a sweet and caramel malty flavor with a bit of the aforementioned spice and fruit, definitely banana. the taste of alcohol is slightly noticeable, a bit more than in most 7% ABV beers I suppose. Has a crisp, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink. A fine beer all around."
