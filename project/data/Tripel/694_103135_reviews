"Not a bad trple ale by any means, but there are better ones out there. As I always feel, it never hurts to try something new. You never know what you may come across."
"Golden yellow with a heavy orange hue. Heavy haze with tons of yeasty floaties. Poured with a hug, dense white foam. Good head retention. Ripe, mellow orange citrus, over ripe apple and banana with peppery phenolics and smooth, sweet booziness at the end. Medium light floral hop aromas find their way through the myriad of belgian aromas. Medium bodied with soft yet effervescent carbonation. Light creaminess following the carbination near the finish along with pleasant boozy warmth. Banana and ripe apple flavors followed by coriander and medium light hop bitterness. Mellow, malty, boozy sweetness at the end. Finished medium dry with a brief lingering bittness. Overall a very drinkable, complex beer. Balance tilted toward fruity esters in the aroma and toward spicy phenolics in the flavor with a pleasant, warm, sweet boozines. Cheers. Love Troegs!"

"Mouthfeel is zesty and fizzy, but it slides down creamy and smooth; nice contradictions as it kept my interest and trailed off slightly bitter and chalky dry. I got this bottle at the brewery over the summer of 2014 and it seems to have aged very well as I t"

"Heed the bottle's warning: pour it slowly and carefully. Everything about the beer is above average, but it leaves just a hint of aftertaste that isn't as smooth as the rest of it. It's a very good beer from a cool little brewery, and I'd drink it again."

"O - I think this is going to be my favorite Troegs offering.  I hope I can obtain this great ale at one of my distributors.  Troegs has a winner w/ this release.  Bravo!!!"

"O: this beer is awesome. Extremely drinkable despite the 8% abv. I will be picking this one up again!"

"Poured from a brown 12.7 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head and some floaties in the glass. Smell is of yeast, some spices. Taste is spices, fruits, alcohol is present, good, but less flavorful then expected for the style. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"PS:  Loved the small corked and caged bottles."

"i like this beer a lot, it has a couple of cool things going for it. one is that its a cool sort of hybrid on the yeast front, with elements of the classic belgian strains and all their fruity intensity, and also saison yeast, more funky and spicy, and super super dry. the other thing is that seems to be a rather authentic take on the style, blonde and bubbly, grain and yeast driven, delicate for its size, all of that, but instead of being candy sugar sweet in the finish, its very very dry. the rapid fire carbonation helps that along too, but there isnt much sweetness left here in this tripel, a really nice feature. its also pretty light in body for what it is, and at 8% av instead of say 11% abv, i can easily have a few of them. well done by troegs here, this exceeded expectations."

"A gorgeous triple ale that cloudy just like it should be. Pours a deep amber all cloudy from a 12.7 oz corked bottle that delivers that strong Belgium ale aroma at just whiff. I could drink this one all night - and I just might! This is my first venture with Tröegs and I am delighted and impressed. Cheers!"

"O:  (4.0) Overall its been way to long since i've enjoyed a good tripel. where have you been. Spot on interpretation and yeast character, fruity, with an solid outstanding flavor. Must try."
"Overall: its got all the flavors of a trippel but on the harsh side. the alcohol is too present even for the relatively low abv. Maybe you could argue to cellar out the harshness. I think there are way too many great trippels out there for me to give that a try. 3.14/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a great tripel, with delicate and delicious scent and taste. The body was just right, and the finish was smooth with well hidden alcohol. So it was easy to drink, although could be sipped. Probably not for aging, perfectly fit to drink fresh. Solid brew."
""
""
""

"Fantastic tripel. I loved it. Really great representation of the style, yet still having a unique taste to it to set it apart. I hope this is not a one time brew , because I'd love to have a four pack of this in my cellar along with other tripels I like to have around on a rotating basis - Unibroue, Chimay, Weyerbacher, Westmalle, Gulden Draak. Definitely try it if you like Belgian style tripels."

"Overall it's ok, but also hardly reminds me of any true Belgian character. The beer also doesn't seem to have that classic large and big character I associate with this style. It comes off more as a slightly fruity large blonde ale instead."
""
"O - With a few tweaks, I could see this beer really improving. Mainly, dialing down the banana and adding some citrus to it. I love Troegs and hope they keep putting out quality brews. This wasn't my favorite of theirs, or of the style, but it is a damn solid offering. I could see this pairing really well with some cured meats. And big ups to them for not packaging this in a 25 oz. bottle. Love the smaller corked bottle."

"375 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 3/26/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Outstanding and spot on appearance. Aromas of big peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Sizable yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding tripel style. All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall - I have trouble vouching or accessibility on this one, but I was able to enjoy it via the trade route. I am glad I have another bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: if only this tripel tasted a little bit more like its aroma, I would rate it as one of the best American tripels around."
"Overall, an okay brew. Wouldn't turn it down, but wouldn't rush to the store to buy some either."
""
"O: a very nice take on a Belgian golden strong/ triple. Affordable here in PA and glad to have tried. A very well executed beer. Cheers to Troegs!"
""
""
""
""

"D/O Drinkability is fair due to its style. Overall this is a solid tripel. There are better options out there in my opinion. Within the same State (PA) there is my favorite Belgian Tripel, Weyerbacher Merry Monks. 3.0"
""
"Pours musty, dark bronze with heavy white foam - over an inch of shrink resistant foam. Bright floral citrus fragrance. Bold carbonated flavor, belgian backed, chalky/yeasty. Slight grittiness. Bottle carbonation makes the carbonation a bit to punchy. A burper for sure."
""
""
""
"O: It is great for what it is, and the price is great for a four pack of bottle conditioned C&C bottles. I was super surprised to see it in the stores, and then looked it up to find out it is year round, but that is probably due to the new bottling line upgrades at Troegs. It gives you a peek into what their Splinter series was/is/will be like. I wish it had a bottled on date, but it is bottle conditioned so that helps."

"Excellent beer from Troegs Brewing. LaGrave pours with a thick head that simmers down to constant thin foam layer of tightly laced bubbles. Smells of banana, and sweet baked bread with an herbal astringency coming through on the nose. Hops are a bit up front with nice malt background and excellent carbonated mouth feel from the yeast with an open fermentation taste that is not overly sour or Flemish. Pears, apples, and sweet bread, excellent flavor profile that keeps improving with each sip. Light hop character and sweet Belgian candy sugar on the aftertaste. Very nice from one of my favorite brewers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good stab at the style. Very impressive actually. A departure from the styles troegs normally tackles, but they did a very good job with this one."
""
""
"A successful attempt at a Tripel, this has a nice rounded flavor and dry finish. With darker malts, this could easily rival some of the best belgian strong darks out there. For what it is here, its a very nice dry Belgian style Tripel."
""
"I thought this was a well made tripel. Definitely one of the better ones from an American brewer. It is a tad on the sweet side."
"Overall: A good triple. Nothing outstanding here but par for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent Tripel; I am not really a fan of the style but I am a fan of Troegs and this beer turned out well. If Troegs would make the fruit more dominant and not leave such a dry bitterness at the end this would be better."
"O: This is really close to being a spectacular example of the style, it just needs a bit less in the way of overbearing yeast. Everything else about this one works damn well. It's reasonably complex, not overly sweet (nor does it rely on overdone carbonation to mask the sweetness), and pleasant to sip on. Certainly, it's worth buying again for yours truly."
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An above average triple with nice apple and hay flavorings. Tasty, but I have had better in the style. Certainly worth a try, but I will reach for other favorites."
""
""
"o. Overall this beer falls short of outstanding, but not by much. I would revisit."
""
"Overall not bad, nothing too special, nice esters, phenolic notes are nice but then get a little chemically unfortuantely, booze is about wher eit should be, carb is nice but maybe a bit too much, I like the early big grainy straw and raw barley flavors, but also not a big fan of the spicy hop back end. So mixed but decent."
"O: a decent tripel - probably not gonna displace any favorites, but a worthwhile contribution to the genre"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it. As I usually do when it comes to Troegs. I probably won't be back but I won't say never. Glad I picked it up and you will too."
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this offering, usually American breweries fall short on Tripels, but this is pretty good."
""
""

"Overall a tasty beer with that Belgian funk and some fruitiness; another winner from Troegs!"

"A very good imitation of a legit Belgian ale, especially in the body. Aroma is decent and flavor is very good. Definitely worth trying, as good as some of the lesser Belgian approximations from Unibroue and Ommegang."
""
"Very carbonated as stated on the bottle. Initial sip was a bit like a bitter pill, with some Pilsner-like qualities. As the beer settled in the glass and warmed, it began to open up and reveal some of its complexity & warmth. That's more like it. A good Belgian style ale certainly worth drinking, but not necessarily worth seeking out with all the other good products from Belgium that are widely available (such as Affligem, which is more enjoyable). A decent golden nonetheless."

""

""
"Overall this is a fairly great Trippel ale I like the balanced hops to malts and the easy going coriander spice. Worth picking up just to try."
""
""
""
""
""
"The yeast is way too potent and covers up what could be a more complex beer. Hides the alcohol well and has a nice warming effect. Perhaps some aging is in order?"

"A good beer, intention-wise. Borders on strong pale ale territory."

"Overall – A very enjoyable sweeter triple style brew. Very easy drinking and enjoyable without being over the top in abv."
"It starts with malty sweetness, with some bread and cracker action, plus a smidge of honey. Fruitiness kicks in with some pear and green apple, plus perhaps a hint of melon. The finish is dry, with a suggestion of yeasty pepper kicking in at the end. Quite enjoyable, and relatively reasonably priced! Prosit!!"

"Nice job Troegs!"
""
""
"O - A nice U.S. interpretation but not as good as our European counterparts. Still solid, but a little heavy on the bready yeastiness."
""
"Pours a very mildly clouded yellow and gold. Minimal head. Yeasty and bready nose. Flavor brings a bit of the same with nice sweet edges and accents of fruit esters. Smooth and easy to drink. Tröegs rarely seems to disappoint. Glad to have the chance to try this one. Now if I can only get some Splinter Gold."
""
"Taste starts sweet, fruitiness in the middle, spicing and some light hops bite on the close. Touch of alcohol warming. Mouthfeel is extra smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Kind of surprised by this one, really goes nicely."
"O- I think this fits into the Belgian strong pale ale category more than a tripel, as the flavors a very different. I'm excited to see what this beer can do as the base for future splinter beers. Oak and wild yeast would do wonders for this one, but the base beer is just okay."
""
""
"Overall- halfway decent tripel, assuming this is meant to be a take on the Belgian tripel style. This is nowhere in the neighborhood of La Fin du Monde and is too sweet for me, however."
""
""
""

"Overall, I'm very fond of this Tripel. It's worth taking the time to appreciate at different temps. And it even plays with Mediterranean small plate foods surprisingly well."

" The beer is clear and golden with a small white head. You aroma brings alcohol, oranges, spice, coriander. Too sweet with prominent alcohol. Woo...ouch. Hold up. I've the top. A bit much on the booze. Too sweet and boozy. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall, eh..."
"My take away? A solid triple, but I can’t help but wish it were different having had the Splinter Gold. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to truly appreciate this beer for what it is, as I think I’ll always wish it was the Splinter Gold and not just a triple."
""
""
"D - A very nice Tripel and wonderful initial 375ml crown and corked offering from Troegs... Not my favorite Tripel, but a very enjoyable one... Personally I'd like to see the sweetness dialed up slightly... That would go a long way in taking this brew to the next level... Slightly less than the sum of its parts, but I'll gladly revisit, recommend, and support this excellent brew from my local brewery..."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with an effervescent amount of carbonation that seems so over-done that it imparts a carbonic/mineral feel in both the aroma and flavor. This beer has some real potential and depth of character, it is just real rough around the edges. The alcohol is not hiding at all, even at lower than ideal serving temperature. Regardless, this is a very pleasant and interesting offering from Troegs. This might be the most exaggerated example of a beer that I downright disliked at first and grew on me to the point where I was ready to open a second bottle. You really gotta let this one breath to enjoy it though."

"O - A nice enough Triple. It packs all of the flavors you would expect and it hides the 8% rather well. Glad to see them starting to make beers like this year round. Looking forward to seeing how this one develops."
