4,-1.5,4.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Final Grade: 4.00, an A-. Watou Tripel is a well-made Belgian-style brew that is easy to like, but is not likely to amaze. The flavour profile is highly enjoyable, but not very complex for this style - lacking many of the inviting aromatic notes and the spicy kick I tend to expect from this sort of strong ale. It's still a very solid effort that I'd happily drink again, but in the end it's a victim of strong competition - it's just not one of the better tripels I've had over the years. Worth a look, if nothing else.","thehyperduck","Dec 03, 2014"

Massive banana and clove aromas, along with another note consistent with spicy, slightly woody Belgian yeast. I found this one to be sweet and malty for a tripel, with notably less overt alcohol on the palate than one often gets with such brews. Malt backbone recalls brown sugar, a little butterscotch, and lightly burnt pancakes. Fruity and spicy, featuring clove and cinnamon phenols coupled with assertive banana and baked pear. The yeast recalls a hefeweizen. Impressively hoppy for the style as well, with some noble hop and gooseberry notes showing up in the fairly sweet but not cloying finish. Highly carbonated but quite smooth and on the thick side of the Belgian ale body continuum. It was interesting to sample a tripel that was largely true to style but nevertheless sweeter and less boozy than the iconic examples.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 24, 2014"

This Watou Tripel has an old antique/old world type taste to it that I do not get in Tripel Karmeliet or La Fin Du Monde. I like that taste of have been sitting in a cellar aging for a century so that is a bonus. Tripels are not my favorite style as generally the stronger hop presence is not my bag.

Small, off-white head and lacing. The beer is moderate bodied and the floating particles are suspended in the beer; very interesting looking. An aroma of sweet malt and light fruit, slightly sour. Flavor is sweet malt, light fruit, caramel, vanilla and Belgian spice, somewhat dry finish. Nice flavor progression. A nicely made tripel, somewhat sweeter than others, which is to my taste.","LiquidAmber","Mar 25, 2012"

Pours very cloudy golden amber color with a fairly dense 1 finger white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of lemon, apricot, banana, clove, biscuit, bubblegum, candi sugar, herbal spice, and some yeast funk. Decent aromas that are a bit muted. Taste of lemon, banana, bubblegum, clove, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of clove, banana, citrus, candi sugar, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Much more fruity than it is spicy. A touch on the dry side for a Tripel. Good flavor balance and decent complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Alcohol is almost invisible with almost no warming noticeable on the finish. Overall this is definitely a very nice, well balanced, and drinkable Tripel.

Kinda reassuring, actually. Some variable-length deposits of webbed lacing is formed, evidence of the fortitude contained in this glass. This just wouldn't be a tripel without some clove and banana, and our boy doesn't disappoint. In fact, it downright appoints. *Insert rim shot here* But seriously, folks, the banana and clove are there in abundance, joined in their nasal migration by some coriander, orange peel, and pineapple, not a rare combination but not wholly ordinary either. It should come as no surprise, then, that the taste takes these elements and introduces them to a new habitat. Yes, there is a risk that they won't get along so well in their newfound captivity, but, so far, they seem to be adapting just fine. In fact, they are even joined by a warm breadiness and a rounded tartness. Not only are they interacting with no problems, they're downright getting along. It's what you always hope for when you get involved in flavor relocation and confinement. The modd is light, but not too light: some necessary seriousness is bound to find its way in.

Tastes of fruits (apples again, green ones), yeast, raisins and alcohol, the main difference between this one and the standard St. B tripel is the higher alcohol presence in this beer.

Lovely spice aromas of clove, coriander, and anise with a background breadiness that is very pleasant. Beautifully balanced flavors, with more breadiness, white pepper, clove, less anise, and a bit of tannins on the end. There is some sweetness from candi sugar, but this is much less sweet than many examples and the spice notes are foremost. Some light banana as it warms. A little stiffer and more tannic than some tripels, but complex and full in the mouth. Delicious, a serious tripel that deserves to be sipped and contemplated.

(1/2 a pint at a time in a big Belgian glass was my decanting.) Great all around beer if you aren't looking to party with it! I would note that it had a caramel mouthfeel that I've personally overdone brewing belgians, but they pulled it off with a great amount of drinkability.

After a minute or so it still hasn't moved more than 1/4" down. The beer is a deep yellowish-orange color with big chunks of flaky sediment rising and falling in a convective manor. The smell is also great. Peppery, but sticky-sweet orange aroma. Awesome belgian yeast, very slight hop aroma at the end including coriander, wheat, orange peel, and full, rich esters rising deep into the nose. The flavor is so hard to explain in only a few sentences. Rich, full, explosive, ever changing, and so on. Begins with a sticky sweet orange effect fading into thick and chewy nutty malt characteristic that I never expected. The hop at the end is so ripe and clean that I've never tasted anything like it before. The nutty taste in the middle fades into a chocolate/coffee taste (also very unexpected) before finally fading back into the fresh hop taste that provides a grassy, wheaty aftertaste. I like this tripel especially since it isn't a sugar bomb. It actually has some malt balance while also maintaining that thick, citrusy, sweet flavor that is expected out of a belgian tripel. The mouthfeel is also perfect. It coats the mouth but has a certain dry Saison-like feel that really makes it a great experience. Drinkability, through the roof.

Add to that the faint alcohol taste and somewhat sharp bitterness. This beer is layered and all of the important components of a tripel are in here, malt, yeast, hop, and all very balanced.

Some spiciness is in the nose too, as a combination of the hops and the yeast. Flavor seems slightly overwhelmed by a toasted, and almost roasted-flavored, malt presence. The honeyed and fruited malts just seem overloaded by it. Tastes good all around, but the toasted malt is a bit much here. Has some spiciness in the finish from the hops. Mouthfeel sits really light on the tongue, as a good tripel should, which belies its relatively high abv (although not in the territory of some other tripels).

Aroma has the typical Belgium Tripel smell, but lacks a truely unique aroma that would make it stand out. Strong Phenolic taste along with a moderately strong bitterness.

Poured a cloudy yellow orange colour with loads of sediment suspended in the liquid. The particles themselves even were quite large. Some of them were perhaps 2 or 3mm in diametre. I find this very, very appealing in a most Belgian styles. Head was an enormous white froth that left behind a thick, sticky webbing of lace all about the sides of the glass. This looked positively delicious. Smell was caramel, sweet malt, cooked fruit, and very subtle alcohol. The caramelised sugar note was a bit surprising to me, as I do not recall having ever noted that aroma in a Belgian Tripel before. The taste was full of caramel, as well, along with a bit of cooked fruit, some very mild alcohol on the finish, and a very brief and gentle bitterness that vanishes as quickly as it became noticeable.

This beers tendency to be assertive with the obvious alcohol presence detracts from the drinkability. I have had brews with much higher alcohol contents that are much smoother than this.

It pours a hazed dark honey/peach with some floaties and medium carbonation going up to an off-white head that leaves moderate lacing. The aroma is fruity and sugary with melon, apple/pear, some spiciness, and light latex. The flavor is the same but with light hops that leave a mild yet pleasing bitterness, powdery yeast, and maybe a touch of cork.

The 330ml bottle with what I am assuming is the St Bernard abbey on the label poured a dull tangerine or flat honey colour, and large pieces of yeast freely floating despite the bottle being stored upright for 9 months in my cellar. Head is bright white and fine, with beautiful screen-lacing like fresh washed pillows or white blankets. The layer of foam stays consistent and creamy throughout, and actually becomes better after a few sips and some swirls. A very good look, though I do not fancy the free-floating yeast chunks. Strong green-apple peel immediately on the nose. Some light but buttery maltiness above the rim, followed by that tang, almost chemical-like, of the apple peel; candy apple, definite pear, some metallic notes, and roasted, nutty bread. Pear and green apple are the predominant aromas. The aroma is also quite bitter to the nose, like orange peel. An appetising, fruit-filled aroma. The taste is all malt at first, medium-roasted and doughy. In the middle comes a slight tartness from the fruit flavours, again all apples, with apricot and a hint of estery warmth. Iron, red malt, cider, white sugar, lime, and lactose. Some typical yeast tastes, adding a milkiness to the palate. The finish is quite terse, leaving little besides a subdued fruit and some hoppy dryness. No taste really lingers. A fine tasting beer, but not overly complex or original in taste. The lees were murky and offered a stronger, and better fruit taste. The aroma led me to believe the taste would be just as tart and fruity, but it was not; until I tasted the sediment separately. The mouthfeel is just how I like a beer: this is unctuous and mouth-coating, full bodied, syrupy and low in carbonation. Velvet in the mouth. Of course that aids drinkability, as does the relatively low bite of alcohol in the flavour. A very respectable tripel, and one I would love to try again.","Cwrw","May 23, 2005"

3.8,-6.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"One from the st Bernard at Watou is always prommissing. Has the same fruitsmell as Westvleteren 8 what is of course top of the bill. Appearance is somehow less though however a great head( what a amout of carbon dioxide must be in there) with a bronze colour. Smell is apricot/citrussy with koreander and very malty. What a palate so to say. Taste then is litle less though, sweet, fruity and malt make a nice palate however in my eyes not that well balanced. Just to sweet. Further just litle hops if you come from the region of poperinge. Aftertaste sweet again! But don't take me wrong, if this one would be a litle less sweet and they would ad some (extra) hops in this brew it would be something great.","paterlodie","0"
3.93,-3.2,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"A white rocky head, color is amber/orange with lots of effervescence. Retains a nice layer and a sticky lace. Aroma is sweet - candy sugar, lightly spicy with fruity esters. Flavor has a sweet start with a light yeasty bite. Palate is highly carbonated, light bodied and creamy. A drinkable beer, yet nothing memorable and not a great representation of the style.","SeanChouffe","Nov 10, 2004"
4.1,1,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Nice hazy golden-orange tone. Thick and voluptuous head of white rocky foam. Retention is outstanding and the lace clings like a mofo. Aroma is bready and doughy. Just how I like my tripels. Cookie-doughish. A little spicy, peppery. And I perceive bubblegum as well on the nose. The flavors folow suit with the nose to an extent. Bubblegum, sweet bread doughy flavors, cracked black pepper, must and lemongrass. Nice little blend. The mouthfeel is spritzy in it's carbonation. Maybe just a tad too spritzy. Body is close to medium. All in all, a solid tripel.","Bighuge","Oct 16, 2004"

4.15,2.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Sharp spicy taste, prickly mouthfeel with a dry finish. Very refreshing beer, very upbeat. The head was a huge cap of white foam that receded a bit quicker than I'd like. Cloudy orange carries lots of haze and yeast with a steady stream of bubbles. Fruity taste and aroma with a slight musty note to the aroma. Very drinkable, all the great traits of the bigger tripels, but low enough ABV that you can enjoy more of it.","Sixpack595","Sep 17, 2004"

4.05,-0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This poured a deep golden to amber color with a thick, rich, creamy white head. Champagne like bubbles continued to fill the head for many minutes after the pour. Just a light white lace remained after the drink. The nose is a sweet malty goodness, maybe some figs or dates on the backend with just a touch of hops. Nice malt taste piercing through on the 1st sip, but this had more hops in the flavor than I expected. The hops and a touch of the alcohol come through mid-drink to balance the beer. Maybe just a little too much of a bite from the alcohol. It has a wonderfully light mouth feel, and despite the high alcohol punch is very drinkable. Great example of the style","carln26","Jan 21, 2004"
4.12,1.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"11.2oz Bottle Best Before 01 06 07 Pored a slightly golden orange with a huge head atop. Beautiful aroma that is fruity,floral, spicy and as previously mentioned a hint of bubblegum is in the mix. Crisp and well carbonated mouthfeel that is smooth and with an airy feel as though floating in your mouth. Flavor is lemony and spicy with nice yeast notes. This is better than the other Tripel in my opinion and a good one at that.","BierReise","Nov 23, 2003"
3.77,-7.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall Impression: Quite different for a tripel. Almost like a weizenbock (lots of esters and phenols, bready). Not a show-stopper, but definitely a good stand-by, all-purpose beer.","GreenCard","Mar 08, 2003"

3.92,-3.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Caliginous orange color on the pour, the head is cumbrous in size, spumescent in its consistency, brilliant white in color as it putresces the lace left behind forms a fine lattice-work upon the glass. The aroma of butterscotch, sweet malt, yeast, fresh and clean, the start ambrosial with a fine malt backing, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Moderately acidic, the hops understated in their presence, quite dry and long lasting, quite drinking and not the least bit overpowering, well worth a sample.","Gusler","0"
