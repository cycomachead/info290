4.5,15.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Reviewed from tasting notes. Faint apple brandy niose with light grains and fruit. Pours pale, tea tinted gold with a slight haze under a rocky pale 2‚Äù white foam cap. It starts on the palate fruity and yeasty with caramel notes like a Belgian ale and then mid palate apple brandy flavors emerge and grow into the finish greeted by earthy hops. Medium full body, medium high carbonation, smooth and creamy.","pat61","Mar 05, 2015"

This is one of the most intense beers in flavor, aroma...a unique (and exceptional) barrel aging project that has produced an incredible beer. Like Victory's White Monkey and Allagash's Curieux, Captain Lawrence married the Belgian Tripel with Apple Brandy Barrels with exquisite results.

The barrel effect produces a subtle and noticeable vanilla/crisp apple note.  The rest of the drinking experience is that of pleasant beer booze.  The overall 88 score (at this time) doesn't do it justice.   This is a great beer for those looking for an elegant drinkable cognac-like beer moment.   Classy beer, and as one has already put it, this concoction is about as good as it gets.  For 11.00/4, it is bargain.","mirp1","Nov 21, 2014"

Nose is defined by the essence of apples, as if you opened a real hard cider, not sweetness just apple-ness. Flavor up front is very offensive from the alcohols, but as it breathes it becomes relatively malty with slight sweetness. Alcohols subside into a better balance after breathing. Hard to taste the apples, to be honest but it is a very approachable Tripel for flavor. Overall, enjoyable and I would have again, which is not what I could say for many other Tripels.","aquatonex","Dec 29, 2013"

Smells of apple, oak tannins, vanilla, ethanol, sweet fruit, and light sugars. The flavor is a little hot There's lots of sweet fruitiness up front mixed with a bit of sweet brandy then a solid shot of alcohol and oak. Then we get some non descript spices and an earthy flavor. Yeasty esters and sweet light sugary malt fight against a lingering alcohol burn in the finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet hot mouthfeel. This is kind of a hodge-podge of flavors and its a bit hot even after a few years. That being said, I really enjoyed this beer.","johnnnniee","Aug 03, 2012"

The nose is slightly tart and boozy reminiscent of apples, but certainly not screaming apple pie. Almost no yeast detectable in the beer's nose. The taste is the same with a big hit of brandy followed by a dry apple finish. The mouthfeel is slightly buttery and tart, and it's definitely boozy, but still drinkable. Guaranteed to burn with a 12%abv, which is much more prevalent as the beer warms. Overall this beer was quite taste and different, but didn't win me over.","ThePorterSorter","Jul 07, 2012"

Nose has a nice blast of apple with the traditional Belgian yeast associated with the style. While I'm not a fan of of Belgian beers even a little, this one is palatable, as the barrel characteristics are pretty dominant. The taste has a nice green apple kind of tartness to it, while simultneously having a caramel type of sweetness to it. This works well. The mouthfeel is a bit hot, but I like it. This has a genuine beer/alchohol hybrid feel to it. It's hard to tell what it is you're drinking at times, and I guess I enjoy that. There's a lingering tartness on this that just works so well.

3.83,-2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A slightly hazed orange infused straw color with a bubbly one finger cap. The aroma is of oranges and tangerines with tart granny smiths, oak and some booze. The flavor profile is tart off the bat with sticky citrus in tow. Oak and some vanilla toffee like flavors come through before a dry, oak laden finish. A medium body with moderate carbonation and booze throughout. The finish is mildly puckering, but largely dry. Overall, this is a unique take on a triple that I definitely enjoyed. The barrel aging added some nice elements to an already well crafted triple.","ColForbinBC","Sep 12, 2011"

The taste is sweet like a fruit basket apples, with some other indiscernible fruit flavors with notes of citrus, caramel on the finish. Moderate body and carbonation, nothing unusual.

Aromas of apple cider, apple skin, brandy booziness, and a bit of spice. Interesting aromas with good strength. Taste of huge slightly tart apples, apple skin, honey, spiciness, and a bit of citrus. Lingering notes of spice, apple, and citrus sweetness on the finish. No bitterness noticed, as expected for a tripel. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied. Alcohol is well hidden in the taste, with only a slight warming on the finish noticed. Very smooth drinking as well for being 10%. Nice balance of flavors without having too much sweetness.

Fantastic nose on this beer - Apple brandy, citrus and a sweet character. Taste is consistent with nose, but really quite boozy. Some apple pie spice is definitely in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a prickly/gassy carbonation. There's also quite a bit of residual alcohol heat at the finish. An interesting beer, but I think I needs to be laid down for a quite a while to even it out a bit. If you are opening it fresh, share it with a few people.

The oak and apple flavors are up front here, with some fruity notes hidden below them. Alot of brandy flavor comes through. The flavor is somewhat tart, and somewhat dry, definatly alcoholic.

Although the smell is tart, I don't detect any of the funk other reviewers have noticed. Flavor is dominated by tart apples and refreshing lemon. I don't think I've ever had brandy before, so can't pick out that flavor. This is a fairly sugary beer. Thick, coating, sticky and highly carbonated. Overall, quite good. This is a great hot weather beer for those, like me, who prefer to avoid drinking anything under 9% ABV (not sure what ABV this is, but I'd be surprised if it's less than 9.5%). However, this should be sold in smaller bottles. 750ml is ridiculous. No way I can finish a bottle of this in one night.","waltonc","Feb 09, 2011"

The taste is a lot like the nose - yeasty and a bit dry on the back with indications of apple and a bit of booziness. I have never said this before, but a bit of spice might have gone a long way to finish this beer. That being said, I am really enjoying this beer, despite leaving me wanting something.

I wouldn't be surprised if some people hate it, but the apple flavor makes it almost sangria-like. Leaves a pretty cooling and refreshing fruity feel long after putting the glass down.

A light apple cider aroma. The taste is of a pale malt, a beligan yeast strain which produces a juicy fruit flavor and some banana/clove. There is a bit of a dirty/earthy hop bitterness. Oh, and then there are the apples. Solid apple flavor which bring some of the sweet and tart aspects of the apple. The apple flavor works very well with the style, mixes into a unique flavor profile. The feel is on the light side of moderate with active carbonation; a nice mixture of sweet and bitter with a ever so slight touch of sour. Drinks quite crisp and easy, seems to have clean flavors.

3.43,-12.3,2,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"An aggresive pour of Golden Delicious results in a beer that's a nice light gold in color. The white head, despite decent retention, never rises past a finger in height and no lacing at all is left behind. The nose is a decent mix of pale malt sweetness (with an added emphasis on apples), spices, and alcohol. Some of those flavors get a little bit muddled in the transition to taste though, specifically a lot of the spicy yeast flavors get lost in the heavy alcohol presence from the barrel aging. This murkyness fades somewhat as the beer warms, and all the different flavors become a bit more distinct. The beer's body is nice for they style, but carbonation is woefully lacking. This beer's definitely a sipper, and the alcohol flavor from the barrel is a bit overbearing at first, but it really opens up nicely later on as it approaches room temperature. Golden Delicious is a beer with a great idea behind it, but like Xtra Gold I think Captain Lawrence lost sight of the tripel aspect a little bit and focused too much on the other stuff (in this case barrel aging, with XG it was too heavily dry hopped). Still, definitely one worth trying","axeman9182","Jun 14, 2010"

3.94,0.8,3,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: An interesting beer, though one I wasn't positively thrilled about. It's also fairly high in alcohol - the X-tra Gold is high enough as it is (note: not from experience), and the brandy barrel-aging not only adds booze, but also adds plenty of heat. I find it odd how I react to this beer versus, say, Allagash's Curieux, which I adore - the heat is just as strong in that beer, but whereas this beer's heat seems to react cumulatively with the base beer in a negative way, appearing one dimensional and oftentimes too intense, the Curieux seems to fill out all the gaps evenly, with noting accentuating anything else in too extreme a way. This beer is still well made, solid, enjoyable, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in such things ... but I'll say I'm glad I instead chose to go to the Southampton release out on Long Island this day instead of to Captain Lawrence for the release of this brew (looking forward to that Double Ice Bock one day!).","CrellMoset","May 09, 2010"

Aroma has much Belgian yeast spiciness, fruity esters, apple, and some buttery heat to it. No evidence of barrel aging in the nose that I can detect, mostly a very spicy tripel. The flavor is dominated by spicy Belgian yeast, cloves, peppery bitterness then mild apple and cookie sweetness on the finish. Body is medium, maybe on the lighter side due to the vibrant amount of fizzy carbonation. This is an okay tripel, apparently aged in apple brandy barrels, which seems to have no or a negative effect on the flavor profile.","vacax","Mar 27, 2010"

It comes out of the bottle a murky golden color, with about two fingers of white heading. Fruity nose of apples and dry champagne, but in a very subtle way. Taste is so well rounded between the apple, hops, grains and brandy. It is astonishing how well rounded all of the flavors are, and how they interact in perfect harmony. Mouthfeel is right in the middle, and quite honestly, is just right. There is no over carbonation or excessive use of hops, this is simply put together responsibly. Drinkability is second to none, as the alcohol cannot even be noticed, and the stuff is just so damned tasty. I do not say these sorts of things very often, but this is most definitely the best Tripel I have ever encountered. Some have said that these bottles need to sit for a while to let the alcohol die down, but to hell with that. This beer is more than drinkable now. Originally I was planning on trading my other bottle, but not now. I eagerly await what some time in the cellar aging will do to this gem of a brew. Cheers","jamie2dope","Beers"

It has your typical tripel aroma; lots of pale malts, alcohol warmth, some sweetness. The twist here is the apple brandy barrels. They lend a very nice character to the beer. It's a mildly aggressive and seems to tame the alcohol warmth quite well. The taste is good also. It has a nice pale malt flavor that's a bit heavy handed in alcohol warmth. There is a light touch of hops and then the delicious apple brandy flavor. I can't get enough of these barrel aged beers. It definitely makes this a much more complex beer. The mouthfeel is fine.

As it warms, the apple flavor overtakes the more mellow quince and really does impersonate a golden delicious perfectly. Way too boozy though, not in the sense of being too alcoholic, but for taking on the qualities of its aging vessel to the detriment of the beer's own flavors. Heavily carbonated as I'd anticipate from the style, but its locked in a battle with the syrupy body. Gets even tougher to drink as it goes.

Pours dark cloudy apricot, under an off white short lasting head and leaving thick and splotchy lacing. Initially this one was aggressively carbonated and prickly on the tongue. After the bottle was allowed to sit open for about 45 mins, the carbonation calmed down and became more appealing and more drinkable. The nose similarly was initially sharp and somewhat off putting , but with time calmed down and became more rounded out. In short this one, IMHO, has some carbonation issues that need some special handling and perhaps will be dealt if and when this one gets brewed and aged in barrels again. Anyway, after a little time to ""calm down and cool out"" this one smells of alcohol, tastes of alcohol, apple brandy, and candied apple. Its clearly a strong, sweet and currently ""hot"" beer. I believe Scott said it's about 10%. Its heady, complex, flavorful and currently in need of some more time to age and hopefully ""relax"" a wee bit. Currently it is a warming, yet tasty and interesting sipper. I've got 10 bottles sitting in my beer closet.
