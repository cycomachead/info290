4.1,4.9,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Pours a deep cloudy gold with a foamier white head. The head is sticky and leaves small lacing once it settles down. The aroma is primarily fruity and yeasty, with hints of spices. The taste amps this profile up with the addition of a strong malty backbone reminiscent of English bitter. The body isn't too heavy but has a nice fullness to it with just a little carbonation on the finish.","delta490","Feb 16, 2015"

3.53,-9.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"So, I know it's a Tripel and therefore has a higher ABV. Still, this is a sneaky bastard. Pours a rich, dark orange with a fine-bubbled white head. Aroma starts with the yeasty, bready and moves into spice and some caramel sweetness. Flavor is a more intense version therein, but with a slight reversal. The spice notes start, followed by the fruity esters. To me, a brighter dried fruit, more like golden raisins and cranberries or currants. The yeasty flavors are of a fresher hay, and it finishes with a tart (not sour) dryness not unlike a champagne. The problem here is that this lighter-medium bodied Tripel washes across the tongue pretty easily. And the 10 ABV, which is fairly well hidden, can sneak up on you.","MisterGone","Dec 27, 2014"

3.81,-2.6,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Coming out of the bottle, it pours a light brown and translucent color. However, once inside the glass it becomes more of a mixture of a brown and golden color. Aroma is malty sweet. It reminds me of a combination of brown sugar and a hint of caramel as well as fruity banana like aromas. Taste is spicy and somewhat fruity. Elements of dark bread. Finish is quite dry and bitter. A full bodied beer. Active carbonation that tickles the tongue. Overall a very complex beer, perhaps somewhat overwhelming. The overall dryness and bitterness is somewhat over the top. Drinking this beer alone, you will definitely get quite a buzz. However, as the brothers mentioned, it might be better with a hearty meal. I had this beer with some cheese and salami. Next time, I would like to try it with a full meal.","Gajo74","Oct 31, 2014"

AROMA: strong alcohol presence with a soft and spicy aroma. vinous like aroma. no hop notes. very faint citric esters. APPEARANCE: dark gold color, almost orange. a bit hazy. average ivory head with medium-low retention. some lacing. TASTE: some spicy and sweet background profile. full alcohol presence with a vinous aspect. medium-low bitterness with a semi-dry finish. no hop flavours. faint esters reminiscent of oranges. PALATE: medium-light body. medium carbonation. no solventy character. OVERALL: a tripel that lacks a bit of aroma and flavour complexity. a bit strong on the alcohol aromas.","titvs","Oct 28, 2014"

The smell is very sweet: cotton candy? overripe grapes? But don't get me wrong--it's an inviting aroma, borne out by a toffee or caramel flavor that culminates in an aftertaste of currants.

Nice, lacy trail left on the glass after every sip, don't sip too fast or you'll feel that slightly brandy-like warmth in your chest. There is a slight bite on the tip of the tongue after each sip but it is smoothed out across the tongue turning into a sweet, smooth, slightly spicy note which lingers on the back of the tongue. Outstanding brew, I originally had it on tap and have been wanting to have it again, but the Yard House couldn't keep it in stock so I was pretty stoked when I found it at BevMo tonight - I am very happy I tried it from the bottle - very good.","TheCalifornian","Aug 15, 2013"

Also picking up yeast and a soft clove spice. Alcohol is again present. The mouth feel is soft and fairly creamy. Carbonation is pleasant. A straight up solid triple.

Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Some nice lacing clinging on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of apricot, lemon, pear, biscuit, tart grains, pepper, clove, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Decent aromas but they are pretty faint for a tripel. Taste of apricot, lemon, banana, orange, clove, bread, candi sugar, pear, grape, tart grain, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus, clove, pear, biscuit, candi sugar, and yeast spices on the finish for a while. Nice balance of flavors with decent complexity. Definitely more of a fruity tripel, but is not cloying. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that drinks quite smoothly. Alcohol is well hidden for 10% with a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable Tripel. Good complexity and balance; with nice smoothness.","superspak","Mar 13, 2012"

The mouth feel was full body but lacking in yeast as far as tripels go and carbonation was non existent I guess I should buy a bottle and see if I find a big difference.

You definitely taste the alcohol in this beer, but it's not overwhelming to me. It adds to the beer. The fruit and spice mix well w/ the malt and alcohol to create a wonderful experience. Mouthfeel is nice, fairly smooth- but there's a zing at the end and the aftertaste that lingers for a while. Drinkability is good, although at 10% ABV, I'd limit it to two. This beer always seems to have more alcohol in it than advertised, but I guess I'll believe the 10%. Effect-wise, it seems like a 13-14% to me. Anyway, I've had this beer often and it's definitely one of my favorite Tripels. This beer also significantly improves the warmer it gets. It really needs to be only slightly chilled below room temperature to let all the flavors out. Great beer, and I will definitely continue to enjoy it.","jayhawk73","Feb 26, 2011"

Very good carbonation and lacing along the glass. The drinkability for me, in spite of the high ABV was very good.

Sweet malt sensations seem muted. Starts out sweet and sticky with a slight caramel malt base and has a biting sharpness thankts to the carbonation and citric hop bitterness. There are some minor fruit tastes that are not so much tropical but more like sour grape or apple.

Flavor is really carbonated and bright. Very robust hop character and the yeast is very forward. More hops than I expected, actually. Some alcohol flavors in this 10% ABV brew. Has its complexities, but not as ""WOW!"" as I hoped. Finish is long and carries some of the good hop bitterness. This is just a step below a World-class ale, but is still a tad on the expensive side at $10.40/pint + 9.4 oz.

The taste does not disappoint either! There is truth in the advertising the aromas made and the spice or the coriander and some pepper is balanced delightfully by the honey-like sweetness.

Very much like a boiling wort or even raw bread dough. Pours into a chalice with a creamy head on top of a cloudy dark golden color. Taste is slightly bitter, consistent throughout with spicy warming sensation that travels from the middle to the finish. Mouthfeel has zest but there is not any over-carbonation.

Taste was better, not the best tripel I've had but good, sweet with light fruit note, yeast as is typical for the style and a finish of alcohol and hops. Overall mouthfeel is good, not great and not the most drinkable beer at 10% ABV though it's a good beer to have now and again.

Smells of bready Belgium yeast and spicy sweet Belgium malts. First sip is surprisingly bitter considering all the sweetness in the nose. There is a ton of biting fruits to challenge the heavy malts resulting in an appreciated balance as it finishes bitter in the back of your mouth. Even the yeast seems inline with the balance.

Aroma is dark fruit, taste is fruity with some dark spicy up front and it warms up nicely in the end. The alcohol may be a little too upfront for me - not as well blended as the Duvel. There seems to be a pretty strong pistachio-like flavor that may be putting me off - its kind of cool, though. Very good Belgian ale - very original character - totally has a taste of its own. For me, even a genuine Belgian ale that isn't quite one of the greatest Belgians out there is still better than an American take on it.","prsguitarsr4me","Mar 04, 2009"

Tastes spicy up front, and not as creamy as I would prefer, but not bad. Some more light fruits, butterscotch and mild esters work themselves across the palate. Mouth-feel is medium.

The taste, again is sweet, some honey, apricots, apple skins, a bit metallic and a noticable fusel alcohol flavor. The feel is slick but you would hardly notice since this sucker is highly carbonated, finishes sweet with a noticable alcohol belly burn. A bit of a raw tripel, could use some mellowing in the carbonation and alcohol. I would also like to see the yeast stand out some more in the flavor.

Taste starts off like you would imagine, fruity/spicy, not sure what other adjective to use. The alcohol starts to overpower the mid pallet and probably covers up some other flavors. The finish seemed to drop off, perhaps it was also due to alcohol. Overall, it's very good and tasty. I probably wouldn't buy it again for $13 a 4 pack.

The palate evolves as the beer warms: first brisk and hoppy, then perfectly balanced between fresh, sweet pale malts and subtle hops, then big, sweet and fruity/phenolic, with oranges, strawberries, cloves and nutmeg all making appearances. Quite tasty. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style, with those light malts assuming a creamy overtone, just enough hop bitterness, and big carbonation to keep things moving around the palate. Overall, this is a very well done tripel. It's not as revelatory as the icons of the style, but it's very well done and a perfect example of what a tripel ought to be.","geexploitation","Apr 07, 2008"

Very remarkable is the mouthfeel of this fine beer; extraordinarily soft, plush and velvety, and the accompanying taste has well balanced notes of banana intertwined with citric rind. As such the slightly acidic though well balanced malting and gentle hopping make for a real enjoyable product.

I found the brew overall to be a bit on the ""cold"" side.

The flavor is a bit more agreable; a bit rounder with the yeast with a touch a vanilla, just a hint of marzipan sweetness, some slightly husky graininess and then a dry finish. It's not bad, but for $10 a four-pack of 11.2-ounce bottles, I feel a little cheated. Moortgat should find themselves a bit embarrassed over this one.

This is definitely not a witkap style tripel and might be a little too much for some, but I think its a nice interpretation. Also the esters are a bit different than you'd find in your typical tripel mainly lack of banana, but all and all this is good enough for me to drink every now and then.","mmcave","Jan 04, 2007"

Taste is a dry slightly tart citrus fruitiness with a lot of peppery spiciness. Hints of vanilla, mint, and ginger ale poke through at times.

Citrus and fruity scents were present, as well as a touch of a dough-like quality was noted. A well crafted head left a slight lace around the glass. Near perfect carbonation. Flavors were overtoned by the high alcohol content (10%), and were marked with tastes of sour citrus, grain, yeast and hops. Finished with a slighly sticky sweet aftertaste.

There is a soft spiciness; I like it because it is very much at the back. I cant really decipher what the spices are (maybe coriander and ginger). Peppery. Cloves. The maltiness is grainy, almost like a Pilsner. The hops are raw and they finish the nose on a strong note. There is stray alcohol heat. On the whole, the bouquet is well rounded; it is too bad the potency isnt louder. It says, Trippel. I say inviting. The palate is raw. There is a dry bitterness that is like Duvel. Surprised? The 10% abv is not hidden; it is strong but not too hot. It adds a near perfect amount of force that works very well with the potent grainy malt base. Peppery. Cloves. There is an array of spiciness that finishes the palate with a solid thump. The palate might be a bit heavy-handed if it wasnt for the lovely tropical fruit flavors that develop and the start and last to the finish. I can detect oranges, pineapple, melon, grapes, and peaches. There is a strong honey taste too. The complexity is not mind-blowing but it is pleasing. This beer is solid. Not spectacular, just solid. Medium in body with lively carbonation, the mouthfeel is energetic and it works very well with this beer. I find this big beer to be very drinkable. When I am in Sioux Falls, SD I buy this beer when I want something Belgian because Maredsous and Duvel is all they got. It is odd though, how Ive never seen this beer any place but in South Dakota! Maybe I overlook it elsewhere, maybe it gets lost in stores with a good selection. It doesnt matter; I appreciate this beer every time I quaff it. While it is not the best Tripel on earth I like it. Worth a try, IMO.","bditty187","Feb 07, 2005"

The smell I found quite enjoyable: yeasty, aired and doughy, it had a deep fruitiness and developed some nice floral and spicy notes that, for once in a triple, werent dry but rather round and juicy. Hint of cinnamon coming out of the oven on a pie. The taste shows strong notes of apple, lacking a bit of sweetness and with a slightly tart bite. The warm sensation of alcohol was pronounced but didnt really fit my taste, although its not peculiar for a 10% triple. Citrus is present, with some lemon juice perceptible. The mouthfeel is quite consistent, but I found it a bit dry and grassy in the finish, hence reducing the beers drinkability.

Well, what I got was a total different beer. It poured a total different color. More of a clear amber color rather than the dark color that the 8 pours. A nice head, about the same as the 8 and even better beautiful lacing. Smells much sweeter than the 8. Taste almost like we are getting into a sour flemish beer territory. Kind of a tart fruity taste. Don't sense any of the nutty or coffee tastes like I did with the 8. The alcohol hides very nicely, but you can tell it's there as you keep drinking. IMO opinion, this is definitely better than the 8. But then again, they are total different beers as I found out. So, maybe to each his own taste buds. They are both great.

Topping the beer off is a large and lively head off eggshell foam. Well, on to the aroma. Very nice. Spicy and strong. Smells almost like a Jolly Roger hard candy dissolved into a shot of Capn Morgans spiced Rum. The alcohol is surely apparent. The taste is sweet and somewhat spicy with creamy spices mixed together with a sweet malt body. The finish nearly gives me the whiskey shakes. But, overall is clean for such a strong beer.

The 330 ml bottle started to overflow as soon as I cracked the cap. The smell is sharp and spicy. Extremely effervesant. The first thing I notice is now creamy this beer is smooth and mellow in the beginning. The alcohol seems to come out more towards the ending and aftertaste. As does something a bit bitter as well. I also pick up hints of caramel and honey. Very warming. Probably not my best selection for the day as the temp in my house is about 85 degrees.

Nose is quite floral with notes of honeysuckle and orange blossoms along with a bit of clove. Moderate in body with a very lively and zesty texture due to the strong active carbonation. Taste begins with sweet candied sugar along with some tropical fruit followed by notes of dry grains and yeast. Spicy hops help to balance things out towards the finish along with a bit of alcohol. A pretty nice brew and quite drinkable considering the 10% ABV.","Morris729","Jul 30, 2004"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours with a fluffy off white head that sits atop a well carbonated hazy orange gold beer. The aroma is yeasty, spicy and sharp with notes of grass, soft vanilla, and herbs. The taste is sweet up front and in the finish as well. The middle though, is sharp with a carbonic bite and a foaming tongue. The flavors I get from this beer run the gamut; from vanilla to hay, cider, yeasty/ bready, herbs, and alcohol. As this beer warms up a bit it begins to develop some funky complexity in the nose; a funky farmhouse cheese seems to have been suddenly dipped in my beer. The alcohol starts to become quite apparent in the nose as well. Visually this beer leaves some nice Belgian lacing as I work my way through the first glass of this 750ml bottle. This is quite an enjoyable Triple, I would highly recommend it to any Triple or Belgian beer lovers. If I would have to find a fault, I would say that it is just not quite complex enough to make it world class, but this is a rather weak complaint.","Gueuzedude","Jul 28, 2004"

4.51,15.3,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Although I've never had the Maredsous 6, the 8 is clearly a dubbel and the 10 is even marked on the U.S. label as a Triple. It pours a clear (unless the lees are disturbed), deep-golden body beneath a massive, rocky head of just slightly off-white foam that holds exceptionally well and leaves wide walls of lace about the glass. The nose is clean and restrained with just some yeasty fruitiness and the slightest hint of sweet malt to entice you to drink. The body is medium and mildly crisp across the palate leaving it very accessible but lacking in zest. The flavor is surprisingly full given the fact that the aroma seems reigned in; and it delivers a lightly candyish malt upfront that somehow dries as it crosses the palate to leave a dry and hoppy, spicy finish. Bitterness, hop flavor, and alcohol toss and tumble in the lingering aftertaste; but overall dryness and an herbal/spicy hoppiness win out in the end. Superb! The 10% alcohol by volume is astonishingly well-heeled; and this beer (not unlike their best known Duvel) can come around to whack you in the back of the head. Brilliant!

Dry astringency, golden raisins and citrus pith, bitters and capers, alcohol in a raw sense, black pepper. Dry and sharp finish, slight sense of metals.

Taste is very smooth and calm, well rounded and leveled citrus thats dulled down by alot, some orange, lemon, green grapes, mango, banana, and pineapple all kinda blend and make for a one of those squishy things, but not in a juicy manner, more of dull popcicle-like flavor. A strange but appealing dryness floats off the palate at the finish which is kinda interesting and nice. Feel is medium bodied with a unsharp carbonation, very easy going and mild; smooth over all with a yeasty weird smoothness that adds just a faint nudge of spice and helps dry thing out a bit at the finish.

4.8,22.8,5,5,4.5,5,5,"I can't believe how underrated this beer is! It's so much beter than Duvel. Honestly, I can't find much fault with this beer (although I've yet to try Westvleteren). It is very similar to Duvel in many respects although it seems like all of Duvel's great qualities have been enhanced in this one. Pours with a huge rocky head that hangs around for the duration. I think that the appearance is prettier than Duvel as well. It's a goregous golden color. It tastes like ripe fruit with a touch of bitterness to keep things from getting too sweet. Also, the carbonation is a little more restrained in this which makes it possible to actually swallow. If you like Duvel, definitely try this.","HossMcGraw","Feb 20, 2003"
4.17,6.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Delivered in the classic, short 11.2 oz. Beglian bottle, it pours a hazy yellow with a hint of peach. The head is thick, white, and creamy and sticks to everything it touches. A lot is going on with the smell, everything from grapefruit to moldy old clothes. The alcohol is certainly noticeable in the taste, but it doesn't detract from the experience. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and more akin to a nice thick stout. I like this one quite a bit better than Maredsous 8.","mickeymac","Feb 19, 2003"
4.27,9.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"pours a translucent,cloudy orange with an almost nonexistent white head that disappears quickly. Very citrousy, slightly acidic taste. Very pleasant in the mouth with a good fiz to it - not what you'd expect upon looking at the lack of head. The 10% abv is masked well by the carbonation (which lasts throughout the glass), but still a little sharp. Slightly metallic,nicely dry aftertaste. I think I could drink this all night long (but not a good idea i'm sure) Very easy drinking belgian ale compared to others i've had, and probably one of the better ones.","avylover","Jan 08, 2003"
3.49,-10.7,3.5,2,4,4,4,"Had an almost carbonated pour, with much head, nearly too much for one brew. The initial smell was almost of 'medicine', not good. The taste was sweet, bitter, almost a touch of cognac. Went down smooth, but for the price, can do much better. On the upside, the bottle shape is rare, a keeper.","GeoffRizzo","Jan 03, 2003"
3.6,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The color a light to moderate yellow, or amber if youre so inclined, lusty beige head with thick lace that clings in sheets to the glass. Malt dominates the nose, with hints of orange peel, also lightly sweet. Front is malt, somewhat sweet, the top is middling, with a pertinently acidic, dry and sparsely hopped finish which detracts just a bit from what is otherwise a quite quaffable beer.","Gusler","Nov 17, 2002"
4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This pours a massive white head, similar to Duvel...very long-lasting with great lacing down the glass. Slightly hazy golden liquid with quite active carbonation going on here. Nose is slight vegetal aromas, rich malts with hints of fruity yeast esters and a bit of pear...perhaps this is the same yeast strain used for Duvel as well. Fantastic flavors, sweetness from the malts, notes of honey with a nice hopping level to keep things from becoming too sweet. The powerful alcohol contained within this sweet Nectar of the Gods flexes it's mighty muscle here too. Finishes with an alcoholic warmth sensation in the throat...this is one monster of a Tripel!","beerluvr","Oct 06, 2002"
3.48,-11,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Musty nose with hints of yeast, alcohol and spice.  Pale slightly hazy look.  White head but not a creamy one at all compared to other triples I've had.  Very fruity almost peach initial taste.  Quite carbonated.. lots of little bubbles.  Big strong alcohol warmth after the initial fruit taste with a touch of pepper.  The very dry finish creeps down your throat.  The mouth is also not as smooth as I would like ... the 10% is not hidden...  It is a good beer.. but a step below others in the style.  The ABV is not balenced will enough by the malt hops side...","frank4sail","Jul 11, 2002"
3.61,-7.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a very interesting beer in that it is as potent as barleywine ale, yet completely different in character.  I would not drink it every day, but it would be enjoyable from time to time.","Pegasus","Jul 02, 2002"

3.58,-8.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: A bold but boisterous triple that is over the top in some aspects, astringencies bring this brew down. Other than that is it not a beer not to shy from, give it a try in regards to the many other great triples out there. Put this one up against a hearty meal rather than drinking it alone.","Jason","Mar 31, 2002"
