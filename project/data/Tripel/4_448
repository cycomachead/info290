4.34,4.8,5,4,4.25,4.25,4.75,"It used to be that American microbrewers floundered when it came to Belgian ales, with some notable exceptions - Allagash has always been outstanding at emulating the essence of styles such as Tripel and is one of the rare few whose brands can easily pass for the work of authentic monks. This is as fantastic an example you're going to find anyone in the world. Highly recommended.","biegaman","Dec 04, 2014"

I developed a love for Belgian style beers a couple of years back and this has to be the best one i've tried yet. Pours a beautiful gold, slightly hazy, (no chunks). If it was more clear, i'd be worried they had filtered out some of the "good stuff". Wonderful white foamy head that retained for some time. Therre was still traces of head with only an inch left in the glass. Aroma is excellant, slightly floral, not too strong, quite pleasing. Initial taste is very very smooth that lingers in the best way. Mouthfeel is excellant, no aftertaste or excessive "bite" that Beligians can get. Incredible balance of sweatness, hops and grain, with Belgian candy. No ingrediant is too much or missing Its wonderful. The alcohol balance is amazing. I could hardly tell it is there and would have never guessed it was 9%. Balance, balance, balance. No faults, nothing lacking, I could drink only this beer for the rest of my life and be quite happy. Good job guys, very well crafted.","Curtis","May 01, 2013"

Allagash knows their way around a belgian beer.","NoLeafClover44","Mar 26, 2013"

There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Due to the color and cloudiness, there was not a lot of visible carbonation. On the nose, I got a lot of fruit, specifically apple and tropical fruit. I wonder if this is the passion fruit that they mention would be apparent on the label. I don’t know exactly what passion fruit smells like, but maybe this is it? On the taste, I definitely get bread. The fruit pretty much gets lost in the taste. Although after it warms a bit, I do get some hints of lemon. I got the booze mostly on the finish of the beer. This was a little less syrupy than I expected, although I really haven’t had a lot of Belgians to be able to expect a lot. Although the booze isn’t exactly hidden, it isn’t obnoxious either. I would have this again, but this a brew that you can’t have too many of.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

Big white head and massive lacing, a beautiful presentation. Aroma of wheat, Belgian yeast and spicing and light fruit with some suggestions of orange and apple. Good body, bitter with light fruits, Belgian spicing and sweet malt. Spicy finish, which is a bit astringent, but the overall progression and flavors come together very nicely.

3.93,-5.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Allagash Tripel pours a mildly hazy light orange. Three fingers or so of airy white foam pile on top of the beer to form a nice looking head. Retention is just OK, but there's a fair amount of lacing left stuck to the inside of the glass. If I could, I'd give it a 4.25 for appearance, but as it is it doesn't warrant a 4.5. The nose has displays some very aromatic phenol notes. There's a very peppery clove aroma, that I wish was played against more fruity esters than the little bit of pear I find. There's definitely a little bit more ester presence in the flavor, with a touch of apple showing up besides the pear. The beer's still definitely headlined by the pepper and clove phenols though. The mouthfeel is very nice, with a creamy yet light body and a high, expressive level of carbonation. The body could probably stand to be a touch lighter, but that's a minor quibble. Allagash Tripel is a very nice, classic rendition of the Tripel style, and one of my favorite American versions.","axeman9182","Mar 03, 2012"

Pours hazy golden amber color with a fairly dense 1 finger white head with good retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. Small amount of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big clove, spices, grass, pepper, honey, and banana. Nice aromas with good strength. Taste of big pepper, clove, spices, banana, and grass; with some lemon, bread, and floral notes as well. No bitterness present, but there is a fairly long finish with lingering notes of spice, pepper, banana, bread, and light fruitiness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied. Fairly thick and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, only a decent amount of warming is present on the finish. Very nice complex balance of all flavors, with good drinkability for the level of alcohol. Overall, and excellent tripel with great complexity and balance.","superspak","Aug 25, 2011"

This took me quite a while to down and at the end, the potency and strength of this beer are a reminder of how true to form this is.

It has complex earthy and fruity flavors, but it is balanced by hops and malts. Even though the beer is 9%, it is so well balanced that the alcohol does not take over the beer.","ianjsullivan","Jul 04, 2011"

Almost a vanilla essence. The honey in this is definitely noticable. Thoughts of fresh cut grass come to mind when I try to put my finger on the complex blend of spices that make this pale ale a nice example of what this line of beer can accomplish. All in all, I would recommend this pale ale to others. If you are looking for a pilsner-like drink that has a clean sharp finish and is also sweet, then this may be the beer for you.","Sugarbearjones","Jul 01, 2011"

An initial sip doesn't reveal much more than a generic pale flavor, but it gets fuller as it moves to the back of the mouth with a definitive tingle. You can certainly taste the alcohol content though it's not enough to be discouraging.

Color was a very hazy orangish-yellow, thanks to my having agitated it the way I agitate my students. The nose had a tropical fruitiness, although I might not have been able to identify Passion Fruit, along with a black pepper spiciness and even some mustiness. Mouthfeel was medium and riotous with flavor, initially tropical fruit on the tongue, but then the black pepper and mustiness kicked in and it got really dry really fast. How quickly can I put this away? Kidding! It has me wondering about those "herbal notes" - Grains of Paradise? Coriander? Much too easy drinking to be safe. Jesus, it was evaporating from my glass, or so it seemed. I may have to lie down after this ...","woodychandler","Jun 02, 2011"

Slightly sweet upfront from the malt, mildly spicy with hints of pepper and cloves. Some honey as well before a dry finish. A little lighter than medium in body. Nice carbonation. Could be a little more robust. A good, solid tripel here. Nicely crafted. I think they know what they are doing at Allagash.

Definitely some peppery smell as well. The taste is how it smells. Extremely well-balanced with some awesome flavors. The zest and spices hit immediately, quickly followed by the pears and lemon. A lot of lemon on this one. Then the taste ends with the perfect amount of booziness. I really like how balanced this triple is. The mouthfeel is how it should be for this style.

Of course, the standard large foamy Belgian head fills almost half the tulip glass, with a pillar of carbonation rising from the center of the glass where the stem meets the bowl. The aroma is of sweet citrus fruit, candy & sugar. 1st sip is of sweet candied citrus fruit (orange, lemon, tangerine) peel & honey, followed by a surprisingly dry, white wine-like finish. The citrus peel flavor reappears on the swallow & lingers tantalizingly afterwards. There is a champagne sparkle on the tongue. Drinkability is off the charts...it should almost be against the law for a 9% abv beer to go down this smoothly & easily. Overall...wow, Wow, WOW!!!

The 9% ABV is very well hidden despite a drying effect on the tongue from the alcohol. Some of the fruity esters make it into the flavor and mingle with the hops to provide some citrus peel flavors and for some reason passionfruit. I am not a big fan of ageing tripels, but I think some of the flavors might meld together better with 6 months to a year on it. Very good tripel, and one of the best American renditions. Highly recommended.","twiggamortis420","Sep 09, 2009"

Taste is pretty good, but a I find many tripels to be too sweet for my taste and this is no exception, has the slightest of slight alcohol taste to it and you really have to look for it which is impressive for being 9%.

Taste follows nose, but there is some additional spice; perhaps a peppery character.

Slightly fruity, slightly spicy, yet you really can't pick out either aspect easily, they blend very well. It gets a little sweet in the middle, but quickly drops off to a slightly hoppy finish, which is more than I was expecting for the style. A little acetic throughout, has a vinegaric sourness that is most prevalent up front, but also resurfaces some at the end, mingling with the hops to provide the aftertaste that lasts. Crisp and a little dry, excellent fresh mouthfeel. Very clean, compared to some of the other american interpretations that try doing all kinds of crazy things. Not syrupy or overly cloying/medicinal in the least. A little boozey, detracting some from drinkability. I know their wit is Allagash's flagship, but compared to this, as a balance between flavor and sessionability. The alcohol presence is only a slight drawback to its overall drinkability.

The head is strong on the pour, quick to dissolve, the lacing like beach froth, momentarily deep before swiftly pulling away. The nose has a bluntness to it which shortens the clove, ginger spice as well as orange, lemon citrus. The scents of yeast and dough also light and lacking in richness, there's a little more thrust in the banana, apricot fruit scents. Medium-bodied, a big foam in the mouth scatters things and destabilizes the clarity of the beer's core message. Here the bready, yeasty component leads, followed on by clove, cinnamon spice, white citrus, honey and pear, apricot, banana fruit. Lacks true density and intensity but no problem with its general drinkability. Perfunctory finish, pacing of a toiler flushing, not fast but inevitable.","farrago","Jan 29, 2009"

Some light pepper notes also show. Taste is sweetness that quickly gives way to the spicy yeast and then the 9% gives some burn. Mouth is somehow smooth and syrupy at the same time.

Light to medium bodied and fizzy in the mouth. Feels a little creamy. The taste is fantastic. Fruity and mildly spicy and sweet, with a little bitterness after the swallow. Very well balanced with no single flavor jumping out. I like higher ABV beers and I barely notice the 9% alcohol in this one. It drinks real smooth and easy.

Aroma is grainy and yeasty with distant notes of suds and spice. Carbonation is surprisingly sharp and biting; body is light to medium. Flavor is dominated by honey and gentle malts, banana, followed by a strongly sudsy bitter backing. Light spiciness throughout, with a grassy sourness underlying. Somewhat warm, though not overbearingly so. Finish is dry and a bit numbing; aftertaste is gentle, spicy, and sour.","Night","Aug 26, 2008"

It tasted perfect until I uncorked a Karmeliet next and noticed that Allagash lacked the same level of complexity and character as its Belgian counterpart. However, I don't want to be misleading; for an American brewery, this far exceeded my expectations for the style. This is a very special tripel.","itcomesnpints","Aug 24, 2008"

Smells fruity with some yeast tones, more like a bakery smell. Taste is very nice. Smooth, ohh so smooth. Not too sweet, very flavorful. Alcohol is well masked, this definitely does not taste like a beer with 9% ABV. Carbonation is perfect, just the right amount to add to the experience. My wife even tried this one and liked it (she hates beer, only one she has ever liked was some Hefewiezen we got on draft at Brick Store). This beer did undergo an interesting transformation when I let it warm up. When very cold it is a much fruitier beer, once warmed the fruit sweetness was dulled a bit and you could pick a bit of the warmth brought on by the alcohol. Either way this too is a great beer and a good introduction into the land of the Belgian Tripel.","ClavinCliff","Aug 21, 2008"

Quite a bouquet on this one, light carmel, melons, citrus and an undertone of sweetness. On the tongue I get hints of mango and passion fruit. Light sweetness attributable to the malts, slight Belgian yeast, notes of citrus and a slight alcohol presence. Ever so slight hop bitterness in the moderately long finish.

The robust maltiness is put in check with some earthiness and a slight bitterness while some fruits, candy sweetness and a biscuity essence and texture fill the palate.

After the silky smoothness crossed my tongue, I was hit with the sweetness, a taste similar to honey. As it warmed, more banana and cloves were presiding.

A warming alcohol presence completes the picture and is welcome on a Christmas 2007 day. Drinkability might be curtailed by the high alcohol content - or not.

The flavor contained banana, oranges, white pepper, cookie dough, and lemon juice. The clean and majestic taste avoided the one flaw I've dreaded in American versions of the style, that of being too sweet. The dusty, yeasty dryness was quite welcome and refreshing.

3.82,-7.7,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Batch #83. Been holding on to this one for a while, several months at least. Spun gold meets hazy peach in the color with a foamy snow-white froth that looks incredibly sticky, but actually doesn't stay around for that long. Good solid sheets of lacing, though. A bouquet of fermenting pineapple predominates at first with aromas of sprouted grains, Golden Delicious apple juice, and ground coriander seed making noteworthy appearances along the way. The taste is a bit of a surprise for me -- it starts out fine enough with a sharp and sugary apple/pear/pineapple medley that merges into a warm, uncooked bread dough character, but the finish just seems off, with a very hard fusel alcohol presence and a sustained earthy mineral note at the very end. Tart and funky-fruity burps pique my interest enough to take further sips, and while the first half of each sip blends nicely, the alcohol-mineral edge remains every time -- even if the mineral part does soften slightly, the overall angular harshness never completely goes away. Not as crisp and dry, or as carbonated for that matter, as I like my tripels. No slickness, overall light on the palate, and never cloying. I went in expecting to like this one quite a bit more, as I'm a huge Allagash fan. Based on other experiences I've had with tripels, I get the impression that it is an extremely hard style to brew. I'm a novice homebrewer, and I'm not particularly interested in brewing Belgian styles, but the sheer complexity that must go into pulling off a drinkable example of this style is just too daunting for me to even consider. Kudos to Allagash for the attempt, but I think this is my least favorite of their offerings.","orfeu","Aug 15, 2007"

The head is solid and holds through to the end of the glass, and the color is a golden amber. Smell is light and matches with the taste, being very smooth and rich. Probably could be descibed as buttery and somewhat fruity (my opinion). Amazing that the 9% doesn't overwhelm the flavor in the least, and in fact compliments it very well.

4.43,7,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Hmm...batch #81. Pours a beautiful hazy, canary yellow with a nice fluffy, but not too airy head. The head widdles down to a mere noticeable lacing. Smells like ripe, juicy fruits such as pears, apricots, and bananas. Almost like an adult fruit punch! Upon big inhales, you can get a little bit of alcohol as well. Taste is exquisitely balanced. Nice yeasty, fruit flavors similar to that of the aroma hit the palate first. Then a well balanced bit of spice appears...it seems to be a splash of coriander and clove (to be expected), but there is also something else in there that I cannot figure out. Very smooth and velvety mouthfeel makes this a very pleasant experience. Unknowing of the ABV, you could easily drink lots of this elixir. This is simply a FANTASTIC tripel.

Flavors of pear and alcohol are predominant, with a lot of Belgian yeast thrown in for good measure. Starts with a "bite," and mellows a bit as it warms. The sweetness increases accordingly, and more of the malt character shows through. Over all, this is a very fruity (definitely pear and maybe peach or mango) tripel, with substantial alcohol and yeast presence. Mouthfeel is light, yet substantial as it warms. I'd say medium over all. Substantial alcohol warmth and bite. Finish is warm, spicy and has a lingering yeast taste. This is really very good. I love a good Tripel and this is as good as most, if not better. This was my first beer from Allagash and I am impressed. I recommend.","beerphilosopher","Apr 07, 2006"

The aroma starts off with toasted bread, candy sugar, spices (corriander, white pepper), allagash yeast and some alcohol. The flavor is also malty, with notes of toasted bread and candy sugar which are balanced with a cutting herbal and spicy bitterness, along with some alcohol.

Aroma is of candied fruits and some spice; hints of banana , apricot , pear ,passion fruit, yellow apple , herbal notes , some phenolic qualities. Sweet fruit flavors abound , most of the aromas present are melded into the complex taste , a bit of honey maltiness, some zesty spice in the finish and a very well hidden alcohol content. Leaves a pleasant and long lasting aftertaste of fruit and warming alcohol. This is an exellent Tripel. Extremely drinkable and delicious flavours in this great brew.

Sticky lacing coats the glass as I swirl this concoction and generate more lucious head. Smells of spicy citrusy goodness enter my nostrils. Tasting brings more sweet spices like cloves and coriander to the front with citrus notes in the background. A hint of alcohol is present in the background but not overwhelming. Holding it in the mouth seems to generate more carbonation and provides a creamy mouthfeel as I swallow it down. Finishes clean with remaining sweetness of spices coating my mouth but not overpowering. Not the kind of beer you'd want to slurp down after mowing the grass, but one you'd want to savor as this brew has many complexities that can easily be missed.","Schooly","Mar 27, 2006"

A huge white head froths up, filling the top of my tulip. This leaves an almost uninterrupted lacing. The aroma is sweet, almost like candy. However, there is a Belgian spiciness cutting through, along with a fairly strong hop aroma, which doesn't seem typical of the style (but is nice anyway). The streams of carbonation shoot the various tastes along the tongue. The candy sweetness is there, but it takes a back seat to the spiciness. There's also something akin to pepper in there. It finishes with a nice hop bite and a kick of alcohol, which is otherwise fairly subdued. This beer is silky smooth and almsot creamy, which is a nice change of pace.

The flavor starts off with a strong spicy character before a bit of sweet fruitiness balances it out. Plenty of doughy malt was there holding up the back as this finished with a short lingering dry spiciness. Mouthfeel is about medium with ample carbonation.

I typically am skeptical of those "Belgian style" brews but I've had Allagash before and I know they are a solid company and not simply trying to rip-off that Belgian taste. It looks neon yellow and opaque. Very frothy head that tastes oh so good and creamy. Smells very complex, spicy, herby, yeasty, and a friend said "it's like medicine," which I think is a good assessment. Is there a twinge of gunpowder scent in there? What the hell is that? I swear I smell fireworks. Wow, intense. Tastes fabulous. I love the frothy head, it adds so much to the taste unlike some other beers where you're kind of avoiding drinking the head. Very breadlike and full bodied, embodies the Belgian thing perfectly. Feels silky going down and I don't really have to say this but it's very satisfying to drink.

4.3,3.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Batch 52. Great idea to label that. Rich golden color, but with surprisingly nice density. Very herbal hop aroma. Pours great with a bright white head that is dense like meringue. Flavor starts with a very herbal spice, with hops following, finishing with a cidery tartness and slightly honey notes. Plus a warming alcohol zing. As it breathes a bit, the herbs and hops broaden and deepen, and the honey notes get richer. Not an overly malty sweetness. Also, a tropical yeasty flavor branches out. The mouth feel is quite velvety and syrupy, not something expected based on the light color. The head has some nice activity, but is mostly just tight and dense. Overall a bit sweet, but with incredible spicy depth and character. I think I will buy another bottle, to age. I think this should be a great beer to compare to itself, at a later date. I'll have to run right out to get another of the same batch. A 750ml bottle left a lasting impression. Recommended","zjungleist","Sep 03, 2004"
4.18,1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a glowing yellow-orange with a fluffy white head that left some stickage around the sides of the goblet. Sweet malts and tropical fruity yeast collide with a hoppier-than-most-tripels type of aroma. Initailly sweet, fruity, honey-like and almost cloying on the palate, but then about-faces into a clovey, phenolic, dry finish with lingering bitterness from the hops and ethanol. Healthy carbonation keeps this high ABV beer at a level that I could say is modestly drinkable. Lacing is good. It goes down smoother than some Belgians of the same strength. Truly better as it warms to about 55-60 degrees, more tropical esters come into play. My friend said it tasted like plastic. I cannot eat plastic for religious reasons, so I wouldn't know. I think he was picking up on the phenols. Overall, an excellent tripel that has its own hopped up American flair to it.","crookedhalo","Aug 30, 2004"

In a Duvel tulip, the beer was an attractive hazed golden-straw color, and was blanketed by a white head that left good sheet lacing. The nose was superbly spiced, with notes of bitter-orange peel, juicy citrus, fall leaves, coriander, and some non-descript herbalness. An awesome sour-tartness served as a counter accent to the nutmeg tinged maltiness. On the palate, an immediately spicy, lightly astringent apple-pear fruit malt base starts things off with cinnamon, nutmeg, light musky coriander, and orange juice. A tart bitterness kicked in, leading to the orange-spice finish that left nice lingering orange-tinged spice-coriander notes. A bit of warming was felt, but no alcohol was detected. This triple was masterfully balanced, and possessed a wonderful flow of flavor. The body was smooth and sort of creamy, working very well with the flavors and character of the beer.

This particular bottle was from Batch #37, aged for over a year in my cellar (er, closet). Pours a lightly hazy golden color with a lovely white head and a never-ending flow of beautiful champagne bubbles. Interesting nose holds notes of sweet vanilla, light fruit, and lightly spicy yeast.

The head retention is excellent and it maintains a solid quarter inch of cream as well as leaving almost completely solid walls of lace throughout the glass. The nose delivers a sweetish, candy laced malt that's brightened with a touch of orange, melon, and perhaps vanilla amidst a sprinkling of coriander. In the mouth its tiny bubbles foam-up on the tongue, giving a little tingle before it becomes pillowy soft and lightly creamy. The flavor expresses what the nose suggests, but with more ferver. It's vanilla is much clearer than the nose suggests, and its delicately citrusy orange character balances the candy and vanilla alongside a sublime spiciness of coriander and white pepper. Its bitterness is well heeled; and it's superbly balanced for the style - particularily given it's 9% alcohol which never fully shows! An astounding beer that's rich without being bold enough to hinder its drinkability, and complex enough to remain interesting throughout several glasses. Additionally, this is well worth stocking up on as it should appeal to a wide variety of guests in your home, and works equally well during a cool summer evening on the back porch as it does during the holiday season!","NeroFiddled","Apr 07, 2004"

I hope to track down more Allagash in the near future.","mickeymac","Dec 28, 2003"
4.72,14,4,4.5,5,4,5,"Batch # 45 pours a hazy yellow. A thick white head reaches the top of the glass and a nice lace stays for the ride to the bottom. Aroma is sweet; fruit notes are all over, bananas, green grapes, and herbal tones, cloves, and yes the passion fruit. A slight musty yeast note is also mixed in. There is a lot going on in this beer. As it warms the tones seem to mellow but the taste improves. The flavor is of tropical fruit, a slight malt back and the fruit again is there and the spices come to play. It is sweet but not a nasty sweet. More of gentle tones of the fruit, no, wait, it is honey. It has a smooth mouthfeel and the 9.0 is hidden by everything going on in this beer. This beer is simply enjoyable to drink. Another killer beer from Allagash.","Stubbie1","Dec 26, 2003"

Flavor profile contains a full alcoholic, slight honey full sweetness that is warming to the sipper of this fine beer. There is also pleasant notes of yeast within this highly carbonated offering from our friends in New England. I would say the texture has a medium body with a slightly sticky candied sugar mouthfeel.

While the Allagash Tripel was all spiced cream and fruits (mostly bananas and peaches), Kids in the Hall is Funny. While Allagash is made in Maine, the Kids in the Hall are Canadian. While this beer's beautiful bright golden amber body sparkled with constant effervescence and the thick, creamy white head sheeted and even chunked the side of the glass, it was not funny. At least not in the cross-dressing, irreverent, absurdist humor way that the Kids in the Hall were. Damn this is a fine beer, probably my favorite in the style. True connoisseurs of the style would probably disagree but I like the smoothness, the lack of the cottony mouth feel and harsh yeast-spiciness of many of the real-deal tripels.

Fruity esters that mirror the aroma emerge mid palate and when combined with the lightly peppery alcohol notes leave a sweet, but rich black licorice flavor.  Although hop bitterness is paltry, residual sweetness is well controlled and integrated into the overall fruity profile.  Moderate in body and lacking the aggressive carbonation common to many Tripels.  Truly dangerous in drinkability. Finishes with a fructose like sweetness fading quickly.  Although initially mild, ethanol warmth grows progessively stronger after each taste.  An absolutely delcious tripel.  It's batch # 22...

Huge off white head that lasts forever, so dense it protruded 3/4" over the top of the glass. Fruity aroma with classic fruit and spice flavor. A real treat and ranks right up there with it's Belgian counterparts.","John","Feb 04, 2002"
