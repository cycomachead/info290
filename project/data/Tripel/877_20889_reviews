"Medium body sweet orange with a strong hop flavor"
"Poured a nice golden color but not much head. I detected belgian candi sugars, raisins, alcohol and medicinal aromas. Taste is fruity, as in green grapes, medicinal and perhaps slightly too boozy for my taste. A dry finish leaves a phenolic aftertaste. Strong carbonation, full bodied and very alcoholic especially as it warms. This is a sipper given the high ABV. The alcohol does produce a nice warming effect. Not a bad belgian style american made ale, however, it has its flaws."

"Excellent Belgium style ale.  Worth the price.  Poured well, fresh fruity aroma, and a great solid taste with hints of spice, but not overpoweringly spicy.  Nice beer to have for a few slowly quaffed brews."

"This is one of my local NJ favorites. Tasty sweetness from a bottle. 10% is an added perk. Just saw someone reviewed this beer and gave it low scores because they don't really like Belgian beers. Not sure why they would even review it then. Of course its not an ancient monk recipe from Belgium but if you actually like a Belgian style beer give this one a shot."

"This beer has a frothy, but not too heady pour. Its initial look is a warm, almost sensual, honey and cream coloring. The aroma after the initial pour is a typical Belgian Style Ale with a spice and fruit accent that draws the imbiber in. As you drink, you become aware of hints of vanilla and clove from the malt and a hops kick near the end. In your mouth is a smooth, almost lush, caress of your tongue and gentle wash of your palate. Just bear in mind the 10% ABV can provide a real kick to those not familiar with the higher ABV that can be found in Belgian and such styled ales. This is hardly a chugging bear. It is the beer you enjoy amongst friends over an hour or two."
""
"This is by far my favorite beer.  Very smooth and delicious.  It is one that even people who do not like beer would probably enjoy.  It is dangerous though, at 10% it can hit you hard, so you have to be careful with it.  I hope to see Riverhorse able to distribute nationwide sometime soon!"

"Tasty but sweet. Not my style but I still enjoyed it"
""
""
"This is one of the single best beers I've had in quite some time. It's got a beautiful color, a rich taste, and a smooth finish for a beer that's 10% abv. I love this beer."

"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Quaffable, mild.  Not a sipping beer."
"A little too sweet for the style even with 6 months of age on it but not at a bad beer at all. Hides the ABV well and has a nice light refreshing body. Lots of flavors and hidden complexities as well with bubble gum being very prominant"

"great tasting tripel that sneaks up; at 10% this can be deadly"

"I am from NJ and could not image a smooth 10% ABV to come from Ewing, NJ but River Horse does a nice job here. Beer has a nice smooth taste. Appearance is very good and has a great appearance. Mouthfeel shows the Belgium style ale. Went down very smooth. Would purchase again."
""
"Saw this on the shelf with 4 varieties of River Horse, went for the high test, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a very sweet malt aroma with some spice. Pours to a translucent deep orange with a wispy head that fades fast. On the taste the first thing that hits is the mouthfeel, this brew is syrup thick. On the taste there is a sweet fruitiness with citrus and banana esters. Consistent taste throughout then the real flavor comes through in the aftertaste: a little bite of very slightly bitterness mostly tart and a sense of the ABV that this brew packs but it still remains very hidden. An extremely smooth drinker, too smooth though in that it doesn't have much going on and that with a 10% ABV is a stealth bender."

"Almost perfect Belgian Triple in my book."

"Golden yellow in color with a murky, viscous appearance. Poured with a short, dense, white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Medium bodied with rich tangy, slightly subdued carbonation. Sweet banana and yeasty aromas with spicy corriander notes. Sweet banana flavors and yeast up front transitioning to tangy spices through the middle. Spicy, corriander and yeast flavors intensify from the middle to end. Finishes with a heavy, yeasty aftertaste,"

"Now this is a winter beer! Though I wouldnt hesitate to drink it at other times too. Loaded up on alcoholic goodness, excellent for piling up the beer sweaters, but careful, cuz it doesn't taste like a 10%er. Pours an opaque golden amber brown sugar honey gold. Crisp, carbonatey, and creamy on the mouthfeel. Taste is ruddy, very balanced, malty enough for anyones liking but not overdone. I really like it. Certainly not a session beer and not just cuz of the awesome ABV; its like a fine desert in how rich it is. But perfect on a snowy day like today. If gingerbread men could drink, this would be their beer (cuz their not gonna drink ginger beer, thatd be canabalism). Cheers!"

"Bottle to Brooklyn tulip at Brass Rail in Hoboken. My first New Jersey rate! Pours a murky yellowish orange with a small ring of white head. Aroma of banana, clove, yeast, booze, pears. Flavor follows similarly with banana, clove, spiciness, pear, apple, honey, yeast. Very very sweet and boozy for the style, but a mix sipper. Heavyish mouthfeel with low carbonation. An interesting interpretation of a tripel and a bit on the boozy side but not too bad. Worth a try, especially for ticking Jersey."

"Overall: An ""interesting"" beer that could have taken both its sweet and spicy flavors down a notch to create more of a balance. I'm all for experimental brews, but this wasn't so much creative as it was...out of whack, for lack of a better term. I did feel, however, that my reaction was quite subjective and this could be someone else's absolute cup of spiked tea."

"Overall not bad for under 3 bucks for a single. A very flavorful high octane Belgium ale that may not be traditional but is still very well crafted and delicious."

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Smells of brown sugar and bananas. Sweet and malty on the fore with no lingering kick from the high ABV. Silky smooth mouth-feel. Loved my first experience with Tripel Horse, but will have to try it again to dive in a little deeper."

"Tasty and strong American-style version of a tripel that isn't quite a tripel. But its still a decent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"""Brewed with spices"" but hardly tastes like it ~ hardly worth explaining let alone trying or even finishing"
"Poured into a pint glass and little head developed. Came and went fast, no lacing (10%ABV). Appearance is cloudy and dark yellow to orange in color. Aroma has some grain and citrus notes, not very potent aroma. Taste was gummy with citrus notes (orange). Also a taste of alcohol. Mouthfeel is heavy, but not creamy, just heavy. Aftertaste of alcohol."

"A nice tripel. Nothing mind blowing."

"Overall decent, more like a double Belgian wit but that can pass as a tripel these days since most American brewers seem to think that that is what a tripel means. However, well done wheat, spices, citrus, nice esters and phenols, and nice booze warmth."
"River Horse Tripel Horse pours a mildly opaque orange, with a few tangerine highlights. A slightly aggressive pour yields two fingers of frothy white foam quickly rising up and spilling out of the glass a little bit. Head retention is decent, but there's not much lacing left at all. There's a little bit of banana bubblegum to the nose, with some delicate nutmeg aromas providing a bit of balance. There are some peachy stone fruit and banana flavors to greet my palate, before a warming booze and the more citrus coriander notes set it. The nutmeg and clove finish is very subtle. The balance just isn't there for me though, it's too much fruit and citrus that's not offset enough by the nutmeg and spice. The mouthfeel is very mediocre for a Belgian style beer. The body is to flabby, but just by a bit. The real issue is in the carbonation which is noticeably lacking in its liveliness. Tripel Horse is an alright brew, but it's not a great Belgian style beer, and it's probably not even the best tripel brewed in the state (which would be Flying Fish Exit 4)."
"Mouthfeel - Soft carbonation, heavy body, very soft but the heat is slightly off putting."
"O: Average tripel. I was not impressed by the smell or taste."
"Overall it's not a bad beer but not one that I enjoy that much."

"Sweet taste, like a banana split. Like Blue Moon on Steriods. Love this Beer! I like my beers less hopped. This stuff is almost like mead. It's a Belgian Style Tripel, but it doesn't say what the base is. I presume it's wheat based. Just went to their website says Pilsen, White Wheat and Caramel 15. This is the best beer I have tried in a while."
""
"Overall this is just a subpar example of a Belgian style ale. Too boozy and phenolic and just a pass for me going forward."
""
""
""
"This is a dry beer that drinks very easily. When you factor in the 10% ABV you have to really watch yourself or you could end up feeling the effects quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and look forward to enjoying it again."
"Riverhorse Tripel has a fantastic golden color. It is a Belgian-style ale that was served to me in a pint glass at 516 Kitchen in Syosset. It pours with a very thin white head with a clear golden color.  Aromas of raisins, sweetness, & caramel hit the nose.  A syrupy spicy feel in the mouth with tastes of golden raisins, plum, & sweetness with slight alcohol kick. This a really great beer!"

"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden-orange with a short lived, foamy, white head. Aroma is of ripe peaches followed by musty yeast, bready malt and hint of hops. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of ripe fruit, yeast, spices, piney hops and alcohol. Finish is long and very spicy. Nice brew."
""
"M: Moderate carbonation works with spicyness but doesn't help the overall flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is a bit of a fail. Yellow pour with a large off-white head, aroma is incredibly spicy with orange, pepper, coriander, and allspice. Taste is also a bit of a train-wreck, odd yeast followed by sugar, candy malts the spices listed above. Mouthfeel is medium-full, although it is quite boozy. Overall I'd recommend skipping this one, no one can be great at all things."
""
""
""
"O: An alright tripel, though nothing special. Even with a decanted pour, the yeast dominates the nose and palate. It'd be nice to have more balance and depth as well as a higher attenuation."
""

""
""
""

"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a huge fluffy bone white head that sticks around forever. Smells floral with malty caramel and twinges of pomme fruit. Yeasty esters abound reminding us of its pedigree. Taste is malty sweet with caramel and light green apples. An abundance of ethanol or higher alcohol meld with spicy phenols in a long sweet finish. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet almost sugary mouthfeel. Decent flavorful tripel, but a bit rough with alcohol burn."
""
""
""
"Overall - Great Triple-ish beer, though keep in mind the 10% ABV, you want to be careful drinking too many at one time ;) Also due to the strength it does get smoother with age."
""
"O: Is there such a thing as an imperial hefeweizen? Doesn't taste like a typical tripel, but I like it alot."
""
""
""
"o: glad i got it as an extra, but dont think i would seek it out on purpose. seems flat maybe a touch oily and the spice dominates the belgian yeast a little too much."

"Had the guys at riverhorse tried to not like this delicious brew with a style it does no justice too, I would've given it a higher score."
""
""
""
"Overall- this seems like a semi-session-able beer but there would be a world of drunk waiting for you. after one i feel like I drank one tastier blue moon but feel tipsy like I drank 3. Very enjoyable, I can't compare it much to other tripels cause ive never had a real one before. However this is a above average/near perfect brew. Impress your friends with this and see them get hammered cause the alcohol taste is almost non existent. Will definitely buy more, especially cause the brewery is ~45 mins away from me."
"Had this in the cellar a good two and three years, and even that couldn't save it. Hot, simple and unsubtle. River Horse just don't do great work."
"Certainly not a session beer at 10% and flavor wise, this beer is more for sipping."
"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"Overall: this beer is far from perfect, but I find the spicing welcoming. Summer is turning into fall here, so maybe the clouds and drizzle are making me appreciate it more. In any case, this is a tripel I'd have again."
"This beer poured out as a golden yellow color, pretty big fluffy white head on it. The smell of the beer had some decent wheat like aromas and a little bit of spices on the nose. The taste of the beer wasn;t too bad, I found that it was pretty close to what I would consider a good Tripel. Some of the flavors were a little off which is understandable. The mouthfeel was also decent, found it to have a good body and was drinkable. Overall it's an above average Tripel, wouldn't need to have it again though."
"Overall, I'd call this an average triple. yeast scents and flavors are solid but a little two sweet in the flavor profile."
"Pretty darn good trippel, not the best ever but hits the spot. Pretty drinkable considering the strength. Tastes more like an imperial wit than a trippel to be honest."
"Will seek this out again, as this beer was tasty, complex and hid the alcohol almost completely. This gets extra points for hiding that 10% ABV so well behind an enjoyable flavor."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, however it didn't taste like a classic tripel style. Like a good tripel it brilliantly masked the high ABV but it wasn't as light bodied as I would expect and drank more like a Belgian Strong Pale Ale."
"Final Thoughts: It's alright. It meets alot of the things that I would consider of the style, so I guess its good. But I wouldn't buy this one again. Just not my bag I suppose. Good bannana nose though."
" The Tripel is pretty mediocre flavor wise, it has some malt flavor, but mostly it just tastes sweet and simple with a yeasty tropical accent which comes off as ripe banana with a dash of spice. The flavor turns to alcohol pretty rapidly which is not quite like pure alcohol but doesn't really do anything to help matters. I would only recommend this if you have to try it because I have had more than enough of this (my wife would not split the bottle) since I had to drink 12oz myself."
"Overall, I'm in the middle ground. It is not the best Tripel I have had, but it certainly is not the worst. The crafting of the beer is a bit sloppy in that I think the sweetness is too strong and the 10% is not hidden as well as it could be."
"Quite drinkable as a bedtime sip or late night with cold pizza, say. Quite creamy and mouth-filling when you pour another inch after it's been open a while."
"overall an ehh for me. i have had much better in the style for sure."
"O: I am originally from New Jersey, and I wanted to try to support state owned micro-brews. I was curious how this tripel would taste, and now I know. The smell is decent; though, honey dominates the aroma profile The taste is also okay. It has a lot of different flavors. It also has a lot of alcohol. Typically, tripels have a lot of alcohol; however, the better tripels balance the beer so well the alcohol is not obvious. This is not the case with this beer. It is not a beer that is so bad that it is not drinkable. However, there are a lot of other delicious tripels for roughly the same price. You will not be angry if you buy this beer, but it is not a beer to buy again."
"On the whole, a solid example of the tripel style. It's not going to wow you if you've had better, but it's a good on-tap substitution if you're craving a good Belgian-style beer amidst the litany of BMC product like I was."
"M: The mouthfeel is low on carbonation, allowing the relaxed flavors to linger just a little while longer."
"On tap at a beer festival poured into a sampler glass. From notes: Moderate notes of grain, lemon and perfume for the malt and hops, light to moderate dough and soap for the yeast, with hints of clove in the background. Head is small frothy whole with good lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is mostly clear yellow. Flavor is moderately sweet to start and finishes moderately sweet and a touch bitter. Palate is light to medium, creamy and has a soft carbonation. A pretty good Abbey Tripel that leans a little to much on the sweet side."
"O- Decent Belgian knock off, worth a try."
"Easy drinking with an eye on the occasional hotness, this made for a great serving."
"very smooth mouthfeel, although higher carbonation. the bit of age has mellowed any alcohol bite that it might have had."
"This is quite a easy drinking beer for a ten percenter. Taste is really good, feels really nice in the mouth. I wish I had one more of these to enjoy but the alcohol sneaks up on you."
"OVERALL GRADE: B-/B"
"It's got the yeast characteristics I seek out in tripels, but the 10% alcohol is not overpowering. It goes down smooth, with nice floral and banana notes. Ales brewed with spices are often overpowered by their spices, but not here, where the application is subtle."
"D: overall, a pretty good example of an American tripel. easy drinker with a manageable alcohol component."
"As a fellow New Jerseyian I find the tripel horse to be a pretty decent beer. For such an alcoholic beer it is rather drinkable and I get hints of coriander and lemon in the beer. I would get this beer again and I am proud it comes from the Garden State."
"M- Chewy and sticky, this cloudy brew is complex and interesting. I think the biggest difference between this beer and the best in its class is the easily identifiable alcohol. It is still easy to drink, especially for 10percent, if my attention needs to go nowhere else then I could easily drink a few. This is my favorite or River horse beers and I am very happy to live within walking distance of them, the brewery tour they give is informative and tasty."
"Smells fruity and sweet when poured. Belgian style with hints of coriander and nutmeg. Not too flavorful. Very alcoholic. Smooth and spicy. Local NJ brew."
"There are moments of Belgian Tripel in this beer, but there is a lot of sweetness that makes it difficult to find."
"D: It's difficult to rate drinkability in a 10% ABV beer, but as far as it goes, this is on a par with the Belgian beers I had in Europe this summer."
"d- Drinks a little too easy for 10% ABV... just sayin. It tastes boozy and has a nice little burn but it taste good and its easyt o get carried away! Could only dirnk one or two before wanting to move on."
"Overall: The beer was pretty good. I wasnt amazed by it, and there are definitly better triples out there."
"Mouthfeel was vibrant and creamy. Alcoholic and slightly burny, but not too agressive. I think I'll give my other one some time and see how it transforms."
"Overall pretty tasty but I can't drink more than one of these without getting a little silly - I tend to avoid double-digit alcohol % beers because things ain't pretty when I'm silly."
"this is a nice drinking brew. tasty and sweet. had it ice cold and the sweet was to much for me but 50 degrees and this one comes home.the high octain is absoltely invisable and it just gets better as visit goes on.like to age this just to see if it changes at all."
"Drinkability: This is an interesting take on a Tripel. Its not as yeasty as I'd expect a tripel to be nor does it have the green orchard fruit flavors I like in my favorite tripels. But that being said I'm enjoying this beer and it makes up for some of its defects by being quite pleasant to drink. With this ABV it is a ""one a night"" beer that I'll probably have again one day, but its not the first Tripel I'd reach for while shopping."
"Of course, this packs a wallop in terms of the alcohol but that's to be expected. I couldn't have more than one of these in a sitting but that has more to do with the style than how this beer was brewed. While not the best Trippel out there, it's nice to see a New Jersey Brewer give this a go and for an occasional foray into something rare, this wouldn't be a bad choice at all!"
"Calling this a Tripel is a stretch, as without a doubt it's closer to a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Phenols and esters bring it to that level. Perhaps we are splitting hairs here. We'll simply deem this beer worthy of a try."
"This isn't too bad, and could probably be a very good American tripel if it were using a better yeast strain. I just want to see some more Belgian yeast character. The fruit and spice notes are nice, and the level of sweetness is good. Some more yeast-derived complexity and this could be a very good American tripel."
"Nice mouthfeel, not to light or heavy, just right and perfect for a nice cool night like tonight."
"The harsh finish makes this a good sipper, but one is plenty for me."
"Drinkabililty - Not for me."
"A tripel horse...what an abomination of nature! It pours a hazy amberish-straw topped by a quickly-fading finger of white foam. The nose is straight tripel, comprising pepper, Belgian-y yeast, cardamom, a hint of coriander and citrus peel, and wheat. The taste generally follows, though the usual spiciness is drowned out by a wave of citrusy wheat. This is a bit of a letdown after the smell led me to believe other things were coming to me. The body is a nice medium, with a lightish carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, not the best tripel out there...there seems to be a lack of the necessary spice and tripel-ness. Something like that."
"D-Not good at all, the alcohol is way too present and I'm pretty sure that's what is ruining this beer for me. I can't get by the alcohol, it totally overwhelms the rest of the flavors in this beer. Things seemed so promising based on the nose."
"D - A decent sipping brew but lots of alcohol taste."
"D - Drinkable tripel. A little less ""boozy"" and this beer probably would have gotten a 4.0 in the drinkability category."
"D: You definitely need to let this one warm up a bit to appreciate it. Triples are meant to be slowly enjoyed but this is relatively easy to consume since it comes in 12 ounce bottles."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a 25cL chalice. The beer has a tarnished golden hue, somewhere between dirty straw and copper. There was a modest white foam head that has settled down a bit, leaving a thing coat of tiny bubbles. There is some patchy lacing. I can see a lot of carbonation within the glass. There is a yeasty and fruity aroma to the beer. There may be a hint of vanilla in there as well. There is certainly some vanilla in the flavor, as well as some alcohol, sweet sugars, and an overall creaminess. I like the creamy character, but there is something about the alcohol aftertaste that I do not like very much. It also leaves a bit of a mouthcoating that is characterized by the leftover carbonation bubbles sticking to my tongue. It has a medium body and leaves some stickiness on my lips. This is a fairly drinkable beer. As I mentioned, I don't like the aftertaste too much, but besides that I am enjoying this glass. I don't think I'd go for more than one bottle; there are more easily sessionable tripels available to me that I'd rather go for, such as Allagash or Karmeliet."
"Drinkability is good for the style . I enjoyed this slightly more than an Affligem that I had last night. Seems to be more complex, but perhaps that is why I enjoy it more whereas the Affligem Tripel is a little more nutty / clean."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is somewhat sweet, fruits and yeast. Taste is good, fruits, malts, a touch of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality brew."
"D- Smells good, tastes good, and goes down as smooth as a 10% abv brew can."
"From looking at the reviews I sense we are reviewing different batches from this small brewery."
"Drinkability is pretty good take a decent Belgian Tripel and soak a few hops in it and you get this"
"Overall - A winner"
"D: This one has a warmth that is a bit harsh and somewhat more sour than sweet as a tripel should be. It is drinkable but needs some mellowing."
"It poured nicely into a sniffer glass leaving about a finger of awsome and tasty white head....Color deep amber. the sweet taste doesn't stay with young which I like. This is by far the best RIVERHORSE I have had."
"Would I buy more of it? - I think I would. Maybe another trip to the brewery is in order."
"Overall a very nice, if sweet, tripel. Leaves a wonderful banana aroma in the mouth after drunk. My first brew from River Horse, and I must say that it exceeded my expectations."
" Like I said, I've had a few other tripels that I have enjoyed. This is not one of them."
"Appearance is a dark golden color with a nearly three finger head in the wide wine glass that I poured it into, nice. Onto the smell; a familiar scent, subtle malt, some citrus aroma, along with a sweetness. Taste consists of yeast, spice, wine, and sweetness. The mouthfeel to me is a bit richer than the rest of the characteristics of this offering from River Horse. The yeast and the heavy alcohol content linger for a bit. Drinkability on this tripel is good, but not as easy as some other out there. I say try this if you run into it on your local shelf."
"On tap at The Ginger Man. Pours a deep cloudy orange with a thick white head. Aroma of floral hops and light fruits. Flavor is sweet and fruity with Belgian yeast and candi sugar. Hmm, despite the commercial description, I thought this was a bit sweet. on the heavy side with its 10% abv. Good tripel."
"Drinkability: As far as Belgian tripels go I would definitely have this again."
"A tasty beer to be sure, but at 10% ABV, a tought one to come back to. I enjoyed my one and then called it a night."
"This stuff is crap with a capital C. I want the $17.00 that I spent on the six pack back."
"Pours hazy golden with a lot of carbonation and a fluffy white head. The aroma is thin, grainy and phenolic - sweet, with rosewater and orange. The flavor tastes of molasses and ginger, like a liquid gingersnap, with a strange, almost disengaged bitterness. Elements of orange and a bit of spice. The mouthfeel is thin and pleasant. The alcohol burns a bit on the finish, but is otherwise well balanced."
"D- Prefer the overall taste and balance of the Double, but this one is still very good."
"Overall: Citric flavors maintain throughout this rather masked tripel--I am blushed but not smashed by its ABV, with a true lack of afteburn...turns a bit fruity at its end and the only knock I have is its lack of a truly pronounced signature trait... a great add to their rather drinkable twelve-pack..."
"Pours a cloudy amber with 2 fingers of sticky foam. Nose is grapefruit, apple, pineapples and mangos. Hints of grass, pine and toffee as well. Very fragrant. Strong apple flavour up front with resinous grapefruit in the back. Sweet, with alcohol sneaking through on warming. Well balanced bitterness. Substantial mouthfeel with a bit of hard carbonation. Definitely a sipper, and leaning towards the sweet side."
"This may not have the real taste of a tribel but its a good start and for the price. The 10% helps drinking one or two of these."
"D - enjoyed it, however...much of the beer is not to style of a belgian triple...but then again that seems like the growing trend anyway"
"I haven't really enjoyed any of the tripels I've tried, but this one's pretty decent. It's still a little off, in my opinion, and I doubt I'd want any more, but I'll have no problem finishing this glass."
"Overall, not too shabby. River Horse is getting much stronger these days."
"Blipped ""King Horse"" by Elvis Costello"
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my Maredsous chalice. Appears a hazed copper color with about a finger of quickly fading, bone white head. Aromas and flavors are of spicy yeast, apples, fruity esters, and sweet malt. Medium in both body and carbonation. Not as sweet as I was expecting for a tripel, which led to a higher than average drinkability for me."
"I have few complaints with River Horse's Tripel. I love the aroma and I really like the taste. I'd buy this regularly if I could. It doesn't drink exactly like a classic Belgian tripel but it's a lot closer than many American micro-breweries have come. I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe; with a little bit more attention to detail this could be one of the best."
"I can't really find anything wrong with the mouthfeel and this is a very drinkable beer. Good job, River Horse."
"Really digging the label art."
"My first review, but not my first beer. I thought it tasted great on its own merits. As an American Belgian Triple-style without the price tag and from a local (for me) source, I found it exceptional. It paired great with whatever food I put it with and it has a nice complexity on its own."
"Very drinkable not too sweet like alot of Americam made Belgian style Triples. will definitly have this one again"
"M: Personally like the mouth feel, it makes you stand up and notice this beer, This isn't Grandpa's bud and it tells you that with"
"This is a big beer. I don't know how to take it to be honest. It has good traits and bad. The lack of carbonation really hurts it. The flavor is nice, sweet, and fruity but the sweetness becomes a bit much."
"I'd give this one another go, though I wouldn't place it at the top of my preferences. It's not the most beautiful-looking beer, though interesting to look at. Perhaps a mystic could use it to read fortunes in the suspended matter."
"Pours a cloudy, dark orange with a great big white head. Smells are very fruity, sweet, and spicy, with big orange zest element and a bit of alcohol making its presence known. Very fruit-forward on the palate, bubblegummy, quite sweet. A bit too sweet for anything but tiny sips but undeniably tasty. I especially like the aggressively spicy finish. Body is very lively with carbonation crackling like electricity before smoothing out as you mull it around. A very welcome companion during this snowy weather we're having in DC."
"What an outstanding triple from an American brewery. And for the price, it's hard to beat. Pick some up and try it!"
"Not terrible, simply not what I look for at all in a Tripel, and is simply a bit off style to me."
"Mouthfeel is pretty average, it's a little bit too carbonated, but medium bodied and with a good consistency. Astringent bite sucks."
"12oz bottle poured into glass. A hazy orange color with a creamy white head. Nose of fruits and spices. Strong taste of apple and spices I can't put my finger on. Lingering aftertaste of apples that lasts for 5+minutes. Great cover of the alcohol content in this one. Very enjoyable. Slightly carbonated with a medium body. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and it was quite reasonably priced. Would highly recommend it."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a thin foamy white head. Aroma of spice, pepper, sweet fruit, caramel and alcohol. Well balanced winter beer with peppery spice and sweet fruit notes. Slightly watered down with strong alcohol warmth."
"D: At 10.0% abv the alcohol presence is noticeable making this a slow steady sipper leaving a good warming sensation."
"Light amber color with a white head about a finger width in depth. Fairly strong flavor of apple, spices, and vanilla. A nice belgian for starters but not quite up to par with most triples. Slight alcohol finish but not overpowering. According to the bottle, aging can contribute to the quality of the beer."
"D: not a bad beer, but not a good example of style. good for the beer rookies trying to get into different styles."
"overall not a perfect tripel by any means, but a nice attempt at one. A little to much on the sweet side and the alcohol is a little more noticable than i would like. the label recommends letting it sit some time, i wonder if aging would do anymore justice to this beer. Keeping one in the cellar to see if this holds true"
"Honey-amber color. Thin slightly off-white head. Aromas of soapy spicy coriander, Noxema and alcohol. Flavors are the same with prickly carbonation, medium body, and a malty/alcohol sweet finish tempered by some spicy bitterness. The alcohol isn't on every sip though, so every few sips I find that I like this. Not so much in between."
"This hippo is easy to consume, but far less complex than should be expected from this style. Still it is enjoyable, and worth visiting again."
"Overall I wasn't too impressed with this Tripel. You can do better..."
"The body is a clear gold with a short white hed, all good so far. The aroma is a bit odd with fresh, cut apples with spice. The flavor has more of the apple with light clove with an odd malt sweetness that reminds me of extract beer. Still, the drinkability of this 10% brew is quite good. Unfortunately, the flavor doesn't make me want to continue."
"Drinkability of a 10% ABV brew...Highly likely!!! What more can be said. Nose had slight vanilla undertones and finishes quite dry. Since the higher ABV allows this brew to get better with age...let's see what happens when we keep this one for a few years to mature!!"
"Cloudy orange colored ale with a very slow fading head.Aroma is faint but kind of fruity.Taste is lemon,honey and butter.Although the abv is high it is well hidden.A decent job by River Horse.I will buy again and give their other products a try also!!"
"The feel is smooth for a Belgian of any kind, especially one that's 10%. Buttery, honey feel. A very nice, deceptively easy drinking Belgian. Well done."
"It pours auburn with nice ruby tones. Aroma of alcohol warms the nose. Brandied fruits, spice--clove and anise--yeast in the back. A fluffy head fills the glass and laces it very nicely. Instantly warm in the mouth all the way down to my gut. Flavors of mild chocolate and sugary brandied fruits--similar to the aroma. Presence of carbonation helps speed the warmth--which lingers quite a bit. This is a strong beer. Drinkability is low due to the aggressive warmth. Good for those chilly nights when you just can't wrap up in enough blankets."
"This is a disappointing beer. I wanted to like it and I certainly tried. I just can't get there. Suffice it to say it needs a lot of work."
"Overall - For a cheaper buy this is very good! A good Belgian tripel interpretation. Has a hoppy kick in the finish but it works well in this one. I had this one straight from the fridge to see how it warms up while drinking and it is a good change in the experience. No freshness date on it but believe it would have a decent shelf life. I thought my bottle was pretty mellowed out and decently complex already so it may have been bottled a little over a year and a half ago. Would love another to age."
"slightly sour, and mildley sweet, but bland from start to finish, for the color that this one poured i thought that it had real potenshel, but it is just average. i dont hate thiss one but i am in no hurry to have anouther one eather. altho the after taste grows on you. i think this one would be better with age"
"Taste/mouthfeel: Good God, this is cloyingly sweet. Sugary as hell with an almost excessive spiciness. Clove, nutmeg and coriander with a refined white sugar sweetness is how I'd describe this. Light bodied, slightly overcarbonated and horribly sweet. If you enjoy eating sugar packets you may enjoy this. Personally, I think I'll grab something drier."
"Smooth slightly sweet and tart on the tongue. Hints of citrus. Very nice, lightly malted, yeasty esters, at the close. Carbonation keeps this fairly light for a 10% abv. Alcohol is well hidden, although it begins to show its heat at the end. This is a very fine example of the style. Mouthfeel is full, although drinking more then 2 would begin to diminish flavor returns. Very tasty."
"The beer pours a nice light amber with a good head that's whiteisn with amber highlights. The aroma is a burst of sweet malt and caramel. The taste starts off with a big sweet malt, then gives you some banana, caramel, and vanilla. Finally it closes with a cleansing burst of hops. The feel is medium with a slight oilieness. This one really caught me off guard. RH normally is a little higher on hops than I enjoy, but here they used more hops than you usually see in a trippel, but the really hit the mark with it. This is one that I will be buying more of."
"Pours a five+ finger (pour slowly) white head that fades slowly and leaves traces of lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Cider nose. Flavor is sweetish cider and fruit. High ABV is hidden, nice tripel. $2.45 for a 12oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"Heady tropical fruit sweetness at the front of the palate. Sugary and juicy. Plenty of estery bananas and cloves. Stays sugary as some toasted grains and hints of pepper and vanilla come in. Slight alcohol bite/warmth in the finish. Lingering sugary fruits. Overcarbonated, fizzy mouthfeel is a power-down. Won't let the beer stay on my tongue! Too bad, because this is a tasty tripel."
"Not so awesome."
"D - Drinkability is about average. Most characteristics of this beer are bland but it somehow still has enough flavor to keep me remotely interested. At 10%, it goes down easy. Unfortunately, this is just not what I look for in a tripel."
"A disappointment...."
"Good beer. Not a top Triple but a good beer to have from time to time. River Horse should be proud of Triple Horse."
"When poured into a Snifter, the River Horse brew is a bright golden orange with a head of white foam that was about 1/2 inch in height. The retention was OK, but it did manage to leave behind a small island of white bubbles, foamy white rings, and a spot or two of lace. The aroma was mild with citrus fruits, citrus hops, cloves, and fruity esters. If it's swirled around a nice sized aroma of ripe banana will emerge from the background. The taste strated off with citrus fruits and fruity esters. After the esters have passed, in comes banana, cloves, citrus hops, and alcohol infused with citrus flavoring. It was a medium bodied beer with a faint aftertaste of yeast, cloves, and citrus hops. It however mask it's high 10% ABV. Not the best Belgian Triple, but it is a decent American one. It's one of the better River Horse beers."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a burnt orange/amber color with a head that is rather small for a Belgian. The head settles quickly (due to the 10% abv?) into a modest collar that sticks to the glass. I don't get much of the vanilla esters in the aroma, i'm reminded more of a the aroma of peach Jolly Rancher candy. VERY sweet aroma, decent carbonation. Taste isn nowhere near as sweet as the aroma (thank goodness). Slight hint of the peachy/vanilla aroma with a sharp dry spiciness. There's a kind of peppery bitterness on the end and in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat sparkly. All in all, an interesting Tripel. Not anywhere near the best i've had of the style, but not something i'd turn away from. I'm gonna have to age one of these & do a comparison."
"First-ever brew from River Horse - a brewery located in my home state of NJ... Nice, lucid, clear appearance with a decent frothy head that soon tapered off... smell was somewhat non-descript, although a sweet, honey-laden aroma with alcohol esters was certainly noticeable... very rich, ultra-sweet taste replete with caramel, vanilla, honey, and candied sugars is present along with a strong, undeniable alcohol presence with a noticeable 10% ABV... the strong alcohol content makes itself known... decent mouthfeel, and only average drinkability due to the strong alcohol presence which rides the tongue and doesn't let go... otherwise, candied sugars, vanilla, and phenols are depicted... certainly not the best representaion of the style, but not the worst either... an above average brew but certainly not above and beyond... all in all, worth a try..."
"I think the bottle was $2, which was generous of the manager, as they don't sell singles. For 10%, being so easy, & so delicious... I think they're just flat out lying. :D"
"D: Not too drinkable. The malts and the citrus taste and smell are excellent, but the alcohol takes a little bit from the beer. The burning sensation on the palette takes a little bit from the taste, but still a decent session beer. I do not think I would be able to handle too many of these just because of it."
"Enjoy!"
"Someone suggested years ago that I revisit this one and I finally did. I upped the scores a bit but this still isn't all that good. I was able to discern some soft fruit notes but this is just way too sweet. The finish was an unpleasant medicinal artificial sweetener with hints of cloves. The mouthfeel seems to have improved, this bottle was soft and full bodied."
"Mouthfeel is light yet creamy. Carbonation is on the high side but it is fairly drinkable."
"This beer had a grainy texture, and was unique to the style, but worth a try."
"D: Almost too drinkable for the ABV. Easily could have put a few away without thinking twice."
"This stuff is quiet potent, but you'd never know it from tasting it. I could guzzle this if I had to, but why let it go to waste? Sip after sip, I just can't get tired of it."
"Pours a cloudy golden, real nice colour, small white head forms, some lace spots, decent retention, settles to a thin layer and ring. Smell is strange, sweet and caramelly, citrus, bit of floral, almost a skunkiness, sugary, touch of alcohol but well hidden. Taste is very sweet, candi sugar like, spices, Belgian yeast, quite bready, bit of citrus, more sweetness, some alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, nice warming. Few weird aromas and flavours, very sugar, but smooth and pretty drinkable."
"I was expecting more based on the other reviews."
"It's a decent beer. I was happy to get something so big from the BOTM."
"Poured a hazy light orange with some reddish hues- very nice looking, and there's lace as well. Decent yeasty spiciness, not overpowering and the malts used in this brew also come through in the aroma- resinous clove-like scents, with sweet doughy bread. Taste is also very good- for those who like belgians but not the overpowering yeast some tripels possess, this one is for you. Dark fruits, floral yeast and sweet caramelized malts. Good slick body, mildly carbonated and dry in the finish. Alcohol is relatively high, but almost undetectable. This is a very decent offering, an american micro version which manages to mix complex flavors well, while keeping it accessible to those who may be afraid of strong belgian flavors."
"The beer hides the high alcohol content fairly well. Unfortunately, there was some harshness (from alcohol or bitterness...?) that covers some of the more delicate flavors in the middle of the profile. While drinkable for a high O.G. brew, overall, there are other Belgians that I'd rather enjoy. Still, worth trying."
"My only complaints are that it's not exactly authentic and has a definate US vibe (screw tradition, US brewers should make beers with US style...but they call it a triple so they asked for it!!!). Cheers to River Horse!"
"at first glance this beer has a regular orange/brownish color to it... the smell has a high aroma of yeast... the taste is suprisingly smooth and refreshing... no aftertaste and not much carbonation either... the alcohol is hidden quit well... overall this is a good sipping beer... watch out for the abv. it'll sneek up on ya'"
"D - Very drinkable for having such high alcohol content."
"Drinkability: Reading through these reviews, it appears that this beer has been somewhat inconsistent in the past as my impressions are very different from some other reviewers; in any event, I think this tripel has a lot going for it but would be improved dramatically by reducing the abv a couple of points"
"mouthfeel is full and creamy. almost chewy. very good, about what i expected from the style. drinkability is good but not great, this is a strong beer after all."
"Well, it's no Belgian, but it's a decent American interpretation of a Tripel. It does have a nice clove spiciness, and enough sweet malt to keep it from being a wreck. The abv is dangerously hidden, making it easy to drink. It comes in a six-pack (for about ten bucks). So if you want a not-so-bad tripel in a six-pack, it would be worth it. If you are looking for Belgium-in-America...I don't know that this one quite does it."
"It's medium-bodied and moderatley complex, with a smokey, dry, yeasty finish, after a fruity center. It's drinkable. It doesn't possess the most personalityas far as tripels are concerned, but it's not bad."
"River Horse Tripel Horse is neither a Triple Crown winner, nor is it destined for the glue factory. It's just a simple, inauthentic version from a brewery that I'm beginning to think of as no better than average. Yeah, I know that a river horse is actually a hippopotamus, but you try coming up with a decent play on words that involves a hippo."
"Drinkability was easy enough, except at 10% it's not sessionable. One of my first experiences with this style, a fun learning experience for me."
"It's a big beer that wants to play big, but isn't coordinated enough to be especially credible. It's like Shaq playing with two left feet and shoes that are too big, assuming such shoes exist somewhere. The ABV is the most notable component of the beer, and that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. I gave it a shot, and finished the bottle. My wife is welcome to the rest, but I'm not sure she wants it either."
"D - Not bad at all. I am rather impressed. By no means is this a beer I will seek out, I probably won't have it again, but I wouldn't mind having it again if I stumble upon it. It has pretty drinkable effect, but it is 10% abv (which is well masked by the way. Worth trying at least once."
"Below average for the style, still quaffable. Chocolate brown colour. 10% is a lot, and I was getting it from the aroma through the afterhammer. A bit of sweetness, an OK chewy yeast. Spice, but nothing too complex. Fizzy carbonation. This is an interesting brewery."
"Poured a hazy orange color with massive white puffy head. Smell is strong of bananas, with lots of summer and citrus fruits mixed in. Taste is mainly of bananas, spices, and a bit of pepper. Finish a bit alcoholic (which would be expected) but overly unpleasant. A very nice beer with great drinkability (considering its alcohol content)"
"Into a taster glass, pours copper amber to light gold, good half inch whitish head and decent lacing. Nose is pretty nice, light fruits, slightly spicy yeast, and a candy-like sugar. Tastes of all kinds of fruits, quite smooth, actually a really good mouth, candy sugar sweetness, only slightly aware of the abv, handled very well... Really, I'm pretty impressed by this beer, a great interpretation of a classic style. Too bad I got this as a gift, only had a few, and gave a few away.. would have liked to have this again."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber-orange color with a thin, weak white head which fades quickly to a spotty film. No lacing noted. Aromas are pleasing, just a bit tame. Notes of ripe apple, banana, apricot give this a very fruity nose with additional hints of caramel, ginger, yeast and candy sugar. Carbonation is very minimal giving it a somewhat flat, slick texture; otherwise mouthfeel is full. Taste starts out very sweet and a bit cloying. Flavors of apple, pear, apricot, banana, honey, yeast and some restrained spices comes through nicely. Finish is helped from getting too sweet by the 10% alcohol and a touch of hops. Taking into consideration how many better Tripels are available, one try is enough"
"I have recommended to others and they agree this is a great high alcohol beer."
"Pours medium honey colored, rather cloudy. Decent carbonation, not much head along with some hints of lacing. Smells are light for a Tripel, and I do not detect the alcohol in the nose, which is good. Sweet fruitiness (peaches and citrus, not raisins) and light malts. Taste is not alcohol-y, another plus, but the actual flavors are not so balanced. Rather sickly sweet, makes me a little nauseous actually. Now that I think about it, I had 2 others of these months ago and they tasted totally different. It definitely got BETTER with age, however I think it still needs time to mature and balance out. Overall, OK, if I had rated this months ago I would have been much more disappointed."
"Beer pours a dark orange with a minimal head. The initial nose out of the bottle was of sour apples. Taste is a nice medley of sour apples, candied sugar, with a nice dry hop finish. Alcohol was warming with the first sip only. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nice and full for the style. Drinkability is pretty good. The hign abv is well masked. Not a bad job of brewing. It is a nice representation of the style but just not quite up there with the tripels from Belgium. But it is worth a shot!"
"D - high drinkability, a nice tripel, needs slightly less sour and sweet for me, but damn tasty"
"Dvery good. I would love another, but could have two more. The 10% abv is sneaky in this one."
"Not a tripel for everyone, but for those that like sweeter examples of the style this should fit the bill."
"I enjoyed this one. Is it an Americanized verion of a Tripel? Sure, but it's a pretty good version nonetheless."
"D: One of the few tripels that I've had, but my favorite. A local beer to where I grew up and one that I first had at my uncle's house, which is 10 minutes from the brewery. A good choice for a belgian style."
"Notes: This is my final beer drank and reviewed as a single man."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the thinner side with plenty of fast moving bubbles. Goes down easy enough and the alcohol is pretty well hidden for 10%. An interesting tripel that I was happy to be able to try, luckily it was not overly sweet. I'd imagine I'd have this again given the opportunity."
"Taste is a bit too fruity sugary, just toooo sweet. I'd rather it be a bit more subtle. Mouthfeel isn't very full-bodied at all, and though it's a bit chewy, it's rather thin. Drinkability is relatively high considering alcohol content, but this is too sweet for me."
"The beer is fairly thick up front, but is not nearly as sweet as I was expecting from the fullness or aroma. This is a good thing, but surprisingly this beer seems to be missing a complexity that is found in good examples of the style. This beer has a fruitiness in the taste that is similar to the aromas found in the aroma; I get notes of pear and apple. The spicy notes, while quite a bit more subtle than I would like, are evident; I get spicy notes of black pepper, a hint of ginger, and perhaps some notes of lemon zest. It does hide the alcohol quite well though. In the end this beer is just a bit lacking. This is not a bad beer, but there are so many really good Tripels out there that I would rather have."
"My friend Ray brought this bottle over for a party at the house last year but I just cut into it tonight. What a treat. I poured the beer into s Standard (Tap) pint. What a steal. The beer poured a sweet brown/golden color and clear with a slight white head. The aroma of this beer is of some Belgian candied sugar and some toasted malts but very approachable. The taste is a bit deceptive or should I say very deceptive at 10% but is it sweet and had a pleasnt malty taste that hides the high abv which I like, I like alot. I find this beer to have a medium body that is easy to drink and boy that is nice since RH has another fine beer on their hands. I will probably crack into a Frostbite right now!"
"In an attempt to create a standout Tripel, it becomes a little overkilled. Begins with every fruit and spice imaginable in a beer. Among which are pears, pineapples, oranges, pepper, and corriander. The malt and sugar base becomes over attenuated and the yeast exhibits a stressed plastic and fusal unnecessarily hot flavor and feel. The candy sugars add a powdered sugar taste and powdery texture. If you're interested in a pure alcohol beer and are not fussy about flavor, then this one is probably for you. If not, then there are much better Belgian Tripels out there."
"Cheers!"
"thanks goes to weeare138 for this. from the bottle. poured goldem honey, with a small white head that left a very small amount of lacing. aroma sour, with a big kick of alcohol followed by pine, grassy, than get a whiff of something sweet could it be the vanilla I couldnt tell. flavor, a light lemon, yeast, a slight sourness, and alcohol. enjoyed this one"
"d: This is not in the same class as some of the world class belgian triples, but it is a solid example none the less. Nice job by a small brewery. Recommend anyone that comes across this to give it a try."
"A rather nice triple, sort of an americanized version with the larger hop taste, but beyond that just bigger and surprisingly true to style. Good beer"
"D: Overall still a very drinkable beer but by no means my favorite of the syle."
"I'll definitely buy more bottles; and hope to try it on tap."
"Golden ginger in color River Horse Tripel pours rather uneventfully with a frothy ring around the perimeter of the glass with tidal ripples of froth on the surface and having that understated and somewhat unwilling Ameri-Belge nose of sweet cotton candy. It took me a while to pin down the comparable taste and nose of this beer, but I would liken it to a scented chewing gum called C. Howards. The body of this beer is light with not much dimension, but easy-going and non-threatening. I guess one could totally ax this brew for its infantile and less than Tripel characteristics, but this beer drinks quite well with the alleged 10% ABV well repressed within. This beer lacks the level of carbonation that would provide a better tasting experience; as such a light version of the style is way to still to create true quaffing excitement. Although the brewmaster suggests cellaring some of this stuff for the future, this beer needs to be consumed young; as any extended bottle aging will result in disappointment. This Tripel simply doesnt have the gonads for cellaring. Drink it now...then move on...."
"Poured a soft amber color that was easily penetrated by surrounding light. Only a slight head develops, but some light lacing is left behind. Aromas of Belgian candy, honey, grains, and earthy/leafy material. The taste is sweeter and much drier than might be expected with flavors of honey and fruit coming out. Very, very smooth and dry in the finish. The aftertaste is a bit cloying at first and even a bit astringent, but that quickly changes to a sweet, lingering taste that demands another sip to quench. Tastes very much like a mild sparkling wine. I couldn't believe the ABV was 10%, it could easily have been half that without a difference in taste, that's how well it is masked. I really enjoyed this beer; would think of it as more of a honey wine/beer than anything else."
"Overall, I recommend this beer, though I wouldn't have if you asked me when it was fresher. At 10% ABV it can probably sit for a while, now I wish I bought a few more this past Summer so I could try again after 12 and then 18 months!"
"($10.29 / 6-pack)"
"No go."
"I was fooled by the light color (I am still learning) and really happy with the flavor. The 10% abv doesn't come thru in the very smooth taste. I tried it twice from the same tap. The first was fairly cold and the 2nd at a warmer temperature. Both were good."
"Overall- a bland looking beer that is quite tasty. It says 10% on the bottle and I can't taste a hint of alcohol!! Excellent job hiding it. A very good Tripel. Good thing I live close to Lambertville."
"drinkability: quite drinkable"
"Not a classic tripel, but very enjoyable. Wish I had another one, but alas, this was my only one."
"Fiery orange gold. Absolutely beautiful color. Good clarity, with a short white head. Holds a collar throughout. Sweetened, fruity malt aroma. Candi sugar, mild floral hops, pineapple and caramel apple. Opens with a blast of sugar, enveloping the palate with a slick, greasy sweetness. Heaps of fruit. Baked, caramelized apple, pineapple chunks, melon and honey into the finish. Plenty of phenols to match, manifesting themselves as a plastic overtone. Spicy, floral hops blend nicely with the spicy, peppery yeast. A light wash of alcohol boosts the sweetness some, finishing just shy of cloying. Great carbonation, spritzy, yet just enough to carry through the rather haevy body. Leaves my tongue fairly dry, surprisingly. Overly sweet, perhaps. Balanced, with the spicy finish and phenols. Drinking a bottle takes me some time, mainly because the sugar gets a little overbearing. Still, very nicely done, especially for a brewery that doesn't specilize in belgian styles."
"12 ounce bottle purchased at Vintage Cellar Radford."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/8"" off-white head above the clear light amber brew. Head quickly fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, with reasonable lacing, both of which seem to be more or less to style. Aroma is malt sweetness and alcohol, with some spicing reminiscent of Belgians. Taste resembles the nose, spicy sweetness covering fruity alcohol. Mouthfeel is a bit thick, could use some more carbonation to smooth it out, and drinkability gets cloying with the sugar bent of this one. Not a bad brew, but I was hoping for more."
"Clear golden orange with light white head that shrinks into the body quickly with no signs of lace. Very sweet aroma, some fruity scents including apple. Very little spice and fairly big alcohol notes. The taste is very similar with big sweetness making up most of the flavor. Some light fruit and spice is lurking about. The alcohol stands out a bit too much. Sweet and with an alcohol bite is how this finished. Pretty solid mouthfeel, what you would expect. Fairly warming as well due to the big alcohol. Not bad just not interesting to me. It really didnt have enough of everything but the sweetness and alcohol."
"Notes: this one must not be served too cold."
"This brew is a tawny, amber color. Its quite clear, and has a wispy, white head. Seems a little under-carbonated for the style. The aroma is something: alcohol and spice, strong vanilla, peppermint and sugar, bananas, grain, roasted malt. Theres a lot going on in that smell. The taste is full and sweetits peppery-spicy, and has a slight alcohol warming sensation. Its certainly mouth-filling, and very relaxing. The flavor and mouthfeel are great, but not quite up to the fantastic aroma. Some of those initial complexities get left behind. Finish has a restrained bitterness, and a lot of peppery spice. Solid and enjoyable brew."
"Finally, the high alcohol content means lowered drinkabliity. I liked it, but man, was it powerful."
"Sampled a 12 ouncer, no freshness indication provided on the label. Pours an orangy shade of copper/amber. Suprisingly clear, minimal yeast /sediment in this one. Head is light and white and it leaves wispy and stringy lacing. Nose I picked up is some light coriander like spicing and some Belgian yeast esters. This is a fruity, dry, enjoyable brew. More like a hearty Belgian pale ale to me then a tripel, but who really cares what they call it. This is a pleasant and worthy U.S, take on the style. Strong and flavorful, well worth a try. Best stuff I've had from RH."
"Unique."
"Honey amber color from top to bottom, because if you are looking for head, look somewhere else. This beer has a definite fruit smell. I am going to say maybe apple, peach and vanilla. The taste says the same....fruity and sweet. Tastes like a good Belgian attempt. If you are looking for a solid Tripel without too sweet a taste, look no further."
"Hmmmm... This is a nice surprise. Pours a rich amber in color. Perfectly clear. No head though, no matter how hard I tired. Aroma is a bit fruity, peaches... Getting hints of yeast also. Flavor is really impressive. Malts come through at first very quickly followed by some very sweet Belgian sugars. Yeast flavors also, I had to look into the bottle to see if it was bottle conditioned. Also, picking up some apples coming through in the yeast. Very smooth drinking with this great interpretation of the style. The only down side is the alcohol, it comes through a bit too much (but at 10%, that is not a surprise). Gotta love those phenols."
"One of the better American stabs at the Belgian Tripel style. Very pleasantly drinkable. Wish I had bought more."
"As a good tripel, it goes down pretty easy, though make sure it's not too cold. I went with 45 degrees the first beer I had and it was way too cold. I'm up to 50 today and it's fabulous. You'll lose out if it's too cold. I'm going to hold onto the last few I have and save them for a rainy day."
"Pours a somewhat golden color-a bit darker then most tripels. No real head. Low aroma-somewhat yeasty and sweet. Malty flavor upfront. A very slight phenolic flavor . Some hop bitterness. Still sweeter then what I think a tripel should be. Has some good body to it. Overall a nice beer. Very much a US version of a triple-much more then Victory's Golden Monkey which is far more complex. I do have to say this is the first beer from River Horse that I can honestly say was worth trying"
"Get one, or six or a case."
"NOt a bad interpretation I would buy it again!"
"For being 10% avb, this is extremely drinkable. Pretty nice brew by the mighty hippo of NJ."
"Poured out a deep yellow/golden color with an ever so slight layer of carbonation on top. Smell was somewhat decent. Starts out with a few tropical fruits mixed with some spices. Sugar and vanilla also stand out in the aroma department. Taste wasn't bad I thought. The fruity/citrus flavors really show their strength and make it stand out, along with some spiciness, which is weaker than I thought it was going to be considering it was strong in the nose. The aftertaste was all vanilla which seemed to last forever. Moutthfeel was full bodied with a lack of carbonation. It was quite drinkable though. Not really a true tripel, but it seemed they wanted to have fun with this one and kinda worked. Worth a try for sure."

"Belgian character a little subdued, a bit clean for my tastes and carbonation on the low side for style."
"Slight, just off-white head settles over clear dark amber/bronze liquid. Candy sweet malty nose with light spiciness. Taste is fruity, a bit too sweet with brief hop bitterness, some hard to pin down spices and a strange bitterness. Can't say I really taste any alcohol here (10%abv). Finishes too sweet/cloying to really enjoy more than one bottle but it's nice to see this brewery attempting a bolder style of beer."
"Hazy apple juice in color. Head is non-existent. Ring is barely there. Smells of musty clove and sweet fruit: big-time pineapple juice. Taste is interesting. It's got that apple profile but not like fresh, crisp apples; it's more like something a little more ripe. Tastes dry, then sweet, then dry, then sweet. It's kind of strange in that sense. Finishes bittersweet and dries the mouth slowly and completely. First sip warms the tongue and insides almost immediately. The ABV is noticeable at 10%. Feels thick and full with a little spritz in there. Slick on the tongue. An interesting tripel but a little too alcoholic and lacking in complexity for the genre."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very balanced aroma that boasts of pale and light crystal malts along with a dominating Belgian yeast finish. It is fruity and quite refreshing. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity and slightly tart. It is one of the most drinkable tripels I've ever had. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent sessions brew. It has a refreshing aroma and a smooth, balanced flavor; a good drinker."
"Mouthfeel is syrupy and smooth. Heavy in body. The malty thickness rides the tongue long after swallowing. Drinakbility is a bit down from a good level since this is a really enjoyable single beer session, but several may wear on you with the high and well hidden alcohol level. Worth seeking out."
"Thanks to Jcalbi for the sample"
"A dangerously drinkable beer at 10%. I would like to put a few of these away for cellaring. A good offering from River Horse!"
"Highly recommended version of the style, and remains near the top of my list of favorite beers. Too bad it's only available at this restaurant, on-tap only."
