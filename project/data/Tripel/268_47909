So-so nose...some yeasty fruit notes.  Taste was straightforward, not a super-complex triple, but very tasty and could have had one or two more if I wasn't walking with my kids.  A good tripel, but certainly not world class.","captaincoffee","Mar 31, 2015"

The hops hit first when sipped, followed by a slight fruitiness, but overall grainy, dry, yeasty taste.  Bitterness lingers in aftertaste.  Not bad, but not as smooth or well balanced as it could be.","thebeers","Jan 25, 2015"

Less nose than others. A disclaimer: my nose may be tainted by a preference for severely hopped beers locally. Color, head, mouthfeel all fine and as expected for style.","MisterGone","Jul 23, 2014"

4.2,6.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 12/4/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big peach, pear, orange, apricot, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big peach, pear, orange, apricot, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, pear, orange, apricot, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of fruity/spicy yeast flavors, earthy hops, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome tripel style. Great complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors with moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 28, 2014"

3.73,-5.8,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"a very sturdy take on the belgian tripel from a brewery who has yet to really miss for me. this is a very clear and amber tinted colored version, in some ways lighter (clarity) and in some ways more grainy (darker) than others. nice off white head holds in my glass and leaves spider web lacing as i drink on it. its got a weird nose for the style though, a bit of burnt sugar, but also a funny staleness. not the typical green bottle skunk, but something else, an almost german dusty grain element thats unfamilar in belgian beer to me, and isnt all the way appealing, but not enough to turn me off. the flavor of the beer is great though, long sweet but smooth grainy front end. some oats in here lend body, while the majority wheat malt does more of the flavoring. the yeast is subtle in this too, not as ""belgian"" as other belgians, less fruity esters, maybe fermented at a lower temperature, but the strain appears active enough to eat through most of the sugar here, and the finish is dryer than many tripels on the market. carbonation is there, but its not quite effervescent, and the added body from the slightly heavier grains make it drink a little heavier than it really needs to. although, the alcohol is extremely well hidden, and not a factor in lesser drinkability at all. i think i like their quad better, and i definitely like their wild version of this better, but its a nice take on the style.","StonedTrippin","Jun 27, 2014"

First impressions on my tongue are that this beer has both a grainy, cracker/bready malt base and a sharp carbonation and touch of pepper to it which leads to a somewhat chewey, medium-bodied beer that finishes with a snap. Touches of sugary sweetness give minor counterpoint, not exactly balance, tropical (pineapple or pear, something along those lines) and citric (orange) fruit notes. Good balance, nice flavors, not my favorite but it's not watery or rip or anything negative.","clayrock81","Jul 06, 2013"

3.48,-12.1,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Straffe Hendrik's Tripel pours a totally clear dark orange. It's a little dark for the style, and it has a bone colored head that maxes out at about four fingers in height. Head retention is pretty good, but aside from a near solid ring at the top of the glass, lacing is very spotty. The nose is disappointingly weak, but there are some classic tripel elements presence. A sweet pale fruit aroma (primarily apricots) by far dominates, and it's supported by a surprisingly potent earthy herbal hop smell. Spice/clove phenols are barely there. The flavor starts out just like the nose, big apricot/fruit and a little bit of candy sweetness. The mid palate bitterness is a little bit sharper than I would have anticipated, but still keeps itself in check. Noble hop influence is a little bit less intense here, leaving a little more room for the phenols to shine through. The mouthfeel is up there with the best of them. The body is light, yet creamy, and the carbonation is effervescent and lively. Straffe Hendrik's tripel is a decent beer, but I'm pretty confident I could find a tripel I prefer to this one on the shelves of most decent bottle shops.","axeman9182","Oct 01, 2011"

Predominantly sweet aromas with strong notes of bubblegum, honey, and baked pastries, not unlike baklava. All of these notes carry over to the flavor, where they are intensified. Lingers long and sweet. A nice dessert.","droomyster","Dec 21, 2010"
4.42,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I'd like to like more tripels, but there are so few that don't look like crap and taste like old lemonade. This is not one of those, but it might not satisfy the principled tripel purist.","gfreed","Dec 05, 2010"
2.78,-29.8,4,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Way to sweet of a beer, it really gets quite cloying and isn't something I want to finish a glass of. The aroma on this beer wasn't actually half bad and had me hoping that this was going to be a decent beer.","Gueuzedude","Oct 17, 2010"
3.73,-5.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Not a tripel that goes for the jugular, but also nice to know you won't be getting an instant headache either (I love a good tripel, but they're beastly things sometimes). An easy, pleasurable, uncomplicated beer that drinks like any number of other quality Belgians. Just not a tripel for newbies, as it will definitely give the wrong impression.","Metalmonk","Oct 13, 2010"

3.82,-3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"More alcohol than the smell indicates--this warms the throat in the swallow. Light hop, lots of light Belgian yeast.

4.13,4.3,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours an almost clear golden/amber color with a big white head that goes down rather quickly. In the nose I get some fruitiness (mostly pears and melons). I also get a bit of banana and spice. The taste has a lot of pear and spice flavor to it, with a banana taste following. The alcohol is AMAZINGLY well-hidden in this beer. I cant even taste it at all. There's a lot of cantaloupe and honeydew flavor to this triple. The mouthfeel is very nice. It was exactly what I was expecting from a triple. The drinkability is a lot higher than I was expecting (although I find most triples to be very drinkable), due to its ABV. Solid beer.","DovaliHops","Jul 24, 2010"

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Very smooth light flavor and mouthfeel. Sour and bitter yeasty finish with a good Belgian character. The yeast flavor is the most dominant thing in this beer, and I am glad.

It adds a grainy taste and maybe an extra maltbitter kick, which combines well with the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness comes through and shows a clean bitterness, which combined with the rather clean yeast profile, steals the show. However the bitterness is starting to become a little sharp, with a lack of real malt sweetness. And where is the alcohol? You could have fouled me by saying this beer is only 6%.","Absumaster","Apr 19, 2009"
