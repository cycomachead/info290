Taste is much the same, with some sweetness, bread, spice, coriander, and a floral tonge.  Mouthfeel is medium and not overly carbonated.

Popping the top I get a breads waft of spiced malt.  Pours to a bright light orange with a one finger multi-bubble head.  On the taste this brew has a breads, candy and spice, everything nice.  Flavor is consistent throughout with a trace of bitterness in the finish and aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth.  A great food beer and sipper.","mooseisloose","Mar 29, 2015"

4.26,11.8,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"One of my favorites from New Belgium, Trippel is a tripel style Belgian ale that is crisp, light in appearance, and delicious. Brewed with Coriander, this beer is strong and herbal, bringing in palate-refreshing tones of hops balanced with malt and earth. Not too bitter, the content of Trippel's ABV is hidden by slight tones of wheat, spices, and the traditional European ale flavor. Over time, if the beer sits, it is possible to taste a little alcoholic bitterness, but with a true drinking of Trippel, it will pay you back entirely. This beer does not deserve to be out of the bottle for more than a half-hour, and it demands a quick consumption in order to attain its brilliance. This is not one for the new drinker, this beer resides in the halls of the greats because of its personality and vigor. Sharp in taste, and all of the ingredients being present, this beer demands an audience of great import and knowledge, and is likely to be brushed under by novices in terms of flavor, color, and presentation. When you find Trippel, pick up a pack and enjoy your night, cause you'll never want to pass it up again.","Jasonm2","Mar 04, 2015"

Smells of wheat, pine, citrus, bananas, with some slight hints of pineapple and grapefruit. Unfortunately the taste is where this beer went south for me. It literally tastes like liquefied banana nut bread. There was some citrus and hoppiness in there, but the banana taste is just too overpowering for me, and ruins the rest of the flavors that are present.","do_ob","Feb 27, 2015"

4,5,,,,,,"Pours a clear yellow with a two finger head that left beautiful lacing on the glass. The aroma was light and I couldn't quite place it but coriander as the label suggested was there along with perhaps a bit of banana of all things. The taste was pleasantly different with banana and coriander prevalence along with hops and a sweet aftertaste. Definitely a fridge item when one craves something light, refreshing and different. Careful though, the taste belies the 7.80ABV rating.","fishmanpa","Nov 01, 2014"

A translucent, golden body sat underneath a small, 1/2 finger white head. Great lacing in my 12 oz glass, and zero floaties in the body. Not an anytime beer, but well worth the experience.","Jonoesh5","Oct 28, 2014"

Maybe I'm not as big a coriander fan, I don't know, but while I didn't dislike this by any means, I liked Abbey a lot more.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess, though I'll say it's very nice to have this in a six-pack and available all year long, whereas most similar beers are only packaged in bombers and harder to find.  This accessibility is definitely a plus for New Belgium.","dcscientist","Sep 25, 2014"

It didn't occur to me to use an aerator during the pour, but that may have helped. Stay with this one, it opens up. The malty sweetness prevails in the end. Even close to room temperature, this beer is a drinker. A gentle, complex, balanced beer. Beer was poured in to a Belgian-style beer glass.","monkbrewed","Jun 19, 2014"

The smell is just wonderful, like sweet cloves. The taste is much like the smell, it starts out sweet with a touch of banana then finishes with a mild spiciness. It is nice to find a beer with a mild sweetness, but not too heavy of a body. I would call this a medium bodied brew. I really enjoyed this one and will definitely be buying some more.","Billet","May 17, 2014"

4.15,8.9,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4,"Overall: This beer is nuanced, complex and subtle. Very balanced and pleasant and provides treats for all the senses. Although it says that it is brewed with coriander, the spice is hop-like and mingles well with other characteristics. Very versatile, will wash the dust down on hot day or go down nicely après ski. I would say best paired with fatty fish, like salmon. A pleasant surprise.","MrBoz21","Oct 20, 2013"

It has some nice lacing and plenty of carbonation. The aroma has a mixture of fruits, clove, coriander, peppers and a slight peanut smell too. Light and crispy, this is a medium bodied ale, the spices are nice and not overpowering, the coriander come out in the aftertaste. The malts are strong at first, but as it travels toward the back of your throat, it sweetens up just a little, it is dry overall.

Aroma is spicy coriander, intense fruit esters from the yeast, and sweet caramel.

You can smell the yeast on this thing from like a foot away, and the closer you get, the more floral it gets. Flavor is really nice: sweet, a little spice, and you get the floral and yeast from the nose. Well-hidden alcohol. Mouthfeel is nice too, with good carbonation, slick, and a light shock to the palette from the alcohol in the background. I won't lie to you, this isn't the first time I've had this beer. It's one of my go-to's for a tripel, and probably an easy favorite for me from New Belgium.","BeerWizard","Mar 23, 2013"

While not the high alcohol content of your normal Tripels, it is a great beer that can be sipped and savored. A great value for the price. This may not be my top choice in this category of beer it is darn close as it is not as filling if you plan on drinking a few. I did not grasp anything overpowering in a particular flavor or taste. Just a very smooth drinking beer with a little more bang than you think when you see 7.8%. This is my first six pack and I am sure I will be stocking up real soon. I can give a more detailed review then as I am battling a bad cold. I recommend this one highly.","Wrigfen","Feb 28, 2013"

It has a strong taste of coriander and an alcoholic burn in your stomach from the high alcohol content. I was very highly dissapointed in this beer, so much so I made an account because of all the high ratings it has gotten! It has a floral taste like you are drinking flowers with coriander spice in it, all in all I would never recommend this to anyone! I don't pour it into glasses as I feel it destroys some of the carbonation, so I drank it straight from the bottle- regardless I had to go get another six pack after the first bottle. I do not recommend this to anyone, nor can I imagine why it is even produced and sold at local shops. But if you like your stomach burning and drinking flowers, go for it!","Satanic","Feb 08, 2013"

Amazing smell, earthy, gardenlike, like I just watered my lawn in the July morning. Looks like a typical straw colored lager, but with a bit more pool of foam atop the glass with legs of lace. Taste is slow to hit, until it hits the middle of tongue and I'm hit with banana and a rinse of rye bread. The taste lingers forever, and then transforms' to light bitter apple. I do not notice the peppery flavor others notice at all, but I don't mind. Sipped like a fine bourbon is the best way to experience it. Not a session beer, it is so sneaky.

The biscuity character of Fat Tire is definitely present as well, and seems to come in a slightly different incarnation with each sip. The dominating fruit of the aroma is only faintly present in the taste, which, while not necessarily bad, is a surprise. Also, the 7.8% ABV is virtually impossible to detect, as this is very light drinking. Carbonation is medium to high and only serves to up the "refreshing" level that's already quite high. The finish is a mix of a faint banana/peach hybrid and a buttery yeast note that clings to the palate for a bit. Overall, pretty nice, though still just "good"","Tomhet","Jan 04, 2013"

Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity and both Midas and Croesus could be seen licking their lips. Nose was at once sweet, spicy and musty if you have the capacity to reconcile such a concept. There was a honey-like malty sweetness along with some sort of spice, all overlain by the mustiness of the yeast. Whew! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a riot of flavors on the tongue. It started out with a flowery perfuminess, giving way to a slight spice, followed by a yeasty dryness that was not really expected. Finish was quite dry, not to the point of gasping for air, but close. The price-tag ($4.49) is insane for how good this is! Phew!

This beer had great drinkability, it went down very smooth, with enough flavor to hold my attention, one bomber is just enough for me, this may be the most drinkable Tripel I have had to date. What I liked most about this beer was the drinkability and the appearance, the mouthfeel was also noteworthy. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of balance in the flavor and aroma, I wish the malts stuck out a little more to balance out all that Belgian yeast. I would for sure buy this again when looking for a decent Tripel that won't break the bank, there's not many affordable Tripel's but this is one of them, I can see myself keeping a bottle or two in the fridge, I recommend this to anyone who likes the style. All in all this was a nice Tripel, but it doesn't come close to being one of my favorites, but for what it is and how much it costs, it's a bargain and a good no thrills Tripel.

3.8,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Mind you, this is not my style. I'm not a Belgian fan. But I had the bartender (the owner's father in law) at Orcutt Brew pour me a small taste first. It was inoffensive, so I had him pour me a pint. It's a crystal clear, light-golden color with a nearly white head. The head attenuates quickly, but sticky lace hangs on the edge off the glass. A lot of banana in the nose with that common Belgian yeast aroma that pierces the olfactory. The beer's mouthfeel is wet and is characterized by a medium body. A pilsnerish start that quickly yields to ripe banana and then tart white grape. There is a bit of that familiar Belgian yeast finish. The thing I find clever about this beer is that everything is mild. Which has caused this non-Belgian drinker to sit and enjoy a pint. Good job New Belgium.","DocJitsu","Jul 14, 2012"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"New Belgium Trippel pours a fairly clear lemon yellow, with a bit more than to fingers of fluffy white foam capping the beer. Head retention and lacing are both solid. The nose has a good bit of pear to it, before light pepper and clove waft through. The coriander adds a nice subtle citrus note to the aroma. The flavor has some pale/stone fruit sweetness leading off, before the phenols come in on the back end. The pepper and clove aren't too intense, with the coriander doing a nice job of helping temper them. I wish the esters were just a little bit more prominent though. The carbonation is nice and active, but the body is just a touch too chewy for me. New Belgium's Trippel is a good take on the style. I was wary of it being spiced, but the brewers displayed a deft hand with the coriander.","axeman9182","Jul 13, 2012"

For me this was one of those beers that really expanded my mind and showed me how creative and flavorful beer could be. It pours very light amber and crystal clear. Immediately you smell those nice esters from the Belgian yeast. Slightly tart and slightly fruity its a big spicy malt body with a very subtle coriander presence. The hops come in at the end and sort of muddle with everything. At 7.8% the alcohol is incredibly well hidden.","Theheroguy","Jul 12, 2012"

The aroma is light with a sweet malt character, a hint of earthy hops, and a light clover banana, not as detectable as I would have liked. The flavor starts with an earthy hop character upfront together with a mild bitterness, the higher abv and heat is prevelant pretty quickly but isn't much of a distraction as it mellows in the middle as the sweet malt balances everything out. Finishes with a gentle sweetness and mild bitterness on the tongue. Some carbonation and lighter bodied considering the big nature of the beer. Overall, not a bad beer but not exceptional.

NB's unconventional Belgian yeast strain yields two distinct notes- sulfur and banana, neither of which are mainstays in this style. Totally wild experience, amplified by the juxtaposition of those bold flavors in an otherwise simple, balanced brew. The remainder of the beer is a bit of a letdown, but that's ok. This is one I don't mind sipping, swirling, and then going for the payoff is a big deep whiff.","ZSimon","Feb 17, 2012"

Aromas of big banana, clove, pear, pepper, lemon, coriander, bread, bubblegum, grass, light tart grain, and yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of lemon, pepper, pear, coriander, biscuit, banana, herbal, clove, lightly tart grain, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of lemon, pepper, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice overall balance of flavors with no cloying sweetness as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Very drinkable and smooth for the level of alcohol, but it is a bit of a sipper.

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"New Belgium Trippel: Despite the popularity of Fat Tire, it is the Belgian style beers that New Belgium brews that are the hallmark of the brewery. The New Belgium Trippel has a clear golden body and ample frothy head. The aroma is mild, but hits all the notes expected of a good Tripel. The flavor is similar. You get the classic Belgian flavors: chewy bread and yeast covered with the gumball sweetness, but they are subtle. The warming alcohol is present throughout, especially at the finish. The New Belgium Trippel is a great sipping experience, but beware, a few will have me feeling it the next day.","iSip","Dec 19, 2011"

I'm not sure if that is a function of my tastes become more sophisticated or NB dropping some of their standards. I seem to remember loving all of their beers when I first tried them several years ago. At the time, they were mostly a Colorado brewery, now they have expanded, and I'm not sure they've kept all of their standards. In any case, this beer is decent, not a bad choice, but I wouldn't seek it out. Certainly, there was quite a bit of spice - otherwise I found the taste and the aroma to be strong, but not particularly unique or elite. It claims to be brewed with coriander. That's cool I guess, but it doesn't stop this from being a slightly better than average beer. For the price and the sexy art...I wanted a little better.","andrewm190","Sep 24, 2011"

A spicy, citrusy, yeasty smell hits me as I swear there's more than a hint of corriander in here. I'm picking up some spicy pepper, a touch of alcohol/medicinal and a lemon/orange/sharp citric twang. This beer goes down real easy as it is smooth and surprisingly sweet. It's a like a sugary honey sweetness as well as some sweet gruits and this beer has a balance w/ some sharp citric notes and touches of bitter fruit - not tomention the dry/sharp finish thanks to the alchohol bite.

The taste is pretty good, the obvious taste is of coriander and its pretty heavy, behind that there is a little peppery taste, some citrus fruit, slight hints of vitterness and not as dry as some of my favorites, there is a little alcohol burn also.

3.16,-17.1,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Overall, an underwhelming example of the style. With so many other great Tripels out there, why bother? Nice try, New Belgium, but I'd like to see this one taken back to the drawing board.","afdempse","Sep 08, 2011"
4.42,16,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The taste is wonderfully rounded and balanced. Banana is there, but a spicy kick beats it out and really drives the Belgian flavor home. Coriander has the same rounding effect in the taste as it does the nose, not overly implemented here to the benefit of this beer. It adds to the splendid balance this trippel has. Spicy clove has a say in here too, giving it a note remeniscent of a slight biscuit quality. Booze is warming, not hot but also not a huge part of the taste profile. It does come out a little more as the beer warms up, but so do all the complexities so the taste remains balanced. Mouthfeel is right on for the style, with a nice long finish. Just a really well done trippel, I'm glad I picked this up.","chodinheaven","Sep 07, 2011"

Smell is of spice and sweeter malts, citrus like orange, some very light summer grass, yeasty and biscuity. A pleasant aroma overall. It has some tang to it, a a nice alcohol air, the taste comes across with yellow fruits accented by an earthy sort of spice. It is clean and filling, full bodied and refreshing.

After a couple minutes, the head settles to a lacy thin foam topping the beer. It smells of yeast and spice. The taste is a mix of flavors that seem right together and some not so. First, there is a malty taste that is somewhat funky like a mild malt vinegar. Then, there is a fruity (mild pear or peach?), herbal taste with the coriander hints. The mouthfeel is crisp and medium with some mild carbonation. It different than most tripels, but I enjoyed it.","KMcG","Aug 27, 2011"

Grain, spice and hops balance the malt sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable midway and carries through into the finish. This seems actually pretty clean for a trippel and goes down fairly well.

The flavor is quite delicious, a nice balancing act of slightly sweet malt and spicy, peppery character from the yeast.

There are also fragrances of melon, lime peel, and flowers. I wish the taste was a good as the smell, but it was a muted version, with flavors of peaches, slightly sour oranges...maybe tangelos, something in there is like Swiss cheese, and a whips of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a potent explosion of carbonation. There is a slight coating of sweet, sticky phlegm in the back of my throat, but it is sort of pleasing.

Some light notes of grass, peaches, and maybe some light grain all coming together quite nicely to provide a well balanced attack on the senses. The flavor was just as solid here. Rich notes of biting citrus just came ripping through your tongue, shredding the taste buds initially before relaxing into a mellow, but still highly floral Belgian ale. Some light notes from the alcohol and the yeast started to peak through as it warmed, hinting at some depth. Letting it come close to room temp is where you really start to find that depth. Some light grain like malts, hints of peaches and bananas and just an all out really nice profile. One of the brightest tasting Belgian ales I have had in a very long time.

4.07,6.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Glad they put this in 6-packs! Pours a crystal clear gold color...almost completely clear with no color. Medium white head that diminishes fairly quickly. Scent is very sweet with strong coriander and bubble gum. I'm not sure if I've used bubble-gum as an aroma descriptor before, but this FOR SURE has it. STRONG BUBBLEGUM. Hint of banana and Belgian yeast. Taste is very complex with that bubblegum flavor and clove. I love how this beer tastes. You get a completely balanced variety of pepper, coriander, clove, bubblegum, Belgian yeast, banana, and light hoppiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, but doesn't necessarily have that feel I like in a genuine Belgian tripel. Drinkability is high, and ABV is scarily well-hidden. Overall, a great beer and starter for people getting into Belgian triples, just not a close enough example of a genuine one.","DovaliHops","Feb 12, 2011"

The taste is almost one-dimensional in the presence of what I would call a classic sour-bready belgian yeast flavor. Just hints of more complexity on the back end with sugars, floral hops, and milder yet notes of citrus. I mark this down for a sticky aftertaste of spent yeast flavor.","tmcelvain","Feb 11, 2011"

I will definitely be trying this again. For it is a brew that you have to experience for yourself I highly reccomend you go out and get some. Similar to the Belgian White, its not for everyone.

It looks incredibly light for a Tripel. It's very clear and doesn't offer any cloudiness. The smell is pretty bland too. It smells like a weak dortmunder and nothing like a Tripel. Where's the coriander? the yeast? At least the flavor is a little better. Here you get some coriander, a full creamy yeasty flavor with a mild sweetness followed by breadyness. It's solid but nothing too special. It drinks thicker than it looks, but it looks extremely thin. It's light to medium bodied in consistency. It's ok, and just ok in all fields.

It has some of that same roasted malt character that Fat Tire has only a lot less. Not as clean and crisp as you might like but still very good.

The appearance is light and golden with a thin head, and not nearly as captivating as true trippel's. The aroma is pungent and akin to what I'd expect from a Miller Lite if it were home brewed (which means better than the macro-style), with a little bit of that classic "Heineken" skunky smell, probably the coriander. The beer has a mild velvetly sweetness to it, with distinguished abrasrasive and non-complex pilsner malt and coriander flavors. They obviously didn't use an abbey yeast for this. I'm actually quite disgusted with this beer, and I love most beers (with the exception of brown ales which i do not prefer, but that's just my preference.) I feel quite conflicted posting such a poor review as others seem to enjoy this brew, so take it with a grain of salt.... but if you are used to anything even remotely similar to the Chimay Trippel, you will be dissapointed.","DocSkalski","Dec 18, 2010"

Looking at the recipe you do get hints of baking bread with the victory malt and an extra sweetness with the munich malt. It is very interesting that they use liberty hops.

This is as close to true Belgian tripel that I've across this side of the pond. Lots of pale malt, light fruits, light funk, sugar and Belgian yeast all make their presence known in the nose. Taste is full of candied fruits, a nice hoppy bitterness, yeastiness, a little funk that was around in the nose, and some boozy warmth. It's not overly complex, but it's very tasty. Mouthfeeel is on the low end of medium and there is hardly any carbonation, which seems to be the only thing it's missing. Belgian style tripels should be effervescent, and this sadly is not. Nevertheless, it tastes great and is very drinkable for the high ABV. Nice work.","KeefD","Mar 07, 2009"

Carbonation quite high, higher than for the genre, lending a lighter-bodied mouth-feel. What's so disappointing? For one, smell: none except a hint of vegetal, not fresh cut grass or flower stems but perhaps, several day old cut Carnation stems. Flavor totally lacks any yeastiness and doughiness, the principal reason why I love trippels. Instead, there's some sort of vegetal, metallic (or is it alkaline--the word itself suggests what I'm reaching for) base underpinning this strangely bitter lageri-sh tasting ale: the greeny parts of asparagus or artichokes followed by what amounts to (in my recall--those days are over) sour mash. That this is a great brewery with its politics naturally and concomitantly bound up with its fabulous products and facilities makes it really hard to censure any product. This is the second failure I've tasted in Lincoln. Perhaps Lincoln stores do not know how to store product or perhaps the runts of the litter end up here, given that most tastebuds here lean to the Bud and Miller and even more, Keystone interpretations of beer. I can't quite reason through this glaring failure of beermaking.","marcellaproust","Mar 06, 2009"

Finishes with a wisp of alcohol. Also has a lingering sweetness. I prefer my tripels on the dry side. Has a creamy mouthfeel and medium bodied.

It reminds me of Duvel in the fact that there is a strong fruit taste that helps ease the strength of the alcohol flavor. Very pleasant to drink, not bitter at all and it is that combination that could prove dangerous. I am glad that I was able to try it and would certainly get this again when available.

Palate is mildly sweet up front, with pale malt, yeasty Belgian funk, and a touch of peppery spiciness. Finish is a bit dry and spicy. The body is not quite as full or sticky as I look for in a tripel, but still manages to convey the flavor pretty well. Carbonation is a bit lacking, in that it doesn't impart the right amount of creaminess.

The taste is pepper, light hops, peanut butter (of course) and a really nice finish that is crisp and just dry enough to balance the sweet malt. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but a bit thin. The drinkability is great, with the alcohol just peeking 'round the edges. The edges of the peanut butter. In general, not bad but maybe I'm just too spoiled by the originals.

On first taste, the peppery spice you expect from the aroma is there, but not as prominant as in other examples of the style. Very crisp and dry. The body of this beer is a little lighter than I expected, but still well within the style guidelines for a tripel. No apparent alcohol warmth in this one, and the carbonation is high.

Smooth and even. Highly drinkable. I wouldn't normally consider a tripel to be a session-worthy brew, but this one is worth having more than one of. Not the type to have one bottle of and dwell on.

The aromas are very fruity (pears, peaches, appricots, oranges, apples) and moderately spicy (corriander, pepper, esters). Flavors bring about much more sweetness and less spicy character than exhibited in most trippels, but with a lighter than normal body, makes the beer quite easy to drink.

You can pick up a six pack for $6.99 just about any liquor store. Good, drinkable beer for very little money. Not bad. Oh, it also definitely beats the crap out of Fat Tire.

Taste is pretty darn good, a lot of sweet malt and loads of spices, and that Belgian style hop attack that is the antithesis of the IPA, oodles of goodness. My oh my, a good mouth too, creamy but just a little lively over the tongue. Overall, this is a beer that, if I were in a different mood, I would probably be raving and blathering about.

The taste is somewhat one-dimensional and disappointing. The mouthfeel is on the light side for a tripel. On the bright side, it's relatively easy to drink.

(which I normally don't notice, so it must have been a bit more than a hint) Finally after taking a sip I realised I was wrong to judge this beer by its color. It did in deed have a nice crisp taste and a slight taste of alcohol. NOt too much rally, but when you go back and look at the alcohol content and compare it to its smoothness and easy drinkability you realise you have a beer that can easily kick you off your feet. overall I was impressed with this beer, dont let its smoothness fool you though, its a strong bugger.

Maybe some pepper? Feels slick and smooth in the mouth, without being too heavy. Have to pay some attention to this one in case the EtOH catches up with you.

Golden amber haze with frothy off-white head. Sniffing reveals pears, apples, pineapples, yeastiness, and the faintest hints of cilantro and white pepper. The taste is assertively fruity -- sugary sour apples, almost like Green Apple Jolly Ranchers. There is also a strong Saaz hop kick with cilantro notes and a yeasty bread flavor. Slight mineral finish. Sparkling and juicy mouthfeel. Quite drinkable. Another strong offering from New Belgium that I wish I could find out here in the East.","orfeu","Jan 05, 2006"

Hop spiciness is there to complement. Definitely some yeasty medicinal aspects to the taste as well, but like in the smell, these don't overpower the other flavors and are actually welcome here. Alcohol is not noted in the taste. Mouthfeel is thicker than the average tripel. Very creamy as well, instead of the spritzy feel I have come to expect from this style.

The nose is fruity, spicy (coriander?), and yeasty with a bit of hay-like/wheat-ish malt and some mild, spicy hops. It's quick in the mouth with a medium body and delicately effervescent carbonation that lets it pass readily. The flavor, however, is more imposing and tends to linger in the finish. It's spicy and hoppy (also spicy, and floral), and along with a solid bitterness, that helps to balance it's sweetish, delicately candyish, lightly citrus-rind like, and grassy/straw-like maltiness. Surprisingly, the alcohol is well-hidden here, as it's seems to stand out a bit in their Abbey (dubbel). Nicely done, and a perfect after dinner beer - or pair it with some Thai food, stinky cheese, or salad with oil and sesame seeds.","NeroFiddled","May 15, 2005"

ABV% is very well hidden, the bottle I have says 7.8%ABV, which differs from previous offerrings. The Belgian yeast and Saaz hops come through in the aftertaste and are a nice match.

Lacing is incredible, will foam down the glass after every drink. The smell is very fruity, melons wet the nose and a nice raspberry hop kick brings up the end. The taste has a nice blend of yeast and sweet malt upfront. Slight caramel taste. The hop bitterness is perfect, you get the pucker then the nice blend of peach taste. Honey is also detected.

Once settled into a Duvel tulip, the beer was a rich and hazy orange-golden, and was topped by a substantial fine white head that left excellent lacing. The nose was aggressively loaded with coriander, with numerous accents such as cut grass, bitter citrus peel, honey, bready yeast, and flowery perfume....very nice. The taste matched the nose closely. A fluffy, honey-melon malt backbone opened up with powerful notes of wild flowers and freshly trampled grass. These flavors became tainted with doughy coriander and bitter orange peel in the nicely bittered, satisfying finish. A nice medicinal bitterness lingers. I really enjoyed the subdued sweetness level thoughout..very nice, were other trippels can be too sweet for my palate. The body was appropriately fluffy and rich for the flavors.

Tasting this was excellent. Nice fruity flavor up front with the peppery yeast. Fading away to a nice bready body and finishing slightly sour. The hops are noticable throughout. Quite nice. The malt showed a little more power as it warmed, but it stayed pretty balanced. Not overly sweet, but not too bitter either. Mouthfeel was nice. Moderate body. Dry finish, and smooth.

3.87,1.6,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a pale yellow/orange color with a massive off-white head.  The smell is of fruity esters with a trace of yeast and alcohol.  A combination of peach, grapefruit, yeast and a warming alcohol make of the combination of flavors in this nice American-made Tripel.  It is a light to medium bodied brew that finishes a slightly sticky-dry.  Overall good brew!  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Oct 03, 2002"

4.52,18.6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Light amber color, and cloudy from the yeast.  Big white head that is evidence of the extra fermentation.  Smell is similar to their dubbel, spicy dried fruit.  Perhaps with a bit more spice.  More spicy fruit in the taste, with definite alcohol presence.  Spiciness is in command of this brew, with a good balance of bitterness and maltiness in the background.  Lots of carbonation makes for an interesting mouthfeel.  Great malty finish, which is a big factor in defining a great beer for my palate.  The large amount of carbonation makes this more of a sipping brew.  Quite an impressive one though, another masterpiece from New Belgium!","hyuga","Sep 08, 2002"
4.3,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is one of the best American versions of a tripel I have tasted.  A bright golden color leads to a fruity malt aroma.  One taste and you recognize a tasty, clean, crisp fruity beer that hides its alcohol content well until you have a couple more.  Just a great refreshing tasty libation.","beernut7","Aug 27, 2002"
4.33,13.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Peachy-gold hue with subtle highlights of bronze, the white head was fluffy, modest in size, it reached a finger in height. Very good retention, a thick foamy cap lasts quite awhile. I let the yeast find their way into my glass; they slowly danced their way to the bottom. It is a beautiful sight that needs to be set to music. It laced it thick rings. Awesome. The nose is a lovely blend of sweet candy sugar and alcohol, in the background notes of floral hops, pear-like fruitiness, and marshmallows. The nose is very pleasant, fair potency. I have a young bottle of beer Im reviewing, eight months before it expires and thus the alcohol sharpness on the tongue is a tad too strong. It needs to mellow. That is my only beef with NBs Trippel but that problem can be remedied with cellaring. On the palate the candy-sugared sweetness, marshmallows and bubblegum blends wonderfully with floral hops and fruitiness. The malt is noticeable as a background entity, which is very well done. The yeast provides just a kiss of earthiness. The alcohol is belly warming; it also provides spiciness on the back of the tongue, which is quite lovely. And it does find its way to your brain. Medium body with modest, natural carbonation that is very fitting for this beer. This is a very respectable Tripel, now factor in the cost ($6.00 a six-pack) and you have a bargain that cannot be ignored. When I need a Belgian-style beer NB is always there for me. God Bless Them. This is an absolutely lovely beer. Recommended.","bditty187","Aug 04, 2002"
4.32,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is another fine example of the new belgium brewing company. This beer pours a deep golden color with a very large creamy white head. The head lasts alot longer than most brews from this company which is a good thing. There is a fruity smell to the beer. Upon first taste you notice light malt sweetness with alot of hop and fruit flavors. Also there is a slight wheat taste. The beer also has a slight alcohol flavor to it, which isnt too overwhealming. Overall this is a very good beer.","usualpulp","Jun 26, 2002"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"An award-winner that doesn't live up to its tall billing.  Quickly dissipating white head.  Very spicy nose, slight alcohol hints.  Flavor is part wheat and spicy, though one would hope for greater complexity","Andy","May 07, 2002"
4.15,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Billowly, thick & creamy persistant white head. Golden, slightly hazy hue that seems a touch darker than the norm for a tripel.  The large amount of yeast sediment in the bottle indicates bottle conditioning.  Complex fruity esters include clove, which dominates, but subtle pear and banana notes can be discerned as well.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  Tastes a bit cleaner than other Tripels but is still complex in flavor.  A nectar - like sweetness upfront is ensued by fruity yeast byproducts including notes of pear and green apple acetaldehyde.  Just a hint of hop bitterness rounds it out in the finish.  A well balanced, well brewed and fresh tripel, though not as intense as some Belgian tripels if you can find them fresh.  Gold medal GABF 2001, if I recall correctly.","marc77","Mar 20, 2002"

4.24,11.3,4,5,4,4,4,"For the price, this is a damn good trippel.  One of the best six packs for under $8.  It's only slightly below the level of the good Belgian trippels.","mmthompson33","Oct 15, 2001"
