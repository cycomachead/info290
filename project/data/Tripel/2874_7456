Interesting aroma of stone fruit and orange juice, light bready yeast; spicy with an odd agave component. One of the more intriguing tripel aroma I've experienced. Flavor follows with apricot, orange, lime and apple juice, light bready yeast and hints of coriander and clove. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A very fruit forward tripel with nice balance. Not as intense as some other Belgian tripels, but a nice complex fruit body that is quite enjoyable. Finish has tripel spicing and light hops, but pleasant residual stone fruit flavors as well. Oddly, the flavor seems to become more bland as glass sits and warms. However, I will return to this tripel again.","LiquidAmber","May 08, 2013"

Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, apple, pear, herbal, floral, bread, earth, pepper, clove, coriander, grass, and yeast spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of pear, lemon, apple, apricot, pepper, bread, earth, herbal, coriander, floral, grass, honey, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, herbal, bread, grass, pepper, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Nice flavor balance and complexity; and no cloying sweetness. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish.

Nose is on the dry side, lemony perhaps more towards Meyer Lemon, a significant botanical/pepper presence though staying on the sweet side. floral herbs on the back end.

Taste is much more bold, bursting with the fruitiness of the yiest, sweet yet balanced, peppery spiciness accentuated by the supple carbonation that coats my mouth. Definite honey flavors. This beer reminds me of a many-times upgraded version of leffe blonde - similar apricoty, honey-like sweetness, but toned down in the feuillien, and more refined and well-integrated into the layers of complexity. Medium bodied, alcohol is very faint if noticable at all, and no harsh flavors for sure. I believe this sample was fresh, and while I haven't had it aged, it's hard to see how this beer can improve.

Carbonation is real low, as a matter of fact I can't really even feel in on the tongue, not even when looking for it.

Lots of spiciness on the palate (suggestions of clove, nutmeg and cinnamon) with wheat, woody/earthy hops and chalky yeast behind it all.

The snifter helped capture the prevailing clean smells of spice, pepper and citrus-reminiscent aroma of a hot spiced-orange tea. The taste was what was expected similar to the aromas-quite clean and ""crisp"" with an enjoyable linger. This is not an overpowering Ale (somewhat mellow) and would be a good introductory beer for this style. Mouthfeel was again, clean with a light and fresh zest.

The pilsner malts remain smooth and sweet, but offer a dry crispness that only Tripels can can deleiver. Sweet confectionate suars balance the spicy alcohols and create a lot of upfront intrique.

3.61,-8.8,4.5,3.5,4,3,3,"Served in a St. Feuillien chalice, the beer pours bright gold with a nice white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It has a musty, citrusy smell and also smells like cloves and bananas. The taste is very spicy and fruity, pretty much the same way it smells. There's a nice tang to the taste. It has a medium body, but the mouthfeel is too carbonated/foamy for me. I felt like I was drinking more bubbles than liquid. This also affects the drinkability, if it was less carbonated it would be much easier to drink. It's a good beer, but IMO it would be much better if they cut down on the carbonation some.","bluejacket74","Beers"
3.96,0,4,3,4.5,4,4,"To me this has a unique taste for a tripel. There seems to be more hops infused into this brew more than other beers of this nature. There is a slight tinge of honey here too.

I could smell it when it was sitting on the table in front of me and smells of ester and malts. The mouthfeel is very smooth, but you can sense the presence of the high alcohol. The was a slight burn going down the throat, but not bad. The taste is just unbelievable. It is very malty and moderately hoppy and the alcohol lingers in the mouth.

Slightly tart, fresh aroma with a dash of floral hops and yeast (Saison-ish). Crisp lemony flavor pokes it's head in, but is drown out by a wall of malt. I wasn't expecting such a solid malt flavor to this pale tripel. There is definitely a yeasty flavor, and a bit of alcohol towards the end.

Nice Saaz hops at the finish, which combine with the alcohol to give just a slight burn in the mouth. The pale malt develops as the beer warms, lending a bit more body and richness to the beer.

The smell is very faint, but is a bit like coliander and sweetness, like malts. The taste is just what it should be. No taste of alcohol at all, but a very bubbly consistancy which seems to substantiate into more of a coliander taste as it goes down the throat. There is a special something in the back of this beer that makes it not like any other Tripel I have had.

Smelled of banana, root beer and spicy yeast. Tasted strongly of home brewed root beer, pears, vanilla and a slight bit of doughy yeast. This yeast grew a bit more spicy as the beer warmed. Mouth feel was thin to medium bodied with a light carbonation. The root beer overtones really ruined this beer for me. I even handed it to my buddy and asked him to take a sip and he said, Â“tastes like the root beer from the co-op.Â” Disappointing. I'll have to try it in the bottle.","DarkerTheBetter","Dec 08, 2005"

Taste is very malty, sweeter than expected, honey and sweet light fruits. Some spices come through, although light and delicately, never asserting themselves over the sweetness. There's a slight taste of alcohol in the back of the throat. A little hop bitterness also starts to come through after a few sips. Medium bodied with a high carbonation, maybe a little too high.

Unapologetic bitterness rules over the relentless, exotic impact of the fruit. In the end it is a hard, polished marble of jazzy, peachy, effusive, bitter beer energy. Very dry. Quite good.

The taste in the mouth is nice and full, not cloying or too viscous. The main flavors are the friuty esters of pear, mango, apple and the slightest taste of banana (note-this is not a banana-bomb like some other triples, it's nicely done).

The smell is peppery with a trace of malt sweetness. Peppery spice is also pronounced in the taste, but a nice candy-like sweetness is also present. It has just a trace of hops to add a slight twang. It's very drinkable for an 8.5% beer. Nice stuff and worth seeking.","mickeymac","Feb 24, 2004"
4.32,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This was a good, tasty, easy-drinking beer. Complex and well-crafted, it hits the mark for abbey triples.","Boilermaker88","Feb 13, 2004"
3.88,-2,4,3.5,4,4,4," The carbonation is light, and the mouthfeel is very smooth. I think it could use a bit more body, but it fills out pretty well. There are a lot of sweet flavors to start you out. Dark fruits and citrus fruits, and even hints of candy. A nice grainy malt backround balances out the sweet flavor, and the alcohol lets its presence be known in a subtle way. I think this beer could have used a bit more flavor. It was good, but it seemed a bit too mellow. It does have great improvement with warming, so give it a few minutes.","ElGuapo","Nov 25, 2003"
4.2,6.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750ml into delirium tremens snifter: Hazy blonde hue, perhaps a little too clear. Dense white foam with quality lacing. Aroma of banana, very fieldish feel, light spicing and yeast character and pleasant flowers. Good malt presence in mouth, malty hay if that exists, just tart enough to mention it with notes of citrus (lemon) and apple. Overall very smooth body if a little biting. Complex, Delicious!","Rastacouere","Nov 07, 2003"

4.2,6.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange color with an awesome big fluffy head,aroma is spicey and very orange-like.I get a clove taste and aroma from this brew along with a light smokiness likely from the yeast,a light pepper taste lingers on the tongue,I have to say this was a great fing the alcohal is not at all prevelant making this to easy to drink,very very nice.","oberon","Oct 14, 2003"
4.28,8.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy golden apricot with a fluffy white head that leaves sporadic lacing which quickly ""sparkles away."" Smell is sweet with some bananas and spices (clove?). Taste is divinely belgian. Sweet apples and grapes with a champagne like finish. There is definitely a full body supported by a nice yeasty backbone that reminds you it is an abbey tripel. There is a slight aftertaste that reminds me of apple peel, but it is not at all unpleasant. Definitely one of the finest abbey tripels in the world.","TripelJ","Jul 15, 2003"
3.87,-2.3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Nice fluffy head. Mostly clear with a a little cloudiness. It might have a little too much carbonation, but the mouthfeel and taste don't suffer too much. The beer goes down smooth and tastes good. Tripels aren't my favorite style, but this is a good beer that I will buy again. Man cannot live on Dubbels alone.","Hex92","Jul 07, 2003"
4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A bright and refreshing tripel, somewhat reminiscent of Allagash. Carbonation is prominent, almost ginger ale-like in the aftertaste. Pours a large head, very foamy, with some retention. Not a lot of lacing after the initial sip or two. Quite dry and thin for the style, with a definite hop presence. Tangy and tart. If you like Allagash, try this. It's quite good and different.","JohnnyDuvel","Apr 27, 2003"
3.48,-12.1,4,3.5,3,3,4.5,"Ashen golden in hue with a slight murk. Covered by a slowly ebbing sea foam like porcelain white head. Loose, frothy trails remain. The aroma is comprised of a dominant doughy pilsner malt and yeast must combination. Understated clove phenol and an impression of lightly tart, candi sugar sprinkled lemons are secondary. Tame, pleasantly clean aromawise. Grainy, bread crust sweetness upfront in flavor quickly constricts, becoming briefly powdery and confectioners sugar like. A transiently drying contrast provided by mild green apple and alcohol derived, unsweetened black licorice arises mid palate. Fleeting sweetness is nearly completely tapered late by lagging hop bitterness and a slightly chalky, dry cracker like suggestion. Well attenuated and a touch thin in mouthfeel, but consequently portentously crisp and light on the palate. Finishes nearly bone dry, with a fading extension of herbal phenols and faint hard cider tartness. A clean, balanced tripel, with functional, but not outstanding overall character. Perhaps overly soft esterwise. Although only a couple notches above mediocre as a whole, it retains ominous drinkability. Tasty.","marc77","Apr 19, 2003"
4.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"750ml bottle: Poured out a clear yellow with a nice golden tone, thin bubbles of tight foam produced a two inch head that faded down to a light, thin haze of constant coverage from the carbonating bubbles that just kept flowing, very nice. Aroma is pretty complex with an overall musty grass, with a bright hop backing and green grape and licorice notes, quite full and strong. Taste is strong up front of floral hop and honeyish, favorably complex in hop and malt tones, has some nuttyness, and reveals some nice spicy bitterness. This is one fully packed monster thats full bodied with a carbonated texture thats a bit harsh right off the bat, had to really sip this sucker. It has some mellowing smoothness in the finish and packs a bit of a punch. Big time sipper that gets better as it warms and definately tempting to drink alot of, but isn't easy, whew...what a triple!","tavernjef","Beers"
4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Comments: Flavor is dominated by malt and hops, as opposed to sweet flavors like other triples that I have had. Nice change of pace. Oh my. Why is it that triples, like no other beer on this planet, go straight to my head after like 3 sips?","Denali","0"

4.15,4.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a golden color and formed a huge foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A good deal of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops, citrus and spices. A flavor of malt, hops and spice. A warm feel of alcohol is also present, but not overpowering. Somewhat of a buttery finish.","Wildman","Feb 05, 2003"

4.42,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Lightly hazed golden yellow-orange color as it sets in my ""Triple"" glass, the head Brobdingnagian in size, frothy in consistency, brilliant white in color with satiny sheets of lace that lovingly cling to the glass. Bubble gum, malt, excessively ripe fruit, hints of tartness even a bit of yeast to seal off this most sniffable nose. The first taste is big on the malt and also ambrosial with the top middling. Huge acidic bite with the hops powerful in their spicy bite. Dry as a bone aftertaste with the alcohol bitterness lingering on forever. 8.5 percent ABV is quite apparent in its ""Tummy"" warming sensation, also the flavors enhance as it warms to the room temperature, ""Absolutely Fabulous"".","Gusler","0"
