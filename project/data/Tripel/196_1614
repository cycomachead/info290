4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled on 6/4/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness/hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish fora good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a crisp malt/yeast/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome tripel style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 21, 2014"

Smell: ripe pear, ripe red delicious apple, notes of caramel and candied orange peel; mildly floral with a grassy note. Sweet, fruity. Taste: bready and sweet... pear, dried apricot, mild pepper and grassy notes, muted grapejuice and candied orange peel, more pear in the finish. Medium-plus bodied, very creamy feel, sugary finish. This is really very good if not a little heavy on the sweetness. 9% on the bottle. 6/2013 bottling.","babaracas","Dec 14, 2014"

Mouthfeel is medium thick which is nice for the style.

Very solid tripel aroma of Belgian yeast and champagne. Flavor was middle of the road, not outstanding or odd notes, just solidly where a tripel should be. Overall, a very good beer, but did not wow me as other tripels have. Maybe it was my mood that evening.

Dense stuff, almost like a carbonated nectar, but that rounds out the strong flavors very nicely. Whether it is as good as a Trappist ale or La Fin du Monde I can't say right now.

Taste has more sweet malts, fruitiness and is a bit chalky on the palate (but not as much as something like a Chimay White).

3.88,-2.3,2,4,4,4,4,"Affligem Tripel pours a crystal clear orange, with plenty of golden highlights shining through in the glass. The slightly dirty white head rises up to just short of 3 fingers, but disappears with alarming rapidity. It's clean too, nothing left behind in the way of lacing. Totally unacceptable for a Belgian style beer. The nose still manages to shine through well, and it's textbook tripel. Sugar soaked stone fruits and clove spiciness greet my nose, with a hint of alcoholic presence. The flavor profile largely follows the blueprint laid out by the aroma. There's some bitterness mid palate, nothing approaching an IPA in intensity, but enough to break up the sweet front end and allow for a transition to the clove phenols. There's a subtle, pleasant warming sensation from the alcohol that radiates out from my center with every sip. The body is impressively, appropriately light for a beer of it's size, and the carbonation bright and frothy. It' lacks the slight creamy edge that the mouthfeel of the best Belgians have, but it's just a spot below. Affligem Tripel is a very solid rendition of the style (appearance aside), and one I would give someone if I was trying to show them what a tripel tastes like.","axeman9182","Sep 30, 2011"

The color was a fine dark golden honey with a sweet honey-flower-malt aroma. The flavor likewise was such, with hints of spice that stuck in the nose, and a lingering alcohol on the sides of the tongue.

A good amount of sediment is suspended in the brew as a few bubbles float to the top haphazardly. Big notes of sweet and sour bread, light fruits, yeast and spice drift to the nose. A slight medicinal aspect is also noted. Tastes fruity, sugary, slighty tangy and a bit dry at first. Further exploration reveals a good almost creamy base mixed with more sweet bread, funky yeast, some nutmeg, and some furtive phenols. Carbonation is excellent, keeping the mouth-feel toward the middle of medium. The alcohol is well blended, and almost unnoticeable until the very end.

The alcohol content is hardly noticed (until your body tells you) unless you let the beer warm quite a bit. I have to be honest I got sick of it halfway through the bottle (750ml bottle) but maybe that's because I've had too many Triples lately.

Notes of pilsener malts in the nose, slight fruitiness, and slightly sweet. Taste follows suit. A bit of apple cider, some perfumey floral notes, sweet in the middle, and dry on the finish.

Apple and peach. Spice profile is very intense. However, as it rested the flavor mellows greatly, giving way to a lessened intensity of all the aforementioned flavors and a robust caramel maltyness. What was initially sharp and eye opening is now the quintessential sipping beer. Not a traditional tripel by any means, as it is much darker and richer. Let this beer sit for 5-10 minutes and enjoy.","HugoGrim","Apr 19, 2008"

I normally don't rate high ABV's with such drinkability, but for the price you can't go wrong buying a bottle of this and just relaxing with this beer.

Not a tripel that I am itching to have again any time soon, from what I've sampled so far Affligem has gotten it right with their blonde, while everything else seems sub-par in comparison.

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Thick chunks of yeast in the bottle, freely floating, despite this bottle being stored upright for 2 weeks. The Affligem dubbel too had uncharacteristically large pieces of yeast. This should be all the vitamin B I need for today. Nice, rich golden hues, caramel, showing some orange tints near the edges of the glass. The head is a mixture of medium-sized and fine bubbles, and it seemed to recede quicker than Affligem's blond. Slow moving screens of lace, leaving web-like lacing. Nearly bright white foam. The aroma is definitely superior to the dubbel or blond. A strong citrus immediately, more roasted notes, some soap, faint perfume, perhaps the slightest dash of hop, adding a subtle floral quality. Sweet honey, musky grapes, and a definite spiciness that tickles the nose slightly when inhaled deeply. Some pear, banana, even raspberry, and a creamy vanilla smell. Taste is citrus up front, lemon and orange. Alcohol well-masked in the other flavours, though this feels more substantial in the mouth. Sourish malt notes near the middle, and leaving with a decent dryness, metallic, iron-like. No real hop flavour, only dry hop feel on the palate. Mostly the finish is musky, grainy, and yeasty. Great fruit on the long finish as well. Full bodied, and extremely lingering. Phenols make a show after a few sips, albeit slight. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a brisker carbonation than the dubbel or blond; and, for 8.5%, this goes down deceptively freely and quickly. After two bottles, however, I fear the dry dustiness would become a bit much for me. This would pair well with any sharp cheese, or a tomato sauce pasta. This is a respectable tripel, by any Belgian standard.","Cwrw","Dec 31, 2004"

Carbonation and a bit of citrus tang strike the tongue first, followed by a fairly sweet (almost caramel-like) maltiness.

As it went down, it warmed inside to a smile. The carbonation reminded me of a good quality champagne carbonation. Very pleasant.","maybrick","Dec 02, 2003"
3.85,-3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This nice golden triple, was a nice dark golden colour with a lovely white cap of foam on its head. Aromas were very sweet and honey-like with some candy sugar and yeast in the mix as well. The taste was very sweet, just like the aroma. I could taste light hops and malts, candy sugar, yeast, various spices, and alcohol on my palate. The mouthfeel was spritzy, highly carbonated, and full of life. The drinkability was damn good.","francisweizen","Nov 19, 2003"
4.07,2.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Knew I was in for a treat cause the bottle was dated best before 5/03. Poured a nice hazy, golden orange color with a thin white head. Green apples, yeast, malty sweetness and alcohol dominated the nose. Very sweet, effervescent, yeasty and slightly cidery tasting, with a big, dry Granny Smith apple finish. This beer seemed highly attenuated, therefore making it a pleasure to enjoy. I'm stocking up on a few more bottles from this dating.","crookedhalo","Nov 17, 2003"
4.12,3.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours to a hazy, golden color with a thick white head. The aroma is spicy and medicinal, with a fresh, fruity aroma. The flavor is spicy, peppery with an herbal/medicinal taste. it has a light mouthfeel, but has an alcoholic warming to it. It finishes dry. Another good Belgian beer.","BeerBuilder","Nov 16, 2003"
4.05,2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a nice slighlty hazy gold color with a thick head. The aroma is pleasant with a mixture of yeast, citrus, hops, and grass. The taste is strong on the tongue - carbonationed seemed a little high but the yeast / malt / bitter ratio was good. Crisp in the mouth, and bitterness and citrus tones lingered on the tongue for a while. The alcohol is quite evident, and when the bottle is empty you can feel it. Very enjoyable and my favorite from Affligem.","Gavage","Nov 06, 2003"
3.78,-4.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability: A nice beer, very decent but not my favorite tripel. I only sampled 1 so maybe a few more would give me a better idea of how i feel.","Popsinc","Nov 04, 2003"
4.3,8.3,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Huge rocky head with definite belgian lace and a deep gold color. Aroma is subtle and complex with a definite mineral scent and light dry malt. Flavor is nice with spiciness from the yeast alternating with a dry maltiness a bit of hops running around in there as well. Mouthfeel is just perfect for this beer as there is enough of a rough carbonic bite to keep the mouth from getting bored while there is not so much as to overpower the palate. I would try this one again because i think that there is more going on here than what one can experience from one tasting session.","RenoZymurgist","Oct 16, 2003"

3.78,-4.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Blonde gold color. Extremely large white foamy head. Aroma is fruity, yeasty and sweet. A medium bodied tripel. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are spicy. Bright yeasts with touches of candy sugar. A very drinkable beer once the head diminishes. Nicely balanced. Smooth taste. Very slight alcohol bite at 8.5%. Touches of apricots and oranges. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Oct 06, 2003"

3.09,-22.2,4.5,3,3,3,3,"Aroma and taste were both extremely mild...you get the typical spiciness and hint of fruit but overall the taste was way too mild...still not bad...just average...I wont buy any more of this...","stegmakk","Aug 21, 2003"
4.03,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A very ""Belgian"" aroma -- earthy fruits (ripe yellow apples, et cetera). Sweet, fruity, and spicy -- as it should be. The esters and flavors are mopped up quickly by quite the surprisingly crisp finish.","marburg","Aug 19, 2003"

3.88,-2.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy orange with nice tight carbonation. The head actually increased for the first few minutes before settling in at about a quarter inch that lasts till the end. The aroma was of fruit and malt with a lot of yeast and a presence of alcohol. Taste is good with bread and malt, but hurt by a rubbery and sour note. A good beer at a good price.","Sixpack595","Jun 07, 2003"
3.88,-2.3,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Thick, foamy head. It grows slowly for a while after being poured and forms some interesting statue-like creations. About a quarter inch of head remains and plenty of lacing. The beer looks darks and murky... muddy. Smells of pears and spices, and is a little sweet. Tastes slightly of pears as well. Thick and creamy. Interesting spiciness that lingers. Not the best triple that I've had, but it's pretty good.","dwarbi","May 26, 2003"
3.93,-1,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"One of my first double fermented ales. Not nearly as 'chewey' as I thought it would be. The flavor is excellent - just like the bottle says, intense, robust, nutty. A little too rich to really be called 'drinkable' but excellent nonetheless. I would buy it again.","BillSempf","May 24, 2003"
4.18,5.3,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours golden amber in color with a large stream of bubbles rising from the dead center of the bottom of the glass. The brilliant white head towers out of the glass and very slowly dissipates in chunks leaving a thick rocky head and spider webs of lace across the glass. Nose is sweet and fruity with notes of banana, apricot, fig, clove, and nutmeg. Medium to full in body with a smooth velvety texture. Taste is sweet malts at first followed by notes of fruit and allspice. Some nutty yeasts are then present along with some peppery alcohol and a touch of citrus leading to a dry finish. A very nice triple.","Morris729","May 02, 2003"
4.12,3.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Drop a coaster under the glass before pouring this one. A huge white head foams up on top of a glass of nice looking beer that's yellow with just a hint of orange. Lace sticks all the way down the glass. The smell is nice and spicy with distinctive notes of yeast. The flavor starts out nice and improves as the beer warms. In addition to spicy flavors, with a nice residual sweetness that's a bit honey-like. It's very drinkable and overall a very nice beer experience.","mickeymac","Mar 23, 2003"
4.3,8.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a clear deep golden color with a little of tight white foam and nice lace. The smell had a fruity and malty aroma. The taste was of a fruity nature and a soft, sweet maltiness. Lively in the mouth and a feel of brut champagne in the finish. Nice balance of sweetness/bitterness on the finish also!","BeerManDan","Jan 25, 2003"

3.8,-4.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"It's crisp and well-carbonated, with flavors of apple, ripe pear, strong doughy yeast, and a bit of citrus. The alcohol remains subdued, carrying the flavor nicely though the mouth and nose. It's somewhat spicy in the middle. There's just a little bitterness in the finish. Not quite as complex as some other tripels, but smooth and flavorful nonetheless. Worth a try.","DerKaiser","Dec 09, 2002"
4.03,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a golden color and formed a huge bubbly white head that left circular lace. A huge amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, citrus and spices such as clove. A flavor of clove, slight bit of grain with a hint of the alcohol. The finish is light and a touch tangy no doubt reflecting the carbonation present.","Wildman","Dec 05, 2002"
3.92,-1.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The pour somewhat hazy yellowish-orange or light amber if you like. The head is pertinent in size, frothy, the lace in delicate sheets, and both light beige in color. Nose has lots of yeast, a little malt, and some fruit tones also noticed citrus like crispness. Starts malt sweet, the top skinny, finish is intermediately acidic, somewhat sour, so-so in the hops department, a quite quaffable beer, worth a sample at any rate.","Gusler","Oct 29, 2002"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I'm guessing here, but 3 years seems like a logical median to drink this. Fresh it is too raw and hot, and at whatever age this is (5-6 yo), it's gentrified and apathetic. While overall better in it's old age, I feel like I missed it's prime.","cokes","Oct 14, 2002"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Not too shabby for a triple, I have had both fresh and aged sample of this brew and have to say that it is more than a decent pick for the style and is unquestionably worth a try.","Jason","Oct 08, 2002"
3.68,-7.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I've had this beer before, about a year ago, but this time was a bit different. Still a big creamy head, good lace, nice aroma. This time the taste, or should I say lack of, was a bit off. I can confirm the date on the bottle was 05 of 03, but there was something missing. It wasn't the carbonation, which was very nice. The spicey nose and taste was still there, but the finish lacked a big... shall I say... finish. Everything is there, but for a Belgian, a bigger finish would have made all the difference.","HopheadEd","Oct 08, 2002"
3.36,-15.4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The impressively thick, persistent, porcelain white head sits atop a slightly hazy dark golden hued brew.  True Belgian lace is left.  Cidery sweetness and yeast mustiness dominate the aroma, but medicinal phenol, peppery ethyl alcohol, and a hint of heaty fusel alcohols are present as well.  Sharp, prickly carbonation hits the palate up front, then yields to honey sweetness and pleasant clovey phenol absent of the medicinal phenol present in the aroma.  Mild mustiness and a trace note of rubbery yeast autolysis prevents this tripel from reaching its intended goal in flavor.  Very well attenuated and quite dry.  Finishes with more mustiness and black licorice notes quickly fading.  Affligem Tripel, although a flavorful brew, was a bit rough around the edges, and lacked the refinement of a good tripel.  A touch disappointing, but it helped alleviate my craving for a Belgian Strong / Tripel.  It's still worth a taste, however.","marc77","Aug 16, 2002"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Very nice floral hop aroma, nice soft yeast aroma aswell, very smooth spicy start, slight sweet and then leading to a bitter finish, i think Affligem is a bit underated in my opinion, an excellent brew, nice soft spicy flavour aswell.","rastaman","Jul 22, 2002"
3.73,-6,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Slight hop flower and alcohol smell to the cork.  Very carbonated on the pour (be careful).  Yeast/hop nose with a hint of sweetness.  Bright gold hazy look.  There is a ton of little bubbles in the center of the goblet.  After the pour you will wait a while for the peaks of slightly off white head to disapate (go take a bathroom break).  Taste is one of malt sweetness and slight metal/mineral tongue followed by a bitter dry (abv) grapefruit finish.  Very interesting brew.  The finish is quite overwhelming which affects drinkability.","frank4sail","Jul 15, 2002"
3.78,-4.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The spiciness of the alcohol and yeast flavors weren't as strong in this beer as some of the other strong belgians I had lately. And despite the huge amount of yeast floating in the glass (I let it sit for days before pouring and the last quarter of the bottle wouldn't fit in the glass) it had an unexpectedly sharp and clean taste with some notes of orange or lemon.","aracauna","Apr 14, 2002"
3.74,-5.8,4,5,3,3,4,"An interesting brew. Fruity, alcoholic aroma. Champagne like effervescence and taste. Big white, foamy head with no lace on the glass. It mellowed a bit after warming bringing forth the malt, alcohol and fruit character.","John","Sep 27, 2001"
