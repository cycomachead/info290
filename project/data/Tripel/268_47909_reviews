"In Bruges today, and decided to order this with my lunch.  I got a 4-pack at a store as well, so I could give it another try at home sans atmosphere.  So-so nose...some yeasty fruit notes.  Taste was straightforward, not a super-complex triple, but very tasty and could have had one or two more if I wasn't walking with my kids.  A good tripel, but certainly not world class."
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit on the sweet side for my personal tastes, but as tripels go it's not bad at all - I'd probably rate this above other Halve Maan brews such as Brugse Zot. There are better tripels and there are much, much worse - definitely worth tracking down if you're interested in trying the style, though."

"Golden orange honey color with large white head, lots of bubbles and plenty of lacing.  Hops dominate the aroma, with a little malt and dry yeast in the background.  The hops hit first when sipped, followed by a slight fruitiness, but overall grainy, dry, yeasty taste.  Bitterness lingers in aftertaste.  Not bad, but not as smooth or well balanced as it could be."

"Damn good beer. Must drink."

"O: It reminded me of certain beers from the Van Steenbergen brewery. I can’t find fault, but it didn’t do anything to distance itself from the herd."
"Clear amber colour, a big head that disminishes but not leaves, great lace. Smell of tropical fruits, honey, spices, caramel. Good carbonation, medium to full body. Taste is similar to the smell, tropical fruits, spices, pine and some esters."

"Drinkability: Pleasant, easily quaffed tripel with well hidden alcohol."

"Half-moonman proves to be a total jerk as this is one of the worst gushers I've opened. Pours a hazy amber with dense two finger thick off-white head, settles slowly to a half inch with a sheet of clumpy lace halfway down the glass. Smell: caramel apple, pear, graham cracker, pepper note. Taste: soft sweet red apple, cooked pear, dried sugared apricot, herbal and peppery notes. Alright."

"08/16/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. A fine, fine brew. If it wasn't for the 11% ABV, I could drink this all day (& night.) Excellent body & great balance of flavors."

"Excellent hazy amber with huge off-white head, endless & respectable retention, never dies to nothingness :). Very complex and tender aroma - sunny malts, slight honey, delicate yeasts, spices & citrus. Flavour is semisweet, round, unlikely alcoholic, fruity to neutral malt palate. Oily with moderate drinkability. Anyway, excellent & mighty tripel."

"Soft clove and barnyard funky graininess meet the nose with peppercorns, bread and spice. The flavor is quite zesty and spicy with a front of cloves and peppercorns. Mid palate perceives more bread and lemon as this finishes with Apple and pear. The feel is very easy and light with a slight dryness."
"It may be the case that I go for a more defined beer in type/style/genre. Compared to many of the other trippels (Belgium only, not American versions), this one just seemed a bit more subtle in every department. Less fruit in the start, though it does stay on the finish. Less nose than others. A disclaimer: my nose may be tainted by a preference for severely hopped beers locally. Color, head, mouthfeel all fine and as expected for style."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 12/4/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big peach, pear, orange, apricot, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big peach, pear, orange, apricot, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, pear, orange, apricot, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of fruity/spicy yeast flavors, earthy hops, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome tripel style. Great complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors with moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"a very sturdy take on the belgian tripel from a brewery who has yet to really miss for me. this is a very clear and amber tinted colored version, in some ways lighter (clarity) and in some ways more grainy (darker) than others. nice off white head holds in my glass and leaves spider web lacing as i drink on it. its got a weird nose for the style though, a bit of burnt sugar, but also a funny staleness. not the typical green bottle skunk, but something else, an almost german dusty grain element thats unfamilar in belgian beer to me, and isnt all the way appealing, but not enough to turn me off. the flavor of the beer is great though, long sweet but smooth grainy front end. some oats in here lend body, while the majority wheat malt does more of the flavoring. the yeast is subtle in this too, not as ""belgian"" as other belgians, less fruity esters, maybe fermented at a lower temperature, but the strain appears active enough to eat through most of the sugar here, and the finish is dryer than many tripels on the market. carbonation is there, but its not quite effervescent, and the added body from the slightly heavier grains make it drink a little heavier than it really needs to. although, the alcohol is extremely well hidden, and not a factor in lesser drinkability at all. i think i like their quad better, and i definitely like their wild version of this better, but its a nice take on the style."

"Price Point - $9.99 - 750ML bottle"
"33cl bottle (13-04-2016) into a tulip. Clear golden color, three finger white head with ok retention and lacing. Sweet smell with citrus, apple, yeast and malt. The taste begins with sweet bisquit malts and sour apples, followed by fresh lemons, finishing with a dry hoppy aftertaste with some spice that became sweeter after warming in the glass. Slightly alcoholic taste. Medium body, high stingy carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Overall a very drinkable, highly enjoyable tripel. Would be a very good choice on a hot day."

"The Rest: A really good triple, nice body and mouthfeel, just a tad on the sweet side and too much sediment to keep it from being fantastic."

"330ml bottle. Pokal glass @Homo Sibaris (Barcelona). Deep amber color. Clear appearance. Off-white froth creates a so close, foamy & lasting crown. Wide lacing rings are left on sides. Belgian yeast, ripe fruit, candy sugar & spiced aromas. Mild toasted sweet mal flavors & biscuit notes. Medium to full body. Soft to moderate carbonation. Dense texture. Warming & harsh alcoholic sensation & spiced palate. Long sweet/subtle bitter finish. Ripe peach & apricot on the aftertaste. Nice & easy drinkable Tripel."

"O: Not a disaster but too much sweet, candylike alcohol which overwhelms the rest of the beer."
"Overall: This beer is fantastic!! I love how well balanced it is, between the bready malts, to the floral and citrusy bitterness of the hops, to the beer’s inherent sweetness. It’s excellent!!"

"A very nice tripel, leaning more on the fruit side rather than the spiced. Refreshing and drinkable."
""
""
""
"Straffe Hendrik Brugse Tripel is a highly under-appreciated offering; it's just as good or better than many brands closely associated with the style (i.e., Chimay, St. Bernardus, Maredsous, etc). If you like Tripels and you're already familiar with the usual names, definitely give this one a try."

"A nice hazy orange, with negligible head. Looks flat at a glance. Not much for the nose but a nice, light, slightly sweet, triple taste. The alcohol nips rather than bites. Does have a gentle fizz in the mouth and goes down very smooth."
"Poured an orangish golden body with one finger head that left minor lace on top of a yeasty, citrusy (orange) aroma, complete with some sharp spice and a hint of candi sugar and breadlike malt. First impressions on my tongue are that this beer has both a grainy, cracker/bready malt base and a sharp carbonation and touch of pepper to it which leads to a somewhat chewey, medium-bodied beer that finishes with a snap. Touches of sugary sweetness give minor counterpoint, not exactly balance, tropical (pineapple or pear, something along those lines) and citric (orange) fruit notes. Good balance, nice flavors, not my favorite but it's not watery or rip or anything negative."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a bit sugary but not much of the classic Tripel yeast profile that is hard to capture but delicious. There alcohol and fizz with some sweetness makes it ok to drink but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very enjoyable beer to drink slowly and savor with a nice pastry, fries or maybe mussels."

"Notes: A malty trippel that isn't spicy, but is complex, interesting and floral-orange-y."
"Apparently the bottle has a bit more bitter to it. On tap it's a tad more mellow and sweet. So might be worthwhile to have a try from the bottle as well."
""
""
""
""
"O - Really like the balance in this beer. A little sticky in sugar but the ABV is very well hidden."
""
""
""
"Nice example for a belgium tripel, comes across a bit robust for the style, has a lot of flavour, but doesn't work as well as some others I've tried. I would still recommend this as a very good beer. It works pretty well."
""
""
""
"D = Really drinkable. The alcohol stays pretty well hidden and the flavors are interesting yet easy to move through. I will be buying this again."
""
""
"Medium to full body, average carbonation and very dry on the palate."
"Very well done tripel. Will not replace St. Bernardus but still a worthy contender."
""
""
""
""
""

"Was a touch crackery, with some candi sweetness. A little more tropical fruit was present here, which segued into a dry, peppery finish. Quite nice! This really hit the spot! Prosit!!"

"Overall pretty solid, and it does have a nice menthol action to it on the finish."
"O: This beer is a good representation of the style and has its alcohol surprisingly well hidden."

"There are better Tripels out there but this one is still fairly decent."
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, slight spice, and some citrusy aromas. Taste is much the same along with some honey and chalky flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"O: Overall crisp clean and very easy to consume and forget this is 9.0%abv that feels and drinks almost like a session in the beginning. Enjoyable triple with a hidden alcohol that makes for easy, generous sips. Not overly spicy, overly inundated with alcohol, just a very good example of a cleanly brewed and well crafted triple that many will overlook in their pursuit of the next bigger, bolder thing. The alcohol will catch up with you in the end, but you’ll enjoy the ride getting there. Crazy smooth drinkability even with all those yeasty chunks."
""
"O: an alright tripel. It needs a crisper body and more depth, but it's still solid."
""
"O/D - A solid tripel - especially if you lean towards the dry and clean side. Not as sweet as today's modern tripels, which makes me think this goes back to the age where these beers were a little more wild and more attenuated (maybe not clean). Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel was full but not heavy. Taste was complex, fruit layered with malt and hops. A very smooth brew, well balanced between sweet and bitter. This was one of the 180 offerings at Bilbo Baggins, in Alexandria, VA. I strongly recommend the beer and the pub."
""
"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a cloudy medium orange amber with tons of floating yeast particles. A thin white head with light lacing and good retention. Aroma of light fruit, malt and Belgian spicing. Taste is similar to aroma. Pleasant light fruit, sweet malt, spice. A bit of a hop kick in the finish. Nicely made tripel. Worth a revisit."
""
""
""

"Taste is fruity with pears, sweetness, hops, malt. A complex beer with very good clean taste. Mouth feel is quite nice with just the right carbonation. Definitely a fine brew."

"O: This is a nice tripel that hits all the high points of the style. Out of the bottle I found it to be slightly too prickly and bubbly to really be a knockout, but it is a very good tripel nonetheless."
"Overall, after an absence of a decade, I may have built up Straffe Hendrik in my mind a little bit. It's still a very good triple, but not the mind blowing beer I remember from Brugges. Perhaps my palette has matured. In any case, a happy walk down memory lane."
"Nice silky mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation. Overall, it is a bit above average, but nothing to write home about. A bit high at 9% abv for an afternoon sipper, but it's hidden well. Well made, just nothing out of the ordinary."
"The beer had a medium feel to it with great carbonation. The beer was clean, crisp and very pleasant to drink. Overall, a very good example of the style."
"Straffe Hendrik's Tripel pours a totally clear dark orange. It's a little dark for the style, and it has a bone colored head that maxes out at about four fingers in height. Head retention is pretty good, but aside from a near solid ring at the top of the glass, lacing is very spotty. The nose is disappointingly weak, but there are some classic tripel elements presence. A sweet pale fruit aroma (primarily apricots) by far dominates, and it's supported by a surprisingly potent earthy herbal hop smell. Spice/clove phenols are barely there. The flavor starts out just like the nose, big apricot/fruit and a little bit of candy sweetness. The mid palate bitterness is a little bit sharper than I would have anticipated, but still keeps itself in check. Noble hop influence is a little bit less intense here, leaving a little more room for the phenols to shine through. The mouthfeel is up there with the best of them. The body is light, yet creamy, and the carbonation is effervescent and lively. Straffe Hendrik's tripel is a decent beer, but I'm pretty confident I could find a tripel I prefer to this one on the shelves of most decent bottle shops."
"O: I think I have to finish the 4 pack to know more, I will write more later. I like it."
"Pours translucent gold with a lot of snowflake/dandruff yeast flakes. Huge foam that has staying power. Nose reminds me of yeast-bready banana bread, holiday cakes, and pineapple display at a Hawaiian buffet. Palate offers plenty of pineapple, tartness, wheaty/malty backbone, and a chewy yeastyness all through till the finish. Also has a musty, female pheromone sort of mustiness to it, in a good way. Smile."
"O – A solid triple."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer, but lacking in the flavor depth I was expecting for the price"
"It's sleek and classic; impressive in being able to match it's own alcoholic strength."
"Price = $10.99 at Whole Foods (NYC)"
"Overall: tasty and drinkable, this beer's flaws are more in appearance than anything else. I would have this again, though."
"O: very easy to drink, also very refreshing after a long night at work."
"Easy pour with a decent head. Straw coloring but almost no aroma. A slightly more biting taste of hops than most light Belgians but not overwhelming at all. The flavor isn't too impressive for the style, but I was surprised that I didn't detect the level of alcohol present."
"O- Great Belgian tripel, but on the outside looking in when you're talking about the best in the style. Still, this is definitely worth picking up, and I will continue to enjoy this magnificent brew. Nice summer tripel that's not too heavy. I'll continue to drink it year round though.... Cheers."
"A worthy effort."
"Amber golden color, minimal head, not many bubbles present. Aromas of caramel and booze. The taste is full bodied but lacking complexity, very one dimensional. Flavors of dried fruit and honey Teddy Grahams. The finish kind of just creeps up, there is no progression of flavors, just sweet malt and a warmth from the booze. Mouthfeel is slightly rich, slick. Ok at best, not a favorite."
"Definitely in the raw and it shows though stays well within the style, a good pick."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent Tripel, but I wouldn't call it one of my favorites by any means. It is too under-attenuated for the style and it lacks the necessary crispness that this beer requires. that said, it is a pretty decent beer overall, and it you call it a Quad, it is fine."
"For fans of the sweeter style of Tripels, you can do no wrong here checking this bad boy out."
"A nice little beer, but certainly not among my favorite Tripel's ever. Glad I tried it."
"This could be a really dangerous fallback in the stable of tripels."
"A lovely tripel that posesses a rich yet subtle flavour. The first time I had this was with dinner, and I concluded that it went well with food. Not an everyday beer, but worth seeking out."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Tripel."
"I dug this alot. Easier drinking than some; VERY smooth. Fruit and toast balance is great. I got the last bottle and am glad I did."
"draft at Fire Works, Arlington"
"D: Average at best. My first experience was with a fresh 330mL bottle. The younger, smaller format suited me much better and was nothing short of impressive. This bottle was practically forgetable."
"A pretty good tripel."
"Personally I find the high carbonation a little off-putting as it masks a lot of the initial taste but that is to be expected with this style of beer so it's more of a personal opinion. I'm not a huge fan of this one but it's not unpleasant."
"Drinkability - wonderfully complex and good-tasting brew. Very interesting all the way from looking at the bottle to the last sip."
"I enjoyed this one. If blindfolded I would have guessed it was a darker beer. Very smooth. Will be a great summer beer too!"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. at 9.0% ABV it goes down really easy."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange gold with about one finger of white head that settles into a foamy collar. Predominantly sweet aromas with strong notes of bubblegum, honey, and baked pastries, not unlike baklava. All of these notes carry over to the flavor, where they are intensified. Lingers long and sweet. A nice dessert."
"I'd like to like more tripels, but there are so few that don't look like crap and taste like old lemonade. This is not one of those, but it might not satisfy the principled tripel purist."
"Way to sweet of a beer, it really gets quite cloying and isn't something I want to finish a glass of. The aroma on this beer wasn't actually half bad and had me hoping that this was going to be a decent beer."
"Not a tripel that goes for the jugular, but also nice to know you won't be getting an instant headache either (I love a good tripel, but they're beastly things sometimes). An easy, pleasurable, uncomplicated beer that drinks like any number of other quality Belgians. Just not a tripel for newbies, as it will definitely give the wrong impression."
"A nice malty brew. It has plenty of clove flavor."
"A jolly tripel to drink. A bit expensive compared to other in it's class, however tripel lovers shouldn't shy away from putting this on their list to try."
"Warming, rich, light effervescence and full-bodied. Very good."
"Drinkability - This was a nice, easy drinker but not the heavy-hitting Tripel that I had hoped for."
"the drinkability is good it drinks like beer with ahalf it's abv. overall, it was a very pleasant surprise. it's very good tripel, with something a little different to offer due to it's uncharacteristic malt profile."
"More alcohol than the smell indicates--this warms the throat in the swallow. Light hop, lots of light Belgian yeast. Thinner than most tripels, but the lower carbonation seems to make this one work. This ended up being a very good apertif before dinner in Bruges."
"Can wait to try it again for a re-review."
"Pours an almost clear golden/amber color with a big white head that goes down rather quickly. In the nose I get some fruitiness (mostly pears and melons). I also get a bit of banana and spice. The taste has a lot of pear and spice flavor to it, with a banana taste following. The alcohol is AMAZINGLY well-hidden in this beer. I cant even taste it at all. There's a lot of cantaloupe and honeydew flavor to this triple. The mouthfeel is very nice. It was exactly what I was expecting from a triple. The drinkability is a lot higher than I was expecting (although I find most triples to be very drinkable), due to its ABV. Solid beer."
"I like this beer quite a bit. Belgium just makes really good beer, even if it's not Trappist"
"O A very nice tripel. This one has a little more bitterness than others, but is an overall good beer."
"Overall, a unique take on the style. Worth trying."
"D - This is a pretty good tripel. It was certainly worth a try."
"D - Drinking it at the BA Brandy Hunahpu event, shockingly this ends up as one of my top 5 favorite brews of the substantial day. Surprisingly good."
"A good Tripel that fares much better than most. But a few nuances keep it from being world class."
"Drinkability: Not sure what a Brugse Tripel is supposed to taste like but the brewery claims this is the last authentic example; really enjoyed this beer"
"Drinkability is only OK here but cold this one could go down quickly and with a lot of volume."
"Drinkability is good."
"Drink this at the brewery in Bruges if given the chance."
"D: A nice tripel. I enjoyed the fruitiness of it and that although it did have sweetness, it's not syrupy and maintained that dry finish."
"D- Slightly above average in the drinkability department. The metallic aromas and flavors will keep me from having another glass."
"Body is about average, maybe a little full for the style. Alcohol well hidden except for a prick towards the end. I don't quite love the ester fruitiness that takes over, and it starts to taste more and more like old banana as it warms. Drinkable but not elite Belgian beer here."
"Drink: Ends sweetly, leaving you wanting more - but possibly too sweet which can also be a little turn off."
"Drinkability: A tasty brew that drinks remarkably easy despite its supposed 9% ABV. All in all, it's a very delightful, heck, even picturesque example of a tripel."
"This a wonderful representation of the tripel style. Very easy to drink and agreeable, with nothing off about it. If you like this style at all, do yourself a favor and give this a try."
"Very smooth light flavor and mouthfeel. Sour and bitter yeasty finish with a good Belgian character. The yeast flavor is the most dominant thing in this beer, and I am glad. They really let the malt and hops play a light background role to a very drinkable tripel."
"The drinkability is awesome. This brew has sugars and spices and is very tasty. I love the smell of bananas as I sip this awesome brew. Where is the 9%, dangerous!"
"D - At 9%, it's a bit too drinkable, if you get my drift. I could drink this all the way to the hospital. Yum! :)"
"Able to drink this one too quickly. Could be a killer if I was prone to drink more than 1 or 2 at a sitting. The milder flavors also enhance willingness to drink more. Be careful."
"Another example of the triple style that adds to the Belgian reputation. It's not exceptional, but it's decent enough to try."
"Would I buy more of it? - I'd say yes, especially to share with friends as this is a beer with some history and rather strong."
"A very drinkable triple, this beer assumes a place on my list as one of the best tripels. At 9 percent, it is getting to my head, but as I drink it slowly, in a very pleasant way."
"I like the carbonation, but I wish there was more to the ""bottom."" The aftertaste doesn't blow my socks off either, but it's not unpleasant. This is a good beer that I can see myself buying again."
"Biggest problem to me is the fact that the head dissappears almost immediately."
"D - Not bad, the sweetness and bubblegum yeast character becomes a bit cloying by the end of the glass. Nice peppery notes and malt character, especially in the finish. Drinkable, but there are better beers in Belgium."
"Notes: A nice tripel and my favorite beer from De Halve Maan."
"Taste is malty with the biscuit malt offering complexity to the beer. It adds a grainy taste and maybe an extra maltbitter kick, which combines well with the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness comes through and shows a clean bitterness, which combined with the rather clean yeast profile, steals the show. However the bitterness is starting to become a little sharp, with a lack of real malt sweetness. And where is the alcohol? You could have fouled me by saying this beer is only 6%."
"Medium and creamy body, some very limited alcohol warming sensation. Overall the beer is excellent - I was told that in the beer shop and now I believe it. It is a pity I have only one bottle of this beer."
