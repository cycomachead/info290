The smell is quite fruity most of that citrus with some yeast and other esters in there as well.  I'm also getting some slight bready malt but really no indications of hops or the alcohol which makes up a good portion of this.  The taste is very peppery, spicy and citrusy just what I'd expect to find in a tripel.  I'd say that this beer is a bit sweeter and maybe more fruity than some other good examples of the style.  The alcohol flavors are pretty well hidden but a nice warming character definitely starts to make itself known especially as the beer warms.  A surprisingly tasty tripel I'm glad I gave it a try and would would recommend it.","fank2788","Sep 03, 2014"

Yeah, it's fruit, but there's also a dominant bitterness, and it betrays its 10% ABV. Which is not to say this isn't a fine tripel. It's especially good considering it comes from a macrobrewery. It hits all the right notes of tropical fruit, sweet candy/caramel flavors, and it has the best yeast flavors I've ever had in such a large scale brew. But Tripel is a style with some serious competition, and this just isn't anywhere close to the top in that regard. Good thing for the Boston Beer Co., beer isn't a competition.","hreb","May 09, 2014"

Aroma is a volatile blend of malt, fruit, spice, hop. Flavor is like nose, mildly sweet with good carbonic tang and a little bitter to balance very nicely. Body is full and is dominated by fine sparkling wine style carbonation that adds an elegant dimension. Finish is like flavor, fairly long, has some alcohol warmth and is a true pleasure to sip.

Subsequent draws from the glass reveal a low chalkiness and a bitter denouement. A creamy middle with dry edges results in a smooth but interesting mouth-feel.

Some may find the oak nuance to be too subtle, but I found that it was just enough to influence the beer very positively and in several key aspects of the drinking process. You get it a bit in the smell, a bit in the initial taste, a bit in the middle taste, and it pairs superbly and most strongly in the finish with the great clove effect. Overall, this is quite the above-average brew, and I would recommend it to any that enjoy Belgian style ales.","BradenMK","Dec 10, 2012"

Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with this particular attempt. Appearance wise the beer looks great. It pours a beautiful slightly cloudy amber with a sturdy white head and lots of lacing. I even like the bottle. However the flavors are overly exaggerated. It is overly hopped, overly spiced, and overly sweet. As such it is a very heavy beer with a syrupy mouth feel. The strength of the flavor was truly pallet killing, like I had just eaten something very salty. Perhaps they were trying to mask the high ABV for a tripel; 10%. Indeed, the medicinal flavor of the alcohol is almost non-existent. But whatever the reason the result is an unbalanced, pallet killing flavor that I personally found more confusing than complex. The flavor was not objectionable but it was definitely hard for me to savor. And I like strongly flavored beers.","Kevin73","Dec 07, 2012"

New World Tripel is part of Samuel Adam’s Barrel Room Collection; a series of beers made with Sam Adam’s specially-made wild yeast and aged in oak brandy barrels. I don’t get much of this oak-barrel flavor and it makes me wonder if the aging process really accomplished much. Either way, still a crisp and flavorful beer","kristiekatk","Dec 07, 2012"

The flavor is similar, but has higher levels of yeastiness, much less banana, clove, and pineapple, and a wispy touch of soured green apple and just the barest touch of oak on the finish. ABV is surprisingly well-hidden for a 10% brew. Once again I find myself with the rare criticism that the beer could use some amplification of it's oak barrel qualities for a better balance. Also, this Tripel seems to have been aged by the brewery itself to the point where the alcohol and spice heat has mellowed out to my personal balance preferences. Meaning that this is one of the very few Tripels on the market that I wouldn't cellar, it's in my desired target flavor profile zone already at retail. Well worth giving a try.","WastingFreetime","Nov 02, 2012"

It appears to be well-carbonated due to many visible tiny bubbles in the beer. There are some nice herbal, clove, and fruit notes in the aromas. I pick up some tropical type fruit with some apple and white grape. I pick up some of the malt as well. One of the things brought out in the flavor is the solid malt backbone for this beer. The fruit flavors, the clove, and those herbal notes come through well. The herbal hop notes balance the sweet and bready malts. The body is medium to full with lively carbonation. The beer is smooth and finishes slightly dry. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","0"

The taste is sweet and well balanced with a lingering bitterness and slight bite from the alcohol. It's better than expected, but I would have preferred a little more dryness.

Nose expresses light, fruity esters, candi sugar, a hint of spice and a grassy quality. Taste follows nose; however, its all comes together a bit muted. There's a bit of alcohol bite at the finish and there is also a slight earthiness and a suggestion of pit fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium n consistency with a lively carbonation and a residual tingle at the finish. Overall, a surprisingly solid tripel that hits all the style markers.","Jwale73","Apr 13, 2012"

More modest tropical notes, peach, tangerine and pineapple. A bit of vanilla with more of the herbal Saaz returning in more substantial amounts than in the nose. A big rip of spice in the finish with more alcohol. Active carbonation, smooth with the alcohol being quite prevalent. Heavy medium body. A nice tripel, but not substantially complex.

It has a subtle bit of peppery action present. It is dry in the finish, and the oak-aging is quite subtle, perhaps contributing a smidge of vanilla. The 10% ABV is scarily well-hidden, too.

Overall, a good show, for a beer that is rarely reproduced correctly outside of Belgium. A must try for tripel fans. At the price (i paid $10) though, there are better originals.

The funk level on the nose isn't very high. The taste doesn't give off much funk either from the wild yeast. The fruity flavors taste decent for a Tripel and the spices do the same was well.

As it warms, some minor notes of clove come out in both the flavor and aroma. Lingering yeast character is left residing in the mouth along with a taste of banana, clove and pear.

Taste was not as spicy as I had hoped and the fruit notes in the beginning were not very strong. It finishes clean but that is the problem I feel that there needs to be a better lingering taste than what it had.

The taste follows, with the banana, cantaloupe, and clove taking preeminence. A touch of oak is in the background, bringing with it a very light ray of vanilla. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation (very light for the style) and a very smooth feel. Not a bad tripel, overall, but nothing to get too excited about.

The flavor is nicely balanced as far as a Tripel goes, but the oak is a bit much and off sets the subtleties. Citrus, mango, and pineapple with a touch of muscat grapes.

Poured in to a Duvel glass, New World Tripel is a mildly hazy orange color, with a very large three fingers of white heading. Head fades quickly enough. From the smell I detect some dry champagne qualities, some hops, a dusty, cellar like presence, and a tiny hint of fruit. Taste is again, dry, with some pear and apple skin in the finish. Taste can be somewhat soapy at times, but leaves a pretty tasty aftertaste. Body is about medium, and right on target for the style as far as carbonation goes. This beer scores some extra points for the way in which the alcohol is hidden. You really cannot taste that ten percent, though you can feel it after a few pulls. Overall I am a little disappointed considering this came from their barrel room. There is nothing off putting about it, I just find it a little bit boring.
