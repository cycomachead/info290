3.42,-6,3,3.5,3.5,4,3,"330 ml bottle into chalice, N29ID bottle code. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a small foamy off white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing very quickly. Minimal glass lacing and some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, pepper, clove, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with solid complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of lemon, orange, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, pepper, clove, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness and light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and solid complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; with a good malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid tripel style. All around solid complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A fairly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 09, 2014"

3.06,-15.9,3.75,2.75,2.75,3.25,3.75,"Overall I wasn't a big fan of this beer and I don't think it was a good example of the style, it didn't really have a single aspect that I thought was really well done or true to style, if I tried it blind I would know for sure it's a Belgian, but I don't think I would be able to guess that it's a Tripe. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, a little crisp, a little sticky, slightly boozy, a little filling and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, half the bottle is a little too much for me and there's no way that I would want another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't great, but it was still the highlight and the truest to style aspect of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were the downfall of this beer and they were both bland and not true to style. I might buy this beer again if I know for sure it's fresh but other than that I don't think I will be revisiting it any time soon and I wouldn't recommend it either. All in all I wasn't a fan of this beer, I wasn't expecting anything too special since the other Bornem beers weren't that great, but I was at least hoping this would taste like a Tripel and I was disappointed that it did not. This is one of the crappier Tripel's I've had, but it still isn't as bad as that Bornem Amber that I had to drain pour. This one seems like it needs a lot of work, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jun 04, 2014"

However, a finger length of white head remains atop the beer without much in the way of lacing. Plenty of tiny streaming bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom and side of the glass. There are fruity aromas. I detect green apple and pear. There is some sweetness from the malt and the candi sugar as well. It smells like a typical, but decent tripel. There is a nice malt backbone to this beer, brining some solid bread flavor. The fruit flavors are a bit more subdued, but the apple and pear are definitely there. The alcohol is detectable in the flavor as well. The body is full with strong carbonation. The beer is smooth, but lacks the typical tripel dryness. The alcohol is very warming and this definitely is a sipper. This is a good beer that did not quite live up to its potential.","acevenom","Jul 28, 2012"

Perhaps too much clear candy or lacking diversity of ingredients.

It finishes with a yeasty twang flavor that lingers long after each taste as passed. The feel is watery at the front that grows to medium bodied feel.

The nose was a little of everything you would expect from an abbey style, but the alcohol was starting to dominate, which I usually don't detect over the normal aromas.

While there is a nice grainy quality that presents a mellow tropical fruit aroma, clove, banana and yeasty biscuits come though. Man this is just an odd combination. it actually kind of put me off. The taste reminds me of a big Hefe. Really. Big banana flavors, clove, a bit of nutmeg, and yeasty biscuits. While Tripels are not my favorite style, this one just seems completely wrong for the style. The mouthfeel is light, with a rather light carbonation also.

Nose has a bit of citrus hops, spices, and a mild fruit aroma (that I cant quite put my finger on but im thinking something lighter-skinned) blended with a bit of sulfur. Taste is slightly sweet upfront from a mix of malt, clove, citrus and alcohol. Quite noticable alcohol presence in the taste throughout most of the body to a bitter dry finish. Picking up on a bit of sulfur in the finish as well that gets masked by a lingering taste of what I am picturing as bad fruit mixed with yeast and a touch of hops for a bitterness kicker. The higher than average carb level is helping to support the layer of head that still remains despite the initial quick dissolve.

Almost artificial. Bananas, cloves, malts and medicinal alcohol. First taste has plenty of fruit. Bananas and green apples. Bit of raw sugar as well. However, it's ruined by the taste of alcohol. It's not good alcohol. It reminds me of cheap vodka. If this alcohol were gone, or subdued significantly, the taste score would be at least a 4. But this cheap vodka taste turns me off.

Moderate hop aroma of perfumy and flowery hops a little overwhelming here and a bit solvent-like smell in the background is noticeable as it warms. Velvety mouthfeel bursts with flavors of esters like what was found in the aroma but once again there is a bit of a solvent-like hard alcoholic warmth lurking in there as well as a bit of a vegetal asparagus-like flavor. Rosy hop flavors and a slight hop bitterness don't quite balance the malts here so it finishes quite sweet.

A golden/pale orange body that had a very citric aroma, orange and pear picked up mostly. The taste is rather earthy, not too fruity, and it wasn't that smooth going down despite a medium body at best. Just not balanced that well, so it went from overly dry to watery at some points and there was even a metallic twinge on the backbite when I finished this.

The smell is all yeast, lots of citrusy smells, musty, a bit perfumy, but quite subtle on the whole. This beer is exceptionally well carbonated, and you will see the efforvesence streaming upwards for the duration. This is a medium bodied beer with plenty of yeasty backbone and a very dry, bone dry character. The taste is characteristically Belgian in that you will get that nice yeasty, dry bite. What's lacking is the candied sugar consistency, the fruity notes, more citrus in the finish, and a more full body overall.

Lingering warmth and dry bitterness that blends nicely with the fruit character. High carbonation, light body. Alcohol is part of the character, but is restrained throughout.

Tastes as it smells...like a bubbly wine. As it warms to room temperature, it loses some of the bubbliness (is that a word?) but becomes more drinkable in my opinion. One can taste the high alcohol content...if that may be a positive or a negative thing depending on taste.","rustymoore","Jan 28, 2006"

3.55,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Hazy, white gold in hue, dull in appearance, minimal animation is noticeable. The head was a very bright white in color; it is stark in contrast to the color of the liquid. At the apex the head was almost three fingers in height. Retention was decent; it slid fairly quickly to a modest cap. There was no subsequent lacing. It is not a stellar looking beer. The nose is alcoholic. It is a bit much. While I wouldnt call this aspect of the bouquet harsh, it is fairly unpleasant. Dry white wine aromas, traces of herbs and marshmallows with some lemongrass as well, at the back. There is a slight level of solvent. Overall the potency is modest at best, it is too low for me. Couple this with the fact the construction isnt great. It does say Triple but it doesnt sell me on that. The nose is apathetic (all things considering). I found the palate to be a little too harsh, it is raw and unrefined yet scrawny in spots. There is little hiding the alcohol; while it is not scalding hot it is warm. It is like Arizona heat, dry. The aridness is Orval-like; to bad the rest of the palate doesnt have the same complexities. Also the noticeable cleaning fluid taste is unpleasant (thankfully it is very slight). There are also some slight hints of herbs, grass, and dried fruit (pears and apples). Faint spices as well, acidic, and a note of brett. With all that said, Im not thrilled with the palate, harsh on one hand, weak on the other oddly delicate when it shouldnt be. This triple is workable as a substitute for champagne. Medium in body, big lively carbonation that fits this beer ideally. Pleasantly dry aftertaste without much residual tang, clean in other words. It works well on this beer. I cant foresee another purchase of this beer, as there are much better triples. It is not bad, it just doesnt jive with me.

3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This one poured a hazy, pale golden, while the head stole the show with its stiff peaks of egg white like head. Delicate malty/nutty and tart fruit elements form the aromatic structure here. A crisp mouthfeel and tangy fruit attack start things off, and as the tingle of the cleansing carbonation subsides, bright citrus flavors come to the surface enrobed in bready malt flavors. This brew has a nice acid backbone that say to me: Give me some food dammit-you're cheatin me out of my just acolades.(I can see this working nicely with a piece of white fish, a side of potatos cooked in white wine and butter, and a crisp green salad.) Plenty of yeasty/lemony goodness on the tail end and a good and long malty finish. I'm going to use this more often with a meal and report back.","moulefrite","Dec 12, 2003"
4.16,14.3,5,4,4,4,4.5,"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light orange-yellow color with a heaping 5 finger Duvel-style head. I swear the foam went a good inch over the top rim of the glass and didn't spill over, that's how thick it is! There is lots and lots of lacing left here. The smell is fairly sweet with pineapple, orange, and sugary malt. The taste has a mild tartness at the beginning. It has a lot of that citrus on the tongue as well, and a slight bit of alcohol and sourness to the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy and strong. The drinkability is very good for a brew with this much alcohol. A nice tripel.","SheepNutz","Dec 08, 2003"
3.79,4.1,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is intially largely malty with a crisp continential grain bite and and a large carbonation bite with a hop finish to the fore palate. Coconut becomes apparent in the finish before being swamped by a large chard of cinnamon like spiciness.","drewbage","Nov 26, 2003"

The nose is pleasant, full of sugar and spice and everything nice. The mouth is quite prickly and somewhat heavy with candy. The taste is nice, if you like this sort of thing. Starts sweet, with fruits and spices, followed by some malt. The alcohol and hops emerge in the finish, leaving a warm feeling in the belly and a bite at the back of the throat. The sweet and spice resume control of the aftertaste, but the hops linger somewhere in the background. Not bad at all, really.","Globetrotter","Nov 23, 2003"
3.9,7.1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"75 cl bottle. Particulate pale golden color. I'm enjoying this one myself and I expect the second goblet to be a whole lot hazier. Thin white head is left shortly after pour. Vinous, winy, sweet aromas melded with musty hops and a healthy dose of alcohol in the nose. Lime citrousy bite initially, leading to softer, more sweet tones perfect interlaced with musty hops. Nicely balanced. This beer and maybe Kasteel Tripel would be perfect substitutes for a dish that calls for a Chardonnay or similar white wine to complement it. Kind of funny how I've had countless bottles of this beer and finally got around to giving it props...","crookedhalo","Nov 20, 2003"
4.83,32.7,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a very pale straw color. Nice amount of head that coats the top of the beer the whole way down.

Flavor is more muted than I expected and combines with lesser carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Yeasty and vinous late and on further sips, more consistant front to back.

3.91,7.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Carefully poured, the body is a clear yellow gold that's capped by an inch or more of creamy bright-white foam. Fairly large bubbles stream quickly towards the surface, helping to support the head. It displays excellent retention, and leaves some very nice sheets of lace - although they tend not to stick, but rather rise up just above the head and drop along with the level of the beer (probably due to the high level of alcohol). In the nose, light fruits (pear and green apple - is it from acetaldehyde or yeast?) and a mild solvent-like character dominate. Some spicy alcohol is also present, but it doesn't detract. The effervescent carbonation tickles the tongue before warming to become creamy - which gives it's light body a fuller feel. The flavor displays a mildly candyish and lightly fruity malt that harkens back to the aroma with its notes of green apple and pear. But it's only lightly sweet, as it's backed by a firm, drying bitterness; a wash of drying alcohol, and some soft clove-like spiciness. It finishes dry with some fruitiness that quickly fades to reveal a clear note of peppery, warming alcohol which lays at the front of the tongue and in the throat. Overall, it's a pretty good tripel at a nice price; but it is a little hot. There are better examples of the style available.","NeroFiddled","Jul 22, 2003"

Decent nose that shows real complexity and character, mixing fruit and spicy aromas with its malt and hop base.

4.65,27.7,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Slightly hazy light golden color with an immense fluffy white head that left a decent amount of lace. The aroma was superb, with complex blend of esters of clove, coriander, light fruit and alcohol. The taste was smooth and wonderfully rich, with flavors of fruit, sweet malt, and alcohol initially obvious. The beer became more complex in the middle as subtle spices came through and the malt varieties defined themselves. The finish was sweet and slightly tart, and very smooth. A world-class Tripel in my opinion.","jaz","Jun 13, 2003"

Alcohol actually is dominant, including warmth from it. Other flavors include malt and the cloves and spices. Mildy smooth, but high alcohol crates a bit of a bite that's not that pleasant.

But the first time I tasted this triple I rated it 2.5, this time I have given it an average of 4. What a change from the first time I tasted this ale.

Flavor's a touch dry, body is light, everything's in order, but I find this beer quite a bit boring.

The aroma is sweet with some decently strong fruit esters (figs I think). At first sip, a very sweet sharpness is evident, and the aftertaste tickles the tongue with the 9% alcohol and fruit esters that blend nicely.

4.2,15.4,4,4,4,4,5,"Hazy golden hue, covered by a very thick, slowly receding, fluffy white head that leaves sparse lace.  Fruity, ripe pear like sweetness hits the nose at first, then is ensued by contrasting green apple tartness and dry, spicy alcohol and light mineral notes.  Dryish bready malt is perceived at first in flavor, then yields to candied apple sweetness studded w/ mellow clove and mild yeast must.  Characteristic black licorice muted sweetness mid palate is partially offset by lightly cidery tartness.  The well attenuated and dry overall character masks malt sweetness, which is low enough to be balanced by the mild hop bitterness.  Alcohol flavors emerge in the dry, peppery, bittersweet finish.  Soothing ethanol warmth emerges after a several second deliberation.  Bornem is a uniquely dry and flavorful tripel. Although perhaps not as complex overall as other examples, the drinkability is stupendous due to the mock lightness lended by its dry character.  Very enjoyable!","marc77","Oct 15, 2002"

'Grassy' flavor, with light fruit esters.  Taste finishes clean with a spicy, peppery flavor with sweet fruity undertones.  Alcohol and carbonation blend together to give this brew a warm, tingling feel on the tongue.  Alcohol becomes more apparent in the flavor as the brew warms - adding yet another interesting twist in the complex finish of the beer.
