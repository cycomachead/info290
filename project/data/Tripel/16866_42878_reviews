"Overall, this is a wonderful take on the style that I'll look forward to every year!"
""
""
""
"Good beer. I'm still figuring this one out."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Pretty nice American take on a traditional Belgian style of beer.  Stands up with a lot of them.  Not summer here in Boston, but definitely summer in the Southern Hemisphere where this would be enjoyed at the current moment."

"Smooth and light, would buy again"

"Overall: I took a chance with this brew considering the ingredients but boy I'm glad I did. This beer is easy drinking with a big flavor punch that is both refreshing and fruity but still has a very tasty Belgian core"

"Overall - I love the style and this beer in particular, however for the price, I'd likely pass it over in my local bottle shop."
""
"A nice way to divert my attention away from a style that I usually don't care to, well, care for. Different gravity-enhancers for starters, even if it is that darned rice adjunct, along with a neat, new to me (in beer, at least) herbal spiciness, and an elevated ABV, whose manifestation still seems duly stalled.  Maybe it's stuck in its parents' basement, trying in vain to finish off that last level, or something."

"Loved it! Poured the 750ml variety into a pint glass in 2 servings. Pours gold, goes down smooth! Feelin good after 750ml of 8.6%bac goodness! I highly recommend this brew to anyone who enjoys delicious beer! 250 character minimum? I guess I'll just add some BS here to make my review long enough to be accepted!"

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 3/13/2013. Pours slightly hazy bright gold color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange, peach, pear, pineapple, light apricot, black pepper, basil, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity of fruity/earthy yeast with balanced spice and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange, peach, pear, pineapple, light apricot, black pepper, basil, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange, peach, pear, pineapple, light apricot, black pepper, basil, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of fruity yeast flavors with balanced spice and pale malts; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely outstanding tripel! Fantastic fruity/spicy yeast complexity with balanced spice and pale malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O- So easy to drink. Very different from most tripels I have had as it more closely resembles a witbier with its lemony citrus flavors."

"A decent attempt at the tripel style."

"O: Trade Winds is a beer that’s in no way flashy or over-the-top; on the contrary, it’s balanced and drinkable, something that’s kind of odd when it comes to a tripel. Where’s the racing black pepper, the spice? From just the first sip, you can tell that’s not what they’re after; in the end, what you get is a refreshing summertime beer that just happens to share a yeast strain with a Belgian that’s historically spicy. And as far as bright and cheery beer goes, these guys nailed it."

"O- There is no surprise, Trade Winds is another winning offering from The Bruery. Being 'Familie Rue' is one of my standout breweries for 2013 (along with Anchorage and Uinta), I didn't find a bottle of Trade Winds until December. Although a little late to the game with this one, I am aware that it was not particularly fresh yet I purchased it anyway...and glad I did. It reinforces my anticipation for purchasing a fresh bottle (or two, or three) when it is released again in 2014."

"Brilliant golden hue and you can tell this is unfiltered. A half inch of tightly laced foam with robust carbonation throughout. A blend of rice and light Belgian candy sugar in the aroma. A brisk sweetness at the forefront is due to the Belgian yeast strain. The rice really adds a nice dryness quickly follows and really gives a nice spin to a Belgian triple."

"This was suggested to me by the staff at Binnys in the Chicago area. I really like the taste. At first I thought Thai basil might be a little odd. When I poured the beer and smelled I thought this was going to be good. I would buy this again. Don't walk away from this."

"Pretty good."
""
"Oddly, when a beer maker sets out to make an ""imperial"" Witbier, its ends up a boozy, syrupy and sticky mess. But without hardly trying, the Bruery created one but based off of Tripel framework instead. I rather like the beer, but not so much as a Tripel. I also like it that the experimentation factors here don't define the beer, just offers a glimpse."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: tried this on a whim expecting a decent but maybe mediocre beer. Very nice surprise. Also surprising how refreshing this is."
""
""
""
""
"O: slight wild and distinctly flavored tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The nose has notes of white pepper, coriander, Belgian yeast, rice, sweet basil, pineapple, lemon and a heavy back of breadiness. The taste is very sweet but in a delicious way. Pineapple, tropical fruit, coconut, lemon, basil, white pepper, turbinado sugar and bready notes. Medium body, nice carbonation, creamy but somewhat effervescent mouthfeel. This is like a really good classic Belgian-style tripel but instead of hops there is a very sweet, floral basil taste and instead of candi sugars there is a great rice backbone."
""
"Good lacing, excellent head retention ( wheat/rice?) Belgian tripel, sub candi sugar with rice makes for a very dry sake finish, this would be amazing with seared ahi with wasabi. You can definitely taste the alcohol in this one. 8.1 percent. Overall good but definitely a sipping beer."

"O - I understand how this wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea. That being said, I really enjoyed how tasty this brew was and was particularly enameled with the uniqueness of the beer. Definitely need to try this with some Thai or Vietnamese food."

"T: I had this at the tasting room last week for the first time and I wasn't really a fan. But out of the bottle, I like it a lot more. It does taste like a classic tripel, but it has just an edge from the rice. Honestly, I'm looking everywhere for the basil here, but I'm just not getting it. But this is a very nice tripel."

"Color was classic tripel---cloudy amber, almost orange. Aroma was nice, but weak. (Maybe my sinuses are acting up). Flavor was absolutely stunning. All the wonders of a tripel, plus a bit of fruitiness, and the basil really gives it a nice spice. Not overpowering by any means, but just so flavorful and moderate. Nicely balanced. I need to try this a few more times before I really get a handle on it. Highly recommended to fans of the belgian style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich and tangy. Spicy and aromatic flavors. By far my favorite Bruery beer. Crisply fruity like a good cider. Not totally dry with the lingering breath of sweetness. Overall it's a more drinkable sort of Tripel and thoroughly likable."
""
""
""
"I had this during a summer cook out. It looked very inviting in the glass with a color of the inside of an orange, but I felt the aroma was a little on the weak side. I couldn't taste the thai spice they were talking about but it was refreshing with a crisp finish. Overall it was pretty good, but I can't say I'll be investing in another one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"O/D - An excellent tripel - not really what has sold in the US here lately, where i think it has adhered to the funk and the dry finish of the original. Abv is fairly hefty, but still low and manageable."
""
""

""

""

"O: The breury never lets me down and I appreciate their approach to brewing. On a hot summer day this beer is a superb alternative to IPA, crisp, a little carbonation, tropical, and finally, spicy. I was not expecting this favor, but I enjoyed the fusion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-Nice take on the style, the thai basil makes a decent impression though isn't really strong. There are better triples out there, but this is a good experiment. Worth trying if you like the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprised and impressed by this beer. Probably my favorite Bruery beer to date."
""
"Low C+"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The Bruery takes the Tripel style, normally a very traditional style, and completely reinvigorates it; The Thai basil marries perfectly with the spicy, yet sweet Belgian yeast and the rice simultaneously lightens the body and adds some really nice texture to the beer. Want a summer beer that is, complex, refreshing and has some deceptive strength? Look no further. Highly recommended."
"Overall a triple that is a little different."
"O - Sweet to style, but the flavor profile still has nice integration and complexity."
""
""
""
""
""

"Very interesting herbal, spicy nose with Belgian yeasts, light malts, a slight funk and light fruits. The basil is up front and prominent. Pours brilliant peach tinted gold under a dense, finely bubbled 3” persistent, lacy white foam cap. The palate is lemony, herbal, spicy peach with caramel and biscuit notes – suggests an herbed peach cobbler transformed to foam. The carbonation is almost champagne like with a slight winey slickness. Medium body and carbonation."
""
""
"O: The alcohol is pretty well hidden making this beer easy to drink than is often the case with the tripel style though the dryness makes you want to sit rather slowly. The addition of the basil is interesting."
""
""
"another interesting and delicious offering from the bruery. this one pours a nice light golden color, mostly clear, with a really massive white frothy head with fine retention. the nose is like fresh picked apricots. I know there are none in here, but I don't smell basil or sweet malt at all, not even Belgian yeast really, but fresh apricots, its really tempting and unexpected. the flavor is subtle, not as sweet as most tripels, and yeasty more like a saison. the peppery yeast goes well with the basil, but the basil is way in the back, hardly distinguishable if you didn't know to look for it. the rice seems to add some nice body, as this beer is pretty full for its color. very bright carbonation too. overall a really appealing beer that seems to be just right in early spring. its got the right amount of spice and herbs going on, thus maintaining its drinkability despite its higher abv. as good as expected, the bruery can do no wrong in my book."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good summer brew which works well with seafood dishes, salads and Asian flavors. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Overall, it's pretty good. Certainly not my favorite Tripel, and for the price, probably not getting it again."
"O- Outstanding!!! I think I've found a new top ten favorite beer. Very balanced and subtle unlike most Tripels."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a complexly flavored but well balanced brew. Very elegant and super drinkable. Wouldn't change a thing other than the weather in which I'm drinking this (it's winter.)"
"Overall: A tasty tripel. I like the element of the thai basil. It adds a different element to the standard tripel that gives it some herbal components to it. One that I would go back to if I wanted the style because it stands out."
"O - An interesting take on a tripel & it works wonderfully."
""
"Magical brew from Mr. Rue. Inventive, fun, complex, and fitting for an appropriate food pairing. I'm glad I got to try this one."
"O-this is an extremely drinkable beer, maybe the most drinkable tripel i have ever had. the flavors are all there with out any off-flavors. it's not unique in any way. it's just a nice example of a good style. to be honest, you might want to have this bottle all to yourself."

"Not sure how old this is. No freshness dating I can see , not getting any Thai Basil (love that stuff with pork or chicken!) . Drinkable enough, but nothing mind blowing. Would buy again if I knew I was getting fresh beer"
""
"O: This review was from my notes with no overall impression."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Judging by taste alone, I think this is my favorite of the goofy ingredient Bruery beers. Very solid tripel makes for a great backbone to host the subtle thai twist. Smooth stuff indeed."

"O: this is a very interesting beer, I enjoyed it much more then I though I would with it not being one of my favorite styles, well rounded and unique."
"O - An interesting and enjoyable rendition of a Belgian tripel. The thai basil and rice really compliment the Belgian yeast and fruit elements. This beer would pair beautifully with salmon and other meat/seafood."

"O- This was an interesting beer. A little bit different then your average take on a tripel. Definitely more clementines and fruity aspect mixed with some light thai influences such as basil. It balanced decently well, but I wouldn't say it was my favorite tastes in the world. I enjoyed trying it, but I don't know if I'll be drinking this again in the near future."
""
"O - excellent summer ale. I'd say this is a sipper as it does evolve slowly but will certianly reward those who take thier time with it."
""
""
""
"Notes: Saisonesque more so than trippel or golden ale to me, if one enjoys herbal brews this is quite the treat. Good to pair with certain cuisines, and to stimulate a social gathering."
""
""
""
""
"Great take on a tripel and a spectacular brew. Although I didnt really notice any basil, but that may have been the ""funky-ness"" I was picking up..."
"O: Highly recommended, and one of the best tripels I've tasted, with a really nice twist to keep things interesting. Would definitely drink again. Great beer."
""
"Addendum: the beer happened to have warmed very nicely and it grew on my palate, and by the end of my drink, I was really enjoying it."
"Drinkability: Pretty high. Could work well with Asian food; will need to do a return test with appropriate cuisine."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Interesting mix of flavors. Not exactly sure what Thai basil tastes like, but there is definitely a herbal note. Has somewhat of a saison resemblance, but I prefer The Bruery's saisons more."
""
""
""
"Tasty. Good, but not great."
""
""
""
"O- really enjoyed this interpretation of a tripel from the bruery. With the fresh grassy note combined with the herbal aspect, this is big time appreciated"
""
""
""
"O - Always like Bruery and Trade Winds didn't disappoint. Not a convential tripel at all, but the concept they were going for came out well. Enjoyable beer."
""
"1pt 9.4 floz. bottle. Tulip glass. One of those enjoyed & shared with Robert while being engaged in informal but useful beer gathering. Inviting name doesn´t disappoint at beer appearance. Pours honey yellow in color. Rice provides clarity to such a chill hazy look. White, small bubbled, froth creates a close, creamy & slowly dissipated crown. Strong penetrating basil aroma gets along with sweet malts & subtle spiced touch to the nose. ABV is felt as a fragance far away from cloying sweet & spiced aromas from regular Tripel-style beers. Tastes as expected from aromas smooth but flavorful. Oily –no fat- malty texture lingers into a long subtle fruity finish. Low bitterness. Amazing medium body. Moderate but lively carbonation. Kind warming sensation. Yesterday I said : “Summer Tripel? No way”. Today I down on my knees & bow before a delightful & refreshing experience so “Tripel in a hot day? Why not?”."
""
""
""
"O: Very good"
"O: A well made Tripel with a nice little twist and something different. Many of those flavors you expect along with a little something extra from the basil. Very easy to drink as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, spice, yeast, and some herby/basil aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is pretty refreshing."
"An amazing and deeply complex tripel with an amazing amount of layers. Dangerously tasty as well (What 8%?)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy, golden orange color with a large, fluffy white head that takes a while before it diminishes. Scent is very spicy with a good amount of Belgian yeast. Definitely smells like tripel should, but just with a little twist from the fresh basil aroma. Very spicy and peppery with some citrus fruit and hops. Taste is somewhat buttery at first, which immediately changes to spicy and peppery. The basil plays its part in the spiciness. A bit of alcohol flavor, but not overwhelming. Some white grape flavor with just a bit of lemon and orange zest. Tons of Belgian yeast flavor. Slightly tart in the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a crisp, dry finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, tripels are one of my favorite styles when it comes to Belgian-style beers, and I feel this one was well-executed."
""
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, good-tasting and thought-provoking."
"Overall, this is a solid beer, albeit a tad too sweet. Good for sharing a few ways."
""
"Good tripel."
"Pairs with any Asian style stir fry. Fermented foods, spicy fare, and nutty cheeses. Also, a good, fresh salad never hurts to bring out the earthy textures and tastes hidden within a beer."
"A-"

"Dave"
"O - Tasty tripel with some very unique aspects"
"O: Really pleasant - not too sweet and with some variation in the flavor through the bottle."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is pretty drinkable and delicious aftertaste."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really full and complex flavors with everything coming together really nicely. The balance of the traditional Belgian flavors with the Basil and other ingredients is excellent."
""
"Trade Winds Triple(Nice name by the way) is a golden type color with some bright bronze color here and there. A nice foamy off white color, cream colored half inch of foam does not stick to the glass. Smell is off center for a triple, not your typical Belgian scent. Some spicy scent (thai basil) with big pale malt with some masked aroma hops with grassy appeal. Im not turned off by the flavor, it's just different for me, Im used to the Belgians. First off, I think the spice is a bit to pronounced, it's all I taste, that basil flavor. It sort of over takes the beer leaving no room for interpretation. Under that the light body brings forth alot of pale malt flavor. Some apple comes out in the end but the spice prevails. The body is a bit thin and watery IMO. Between light and medium, just falls short of carrying the beer further. Bright carb with bubbles, no problem there, alive like a good triple should be. A whole bottle of this would have been a chore and a half."
""
""
""
""
"a decent tripel, but there is some odd funk in there. wild yeast maybe? but i dont think this was brewed with any. the basil is hard to pick out, but i can see its impact with all the vegetal, herbal notes. i realized after i drank this that it is a summer seasonal and shouldve been consumed fresh, so ill have to give this another try. i applaud the bruery for making interesting, unique beers, but this one didnt really work that well for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not a tripel, it's its own (violent weather analogy) of aromatics. Superb."
""
"Overall a very interesting beer. Lots of fruity notes as well as slight vegetal tomato taste as well as basil. Very well-rounded and a unique take on the style. Highly recommended, would drink again."
""
"D/O: Although ""triple"" isn't my favorite style, this is probably one of my fav examples. It has a sharpness that is kind of a punch in the face, and a complexity of flavors that is really enjoyable. I don't want this ""every day", but I do enjoy it on occasion. I've had it before and I will have it again."
"Overall this is a tasty beer. An odd twist on the Tripel style, I'll enjoy finishing this bottle."
""
"O - a decent tripel. Nothing to go crazy about but I would drink it again. I hope to see more from The Bruery in my parts of town!"

"A huge cloud of head filled the glass from the tap, and it took at least five minutes for the beer to settle before I could get a full pour of this. Once it did settle, I was presented with a tulip glass of clear golden yellow liquid, with a delicate white head that almost completely disappeared. (What happened?) Aroma of subdued sweet malts, spicy yeast, funk, basil. Taste...started out okay, much like any typical tripel, with notes of sweet malts, fruity esters, and spicy yeast. Mid-palate brought on a huge wave of stale funk, basil, and overripe tomatoes. A softer pear-like flavor comes in near the end to take the edge off, but I had a whole glass of this stuff to get through, and that was just one sip. Whew. Medium body, pretty chewy, somewhat good at times, but overall, just not very drinkable at all."
""
"O: I picked this beer up because it sounded interesting. I'd never had a beer brewed with basil before. And it totally delivered. I think it's an easy drinking triple with tons of wackiness in there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an interesting take, but a good beer is a good beer. Any more basil would have thrown this way off, but I think The Bruery did a good job with keeping it level."
""
""
""
"O: This was a nice surprise for a release that was easy to find. A- grade and a wife that actually enjoyed it."
""
"O - Not too bad. It's light enough to make the drinkability nice, but still enough ofa bigger beer to get you to notice it."
""
""
"O: try it, you won't be disappointed and I feel this would go well with Thai food."
"O- Oh...my...God... I think I've found a new top ten favorite beer. This one just about reinvents the style. All I can say is...""DAMN!"""

"One of the better American plays on a Belgian beer. The Thai basil isn't really necessary, but does add a bit of character."
""
""
""

"The rice and thai basil give this beer an interesting complexion. An all around easy summer beer. I had my growler filled with it, it's likely a different experience entirely from a bottle."

"Fuller mouthfeel than I expect on a triple. Potentially from using rice as adjunct instead of usual beet sugar. I like it, just not to style as I'm used to it. Sip does have a interesting acidic feel, and yet still very smooth. Booze is quite well hidden. Everyone enjoyed and wanted more."
"O - Overall I like the beer but not because it's brewed with Thai Basil, but because it's a pretty good Tripel. I love the soft, smooth mouthfeel of the beer, I'm guessing the rice has something to do with that. Pretty good, I'm not big on the style but I'd drink it again. Cheers!"
"It's good."
"Overall: this is an interesting tripel. It reminds me more of a lightly-spiced dry saison than a tripel. Still, it's a pretty tasty beer and, above all else, original."
"O: A solid beer. The rice I can see being in there (though I wouldn't be able to prove it), but there is no hint of Thai basil. That might be a good thing, but if it's being billed as having been brewed with Thai basil i would like to be able to taste it. A good beer all the same, a nicely balanced Tripel."
"Pours a light yellowish golden color with a big thick three finger head. The aroma is spicy with hints of honey and citrus. The taste has a big sweet honey flavor with hints of candied yeast and spice. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a solid beer not as sweet as some triples but nice and complex."
"This brew poured out as a hazy looking yellow color, Really nice looking head that fluffs up quickly and laces the glass fairly well. The smell of the beer has a sweet, grainy aroma with hints of lemon in there too. The taste of the beer is light and refreshing. The mouhtfeel is soft and has it fades there is a nice little bite in the end. Overall it's a pretty good brew in my opinion."
"This carries all the peripherals of a top-notch domestic Tripel. Taste-wise (specifically, boozy heat-wise) it fails to deliver as it burns past all its nuance and charm."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with a big off white head. In the aroma, spicy basil and candy sugar. In the taste, mellow basil spice, hints of fruit and candy sugar. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry spice in the aftertaste. A bit too spicy in aftertaste, decent nonetheless."
"Made with Thai basil and spices. Pours a light golden color with a lot of vibrant, yeasty esters on the nose. There’s a good deal of spice on the palate. I pick up some citrus peel and a lot of the yeast…uh, goodness? Very effervescent. I like the experimentation going on and the way things came together."
"Overall: nice beer from The Bruery. Glad I tried it. It just didn't knock my socks off so this probably will be a one and done. But overall it's a pleasant beer."
"O: A nice tripel. I think the spice character is excellent but it is a little overshadowed at times by the alcohol that comes through."
"D - a bit heavy handed with the malt and a level of sweetness in the finish that borders in excessive and hurts the drinkability a bit. The flavors are spot on for the style and the basil adds a subtle complexity without jumping out at you."
"This beer wasn't worth the price I paid, but was a delicious concoction nonetheless. I would have liked more basil, but the beer was still unique compared to a traditional triple recipe. I would still like to try more from this brewery."
"A nice tripel with some good flavour. The tart fruitiness is interesting. Decent."
"Mouthfeel was on the thinner side. Easily drinkable and it has some nice flavor to it. A great beer for easy summer drinking."
"O: Great carbonation lifts this beer and gives it zing to match its racy spice. The rice, though present, does not add as much to this beer as the Thai basil. The aroma is good, but it does not fully uncover all the complex flavors luring within this beer. Fruit, malt, wheat, spice mix well in this beer, though the finish does have lots of spice with a slight sweetness."
"D - Tradewinds is a really tasty Asian-inspired ale with tons of flavor and a light, drinkable body for the style. Another winner from The Bruery!"
"First sip is a traditional tripel/Belgian pale ale. Not picking up much basil, this bottle might be past its prime. Maybe a hint of lemongrass, but mostly I'm tasting the Belgian yeast. Still, this is a good, well-constructed tripel."
"O: I really enjoyed it and found it to be one of the better representations of the style i have come across"
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the best American-made tripels I have drank."
"Very yeasty and full of belgiany spices. Candi sugar dominates the middle and finish. White pepper and a bit more limestone and apshalt on the finish. Lifting acidity and moderate carbonation. Apricot and peach mingle well with some tropical fruit flavors and a hint of clove on the finish. Drying hops really brings the sweet candi sugar middle to a halt and keeps things from becoming cloying. A very nice tripel."
"Taste-Spicy Belgian yeast, apricots, earthy ""dusty"" hops, very subtle undercurrent of the Thai basil, becomes more evident upon warming. A very refreshing and flavorfull brew that cries out for a spicy Thai dish or Scechuan offering, Bleu cheese salad, or even jambalaya would be a nice match. An excellent, elegant brew from The Bruery. Highly recommended."
"O: This brew really begs for a plate of food. I'd say go for the spicy food and deep bitter greens. The alcohol is perhaps a bit limiting, and the flavor profile make for a mouthful of garnishes. This is meant to compliment hearty foods, and would off set earthy foods very well."
"Overall - Quite good. I think it offered a lot more than what I was expecting."
"D: A unique Tripel. Lighterweight, with a summer quality."
"Pours a slightly cloudy straw gold. Moderate carbonation with a bubbley white head. It’s got a dry somewhat spicy aroma. Thinner body than I expected. Flavor is an interesting balance of spicy sweetness balanced by its dryness. very interesting spicey, slight liquorice herb flavor in the finish."
"O- Nice tripel overall... I'll definitely pick this one up again."
"I think this one needs a food pairing for myself than just drinking casually, but it's a tasty one I must admit and very different from most tripels I've had."
"Overall: I like it a lot, I don’t normally like tripels and I think they are one dimensional, but this version offered a lot of depth that you I don’t normally get from them."
"D - interesting and I like it but one good glass is enough at a sitting."
"Flavor is sweet fruity malt with white grapes and a little dry vinous notes on the finish. Also a little peppery alcohol on the swallow. Not an overly complex beer but no flaws, an good tripel, but Id love a little more complexity in the flavors."
"Overall: A good Tripel that's priced well in comparison to most Bruery offerings."
"This beer pours a honey gold in color with good cloudiness and a three finger spongy white head. It is light to medium in body. The murkyness of this beer is pretty impressive. It smells of basil, spices, light spicy yeast, grains, and cloves. It's an interesting mix. It tastes of spicy yeast, citrus fruits, sweet bready malts, light peach cobbler. The aftertaste left me thinking of peach shortbread which was quite nice. This beer takes you to different points of the spectrum. It's quite good and very enjoyable and easy to drink. After the previous beer I tried, this is a godsend. It drinks very crisp and fresh (having been delivered last week). This is an impressive Tripel and one worthy trying."
"Here's to another very good Bruery beer."
"Pours slightly hazy golden amber with thick, sticky white head that leaves lots of lacing. Nose reminds me of their Orchard White, lots of corriander-like notes and some dried wheat. Palate is crisp and spicy with herbal notes and drying carbonation. The yeast is dry and earthy instead of fruity. Green leaves like banana leaves and each over-ripe basil leaves. Finish is crisp with dried wheat notes. Great re-working of the style."
"The Bruery is really producing some great stuff... their seasonal Saison is among my favorites.. and this one is certainly worth a taste."
"Overall: I have to say that I was a tad disappointed with what was on the label versus what the flavor turned out to be. With that said, I like everything that I read about The Bruery, and I will definitely explore more of their brews."
"O: Definitely an interesting and unique tripel. Not bad but not coming close to my favorites in the style."
"glassware: tulip"
"O- Overall, I'm not a huge fan of tripels but this one was more enjoyable than most. Definitely worth a try especially if you enjoy the style."
"There's no doubt in my mind that I'll be coming back to this beer. I love the style, and The Bruery brued up a serious brue with this one. Good times."
"Poured a hazy medium orange with a huge white fizzy head that was mostly diminishing and had great lacing. The aroma was quite strong with the odor of a soapy yeast, a mild herbal hop and straw malts with a hint of fruitiness. It tasted mildly sweet and acidic from the start and had a strong yeasty finish which had a hint of spiciness and a little taste of citrus with the flavor lasting an average amount of time. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery yet dry in texture with a nice lively carbonation. Overall a very nice tasting tripel."
"Medium body, high carbonation, a bit dry on the palate. Pretty drinkable and decent flavor, especially since the 8.1% manages to stay out of the way. I'm not sure I'd go chasing this down or anything, but I definitely wouldn't mind having it again."
"Great match for thai food, I'm sure. Don't know, I had it with Chinese. Worked there, too. Excellent tripel. Is simply everything they make this good or better?"
"D: To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of this style, but I do like them on occasion. This was in the top 5 of the more interesting and unique ones I've ever tasted!"
"Another great Belgian-style beer from The Bruery. Very nice representation with some saison-like attributes as well."
"Drinkability: I picked this up on a whim; finished about 1/3 of a glass and then forgot about it / lost interest; dumped the rest in the AM"
"I like it. Basil is subtle but adds something. Good beer."
"D- Its not awful. Due to its mouthfeel I can drink the hell out of it. The clean finish doesn't allow too much exponential growth of frustration. It was worth ticking, but I wouldn't suggest this one out to any of my friends. Takes a bit of work to truly appreciate it for what it is."
"Aroma is strong and malty with a nice overtone of sweet fruit and hints of yeast and honey. It pours a nice clear golden yellow, typical but with a very thick, fluffy, persistent off-white head. Flavor is crisp, malty and a little fruity with a hint of yeast and a bit of an alcohol nip - not quite as complex as I expected, but still tasty. Texture is smooth, a little tingly, a teensy on the watery side but still decent. This is not the best tripel I've had, but it's worthy of at least a try."
"Overall a unique great refreshing beer that is packed full of flavor. This is a great fusion beer. It would go great with Thai food."
"If the finish had more character, it might venture into less drinkable. As it is it's not the most amazingly flavoured beer but is quite enjoyable for drinking."
"Only an average brew as far as I'm concerned. Misses the mark for the style, and the extra ""quirks"" added to it don't do enough to make it interesting."
"D - It's palatable and smooth. Bit of an aftertaste that deters. It's pretty drinkable though."
"Overall - Outstanding. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone. What a fun, outstanding, and complex beer to drink."
"Pours a clear amber with billowing white head that settles to a thick styrofoam cap, someone may have dropped an alkaseltzer in here too with all the bubbles streaming up. Smell: really lightly sweet pils malt, lightly spicy and aromatic (though can't pick out basil) with a little lemon. Taste: spicy, lightly lemony, mildly sweet base malt, mildly herbal. Watered down pear-apple juice in the finish. Would be light bodied but for the high carbonation. Interesting, I guess. Summer 2010 release."
"DB- Worth the price on tap but not at $20 a bottle. I like the herbal addition a lot but could see how some would not. Drinks easily and very flavorful."
"D: A very drinkable twist on a tripel."
"Shared a 750mL bottle of this at Animal restaurant in Los Angeles. Pours a cloudy orange with incredibly thick white head. Lots of lacing. I felt the need to take a picture of the glass while drinking. Smells quite spicy, but I had trouble trying to place what the spices were. Lots of Belgian yeasty aroma too. A bit prickly in the mouthfeel, but a nice tripel. Reminded me of a strong saison almost."
"Superb off-centre interpretation of the tripel - added to the style without detracting from it. Not sure how long the novelty would remain appealing, but definitely longer than one bottle, so I'll be back for more."
"Medium bodied, heavy carbonation, and the alcohol is pretty well hidden. Overall not a bad beer, but far from the best Tripel I have had."
"Oy, this is kind of a mess, in my opinion. Starts strong, pretty compelling, but almost so complex that it becomes unwieldy & turns into a juggling act, & the drinker can't help but drop the ball."
"D: Very drinkable; almost refreshing. Disguises the ample abv well."
"Smooth and extra-creamy mouthfeel is what strikes me first on this beer. Tropical fruits with an herbal accent on the flavor with a stiff bitterness and alcohol drying. Body is substantial and big for a tripel. Fruit levels take on the best from Belgium, impressive. Very nice brew, might be my favorite that I have had so far from The Bruery."
"Poured a golden yellow with slight yellow highlights and had a finger of white fluffy head but it did leave some bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was of belgian yeast, herbs, spices, faint basil, slight citrus, and clove character. The flavor was pretty similar to the nose which was herbs and spice for sure alongside the belgian yeast strain, very slight citrus, but it also had the clove type notes on the palate as well. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a spice, herby, sweet, and slight grainy finish. It drank very well and was tasty out of the bottle and on tap but IMO it was leaning towards more of an experimental tripel; still tasty."
"This is quite drinkable and refreshing. I could imagine having this with some lemon pepper chicken, wild rice, and asparagus."
"Pours a light golden color with a nice white head and a pretty good amount of lacing. The nose brings forward citrus, herbs, and a good amount of basil. Maybe I wouldn't have noticed it as much without the note on the label, but it is definitely quite prevalent. The taste brings some light citrus, fruit, and basil. Nice clean and crisp mouthfeel with good carbonation. Really unique and drinks quite well."
"This is by far the most drinkable tripel I have ever had, probably thanks to the rice used in the recipe. It is far from a classic example, but truth be told I am not a huge tripel fan so I really enjoyed their departure from the norm."
"The 1st pour was all head and took a while to dissipate. Hazy yellow color (I'd been afraid it might be green, hah). Bouquet and flavor are very rich and complex. Sure there's a slight hint of basil but it's subtle. What I think their addition to the brewing really achieves is a sort of oppulent and rich mouthfeel not unlike that flavor pop you get from a bite of good pesto. It's sweet, it's satisfying, it's a beer that demands your attention with every sip and could stand up to and accompany a bold flavored meal."
"Like most tripels, it's one to take slowly, but also one that is about as balanced and welcoming as any tripel I've ever had. Wowee...or should I say: ""Choc-tee!"""
"Overall impression: crisp yet soft, but tastes more like a saison. a one-timer for sure."
"D: A fairly approachable and inventive rendition of a challenging style that rarely steps out of its traditional boundaries. Tripels are most impressive in the company of complex food flavors--usually ready to stand in for a range of acidic and spicy wine varietals--and this seasonal offering from The Bruery will fulfill this role admirably. Furthermore, between the bottle style, traditional service in stemmed glassware, and the featured flavor of basil, this beer represents a powerful mind-changing tool to share with those individuals that think they have already made up their minds about beer."
"D - Smooth yet initially crisp the great foamy head, uniquely herbal aromas, and nice flavor makes this a really solid tripel from The Bruery. Really starting to enjoy this brewery."
"Poured from a 25 oz bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. Huge head to start with, I poured a little too aggressively. With my second normal pour about 3 fingers of light spongey head. Very nice golden cloudy color. Smell is quite interesting. The normal belgian yeast, and then an overpowering herbacious quality, definitely that thai basil coming through. Spicy and light citrus. Warm flavors, very herbal, lightly sweet and spicy. Having a hard time knocking out the whole bottle. Very creamy mouthfeel."
"This tripel is, as I said, one of the best. A little on the sour side, but great!"
"Poured into a La Chouffe tulip glass with a nice golden color and a ton of head. The head eventually settle down to leave about a quarter inch. Smell was like a normal tripel with the addition of Thai basil - nice. Mix of a spicy and sweet taste with the basil showing through. The carbonation is strong and body is as I'd expect from a tripel. Drinking the whole 750ml was probably a little much, but overall easy to drink for the 8%."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a very tightly beaded white head that with a hard pour is a good 4 inches to begin, but settles down to a nice cap. Lacks sweetness in the nose, in fact, it smells somewhat savory. I'm not a fan of hugely sweet tripels, but this a tad too far in the other direction in the nose. Smells slightly salty and herbal, and almost like a Canadian (unsmoked) bacon. The taste is a little light and also herbal, but finishes with some decent sweetness without pushing the boundaries. Smooth, but a little seltzery. Fairly tasty, and the alcohol is well hidden, but this could have more body and a little more oomph."
"D - pretty nice, good work."
"The finish is clean, sweet, and just a little ricey. This is an awesome tripel that only needs a little doctoring on the appearance to be one of the best!"
"Thin to medium bodies, prominent basil flavor. Not too sweet and"
"Price = $10.00 at Whole Foods (Bowery)"
"This is a nice beer, but somewhat weird by itself with the Thai Basil. I would be very interested in trying to pair it with a nice dinner or cooking with it."
"Pretty good beer. Poured with a large off white, foamy, frothy, thick head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is yeast, malt, grain, fermented fresh cut grass. Flavor's like that, but sweetness & caramel comes out and is tempered with some bitterness. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and slowly tapers with a bit of metallic tinge over medium length. Proly not a session, maybe one or two depending on mood and what else is available."
"Autumn Maple, 10% abv"
"You need a super-controlled pour or 2/3 of the glass will get filled with ultra-fine foam that takes close to forever to dissipate down towards the surface, truly hard to imagine it more delicate without blowing away in a soft breeze, pure white, some stick to the lacing, more blotches than streaks. Very soft haze to the zinc orange color, more yellow than copper or red, transparent but not perfectly clear. The nose has a tight core of orange, lemon citrus all spiced up by ginger, coriander scents as well as basil, lemongrass herbs and such, the maltiness shifts around in the shadows but is there to lend smoothness to the texture, some almond sliver like nuttiness, has lift and enough ""off center"" feel to keep you intrigued. Medium-bodied plus, the carbonation soft and fluffy and spreads it all around the mouth, gently works the flavors into your mouth pores. Coriander, ginger root, tumeric and then sweet and sour blood orange, lemon citrus, has more of a grassy streak than garden herbs, albeit the basil easy to discern, Apricot, peach, pear, cantaloupe fruit accessible, ripe without being too juicy. Slight metallic ring to it as well but not sour nor offputting. Familiar yet unique, a highly desirable trait in high end craft beers."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this Belgian at American Craft in Brookline, MA while it was on tap. Great marks all around for this brew. Arriving in front of me with a rich gold color and thin white head, the scent was an enticing blend of spices. With my first sip I loved the clove-like, smooth flavor and feel. It mellowed into a second flavor that was much more citrusy and lasted freshly for quite a while after. It was very smooth, refreshing summer evening drink that greatly complimented my burger with gorgonzola."
"Not a huge fans of Tripels, but this was well done. The rice lighten up the body and the basial gave the beer nice aromas and flavor. Typical Belgian yeast aromas. Nice beer and went over nicely with everyone."
"M- Soft and smooth. Carbonation actually could use a tiny boost. I think it would help the refreshment here. Still, this is a very nice, crisp and interesting tripel. A perfect Belgian for the summer."
"D - Pretty tasty. Not the best tripel I've had, but not the worst."
"The mouthfeel is isn't anything special and the body is perfect for the style making this a relatively good drinkable tripel."
"Poured this one into a tulip. The pour is a nice deep golden color with slight visible carbonation. This has a huge head fluffy white head! The initial pour is about two thirds of the glass. Looking nice with sticky lacing on the side. Smells like garden herbs and orange zest. The smell is deep and rich with a hint of spiciness to go along with it. The taste is slightly spicy on the finish with a full flavor of basil and citrus zest. Finishes with a spicy and slightly sweet. Enjoyable medium bodied beer with nice subtle carbonation and good flavors. A little bit of alcohol heat is felt, but this is really nice drinking."
"D: Not your typical tripel, but still eminently drinkable."
"D - This is a very interesting take on a Tripel and a beer that is perfect for summer. I'm pairing it with some chicken pad thai, which, needless to say, goes well."
"Quite an interesting beer and I think it's the first I've had that's used basil. My biggest complaint is that it came off as a little too sweet for what I prefer in a Tripel. It would be great to pair with food as the basil is apparent but never overwhelming. I probably enjoyed it a bit more than my review indicates."
"D: Even though the mouthfeel is lacking, this beer is still refreshing."
"On-tap last week at Flying Saucer and reviewed from notes. Served in a tulip glass a slightly hazy orange with a decent head that diminishes to a ring and leaves only a trace of lacing on the glass. The aroma is Belgian spice in front of sweet fruit. The taste is a nice amount of sweet malts with a bit of fruit and spice, but not as much as I remember from the bottle I had earlier. The beer is a bit heavy, but still enjoyable on a hot summer afternoon. This is an enjoyable beer, even on-tap."
"First off there is alot about this beer I like, and some things I don't. It looks nice in the glass with a billowy white dense head and a small amount of lacing, golden wheat looking color and hazy. Smells like a good combo of tasty belgian yeast, candi sugar and yes thai basil. I happen to like thai basil alot and think it melds really well with the yeasty fruity estery aroma. Tastes like a standard triple, a little bit more hoppy though. The finish is, eh....kinda ricy and not so tasty. Mouthfeel is sorta sharp, doesn't have the same creamyness that traditional triples rock. I'm happy to sip this slowly once our twice a summer. An interesting beer to be enjoyed, but not visited too often."
"Interesting brew. would like this one on tap at the brewery."
"D: The beer is not too difficult to drink because the alcohol is well masked. I would definitely try it again given its unique flavors and the use of basil."
"Another nice beer from the Bruery. kind of outside what I think of from the trappist and abbey tripels of Belgium but a good take on the style. I will definitely have another."
"Definitely a nice brew - I could do with a little less of the banana, though."
"Does not taste like 8.1, deceptively smooth."
"D - well, not a Triple...really reminds me (I'd have trouble picking one out blindly) of Saison Du Buff. OK enough for a small serving but not much more."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a DFH goblet, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a couple inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is sweet and spicy, it smells like herbs (I assume that's the Thai Basil), peppery spice, bready malt, tropical fruit and some citrus. It tastes like herbs/basil, sweet malt, peppery spice and lemon peel. The herbal and spice flavors are stronger in the taste, compared to the aroma which I thought was fruitier. There's also a weird bitter herbal-like finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit dry and also has a lot of carbonation. Drinkability isn't bad, but there was too much carbonation in this beer for me. I thought this was a decent enough brew, I'd try it again in the future."
"To prove The Bruery's point, i actually had a grain of rice in my beer tonight. A single grain was floating on top when i received the beverage. The rice mash proved to work well with the strong basil & citrus flavors. This is definitely something I would drink if it were around my neck of the woods more often."
"This is like a cross between a Tripel and a Saison. This beer is as unique as any Belgian. The aroma and appearance are worth the price of admission alone."
"drinkability: strong"
"Another winner from the Bruery."
"D: This had very nicely blended flavors and hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink and enjoy. Not the most delicious tripel ever, but interesting to try with it's own unique twist of the style."
"This must be one of the best beers ever to be made with grains of rice. It is full of character and complexity. Best enjoyed cold though, I'm afraid."
"The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with above average carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's an interesting beer for sure but not something I would drink often or order another of anytime soon. I like the experimentation and interesting combination though. Basil and rice just might not make my list of favorite beer ingredients."
"Smell is spicy from the basil. A little different for a trip. Taste is good. Slight bitterness hits first, the basil hits next. It's definitely different for a tripel. No sweetness to really detect. Spices linger on the palate. Mouthfeel is alright. The spices are a little too strong in the mouth. Drinkability is good."
"This is a dry, crisp take on the tripel style. I applaud using the traditional tripel style and taking that in a new direction, and one that I think can be particularly good paired with food. Overall, it tastes like a witbier/tripel hybrid. I am getting that tongue-numbing coriander sensation from a witbier, as well as the traditional elements of a tripel."
"Drinkability is good. No alcohol can be detected in the smell or taste. Interesting, unique beer."
"Overall, its drinkable but not really worth searching out."
"Not a bad beverage. Pretty solid beverage. Would be nice on a hot day, but not blowing me away or anything."
"very nice brew"
"Beer is sweet and slightly dry, finishes oddly bitter with a hint of basil in the mid and late palate. The spice flavors linger at the end of the beer. Pretty creamy and smooth on the palate, overall a very nice beer."
"D - A good tripel to be sure, the Thai basin adds a delicious and unique aroma and flavor to an already awesome beer style."
"Well done -"
"D - On the sweet, spicy side but very nice. Another interesting beer from the Bruery."
"While the draft version of this beer is good enough, on cask it's just a beauty. Lovely beer...."
"The palate opens spicier, fuller and less tropical, more citrus and unfortunately, fuller in body. Sweeter than the tap version, especially on the finish. Lower in carbonation, this is decent, I definitely prefer this on tap."
"I've yet to have a bad brew from the Breuery and this is another one that I'd definitely drink again."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Not your standard Tripel but it really grew on me over time and I plan on having it more often. At first I would have given this beer a b or b- but as it warmed I think I would rate it as a B+."
"go for it if you find one in local shelf"
"Poured hazy yellow color with a huge frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy complex spicy citrus and yeasty aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and lively carbonation. Medium citrus sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. This is a good beer."
"D: A good, but different, tripel. A solid Bruery beer for sure."
"Mouthfeel is a touch thin for me, but i could drink plenty of these. Maybe not the greastest tripel, but a damn interesting one."
"D - An interesting and very nice Tripel. Worth trying."
"D - It really liked this beer. It was one of the most unique tasting brews that I've had."
"Overall Impression: I was unsure how this beer would be, considering the additions of Rice and Thai Basil, but I should be used to it by now with this brewery; they always seem to come up with interesting interpretations of classic styles, and this was no exception. I loved this beer!!! It was sweet, fruity and incredibly flavorful. Yet another winner from The Bruery!"
"Blondish coloration with crisp, but not rocky head. Subsides soon. Smell is of isoamyl acetate, some alcohol, a peppery (possibly from the basil?) funk. Taste is similar with candi sugar at the end, but doesn't hold up. The mouthfeel is a little thin and as some have mentioned, the carbonation is fairly intense and takes away from the taste unless you make an effort to destroy it. If this were a more concentrated brew, it would be more pleasing to me."
"Pours a hazy strawberry blonde, with about a finger and a half of luxurious head that settles quickly into the ever-rising field of effervescence from the bottom. The aroma is interesting, with tones of hops, grains, pepper, and even a bit of vanilla at the beck end of the nose. The taste is not as interesting, with the pepper and vanilla completely disappearing beneath a sea of hoppy grains and faint banana tones. Unfortunately, the taste is not able to linger very long on the tongue, instead being forced therefrom by the overactive carbonation and incredibly light body (I blame the rice). All said, this guy would probably seem better if the flavor were allowed to settle longer on the tongue, but he's still not all that bad."
"I really appreciate the effort and innovation here (like I do with most of the efforts from the Bruery) but this one seemed to overdo it just a bit. The mix of sweetness, fruit, and spice, gave this a strong tang that was a little overwhelming at times (and I even split this bottle with a buddy). I'm glad I gave it a try but I don't necessarily see myself buying a bottle again anytime soon."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head tulip, formed a 1 1/2"" off-white head over the clear coppery amber brew. Head continues to rise, sno-coning above the rim, but the vigorous bubbling finally abates somewhat, with tons of chunky lacing. Aroma is sweet and lightly spicy. Taste is sweet upfront, spicy yeasts in the middle, and a tea-like flavor at the close with some light warming. Mouthfeel is smooth, very clean, and drinkability is excellent. Very nice brew."
"picked up awhile back at Whole Foods, Fairfax"
"Overall this Belgian Tripel is quite unique, but its flavors tend to be a little too extreme for the style as the Thai Basil is quite aggressive. Certainly enjoyable in small quantities. Worth a Look."
"D: Excellent drinkability. I wasn't quite sure what to make of the extra ingredients but we were pleasantly surprised."
"3.5 D: Definitely a good drink, but I'll pass most of the time for a cheaper or better option."
"D - A tasty take on the traditional tripel w/ basil and rice giving the kind of herbal and spice w/ yeast adding a seriously fresh and tropical kind of drinkability -Kudos to the Bruery!"
"pours a huge head and a very turbid medium dark orange (light touches of brown) body. head is off white. head retention is swell. the nose is quite potent: sweet apples, a definite rice starchiness. nose is quite nice, I really like it. Cant taste the thai basil, but things start going down hill from here. the taste is just 'not right', shall we say, the initial is a bit too boozy, a real strong ethanol like flavour. its also just missing some of the regular sweet and tasty punch that a good trappiste tripel would have. the basil does, however, show up in the finish (an interesting touch). weird aftertaste of booze and baguette crumbs. the feel is a bit too thick, and the over all taste is not something that I would want for a long night drinking session tripel."
"Still, there is something slightly off-putting about this beer. It's drinkable enough, but I'm not sure I'll make it a ""regular."""
"Soft, effervescent, filling body. Slowly warming from the alcohol. Great with a meal, to share, or as a night-cap (maybe even more than Slaapmutske?)."
"Quite interesting - I'd be happy to try this again, as it is complex enough I am not sure I really got it all in this tasting. I had this on-tap at Shorty's in mid-town Manhattan."
"Drinkability: this beer is bold and flavorful, and despite the high alcohol level it goes down quickly. Worth giving this one a try."
"d: interesting tripel, but 750 ml is more than enough. go with la fin du monde every time."
"75cl bottle. Hazy dark gold-orange color with a big lasting white head. The aroma has sweet candy sugariness, spiciness (Thai basil?), and fruity yeast character that is somewhat reminiscent of kumquats and cantaloupe. The flavor is interesting but honestly a bit on the messy side; too much spicing and too candy-sweet in the finish. The basil seems to add a cool quality but might go a bit to far in the balance. Medium bodied, but sticky and watery in texture at the same time. I thought the all-brett version was much better."
"An interesting, spicy twist to the style with the addition of basil. A Belgian-style with an Asian flair. Interesting, and a fine pairing with spicier Asian food."
"Okay, it's brewed with rice, so I thought it would pair well with the heavy meal of the evening which was a creamy asparagus pasta dish. And I was right. Yay me. The rice gives it a very light texture and color for a tripel. However, you don't get that heavy fruit flavor from a traditional tripel, and I have to admit, I kind of missed it. Don't get me wrong, I found Trade Winds to be pretty tasty, especially when it starts to warm up and you get that basil in your mouth and then you start smacking your lips, trying to suck the delicious from the inside of your cheek. Then you go, ""Okay, I see what you did there."" I wasn't impressed, but it was tasty. And the rice brew with that fresh herbal nose is certainly a different side of beer. So, I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting beer, but I'm not raving about it."
"It's light, it's dry...but there is a little latent weight and heft on this from the 8.1% ABV quotient. It's an excellent beer, no doubt. But maybe a 750 is a bicycle built for two."
"D: Very good drinkability as well enjoyment. Goes down nicely as a summer time quencher with a light body and tropical juice like flavor that is sure to hit the spot. Not your typical Belgian style tripel but a smooth and fruity lighter interpretation that is highly drinkable with a manageable 8.1% abv."
"Just had this a few weeks back at the Gotham Cask Festival. Poured a hazy gold, with less than a finger of bright white head, and poor lacing. The smell yielded banana, lemon, bubble gum, clove, coriander, hay, and yeast. The taste confirmed this, with the fruit flavors hitting big at first, and the spices lingering throughout and into the aftertaste. Fairly well-hidden alcohol. Very thin mouthfeel, and not as spritzy as one would come to expect from a tripel, but the cask likely had a lot to do with this. If not for the alcohol content, this would session well."
"When you first take a sip, Trade Winds is surprisingly bold, sweet and fruity, a little bready, lots of yeast flavor with tones of banana and apricot. There's also a bit of clove spice, particularly on the end. I have to say I was hesitant about a golden ale with basil in it -- for all I knew, this beer was going to taste like pesto. But it's surprisingly pleasant and drinkable."
"There are so many great things happening here, but it falls short of perfect. If nothing else, The Bruery's beers never fail to be unique. I can definitely recommend this one."
"D: Good. I do want another and would buy again."
"As far as an American brewed version of a Belgian style goes this is pretty well done. Still, there are better options out there for the same or less money. I would be happy to try other things from this brewery based on this beer."
"I was recommended this beer by a Whole Foods employee/friend of mine who had nothing but rave reviews. Since he likes his women, I'd make this analogy: I wouldn't throw this beer out of bed, but it would be low on the list of my booty calls."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding! It has a wonderful citrus and farmhouse funk laid over a grist of pale malts. It's got excellent spice character as well. The taste is awesome as well. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a shitload of Belgian yeast esters and a peppery spiciness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with maybe a touch too much CO2. This is a really nice beer with many layers of complexity. Well done!"
"this beer pours a golden color with just a hint of amber the slightly off white head builds up to a towering rocky pinth. the aroma immediatley shows off the yeasts belgian pedigree, with the requisite banana clove esters and spice. the taste follows with the an array of lemon and spice... the thai basil brings a lot of spice to the dry finish. the medium body and high carbonation make the mouthfeel really nice on an all around good beer."
"The main ingredient I'm pulling from this beer is the Thai basil, which is actually nicely balanced against the other spice flavors. There really aren't other flavor, just a typical light bready malt followed by a punch of crushed black pepper, lemongrass, and mild cinnamon with the basil. If you like your tripels spicy, check this beer out."
"Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, medium bodied, and warming."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a golden honey color with dense off white head that dissipated into a puffy cap. The aroma is sweet and zesty. Aromas of apples, banana and lemon are mixed with some spicy yeast scents. Some barnhouse funk give this brew a musty earthy smell. The taste is of apple skins and lemon. There is some banana, clover, pepper, light coriander and horse blanket from the yeast. There is a tin like grain flavor as well, perhaps from the rice that is added. The feel is very fizzy, the carbonation burns a bit. Nice balance of sweet and spicy. A well made tripel, nice flavor."
"I thought this was a good Tripel. The spiciness was strong, but I thought it was a net positive."
"Overall, style wise this beer reminds me very much of many Saisons I have had, especially Saisons that have spice additions for flavoring. Hard to tell if the yeast played a huge role in the flavor profile or worked in conjunction with the Thai Basil addition. Either way it is a really delicious and worth seeking out beer. I might hesitate to call it a Tripel, and in BJCP land might argue it is out of style, but as a beer of Belgian style it is completely fantastic."
"A capped 750ml bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $10. Opened and poured into my oerbier tulip-like glass. The tripel appears a cloudy golden apricot color with a healthy looking two fingers of pillowy bone white foam. The aromas and flavors are dominated by notes of quite spicy yeast, black pepper, mint, lime, licorice. Rather crisp and bone dry with a bit too much carbonation. Getting a bit of alcohol as it warms. Very bubbly, and that distracts from the drink-ability of an otherwise well done tripel with a unique twist."
"what a nice brew. hazy dark golden straw color with a cream color head that fizzes a million bubbles a minute while rising and then settles down to a thin web. nose is minty, earthy, herbal basil as well as green apple bubblegum, orange gatorade, banana and a whole host of spicy scents that are typical of belgian yeast strains and asian cuisine. clove, white pepper, cardamom, corriander, cumin. they say basil and rice are the only ingredients besides the usual suspects, so the yeast strain must be particularly spicy. light medium body with what seems to be relatively low carbonation, but the beer explodes in the mouth, creating a refreshing, spritziness. great effort. outstanding representation of what we can do here in america. i'd like another please."
"Belgian style bomber bottle, I like the oversized cap. Pours glowing apricot, with lots of bubbles rising and lifting an initially huge off white head, that sticks around forever and slowly turns to merainge. Then leaves nice strands of lace and a much better then average collar of the thick stuff. It emits a hearty sniff of mint, pepper and Belgian leaning yeast. Quite enjoyable and tasty take on a favorite style. Phenolic and minty, with additional notes of honey, pepper, and even the advertized thai basil lending a complexity enhancing addition to the mix. Drys out nicely in the finish. 8% nowhere to be found.Well done, refreshing and intriguing. I really enjoyed this one. Go get some and enjoy a finely crafted American take on a classic style."
"I love the mouthfeel on this, it was very crisp and light, since they did away with all the sugars, so I found it quite refreshing on a hot summer day."
"This is a seasonal offering from The Bruery and the third beer from them, that I have had the opportunity to drink. The appearance is a light golden color with a giant head, that with time turns into a thin lace cover. Smell is boozy, with some spices, however it is difficult to pinpoint individual flavors. Taking a few sips allows for a better understanding of Trade Winds. It is a sugary beer with pear and bananas being present from the citrus aspect and a small amount of hops seems to be here as well. This beer goes well with a laid back evening listening to some music or watching a movie. One bottle shared with a friend or perhaps yourself will be all that you will need."
"On tap at The Ginger Man. Pours orange with a thick white head. Aroma of spices immediately and sweet fruits. Flavor of bready malt, sweet melon, bitter spices. An interesting tripel--the rice worked well with this beer. Light, sweet, and very drinkable. Overall a nice beer."
"D: Excellent flavors make me want to come back, but the ABV and the 750ml size definitely limit me to one bottle, if not half shared with a friend."
"Overall, I really need to try this in bottle form as the cask just didn't work out. This was just not great stuff on cask, and it's a shame b/c I'm a huge fan of the Bruery overall."
"Pours neutral colour with some head. Salad dressing aroma,such as oregeno and that's what's delivered. Taste: Sundried tomatoes, olive oil and olives, and some rice, and some other spices. Above average mouthfeel. Its drinkable, but not to much, and would not seek it out again."
"Poured into a chalice a golden light orange color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger plus foamy white head, with some very nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a good dose of yeast, some nice bannana, clove notes. The taste is sweet, malty, with a nice yeast note, slightly spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty Tripel, recommended."
"Very drinkable even with the higher abv. A couple of these will really sneak up on you. A great way to unwind after a baseball game on a hot day."
"They've definitely succeeded in their east meets west endeavor and I have to say I'm impressed with their ambition. However, this one has a hard time standing up to The Bruery's other outstanding offerings."
"Pours a lovely hazy golden, even the gentlest pour yields a great pillowey head reminiscent of Duvel. Great lacing and retention, a treat to behold. Smell is not so hot, kind of a metallic ""flavor"" on the nose, like a wheaty yeasty harshness. Not sure where it comes from, maybe the house yeast? Don't get it on the tongue, though. A little sweeter and fuller than a typical tripel, not quite as dry. But the rice and basil really impart an interesting flavor, lightening it up, slightly spicing it. Definitely unique, the tastes billow on my palate and linger. Very easy to put a bottle away of this. Taste is prolly somewhere between 4.0 and 4.5. Most excellent."
"Overall this is a solid tripel but the flavors don't seem to meld as well as they do in the best examples. Still, it's well worth a shot."
"D: Personally, I did not find this beer all that enjoyable. However, if you are into the flavors that are present in this beer, I'm sure that you would find it very nice."
"Very nice pour into the Tulip, dark honeyed gold with a nice off white malted milk head. Great retention, wonderful lacing, easily coaxed back up with a gentle swirl. Sweet, yeasty aromas, slightly medicinally herbed with the basil. This intensifies as the beer warms. Sweet, but never cloying, and the basil adds an unexpected and playful kick. Alcohol is well masked. Mouthfeel is very smooth, coating and lingering on the tongue. Drinkablity slides downward as the beer warms. Everything about the taste and smell intensifies. One bottle goes down without a catch, but finishing a second might be a chore. Another home run from the excellent Bruery."
"A unique Triple, tastes an looks somewhat like a Double, but maybe a little lighter and sweeter. Probably resides between the two, maybe a One and a Halfer? Recommended."
"Think I'm going to have to pass on this one the next time I see it."
"The body is golden in color with a fluffy white head. Herbal and tea-like qualities permeate the aroma. Some notes of lemon too. Flavor is lemon, honey, and fresh herbs. As in the aroma, there are tea notes here too along with some peppery spice qualities. I didn't really get basil or rice, but I did enjoy it. Spice flavors would go great with food."

"D: One of the most drinkable examples of the style that I have ever had. Went down very nicely and paired well with a variety of food."
"I like the fact that The Bruery brews outside the box and usually pulls it off. If they ever figure out how to carbonate, look out! Trade Winds Tripel is a damn good beer that isn't too far removed from greatness. Especially when compared to most American versions of my favorite Belgian style."
"Drinkability is exemplary for the style. Lighter than expected, very flavorful, crisp and perfect for summer."
"D- Highly drinkable for a beer with so much flavor and a fairly high alcohol content."
"Poured a cloudy orange-gold with a huge rocky white head that stuck around. Good lacing. Tropical fruit aroma with cider, some banana, and basil. Very carbonated, lighter mouthfeel. Big, bold fruity taste. Lots of apricots, peaches, strawberry, mango, passionfruit, and a melange of tropical fruit. Herbal background which is very sweet, presumably from the rice. Slightly sour bite in the finish, more tart fruit. The flavor was so big, it made the beer less drinkable, though. Its not necessarily a bad thing, but when it comes to trippels, I didn't expect such a big beer. Definitely find a friend to share the bottle with."
"M: medium bodied. Big carbonation level. Crisp and smooth for the style."
"Failry tasty and interesting to try but would not be an everyday beer for me."
"Big ups to BA/RB'r WeeHeavySD for a kickass bonus brew!"
"Pours hazy, yellow in color with a large, lively head. Yeasty aroma. There is something off-putting about it. I can put my finger on it. I keep thinking it's rice - the more I smell the more the aroma seems to be a blend of Belgian and light lager. There is some bitterness in the taste. This beer seems a little unbalanced. It attacks you with high carbonation (too high in my opinion) and high alcohol (the label says 8.1%). I am not very well versed in the land of tripels, but this one is not what I am expecting. I am not sorry I have picked up this bottle, but I probably won't reach for it again any time soon."
"750 ml bottle purchased at Beverage Warehouse in Marina Del Rey for ten dollars, consumed 12/22/09, reviewed from notes, poured into my Duvel tulip glass, color is a cloudy yellow with some darker tones, 3/4 inch white foamy head that lasts around five minutes, nice retention, minimal lacing, aroma consists of bananas, sugar, rice, cornmeal, sweet malt, bread, esters, and various spices, flavor starts off with a light fruit presence, then bread mixed with some sugars and what seems to be the basil component, lots of spice and a hint of booze in the finish, warms up and causes more fruit to come out, by the end there is apples, prunes, lemon, and honey, gave my tastebuds a whirl, mouthfeel is sweet and sometimes chewy, medium bodied, pretty high level of carbonation, taste lingers a long time, could drink a bottle of it, not too heavy, alcohol could be hidden more for being under eight percent, still pretty easy to drink considering its off the wall ingredients, another fine seasonal from Patrick, I like how adventurous this brew is, look forward to seeing how a few months of age affects it, recommended"
"a really smooth and intriguing beer. lots of different flavors that meld extremely well together. There is a lot going on, but everything is just at the right level, great body, balance, spices, and flavors"
"The body is hard to pick out with such a high carbonation bite. More moderate feel. Overall, the carbonation is just offsetting and really distracts from the nose, taste and feel. Beyond that though, there are some nice saison notes but really lacking the triple notes."
"Drinkability: The beer flirts between a high degree of carbonation and Alka-Seltzer straight in the mouth carbonation. Still though, it's fairly tasty and a fine use of non-traditional tripel ingredients."
"Bottle: Poured a deep golden color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some candi sugar traces and a nice spicy yeast with some subtle alcohol ester. Taste is a nice mix between some candi sugar and some peppery yeast and some light alcohol traces. Full body with great carbonation. I must admit to having been really surprise by how well this beer was drinking and apart from a lack of fruity ester I thought it was a great realization."
"D: Good, solid representation of the style."
"Most amazing beer appearance in a long time. Golden color with awesome retention and the head stays firm and creamy. The surface of the head is cratered like the surface of the moon, very interesting. Floral, but also very earthy in the nose and some sort of spice (apparently basil). Taste has a creaminess to it, but still manages to be dry in the finish. Almost vanilla-like in the taste, with a bit of Cool-Whip, bits of grain, and a long, earthy taste. High carbonation and medium body. If not for a little bit of a metallic taste, I'd bump the taste score up another notch. Pretty good Tripel, and nice to have an American one that is nice and relatively dry."
"Pours a cloudy light orange/amber, huge and fluffy white head forms, drops some chunks of lace and settles to a medium sized collar, great retention, head really sticks around. Smell is nice, sweet and sugary, some yeast, honey, alcohol, slightly metallic, spices, caramel, basil, a bit soapy, but real neat. Taste is similar, quite sweet up front, caramel and candi sugar, basil, bitter spiciness, alcohol, wheat, light funky, apricots, great stuff, basil really gives it a neat character. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, very neat character. Great tripel, think I have a bottle in the cellar. Thanks Russ!"
"The Bruery keeps impressing me. Kudos to Patrick for taking a common style and putting a unique twist on it."
"This one was quite hazy, sort of cloudy and a peach/orange colour. It had a giant, fluffy, eggshell cap that left clumpy lace on the glass. The aroma was quite spicy, floral and lemongrass, ripe fruits, white bread, just a hint of basil too. Mild bitterness with plenty of bread and ripe fruit, citrus, herbal notes with a bit of basil here as well. Medium bodied with medium high, slightly sharp carbonation. Light warmth and off-dry. Solid stuff, quite drinkable."
"Drinkability- If you can remember to sit on the beer for about 20 minutes after you take it out of the fridge, you should be in for a treat."
"drinkability is good. i think the high carbonation detracts a little, but otherwise it is well balanced and very good. i good example of the style with an exciting little complimentary twist from the rice+basil. i think this one was even better when i had it fresh from the brewery, so i don't think i'd bother aging this one and enjoy it fresh."
"Drinkability is pretty good - the smell is amazing, and the taste is pretty good as well, which off-set the thick mouthfeel. There is a lingering heat from my tongue to my belly which, combined with the heavy body, would have had me guess that it's a good bit stronger then 7.5%, in-spite of the alcohol taste and smell being very clean and well integrated."
"Medium bodied and smooth with plenty of carbonation that works for the beer and the style. Overall, an interesting twist on the tripel. I was expecting a little more ""wow"" factor in the flavor, but other than that it was a solid drink."
"On tap at the brewery for the AHA rally. Golden color with a white head. Malty aroma, a little alcohol, and the Thai basil comes through a little. Malty, but not sweet, very clean. The basil makes it interesting compared to traditional Tripels. High carbonation, to style and a dry finish. A very unique twist on a classic."
"Very Belgian appearance with a large head above a bright orange body. Spicing and fruit in the nose, with butter and popcorn as well. Flavor seems very incomplete and very sweet and it's just absolutely loaded with diacetyl. Has some nice elements to it, but sucks overall."
"Drinkability is good. I did finish the whole bottle by myself over dinner and did not get that overly buzzed feeling. Nice beer that would be really great on a summer evening."
"750ml bottle courtesy of Mauerhan (thanks Topher). Served in my Chimay chalice. Poured a murky orange-gold with a two-inch frothy white head that sizzled and popped as it gradually receded into a solid cap. Some wispy strands of lacing circled the perimeter of the glass. Nose yielded scents of yeast, candi sugar, spice and orange peel. Taste consistent with nose with a little booze and a buttery flavor at the finish. Mouthfeel is light with a lively effervescence consistent throughout and a mild burn and astringent quality present at the finish."
"The initial aroma turned me off a bit, but as it warmed that off-smell went away, and as I got well into my glass I really found this wearing on me. Very complex and tasty. Not as sweet as some tripels, and on the dry side, but a very fine beer. This is a definite winner, and the best of The Bruery beers I've had so far. Pick it up."
"The first Bruery beer I've had (Black Orchard and Saison Rue) that I've thought was pretty tasty. A good solid, albeit sweet, brew that's worth trying if you see it"
"Overall this was a very nice, light triple. Not the big heavy, alcohol laden ones you see around at times, this was much more of a session worthy ale. I would have no issue with trying this one again, the price is a little biit high, only because of logistics, but if this were local I would have no issue in endulging."
"Pours an orange gold with a big ass two finger white head that remains for quite a while. A thick layer of lacing remains on the sides of the glass with a continuous explosion of bubbles rising to the top. Smell consists of rice, corn, and basil. Some candy sugar, yeast, and clove tickle the nose. A faint peppery aroma in the backbone as well. Taste begins pretty sweet with banana, pear, and apple. Midway the bland rice flavors emerge with a sprinkle of pepper and honey. Aftertaste is pretty warm from the alcohol sting with clove and spice and slightly dry. I'm torn on the mouthfeel of this beer. It's very light and fluffy but the carbonation is a bit much and harsh at times. This is a pretty unique twist on a classic style, and if it wasn't for the aggressive carbonation this would definitely be getting a higher score."
"Interesting assemblage from The Bruery. Doing something like adding Thai Basil and rice to a classic style like this is living on the edge, and most times when I taste experimental stuff like that it's barely palatable. I think the Bruery has pulled this off though, that's craftsmanship on full display. It's not my favorite beer in the world but it is interesting and new and something that will invite repeat tastings rather than a ""Ok, been there done that, next!"" type response."
"It's always a pleasure for me to drink my favorite Belgian style of beer. Even better to have it uniquely flavored with Asian spices unlike other tripels. But best would be parading in the streets of Pattaya with a Thai woman in one hand and a Trade Winds Tripel in the other."
"Bottom line: This is my first sampling from The Bruery and well, I'm not very fond of this Tripel and I'm a big fan of well made Tripels. A step in the right direction would be to cut down on the carbonation. That's the one factor in this brew that really made it tough to drink never mind enjoy."
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs, Imperial Beach CA"
"D: Another tasty beer from the Bruery, aside from the carbonation problems, I thought it was quite good. The basil concept was interesting and I really liked the flavour. It made an interesting match to some ginger cookies I was eating."
"Will look for."
"On tap at The Bruery. Had a couple tasters, then a full glass. Classic cloudy golden with a big foamy head. The aroma isn't as much the standard huge Belgian earthiness you usually get, though it does have some of that. It's really more fruity, sugary, sweet. The taste is very light, with only mild earthiness but mostly light fruits such as apples, pears etc. Mouthfeel was on the lighter side, but I have no problem with that, it's an easy tripel to drink."
