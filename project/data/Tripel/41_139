The beer is quite fruity and lively with an excellent balance but perhaps falls just short of being a classic, only just though and that's probably just because some of the other Abbey tripels I've tried have set the bar so high. I definitely liked this one more than I thought I would but again sadly it's probably not one I'd pick up again unless I stumbled across in a bar which is quite unlikely as it stands.","flyingpig","Jan 13, 2015"

The mouthfeel was one of the best parts; nice carbonation, and full-bodied without seeming dense or heavy. Words I would use include spicy and nutty, with a lovely long finish and little bitterness or sourness to speak of. I have not had many tripels yet, but would recommend this beer to anyone who was interested in a moderately complex and tasty sipping beer. Would certainly buy again.","TheMcCollums","Jul 26, 2014"

Good with a meal (fish and green beans) but I think it would hold up all on its own....although I think it would always be better with some food. I can't quite put my finger on it, but a beer like this seems best with food. By itself it does quite well, but I think more of the flavors are notable with food to contrast against.

Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, pepper, light honey, bread, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, grape, light honey, floral, grass, bread, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, bread, light honey, floral, light pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, earthy hop, and yeast flavors; with a nice fruity/malt balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel and is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice tripel style. All around nice balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on.

Aroma is light yeast notes and a hint of green pepper (kinda strange). In the mouth, there's lightly toasted malt, mild sweetness and fruitiness, and a noticeable alcohol flavor. Highly carbonated, with minimal linger. Something of a boring Tripel. Easy to drink, but pretty low on flavor or aroma.","kscaldef","Sep 03, 2012"

Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom and side of the glass upon the initial pour. There are aromas of bready malt and yeast. I also pick up some hops in the smell. The malt profile is very forward in this beer. It is bready and sweet. The hops provide some balance on the back end. There's a touch of spiciness as well. The sweetness really opens up as it warms. The body is light to medium with solid carbonation. The finish is dry and smooth. The drinkability is high for this sipper. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Jul 28, 2012"

4.1,3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought that this was a good and above average example of an authentic Belgian Tripel, it had all the key things that I look for in a good example of this style. This beer had great drinkability, it went down really smooth, the alcohol hardly showed up in the flavor, and it had more then enough good flavors to hold my attention, this is going down quicker then I thought, one of the most drinkable Tripel's I have had, I don't think I would have a problem drinking the whole bottle by myself. What I liked most about this beer was everything, all aspects of this beer came out just the way they should and there was nothing off about this beer, a very well rounded beer. What I liked least about this beer is the fact that I have never seen it around here, we get a good variety of Belgian imports in this part of Michigan and I am surprised that I don't see this on the shelf next to the other awesome Belgian beers, what's the deal. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a good Tripel, it provided just what I want form this style, but since I can't find it around here, who knows when I will be able to try this beer again, I know if I did see it again I wouldn't buy just one bottle. I highly recommend giving this beer a try, if you want to know what an authentic Belgian Tripel tastes like try this beer and you should get a good idea on what this style is all about. This beer made for a pretty good first impression from Corsendonk, they did a great job with this beer and you can be sure that I will try more of their beers if given a chance, this beer is a straight up good Tripel, no doubt about it. I am very happy to be drinking this beer on my 400th review, it made for a great celebratory beer and a fun beer to review. With more great beers like this just waiting for me to try them, I can't wait to see what the next 400 new beers has in store for me.","StoutHunter","Apr 27, 2012"

The head is thick, white, lasts a long time and leaves lacing at each level you drink. The aroma is sweet, sugar and yeast. The flavor is sublime with a hi of fruitiness that smoothly transitions into a slight bitter bite that is just enough to cleanse the pallet before your next drink. This also leads to it being an easy drinking beer and one that is strong enough at 7.5 alc to make its presence known but doesn't sneak up on you. I honestly think this may be my absolute favorite beer. ","scottwestphall","Mar 04, 2012"

The aroma is pretty strong and it quite fruity (namely apples) with a healthy dose of the yeastiness I like in tripels, and a bit of spiciness. The taste, however, doesn't quite live up to the expectations the aroma generated. A nice fruitiness and spiciness, and a (very) slight hoppiness, but they're not as strong as I'd like, and fade pretty quickly. After about 45 minutes, the beer was almost as room temperature and improved a bit. The high carbonation makes for a fuzzy mouthfeel on top of an otherwise thin body for the style.

Sweet and pleasant. My initial flavor impression is of dark chocolate and raisins - bittersweet and dark fruits. Its not hoppy, not phenolic and not very belgian-like at all. Again though its sweet and pleasant. Mouthfeel is light and finishes sweet. The bottle was shared with my friend and was finished quickly.","dude","Jan 01, 2010"

It tasted like waxy lemon and sour yeast, with some salty and grassy hops and pepper. It was slightly thick and oily with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this tasted a bit strange, but was at least clean and drinkable. It had nice body and hid the alcohol decently. There was nothing unique or exciting about this beer, but perhaps age would help mellow out the waxy and salty flavors. But while this beer is fresh, I'm really not a fan.","Pencible","Oct 17, 2009"

Also, the brew came with a voluminous three-finger head that took forever to die and I could hear it descending (like the sound of rice krispies when you add milk). Has that great Belgian smell, hints of hops and yeast to create a fruity smell like orange and banana along with some mild caramel malts. Taste is more of the same as the beer is a fluffy medium body but also a little thick. Smooth and quasi-creamy, the caramel malt is really assertive with the hops for a sweeter, milder fruit taste that is subdued and finishes easy. There are other malts in play as well, such as nut or bread, maybe even toffee. The fruit tastes are pronounced: orange, banana, hints of apple. An easy going triple that I can have anytime.","clayrock81","Feb 22, 2009"

Nice fluffy snow white head that receded slowly leaving a nice clingy lace down the sides of the glass. Bright pale hazy golden yellow color. Very bright yellow with mixed in sediment when back lit. Certainly a decent looking presentation with the brightness of its color and the big fluffy white head. Smell is rather sweet like sugar cookie dough. Mild fruity tones also come into the nose. Slight alcohol esters mixed in with a slight spiced note that hides in the back ground. There are hints of a sweet bread dough flavor that come to mind with the initial taste. Certainly can taste the sweetness brought on by the pale malt and the alcohol. Mild hints of hops in the finish making for a well balance taste. The flavors on the tongue certainly have that distinct Belgium flavor. Slight yeasty flavor mixed with a mild dry bitterness in the aster taste. Easy drinking and enjoyable beer.

Not sure if the temp could have had any play on the extreme carbonation that seemed to be at play? The aromas where nice, sweet malt that seemed to have properties of rock candy, spiciness and pepper come out along with a citrus fruit like property. The taste is also good, lemon come out in front then it turns to more of the spices that seem to tickle the tongue. Another thing that I notice is the amount of bubbling that is going on, see a ton of bubbles transverse up the side of the glass. This is a good beer, and they way I described it above I guess I would expect to give it a better rating but for me it does not live of to its brother brews from Corsendonk.

There were only slight traces of these aromas. Taste was unfortunately weak as well, although not entirely upsetting after taking a few whiffs. There was also a faint detection of skunk in the airy mouthfeel which wasn't too distracting.

Soap bubble head quickly fills the glass, and slowly settles to a very dense; creamy head that never quite vanishes. Tiny, streaming carbonation does not disturb abundant patches of stubborn lace left behind. Belgian phenolics and fruit aromas, like peach and citrus. Pilsener malt and faint noble hops become apperent near the bottom of the glass. The first taste is sweet, probably from candi sugar and pale malt. Becomes fruity, but never turns to ester. The aftertaste has a german hop spice, but the gentle yet tart yeast flavor stands out the most. The phenols compensate for the lack of hop bitterness and the result is a balanced mouthfeel that finishes with only a whisper of yeast. The crisp carbonation and soft body make it very easy to drink a few; which sucks because its expensive; but you get what you pay for.","PBRstreetgang","Jan 08, 2006"

The taste begins with some spiced notes of corriander, clove and white pepper, followed by a sweet candy sugar flavor, a fruity malt/yeast character of orange and citrus rind, and some slightly bitter floral hop notes and a lightly noticeable alcohol character.

Nice carbonation, white head and incredible retention and lacing. Aroms are subdued, but nice. Fresh fruits, honey, chardonay like, mildly tart, and perfumy alcohol woven around peppery spices. The taste was a slight let down. It becomes a little too chardonay like. Less malty sweetness than I expected and a lower body too. All of the tartness of lemons, grapefruit, white grapes, and pears that I like, but lacks a bit of round sweetness going into the body. Remains alcoholic and perhaps a little phenolic. I think in their attempt for greater alcohol, they lost body and smoothness. Still, a world class beer.","BEERchitect","Aug 12, 2005"

Perhaps I didn't choose a more exemplar bottle of this tripel to review, but from what I've sampled this doesn't really thrill me too much, pretty plain overall.

4.1,3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Finally a local wine importer is distributing some new Belgians in Alberta; Corsendonk among them. The bottle is quite a simple affair, with a small white decal of Mary. Corsendonk's brewery label is definitely one of the more religious-looking. An apple and mango aroma drifts up after the cap is popped. The Agnus pours with a mammoth head verging on uncontrollable, especially in the Corsendonk beer glass. Big, pillowy and bright white, the head slowly falls to a drinkable level, leaving clingy lacing in rings and big dense pockets, all the while churning melodiously. The liquid itself is a cloudy champagne colour, bright golden. The first sniff gives an exceptional tripel aroma, full of spicy, brandy alcohol, white sugar, and a strong floral soapiness. Fresh wet grass above the rim, and down closer I get the maltiness along with a rich honey smell, which was appetising and a little different for a tripel. The aroma is quite dusty, warm and sweet. Some great fruitiness from the yeast, adding pear peel, green apple, mango, dried apricot and banana cake. There is a great deal of complexity to be had in the smell, and I found new aromas with each sniff. Much better than a lot of tripels out there. The taste does not fully fulfil the aroma, but is still first rate. The beer is quite syrupy sweet and sugary, but not cloying. Malt is given priority, and the phenols are masked very well. Some tinny metallic tastes throw in an off flavour occasionally. Surprising also is the spicy hops this has in the mouth, even up front on the tongue, almost like Saaz or Hallertauer. I tasted more hopping than usual for the style. The taste begins malty, gristy and with the flowery hops. In the middle all the fruit comes out, a little syrupy but filled with apricot and apple. The finish is dry with a little alcohol bite, and decently bitter from the hops. The smell and taste both have dusty, powdery characteristics. The sediment, tasted separately, is milky and even more dusty. I cannot complain about any element of the taste, save the fact that the aroma lead me to believe it would be a little better. This is medium bodied and low in carbonation, allowing for easy sipping. After a glass the stomach warms comfortably and you can "chew the cud" as it were of this beer. My verdict: a great example of the style, worthy of the name tripel, and very tasty, with enough complexity to satisfy most palates. I am glad I tried it. Thanks Corsendonk.","Cwrw","Jul 04, 2005"

Smells mildly sour, with plenty of fruity goodness and a bit of caramel. Taste is very nice, although not the best belgian I've had by a long shot. Lots of candi sugar, which has an almost saccharine sweetness in this particular beer, faint metallic quality, light clove, fig, and caramel flavors. Nice and complex. Carbonation is mild, with a slightly sour finish. Body is medium to light. This is one of the most ubiquitous belgians in my area, bottle wise. I was meaning to try it when i was first discovering beer, and i wish i had. I've tried so many other belgian abbey style ales that this one just didn't really impress me.

Cheaper than your typical top-shelf Belgian and the compromise is apparent in the brew if you search really hard. Some Euro-lager characteristics (off-flavors, too, such as corn, husk a la Heineken and Stella) which are definitely not welcome in a Belgian tripel. However, there are some very nice things going on here as well. Smoother than many tripels, with more emphasis on the pale malts, some shimmering hoppiness, and not too much yeast or peppery spiciness. That is a good thing, an entry-level Belgian tripel if there ever was such a thing. A tart apple quality is lively and refreshing; some white wine-like woody elements will put the oenephiles at ease. Seasoned beer drinkers will find some things to enjoy here but ultimately the beer is one-dimensional and you will probably be left longing for something to really knock your socks off.","Thrasher","May 06, 2003"

The taste is also a citrus/lemony flavor followed by a mild dose of aggressive hops that are very bitter but in moderation, all the while being supported by fruity malt undertones.

The flavor starts with a sweet and lightly peppery maltiness, reveals more honey-ish and vanilla notes, becomes yeasty with some hoppiness leading to a drying finish with lingering malt and spice. The alcohol is well hidden, but most likely adds to the peppery spiciness. Surprisingly complex and exceptionally drinkable.","NeroFiddled","Nov 17, 2002"

4.1,3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Hazy straw/gold. Sutble estery aroma. Yeasty undertones are present contributing some breadiness in addition to a reserved fruity, white grape flavor. Quite a nice tripel though a bit less complex than most in the style. A session tripel at 7.5% abv  ;-)","John","Oct 10, 2002"
2.58,-35.2,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"This brew just didn't impress me.  Poured with almost no head and was very light looking almost clear.  It had more of a smell than aroma IMO sort of skunky. And it didn't remind me of any pale i had ever tried, but the worst thing about the beer was the awful after taste. The first belgian that I have tried that I won't drink again.........CHEERS","tigerpaws","Oct 08, 2002"
4.02,1,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"A striking golden color, pours a quickly disappearing fizzy head. Spicy aroma is pleasantly inviting. Apple and lemon taste add to the increasingly warm alcohol feel. Enjoyable in small volumes.","paceyourself","Oct 06, 2002"
3.9,-2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pale golden coloring with a pure white head. In the same way that I can somehow identify Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing without knowing for sure it's him, the aroma and taste of this brew are distinctly Belgian to me, which I could point out even in a blind tasting (don't know quite what it is about Belgians that is so readily identifiable....yeast strain? just not sure)...estery, with a warming alcohol presence. Pretty short, dry finish. Very drinkable for a Tripel.","doerickson","Sep 26, 2002"
4.67,17.3,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Dense, white head with aroma expected of this type of beer. Many fruits are detectable at first, and when drinking the perfect mix of swwet and sour come out when the beer hit the back of your throat. Long, fruity fininsh. Fine example of a lighter tripel.","yen157","Aug 22, 2002"

3.92,-1.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"It's surprisingly light for its style, almost akin to the color of some light style lagers.  It's got that unmistakeable Beglian smell.  The flavor is not bad but definitely on the light side for a tripel.  It also seemed a bit thin.  However, it's pretty drinkable.  If you're going to drink a tripel outdoors on a hot summer day, this may be the best choice.","mickeymac","Aug 10, 2002"
4.02,1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Golden straw in color.  Citrus/floral nose with rich wheat-like yeasty aroma, somewhat breadlike.  Smooth and drinkable with mellow malt character. Rich mouthfeel helped with tasty hop character.  Very drinkable.","psugrad98","Aug 01, 2002"
4.1,3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Hazy golden hue w/ a thick, lace - leaving head.  Sweet citrusy fruit, green apple acetaldehyde, black licorice and pepper in aroma, w/ a tinge of earthy Styrian Goldings hop.  Only a hint of phenol is perceptible.  Sweet, lemony fruit flavors upfont, followed by lightly tart cidery notes.  Quite clean overall flavorwise.  Hop bitterness sufficiently balances residual malt sweetness.  Moderately bodied & refreshing considering the relatively high ABV.  Finishes dry w/ a quickly fading licorice note.  Abbey Pale Ale is tasty, very drinkable and smooth on the palette.  It's not a showstopper, but is highly enjoyable.  A great beer is you're craving a flavorful Belgian, but aren't in the mood for an intense Tripel.","marc77","Jul 31, 2002"
3.57,-10.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A very solid little beer, sweetish start, with hints of apple, and a nice soft yeast flavour, not overly complex, but very enjoyable, and easy to find in Belgium, i thik this is a nice one to fall back on, good bitterness on the finish.","rastaman","Jul 22, 2002"
4.16,4.5,5,4,4,4,4.5,"Musty, slight peper/yeast/sweet nose.  pale and bubbly with a white head.  Great looking in the goblet!  Very fresh hop falvor with a sweet malt finish.  Beautiful gold color with consistant carbonation throughout.  A very good beer.  Above average but not the best Belgian Pale I've tasted... just a 1/2 step below, but great tasting beer.","frank4sail","Jun 21, 2002"
3.93,-1.3,3.5,3,4,5,4.5,"a bit strong and like they say, it is silky smooth and very tasty. i enjoy the expensive belgian ales in the 750 ml bottles, and even though i am more of a dark beer man, this pale ale does it for me. fine beer must be appreciated no matter what class it is in. recommended to all!!","ElGuapo","Jun 20, 2002"
4.33,8.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I really thought this one stands out. Pours a bright golden orange color, that almosts glows in the light. Big fizzy head, dominated by floral, spices, and warm inviting smells. Very inviting aroma. Taste was bubbly, but with a nice balance of sweetness. Nice fruity feel and the end, and very very dry. Almost nothing lingering, but still crisp and refreshing. Good looking bottle and glass to match.","StevieW","Jun 10, 2002"
3.88,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This Ale has a very clean palate, starting with a dry, lightly citric fruitiness and finishing with a distinctive and delicate hop character. Very light and fluffy in texture, it has a big head so be gentle.","stoutman","May 29, 2002"
4.38,10.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The first Belgian style-Pale Ale from Belgium I have had.Good floral aroma,real yeasty and fruity flavor.High alcohol content but real easy to drink,became stronger as it warmed.","oberon","Apr 15, 2002"
3.65,-8.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It's got a nice blonde color and heavy carbonation with a steady stream of bubbles throughout although the head quickly dissipates. The nose is sweet and spicy and it goes into the flavor followed by some fruitiness (peach? citrus?) The spiciness is almost too strong, though.","aracauna","Apr 12, 2002"
4.1,3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: One of the more drinkable, yet tame and less complex imported Tripels. Still flavourful and very deceiving for its potency though not as boisterous or flamboyant as other Tripels can be.","Jason","Mar 30, 2002"
4.32,8.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I decided the other day to try this on tap, being that I have only had it in bottles. What a difference. Fresh and inviting, you could smell the flowery and fruity esters rising out of the glass. Very appealing to look at, light and with a delicate white head. Taste was outstanding, smooth and crisp, with a slight sweetness to balance out the richness of the pale ale. A nicely textured beer to drink all year round.","AaronRed","Sep 18, 2001"
