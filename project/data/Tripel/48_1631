4.42,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a chalice. Pours hazy golden with a big white head. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the side of the glass. The head retains very well for such a big beer. The aroma is bright. There are roasted malts, candi sugar, apples, pears, and citrus. There is that typical Belgian yeast aroma. The flavor is bready from the malts and the yeast and also mildly sweet. I also pick up those fruit flavors I found in the aroma, but not as strongly. The hops bring a subdued floral flavor to this beer as well as some balance. There is some tartness on the back end. The alcohol is masked in all those flavors. It's very well balanced. The body is medium with moderately high carbonation. The finish is crisp and slightly dry. This is a solid sipper. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Jul 26, 2012"

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with fair retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Minimal lacing on the glass, with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big apple, pear, orange zest, lemon, honey, herbal, clove, pepper, yeast spiciness, and light funkiness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of apple, pear, orange, lemon, caramel, honey, pepper, herbal, clove, and yeast spiciness. Slight fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of apple, lemon, orange, pear, caramel, honey, pepper, clove, herbal, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of malt sweetness and peppery spiciness; with great flavor complexity and balance. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick and prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is an excellent Tripel! Great flavor balance and complexity; and very smooth to sip on. Highly enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Jul 21, 2012"

Tangy citrus orange flavor up front with spicy corriander thru the middle and banana and sweet malt thru to the finish.

3.53,-8.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As someone has already noted in a previous review, this ale is heavily reminiscent of the same brewery's Bruegel, but while the punch is greater here (8% versus 5%), I think Bruegel is the superior drink, having more nuanced flavors that last much longer into the mouthful.","jondeelee","Aug 08, 2011"

3.6,-6.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"This brew poured up a murky apple-juice colored body with a huge foamy head with good retention and loads of lacing. Scents of yeast and malts intermingled with a bit of honey and ripe bananas. Flavors are near the same with the yeasts and malts and some spices with a tinge of alcohol and something near the lines of a sour mash taste at the finish. The body is light and thin with an ease of drinkability. For those that haven’t dabbled with tripels, this is a good start but know that tripels should possess a flavor complexity greater than what this brew presents.","awmiller","Jul 21, 2011"

This beer is somewhat similar, but it is drier, more bitter, and gets more of its flavor from hops and malts as opposed to cloves or other spices – all good things IMO. It is also much fruitier.","chinchill","Jun 13, 2011"

Nose is citrus and yeast, flavor is wheat and yeasty.

It has moderate yeast and a tinge of honey. The flavor is of sweet pale malt, moderate alcohol for the style, and a good amount of yeast. It's very solid but nothing to go crazy about. It could use a little more honey or spice to it. It drinks fine for the style and has the body you'd hope for and expect. I like it, it's definitely solid considering a big bottle was only $6.99.

4.06,5.2,5,4,4,4,4,"Medium to medium-full, but carbonation keeps this moving. Not a cloying brew, and very complex. Does not have the intensity of some others of the style, but this is one you'd grab again.","OtherShoe2","Apr 16, 2011"

4.18,8.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a crisp golden blonde, with a hint of cherry. Tall, highly retentive head stands firm. Aromas of mild fruits and candies dominate, with a hint of spice and molasses in the background. Fairly light bodied for the 8% ABV, no doubt thanks to the clear candies indicative of the style. Flavor is sweet, estery, and complete. A well rounded tripel. The fruits and some maltiness mix with the carbonation in the swallow, ending with a dry finish. I find myself seldom disappointed by the Belgian master's--another well recommended brew to behold here.","xodin","Feb 24, 2011"

The taste echoes the smell, with a strong, semi-citrus-y body, peppered, enmeshed in an ongoing struggle for supremacy with the yeasty characters. Straight tripel, yo. The body is a ligfht medium, with an active carbonation and a somewhat dry finish.

This beer pours a translucent golden wheat with a massive 3 inch, rocky cap that leaves lacing down the entirety of the glass. The lacing is so sticky it almost covers every square inch of the glass as the beer recedes. The aroma is fairly typical of Tripels. Orchard fruit reminiscent of apples and pears, sweet grains with just a inkling of booze. The flavor profile is a bit odd. I definitely get the typical pear, apple, grains, a bit of booze, but I swear there are some flavors that are typical of Hefe's. I definitely get clove, a bit of banana and some bready notes. Makes me wonder if this was fermented with some sort of mutant Hefe yeast. The mouthfeel is really thin. Definitely think that the body should be a little fuller.

The taste was nice and smooth and had the typical tripel sweetness, but less than others I have had and a little more hops than a typical belgian beer. It's almost like the americans had influenced this beer, but I'm guessing this was more of an inspiration for our hoptacular emphasis.

Nothing too huge here, but aromas are your standard sweet candy and fruit, and a nice mix of spices as well. No real alcohol presence, possibly covered nicely by the high carbonation.

A cloudy, orange body (probably would've been a 5 had this been a weiss beer - I mean this is orangey gold and cloudy) that had many smells. Tart citrus smells like orange, pear, sour apple mixed w/ hops, some malt mixed in there w/ something that smelled like oak(?) and even some bubblegum (??). Now, I know my nose is all over the place and that isn't the best thing for a beer to go off, but I am telling you I picked up a lot of hints (real or imagined). The taste was just a tad hoppy for my liking, but there was a strong fruit sense on the tongue, plus some yeast and earth sediments that nicely mixed that left a medium-heavyish body that I just soaked up - for 8 percent ABV they really hid it well.

Actually I think it might be a bit too much for me. I find it hard to judge the flavors with so much fizz and bubble. Taste is somewhat mild, but smooth.

Palate is quite light and delicate for a tripel - smooth pale malt, a good dose of citrusy tang, and just a bit of sourness on the finish. Body is highly carbonated and susceptible to foaming.

Other than the enormous head the color is a cloudy straw yellow. The aroma is very different with light and fruity citrus notes. The taste is light bodied with a medicine and yeast like finish. It is first refreshing and then turns dry. Very well-crafted and complex. The 8.00ABV is well-hidden and makes this very drinkable.

The tall head is uneven on top but the bubbles that construct it are all about the same size (very tiny). There is also a swarm of bubbles flying up from the bottom of my tulip glass, vigorously sustaining the head. This is a beautiful beer. Smells initially of a honey and light, dry oat malt with a huge banana, strawberry and lemon sweetness. In the background theres a hidden spicy yeast. The flavor is centered around this spicy yeast, complimented with some crisp hops, almonds and under ripe plumb skin. This branches off into a pineapple and hazelnut tangy finish that brings along some of the bitter yeast and hops with it. Somewhere in the middle there seems to be a slight brown sugar and green grape sweetness. The mouth feel is light and dry with a pretty wild carbonation that creeps all around my mouth, but then dissipates before it can ware out its welcome.","DarkerTheBetter","Feb 17, 2006"

Bready, spicy aroma from the yeast balanced by lemon and a bit of alcohol. At times I thought I caught some banana and nut, almost like banana bread, but this didn't last long and wasn't constant. Light flavour overall, maybe just good balance. Medium sweetness and significant hop bitterness along with a strong, bready yeast component. Lemon shows up towards the end and it finishes with increased spiciness. The flavour seemed to fall off a bit at this point though. Medium bodied, slightly slick with some dryness and alcohol warmth. Lively carbonation. Everything comes together fairly well. No complaints here!","DrJay","Feb 16, 2006"

It had a musty smell that reminded me of a lambic, which I liked, but it had a powerful alcohol / phenol smell that I didn't care for as well. The taste was very nice. A fair amount of spice and again, reminded me a little of a lambic or a saisson. Delicious. Great job on concealing the 8.0%abv, too.

Aroma is slightly spicy Belgian notes, with sweet malt support. Taste is nicely of the sweet malts, with little of the spicing I was expecting, but a slight sour note at the outset was a good addition. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, with another approachable Belgain here, yet still possessing some complexity more the more appreciative beer advocate.","ppoitras","Jan 13, 2005"

The malt is solid, theres also plenty of citric notes, even some iced tea flavors. Lemon is quite evident in the finish. The mouthfeel is prickly from the bottle conditioned carbonation.

3.57,-7.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Slightly hazy, peachy in hue with a noticeable coppery-gold influence. No animation was noticed in the still largely clear liquid, the head was white in color, at the peak it was a modest finger in height, there was many active bubbles on the pour but the head never really developed. The foam dissipated to a thin cap. Disappointing. Subsequent lacing was patchy and not very extensive. It looks okay in my goblet, nothing special really. The nose is medicinal with herbal qualities underneath. Sometimes the yeast came across messy as in too doughy. Thankfully there was a fairly big blast of fruitiness, heavy on melons, pears, oranges infused with an alcoholic coriander mixture. The maltiness isnt distinct. The bouquet is unmistakably Belgian. Good potency, it gets the point across. Inviting. The nose was silent about malt; the palate was, sadly, just as quiet. This got the beer off on the wrong foot. There was no structure; I couldnt put the big medicinal phenols in its proper place. I need some malt as a foundation to build off of. Shaky foundations are bound to fall. Still, there is good flavor here, melons and oranges provide the fruit and these flavors are found from start to finish. Shortly after the middle, cloves break the routine. Hay and spiciness from hops add a dimension. Raw medicinal qualities dictate the finish and the only other quality in the mix here is coriander. Dry, herbal qualities in the aftertaste, which has its moments but it comes off a little empty. Overall the palate is good but it could be so much more improved. The alcohol is very well hidden. Medium-light in body, too thin for me, the carbonation is big and very lively, I like the bubbles but I dislike the feeble liquid that hardly makes an impression on my tongue. This beer hovers around average for a Tripel, it has some pleasant moments but it lacks the substance needed for me to return to it. Simple tasting but, yes, it is drinkable. It was purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Ames, IA.","bditty187","Oct 14, 2004"

The smell is fruity with banana and orange. There is also some yeast and bread present in nose. The taste is fairly mild, with some citrus present, and a little spice as well, maybe coriander. Just a little too bland of a taste, it doesn't really jump out at you. It does hide the 8% abw well though. The mouthfeel is just a little light for a tripel style.

The alcohol comes on too strong in the finish causing a liquor tasting aftertaste. This beer is balanced but not complex and the flavors don't really mix too well.

Anyway, the brew pours a mildly hazy egg yolky yellow and features a gracious mound of fluffy foam and reatains a good deal of that as lace. Aromas are mildly sweet and slightly bananna-esc-with a definate malt drive. Sweet in the mouth with malted fruit and a very tiny bit of spice in the way of clove, nutmeg or other baking spices.

There are quite a few chunks in suspension, even before swirling in the yeast... not exactly a beautiful sight. Aroma is a pleasant mixture of honey, passion fruit, and musty yeast with some herbal notes. Flavor begins sweet with notes of passion fruit and orange, then becomes herbal and quite bitter for the style... probably more bitter than I'm used to in a triple, but it's not unpleasant.

The taste opens with the typical francophone sweetness of fruit and spices. There's a hoppy kick here that sets it apart from other Belgians, though.

Tasting -The spice hits first with the flavor, a bit stonger than anticipated from the smell. Afterwards, the malt comes in with apple and peach present. The most rewarding part of this beer is its mouthfeel sticking out against most abbeys- a nice true, Belgian tripel. The alcohol is not particularly present, leaving the pallette available to enjoy it to its fullest. On the other hand, nothing distinguishing about it that I can't find in other Belgians that have a bit more complexity. The price and availability of this beer are superb.","gnaussea","Oct 14, 2003"

Taste is not dissimilar to that of a traditional Belgian wit with some coriander and spice. It differentiates itself, however, with a subtle fruitiness, sweet malt and a bit of alcoholic burn on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little undercarbonated for the style, but it doesn't hurt the drinkability. The 8% abv is well-hidden in this tripel.

Once poured (and that's not easily done in one step) it holds exceptionally well, eventually dropping to what many other beers start with. It holds a solid 1/2"" throughout most of the goblet and leaves exceptional lace! (I understand, however, that this may be due to excessive aging and temperatures during export... the original in Belgium is supposedly more subdued). The nose is soft and fruity; it's not sharp or sweet, but more like an orange-laced pastry. It's gently grainy with a touch of wheat that supports the soft fruitiness. The body is medium; and it combines with a very fine-bubbled natural carbonation to leave it as soft and smooth as a silk covered pillow. Not unlike the aroma, a creamy maltiness that's accentuated by gentle fruit (orange, apricot, pear) envelops the mouth. It eventually gives rise to some underlying hop flavors and a noteably balancing bitterness. It finishes with a long-lasting note of mildy sweet and fruity malt; and drying, bitter, herbal hops.

4.08,5.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"I thought since I am having the Chimay White tonight it would be nice to have another Tripel to compare. Pours a cloudy-straw yellow in color with a half inch head of small bubbles that lasts. The smell in clean and fruity. Seems to have a much more pronounced flavor than the Chimay White. Both very effervesent on the tongue but this one doesn't seem to be as alcoholic as the other. Much more smooth and clean. Again, I am no expert on this style or any style more that matter.","CharlesRiver","Dec 23, 2002"
4.5,16.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very carbonated, slightly tart, and very dry. Strong citrus notes, and a good maltyness for the dryness. A good spicyness all the way through. I love the super dry character of thsi beer, very refreshing, and a clean aftertaste. Almost champaign like, but with so much character. And a good hop presence as well, but not overpowering for the dryness, just enough to add a pleasent bitterness and resiny hop flavor.","nathi","Dec 14, 2002"
4.15,7.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a nice, rich tripel from Belgium. A very tasty example of the style. If you come across an Augustijn, by all means purchase and enjoy.","DerKaiser","Dec 13, 2002"
4.28,10.9,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a cloudy golden color and formed a huge foamy white head that acted like a float and formed circular lace. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of citrus and spice is present with elements of grain. A flavor of citrus, spice and a slight bread aspect to it. A light and airy finish.","Wildman","Nov 30, 2002"
3.97,2.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Amber color with a light spicy smell and taste. Nice large white staying head. This beer is very pleasant to drink. Another Top Beer from Belgium. This guys have been in the market for hundreds of years","ipogios","Nov 16, 2002"

3.13,-18.9,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"The beer pours a slightly hazy golden-orange color, the head ethereal, white, the lace chunky, and long lasting. Nose is malt, citrus, clean and crisp. Front is ambrosial, the top slender, the finish caustic, the hops barely noticeable, droughty aftertaste, did not really find this beer as I hoped and subsequent samples has not changed my mind.","Gusler","Oct 20, 2002"
3.91,1.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden-peach color with a thick, creamy head.  An amazingly long-lasting, creamy head.  The body is filled with co2 trails rushing to the top.  Lightly fruity and spicy aroma.  Seems to have a faint aroma of green grapes.  Solid taste - flavor of mild fruit peppery spices, and a bit of yeast.  Spices dominate the slightly dry finish.  Rough, but not unpleasant mouthfeel.","Viking","Oct 03, 2002"

3.65,-5.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It has a hazy golden color, with a tight foamy medium head. Taste of spices with a touch of fruit. Alcohol was 8% but not over powering. In the same class of Draak and Piraat, which I picked all 3 up at Bevmo in California. But not as good.","BeerManDan","Sep 28, 2002"

4.72,22.3,4,4.5,5,4,5,"This is one of the most tastiest, easy drinking Belgian Triples that I have had. Poured into a goblet and it was just slightly cloudy with a whitish medium head. Smell was very wheatish, and fruity with just a slight tinge of alcohol vapors. Flavor was much the same with some juicy fruit flavors and very mild spices. You could hardly tell that this has 8% alcohol. Very nice and since it is the cheapest in their line I will be buying more.","Longstaff","Sep 13, 2002"
3.65,-5.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Yeasty floral aroma, very smooth medium body. Sweetish start, but well balanced, and spicy, with a slightly bitter finish, very enjoyable little beer, but not the most complex belgian beer.","rastaman","Aug 11, 2002"

3.92,1.6,4,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Augustijn:  Very highly carbonated, I lost a couple of ounces when I opened the well-settled bottle.  Golden, hazy beer, with a pure white head, that creates long, lingering Belgian Lace.  Wonderful aroma, somehow reminds me of the Sara Lee bakery when they were making thousands of cherry pies (I worked there for a spell).  Some malt sweetness, with a background of peaches.  Then it kicks in with aggressive hops, and a dry, clean finish.  I like this beer very much, but I’d like it better if it wasn’t so fizzy.  By the way, as it heats up, it's got a more pronounced alcohol warmth.","jackndan","May 18, 2002"
4.04,4.7,5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"It comes is a short brown bottle, do different Belgium breweries recycle the same bottle ? It looks just like a Maredous X or bier du buccaneer. Pours golden with a big white foamy head. Really strong floral aroma that set me back. The taste of yeast is really strong to start and finishes easy with a nice flavor. I thought it a very good wheat beer, not an ale. Very well balanced and easy to drink. I had it with a turkey sandwich on roasted garlic bread, delicious !","StevieW","Mar 27, 2002"
