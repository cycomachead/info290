4.33,4.3,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Purchased from the bottle line at Hill Farmstead for around $12.  Poured into teku glasses and shared.  A hazy dull yellow with a persistent tight white head of fine bubbles.  Aroma is at first funky and barnyard followed by lemon, yeast and reminds you of a nice Napa chardonnay.  Taste is delicious with light citrus, buttery white wine, tropical fruits and yeasty bread.  Mouth is medium body, medium-high carbonation, and well-hidden ABV.  Overall, this is a fantastic bretted triple....a very unique and pleasant beer.","FFreak","Mar 14, 2015"

4.46,7.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of a barrel aged brett beer, it's for sure not a true example of a Tripel, but there's just enough tripel aspects coming through to let me know that this is what this beer started as, but over a year and half it's became a pretty unique beer. This beer had great drinkability, it was smooth, clean, fairly crisp, refreshing, not filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I don't think I would have any problem drinking a bottle by myself, it would make for a great beer to enjoy on the porch on a warmer summer day. What I like the most about this beer was the taste, aroma and drinkability, all three of those aspects seemed to be the highlights of this beer for me. What I liked the least about this beer is nothing, but I'm not a fan of not being able to purchase it in Michigan. I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I would love to try it fresh and I would also cellar some since it seems to hold up well with age. I would recommend this to anyone who likes brett beers, it may not be a big hit to most Tripel fans, but if you like them funky then you should like this beer. All in all I was impressed with this beer and I'm pretty happy I decided to trade for this one, it's for sure a beer worth seeking out. This beer made for a great first impression for Anchorage Brewing Company and I would really like to try more of their beers. So far this is my favorite funky Tripel, I like it more than Vivant's Tripel aged for a year. This is just a great beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. I don't normally pair beer with things besides food, but I decided to listen to the 36 crazy fists album this beer was named after and it made for a nice pairing. Great job guys, you can be for sure I'll be seeking out more you your brews, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","May 12, 2014"
4.41,6.3,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Anchorage brewing has a winner here. I'm actually not the biggest fan of tripels so I'm glad this isn't heavy on the characteristics of that style. Very much an American wild interpretation and drinks more like an Orval, saison, fruity blond mix. So smooth and easy drinking, a bomber of this can go down so easy and get you on a high horse buzz if you don't watch it.

Pours hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange zest, pear, peach, pineapple, apple, pepper, clove, white wine, oak, herbal, floral, funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and wine barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, peach, pineapple, apple, clove, pepper, oak, white wine, floral, herbal, grass, funk, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pineapple, peach, pepper, clove, oak, white wine, floral, herbal, grass, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast flavors with well balanced wine barrel presence; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian Tripel with Brett. Big complexity and balance of all flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 05, 2013"

The nose comprises lemon zest, grapefruit zest, light lime zest, a hint of tart Chardonnay grapes, a touch of mild biscuit, and a stiff breeze of earthy Brett. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more of that tart Chardonnay character. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I can't say this resembles a traditional tripel all that closely, but the bright citrus, tart wine, and earthy Brett all combine together into a very tasty melange.

Aromas of roast and earth softening the Belgian yeast characteristics, including cherry sweet and white wine grapes. Slight floral highlights on the nose, too. Flavors are very layered, with an initial blend of char, tobacco, and wood giving rise to a toasted grain backbone with floral and sweet highlights of cherry, some citrus, nutmeg, all-spice, and white wine grape. Very balanced, and very dynamic. Wow. The chardonnay/riesling grape characteristics blend into the aftertaste, with a dry, crisp feel in mouth. Dry, clean finish, with a slightly dry-sweet lingering.

The description on the bottle made it sound amazing, and the pour to a tulip only got me more fired up with such a strong golden color. However, when I raised the glass to my nose, I smelled ... chicken coop? It was a smell I hadn't really gotten that strong since my childhood on a farm, and I have to admit it was not a good memory. I was curious if it was a bad bottle, but order was soon restored when I tasted it. There were those familiar Belgian yeast notes, but in a faded, distant kind of way. They quickly gave way to the brett, but again not in as strong a way as in other wild-style ales. There was such a collaborative effort between the flavors, and it made for a fairly unique taste experience. Really enjoyed this, and would certainly buy it again.","yankeepride","Apr 06, 2013"

The Brett is, of course, quite noticeable and adds a nice musty/barnyard funk complexity to the mix. Fruity with a bit of grassy hop crispness. Creamy and soft, yet effervescent and quite dry.

Taste starts with more fruity sweetness but quickly dries out and picks up spicy and sour flavors. There's a bit of booze to it. A little too tannic for my taste. The oak is strong. Funky, sour finish. Feel is light, but a bit boozy. A very good beer and an excellent and interesting take on the style.

Some charred oak along with vanilla and buttery white wine flavor which is countered by a dry, bitter pine presence and a strong, musty brett character. The wild yeast provides some dry, earthy funk that compliments the resinous hop flavor and gives balance to the tropical and vinous fruit sweetness. Underneath the barrel and wild yeast, there are hints of citrus peel, apple, pear and alcohol but the high ABV is well masked making this complex beer pretty quaffable.

You have to try it - but how you'll feel about the chardonnay barrel flavors with the brett influence is probably a matter of taste.

Head retention is pretty good, but lacing is definitely spotty. The nose is fantastic, dominated by notes of mango, pineapple, and lemon. There's an underlying earthy brett funk, and a touch of chardonnay adds another layer of complexity. The barrel aging is a little bit more prominent in the flavor profile. Especially cold, the boozy white wine notes overpower the beer a little bit. The citrusy lemon and tropical fruit influences are still present, but definitely take a back seat here as compared to the aroma. The brett funk is also probably a little bit stepped up here. It's still tasty, but doesn't quite deliver on the promise of the nose. The body is nicely dried out and light, but it's paired with a carbonation that could stand to have just a little more zip to it.

Overall, this is a fantastic beer, but I just wish I had bought another bottle. What they did with the Brett in this beer is just fantastic, so I would love to see how it ages. Crossing my fingers I find more.","DovaliHops","Feb 13, 2012"

4.57,10.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer is great because it does the same thing but in a totally different way.  It's perhaps the perfect funk beer.  Herbal , spicy, fruity, earthy and let very little defines itself (making the whole greater than the parts). This is no different but it's done very differently from love buzz and bittemonk. I get the feeling this is what de proef initially intended on with it's wild beers. Though this works like high art.","flannelman808","Jan 28, 2012"
3.76,-9.4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Taste as usual hides a high abv, thought the bretty and tart notes were on the lower side for an Anchorage release. Far better than your average belgian trippel for my palate, but the price point on these are always going to be somewhat prohibitive from becoming a regular part of any lineup.","Beerandraiderfan","Jan 27, 2012"
4.17,0.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I get a little bit of a citrusy tripel at first, and then the mellow, chard oak comes in. But the finish is quite interesting; a tingling peppery-ness swirls in and leaves with a bit of dry finish. This is definitely a different take on the tripel that I quite enjoyed.","Rollzroyce21","Jan 27, 2012"

4.92,18.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Let's face it, after the first three marvelous beers Gabe's released, we all know that his next offering was likely to be pretty special, and the tripel does not disappoint. It poured a lovely gold color with a nice white head. The aroma was interesting, with some spicy Belgian yeast notes intermingling with some bright, crisp citrus elements (likely from the Sorachi Ace hops) and just a touch of brett funk. Most of the same flavors were there on the palate, plus a touch of woodiness from the aging in Chardonnay barrels. Mouthfeel was good, and the brett funkiness reappeared significantly on the finish. Given my experience with Gabe's previous beers, I expect that cellaring will greatly increase the brett character, so if you don't like your tripels funky, drink this one fresh. It's 9.0% ABV and 30 IBUs, and one of the best tripels I've ever had. Another masterpiece from Gabe Fletcher's brewhouse.","Reswald","0"
