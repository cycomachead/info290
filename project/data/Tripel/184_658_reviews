"o: phenol qualities detracting from an otherwise pleasant, flavourful, delicious beer"
"Overall : A very good flavorful tripel with a harsh alcohol feel, and slightly too spicy for my taste."
""
""
""
""
"O- As my first Tripel, La Trappe Tripel was incredibly satisfying. Make sure you set aside an evening where you can sit and experience this Ale fully. Like many quality brews, high ABV can really sneak up on you and that's especially true with this one (it's sold in a 750 mL bottle)."
""
""
"O: Would classify this as one of my favorite triples. Slight sweetness is a perfect balance from the typically dry flavor of many other authentic versions. There is a hint of the same yeast profile as their quad, aftertaste is very similar and distinct."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite tripel better options elsewhere."

"From 750ml bottle circa 2013. Pours a hazy darker orange, two fingers of soapy white head, settles to a thin but dense cap, with big blobs of lace halfway down the glass. Smell: notes of plum and pear, bready, mildly peppery, with a note of clove. Taste: juicy pear, some apricot jam, snappy grain, pepper, lightly grassy, clove note. Bubblegummy in there towards the end. Carbonation is a little over aggressive. Pretty nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No doubt this is an authentic triple. Has all the flavors I associate with this style, and a nice complexity. If you are a fan of triples, this one is a must try."

"Thin head."
"On tap at Rattlen Hum, NYC. Not much under the nose or on the side of the glass but that's all cosmetic. The taste is just fine. None too sweet as some triples can be."
""
""
"In this very creamy beer the carbonation is a little above average and the body is just a hair below."
""
"Full-bodied and solid tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This one is only so, so. It is not bad by any stretch of the imagination but it is not the best Triple coming out of the Netherlands. That said it is still a lot better than many Triples from Belgium and so it deserves more than an average score."
""
"All around great in my opinion."
""
"A perfect example of a beautiful Belgian style triple"

"Surprised to find I'd rated this poorly the first time. This time round it's a lot better - slightly on the bitter side with a winey quality - really decent Tripel."

"330ml bottle. Tasting chalice glass. Amber color, chill haze appearance. Off-white froth creates a close crown & shows fairly good retention. Spiced – vanilla & herbs-, pale malt, spicy, delicate citric, sugar & coriander aromas. Smooth sweet maltiness is blown up by cumin notes & warm alcohol. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Texture is silky & ABV is felt. Hints of ripe fruit, light woody notes & sugary maltiness drive into a long sweet/fruity finish & aftertaste touched by funny peppery sensation."

"750ml corked and caged poured into a chalice glass. Cheers to my buddy Woody for the beer. It pours a medium brown gold color with a quickly dissipating head. Smells of bread dough and honey. The taste is bready with a quick whack of cinnamon. Does cinnamon come in whacks? There is also a slight earthy flavor, with a really nice aftertaste that just makes you want to have another sip. It is a straightforward tripel, not like the Westmalle, but very refreshing. The mouthfeel is spot on, tingly and buttery. Overall, I like this beer quite a bit. It is very good in a very simple way. I've been called worse, so I imagine the monks would be OK with that description."

"Had on tap at Craft Beer Market in Calgary. Served in an authentic La Trappe goblet, very nice. A rather unique color, a clear brownish yellow that somehow manages to fall right between my conceptualizations of ""light"" and ""dark", almost a translucent butterscotch hue. Aroma was sweet, fruity, floral, and moderately spicy, some of those classic Belgian esters and phenols are certainly present but are less aggressive than with many other tripels. I get some caramel, yogurt, baked pear, sweet citrus fruit, peach, plum, banana, and clove elements, on the nose and the palate. The malts are pound cake sweet and the hops (or yeast?) yield some floral chamomile and tobacco notes. Semi-aggressive carbonation and the alcohol does peak through near the end of the experience. More smooth, more mellow, and less boozy than other tripels I've tried and I appreciate the subtlety and near-creamy mouthfeel, although thankfully you won't forgot you're drinking a Belgian style ale."

"O: a good beer. not as bold as westmalle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Dangerously easy-drinking. Love the mouthfeel and smell, but the sourness lingers too long for my taste. Solid tripel and excellent value."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The savory, meaty note just seems terribly wrong in the midst of other more natural flavors. I could be willing to try again to see if this is an unusual batch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste came across as a little more bitter than I am used to for the style notwithstanding the intense flavors of toasted malts, vague spices, and a lingering but clean astringency at the tail end. This had a kind of sharpness to it that I don't see often in Tripels."
""
"La Trappe Tripel pours a dark golden color with a nice large lacing head. There is a sweet and dry fruity aroma with strong banana notes. The taste is much the same, nice mellow sweetness, with a dry finish, good dry fruits present. Good solid body, good flavors, and not overpowering, and drinkable. Overall a very nice well built drinkable tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer their quad, but this is still very complex and incredibly fruity, a beer that grows overtime. Give some time to peel all its flavor layers. My grade would be fairly different otherwise."
""
""
"Overall: A great beer. Very complex, and deceptively heavy, I find. Others find tripel's deceptively light, but I found that the smooth mouthfeel really made this one feel heavier on the tongue than you would assume from the color. The head also stuck around a lot longer than I'd expect from something with 8% ABV. Overall, a great beer, and one I would get again. Look forward to trying more tripels."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice but I prefer the quadruple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this might not match up to other Trappist Tripel's, but it is still quite nice tasting."
""
""
"Overall - Very delicious and quite complex. Not quite as good as some of the other tripels, but still a favorite that I may purchase when it's available."
"Overall - Not as good as I was expecting but still pretty decent. Just doesn't have as many floral and fruity notes as some other triples have. Kind of like a triple and a duble mixed in some ways."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; so please disregard those scores"
"O - Overall one of my favourite tripels. I love the balance between the malty roasted nut flavours and the fruity flavours."
""
""
""
"O: this is a good triple that was easy to drink. The most disappointing part of this beer was the artificial cork that topped the bottle. I fought to get it out, and this had me starting out a little miffed. I am generally a fan of tripels, and I quite enjoy most Trappist offerings, but I am on the fence with this one... Maybe the quad will change my mind."
"Should have been rated years ago, but impressed by this beer's consistency as well as its quality."
""
""
""
""
"This beer, as Trappist style dictates, is designed by those under and for God; it's going to be good. This beer, although not life changing, is one of the better tripels out there. With its pseudo complexities, this beer is an interesting stand-alone drinker. However, if you feel like pairing it with something, this beer goes great with a smoked salmon pear glaze on a rice pilaf with mild spice; try it with Chinese food too"
"Overall: a solid tripel. This beer is worth cellaring. I cellared the quad which after 9 months was quite complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A nice triple that has a great easy drinking character with a good blend of malt, light fruits and yeast. Rather enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"(4.0) D: A good and solid all-around tripel and one I would enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
"To taste: 92/100"
"Overall, I'm not a big fan. This has really darkened, dampened and flattened with time, and I'm far from being enthusiastic. Indeed, this tastes a little like a mediocre homebrewer attempting a strong Belgian golden without much success. Very average indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: bit disappointing; drinkable, but doesn't make me happy."
"Beer is medium in body and quite sweet, the finish is a little heavy, overall it is just too sweet and not try enough for my tastes. Not a bad beer but too much esters and malt for my tastes."
"After half an hour the brew brings forth a touch of pear, but in the nose and taste there's still a hint of phenols as may be inherent in the yeast. Tasty and challenging for a tripel."
""
""
""
"fruity esters. actually a decent beer at the end."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, kinda kicking myself for by passing this one so many times on the self. I guess the trappist reference kinda threw me off as being a little commercial, and its netherland origins. But honestly pretty authentic and will surely be on my list for the future. maybe i'll check out the quad next time. High fives all around for this golden beauty."
"Strong orange and apricot in the flavor. A bit overpowering, almost syrupy or artificial. Nice carbonation in the mouth makes this a good beer, but not my favorite Tripel. Smelled great, but the taste left something to be desired."
"This is a well rounded beer. It starts off with an autumn orange flow into the glass that it is poured with an off white head to follow. The smell is sweet and peaceful and tells you that there is smooth flavor to follow. The taste is a pleasure while the mouthfeel; however, is a bit bubbly and tickles the capillaries to pause the time causality while the brain questions the thought if the hops come before barley, or am I wrong? This is worth your dollar, and with the recent loophole for bankers in free-trade laws I will say it is worth your time here in Panama."
""
""
"O: I was extra careful in keeping the yeast out. But regardless, it's a very impressive Tripel and also quite different from other's I've had. It's kind of ""flashy"" in a way like a polished car."
""
""
""
""

"O - A smooth, balanced and fairly hoppy Tripel. The alcohol is definitely present, but the balance of flavors help keep this dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
"Flavor had a good amount of candyish sweetness to start. Solid trop fruits attacked the palate, with pear, green apple and some honeydew. Finish leaned towards dryness, with some cotton candy notes detected. A nice Tripel! Thnx to Thijs for covering my two biers here at La Trappe."

"Final Grade: 4.02, just barely eking out an A-. La Trappe Tripel remains one of the most accessible tripels in my area - I have enjoyed it every time I have had it, and there is no doubt in my mind that I will enjoy it many more times in the future. This Dutch tripel is not quite as good as some of its Belgian trappist equivalents, but it's still a fabulous ale that all tripel-lovers should try if given the opportunity."
"Amber orange and hazy. Massive off-white head is retentive and lacy. A fine looking beer. Aromatic notes of honey, banana, pear, and clove. Dry and yeasty with apple, banana, and peppery notes. Slight alcohol warmth. Light bodied with lots of soft carbonation. Feels like velour in the mouth. Pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really good brew. Doesn't really look or taste like a triple to me based on the dark color and the flavor profile. Still a very complex and well rounded set of flavors. Would be glad to enjoy this anytime."
""
""
""
"O - A tasty triple and worth a try, but I've enjoyed others more. I would prefer a bit more Flavour and less heat."
""
""
"A great beer."
"I'm completely disappointed with this beer. It's not easy to drink. The tastes is below average and the spice is too much. Just not a good tripel."
""
""
""
"This wasn't the best Tripel that I have had, but it's up there. Being particularly Fruity and smooth made this one an easy drink. Great stuff."
""
""
""
"O: It requires your full attention, but it is very drinkable."
"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled 11/30/2010. Pours fairly hazy golden orange color with a fairly dense 2 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, pepper, pear, apricot, grape, candi sugar, biscuit, honey, and yeast spices. Very nice and well balanced aromas, with good strength and complexity. Taste of big lemon, grape, pepper, pear, apricot, clove, candi sugar, bread, coriander, banana, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of grape, pear, lemon, coriander, pepper, clove, and big yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great balanced flavor profile of sweetness with spicy character; and no cloying sweetness at all. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick and prickly mouthfeel as expected for the style. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all on the finish. Very smooth to drink but is still definitely better to sip on. Overall this is definitely a great Tripel. Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth and highly enjoyable to sip on."
""
"O: As expected from a triple the alcohol is well hidden, the sweet malty brew is easy to drink and versatile enough to complement creamy rich cheese or crisp salad. La Trappe is an easy drinking brew that shows some of the best of the Tripel qualities, I'll definitely be picking up a bottle just to have on hand."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good tripel, overall. Not particularly pretty, but otherwise smells and tastes good while being quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer a lot, I served it with a Sweetgrass dairy Green Hill double cream and french bread. Made for an excellent pairing and lunch."
"La Trappe Tripel, 750ml bottle: Fantastic! I am a big fan of Belgian style tripels, and the La Trappe is a worthy find. Not much of a head forms on this brew compared to most tripels, which tend to produce a washer load of suds. The La Trappe is cloudy, and has a straw yellow color, with a hint of red if held up to the light. There is an aroma, but it is subtle. So far, not outstanding, but take a sip. The La Trappe is clean and crisp, very champagne like at the start, and staying light and flavorful to the end. This is a great tripel for newcomers and beer advocates alike."
""
""
"Highly recommended."
"Very well brew and very easy to go with yet high drinkability as there is no harshness and alcohol is well hidden. Everything just goes down smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Served in my Maredsous chalas. Look is deep golden almost brown with a somewhat thin head. Very little lacing. Both of these points are surprising considering the style and origin are know for head and lacing. Smells of yeast, slight pepper, and a whiff of alcohol. Tastes fantastic like honey, caramel, and bread. Definately on the sweet side."
""
""
"O: Overall it's a very good beer. It's not my favorite Tripel, but it is very tasty and quite delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the cream of the crop for Belgian Tripels for me, and one of the best examples of the style (in my opinion). I have had this often over the years and it is always consistently fantastic. I'm surprised I hadn't already reviewed this one, since it's easily one of my favorite beers in the world."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good tripel but not the best I've had. I'd still drink it again though, maybe fresher next time."
"Impressive beer to say the least. A couple others in the style I like more, but this gives a different interpretation of the style while maintaining old world flavor."
""
"I thought I'd reviewed this one before but apparently not, not the best Trappist ale out there but certainly nothing to be ashamed of"
""
""
"Overall another solid tripel, just wish it hand everything else on the beer enjoyment scale to really dig it."
""
"O- chalk up another one for the Trappist Monks. An exceptional tripel. I would recommend this beer to those who enjoy the style. I would have this again in a heartbeat."
""
""
"Drinkability: Impressive. It is nothing orgasmic — I can definitely “Taste the Silence” — but it is impressive."
""
""
""
""
"As always with tripels I am underwhelmed. I'm sure it's me and not the beer. Would like to try it with food."
"This brew poured out as a hazy golden color with a thin white head on top. The lacing was a little sticky but nothing too crazy really. The smell of the beer was sweet smelling with a little bit of fruit and spice on the nose. The taste of the beer also has a decent sweet flavor in the beginning. The spices come through in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth with a moderate carbonation. The brew is drinkable and medium bodied. Overall this brew was pretty good."
"Overall: A nice example of the style, but not my absolute favorite."
""
""
""
"D: Oh yes. This is now my mother's favorite beer and that makes me very happy. To think she used to drink Blue Moon as her Belgian of choice..."
"Dr: The high ABV is somewhat concealed, and she drinks easy. It's of pretty good quality. It's priced too highly in France, but I'd try it again preferably out of a bottle, or in Belgium or Holland."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the best beers I have tried, and definitely a champion amongst tripels. Pick it up. Don't hesitate to try the dubbel and quad versions either (quad especially)."
""
"D: I find tripels go straight to my head so I couldn't have more than one of these in a sitting."
""
"Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an excellent brew that is better than I remember it from my first taste"
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
"this beer is just plain smooth. kinda leaves a little more to be desired in the taste, seems like theres one thing missing..."
""

"A very good Tripel, even the wife liked it."
"This thing has great drinkability. Finished those 11.2 oz quite quickly."
"O: This is a well made, slightly different, very likable version of a tripel."
"Appears a ruby amber color with minimal head. A few bits of yeast and lots of active carbonation are visible through the mostly clear liquid. Smells of butterscotch liquor, a little like a barley wine. The taste is full of roasted malt, unique yeast profile, almost like English ale character. Quad like in flavor almost. Big alcohol, nice twinge of lemony hop bitterness, and malt body full of character, roasted, peaty, and lightly sweet. Delicate balance for a powerful ale. Medium bodied and a drying finish. Trappist but not like your standard Belgian, and why should it be, it's Dutch. Classic."
"O - Nice but not really special."
"I would have it again based on its' easy drinking."
"Overall a very good beer that I wouldn't hesitate to drink again."
"O - A decent tripel but I found this one somewhat plain and lacking complexity."
"If you're looking for a solid tripel, look no further. (One benefit of the LCBO is that this brew is fairly cheap ($6.45 for the bomber), so it's a good brew to try.) There are other nicer, more complex tripels to be had out there, Belgian, Canadian, American or otherwise, but this is no slouch. Another fine trappist ale."
"Overall a very good tripel, but nothing unique or really interesting."
"There is nothing evil or bad going on here, nor anything distinguishing. I normally prefer american belgians for value and more adventurous taste. I would not buy this again based on poor value and better tripel's available."
"O/D - Really nice. Not too sweet. A solid Tripel with not much complexity, but great flavour."
"jd"
"O: decent tripel but pretty boring, definelty enjoyed it more as the beer warmed to room temperature (had a 25.4oz bottle)"
"Drinkability - OK and probably a bit above average. With the fierce competition in this style - beers ranging from true to the style and its history to beers that try to reinvent the Tripel - it is hard to say this is any more than a good beer. It doesn't represent the style nor does it push the boundaries."
"O: It's a very good Tripel. Maybe a little too strong and dry for my tastes, but I served it too cold at first. When this beer warms it is fantastic, it opens up the flavors and they are excellent."
"O: The less traditional Trappist beer but still a great one"
"O - A great brew, aged well and served proper."
"Overall a nice tripel that ticks all the boxes nicely."
"A very slick, lush and sweet Tripel, but I suspect there's some age on this bottle. Drinking perfectly right now!"
"Overall - this is one of my new favorite tripels, perfectly balanced and the complex malt character"
"O: Very similar to their quad in the approach to the style-- low complexity, fairly intense flavors and each flavor bright and ringing true. I will certainly buy this again-- quite enjoyable indeed."
"taste is the same. picking up a lot of alchohol with muted flavors in the background. not that impressed."
"Probably won't grab another soon, but I'm curious about their Quad. I feel like the body characteristics of this beer would really shine with that style. Hopefully that'll be coming up soon."
"Overall this was a nice find but nothing over the top by any means. I think this was a very tasty beer without trying too hard. Very pleased that it came in a three pack. Worth picking up if you come across."
"Strangely refreshing and highly drinkable for a tripel."
"Hazy copper orange, one finger white head, sticky with lots of lace left behind. Smell is yeasty with green apple, candy fruit and banana followed by bubble gum and citrus and faint alcohol. Taste is sweet candy, apple and lemon, grainy, dry bread, warming alcohol, fruity finish and aftertaste, light bitterness, slightly hoppy at points. Med - Full body, good weight, medium carbonation, nice feel. Overall a very nice tripel, would have this on the reg for sure."
"Overall a very good beer, but not one of the stronger trappists. However, that's a bit like batting towards the bottom of the order on the all star team."
"Pours a copper red, with a huge four finger off-white head. Massive carbonation, not unlike most other bottle conditioned Belgians. Fluffy and somewhat sticky/dense walls of lace. Nose is mildly yeast, green apple, raw pear. Some bruised banana phenolics. Quite dry, not showing alot of sweetness. Taste is a caramelly-green apple, pear again and some yeastiness. Some fusel alcohol along with a peppery spice in the midmouth., which continues into the finish. Mild dryness and some stickiness. High carbonation and with a lot more caramel-like malt body than most other tripels I've had. Warming and nice overall, but something I'm more accustomed to having in the cooler months, although not completely inappropriate for the heat here now."
"Poured from bomber into a snifter glass. Pours hazy orange/amber color with a medium sized bright beige head along with decent lacing throughout. Aroma is yeasty and sweet with notes of dried fruit, pomerans, clove, some almond paste and spice. Taste is thick and candyish yeasty sweet (caramel) with citrus, fermented apples, coriander and spice. Sweet, yeasty, acidic and spicy without much bitterness. Body is first sweet and big just to falter a bit towards the end, in other words, flattening. Carbonation is quite smooth and tickeling. Too simple and underwhelming of a tripel for me."
"Poured a golden body a little bit of head. A standard Belgian aroma as I pick up touches of sharp citric/banana/orange and yeast as well as something tropical like pear. Also some clove/pepper and a good touch of sugary sweetness. Sharp and lively, the taste kicks off with a touch of funk but then this light to medium bodied brew goes down smooth and filling thanks to the yeast. Other flavor notes include citric lemon zest, apple or pear notes, some spice, as well as caramel and sugary malt goodness. The ABV is about right as the beer has a little kick but not overpowering, enabling both the fruit and malt tastes to balance and come out and finishing easy."
"Pours a hazy burnt amber with a well-lacing white head. Decent carbonation. Smell of sweet fruits and light sugars, with citrus notes. Taste is of light spice and fruit sugars: banana bread, peach, orange zest. Sweet malts and very little hops detected. Smooth and medium bodied, and nice drinkability."
"Overall, a good but not great tripel. I quite enjoyed it, but it is not one of the best."
"Overall a decent tripel, though not my favorite-- a bit drier and more accessible than some while retaining some Belgian sweetness"
"Overall. Actually the triple is better than the quadruple, though the trip is only 8.0ABV,and the quad is sufficiently more (I believe 12ish) This has a more pure taste, I would drink this again, but still feel La Trappe is the tamest of Trappists I have had so far!"
"This beer pours with a lot of head. The bubbles are small and dissipate quickly. The aroma given off is a light sweet smell. Looking at the beer it looks like an average wheat beer with a yellow amber hue and murky transparency. This beer has a bold start and a light finish. A lot of flavors hit you in the beginning, to include, spice, orange, apples, and hops. It finishes the palate cleanly with a refreshing feeling. This beer is a good summer beer. Cheers."
"Overall: This tasting was a bit disappointing. I had a bottle last night and liked it. Today it seems one dimensional and simply okay."
"Interesting... the taste is similar to the nose but deeper. Quite peculiar in its phenols and esters that dominate this beer. Mmmmm. Now this a beer. Highly recommended. One of my personal preferred examples of the style. B+, Blasphemy! I adore its musty peculiarity."
"Overall, this was quite different from your typical quality tripel, but I still liked it."
"Good but not he best, not a classic tripel"
"O - Perhaps this bottle is off, but not so much that it's clear it is, especially since this is my first bottle from this brewery. The alcohol is too forward and disconnected, so it gets in the way of enjoying the flavors. There are definitely much better Trappist tripels. I might give this one another try should I run across it on tap, but it's not a selection I'll seek out."
"750ml of decent tripel @ under $7 bucks here in ""tax the ass off of booze' Canada."
"D: While the nose is rather interesting, the taste doesn't quite live up to it, and the sweetness is rather high for what I expect from a Tripel. The mouthfeel was also different from what I was expecting. I honestly didn't love this beer."
"Pours orange-yellow with very nice head. Smells are very understated, but slightly malty and floral. Flavor was nice, mix of yeasty, malty, and bitter. Felt like a nice soft carbonation and pretty drinkable with a small touch of sweetness. I liked this beer but it's a slight departure from the benchmark style type. Quality shown through."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. This came as a nice surprise after the aroma fell a bit flat. A tripel should really pop the nose, with bright notes of what is contained within, but the aroma must have escaped when we opened this one. Otherwise the beer was fine, and middle of the road for the style, with nothing totally offensive marring the tasting."
"Still, there is not much surprise or intrigue or excellence in delivering great taste in this beer to make it a staple. It's probably the cheapest Trappist tripel, though, which may be a factor in coming back for it when I desire a thicker, sweeter version of a tripel that Trappists are famous for."
"D - pretty drinkable, but there are better trappist beers out there"
"My final new beer of New Year's Eve (though the clock struck midnight a while ago, so ""Eve"" might be a misnomer). It pours a cloudy golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises banana, clove, pepper, Belgian yeast, and lemon zest. The taste holds notes of wheat, clove, pepper, Belgian yeast, and orange peel. The body is a strong medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a solid tripel, but not as strong as other similar offerings. Hard for me to explain, frankly, but suffice it to say that, though it is indeed pretty good, it's not quite near the top of the heap."
"D: This is a nice Tripel. Its only real weakness is its thin flavor out of the gate."
"D - Not a bad Tripel but comes nowhere close to the Westmalle."
"It is dark for a Tripel and doesn't have as dry of a finish as most do"
"La Trappe Tripel has a dark orange colour and an excellent head. The smell is bready with some spiciness. This beer has a maltiness up front that morphs into a caramel flavour with a sour, almost clove-like aftertaste. It has a nice foamy feel to it. This is a great beer."
"Drinkability, at the same price as coronas and twice the abv, this'd be a favourite, but apparently its no longer going to be sold where I bought it :( fml. I'll just need to stock up tomoz. :D"
"On tap at Smokeless Joes in Toronto, served in a branded glass. Cloudy pale orange colour with a finger of white head that never really dissipated. Lacing down most of the glass. Smells quite fruity with a lot of the Belgian yeast. Some spices too I think, though I can't put my finger on what they were. Flavour is fairly sweet with a slight hint of bitterness. Overally a very nice tripel."
"Nice dark golden color. I poured into my Affligem chalice and had about one finger of foamy white head. It gave some minor lacing. Smell is malty bread. I tasted some yeast, a loaf of light bread, some citrus, and maybe some honey. Mouthfeel is medium bodied-probably the bread effect. You feel some warmth from the alcohol ever so slightly. Drinkability is fine. I might seek this out again but probably not for a session."
"D-decent beer, somewhat mild as the dough bread and raw honey seem to dominate and don't allow much else to come through. the phenols are lighter than I would like as well as the yeast presence. tasty but not tops for me."
"Overall impression: not the best tripel i've had but would still enjoy it anytime."
"D - I like it, but in the presence of other triples, I will pass. It reminds me of an over-sweet Chimay Tripel or a less sweet La Fin Du Monde. It's in the pro's but is relegated to the bench on my team."
"D- Not as aggressive as some tripels, as far as intensity of flavor. With that in mind though, the beer is quite tasty and more sessionable than many tripels."
"Poured a clear, dark amber color with white foam that settled to coat the glass. The smell was lightly sweet with a touch of sugar and malt and a light fruitiness. The taste was lightly sweet with hops up front. Mildly fruity. Very mild flavor for a tripel. The mouthfeel was lightly sweet but fairly dry overall. Medium body and good carbonation, especially up front. Sweet, malty finish. This was an OK tripel but not one of my favorites."
"D - Complex, nice mouthfeel, great taste and carbonation. This is a beer for all seasons, and it's up there with some of the more interesting tripels I've had."
"Drinkability: Decent beer and reasonably sessionable with a lower ABV than other tripels."
"A very balanced yet meaty malt body carries a wide range of flavors beginning with a big taste of caramel malt, candied sugar, citrusy and resiny hops. Earthy tastes of dried figs and tobacco linger in the background. A light fumy rummy kick is there throughout. All in all a very nice drinkable big-bodied ale. Nice!"
"11.2 ounce bottle. Poured into my Chimay Trappist glass. By the way if you don't have yourself one of these glasses you're missing out - they're basically a glass goblet. I took care in the pour to avoid getting a bunch of yeast into the beer, so there's little to no head on this one. Nice carbonation levels, it bubbles like a sparkling champagne or something similar. Kind of a hazy appearance, with a really nice amber color that reminds me of sun tea. Initial impressions of the aroma is that it's much more ""beer-y"" than I was expecting. I get grain and malt, almost like a basic amber ale. That doesn't last long though. The second sniff hits with you with that classic Belgian estery sweetness. I get green apples and dried apricots in the nose. First taste is rich with an almost velvety mouthfeel. It's a heavy beer, with lots of dark toffee malt sweetness chased by warm fruits. You get a warm rush of alcohol in the finish. This beer shines in the finish. I haven't had a beer with this kind of aftertaste. It's like the opposite of hoppy. There's just this huge brown sugar and roasted cereal finish that's quite delicious. The alcohol level prevents this beer from being anything more than a special occasion, but there's no denying it's doing something right. Very solid example of a Belgian Trippel. I'm impressed."
"Overall this is a solid tripel with a nice malt base. Not as crisp or flavorful as the best of the style but still worth a shot."
"This is a very nice, mellow Tripel. A little sweeter and smoother than some others I've had. If you like this, try the Quad from this brewery too!"
"A good partly cloudy transparent amber hue with a non lacing fizzy white head. Smells sugary with ripe banana untertones. Very fruity taste blanketing any alcohol. A little spicy aftertaste that become predominate as it warms. Oily slick feel. A decent Trappist. Cheers!"
"Citrus notes and a yeasty taste. Not bad at all!"
"Out of a bottle this beer was a hazy copper color with some golden highlights that appeared when held up to light. The one finger of beige head quickly faded to a thin skim and then a collar. I observed a good amount of rising carbonation and the lacing was fine. The aroma was light for a triple (?!), sugary malts, vanilla, caramel and some molasses. The flavors were a pleasant yet understated blend of caramel, sugars, spices, vanilla, nuts and a grip of alcohol heat that led to the dry finish. Clearly punchy yet perhaps not as well-defined as many of its counterparts. The mouthfeel was foamy, the body medium and the carbonation medium as well. If one is to try one of the great Trappists I wouldn't recommend this one."
"I have a pretty good feeling that this was just a bad bottle but it simply isn't worth buying another to find out. At nearly $10 a bottle, it's a total disappointment."
"Drinkability is very good with this brew, I find myself drinking it very quickly and having to put it down. Overall this I very good beer with nice malt and yeast complexities. I very much enjoyed drinking it and would have it again."
"Smooth and slightly peppery. Notable alcohol in the background, particularly in the swallow. Spritzy yet full bodied. I note hop in the finish, which is great in a Trippel."
"D - This brew tastes good, but it is not the best example of the style; Tripels by any other Trappist as well as many by secular Belgian breweries far exceed this brew. Drink one of them."
"A nice beer, but not very memorable. The head is weak (actually the head on the remaining beer on the bottle looks better). I like the breadyness, but it seems lacking in the other flavors."
"Definitely not my favorite tripel, but it's still a good beer."
"Notes: Best before 04/2012. Overall a solid and nice beer to drink. Nothing amazing, and it doesn't blow me away and there are Tripels that I prefer, but it is a good beer. With all that said, I would drink it again, and it is worth trying."
"This isn't a bad beer but hardly memorable. I think any more than one or two would be overkill. There are better triples out there."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were OK but i wont seek this out again"
"D: lower drinkability for me because the alcohol taste is too prevalent and unappealing."
"Summary. If I liked doubles and tripels equally as well, this would be a damn fine beer. Regardless, it misses the style by a pretty wide margin. They should change the label and call it a ""5-halves"" since it is exactly what I imagine a hybrid double/tripel should be."
"A really well balanced tripel."
" A mellow trappist triple done by a commercial brewer, I look forward to seeing how the 2 bottles I cellared will taste in a year or two."
"D: The alcohol is very well hidden and it's relatively easy to drink. I would drink this again because it tastes like a hybrid between a dubbel and a tripel and I like both of these styles."
"Overall, I would say this is the most disappointing tripel I've had thus far. It just didn't have the sheer quantity of flavor I expected."
"D- Great beer ABV is well masked, and the taste leaves me wanting more!"
"Smooth and decent drinkability, but not that complex and doesn't match up that well with the best of the style."
" A great tripel that caught me off guard. I tried it's older brother Quadrupel and was impressed so now it's little bro's turn and it did not dissappoint. Now time for baby bro Dubbel. Great stuff so far from Koningshoeven."
"I'd buy this again."
"42/08 on cork"
"Mf is in the way of coarse textures, but wetting at the same time. There is a slight alcohol warmth here too."
"Flavor is close to the aroma. Sweet, slightly tart...carbonated. Medium body, booze seems closer to 10 or 11%. Lot's of fruit/apple flavor. This tastes great at around 45 degrees, but as it gets closer to room temp, it really starts loosing flavor for some reason. Another very good beer from a great brewery!"
"D-- Very different. Will say that. Feels bigger than what it actually is ABV wise at 8%. Not as sweet and not as fruit forward as others. More of a brandy type nightcap on a cool night. One is good and more than enough. Other triples are better than this but this is worth trying once."
"D - Pretty good beer. There are definitely better tripel's out there but it is refreshing and goes down smooth."
"D - noticeable alcohol but easy to drink. definately a good beer that will be revisited but not too many at a time"
"The big bottle is the perfect size for this one. It goes down smoothly and is a pleasure to drink, but I don't see myself having another."
"Well that was a nice surprise, not what I usually expect in a Tripel, but it has its moments and is unique enough to stand out and hold its own. Maybe not so much for a revisit given the price, although I don't regret the purchase."
"Mouthfeel is quite rich, unorthodox for a tripel."
"A fine beer but not to my liking."
"D - Surprisingly great tripel with average abv. Definitely will drink some again in the future."
"D - Good drinkability, refreshing."
"Most of the factors are there to make this a great beer, but it just doesn't seem to hit the right spot in the taste department when it comes to my palette."
"Drinkability: I tend to like tripels, and this is no exception. Flavor is nice, rather middle-of-the-road, but the feel is out of this world so I'll gladly finish this bottle and wish I had another around."
"Bottle at Chaucer's Pub- Pours a hazed yellowy orange with a huge froth of white foam. Very fruity and yeasty aroma. Lots of apple and pear, white grapes and spicy rose petal. Sweet but almost tart apple and pear flavour profile with spicy yeast, fresh white bread crust and bittering hops to balance. Quite smooth and drinkable given the ABV. I liked it!"
"I only have 1 more trappist brewery to try from, the toughest one."
"D: A very decent tripel... not my favorite of the Trappist entries, but still a very good beer."
"O: Not perfect, but I would be proud to present this to a crowd."
"D - A great Tripel, unique in character profile, from outside Belgium."
"D - Pretty drinkable though the lack of carbonation leaves a lot a cleaning up to do on the palate. A good beer, just not what I expect in a Tripel."
"I am not going to get all into it, but suffice it to say, when you cork beer, you are taking a gamble. This beer was nice in the nose, spice banana, etc. Yet, in there was also wet cave. Look was ok, although carb wasn't big. Taste - FARGIN CORKED. You cannot get past that. Disappointing. Mouthfeel and drinkability are moot at this point."
"Taste: More candy-like bananas, spicy Belgian yeast. Mild bitterness."
"Drinkability is good...goes down smooth, I could have had another 11.2 oz bottle and enjoyed it just as much."
"A dull, straightforward Trappist Tripel which fails to impress. This lacks overall depth and character with a couple of obvious problems."
"Strong estery banana smell on first opening, but the smell evolved in a more complex, fruity, slightly nutty aroma accompanied by a generous blonde head. The pour was medium-to-honey color with modest cloudiness. The taste was exquisite. Fruity, floral, malty and complex, with banana nuts, and peaches. There is a lot going on with this taste, and all of it good in my opinion. subtle aftertaste with almost no hops to note. full, round, though not creamy mouthfeel. flavors evolved as the serving warmed but never got harsh or unbalanced. Could not taste the alcohol in this 8% ABV. I think this may become my favorite Tripel, more complex, more malty than St. Bernardus which I like very much."
"A rather pleasant version of a Tripel, one whose typical (to me, at least) heat kind of puts me off at hello. Not here, as the 16-proof liquor is well-sublimated, and the other flavours do well by their Trappist heritage. Worthy of investigating further, beyond the clutches of a dimly-lit, cramped (if indeed 'smokeless') basement pub, away from the after-show diatribes being spouted way too loudly from the table behind me."
"the drinkability is good and quite balanced. alcohol is present"
"Moving on from their Dubbel, the Tripel packs more punch, more spice and more body. It's a very nice tripel. There's a fair bit of sweetness, and the flavor is nice, but I'm still a bit disappointed by this Trappist brewery. The Trappist designation has little to do with quality, so I probably shouldn't have had as high hopes. At any rate, this beer pours an auburn gold. The liquid is translucent but somewhat hazy. It's actually a very nice color with pretty golden highlights around the edge of the glass. The aroma is full of caramel malt with apricots, vanilla and rum all chiming in. The flavor is similar. There's a phenolic note and the alcohol is well-hidden. I'm a little disappointed that this beer doesn't pack even more of a punch than the Dubbel, but the Quad is still on deck."
"Pours a clear golden orange with a medium white head. Smell is of fruity esters and alcohol. Taste is sweet malt, a hint of caramel sugar in the middle, and a hint of bitterness from hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Drinkability is good, though for such a light bodied beer, you can taste alcohol. A good example of a Trappist Tripel, but IMO for the money there are better options. Still worth trying for lovers of the style."
"D: This is actually a pretty nice beer, but sadly it got some stiff competion in the style. If you compare it to other trappist beers it's not close, but if you havn't had a tripel or a trappist beer - buy this one."
"The beer was a little darker than I expected for a Tripel. I could smell malt and a little something else that I couldn't quite identify. There was a nice spicy character to the beer, not spicy like cayenne pepper spicy, more like black pepper. The beer had a light feel that the carbonation kept interesting. Easy to drink, no alcohol burning, maybe a little too easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Nice, however, quite simple and somewhat mellow for a tripel, yet very balanced and thus ever so pleasurable in the experience!"
"Overall i think it embodies everything that a good tripel should be strong, drinkable and malty this was a good beer that i highly recommend"
"D: Extremely mellow, I am assuming because of the aging. I quite like the mellowness and think it makes for a very drinkable tripel."
"Alcohol, too, is very very obvious on the mid-to-back palate and it gives this a very stinging, harsh mouthfeel. This flagrant, unbalanced brew is not very drinkable at all, and what's more it has nothing of the flavours of a Tripel. I may have gotten a bad batch, but this is a real disappointment."
"drinkability: just ok"
"Since none of their offerings qualify as a miss, Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven seems to be a 'bulls's eye or outer ring' sort of brewery. Quadrupel and Bockbier are definitely the former. Dubbel and Tripel are the latter. There are too many superior versions out there for me to recommend this one."
"Well worth it. Drink don't cook with this beer, lesson learned."
"The malty flavor is a highlight for me with this one, however, this offering doesn't seem to sit well or comparable within Tripel style."
"I haven't come across the quad of this particular trappist, but I would welcome an opportunity to try it... This trappist, allthough it's actually not bad at all, could use a touch more wild flavours, but it's probably the best option of this brewery, when in fact you're after all the trapists all on itself."
"Drinkability is quite high. Though the alcohol is evident in the flavor profile, there's no heat to it. A restrained and mellow Tripel, and really cheap too. A proper Trappist beer that's only 20c more expensive than some of the worst domestic adjunct lagers? I don't love it, but I can see myself buying more."
"OVERALL: A relatively mild tripel, but certainly an enjoyable brew on its own. Quite drinkable for the strength as well. There are cetainly better tiples out there, but this one is a decent choice. More interesting than their dubbel, this is one I'd pick up again."
"Interesting for the style, easy, er, easier drinking than any other tripel I've ever had."
"The taste is quite complex. Lots of caramels in this beer, a nice slightly boozy floral mix, some liqueur like rind flavors, maybe a touch of orange in there as well. The beer has a slightly different feel and taste with each sip. There is a slightly sour note or two in the beer that complements some of the alcohol soaked fruitiness. The beer is smooth but it does have a tiny bit of a prickly mouthfeel and is well carbonated so this is a sipping type beer; add in the 8% ABV, and this beer is definitely one to drink slowly and savor. Well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"M&D: the carbonation is so fine but also mildly spritzy to contribute to a refreshing palate, while the body remains moderate throughout the drink, never for a second falling thin. Overall, this ""Tripel"" is pleasantly spicy-malty, quite balanced, not so estery and dry as many classic Belgian Tripels but more in line with a good-bodied fruity barley wine. Regardless of any ""strictly-defined"" characters for a Tripel, I have to say this is an enjoyable drink all the same!"
"D: ABV alone will limit drinkability. Full flavor and carbonation take that a bit further."
"Drinkability: It is damn good, I'm not sure how many I could drink, but would definitely grab another after my first."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Notes: Koningshoeven has made a mellow, easy-drinking tripel that was worthy of the price. But, the aforementioned lack of spice and carbonation were a real bummer. I'm thinking that maybe I just got a bad bottle, but what is there definitely warrants a re-try. So, when I do I will update accordingly. Stay tuned"
"A nice deep copper colour with a decent 2 finger head that died a little too quick. Toffe malt, burnt orange and sweet fruits on the nose. Slightly awkward hotness in the mouth but a great long finish with sweet biscuits and butterscotch. A decent tripel and at only $4 a bottle it is easily the best tripel on a budget around these parts."
"D: Not all that drinkable - the peardrop character is too overpowering. More than one and I think it would become annoying. A nice beer to try, but not one to repeat too often."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer, but not great, and considering the expectations that one generally have on Trappist beers, I keep finding myself thinking that it's just ok. It is surprisingly restrained for a Belgian Tripel, and not as complex as many other comparable Trappists. It's simply just not that interesting. Also, considering it's generally restrained character, it tastes slightly to much of alcohol. I'm not saying that it gets boozy - it just lacks some big flavors to back up the alcohol. However, in the end it is still a good tasting beer and I would like especially like to mention the composition of the sweeter components in it since I found them very pleasant."
"D - it's pretty good. it's not my favorite tripel, but i'll drink it."
"D= A good tripel here. This one is darker and more earthy and spicy than many others, but I liked it a lot. Very drinkable and I will have it again for sure."
"D: I just don't enjoy the beer that much nor to I see a scenario where I would buy this beer again. There are much better tripels out there, and the aftertaste doesn't warrant another beer."
"D) Extremely drinkable and would definitely have another but don't feel I could drink it all the time, but absolutely worth trying."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Has a slick texture with lively carbonaion. It is a good beer but not as stand out as I was hoping."
"D - Very good, too good maybe. This is probably one of the sweetest beers I've tried."
"Bright yet fairly crisp mouth feel. Loved drinking this."
"This is the first tripel I've tried, so I don't have a lot to compare to. However, it was a very enjoyable beer; I would recommend trying it."
"Overall: A decent tripel, although i have to admit Tripel is far from my favourite style."
"Mouthfeel - Medium-light body goes down smooth with good carbonation."
"Very solid, as expected, and as I read The Brewmaster's Table, I can't help but think that Garrett was sipping this beer when he wrote his description of a tripel!"
"This wouldn't be bad to keep on hand as a 'go-to' beer. Totally easy to drink."
"D - It's an enjoyable beer, when consumed sparingly. The least interesting tripels of the trappist beers."
"Pours a golden amber wih a thin foamy white head. Fruity aroma consisting of cherries, apple, honey, innamon and alcohol. Sweet tasting with hints of cheries, honey, apple, pear, maltiness and alcohol. A nice balance of sweetness, maltiness and alcohol with a slighlty bitter finish."
"Pours a light reddish-orange and a bit darker than is typical for the style. The two-fingers of light tan head quickly recede amongst a furious activity of bubbles whose popping rises to the ears. A thin very thin sheet of lacing is left and a large amount of tiny pieces of sediment hang in suspended animation. Huge sweet and bready malts rise to the nose upon an initial whiff. A second whiff reveals some oranges, apples, grapefruits and phenols. Tastes obviously malty up front with some bananas, butterscotch, taffy, spices and a faint bitterness to fruition. Mouth-feel is rich, creamy and almost full-bodied, but not quite. There's a definite alcohol heat on the way down, and I'm lovin' it. It has a medium carbonation with the bubbles quickly bursting and receding after a shake. This is another great tripel I must add to an ever growing list of essential revisits."
"All together, this is a very nice beer. I would happily drink more, and it was definitely worth trying. Given the choice, I'd probably go with the Westmalle Tripel or Unibroue's Fin du Monde, but it would seem a toss-up to me between this and Chimay Red (I know, not a Tripel, but I like them about the same, if that says anything useful)."
"D - OK. Kind of a drinkable tripel. Accessible."
"o:fairly drinkable for a tripple. alcohol doesnt hinder the drinkability. very dark for a trippel in color/aroma/flavor and even suggests dark candi syrup. not my favorite trippel but no major flaws."
"Mouthfeel is good, aided by the pinpoint sized carbonation, creating a sense of smoothness. Drink-ability is good for a bottle but is hindered by the aforementioned sweetness when considering a second."
"Its an ok drinkable beer but personally I would rather pick up better belgian tripels then this on"
"Mouthfeel is very carbonated, and drinkability is awesome. I wish I had more."
"Very drinkable for a bigger beer, it would be easy enough to knock a few of these back. I like the fact that there is little residual sweetness to interfere with the drinkability, as well as the fact that the phenolics are mild and add depth as opposed to taking over and distracting from the brew. I would certainly enjoy the opportunity to drink this brew again and recommend it to fans of belgian brews."
"I would highly recommend this beer. I had this bottle at Waagstuk in Antwerp."
"I was happy to have a 750ml sample size of Koningshoeven's Tripel for a couple reasons. For one, I noticed the beer to reveal slightly more later on in the course than it had initially led on. And secondly because it's enjoyable. These things being said, it looked nothing like it should; it smelt nowhere near as good you'd hope; and it was half as pleasant to drink as its Belgian counterparts. Style purists beware... this won't be topping your list."
"This is a very nice Tripel, complex and full of fruit flavor."
"taste was definitely malty. soft on the mouth, invisible alcohol taste. well balanced, quite a nice beer. expected a little more due to hype. it does get much better as it warms up, but nothing standing out saying 'wow'."
"Very enjoyable, a bit too sweet to have the full bottle by yourself."
"Very drinkable tripel. Excellent beer."
"*Side note: I had this beer with an apple pie like dessert. Perfect complement to the sweet sugary apples."
"This has quickly become one of my favorite locally available tripels."
"Notes: Really high on my list of beers but also high on my list for Trappist Ales."
"Opinion: Unfortunately this beer has suffered the test of time. The oxidation and lack of carbonation are really destroying this beer. I would certainly try it again as this is normally a good brewery, but I doubt I will even finish my glass, let alone the bottle."
"Overall, a fairly nice trappist ale, but nothing extraordinary."
"Notes: This reminded me of a cross between a tripel and a saison due to the balance of spices."
"D - Not bad save for the extreme sweetness. This is like eating honey from the comb. This has potential as a dessert beer, but it's not what I would call highly drinkable. Sort of disappointing for a Trappist beer."
""
"Overall - My least favourite Tripel out of the ones I have tried."
"Decent stuff overall."
"overall, this is a fantastic brew, i got it in a make your own 6er at Dennis brothers in Cottage Grove, Mn im glad i did"
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is nice and makes for a great experience. Alcohol is very apparent and could stand to be toned down or masked better. But it doesn't inhibit the experience too much."
"I didn't even know about this trappist brewery and the bottle was only 3 bucks so I thought I'd give it a shot. Different from many tripels but a really tasty brew worth the money."
"Taste of candy, citrus notes, banana and peaches. Not so strong body."
"I really can't say this was a drinkable beer. It's not a good representative of Trappist beer. I was expecting a bit more...a lot more actually. Perhaps I had a bad bottle, or maybe it needed to age a while. Whatever the case, maybe I'll go back to this one day and try it again, but from this first impression it was a big letdown."
"overall a nice brew."
"An interesting beer and an unusual one, the strong flavor and scent of roses dominates this beer. Don't think I will seek this one out again though; the Quadruple is a better beer."
"No surprises in the taste. Perfectly balanced, nice feel, easy to drink. La trappe dubbel and quad were some of my first ever reviews here. And while this purchase was not a disappointment, I just think some other tripels made much more of an impression on me than this one. Fun to get the fancy bottle ..."
"Drinkability: I like this beer, very drinkable."
"Overall: great beer. I personally prefer the La Trappe Dubbel, but this one is highly enjoyable and quite complex."
"D - Wouldn't be my first choice of tripel but a pretty good beer nonetheless."
"Complex, fruity taste, with a mild hint of clove. The ""flat"" feel of this beer takes some getting used vs other tripels, but the distinctiveness helps make it addictive. This is a standby beer when I'm staying in Holland."
"I tried this beer on January 17, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer poured a dark translucent golden brown with a thin tan head. The aroma consisted of sweet malt and vanilla. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was sweet malt, plums, a little caramel, and a little vanilla."
"D: It has a very clean taste and is very easy to drink. It does have a decent amount of alcohol that would keep it from being a session beer."
"Overall, different than most other trappist trippels because of the spices. Great companion to my mussels. Once again, I'm impressed with La Trappe."
"T&M&D-Sweet and doughy upfront giving into layers of fruit (primarily banana) and spices. The malt is present enough to give it some backbone, and there is a nice balance between sweetness, spiciness, and dryness. The body is medium and carbonation is quite strong. Very creamy, smooth, and drinkable. High in alcohol but it doesn't shine through the flavor."
"D = This is a tasty, wonderful beer to drink. Highly recommend it."
"Mouthfeel typical Belgian tripel"
"Good mouthfeel, and very good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is like the typical Belgian tripel with the candy sugar providing the unearthly feel. Not the first tripel I'd reach for, but one worth a try. Worked well with pesto and shrimp pasta."
"This poured a hazy beige with only a little white head. It smelled like most other triples - honey wheat and apricot. It tasted much the same, with hints of ginger and some citrus hops bitterness. It was smooth and oily with very little carbonation, and had a mild but lasting aftertaste. Overall this was a typical beer for its style; nothing special."
"D: Easy and clean, just remember it's a tripel."
"NOTE: My wife, a BMC die-hard, loved this beer. A true surprise for me and a possible convert for us."
"This beer is a mostly clear orange-amber color with a medium thick off-white head that dissipates slowly. Thin spotty rings of lacing. The aroma contains yeast, malt, sour fruit and light spices. Medium-bodied with a nice spice/yeast character. Flavors of tart fruit, candi sugar, peppery spices and yeast are all present. The finish is fruity and yeasty and leaves a mild herbal hops aftertaste. This beer is enjoyable from start to finish."
"Nicely drinkable, the creamy mouthfeel and rich full mouth make this one a real pleasure to drink."
"Poured into a snifter. This tripel pours an amber color with more of an orange hue. Bright white head, with nice retention of about a quarter of an inch, which leads to nice lacing. Aromas of bananas, clove, nutmeg, honey and high alcohol esters. Taste is rather similar to the aromas but with some others thrown in there, bananas, raisins, clove and nutmeg are the leads. No hoppy characteristics at all. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean, very mellow as well, with a mild carbonation level. I prefer other tripels but this is very nice, and drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"me bottle said Koningshoeven Tripel so i think this is right.. Pours a brown almost amber colour..nice respectable head, great lacing .. Smells tart, like a port wine - syrup wine mix. has ample body. quite sweet. has some (good bitter) fruitiness in the taste (plums). Not bad really, not as ""tripel"" or ""trappist"" as some others but a fine beeer indeed. warms u up alittle!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a hazy, golden yellow-orange color with a huge effervescent head that crackles like rice krispies. The smell is not overwhelming, but is fruity, spicy, phenolic and there is a hint of alcohol. The taste is smooth, well balanced between the fruity malty sweetness and the bitterness of spice and alcohol. Excellent! The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy, non-dense carbonation. Drinks like a light beer, very drinkable. Wish that I had a few more of these lying around."
"I'm possible one of the few who doesn't get the Belgian thing. I drink them often enough but they just don't put the wind in my sails. A friend brought some around so I wasn't expecting to be overly excited but this one just seemed so well balanced and drinkable. The beautiful orange/copper appearance and spicy aroma were good omens and to my surprise, the taste was not as massive as I expected for 8% ABV. The malt is pronounced but not dominant and there was a nice spiciness from the coriander and banana cake notes. The alcohol is well disguised so there's not the booziness you often get with big beers. As a result, this has a champagne body and mouthfeel with a spice and malt dimension. Very impressed."
"D - This is a nice tripel. I really enjoy their beers."
"An absolute amazing trappist-trippel... Koningshoeven did amazingly well with this one... terffific dark-brown, mahogany appearance depicted a prune-colored hue with strong molasses, fig, and a prune aroma... Amazing rich, and creamy caramel taste boasting candied dark, brown sugars, vanilla, honey, and an amazing conglomeration of thick, unforgettable flavors... a very different take on the usual triple - especially due to the hefty combination of ultra-rich, super-thick flavors that really hit home... one of the better tripels that I have ever sampled... all of this brewery's beers are top-notch, and their triple is certainly an above-and-beyond rendition of the style, one of the best I've come across... excellent stuff... Good, rich, creamy mouthfeel with relatively easy drinkability, even for an 8% ABV... Definitely recommended... As a side-note, this is an exteremley malty triple... almost akin to a dubbel to the tremendous amount of malts used in its production... very rich and sugar-laden with a noticeable sugar-sweet flavor..."
"Koningshoeven Tripel pours two full fingers of white head on a copper body. The smell is underwhelming, unfortunately, though it emits some fruit and mild yeast aromas. The taste is far better, and redeeming after the disappointing smell. Lots of fruit--orange, cherry, apple and apricot--good yeast, and a dash of spice make this delectable. The mouthfeel is good, balanced between moderately carbonated and a tad syrupy smooth, making this all in all a very good Tripel well worth buying. I'd like to see this a little bolder in smell and in flavor in general, but it's hard to complain about what is clearly a quality tripel."
"D- This is a heavy brew but I enjoy it. I could certainly have a few glasses of this."
"The color is dark golden and almost orange. The beer pours with an inch of foam which dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is fruity sweetness with a mixture of yeast and citrus. The beer slides across the palate with noticeable carbonation and medium body. The taste is sweet and fruity with accents of peach. The finish is again fruity; the dryness of alcohol also comes through."
"Drinkability? Well, it feels like I'm drinking an unbaked loaf of sourdough bread....not exactly my beer preference. I will definitely buy Chimay and other trappist beers before I purchase this variety of Koningshoeven."
"This is the first tripel I ever tried, and at first it was too much for me. Now I see this as a rather mellow tripel which makes me realise how far my tasted have evolved. About average for a Belgian, which makes it pretty good for a beer in general. Good value too as it is clearly the cheapest tripel available in Australia."
"Pours a slightly hazed amber brown with a tan head. Nose is the typical Belgian yeast with a touch of sweetness, but seems to be pretty weak. Flavor is smooth with a sweet start. On the end I got a bit of a metallic edge, which I cant say I appreciated too much. Feel is standard. Typical stuff. Its definitely drinkable. I consider this more of the type of brew that neither tries to stand out far ahead of the crowd or is too immature to be crap. Smooth and even. Its a balanced brew. It wont blow your socks off, but it is even enough to keep you satisfied."
"A very good if not world class triple that I am very glad made its way to Boise."
"bière blonde ambrée assez foncé et trouble, la mousse blanche est très diffuse et disparait rapidement, nez sucré, malté, épicé, assez invitant. bouche piquante, épicée, petit goût d'alcool, bonne bière de type tripel, mais moins bonne que la maredsous 10."
"D - I could have kept drinking this one. If I'd had another bottle of it onhand, I'd have stuck with this one for an extended flight."
"On tap at BeerBistro. Pours a clear golden, thin white head forms, very big bubbles, thin ring sticks to the sides of the glass, some lace spots are left. Smell is sweet, honey, yeast, some citrus, fruits, apricot, some alcohol, nice. Taste is apples, yeast, caramel, some wheat, sugary, alcohol, some floral, spicy bitterness in the finish, quite nice. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. Nice example of a tripel, solid bitterness compared to most, very smooth, nicely done."
"drinkability is good. no alcohol is present, with a smooth mouthfeel and well proportioned aroma and taste. a refreshing belgian. cheers!"
"Very drinkable, and great example of the style."
"Brought this out of my beer cellar to enjoy this past weekend. The bottle was purchased in Amsterdam, and was stamped best when enjoyed by 12-2007. Poured into two La Trappe goblets. There was hardly any head, which leads me to believe I aged this one perhaps a bit too long. The color was an extremely deep golden amber, not as much yellow as with other tripels. The taste was was good, with a nice spice and bread quality to it. But the lack of carbonation somewhat turned me off. The alcohol was very present, as I was surprised it was only 8%. This was a decent tripel, but I was a bit let down. Probably could have drank it earlier, so the lower scores might be my fault. I'd return to the dubbel again before going back to this tripel though."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced. sort of like the witte, it isn't quite as assertive as other examples of the style, but it's still very interesting and enjoyable. definitely looking forward to having this one again."
"This beer is true to the style, but there are other examples I would prefer."
"Initially it's rather dry on the tongue, with spicy, peppery citrus flavors. Malt comes out more as it warms, giving it a tropical fruit character. Nice balance between sweet and dry notes; it's not overly syrupy. Medium-bodied with well-hidden alcohol. A solid tripel."
"I like this one a lot. Not something I'd drink everyday, but something I would save for special occasions."
"Drinkability : une bonne bière Hollandaise de type triple"
"D: Decent. The KH quad is better."
"Trappist beer from Holland, this should be excellent. Slightly hazy orange with an especially strong aroma of fruits, slight alcohol and sweet candy; I really like this smell. The taste is complex, spicy, fruity, very good. This is a very nice tripel."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Again the body is much fuller than I expected, with what I find to be low carbonaion. Just doesn't feel right for the style. More carbonation, lighter body, and overall more balance between spiciness and malt sweetness would make this a much better brew. I don't think that I'll buy this again. To me, overall this brew just seems average, nothing to write home about. Not bad, but nothing spectacular either. Its on par, (to me it could seem cloying b/c I've not drank one of these styles in quite a while...) Would rather drink Chimay White over this brew."
"d: first time out wasn't so high on this one, but subsequent tastings have won me over."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a deep reddish gold color with a moderate amount of creamy tan head to start with, which fades away to pretty much nothing fairly quickly. Smells sweet and spicy, hints of raisins and plum. There's also some yeast aroma there as well. The taste is also sweet and spicy, lots of malt, some plum, a little pear, lots of banana. Just enough bitterness to finish pretty clean for a tripel. Mouthfeel is tingly and heavy with some creaminess when you swallow. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, especially if you love belgians like I do."
"A fine tripel."
"Too fizzy, then watery. Swirling renders it smooth and creamy, but it still finishes like sugar water. Nothing too undrinkable about it apart from the unbalanced sweetness and simplicity of it, but I didn't finish the bottle."
"The body is medium. Fairly crisp from the carbonation. A bit of an alcohol burn with a light bitterness in the finish. Could stand to be a little bit drier with less candi sugar. Not bad, but could be a little bit more drinkable."
"Notes: Ehhhh...It very well be a good tripel but it missed my palate and thats all I have to go by."
"for any situation"
"Very good and quite a nice drinking beer, but it doesn't have the magic that the best belgians possess. The taste centers around the candi sugar sweetness with no grain-like flavors apparent and occasional hints of cream and vanilla. Still pretty tasty and no alcohol flavor to slow you down."
"Poured into a wide-mouth chalice, this is a hazy peach-colored beer with a small but lasting head. Decent lacing as well. Rich fruity nose, sweet, with a ripe citrusy aroma accompanying it. Very light malt flavor together with a lot of fruity yeast character (grapefruit, maybe mango). Hoppy bitterness dries things out quite nicely. Body is light for the strength, with a pleasant effervescence."
"Mouth: Flavor is not as tart as the aroma, lots of alcohol, banana, yogurt even, very malt forward, not a whole lot of hop balance. Lingering acidic flavor, makes my mouth water continuously. Apples, caramel, toffee. Tasty, though not what I normally think of as a trippel, more like a Belgian blond... Nicely carbonated all the way through the mouth, full and sparkly."
"Recommended. A nice tripel, worthy of drinking for a nicer occasion."
"Nothing out of this world, but enjoyable and I'm sure I'll have it again."
"Overall: No doubt my least favorite of the Koninghoeven offerings Ive tried, its a different take on the tripel, being more malty and without the usual spiciness Ive come to expect. Since there was no date, its possible that I got a couple of older bottles that didnt age well. I tried pairing it with sirloin steak but as I expected, it proved too light, but it did pair nicely with a freshly baked honey-drenched biscuit. Worth a try."
"(P.S. It was just the bottle. The next bottle I had didn't have the strange skunky smell, so I would have given it 4.0. I am pleased, because S = 3.5 was generous for the one reviewed above.)"
"Poured in a hazy, honey-yellow colour and a finger of nice, thick head. Smelling like green, sour apples, yeast and a hint of caramel. The taste was sweet and fruity with notes of yeast, alcohol, coke and bananas. It had a full but perhaps a bit restrained body and was quite carbonated for a Tripel. But after a while, when most of the bubbles had disappeared, the fruitiness came forward."
"Taste starts out with sugary candy malt with a lightly toasted edge. Fruity flavors emerge: fruit cocktail, strawberry, banana, and pears. Some bubblegum and yeast. Spicy hops and light peppery bitterness in the finish help dry it out a little, but there is plenty of leftover warming sugary fruit. Medium body with a soft, almost soapy feel. Nice carbonation levels. Not bad, but there are much better Tripels out there."
"Drinkable."
"The pour into my Chimay glass raises a thin soda like head that quickly fizzes away with a great din (for a beer, that is). Lacing is very splotchy and thin. The body is a hazy brown, with golden highlights at the edges of the glass. Quite dark for a tripel. The nose is spicy, herbal, acidic, and has a strong apple cider note. The taste seems to indicate that it might be going bad, with possibly a bit of vinegar creeping in. But, it has a nice caramel thing going on too, and some of the herbal notes from the nose. Pretty weak overall, though. The mouth is a tad thin, and too fizzy. Not absurdly bad, but one of the worst tripels I've had."
"Purchased: Park Lane Liquors, Lancaster CA"
"Pours quite dark for a tripel (maybe this is a house characteristic for Koningshoeven; their blond was pretty dark, too), with a thin, delicate head that leaves just tiny bits of lace. Aromas are predominantly honey-sweet, but there's a touch of sulphur and peaches. Very well balanced in flavors, with some light sweetness squaring off against healthy amounts of hop bitterness. Pear fruits come toward the end, along with a bubble-gum and clove combination. Mouthfeel is just medium, with sharp carbonation -- typical for the style. Overall, this is a hefty tripel but a good one -- all the flavors are pretty well balanced, and most of them are interesting even by themselves, without playing together as well as they do here."
"Purchased a 750 ml bottle at Sams, chilled and poured into watuo goblet. Nice one finger creamy white head, which dissipates into a film and leaves thin lacing. The body has a slight hazy rose character to it, except with more amber tones, blond highlights, and visible carbonation sustaining the head. To the fore of the scent are juice cut pear, plum and apple esters supported by a mix of banana and apricot. Hints of spice maybe coriander, clove and a slight yeast character. Taste wise this strike me as rather creamy, with lots of smooth esters jumping on the flavor ride. All the same fruits come into play, I get the pear and plum, with yeasty notes, a touch of coriander and a noticeable bit of carbonation. Hops as expected are not really noticeable, they just provide support for the esters and malts. This is tasty as far as I am concerned, its not my favorite tripel, but its got some of the character of my favorite tipels, and its lands just under being cloying. If it was around Id drink it and or buy it again. Worth trying for sure."
"Damn, I would choose a true trappist tripel over this any day!"
"Pours an ice tea color, with yeast flecks that seem to be suspended in the liquid. Has a nice tan head that dissipated to a slight cap, leaving spotty lacing. Smells of spiced fruit, plums, raisins. The taste is a bit musty, spicy, dark fruit, different from the Beligian tripels. The feel is a bit fizzy, slick. An enjoyable tripel but definitely not the best that I have had however that wouldn't stop me from getting this again."
"Based on my 7 or 8 experiences with this tripel, it's best served with only a slight chill on. Its unique take on the style stands apart from the Belgian Trappists, yet it's completely worthy of standing in their company. Wonderful stuff."
"Overall. It is pretty enjoyable, but considering all the other tripels available, i would put this in the lower half (but that is really more a compliment to all the other great tripels out there than a shot at this beer, plus it's cheaper than most). I will get this again and enjoy it then as well."
"Poured a murky , brownish orange , with a small layer of whitish foam for a head. The aroma is yeasty , a bit sweet with fruity notes , slight banana and citrus/ pineapple , even a hint at coconut oil. The taste is a fresh and yeasty mix of sweet malts , mild fruity flavor , some tartness near the powdery dry finish. Hops flavors balance the sweet malt with a slight spicyness. Also just a little bit of phenolic touch. A lightly carbonated mouthfeel , dry finish. I found it to be quite drinkable , just a little less complex than alot of tripels that iv'e had. The nose however was quite complex imo. Worth a try."
"Taste is caramel and malty, with spices and fruits, banana, cinnamon, apricots and some gumballs. There is a medium bitterness and mouthfeel is slightly sticky."
"Final notes - Not a beer for me. I am glad I tried it. It's good to have a reference. But the sweetness and especially that Honey taste just killed it for me."
"This is quite a great Tripel, maybe not the best but pretty darn good. Ther is much going on this. I think I may have another."
"Solid brew altogether. I didn't hold out much hope for this one, I don't know why. Always nice to have a pleasant surprise. Good stuff."
"Koningshoeven doesn't dissapoint."
"Wonderful spicy complexity, sweetness & length. Could not drink more than two, I think."
"Notes: I found this beer to be very pleasant. It has a nice range of flavors and is very easy to drink. I feel this brewery is underrated."
"Overall - A pretty good tripel... there are better examples out there but it's certainly worth a try..."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Color was a dirty copper brown, like a cider. A lot of small flecks of yeast sediment. A small tan head that quickly recedes with no lacing to speak of. Smell has plenty of fruity esters, I'm sensing apples. Taste follows smell. Sweet fruityness. Not a whole lot of bitterness, more sweet malt. Mouthfeel is warm, tiniest hint of alcohol. There is a surprisingly crisp carbonation when compared to the near total lack of head. This is a nice sipper, just not so nice to look at."
"The drinability is high. Multiple bottles could easily be consumed in a sitting. A very enjoyble ale overall from the Dutch."
"Purchased in one of those criminal 30 cl eurobottles I served this beer to myself a tad too cold. Recommended is around 10 °C but fortunately it slowly warmed. The very thin head with fine bubbles was persistent. The color a beautiful clear amberish yellow. I clearly smelled alcohol, and betwixt the sweetness an very distinct odor I couldn't place. Drinking it brought a light fizziness and again alcohol and sweetness. A hint of coriander but not the odor. Instead some bitterness. A pleasant beer to enjoy."
"Good beer, but I have not had a lot of Tripel's as of yet."
"Overall, a good, nice drinking beer. Quite refreshing. Suprisingly good bite to it. Certainly not a great tripel, but well worth drinking."
"Koningshoeven Tripel pours a hazy iced tea color with a thin off white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. Aroma has hints of pear, toffee and a little bit of alcohol. Malty taste up front followed by fruitier flavors such as pear. Interesting, definitely different from the other tripels I've had. Most definitely worth a try."
"I'm not sure what to take away from this one. It isn't the best smelling beer and it is certainly not a session drink like some lighter tripels. That aside, I'd like to have another if I didn't have to smell it."
"Drinkability: Overall a nice affordable Trappist beer that you might be able to enjoy on a regular basis."
"I think this is a great beer for the price but falls into lower middle as far as the authentic trappist breweries are concerned. A great beer and very drinkable."
"Bottle: Poured a deep orangey color ale with a nice light brown head with good retention. Aroma of candy with sweet malt is totally irresistible. Taste is also dominated with this sweet malt presence with a subtle mix of spice in the background. Alcohol is very well hidden but body is definitely too thin, which seems to be a characteristic of this brewery."
"Pours a darker redish-orange with a fruity nose. Mmm smells good and tastes just as good. Grape flavor with a little bit of alcohol and hops hit you up front followed by caramel and pear flavors towards the end. A very tastey beer that I would not mind drinking lots of. Easier to drink than similar beers but still a beer that you will want to sip and take in the flavor, especially with the higher alcohol content. I could drink a lot of this easily. I am quite liquored up now and have moved onto my congnac, but this is quite good. I wouldn't mind buying a bottle or two again."
"There are aspects in this beer that I hadn't identified by the time my glass ran dry, and I'm looking forward to discovering what I'll uncover the next time."
"Pours a deep orange colour brushed with burnt sienna highlights. The nose is very much blood oranges and yeasty goodness. Compared to the Quad this is more fruity and softer on the finish. The complexity of the beer is apparent as a couple of sips add up in the back of the palate. Too bad this never shows up in BC."
"I always like this beer, and I'd recommend it to anyone."
"Drinkability: Above average drinkability but would not want to drink too many of these. I have had better tripels."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet. Bright orange amber color, fairly clear on the first pour with just some small specks of sediment, a thin off-white head that persists as a whispy cap. No lacing. Taste is a mix of sweet candi sugar and fruity apple/mango/pineapple with a slightly acidic winey note. Taste is a sweet honey malt with a nice yeasty taste and with some fruity raisin and apple flavors. Finish is a slightly spicey mild hop note. Perfectly fine tasting tripel, not the best but from from bad. Mouthfeel is light and creamy and smooth just like a tripel should be. A little disappointing for a Trappist, but overall a real solid beer."
"A Trappist beer that's not Belgian...innnteresting. Corked and caged 765 ml bottle, pours with much yeasty goodness, a haze-infused orange with a well-retaining white seafoam head. Floaties are everywhere. Fruity esters abound in the nose, with a floral hop bite, strong notes of banana, milder notes of pineapple and clove. More hoppy than spicy, with a rounded malt profile to balance the spice and fruit. Not super-complex, but nicely balanced. Alcohol only engages itself slightly on the palate; among Tripels I'd consider this one that could easily be sipped in a larger quantity, though still a sipper nonetheless. Really enjoying this one, and I'm quite tempted to find some cheese to pair this with, as I can imagine a delicious pairing. Actually...yeah I'm going to get some cheese."
"Notes: smooth and mild trippel"
"D - Interesting smell aside, this is a good example of a slightly above average Tripel that could be so much more. But try telling that to an Abbey of monks that have been brewing for ages..."
"I feel the warming alcohol but feel like I missed out on getting there."
"Drinkability and Overall: The first beer I've had from this brewery and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to have more. I had trouble swallowing the fact that this brewery is now a trappist, but so far they deserve that name. Try it."
"330 ml bottle, bought in Denmark. Pours with an enormous head. Colour is deep golden to brown (amber), slightly hazy. Very nice aroma of fresh and dried fruits, spices, oak and exotic wood. Flavour is slightly spicy and peppery on a malty sweet basis with brown sugar and oaky elements. Not bad this one."
"A good Trappist without paying the high prices. This beer pours a darker amber or brown than most Tripples. Has the ordinary carbonation and persistent head. Smells caramelly, spicy, fruity, nutty, and alcoholic. Tastes much the same with adding plumbs, dates, almonds, along with malty caramels, toffee, and malt. Medium to full body that hides behind tingly carbonation. Bubbles play on the palate and accentuate the alcohol. finishes dry and mildy sweet and fruity. The better of the beers by La Trappe. Well balanced and presented."
"The taste was good although not spectacular. fruity and tangy, with a nice bitter way to end things mixed with a comfortable alcohol feel at both mouth and nose. Full bodied and well carbonated, passes off as a thirst quencher or a strong beer anytime (for me)."
"Clearly a lovingly crafted creation."
"Taste is at first the alcohol, then caramelish with some note of fruits, spicy, actually the spices come finish the beer."
"Mouthfeel is nice, maybe just a tich too watery, and quite drinkable- for 8%, the alcohol isn't overpowering or too present, which is nice. Very tasty beer. I would buy this again."
"I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these at a sitting, and would recommend starting with a milder alcohol tasting beer."
"Drinkable? Sure if you like a mess of a Tripel. I dont. I cant see myself drinking this beer again. Of course, I could forget Ive drunk this in three or four years and try it again (doh!). I hope not. I purchased my 750ml bottle in Parkville, MO for $3. I got ripped off."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light, with exaggerated carbonation of medium bubbles. Texture is smooth and quite airy on the tongue."
"orangy amber color and as my girlfreind commented, ""that looks really carbonated."" she was right. didnt notice to much of a head. smell kinda tinges my nose with alcohol flavors and grassy hay ntoes. also a bit of apples and apricots. grape nteos oddly are the first thing i noticed on my tounge. belgiany sugary taste. nothing outstanding original but solid and well crafted. very drinkable. alcohol content never comes into play except in the smell."
"Pours a beautiful dark ruby with a nice creamy head, good retention as well as lacing. Hearty carbonation. When I take a quick whiff, though, oh my god! The alcohol astringency was very present in the nose from the get go. It smelled more like a flavored vodka or rum than a beer. So, what the heck, I try a nice mouthful anyway. As cold as my fridge would make it, the brew was drinkable. It had a complex taste pattern with various hops, fruits, caramels. They were rather subdued to the frigidness. I did let it warm up slightly, but the super alcoholness soon became apparent. It was more like medicine at that point. Mouthfeel was smooth with some nice butterscoth notes disregarding the alcohol astringency."
"poured as a hazy orange-amber color with moderate attractive head that slowly dissapeared. The nose was typical of this style of beer. The taste was disappointing after everything I had heard about it though it did improve as it warmed. It was a drinkable trippel as the alcohol was weel hidden"
"Pours a medium golden amber, slightly hazy, with a large coarse head that fades pretty quickly. Left some lace behind. Aroma is sweet, lightly malty, with fruity and spicy notes. Taste is slightly bready, alcohol notes apparent. Fruity... maybe grape and a little banana as it warms. Peppery finish. Mild butterscotch aftertaste. Better than I thought it woud be!"
"While not an overly good tripel, this one is decent. Pours with a huge head of foam into the Koningshoeven glass. Foam subsides to a delicate head on the top. The smell is typical Belgian candi and a whiff of spices. Unfortunately, this one loses on taste. I think I just don't like their house yeast. It's grassy, sharp, or perhaps they do strange hop or spicing additions in all their beers.. Decent for a tripel, but too sharp and just this side of being overly carbonated."
"the beer that introduced me to tripels and continues to be a beer closet staple"
"A great tasting beer but it does need some refinement."
" Maybe I will go back to the Frugal and buy this one to try out 5 years from now; the smells are very renemiscent of a trappist beer mixed with a barleywines smells trying to break through, still in the maturing process, but just about there. Good beer to drink while frozen rain is chilling the outside."
"Pours a three-finger head that leaves a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation. Medium bodied. Nose is alcohol, starts with some harshness of alcohol, finish is on the sour side not what I was expecting with a triple, their dubbel and quadrupel are better. 750ml bottle for $6.99 from Hoosick St. Discount Bev, Troy, NY."
"Light amber brown white head that falls quickly. Aroma lightly sweet sugary light fruit grapes apples on light malt with some alcohol presence. Taste is light malt candy like fruitiness light carbonation enhances the candy like sweetness finishes fruity and sweet with warming alcohol felt but not tasted. Mediumish mouthfeel. Drinkability is ok little to sweet for my taste but not to bad overall."
"The third beer had on La Trappe night... not as good as the dubbel or the enkel, but left me really eager to try the quadrupel. Which turned out to be the best of the lot... and I am sure it was more than the already warm and fuzzy glow I had going that led me to that determination."
"Basically an average tripel, but solid for style. I preferred their dubbel, in terms of overall drinkability and character."
"The 11.2 ouncer I tried said ""Koningshoevan Tripel", the label is otherwise identical to the one shown in the photo, maybe some new labeling going on...anyway this tasty treat poured an amber cloudy color, white head, a fair amount of yeasty sediment in the bottle. Leaves not much lace, nose is nutty and yeasty. Rounded body, nice clove notes,spicy and and more nutty flavors. Pleasant tripel, went well with a few nuts and some bread and cheese."
"Drinkability: A very approachable tripel that strikes a lot of the right notes"
"Had this at Smokeless Joe's in Toronto, complete with the proper Koningshoeven chalice, which has a nice look to it. It poured darker than the Tripels I have seen, with a small amount of head, perhaps a little too cold. Aroma of cheeries, other fruits, and caramel apples. Tasted strongly of butterscotch, caramel, and bananas, with a nice smooth finish. It has a surprisely light mouthfeel for such a rich beer, and was dangerously drinkable. I think some poeple would find this too sweet, but I enjoyed this only Trappist tripel from outside Belgium."
"Basically I found this to just be a great middle of the road triple. No flavors fly in your face, none are missing. Its simply perfectly in balance and very drinkable. It doesnt stand out, but maybe thats what makes it such a great beer. Simply a perfect exactly of the style."
"Hazy white with an orange tint. Mid-sip coriander spice. Almost as good as the quad. Medium wheat grain and creme mouthfeel."
"This one pours a golden orange color with minimal head. The nose is very fruity, I get banana and a zesty lemon. I like the smell, but I'm not sure of it for this style. The fruityness is there in the flavor, but the malt and alcohol are pretty strong. Those flavors are all there, but there is no real harmony in them. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and a little creamy as well. With the lack of balance, the drinkability suffers. Its not a bad beer, but not the best I have ever had. I like it better than the dubbel, but I'd still pik other beers over this one."
"Pours an amber/orange color with a small head that quickly disappears. Sweet aroma. Fruity and maybe some caramel. The flavor is sweet like the nose with some fruityness. Spicy too. Alcohol is obvious and the strong malts are not as well balanced as I feel they should be. This was an ok beer, but I think it could be better."
"*Sidenote. Same brewery, different beer. I wasn't sure if BA was going to ""rollover"" this beer's credentails after branding issues."
"Notes: They have this beer at a local grocery store, I pick it up on occasion but I don't know if anyone else is buying it. I have no idea how long the bottles have been there, but I suspect that they're not brewery fresh. In fact, I suspect that they're fairly old and that the age has given this beer a lot of character. I intend on cellaring a few of these and see how they turn out in a few years."
"Very accessible and unlikely to offend sweet-toothed novices, this beer is just lacking the wild, memorable charm of a qualityTrappist-style beer. Still, considering how easy it is to drink, why rant?"
"Overall Impression: So happy with this little windfall. The case seems to have been treated well, and I may put a few bottles back for a bit more maturing. High points are a full rich flavor and aroma. Down sides would be hard to find, but appearance and drinkability are closer to average. A solid tripel in my book."
"Fantastic session brew for me.... fruity, malty and a very good Belgian Trippel. Alcohol hidden well, slightly sweet and fruity, with tons of malt. Slight hop notes. Very smooth and highly quaffable! I would recommend this to anyone wishing to try a Belgian style beer without getting into the heavy hitters too soon."
"Smooth as silk, light carbonation. A great body; it just floats in the mouth. A delightful treat which is thoroughly enjoyed."
"This beer has a very balanced flavor and is great for repeat drinking."
"This was an interesting tripel. Poured out a dark amber color with a nice amount of carbonation. Looked a little darker than some other tripels out there. Smell consisted of fruits and nutty aromas. Taste was good. Nice and crisp. Lots of fruits in there, plums, grapes, some apple perhaps. It's also more fruitier than other tripels on the market. Pretty nice brew. It has a lot of character and it's full-bodied. Worth seeking out."
"Beautiful appearance: a very dense and fine head on a orange copper hazy body. Nice aromas of ripe bananas and citrus. The taste is very fruity: ripe bananas, almost with an artifical candy flavor, and mostly grapefruit. The hops are well hidden, and add a subtle floral note to the brew. The mouthfeel is very smooth and round, but gets dry and citric on the end, as the alcohol gets more noticeable. An enjoyable tripel."
"As far as I know, this was one of the last bottles of this beer sold in the United States after the brewery closed some time ago. Presented in a 750ml bottle with wire-caged champagne cork. Pours a brilliant golden amber with a huge off-white creamy head. Big aroma of banana and apricot that hits from several feet away. Closer sniffing reveals clove, and a hint off-key mustiness that makes me think I may have let this one sit just a little too long. Beautiful carbonation - the tiny champagne bubbles just keep on coming. Buttery, creamy body is as close to perfection as I can imagine. Palate holds light, sweet fruit, brown sugar, bubble gum, and a hint of amaretto. Nice, sweet finish, with very little aftertaste. An absolutely amazing beer, I'm sad to see this one go."
"12oz Bottle with some date code I can't understand Poured a cloudy reddish orange with sizable head that falls flat yet leaves scattered lacing. Aroma has a candy like sweetness to it with some fruit and yeast adding to the mix. Mouthfeel is crisp with carbonation and medium bodied. The flavor is on the sweet side with a peppery spicy note added to the sugary sweetness. Overall not my favorite Tripel but a decent one just the same."
"Okay for sipping, not one I'd want to put away a ton off. A little too sweet without really distinguishing itself in any other way."
"From the pour the brownish-orange color attracted me that along with the light foamy head that remained on top throughout the glass. This ale had one of the fruitiest smells I have ever experienced, definite hints of apples with another smell I just can't put my finger on. To me this is where the outstanding parts of this drink end. The start is very wet and underhopped, for my taste anyway. The middle is borderline tart with a finish almost like that of apple juice. This is a fine beer, just not one of my favorites."
"A golden amber pour with a medium but rich white head. The nose is smei-sweet with bubblegum hints and a noticeable yest quality. Light fruit notes as well. The taste is well balance with once again the bubblegum sweetness and light fruit notes....did i detect a pinch of coconut?...anyway, the taste reminds me somewhat of Leffe Blond, based on memory. The mouthfeel is very smooth and full. Lots of lively bubbles the whole way through with a dry-ish finish. An easy drinker but not overly complex or fullfilling."
"Biggish, light creamy/tan-colored, coarse head. Thin arcs and spotty lacing. Dark, orangey/amber beer. The smell is sweet, malty, a touch corky with a little sugar. Alcohol obvious in the front poking through the caramel. Thick malt in the middle: sweet, creamy. Dry finish; some tartness/sourness. This is very tasty, but short of the quad."
"Not a real impressive pour here kind of hazy deep orange with almost no head to speak of,the aroma is somewhat winey and spicey with some light apple notes.Tjhid one hefty triple here very rich tasting some deep wine noted and very yeasty tasting with some sharp spiciness.One of the harshest triples I hav had in quite awhile although thats not a total bad thing."
"Smooth on the tongue. Slight dryness experienced after swallowing. The malt flavor lasts for a minute or so too. Definitely drinkable. The alcohol level is not very noticable compared to other Belgian Tripels."
"Overall a fine Belgian triple."
"Poured a slightly hazy peach - sediment on the bottom of the bottle was tight, so I was able to get a very clean decant. Flavor is soft, some suggestion of honeydew melon, with a sharp, carbonated acidity that balances well. Not a lot of depth to the flavor profile, but overall it is quite pleasant."
"Nice somewhat hazy golden orange color, competently sized off white head, with oodles of fine lace. Ripe fruit aromas like pineapple, and over ripe banana dominate the nose with malt tones underlying it all. Start is ambrosial, reedy top, slightly tart, middling carbonation with a masterful hop spicy bite, the aftertaste dry and also a lingering tartness through the drink."
"Nice opaque deep golden darkened yellow color, a lighter peachy tone that has lots of little floaty things suspended in its haze. Small whitish head thats loose and fluffy and fades pretty fast and lace is in drippy strings and spots. Smell is a subdued mellow mix of very dulled melons and lemon with some yeasty grab and a nice spicyness and alcoholic warmth over lays. Taste is quite quenchingly yummy and mellowing. Nice mild citrus of dullish lemon, melons, and dried orange and apricot all have a certain impressionable mix and lightly souring tartness kick thats mostly upfront. Hops add to the boost some, then it begins to fade some as it reaches farther past midway. Just after midway it mellows out with some spicyness and lingering lightly into the finish with some malty chewyness and more dulled citrus mix. Solid medium body feel with some creamyness at first, picking up a small surge on its way to a mellowing smooth and lightly chewy sweet finish. Not overly complex but very enjoyable, a nice drinkable thickness and lush feeling as it begins to warm after half a glass or so. Makes for a nice relaxing glass full of delight."
"This triple pours a respectable full head that diminishes quickly, but leaves a creamy lace that maintains to the end (clinging slightly). Its tones are a rose gold with a hazy translucence. The aroma is of malt and caramel, with a distinctive freshness that hints of melon. An exceptional balance of sweet and bitter with a slightly dry finish. Not overwhelming and not boring."
"A hazy, deep marmalade body is topped by a creamy head of off-white foam. The retention is excellent, and it maintains a creamy 1/2"" surface covering throughout the entire goblet; and leaves short walls of lace that drop with the level of the beer (but don't stick!). The aroma displays a clean, lightly honeyish malt that's accentuated by a light fruitiness and gently floral background hops. In the mouth it's creamy and smooth with a very fine, restrained, natural carbonation and solidly medium body. Delicate, sweetish malt dominates the flavor, but gives a burst of light fruit at the swallow. It finishes surprisingly dry considering the candyish malt, with a low-key bitterness and some grassy hop flavor becoming evident. It's exceptionally well balanced and quite enjoyable, though it lacks a little bit of complexity. Still, it's well worth trying."
"This brew pours a large invigorated light brown head of fine to medium sized bubbles. It has a cloudy dark orange-brown body full of yeast. Its aroma is a very pleasant yeasty peach smell. Its flavor is full bodied and chewy with hints of spice and fruit."
"Intensity of alcohol causes it to be a slow sipper, but it smooths out as warms, which lends to enjoyment but then it loses some complexity."
"The mouthfeel is pillowy soft and the flavor is near perfect. A perfect blend of semi-dry maltiness with a super pleasant and non aggressive hoppiness. The after flavor is more of a nutmeg/hops as well. Very good. Very Very Good  nearly a perfect excellent beer."
"This brew poured a large creamy thick head that was long lasting. There was lacing on sides of my glass. The aroma was fruity and spicy. The body was an orangish color. It had a bitter taste to it. It also had a slight aftertaste to it. It had a cloudy appearance. All in all I enjoyed drinking this brew."
"This beer pours a clear darkish amber color with a large creamy clingy tan head. The mouthfeel is firm. The smell is of bay leaves and is slightly breadlike. The taste is earthy bay leaves with a fruitiness and candy sugar type sweetness. This is a pretty tasty beer that lacks the complexity of a lot of other triples. The presentation-in an earthenware corked bottle is actually more impressive than the beer itself."
"Though it's not fair to compare with an aged sample, this newer version does not compare to what I remember from fresher versions."
"Possibly the most exhausting cork Ive ever wrestled with. I thought for a minute that I was actually going to need a pair of pliers to get the thing out! Once opened, it pours a hazy deep orange amber color with a thick and creamy off-white colored head and lots of visible active carbonation. Nose is sweet malts and fresh fruit with an almost cake-like aroma. Medium in body with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is sweet fruits up front followed by some notes of bread pudding and peppery hops. A very enjoyable Tripel."
"The Euro style 11.2 ounce bottle, seems thick enough to use as a weapon for such a slender item. This, my first Tripel, out of excitement, pours an orange color with a foamy bright white head. Smell is initially of fresh flowers. The taste is initially chewy, with me craving more, but only in sips. Has a very sweet taste with just a tinge of fruit left on the palate. Noticeable is the warming effect, but not much alcohol taste. My first of many Tripels!"
"This beer poured a sort of amber-orange color with a small foamy head that reduced down to a thin layer on the top, but it did leave good lacing. The aroma had several different characteristics. The citrus-banana smell jumped out the most with alcohol spices and a flowery touch. The hops were also present in the aroma. After the complex smell I was ready for a complex taste but no such luck. The taste was rather bland with none of the aromas really jumping out in the taste. I guess the most notable flavor is the hops. Sort of a grassy bittery taste but this beer isn't totally without any malt flavors. The aftertase leaves a sort of sugary taste in the mouth. Overall I didn't care for this beer to much."

"Honey-orangish in color with an off-white head. It leaves a slight lacing when sipped down. The aroma is sweet and fruity. I detect apple and raisins in the aroma. The flavor is of sweet apple to start, then somewhat bready. It then fads to a dry alcoholic finish. This is my first sampling of a Tripel, and I found it to be a decent beer."
"This is a great beer, though I would have to say that I like the dubbel better. I have a couple of 750 mL bottles of this stashed away for as long as I can hold out. I can't wait to see what this beer tastes like with some time under its belt."
"La Trappe Trappist Ale: A Belgian Tripel Ale, but not made in Monastery, or at least so I am told. Pours a tannish brown, fairly hazy. I spun up some the sediment from the bottom of the bottle, and it came up in thick chunks. The head is not impressive, dissipated very quickly. Cidery aroma, and the flavor has some notes of cider as well. Very malty beer, with some bready malts, but lots of dried fruit flavors as well, such as raisons and the like. Not bad, easy to drink, but I had a Ommengang earlier this evening that was loads better and significantly cheaper."
"Deep cloudy orange-amber color with lots of floaties, nice foamy off white head that clings to my glass. Sweet malty spicy yeasty alcohol aroma.Bready sweet fruity flavors, the taste of alcohol is strong, sweet sticky syrupy mouthfeel, the hops are noticable in the finish, not all bad."
"Golden color. Shiny. Thin rocky head, lots of carbonation bubbles. Smell was slighly citrus and sweet. First taste was dominated by alcohol. Hot, high alcohol burning never left. Sweet, fruit tastes dominated. Weird slick, and thin feel. Light bodied, not near medium. Alcohol and flavors never reach a balance. Burning lingers in the back of the throat. A dissapointment. I had their dubbel a while back, before becoming a ba, and kept the bottle it was so good. I was thrilled to see this at store, and jumped at the chance to buy it, It was a letdown."
"Out of the 750 ml bottle. Dark golden / copper hue w/ good clarity if decanted. Topped by a thick, fluffy, well retained head with rounded peaks. Honey laced sweetness in aroma combined with mild notes of pear, and unripe citrus. Undertones of banana esters and clove. Hint of peppery alcohol. Clove is more pronounced in flavor, but remains pleasantly mild. It couples with residual sugars to lend an herbally sweet impression that briefly lingers. Notes of black licorice and cidery tartness emerge mid palate. Understated hop bitterness leaves the flavor profile skewed towards malt sweetness, which unfortunately consists of seemingly simple residual sugars-- almost one dimensional in overall malt character. Lightly bodied and a touch thin in mouthfeel, but this helps lend a deceiving lightness on the palate. Finishes w/ notes of white bread sweetness, but otherwise clean. La Trappe Tripel, although fairly tasty, seemed too clean and restrained in overall malt and yeast derived character. It's much like their Blonde, albeit with a more pronounced alcohol presence."
"This is not to my liking! Appearance in glass is of a very bad home brew, aroma is of yeast and very obvious.....taste is of a caramel malt nature and stong. If this was the only beer on earth, I would turn to wine..(somebody please, hit me with a stick)"
"This beer poured a reddish amber and formed a bubbly off white head that left circular lace as it subsided.  A good amount of carbonation is present.  An aroma of malt, herb and bread.  A flavor of malt and citrus with a warming slight presence of the alcohol.  A slight tart finish on a light body brought on in part, no doubt, to the heavy carbonation.  Not a bad tripel."
"Musty/malt smell with a touch of yeast freshness.  A white head with a touch of tan that dissapates into a slight sheen quite rapidly.  Rose' in color with lively carbonation.  Slightly darker than most triples.  The yeast/fruit flavor dominates the tongue and is backed up by a sweet malt base.  The mouth is is lively with some softness in the finish.  Solid but not a ""next level"" selection."
"This beer has an amber color and is topped with a dense, rocky off-white head.  Phenolic, sour, yeasty, fruity aroma. Taste includes alcohol, sour notes and yeast.  There almost seems to be a stinging solvent-like characteristic also.  A little off to me.  Some banana esters are present.  The body is about medium and drinkability is not that great.  If I'm looking for a Belgian beer to drink, I'll bypass this one the next time."
"Probably not the best tripel out there, but certainly one the most drinkable.  This would be an excellent introduction to the style"
"Love this beer, have to get it everytime I'm in PA.  Great aroma and taste ... gets better as it warms and a gentle spicy/fruit taste invades your palatte.  Especially nice on a cold day or evening."
"hazy amber-orange, not much sediment to work up. medium head and lacing.  big time alcohol/fruitcake aroma awakens the senses.  full mouthfeel.   definite belgian spice characteristics...like eating apple pie and nutmeg.  some clove and banana...all backed up by a definite alcohol presence.  lots of other flavors present but i'm too overwhelmed to describe them.  i'd even be more impressed if this was december and not july.   a great beer."
"Notes: More of a laid back tripel resting at 8% abv and with a milder character than others, still a very respectable brew. A perfect accompaniment with a goat cheese spread and whole wheat crackers."
"Hazy pale orangey color, thin head that lasts awhile.  Vague aroma, slightly berry.  Lacks the oomph of the Quadrupel and has a more pronounced grape/wine flavor than a berry-like character.  After taste is very pleasant.  Refreshing but not super memorable within this style.  But then, I'm only mildy a fan of Belgian Ales."
