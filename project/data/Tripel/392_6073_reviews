"Very good beer for great value"
""
""
"Nice beer.  Looks and smells terrific...the alcohol content is not well disguised and that it's my major gripe...overall it was nice, but I will seek out another Belgian Tripel to taste next."
"Super tasty beer! One of my favorites!"

"Put on tap in my home tap.  Cask conditioned so nice and bubbly but has a very creamy nice mouthfeel.  Beautiful cloudy tripel color.  Initial smell is of bananas with a little bit of pear.  Tastes like banana bubble gum.  Very complex flavor and a nicely made beer.  Flavor is clearly driven by the yeast which is appropriate for the style.  Booze is present but not overpowering flavor.  A good domestic tripel but if banana is not your preference for the dominant flavor in a belgian style then pick a different tripel (such as Fin Du Monde)"
""
""
""
""
"O- Average triple, worth getting if the price is right."
""
"Overall- A pretty good beer, I think this is a good American take on a tripel."
""
""
""
"Definitely has a nice peppery bite to the flavor along with toasted malts, coriander, Allspice, and an assertive bitterness.  Booze is less noticeable in the taste. This will warm one up."

"Smooth at the beginning but bitter in the end."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, it had just about everything that I look for in the style with no off flavors and the mouthfeel was pretty well done.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's fairly smooth, crisp, a little creamy, well hidden alcohol, not too filling and the taste does a nice job at holding my attention, I think one would be the perfect amount for me, It might start to wear on me a little if I have more than that.  What I like the most about this beer is the mouthfeel and aroma, they are both good and I think they are the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but it was a little rough around the edges.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend giving it a try if your a fan of the style.  All in all I was happy with this beer, for an american brewed Tripel it was good and it seemed to be better than most.  It isn't a favorite beer from this brewery, but I do think it's one of the better American brewed tripels that I've had.  NIce job guys, this was a nice tripel, keep it up."

"Golden in color.  Smells like spice, clove, banana, and some bread.  Taste is malt And yeast with light sweetness and spice.  Mouthful is medium with a fair amount of carbonation.  Alcohol is hidden.  Overall a nice example of a triple, very refreshing."
"This is a very good Belgium Ale. I will buy this again."
""
""
""
"Ring ring ring...bells ringing. Clearly the monks are happy tonight because they are drinking the beer on tap. This is the cure for Quasimodo"
""
"Overall- A good representation for the tripel style. Not overly sweet or obnoxious. Well worthy of being the flagship brew for this brewey."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 10/29/2014. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, apricot, banana, pepper, clove, coriander, wheat, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big pear, apricot, apple, banana, pepper, clove, coriander, candi sugar, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, apricot, banana, pepper, clove, coriander, candi sugar, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is great. A good amount of dryness as well. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding tripel style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Wow, this it's incredibly fruity and sweet.   Very carbonated almost sparkling, and a really an enjoyable American tripel. Well done.  I'm surprised this isn't more popular especially for its low price point"

"Great tasting brew very happy I gave this a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice year round tripel. Anytime i see this in a ""create your own"" six pack area i will pick it up."
""
""
"Overall: A solid triple. I wish that the clove was a little more balanced with the other spice flavors but overall a nice example of the style."
"I just don't like Belgians but regardless, I think the quality is good."
""
""
""
"Amazing beer Brewed 30 mins away from my home. Golden pour with a decent head with a spicy finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light golden body, 1 finger head that dissipates to a thin film. Smells strong of Belgian yeast, wheat and slight spice. Strong taste of Belgian yeast, sweet bananas, honey, very sweet with a little warm spice aftertaste of clove or ginger? Medium body, light carbonation, very smooth. Masks the 9.3 abv very well."
""
""
""
"The feel is great, somewhat light, but certainly a full balanced beer, with a nice refreshing carbonation that seems to linger in your mouth while you are waiting for your next drink."
""
"Mouth is slightly watery but solid for a triple."
""
"Weyerbacher doesn't get enough credit for it's lineup. This is a stellar beer."
""
""
"Too strong for me mildly sweet taste"
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer.  The fruitiness was unexpected (I've never had a tripel), but fun for a change."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet with a slight hop finish. Dry. Nice bit of an alcohol burn."
"Good tripel but not outstanding"
""
""
""
"Nice smooth tripel. Less of an alcohol taste than I expected with a sweet, dry finish. Quite tatsty."
"This beer is quite good"

"I have had the luxury of tasting this exquisite beer. Although I paid $16 for a  sixer (at a local distributor), it was a little over priced. None the less, it is one of the finer beers I have had the pleasure of tasting. The date on my bottles was Oct. 15th 2014, I drank mine on the 4th of Dec. 2014. Considering this beer's taste may change over time as the review states, I feel it would only get better with age. I highly recommend buying this beer...unless you are a complete cheap O'Charlie (buy which you wouldn't have this app to begin with lol) you will be satisfied. Slainté!"

"I mostly liked it, but found it a bit strong. The bitter was a bit much in the beginning but it grew on me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pleasant golden, copper color.  Not overly carbonated.  Leaves a soapy head that rapidly dissipates.  Taste is smooth and crisp with plenty of coriander, orange peel, cardamom, and sweet Belgian candy.   An easy to drink beer with a splash of hops, but not overwhelming, and the bitterness rounds out the sweetness.  Another mark for Weyerbacher.  A great brewing company."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ehh."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden color with a white head that trails the glass. The smell is sweet with hints of banana and spices like clove shine through. The taste was really refreshing with a smooth balance between the malt and the hops making for a tasty beer. The alcohol is hidden very well and will sneak up on you though so be careful."

"Tasty and deep, Merry Monks has good mouthfeel and interesting complexities, but overall lacks the full-flavor I really want from a tripel. It's a very fun beer, light and refreshing, but I generally prefer more punch being packed. I'll definitely be looking to try other Weyerbacher beers, however, as this was definitely a creative brew, hitting the fruit and cereal notes I expect from any abbey style ale, but in a fairly unique way."

"The sweet comes & goes even in the same sip. Like a lava lamp on the tongue. First this way, then that, but ever so fluid. Charming...& powerful as all get out. At 9.3%, no wonder them monks be merry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark yellow with a rich head that lasts throughout the drinking process. Very crisp and fresh. No single flavor stands out, or so I felt, but, by and large, it tasted really good. By far the beer's best attribute is its feeling in one's mouth. It feels very creamy, but not too creamy, not too much like cough syrup or something. It drives that fine line between too heavy and too smooth perfectly. The taste is consistently good, with a mellow spiciness. A lot of sweetness. Heartily enjoyed."
""
"Overall - Just too sweet for my taste. Seems to be well made."
""
"O: Would definitely recommend it to Belgian bier lovers since it is almost like Weyerbacher played it safe and just tried to emulate what all good Belgians taste like. While they do not do anything to try and alter the perspective of a Belgian Tripel, they do a great job of resembling the flavors of some of the best Tripels in the world"

"O - Really taste Belgian here. Great aroma, sweet and carbonated taste. This is very drinkable and delicious. The taste/smell of bananas and plums is both unique and appealing. One of the better Belgian ales I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I think Merry Monks is head and shoulders above Victory Golden Monkey, in general a better flavored brew. It is certainly very drinkable, with the 9.3% abv well hidden so that after quaffing a few you won’t even notice when you’re dragged to your cell. Although the appearance isn’t great (fizzy disappearing head, no lacing), the aroma, flavor, and palate more than make up. I also like the appearance of both the bottled and best by dates – they are blue against the brown bottle and extremely legible, even with a sweating bottle."

"Just about everything you'd expect from a well made Belgian-style Tripel. It pours smooth with a thick white foamy head and a golden body. Has a great smell with hints of vanilla, spice, and orange peel. I love how straight forward and well rounded this beer is! Its creamy and smooth with a slight tangy finish. All around its wonderfully balanced!"

"Excellent trippel. Sweet with a respectable alcohol taste. A beer that can make an impact without an aggressive hop flavor is doing well by me. I do love hops too. No fancy beer jargon that I can offer though. My top choice over la fin du monde, and chimay trippel any day."
""

""

"O: Solid overall, pure flavors and fits the style, it would be better if its were a bit driert"
""
"O- For me, I think Merry Monk's is at its peak right now (~6 months after bottling) and best enjoyed on the warmer side. I am a fan of Weyerbacher and think Merry Monk's is the best of their year-round offerings. For the price (~$11.99, 6-Pack, $8.99 750ml bottle), the quality and attention to style, this is simply one of the best craft brewed Belgian Triples in America. Although I prefer the mouthfeel of Merry Monk's from a 750ml corked & caged bottle, the 12oz format is just as good (and a better value). Being that the brewery boasts an active barrel aging program (Blasphemy, Insanity, Heresy and now Rhumpshaka), I would absolutely love for them to experiment with a Merry Monks aged in whiskey barrels. (4.75)"

"O- If this beer had more carbonation, it would be even better. But, as it stands, it's just a solid tripel with a nice intensity of flavor."
""
"Overall - Really enjoyable beer, totally masks its abv, a little too fruity for me but very enjoyable, great beer from Weyerbacher, not a go-to brew but if I see it and want a good, interesting beer, this is the one. As I let it warm just a bit, the banana really came through too strong for me, not changing the rating but still, worth noting it really uses the fruity flavor to mask the abv. It really is complex, if you're on the fence after seeing reviews, I say go for it, you won't regret it even if you don't love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"It's light amber color and lack of head or aroma did not detract from a robust Belgian taste. No hops (refreshing for an American beer!). Slightly sweet, balanced, and with the full complex taste of a true Belgian."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the few Belgian style tripels I've had and I was fairly impressed. I'm on board with this more so than a witbier. Some similar characteristics but bolder. Perhaps a little too sweet for my liking. Still not quite my style, but I'll consider grabbing this when I'm in the mood for a belgian style beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A random selection from the store this evening and I was greatly surprised. As soon as I opened the bottle the fragrance was amazing very fruity (not perfume like , as someone else reviewed). Great Blond color, and nice lacing from the head. And deeeelicious with the first mouthful. Refreshing, full of flavor, a very well crafted beer. Well done Weyerbacker!"

"This is a beer that could get you into some trouble on a lazy summer day. One moment you feel great, 3 beers later you're in the neighbors backyard getting tasered."
""
""

"Overall: Im shit in the wind, buy it, love it its wonderful. I love it its dark and has a head of an inch or less."

"Overall: A remake please! It's over the map; aggressive, boozy character, way too much sweetness and zero yeasty complexity or mystery. Unsubtle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One complaint would be this particular glass did not have very good head retention."
"In the future I will be more verbose."
""
"O: Merry Monks' ale is definitely a very solid offering from Weyerbacher. There's a few elements that count definitely be improved upon, namely the slightly imbalanced sweetness in the flavor. I would have liked to see more earthiness shine through to kind of cut down the fruitiness. The coriander and clove spice just didn't do the job fully. Other than that, this is an enjoyable brew that is great for late night, slow-sipping. Could do with some improvement, but still worth the try if it's readily available."

"O/D-I liked this more than I thought I would. A great intro into the style and I prefer this more than many."

"Pours a clean amber with a 2 finger head that fades quickly with very light lacing. Smell is malt and lemon forward with many spice notes hidden. Tastes of cereal and malt with a long finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing medium body with a lingering finish on the palate. Overall a pretty good beer."
"Overall, a great great can't-miss beer."
""
""
""
"o: surprised how much i like this. i thought it would be overly spiced judging by the aroma, but thats not the case. this is fruity and yeasty with a nice balance between the two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really good representation of the style. I would concider this among the bett of the belgian style american ales today. Better than anything other American 'beligan syle' brewerys are producing currently. Great triple."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a delicious tripel. It's a bit on the sweet side, but has nice complexity."
""
""
"Definitely would drink this one again. One of the best tripels I've had."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly amber gold with a nice head and lacing which diminishes in a few minutes. Nose is slightly sweet with a touch of yeast, spice and pear fruit. Medium body approaching full with a nice slick texture. Very well carbonated from bottle conditioning. More flavorful than most Belgian tripels, although this one is US made, with a nice tartness against a typical Belgian flavor profile with a touch of spice. Finishes nicely with a slight alcohol burn at the back top of the throat. One of the better tripels I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Like I said, this beer is a treat and a real surprise for me. I expected this to fall somewhere in the range of a Golden Monkey or the like, but this is a legitimately good tripel."

"I enjoyed Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin, so I thought I would give this one a shot. At 9.3% ABV I knew this was going to be a strong beer, as Tripels are, and so I was OK with paying $11.99 for a 6 pack as a result. However, I found the alcohol flavor and dryness of this beer to be overwhelming. I did not get the sweet finish and, instead, found the alcohol really coming through with every sip. The faint fruit and spice flavors did little to mask it."

"Was really hoping for a better experience. Not a very drinkable beer. It tasted & smelled a lot like rotten fruit & alcohol. Now I don't usually drink tripels, which is why I didn't score it lower, but if they all taste like this, I'll never drink another one. It was that bad. I found myself forcing it down quicker because it definitely started to develop a stronger rotten taste as the beer's temperature rose higher. Not a beer I would reccommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had the monks many times but wanted to do a full review to see when it would fall. Good looking beer that has a nice belgian nose, but you do notice the alcohol in the smell. Love the taste, something about this beer really hits me right. And with the ABV you have to give it some bonus points, although you do notice the alcohol. My biggest observation is the guy on the label, he really looks like a child offender. Excellent beer that I will have often."
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"Overall 3.75: I have to state that my initial reservations about this brew, -based on the creepy label art-- were unfounded. Very good Tripel and very refreshing take on a standard and popular style. Very good beer and a dangerous one. Why? Because this is a dry, refreshing and light on the palate Tripel that is NINE POINT THREE PERCENT ABV. That's why I typed it in all caps, folks. Be very careful with this bad boy, because it can creep up on you."
"The flavors are quite good and there aren't really ""off"" flavors. However, the booze is just too huge in this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely a return beer. I'm drinking it now, i drank it 3 days ago on a saliboat, i'd highly recommend it. Just dont let it get to close to lukewarm (unless you're a big fan of belgian tripels), otherwise it might compromise the taste."

"O: Overall this was a very mellow, full bodied interpretation. Laid back, lazy (co2) and boozy like that uncle everyone has. Had this one years ago, dont know how it evaded my review list or what my initial impression was to compare to. The flavor wasn't bad, just when i think tripel i think lighter golden body, snappy carbonation, more spiciness, head formation, and sharp drinking experience. As well a little unfiltered floaties are also a welcome gesture. To give you an idea of my preference St. bernardus, watou, and unibroue's la fin du monde all make for fantastic examples. Again not a bad beer, just a bit off base per style to my liking and a bit heavy handed in the malt/body department."

"Overall: a complex, unique, and altogether delicious beer that stays true to style in some ways, but falls short in its lack of hop aroma and bitterness. Also a bit light and sweet for the style. Still, one of the best beers I've had, overall."

""
""
""
""
""

""

"If you haven't tried this beer you should go out of your way to find 2 bombers of it. One to drink right away and get a solid buzz on, and one to Cellar for up to 6 months. The comparison is indescribable."

"I expected a lot from this being a similar style to one of my favorites of all time - La Fin Du Monde: Tripel. This one is relative it calories at around 270-280 and ABV 9.0% but far off in the taste. I would compare this to the taste of a ground up Christmas wreath. The aftertaste is very strong and unsettling at first but eventually tones down a bit to that of cut grass. I hoped that most tripel style would be similar, which is to an extent, but far off from the smoothness and aftertaste of La Fin Du Monde."

"Pours a hazy yellow with an orange tint. The color of blush on an apricot. A finger of foam that fell slowly to a thin skin on top. Good retention and lace. Nose is malt bread, caramel, banana and pear. Some apple, raisin and yeast to round it out. Bubblegum and clove, pepper and faint floral. Malt deepens with a little bread as it warms. Taste is banana, pear, a little acidic, pale malt and honey, a little pepper and spice on the back palate. Clove really comes to the palate as it warms. Body is light and mouthfeel is creamy but a little heavy. A touch of grass brings the hops to the palate in the finish as the alcohol leaves warmth and dryness to offset the juicy fruitiness. It’s a little tart and tangy but the bread is amazing and full which both contribute to it’s heaviness. I thought it was a good tripel. Not quite subtle but well done nonetheless. After all a tripel is for sipping not slurping."
"Overall: Not the greatest tripel but it's a good beer. Complex. Worth a try"

"Flavor is extremely fruit forward and spicy as well. I admire the complexity but some sips feel a bit harsh and a bit more balance is needed. Perhaps some age would do good."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a cloudy straw color with a finger of head that dissipated relatively quickly. The nose possesses the definite essence of Belgian yeast. The flavor is sour but generally flat and uninspiring. There is some residual sweetness on the finish which is the highlight of this brew."

"o- a very nice triple, i really like the flavor of the yeast, very fruity and sweet, i could see how this is rated one of the top triples in the world."
""
"O - nice example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, they got a lot of belgian character in this bottle, very true to style,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: initially taken aback and puckered somewhat, but then eased into it more - warmed well, naturally, and proved a more enjoyable drink than I expected. A good tripel."
"Bottle signed by the brewer himself! Bottle served into Green Man snifter. Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a three finger white head that subsided to one finger extremely slowly. Maintained phenomenal pacing throughout the glass. The aroma wad comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, wheat, spice, banana runts, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, banana, wheat, spice, alcohol, and subtle wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The nose on this one was very inviting and quite complex. It had a big sweetness and spiciness going on in it that I really enjoyed. The flavor however was quite hot with alcohol and honestly took me back. Really wish this had not been the case. I would drink this one again in the future but aged quite a bit to let the booze settle out some."

"My first American made Tripel and it is done very nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all, this is an enthusiastic (even exuberant) take on the Tripel style. Not entirely traditional, but not a big American fruit bomb either. Worth the experience, but buy a single, not the six-pack."

"O: Very nice tripel. Has the right aromas and flavors, and the mouthfeel is crisp. Nice in a snifter."
""
""
"O- Although alcohol is abundant in this brew, Weyerbacher did a fine job concealing it with some other wonderful flavors and aromas. I enjoy this Tripel, because it isn't too heavy, and it has a good balance of flavors. It's not too sweet, yet hops are barely noticeable. I'd have this tasty beer gain, and look forward to more of Weyerbacher's creations."

"very good belgian ale here, not totally conventional, but a clever incarnation of the tripel style. this beer pours cloudy and flat in color, somewhere between straw and wheat in terms oc complexion, and there is just an inch of thin white fizz on top. the nose is very fruity, like golden raisins, figs, and candy sugar. the yeast imparts a gentle spice character as well, which is more apparent in the flavor than the smell. it has a sweet flavor, like it should be sugary, but it isnt at all, and is in fact dry as it drinks. the alcohol is well hidden, and the fruity elements blend well with the lighter malt profile. this feels more like a summertime drink to me, but it was plenty sessionable in the middle of december, with its vibrant carbonation and clean finish. i thought the body was a tad too much for the style, it made the beer seem a little heavy, and its delicate essence was trampled on a little bit by its weight, but even with that criticism i thought this was a very enjoyable bottle of beer."
""
"Overall this a great beer for drinking on an easy night when you wanna feel it but take it easy at the same time, this beer seems to go well for me in the winter months as it almost warms you up"
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. I got a lot of pear and green apple? Got a finger of white head. Decent carbonation and mouthfeel. I have had a couple so that could effect the review. At 9.3% the alcohol is well hidden. Overall this a good example of the style and a good beer"
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid tripel and happy to have had the chance to check out thd brewery last week while traveling through PA."
""
"Poured into a chalice, hazy gold with a small lasting white head. Aromas of straw, pear, pineapple, yeast and light spice. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of straw, yeast, pear, pineapple and a hint oif spice with a smooth lingering fruity finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Lighter than most I have had in the style and also more complex. Does not have some of the bittering alcohol that I usually find in the style..so that is why I would drink this one sooner than most. I like the banana and apricot fruity mix."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A sweet and tasty triple with quite a nice flavor profile and a great feel. This is a good one to try and a fantastic sipping Belgian Triple."

"a very nice strong golden ale, glad i aged this one! it is a slight bit on the tart side though, which for a 750 cork bottle, makes it hard to finish in a single sitting."

"Pours a hazy blood orange, visible sediment with a big 3 finger head that fades to a thin lace. The smell is full of fruitiness, apples, peaches, grapes. Bubblegum, cotton candy and hot alcocol all mixed in. Lots of booze on the tongue, banana, apples, And grapes, finishes dry And slightly metallic. Medium bodied, crisp, tangy with a crisp dry finish. Overall; a solid triple, tons of fruity esters and very well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While not my favorite style, I know when I've got a great tripel on my hands. This is not one of them. The flavor profile is too muddled, and it's too hard to drink. Worth a try, I guess, but don't lose sleep looking for this - there are many better examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma has some nice Belgian yeast notes, as well as some grape and orange notes. The flavor is very similar. I get some nice sweetness from the candy sugar, as well as some yeast and alcohol notes. There is also a big fruit component with some grapes and orange notes, as well as some white pepper. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
"This is a well flavored, solid offering. It's a decent Tripel. The alcohol is noticeable which slows down the drinking, but otherwise it's a rather solid Tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The flavor is more on point than the nose, both hit the right points for style. There are other Golden Strongs I could have all night but I could only have a glass of this in a sitting, though I will definitely have another some other day."
"Pours pale golden color with a small white head. Smells very fruity and yeasty that carries into the taste as well. Slight alcohol flavor. Highly carbonated, the mouthfeel is wonderful, very creamy. Long lasting but very subtle hoppyness. A very well done tripel."
"Pours a medium pale golden ale with a thin layer of white. Fruity smell. Some of that Belgian yeast smell. Strong fruity taste - cherries - that rolls into a malty/yeast blend. Unique hoppy close with some lingering bite. Really nails the style, very admirably done./"
"Overall: nice ""kicked up"" tripel. Alcohol well hidden. Mellow and creamy."
"O - Not a bad Tripel, not a great one either. This might be a good intro Tripel for those trying to get into Belgium styled beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Fairly complex, and very tasty. Though it's a little dangerous how easy it goes down, which is fairly typical for this style. However, it's not quite and complex as many other tripels. Though there are better tripels out there, not a bad one to try."
""
"Good tripel, lots going on here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent effort, but lacking the depth of character to make it great. Not my favorite Tripel. I'll stick to La Fin Du Monde for my Tripels made this side of the Atlantic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was an extremely tasty Tripel, with a nice yeasty citrus flavor. That along with the multitude of other flavors did a somewhat decent job of masking the high ABV, making this brew very drinkable and quite enjoyable..."
""
"O: Very nice, probably the best tripel I've had to date other than Fin Du Monde."
""
""
"Reminds me of Fin Du Monde from Unibroue. Intense flavors and a little over the top, but quite tasty. From the big Belgian-style bottle purchased at a certain overpriced organo-centric market in DC."
""
""
"O- This is fantastic! An excellent example of a Belgian Tripel... from PA!!! It's all there... wonderful banana yeastiness, sweet & sour candied citrus, and fantastic carbonation and mouthfeel. Very well done Weyerbacher!"
""
""
""
"O: This tripel is relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked from the taste, although it is a beer that can be sipped."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems a little too fresh/young and would benefit greatly from a little age. Not bad now, but laying a few down is definitely recommended"
""
""
"Overall this is certainly a delicious tripel from a brewery that continues to impress. A little lackluster as it is fairly dominated by banana but still a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly recommended!"
"Overall, this is good fare, and certainly fit to stand with any of its Belgian kin."

"This is an outstanding trippel; I only wished I had chilled it a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Merry Monks is an easy drinking beer for the 9.3% ABV. I enjoy the complexity of fruits and spices in the flavor, but I grow tired of it by the time I finish. It isn't bad, but it doesn't stand up to other tripels I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very unimpressive offering from one of my favorite East Coast breweries...and Tripel's are one of my cherished styles - totally out of balance and just too boozy all around and really just not that good when compared to the better of the same style out there. Wished I had liked it more, but just didn't."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good tripel, overall, especially from an American brewery. It is pretty unattractive looking and could use a lighter body, but it's quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is definitely making tripels a big fan of mine now"
"I just love this beer.  Excellent creamy mouth-feel, complex flavors.  Beautiful."
""
"Very enjoyable take on a Belgian triple that is too drinkable for it's own good."
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good tripel. I picked this up on a whim and I'm glad I did. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, one of my favorites in the style. I really love the sweetness, thickness and spice in this one. Great rendition of style."
"bottle poured into a tuliup glass. Pours a bright straw yellow capped by a foamy white head with ok retention. Head reduces to a light lacing cap. Light biscuit and clove in the nose. Taste is clove, clove and more clove, slight biscuit, grass, and the alchohol becomes noticable as it warms. Mouth is full bodied and quite a sipper."
""
""
""
"Very well-crafted brew. Complex, but with a high drinkability. Makes for a great sipper, and definitely worth a buy."
""
""
"What sells this beer for me is the taste, though: It IS a merry beer, with the distinct taste of pecans and pie on the first try. The nutty flavor persists throughout and rounds this high-alcohol ale very well. Good ole times come forth and the mind drifts away with the Merry Monk."
""
""
""
"This is some good stuff! Another worthy reason to buy the 'Big Beers' case from Weyerbacher. However, this delight comes on draft tonight. Definitely worth the drink."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, bottle stamp date says 100611 100613. Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about an inch off-white head that stayed around a while. There's also a small amount of lacing. Aroma is yeasty, the brew smells like cloves, bananas, bready malt, pears and some green grapes. It tastes like bready malt, yeast, cloves, candy sugar, pears, and bananas. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is very carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this easy to drink. I think it's an OK brew, but there really isn't anything about this that would make me want to buy it again. With that being said, I do think it's worth trying."
""
"Overall, a very nice brew from Weyerbacher and is definitely worth a try."
""
""
"Overall Impression- I'm not sure I could recommend this one as a Tripel but is was a very interesting brew! Tons of fruit, wheat, and light spices hang out but nothing like a tripel should be. Found these strange sour notes here and there and have NEVER found this in this style. If you see it, I would recommend if your looking for a fruit beer but don't go out of your way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit all over the map; rather aggressive with the boozy character, a bit too much fruity sweetness and not enough yeasty complexity"
""
""
"Overall (4.0): This is really a good beer. I was expecting something more along the lines of a BSPA, but in reality this is closer to a tripel / imperial wit hybrid, if that’s a thing. It’s good. Fans of tripels and BSPAs alike should try this beer, and considering the pricepoint this is a really good buy. Yaaay Weyerbacher!"
""
""
""
"Highly carbonated and creamy, this beer is medium-heavy bodied. Carbonation bites the tongue, and there is a little coating action. Slightly dry finish. Very good offering from Weyerbacher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Gorgeous amber beer with a thick, foamy head and tons of carbonation. Aromas of honey and apricot with spices. Delicious fruit and coriander flavor. Very drinkable; I'm wishing I'd bought more than one bottle. Weyerbacher really did a great job with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In my opinion this is the quintessential belgian triple."
""
"D: very flavorful with all the right flavors. this is a super solid american made tripel that is nice to have as a year round brew."
"O-Despite of the spices it is a good beer. If the spices were toned down a little bit it would be a wonderful beer."
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer at all, but missing something. Compare this to Victory's Golden Monkey with it's nice spicy flavors in the finish to see what Weyerbacher is missing out on. Alternately, it would make a great base for a winter seasonal if the right spices were added."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, a great beer. Personally, I wouldn't want it all the time, but if I'm ever in the mood for a little something sweet, I may just have to get some more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is just great. One of the best Ive had in a while. Im not usually a tripel fan but after drinking this I may explore the style a little more. Every time I set it down Im tempted to pick it right back up again, I'll definitely be reccomending this one to friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There is a TON going on in this beer, and all of it good. As the beer warms the flavor changes, and as you sip it more aspects of the flavor come out. I would love to set one of these down and see what a few years does for it, but even now it is really great. Another solid offering from Weyerbacher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: A bit of a disappointment. The detectable alcohol in the taste, and a overall lack of potent flavor is a turn off. Good, but definitely not great."
""
""
""
"(B- is what I was going for in the rating department, since I don't know what the hell the numbers really mean at this point.)"
"O: A very refreshing and enjoyable Tripel. Would certainly have this again!"
""
""
""
"O: A solid tripel. Definitely recommend picking it up."
""
"O: Very solid tripel. Not my favorite, but it's quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommended!"
"Dr. Easy and delicious despite the high ABV."

"Pretty awesome actually, I just wish I knew what was wrong with the nose on this. Otherwise quite delicious."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very well-done Tripel. Not a big fan of the style, as it's far too sweet for my personal palate, but a good representation of it. Tripel fans should be satisfied."
""
"Decent Triple. I have had only a few that blew me out of the water, and this does not. However still a good brew, and would order again."
""
"Served: 12 oz. Bottle poured into thin-walled Hofbräuhaus pint glass."
""
"Overall: What was this? It smelled like some kind of imperial hefe and tasted really over-spiced and unbalanced. This is faaar from the top Tripels (especially La Fin Du Monde). Its a weird beer and pretty unpleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste of cherries and malt...alcohol is deff there. I really enjoyed this brew. It is a nice sipping beer, great for desert, or on a nice cold night. Not much of a session brew as you can imagine...id buy again."
"Drink- Pretty boozy and astringent, nail polish but the balance and ABV holds it together. A little unbalanced. Not the best Tripel but if you want boozy and tripel together. Found your beer. Crazy monks!"
"The color is lighter than you would expect, but the taste is dark, sweet and yeasty. As it should be. Recommended for a taste ay time you want a heavy tripel. Compares favorably with belgians from Belgium - better than many."
"Poured from bottle to glass, very little head, nice amount of bubbles. This brew has a strong alcohol odor,almost like wine. Nice coppery/orange color. Warm boozy finish. The further I drink the more it tastes of wine.This would fair well with a nice slice of pie, on a cold winters eve. A few of these and you`ll be couched for sure."
"Glad I got a sample and not a full glass. Overbearing and hot with loads of spicy and fruity tones. Too much. complex, interesting, but not for a hot day."
"O-like many tripels i've had, this is a fairly harsh beer, meaning that it really doesn't go down too easily. its actually fairly difficult to finish. i doubt i'll be getting this one again, nor do i recommend it."
"86."
"Poured into a plastic cup (lollerfail), a golden color of indeterminate haze, with a nice fluffy white head. Big big aroma of bready yeast and fruit esters. Taste of sweet malts, bready, with obvious fruit notes: banana, peach, pear, apple skins, and a dash of spice. Very flavorful, very drinkable. Medium-bodied, and quite strong, though the alcohol isn't too overbearing, flavorwise."
"O: An impressive American take on a Belgian Tripel. Very drinkable despite the hefty 9.3%."
"Pours a beautiful amber color w/ a two finger white head that lingers for a while. Good carbonation and lacing. Very hazy in appearance- a good solid looking tripel. Nose is apple, peach, pear, clove, other spices, and yeast. Very balanced, and nothing really sticks out. The taste is good, but not quite as balanced as the nose. It's almost really good, but not quite. This falls short of the best in style, but it's still top 4 or so American Tripels I've had. It improves as it warms, however... Massively. Feel is a little dry and carbonated for my taste on the style. It's probably the weak point for this brew. All in all, this is a good tripel, and I would have it again. Unfortunately, it's really easy to get world class Belgian tripels around Washington DC... so I don't know when I would pick this up. Definitely check it out if you haven't though- another solid brew from Weyerbacher."
"D - a fairly good tripel but the burn reduces the drinkability."
"O: Bad ass beer, great name, I am definitely in a merry mood. Weyerbacher does not disappoint. I had Verboten (Belgian Pale Ale) before which would be the little brother to Merry Monk and was satisfied but this takes the brewery to a whole other level. Glad I was able to sip on this one!"
"O - This is excellent even by true Belgian standards: plenty of complexity, well-balanced flavors, fine finish and aftertaste. Highly recommended for U.S. fans of tripels."
"D - I love this tripel - my favorite offering from Weyerbacher. It's definitely a sipping beer that is meant to be savored. Excellent flavor."
"I think this will be a good extra when I trade for anyone who can't get Weyerbacher. Great beer, great price, and underrated, but again, probably for ""true to style"" points."
"O: The sour lemon wasnt as dominating as you drank this one. It still covers up a lot of the yeast character."
"O: If this came in a mason jar with three X's on the front, I would watch out for lost eyesight. Since it doesn't, however, this Belgian twist on moonshine cider is surprisingly pleasing."
"Overall: One of the better attempts at a Belgian style by an American brewery. A solid beer, not great but still pretty good. I’d recommend giving it a try."
"O- A tripel with a great mouthfeel and very balanced in the flavor and aroma profile. Hard to find a better tripel available in six packs, a great bargain and beer."
"O: A solid beer from a brewery that I do not know much of. This is certainly not a knock your socks off revolutionary beer but it sure as hell isn't shabby either. Good stuff."
"O: Seemed to deviate a bit much for my liking in the style. Have had plenty of over American versions and liked them a lot more."
"Final Thoughts: I'm not a tripel guy, but this is a pretty good one. Not alot on the nose, but it's strong on what it has it seems. The only guff I have is with the dying head."
" The first wass Merry Monks' Ale from Weyerbacher Brewing Co. It's a tripel (take my car keys) that is yellow/orange with a thick white head. The flavor is slightly sweet with fruit flavors I couldn't quite place, something like banana. The hops are more citrus-y than floral and are pretty strong. I liked it very much, even though tripels and doubels aren't my thing."
"i have definitely had better Belgian strong ale's however it was nicely done."
"had to try this one for the sake of the hype and the prospect of solid american belgians that are just straight up hard to do and time consuming. Looks the part for sure. And feels the part. Yeast formation... In palate is most definitely american with fruits that would symbolize harsh esters in other beers like banana... Not particularly spiced to comp that. Still broad but tight... as a triple should be. Belgian sugar cane esters. Light wheat silk feel. Palate doesn't insinuate banana as much. Crisp, mild wheat. Marzipan hints. Abv is undetectable which for some can mean success. Its a strength, but may make it one dimensional for some."
"I thought this was a very flavorful beer, though it was maybe a bit too sweet for me."
"Overall = C+"
"O-good solid representation of the style"
"o: not bad! A pretty good tripel!"
"Overall - Decent but compaired to other tripels this is too mild and plain. Needs more spices and hops to add complex flavors. Worth a drink but nothing special."
"Cheers to Dan W, Chris W, Dan H, and all the guys down in Easton! Good stuff!"
"Overall - A heavy tripel that misses the mark, but it tastes decent. Just not what I was looking for in this beer."
"Be warned that this beer has two faces. If you don't pour it slowly then you will end up with a hefeweisen sort of beer. I made this mistake on the first bottle out of the six pack. In my opinion it is much more enjoyable without the yeast. Try it both ways, though, its quite interesting."
"O - Good, but La Fin du Monde is a better example."
"Overall this is a fairly drinkable Americanized tripel. By no means the best I have ever had but a fine offering from a reputable brewery. Worth the low investment but not a must have by any means."
"Had this on-tap at an Uno’s Pizza in Hamilton NJ. It was served too cold but they did put in in the right type of glass. Despite starting off a bit too chilled for a tripel, it was tasting quite fine, alhough I was getting more on the fruit/floral side rather the malt. I did noticed as it warmed a bit the alcohol became more prominent, to the point of being a bit distractive. Not up there with the best Belgians, but that wouldn’t stop me from drinking it again."
"Overall straight down the middle tripel for me. Can't say I'd want to have this again, but there's worse out there for sure."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into my bruery snifter, Golden in color with a one finger head that lingers. Aroma of bread, citrus and ginger. Taste follows the nose. Sweet bit not too sweet, mouthfeel is average, nothing special here, would take a golden monkey over this anyday."
"This medium-bodied brew has a moderate carbonation and is plenty smooth while also consistently crisp."
"O-With every tripel I try i grow to love them more and more, this is no exception."
"The aroma is heavy on the bublegum but its not so heavy on the tongue. After an intial sweetness a a subtle peppery note finishes the beer. Thanks again Dina!"
"Pours a translucent straw color with a 2 finger head that leaves a thin layer of foam. Big smells of bananas and cloves, with a boozy smell as well. Very smooth taste for a triple - the drinkability is definitely there despite the high ABV. Slight spicy taste, with a minty feel as well. Silk mouthfeel, dry aftertaste. Very good example of a Belgian Tripel, would have liked a little more zest to the taste though, could have seen it being more of a Belgian Strong Golden Ale than a Tripel."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. Looks just like a Tripel should as this golden lighter yellow with a white soapy head. Head does not really stick around. Smells of Belgian yeast, spice, and lemony citrus. A little bit of banana is in there as well. Taste is exactly the same with some nice citrus and banana notes wrapped in spicy Belgian yeast. Well carbonated and medium-bodied. Not the most complex Tripel, but really solid."
"Overall this is a good representation of the style. While it isn't exceptional in any aspect, it isn't bad in any of them either. It does everything well. Quite enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Thanks to Jparkanzky for the extra!"
"Overall: Drinkability is superb, as with the other American tripel I had at this bar, Allagash Curieux. So fresh, chuggable, enjoyable, well balanced. Utterly delightful, and so perfect for the warm late-spring weather! Again, witness how America can brew Belgians with the best of them!"
"O - Pretty good Tripel. Wouldn't hesitate to drink again, but there are better to be had."
"D An OK beer, but I will not be having another. 3.5   "
"This is a very good belgian golden beer. I reccommend picking it up if you find it."
"O/D - Overall a good tripel. ABV is hidden, sneaks up on you. Not overly filling."
"Overall very good Tripel"
"Easily one of my favorite tripels from my favorite brewer. While the ABV is high it isn't obvious in the taste. When you see two empty bottles in front of you surrender your keys. Smells sweet but doesn't taste too sweet which is a welcome surprise. Also the deep snifter glass allowed me to agitate and swirl the beer a lot helping the aromas and flavors come out. The only thing stopping this beer from getting all 5's is the fact that there is no perfect beer."
"Pours a light amber with yeast floating all throughout. The smell is your atypical Belgian Tripel. The taste is super sweet, almost laffy taffy sweet of belgian yeast and banana and cloves. Not the best triple, not even top 3, but 9.3% ABV available in a 6pack for a reasonable price, how can you not like it."
"Overall, I couldn't believe how much flavor was there, mainly because in my head the beer was going to suck. Thank goodness for happy surprises, and this beer was one of them."
"Merry Monks is one of the best year round releases that Weyerbacher has I think. This beer on it's own can show what the brewery is capable of doing. The beer pours as a bright hazy yellow with a big billowy head on it. The head releases some fresh aromas of Belgian yeast, some citrus fruits, and even a little clove might be in there. The taste is refreshing, it's got some nice citrus bite that mellows out into an earthy brew as it warms up. This beer has a good mouthfeel too. It's on the lighter side but still has enough body to not really feel watered down."
"This brew is a pretty solid American version of the classic Belgian style. I must note that I let the rest of the big bottle cool down some before enjoying it and it really helped the hide the heat without cutting down too much on the flavors. I would say that if you live in Weyerbacher’s distribution area and want an affordable but tasty tripel, this would be a good one to go for."
"Overall a very tasty beer. I've been happy with all the beers from Weyerbacher that I've tried so far. If you like Belgian Ales (and monks) then you'll enjoy this one."
"Finish: Sweet grains with hints of coriander"
"Overall, nicely done a good take on this style by a local brewery."
"Drinkablility- I have always found this beer to be quite drinkable to me it maintains the perfect balance between being sweet and having spice on the finish to dry things up, the alcohol is to me very well hidden and presents nothing but a nice warming presence, to me in terms of both value and overall quality this is total homerun, if you compare this to many other beers of the style its quite a nice choice, i recommend as one my favorite beers from the brewery and of american triples"
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, dry and a bit bitter. Really nice drinking, pretty refreshing and decent masked alcohol. Definitely something I'd drink again."
"O: A really surprising and delicious beer. A solid tripel."
"Therefore, i highly recommend giving this beer a try, especially in the 750mL corked bottle."
"O: I love this beer. Even though it's a high ABV, I could drink 2-3 without really noticing. A much try and a go-to tripel for me."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being about average for the style. Drinkability was decent, it had some good flavors for the style and was pretty easy drinking considering the abv. Pretty good beer overall, but not outstanding in the style."
"The body was about average for the style. Drinkability was good, but will depend on how much you like the clove aspect. Overall, a decent beer that I'd have occasionally if it were local to me. Worth trying if you see it."
"This is a big sipper, go easy."
"Well done for an American Tripel. I would buy a few packs of this a year if it was a local."
"Smooth and quite fruity. Very tasty. Refreshing. Alcohol is very well hidden and in-offensive. Awesome."
"Merry Monks, with it's front label picturing a trio of goofing around Monks is at first kinda silly to take in. But on further review, they're acting silly for a reason. They're happy and jolly and of course, merry. And for good reason, this Tripel is great, and if you love the style, this comes highly recommended."
"D/M: Great flavor. Could have used more carbonation but overall a very good Belgian variation."
"D: Enjoyable. Not quite at the level of good trappists, but just a hair shy. Sure makes a cheese quesadilla with kraft singles taste like magic."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew, but i dont think that i will be buying again"
"A beer that I used to frown on when i purchased the Weyerbacher big beer mix case in the pass, no it's one of the one I appreciate and a damn good reason to pull the case. Only a couple will have you feeling Merry!"
"D: aawesome triple with some spectacular flavors and I would most certainly search this beer out again."
"D- one of the spicier tripels in recent memory, but still a decent example of the style. weyerbacher is great at making solid versions of high gravity styles. this makes me want this brewery sold in my state a little bit more. too strong to have more than one or two of."
"Notes: Hmmm, not my fav style, or fav brew but it feels pretty good, with plenty of flavor and could work very well on a social setting as good regional brew to get the people going. I´m going to store up a big bottle of this."
"Golden yellow in color and hazy with a thin white head that cleared quickly. Belgian yeast and sweet banana aromas dominate with hints of pear, hay and a touch of coriander. Sweet malty belgian flavors with lots of banana and a clean finish. A light spice flavor seems to build near the finish but never really surfaced. On the lighter end of medium bodied with pleasant carbonation and buttery smoothness. Spices and alcoholic heat intensified as this warmed up. Thoroughly enjoyed this Belgian ale."
"D: Some bitter hop character w/ stronger malt backbone. Spicy quality is a bit overwhelming."
"D/Overall: Tasty and refreshing, a bit sweet for the style, which makes it more drinkable than typical, but the high ABV should slow most of us down."
"Try it for sure."
"Overall its a nice beer that takes some big chances in flavor and mouthfeel by making it a bit too malty but combining it with sort of a super fruity juice like flavor kind of makes it fall flat of great."
"D. Interesting Tripel. Quite a bit going on in the flavor of this beer that kind of surprised me. This is definitely drinkable. If Weyerbacher can make a Tripel like this I want to get my hands on some of their quads. All in all this is a nice American made Belgian."
"Drinkability: I could actually drink a few of these. I love Tripels myself, and the alcohol is well hidden, so this could be a very ""dangerous"" beer, for that reason. Have a few too many, and they can ruin your night. I find it a very pleasant beer to drink, and will keep some on hand."
"D - This is yet another very fine brew from Weyerbacher. Is was a great brew on New Year's Eve."
"Pours a nice somewhat cloudy amber with a thick, fluffy, somewhat persistent white head. Aroma is malty, fruity and just a bit yeasty. Flavor is definitely somewhat better than I expected - strong, malty, fruity, yeasty, a bit rubbery, with a hint of caramel and most enjoyable and lip-smacking! Texture is fairly smooth, somewhat fizzy, leaving a subtle tingle. This is worth seeking."
"This is a big beer at over 9% ABV and it feels a little too boozey. Overall I really enjoyed this and it is definitely the best beer I have had from Weyerbacher."
"A yellow-gold hue, it produces a nice, thick, soft sliky foamy head on the pour with good retention. The smell reveals what's perhaps its most feature - real potent banana esters, but more like a greasy banana chip as opposed to fresh flesh or peel. And it's quite inviting and truly dominates the aromas and flavors, which both lack pronounced phenol or alcohol presence - meaning, all you have to cope with here is a tasty, moderately malty (in sweetness and body), mildly banana fruity Belgian-style ale. Poor thing! The drinking is smooth and somewhat substantial for the style and, even as it warms up, the alcohol only weakly bites. Yes, it's flavorful and satisfying - quite excellent - multiple beergasms."
"Got a case of the Weyerbacher Big Beers and cant wait to get thru the case, All Weyerbacher brews are always great. Love to treat myself and this is the perfect Christmas gift to me from me !"
"D: This is a delicious tripel with a pleasant spiciness and quite the warming sensation."
"Overall a very nice beer but with some flaws. Certainly enjoyed drinking it but there's some things i would change or do differently. For the price point there are others out there that i would try but for a little bit less i could definitely buy it again."
"D - A very complex beer with plenty going on to please my taste buds. Goes down dangerously smooth for an almost 10% ABV. I had the 12 oz, I would be interested in trying to cork and cage version based on this bottle"
"D= only the ABV keeps it limited to a few at a sitting, otherwise session all you want (and get a designated driver!)"
"D - Drinkability is moderate. While I found myself drinking this quick, often taking multiple sips in vain to differentiate some flavors, if this were toned down on the sweetness and amped in complexity, I could see this as easily (and foolishly) quaffable."
"This beer has a nice golden straw color to it with a thin white head that vanishes quickly to a little bit of lace. The smell is nice and fruity and a little malty. The taste is kinda fruity, it is like a banana, not much else going on. The mouth feel is a little heavy but not to much and is very drinkable."
"D: A solid beer overall but just a tad too sweet for my liking. Almost like a spiced up syrup. The body doesn't help it either. This one's worth a try but I wish I'd served at around 35F instead of 45F... a bit too thick at the higher temperature."
"Deep golden straw color. Head fades, thin white ring around edge. Yeast settles in the bottle but first part of pour remains clear Light slightly spicey aroma. Small hint of orange peel. Some malt also in aroma. Sweetness in aroma as well. Mild to moderate carbonation. Dryer alcohol finish. Breadiness in middle of drink. Orange peel and coriander presnt but well balanced. Pretty good rep for style. Nothing spectacular but very nicely done."
"m/d - alcohol is hidden in the nose and taste, but you can feel it in the mouth. leaves a nice tingle, but a bit of a sour puss also. the sweetness is a bit intense on this one, but this is definitely a tripel i'd have again. it is a bit thicker than i'm used to for the style and it works. abv is very well hidden/blended."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I've always wanted to try this being that I'm a fan of Weyerbacher, but I never wanted to purchase an entire sixer being that I'm not really that into most Belgians. It's pretty good. Alcohol is well hidden, and it's smoother than I expected. That being said, there's nothing exceptional about this beer. Every so often I come across a Belgian that wows me, but this one is just well done."
"Tastes was majorly consistant with the smell, only had a brutally sour finish, and IMO a varried aray of dry not compatable fruit flavour with Pear really leading the way."
"Three finger, tight bubbles, off white head from the pour. Foam like lacing that has real clinging power. Color is a cloudy 6 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells of fruit, pear, plum, citrus, and sweet malt. Tastes are that of currant, pear, plum, clover honey and malt. Creamy and full of body in my mouth and back of my throat. Very pleasurable balance of flavors, maybe a little on the sweet side with a little too much carbonation, but well worth the price."
"I have had this a few times in the past and decided to revisit it. The appearance is a thick honey color with a small head. I taste candied fruit, vanilla, and a herbal quality. The mouthfeel is ok, carbonation about right, but it seems to leave a metallic quality. Drinkability however is above average, the alcohol is masked and this offering from Weyerbacher is fairly easy to drink. Merry Monks is a good tripel from a US brewer, but there are other domestic examples that warrant greater attention in my opinion."
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall, but it could have been so much better if it was well-balanced. The smell had me sold but the flavor quickly fades from quite good to not so good."
"Drinkability: this beer has a lot going for it, particularly the feel and, to a lesser extent, the aroma; however, its harshness of flavor really does detract from the experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to have this again."
"I plan to hold one of these for a few months. It was a complex brew that could be pretty awesome after some age to blend the flavors."
"Oh man, i expected more from this beer. It poors well, I nice golden straw color with half a finger head in a Chimay chalice. The smell is strongly bready and yeasty, the taste the same with some clove, banana, and grassiness to it. When cold there was a strong metallic taste. It goes down smooth hiding the alcohol very well. I can keep drinking these, but the taste is nothing special."
"Pours golden with a bit of visible carbonation. White head and a good deal of lacing. The nose brings forward quite a bit of spice along with a good deal of booze. A bit of banana and clove in the background. A bit of a twist. Light fruits as well. Taste is fairly boozy with some fruit and spice. Medium mouthfeel that is a it cloying with sweetness and some booze. Drinks fairly well, but is a bit unorganized in the end."
"Goes down as easy as a 9% beer will do, but can't hold up against the Belgians."
"Nothing worth writing home about but definitely not a sour note in Weyerbacher's repertoire. At 6.99 probably worth it if you haven't tried it. I would go back but not a noteworthy buy."
"Overall: This is a really good traditional style triple. Very drinkable and flavorful. Weyerbacher does a lot of styles very nicely. Would definitely drink again."
"Appearance is a hazy golden yellow. A creamy head that quickly fades to a thing layer. The smell is of banana and spice. Taste is spicy, alcohol is evident. This is a very nice and smooth beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky. I could have 1 or 2 of these. 9.3% alcohol is a bit much to have any more."
"Edited a week later: For the remaining beers I decanted carefully leaving most of the sediment behind, and I preferred it this way. I found the taste and mouthfeel improved, crisper. I upped my rating in both characteristics."
"M/D - Silky mouthfeel and medium body. A little more carbonation would be nice."
"Overall impression: crisp and tasty, this is a average tripel."
"D: medium-high. not overly sweet or evidently strong."
"awesome, creamy, soapy mouthfeel. a forceful bitterness and a kiss of alcohol creep at the end. finishes somewhat dry"
"D - Another must have. If another of these is drunk now one will mind !!!"
"D- Despite the alcohol content and the taste at the end, its a pretty decent beer. Gives you a nice aftertaste too. Clearly not a session beer though."
"D-this is well balanced and quite refreshing. the feel is great and the balance of sweet and spice is well done. this is a tasty brew that has a nice complexity to it."
"d- good drinkability here, belgians are a once in awhile beer for me and i enjoyed this one. can't really go too wrong with weyerbacher."
"D - Decent. The wonderful flavors keep me coming back for more of this. You can pretty much tell you're drinking a 9% beer, but this is really good overall. A solid example of a tripel from an American craft brewer."
"This beer poured a golden amber color with a rather small head. It smells spicey and like most other belgin tripes. Tasted of a very traditional tripel a bit more spicey then usuall though, as always a nice strong taste but still easy to drink. Overall a pretty good beer nothing to special but would get again."
"Bottle. Belgian yeast smell along with some dark fruit aromas. Poured a pale yellow clear with sediment/floaties in it even though we didn't really shake the bottle all that much. Slight head. Taste is ok with the banana/fruit/yeast notes highlighted. Ends rather with a slight bitterness."
"D: A good beer to savor and sip, but at over 9 ABV it's not one you want to have more than 1 or 2 of in a given night."
"Tripels used to be my favorite beers but now they're down the list a bit. This one is maybe a little too sweet for my current tastes, and I was a little disappointed in the lack of complementary flavors to balance the sweetness."
"The beer pours a striking gold color with good head retention and lacing. Don't get a whole lot on the nose, just some light honey, clove and a hint of citrus. On the palate, this beer is much more impressive. It's fairly sweet, and seems to be dominated by flavors of clove and honey. However, there is some underlying citrus and spice that I think adds to and enhances the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to full, but for such a high abv. beer, it's not the least bit heavy or tiring on the palate. Ultimately, I thought drinkability was pretty good in this beer, though given the amount of richness/sweetness, I'm not sure I could ever drink more than one. In any event, another very solid beer from the folks at Weyerbacher."
"D- This is a very nice Belgian Triple. Certainly a sipping beer, good with a great meal, actually used some of it in a mushroom cream glaze for my steak tonight, very nice."
"D- Decent beer, do not know if I would buy again."
"M & D: good mouthfeel and easy drinking for its EtOH"
"Future outlook: A decent, enjoyable tripel that came free thanks to a buddy. Socked away a few for aging, so I'll reserve full judgment until those get sampled."
"Overall, Merry Monks Golden Ale is a nice example of the style. It's easily drinkable & is right on target with the characteristics of a Tripel. Although not the best rated one available on the market, it still hits the spot."
"I'd go with a strong cheese to counteract the sweetness of the beer, or a nicely done beef of some sort."
"The beer pours a murky tangerine with a voluminous off white head. Retention is good, but lacing is nonexistent, which is inexcusable for the style. The nose consists almost entirely of juicy, fruity pale malts, but it's a bit weak. Bubblegum sweet malts open each sip, followed by a brief blast of intense spiciness, before an overbearing alcoholic heat takes over to finish. As the beer wamrs the boozy quality fades to an acceptable level and yields to the yeast induced spiciness (though it never disappears). Mouthfeel is decent, but the carbonation is a touch on the high side. The harsh alcohol taste at lower serving temperatures slowed me down and left the majority of the beer to be enjoyed warmer (and better). Average it out, and drinkability is alright. Merry Monks isn't a bad beer, but there are plenty of tripels out there a fair bit better than this one."
"D: A good tripel but not in the upper tier. The aroma and flavor are not as clean as this style demands, but it is still good and an enjoyable brew with nice peppery melon-light fruit character and good feel."
"D: Average drinkability. Intensity of flavor and sweetness (plus the ABV) keep this rating middle of the road. Twelve ounces is great, any more would be a chore for me."
"Weyerbacher Merry Monks' is a very lively, hazy golden ale with a thick, foamy head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a fuity, spicy aroma with notes of banana, tropical fruit, earth and barnyard. It's medium, maybe medium-light, bodied and very fluffy and bubbly in the mouth. The finish is soft, clean and very dry. It has a very phenolic flavor. It's almost meaty. The fruity tones are not as prominent in the taste as they are in the aroma. The phenols stop just short of tasting like Band-Aids. There's the slightest hint of bitterness at the finish. It's a pretty good Belgian session ale, kind of along the lines of Orval or something."
"D - I REALLY like this brew. I'm not very exposed to the style. Have had Victory's Golden Monkey and the Chimay and that's it. I'm a big fan of dubbels but I'm not very familiar with Tripels or Quads yet. But this Tripel is damn good. The best I've had of the three so far. I'll be exploring this style some more very soon."
"Drinkability: Decent Tripel overall, but too sweet for my tastes and trumped by many others available. Worth trying; maybe not worth seeking out again."
"Maybe it was a bad bottle, I'll chalk it up to that---maybe. Compared to other similar styled beers, this was quite a disappointment."
"Overall, decent Belgian, but nothing crazy. It doesn't represent a tripel very will with all the booze showing and I can't stress that enough. This is a very slow sipper. Drinking a full bottle would be a task."
"Pours a hazy gold with two finger white head, fades to a thin layer, spotty lace. Smell: spicy, lots of sweet pale, greenish banana, a splash of spicy / leafy hops. Taste: sweet pale malt, pear, some unfiltered apple juice, spicy and grainy, a touch of banana and wheat tang. A little booze. Something is a little off, not sure what it is, the slight tang and the hopping maybe?, but fairly tasty. Light bodied, fairly low carbonation, drying and sweet finish."
"Drinkability is good as well, nice example of the style, the price isn't bad either."
"Cloudy medium amber with frothy white head. Nice lacing. Aroma sweet fruits. Taste banana, esters, light fruits, Belgian yeasts. hops subdued with clean finish. Palate a little thin. Overall a nice beer, better than most US attempts at the Belgian style, especially within the tripels."
"Nice solid dopplebock."
"drinkability: I had this at a weyerbacher tasting in charlotte with chris wilson. I was very impressed with this beer and most of all the weyerbacher products."
"D - I can't quite place my finger on it, but the whole isn't quite equal to the sum of the part... Perhaps a bit too boozy and medicinal... Not a bad offering, but not in the running in terms of memorable Tripel or Weyerbacher offerings... Some aging might actually aid to mellow this one out and tame it a bit..."
"Weyerbacher shines w/ this one."
"This is a unique twist on a pale ale. I wish it had a little more hops, less sweet and it could be really good."
"A nice medium body, with a bitter mouth feel that surprisingly isn't too over the top. For 9.3% ABV, Weyerbacher has pulled it off by offering up a great tasting brew--which reminds me of Franziskaner's Weissbier (but much stronger)--that at least matches, if not out does, the high level of alcohol."
"That little kick in the mouthfeel pulls down the drinkability as well. The high ABV also makes this seem a little hot, and almost distracts from the feeling as well. One to enjoy, and enjoy one."
"Though this is 9.3% it doesn't taste it at all, I could find myself drinking a few of these without realizing it."
"D - A different take on the style, but it was not unpleasant. Interesting is a good way to describe it. Perhaps it is a bit too fresh."
"D: The high abv says that you should not have too many, but i could definitely have a few of these. Not too many cuz its too sweet to drink a lot, but i could drink 2 or 3 of these in a night"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of fruit, spices, some alcohol, a bit sweet. Taste is great, fruits, spices, yeast, very well balanced and delicious. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a high quality brew."
"Hazy gold color with a good bit of head. never would have expected such a smooth easy to drink beer with a abv of 9.3. couldn't taste the alcohol at all. it's a decent beer but to me nothing really too exciting about it. To me a bit pale in comparison to some other triples i've enjoyed."
"Pours a cloudy gold color, 2 finger head that falls very quickly. Nice nose of ripe bananas, spice, and honey. Also, a noticeable alcohol burn in the nose. The flavours hit hard on the palate. All of the scents translate well to the taste with the warm alcohol making it's presence well known. Also a touch of toasted malts present. High carbonation as well, making for a crisp, fresh mouthfeel. Overall, a bit boozy for my taste. Might be too young but with no bottle date, there's no way to tell."
"D: Wonderfully drinkable this beer is a good american version of a great traditional style. It is meant to be savored."
"Pours from the 12 ounce bottle a hazy, golden color, with a big, long-lasting, rocky off-white head. Smells fruity and sweet, with hints of green apple. Highly carbonated, lightly spicy and easy drinking. Alcohol is well hidden in this one. A good, but not great, American tripel."
"Very drinkable, a good triple though not the best I have ever had"
"Poured a light amber with a nice consistancy. Well rounded beer with a decent drinkibility when considering this is a whopping 9.3%! Good taste, but gets a little monotonous half way through. Strangely comes back around again at the end though, and finishes clean, kinda nice. Big fan of Weyerbacher, and this is another good one, but they've done better (ie Zotten). I'll definitely buy this again when I'm looking for a good tripel (admittedly not my favorite) that packs an overhand right to the face. Or if I'm trapped in a monastery and want to get drunk, either way....Good stuff here."
"I'm not going to bore you with the usual, I just wanted to jump on here and say that I had a Belgian Bottle sized helping of the Monks and all I can say is it wasn't my favorite. It had great potential with it's initial sweetness but it turns dry and fusal half way through. However, I imagine if you prefer your Tripels to be on the dry side then you may really enjoy Merry Monks. Personally the residual sweetness seen in this style of ale is what draws me to Belgian styles. And Merry Monks doesn't have what I am looking for. You may enjoy it more than I so don't let this review prevent you from getting some. Just not my thing."
"The flavor is sweet and kind of musky with a phenol medicine taste and also a banana and plum taste. The finish is complex with the lingering effect of both the phenol and fruit taste. There's a chalky like yeasty flavor throughout. There seems to be a bit of tart apple and tobacco, with an herbal edge towards the ends. The tobacco is felt on the tongue in the aftertaste. The mouth feel is very nice, not to thin and almost a bit close to cloying as these flavors are abundant but somewhat scattered. Overall though, a good triple and one of the more authentic ones I've had from an American brewer."
"D - pretty good. you can taste the alcohol but not overwhelming"
"Pours an ever so slightly hazed yellow straw color with a tint of orange. Belgian candied sugar and light toasted grains with a faint citrus smell. This might be a little off, I just brushed my teeth. Sweet malts and candied sugars on the palate, not overly sweet like some tripels. Semi dry finish with a touch of hop bitterness."
"Decent american tripel. Glad I was able to try it. Not the easiest to drink given the sweetness and booze taste levels. Still pretty enjoyable though."
"Overall I believe this one is definitely more rounded than my current favorite golden monkey since it has more flavors of tart fruits and a sort of bubblegum yeast. Glad I picked this one up since someone recommended it to me, Pick it up if you love the style!"
"It is definitely not the most complicated triple available in the USA - but it is highly reliable as a tasty and drinkable belgian style ale."
"D- My 2nd go around with this beer was better than the 1st, but it's still kind of big for the style that's advertised on the bottle, both in feel and alcohol content which is well masked but felt. I will go for this again, possibly in those new caged and corked 750's, maybe there is a difference there."
"D – No more for me. I am as hit-or-miss on Weyerbacher’s stuff as any brewery including DFH. This is a miss, due to its unbalanced and crass nature."
"Delicately frothy microfoam, gets close to three fingers upon the pour but dissipates swiftly, even surface without much dimpling, similarly no real lacing left behind. Super-hazy yellow-orange color, fully opaque, lightens a touch at the outermost reaches. Aggresively sweet nose of apricot paste, poached pears and peaches, banana compote, golden honey, cinnamon, dessert yeast, orange juice, clove might be the hardest edged element there, a one trick pony. Full-bodied with a fluffy feel, like a mouth full of cotton candy. Which is not far from how it tastes too. Banana, strawberry, peach, apricot, pear, red cherry, pineapple, a veritable fruit cocktail sloshing about. Luckily, there is a bitter kick at the end, almost shocks you awake. Orange, lemon citrus alternates between sweet and sour. Coriander, clove, nutmeg spice, but without much directed role. Pulls some of its shit together by the end, but this is probably as random as everything else. Good if you have a serious sweet tooth."
"D-due to the heavy body and bigger alcohol presence this is not as drinkable as other examples though its still very drinkable (which to me is a trademark of the style) and very tasty"
"Overall, an average take on a style I don't particularly embrace."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a hazy gold with the slightest touch of orange. Big bubbles in the fluffy white head quickly disperse leaving about an eighth inch of tightly packed foam. Definitely has a medicinal note in the aroma off the bat. Smell then goes to banana, apple, raisins, and hints of alcohol. Tastes super. Herbal tart apple, banana, and an underlying citrus note. Alcohol has a nice warming feeling as it goes down. I'm pretty impressed with this brew. The only problem is that it's hard to sense the 9.3% and with the flavor, I could ""accidentally"" have too many of these at one sitting."
"Maintains many of the same notes. The Spiciness has blended much more completely and seems better balanced. Yeasty notes have faded but a banana flavor has developed. Carbonation is more tolerable and works better as the flavors have balanced out. Not a huge difference and, as always, there are many variables but I like this one better after a little time in the cellar."
"Wow, I like it. Very delightful higher alcohol brew. I must remember this one."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a clear gold with a bi9g effervescent head. The aroma is fruity and sweet. The taste follows, much less ""spicy"" than some tripels. It is well carbonated, and medium in body. I liked this beer, but IMO its flavors are more like a Belgian Pale Ale."
"Gold colored beer with a slowly fading head.You really have to sniff hard to get anything on the nose.Taste is bannana,fruitiness and booze.A nice beer that gives a warm kick on the back end.This is not your beer pong brew!I would recommend and purchase again."
"Carefully decanted into my Duvel tulip. Pours a cloudy golden color with almost no head. Just a thin ring of bubbles that hug the glass. The appearance comes back with a healthy amount of spotty lacing during consumption. This just smells like a tripel should. Fruity and sweet with sugar. Some vinous qualities as well. The flavor is likewise that of some of the finest from Belgium. Fruity and vinous with a little sweetness to counter the alcohol in the finish. Finishes clean. The body is on the lighter side of medium and has abundant but not harsh carbonation that goes well with the flavors. I did not know what to expect with this beer and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the flavor. But look at that ABV, that will limit consumption."
"This one falls about mid way to slightly towards the top in the ranks of tripels I've had."
"Sadly, it seems to be getting less drinkable as I get through it, though I had high hopes for this beer. It certainly won't keep me from trying other Weyerbacher brews, but it's not what I'm looking for in a golden ale. Perhaps the lack of complexity ultimately makes this easier drinking than your average 9.3% beer, but but for a Belgian style this one is lacking in subtlety and nuance."
"Quite drinkable. Alcohol is well-hidden, only revealing itself in a gentle warming. Merry Monks' is a solid American stab at a Belgian Tripel. Nothing ground breaking, but with a good price tag this beer satisfies and does not break the bank."
"Drinkability: I actually like this beer a lot. Its almost more like a BSPA to me, but whatever. The taste doesnt quite live up to the smell, but overall, this is a really nice beer."
"D: A rather fruity, perky tripel from Weyerbacher. Interestingly tart, but this has a full flavor profile and is a rather nice interpretation of a popular Belgian style."
"(Bottle into a trappist glass) Poured a dark amber/ light orange color with no head. Aroma had a hint of fruit sweetness and citrus. Also a very heavy yeast smell that reminded me of Thanksgiving stuffing! Taste was a little sweet which does not really fit the style. A good beer, but more reminiscent of a very strong weizen. Warning, the alcohol is very well hidden here...that 9.3% will catch up to you!"
"Bright yellow with a finger of white head; decent lacing. The smell was overwhelmingly acidic lemon, and maybe a little pineapple and blood orange. The flavor was undeniably one-dimensional, with lemon zest piercing through from start to finish, and only the most minute trace of orange peel in the finish. The mouthfeel was lighter than expected, but at least spritzy. I'm sorry, but this is not a stellar example of a tripel."
"D- Smooth drink but not for me. A fan of tripel may find it phenomenal I believe, but again, not for me"
"This beer pours a cloudy bright orange color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes into a small cap of firm lacing that last a while. The aroma is of citrus, moderate funk, floral notes in the background, and a hint of alcohol. It is very pleasing. The taste is funkier than the aroma, the alcohol is more prominent. The citrus and floral notes are still there, but they are toned down some. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with appropriately high carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very nice tripel. It might not stand up to some of the classic Belgian examples, but it is totally drinkable nonetheless."
"Overall: The mouth feel is spicy yet creamy rich and astringent. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is almost full. This beer carries a lot of flavor and is rather good. The head was a real disappointment. The taste was more pronounced than the nose. I was hoping for some balance in the beer's flavor, it is jumbled."
"pours a light orange color with a nice sized head that doeas dissipate to a nice amber ring..the smell is bananas clove coriander apples and pears ...the taste is pure belgium it starts with a banana and clove hit then some nice yeast taste followed bt a sweet malt..this is a nice offering from weyerbacher it drinks like a belgium pale ale its quite tasty the 9.3 abv is well hidden but i like the breweries ipa's better..this one is however is solid and a great one to try if you like the style..i did and its recommended"
"Pours a light colored amber/orange with big frothy 2 fingers of slightly offwhite head that slowly fade to just a thin film across the top of the beer. Nose is full of sweet smelling cloves, yeast and bits of citrus. This is one cloudy bastard, perhaps I was a little too rough on the pour because the particles making it appear cloudy are individually identifiable and some of them are rather dark and large floating around in suspension. Carb level is quite high, mouthfeel pleasantly medium and slightly syrupy in the finish as well as warming. Taste up front is full of cloves and a bit of malt sweetness that finishes with a lingering blend of both yeast and cloves."
"D: Good, but not amazing.. a little harsh on the alcohol, but still drinkable. Not bad.. not great, though I would like to try it on tap..."
"D one of my true favorites if you can get it dont hesitate just dive in"
"Drinkability: good good good. tasty and warm. I'd have this one again."
"Overall, this beer is pretty good. Not really to style though since it seems a little more like a strong German hefeweizen than a trippel."
"Aromas of Belgian yeast, esters, faint grassiness. Flavor encompasses these qualities in addition to dried pears some orange juice in the aftertaste. No belgian spice, pepper. Moderate alcohol flavor. No creaminess detected. This is a bit less complex than most Belgian Tripels Ive had, but its incredibly drinkable. You don't get caught up on the flavors, but rather the enjoyment it brings."
"overall, very strong and happy beer, nearly 10% abv will put you to bed fast!"
"Pretty delicious. Packs a punch. A good beer but one or two will be all you need."
"D: Time does this beer wonders. I had this on tap from a 2 year old keg and it was liver killing. This is a nice example of an American tripel. Fresh not so great.With a year on it=win."
"Drinkability: Worth a shot! While not among the top tier of tripels for me, it's no slouch either, and one of the better American-born tripels out there."
"M/D-Very easy to drink.. Wouldn't guess a 9.3%ABV by taste, probably would have guessed 5 or 6... Hint of banana, does taste slightly like a pale ale to me, but fantastic all around, I love this one, and the price at my distributor is only 37.99 a case!"
"I did like it. I will get it again if I find it in my travels."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. Good attempt and pretty tasty. I wouldn't call it a great session beer, but it's certainly worthy and I'll probably have it again sometime."
"M: Creamy and easy drinking. Descent carbonation, really a good (local) tripel."
"This brew is very drinkable - not the best Triple, but very good. Not overly sweet, very drinkable nice yeast and banana flavors. Very balanced brew. Stellar."
"Out of a caged and corked bottle this beer was a murky rusty-gold color with a fistful of sediment and tons of rising carbonation. The head was yellowish-beige, three-fingers in size, retained excellently as a fluffy cap and turned rocky after a while. The lacing was also impressive in sliding sheets. The aroma was of citrusy hops, Belgian yeast, crystal malt, lightly spice and a touch of nuts. The flavors were complex and on-point for a Belgian style Abbey Ale. I tasted, Belgian yeast, toffee, light caramel, floral hops, spicy hops and citrusy hops, alcohol, sweetbreads, a touch of dough and coriander. Semi-sweet and a little tangy. The mouthfeel was creamy, frothy and slightly slick. The body was full and the carbonation lively. This was a very complex and accurate example of the style and one of the best I have seen made on this side of the pond - yum!"
"I initially did not like this one but it does grow on you. Better than I first thought."
"Eric"
"Taste. The strongest flavor is full and savory. Starts with a bite of carbonation. Next comes a champagne like sweetness with a similar style carbonation. Ends with an alcohol and slight hop bitterness. As it warms a nice sourness makes itself known. A crisp, un-sweet tripel."
"CHEERS!"
"Pours a pale yellow, two finger head that reduces to a ring and some lacing. Smell is a bit sweet, and smells of Belgian yeast, like you'd expect. Taste is very coyingly sweet. You can get too sweet a taste in the mouth and a lingerin sort of unpleasant bitterness in the back sides of the tongue. This lingers for a long time. As it warms it gets even sweeter. I'm not a fan of their beers, just don't seem to be to my taste. They do seem to be crafted well, just not to my liking."
"Drinkability is ok nothing spectacular again a little to heavy, and a little to spicey for a good session."
"D - Unimpressed to say the least; a fairly average beer. Too much sweetness and ultimately one dimensional. Not enough balance between fruit and dryness (in the form of carbonation or phenolic qualities) and the sweetness goes unchecked. A tripel to pass by."
"Not a bad beer."
"Very crisp mouth on this. Time has not mellowed out the carbonation, of which I am surprised. Carbonation level is medium-high. Flavor is full of pear, pineapple, grapes, and finishes with a sort of drying bread-like taste. Wow. This really aged well. I'm sure this is a tamed down version, but I haven't a recent release to compare it to. I really liked this age. Pretty easy to consume because the alcohol ""burn"" has worn off...though its presence is known. Very good. Recommend."
"D: I'm a fan...I generally like tripels and this is no exception...I didn't notice the ABV with Merry Monks as much as with Golden Monkey, but the flavors weren't quite as pleasing to me...overall, a really good beer that I would not hesitate to get again"
"Pretty much explodes out of the bottle with massive overflowing foam. Liquid isn't so much cloudy as chunky - I guess the settled sediment was stirred up quite a bit. Nose is pungent Belgian yeastiness with lots of tropical fruit and sour aromas. Some sharp funk and grassiness round out the nose. The flavour is much more mellow with strong banana and some orange, lemon and yeast. A little bit spicy and herbal - coriander and cloves. Light body and finely carbonated. Pretty drinkable."
"For those of us that enjoy a good Tripel this is a merrymaker indeed. For others this large bodied beer, as with other of it's style, would probably only pass as moderately drinkable."
"Drinkability: Moderately high for a Belgian - I could probably attempt two of these in a sitting but the ABV is pretty significant as it clocks in at 9.3%. The flavor is great and it doesn't feel very heavy in the stomach, but it definitely packs a punch."
"Notes: This one is definately a slow drinker but it's very tasty. Cheers."
"Not a bad tripel, not outstanding, but decent, I would buy again."
"Murky orange with a large, white, foamy head that forms quickly but diminishes quickly as well. Smells of yummy Belgian yeast and fruit. Taste is very good. Yeast, spices and banana. Warm alcohol on the finish. It has a medium body, lightly crisp texture and lively carbonation. It was an enjoyable and respectable American-made Tripel. If I wasn't so pissed, I might give it a better review."
"prolly couldnt drink this all night simply because of the alcohol, but still a very delicious beer. prolly the best american take on a belgian style from an american brewery that ive had so far. i know there definately better stuff out there in that category, but in a blind tasting, i dont think you could tell the difference from an authentic belgian tripel. highly recommend this one."
"D - Incredibly smooth and drinkable - could be dangerous because of it's high ABV."
"I couldn't drink too much of this beer, but I definitely recommend it highly."
"Drinkability: This could be a dangerous one, very easy to quaff down and is very flavorful. I got loads of sugar on the first couple sips but it died down once the alchol reared it's head as it warmed. I liked this one, had just the right amount of elements to make it an interesting beer. Well done!"
"Still, none too shabby. I will revisit because it is pleasant and drinkable."
"D- This is a beer i will purchase occasionally, not on the regular rotation."
"Pours a pale yellow color. The beer has the smell of a hint of bananas. The taste is sweet, with a hint of bananas. The taste reminds me more of a hefeweizen. There is no feel of carbonation to the beer. The drinkablity is very high. For a beer with a higher ACV it is easy to drink and very good."
"D - I wasn't head over heels for this one...but you could have two of these in a night and it would be a good night!"
"Overall: A fine example of a Belgian Triple, not overly sweet as some Triples are."
"The 750mL bottle is head and shoulders above the 12oz bottle. It's almost a different beer."
"Drinkability- Moderate. Seems like it'd pair very well with different foods, but on it's own, I'd say one is enough for now."
"Overall this was a solid beer, but there was just nothing that stood out to me. I would drink it again, but not necessarily search for it."
"Even at 9.3%, this went down pretty easy. Flavors are balanced, so it is fairly drinkable, but not one after the other - obviously. I'd grab this one again if I was looking for the style."
"D - One is fine, but this is definitely on the sweet side of the style."
"Tastes of lots of fruity yeast. Pale malts and clove. Peppery spice. Medium body, good carbonation. Coats the mouth nicely."
"Don't want to knock this ones as its my first tripel, s maybe i just dont like the style. Fruity smell, taste was a bit sour and bitter yet sweeter finish. Pretty easy to drink but I' not a fan of how bitter it was. Surprisingly smooth for a 9.3% abv. Really need to be in the mood for this one if you are someone who likes sweeter beers."
"Very drinkable. Especially with the ABV so well hidden."
"Notes: If you happen to buy a sixer or so of this, you absolutely MUST age at least half them. Absolutely amazing with a few months under their belt."
"d - everything works well for a very good triple. one of my favorites."
"Overall, fairly drinkable, nice fruity esters good alcohol profile but it pops through more than I would like and almost dominates at times."
"Overall a real good belgian ale, on the sweeter side. Alcohol is not burning."
"Overall, a good brew, some intense flavor offerings to be experienced and worth a future visit."
"Pours a very hazy and cloudy orange with a thick head, that sticks around for a bit. lacing is generous. lots of sediment from yeast. nose is pear and a bit bready. some apple in the smell too. taste is fruity in up front. kind of muted and blended together a bit, but then decidedely apple and citrusy in the finish. mouthfeel is well carbonated and is a bit dry in the finish. there is a bit of alcohol burn in the end, but pretty well hidden. not bad overall but kind of wish it was a bit drier in the end. Some strange aftertastes as well."
" This is not a bad beer but it's just a bit too strong and up-front for my taste. The Quad of one of the Ommegang beers would be higher up on my choice for Belgian brews that orginiate from my neck of the woods, but if you're looking for a mildly complex Tripel with no spice and lots of warming potential, than this your beer!"
"Drinkability: Not the best tripel I've ever had, but not a bad one by any means. The taste could use a little refinement, but it's a solid beer. There are other tripel's I would rather have for my money, but it's not a bad beer by any means."
"Notes - This is a sweet, sour, floral, Belgian style beer."
"4.0 D: Not bad at all. I would go to this anytime if I were in the mood for a tripel."
"D- I could sit down and easily drink 2 or 3 of these. After the first sip this brew just keeps asking for another taste."
"d - Drinks just fine - probably a little easier once the carbonation weakens a bit. I could see throwing these back on a chilly evening. I've had Belgians that hide their 8-10% a little better but this beer does an above average job."
"Notes: I had planned to have this on tap in Rochester, NY but when I got to the place that had it (The Old Toad) I forgot the name of it and only recalled it after a few beers and a hearty dinner. I simply could not have another that night. What a great beer. My highest compliments."
"Poured into a duvel glass, light to medium golden in color. I did not know that this beer was classified as a tripel until afterwards when I went to Weyerbacher's website. Smell and tatse were much more like a belgian strong ale. Alcohol and white fruits were evident in the aroma. At its coldest temperature, the mouthfeel was very fizzy, and the belgian funk was evident along with some sweetness. As the beer warmed, banana and pear became more evident, as did the alcohol. Very warming, and surprisingly drinkable for the alcohol content. Yet another phenomenal big beer from weyerbacher."
"This beer ain't no Coors Lite...haha."
"The feel is fizzy like champagne, and also syrupy. A bubbly bite on the way down. Fizzy, citrusy, sweet and strong. A decent offering."
"Overall-meh, an ok Tripel, nothing too outlandish or special, would like to see it aged."
"This one's not the best Tripel in existence but it's still quite tasty."
"The taste is quite drying, lots of clove, orange zest, some rind flavors, definite efforvescence on the tongue from the yeastiness. There is a slight medicinal sweetness to the beer, clove, lemon citrus, and a full palate of sweet malts. This is a sipping beer because of its strength, but the 9.3 ABV is quite well hidden, and there is no throaty burn or unpleasantly alcoholic aftertaste. The beer is not particularly syrupy, although it is quite medium to full bodied. There is a bit of a sting on the tongue, and the mouthfeel is a tad tingly from the yeastiness and efforvesence. This is a nice representation of a wonderful style of beer. L'Chaim."
"D-Nice stab at the style....I like this and would definitely buy it again...not elite but not real far off.."
"This brew could be fairly drinkable. It's crisp, refreshing, and flavorful. But, at over 9% I wouldn't recommend having more than a couple."
"D- Its a pretty drinkable beer. It's slightly sweet with a few interesting undertones that make it fun to drink. It dosen't fatigue your taste buds or fill you up to much. With the high alcohol and sweetness, I can only drink 2 or 3 at a sitting. Cheers!"
"D: This is a good imitation of a Belgian tripel. Not quite as refined as those beers, but tasty nonetheless."
"My first tripel since I found the need to review one. Very high carbonation with low head retention. Heavy phenolics from the get go, but a smooth inhale with a pronounced banana fragrance. Found quite a lot of pear/apple in the first sip, and a bit one-dimensional as the temp increased. An enjoyable drink, but a bit much for a session. This is a good beer, and as it was purchased directly from the brewer, very fresh."
"Merry Monk's is a rather hearty tripel, nicely crafted but lacks some strength in a couple areas of what makes a great tripel. Aroma is very malty with some nice fruity tones along with a small amount of spice. Nice pour, good rich dark golden color decent white head and strong steady carbonation. Mouthfeel is very malty with a touch of alcohol but still relatively smooth and easy. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor but to be fair it lacked that peppery spiciness and needed a stronger fruit component to rank it any higher. Nice yeastiness and as previously stated the malt content can't be questioned. Mmmm, not bad at all."
"It goes down pretty easy. I could have a few of these in a [long] sitting, but am not sure I would choose to."
"Overall: A good ""golden"" ale (technically it's a tripel?) with plenty of spice and banana-malt character. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a clear yellow color with a lot of carbonation rising to the top to for a decent white head that thins but laces. Smells very sweet, cant pick out anything specific. Taste sweet alochol and sweet spices. Mouthfeel was awesome except for the initial alcohol bite, but it was so smooth from there on out. Drinkability it awesome, it goes down easy. I could of had 1 more."
"bottle poured a golden straw color with a fair amount of sediment and a thin white head that fell quickly. aroma has sweet malt, light spice, snappy yeast, faint fruit, and light alcohol. mouth feel is medium light with medium carbonation. flavor has lots of sweetened malt, caramel, spiced yeast, hefty ester fruit, and a back end alcohol."
"The beer pours a murky looking golden orange color. The aroma is both fruity and yeasty. Taste is fruity, yet also has some sour notes associated with some Belgian style brews. Heavy bready character. Medium to heavy body. Feels a bit syrupy in the mouth. Belgians are not my specialty, but I have had some great Belgian beers and this in not one of them. Not bad though."
"Oddly, the first few bottles from the six pack where much more drinkable when I cracked them open the other night and enjoyed them without thinking about the flavors too much. Some beers get better when you examine them carefully, others don't. Unfortunately, this beer is one of the latter; it just doesn't stand up to real scrutiny."
"D: OK. Went down fairly easily for a beer of this strength."
"D: It is a bit thick and heavy for a tripel but the complexity and balance makes it a drink to admire. It would make a difficult session beer but a fantastic sipper. Worth having in the stash."
"BTW: There are some great banana burps with this one."
" This is a beer for the Belgian fans who like the prominent candy sugar taste."
"D- I'm not a huge fan of this style, but Merry Monks is pretty solid. The higher ABV limits the drinkibility a bit. Definitely worth a shot."
"If you ever get a chance to try this, I would say it is worth it."
"Drinkability- Pretty good, this is a solid tripel."
"My first, of hopefully many, weyerbacher beers. This has a great golden color, but the head is lacking a bit. The nose has fruity malts, sweet alcohols and some spicy Belgian yeasts. Taste is a bit sweet, but still good. Maybe just a pich more hops. Medium to full body is well carbonated. A good attempt at the style, but it would be really good if they turned it into a Belgian Double IPA."
"Poured into my Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass a nice dark golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, basically no sticky lacing. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice floral notes, with some spice. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, good floral notes, slight bananna notes, and some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is another tasty Weyerbacher brew."
"I would recommend this beer."
"It's a strong beer, and overall it is enjoyable, but for the tripel category, I think there are others that a preferable."
"Overall this is a great Tripel. Seek it out, it's one of the best, either in the U.S. or in Belgium."
"Solid tripel. Very good. I'll be happy to consume its brothers."
"Nicely done overall however, it feels like I may have opened one too soon.I'll let some age and review it again."
"The drinkability is good this is a nice American example of the style. I would try more and cellar some. Prosit, MK"
"Drinkability-at 9% this is a little hot and can sneak up on you but it sure goes down nicely."
"I poured this Belgian style Tripel into a Chimay Chalise. This beer put the golden into golden ale. It poured a golden amber color with a 1/2 an inch head of fizzy white foam. This fizzy head of foam had good retention that left behind a small white film and spots of white lace. The aroma was lightly citrusy and yeasty with citrus hops, red grapes, burnt malts, and a hint of yeast. There wasn't much going on in the aroma or the taste. The taste was lightly citrusy with a touch of citrus hops, more burnt malts, alcohol, a hint of lemon zest, subtle grapefruit, and a pinch of yeast at the end. Belgian taste? Not really. It was just a beer with little flavor. This was light bodied beer with a faint aftertaste of citrus hops, alcohol, citrus fruits, and a hint of yeast. Not much going on there either. I don't know what to say about this beer. Is it a Belgain style? If it is, then it's on the lower end of the Belgian styles. I sure hope not all of these are like this and I just got a bad bottle. If it's suppose to be like this, then I won't be touching this beer again."
"Drinks pretty good, the booze & complexity do slow you down. A damn good Tripel regardless of where it comes from!"
"Body is medium with a slick mouthfeel and good drinkability for it's strength. Mouthfeel doesn't feel Belgian but still a very nice brew."
"Somehow this ended up in my cooler when I got home from a mountain bike festival. I ain't complaining. I poured the bottle into a pint glass and it foamed to a 2"" thick head, probably due to my swirling the bottle 3/4 of the way through the pour (still left some sediment on the bottom of the bottle). It poured a light, hazy gold and the sediment hung in the glass without settling to the bottom. Smelled of citrus, spice and hops but not overly strong. Had a nice body in the mouth and went down real smooth. The fruit, spice and hops were well balanced and a slight bitter aftertaste lingered after the swallow. I finished the glass while making fajitas, and the glass went down real easy. Bummer that this was my only bottle. I enjoyed this one. FYI, I'm not one to brag but I make a mean fajita."
"D. A good strong sipping beer. A treat indeed. Not the best of trippels but far from the worst. Alcohal is present, not so much at first."
"I love this beer, i wish it was brewed year round. It is about as good as any Belgian import you'll find here, better than some. In fredericksburg, Total Wine carries it. Having grown up in Easton's I am extremley happy wtih Weyerbacher's effort and quality for this beer."
"This is a wonderful brew. It has an aroma that is true to its flavor and masks its high alcohol content well. I wouldn't say it is a beer for anyone due to the high alcohol content and complexity of flavors. This beer has a high amount of citrus zings and malty notes and is very sweet considering the potency of the beer. I highly recommend it to any beer lover or anyone who wants a beer that has a citrus flavoring and wants a little more buzz from their drink."
"D: Tasty, goes down quite easily for a beer with 9.30% ABV, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it might not be the best Tripel out there but it's a good beer to drink for a while."
"Merry Monks Ale pours a hazy orange with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is nice, fruit, sugar, bubblegum all come to mind. The taste has similar notes, as well as a bit of clove. One of the best American versions of a Belgian beer that I've tried."
"Poured the bottle into my goblet glass and received a orangish hue with light head that left a lace ring around the glass. Some hops and sweetness come through in the smell, and also something like flowers or like Fabreeze. It just had one of those ""fresh"" smells as they say. Haven't smelt that in a long time in a beer. Light to medium-bodied, this beer has a some sharpness as it hits the tongue but rides out smooth. While no hop kick is really present, as it shouldn't, there is a wonderful fruit burst. The fruit I tasted most for some reason was cherries, but there were tropical fruits suchs as pineapple in there as well. For a Belgian style triple I thought the spicing was a little lowkey, but the beer still finished with a strong backbite that warmed me up."
"This is a pretty decent (American) representation of a tripel. Poured up a nice cloudy, pale yellow colour; looked like 100's of other tripels. Smell was spicy with a fairly noticeable musty ""funk"" that I would expect more from a saison. Nice. Taste was well balance with a sweet spicy flavour up front and a nice, bitter hop profile on the finish. Mouthfeel is about where it should be for this style with quite alot of CO2. A nice U.S. tripel."
"Drinkability: I like this a lot, actually, which I didn't expect to. The alcohol is hidden very well, though it is dangerously high (approaching double digits). A pleasant surprise that shows what an effect expectations can have on the enjoyability of a beer, in my opinion."
"I ordered a second before the meal was over and would have definitely been satisfied with a third or fourth if we had stayed longer."
"D: Very drinkable. A good american version of the style."
"Not very carbonated, and it would have helped to lighten up the beer. As is, it's a bit sticky and leaves a slightly dry coating in the mouth. Still very drinkable, but I'm afraid putting this ""Belgian-style Golden Ale"" into a Duvel glass might have been way too high a pedestal for its own good, and might have subconsciously over-amped my expectations, too. Even so, all-in-all, the drink ain't bad and I might even like it."
" At 9.3 ABV not for sessions."
"It has a medium mouthfeel and it's pretty highly carbonated. It finishes with an orange tartness mixed with candy sugar. I'm certainly liking this Tripel and I think, once again, that Weyerbacher does some interesting and very flavourable beers in every style they try. So far, at least. ;^) I recommend it!"
"M- grainy and smooth and pungent"
"All together pretty good, many better out there but they do a damn fine job of it down in PA."
"Coked 750mL bottle whose cork hits the ceiling as soon as I remove the cage followed by a rush of bubbles from the bottle. Poured into a Tripel Karmeliet glass a hazy, very bubbly, pale orange with a thin frothy head. Aroma is sweet malts, yeast and some spice, slight orange presence as well. The taste is a sweet blend of malts and fruits with a slight sourness that hits in the very end. The beer is medium for the alcohol content with slight carbonation. This one is enjoyable when bottle conditioned, certainly better than the six-pack version."
"Pretty drinkable, although the flavor going bitter is a bit of a turn-off. Still, I would gladly try this again, perhaps a little colder."
"Overall - This is a pretty good strong Belgian style ale. Quite sweet and a good mouthfeel. I only complain about the very light nose and the appearance wasn't too eye catching either. I may buy again though."
"bottle from ppoitras in No BS 3"
" Taste of some cherry maybe, Spices and Bannana. Sweet! Great Taste very easy to drink. I think this one even improves a little more if you let it warm just a litle the flavors come out more. I must say this is one of my new favorites for a belgium ale."
"mouthfeel is thick, sour, bitter, and delicious - i really liked this tripel"
"Mouthfeel carries and airy lightness and fine carbonation bubbles that are to style. Drinkability is hampered by the sweetness and alcohol presence. Overall not my favorite from a local brewery. I could see some age possibly improving this, but I don't have the experience to back up the claim."
"I'm not sure I can state this directly enough: I hate this beer. The more Weyerbacher beers I drink the more I think that, Double Simcoe aside, there is something about this brewery that just doesn't jive with my palate. I will have great difficulty finishing this 6 pack."
"This is a light Belgian ale, so it poured a light yellow, almost clear, with some fluffy white head. (It almost looked like Mt Dew!) It smelled of wheat and citrus hops (mostly lemon). It tasted like lemon hops and some yeast, with a very light aftertaste. The texture was very thin and carbonated, almost like champagne. There was practically no alcohol flavor, and it was quite easy to drink. Overall it was a good light beer."
"This is not one of my favorite styles, but I tried it because I'm a huge Weyerbacher fan, and I can't get it anywhere in the Midwest, so when I'm out East, I make it a point to drink their stuff. Appearance has never been all that important to me, which is good, because it's the color of wet straw with little head. Aromas of yeast and sugar leap from the glass. It has a long malty middle with a sweet Belgian-y backtaste, like a sweet version of Duvel. On the finish it segues from sweet to dry, a little champagne-like. It hides the alcohol pretty well (not necessarily a plus, since I like a little alcohol presence). Allowing for my lack of predisposition for the style, I'd call this interesting and somewhat distinctive, and those are both pluses in my book."
"Don't drink and review."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is moderate, mainly due to the sweetness. The tastes are light and make the overall impression relatively light, especially given the rather heavy gravity of this brew. The carbonation is great - light but persistent, creating that great creaminess typical of good Belgian ales. The more I drank the more I liked it, prompting me to bump up my original score for drinkability. Try it if you like triples. Good stuff."
"The pour on this beer is a little weak out of the bottle. I would love to try this on tap to see if it differs. It poured a copper color with a small white head that had little to no retention. The aroma was of cherries, spices, and possibly even banana. With the first sip I could pick up on cloves, citrus, and honey. As I continued I picked up on the banana and nutmeg. It was fairly easy to drink. The alcohol taste was muted, but the combo of the fruits was good enough to make it easy to drink. I would love to taste this on tap."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer. Alcohol was a little evident, but was fairly covered up by the banana esters and citrus taste. Mouthfeel was very nice and complimented the taste very well. Definitely a well-rounded brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied, carbonation level is good, and it's relatively smooth. At 9.3%, it is strong and drinkability is somewhat limited. But, overall it's a pretty solid offering. Definitely worth a try."
"Taste is sweet with heavy candied sugar, slight hints of the aforementioned banana, decent malt backing, some of the alcohol tones can be made out, but for the most part are well concealed, carbonation is assertive and crisp."
"D- I have to give this one credit for disguising its alcohol by volume very well beneath the complex flavors. Though the style is meant to be a slow sipper, this one is easy to gulp down if the situation calls for it."
" I haven't had a huge number of brews in this category but I felt that this stuff was a bit too malty and poorly yeasted. I won't buy more."
"D- Wow I could have just watched that head for hours, after each sip it gelled back together and I think I could have written my name in it. The beer had nice sweetness with some supporting flavors that did not overpower it and the hops were a good support."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color with a very thin head. The nose is mostly fruitiness with a little bit of alcohol and spices. The taste starts off with some spiciness and follows through with a very syrupy sweetness and some alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth and slippery with some nice warming from the alcohol. This is a very drinkable beer for something approaching the double-digit ABVs."
"Overall a big beer. Not my favorite style, but overall a nice drink. Only one of these I think :burp:"
"Unfortunately I didn't get much out of this beer except for a slightly off-putting aftertaste. While it had some of the tripel sweetness going on, the yeasty finish was unpleasant in this example and the complete lack of head just sealed the deal for me."
"D: The alcohol presence is clear but this is one pleasure of a tripel that I was more than happy to bring a case of 12ozs home with me."
"d - good sipper and you can feel the alcohol warming you throughout, it doesn't hide at all. this goes down much more smoothly than i thought it would after looking at the label and discovering it was 9.3% ABV. i wouldn't have guessed that from drinking the beer."
"Unfortunately, overtime its watery taste and high content form an unsuitable pair, making me dream of the glory of Victory's Golden Monkey or Chimay."
"This beer makes me think there is an abbey hidden in the hills of Easton, PA."
"Weyerbacher is known for its eccentric, strong, intense beers, and this brew certainly fits the bill From a 12 oz bottle copped singly from wine and more, pours a strawish golden color with slight head and visible carbonation aroma and smell are similar to a Belgian strong ale, with a distinct white-wine characteristic present very strong taste with noticeable alcohol finish go easy with this one the 9.3% ABV hits you hard. Take it slow with this one sweet finish that lingers on the palate drinkable being generous with three with hefty alcohol percentagebanana fruity clove finish unique"
"Nothing is really wrong with this brew (alcohol does raise its head above water as it warms), it just is not up to par with some of the other Tripels I've had recently.. If it was available, I would certainly have a few in the cellar and would pick it up any time I felt like a taste of Belgium."
"Pours a clouded amber gold with minimal head. Nose is heavy with perfume and a citrus edge and also a gummy tone. Flavor is tangy with citrus, but is subdued enough that it isnt overpowering. Feel is gummy and bordering on syrupy from ingredients. Very drinkable. A smooth and well made brew. Anyone in the U.S. who can brew a Belgian style and pull it off is definitely worth giving respect to and trying."
"Two of two for the day... Have that jet-fuel taste to them. This one... Tastes like a young mead. Really sharp on the alcohol... Again, I might save a few bottles for a year or two, but, well, I'm like most folks - I go to the store to buy a beer to drink it right away. Ah well."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Oct 19th, 2007: Cloudy yellow-orange color with a medium fizzy white head that burns off steadily. Quick patches of lacing. The aroma is bread, yeast and sweet fruit. Medium-bodied with flavors of yeast, fruit (banana) and earthy malt. The finish is spicy with banana and pear aftertaste. Overall this is a pretty good beer, although it is definitely on a lower rung than the world class Tripels out there."
"A very nice example of a triple... thanks leftmindedrighty!"
"D = A very pleasant beer. I would be glad to get more of these. Not sure I'd want more than one at a sitting though."
"12 oz bottle into tulip glass. A: Golden/orange, slightly hazy, moderate amount of head that retains pretty well. Pretty good lacing. S: Lots of darker fruit--cherries, raspberries--and some pretty strong banana. Alcohol present. T: Tangy and very sweet up front, lots of ripe strawberries, plums, tropical fruit, alcohol very present on the finish along with some citrus. Yeast, too. M: Coarse, kind of biting, but it sort of works well with the alcohol kick at the end. D: It's a bit one-note on the palate, hard to figure out what's going on underneath the sweeter notes, but definitely a nice beer. I wish I had some bleu cheese or gorgonzola to go with it, I think that would definitely enhance the experience."
"This is a tough beer to get through, I'll be honest. Even after six months it's still a little hot, and the alcohol is at times a little bit offensive. There is a lot going on, and with so much, it's easy to see why it's an 83 point beer; if four or five flavors became one or two this is a high 80's beer. With ALL that said, I'm stoked to see what this becomes next May. This is by no means the best American-made Triple. It's probably only the third best triple to come from Pennsylvania. But, there are not many triple's that are so complex. And while it is not the best, from either America or PA, it is absolutely the most unique and that makes it worthy of trying. A nice effort from the folks at Weyerbacher."
"Poured an orange-gold color into a tulip glass. Foamy white head dissipated quickly into nothingness, with almost no lacing present during the tasting. Scent of belgian yeast and fermented fruit (smell seemed a little off). More flavors of yeast and definitely a hint of banana at the finish. Somewhat lively in the mouth with surprisingly more carbonation than I expected. Definitely inspired by a belgian pale, but didn't quite hit the mark. I've had better from Weyerbacher, but all and all not too bad."
" This seems to be a very inconsistent beer. Mine was not sour as some other reviewers have noticed; instead it was an alcohol bomb (also as some other reviewers have noticed)."
"D - probably one of my favorite styles, I'd be honored to start and finish a night with this."
"this isnt my favorite belgian style beer. Unibroue makes far better and as far as PA brews go, Golden Monkey is still the standard bearer."
"I had had this beer before, but it was a long time and I remembered liking it, so I decided to pick one up as part of my mixed six pack from Abes. Poured into a tulip, golden color, not hazy per se but it did have little pieces of yeast sediment floating throughout that were kind of gross (like smuttynose IPA). Head didn't last long and left only a tiny bit of lacing. The smell was alcohol and fruity esters with a little hop spice. Taste was similar with some sweetness. Light body and fair drinkability--middle of the road, I would say. Not bad, but far from great."
"EDIT: Just like the Old Heathen and others in the big beer case, this one has gotten better over time, as well (at least for me). It has a nice scent, with good malt and sweetness qualities, and a great Belgian ale taste. Could be my tastes are expanding or it could be I've let the last couple of cases sit longer and they've aged better. Either way, I'm good."
"After hearing all kinds of things about this beer and being skeptical, I have to say I've come around. I'm impressed with its drinkability and would definitely like to have a few of these on a cold winter evening with friends."
"Looks and smell considered, when I finally tasted the beer I was a bit taken aback. It's got a very strongly bitter taste. Overall it's not horrible but not exactly great either. A bit bitter for my liking. The mouthfeel is a bit gritty. You can feel the substance there. I would say this is a decent beer to bring over to a friends house. It's very unique and interesting looking all around."
"Big fan of this Easton, PA beer. Maybe I'm partial, though, since I was born there."
"Definitely needs to be more carbonated, I wonder how they carbonated; if they bottle condition or if they inject co2, if they condition I wonder if they re-yeasted or not. Any how decent brew, but defeinalty not a great a representation of a Belgian tripel."
"Not a terrible beer, but certainly not a go-to tripel, that's for sure. Many better ones out there, including American representations of the style."
"Drinkability -a delicious beer, would likely hold up well in the cellar for the more patient among us..."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a large white head after a pretty aggressive pour. If I did that with a real Beligan I would have no beer left. The smell is typical tripel, Belgian candi sugar is front and center, followed by some banana like yeast characteristics. The taste is boozy and sweet, hits pretty hard off the bat. Typical of the American versions of the tripel. The candi sugar and alcohol heat dominate the palate, this brew could use a bigger malt presence to balance. The feel is moderate and a bit syrupy, finishes with alcohol heat on the back of the tongue. An average American tripel, doesn't taste bad just doesn't have the flavor profile or balance of a true Belgian tripel."
"Overall, a nice beer for the style and price, but it's not as balanced as I would have liked."
"It's a stab at the style, and though it has certain characteristics of a Belgian Tripel, it's not the real deal...Even compared to other American interpretations of the style, I'm just lukewarm towards this one..."
"Drinkability: Good. Again, a bit too sweet, even for me. True Belgians rely on the yeast to give a full complexity for beers of this style."
"I think I found that I'm not a fan of this style. It's too sweet and too alcoholic - almost like a really fruity wine. The alcohol cuts through into the aftertaste quite a bit, leaving nothing else on the tongue. It is nicely carbonated and golden colored, and smells very sweet."
"This is a great example of the style, and one that is splendidly drinkable. My only negative from this experience is the complete and utter lack of a head or lacing. Seems to be a popular theme reading thru the other reviews."
"Mouthfeel....great. Very good beer."
"D- This is another great brew from Weyerbacher. My last to review from the big beers sampler-I saved this bottle for reviewing long after the rest were gone. The alcohol is noticable in this one-so one is enough before moving on to a session ale. This is an enjoyable slow-sipper that I will have again."
"257 reviews as of this writing. I would generally call this a decent tripel. Not top of the class, definitely above the mid mark though. I liked the appearance but I found it a touch too simple sweet and more a tartness than I would've otherwise desired in a tripel. I'm glad to have tried this."
"It is fresh, crisp and enjoyable and like most of the big Ws products - distinctive!"
"As far as American Tripels go, this one it topps. This beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with little head. The nose is pungent, and has notes of coriander, spice, banana and light malts. The taste is very complex, and like most tripels a little off putting at how non-alcoholic it tastes (even though its around 9%). The spices are most apparent, with the banana sneaking in toward the end. The finish is terrific. The syrup-like consistency lingers for a long time, and doesn't seem to dissipate until another sip is taken."
"I really hate to be that guy with very few reviews under his belt that jumps on BA to review the terrible but I just don't understand the positive reviews of this beer. I have to jump in here and speak my piece."
"D-one sided beer with banana dominating. There are a lot of issues here. I did not realize this was a tripel when I was drinking it, i thought it was a singel type. I guess the only thing I can say good about it is the alcohol is well hidden"
"This was a treat for me today as I picked up the cold single and drank it straight away this afternoon. Poured a strong light brownish amber with a big, two inch off white head. Lots of foam and lace left over from this one. Lots of visible carbonation was readily apparent. Smell was full of yeast and grain, a touch of alcohol was also present. Picked up some grassy aroma as well. The flavor was a classic tripel. Lots of yeasty flavors, plums, a touch of peach. A lot of bready grains mixed in as well. A touch of alcohol was definatly there and made its presence well known. Great smooth feel due to lots of carbonation. This was actually not as much of a sipper as I would have thought. I was easily able to drink this while walking around no problem. Not saying it would be a session beer, but not a snifter eaither. Overall I was actually fairly impressed with this. Had a great feel and flavor, full body and just a good all around belgian. Gotta love what these american breweries are able to do with these nowadays. Damn impressive for sure, I would efinatly try this one again!"
"Oh, it's tasty, but have more than one and you're not going to get very much accomplished."
"D: That abv, while hidden, could easily do you in. Nice, solid tripel nonetheless."
"overall = another good BIG beer from weyerbacher. crisp belgain flavor, surprisgly high drinkability considering strength"
"D- very high, this is especially good for its alcohol content which i expected to be lower."
"It's nice and sweet, a little too sweet like most American takes on Belgian styles, but for the price it's not bad. The flavor starts with light fruit syrup taste followed an almost hot spice flavor with some pale grains mixed in. It lacks the complexity of the great Belgians, but I still enjoyed it."
"Merry Monks pours a slightly hazy bright golden color with a fizzy head. Aroma is chalky yeast and a sweet graininess. Flavor is sweet pale malts, with plenty of fruity esters and phenolic taste. Yeast flavor is more balanced than the aroma. The alcohol is present but not overpowering for a beer of this strength."
"Once again, another Weyerbacher beer that is too big for its britches. Everything they do is way too strong."
"Good carbonation, enjoyable mouthfeel. A very very drinkable beer, I wish it had less alcohol, I could drink more of it. AT $10.50 for a six pack, this could easily become a regular. One of the un-rateable characteristics is ""Value"". This is a good beer, for the money a damned good beer."
"Cheers"
"Bottle courtesy of Alkey. Thanks again!"
"I really liked this beer. Got this at McKean and Charles in Waldoboro. Todd (the beer guy) is very helpful. Anyway, I digress. The beer was poured into a snifter, and was a golden color with virtually no head. It had a fruity, spicy aroma, with a little alcohol coming through. The taste was similar, although I couldn't detect the alcohol that I thought I had smelled. I thought this to be a good example of a tripel, and would happily drink more of them."
"pours a opaque golden color, three finger white head fades quickly to a ring on the glass.aromas of pear, apple, sugar, and alcohol. taste sugary, fruity sweet, strong alcohol finish. mouthfeel light, poor carbonation almost flat. not a session beer, good for maybe one or two, maybe some aging might take off some of the rough edges and mellow it out."
"Pours perfectly clear and golden with almost no head -- just a bright white ring around the sides of the beer. Without much head, the aroma is pretty slight. Agitation yields pear fruits, white candi sugar and earthy, subdued hops. Very sweet (with some vanilla flavor) to start off with, along with a green apple fruitiness and fresh dough flavor. Hop bitterness is not nearly developed enough to balance things out. Mouthfeel is poor for the style: very sticky and sweet, with none of that Belgian dryness the style needs. I can't think of a single reason to choose this over a more authentic, actually Belgian tripel. It's way too sweet and thick for the style... and even if you wanna throw style out the window, it's just cloying and untasty."
"Note: I do not generally comment on the freshness dating (or lack thereof) on the beers that I'm drinking but in the case of the beers from this case I will make an exception. There is non freshness date on these bottles, however, there is a very clear best before stamp on the case and it claims that I should have drank this by 02/03/07. I can only guess that Weyerbacher puts the date on the case because they are from PA and we here (generally) have to buy by the case, still it would be nice if it was on the bottle."
"12oz brown bottle from Florian's. Cloudy (though surprisingly clear for the style IMO) orange-yellow body with almost no head. Smells like orange, apricot, with hints of spice and alcohol. Tastes like orange, pith, spice, with bits of banana and nut and hints of alcohol on the finish. Lighter in body than expected, and thus very pleasant and easy to drink for a 9.3%abv tripel. The alcohol could be a bit better hidden, but other than that ihis is a pleasant drinkable ale."
"D - Did Weyerbacher change the recipe? Or have my tastes evolved that much? I remember having this before and thinking that it was absurdly sour, lemony and rather unpleasant. This time I am finding it to be exceptionally pleasant. It takes like a tripel this time and not like a lemonstrosity. Had with dark chocolate truffles and chedder cheese - certainly not an ideal pairing, but it was still very good."
"Wow. Considering this ones price and availability on top of its sheer awesomeness, this ones amazing."
"This beer just speaks to me, The head is huge after the intial pour and slowly disapates. Egg shell colored head that is tight and not too airy. The golden straw color is pleasent. The smell of apples, pears, oranges, yeast, and alcohol. Very fruity with a sturdy malt backbone, subtle english hops peak through in the nose. The taste is very similar to the nose. There is a spicy chracter that emerges a little bit past the middle of the taste. The complexity of flavors and levels that exsist in this amazing ale are wonderful . The ABV is hidden very well and the alcohol that is present is at a perfect level. Very easy to get lost in this superb beer. On a critical note this brew lacks sexy bands of belgium lace."
"Drinkability: This beer hides it's ABV very well making it somewhat dangerous if you're not careful."
"Overall, an excellent example of a Tripel. I do have to say that I've had bottles in the past which had a bit of a sour taste, so it is possible, as with any beer, that a single bottle is not representative of the actual beer. I prefer Merry Monks to the aged Prophecy, although I generally prefer the other aged beers from Weyerbacher over their standard issue counterparts. Do not hesitate to try this beer."
"Drinkability - A nice sweet and fruity tripel."
"Drinkability: Very sweet ale, but very enjoyable. Goes down smooth and packs a punch. Liked this much more than Middle Ages's Tripel Crown."
"Drinkability: This is a very moderate Tripel, so I'm going to rate drinkability high here. It has nice flavors and isn't overbearing in any particular dimension. Alcohol, while high, is well hidden."
"Clear gold with a fluffy, bright white head that fell quickly to a long-lasting ring. Some spotty lacing. Aromas of bready malt, light yeast, cloves, fruit, lemon, and alcohol - pretty well put together. The flavour starts out with ripe fruit and bread, but everything falls away by the mid, leaving a bit of lemon, clove and alcohol in the finish. The body's on the full side, just a bit sticky, with fairly low carbonation given the big head produced during the pour. Pretty easy to drink. The alcohol presence is warming, the fruit character decent. Not bad at all."
"Not a bad triple, but not a great one either. The sweetness is a bit much and I find that that oak aging helps this a bit (as seen in Prophecy). Not very complex, this one could se a bit of help. Either way, I still love the Weyerbacher products.... Give this one a shot, it's worth the $2 or so that a bottle costs."
"This poured a golden straw with a very thin head (almost non-existent) but what is present swirls within the glass and is active. The smell is of fruits and spices as one would expect but with some mild smokiness to compliment the malty sugars. This smokiness is not present in the taste, but the spices come through with more strength with fruits, mainly pears and apples. Active carbonation in the mouthfeel but very smooth. Goes down well with enough complexity to keep you tasting, making me want to have more than one."
"Merry Monks would make a great 750ml or 22oz bottle, but all I've ever seen of this is 6 packs which I don't see myself buying again."
"Merry Monks poured hazy and a deep apricot color, with a good, thick head. The nose was spicy, with banana odor. The beer came on full force, but there was a strong alcohol flavor in the aftertaste. The beer was fizzy in the mouth. I am not sure I would drink many of these in a session."
"D: Not a huge fan of tripels and definately not a fan of this one. Abbrasive and off balance. I finished this beer but won't be drinking it again."
"Drinkability: To me I can drink a few of these. Not the greatest at judging Belgian styles yet, still a novice with the belgian styles. I will buy a few more of these, drink a few fresh and cellar a few as well"
"Light yellow in color with virtually no head. The smell is like lemongrass. The taste is quite strong. The alcohol is prominate and the beer has a witbier-like taste. Mouthfeel is fizzy, and the alcohol puts forth a nice burn. But overall, this is not particularly my favorite of the Belgian beers I have tried. I may come back to this once I get accustomed to the style."
"Bottom line: It's no Allagash, but this is a decent tripel and worth a shot. I'm still wondering why <unnamed bar> gave me a pint of the stuff... at 9.3% it's almost as if they want their customers to get drunk and order more or something...."
"Drinkability: A nice sipping Belgian, good for a cold Midwestern night. This one develops and opens up as it warms."
"Not my favorite example of the style, but a decent beer for a powerful punch. I wouldn't choose this but would never refuse it if offered."
"Though it doesn't take a genius, I could tell this was a tripel based on the medium pale color, fruity esters, and hoppy taste. Medium body and just a bit of head. Lots of carbonation. A good tripel but nothing fantastic. Still yet to find an average or below beer from Weyerbacher."
"Drinkability: This brew is kind of an enigma for me. The taste and mouthfeel don't go together, and it makes it hard for me to enjoy."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability - This is a pretty fantastic tripel, the flavor is excellent and makes for a refreshing, easy drinker. It's a bit sweet, but the spices are well balanced. For wonderfully balanced tripels I'd recommend this for those who favor the fruits/sweet somewhat and Golden Monkey for those who prefer exotic spices. Another winner from Weyerbacher."
"Pours a clear golden, nice color, thick white head forms but disappears pretty quick, settles to a thin layer, some lacing. Smell is tons of diacetyl, very buttery, booze, citrus, toffee, spice, weird. Taste is buttery as well, citrus, bread, yeast, alcohol, some fruit, lot of heat in the finish, slightly unpleasant but drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, hot."
"Cheers."
"The lighter body enhances the drinkability as well as the fact that there is no sign of the alcohol in this beer. I'm serious you'd think this beer was around 4% abv and not 9%. One of the lightest Belgiums I've had, which for me makes it very drinkable."
"Not the best example of the style, I've got to say."
"Taste is sugary, sweet, perhaps too sweet. Taste of tropical fruits with little hops presence. Actually a pretty decent stab at the style, if the sweetness was held in check a little better, this would be a winner."
"D - A little sweet and boozy but very drinkable."
"Got this from SkinnyElvis in SecretSanta 06'. Pours with an almost clear, sunny orange color. Not much head, but a nice white ring sticks around. The carbonation appears somewhat low. The smell is dominated by banana sweetness, with a hint of citrus spice in the background. Am I smelling a Bavarian Hefe? The smell is not real complex, but it's pleasantly sweet. More banana and bready malt in the taste. Some light spiciness with a sweet alcohol finish also. Pretty unremarkable mouthfeel, decent carbonation, but not as much as a strong Belgian could have. This was just a slightly above average beer. It would need alot more depth to stack up there with the finer Tripels..."
"Regardless, being flatish with no head leans twords old age or neglect."
"Drinkability: A fine American replication of a European style."
"DA: Kinda funky for this style, not the best I've seen...and at 9.3% ABV it's not exactly easy to drink."
"Not a bad effort"
"Aftertaste is only slightly sweet with the lemon drying your mouth and asking for another sip."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Maredsous chalice a slightly cloudy pale yellow with barely half an inch of white head. Smells of yeast, spice malt, apple and clove. Tastes of sweet apples and pears with a spiciness that tingles the tongue. Moderately carbonated and finishes with a dry, mild hop bitterness. The high alcohol is nicely disguised. A very good tripel from Dan Weirback & Co."
"Taste is sweet, lots of fruit, banana, pear, spices, yeast and mild hops. medium bodied, and a bit syrupy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Pretty drinkable for a trippel."
"Not super drinkable for me because of an unmasked alcohol note."
"Overall a tasty Tripel."
"Very tastey and enjoyable, though one was just enough for me. I had a pleasant warmth and a slight buzz after one. Great for a cold rainy day."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"No Westmalle tripel but certainly a good one. Since I like the style a lot I'm sure I'll pick it up again."
"Served in a Duvel tulip; golden yellow, slightly hazy with a nice white head. Pretty lacing after the head dissipates. Pleasant fruity aroma. Taste is quite sweet, with nice undertones of yeasty earthiness. Good mouthfeel; not overly carbonated, fairly dry aftertaste. Extremely drinkable; for 9.3% the alcohol is barely noticable. Better than some tripel's from Belgium that I've tasted."
"D: Pretty damn tasty tripel. Smooth and silky with a slightly high abv that's noticeable in a warming of the chest. Very drinkable with a medium body thats that actually a bit lighter than it starts out as."
"Well, this is certainly a nice tripel. This is a very fresh sample, so I look forward to seeing how my remaining bottles age - and I suspect that it will become even better. Fans of this style should definitely give this one a try. I don't remember this beer being so good in the past, and I'm glad I gave it another try."
"Mouthfeel is well-carbonated, and somewhat syrupy. Not sure that I'd enjoy having more than one of these. Drinkability was a bit low as well, the sweetness made this almost more of a soda than a beer."
"Drinkability- Alcohol and acidic notes need to toned down or better hidden. This tripel was too wine-like for me and I've yet to find a wine that I like."
"No flaws or defects. A wonderful beer."
"Pours gold with a nice head which disappears quickly and leaves no lacing. Smell has grape notes- white wine. Alcohol is also present in the nose. Taste is sweet then tart, finishes with a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is medium and nicely carbonated. Light enough to be pretty drinkable. Decent stuff."
"The beer is quite a bit drier than I was expecting. In fact it actually does have a light tartness to it that almost seems like lactic acid. It is not so pronounced that I am sure that it is not just the yeast. Whatever, the tartness actually adds to the complexity and balance of this brew. That same earthy-spiciness that is in the aroma is here in the flavor, but it is actually balanced out quite a bit by the subtle sour notes. Flavors that pop into my head as I contemplate this brew; Notes of lemon, a bit of chalk, some green apple notes, perhaps a touch of celery root (that might be a stretch, but there is something here I am trying to describe), some star fruit, and even a touch of kiwi fruit. The finish has a hint of phenolic notes and hot higher alcohols character that almost serve the same function as hop bitterness. Both of these components are subtle enough to only add to the overall experience. This beer is quite drinkable, and surprisingly dry, I was expecting something much sweeter than this."
"Pretty yellow amber color with tons, and I mean tons, of carbonation. 3/8th inch bubbly white head with flawless retention. Great looker! Aroma is like many Americanized Belgians, banana yeast, candied sugar, and a touch of the tropics. Slight hints of cotton candy to boot. Taste matches aroma with some strong sensations of rum like alcohol sugars. Warming, sweet, and boozy with minimal character or depth."
"D: A delicious version of a Belgian golden ale."
"Overall- the high alcohol is not only not disguised but disguises the flavors in this beer. Tone the Alcohol down and let the flavor shine. Tough 1 to drink!!!"
"This one is a decent beer overall. Definately worth a try."
"Pours a cloudy golden with a quickly-disappearing head. Smells of spice, orange, and a little alcohol. Tastes warm with a slight bite; the orange aroma comes out as the alcohol warms the back of your throat. Aftertaste is pretty sweet, but very drinkable."
"If you like sweet banana smoothies (adult smoothies that is), this is right up your alley and this one really hits you towards the end of the glass. A solid Belgian ""STYLE"" ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Crisp and very sweet. Maybe one or two of these is about all I can handle. No hop bitterness, or any bitterness for that matter."
"Drinkable. Good, and definitely better from the bottle than it was on-tap. Booze is for the most part deceptively well hidden, making this a beer you could settle on for a while. Probably not as light in the body or as complex in the fruits as Belgian representatives of the style, but a solid American rendering nonetheless."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a medium white head and sediment in the beer. The smell is a light citrus,lemon, and wheat aroma. The taste has a tart citrus flavor with wheat, candy sugar ,and fruit, pear?. The m/f is light and crisp, very refreshing. The flavors mix well and the high alcohol content is very well hidden. A very good beer, but the high alcohol does sneak up on you. Be warned. Cheers."
"Still a nice drinker and enjoyable."
"D - like all weyerbacher stuff ive had, this is very drinkable, an impressive american belgian tripel"
"Pretty drinkable...this is a good one , but you must like your tripels sweet."
"Fairly light in body, a lot of carbonation though not too much. Something about Belgian tripel's limits my drinkability of them, however, although it isn't stunningly brilliant, the Merry Monk is a solid take on the style."
"I'm not quite sure how this one fares as a 'Tripel', but it is an enjoyable beer nonetheless and an interesting Belgian style. Cheers, and here's too all of the teams in the World Cup! Enjoy this month."
"A vigorous pour yields a slightly hazy golden body with a nice off-white head. The aroma has notes of candy sugar, yeast, bread dough, fruits (pear, apple, white grape) and some alcohol. The flavor is yeasty, with fruit notes (apple and pear), some candy sugar, and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation and drinkability is descent. An ok tripel, might get better with some age."
"Another decent offering from Weyerbacher."
"Pours deep gold with a hazed clarity and lots of rapidly rising tiny bubbles. Dense soap bubble head of two fingers and decent retention. Scarce and spotty lacing. Mild Belgian phenolic nose of banana and plastic with a weak pale malt aroma. Sweet pale malt flavor with a nice candi sugar alcohol spice. Crisp pilsener and yeast in the aftertaste with a flash of alcohol and mild golding hop bitterness. Tame in every way except the fusel burn. Medium body and carbonation but a fine crispyness allows the big flavor without being too residual sweet. Faint hop bitterness and mild yeast bite in the finish, and the alcohol is perhaps a little more evident than appropriate. This drinks easy, but I wouldn't want more than a bomber."
"Looks like strawberry juice. A bit of head, a hint of lacing. Smells lemony and hoppy. Bready, definitely bready. Tastes a bit alcoholic, a bit yeasty, and fruity- peachy, apricoty, that kind of thing. Strong. Mouthfeel is oily and wet. For a 9% beer- this is damn drinkable. This will knock you on your bum. Not my favorite tripel, but by no means shabby."
"Poured a golden raisin color with a cloudy body leaving a thick white head that disappears but leaves a small lace. The aroma is sweet, yeasty and earthy. The flavor starts fruity on the palate, sweet ripened grapes, banana, mango, and a slight alcohal presence but @ 9% it is very faint. The finish is smooth and coats the throat, very complex and delicious. This is a beer I will go back to again."
"Cheers!"
"The aroma wafting from this semi-golden ale is tart -- green apple? -- with just a hint of funk. If anything, perhaps the aroma is a little on the mild side. The flavors are instantly tart, with fleeting acidity. Malt enters mid-palate and dissolves into a revisiting of this tartness in the finish. This is a pleasing, quality entry."
"This is quite a pleasant beer but it isn't going to make Belgian Tripels jealous. If you love the flavor of banana and I do then you are going to love this. This might not be a world class beer of the style but it is a quite nice drinker. Tasty and fruity this would be fantastic with a dessert featuring fruit and bananas or strawberries in particular. Would also be great with chocolate."
"Overall, a decent representation of the style. Not the best, but this one won't let you down either."
"Served on tap in a pint glass, this is a clear glowing gold with a thin ring of off-white head. Nose is very fruity, citrus and tropical fruits, with a faint whiff of alcohol and a bit of spiciness. Taste starts out with a sweet doughy malt which quickly gives way to very sweet fruitiness, citrus, apple, pineapple. Finish is peppery and somewhat alcoholic, leaving a lingering warmth in the throat. Medium bodied and slightly syrupy, this is definitely a sipping beer. Couldn't drink too many at once, but this is a pretty solid local tripel."
"The sweetness of this ale is just a bit over the top for my likings."
"Light gold color. Cidery, plastic and glue laden nose, with hints of apple and pear. Pretty vibrant, but not exactly nice smelling. Sweet tasting, with an undeniable plastic feel in both the flavor and aroma. Mostly apple and pear flavors, with well hidden alcohol. But, this is a typical American Belgian creation, not that good."
"I really liked this beer and I am convinced to continue trying tripels whenever I have the opportunity. I like Weyerbacher's plain and unassuming label; they clearly want the beer to speak for itself. This label features monks tying one on in the cellar of their monastary by candle-light. I have to say that I can't blame them."
"I've had this one in the cellar for almost a year. Pours a dark golden color. No head at all on this one, but it's not flat, there is a steady stream of bubbles coming from the bottom of the goblet. Smell is very fruity, my first impression was appricot. Other smells that come through are the high alcohol and a candy sweetness. The taste gives you a big blast of sweetness up front. Eventually some yeast spicyness comes through and it finishes with some alcohol burning notes. This is definately a sipper, which fits the style. An OK attempt at the style but i can't whole heartedly recomend this one."
"So refreshing that I can't consider it anything but highly drinkable. That lively and complex flavor and overall refreshing personality will keep me coming back for more."
"The more Weyerbacher I try, the more I don't want to try anything else they make. It's an OK triple, but just misses the key points. I'm not sure if it's the yeast strain or what, but it's sort of like looking at pictures negative. It's sort of a triple in reverse. All the flavors you want to taste are subtle, then the subtle balancing flavors are in the forefront. It's definatly a unique beer, but it basically tastes, imo, like a poor american attempt at a Belgian."
"Everything about this seemed muddled to me. The look, the smell, the taste, the feel... stuff was out of place. This does taste like a logical progression between a dubbel and quadrupel, but/and it tastes unfinished in that way. Malty sweet without some of the tartness or dryness I've gotten out of the better tripels out there."
"Bottle : Poured a shiny yellow color ale with a medium white foamy head with great retention. Aroma is quite sweet but I could not find any trace of yeast. Taste is also very candy-like sweet with a thinner body then expected. Seems like this was filtered and it is a shame because it leaves the beer a bit one-dimensional. So overall, not a bad beer but definitely lacking complexity."
"This one grew on me quickly. This poured a nice hazy orange color with a very small head, nice lacing. There was lots of crap floating around inside.The aroma punches you in the face and at first was not very pleasant(It kinda of smelled like wood stain). But the sweet fruityness saves the day; very nice and aromatic. Medium body here. If I had to make up a word to describe the flavor i would use ""wood-berry"". Because it tastes woody and has some berry flavor. There is even a hint of snapple tea! Nutty also. The flavors are kinda weird at first and I haven't had a tripel quite like this before but it is probably the most drinkable one I have had. Just give it a good amount of sippage and it will grow on you and feel right at home in your mouth. Nice and complex."
"Not bad. Typical Wyerbacher."
"drinkability, I'd say is high, not in the league of Rochefort, or Westy, but nice never the less, worth a go, although this has a high abv, you don't really detect a strong alcohol presence."
"Overall: Glad to see it in the variety pack. Has the ""Weyerbacher"" distinct characteristics. Wouldn't but a whole case of this stuff."
"Poured a lovely golden color with orange hues throughout. My Petrus goblet was filled with foam that sat nicely and left behind plenty of lacing. Aromas of yeast, alcohol, robust spices, and dried fruit. The taste is just great with lingering fruit-derived sweetness that leaves a moderate to dry finish and coats the tongue nicely. Hints of candy and sugar coated dried fruit seem to jump out as the beer warms. Despite the high ABV, this drink was very enjoyable and suprisingly smooth. Aging this beer would give it a more dry finish with a bit more crisp texture."
"This is simply horrible. I dont know, maybe its me and maybe I dont like whatever is going on in this beer, or maybe I got a bad one, but boy is this bad. I bought 2, so I will check out the next and hop for my $4 or so's sake that it too doesnt get poured down the drain like the first one did."
"This is one solid beer from Weyerbacher."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Not much of a head and no lacing to speek of. Smell was fruity. Mouthfeel was like that of a wine cooler. In fact,this beer tastes like a really sweet fruity wine cooler. I did not care for Golden Monkey the first time I tried this tripel style beer, so this is a personal taste issue. Just not my style, but I wanted to give it another shot anyway!"
"wasnt impressed with either pairing."
"($1.99 / 12 oz.)"
"Paired with the right cuisine, or on a hot day with this sufficiently chilled, it would be largely quite drinkable."
"Mouthfeel: A little light. I look for more body on a higher abv brew."
"I think it is a bit unbalanced, and I don't think I'll be drinking this very often, but it fits the style pretty well. The style just isn't my favorite. I think this would be something good to give someone who normally drink alcopops to show her that she can drink something that is still sweet, but doesn't taste like robitussin. It'd be good to have occasionally as a change of pace too."
"This is a damn good tripel. I'm disappointed by the head retention, but for flavor, complexity, and drinkability, this would be tough to beat. Highly recommended."
"Nice head. Initially like a yesty Unibroue, but then Sour and acidic. Not finishable. Too dry, too carbonated. cloves are shocking to palate. Lemongrass does only sour it further. Medicinal.And too much alcohol. How can this be improved? Back to the drawing board."
"Notes: not the best of the style, but pretty good one"
"This stuff is great but the appearance and smell leave something to be desired. Pours a nice dark honey color, great color, but where's the head? I'm asking you, where the F did it go? I see no head. I like some head on my Belgians. Not much carbonation also, but I think that's paritally a good thing. I don't want champagne in my beer. Nose is a little subdued, which is good and bad. It's hiding the 9.3% really well, but it's kinda weak. Minor fruits, a little maltiness, not much there. But, the taste is pretty powerful. Good balance of heavy malts, nice fruitiness (pear, lemon?) and the alcohol is peaking out ever so slightly, but not acridity. Thankfully. Mouthfeel is moderately smooth, but I think it's a little weak for the style. Overall, though, damn man I really do like this beer. Anything that I can down and then be happy for awhile is 2 thumbs up for me."
"Music: Aesop Rock - Zodiaccupuncture"
"This poured a clean golden color with no head, and no lace. The aromas were of bananas, cloves, and a background fishy smell. The taste is definitely belgian sweet with the aformentioned bananas, cloves and a salty malt kind of taste. The mouthfeel is smooth at first, but then leaves a gummy, residue on the tounge. The drinkability of this beer is that one can easily drink this if you can get past some of the odd little flavors it has."
"Noted by other reviews, I would have to agree that this is a boarder line siason. The malt bill is second to the spice/hop/phenol taste. And at 9.5%, I know why the Monks are so Merry."
"Good taste. Peach, hops, and malt. In that orderAlcohol bite was present but nothing like a normal tripel, hidden well. Peppery bites cleaned out nicely after a bit. Although thick with malt and spice this beer finished clean and smooth. I could have this again."
"Drinkability- My ass this is 9% It only feels like about 4% I'm sure it's at least 6%, but I literally felt nothing after drinking this brew. The abv is incredibly well hidden if it's correct. I'm still not buying it. At any rate, it's a great tasting brew nonetheless even though it tastes overall more like a Belgian Pale Ale to me."
"Beauty clear amber gold, almost honey in appearance. 3/4 inch white head, sticky and falls to a 1/4 inch and stayed put. Slightly candi-ish nose with a grainy hint. Taste is heavy on the citrus zest and a not pleasant corny flavor. Bubbles and Belgian yeast attempt to bring it back. The mouthfeel is full at first and then moves on to unpleasantly astringent territory, not helped at all by the extensive zest/citrus peel flavors. It can be drunk fairly easily, but there are more enjoyable tripels available. This was $1.69 for a single at Once Upon a Vine."
"this was something that caught me completely by surprise. in a very good way, from the first sip to the last hand wrung-drop. when the beer hits your tounge, you fist realize that you havent mmade your will, and by the time your half-way through, im wondering if therell br enough time to make love to my wife, this beer is a distraction!!!"
"Notes: Prefer Golden Monkey for an American Tripel."
"Mouthfeel was OK for a beer of this high alcohol content, but not stupendous. Drinkability... only slightly better than average. Not the best tripel I have had... I certainly prefer St. Bernardus Tripel. However, I am eager to try the bottle of Prophecy I have in my basement to see what bourbon cask aging will do to it."
"Poured out a light golden/orange color with a decent size head that setlled down after some time. Smell consisted of spices and tropical fruit. Very sweet and spicy with a whiff of alcohol in the background. Quite a good nose. Taste was good. Starts out spicy with some bubblegum like flavors. Big carbonation moves right into the middle, but in a welcoming way. Floral, still stays sweet with an underlying of spiciness still hanging around. Finishes on the dry side. Not a bad tripel. Not something I would go out of my way to find, but not bad to have once in a while."
"Saying this beer is an excellent tripel does not do it justive. This brightly yellow, fruity refreshing beer has an amazing taste. This is quite a high level of carbonation, however, you will not get much of a head off of this beer. The sweetness is quite intense and feels great on your pallate. The alcohol level gives it that extra kick as if goes down, giving you a fun experience. I would recommend this to anyone sitting around the house on a warm day, especially those who don't have to drive anywhere."
"Served cellar temperature in a tulip glass, poured from a 12 ounce bottle. This beer is crystal clear, golden-orange in color, with a soda-pop head. Poor head stability. Theres a pronounced fruit aroma, with a background of medicinal phenols. Its sweet smelling, with a little alcohol in there as well. The taste is peppery with a little tangy, spiciness. Alcohol warming is notable. The brew is not very malty, and neither is it yeastyId like to see a little more of these traits in the brew. Light in body for the style. Very low carbonation, and just a little slick on the tongue. I could take it or leave itit certainly wasnt inspiring."
"What threw me off, however, and made me not like the bottled version as much as I did the tap, is a slightly medicinal and metalic mild aftertaste that I began to notice more the more I drank. For a beer truly impressed me on tap, the bottled version was a relative disappointment. However, still quite a nice beer, though I wouldn't classify the taste as that of a tripel. This one is far sweeter, less spicy, and a little thicker in the mouthfeel. Overall, well worth trying... but if you have the choice, go for the tap rather than the bottle."
"Drinkability: Fairly easy to drink, but the alcohol would probably catch up with you quickly."
"It's ok, dog."
"A very solid triple, but not quite outstanding. It starts off with a nice straw gold color and a big white cloud when poured into my Delerium glass. Nice smells of fruity-sweet malt with hints of hops. It has a strong complex malt flavor and is slightly under corbonated IMO. It is a good beer and might get better with some aging."
"12 oz. served slightly chilled in a Chimay chalice. Pours a golden-orange that is very clear with lots of carbonation. The head is white, fizzy, 1 finger, and leaves some lacing. Smells of pepper, lemon, grapes, medicine, pineapple? - lots of malts and phenols. It has a medium body with a big alcohol kick. Phenols all over the palate - cloves, medicine, pepper, maybe a bit of banana. It is fairly bitter with tingly carbonation and the alcohol is too noticeable in the taste. Decent... I think it's better with food than by itself."
"This beer is a deep honey color that foamed slightly upon pouring but it faded to a weather pattern thinly covering the top. Light citrus nose is a good indication of the flavor. Taste is fruity, of lemon. Not much of an after tatse. Mouthfeel is thin which suits the crisp flavor. Overall, a decend version of the Belgian style golden ale. I would recommend. Another good beer from Weyerbacher."
"This is nice and good, but it seems to be lacking something (boldness? sharpness of flavors?) that keep if from being great. Having said that I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it, it's worth it."
"Too sweet to be drinkable for me. I may not be able to get through this one."
"Too young! I am now aging my other bottles for a year or more before I revisit this one. The alcohol is a knockout punch, covering up the full expression of the other flavors."
"Decent attempt at a tripel/strong golden ale. Pours golden, slightly murky. Smell is sorta yeasty, spicy, not bad. Taste has waaay too much alcohol up front. Not very well balanced. Still, it has some nice yeasty spicyness and some hints of apples, etc. Not very drinkable due to its unbalanced characteristics. I'm not the biggest fan of Weyerbacher's beers, they all seem to have balance problems."
"split a bottle with fellow BA mtanji. Poured an attractive golden color, with a moderate head. Beautiful nose with nice scents of spices (cloves). The taste was good without being overpowering and got better as it warmed. This was a very drinkable beer and I recommend it"
"Merry Monks' Ale hews pretty closely to the Belgian tripel blueprint and is a more than respectable American version. It's close to being very good and its faults are minor at best. Bottom line: this is good beer. Thanks to blitheringidiot for the bottle."
"overall, a very good example of a belgian tripel. very solid and traditional -- nothing wacky or unexpected, but a well-made beer."
"A great beer to start off a hearty meal."
"Drinkability/notes: A very pleasant beer, and recommended."
"Pouring a copper color into a pint glass, it leaves 1 finger of head that dissipates rather quickly to about nothing, but the ale appears a bit hazy throughout. Aromas are of honey w/ wheat and some brown malts; some alcohol hints and sugars; maybe some plummy characteristics and vanilla as well. Taste is of vanilla sweetness w/ a sharp burst of sugar and even some slight bananas; also some alcohol burn as well on the finish. Feel is decent carbonation on the front of the tongue on the sip w/ a nice smooth swallow; some alcohol on the finish as well. Nice overall, easy to drink and enjoyable...i request another please!"
"Dark bronze-orange appearance, with very little to no head, caused by a bad pour by my bartender. The smell of citrus consumes you. Upon first taste, bananas, pears, and apples are very apparent. After each drink, a hint of cinnamin becomes stronger. The sight, smell, and taste of alcohol is quite obvious. Overall a very drinkable beer. I have also had this on bottle, and i was not dissapointed."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: I wouldn't really want to ever have this again. There are so many good Belgians that this attempt is hardly even noble enough to continue producing. It starts to cloy, and the sharpness of medicinal pepper and phenols with no structure really cause this to be a chore. I'm against drain pours, but this is the least enojyable micro I've had in awhile. Sorry Weyerbacher. I'll stick to the Insanity, and hope this gets revamped in the future."
"I have to say that this beer scores very well across the board, although I have to admit that I have lately become very taken by the Belgian ales. The beer pours a light golden color, crystal clear, with lots of little bubbles that drift up the beer to the top, where a cap of nice white head which leaves pretty much no lace. The smell is heavy on wheats, and lots of rich fruity spiced tones, with a bit of a rubbery smell to it, but not in a bad way. The taste is very full and sweet with tons of malty cherry flavors with a bit of yeast, a touch of hops and a nice burnt dry hint. A bit of alcohol is evident in the taste as well. Lots of carbonation in this beer. It isnt shy about telling you how much alcohol it has definately, but it is still mighty tasty."
"Weyerbacher has been a hit or miss brewery, and while this beer is not terrible, it is definitely not a hit."
"Overall Impression: A good Belgian style ale, but not a Belgian ale. Its just not as rich and full as other offerings from this style. It seems to have some flaws beyond that. Im thinking too much sugar in the brew is thinning it out and making the alcohol a bit hot. Also got a slight cardboard taste, and given this was a trade and it didnt list a date, Im clueless as to the source. All in all, not a bad beer."
"however, based on other reviews, i will continue to seek out weyerbacher brews hoping something will make up for the tragedy that is merry monks."
"Beer is good. Happy Belgian style beering."
"Flavor is light and fruity with some lemon, green apple and general sweetness. Finishes very dry making my mouth long for the next sip to re-moisten my palate. A very clean and refreshing beer, not sure of abv but it is hidden. very nice to drink."
"I like the label. I have to mention that. The label is almost like its laminated. It feels nice and looks nice. I have had Weyerbachers Old Heathen also (which I also like). The image on that label is better though. But who cares besides me."
"Won't be drinking much of this one."
"Drinkability was good consindering I had no idea the ABV was anywhere near this high until typing this, very good job of hiding the high alcohol."
"Merry Monks appears a totally clear dark gold with minimal head that sadly completely fades out after 10 seconds and then looks a bit dull. Expressive yeast on the nose reminds of raw pie crust. Good fruit esters range (melon, banana, mango). Floral and spicy(mint, jasmine) hops somehow manage to leave an impression despite all the other things happening while the aroma is not all that intense. Sweet initial taste, but theres a firm hoppiness developping in a perfumey and herbal way, almost grassy. I dont know why I dont like it more, but the hypothesis is just the huge competition level in this particular style where you need big demarcative aspects (mostly complexity, appearance and balance) to be at the top. This one gives me the impression of a balanced ale with well contained alcohol which makes for a very decent american take on the style despite lousy looks. It was perhaps a tad overexpressive on the yeast though."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a fluffy 1"" white head above the brightly golden brew. Head lasts well, and lacing is good. Aroma is wheaty, with plenty of Belgian-style spicing. Taste is upfront lightly sour, and fills out with wheat and some light spices. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, just not so sure how we hit the style definition, if one cares about such things. Fits the bill tonight."
"First off, what a great picture on the bottle. Those are some merry monks there. Pours a nice hazy orange with a good inch high head. Head goes quickly, dissapating to a white collar that sticks for the whole glass. Nice lacing as well. Smells ridicously sweet, almost too sweet. A spicy alcohol backs the sweetness. Very strong smelling. Tastes great. Medium body and carbonation. Very nutty at first with some herb hints. Sweet on the finish with lots of fruits. Peppers and cloves are present in the aftertaste. Tastes much like a Saviugnon Blanc. With age I'm sure this will taste even better. I set a few back. A very complex beer that will keep you sipping fo a while. Highly recommended!"
"This is an interesting change of pace to the typical pale ales available. For that alone, it's worth seeking out. In a flight of Belgian beers, I don't think this would fair that well, but is a great change of pace."
"It pours a nice cloudy gold. The aroma is a pleasant mix of spice and alcohol with a little bit of yeast and malt in the background. The taste is very full, it has a lot of spice to hit, a little fruit, really no hops, and it has an alcohol bite in the finish, a very nice sourness to it all. The feel is oily and medium bodied. This is quite a drinkable beer, and you could find yourself running through several without taxing yourself."
"Mute, orange and caramel aromatics occur beneath adequately fizzy, orange-colored liquid. On the palate it is a bit wild, dry and aggressive, with metallic, electric orange peel and over-fermented bread flavors. Gassy, with robot-fart metal belches replete with ripped, stripped sugars and hot grease nuances. Thin where it counts, hot where it shouldn't be, this is a careless, industrial ""craft"" beer. Aggressively alcoholic and lacking texture. A shame. Not worthy of the description ""tripel."""
"I noticed that other people were noting the age of theirs. I can't find a single date on mine. Cool lable though. Golden yellow in color with very little head even after an aggresive pour. The smell is great. Spicy and sweet with some floral notes. Very little carbonation at all. The cap did fizz when I popped it but not effervesant at all in the mouth. The taste is sweet and actually some sour notes. I do like it but it isn't like most other triples I have had. The monk says, ""Shhhh, be quiet!"""
"With my negligible experience with tripels, I'd say this is pretty good, with real sweetness and complex fruityness that make it a nice, relaxing sipping beer."
"D&N: I haven't had all that many Abbey Tripels, but this one seems a nice ambassador for the style, and being brewed here in my home Commonwealth only helps things. Nicely done, and I can't wait to get some more to lay down in my cellar."
"Almost like apple cider at times, but still a very nice Belgian style effort from a solid, northeastern American brewery."
"In my opinion, this isn't very good and I'm only impressed with the smell...."
"Overall: This is a great take on a Belgian abbey tripel - probably one of the better American Belgians I've had. This is a very complex beer. The beer seemed a bit too fresh, however, and would probably be even better if it was cellared for a year or so, giving it time to mellow out a bit."
"The beer pours a cloudy golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very sweet pale malt scent along with a nice, fruity Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is good. It is well balanced and full of fruity yeast and pale malt flavor. It has a bit of tartness to it, but otherwise it's pretty damn good. It has tremendous mouthfeel. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good trippel. It has good flavor, a good abv., and excellent mouthfeel. It is a good drinker."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a hazy golden yellow, with a decent size head that slowly receded, leaving lots of lacing behind. Aroma is malty and sweet, like ripe fruit. You get a bit of alcohol in the nose. Taste is slightly malty almost wheat like. With some tartness in the middle. Lots of carbonation. There is a slight hop bite in the finish. I wish I had access to this on a regular basis. Very tasty!"
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy medium orange color with one finger of head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty and friuty, with pear and apple. A little bit of alcohol and tannin in there as well. The taste is both spicy and fruity, high on the malty side. There's some grape in there, and a hint of clove. A touch of alcohol and hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy. The drinkability fairs very well for a 9.3% brew. Not too shabby."
"Pours with a three-finger white head that fades quickly and leaves a good lace. Cloudy, golden amber color. Good carbonation. Nose is hoppy; Starts with a good balance of malts and hops, finishes crisp and clean with some hoppy aftertaste. $2.10 for a 12oz bottle."
"Pours a light yellow straw color in the glass. A one finger head develops that is very airy and foamy - not dense at all. Smell is of yeast and sweet in smell, maybe oranges? There is a slight sour taste to beer. It doesn't have the lingering sweet aftertaste I like in Tripels. A very light and wispy taste to this tripel. It is very drinkable as a result. Still there not much taste. A slight alcohol bite if you let it linger in on the tongue for a while. The mouthfeel of the beer is very wimpy considering ABV of this beer. It tastes and feels like a watered down tripel."
"sorry to do this, but this one went bad. So I guess this is a public service announcement on this brew. No head was achieved, it is cloudy in color. And the taste can only be described as sour!...so watch out for this one, try to find a fresh bottle, may be hard to do as this doesnt come with any type of freshness dating."
"Poured a cloudy honey color with a thick white head of foam that settles down to a thin layer. Yeast is prominent in the aroma along with clove and a slight citrus. Creamy mouthfeel that is very effervescent and crisp which is true to the style. Alcohol is well hidden in this ale which is always a good thing. Flavor is very wheat malt like. Almost a cross between a Wit and a Tripel. Pleasant none the less. Overall a really well made Tripel and one I'd drink again if given the chance. Thanks Jason!"
"This beer looked ultra light, hazy and pale yellow. The head was a thin and creamy layer of foam. The aroma gives off orange juice, lemons and limes, hard candy and is overall sweet and syrupy. The taste is very flavorful, and gives hints of lemon meringue pie. The alcohol is there, but is masked well. This is a deceiving beer - The beers appearance and texture seem much lighter than they truly are, then after one sip, you are drawn into entire drink. Very drinkable and one of my favorites from Weyerbacher."
"Beef Notes: Horrible. What was the thought process when putting this beer out for sale?"
"Big brownish yellow beer with a short light colored head. This beer pours in smooth and almost immediately hits the nose with smells of fruit and hops. The taste is warm (alcohol) and brings with it a fruity, sugary kind of flavor to accompany its barley flavor. Finish is similar to white grapes. This was a great beer."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but I know the whole time I'm drinking a 9%+ beer. I would'nt want many of these."
"Surprisingly easy to drink, considering the high abv. A nice yellow color with decent lacing. Smell was fruity, somewhat like grapefruit. Taste was initially fruity with a nice tart finish. Surprisingly, the alcohol presence was not overwhelming. Mouth feel was medium bodied, and the overall drinkability was good, especially considering the high abv."
"A pretty authentic tripel style. Nicely balanced, with an interesting interplay of sugary sweetness and sour flavors. I'll certainly get it again, although a six pack lasts me a long time. I'm not often in the mood for belgian style beer. These guys make a good product, of which this is not the least."
"hazy golden peach with a descent sized bubbly white head that retreats to nothing. minimal amounts of lacing. grassy, horse blanket, musty belgian yeast on the noze. full cabonation lends a refreshing zest to the body. spicy alcohol flavor, full of yeast and notes of cloves and similar spices. not too bad. smooths out some as it warms to room temperature. not a bad stab at the style, middle of the road when judged in the context of it's peers. worth a shot."
"Beer lacks vitality and carbonation for style. Not unpleasant just as lively as I would like to see. Finish is also abrupt and doesn't leave any lingering tastes."
"681"
"Slight marshmello banana smell. Smaller white head that after the pour leaves the goblet. Golden slightly cloudy pale look. Initial tropical flavors of pineapple and then the beer spices with some touches of white pepper and coriander. The ABV is quite covered as well. The mouth is very lively with lots of little tiny bubbles surrounding the tongue. Considering the ABV it has good drinkability."
"The feel is crisp and clean with a nice finish. Limited drinkability because of the ABV."
"Not sure it really complies with the style, but it's darn good. If you like belgian clones you won't be sorry."
"The flavor is tart and sweet with a bit of spice and some maltiness. This beer has a chest-warming quality as it slides down the throat. It leaves a very pleasant, serene aftertaste that encourages to have another sip."
"Let me tell you. At 9.3% abv this is one drinkable brew. Amazing for an American tripel to be this good without the overspice. Weyerbacher has proved they're a quality brewery with this amazing style."
"I found this Americanized Belgian triple to be quite enjoyable. There was enough going on with each taste to make it interesting and keep me coming back for more. I would have never guessed its alcohol content at 9.3% ABV. A pretty tasty brew from Weyerbacher."
"Weyerbacher brews good beer, although I can't say this one is among the best of its crop."
"Pours a hazy orange, with a small white head that completely lasts, and laces extremely nicely. Aroma of sugar and spice, yeasty, and slightly fruity. Flavor is sweet, some honey, some spicey - very enjoyable mix of flavors. Fairly full-bodied, ends quite dry, alcohol barely pokes it's head through towards the end."
"This doesn't seem complex enough to be called a Belgian golden ale. Sorry, but it's just not worthy. It's a shame, because I thought that they did a great job on their wit."
"It's fruity, fun, and high ABV, and the alcohol hit me about 3/4 way through my first glass. It's pleasurable to drink, fitting for the style, and you know, I didhave a second. But futher samplings will wait for another day."
"This is a fairly representative beer made by a really good local brewery. I like most of their beers. This one pours a nice golden color with a little haziness that's nice. It has an off-white head that is not real long lasting with little lacing. The aroma is a spicey, citrus fruitiness. The main taste is a grainy base with a citrusy top with some other elements of fruit and spices. It is a complex taste. It has a hoppy kick that comes a little bit afterwards. This is a little thin feeling in the mouth. It is a fairly drinkable beer that is not heavy so a couple go down really easily."
"Part of the ""Big Beer"" variety pack I picked up today,pours a medium golden color with alot of carbonation a nice frothy white head comes from the pour.The aroma is a little spicey and smokey,a nice spicey lightly sweet flavor to this beer pretty authentic here a powdered sugar flavor lingers with the spicieness the overwhelming flavor that I get.Just a tad on the thin side but still a really nice brew from Weyerbacher."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a thin head. A complex combination of fruit, citrus, malt, and yeast were very prevelent in the smell. The taste covered the spectrum, with strong citrus and sour tones balanced with some thick sweet malt. Very smooth on the tongue after a quick tingling sensation as the liquid enters the mouth. The sourness makes this score less than good on the drinkable scale."
"Thanks to jcalbi for this bottle."
"Hazy golden yellow color with a small whitish head that dimished quickly to a thin ring and fast dripping lace, nothing sticking really. Smell has a good yeasty aroma, somewhat spiced and thick with sweet malts, citrusy lemon thats dulled down with some clove and band-aid plastic-like notes and a hint of alcohol. Taste is quite good with dulled lemon and candish malts with a soft front, creamy feel and medium body thats pretty hefty in the middle with a yeasty fresh grab which adds some spiced zest and drying notions late. The finish has some interesting complexity with the drying with grassy notes, raw melon husk, lemon peels; a cottony fluff coats the inside cheeks and tongue in a later aspect well after each sip. This was extremely close to getting 4.5 in smell and taste, I want to give it those numbers but something makes me want more from it so a solid 4 it is. The alcohol is extremely well hidden, it hit my head about 3/5 of the glass as it is a very drinkable triple and I just kept drinking it...gone now, would like more, but alas, only one was available and I must thank Pabobcat for it!"
"This is the former Weyerbacher Tripel (just a label change). It pours a hazy golden body that appears orange-ish in the goblet and displays plumes of fast-rising, standard-sized bubbles eminating from its base. Its creamy white head drops in size but maintains a short lid, although its lacing is quite limited. The nose is sweetly malty, yeasty, and phenolic. The body is medium; and it's gently zesty in the mouth before warming to become somewhat creamy. The flavor follows the lead of the nose with varying, occasional notes of light rock candy, bubblegum, honey, vanilla, licorice and some plastic/glue-like phenolics that lend character. It finishes dry with a short note of candyish malt that's quickly washed over with a slap of drying alcohol. A decent tripel that's quite varied and nice."
"Drinkability: I hereby commit the heresy of saying this is better than Allagash's Tripel Reserve. A very lovely beer priced at a bargain rate $2.50 a bottle. I think there'll be a little monastery in my cellar shortly. So long as they keep it down during Matins, I'll be happy."
"This is not a favorite of mine, and I totally dig the abbey beers. It had a nice look to it, with the rich creamy yellow color and the nice little head. The smell was very complex. It had elements of citrus, alcohol, and other things. The taste was similar, except for the overbearing taste of an old musty house with moth balls. I couldn;t finish it, due to the old person taste. It was very rich as well. Not one I'll have again. Oh well, you win some, you lose some."
"Merry Monks seemed to be a typical delicious Belgian Tripel at first glance. Indeed, it is quite good, but after finishing the glass was not quite what I expected. An extremely appetizing beer, it pours a cloudy golden color with a dense white head that retains very well. Great aroma of spices and and lemon. Mouthfeel is rather spritzy and carbonated, as expected. At first this beer shows a nice blend of hops and citrus elements, with a touch of alcohol. It is rather well hidden considering the ABV of over 9%. However, I expected a big spicy kick near the end, which never came. Instead it finished dry with a candy-like sweetness. This wasn't a terrible thing, but not what I expected, and I would have preferred the warming alcohol/spice finish. That's the knock on drinkability. Still a very tasty beer that's worth checking out."
"Thanks to francisweizen for this one"
"Appears as a drop of sunshine gold with a glowing orange haze to it in contrast to a white short lasting layer of foam. Aroma contains Belgian spices, sweet malt tones with maybe a touch of candied sugar, and quite a pleasant citrus tone to the nose. Flavor is sweet and full not lacking in any major areas just a great representation of the style especially to come out of Easton, PA. Taste contains and blends all flavors so nicely with spices, citrus tones, sweet fullness that stands up to most competition. Mouthfeel is a bit undercarbonated for the style but the nice syrup texture adds to the greatness of this brew, very nice texture. Drinkability besides the alcohol this one is a very good tripel not outstanding but very very good, bravo."
"I will question scoring it as a triple. The others I have had, both on site and in tastings, have been far more attention getting. I really think this is more of a double. Triples, as all baseball fans know, are rare."

"This beer poured a clear gold color that was decently carbonated. For this style I would have thought it would have been cloudy or some haze to it. It produced a foamy white head that sat on top of the glass. It lasted fairly well then dropped to a thin film on top of the liquid. It left behind a decent lace on the sides. The aromas that came from the glass were of fruit (apples, oranges), spices (cloves), bananas, sugar, hops, light malt and yeast, and alcohol. Spicy and fruit comes to mind on the nose. The tastes were fairly similar to the nose, flavors of sweet fruit (oranges), fresh picked hops, cloves, peppercorns, bananas, sugar, malts, some yeast, and alcohol (but not over powering). It left a slight alcohol and a dry spice taste on the tongue. Medium bodied. Fairly clean and decently complex in flavor. Not a bad example of the style, but it seemed to be missing something. But drinkable."
"This wasn't a terrible Tripel, but it wasn't quite the sweetness that I find I prefer in a quality tripel (such as Allagash). A nice effort, however, and I look forward to seeing if they can improve in the future."
"Turbid light amber. Initially thick head settles into a thin, soapy layer that leaves spotty foam trails. Banana esters are prominent in aroma. Mellow bready, musty sweetness and mild green apple. Hint of solventy fusels with a deep inhalation. Very tame aromawise, but relatively clean. Honeyish sweetness upfront in flavor morphs into ripe, lingering banana sweetness. Faint, herbal clove and grassy hop emerges mid palate. Mild hop bitterness leaves residual sweetness mostly unhindered, but tapered enough to prevent it from becoming cloying. Becomes lightly cidery, and candi sugar driven late. Lowly carbonated for style. Sufficient dextrins for a pleasantly soft mouthfeel. Finishes mostly clean, with fleeting hints of clove studded sugar sprinkled bread. A very mellow, somewhat understated Belgian strong golden. A bit shy on yeast derived contrast to malt and/or sugar sweetness. Overly clean, but certainly soft on the palate and highly drinkable overall. Tasty, but not outstanding."
"I could go for another of these but this was my only one. Thanks to beerluvr for the trade."
"Pours a clear, bright golden/copper color with a nice whitish head that sinks down to a thin film with a nice ringing lace. Sweet candy sugar, spicy pepper, orange zest, and other light fruits are present in the aroma. Hudely sweet malt and candy right off the get go on the taste. Peppery alcohol and general fruity flavors with a bit of orange. Slightly medicinal flavors linger on the tongue and are the only thing that detracts from this brews flavor. Extremely smooth with a nice zesty quality that seems to make it dance on my tongue. A very nice brew that I would gladly drink again."
"This beer poured a golden color and formed smooth white head that left a solid layer of lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. An aroma of hops, banana, citrus and spices. A flavor of hops, spices like coriander and caramel. It had a medium body finish and a touch astrigent. Not a bad belgian style."
"12oz bottle: A bit of a golden hue, with a little cloudiness. Some hints of bread, banana and clove in the nose. Tastes are very similar to the aroma. The taste is pretty much in line with other tripels. A good brew, but just a little lacking in comparison to other Belgian or domestic tripels. Allagash or Golden Monkey are much better. Duvel is still the king!"
"This is a Belgian Triple not a Pale Ale. Beware the 9.3% ABV very smooth and bubble gummy and exceptionally drinkable.The alcohol creeps up on you as the beer gets closer to the end, though you never really taste that alcoholic presence. Made with care and always and excellent beer from Weyerbacher."
"Let's see what cellaring a few bottles will do to it in a few month's time."
"This beer poured to a nice golden color with little to no head. Aroma consisted of a lot of different spices and fruits. Nice balance of hops and malt. A full body beer and pretty good example of this style. Nice dry finish. Not overly carbonated which may account for the lack of head."
"This is a pretty good beer. The nose and taste is fruity. There is a high alcohol content but that doesn't overpower the beer by any means. There is so much taste that you would never guess it comes in at 9.3%abv. The mouthfeel is kind of syrupy with only a little carbonation. There aren't many subtle changes as you move through the beer. The alcohol peeps its head in at the finish."
"Beautiful, rich, golden beer. Too bad there was no head. That would have made it an amazing sight. It smelled unexpectedly tart, elements of green apple, malt, and slightly cirtusy hops in the nose. This beer was mildly tart and a bit biscuity. The biscuit flavor increased substantially as the beer warmed. The malt was held in absolute perfect check by the restrained bitterness and acidity. At 9.3% ABV there was no foul alcohol taste, only it's warming presence. The viscosity was ideal for this beer, and the carbonation was from bottle contitioning and as a result it was light and perfect. Weyerbacher has a real treasure in this beer."
"Pours a murky orangeish-yellow color, portly and frothy white head, tonnes of lace. Nose is citrus, malts and a bit floral. Front is sweet, malty, the top is moderate in mouthfeel, the finish is, tart, pleasant hop presence, benignly acidic, with a droughty aftertaste. Just a downright good Triple, not a great , just quite drinkable."
"Pours a deep orange gold color, with a white head that dies quickly and leaves a thin lace around the glass. On the nose I can smell spices, fruits, hops. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. On the palate the flavors consist of spices but sweet at the same time, orange peels, red apple, noticeable fruit character, alcohol makes itself know. Overall this was another very enjoyable brew from Weyerbacher."
"A high-quality trippel.  Weyerbacher is a gem for Pennsylvanians, who can get this beer for about a buck a bottle.  This trippel is brewed just right, with a good balance of hops and sweetness."
"Intensely fruity triple with the alcohol punch balancing the sweet maltiness. Not as complex as the best Belgian's but good none the less."
"Notes: Certainly a treat to try another brewery’s triple, remarkably complex perhaps too complex if that is possible. It seems like most of the flavours are fighting for dominance and no one prevails. If this one was to be laid down for several more months it would have been a bit more melded. A great brew but a little too fresh."
