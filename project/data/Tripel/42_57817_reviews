"On tap, at The Blue Monkey"
"Tasty tripel, but alcohol was a little upfront for my tastes. Not surprising at 9 %, and considering I was drinking at 50 F when recommended serve is 40 F."

"O: Great tripel from one of my favorites - Ommegang"

"A decent beer, but fairly pedestrian, compared to a fin du monde, for example."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 11/12/2014. Pours slightly cloudy deep golden color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale/bready malt flavors; with an awesome crisp malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly prickly/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible spiced tripel style. All around outstanding balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. An insanely delicious offering."

"Overall: A very good version of a Belgian Tripel. Good mix of spices and fruit esters with a nice level of carbonation."
"It's a nice decent brew, but has a weird aroma and doesn't quite hit the echelon for me.  Coriander doesn't always jump on my palate, and the licorice isn't really noticeable if perhaps in some nice slick mouthfeel, but this is still a very decent tripel worth having."
"The beer pours a deep gold. Very large fluffy head that is spewing with aromatics the entire time it was developing. Scents of bubblegum and lemon with a strong malt backbone come out heavily in the head. The taste has notes of bubblegum as well. Strong malt and a very good spice package that is hard to identify but notes are similar to cardamom. There is also a perceived sweetness in the beer although I doubt the level of residual sugar is actually very high. Exceptional yeast notes as well. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall a very well made beer."
"A little light tasting for a tripel, major fruit notes especially orange and corriander, smooth mouth feel and smooth finish"
"A seriously spicy and hot golden ale. A bold and golden mouthful. From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego."

"06/10/12 From the bottle a tad sweet but very flavorful. Not too much of anything. Needs a re-val as It's been a long day."

"Overall - It drinks really easy for its ABV, so be careful. I polished off the whole bomber without problems. All in all, It's a good baseline representation of the Tripel style. It tastes great but is otherwise not unique. If that's your jam, you will like this one. But if sweet, spicy Belgian ales are not your thing, this one won't convince you otherwise. There are beers I'd buy over this one, but I'd never turn this one down if offered. I definitely recommend giving it a try."

"I picked this up in an Omegang 3-pack at Costco around Christmas. Thick 750 ML corked Belgian bottle poured into Omegang glass that came with the 3-pack (what a deal!). Its a slightly hazy orange-hued golden ale with faily high carbonation and thus a substantial and long-lasting head. Typical Belgian aroma that conceals the spices really well. Very nice honey and spice, and very well balanced. The spice is muted in the taste until the beer begins to warm up, then the spice becomes apparent but never overwhelms. Excellent mouthfeel. Overall a super enjoyable tripel."
"Overall, a very enjoyable and flavorful tripel."

"Remarks: Delicious. Bought in a big bottle 3 pack with Ommegang glass for under $10 at Sam's Club. What a deal!"

"Good tripel worth repeating, two or three more times.."
"This is a really good traditional tripel that does nothing wrong. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A fantastic take on the classic Tripel style from a favorite brewer of mine. The shift up in price for Ommegang means I'm not buying as much, but I'm glad I picked up the holiday 3 pack for a price I'm used to."

"O: This is a good beer, ranks in the upper middle of the pack as far as American tripels go. It definitely goes in the like column, and will come home again."
""
""
"Overall- Awesome triple, I don't know about perfection, but very nice and worth a try."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if youâ€™re in the mood for the style."
"Lots of rushing carbonation runs through the sunlight golden color of the beer. Topping it is a fluffy head which retains extremely well. With a smell, I get the notes of white pepper, pear, apricot, vague cream, which altogether is a delicate and pleasing nose. The taste doesn't let down either, proving to be somewhat spicy with grass, orange, apricot skins, while overall delicate in taste. It pairs well with the airy, bubbly mouthfeel, and gives me the impression that this was brewed in Belgium, not mid-state New York. Tripel Perfection may be a stretch as a name, even though this is outstanding....perhaps Tripel Outstanding instead?"
"Pours out a little muddy amber in color (as In not quite clear) with a huge 3 finger, white head with decent retention and a bit of lacing. Smell is that typical Belgian yeast with bananas and cloves. A nice little sweet smell from the malt really makes the nose nice. Taste is everything in the nose and a little TINY bit boozy but this may be a little warm (not 40F - probably 50F). Really has a nice crisp flavor and feel as swallowed. Mouthfeel is really pretty thick which I like for the style due to all the carbonation. Overall another really nice beer from Ommegang. Most of them of wonderful."
"The taste is elegant and reserved. It is smooth and creamy but has plenty of bubbles to tickle your tongue and enliven the palate to all the flavors. It drinks like a charm. A bit thin and not too sweet with a touch of dryness and a bit of tartness from the fruit. The grain is light in the body of the beer as it warms and adds a supple quality to the drink. There is a touch of alcohol that enhances the fruit sweetness. The aftertaste is long and dry and this has a mild spice and pepper finish that is simply wonderful."

"Spicy now, and some unexpected breadiness, but mostly spice and nectary fruits. Banana, pear, and apricot with a false coriander note. A little peppery. Nectary body, too, with a burning carbonation feel. Has a little stickiness. I still get some butteriness, but it evolves into pomme flavors. Not bad tripel from one of my favorite breweries."

"Flavor is great. A nice fruity background, enough pepper to keep it interesting and a heavy dose of Belgian yeast.  Most of the great Tripels I have tried have almost a ""cheese like"" flavor because of the yeast.  This one qualifies.  Alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is impressive. Almost no alcohol presence, nice and rich with good spicing.  I would rank this Tripel with the very best I have tried."

"Overall, this is a very good experience. I would recommend it, but I just found out that it was a limited edition. It is a very good Tripel."

"O: Excellent tripel. Very deceptively light and crisp despite the heavy ABV. The taste elements are well balanced and go together well."

"aroma is light bready notes and hints of banana, cloves, pears, light tart apples and a touch of spice on the edges. clean, very clean flavor that it is very hard to find really any fault here in that. super clean with light body and a nice medium palate with hints of grain and light fruits that seem to dance all over the place. light bears and nice touches of fruit and light spice. smooth, clean finish"
""
""
""
""
"Crisp mouthfeel with good carbonation, clean, slightly puckering finish. Sharply defined flavors and liveliness on the tongue made this an excellent pairing with spicy Indian food. A very good example of the style, but falls on the sweeter side of the spectrum."

"This one poured out with a really nice looking yellow gold color. There was a nice hazy to it and a fluffy white head on top as well. The lacing was a little sticky on this one which was pretty nice. The smell of the beer was full of yeasty aromas and some soft spices in the mix. The taste of the beer was was a little tart upfront which caught me off guard, after it warmed it got better. The spices cae out a little more and the sweetness of the grains did too. The mouthfeel of this beer was very drinkable, soft and refreshing. Overall I thought this was a really nice Tripel."
"Nice, clear golden color with a nice pure white head on top. Head could be much fuller when compared to some tripels I have head. Very yeasty, bready and earthy aroma wise. Clean and malty flavor, very crisp and clean. Candy like sweetness-leaves a stickiness on the lips. No hint of the spices that it says it has on the label. Very full bodied mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable. Not overly complex as fas as tripels go-damn enjoyable for sure."
"O-A decent beer but it did seem more like the Ommegang BPA. I don't believe I've had a tripel before but it seemed much lighter than their Dubbel and Quad though."
"O: Mediocre Ommegang offering, but a good beer. It doesn't taste at all like a tripel. Much closer to a BSPA in my opinion, but that doesn't affect the quality of the beer. Drinkable and rather recommended, but I would've liked less sweetness and more spice."
"Very nice tripel, that gets better as the session goes on. The alcohol bite mellows and the fruit and spice comes more forward. Not quite as good as Allagash's tripel, but it's almost there."
"O - Solid, not particularly memorable, but something you can enjoy drinking if you like the style."
"Pours a clear yellowish orange, with lots of carbonation and a nice head that sticks around for some time. Smells of bananas, figs, apricots, apples, this is some big time fruity stuff. Along with all the fruit are some delicate hop scents and the familiar Belgian style yeast strain. Banana yet again on the tongue followed by a earthy malts, hops and yeast. Spice is very abundant and a slight alcohol presence . Great in the mouth, light, crisp, refreshing. This is some fine stuff, will try this sucker again fo sho."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with mild carbonation and a medium body that has ever essence from the bubbles racing up the brew; the overall feel is light, with a tart bitter finish that showcases the yeast and malt. Good drinkability, this goes down easy and mixed very well with spicy food. A very complicated and enjoyable beer that seemed balanced in every way."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are very nicely balanced and fit together very well. Especially the yeast characteristics which feel like they are at just the right level compared to the other flavors."
"Poured into a tulip, hazy orange/gold-ish with a big foamy white head which eventually dissipated. A lot of citrus in the aroma, with some spice. yeast and booze. Taste has a lot of malt, yeast and banana sweetness up front. Get a pleasant funky spiciness as it goes down. Medium/heavy mouthfeel with some carbonation. Not quite ""perfection," but a good tripel for sure."
"D- 4 I really enjoyed the TP and would be happy to take down the big bomber. It is a bit pricey, but hell, it was a one-time brew! I may see if I can get another before it will surely be bought up... Overall, it is tasty, well-balanced and not heavy. A good brew for sure - what I've come to expect from Ommegang."
"Poured from the large bottle into my Duvel tulip. Cloudy bright amber color and fluffy head. I called this La Fin Jr. Looked nice. Fruity, pleasant aroma. Taste was also reminiscent of La Fin. Mouthfeel was medium and overall I thought it was a good basic Triple. Nice job Ommegang."
"This did not break into my top 10 Tripel list, but I would still have this one again."
"Notes: Nice tripel, but nothing special or anything to really distinguish it from others in the style. I enjoyed it, and it is a solid beer but is a little blah overall."
"Overall another great beer from Ommegang."
"Overall a nice Tripel in the Ommegang Belgium tradition."
"The mouthfeel is what is to be expected, bubbly and smooth. Easy to drink. Pretty good beer."
"O/D: quite drinkable for the ABV, yet seems to be lacking in triple flavor in my opinion"
"Added note: Had this recently on draft and immediately thought to myself that this has a different flavor than I remember. I am getting much more clove spice to it and it reminds me more of a winter ale. Still has a very bready flavor to it, though the spice comes through more than any sweetness or fruitiness I tasted previously. Still, a very solid beer, but curious as to why it seems different than I recall."
"D/M: Very crisp and clean flavor. Not overpowering considering the weight of the alcohol content. Delicious and drinkable."
"D - It's a very convincing take on the style, but nothing mind-blowing. Alcohol is pretty well-hidden. Would have this again if offered."
"D- A good beer to have with dinner, but I wouldn't have more than 1."
"Overall, one of the better tripels I've had... though I haven't had all that many. Ommegang continues to prove itself to be a bit underrated in my eyes. This is a very solid beer and while it might not be perfect, its pretty close. I would heartily recommend this one. Cheers!"
"I probably wouldn't purchase this again in the future but something tells me that as my palate refines I will appreciate it more in a few years. This may be a revisit down the road and worthy of a re-review."
"Wow, I like this. Sucks it says Limited Edition on the bottle. I want more."
"An excellent Tripel. One of the better American made versions I have had. Highly recommended."
"But the brewery might want to share their secret with their fellow brewing compatriots, who, by and large, tend to make a mess of this style. In my experience, U.S. variations are more often off than on, and only a small handful have succeeded in crafting anything on par with the Belgian masters. Ommegang, however, undoubtedly deserves mention in the same breath as Westmalle and Karmeliet, which, indeed, makes its close to perfect."
"Impressive nose with lot of yeast and sweetness, apricot, pitted fruit, pear. More yeast on tasting, pear, more pitted fruit like peach, red plum. I found the spice toned down in this one compared to the Adoration and there is a nice interplay between what spice there is and the yeasty backbone bringing forth a multitude of complex yet delicious flavours. This is certainly an excellent Tripel and if it were more readily available would always find a spot in my beer cellar."
"Tripel Perfection, while far from perfect, is delicious beer that is well worth the purchase price for Belgianophiles (like me). This is one time in which my long-held belief that Brewery Ommegang is a poor man's Allagash doesn't necessarily hold true."
"This is a very good tripel and is very tasty. The 8.9% ABV limits consumption."
"D - so easy to drink and the alcohol is not as noticeable as expected. A great sipper."
"Taste: incessant blitz of hops, spice, citrus zest, and fierce carbonation. Bam, zam, lovely, lovely, lovely. This has all a triple wants and need, and more. Nothing more to say, it has it all...pale malt, abundant yeast, zesty citrus and spice, the whole deal. Genius. Thoroughly amazing. Yum and yum. Every inch the very verisimilitude of a top-notch triple."
"The mouthfeel had a zippy medium body. Prickly. Seems more like a Belgian Strong Pale Ale more than a Tripel. It is very tasty whatever you label it."
"D - Overall this is a pretty light and drinkable beer, while still quite complex."
"This is a highly drinkable beer. It's tasty, it's full-bodied, and it's crisp. That hit of alcohol in the nose could use some taming, but this is definitely one I'm glad to try."
"D: Very drinkable, goes down smooth. Nice feel and wonderfully done beer."
"Orange and spice in the finish."
"D - Good flavour and sugar balance. Easy drinking for such a big beer."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Smells very strongly of coriander. This one tastes very bitter and has a very potent taste of coriander which has a tendency to overpower most of the other flavors in this brew. This is probably my least favorite of beer from Ommegang."
"Mouth: Great mouthfeel, creamy, sparkling feel. Finishes with a mint/anise hop finish. Lingering alcohol heat with a touch of bitterness. An enjoyable beer for sure."
"D: Rather drinkable and very enjoyable."
"D-good, but nice as a night cap...."
"Mouth feel is nice and heavy with great drinkability. This is a top tier tripel."
"Pours a clear gold w/ orange tint with a one-finger head that has good staying power and leaves lace patches. A musty, sour and tart fruit smell with some spices and clove as well and a touch of sugary goodness. Real smooth and creamy with a light body that contains both a sweet fruit and malt taste as well as a sharp, citric twang. Besides the banana and orange from the citric notes, I get some fruit flavors bordering on tropical lke apricot and some pear and apple as well. Some sweet caramel and candi-sugar malts provide sweetness and there's a it of bready/dry malt as well for balance. Light on complexity but a real easy to drink and enjoyable belgian ale."
"D: A stronger ale that leaves a big footprint. The sweet fruit and spicy yeast are a winning combo."
"A balanced taste with malts and spiciness but also some sweetness."
"D- easy to drink but easily one you can sip on, enjoyable and with ommegang's prices i will more than likely purchase this one again"
"Reviewed on 5/15/2010. Bottle. Pours a cloudy light orange with a thick white head. Aroma of spices, bready malt, light fruits. Flavor is full of spices in the front and finish with a solid bready malt, yeasty base. Very drinkable, certainly spice-heavy, but a pretty tasty tripel overall."
"The aroma of this beer is quite heavenly; though the flavor doesn't quite live up to this beginning this is still a really nice example of a Tripel. I really like how this achieves the texture and lightness that a really good example of a Tripel should. As the beer warms up it gets closer to having a flavor more reminiscent of the aroma (with lots of citrus and floral notes), but it still has that almost harsh, phenolic finish."
"O: A sipper for sure."
"I guess I would call this a classic tripel, which is to say good, and traditional, but not spectacular. Or unique. This is a great example of what one should expect a regular tripel to be, but whose lack of innovation leads to ratings that lead to mediocrity. Mediocrity in this instance means a good beer, but I much prefer Victory's golden monkey for it's awesome taste that doesn't necessarily conform to what one expects in a tripel."
"D: An OK beer and a decent example of the style."
"Smooth, silky mouthfeel even with the high carbonation. Unfortunately for me this is a very drinkable 9% beer that I will be feeling tomorrow."
"D: bought this in a gift pack with a three phils, BPA and a glass. It was a good buy and I will be purchasing again but since its limited release I'll be looking real hard."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D- This is a great Tripel overall. Not quite ""perfection"" but just as good if not better than a lot of traditional examples of the style-which this represents nicely. This should be called Fantastic Tripel instead (lol)- another great brew from one of my favorite breweries. I'm surprised that this Belgian-style brewery does not have a regular release tripel."
"Good stuff."
"D: A very nicely hidden ABV, making this a nice all around drinking beer and not just a sipper. Classic taste of a Tripel, although nothing jumping out in to unknown waters."
"Good taste and carbonation make this very drinkable."
"D: The beer is definitely a sipper given its alcohol content but the alcohol is well masked."
"Westchester Homebrewers Organization (The WHO)"
"Perfection may be an overstatement, but not by much. Poured a glowing orange/gold. Lively and a bit prickley in the mouth, as a tripel should be, with a touch of black pepper. Crisp malt with a bit of orchard fruit toward the end. Alcohol was a touch warm, but not overbearing. Nicely done."
"Pours a one finger tight white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is spicy fruit. Flavor is sweet flowers and malts. Higher ABV is hidden. $9.69 for a caged & corked 750ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D - Not a bad tripel and hides abv very well. Would definitely recommend it."
" D- This beer has a crisp delicate flavor and a smooth quality to it. The alcohol is very well hidden and the hint of hops is nice come though at the finish. It doesn't have the perfume qualities that I like in a tripel but it is very easy to drink."
"D: Medium high."
"This is nicely done. I'll pick it up again if I see it."
"Drinkability - This is very smooth, dare I say a bit too smooth. It should be slower to drink due to the robust carbonation typical of the style. The flavors though are incredibly rich and rewarding."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, dry yeast and candy sugar. In the taste, a nice yeast presence and a candy sugar balance. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry yeastiness and a small fruitiness in the aftertaste. Nice representation of style."
"Smooth and tasty drinking all around. Those that like their tripels to be more juicy ought to adore this one."
"Poured from a caged and corked 750ml into my La Fin du Monde chalice, brilliant orange golden slightly hazed huge effervescent layer of white head. Fine Belgian style lacing, between sips you just have to admire the beauty this beer has to offer. Aroma ful of tropical fruit/bananas, mangoes, and hints of pineapple. Bold spicy yeast with pale malt breadiness, and herbal hops in the background. Flavors explode with ripened banana, citrus fruit, hints of pineapple juicy fruit. Spicy yeast/hops provided nice balance to the fruit laiden sweetness. creamy finish with a touch of booze in the background. Muthfeel has welcoming warmth with the booze but a smooth juicy effervescently carbonated body. Incredibly smooth and drinkable as it warms the booze becomes much more apparent but the flavor is just as enticing."
"Pours a somewhat murky gold with little head even after the piping cork. Smells slightly floral and fruity. Some eaters, but many more in the taste. Flavor brings caramelized bananas and a great amount of fruit. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Good example of the style, but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Ommegang Brewery Tripel Perfection--Golden Tripel Ale Brewed With Spices--Limited Edition--Cellared at the Brewery--Cork Capped--2010 25.4 oz. Bottle. 8.90% ABV. 10 IBU's? (4.25 / 5.0) Belgian Ale--Tripel Thin lace fizzy white head. Cloudy bright yellow gold color. Rich sediment. Floral banana wheat ester coriander hint front. Rich sweet creamy smooth Belgian Tripel banana wheat complex rich tasty body. Clean refreshing mild Belgian spice fruit end. Big balanced Belgian. Sampled 9/11/2010. $11.49 Each @ Ballard Market 7/1/2010."
"A superb ale from Ommegang and I will be looking for several of these to cellar. I like much."
"The beer starts with a soft sweetness, lightly creamy texture that gives and early impression of weight or dextrin. But the beer's carbonation carry the beer from the early sweetness into a lightly acidic and zesty spiciness, lifting the beer off the tongue and seemingly evaporates into thin air. Delicious and effortless to drink in the end due to alcohol warmth and good attenuation."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is crisp with a pleasing dry finish. The alcohol is a bit on the hot side but not in a terribad way. This was a very well made beer but I expect nothing less from Ommegang."
"D: A well made, drinkable beer."
"Ommegang Tripel Perfection is a great beer, but not the most accessible tripel. Is it perfection, as the label claims? Sadly, no. But despite being slightly more dry and tart than many Belgians, Tripel Perfection remains one of the best Belgian beers crafted in the States."
"Drinkability: This is yet another good beer from Ommegang and yet another faithful interpretation of a classic Belgian style. Not the best tripel out there, but this one is still very satisfying for the Belgian beer lover and average beer geek alike. Given the price compared to actual Belgian tripels, this one is definitely a winner."
"T- Wheaty taste at first, sour after taste. Some maltiness. Alcohol undertones. It's quality, but kind of generic at the same time. Not worth the price tag, but good if offered."
"Tasted from 750mL bottle. Pours golden with a decent white head. Nose of wheat, candy malt, lemon, orange, and a slightly honeyed aroma. Palate is honey, orange, lemon, and a light sweetness. The body is medium with lively carbonation and a medium citrus finish."
"Served in a tulip, the beer pours a thick white head that lingers over a cloudy orange/amber color. Sweet candy, yeasty aroma. Taste is fantastic; malt, sweet, spice, with a little bit of a dry finish. Drinks quite easily without much of an alcoholic burn. Another outstanding offering from the guys in Cooperstown. I'd put in on par from some of the best of what Unibroue or the Belgians have to offer."
"D: Much more drinkable than the 8.9% abv suggests, perhaps this one goes down too easy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing)."
"Ommegang does its thing once again with an excellent Belgian ale. Up there with the best American-brewed Tripels."
"Highly recommended"
"D - Better from the tap/growler than the bottle for sure. I remember being somewhat under impressed with the bottled version, but from the growler...pretty great! Looking forward to BCTC at the end of July!"
"D= Though the alcohol doesn't hide with this one, it remains highly drinkable. A quality tripel that walks the line between sweeter American interpretations and the traditionally drier Belgian versions."
"D- A ""perfect""ly drinkable triple"
"D: Easily drinkable despite the abv. Surprising balance."
"O: Another consistent selection from a go-to brewery. I'm still waiting for something that blows me off my feet, and I'm sure I'll get my wish eventually."
"The nose is very yeast, with esters and phenols abounding. Light honey, banana, and some spices: cardamom, coriander, pepper. Flavor is initially fairly malty and sweet, but the spicing dries it out nicely. Many elements of the wheat beer-like drinkability are retained, but the added complexity and spiciness of the tripel are here as well. Nice American adaptation of this venerable style."
"Drinkability: A decent not outstanding tripel. I do appreciate the astringency and the funk in this beer. The taste is good, but I have had better from the brewery. For the price, it is worth a try once, but I cannot see myself getting this again."
"Reviewed from my notes. It is an opaque orange beer, with a white foam head made of small bubbles. I can make out plenty of rising carbonation at the edges of the glass. The aroma is very nice, with plenty of candi sugar, musty Belgian yeast and a little bit of dried apricot. I wrote that the flavor is interesting. Candi and crystal sugar sweetness are present. The finish is peppery. It tastes a little dry and powdery. It isn't as clean tasting as some other triples. It is full bodied and possesses slightly above average levels of carbonation. It foams up a bit as I swallow. It leaves behind a good coat that helps maintain the peppery flavor. It is pretty drinkable, but has more pepper than I excepted. One big draft pour is enough for me, although I could finish a 750ml bottle if that was what I had. It is an enjoyable beer, but I don't think I would seek it out."
"750mL corked and caged bottle pours a nice hazy pale orange with a nice frothy off-white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves nice rings of lacing on the glass with each sip. Aroma is a very nice plethora of spices in front of sweet malts. The taste is sweet malts with great spice flavor right alongside leaving you ready for the next sip. The beer is medium bodied but the alcohol is well hidden by the smooth carbonation. This is an absolutely amazing Tripel, dare I say one of the best brewed in American and likely the only one alongside Pisgah Solstice that I would put up against the best ones brewed in Belgium."
"D: The overall drinkability and delivery is one that was exceptionally smooth and polished, a tribute to their fine tuning and perfection seeking regiment that made holding out for this beer worthy of its name. There is hardly any indication to its 8.9%abv nature, making you want to continue drinking this beer long after. Perfection? About as close as you could possible ask for."
"Notes: Probably will improve with time, but doesn't rock my socks."
"Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy golden orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, corinander, slight bananna. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, yeasty, nice touch of corinander/bananna. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, not too hot in the spice area."
"This beer poured a clear gold color and formed a huge foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided much like a float. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, citrus and yeasts. The flavor was of malt, yeasts, pepper and touch of butter. The body was medium style and slightly creamy. The finish had a slight peppery yet tart finish. Not a bad beer."
"Thanks go out to jonesy77 for tipping me off to this guy's presence in the District! It pours a hazy sunshine straw with a finger of white bubbly head. The nose comprises wheat, some grass, bready yeast, clove, and a faintish banana, much lighter than I would have initially figured. The taste brings this apparently mostly theoretical banana element into true focus, joined by cloves, pepper, cardamom, and that always fun and super-vague term, ""spice"". Since I've never encountered All-Spice in the real world (beer world is nicer, but heavy on the escapism...kinda like taco land...), I can't use it here, but I still kinda wanna replace ""spice"" with ""all-spice"". Maybe not. Regardless, the body is on the lighter side of medium, with a lightly active carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall a solid tripel, not unexpected from the Belgian-leaning peeps up at Ommegang."
"Pretty ballsy of Ommegang to throw the word perfection in to this new release. The look of the beer starts things off on a good note; hazed golden in color, with just a bit more than a lacing for head. Tropical fruit in the nose, yeast must in places, and a dry medicinal presence. More of the same from the taste, coming off in a very bright, more pronounced way, if that makes sense. Lively mouthfeel, with plenty of carbonation to assist in drinkability. The ABV is hidden well, but can be felt after the first few sips. Alright, so this might not be an absolutely perfect Tripel, but it comes pretty close as far as I am concerned. Definitely one of the best I have had in recent memory. You also have to give Ommegang some credit, as it sounds like they have been working on this brew for some time. I guess their determination has paid off, as this is an awesome Tripel, and beer overall. Cheers"
"D-this is very tasty, great flavors and nice complexity, light hopping with great wheat body and nice spicy flavors. awesome golden fruits, very tasty."
"Aroma is light, sweet and clean mostly belgian yeast. Flavor is creamy, again with belgian yeast. Banana and a mild spiciness are also present. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel seems a bit thick for a tripel. Overall I like it a lot."
"Notes: Brewery Ommegang hits a home run with an authentically prepared Belgian Tripel, my favorite style. You know, Ommegang is best when it sticks to the best beer styles in the world, the Belgian styles. Lastly, I think that this is a steal at under $9!"
"Flavor is better than the aroma thankfully. Pretty spicy and nicely balanced. Doesn't finish dry and the beer is mostly sweet in the front with only minimal bitterness in the back. I'd have it again."
"Tap, City Beer Store. Pours a burnt orange-gold with a nice sticky white head. Good lacing. The aroma has good hops, yeast and spice. Hops are citric, floral and a bit tropical, the yeast has a very pleasant earthy phenolic tone, and the spicing brings some nice pepper and coriander. Malt contributes touches of sugary sweetness and a bit of fresh dough. The beer is dry, effervescent and drinkable. Some hop oiliness. More malt presence in the flavor. Quite refreshing. One of my favorites from Ommegang so far."
"D - very impressive. great fruity flavors yet doesnt hide an excellent grain profile. not ""perfection"" but a damn good attempt."
"Another winner from Ommegang."
"I am always up to try beers from ommegang! Like the others this one does not dissapoint. Pours a clear golden with white head foams a ton at first but then mellows but does not completly dissapate. On the nose you get nice sweet malts with slight citrus hints. The palate is both light but full with bready flavors with a touch of banana and spice. It does have a lot of heat in the finish which is odd since it is only 8.9 ABV. But overall it is a great american take on a traditional belgium style."
"Overall a tasty tripel but not perfection. It's lacking in balance and overly carbonated for me."
"Not an overly complex tripel, but exceedingly spicy as you move through the bottle which hurts my overall enjoyment. I think this is a good take on the style and one I would seek out again, I just feel that it lacks the depth and structure of the elite within the style."
"This is a great bottle worthy of any fancier of the Tripel style."
"On-tap at Cole's. Ommegang has been producing regular new Belgian beers these days,and consistently enjoyable. I enjoyed this one, yeasty, tasty, creamy mouthfeel. A meal in itself.Suitably carbonated, understated and balanced spices. Nice effort, decent representation of the style."
"	Pours the color of golden raisins, with a fluffy one-inch white head. Substantial lacing on the glass as it slowly recedes. The aroma is packed with citrus fruits, coriander, pepper, banana, and a whiff of yeast reminiscent of fresh baked bread, with some light mustiness and herbal hops. The flavor follows through on everything in the nose. Sweet malts complemented by bursts of spice and citrus. Earthy, tangy waves of yeast. The back palate lingers, drying out gradually with the help of some floral, slightly bitter hops. This is all delivered with vibrant, prickly carbonation."
"Good example, not complete perfection, but highly enjoyable."
"The taste is clean triple taste, not to sharp and just dry enough. Fruity, more apricot and white / green grape flavors roll over the tongue. Light hop bitterness cleans things up nicely. Little spicy on the finish, end of your palate. I also detect a little apple, green apple. As this beer warms I detect some diacytal but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The beer feels like it looks in the glass, slick and smooth over the tongue. For a beer of the style its pretty drinkable, but triples always wear on my palate after a while."
"D: Good stuff; I'm glad I tried this one. It's interesting when American breweries try, and succeed in mimicking Belgian ales, or any imported ale for that matter. If I didn't know this was an American interpretation of the style, I'd think I was drinking a very expensive import. Kudos, Ommegang."
"Drinkability: While not the most complicated tripel I've had this one seemed to me to be a good well made beer, as we would expect from Ommegang. While its not at the top of my list of favorites I liked it well enough that I'll give it a try again sometime"
"Brewed on March 15, 2010 (3 months ago)"
"A decent enough effort from Ommegang, even if it's not wowing me."
"Another great Belgian from Ommegang. Follows thru on all the great qualities of the style. Nice golden orange color and puffy white head. Aromas of spice, cloves and bananas. Taste echoes the aroma. Flavors fill the mouth with cloves, candied fruit and Belgian Funk. Booze is VERY well hidden. This is a very drinkible Tripel. One of the better ones around."
"A marvelous tripel. I am proud it is made here in New York, though it easily could be mistaken for a fine Belgian product."

"Pouring a beautiful, clear, light orange with a dense, white head with decent retention, this is a great looking tripel. The nose - not so great. For a beer this fresh, it smells surprisingly muted and dull. The spice character is noticeable, with some coriander and bitter orange peel, but neither of these has the brightness and delicacy I expect from a good tripel. It is also surprisingly hot for something under 9%. There's some light honey and bread character to the nose as well. Similar on the palate on the nose, this really tastes disappointingly stale. Some clove, pepper, coriander and orange peel are all noticeable, but there's a stale bread flavor that I just can't get behind. Drying and a little hot on the finish, this beer is light in body with moderate carbonation. I wonder what the deal is with this beer, if this was an off first batch, or if this is actually what they were going for."
"Tripel perfection isn't bad, but it's a little hot and heavy for me. It's worth a try for fans of Ommegang."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, with (nice move omme) Packaged on and best before dating printed on the neck of the bottle. Pours cloudy medium apricot, lifts a Belgian appropriate near huge head, that stays and stays, going slowly to moderate frothy merainge, thick sheeting and lace. Fruity and pleasant nose of honey, flowers, pineapple, and light pepper. Easy drinking brew, the near 9% well hidden, typical Tripel flavors and sensations, light pepper, some lime, mango, more pineapple, Belgian yeasty goodness. Creamy and smooth in the mouth. Well done and welcome to a new addition to the Ommegang family of fine brews"
"drinkability: good"
"D - This is very drinkable for the percent as well as the awesome flavor and mouthfeel. In the end it's a tripel with a flawless nose but a beer that's off from perfection. Still, it's a good tripel that tastes like its straight from Belgium."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with an average white head that settles into a sparse cap. Looks a touch light and the head retention was less than your average Belgian tripel. The aroma is of light yeasty phenols, some banana, and candi sugar. Again not as deep in aroma as other tripels but no off aromas either. Nice sweet flavor, floral honey, very light coriander with some yeasty phenols, clove and banana. Light to moderate feel with very fizzy carbonation, quite burpy. No detectable hop bitterness. This is a very easy drinking tripel, no cloying sweetness or heavy handed coriander. It is lacking a certain depth but is well made."
"This stuff is GREAT! It is probably really good aged in bottle conditioning. I'm looking forwared to trying it! Definitely at the top of my list on tripels."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet pale malt scent along with a solid yeast character and light alcohol warmth. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth pale malt flavor with loads of yeast esters and a bit of dry earthiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very brewed tripel. Ommegang is branching out and I couldn't be happier."
"D: A good beer that is a little off style. I will be the first to say this is a damn near impossible style to nail down. I enjoyed this beer but they need to tweak it a little bit more."
"Drinkability: depsite the big alcohol levels, this went down smoothly. I could have had a few of these, but slow sipping is key here. Enjoy this one if you can find it."
"The grassy hops and the citrus up front definitely lend a beautiful, almost saison-like refreshingness to this one. Really well done."
"Rumor has this being bottled as a regular in 2009 finally filling the Tripel void in their wonderful repetoire."
