Great balance and very well crafted.  It's dangerous because it's 9% ABV but you don't feel the alcohol, so be careful!  But do make sure you try this if you find it anywhere, because it's well worth it.","dcscientist","Feb 02, 2015"

Very effervescent maintaining a 1/4 inch head throughout.  Kind of a sour bready aroma.  Taste was a bit more sour than I expected and lingered on the tongue.  Nice round mouthfeel and well-hidden alcohol.  It is a well-crafted beer but I don't understand this as the highest rated Tripel.","KidDoc","Dec 13, 2014"

4.72,9.3,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 3/28/2017. Pours lightly hazy deep golden color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, apricot, pineapple, orange peel, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, apricot, pineapple, orange zest, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon. pear, apple, apricot, pineapple, orange zest, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Insane complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt flavors; with a pretty much perfect yeast/spice/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly/dry mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a world class tripel style. All around insane complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. An absolutely amazing offering.","superspak","Oct 31, 2014"

Aroma is of sweet spicy fruit, Belgian yeast, some notes of citrus and banana, some biscuit malt as well. Taste is same as aroma with a good spiced hops bitterness. A medium body, with lively carbonation, almost champagne like. The finish is a combination of sweet spiced fruit, Belgian yeast, biscuit malt with spicy hops bitterness on the end for balance. This brew has some nice champagne like effervescence. Overall a very good, delightful, and tasty brew. very nice.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

Unique malt, yeast, and candi taste that was one of the most drinkable Tripels I have had. Maybe similar to St. Bernardus but it's been a while sinc I have had that.  But at $8.50 a bottle a lot cheaper than many others with comparable excellent taste level.","Drogon","Aug 21, 2014"

Personally, I think this beer doesn't rival Unibrue's Blanche De Chambly. The taste is very fruity and it has a high alcohol content. This is one of my least favorite beers, and I don't recommend it.","Metalbrew","Jul 27, 2014"

Flavour is sweet and almost syrupy, with a slightly bitter edge, reminiscent of orange marmalade or peach syrup. Bready notes and lots of Belgian yeast in the flavour too, classic Unibroue taste. A bit of caramel and apple as it warms. Dry, sweet, bready finish. A great Tripel.","ljthiesse","Apr 28, 2014"

Of course there are pieces of cork in my beer because it broke apart, trying to get it out. Not good. Smell of bananas and cloves with slight hint of citrus. The taste is very similar to the smell, but there is little to no carbonation and very slight hop bitterness. That is hard to discern as well. Very sweet taste. I really wanted to like this beer, but it is not really my cup of tea.","jngrizzaffi","Apr 06, 2014"

The taste was great with a hint of banana to it. Loved the feel of the beer as it seemed to just be a perfect balance.

4.72,9.3,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Haven't had this in years and was surprised by how much I loved it. Its a light orangey, yellow straw color with an incredibly soft white head and a little lacing. The smell is all stone fruits at first, Belgian yeast spiciness (white pepper, clove), banana, a little honey, vanilla and citrus peel. The taste follows the smell starting with strong peach and stone fruit notes, some candied pineapple, sweet honey, banana, and the spice profile grew as the beer warmed. A little bit of classic bubblegum flavor started to come out a bit too alongside of the clove. No traces of the booze. The clove was unique in that you would taste it and then feel all over the mouth like the way in which you feel clove. Really smooth with high level of carbonation. Could of drank this all night. Again, I had sort of considered this a gateway beer and hadn't thought of it much in a while but I was so pleasantly surprised with this one - really wonderful still.","jwchestnut","Mar 16, 2014"

The aroma is of lemon and orange citrus, white pepper, faint straw/hay, and grass. Quite the emphasis on the citrus. The taste begins with similar citrus, but almost immediately gives way to a rush of funk and clove. There is some white pepper, straw, grass, and another appearance of lemon zest on the finish. Great belgian yeast flavor throughout. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, and refreshing, but does have a bit of a sticky, resinous finish. Overall, this is a very well done and traditional tripel that is very drinkable. The alcohol is completely hidden behind a nice, complementary bouquet of refreshing flavors.","eclipse54","Mar 14, 2014"

There is so much carbonation rising for the first couple minutes that it looks like an underwater volcano. Nice persistent lacing. The aroma is lemon, a bit nutty, and a bit too yeasty for my tastes. The flavor is rich, grain and mild hops, nutty, yeasty, and a bit herbal--like Ricola cough drops. Mouth feel is thick and creamy. This is a style of ale that I am not familiar with. I see so many if you rating this ale very high, and saying it is a perfect example of a tripel. I think my rating is influenced by my limited experience with and understanding of this style. Certainly very good, to most everyone else, outstanding.","Dsimenson","Mar 09, 2014"

It's crisp enough to be refreshing in the summertime, but it also has enough warmth to be appropriate in colder months as well.

Here's to a year of gaining weight, drinking more and being less productive. La Fin Du Monde pours a dull, effervescent copper orange with fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Opaque body, not a whole lot of lace. Sweet and spicy on the nose, with notes of coriander, oranges, bready yeast and assorted citrus. One previous reviewer likened the scent to "salt sea air and steel." Sure, why not? Spices and citrus carry through to the palate in a big way. It's a complex profile that's hard to tease apart, with sweetness and spice and everything malty. Something about the moutfeel has always felt a bit off to me. Heresy, I know. My expectations for the style don't mesh well with the heaviness and aggressively carbonation. It goes down tasty but I'd be lying if I said it goes down smooth.","xabyss","Jan 02, 2014"

4.35,0.7,4,4,4.25,4.5,5,"Overall it is a flavorful beer that is heavy and hits you hard with the ABV, but the taste, ABV burn and general composition are spot on for a Triple and this beer nails it. It is intense and has heat, but in a good way that reminds you of why you would drink a beer like this – because it is everything an Adjunct Lager is not: it’s complex, meant for sipping and each sip is different as the beer/yeast morph from exposure to air, temperature changes and fermentation. This is craft beer Monk style and not an attempt to mass produce a dull consistent flavor; this beer sits in the bottle and turns into an experience, and once again for me this brew was a great experience. A high recommendation, his is a great beer.","CHickman","Nov 05, 2013"

4.34,0.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"One of the first craft brews I enjoyed. Cloudy yellow in color with a two-finger white head that quickly disappears. It smells like banana and dried chili peppers. There's not a whole lot of funky yeast on the nose, as in more typical trippels. The taste is sweet with banana and maybe a little bit of mango flavor. There's also a spicy clove flavor and a low level of barnyard funk, but these flavors are rather low-key and it's much sweeter than your traditional dry Belgian trippel. There's huge carbonation in this beer and it has a medium body. Scarily easy to drink at 9%. It may not fit the style exactly but it is very good.","itsscience","Oct 28, 2013"
4.46,3.2,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - Delicious, well crafted tripel that may be my favorite I've had in the style. Complex enough in that it is fun to identify all the different flavors and features of the beer, but at the end of the day the most enjoyment from this beer is still generated by actually just drinking it. Should I ever be stranded on a desert island with only one beer until the end of time in an "end of the World" scenario, La Fin Du Monde is certainly one I could live with and enjoy.","DenisKolkin","Oct 28, 2013"

Warming aroma of caramelized malts with a Belgian yeast backbone and their cloves and spices. The flavour is well balanced, with malt and yeast depth from start to finish. Banana notes transition into caramel before a warming bitterness. The 9% ABV is scarily well hidden!","hopsolutely","Oct 27, 2013"

The aroma is potent yeasty esters, apple pomace, doughy malts, a little citrus, candi sugar, and aromatic alcohols that hint at what's ahead. This is a boozy, spicy blast of a tripel, with apple and pear, sweet doughnut malt, orange, musky grapes, and black pepper all vying for your attention, with a more subtle backdrop of dark dried fruits and unripe green stone fruits lurking amidst the pungent alcohol. Fizzy. Smooth dry finish but some residual yeasty sweetness lingers for up to an hour post-indulgence. One of the world's finest and easy to find on the prairies. Hard to knock this masterpiece, maybe the alcohol is a tad forward but its a tripel after all.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 15, 2013"

Nose of significant spice blend first, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and coriander in the mix. Bready notes, with some hints of citrus fruit, as well, but the spice dominates nicely. Flavors of banana bread forward, with another heavy dose of spicing that keeps the sweetness in check. More coriander and nutmeg, with some clove highlights in there, too. The body is smooth, with an effervesced feel that provides a crispness in combination with the spice profile. Bready sweet aftertaste supports the retaining spice blend, which also makes the transition into the finishing linger, with a clean, smooth feel. Solid representation of the style....very solid!","GarthDanielson","Aug 24, 2013"

With the number of different types of beer and personal taste preference it'll take way more practice to truly identify the best of each bunch. Besides, what lies between "outstanding" and "perfect"? Regardless, this beer was incredibly good. I'm realitively new to the Tripel and got LFDM because of the high ratings on BA. That said, the flavours of this beer were very distinct, well balanced and downright tasty. There were so many different taste regions affected on my palate that I had a very tough time identifying the medley of flavours. The malts were not in anyway overpowering as one might think of a Tripel and a 22oz. bomber at 9% disappeared rather quickly. I'd venture to say that this is one beer deserves a place on every beer rack and should be brought our to impress the advocates in your circle.","1stOffender","Jul 06, 2013"

The smell is fruity with spice notes mainly clove or coriander. The taste is amazing. It has a very nice fruity taste with a slight bitterness and hints of clove which for me the clove seemed to lesson after a few sips. It has just the right amount of carbonation and has a bubbly pleasant mouth feel. What else can I say this is a world class beer. I would drink again in a heartbeat.

I don't know if I got my hands on a bad bottle, I wouldn't say it's undrinkable, I did finish the bottle, but it was way too boozy for my taste. The alcohol taste and aftertaste just overshadow everything that could be great about this beer. I understand that it's a tripel, and supposed to be alcoholic, but this is a little above and beyond to me.","guitarob","Jun 22, 2013"

On the nose is plenty of yeast, sweet malt, sugary lemon and tangerine. On the palate it’s buttery smooth, spritzy carbonation and a little thin. It reminds you of a hefe with a little banana but it’s too sticky and the alcohol warms you and gives it away that this is a tripel. Short sweet finish, no hops on the palate at all. Understated and bewitching. This is a very well turned out tripel that would meet the end of the world with an attitude of aplomb.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

4.27,-1.2,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and good example of the style, it had pretty much all the flavors and aromas that I look for in the style and it was pretty dry, might be the driest Tripel I have had and I thought it worked well with this beer. This beer had great drinkability, it was pretty smooth, the alcohol was hidden well, it was pretty crisp and refreshing, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, this may be the most drinkable Tripel I have had so far, I would have no problem drinking a whole bottle and I don't think I would rule out having a couple glasses of this on a warm summer day. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style and balanced it was, it's just what I want in a Tripel. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I didn't like or would change about this beer, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again, and I would for sure like to try a fresher bottle, it's priced pretty fairly for what you get and I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style and I think it would be a nice beer to introduce someone to Belgian beers. All in all I enjoyed this beer, I think it's one of the best Tripel's that isn't made in Belgium, it's very hard to compete with the Belgians when it comes to this style, but this beer can hold it's own. Good job guys, I really need to get around to trying more Unibroue beers, I haven't had a bad one yet. So far this my favorite beer from them and Unibroue is my favorite Canadian brewing company.","StoutHunter","Jun 05, 2013"

Has characteristics of all the great trappists, if I had this blind I would guess it was from Belgium and brewed by monks. This was a steal at Trader Joes, for the price it is the best beer you can buy.

This brew was on sale at kroger at 7.99, so I got one to drink and one to age. The one I drank opened with apricot and yeast. The fruitiness covers the 9 abv, but can still taste the booziness. This is one to age, in my opinion. For the here and now, it just doesn't seem ready to drink right off the shelf. not ready yet. Just tastes like a young barleywine, sorta. Of course, I will finish this bottle, but I look forward to tasting the one that I will age for at least one year.","mfanch8578","May 15, 2013"

It poured a thin white head, with color like a ray of sunshine through the clouds at Diamond Head. Tightly carbonated with lingering head. Hay, black currant, and crisp alcohol notes dominate the initial impressions. Lingering flavors of balsa wood sans spice. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy but robust with aftertaste to spare. Overall, it stands out above most other Tripel's and enjoys an easy drinkability.","CharlesRamsey","May 15, 2013"

As others have mentioned, it is the taste that is the highlight of this beer, though no other aspect is really a slouch. While the alcohol is noticeable, the beer still drinks less than its posted alcohol content, and could definitely sneak up on the drinker if he or she is not careful. Here’s to hoping the rest of my journey into Unibroue is as great as this one was. 17/20","THANAT0PSIS","May 02, 2013"

Head retention is good with decent lacing. it smells of yeast and fruit. Apples, grapes, peaches, and I think it smells a bit like coconut as well. It's like a huge fruit bowl condensed into one 12 oz bottle. The taste it a bit sour and the fruit flavors transfer over well from the aroma. I don't detect much hops, and there is hardly any bitterness. It's medium bodied on the palate. The carbonation is very high, but it works with the tart flavors to produce a surprisingly refreshing feeling. Try it if you haven't already.","silverking","Feb 12, 2013"

Beautiful looking pale gold, very hazy. Head so white it might be neon, lingers then recedes to tiny bubbles. Slightly tart taste, pear maybe. Has a bit of clove spiciness too.

The welcoming committee comes out for this one. They say yes, you thought Sierra Nevada Pale Ale was the end-all of beer. But now you've had the best! No longer can you settle for Shock Top.

The aroma consisted of pale malt, peach juice and yeast. Medium bodied,a base of sweet malted grain, spicy white pepper, apple and pear juice followed by floral hops, and alcohol. Smooth mouthfeel and dry finish makes this the most outstanding Belgian beers I have sampled. Everything from Unibroue Brewery has been outstanding-","GossageBrewery","Jan 28, 2013"

For best flavor, use a Duvel-like chalice and pour at an angle slowly until about one inch of head is achieved. Then pour rest of beer into glass after about a minute or so. It has a very distinct bitter-sweet taste, although once you have acquired a taste for La Fin, it goes down very smoothly. One of my favorites, although a 4-pack where I live goes for around $11, and the bars usually charge $8-10.","jaws1477","Jan 09, 2013"
4.47,3.5,5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,""It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feeeel fine," wrote one particular band of New Foundland origin. I can totally agree with that statement and if the world's ending, grab a bottle of this bigtime Belgian. These Unibroue folks are giving Belgians a run for their money and they have absolutely perfected all styles. I cannot find fault in this beer, but it's not for the faint-of-heart. It pours big and frothy, with the hint of sweetness you would expect from the Belgian yeast. I poured it into a snifter, like you should, and I let it relax and warm for a few minutes before inhaling. It warmed me right up and gave me the feeling like that if the world did end there and then, this beer was taking me into a world of its own! I would say that this is a beer for someone who's open-minded. Someone who likes to sit and sip a beer or two while those around him/her down pint after pint. A beer for old souls who know that if the world ends, they lived a pretty damn good life and they let out a big, cheerful "Salut!" in jest.","zachloveshisbeer","Jan 09, 2013"

Light+ bodied, then the carbonation goes a little over the top, finishes drying with clove and a little lingering sweetness. I haven't had one of these for 4 or 5 years.

4.17,-3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours an ugly piss yellow with hints of orange and with a very soapy head on it that fizzles away slowly, and sits over the beer as the color of soap bubbles. The beer’s body is cloudy like piss, but allows a fair amount of light through. On the nose, this beer smells of soy sauce and banana phenol notes with some very slight bubblegum hints. Fruity soy sauce is really what comes to mind when you smell it, though not in an entirely bad way. On the tongue, the beer tastes of creamy banana, soy, and some nice clove-like spice. The beer really begins with light soy notes that grow in fruitiness until they hit banana flavors, and all the while the spicy clove also builds on the sides of the flavor, and leaves the aftertaste to ring lightly of spice and slight banana. The middle of the taste is really where this beer shines, with big spicy cream banana notes that are quite pleasant on the taste buds. On the mouth, this beer feels quite fierce with carbonation, though the beer below it sits with a nice medium body that sticks to the tongue, and leaves the mouth clean, but with sticky saliva along the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is a nice tripel-style ale with some great phenolic notes, and some nice spicy complexity. A fitting beer to end the world with, I suppose, though it isn’t my favorite in the style. Still, this beer is worthy of a try.","Maxwell","Dec 21, 2012"

VERY smooth, flavorful, yet robust with a well-hidden 9% kick that you feel in your head rather than your tongue. The label of the bottle is amazing, and the title is French for "The End of the World." For me, personally, this is the end-all-be-all of great beer. I also love the sound of the cork popping.

Initial taste shows how high the carbonation is in this tripel. Lots of yeast, bubblegum, citrus, cloves, and tropical fruit. Very smooth and creamy rather than watery and acidic. Alcohol is perfectly hidden. Refreshing, not too light, and awesome! One of the first beers I ever fell in love with.","tarheels86","Nov 20, 2012"

Beautiful light gold bubbly ale with a petry dish foam and a semi-clear consistency. Smells of green apple, clove, banana, pear, wheat, hops, and honey. Taste similarly follows with the green apple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. The only flaw of this is how the flavor dies off a bit as the brew begins to warm (uncharacteristic of a stronger brew), and it has a bit too much excess gas. Other than that, this is an outstanding brew that is easily one of my all-time favorites. Enjoy!","shigg85","Sep 19, 2012"

While this is definitely a world class beer, and one of the best tripels period, this didn't totally blow me away, and it wasn't really miles apart from similar offerings from Unibroue. I would consider Blonde de Chambly, La Gaillarde, and Eau Benite to be, in ways, quite comparable to La Fin Du Monde.

3.88,-10.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a light copper with a one finger head with carbonation bubbles rising steadily. Leaves decent lacing. The smell is of wheat, citrus, and perhaps a little bit of grapefruit. Tastes very much like a wheat ale, Although very pleasant without the lemon dish soap aftertaste. Some mild citrus, very faint hops, And light malt. The mouthfeel keeps the same flavors although it greatly opens ip the wheat. the citrus also comes through a bit more. Overall, It reminded me of a very good wheat ale. Would I buy it again? Yes, although I am not a huge fan of any beer with wheat flavor. But this one was good.","SometimesIfart","Aug 01, 2012"

However it is no Pabst!! You'll notice it stinks; spicy is a good start but the banana and fruit really clobber you after that. Once drinking is commenced the Fin du Monde tastes like a perfectly spiced Indian dessert- cardamom and clove flavors are present. The carbonation is just about spot on. For my first ever restaurant-beer and a blind choice by me with no prior knowledge of Unibroue or La Fin other than a love of the trippel style, I'd rate this a 6/5.","gradestarr","Jul 28, 2012"

A nice cap of lacing is left on top and there is some lacing left on the side of the glass. The aroma is of fruit and yeast. It reminds me of a Hefeweizen, only the smell is a little more potent. The flavors of fruit and malt really come through in this brew, but it is not too sweet. The alcohol does come through only slightly in the flavor.

The taste is way over spiced and borders on the artificial for me. It is this observers opinion that this beer, along with the rest of the Unibroue line, are cheap imitations of noble beer styles, all with an artificial tasting backbone. I really don't understand all the acclaim this beer continues to receive, but there must be something wrong with me, as just about everyone from the uninitiated to the most seasoned beer enthusiasts seem to give it such high praise.

The body is light, easy-drinking which really goes a long way here. A well executed, refreshing Tripel.","yamar68","Mar 02, 2012"

The malty sweet and sharpness of the carbonation balanced off the sweet and salty. Also paired with a more classic french dish of creamy potatoes, pan fred trout and asparagus. The full flavour and dry aftertaste compliment the fish and butter in the dish - great offering.","FondueVoodoo","Feb 14, 2012"

The doughiness cuts into that sweetness nicely and allows me to really enjoy what would otherwise be a overl sweet beer for me, personally. A nice medium bodied, maybe even a little heavy creamy moutfeel. I had tried one Unibroue offering prior to this and really disliked it and almost wrote the entire brewery off. So glad that I didn't as this is a mighty fine brew that I would have hated myself for if I never gave it a try.","denver10","Feb 10, 2012"

Poured from the bottle, the beer radiates a pleasant sour but fruity aroma. The scent gives a positive hint of what is to come. Giving a moderate head, the color is a cloudly golden color. The initial taste is a nice fruity sour flavor. It almost seems like a orange flavored Belgian. For some reason, I feel like the taste should be somewhat more complex. Being a Tripel, it is somewhat thick. Some might even describe it as being slightly chewy. There is some degree of spiciness in the aftertaste that is accompanied by a slight warming sensation as the beer goes down. While the aftertaste is mild, it does leave a pleasant reminder.","JohnnyHopps","Feb 06, 2012"

However, it's a good pairing with any cuisine – especially spicy Mexican or latin food. Thai food could also work well.

4.38,1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5," I have seen this beer on the shelf at my local grocery store for sometime now. Judging by the strange name and label, I dismissed it in the past. It had a price of $7.50 for the 750ml bottle. I was in the mood for something different with a high ABV(had a bad day). I held it up to the light and to my surprise I saw a nice cloudy haze with a decent amount of sediment on the bottom. Poured it into my trusty DFH pint glass. The color was a bright orange-yellow with a one finger head. It aroma was glorious, with citrus, clove, and the obvious high ABV. The first sip was a revelation. I am a BIG hefeweisen fan, and this tripple was a close cousin. The high ABV was overshadowed by the fruit and yeast notes. This might be my new favorite brew, and that is saying alot. It turned my bad day around 180 degrees. Prost!","ElCaholicRacer","Jan 05, 2012"

The smell of the beer is a little citrusy and has some sweet grainy aromas too in there. The beer smells refreshing, very lively. The taste of the beer was a little spicy, a little fruity and had a nice amount of bready yeast in there too. The mouthfeel was smooth and rather easy to drink, even for a strong brew like this one.

The aroma is a wonderfully inviting complex mix of spicy phenols, banana, bubble gum, and sweetness. The flavor is much like the nose, delivered with a firm prick of carbonation. A mix of spicy, peppery phenols and fruity esters, the beer finishes dry and flavor lingers nicely. The body is medium and carbonation appropriately high.

Cloudier, of course, if the yeast from the bottle is added, but I prefer the beer without the conditioning yeast. Fruity and yeasty aroma with lots of wheat, bubblegum, alcohol, and pepper. Intense fruity and alcoholic flavors over sweet malt, spices and yeast. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy in consistency. Intense fizzy classic Unibroue style carbonation. A very nice beer.

4.8,11.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"O- I've had this beer many, many times, and it never disappoints. It is widely available, not overly expensive, perfect by itself or with food, and for my money is better than the Belgian forerunners of the style (Tripel Karmeliet, St. Bernadus Tripel, Chimay), and it isn't often (in fact it is damn rare) for a North American brewery to pull of an Abbey style like this. I like tripels quite a bit, and this is easily my favorite. The praise this beer gets is well earned. Due to all of that, and trying to judge for style, I don't know how to not give it a 5 overall.","fsvan","Aug 14, 2011"

4.62,6.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy bright yellow with a nice creamy white head. The head is almost mousse-like which makes me happy. Stone fruit aromas with lots of other ester and banana aromas and some spicy phenolic notes. There is a lot going on here. A little spicy on the palate with a bit of warming alcohol behind that. A nice medium body with a really creamy mouthfeel from the very tightly bound carbonation. Long finish with that characteristic stale (read; subtle) hop finish that I look for in a Belgian beer. This is a delicious beer that I haven't had in a few years and almost forgot how much I like it. Especially when you consider that the Unibroue beers are generally pretty well priced when compared with a lot of American Belgian-style beers this might make it's way into my regular rotation.","BeerAmbassador","Aug 08, 2011"

4.59,6.2,3.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"La Fin Du Monde pours a darkened goldenrod, almost 100% opaque. The pure white head only rises up to about a finger and a half in height, before very slowly collapsing down on itself. Lacing is a bit of a disappointment though. The nose is absolutely textbook tripel. It's redolent of apples and pears and white pepper and clove, all in relatively equal mesasure. The flavor is, quite simply, perfection as far as a tripel goes. There's a pale fruit sweetness (but not too sweet) to kick things off, and it's where the apples and pears from the aroma come in. The pepper and clove yeast phenols come in for the second half of each sip, and it's all held together by a subtle, warming, and pleasant touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is just a touch off to me. I don't know if the body's coming across as too heavy, or the carbonation as too low, but the result is a mouthfeel that's not quite as light and bubbly as the best brewed Belgians. La Fin Du Monde is possibly the best tasting tripel I've ever had, but some of the odds and ends (looks and mouthfeel) just don't quite live up to the same level.","axeman9182","Aug 05, 2011"

The aroma of the spicy Belgian yeast and sweet malt hit me as soon as I cracked the bottle and is magnificent! Taste is very balanced and compares favorably to some Belgians I've had... Mild fruit esters compliment the sweet, creamy malt. Slightly dry finish. Mild pepper notes. Mouthfeel is luxuorious and carbonation is medium to high, standard for the tripel style.

The only things that I can think to improve upon would be simply matters of personal taste. As far as that goes, I like a tripel with a very strong spice presence in the nose, which is a tad lacking here, but again that is no reflection upon this beer, but my own personal taste. This beer is an absolute must-try. Nearly perfect.","Kuromaru","Jul 19, 2011"

4.44,2.8,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, an outstanding version of the style. This beer would be a perfect pairing with so many foods, strong enough to stand up to anything but never dominant. Just a world-class beer that I think anyone would enjoy.","draheim","Jun 21, 2011"
4.77,10.4,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Overall - this is just a phenomenal beer that really gives a delicious yeasty and fruity flavor, but yet has some complexities that I will have to try it many more times to decipher it all. An amazing beer, a pleasure to drink.","Stretch270","Jun 20, 2011"
4.69,8.6,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Why did I wait to try this? Pours a hazy, cloudy golden yellow, shiny white head that fades fast. Can smell the yeast in this beer from across the room. Huge. Taste: Yeast comes first, candy sugars. malt backbone is there. Balanced and drinkable. Mouthfeel was smooth, palate agreeable. Overall, best Tripel I think I've had.","gskitt","Jun 19, 2011"
4.77,10.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"O: As I said: One of my favorite Belgian style beers. Infinitely drinkable, it balances all the flavors nicely and not only keeps the 9% alcohol from overpowering the taste of the other elements, but actually incorporates it into the balance. Really a great beer, worth going well out of your way for.","DaveBlack","Jun 19, 2011"

4.38,1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours the perfect picture of a Belgian Tripel. Hazy, glowing golden yellow with a constantly effervescing, incredibly persistent and creamy white head. Aroma of light, sweet grains, esters of lemon zest and a hit of barnyard funk. Flavors of creamy, light grain with an ever increasing honey sweetness that tails off into a lemon zest, and earthy and slightly alcoholic finish. Highly carbonated, creamy and palate clinging with a persistent aftertaste. Fabulous!","olmatty","Jun 18, 2011"
4.38,1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: I purchased this one after my last try of a tripel when I saw that this was the highest rated in it's style. It definitely is very good, I can't saw with certainty that it's better than all others in this style, but still very tasty. I would definitely be willing to shell out the money again to drink this one.","Tartarus","Jun 18, 2011"
5,15.7,5,5,5,5,5,"O: This is a fantastic beer, the only one so far that has truly lived up to its hype. It has a high abv, but you don’t really notice it until you stand up after drinking 750 mL of it.","Tford","Jun 18, 2011"

4.97,15,4.5,5,5,5,5,"This beer pours a golden straw color with a bit of haze to it and a big head that lasts a little while, though i don't know if that was from the beer itself, or the fact that i was the last pour from the 750ML bottle. The smell is is wonderful with belgian yeast notes up front with the floral spiciness following and finishing with malty breadiness. the taste is very similar to the smell with a great belgian yeasty spiceness up front and a bread like sweetness to finish it off. the mouthfeel is amazing as the beer seems pretty dry at first then in the finish rounds out with a little sweetness, and nice carbonation. overall this beer is an A+","rowingbrewer","Jun 17, 2011"

4.08,-5.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not fundamentally opposed to Tripel's, but they're not really my first choice in beer style. However, this one is just delightful :) The color is pretty beautiful, pouring as a opaque golden color. The head was a bit foamier at first (as with all Belgians) , but it soon settled into a nice, thin, creamy blanket resting on top. At 9% the alcohol content is relatively high, but the sweet honey flavors, malts, and yeasts balance each other very well, effectively masking any overwhelming taste of alcohol. Carbonation wasn't overbearing (my usual complaint with Belgian beers). Probably the best Tripel I've ever had. Definitely worth a try, even if you're not a fan of Belgian style beer (which I'm not!).","Interfectus","Jun 11, 2011"

But, as it stands, this is not one I’ll be talking about for a while. That being said, it’s a great example of this style, with a clear emphasis on yeast and esters.

4.57,5.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Less head than I had expected, but quite thick one finger float. Lace is light but clingy. Color is a slightly hazy 5 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is intoxicating, with sweet aromas of apple, melon, grapefruit, cranberries, and malt. Taste is fruity/flowery, with flavors of apples, grapes, figs, melon, grapefruit, and warm spices. Mouthfeel is a little bit sticky, but creamy with ample amounts of carbonation. Just a bit of drying on the sides of my tongue and soft palate. The warming effect from the ample amount of alcohol sort of hits you like ever increasing waves of the ocean. One of these will give you a great buzz. A little sweet to drink them one after another, but a great beer to sip while enjoying conversation or a good movie.","beerprovedwright","May 25, 2011"

Bready taste, malty, light sugars, a touch of spice, fruit salad: banana, peach, pear, and a lot of sour orange and grapefruit zest, giving an instant drying effect.

3.96,-8.3,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a bright yellow with a small white head that goes away fast. The scent is of some spicy yeast with a sweet, bready background. The taste brings out more of that sweetness and the spiciness is right there with it. The bread flavor is lying around back there but isn't as prevalent. The mouthfeel is very carbonated but it doesn't feel over the top for this beer. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and will keep it in my fridge at all times.","gonzogrover","May 11, 2011"
4.33,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Not really sure what something like this is doing at a Cinco de Mayo tasting, but I'm not gonna argue with good beers being served to me. It pours a lightly cloudy straw topped by a tall tor of stark white foam. The nose comprises black pepper, clove, banana, orange peel, wheat, and cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light candi sugar and light caramel. This added bit of sweetness and minor complexity boost really makes everything come together nicely on my tongue. The body is a hefty light (or a really light medium), with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a great beer, one of the best tripels currently on the market. Get some!","TMoney2591","May 06, 2011"

It was somewhat sweet and had some yeasty notes. Not as overbearing as I feared from the smell. However, the clove taste was too strong to be pleasant. It was the primary character of the beer. The actual ingredient was probably coriander, I suppose, which is frequently used to flavour trippels. However, I found its overbearing character unpleasant. It didn't form a piece of the beer's character. Rather, it was probably covering many other notes it may have had.","ElCommodoro","Apr 19, 2011"

Drinking it makes you feel warm. You get a lot of the spices (cloves?) along with a deliciously sweet maltiness.

This beer is so complex and full of flavor, it's ridiculous. I get delicious yeast flavors with some fresh bread. Tons of fruit: apples, bananas, white grapes, melon, and a hint of orange. There are some tasty peppery spices along with clove and some bitter hops. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry. Very complex and full-bodied. Drinkability is very high considering ABV is well hidden.

4.53,4.9,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"Pours a golden straw yellow, cloudy, with an irrepressible head that I had to wait to die down to pour the full glass. Head slowly withdraws to one finger (where it stays), but the strings of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass persist. Smell is sweet, like champagne, citrus, or apple juice and honey, and powerfully yeasty, but a lovely combination that's quite different from most beers. Taste is delicious, again fairly sweet, but complex. Hard to describe - a lovely light combination of peppery, sweet, citrus, and mild hops. The high carbonation, which is surprisingly not disruptive, does a really interesting thing - it bounces the flavors around, making them come in bubbly waves. It's a really odd sensation, like the bubbles are alternately masking, carrying away, and returning different flavors. Mouthfeel is nice, but rather light for a tripel, and carbonated as much as it could be without being too much. Alcohol kick is absent, despite it being 9%! All in all a delicious and very enjoyable drink; a fantastic combination of taste and tactile sensation.","zeledonia","Feb 23, 2011"

When I took a sip I did notice some alcohol on the back of the tongue. The taste was dominated by lemon and wheat, it was a bit sour and has hints of clove. This is a full bodied beer, the soft carbonation lightens it up creating a pleasing experience. I am not big on triples or wheat beers, but this one is on another level, the alcohol is hidden extremely well and I would love to have it again.","JMad","Feb 18, 2011"

Very light and pleasant though... The taste has a little more oomph to it. It's a pretty sweet beer, but good. Not much alcohol taste, and at 9% ABV, that's impressive. I'd actually like to taste a little alcohol burn with this one. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Nice fruity, light aftertaste. Drinkability is pretty high. I could drink several of these before the alcohol would catch up, it doesn't taste like a high ABV beer. Overall, this is a good beer that borders on great.

I have had this beer with all walks of life and not only does everyone love it from people who want "light" beer to people who want "dark" beer, but the fact that this is 9 % abv is unreal.

It's a very tasty tripel, I've just found some others that mask the ABV a little better.

The aroma is a bright and delicate mix of wildflowers, orange peel, lemon zest, candi sugar, bread dough, and bubblegum esters. The taste is moderately sweet upfront but also very floral. There's some bright notes of citrus zest upfront as well. The middle is chewy and doughy with a little straw and estery notes.

Fruity apple in the body underpinned by sweet spicy flavors. Sour malt and yeast to finish. Smooth. And then very slowly, very subtly, the beer shifts into another gear and that dull alcohol warming comes through in the aftertaste. It's a thing of beauty. This is a gorgeous beer.

Very easy on the nose with some floral, banana, cloves and sweet malts notes, with a slight touch of alcohol.

Literally no alcohol presence here either, making it easy to drink and enjoy.

4.8,11.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"La Fin du Monde is officially a "triple fermentation Golden Ale." Like the best Belgian tripels, it's a strong pale ale that perfectly blends malt and hops. It's a big beer at 9% alc./vol., but not overpowering. It flavorful but not too spicy. It's certainly not the very best beer in the world, but it would be hard to find one that better incorporates all the best things about beer. "This beer is brewed to honour of the great explorers, who believed they had reached the end of the world when they discovered America," Unibroue says on their website. One could argue that after La Fin du Monde, there's less of a need to keep searching for that desert island beer.","DKter","Sep 13, 2010"

4.69,8.6,4,5,5,4.5,4,"It pours a single pinky full of snow white froth, excellent carbonation with hundreds of tiny bubbles floating freely as the aroma hits your nostrils with a sweet, strong, sparkling wine scent. It settles as a cloudy light amber concoction, resembling a wit, yet we all know better. A full bodied tripel with a taste almost as tempting as an authentic Trappist ale. Very sweet lacking the tang of more domestic Belgian style ales. Decently strong alcohol content, yet it barely hints wards this. Mild, not overbearing (read New Belgium Tripel), coriander flavor. Very delicious, a new favorite of mine, considering it's cost is very reasonable (6 bucks for a 750ml bottle). Will buy again, and again.","Danistheman","Sep 05, 2010"

As for flavor - I'm not a huge Tripel guy but this will be my "go to" as a change from my normal heavier beers. The taste is very complex with many malty/fruity flavors. Alcohol is dangerously hidded - you want to chug it but it'll hit you if you do. I didn't notice an alcohol flavor until I would breathe in after swallowing a mouthful. As it warms more pepper shows itself. The mouthfeel is what really gets you with this one. Very creamy feel. Great beer. You just want to keep drinking this one but have to be careful due to the 9% that I felt immediately (but didn't really taste). You have to remind yourself to slow down and really savor this one. Great beer (especially considering the price/availability).","plumcrazyfx","Sep 03, 2010"

Sweet aroma typical for a Unibroue ale, somewhat of a honeysuckle smell. Has a semi hefe weissen unflitered look to it, with high carbonation. Sweet taste initially, with the carbonation definitely noticeable Slightly bitter and tart, defined spice and floral notes. Light citrus, perhaps a tangerine hits after the initial carbonation.

Medium bodied with a a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel with a hint of alcohol. The 9% is definitely well hidden but will sneak up on you quick.

Fluffy pillow of white head stays at 2 fingers for a while, a cap covers it the whole time leaving good lacing. Lots of peppery yeast and light fruits in the nose. Apple, peach, a little grassy. Definitely let this sit for a few minutes before sipping or the carbonation will kill you. The peppery yeast and spice is very up-front in the taste which may turn some people off, but I like it. Many great flavors are there such as clove, green apple, banana. A bit of a medicinal feel which seems common in tripels I've had. There is a nice subtle sugary sweetness. Booze is a little hot at first but nearly disappears after some time. Great aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, the extreme carbonation dies down after a few minutes. Like a good tripel, the alcohol is well-hidden. Very easy to drink, 12 oz is not enough, 750ml is a perfect amount for this. Good price for the quality. Excellent stuff, but I think Allagash Tripel remains my favorite for the style.","Chico1985","Apr 19, 2010"

Never ending stream of bubbles rise from the etching. Great looking brew. Smells of bananas and a bit of alcohol. Seems to have a spicy nose to it, more complexities that I can't seem to filter out. Overall, a very pleasing scent comes with this brew. Taste is great. Has that hint of banana and clove, truly appetizing. A bit of alcohol warmth follows up, but is a bit difficult to detect, possibly making this brew a dangerous one. Triple fermentation process gives this a nice tingly feel on the palate, though it is ultra smooth on the way down. This could be the End of the World, if consumed unwisely. The drinkability on this one is unbelievably high, especially for an ale of this strength. Two bottles of this wouldn't seem unreasonable, until after you finished the second.

Plenty of clove, pear and apple meld with sweet pale malt. Alcohol is perceivable, but does not take away from the beer's flavor. Flavors added by the yeast seem to be the star of the show. Medium body with ample carbonation that lends to a luxuriously effervescent mouthfeel. Finish is tart and dry. This beer is refreshing, but I would not necessarily say it is remarkably drinkable.

The lacing on the glass was thick and clung to the glass up until time to wash the glass. The initial smell of this brew was that of fruits, champagne and slight hint of alcohol. The initial taste was that of fruits, malt, champagne, and some possible floral notes.

Something was strange. It was a spicy Tripel smell, but a bit too unpleasant for me. Maybe too strong? I dunno what the problem was. The taste was outstanding, second only to Allagash's. A bit more apple in the taste in this one. I really enjoyed it and it was super drinkable. With the exception of the smell, this beer was about perfect.

The nose is of thick floral beds, lots of clove, and sweet honey. The taste is heavy clove and warm alcohol coats your throat. There is a slight kick, but a good balance and if sipped rather than drank, it leaves a tingling sensation in your throat. This has a thin body, but moderate carbonation.

As a Canadian, I'm glad to say it held up well, and only lost my vote in its contest because the Karmeleit had slightly more complexity. The general consensus was also that the sweetness actually worked against it. On the nose, there's a wonderfully fruity and spicy aroma (which I now recognise as the house yeast strain). The initial flavour hit comes from cloves and cinnamon, but then transitions to sweet phenolic malts, that strongly emphasise apple and pear. I wish it had a slightly crisper finish, which I think would be more to style, but it's pleasant nonetheless.","bobsy","Nov 09, 2009"

The color is a pale straw and the beer is a little hazy. The smell is mild. Smells a tiny bit sweet and malty, and its got that "Belgian" phenol thing going, but faintly. The taste is fantastic. Up front, there's lemon, pear and yeast, and it has a nice sour middle followed by a very clean finish. The alcohol is very well hidden.

It tastes of sweet orchard and tropical fruits with some nice boozy alcohol and mild hop bitterness in the finish. The alcohol lends this beer a spicy character. The carbonation is fairly high and plays nicely with the peppery alcohol. It's so potent, but it just goes down like water - especially when it's just slightly cool. The alcohol doesn't hinder it at all in that respect. This is a 750mL bottle - when you think about it, you're really having a little more than two to begin with, and it's still going down like water towards the end.

Very nice aroma... average yeast, some fruitiness as well. Great on the palate... full body, creamy, with lively carbonation. You can taste light alcohol, but it's not overwhelming at all.

It's kind of bitter, but not too bad. You can definitely taste the citrus as well, but I can't get the cork out of my mind. Not very pleasing, not bad, but not good. Mouthfeel is fine and smooth.

Then you can smell a peppery fruit. That was what caught me sort of off guard, but as soon as you taste it you know it all just works. The cloves are there above it all, wtih a fruit flavor following, followed by just a hint of hops. The aftertaste is alcohol and just a touch bitter. At 9% I couldn't drink more than one of these 750 ml bottles, but it would surely make me want to try. Thought the cork was nifty too.","showell","Mar 03, 2009"

The other beers which come close are all $10 for a 750ml so for twice the amount of beer I'll almost always turn to La Fin du Monde.

Big whiffs of tropical fruit begin, with mango, papaya, pineapple, a bit of must and nectar in there as well.Taste is very fruity, with the fruits mentioned above included, but then there is a spicy character that comes in, followed by a solvent alcohol taste that can best be compared to vodka. Body is medium, slick on the mouth and pretty hot I have to say. I am glad I opted for the single instead of an entire bottle, as this one was really hard for me to finish.

The brew has a nice cloudy dull yellow color to it with a slight tinge of orange. Some lacing down the side but think it could be more with a slightly more vigorous pour. The aroma is very pleasing, with a good Belgium smells, citrus, pear, maybe slight apple cider like, spicy yeast with slightly sweet malt. This is a very inviting brew, with it weighing in at 9 % I am not picking up and hot like aromas. The flavors don't seem as complex as the aroma, but they are damn good. one the first sip the malt is the first thing to come out for me, sweetness, which then breaks to a mild spiciness that lingers at the back of the mouth. From the second sip on other flavors come out. Clove and peppers seem to add more to the spiciness that I initially picked up. Hops seem to add to the spiciness that also seems to tickle the back of the mouth and tongue. Alcohol is a little more present here and comes out more as this brew warms, but that flavor is very good as it still seems muted and is not in anyway over powering the brew. This is another brew which I have just walked by for years. I knew of the reputation of being a great brew but for some reason I passed, well I think my feelings have clearly changed.

Closely knit nose of pressed lemon and tangerine peels, oats and yeast, light clove, dried flowers, not that expressive but the right parts come through. Medium-bodied with an outwardly expansive mouth feel, could seem hollow if you're looking for thick body. Carbonation level is above average and churns things up some. The lemon, tangerine citrus as well as clove, coriander, cumin spice remains a primary focus. Pine tar, floral sap come in too.

4,-7.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The beer pours a hazy gold with a fluffy white head. The head does not stay around long and does not leave any lacing. The aroma is fruity and spicy. The flavor is full of esters and spices. The beer is a medium bodied sipper that hides its alcohol well. IMO the beer is a bit overrated. While it is a solid triple I do not think it is that much better than some of the other triples I have enjoyed.","bonkers","Jan 03, 2009"

It's nicely carbonated, and thick enough to fill the mouth well without sticking in the throat. It's a sipper, for sure, but goes down quite pleasantly.

Out of a caged bottle at a beer tasting at the Fresh Market in Burlington this one was a pale yellow color. The head was two fingers of bright white foam that displayed good retention even as a skim and left streaks of nice lacing. The aroma was of lemon zest, dry wheat, floral hops and semi-sweet malt. The flavors were distinctly sweet, tart green apples, hints of pear, floral and citrus hops, some fruity alcohol esters that then finished on a tangy wheat note. The finish lingered but not unpleasantly. The carbonation and body were medium and the mouthfeel was quite smooth.

Citrus is the most prominent smell accompanied with a bit of malt. Taste matches the smell; nice sweet citrus with a very high amount of carbonation. Maybe this could explain why the 9% alcohol content is so well hidden. The first thing that I thought of when I tasted this was Mill St.'s Belgian Wit, just with more carbonation and a little more complex. This beer is very easy to drink considering its high abv.

Unibroue beers have superb feel and delicious flavors. It's certainly the best tripel that I've tried that is not from Belgium. The beer has a somewhat inconsistent look. The head bubbles up, but it settles into a calm champagne look without much lacing. The misty liquid is quite appealing, on the other hand. The nose is earthy and spicy. It has a genuine Belgian flavor that is subtle and often lacking from American versions of Belgian styles. The flavor has this same Belgian earthiness, that quality that marks some of the best beers in the world. The feel is of a billion tiny needles gently exploding. The drinkability is incredibly high. This beer really made me a big fan of Unibroue. I've tried a lot of their styles and this one still stands as a top beer for Unibroue and craft beer, generally.","popery","Nov 25, 2008"

A fruity aroma of apples and pears, with a gleam of hops, clove spice and bready yeast. A magnificent taste of fruits and spices and a light, very smooth mouthfeel that just barely conceals the alcohol. A world-class tripel that lacks the same complexity of premium Belgians of the style. I wish I would have taken greater advantage of Unibroue while I was going to school in Quebec.","itcomesnpints","Oct 07, 2008"

It is light, zesty, and crisp at the same time that it is a bit almost oily soft and warming, which is an interesting point. The flavours, however, are subdued and it lacks richness or real complexity. There is a hint of some complexity, but the qualities seem so muted and muddled that not much is going on aside from alcoholic sweetness and tart, yeasty fruit.","Offa","Oct 03, 2008"

The smell is dominated by the unique yeasts, as is the taste, which also boasts a bit of a hoppy flavor, at least to my palate. The dominating trait is the carbonation; I find it a bit overbearing.

Pours a somewhat cloudy, thick, blonde color. Nice sized head that does fizzle down a bit. Strong aroma consisting of citrus bananas, cloves, vanilla and an overall strong alcohol presence. There's a lot there. The mouthfeel is pretty full although something seems a bit off with a tangy, somewhat sour, very yeasty, citrus (oranges and bananas) flavor. There is an alcohol rush in there so you know it's 9%. I've had other Tripels recently that are better, Karmeliet and Chimay Cinq Cents come to mind, but this is a better beer than I original though. 4 years ago I had said -- La Fin Du Monde does mean "End of the World" which is what's going to have to happen for me to ever try this crap again!

It goes down dangerously smooth and the flavor lingers for quite some time. I can't imagine myself enjoying a beer much more than I enjoyed this one.

The beer tastes of citrus with some spices; what makes this beer the best is the sweet citrus flavour. The citrus flavour is mixed with some other flavours I can't pick up on.

Great pour, orange-yellow dark in the middle and lighter around the edges with a monster of a head. This beer couldn't be smoother and a pleasant finish with a slight alcohol burn is perfect for me.

Sheets of sticky lacing coated the glass throughout the tasting. Scents of spices and wheat. Flavors of lemon zest, pepper, coriander, yeast and alcohol. Green apple and pear were expressed as the brew warmed. Mouthfeel is very lively with a residual tingle that lingers between quaffs. Consistency is between light- and medium-bodied.

The aroma is citrus, lemons and oranges, up front with hints of clove and banana coming through. The taste is really sweet. Just a bit to much for me. It really overpowers the other flavors in the beer. I find it quite a bit distracting. Notes of vanilla, oranges and clove come through also.

Mouthfeel is really good, sporting a silky smooth feel that changes into a very unique foam like character with a swish. Overall this was quite enjoyable the whole way through.

Delightful pear, apple and banana notes come to the fore with the first sip, along with a bready/yeasty goodness. Taste finishes with a sparing tinge of herb. Medium viscosity gives this beer a very interesting feel...has a light creaminess to it that perfectly matches its other characteristics. 9% you say? I wouldn't believe you if I wasn't finishing up the bottle. Alcohol is wonderfully (and dangerously) masked.

Slightly hazy with a pillowy white top that slowly drops down leaving sticky patches all over the glass, it begs to be enjoyed. The smell is fruity, like overripe peaches, and just a little boozy. The taste is sweet nectar. Light and fruity to open, given way to a slight yeasty flavor, while the great carbonation keeps it crisp. The alcohol is very well hidden, just an afterthought of the sip.

Light, full of body and flavor, very drinkable yet just enough alcohol punch to let you know that you are drinking a quality beer.

It has a strong sweet aroma with lots a citrus smells like lemons and oranges. It has a good semi crisp feel on the tip of your tongue, it smooth overall with a medium body and leaves a faint hint a residue in your mouth. Its got a clean taste that's sweet and spicy and is followed up with a semi dry aftertaste with a little bit of bitterness in it.","vickersspitfire","Apr 28, 2008"

It's a bit more expensive than the regualar case of beer by a few dollars but will be well worth it. It is one of those beers that after tasting it, none others are ever as good and will be constantly compared to it. It is the perfect drink to have with some good food or just alone in a nice setting. One of the most incredible things about it, is that it has such a great taste that it actually masks the 9% abv and will leave you wanting more all night. It also looks nice and has a nice feeling on the tongue. Cannot go wrong with this. The only problem with it is finding it sometimes in stores.","gavmeconi","Apr 22, 2008"

Pours a nice deep honey colour, a little cloudy, with moderate head and lacing. The smell was warm and fruity with some strong spicy notes (even though it's not a heavy, wintry beer, the smell reminds me of X-mas timea bit). Mouthfeel was appropriately fizzy for a fruit flavoured drink, IMO. The taste borders on being sweet, but the spices stop it before it becomes too much. To me, to be perfectly honest, it doesn't really taste like my conception of what a beer should be; I'm not sure why exactly. Some of the people I was with declared it their favourite of the evening; I don't agree with this, but it was a fine beverage nonetheless.","MyGoodness","Apr 16, 2008"

One has to peek underneath to examine the cloudy orange hue of this Canadian beer. The aroma is slightly underwhelming, but notes of spices and citrus are noticeable. Aspects of wheat are also (interestingly) present. The taste is light but complex: there are flavors of bright citrus and lighter malts-darker malt characteristics are present during the lingering aftertaste. What kills me the is smoothness of the mouthfeel; all the carbonation must be in the head!

Medium body and smooth on the palate. Soft full carbonation lends a creamy, slightly crisp feel. I'm a little scared of how drinkable this is. Watch out for the 9%abv.

4.2,-2.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Slightly hazy and orangish dirty-blonde in color, with a large fuzzy, bubbly white head. The smell is a bit sweet of caramel, with bushels of tart fruits and yeasty spice. The taste synch's with the smell nicely. Belgian candy sugar sweetness is light in comparison to tart green apples, pears, and lemony citrus. Bread-like maltiness continues to fill the body, and yeasty, light pepper spiciness closes this one out. Medium bodied with loads of fresh carbonation lead to a bubbly, yet creamy mouthfeel. This is my first--and a quite good offering--from Unibroue. It is not the equal of the Bernardus triple I recently had and, while I have not yet taken on the Westmalle, Karmeliet, or other big dog's of the style, it still seems a very good beer.","Slynger","Jan 21, 2008"

Big time tutty-fruity bubble gum! Flavor is very sweet. Sweeter than the last time I had it. I find it is missing some of the dryness and white pepper notes I enjoy in this style, and think I used to enjoy in this brand. The finish is a little cloying, and the body is a little to full for a tripel. A Belgian brewer will say it is to filling, and I would agree. Not sure why the change, this has been a great beer, and it still is good, just not as good as before.","beerking1","Jan 17, 2008"

Pours a hazy, cloudy, yellow, straw-color with a decent frothy head... aroma is all fruits, with lemon, coriander, and citrus pouring through... taste is super-rich, thick, and creamy, and strongly complements the aroma with its fruit-like characteristic dominated by light, cloudy overtones... one of the better beers out there... every beer that I've sampled from Unibroue has been above and beyond and this one fails to disappoint... a definite must-try...

The appearance is an amber-brown, with a slightly opaque quality. The smell is pretty citrusy, though it doesn't overwhelm you. The taste is where this one shines. It gives you hints of apple and other fruits, along with a yeast flavor. The mouthfeel is very lively - some might say a little bit too lively - giving off a highly carbonated texture.

There's a tinge of alcohol heat left in the throat which lets you know what you're drinking. I like this, and would not change it. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied yet quite drinkable.

Aroma is yeasty with a lot of mixed fruit and spices; bananas, pears and cloves come to mind. The taste reminds me a lot of Duvel and a little of Chimay at first and then as it warms it reminds me more of Chimay and less of Duvel. It would be interesting to do a side by side comparison of these three. The carbonation is coarse and bubbly leaving a very clean mouthfeel. This is a very good beer. I will be drinking it again.","CDBeerDisappear","Jan 08, 2008"
4.17,-3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer pours into the goblet with a brilliant deep gold color with a frothy white head. The head dissipates to a nice film with whisps but does not leave too much lace. The smell of the beer is up front with sweet maltiness mixed in with the Belgian style yeast and some unknown spices. The taste is very complex. Just like the smell, the sweetness hits you first. This is very quickly followed by the belgian yeast along with the spiciness hitting you in the mouth like a punch. As the beer finished, a strong hop flavor is quite apparent and then the sweetness of the beer along with some fruitiness (apple?) returns and lingers on your tongue. The mouthfeel is low-medium with an incredible amount of effervescence. The finish leaves that sweet, yet dry feeling in your mouth. Overall, a highly drinkable triple. This is a very nice beer, and in a style I would not usually reach for.","MSchae1017","Jan 07, 2008"

Thick meringue-like foam that could just about float a Buick over a translucent straw yellow that was so totally absent of red that I was looking to see if was actually little greenish. Fine aroma of pepper and clove with a little apricot. A slightly sweet-tart fruit start to the flavor that is cleansed by the spicy yeast notes and a little solventy presence that gives away the 9% ABV, though the body and the alcohol work well to offset each other. Surprisingly drinkable for a high ABV brew, like many of the Belgians that it emulates, and is indeed worthy of joining their ranks.","MillRat","Dec 25, 2007"

The finish adapts a more rounded flavor with a smoother lemon, lime flavor, grassy straw, and buttery malt. Semi-smooth mouthfeel on a thin to medium body and a very big carbonation.

4.08,-5.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Bought this bottle from CrackedKettle after reading and hearing so much about it. I thought I must give this a shot, being a fan of Unibroue's brews. I served the Fin Du Monde in my Duvel tulip and it billows up with a nice thick head good retention. The beer itself is a hazy orange golden color. On the nose, I have yeast, malts, some floral aromas as well as a light dash of apricot. The taste comes in with very subtle sweetness and clear yeast with a nice bready malt backing to it. It was somewhat similar to some blonds but very well done in this one albeit the fact that I am not to comfy with too much yeast jumping at me. Slightly citrusy in the taste but not much fruits detected which was a pity (think there was also a dash of apricot here). Some clear bready earthy tones too. The taste was generally strong and fairly complex, although I am not a big fan of yeasty tastes, I have to take my hat of this one. The finish was also yeasty but it unveiled a most wonderful after taste thereafter. I had apricots and then clearly apples with some very sublte malt sweetness. After the apples came delicious grapes lasting though a bit and "strong", "tasty" and "lingering" would be how I describe the after taste! The Fin Du Monde is between medium to full body thickness and the carbonation was good and active. Alcohol warming and strength were clear but the smoothness was not taken away; it goes down a little dry. This is a nice beer and I am glad I tried it though I am not a big fan of blonds. This one is clearly a great blond style for whoever is into the style; it tastes more like a blond than a tripel but that's one hell of a great blond we are talking about. Although I still prefer the Westmalle and Chimay tripels, it is a different gratification that I am after. Fin du Monde is a great beer and albeit not exactly my taste, I do feel that the after taste was awesome.","basica","Nov 01, 2007"

Fruit esters comprised of tart lemon flesh and rind, coupled w/ cidery light candi / beet sugar sweetness and raw honey lend an enticing aroma to this brew. Phenolic clove and mustiness are subdued, but add complexity aromawise. Prickly carbonation and cidery sweetness sharply hit the palate upfront, but quickly yield to yeasty, unbaked dough notes and clove more prominent in flavor than the aroma would suggest. Well attenuated and fairly dry, but since hop bitterness is mild, the overall flavor is slightly skewed towards malt sweetness. Lightly bodied due to the sugar used in the grist w/ a crisp, yet smooth mouthfeel that lends deceptively agreeable drinkability.

Winey alcohol smell also present. Lemony taste upfront with Belgian yeast funk trailing it up. Dryish sweet finish with a rounded tang. At 9%abv this beer at first seems a Duvel clone, but a closer taste reveals far more Belgian yeast character that includes a sourness and a wet blanket funk. This complexity makes this beer a "must try". Try it with seafood dishes, herbed vegetables, cheese courses, or as a night-cap sipper.","mshallah","Jul 10, 2007"

Nose is a true bouquet with natural suggestions of lime, banana, herbs and more. Taste is quite sweet and very fruity/cider-like, with a full mouthfeel and spicy finish which hides the high alcohol content very well. Alcohol burn is noticeably absent for a 9% beer. Certainly give this a try, easy to drink and a nice bellywarmer.","masikon","Jul 07, 2007"

4.27,-1.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a pale straw hue, with the clarity greatly disturbed by the expressive carbonation(another gusher!). The fizzy snow-white head eventually drops to a sturdy cap leaving weak lacing. Pils malt, hay, earthy yeast tones and clean alcohol are the most apparent aromas, with belgian phenols and candy-ish esters become more pronounced as the bouquet opens up. Big Two-Row sweetness and sharp Pils malt upfront, followed by sugary esters and typical Unibroue phenolics. There is some lemongrass, and peach fruitiness in the back, coupled with a strong earthy yeast character that segues into a mellow but full noble hop flavor/bitterness. The hop presence is probably not needed to balance the taste given the drying alcohol and spiciness in the aftertaste, but is a nice accent to an already complex melange of flavors. The body is very thinned-down from presumably viscous and highly carbonated. The crisp mouthfeel is lively and works well with the Unibroue house yeast, but it also helps off-set the considerable residual sweethess left over, as well as lift some of the phenols before they become obtrusive. This ale posesses all the delicate flavors I have found in other Unibroue beers, but is less abbrasive in its alcohol perception with a less aggressive yeast pattern. The finish is surprisingly managable given the strength, probably one of the most drinkable BSPA I've tried. Easy to see why this is the most popular Unibroue ale.","PBRstreetgang","Jul 04, 2007"

The first taste is amazing, as good as anything I've had in ages. Apple, spice, a little bit of hop bitterness, some yeast. Very refreshing and thirst quenching for such a strong beer. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with some nice carbonation on the tongue. I haven't had this beer in a long time, but it was worth the wait. I would add some more to this review, but the more I drink the harder it is to write coherently. So I'll just leave it at this.

The intial tartness and spicy taste is followed by a neutral bitterness. This is the closest thing to a good homebrew that i've ever had.

Taste is not bad for alcohol content and flavors mimic the scents but a background bitterness that leaves a slight aftertaste (usually killed after having the second one.

Aroma contains tinges of apple, citrus, some lemon. Taste is crisp, clean, excellent fruitiness without cloying sweetness, light. Tasty and drinkable. Excellent paired with a meal of fish or chicken. The best feature of this ale is the way it covers a complete taste spectrum without heaviness or leaden weightiness. Unibroue's Maudite and Trois Pistoles are both close seconds.","bjoyce12","Jun 14, 2007"

Once poured, it's a gorgeous golden color, with a fluffy white head. Smell is sweet, hints of caramel, a bit of floral hops, and a rather strong scent of spice. Taste is very much the same, with the caramel coming out a bit more, the spice holding it's own, and the hops taking a definite backseat to the sweet fruity flavor (apple/banana? this one's hard to pin down). Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and it goes down smooth. Drinkability is a bit TOO good for such a high ABV, this one is very easy to overdrink with. Despite that, it's still a great beer, and I look forward to having it quite a bit more in the future.","StargherKing","Jun 12, 2007"

The pour is exceptional, beautiful foggy gold with a serious, off-white, cratered head (from those big, healthy bubbles) that hangs around quite a while. Thick lacing. As I have noted, childhood allergies completely screwed my sense of smell, but the fruitiness couldn't be missed. Maybe raspberries. I can't really say, but if I can smell it, it's there. The mouth feel is full, plenty of carbonation, though it sure doesn't get in the way. It seems like every taste bud is located and activated, lingering and lingering, kicking up the initial rush. Yeasty, but not in your face; some sweetness, but not at all cloying. It's a little peppery on the tongue, and closes with a nice warmth; pleasant, rather calm for a 9% ABV. Everything fits so nicely in this beer. If it were female, it would be powerful, sultry, and smooth. At the top of the pale ale pile. I'll be drinking this a bunch ...","mobius024","Jun 01, 2007"

Second, a good deal of bitterness from the hops and a touch of warmth from the alcohol is noticed, both of these flavors are subtle but they do enough to balance the sweetness. Lastly, I get nice tart lemon along with a bit of grain and peppery spice. A bit of clove and banana are present throughout.

The taste at first could also be a bit deceiving in that it has a natural carbonation that is refreshing and clean. This beer is not your typical hefe in that it is quite a bit stronger, has much more of a bite, a stronger mouth feel, may be a little sweeter, and retains its natural carbonation a little longer than a typical hefe would. This is a very good beer, very enjoyable, and one that I would go back to again. You can't go wrong with this one. The brewery makes quality beers, and Fin Du Monde is one of their better products.

As this beer warms, and the initial high carbonation subsides, the mouthfeel moves from light bodied to medium. The taste is mostly bittersweet and touch metallic.

4.94,14.4,4,5,5,5,5,"Poured into a snifter style glass. Very cloudy, completely opaque and golden in color: there is indeed quite a bit of yeast in this brew. Initially the beer was chilled (don't know approx. temperature) and gradually warmed during the drinking session. It barely had a head (which soon disappeared...a bit unfortunate [though I quite enjoyed the opaque cloudiness!]), and it did have a quite pleasant smell. The taste was very well balanced between the hops and the malt, not too sweet and not too bitter. When it was chilled the flavor was more restrained yet reminiscent of apples. As it warmed up, it had more of a heavier banana flavor. Both the flavor and the feel of it (carbonation) immediately reminded me of champagne (though the comparison follows only to a point). This has definite cross-over appeal (considering the flavor, mouthfeel, as well as the presentation [both the caged and corked bottle as well as the appropriate glasswear]). Along with Stone's Double Bastard and Russian Imperial Stout, Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout and Nut Brown Ale and Orval's Trappist Ale, this is truly my favorite beer so far.","EmilNoldSinclair","Nov 22, 2006"

Aroma of citrus at first, but with another smell I was able to pick out some bananas. Active palate, with plenty of carbonation. Had a yeasty, citrusy taste. Finish was bitter and alcoholic. At first I wasnt that big a fan, but as I sipped more, I enjoyed it and detected some peppery taste. I guess I'm not much of a coriander guy. I particularly enjoyed the last of the 750 ml bottle. A good beer and Im glad I tried it.","MaxxDaddy","Nov 08, 2006"

The m/f is light and the flavors are very well mixed. For a high alcohol beer, there is almost no smell or flavor of the alcohol.

The smell is faint, very little if any aroma for my nose, a bit of soft yeasty sugar and some grassy organic notes. The taste is a knock out, a great smooth, sweet fruity beginning, a nice flowing center where the alchohol becomes more pronounced but not overbearing, then a mildly dry finish gives way to the creamy yeast notes. Really good. The mouthfeel is very full and creamy...which is offset nicley by the tingle of carbonation that rises while to beer is in your mouth.

The taste is really good....citrus, astringent, sweetness, All nicely balanced and very drinkable. The taste reminds me of Hefe's but the mouthfeel is richer. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is well disguised, I could have enjoyed another one. Three would be be pushing it because of the high ABV.

I would call the nose lemony, but with the disclaimer that it is in no way sour. Also along for the aroma ride is a smell I can only call pleasantly milky and a hefty amount of spice. Taste is at once full of mildly sweet lemon, spice, a dash of sweet milk, and smatter of bitterness. Says I to the mouthfeel, "a winner is you" as it is big and full. The light carbonation enhances its creaminess. The lacing looks like a work of art, or more aptly, something drawn from a nitro tap. Yet another head turning Unibroue beer.

Anyway, to cut a long story short, she bought all the La Fin Du Monde they had, but told me it was great! I took my bottles over to the counter and found she'd bought a bottle for me! Thanks lady. I just finished gulping most of it down. It reminds me of one of my favourite Belgium beers - Delerium Tremens. It pours a hazy golden colour and once settled is very quaffable.

Spicy citrus, orange, lemon, etc, in a bready malt mix, which is both sweet and tangy with a slightly sour finish in which the 9% alcohol is well disguised. Immense carbonation strikes the edeges of the tongue, and the feel is rich with a nice medium body. Coats the palate well.

Taste is that Belgian-style spicy malt that we all know, closing with the most subtle alcohol warming.

Smells of malts and spices, citrus, yeasty bread, slight sting of alcohol present on the nose. Tastes absolutely incredible, hits with citrus and hops first, then a little fruiter, banana flavor present some, finishing a little on the yeasty side with the malt flavor and a slight bite from the 9% abv that is easily forgotten when drinking this lighter ale. Mouthfeel is slick and moderately carbonated. Drinkability the lowest point of this brew, and although suprisingly light and refreshing as this ale is, still has far too complex of a taste and too high of an abv to want to just drink any more than two or three of these exsquisite brews in one sitting.

Pours a light yellowish-amber with very small particles swirling about but never settling like the sediment I avoiding pouring out of the bottom of the bottle. I guess maybe I jarred the bottle a bit while pulling out of the back of the fridge.

The smell is sweet and fruity, with wonderful aromas of Belgian yeast, clove and apple. The taste is marvelous! Clove, pepper and pear with a slightly medicinal twang... but in a good way. Finishes warm with lingering esters. It has a light body, and an effervescent mouthfeel that finishes smooth. This is a fabulous beer thats quite easy-drinking for a 9% brew.

Nice. Aromas of citrus and floral notes fill the nose. Some hints of malt and yeast are present. Very nice. Taste is not as present as the aroma, but still very quaffable. Flavors of malt, spice, clove and yeast blend together in very heavenly harmony. Complexity is abound in this beer. Mouthfeel is full and savory. Not too heavy as to hinder the experience of this beer, yet not too light as to make it airey. A solid level of drinkability.

There is also some good spicy hop flavor to balance it out in the finish. Very balanced and tastey brew. This has a very nice medium full mouthfeel with some significant carbonation that suits this beer very well. This is 9% ABV but it's hard to tell from the taste- very well hidden.

Phenolics seem a bit minerally in a pleasant way. Alcohol is rather hidden in the flavor but not the effect. Pleasant fuzziness sets in quickly with this brew.

It's citrusy throughout and only slightly bitter towards the end. There's a yeasty vanilla flavor that fades in as the beer warms, and some other spices I can't point my finger on.

Biscuity and bready, the large malt bill leads you into spicy hops with herbal notes. Finish is a little acidic and dry, but you are left with creamy malts and bananas lingering about your mouth.

Taste is great also being strong but easy drinkable cause of perfect balance of taste. Malty, fresh, alcoholic, spicy( pepper) and good fitting bitterness make this into a great brew.

3.88,-10.2,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Hazy, light color. Many cascading bubbles. Thick head which settles into a nice lace. Sweat, malt aroma with citrus undertones. Alcohol scent is hiding in the background. Extremely light tasting, with a melting warmness from the alcohol which covers the tongue. The alcohol flavor is hidden behind a blend of light malt and citrus. Nothing is overpowering here. Everything is subtle. You might think you are drinking a "small" summer beer, as the 9% of this one is so well masked. This one could sneak up on you, if you had the opportunity to have more than a couple.","BobLuvBeer","Apr 23, 2005"

Initially tasted of apples with a slight alcohol aftertaste. As it warmed, I detected an increasingly pleasant taste that reminded me of cola with a hint of sweet citrus.

Throughout the length of the beverage there was a continuous feed of bubbles delivered in fizzures of fine streams reaching upward. Ripe apricot-peach, soft citrus, yeast, and a subtle clove and etoh made for a delightful nose. At times there was a lurking metal essence noted. A medium dimension filled the mouth with again, the fruit of the nose, a hay tang, with light floral and gentle spice. This stuff warms the belly. This La Fin Du Monde 12 oz. bottle was with much carbonation, for me it was too sparkling for balance. The finish was sweet with a dry, peppery, bubbly presence.

Aroma is mostly citrus and sweet smelling hops. I also catch some hints of something reminding me of honeysuckle a little. Also, the yeast is apparent as well (unless I'm stupid). This could be a little honey or presence of the alcohol sugars I imagine. Nutmeg and spice up front with hints of sugar and citrus fruit. However, the alcohol kicks you in the palete real REAL hard also. Aftertaste reminds me of papaya fruit a little or a little like orange peel; kind of bitter yet sweet. Carbonation is well balanced and is not too strong on the sip, to which the alcohol burn hits your palete drying it out a bit before the swallow. I honestly wish I had a bomber of this one.

Beautiful pouring brew, with rich golden translucent color and massive, thick, Duvel-style head. Smell also first-rate: various spices and fruits accompany a malty base. Taste is just about perfect. I don't feel that I've tried enough beers yet to be able to give one a 5, but this is the closest I've come. Lots of banana flavor - almost sweet, but not sickly sweet...I don't generally care much for sweet beer, but this one just works somehow. Very rich, creamy mouthfeel.

A constant stream of bubbles comes up the middle from the bottom of the glass and the head is thick, white and foamy. The smell is crisp and spicy, with plenty of the typical wheats that you would expect from a Belgian. Various spices and fruity aromas as well as some nice grassy flavors are all underpinned by a subtle hint of alcohol. The taste is great on this beer. It is my first Belgian of any sorts in quite a while, and after drinking it, I remember why I like them so much. The body is full and thick with wheat flavors and some spices, very reminiscent of the Hennepin (as I'm sure they're brewed using essentially the same process). It's all very mellow but the more subtle tastes come through after sitting on the tongue for just a second or two, with flavors of cherry and grape, but nothing to overpower the wheat. There's really not very much hop flavor to this beer, but that would probably ruin the delicate flavors. Dry and heavy yet tiny carbonation. Very drinkable, belies the high alcohol content.","FranklinPCombs","Jan 02, 2005"

Flavor is fruitty and spicy, clove with a hint of banana. Malt flavor is there in the taste and also a bit of hops to balance the bitterness. I wonder if this beer is spiced or if it is all from the yeast. Nice mouthfeel but a little to carbonated for my liking, however, once the beer breathes for awhile it dies down to a reasonable level.

The flavor soon segues into a hoppy flavor that makes itself known but is not bitter or overpowering. The flavor finishes with no heat or any indicator of the high level of alcohol this brew contains which to me makes it a perfect beer to introduce a friend into the pleasure of a belgian style beer.

This beer turned me on to Belgian styles, and made me a HUGE fan of Unibroue in general. The yeast ties it to its cousins Trois Pistoles and Don de Dieu, but La Fin is drier, and cleaner. This is a great special occasion beer. Ive tried to turn a few people on to great beer with this one, but its a bit heavy and strong for most of the macro drinking crowd. Personally, this rocked my world at first taste. While this isnt a perfect 5 beer, its darn close. Drinkability in the short term is hampered by the heavy handed 9% abv. but I tend to buy this stuff by the case. I cant recommend this strongly enough to my fellow BAs that may not have tried this.

The aroma was spicy, cidery and fruity... the immediate tangible smell was sour green apples. If I took a big enough inhale, I could feel the alcohol in my nose. Tastewise, it was tangy, sweet, and sour, once again with a focus on an apple-like flavor, with a nice warmth from the high ABV. It sometimes reminded me of reisling and/or champagne - maybe a white grape twang in there too. For all the apparent sweet tastes, each taste ended up surprisingly dry. Drinking it reminded me of Duvel sometimes and Orval other times... strange. The mouthfeel of this beer was wonderful - effervescent and smooth.

I thought about keeping it awhile longer, but couldn't resist. Uncorked it, and carbonation slowly fizzed to the top. May have chilled it a bit too much. When it began to drip over, I poured. It had a nice frothy head that lasted throughtout the glass. Slightly toned down toward the end. Bubbles also lasted throughout, like a good champagne. The color was cloudy gold. Smells were very fruity, and maybe a touch floral. It tasted like apples, pears, and malt. Not bitter at all. As it warmed, it did take on an alcohol taste. Still nothing like I would have expected for 9% abv. Seemed almost rich in mouthfeel. Like a watered down milkshake consistency. As for drinkability, I found that it was gone too soon!!! Quick note on back of bottle, it was quite clear what type of glass it should be drank from. Showed correct picture, then a big X through incorrect one. I got a kick out of that.","finepaws","Jun 30, 2004"

The cork comes off with a very nice resounding "thump", which foreshadows that this is not an ordinary beer. A moderately heavy pour reveals an appearance that is not too out of the ordinary, it's a apricot/darkish yellow, but there is a good sized head and some short-lived lacing. The taste is where this beer really shines. It's at once smooth and creamy, with some orange and tangerine tastes in there, but it also has some zest and fizziness. It also has a great smell, and reminds me of a lighter version of a Chimay or a Duvel. I really liked this beer, and it was reasonably priced (6.00 for a 750 ml).","Trentonator","Jun 01, 2004"

4.12,-4.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"With a violent pop the cork came out, and out poured some liquid gold. The beer itself is thick, although pale looking, and pleasantly sedimentary and unclear, becoming more so with each glass from the 750 ml. Apple juice colouration, dull orange or yellow; I have seen better and more unique appearances in other Unibroue beers. It is still attractive, nonetheless. The head is near uncontrollable, gargantuan, soapy, bright aspirin-white, with good longevity. Soapy lace, large bubbles. The aroma is earthy yeast, citrus, coriander, apples, peaches, and actually reminded me of Hoegaarden, with more complexity. Belgian taste, slightly metallic, strong yeast, citrus, champagne-like, sweet on the front and surprisingly bitter on the finish, leaving a dry, port or sherry aftertaste. Strong spices, almost peppery, but with good enough maltiness and hop-level, leaving a clove-numbness on the palate. Mouthfeel is h-e-a-v-y. This has a very gassy carbonation, and is quite dry, leaving a feel similar to scotch or whisky in the mouth, which would prevent me from consuming these overly often, but this said, it is quite drinkable for such a highly flavourable and strong beer. Conclusion: for me personally, not my favourite from Unibroue, but compared to other breweries, this is still an absolute dream to consume. This Unibroue beer only tastes less-than-extraordinary when compared to its own line of products. Still a spectacular beer from Quebec. I have yet to taste the equal of Unibroue in North America.","Cwrw","May 26, 2004"

Hints of pineapple in the hops were most surprising while the majority of the notes were standard fruits and spices. This is an average interpretation of an awesome style.

3.55,-17.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours golden yellow with a huge, hard to control pure white head - be careful on this pour. Head diminishes to 1/4 inch, where it resides until the bottom of the glass. Subtle lacing. Aromas of white grape, wine alcohol and freshly chopped wood shine through. Initial feel is intense carbonation - very fizzy and active on the tongue. First taste yields sharp grapefruit tartness with other miscellaneous fruity tones coming on strong. Sadly, this burst of flavor doesn't stick around long and abruptly gives way to an oaky and warm alcohol aftertaste. I found the flavor to be somewhat lacking in complexity compared to others I've had from Unibroue. The alcohol here is physically present (1/2 glass is enough to feel it) but hardly noticeable in the taste.

Taste begins with a good deal of fruitiness (nectarine, pear, peach, mango, and white grape) and flowery honey blended with peppery clove. Next comes some powdery yeasts and a bit of bready malt followed by a touch of drying alcohol (which, considering the 9% ABV, is very well hidden indeed).

Sweet scents slowly drifted upwards, along with a cidery fruitiness. Taste is unbelieveable. Peppery tartness, hint of alcohol, fades into a spicy dry finish. Mouthfeel is warm and smooth, not so much piqueing the interest of any particular sensation as much as massaging them all at once.

Beer is a color like translucent (but not truly hazy) goldenrod with straw-gold highlights. Turbulent, racing carbonation sends a few yeasties into convection currents along the sides of the goblet. Almost all of the aromatic nuances seem to belong to the light, sweet, estery yeast. A consistent clove/coriander spiciness is, with warmth, joined by vodka-soaked bananas in a slightly bready nosefeel that finishes dry. Juicy and softly malty up front on the palate; sustained by a spicy tartness moving from clove to ginger (particularly in the aftertaste) and a finish of slightly grassy hops. At room temperature, flavors of banana bread crusts, lemon pith, and powdered sugar emerge. Spiky mouthfeel with an alcoholic warmth and a pearish mealiness; mellow dry spiciness in the finish. Although I love this beer, I prefer less breadiness and more effervescence in a Belgian Strong Pale. Perhaps this is why IMHO this beer is the perfect accompaniment to scrambled eggs or quiche.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Feb 26, 2004"

This golden brew poured a generous fluffy white head that is lacing nicely down the side of my pint. Initially this had a bread like smell that was soon taken over by the spices and fruits that are in this beer. My first taste (not to mention the subsequent sips) was heavenly, an awesome piece of brewing that blends together a highly carbonated combination of malts, hops, fruits, and spices. The mouthfeel is wonderfully full. This beer is one I will seek out in the near future!","arizcards","Jan 25, 2004"

The beer was a pale golden color, and cloudy, with a snowstorm of particulates swirling around driven by large fiz bubbles. After a few minutes, the fizzy head became much finer in texture, and remained voluminous. The nose was lovely, with juicy nectarine, dry yeast, coriander, subtler citrus aromatics and the slightest hint of alcohol. The taste was assertive and delicious, wtih a somewhat tart dry malt backbone, and an up-front sensation of coriander. This was followed by ample flavors of bitter orange , leading into lemony citrus, finishing dry with an appropriate bitterenss, lingering coriander, and refreshing zippy citrus. All flavors were balanced masterfully. The beer had a very satisfying body, with a good level of carbonation. This was a highly enojyable beer that I will certainly buy again.

A loose cap remains throughout the consumption. The lacing is sub-par. The nose is fruity: mangos, passion fruit, and kiwi. Pepper and clove undercurrents. Alcohol hints at the back. The mustiness is noticeable throughout. The potency is modest. I was expecting more but what the nose needed the palate had and then some. The taste was splendid; simply divine with a glimpse of mango and pear fruitiness upfront that is very quickly overwhelmed by spicy alcohol, pepper, cloves, and surprisingly strong yeastiness. Some candied sugar sweetness but it cannot overcome the finish, which is tart (a green apple influence), spicy and peppery as well but with a blend of malty-bread too. The alcohol is very naked and taunting, maybe a little too much so, if it was softer the complexities would not be as drowned out. The palate is very tasty nevertheless. I detect cloves and apples in the aftertaste with a sharp peppery kick on the tongue, interesting! The body is medium with high carbonation, appropriate, very cleansing and refreshing, which is hard to do with such a high abv. Nicely dry as well. La Fin Du Mode is supremely drinkable and quite a pleasant quaff. It has been well worth the wait I scored a 750 ml of this dandy in Kansas City.

Caramel malt taste becomes evident halfway through the experience, and the hops appear about the same time to balance the predominant fruitiness. Excellent drinkability here, and really no faults. Fortunately, several Unibroue offerings are available at the Liquor Barn stores in Lexington, Ky, so I'm just a 2.5 hour drive away from sampling more of these fine Unibroue products.

This yeast sediment, like other Belgians and Belgian-styles, attributes significant flavor profiles that would not be present if either the beer was to be filtered in the brewing process or not decanted into the goblet as to freely distribute the sediment. I believe this beer is more enjoyable with the yeast thoroughly mixed with the beer. It is rather spicy in the nose (Unibroue tends to use many different spices and keeps those recipe formulas under wraps; I know this from talking to one of the brewers at a beer festival I was working at), with evidence of a healthy dosage of candi sugar and some subtle hops (most likely indigenous to North America). Initially sweet and the intricate smorgasboard of spices come through. Finishes drier yet the spice aspect of the beer still lingers. Mouthfeel's heavy yet smooth, not as invasive as one might expect for a Belgian-style at around 9%. Recommended.","crookedhalo","Nov 23, 2003"

I have had equal quality beers but I don't know that I've had better. It explodes with flavor in the mouth and has that pale ale dryness to it, but this is much more than a pale ale.

The high level of alcohol is detected at the end of the sip, betrayed by its warming. I can't really recomend this as a session beer, unless you find the idea of the local authorities pulling you out of the sewer in a comatose condition appealing to you.

You can, at times taste the alcohol - but in a refreshing way not a let's-get-buzzed way. Nice mouthfeel. A bit of a surprise 'cause you expect some heaviness after all the nose and initial contact. But no. It is almost like a cream ale - almost. I goes down smooth with more surprises. A sense of sweet hops, and freshly picked apples in the aftertaste - almost like crab apples.

Flavor is a bit of yeast, then warm honey melts in the mouth, and finishes with some undertones of butterscotch and pine. Mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety. Aftertaste lingers long and delivers more honey. This beer holds its complexity to the last drop, and is surprisingly smooth for the alcohol that it delivers. Very tasty, but low drinkability because it is so rich.","far333","Jun 30, 2003"

It has a very light orange color with yeast particles floating in it. Its flavor contains a variety of different tastes. The carbonation once again rolls off the tongue. It is adding to my buzz tonight. I liked the flavor and taste of the brew. It agrees with me very much. All in all an excellent brew!

The head that was produced was thick, creamy and dense  white in color and stood till the last sip where there was a small skim left on top and a ring around the edges. It left behind a creamy sticky lace that was like a sheet being draped on the insides of the glass at the top then broke off into a delicate pattern at the end. The aromas that came from the glass, were of sweet malts and caramel, fruits (pears, apples) flowers, some hops, yeast, spice and a bit of alcohol (but well hidden). The flavors were of sweet and dark malts, caramel, fruits (more pears and dark apples), wood, citrus tones, light hops, spice yeast and alcohol. There was no aftertaste present anywhere on the tongue. The alcohol is big in this beer but you would never notice it unless you read the label, it is well blended all through the nose and pallet. This beer is smooth, creamy and complex, very drinkable, very, very drinkable.

The look was a golden cloudy color with a tiny lace head that took a little time to dissappear. The citrus was strong in the odor and I could swear I tased some grapes. This was sweet, almost like a champagne with a lot of carbonation. Not a bad brew, smooth, almost too smooth. The 9% alchohol factor could definetly not be noticed.

The slight bit of head I got with each taste added a very pleasant creamy flavor. The smell was predominantly spicy and yeasty. I could not easily pick out one flavor that dominated because the interplay of malt and spiciness was too well balanced. All the flavors also made my mouth sing in anticipation for the next sip.

The color was a pale straw color. Oh, and it was bubbley too. The taste was complex. It had elements of wheat, citrus, flowers, and had a little tinge of alcohol in it.

Initial taste is sweet and malt, followed by a zing of spiciness. This is a medium-bodied beer finishes quite dry. Im amazed at the complexity of this wonderful nectar.

Tastes a very full complex sweetness with shots of bitter and dry sensations that run down the palate. Within the sweetness of the flavor lies a spiced up fruit like, thick mouthfeel of straight up refreshing goodness. Unibroue is amazing they are definitely capable of bringing the magic of Belgium beer to the North Americas, and for that I raise my glass to them.

Cloudy golden color with a nice light, but tight head. Despite a slight tartness, it is still somewhat sweet and very smooth. Also has a nice spice flavor, but not overwhelming. A tripel at its best!

As is the case with the others I've mentioned, pours a huge head, deep golden color, perfect balance. This is one of the few beers I could drink on a regular basis and never grow tired of. I give Duvel a tiny edge, as it is a little unique compared to the other similar beers, but the Unibroue 10, La Fin, and Don de dieu are right there (I also love Maudite and Trios pistoles).

Sweetness and black pepper, odd combination? No way, it's great! Up front it's a little hoppy, then in the middle it gets to the sweet and peppery bit. Bready and a little yeasty as well, all the way through. Tangy citrus and fruitiness shows up at the back a bit more. Hop bitterness is really brought out in the finish, making it very crisp.

4.12,-4.6,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"As it pours from the bottle, a slightly hazy lemon yellow, the head creamy in texture, the size masterful, the color a brilliant white, as it evanesces it leaves a silky sheet of fine lace to cover the glass. The aroma of finely malted grains dominates the nose, citrus crisp, lightly sweet and a pleasure to the senses. Start is ambrosial with lots of malt, the top middling in its feel with a spirited acidity, masterfully hopped, and a long drawn-out aftertaste that is dry. The 9% ABV, make this a real Belly Warmer, for these cold winter days and nights, a beer I love, and I always have a few bottles on hand as they age gracefully and I wish I could say the same for my own self.","Gusler","Dec 28, 2002"

I'm not well versed in the Belgian art (but not quite a virgin either). It pours a very effervescent yellow (lots of bubbly action in the glass) with a thin head. There's an appealing sour-lemon aroma with a little yeastiness. At first sip I'm thinking boy am I drinking this beer at the wrong time of year. Very refreshing, very summery. Comparable to some of the best Hefe's I've had but without the banana/clove flavors. Moderate body, very nice texture. The tart and sweet flavors compete but keep each other in balance. Tart in the beginning, more sweet in the finish. Clearly an accomplished brew even f you're not an expert in the style. I'll have more. Maybe in Quebec.","mickstepp","Dec 09, 2002"

Taste is of lemon and spices with a high alcohol content present. Leaves a sticky coating on the tongue after finishing but is quite drinkable for a something with 9.0% ABV.

A floral taste equally combined with a bold wheat flavor kicks things off, and from there, you're on your own to figure out what flavors you encounter. I sure as hell have a hard time. Ripe fruit with a subtle but noticeable malt flavor might do the trick. I hated this beer at first, but I grew to love the complexity and richness of it. If you're kind of a rookie beer taster like me, check out the Unibroue variety case. It's bomb.

Appearance is wonderful and does have nice rings of wispy lace and good head retention. Fruity, cider-like aroma with pepper and yeast. Medium bodied and very smooth on the palate. Starts with a sweet maltiness that makes way for clove and peppery flavors. Very complex, finishes slightly dry with some hop flavor.

Nice spiciness as well with some pepper and coriander.  The brew finishes with a burst of sweetness from the candy sugar and a slight warming sensation from the alcohol.

A nice malt taste, mixed with esters and yeast make the beer very pleasant.  I also get fleeting hints of sour apples.  I have to second other reviewer's notes that the beer hides it's alcohol well.

4.42,2.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Astonishingly different on tap than it is from the bottle - but not necessarily better. I think it benefits greatly from the high level of carbonation that can be lessened on tap. Cloudy, yellow-gold in color with a full, bright-white head that holds fairly well and leaves a decent lace. The body is similarly light-medium, but the mouthfeel is more creamy as the carbonation has been reduced. There's a lightly sweet "tropical fruit" note to the aroma. The flavor has a more "orange-ish" note, and a gentler spice. Overall, it seems to lose a bit of character which is normally derived from the assertive carbonation bite. Still a very good beer but on draft it seems to taste like many other beers in its category.","NeroFiddled","Aug 23, 2002"
4.55,5.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"The clear light golden / dark straw hued brew is topped by a creamy, impressively thick head w/ stiff peaks of foam.  Signature lace is left down the glass.  Fruit esters comprised of tart lemon flesh and rind, coupled w/ cidery light candi / beet sugar sweetness and raw honey lend an enticing aroma to this brew.  Phenolic clove and mustiness are subdued, but add complexity aromawise.  Prickly carbonation and cidery sweetness sharply hit the palate upfront, but quickly yield to yeasty, unbaked dough notes and clove more prominent in flavor than the aroma would suggest.  Well attenuated and fairly dry, but since hop bitterness is mild, the overall flavor is slightly skewed towards malt sweetness. Lightly bodied due to the sugar used in the grist w/ a crisp, yet smooth mouthfeel that lends deceptively agreeable drinkability.  Finishes dry w/ honey sweetness, lightly peppery alcohol and clove abruptly ending simultaneously.  Fin Du Monde epitomizes the style and is delicious... the drinkability is superlative considering its strength.","marc77","Aug 15, 2002"

It was a little tart with some warming alcohol (9% ABV) lying underneath. It reminded me a little of Duvel in that it hides that big alcohol content underneath a somewhat bittersweet taste and bubbly mouthfeel which just attacked my palate. This one worked well with teryaki marinated pork chops on the grill.","Jon","Aug 10, 2002"

Aroma is lemon on top of apricots. Light lemony/apricot flavor that rides on a noticeable malt backbone. Has a little of the cottony mouthfeel but not enough to hurt the drinkability.

Until I reviewed so many (now 100! Beers), I would have gushed over this beer.  But I must say, it seems like a paler version of its Belgian counterparts.  It was a wonderful looking beer, but had huge chunks of the sediment floating in the second glass, despite my best efforts to pour it steady. Cloudy, golden appearance.  Aroma was very pleasant of citrus and yeast.  The beer itself was very nice, crisp and clean (almost airy) with a mix of bananas and citrus (fresh oranges).
