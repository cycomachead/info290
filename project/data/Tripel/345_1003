Gorgeous golden color and a rapidly dissipating bright white one finger head. Yeast wafts from the pour. There is a dusty, musty yeast undertone that is not unpleasant, but might put some off. The mouthfeel is also noticeably unlively for the style. The high concentration of booze is virtually unnoticeable. In the end, it's a decent attempt, and one that I would enjoy drinking get again, but there are many superior offerings in this style elsewhere. La Fin du Monde and Long Strange Tripel come immediately to mind.","JasW","Mar 08, 2015"

Yeast is a little overbearing. A lot more yeast in the taste. Followed by bready malts. A good deal of fruitiness, with no particular flavor standing out. Fruit lingers on the tongue quite a bit, playing nicely with the yeast. Didn't care for the taste much at first, but it grew on me as it warmed. Medium bodied. Carbonation isn't as heavy as it had appeared after pour. A surprisingly easy drinker for 9.5%. Although I am not particularly well versed in Tripels, I was expecting a bit more from this one. Still a solid beer, but not a must have.","majorbase2","Nov 25, 2014"

3.77,1.9,3.5,3.25,4,3.75,4,"First offering from Victory and this one was a good way to start with them.  Although I wasn't overly impressed with the brew out of the bottle - it didn't appear particularly distinctive to me, and it did have a weak head, there was real nice lacing down the glass.  The scent put out was okay, hints of citrus with a feel that was very bold and inviting - crisp really, making it easy to chug (if you weren't careful.)  Overall I consider it very good and look forward to trying more from this brewer.","jjamadorphd","Nov 16, 2014"

I would hazard to say that this is the beer equivalent of a fortified wine like night train since it has a distinct booziness that really does not taste like it was naturally produced by the brewing process. I thought I would like this one considering I love a complex high abv beer, but this is simply not good enough to justify grabbing unless your primary consideration is getting as hammered as possible off beer cheaply. This is still worth trying at least once considering its popularity and availability, but I would be willing to bet anyone that has drank a wide range of beers would not consider this one a go to.","Nostradrunkus","Oct 11, 2014"

Based on the reviews, I didn't have much expectation. However, I am very pleasantly surprised. This beer is incredibly balanced for being 9.5% in my opinion. Some reviewers are saying that it tastes very strong, I didn't find that to be the case at all. Sweet and creamy tripel. Paired incredibly well with spicy food.","sobapan","Aug 14, 2014"

The smell is quite yeasty at least that is the first thing I notice. Behind that there is a bit of banana maybe some lemon or citrus and finally some bready/wheaty malt. This beer starts out quite sweet, the malt comes through but it doesn't seem much more than a single dimension. There is some bitterness but just a touch and some peppery spiciness but again everything seems kind of muted and like it needs more. Some of the alcohol comes through in this one which I maybe expected for the style but that tied with the sweetness reducing the mouthfeel a bit for me. Overall I'd have to say that this is just so so maybe a nice attempt but I would have expected better from this brewer.","fank2788","Aug 09, 2014"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This American Belgian pours a luminous clear golden with thick white head that dissipates to thin white bubbles and light lacing. Smell of light fruit, apple, lemon, fresh bread, and sweet Belgian candy sugar. Taste is velvety smooth with tastes of crisp apple, lemon zest, Belgian yeast, a hint of clove, and loads of Belgian candy sugar. Warming and boozy up front and on the sides, sweetness on the aftertaste and throughout with a light white pepper coming through---not overpowering though. SOLID Belgian brewed in an American style. While the notes of this brew from the bottle are somewhat favorable I would challenge naysayers to try it on growler at cellar temperatures. I currently have this in the fridge in bottle form, but wanted to try it on growler before giving a review since I have had it before and loved the growler so much more for it's depth of character.","Brutaltruth","Jul 13, 2014"

The smell is yeasty, spicy and has fruit overtones of banana and lemon. Very nice. The taste follows suit, though as it warmed there was a little bit of a metalic bitterness, otherwise pleasant. The mouthfeel is a highlight, creamy with a spicy tingle that draws you to the next sip. For a 9.0 ABV brew this one did not show it's hand until I had finished the glass (happily). Victory has crafted a fine tripel that hits on most of the style points to make this one a winner.","SFNC","Apr 26, 2014"

4.2,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/16/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy pale golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, cracker, candi sugar, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, cracker, candi sugar, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, clove, bread, cracker, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome tripel style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/eartly yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 30, 2014"

Minimal head, nice mouthfeel with a delightful aftertaste of light hops. I definitely taste the spices it advertises but i'm not going to lie, I can only say what I think I taste and thats basil. Hint of citrus after you have sipped it a bit. The monkey has a whopping 9.5 APV and gives a nice warm buzz, only drink a couple if you don't want to be hammered. Shame on you monkey! You should be spanked! If your new to this beer, drink slightly chilled. I prefer it room temp.","ChiChi","Feb 22, 2014"

You'd be hard pressed to convince me that this one isn't an extremely smooth, delicious, and very drinkable triple that hides it's 9.5% abv like a champ.

Smell is what I would expect with bananas and cloves from the yeast. It smells pretty sweet which is nice but I'm not getting anything from the malt bill. Perhaps the sweetness is from a little malt but I would guess some Belgian candy sugar. Taste somewhat like I would expect from the style with what I sensed from the nose but I am getting an off flavor that I assume is coming from some hops that are a little too strong for the style although they are quite muted. I just really don't expect any hop bill that I can taste in a triple. Mouthfeel is right on for the style -- it's slightly thick but not anything over the top. Overall this is a decent try at a triple but I guess the hops through me off a little. It's not a bad beer but it's a little of for the style.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 26, 2013"

The beer looks good in a glass and has a pretty good head on it. Comparing it to the Belgian style beers I have had, it lacks in taste. The main interest of this brew seems to be high alcohol content as opposed to an excellent taste. The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for me, but I beer is the only carbonated beverage I drink so this might be something to which I am especially sensitive. Overall, this beer is decent, but I will certainly pick up something else the next time I visit the liquor store.","Snowman95","Nov 11, 2013"

This is a perfect 12-pack mix for my money (HopDevil, Headwaters, Prima and Golden Monkey) and I keep going back to the well, so Victory is clearly doing something right. But I'm not sure I would buy this beer by itself, especially in quantity. It's a good alternative to Victory's heavy hand with hops in the other three. But I wish the booze was less pronounced in this otherwise very nice Tripel. The spice notes are stronger than in traditional Tripels, but I like this flavor profile, which is reflected in my well-above-average rating.","VictorWisc","Jun 14, 2013"

Recedes slowly leaving behind lots of clinging lace.This tripel is down to brass tacks with a sweet yeast nose, sweet fruit, banana and some floral and spice from the understated hops. A little alcohol as well. On the nose it lacks brightness and elan. Malt is subtle and doesn’t over contribute leaving an earthiness underneath. On the palate it’s smooth and buttery but leaves a touch bitter and with more of an alcohol taste than there really should be. It’s a good strong tripel but it felt like it was lacking in refinement and luster.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

4.37,18.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"O- This was one of the beers that led to my fascination with Belgians around the time I turned 21. I remember revisiting it a couple years ago after having had some more refined and revered tripels and saying "Why did I like this so much? It's nothing compared to other better tripels." However, now that I sit down and examine the details, I realize that the reason this beer is so good and so popular is because it really hides the alcohol in a way that many other Belgians (American or Belgian-made) don't while still containing all the great characteristics of the style. It's not on my top ten list, but it deserves all the credit it gets IMO.","Immortale25","Dec 14, 2012"

There is entirely too much dryness present in this beer and it is missing so much of the depth of flavor that one would find in a Belgian import. Still, this will do in a pinch!

3.43,-7.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but has a mild smell.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 31, 2012"

The Belgian yeast funk is more bubble gum and banana (as opposed to yesterdays socks and a sweaty t-shirt). It also has plenty of carbonation, but again, not too much.

Light fruit, Belgian spicing and a bit of a hop bite. Nicely balanced. A pleasant low-key tripel. Nothing exciting, but calmly well done. Worth a repeat visit.","LiquidAmber","Aug 06, 2012"

2.83,-23.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Although I am a big fan of Belgian-style tripels, this beer always seems like a bit of a mess to me. I get a hint of tripel in the smell, but it is washed out by the hops. Similarly, the taste hints at the tripel spiciness I am looking for, without ever really delivering on the promise. I honestly think labeling the beer a tripel works against it. It is more accurately a big, high-abv American experiment: part tripel, part IPA, part Frankenstein. While I do not think it is a good example of the style, the flavors might work for drinker looking for more hops than is typical in a tripel.","casualfan","Jun 01, 2012"

She was way off but this is a great tasting beer light but with a kick. It is perfect for drifting off into oblivion on a hot summer day after a long bike ride or a round of golf. Taste fruity and finishes smooth. Good malt taste at 9+abv. You would expect an alcohol taste yet it is masked quite well. Cheers.","AFHOPHEAD","Apr 24, 2012"

Banana and earthy spicy aroma are dominant with biscuity malt and yeast beneath. Medium bodied with rich, aggressive, tangy carbonation. Spicy flavors up front that last throughout. Sweet fruit and banana flavors in the background at the beginning that slowly grow to the end. Yeast and light biscuit malt backbone throughout. Banana flavors intensify a this warms as well as the higher booze content. Enjoyed this immensely. Glad that Victory is a local brewery.","IronLover","Apr 24, 2012"

This time i can drink it, either because its had a few months to age or because i've had a few more months experience in tasting beers. Who knows, maybe a few more months will make it a better tasting beer.","littlelorib","Feb 18, 2012"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet, best by date of Oct 2014. This pours a light golden color with a smaller white head. The smells are of belgian yeast esters, bananna, clove, spices, pepper and sweet malts. The feel is medium and high carbonation. The taste is pretty good, a little pepper and spices, some alcohol burn and a nice dry after flavor, not the best triple but great for the price.","DavidST","Jan 16, 2012"

Good value and easy to drink (maybe TOO easy). The flavors in this one are surprisingly muted, which makes it even more surprising that the alcohol doesn't stand out more. My impression regarding flavor is that there seemed to be inexplicable gaps in it -- like something else was supposed to be there but wasn't. This wasn't bad but I would like more out of a beer that has this kind of an ABV. I probably won't buy another.","paulginva","Dec 04, 2011"

3.15,-14.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Victory Golden Monkey Triple: The Belgian Triple style is so different, it’s almost not beer, but makes for a great dessert! So how does Victory Brewing offering fare? It has a rich golden color in the glass, is appropriately translucent, and has a thin off-white head. The aroma is right in there for a triple: yeasty, fruity and sweet. The flavor starts out as a wonderful triple: complex, sweet and yeasty bready. But the finish, which should be the climax of a good triple falls a bit short, even some bitter comes through. Worth a try, but there are better triples out there.","iSip","Oct 31, 2011"

The aromas mimic some qualities of traditional Belgian made Tripels but this is certainly anything but textbook to the style. Spicy yeast, candi sugar, sweet light malts and touches of alcohol fill the nose. The taste is similar but the booziness seems to be more pronounced. More spice, yeast, banana and hints of green apple. It feels overly bubbly, maybe a bit less would give it a creamier mouth.

3.58,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Bottle conditioning resulted in billowing white head first pour, a bit more controlled on second glass over medium gold body, the etched bottom of chalice resulted in constant stream of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Not much going on in the nose, might have been poured a bit too cold, picked up good dose of coriander once warmed, floral hops. Taste started off pretty innocuous, coriander forward, faint bit of orange peel after warming but not very much Mouthfeel just on the light side of medium, good effervescence.

Mouthfeel was crisp for a tripel, not bready like other examples. The abv was hidden on the palate, but it sure caught up quickly. Very noticeable after half a glass.

However, I find it an exquisite American take on the Belgian Tripel, as it possesses wonderful spice with earthy yeast in the nose without being overpoweringly sugary/ syrupy afterwards. Yeah, the alcohol is very evident, but the combo is like blasting a power chord through a Marshall stack--it's a good thing. This beer is defiantly drinkable, too, which is dangerous. Very refreshing and satisfying.","Kuromaru","Aug 02, 2011"

High lemon citrus on the nose nice spice on the fall back, with fresh scents of apples, pears, and grapes. Spicy lemon taste with hints of fruit also coming out, lemons, oranges, grapefruits, some alcohol, lots of bittering hops to close on the finish. The feel is light, crisp, smooth, warm on the tongue and bitter.

2.98,-19.5,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Overall I would say this is a pretty average Tripel. At first this beer seemed like a pretty spot on attempt at a Tripel but it fell apart when it came to the flavor, it was just a little watery and not flavorful enough. The only flavor that turned out to be bold was the spices and that made for a pretty unbalanced flavor that had too many spices. The price point was good but the more expensive Tripels are much better so I guess you get what you pay for, but it did go down pretty smooth and easy, it just didn't impress me. I don't think I would buy this again, for the same price I can get Final Absolution from Dragonmead and I think that is much better. If you really like Tripels give this one a try but I don't think it will blow anybody's mind. Most of the Victory beers I have tried have been pretty good but it seems like the last two I have had have been lack luster but there is still a couple more of their brews I want to try.

The taste is just like this with a spicy peppery clove/banana/corriander mixing in with the Belgian yeast which also gives off those same flavors so you get double that flavor. There is some sweetness from the malt and it took me off guard with its creamy mouthfeel. The surprising body of this beer is one of my favorite things about it. You get the hops in the back with the citrus and some bitterness as well. I like that I can actually taste the hops in this unlike some other Belgian beers.

The cryptic dating that victory offers perplexes me, sure the label says best by Dec. 1 2013 but that doesnt tell me anything regarding how old/young this offering is. I would love to have it again with a side by side comparison of a young brew verse one with 3 years or so on it. Give it a try, overall it's not bad.

The beer is very sweet in mouth, and the spices help to balance that flavor. The coriander is still present, but subdued under the sweet flavors of banana bread. Very smooth and creamy in mouth, yet the aftertaste is extremely abrupt. Only the slightest hint of coriander lingers in the aftertaste, and not for long at all.

That's not a word but I'm finishing this growler right now, the carbonation I think hides the alcohol well. Also do smell a light Banana flavor, maybe that's where it gets it's name from.

The flavor is a pleasant balance of mild maltiness and slight hops, and it finishes with just a touch of hop bitterness that's nice. This is a beer that develops more character as it warms in the glass as well. It's not as spicy as other examples of this beer, and suffers just a touch from the lack.

Same thing on the flavor, nothing off, just boozy. MF is a bit prickly and light--the carbonation is sharp, not creamy. Decent drink, made a bit harder by the apparent alcohol.

Seems to have a balanced smell between the hops and malts. There's the fruity malts at first, like apples maybe a little peach. The alcohol is present as well. More so as the beer warms. Then you get the sorta citrus/floral notes in the background. The citrus notes are more along the lines or oranges rather than grapefruits. The nose finishes clean. Has a some what grainy earthy taste up front but then gets into the sweet fruit flavors like apple. Then your hit with the citric hops. Still along the lines of an orange flavor. It ends with a bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while. It has a medium body, smooth and carbonated. There's a little more carbonation then I would like. With a little less carbonation I think it would smooth out the body a little more making for a creamier mouthfeel. All in all this beer is ok. Dont think i could drink more than a couple of these. Not a very good representation of the style but not a bad beer. I could see myself buying this beer again although not a six pack. If i see singles then maybe.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes. The beer pours with a good sized white foam head. It has a clear, tarnish gold liquid body. Rising carbonation is visible. A musty yeast Belgian yeast aroma emanates from my glass. It's a little sweet and a little sour (although that may just be the yeast playing tricks on my nose). The flavor is initially sweet and malty. It ends with some alcohol and a dry finish that is a bit peppery. These flavors linger on. There is the taste of orange peel through out each sip. Lots fo carbonation can be felt. It has a heavy body and a non-sticky coat. The beer is strong but drinkable. Personally, I wouldn't have more than a bottle or two at a time. Luckily, the six pack you purchase can be aged for a while; there's no pressure to drink it all quickly.","ToasterChef","Aug 18, 2010"

It's a little too much. A little too assertive, a little too boozy. A really nice effort, but when its compared to some of the great interpretations of foreign styles Victory does--it's fantastic take on a German Pilsner (Prima), it's great version of a Barlywine (Old Horizontal), even it's strict-interpretation of a Baltic Porter--it's hard not to wish that the guys had tried to do a little less with this one.","bigeyedfish","Jul 31, 2010"

Thought maybe I banged it around a bit on the way home but the other varieties in the sampler pack didn't do this and 24 hours later the Golden Monkey still did, I don't know. The strange part is it really doesn't seem overcarbonated, anyway moving on. Scent is spicey and yeasty but a little underwhelming. Taste is definitely Belgian inspired but not quite Belgian. Floral hoppiness up front with some spiceness in the finish that becomes more potent as it warms. Alcohol is well hidden, I was actually shocked when I looked at the label and saw 9.5%. That being said it's pretty easy for the booze to sneak up on you, which takes away a bit from an otherwise very drinkable brew.

As soon as it hits the tongue I can detect some sort of off-taste. I can't really put a finger on it, maybe it's those exotic spices from the East. Definitely lots of banana. Caramel sweetness, white pepper, yeast. Alcohol is definitely there and warm going down the throat. I truthfully do enjoy the sweetness of the taste a little, but it seems messy and one-dimensional. Someone in another review said banana creme brulee, I'll agree with that. Mouthfeel is a too carbonated and boozy, has a decent creaminess. Drinkability suffers from that and the sweetness, I am pretty tolerable when it comes to sweetness in a beer so I didn't mind this too much but I know this would be a turn-off for others.

I poured it into a pint glass. A pretty good head. I was quite dark in the bar so i can"t really describe the color. The smell was bananas strait up bananas!. The Taste was not! it was very bitter, too bitter, way too bitter. I told my girlfriend it was like eating a pound of bananas and swiging orange peel flavored Mr. Boston charcoal filtered vodka. Then puking that all up and the after-taste left in my mouth would have been Golden Monkey. I wanted to buy some Golden Monkey and give it to my friends and pretend it was a quintessential item to my existence. Then see the look on there faces as they coughed up some pure banana bile. I was purely disappointed because that was the only beer in that news paper article the seemed to be intriguing to me. You live and learn.

There's plenty of spicing, a touch of hops and a strong malt backbone. The malt isn't nearly as sticky as I expected from the relatively high 9.5% abv.

This is not a by-the-book tripel, the guys from Victory are trying to throw as much at you as possible. It is sweet and very syrupy despite the thin appearance. Has kind of a honey texture or smoothness behind it, and you can tell it tastes a bit nutty. As it warms, there's a good bit of sharp spicing that becomes more and more prevalent. A bit earthy, a bit cough syrupy, and a huge alcoholic bite. It's pretty boozey, and can make for a tough drink. There's a ton of flavours, but they don't always do the best job of melding all together. It is pretty crisp though, carbonation is a little on the low side but it fits pretty well.

The finish is very confusing as there are myriad flavors swirling around and seemingly intertwining with components of the mouthfeel. Some probably hail the beer as "complex" and I just can't help but feel it is too busy. Most brewers I prefer the bigger and bolder offerings, but as for Victory I do recall being a fan of the Hop devil and Victory pils which means they go completely against the grain for me.

The flavors were equally complex, starting with citrusy hops it then went into spices, lots of fruity esters, the 'twang' of yeast, sour green apples, pears, caramel malt and towards the end it got a little nippy with a clear alcohol note that left a slick on my tongue.

While drinking this beer a huge carbonation bite hints your tongue, but a quite smooth estery flavour comes through; however, there is a bit of alcohol warmth coming through at the end, which is to be expected. While lingering around in my mouth, I get a lot of a fruity flavours; oranges and almost an apricot flavour are the most prevalent.

This Belgian-style spiced Tripel ale is yellowish rather than golden as the name implies. Cloudy from the sediment, this unfiltered brew is modestly appealing to the eye. The nose is very assertive, drawing your attention and anticipation. This is a complex ale, with a wave of gustatory impressions parading across your palate as you slowly draw it in, which is the only way to drink such a robust brew. For a tripel, the mouthfeel is a bit thin, but bites a bit from the carbonation. The sweetness and spice follow all the way to the finish, but graciously step aside to leave a nice bitter after.

These carry over to the taste, citrusy orange, lemon zest, wheat, and some sweet maltyness that is present in the back of your throat. Mouth ahs a lot of carbonation and a light to moderate body. A crisp bite and the flavor sets in as it moves over your tongue leaving a faint, sweet aftertaste. It definitely excited all of your taste buds. Pours an amber-yellow with a thin frothy white head.

The alcohol could also be detected easily by the nose, which is no surprise since this tripel boasts a sturdy 9.5% abv. Crisp mouthfeel but nothing out of the ordinary.

The smell was pleasant: plenty of sweetness, with orange, honey, maybe even some berries in there, plus yeast, spice, bready notes, and a touch of light hops. I was excited to give it a try, but the taste dissapointed. There was the usual cast of character: the yeast, orange peel, banana, pale malts. But the tastes that I took away from the beer were the alcohol and the sweetness. The beer did not do a good job of masking the alcohol, making it as the dominant flavor, leaving a dry, metallic aftertaste in my mouth with each sip. If anything, they tried to mask it with sugary and fruity flavors, but the beer just came off as syrupy, especially with its pseudo-thick mouthfeel. I usually enjoy triples, and I think that there are plenty of better examples of this beer out there.","micahgoldfus","Jul 22, 2008"

Taste = pear, light caramel, light citrus, butterscotch, and pudgent spice. As you let the beer sit in your mouth you can feel and taste the alcohol warm the sides of you gums.

It pours a very thick, syrupy, cloudy, orangy yellow, with decent carbonation, some head that retains around the edges. The aroma is the high point. There is a very nice sweet malty, almost bubblegum quality, banana and clove aroma. The smell is quite pungent and is indicative of things to come. The taste of the beer is compromised by the strong alcohol content, too strong in fact, and it gets in the way of the flavors. There is a decided rum soaked banana and pineapple taste, there is clove and other tart spices, there is also a tad bit of lemony tart citrus in the beer too. The finish is very acerbic and it leaves a mouthfeel as though the alcohol content in the beer is sucking the saliva out of the glands. The beer is medium to full bodied and quite syrupy. The mouthfeel is the low point. This is a sipping beer, way too strong, with the warming alcohol notes, surpassed by the strong alcohol that causes problems in the mouthfeel, finish, and aftertaste.","albern","Jun 13, 2008"

Taste is very malty at first, then the citrus fruits come on, ending in a pepppery and nutty finish. Very smooth & well blended together but fairly single-dimensional. Afterwards you notice the alcohol & a lingering pepper and candy element. The mouthfeel is silky but a touch cloying. The drinkability is probably the monkey's strongpoint. It masks the alcohol well & if you can get past the predominant pepper, you've got a heck of an afternoon or evening in front of you.

The spiciness hits first, then it smooths over the tongue with some caramel and the citric flavors kick in, like orange, and then there is a peppery backbite. To be honest, after the first sip I thought that maybe the bartender gave me the hefe beer next to this, but I checked the bottle to make sure. Not too much malt, but it did have a little breadiness to it (I think). I don't know, I thought this beer tasted real good and I'd have another (I wouldn't session it). People who have had it told me it isn't that good, but I disagree. I don't know, I'd say give it a shot and let your taste buds form their own opinion.

The hops are not really percievable but they balance the beer nicely. Mouthfeel is medium in body and has a light mouthburning carbonation and a dry alcohol finish.

The alcohol content can be noticed, but it is mostly well rounded into the flavors. There was no sweetness to this beer at all, which was unique but left me hanging a bit. A sharp wild yeast bite to it in the aftertaste quickly followed by a lingering sourness & bitterness that didn't play too well together, but probably helped to hide the alcohol bite.

The flavor may not be rich and complex, but i really like it's basic profile; not too sweet and not as bitter or alcoholic as others of the style.

At $8.50 per six pack (at my local liquor store), that brings the price down to about $1.42 per 12 oz bottle. Now add that all up. A delicious Belgian tripel at 9.5% for $1.42 per 12 oz bottle?

That said, Golden Monkey is still a good brew - it tastes pretty good and goes down smooth, but when compared to others in the same style, it falls short. Really short. It is worth sampling for the experience, and I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me, but I doubt that I will ever buy it again.","MiguelMandingo","Jul 10, 2007"

It's a golden beer with absolutely no head. Smells like sweet alcohol at first. A second smell gives it a fruitier almost grassy smell which is pretty good. The taste is quite similar to the smell, if perhaps more grassy. Not bad, just not all the hype I've heard about it. It has a nice full body and a hint of alcohol warmth, which is probably the nicest feature of this beer.

Mouthfeel is luxurious and crisp at once.

The smell was apparent as soon as I opened the bottle and the poor brought out all the spice and sweetness. The nose was filled with sweet; like honeysuckle, slight spice, alcohol, and hop notes. Taste was impressive, not aggressive like most tripels. This is sweeter than most and well balanced with (again) honeysuckle, spices (that I can't describe), alcohol is very present but not overwhelming.

The smell is a bit metallic, Belgian yeast, tropical fruit, not as pronounced as most tripels. The brew makes up for the lack of smell with its taste. It is a solid tripel but not as complex as those from Belgium. The taste is of the Belgian candi sugar, clove, a bit of corriander, and a light light hop finish. The feel is a bit too crisp for a tripel, well carbonated, and a tad boozy. Overall, a decent American tripel.

Taste is solid as well; lots of molasses, brown sugar, some spices as well, and a little bit of fruitiness too. Feel is full and tasty, quite good overall. Not a bad beer; it's kind of a stereotypical tripel, embodying a lot of the characteristics I imagine in the style.

There is a mild pale malt flavor in the mouth with the nice sour tone. Certainly seems to be a decent Belgium style offering. At 9.5% abv I was surprised how hidden the alcohol was.

Plenty of yeast particles suspended, crowding the body, leaving it clouded. A golden apple colour. A light, bready malt aroma. I get some over ripened fruit - pear, apple - some lightly floral hops. Lightly spicy! A nice, soft touch of malt on the aftertaste. I taste both standard German malts and the Belgian yeast. Some sweetness. Body is well rounded, seems a little compromised though. I could use more spice in the taste. Some faint alcohol as it goes down. A little too neutral/dull for my taste. This was good, but it wasn't exactly like other tripels.","biegaman","Nov 19, 2006"

Taste starts sweet, but soon turns quite herbal and some nice spiciness. Mouthfeel is pretty good, enough carbonation but I could have probably done well with slightly less. Drinkability was docked a point because the taste was a bit harsh near the middle. Some alcohol quite noticable in the taste as well as effect. I may go for this if no other belgian is around, but only if it's on special. It's probably not worth what most places ask for it.

A sip starts with a strong, tart combination of citrussy orange peel and spices. Candi sugar and bready malt flavors provide an excellent base here and work hard to subdue the powerful peppery spice. Midsip everything comes together to provide a complex, layered taste. Finish provides a strong coriander flavor than is accompanied by a tiny hint of alcohol.

First impression was the scent: fruity but I couldn't quite nail it down until about halfway through the pint, when I concluded that I was smelling (and tasting) bananas and cloves. . . . As for taste: yeasty and fruity, with the banana and clove tastes predominating but followed by a definite alcohol burn. I didn't know this was a 9.5% ABV when I ordered it, but I realized it packed a kick as I drank it (especially as I had 20 oz to go). . . . It reminded me of a stronger version of Wit, a Belgian-style craft beer brand that I used to come across about 10-12 years ago at beer festivals. . . . The battle in my mouth was between the fruity banana and alcohol burn, with the fruit winning most of the time. . . . Personally I didn't find it tremendously drinkable as the alcohol and banana tastes were somewhat overwhelming, especially as I worked my way down the Imperial Pint.

Sweet pale malt flavor, with a good phenolic tartness a slight apple ester. The aftertaste is dry with floral hops and a very spicy alcoholic bite. Good example of style, except the bitterness/phenols are low for the very sweet and boozy flavor produced by the fusels and ester.

Normally, Tripels can be a bit much to swallow with lighter fruit only slightly masking the alcohol taste (unlike Dubbels and Quadrupels using dark fruits). This beer has the flavor profile of a Belgian Pale Ale with the texture of a Trappist ale. The rich fruits used simply add to the aftertaste in terms of sweetness and bitterness.

Citrus at the mid and it finishes with a touch of coriander and lingering malt. Definite alcohol warmth in the finish too, along with a little phenolic character.

3.84,3.8,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Cloudy yellowish orange with no head. Very urine-like in appearance. Smell is faint, but inviting. A bit of sugary sweetness with some phenolic character lets you know this is a Belgian style beer. Also some toffee which doesn't show up in the taste. The taste is a well merged blend of peppery spiciness, sugary sweetness, and some yeasty breadiness. If one aspect dominates, it's definitely the spices though. Finishes a bit dry with barely perceptible alcohol and lingering sweetness. Hardly any bitterness here at all. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, but a tad grainy - the spiciness doesn't help. Definitely not bad, but it takes a lot for a tripel to impress me these days, and this doesn't live up to some of the better examples of the style.","PatYoda","Oct 08, 2005"

Aroma is malts and spices, as expected for the style, but with a bit of a sour undercurrent. Taste starts with pale malt sweetness, sliding into some spicing (but not too much), and then a slight alcohol warming to close. Mouthfeel is pretty good, although nearing the cloyingly sweet line, and drinkability follows the same road.","ppoitras","Oct 06, 2005"

The huge alcohol rush overpowers everything and stings the mouth like a bad malt liquor. The spiciness of the alcohol and cloves, make this seem unbalanced. To be honest, I don't think this is necessarily a bad beer, but for a tripel, I think it is a joke.

Nice crispness in the mouthfeel from the carbonation gives just the right amount of bite to each sip. I do not detect any hint of the 9.5% ABV in the taste. As I should have expected the beer is getting much better as it warms up and I write this review--numbers have gone up a few times. Drinkability is good.

Taste is mainly of cloves (spice), which was nice, along with the grape flavor and a slight hoppy finish. The alcohol comes through on flavor at the end as well with a nice drying effect.

Taste is also yeasty with a nice touch of hops and some spices. The only way to describe the taste is "rich." It's very sugary, but the aftertaste is pleasant and leaves some lingering orange flavors which I prefer to the actual taste of the beer. The mouthfeel is creamy. For its ABV, this is a pretty drinkable beer, as it's not really all that boozy. For me, though, it's just not as good as the rest of Victory's offerings. I wish they would pull this one out of the Variety of Victories sampler case and replace it with one of their other brews. Not terrible, but I won't be seeking it out anytime soon.","whartontallboy","Feb 25, 2005"

Not this one, it was crisp and clear looking. Very nice. Nice Belgian yeast and hops, although not too many hops. Or were they over powered by the pure amount of Belgian Candi added?

The nose offers up essences of honeyed oranges and malted milk chocolate augmented with a malty-nuttiness-absolutly delicious! The yeast is fresh, young and clean on the nose. There is a pleasantly complex citric element to the taste, akin to key limes, but not overstated, definitely subdued as this acidic element makes this brew crisp, bright, and refreshing. The after taste lasts easily for several minutes! For a brew with some weight and character, it is quite drinkable en-mass. Never noticeable, the alcohol is buried well beneath the massive flavors imbedded well within this brew. The mouth feel is a tad lean for the style, but this is by no means a criticism whatsoever, as this is the only thing that I could find even remotely debatable.

Taste was immediately candy-sweet and cloves and pepper spicy but was followed by a wollop of tangy fruits like green apples and bananas that almost left me forgetting the initial tastes. By the time I swallowed this beer, I was left with a Riesling-like after taste... very cool. It's medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation, with bubbles that blanket your tongue, really accentuating the spicy flavors I mentioned earlier. As the beer warmed, more and more esthery scents were released and if I took a deep enough inhale, I could really detect the alcohol. It seems very drinkable at first but towards the end of the glass, you really start feeling warm and fuzzy (I make it sound like a bad thing) so I'm not sure if I'd go for number two but for enjoying one, it's wonderful.

Granted, sometimes you find yourself concentrating to discern just what it is you're tasting, but once you get out of "review mode," you can sit back and easily enjoy what it has to offer. Noticeably absent was overt evidence of the muscular ABV, so it bears watching, because it can and will reach out its paws and grip you firmly.

It seems quite yeasty not unlike an apple pie crust and with a deep malt profile (fresh harvest oranges, pears, bananas, melon bubblegum), honeyish and spicy (ginger mostly). There is a restrained alcohol suggestion in the back as well. The first sip surprises by the lively carbonation which is very tongue-cleaning and complements the banana/honey/yeasty palate interestingly to my liking.

Poured out a nice golden/orange color with a bit of carbonation in it. Smell was mostly sweet. Some malts, grapes, and some spice in there. Taste was pretty much the same. It's like a one-two punch of sweet and spicy. Candy-like sweetness hits first then fades away to a spicy/tart flavors. Some hops can be detected as well. Not a bad beer, maybe just a little bit more balancing may be in order for this to be "out of this world."","necoadam","Apr 12, 2004"

Maybe a slight off smell like a hint of vinegar. First sip reveals a lighter bodied drink and less alcohol presence. Drinkability is high more like a refreshing summer drink. I had to check that this actually lists 9.5% ABV on the label. Pretty well hidden. Slight peppery taste. Slight metallic aftertaste. I'm getting a flavor like a watered down version of a good tripel.

Hardly a few sips had passed before the head was nothing but film and collar. Tsk, tsk. The nose is lovely, however, with fruits and spices leaning towards sweet. The mouth is very carbonated and heavy with the spice and alcohol. The taste is sweet - apricots and raisins - and spicey - coriander and a touch of, well, vanilla? There's a very subtle touch of hops in the finish, but this is all about the fruit and spice, plus the alcohol. Not my favorite beer, but it's quite tasty.","Globetrotter","Apr 03, 2004"

The monkey poured cloudy and appeared to have a honey color. The head built quickly but also faded quickly. It was easy enough to stir more foam by swirling the glass.

You get the sweet which gives way to the sour and finishes off with an alcoholic aftertaste that isn't bad at all.

The strong, alcoholic smell is deceiving compared to the sweet and yeasty taste. This beer has everything Belgium has to offer and more; only the greatest trappists can top this brew.

I remember trying this in the past and being a little unimpressed..it seemed a bit "all over the place". Not this time. Taste is quite good with apples, oranges, grapes detected in the the taste. A bit sweeter than most triples, but the carbonation helps balance this a bit, but not quite enough..this beer after a few sips tends to be a bit too sweet.

Now to preface, this was my first tripel and I may not have the right idea of what one should be, but I will review the beer as a beer, and not as an interpretation of a style. The color is not surprisingly, a bright yellow/golden that is topped by a head of white lace. First smell is of faint alcohol, and fruit. The taste is interesting. There is a certain bit of malt to it, and flavors of clove and light citrus with banana as the most prevalent fruit. The finish is dry and alcoholic, spicy and almost sour. Now, I keep mentioning the alcohol content, but while drinking this it never detracted from the beer. It is very well masked behind a well structured arrangement of sweetness and spice (and everything nice, ha ha).

The monkey pours a nice golden color with a head the flairs up for a few seconds but descends to nothing but a ring around the color lace. The smell is of a carnival full of funnel cake sugar and cotton candy downright sweet to the nostrils and will bring you right back to your childhood of riding unsafe rides at the county fair. The initial taste surprisingly is not sweet but more of a dry pepper then that where that ends and it takes you on the roller coaster of sickeningly sweet, which by the way isnt a bad thing to me, malts and slight hint of honey on bread. This beer more so then any other reminds me of my childhood of going to the fair and eating crap foods and thus is overly drinkable and will remind you of your job in morning when you walk in there with a head split and kidneys of stone.

Disappointing in its lack of complexity. My goodness the alcohol bite on the palate is harsh (!) nicely spicy, peppery somewhat tart and fruity, lemon & pear mainly the hops bitterness is moderate at best, plenty malty, the finish is dry. Medium-light body and ideally high carbonation produces a near perfect mouthfeel for the style. The alcohol is warming, limited mass consumption (in theory, it is damn easy to drink).

This was a great time and how I'm sure the guys at Victory intended it to be. Hazy gold color with a large white head that eventually diminishes into nothing. Aroma is spicy with what seems like a bananna flavor I usally don't associate with the style, but is welcomed here anyway. There are so many tastes in this beer, but overall it is quite spicy in character with some alcohol. A very very complex beer. A little too wild for a tripel in my opinion.","dmarch","Jul 05, 2003"

Kind of exotic but not nearly enough of it. The flavor is a bit one-sided, not really pushing my tongue around at all. I think perhaps the big nature of this beer with all its alcohol and fruity, malty sweetness demands a bit more of a peppery, hoppy kick at the end. It's there, but it could be bigger. Regardless, it's very delightful, and it's size makes up for its lack of complexity. Highly drinkable despite the big 9.5%. Pretty damn good.","marburg","Jul 01, 2003"

The golden hue is slightly cloudy giving the appearance of great substance. The clovish flavor immediately gives you a sweet spice sense while the thin ivory-colored head dissipates and leaves minimal amounts of lace. The nose is light, but gives off hints of its malt base along with bits of fruit and spiciness. Very smooth and rich body leaves a nice full mouthfeel to cap the experience.

Very alcoholic nose with fruit esters, honey, and cloves contains a sharp sweetness that tickles the nose. Taste is spiced up quite a bit, very unique banana esters in the flavor. A syrupy mouthfeel with a very alcoholic finish, this in my opinion is one of the most unique offerings from Victory.

In nose and taste it seemd more rounded and flat than a typical sharp trippel, kinda like how a soda is sweet. A creamy taste, but a bit wheatier than normal, softly hopped, with a fairly thin mouthfeel. Is a good try at a class style, but does not match as well with the Westmalle standard.

There was a pretty apparent alcohol taste as well which I would have been ohk with had the flavor been more complex.

Despite pouring a hazy, golden color, it has little in common with the more typical golden Belgian Ales. Poured very little head, and what was there disappeared quickly. No lace whatsoever. The taste was initially a little overwhelming (particularly following the delicate tasting Hennepin). After a few sips, however, I began to warm up (literally!) to this beer. Malty, thick mouthfeel (for the style) spicy and fruity (pear?), but just not as lively as the best beers of the style. This being said, for a domestic brewer to make a Belgian styled beer this authentic and powerful is an impressive feat. If this beer were available to me, I certainly would buy it once in awhile.

4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It pours into the glass a peachy gold color. The head is white that seemed to stay for awhile. It left some residue but no real lace. The aroma was pretty complex. Fruits like oranges, cherries seemed to be present. Malt (yeasty, alittle) some spices hops (slight) and alcohol was present. The taste was good. It was rich full and again complex. It seemed to change as my hands warmed the glass. Temperature is a definite factor. First you notice the carbonation, then the flavors hit, the some cherries, oranges, dates, spices, malt (sweet) and the alcohol and a bit of hops. All these seem to jump around with the temperature. None of the flavors seemed to be too much. A very drinkable beer. I think this was as good as the monkey from the tap. Keeping some on had at all times.","Jarod","Dec 29, 2002"

3.78,2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Dark golden hue, w/ a slight haze. Moderately thick, white, well retained head leaves web like lace. Tart lemon and lime citrus and orange zest dominate the aroma, without much to back them up. Hint of spicy alcohol and trace clove. Cleanly spicy overall in aroma. Strong, almost acetic tartness hits the tongue at first, then mellows and tartness becomes akin to unripe orange and lime juice. Light curacao bitterness. Tartness partially wanes to allow residual sweetness to meld with the citric fruitness, lending an orange marmalade impression. The moderate hop bitterness accentuates the persistent tartness, lending an overall dry flavor profile. Lightly bodied. Crisp and light on the palate, and thus deceivingly quaffable. Finishes both sweet and tart, with ethanol warmth creeping up the throat. An enjoyable, albeit oddly tart pale strong. More residual sweetness and / or esters would have provided balance. Nevertheless quite tasty and dangerous.","marc77","Dec 24, 2002"

The beer pours with a nice head that produces a light lace and has a very attractive orange-yellow color.  The aromas seem to be constantly changing as the beer warms.  Most smells are sweet, as is the taste.  My initial taste produced almost emtirely alcohol.  While the beer was a little too cool, it tasted as though somehone had put a shot of Vodka in my beer.  As it warmed, the alcohol nose and taste diminished, but never completely disappeared.  Towards the end of the glass, the sweetness became very strong, almost overpowering.  I will let the other 5 age for a while before opening another, because it is a good beer that will probably mellow with some aging.","aaronh","Oct 05, 2002"

The aroma is quite full with a soft fruitiness, some orange, a sweet bready malt, a light spice and some alcohol. The body is medium with a very fine & effervescent carbonation that caresses the tongue and fills the mouth. The taste is rich and full, with candyish malt, spice - some coriander is noticeable, and finishing with a lingering spicy sweet malt. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. Very well balanced with just enough hop bitterness and spice flavor to keep the big sweet malt from getting out of hand. Not extremely complex, but big.

The taste was all over the place and I was unable to grasp anything.  The color and smell were fine, decent head.  I honestly couldn't wait to finish it because I was in my favorite beer bar and there were other beers waiting....

Complex aroma, promises of flavors to come.  Medium bodied mouthfeel, flavors of deep cherry, some dried dates, and an alcoholic warming of a brandy.  Very similar front to back, maybe could use more complexity, but the brew is assertive.  A pretty good match to Belgian Pales, with fewer sour notes than some.

Looks beautiful with a huge pillowy head, and is very smooth despite the 9.5 abv. Needs more oomph in the nose to back up its big-beer profile. Aroma is nice, citrusy, spicy, mildy hoppy and alcoholic, but more reminiscent of a Belgian Wit moreso than a Tripel. It's a smooth Tripel as well, which is a bit of an oxymoron. Where's that spicy carbonated bite? I don't know if I should complain or not on that front. One that is quite quaffable but could use some more "tough-guy" character.","IrishRedRock","Jul 12, 2002"

The alcoholic content is well hidden and is very drinkable which is scary. This brew is another example of Bill and Ron's desire for quality and responding to what the people want in a beer.

It smells a bit like a cross between a lemon and an orange with big chunks of clove stuck in it. The taste is also full of citrus and spicy sweetness. Although it is warming, I wouldn't have pegged it at 9.5% abv if I hadn't seen it on the bottle first. It's an interesting beer and not quite like anything I've tasted before.
