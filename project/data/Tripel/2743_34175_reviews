"Enjoyable Trippel from a great brewery.  Really enjoyed the beer in a 22oz to start the evening.  Reminded me of great Trippels in Belgium."
""
"Nice Foamy head, aromatic smell, fresh out of the tap, but very very sweet. Too sweet for my tastes."

"The first sip reveals fine rolling carbonation and an average body with sticky textures. The flavor is similar to nose with a sweet fruit hit of white grape and wine with some rock candy and sweetness. No booze or hops anywhere. Very approachable and complex tripel. A nice brew that I enjoy a lot and would definitely try again. A great example of the style that would even be good for newer folks to the style. Nothing over the top but well nuanced."
"Not a traditional tripel, sure, but a very tasty beer. Wouldn't prefer this to a Chimay or a St. Bernardus, but that's just me."
""
""
""
"This is a very good, but not world-class tripel. As far as American versions of this style go, however, this one does well. Alcohol warmth is a little exaggerated and the yeast is complex, but not particularly mind-blowing. It relies on the hoppy spices a little more than the yeast itself. Still a great attempt."

"But with its more focused and simplified taste, the beer's bright floral bouquet chases the session from start to close- making it ideal for those who find Belgian versions too winey, earthy, or spicy."
""
"Not sure what the talc like aroma came from but I really enjoyed the flavor."

"O: nice representation of a trippel but not 100% to style. Interesting."
"O - Enjoyable but I'm not a great judge for this style. Overall this is way too sweet and the banana and cinnamon flavors overwhelm the taste buds. As a hop head I'd love to see the sweetness balanced with more bitterness or at least tone down the cinnamon but like I said, this style isn't for me."

"Interesting Trippel. When West Coast hopheads and Belgian yeast collide, the New World Trippel is born."

"A solid classic tripel."

"Not the world's best tripel. But then again I'm not a huge fan of American/Belgians. As far as things go, it's alright."
"M&O: smoothly carbonated but still softly refreshing, this beer is not so… effervescent as in a well-carbonated Belgian Tripel; coming with a medium-ish body against a 9.7%abv. strength, however, it drinks exceptionally well and approachable. Not terribly well-attenuated overall to me, but overall it has shown a distinctive take on the style and well-crafted all in all."

"Overall – A rather nice drinking triple that starts out drier and gets sweeter and boozier but also smoother more toward the end. It is a rather nice brew overall and a nice one to try."

"Tart in the aftertaste with some apricot kernel bitterness. sort of a funky Belgian yeast flavor with the usual drying effect. Otherwise this is not vey beery. It's some sort of fruit-flavored malt beverage. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Olive Tree Market in Ocean Beach."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a mug. Pours a murky golden color with noticeable sediment and a smooth, creamy white head with very little lacing. Head recedes quickly but never disappears completely. Smell is of bananas and alcohol. Taste is more of the same. Bananas and other fruit in the foreground, alcohol is present but still masked well even with a 9.7 ABV. Only a slight spice taste. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth with below average carbonation. Overall this is a pretty good trippel, but not the best I've had. It could've used a bit more spiceyness that you find with other trippels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I liked it just a tad better on tap, but it's still excellent out of the bottle."
""
"O: One of the better American trippels I have had. Thankfully it doesn't have banana and bubblegum flavors."
""

"O-This tripel misses the mark. The taste was too heavy on the fruit, sugar and alcohol, and I missed that funky, grassy, spicy, earthy kick that a great tripel provides. On the other hand, my wife (who is a tripel-lover) loved it. I will give credit for a nice mouthfeel."

"Pours a slightly hazy dull orange with suspended fine sediment, one finger thick white colored foam that settles to a thin ring but leaves a thick sheet of lace for the first couple of inches. Smell: pale malt sweetness, fruity... nectarine, white grape juice, hopping is moderately spicy and lightly herbal and earthy. Taste: upfront it's spicy with the suggestion of lemon peel, then a blast of sugary pale malt, white grape, lots of soft apple. The yeast promotes the fruit flavors, but it's not exactly running wild. The feel is pillowy cut by syrupy...equals chewy. Medium-plus bodied, finishing sweet, sticky, and semi-dry. Enjoyable but I'm not likely to grab one again soon."
""
"O: I really liked this one. It goes down very easy for a nearly 10% ABV. A nice twist on a Trippel."
"Pales in comparison to the true Belgian examples of the style. This is average at best."
"O: I'd buy it again. A high percentage beer with extreme fruit flavor. Perfect for all those gals in your life. Great for movie and a beer night."
""

"OVERALL: While the hops are not the star of this show, they do make longer and more pronounced appearances than they do in other Belgian-style Trippels. This is clearly a New World version of the style and it is an excellent example of why a West Coast interpretation of any beer is worth trying. Have this one on the patio on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"Overall: kind of unidimensional. Tastes good and is highly drinkable, just not very interesting or complex."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours hazy orange gold with a tall white head that dissipates moderately quickly. There are plentiful tiny bubbles visible in the beer. The beer smells of apples, pears, spices, and malt. The taste is that of a classic tripel. The fruit and spice notes go well with the malt backbone. The hops do add some nice balance throughout the beer. The malt becomes more prominent as the beer continues to warm. The alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor, but I do taste some alcohol as the beer warms. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. This is very drinkable for such a strong beer. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"D/O: This tripel is loaded with obvious Belgian qualities, apparently trying to offer a literal lesson in abbey-style ale. Nuanced it is not, separating it from the best of its style. Such beers can be simultaneously delicate and spirituous, yet stand up to the most savory of foods. This beer does stand up, but so rigidly as to be awkward."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruits, yeast, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"As far as American Triples go, Green Flash Trippel is good and drinkable. However, there are other American Tripels I would reach for first."
"Nice carbonation with plenty of alcohol. A decent offering, but there are some better ones out there."
"I poured this a bit cold, all of the above were accentuated upon warming of the glass."
""
"Overall it's not bad at all, but won't change you from a hop head to a tripel lover anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good tripel. Definitely better examples out there but this one is worth a try if you see it."
""
""
"Overall, I want to finish this whole growler by myself, but that would be stupid. I'm glad my roommate is here to help with it!"
"(originally reviewed: 06-21-2011)"
""
""
"O-well I definitely wouldn't be classifying this as a tripel. It's not that great at all actually, as any style. Tastes like an amateur aged IPA. "
"O: Not my favorite offering from Green Flash nor the best tripel I've had but still quite satisfying. It's pretty bold, like many of their other beers, which I have to respect."
"Fruity aroma has a strong yeasty, slightly rubbery overtone and a hint of cinnamon. Pours a nice clear golden yellow with a thick and rather persistent ivory head. Flavor has mainly fruity and yeasty notes and - whoa! - a fairly strong alcohol nip. Finish has a hint of resin to it. Texture has OK body and a fair amount of fizz and life. Tasty and satisfying - keep an eye peeled for it."
"Overall really like this one, nice take on the style, and a great orange/tangerine juice taste and appeal for a tripel. Really like it."
"O - Such a well balanced and excellent beer. High ABV is well hidden, which is impressive for a 9.7% abv brew. Well done, will be buying this one again"
"Despite a few gripes listed above, I quite like this beer. It's not super crisp and complex like a true Belgian Tripel would be. It's something different. Be prepared for that and you should enjoy this one. This is exactly what a West Coast interpretation of a Tripel would taste like in my mind. The hops really add some complexity without taking too much away from the Belgian yeast and malt."
"Poured from a bomber into a chalice at cool temp. Liquor is medium amber, hazy although not a bottle-conditioned beer, effervescent, perhaps a tad darker than one might see in a typical trippel. Pours a large, loose, white head that remains a foamy presence, leaving light lacing. On the nose is dried apricot, mango, banana, and clove. Lots of fruit in the flavor, with apricot notes being dominant up front and banana toward the end, some spiciness, and a fairly sweet finish. The substantial alcohol is displayed as an underlying counterpoint. This is an above average beer, but sweet for the style, and the haziness is a bit puzzling."

"Overall--This beer just seems unfinished to me. On the bright side, it is pretty easy to drink, and has a very pleasant creaminess. However, there just doesn't seem to be a good balance of flavors; the punch of tartness and astringent alcohol overpower everything else in the taste. Also, the lack of pungent yeastiness is a big disappointment, as that's something I really look for in a good tripel. Though there's worse to be had, I can't say I'd recommend this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth body, nearly syrupy with a slight astringency, boozy fruit and earthy, prickly notes in the aftertaste. Slippery feel, some fruity brandy and apricot notes. Overall a slow sipper best shared."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very rich and coating mouthfeel. This is called a Trippel but it had a lot in common with a DIPA. There was the lush tropical fruits and the dry-hopping added a nice bitter touch. Well integrated and very good. Makes me think this is a new offering as the prior reviews weren't all that great."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I got this beer because I love Tripels and the quality of their IPAs is very good, so i took a bit of a chance. As some of the other reviews stated - we have a great value here for the money, but if it's in the budget there are better examples of the style."
""
""
"This is a very good trippel - one of my favorite styles. The abv is very well hidden here as well."
""
""
"O: Not necessarily the best American-made beer I've tried, but it's fairly well made and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- You might find better examples of the style but you will also pay a lot more. This is a great value and a good way to experience a well made domestic Tripel without shelling out big bucks."
"Pours a hazy golden orange hue which leaves a creamy dense two finger head and clingy lacing here and there,the smell is barley sugar,corriander,fennel and spicy hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and a touch creamy with tastes of sweet pastry,spicy hops,jarrah honey,dill,biscuty malts and finished with a spicy herbalness and overall its an easy enough Trippel to sink but i dont think id run out of my way to buy it again cheers."
""
""
"22 ounce bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of pepper, apricot, pear, banana, clove, biscuit, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Nice aromas with good balance. Taste of big pear, pepper, apricot, banana, clove, candi sugar, biscuit, spicy yeast, and some yeast tang. Lingering notes of biscuit, pear, apricot, pepper, and spicy yeast on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Decent balance of flavors with smooth drinking for 9.7%. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very solid American made Tripel. Definitely some better ones out there, but this is worth a try."
""
"I thought this beer okay. I think there is too much alcohol in the taste and I thought it lacks depth in flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a goblet, unknown freshness date. This pours an orangish color with a tall white head which quickly dissipates. The smells are a little fruity, some light hops, some banana and sweet malts. The feel is medium high carbonation. The taste is pretty good a little dry, some banana, malts, pepper and a slight hop bite."
""
""
""
"Taste is dry and crisp on the finish with a sweet and slightly boozytasty. Lots of Belgian candi sugar flavors, overall very good."
""
""
""
""
"O: Now this is a very old bottle so dont take this review compared to a new fresh bottle. I think this beer actually ages okay, but I still prefer this fresh."

"O – Good solid Trippel. Now that Green Flash is available in MO I will probably have this more often especially since my GF loves Belgians. It isn’t the best out there or the best available in my area but its very approachable and delicious. Very good job. (3.5)"
""

"A good, inexpensive, tasty tripel from just down the road. I will most definitely be having this again."

"O: This is a superb Trippel, one of the best examples of the style that I've had"
"The smell is a bit ""pine-sol"" like with a bit of a sharp ping in the nose. Floral, herbal and pine notes makes the beer inviting. The flavor matches with tame flavor on the front end the bouquets the a tropical and floral flavor. Hints of the mildest tangerine, rose and an accent of alcohol make this beer fairly light drinking. A light beer with a heavy ABV, watch out because though it's welcoming, it's still a Green Flash!"
"O: Considering the strength of this beer, the alcohol is remarkably well hidden from the taste. This and a lack of cloying sweetness makes this rather easy to drink compared to other tripels."
"D/O: Good carbonation and a nice balanced flavor that fits well with the style. Interesting interpretation of the style."
"overall, a bit of a disappointment. not terrible, some enjoyable characteristics about it, but i was expecting more. slightly above average tripel, but with so many options out there i won't be making an effort to grab more."
"Pours a beautiful cloudy amber color with very little head. Carbonation is clearly even through the cloudiness. The head was minimal but I could have been a little more aggressive on the pour. Fantastic color though. Nose is of floral hops and with notes of honey and bee pollen. With just a slight bitterness to it. Smells wonderful. In the taste I pick up some caramel and honey sweetness. Along with a little bitterness and some sour lemon zest for a little balance. Finish has some Belgium spice to it. Great mouth feel. Medium bodied and very smooth and clean. Carbonation is a little above medium but adds to the drinkability. Overall I dig this beer a lot. It's a bit pricey but worth it. Alcohol is surprisingly toned down considering is damn near 10%abv. This is my 3rd Green Flash beer and they have not let me down yet."
"Green Flash Trippel is a little bit better than the typical American brewed tripel, but not quite at the level of a typical Belgian one. If compared to beer in general, this is a solid drink that will loosen the tension in your body with its relatively sneaky 9.7% ABV."
"MO- This is my first Green Flash beer and Trippel is quickly becoming my favorite style, but I doubt very much I will be returning here. Too much booziness and not enough deep flavor."
"O: Overall, a good tripel. Not the best, but far from the worst. Maybe with some time the alcohol burn would fade a bit, which would make the beer better."
"All in all a decent tripel. Not the best American version and not as good as the Belgians but I like it and would have another."
"O Try it if you like Tripels, I have bought before, and would buy again."
"Alright, but not incredible. Green Flash's Trippel smells great, but the flavor is not nearly as complex as the aroma."
"D- Very drinkable, for a beer 9.7abv you cannot taste it at all. Great stuff."
"D: the brew was drinking damn good and was a solid tripel. I was very surprised with the green flash take on a belgian tripel."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drink- Wasn't too bad. Pretty tasty for the price point I have seen in stores. Was a welcome gift."
"Cheers."
"A very enjoyable tripel."
"D - This is a well made and enjoyable beer its a little too easy to drink with its good taste but I could sip on this for sometime worth getting your hands on sometime to try"
"A good american trippel, but the alcohol presense hurt the overall balance in this brew. IMO it could use more carbonation and perhaps some aging would help?"
"D: One bottle was enough. Bitterness got to me after a while."
"D - Therefore, the drinkability isn't very high either. This beer nails the smell and ABV of the Belgians, but doesn't have the complexity, balance or mouthfeel of some real good ones. A bit of a let down."
"Decent beer. Belgian Triple? Not quite, but good."
"D - Seems like it would compliment some light food like a quiche. This is an obviously well-made beer but not very distinctive."
"Pours a burnished golden color, slightly hazy, with a big, white, billowy, meringue-like head. Pretty spicy on the nose, with Belgian yeast, citrus and freshly mown grass. Spicy and hoppy on the palate, very nicely balanced, with a prickly carbonation and a lingering sweetness. Alcohol is well hidden, but eventually it is felt. A very enjoyable beer."
"The mouthfeel is slightly better then the taste. Lightly bubbly with a touch of spicy bitterness and a residual dry malt sweetness to make up this medium body beer. But the taste never really gets better even with the high abv. All in all a disappointment and a pass in my book."
"The beer is a amber in color almost like bottle apple juice, and my pour left very little head. There was a steady stream of bubbles from my glass, but it did not stick around. The aroma was mostly missing, some yeast esters and a little alcohol, but that's about it. The taste is spicy, a little alcoholic, and as it warms up the orchard fruit flavors start to manifest. The beer is a bit undercarbonated for the style, which definitely impairs the experience."
"D: Not the best, but tasty non-the-less."
"Very drinkable, would never guess it was over 9% ABV."
"Enjoy!"
"D: awesome, easily one of the best American Trippels I've ever had."
"Body is thick and sweet with not quite enough carbonation to back up the alcohol and sugar."
"D - It's not my new favorite beer, but I like it and I would drink another, it's a good solid beer!"
"1260"
"22oz bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a crisp bubbly light orange with a decent light khaki head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild sweet malts and Belgian spice. The taste is Belgian spice up front with sweet malts and fruits and a slight citrus hop kick, there is also a bit of alcohol in the finish. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with a bit of carbonation and more alcohol presence than I was hoping for. This seems to be just another in the long line of sub-par American brewed Tripels."
"jd"
"Drinkability: this beer lacks what I'm normally seeking in a tripel. It's not bad, really, but it falls short of the experience I want. I don't see myself purchasing this one again."
"Very good and refreshing. There's something a but different in there from other trippels. Maybe a hint of hops? An excellent attempt at the Belgian style and worthy of trying for anyone."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Pale hazy, light amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is mellow fruitiness. Flavor is sweet and tart citrus with a tart finish. High ABV is hidden. Decent American triple. $7.15 for a 22 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Poured hazy orange color with an average frothy white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Complex spicy fruit and yeasty aroma. Medium to heavy body with a smooth sticky texture. Medium citrus balanced flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate to moderate duration with a small alcohol bite. This is a refreshing standout beer."
"Notes: Overall I feel this is a solid Tripel style beer with a good lively palate."
"Heavy pour gives a slowly building 1/2"" of rocky light tan foam on top of a hazy honey-colored brew. Generates great lacing throughout. Subdued nose of yeast, fruity esters, milk, on a background of bready malt and a hint of caramel. Taste is of spicy hops and a bunch of cinnamon, mixed hops, then tropical flavors (cocoanut and pineapple?). Mouthfeel has good carbonation and viscosity. Finish is slick with lingering sweetness, spices, and hops. Alcohol is hidden well."
"22 oz bomber from the notorious ""Habits"" cheap cig store in Salem. Lovelly looking beer as poured, hazy orange with a small yet handsome light tan head.great laceing too. Nce spicy,bready, hayloft aromas,slightly earthy and a wee bit o leather. Spicy,semi sweet,sourness in the taste.Medicainal slightly, very yeasty. Nice. Great mouthfeel on this one, quite luscious. Overal a very nice American tripel. Liked it."
"D - average Tripel at best, might be completely different either fresh or with a couple years time to meld a bit. right now, its in an awkward adolescent stage. probably wont bother with this again."
"D: I was very excited by the aromas of the beer, but the strong alcohol diminish the enjoyment of this beer."
"D: pretty nice effort from GFBC, very mellow trippel with decent fruit"
"overall a very nice tripel, better on-tap than in the bottle."
"Overall a good trippel and a good value at $5 for the bomber. I could see coming back to this beer when the weather gets warmer. It might be an interesting comparison to do side-by-side with other U.S. trippels. I'm sure Green Flash would hold its own."
"Notes: A fine tripel but really, there are better options out there. Tripel Karmeleit and Allagash Curieux come to mind."
"Verdict: Green Flash have crafted a serviceable American Trippel here. It's nothing earth-shaking, but worth a try for fans of the style."
"Drinkability: A pretty solid domestic Tripel, which I think people don't realize, at least by my standards, is hard to come by these days. Would you expect something from Green Flash, even a Trippel, that wasn't slightly, at least, heavily hopped?"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy orange/gold color with about a half inch off-white head that went away pretty quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like candy sugar, apples, Belgian yeast, bready malt and some bananas and tropical fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some alcohol noticable in the taste. Not too much that it's overpowering, but I can tell it's there. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit creamy and coating with good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. I think this is a decent enough beer, but it's not my favorite Tripel. But with that being said, I think it's worth a try."
"The body is moderate and a bit too sweet for style. Carbonation is a little light as well. Overall there really aren't very many flaws to the beer but I would like more of a Belgian feel/taste"
"D - Very drinkable. For an American Trippel, its pretty good."
"Pours a cloudy golden-orange with a medium white head. The aroma is very fruity with some Belgian yeast. You also get a little floral component. The flavor is fruit, yeast and alcohol. You get some hop bitterness in the flavor and the floral component is also there. The alcohol is warming. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. An interesting take on a tripel that I think works nicely."
"Taste is still pretty good...can tell this one should not be cellared very long, but maintained its freshness well. The hops are plenty noticeable and help to balance out the very sweet malts. Honey flavors are almost dominant. Alcohol (my bottle says 8.5% rather than the aforementioned 9.7%) is readily apparent and contributes a warming effect right away. Even after some age on it, it has not smoothed out like I thought it would, still rough around the edges and does not do a good job of hiding the ABV. It is a decent American attempt at a tripel, fun to give it a go every now and again."
"A+ beer."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle, which might be older because it says 8.5% ABV. Left a nice three finger head with little lacing after the head subsided. Appearance is a nice dark golden yellow color. Strong yeasty, sugars are very apparent, some candied fruits also in the smell. Alcohol is still pretty strong in the first taste, then giving way to biscuit and dough like yeasts. Clove and spices, maybe a small amount of nutmeg. Still alot of heat coming from the alcohol and some banana like flavor. Mouthfeel is not to objectionable. But all and all the drinkability is hampered by the lack of balance."
"D: A decent tripel, but I don't think we'll return to this one."
"drinkability is not so good - just too heavy and the 22oz was about 16 too many"
"OK, I had it again. FINALLY cracked into the bottle I had for a while. It was better than the last time I reviewed it, though I don't think it was quite as good as it has been in the past. Still, quite enjoyable!"
"Not a bad interpretation at all, though I doubt would be confused with a Belgian classic of the style. Some metallic notes through it off, as well."
"Overall a decent tripel, but I am by no means a connoisseur of this style. I enjoy a triple once in a while and at 5.99 for the 22 oz bottle this was a tasty treat! Opt for Golden Monkey if you can."
"medium body, relatively smooth, with resinous astringency in the finish, cleaned up w alcohol and phenols again. crisp, moderate carbonation helps smooth things out in the middle."
"This company can do no wrong for me thus far. This triple kicks ass. It leaves a 3 finger head that settles down with some great lacings. It has a sweet Belgian smell. I like this triple because although it has the trademark Belgian caramel sweetness, it is not over powered by it and is very drinkable. The mouth feel is slightly boozy but hey, its a triple. This is one of the first American triples that I think can hold weight against its Belgian counterparts."
"A Hoegaarden snifter hosts this fine Trippel, suitable for reading or a nightcap, however, the high presence of alcohol and off-style flavors hold this one back."
"D - just ok, won't have it again"
"D- This was an excellent, strong, and complex brew. A good American interpretation of a Belgian tripel. While I thoroughly enjoyed it, I think that compared to the classic examples of the style, some of the flavors seem a bit unnaturally forced into the beer."
"D: This is a nice nightcap beer that drinks stronger than it is. Not among the best Tripels, but a nice enough beer."
"Overall impression: Not bad, fairly drinkable considering the ABV. Enjoyable beer, but nothing too exciting."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle shared with psycohops. Poured into twin standard tulip glasses. The ale appears a clear bright apricot color with about two fingers of lingering creamy off white foam. The aromas and flavors coming from the beer are of sweet candi sugars, fruits such as tart green apples, pears, and white grapes, slightly spicy yeast. Lots of alcohol filling the nose and tingling the tongue. Could use a bit more body though, but it's still worth trying."
"Clear orange body under two finger white head, quick dissipation with minimal lacing. A bit of sweetness in the nose, but more watery than beer-like. Decent tripel-ish taste, sweet oranges, a bit of coriander, and a slightly bitter alcohol finish. Pretty weak mouthfeel, not a lot of carbonation. Alcohol very noticeable, so 1 bomber is more than enough. Not a real strong example of Belgian-style Tripels. Glad I tried it, but won't buy one again."
"Poured luminous golden color in my chalice with white head. Nose was fairy rich with boozy sour green apples. On the palate there was soft malt and an herbal quality that mingled with the sour apple fruityness. Overall, very boozy and fatiguing to drink."
"A pleasant easy drinking Tripel."
"If you're going to compare this to the top-shelf Belgian Tripels you're probably not going to be overly excited. But if you approach it with an open mind and take it for what it is, it's a darn good representation."
"D - With that sweetness and alcohol flavor, it's not a beer I'd go to often. In fact, given the immense wealth of great beers the Triple has, I'm not sure I'll come back to this ever again."
"Drinkability: A very good beer, but a slightly interesting take on a tripel. Definitely a good sipper and a well-rounded beer, but you could easily mistake it for something else."
"Fizzy and bubbly like water on a hot skillet. Mellows with time. A very nice, not too harsh tripel. Sweet fruits and a spicy Belgian balance."
"Very nice all around, but a little off on the taste. Good beer."
"Pulled this bottle from my very modest cellar. No label on the bottle, but I got a case from the brewery dated August 2007. There was a small audible pop when I opened it. Small foamy head when poured into my Delirium glass which quickly dissipates. It smells like yeast and spices. The Belgian yeast really comes through in the taste. The banana-like flavor I remember from fresh bottles is mostly gone now. Very drinkable, little to no alcohol burn. I'm really enjoying this. It seems to have aged really well."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy off-white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, and some spices. The taste is malty/yeasty, slight bitterness, and some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this Tripel is not as spicy as other's, which to me I like."
"This is a nice modest offering, I almost always prefer a Dubbel, but this is definitely solid."
"Dangerously close to a European strong pilsner. Very full and sticky, with only enough carbonation to keep the head up. Green Flash brews some great beers, even some great Belgian styles, but this one is just about middling."
"D: I nursed this beer for a while. A hearty ABV/warming sensation to boot. This bottle was a 9.70%ABV. It looks like they kicked up the alcohol content just a bit? A good beer. I look forward to trying more from Green Flash."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Pours a golden fizzy body, somewhat opaque. Creamy off-white head, fine bubbles, lastingish. Belgiany flowery sweet taste. Some spiciness, maybe clove, or corriander? Spicy taste, floral, somewhat sour. More sour as it warms. A little too sweet as it warms up. Soft mouthfeel, somewhat bitter hoppy."
"poured a hazy amber color with a good creamy head - spotty lacing down the glass - nice aroma - smells like a trippel - taste is malty and sweet - nicely done - another winner from green flash."
"Nice interpretatin of the style."
"The aroma is spicy and yeasty with hops, soap, and malt. The appearance is hazy gold with a nice head and an amber hue. The flavor is like the aroma but somewhat sour. The palate is average for the style. Overall this is not that good and I won't be looking forward to another one anytime soon."
"Pale dark gold/orange in color a little murky. Quickly dissapating head with minor lacing. Very light floral aroma of sweet citrus and banana. Taste is a bit fruity, slightly sweet at forst, sharp peppery finish. Good mouthfeel. Better than average drinkability."
"Very fruity but overly sweet...actually packs a punch!"
"Beer poured golden orange with a nice white head initially. Nose initially was of light fruits, light malts and European hops. Taste is of those light fruits initially, candied sugar, finishing with a light peppery hop. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with that Belgian yeast strain providing a nice smooth ride across the palate. Overall drinkability is good. This is a pretty good representation of the style at a very fair price."
"Full bodied, Nice."
"Considering the style, this is an incredibly drinkable beer."
"Very drinkable and I plan to have this again."
"Sample at Stone. This brew is a clear orange color with a thin off-white head that dissipates steadily. Spotty lacing. Aroma of yeast and bananas plus a bit of citrus. Full-bodied with flavors of yeast, banana and spices plus some yeast and hay. The finish is spicy with citrus and spice flavors and a yeast aftertaste. Pretty solid all around."
"Regardless, the Trippel has a Czech bite of maltiness to the hops and roasted barley. It is a bit less sweet than the Barley Wine that is brewed by Green Flash, but the Trippel is a lot more drinkable and comforting flavor component that is inherent in its construct."
"Overall - It's a decent tripel. It's worth a try because it's a little different that many others of its style, but it's far from the best."
"D. This bottle was split between two people, and one glass with a meal was enough. This beer goes well with light, spicy food, but in my opinion does not stand well by itself."
"D: Overall was moderately good, but there are a lot better examples out there I would opt for before spending money on this. Not a lot of complexity and a tad rough at times flavorwise."
"Bomber. Pours clear orange with lots of carbonation and a huge white head. Aroma is full of the bubblegum and sugar you would expect. I love the taste. Light, full of bananas and spice, yeast and some root beer. A very nice tripel that I wish would find a way into Green Flash' permament rotation."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a thick and creamy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet, malty scent along with a spicey yeast aroma. It's warming to the nose and full of esters. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry, earthy taste that goes down slow and burns a bit in the finish. There is nice hop character to it as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with prickly carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, although there are plenty better available."
"D: Enjoyable. I like it but will probably spend my money on other trippels."
"D - a nice beer. This isn't a bad trippel at all, though I'm not sure if I would buy it over other trippels again. Still, I would say it's definitely worth a shot if you haven't had it. Glad I picked it up"
"I just bought a bottle of this Green Flash Trippel today. Poured it into a Unibroue tulip glass. It's a good amber color I'd say. I liked the amount of foam action. It'd smelled good and it tasted good too. It's very light with a good aftertaste. I drank the whole thing and enjoyed every drop of it. I'd drink it again. Is it the best trippel I've ever tasted? Probably not, but it's pretty good and I wasn't disappointed in the least. Definitely worth a try..."
"Really liked this Tripel."
"D= I really enjoyed this beer and think it is a very good interpretation of the style. Highly drinkable and refreshing."
"4.5/3.5/3.5/3.5/3"
"D- Easy to drink just something different on this one."
"Edit: I just read MrHungryMonkey's review and I agree that it needs more funk. Good point."
"This is certainly a tasty brew. If I were judging it as a Tripel, I'd say it didn't have the rock-tight balance of a paradigm. If this had come out of one of my homebrew bottles I would brew it again and try to up the alcohol to dry it up and up the funk towards an Orval-like medicine cabinet. Until the day I can brew Tripels this good, though, I would gladly lap this one up."
"Pours a hazy copper with a white head. Highly carbonated with an everlasting ring of foam and no lacing. Smells like bananas and oranges. Full body tasting of bananas with a spicy hint. Reminds me of a Tripel Karmeliet, but cheaper. Green flash has been good to me so far."
"Poured from the 22oz. bottle into a thin tulip. Pours a clearish yellow with a thin, but active, white head. Smells of bananas and spices- mostly pepper. Taste is a bit bland. Some spice kick, but no overwhelming flavor. I like my tripels with a bit more oomph, I guess. Hides the alcohol well, though. Fairly drinkable, but I dont think I would seek it out again over other tripels."
"Transparent orange with a one finger head that dissipates quickly. Christmas spice on the nose, sweet malts. Carbonated, alcohol on the finish. Bittering hops compliment the heavy alcohol on the tongue, warm. I'm really reaching from some sweet flavors but I'm not getting it. Hops with the alcohol dominate this triple, not much of a Belgian triple, heavily distinctive west coast flavors though."
"Pours a hazy orange into a goblet, with a 1 finger head that settles to a thick cap and clings to the inside of the glass all through the drink, excellent lacing, some good carbonation action as well. Aroma is of citrus, orange, banana, malt, vanilla. Mouthfeel is thick and a little chewy, with lots of carbonation. Taste is heavily of spice, clove, orange, malt, with some banana, caramel and a hint of vanilla. Alcohol in the finish, but overall a good taste, lots of malt comes through as it warms. Drinkability is moderate to high. I may try this again sometime, and will have to get a firmer grasp on the style."
"This beer falls short. It lacks the true Belgian character. The yeast seems to be light on the classic aromas and flavors. The alcohol starts to hinder its drinkability. There are plenty of other trippels worth drinking above this one."
"D- not bad much better versions of this style, i felt it was way too much in the banana/clove department."
"Nothing too exceptional here, but not bad by any means."
"D: As I type this review, the Green Flash Tripel gets easier and easier going down.. that being said, I can't really say that the drinkability is anything above average, especially for a tripel. For a much smoother drinking and more substantial tripel, try Unibroue's ""La Fin Du Monde."""
"This beer is weird because if you blindfolded me, I wouldn't have guessed it was a tripel...I guess it has too much of a Southern Cal/ Green Flash twist on it to strictly be a tripel."
"D = Good drinkability, a nice refreshing beer which would pair well with food."
"Not bad,just not to my liking for the style."
"Overall a decent Trippel that's easy to drink if you like your beers sweet...really sweet."
"Drinkability- Overall a decent made american tripel. Definitely drinkable, but needs a bit of tweaking to become a better beer per style."
"D-A darker triple than say a Triple Karmelite yet still a good quaf. As this style is still not the most common for American brewers, I give them credit for producing one of the more difficult bees to brew to drinkers satisfaction. An immature creation but can always improve next year."
"D - Good but others are better. Some of the bitterness distracts from the enjoyment"
"Get the papers, get the papers, beers ok, beers ok."
"Medium thin-bodied and mildly juicy, the beer has great drinkability and is very refreshing."
"but for an American brewed version! this is pretty good. I'd have this again."
"Drinks pretty slow, a lot going on here. Pretty good tripel. Bottle conditioning, so maybe buy a few to age to see how this matures, I bet this only gets better with a few years on it"
"D - Not really my favorite. Nice."
"Way too sweet in my opinion."
"This beer poured a clear golden color and formed a small snow white bubbly head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, banana, yeast/bread and spices. The flavor was of malt, pepper, bread and some citrus. The body is medium and just slightly creamy and the finish is rather peppery. A good beer, but not going to drive anyone away from their favorite tripels."
"D: Another kick ass beer from Green Flash, a very tasty and easy drinking tripel, a great American version of the style."
"22oz. bomber split into two goblets. Cloudy deep yellow/light orange with one finger of thick white head which stays. Nice lacing throughout. Aroma is sweet with hints of citrus and cloves, some banana as well. Taste is lemony, yeasty and spicy, with a bit of an alcohol bite in the finish. Low carbonation, as is appropriate for the style. Medium bodied, a good sipping beer."
"Pours a cloudy bright orange/brown color with a small yet dense tan head that dissipated into a nice cap. The aroma is sweet with the candi sugare. Has a nice honey floral smell, some banana esters as well. The taste is of candi sugar and Belgian yeast, which gives it a nice banana and earthy flavor. Some honey and a nice hop spice round out this brew. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, not overcarbonated like some Belgian styles can be. The taste is sweet in the typical tripel sort of way, though it is not very sticky or slick. The alcohol is pretty well hidden for an American made tripel. A very good Belgian tripel which can hang with its Belgain counterparts. Probably one of the better, if not best, American tripels that I have had."
"d. Very drinkable, and hides the 8.5 well."
"D: quite a good beer I still believe it is more a strong Biere de Garde then a Triple, make sure you are not drinking the bomber alone."
"This beer is quite drinkable given its strength, yet doesn't offer the body or complexity of finer Tripels."
"Body is a touch too big for this style, but has a clean, smooth mouthfeel and nice drinkability. Worth seeking out as this is a great example of an American styled Belgian Tripel."
"Have not been too impressed with Green Flash brews overall and this also fell into the mediocre category, not a big fan of most American brewery's attempts at a tripel in fact, one of the drier tripels I have tasted which was not a bad thing in my eyes, not too bad for the price, might drink again, worth trying once"
"An earthen Tripel, which doesn't seem to translate all that well. An average tasting version of the style at best. Not worth a try."
"For an American brewed Belgian, I really liked this beer. It's not going to cut into the Belgian export market but it is a pleasant addition to the US supply."
"Drinkability is pretty good, not really as digestible as a true Belgian, but a closer stab at the style then most of Green Flash's American contemporaries. The booze and thickness are the biggest weakness, and I reckon the time in the cellar helped temper that some, so I'm glad I procrastinated."
"Overall this is OK but not great. Not as complex or unified in flavor as I would expect from a tripel. The alcohol is harsh and could stand some cellaring. Still quite fruity and sweet. Worth a try."
"Pours a rich golden to amber color with a light white head. Smell is rich, bold and malty with a strong sweetness and lemony characteristic. Taste is well hopped to balance the maltiness. Somewhat dry, at the same time, however. Interesting spiced character too. Not bad at all, and I can feel the style growing on me."
"d: i think a good american take on the style but perhaps a little on the subtle side for my taste"
"Overall not a bad beer at all. I thought this was excellently done and really quite nice overall. I would love to get it again and maybe try aging it a bit to see if some of the fruit and hop flavors die back a bit and bring some of what's underneath up to the front. Still this was excellent and I would have to recommend it to those who are a fan of the style."
"Extra note: Yeast as a chaser strong dried hop, lime, grapefruit, wheat grass and sea salt character on the nose with a yeasty, chalky, vitamin c and soggy bread crust taste."
"A bold tripel, one that embraces both Belgian tradition and the pioneering spirit of 21st century U.S. micros. Would buy it again in a heartbeat."
"D: Not bad, but I expected more from Green Flash."
"Not this brewery's best brew, nor the best Tripel, but still, not a horrible sample... Worth a try..."
"notes - not bad, i look forward to trying the other green flash products that just arrived here in fresno."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Tripple is not an easy style to do well but I think GF has done a good job. Been very impressed to this point to the brewery as I was able to have some samples of the others."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary, yeasty, and mostly clean with notes of bitter yeast and orange zest biting the back of the tongue."
"Over score- 86/100"
"Many thanks to nvsblman, sent this one my way for my BA annv. Bombing."
"Bottle courtesy of SS: Poured a deep golden/orangey color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of spicy yeast, light peaches and some sweet malt. Taste is also dominated by some spicy notes with some refreshing peachy taste and some quite big and sweet malt notes. Great carbonation with a medium to full body and some light alcoholic notes. Very well done overall and something I wouldnt mind trying again."
"D: Probably a little over a year old, and I think it did it good. I'll go on the record to say I'm a fan of aged tripels."
"The beer emerges from the 22 ounce bottle a hazy orange or a reddish yellow, the head piles high on the body, creamy, an off white color, as it diminishes to nothingness, the lacing provides a bit of privacy as it obscures the glass. Nose has a big fruit like aroma, bananas, over ripe peaches, and a cotton candy like sweetness, malt and limes comingle to provide a nice treat for the schnozzle. Start has a decent malt presence, sweet and a bit of hops at the back, top is middling in feel. Finish continues the fruity sweetness, the hops delicately spicy and the aftertaste dry and long lasting, a fine drinking beer that lives up to the style."
"Overall, a nice, satisfying beer. Not the best of this style, but a reasonable example."
"Drinkability - Smooth and warming. Good any time/day."
"Bomber bottle, poured into a wine glass, pours cloudy dark apricot, near white tiny bubble head, film and then well developed lacing.deeply fruity nose, with some powdered sugar. Peppery spice up front, then rich fruity notes, melon and kiwi, more cutting pepper, then a zest of limes and Belgian yeastyness. I like it, love the style and especially when U.S. brewers try to kick it up a notch. More S.D. style, bold,flavorful and full throttle brewing here. NIce, I'd like to try it with some spicy BBQ."
"Comment: This is my first beer from this brewery. The triple represents a noble effort and a very acceptable product. I would happily sample it again."
"All around, an average beer. Enjoyed out of a stemless red wineglass (doubles as a stemless brandy snifter). Pours a copper/bronze amber. Head is creamy off-white, tightly packed and short-lived (half-life of the head was less than 30 seconds). Very little lacing on the glass. Smells of a typical belgian trippel: banana, clove, spice. Lots of fruity esters. Taste is a little dissapointing. Simply average. Nothing more. Banana and clove flavors, and a little spice. Alcohol flavors are disrupting my palate. The ethanol really is noticable in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is also a let-down. Oily and slick, not light and tingly like a typical Belgian trippel. Overall, an average Belgian style trippel, although a good attempt from a decent American microbrewery. In my opinion: worth a try, but if you're looking for that authentic Belgian trippel, stick to the trapist breweries."
"Flavors are certainly in line with the Belgian style Tripel but seem a tad rough around the edges. Flavors of banana, clove, spice, vanilla, wheat, orange and yeast are apparent but are dont seem to be supported by the typical subtle malty/honey sweetness of a true Belgian Tripel. Well worth a try, but the authentic Belgians are heads above."
"This was a fairly decent tripel from one of the great american micros. Poured golden with a larger than expected head- nice aromas- spiced green apples, candy malts, some alcohol. Tase was more on the side of flavor overload- not very subtle exactly like most american tripels are to the palate. Somewhat harsh banana flavored syrupy alcohol, but not too bad. The mouthfeel bothered me- it was not very light at all, and the body was heavier than i like in a tripel- thankfully the full flavors did hide some of the less refined alcohols. Give it a try if you want to try to believe there is some hope for an americanized tripel."
"Trippel is far from horrible, but it's nowhere near a good version of my favorite Belgian style. My recommendation is to spend your hard-earned money on Green Flash IPA instead. Now there's a quality beer."
"The results were mixed. It was definitely drinkable, though the alcohol content was very noticeable and distracting. The taste was simple, with little of the complexity that make tripels and quadrupels so appealing. Each sip was very much like the prior, a sweet good tasting beer with little depth to it. Better than average, but not great. The price can't be beat, though (at least here in Irvine) for a decent brew of this type."
"Drinkability: A nice stab at the style but a few too many flaws to rank higher"
"D - 8.5% let's you think you can rock it out, but be careful, it bit me. Otherwise, the mouthfeel with ABV let's you session this carefully. Carefully. A good, solid form of the style."
"Drinkability is OK. I can't really recommend this as anything except a VERY non-offensive beer. This could be more complex in flavor but it is absolutely free of any faults or rough edges."
"Initially fruity sweet and drying hoppy finish. Creamy mouthfeel though lagerish in the finish. Satisfying,orange and peach and bannana, honey and sugar,with lace and nice head. Aromas are yeasty and orange, with alcohol.I still never met a trippel I did not like."
"Drinkability  This wasnt necessarily a bad ale but I certainly wouldnt parade it around."
"Pours a woderful golden color with a nice white head that quickly disappears. No malt or hops aroma-but not expecting it with this style. Alcohol is very noticble with a candy sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and the after taste is very short. The drinkability is high athough at 8.5% I am not sure how many of these you could have-"
"Beautiful appearance! Golden color, with a pleasant haze. Head is big and rich, and ample carbonation is evident by the wonderful circulation of bubbles throughout. Smell is only mediocre. Not bad by any means, just stock. The usual suspects are present, coriander, wheat, apples, but nothing to set it apart. Taste is damn good, and bolder than I expected. Sweet malt with a lemony tartness at the finish. Mouthfeel is as it should be, crisp yet robust. I'm enjoying this very much. There is not a beer style more oft-massacred by micro brewers than the Tripel; this is a notable exception. Could have been a lot more daring, but well executed."
"D- There are so many examples of this style that are so much better, I am not going to drink many of these."
"A decernt beer overall, but not the best american rendition of a Trippel that I've had.... Almost tastes like it was simply fermented too warm. Great mouthfeel though. I think this would have benefited from some more candi sugar to thin it out a bit. But with the combination of hops and spicy yeast, if I were tasting this blind, I would have guessed it is a Saison.... But for only $4.99 out here on the east coast, it's worth picking up and trying. It won't blow you away, but you won't really be disappointed either..."
"I've had this beer several times (even the 3rd anniversary bottle) when it was 8.5% but now the new label says 9.7% so either they got it wrong the first time or something changed. Either way, this is awesome, way too easy to drink given the strength."
"The Flash Trippel poured out very nicely, a magnificent radiant amber with good cabonation and a nice, modest rich foamy head. Smell was pretty good, but a bit underwhelming for the style. Taste was not exactly what I was expecting from a trippel, it was good but the peppery notes domminated and there was actually very little malt sweetness to it. Very dry for a trippel. Easy to drink and it was not offensive to the pallet in any way. Worth a try."
"Seems a bit thin, but for what it offers and the prices I've read it's a bargain in this category."
"Cheers!"
"Rather thin mouthfeel kicks off this tasty and highly drinkable beer. Vibrant ripe tropical fruit flavors lead the way with a mild sweetness that sustains this beer. Notes of pepper creep in towards midsip alongside some drying hop bitterness. Alcohol is nicely masked, allowing the sweetness and spicyness to vie for front stage (it's pretty much a tie, illustrating the excellent balance of this beer)."
"Nice, though...I like it."
"Overall I would drink this again. A nice example of an american trippel, not exactly like a Belgian would produce which is what we are all about. Making our own versions of long standards."
"Drinkability: decent but not overwhelming by any means. I found this to be a touch too sweet which wore me down a bit by the bottom of the bottle."
"Beer is good. Happy international style beering."
"D - Good. An entire bomber is more than enough of this delightful brew. Worth trying. I am really surprised this is rated so poorly. I don't think I will have it again though."
"Green Flash is now one of my favorite breweries, but this is not one of my favorite offerings. It starts very typical and average of the style, and never does much to improve. The ABV is sizable, but actually well presented. While it's not irretrievable, this one does speak to sticking to what you do best, especially when one's best is as good as theirs."
"I got this one on cask at the liars club. this was their only cask offering so i figured i would give it a try. It arrived in a Chimay chalice, a cloudy golden colour with a nice head that was retained throughout. Taste wise it was a little on the flat side for a tripel. i was left wanting more. The mouthfeel was very nice, but on cask not more than expected. If you see this on cask, try some. If not i would raher have a lot of other tripels."
"D: The high abv and thin malts don't cut it for me. They focus too much on the alcohol flavors. I find that Green Flash's hop-based ales (Pale and IPA) really work while this one comes up short."
"Notes: Hmmmm...I have a mixed take on this offering. On one side I think its one of the better American attempts at a tripel. However, it still falls short of its Belgian counterpart. This is getting better and better though and this is definitely towards the top as far as a yankee offering. Good."
"Mouth is a little too acidic/astringent, but generally pleasant. A good tripel, definitely a good value. You can get better, but you will pay more."
"I guess this beer is drinkable for a tripel but Green Flash is better at other beer styles and there is always a Trappist available. I will not buy this one again."
"Strange brew, with some good components. Interesting enough for a bottle, but I'm not inclined to reach for another."
"Decent drinkability, although a rather mediocre beer overall. If you are looking for a good tripel, pass this one by."
