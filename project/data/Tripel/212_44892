Taste: pear, soft golden delicious apple, clove, pepper, grape and coriander in the finish, vanilla-ish booze. Lighter-medium and slick, growing carbonation midsip then ending in a sticky finish cut by clove. A bit messy and boozy but pretty tasty overall.","babaracas","Dec 03, 2014"

Aroma is a bit pungent with massive notes of booze and rotten fruit, honey, pears, smells incredibly sweet. Flavor is overly sweet and funky booze pears and honey, not much else going on here, banana and yeast esters, a hint of spice. Heavy on the palate with very high carbonation.

The honey notes,combined with the spicy finish,are odd, but weirdly do work. I would suggest pairing this beer with some like a Chinese honey chilli chicken, some sort of sweet and sour dish.

Everything that makes a beer a beer is gone from this brew's flavor profile: no malt and no hops. Still, what is here is like alchemy: lead into gold a brief foray into the magical. This beer is strange; it grows on you and if you are a home-brewer like me, you wonder what kind of yeast cleared this out of sugars like this, what kind of wood is that I taste...not the best triple I have ever had, but surely the most interesting and challenging to the style.

Smell is of malt, grain, honey, spice, and cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with honey, spice, fruit, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some oxidized qualities that actually don't really detract from the other aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 14, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apricot, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, light honey, light bread, and phenolic yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and moderate malt flavors; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, apricot, light banana, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, light honey, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and pale malt notes; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Tripel. Good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and surprisingly crisp sipping for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 25, 2013"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grain, sugar, fruit, banana, spice, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, sugar, alcohol, grain, banana, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Upon first inspection of the aroma on this one it was pretty close to what one would expect from the style as far as the notes given off throughout. Once I took the first sip I was really off-put by the alcohol note going on in this one as it was very distracting from the other flavors going on in this one. There was a nice representation of the style going on despite this fact, but the alcohol just dulled it down for me personally. Worth trying if you get the chance especially on tap.","thagr81us","Aug 17, 2012"

4.5,18.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: For an 11%er, this hides the alcohol well. Intense sweetness definitely does most of the hiding; it could be a little less sweet and a bit more dry, but overall, that is a minor gripe. It's certainly not cloying, but very sweet. An excellent sipper, and even better aperitif.","irishking1977","Feb 04, 2010"
3.93,3.4,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Reviewed from my notes. The beer has a translucent golden yellow appearance. There is a thin ring of white soap bubbles on top of the beer. After swirling the beer around the glass, it deposits a good foamy film. As the amount of beer in my glass got lower, I noticed that looking straight down through the beer, it was clear; it was only transparent when viewed through the sides of the glass. It has a lemon citrus aroma, with a bit of musty yeast. The taste has some flavors of Belgian yeast, crisp lemon citrus, and both crystal and candy sugars. There is some hops present in the aftertaste. It has a medium body and plenty of carbonation that makes it feel a bit peppery. There is a little bit of mouthcoating, but not as much as the ABV lead me to expect. It's a crisp beer, but the sweetness and strength would make me limit myself to one pour.","ToasterChef","Jan 14, 2010"

4.25,11.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Perhaps because of its heavy carbonation, it's not particuarly quaffable in large doses. It certainly tastes, smells, and look wonderful, but the carbonation is a bit too much to overcome to be sessionable.","Intelligentsia","Dec 02, 2009"

3.29,-13.4,3,4,3,3.5,3,"Notes: This is a decent tripel that definitely hides the 11% ABV well (until the finish at least), but the rest of the flavor profile seems kind of weird and is all over the place at times. The citrusy notes seem to clash with the soft fruits and overwhelm them with that tart, acidic sensation that makes it taste kind of awkward. The aftertaste is rather off-putting as well, and really hinders the drinkability as a result. Overall, this one missed the mark as far as I'm concerned.","sweetbrew82","Aug 01, 2009"

The taste is malty sweet up front with a slight alcohol finish. The hops are well blended into the flavor and the alcohol is not overwhelming despite the high content (11%).

Carbonation is light and delicate, just a bit more would be nice if you ask me. Nothing special nothing damning. As far as drinkability, I'd go for the Maredsous over this one, better flavor and considering that this one is 16 and change for a four-pack....well it'll be a while till I drink this one again if ever. It really doesn't do it for me. Not a bad beer, but it should be better for the price...I mean the Donker and the Rouge are worth the price, this one....not so much so.","becktone","May 08, 2009"

2.27,-40.3,2.5,3,2,2,2,"OVERALL: A very strong triple, dominated by the unnecessarily high ABV. It's too boozy for my liking and not smooth enough on the way down.

3.85,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer is a somewhat hazy golden liquid. The head is massive and brilliantly white. The aroma is a little spicy, with some alcohol and fruit notes (pear, lemon, and apple). The spice is a bit peppery, and there's also a little yeast in the smell (no notable hop aroma). Although the taste is a semi-sweet, it is balanced with a not-quite hot spiciness. Alcohol warming is intense. There's considerable bitterness that starts in the hind-taste, and continues well through the finish. Medium body and very carbonated, giving the beer a 'prickly' sensation. Good tripel.","Suds","Mar 15, 2009"

Aroma is yeasty and doughy. Alcohol and floral notes are there as well. Was expecting more of a singe from the alcohol given the ABV. A lot of yeast and bread in the taste; the hops give it a nice bite. Really shocked that this beer is 11%; the alcohol is there but is masked quite well. Beer has a champagne like effervescence. A very worthy tripel; I'm still not sure how they masked the alcohol so well. If you like tripels, this is a good bet. Not the best that I've had but a good bang for the buck.","Nick3","Feb 16, 2009"

Medium-bodied, fun frothy attach which fills up the mouth momentarily, emphasizing golden honey, tangerine citrus, wax, yellow apple, banana to apricot fruit, cinnamon stick, clove, polished mouth feel although one might say the carbonated fizz ain't all that classy.

The smell is fruity and citrussy. The taste, oh the taste! To me, this was the best tasting Tripel at the Fest, and there were a bunch of them(including Gouden Carolous, St Bernardus, St Feullian, Val Dieu, La Rulles, and Des Rocs, as well as some domestic versions). The flavors I tasted included banana, cherry, a brandy-like alcohol flavor, a slight citrussy lemon/orange flavor, a sweet caramel/honey flavor, and a light crispness I found irresistable. The disparate flavors blended into an outstanding whole. The mouthfeel is light yet full-flavored. This is a fantastic beer, and one I will continue to enjoy until it's gone(hopefully, not for a while!).","edbeered","Beers"
4.33,13.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Tried a bottle of this as recommended by a very good friend of mine during a Friday night visit to La Cav DU Vin several weeks back. An 11.2 oz bottle poured into a fat tulip glass. pours a cloudy, crisp looking medium golden color. The white head was well over an inch when poured. Good retention and lacing here indeed! Eventually settles to a good 1/3 inch and then 1/4 inch. malty aromas, vanilla, clove, and other spices. maybe a bit of fruit here as well such as apple or banana. Has a sweet and caramel malty flavor with a bit of the aforementioned spice and fruit, definitely banana. the taste of alcohol is slightly noticeable, a bit more than in most 7% ABV beers I suppose. Has a crisp, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink. A fine beer all around.","neenerzig","0"
