"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled on 6/4/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness/hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish fora good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a crisp malt/yeast/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome tripel style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pours a mostly clear light orange with one finger thick soda fizzy white head, settles to a thin ring with a few streaks of lace trailing. Smell: ripe pear, ripe red delicious apple, notes of caramel and candied orange peel; mildly floral with a grassy note. Sweet, fruity. Taste: bready and sweet... pear, dried apricot, mild pepper and grassy notes, muted grapejuice and candied orange peel, more pear in the finish. Medium-plus bodied, very creamy feel, sugary finish. This is really very good if not a little heavy on the sweetness. 9% on the bottle. 6/2013 bottling."

"330ml bottle. Tulip glass. Intense peach as cap is removed. Bright golden color, crystal clear appearance. White froth. Aroma profile displays ripe fruit, spices, herbs, sugary alcohol, hay & ripe melon memories. Crispy, sugary & spiced upfront. Medium to full body. Moderately high carbonation. Dried palate & kind heat. Melon & ripe fruit notes are joined by low bitterness then linger into a dry sweet/bitter finish. Long fruity aftertaste."

"Pours out a nice dark orange in color with a finger white head that dissipated really quick with not lacing, Smell is really sweet that I can only assume is brown Belgian candy sugar. Really not much going on in the nose except real sweetness, Taste is more complex with the Belgian candy sugar, a little tiny bit of booze, and certainly some brown sugar to go with it as well. Mouthfeel is medium thick which is nice for the style. Honestly I don't like the beer as much as the last time I drank it as it just isn't as complex as I would have hoped. this is a great beer but just needs some balance,"
""
"Overall - Not the best Tripel that I have had, but this is a good beer, decent value, and relatively easy to locate. You could do a lot worse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good tripel. Love all the golden delicious apple flavor here. I was a bit turned off by all the sediment, but flavor wise, it is an excellent value buy."

"O: A good, solid Belgian triple. My experience with triples may be somewhat shallow, but I would certainly reach for this beer again when I needed a bready malt/yeast fix. Great beer."
""
""
"Golden/honey colored in appearance, with lighter head - not creamy. Good smell - slightly bitter. Flavor is sweet and full, very little hops/very little bitterness. Very malty. It feels creamy and full in the mouth. Overall, this beer feels fairly heavy - way heavier that its appearance. Overall, much better in appearance and smell than in in flavor and finish. Just okay."
"Seasonal glass from a pint bottle. Looks like honey! Quite golden with 3/4 inch head. Smells like clover or a freshly mown meadow. (Weirdly evokes Chanel no 5.) After the complexity of the smell, have to say I was disappointed with the taste. Just seems a little thin. But did stand up nicely with a Lye Cross 3 Pepper Leicester."
""
""
""
"Eh, there are so many better tripels out there, and so many strong blonde Belgian beers in general to really bother with this one. Nice and cheap though(1.60 for a 33)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, as with other beers I've had from Affligem, it's stupendous. It's quite expensive but whenever I feel like treating myself (which is quite often) this brew will be on my menu. Recommended by me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very nice example of the style. All the flavours are there, and very well balanced. Reminded me of La Chouffe due to the sweetness, but that's not a negative trait either."
""
""
""
"Well balanced for a Tripel, acidy and not too sweet. It really grows with degustation time; I had to change this write up at the end once its complexity became more apparent."
" The taste is very good with light caramel and gentle tropical accent of yeast with subtle pepper and light floral hop flavor with nutty toasted malt taste with slight yeast mid palate and low alcohol in flavor with mild phenolic and light hop flaovrs in the mostly dry finish. Overall I consider this a pretty good tripel with some nice spice elements from yeast with restrained alcohol -nice semi-dry taste with candy sugar evident mostly dry finish and refreshing effervescence."
""
""
""
""
"O: This tripel hides its alcohol rather well and the high amount of carbonation and the pepper spices help to cut through the candi sugars and prevent this from being too sticky and sweet."

"Wow, a really rich beer; I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"330 ml. bottle Big creamy foam, not much retention. Yellow deep golden colour. Smell of ripe fruits, apple, clove, earth. Too sweet palate for the style, IMO. Good carbonation. Taste of fruits, apples apricots, clove, spices, maybe pepper. Good, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: nicely complex and fruity, and leaning to the tart side of the sweet-tart dimension."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"A pretty bang-on exemplar for the style, the big booze not nearly as invasive as even in some of the other world beaters. It's still sweet, sure, but in a seductively balanced manner. I don't using consider procuring another when faced with just one bottle of this particular style, but I would not mind breaking that trend with this one."
""
""
"Not as fruity as Chimay, this is a more no nonsense Belgian Tripel"
""
""
""
"Best as a pre-supper sipper. This one was aged for two years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: where is the punchy variety of flavour hinted at by the aroma? too one dimensional and overall not memorable"
""
"Overall: Overall a very traditional triple and cornerstone to the style. Bottle or draft and you can't go wrong. This beer is super awesome too is at warmed to room temperature."
""
""
"Vigorous pour from a 750ml bomber into a Duvel goblet at 42F resulted in a 2 finger meringue-like head, 1 finger in 3 minutes, mostly dissipated at 5. No lacing. Clear orange gold ale. Full-face in goblet smell revealed slight yeastiness, nothing else. I get a sweet warmth to start finishing with a mildly medicinal flat finish. Nice carbonation with pinpoints, fun to watch. A decent beer if it's what's available, but don't need to rebuy."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad Triple at all. Better than an American version I can think of. At 8 dollars a 750 you cant beat it. Great stuff."
""
""
""
"overall: I would not recommend this. I guess I have high expectations for a Begium Beer."

"I felt like I was pouring Champagne, very bubbly. The creamy off white head dissipated in just the right amount of time. Has a nice smell, and taste. The only drawback is that I am going to have to drink the whole thing because it is a corked bottle. 750 ml at 9% abv. The alcohol content is barely noticeable and I didn't realize it was so high until I started typing this review...WHOA!"
""
""
"Overall it's not bad but it's a letdown from the nose entirely and doesn't have the malt density that I like for this style. Hints at crisp at white wine but doesn't quite get there either. The good news is as it warms up it gets a bit better and with a good candy sweetness to come through. This one takes time."
""
""
""
""
"I was totally surprised by this! It’s hard to go into a beer without any sort of expectation in todays world of ratings. I wasn’t blown away, but I loved the hell out of this thing. It’s a straight up no frills tripel but is put together so well. After Westmalle most tripels meld together for me. This might go the lead of that tight knit pack."
""
""
"o: a solid tripel. very smooth, lots of flavors."
""
""
""
"Affligem Tripel, 22 oz. bomber: I got the chance to sample this highly rated triple over the weekend. The body is golden in color and as clear as you are careful keeping the sediment out of your pour. The head is average, and continuous carbonation replenishes it during the drinking experience. Very solid tripel aroma of Belgian yeast and champagne. Flavor was middle of the road, not outstanding or odd notes, just solidly where a tripel should be. Overall, a very good beer, but did not wow me as other tripels have. Maybe it was my mood that evening. That’s the tough part of reviewing beer, there are so many factors that influence the experience of having a beer. To be fair, beer reviews should be head to head comparisons rather than individual tastings."
""
"Affligem Tripel is a rich gold with nice head and not too much lacing. The fine particles of yeast take their time settling, if they settle at all. Crisp, peppery floral aroma. This is a spicy and sweet beer with noticeable alcohol. I can understand why people have tasted some apple and pear as well. Dense stuff, almost like a carbonated nectar, but that rounds out the strong flavors very nicely. Whether it is as good as a Trappist ale or La Fin du Monde I can't say right now. I'd need a side-by-side comparison. I think it represents its style well and is worth a try."
"O: Great tripel, reminds me of Avery's Salvation. A definite must try."
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well constructed beer, complex but simple and I like that. I can't see this beer being knocked by anyone, it's a rare commodity to find something that can please most crowds. Grab a glass and treat yourself, you only love once. Salud!"
""
""
""
"O - From the Pour to the Taste to the Mouthfeel, this is a different brand of Tripel. Everything is crisp and straightforward."
"O: Heavy in flavor for a triple. high in alcohol. Not what I like in a tripel but is still good."
""
"Medium-bodied mouthfeel. This beer can serve well as either aperitif or nightcap."
""
"D: A very good tripel that I would certainly drink again. Having tasted Westmalle last night, I would say that this is not quite on that level yet, but still a great tripel option."
""
"O: This is a very good quality tripel. I find that the mouthfeel and the taste are on par with most top tripels. Just a great beer."
""
""
"Overall, quite a nice tripel. I have not been a big fan of other Affligem beers I have had, and this one exceeded my expectations."
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.17, an A-. I haven't had a lot of tripels, but I am increasingly becoming a big fan of the style - and this is one of the best I've had so far. I wish this was available at the LCBO year-round, as it would be a solid alternative to Chimay and La Trappe's tripels. A very satisfying choice for my 250th review."
"Clear gold and perfectly filtered, lots of carbonation coming off the base of the glass. Voluminous white head with a heck of a lot of lacing and great retention. Nose has sweet malt and bready notes, moderate amounts of light fleshed fruits and good spicing. Not too bold but well balanced. Taste has more sweet malts, fruitiness and is a bit chalky on the palate (but not as much as something like a Chimay White). Light metallic notes are present with this at cellar temp, but disappear as this gets to room temp. Alcohol is there as well, not hot but the flavour is certainly evident. Spice and booze in the finish. Full body, and light prickly carbonation. An enjoyable but not outstanding tripel."
"A Tripel I'm glad to have tried and would purchase again."
"Overall – Very drinkable given the ABV and well balanced. It's definitely the best beer I've had from this brewer. Pick this one up if you happen to come across it."
"Definitely my favorite offering from this brewery. Unfortunately I rarely see it so I will need to grab some more while it is still available."
"Hazy golden yellow colour with an average white bubbly head. Average retention and lacing. Aroma's soft and subtle, hinting at fruits, bread, and slightly metallic and citrusy. Nice crisp pilsner malt backbone, light fruitiness, pepper, and spice. Dry finish with a noticeable but not distracting alcohol presence. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Nice to see this available in the area. Good rendition of the style with evident spicy notes. Somewhat agree with comparisons to Duvel."
""
"Golden blonde, one finger of white head, not much lace. Smell is full of tropical fruit, yeast and clove, fairly bright and grassy hop profile, some candy notes, clove, spicy as well coriander perhaps. Taste is fruity, lightly sweet candy flavours, light bitterness, grassy and earthy flavours come out as well, a little spice in the finish, yeasty aftertaste with some clove. Fairly high carbonation, creamy and pretty smooth, medium body, pretty good feel. Nice triple and you cant argue with the price, easy drinking and quite satisfying overall."

"Overall: Flavor is a little bland, but has the sneaky alcohol, high carbonation, and dry finish characteristic of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with lots of yeast causing lots of carbonation. Scent is bready, yeasty with some citrus hints. Taste is crisp and clean. There are of course bready hints fromthe yeast and some clove spice. Has a slightly bitter finish that if full and smooth. A very well made Tripel."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid tripel. The flavours leave something to be desired but it is quite nice. The alcohol is hidden very well."

"O- this is an excellent beer that goes down sooo well. Before i knew it, i was almost done..and feelin great. it was different than what i was expecting, but a real nice surprise."
"M: Plenty sweet. Plenty strong too. A big beer that is best shared. I'd be worried if I got through the entire bottle."
"Picked up a 330 ml bottle from Al Campo. Bottle has 23.02.13 meaning drink by date I presume. Pours a nice deep golden cloudy two finger head that dissipates quickly to 1/4 inch lacing head. Smell the sweet flowery slightly spicy scent. Taste is pretty darn good, yeasty, tart fruit like a pear, some Belgian yeast in there but the alcohol covers it Not feeling much hop or malt action, closer to a good white wine like a Pinot grigio. I like it and would try it again when it is a bit warmer."
"What I find unique and enjoyable about most Belgium beers is their texture. They seem to play that part stronger than most other beers. I thought that was the strongest part of this one..."
"Affligem Tripel pours a crystal clear orange, with plenty of golden highlights shining through in the glass. The slightly dirty white head rises up to just short of 3 fingers, but disappears with alarming rapidity. It's clean too, nothing left behind in the way of lacing. Totally unacceptable for a Belgian style beer. The nose still manages to shine through well, and it's textbook tripel. Sugar soaked stone fruits and clove spiciness greet my nose, with a hint of alcoholic presence. The flavor profile largely follows the blueprint laid out by the aroma. There's some bitterness mid palate, nothing approaching an IPA in intensity, but enough to break up the sweet front end and allow for a transition to the clove phenols. There's a subtle, pleasant warming sensation from the alcohol that radiates out from my center with every sip. The body is impressively, appropriately light for a beer of it's size, and the carbonation bright and frothy. It' lacks the slight creamy edge that the mouthfeel of the best Belgians have, but it's just a spot below. Affligem Tripel is a very solid rendition of the style (appearance aside), and one I would give someone if I was trying to show them what a tripel tastes like."
"O) A tripel through and through. Solid profile characteristics."
"O: This is in my top 3 tripels, and might be in my top 1 or 2 -- it has a lot of hops and yeasty estery character that exceeds Westmalle by a long way and gives La Fin Du Monde a serious run for its money. Grab this if you have the chance -- I wish I had taken advantage a lot earlier than this. It is a top-shelf tripel to be sure."
"O: Extremely solid Tripel, and while not the best I've had, I would not hesitate to pick up more."
"This is a really good beer, much better to me than a lot of the reviews have suggested. It's a bit Duvel-like. I'm glad I've got two bombers of this."
"O: Overall, nice tripel, not quite what I expected, but I would try again."
"Overall, the flavors in here are good, but the brew lacks a certain vivacity and uniqueness that would set it apart from its competitors, and the sugary flavors tend to fade during subsequent sips."
"This is a really nice beer. There's a blend of flavors, and none overwhelm, they just blend into a nice complexity. Beers like this are one reason I love triples, and I would definitely try this one again."
"Drink - (3.5/5) I though this one tasted a lot like their blonde and certainly didn't make me think 'tripel.' It was also a bit too malty for my liking and didn't really have a lot of complexity."
"The body is light and finishes dry. Some carbonic bite. Some minor heat but ok. Overall a good triple but would like a touch more esters and phenols."
"Overall: While it lacks a great mouthfeel, this beer makes up for it by holding the alcohol and sugary sweetness in check; too many tripels, I find, suffer on both of those fronts"
"Overall, a solid tripel. I didn't expect the grain flavors, but they were enjoyable. Decent drinkability."
"O: decent tripel, pretty impressive for buying at a chain grocery store"
"overall a very nice Tripel, I would definitely have again though it isn't the best Tripel I've ever had"
"The higher alcohol is completely masked with this easy-drinking (if slightly generic) tripel. Good, but didn't really wow me."
" Overall- Love it,would do it again"
"Overall. Pretty decent. I wouldn't exactly rave about this to anybody, but I'm satisfied. I might even get another if it was on sale or something."
"D - This is a really good brew and I love a good Belgian Tripel."
"Huge two inch head over clear, yellow colored beer. Smells of spices, yeasts. A bit weaker smell than most trippels though. Tastes of bananas, spices, yeast. More sweet than bitter. The 9% ABV is completely disguised. For a high ABV it's very drinkable. Slightly too sweet and cloying at times in the aftertaste, and that's the only thing holding it back on drinkability."
"I do recommend this for certain, it brings a much cheaper price tag than many others n its class yet it is a competitor nonetheless. love getting my Money's worth."
"I bought this beer almost exactly 4 years ago and never got around to drinking it until now. Pours an orange color with a small khaki head. Aroma is buttery, indicating diacetyl, but we later decided that it was probably oxidative effects. Caramel butterscotch flavor, not really much classic tripel ester character. It has a bit of that sweet sherry taste that some oxidated beers get. Sorta oversweet and flabby. Not a great candidate for aging, apparently."
"O- Not bad but very much pedestrian. Still a decent value for money though"
"The beer is hazy and light orange in color. The head is smallish and generates a good amount of lacing on the glass. The beer is bready with a healthy amount of citrus flavors. Alcohol presence asserts itself throughout, though on the whole, I find it unoffensive. This beer is bold, assertive, and quite tasty. The body is medium / thick with a warming finish. Another fine example of a Belgian tripel."
"A cutting and barely staining texture. Not sharp as a tack but still cleansing. Would pair well with BBQ. More bubbles than your standard soda. Just heavier than medium bodied."
"D- Quite."
"D - The beer is not bad but not the best either. Quite enjoyable and easy to drink but not a repeat."
"A respectable and more affordable Belgian tripel. I could drink this at almost any time of day."
"I wasn't impressed with this too much. Poured into a rocks glass, shared with others, it poured an opaque, brownish color with big old floaties in it. Smells strong and sweet, of fruits, booze. the taste follows through with a maltier profile and a thick mouth feel with that alcohol presence noted in throat and nasal passages. It was an okay beer, but leaves more to be desired."
"D= Was a pleasant beer to drink. Enjoyed it through the evening. Will definalty drink it again."
"Anyways, highly recommended. Most excellent for sure. And quite a bit cheaper here in Boston than many other fine Belgians. (US$9) Happy New Year everyone!"
"This is fairly enjoyable, but I find the yeast profile somewhat overbearing."
"From the 750 ml. corked bottle staamped 10-113-12. Sampled on December 10, 2010. The pour is a slightly hazy pale yellow with excited carbonation bubbling upward to a two inch fluffy white head that diminishes with time. Good sedimentary deposits. The aroma is a mixture of malts, biscuit, yeast, spice, and overripe fruit. However the alcohol is more noted in the taste than I would have hoped. I prefer my Belgians to be smooth, yeasty, and slightly hopped. It is all of that but the alcohol comes up a bit much."
"D: This is a very nice beer. The lightness makes it go down easily. Its warmth makes it a perfect accompaniment to a cold night. A most excellent pickup."
"Overall a great example of this style. A worthy brew! Would tip a few more if not for the 9.5% abv"
"D- Easy to drink. No alc taste to it. Very good but not great."
"Amber disorder. Nose is an individual who is the beautiful part in yeast. Mouth alcohol in many flavors. However, it is interesting to note that alcohol is quite large (logic for a beer of this ABV) is fading fast enough to leave his room for various flavors. The body is oily but with a touch sour probably due to the sweet orange. Finally, we have a round mouth with a final syrupy. Good beer tasting."
"A Tripel with a mission: to stay on style and be within the front of the pack. Mission ac- complished-- equal to the Trappist Tripels for sure."
"Definitely a must-try, if not a regular indulgence."
"D: Seeing as Belgian tripels are my go-to style, I'll call this one as pretty drinkable to me. It's not my favorite tripel (I'd put Westmalle Tripel at the top of the list and Victory's Golden Monkey above this but not by a huge margin), but I'd not hesitate for a second if offered more of it."
"D - An easy-going tripel that leans towards the sweeter side of the style. A fair example with nice drinkability."
"Affligem Tripel from a 750mL bottle with a champagne style cork. It poured a real hazy wheat color with a half finger white head. A big bread dough nose. I don't get much more than that on the nose. So far I'm a little disappointed in the appearance and smell. There it is....this beer makes up for it on the first sip. I get a lot of clove and some Belgian style yeast and some spices. There is some alcohol heat right away and I feel it the entire time. The second sip brings a nutty slightly rubbery taste. It's good but just not my style of beer. I still can appreciate and respect this quality Belgian beer."
"D: I was surprised by how much I liked this beer. Even as it reached room temp, the high ABV never became apparent."
"Drinkability: it's good, but some of the flavors just don't work for me. Frankly, I won't likely seek this out again. Of course, I will finish this bottle, however."
"It seems that Westmalle is hard to beat."
"Drinkability is excellent."
"jd"
"D-This beer goes down expceptionally well for it being 9.5% abv. I highly recommend this beer to any real beer lover."
"Overall - A pretty good if fairly run of the mill Tripel... worth a try though..."
"D: I don't think I've ever had this tripel, and I've known about it for almost 5 years. It's really good and the 750s are still in the $7-8 range so it's definitely worth a pickup. Good stuff."
"D: Deviously easy to drink considering its alcohol content. It has a complex flavor that rises quickly and goes away after a few beats, enticing you back for more. Nothing that blows me away here, but its definitely a solid tripel. The fact that it was a few dollars cheaper than most of the other tripels available won some points with me, too."
"Tasty and light. A good trippel. Would have again."
"Taste is slightly citrus fruity, strong vanilla and rich with sugary goodness. Alcohol burns off a bit on the back end. Surprisingly full bodied, smooth, and creamy. I'm got quite a bit of apple in this as well - all of these flavors balance nicely for a well-rounded tripel. Lots going on, and high ABV makes this drinkable beer one that isnt ideal more than a round."
"Drinkability: For this beer think subtle and complex rather than bold and upfront. Sipping this was easy and I'll probably be having this one to sample again. However, this is a beer to have on its own. If paired with food some of the subtleties of the beer will get lost in its interaction with the food."
"Poured hazy orange color with an average frothy white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Complex spicy fruit and yeasty aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium citrus balanced flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate to moderate duration with a small alcohol bite. This is a refreshing standout beer."
"A mediocre Belgian, I have had stellar examples and this pales."
"D: Drinks pretty easily and hides its ABV well, but the ABV is really too high to drink a bunch in a row."
"D: Like the Dubbel, I was not impressed at first, but the beer improved slightly as I drank it. However, with all the other great Tripels out there, not likely something I would seek again."
"I enjoyed this beer in a goblet style glass with cheese and fruit...its dry enough to suit most cheeses and fruit goes well with it...it's only so complex so as a general rule, it easily compliments many foods foods yet only enhances them to a point."
"Not bad, kids of crisp, has a tangy taste with a peppery finish. Poured from the bottle an unfiltered gold color with a thick white head which very quickly disappeared. Smells somewhat like fresh citrus (though that could be related to the cold I have at the moment. Am enjoying this bottle with some cheese covered crackers (mozzerella and aged cheddar on some melba toast whole grain) This one is good enough I'd drink it again, a very smooth beer."
"Overall, a decent bottle of beer. Would come back to this one every now and then. Good value at about $9.00/bottle. Cheers!"
"Light body, relatively heavy carbonation for the style IMO. Drinkability is higher than some other tripels, but not a brew that struck me as great."
"Mmmm...nothing is wrong with this beer, that's for sure! In my oppinion, an under-rated beer. Light citrus fruits, cloves, mild booze, and a nice spice mixed in. Medium mouthfeel...and delicious. Carbonation looked high due to a few bubbles along the glass, but it was just right."
"Overall I love this beer. I am a big fan of Affligem Blonde, and this is a step above! This is a good example of a Tripel. Not heavy at all an true to style and form. Recommended."
"This bottle was a gift from a good friend, and that always makes it extra special. Thanks!"
"Pours with a nice light golden color with a slightly opaque body. The head from the beer was very light and fluffy. I really enjoyed the smell from this, the fruits, hops and malt really blended well together. The taste for me only confirmed the smells, can definitely taste the fruits used but I can't identify which. Definitely more citrusy fruits. The feel from it is very nice, although the alcohol conent keeps it from being a highly drinkable beer."
"Peachy blonde with a fluffy ivory head that melts slowly and leaves crusty rings of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is beautiful on this one, white fleshed fruit and citrus with dry champagne yeast and mild coriander and pepper. Crisp and flavorful with slightly puckery, sweet and sour fruity esters and a dry brut champagne quality. Alcohol is well hidden. Medium bodied with a bright, seltzery carbonation. A classic example of the style and highly drinkable."
"I would enjoy again."
"A very tasty, drinkable tripel. I found the alcohol was muted fairly well and didn't affect the overall experience. Well done."
"All in all a good representation of the style."
"Drinkability - Could be served on a special occasion like when your inlaws are over... JK. Good all around ale."
"D: Decent beer, but it didn't wow me. I perfer the dubble and blonde from Affligem."
"Lightly sweet and prickly to the mouth the beer transitions nicely into a dry, evaporative finish. A great beer, however the breweries distinctive water leaves the beer a bit too minerally and metalic in the end."
"Taste was strong Belgian hops. There is some lemon citrus as well. The finish is rather hoppy as well. This beer had a little watery taste to it. Overall this is a pretty good beer. There are better tripels."
"D: I could drink another 750 ml, which is saying volumes considering the relatively high abv, but I'm sure I'd pay for it the next day. Nonetheless, an extremely drinkable brew even though it's probably not a session beer. Definitely a really good sipper."
"Overall a very nice Belgian I got the last bottle of it in the place, Cyclone liquors in Ames, IA."
"Smell and taste are fresh and clean. Malts and hops like the best of tripels. Next to that there is the spicy finish, and the absence of alcoholburn makes this a top triple indeed."
"A very nice, fairly inexpensive Belgian tripel, mostly made from ingredients local to where it is brewed. I find it strange that Heineken owns any monastic ales, but such are the times we live in..."
"Now, I'm kind of surprised that for seven dollars I can get a real Belgian that's still so good. I'm willing to pay the extra two-three bucks for a bigger beer, but the affordability will be a factor for some folks. Props to these guys."
"I could see this one being a go-to tripel for me, at a pretty good price."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable, solid, balanced beer. Not as available as some Belgians here in the ATL area, which is a pity. Decent price for the style. I look forward to visiting this tripel again!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, with a super big, creamy white head. Smells of alcohol, malt, and a bit of pepper. Taste is dry, but not as dry as some tripels, light malt character, yeast esters, and some spices. A hint of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is rich, super high carbonation though, a bit excessive. Drinkability was good, not as good as some tripels, but worth a try for fans of the style. Super expensive though for a 750ml bottle. Not sure if I will get this again because of the price."
"D - This is a great example of a tripel that is reasonably priced. Slightly citrus flavored for me buy not a problem."
"this beer was pretty good considering the price i was expecting something less! this beer came out with a huge white head half a chimay head it was a yellow color beer with white head and had hints of citrus and fruit very very refreshing and i could drink alot on a hot day"
"T - I really liked this beer, and Tripels are among my favorite styles, but this one falls behind some of the others in its class, but still in a pinch, this one would work perfectly"
"It's a bit sweet and spicy and has just the right amount of abv to be drinkable, and get your money's worth!"
"Smells a little yeasty with ripe banana. Nice carbonation, grainy on the tongue with a sweet maltiness, spice, pears, then with a nice bitterness that clears nicely on the tongue."
"Notes: Really glad that I kept this bottle (and that it survived the trip) so that I could enjoy it this evening."
"i really enjoyed this with caramelized tiger prawns, glass noodles and jasmine rice."
"The high alcohol content and $9 price tag keep this from being an everyday beer, but I'll definitely pick up this kickass tripel from time to time."
"750 shared with the dirtman at Granville Moore's in the District"
"drinkability: good"
"Boys and girls, this is a dangerous beer. Hides its alcohol exceedingly well, which leads me to believe that these brewers did a great job in putting this together. Loved it till the very last drop. Cheers!"
"Beer poured a cloudy orange with a three finger fluffy head that is holding quite well. Nose is belgian, hints of apple and pear with euro grains. Taste is not overly complex but quite good, it is primarily apple and pear with hints of white pepper in the background. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth as the belgian yeast takes my palate for a smooth ride. Drinkability is good, alcohol was felt with the first sip but fades quickly to the background. Nice effort and not a bad beer to try for this price."
"Very solid beer in one of my favorite styles. This was one of the easier drinking beers of the style.. I would definitely have another."
"This Tripel pours a light honey color and has a pleasant nose of fresh fruit, stone fruits and honey. Wonderfully balanced with layered and complex flavors of honey malt, light spice and lots of bananas. A medium to heavy balance and mouthfeel and finish. A second bottle at the same tasting showed the same but with even more flavors of malt, honey and peaches. A wonderfully drinking ale, one that could set a standard by which others could be judged."
"OVERALL: A very enjoyable triple, and the spicy qualities are quite unique in the style. Went down scarily easy for 9.5%. One I wouldn't hesitate picking up again. Recommended."
"The smell and taste are a bit spicier than I was expecting...nice. This meshes perfectly with some great carbonation and a nice light body and finish. Overall this is a very well rounded brew, true to style, and delicious. This beer is one of the easiest drinking tripels I have had, so one should be careful."
"D= Great to share as it is best as a sipper."
"overall a pretty good tripel. a little on the sweet side but good."
"Versatile, delicious, and a great value, this might be my new go-to trip."
"Nicely done example of the style. I'm coming to the conclusion that, while I do enjoy a good tripel, I""m not a huge tripel fan. But this one is well done and to style."
"Honey colour, yellow/orange, plenty of carbonation with suspended yeast. Generous two finger white head, sheet lace. Smell of yeast. Bitter sour notes in the mouth, grapefruit, citrus, passion fruit. Dry despite a smooth, thick, foamy mouthfeel. With warming and air, there is over ripe fruit, sourness again, but it seems a bit off balance. Overall, I can't say I really enjoyed this example of a Tripel, mediocre was my impression."
"One of the best Tripel's I have had. Highly recommended."
"Overall this is one of my favorite tripels, and it's usually a good bargain ($6 for a 750ml). Perfect for a nice sunday afternoon working in the sunshine and breeze."
"Drinkability- High. This is a belgian I'll be sure to pick up again."
"Brouwerij Affligem has been brewing since 1074. That's no guarantee of quality, of course, but one bottle of their beer is enough to convince anyone with a palate of their zymurgistic talents. The proof, as they say, is in the pudding. Or in this case, in the tripel."
"Poured hazy peach color. Very little head, minor lacing. Aroma is kind of like a toasted malt but slightly fruity. Taste is not as fruity or citruslike that I am used to in this type. Somewhat neutral tasting. Nicely balanced with no overwhelming notes of sweetness or bitterness. Nice full nouthfeel. Good finish. Very good drinkability."
"I was not impressed at all by this and I know there are much better options of Tripel's out there."
"Notes: This is not the best Tripel I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good. Very authentic Belgian that delivers enough depth of flavor and complexity to keep me interested. Definitely worth a shot if you love tripels."
"Probably one of my favorites of the style overall, seconded to Chimay's tripel, though I wish the taste were a bit more complex."
"Notes: Very good. Not my absolute favorite, but would definintely drink again and try other brews by Affligem"
"Definitely one I'd have again, but I doubt that I'll have the chance since this was a special deal received from a bar owner who had a friend with a bunch of Affligem gift-packs to try to ""get rid of"". The 4 pack had one dubbel, one trppel, and two regular ole Affligem Blondes."
"D: Not the best tripel I've had and the lingering bad aftertaste isn't nice. I'll drink this beer, but I probably will not buy again unless its a good deal."
"The drinkability took a bit of a hit in that it came only in a larger bottle and with its high ABV, you would find yourself hard pressed to drink too mcu out of one bottle without getting a bit too much for your own good."
"Taste is a bit of a letdown from the nose, but that was expected. Yet it wasn't much of a letdown by any means and improves with a little warming. More yeast and citrus, clove and cinnamon. A decent dose of malts but not overdone by any means. Feel and finish segue seamlessly, nicely done. Good drinkability within the style. Not overly malty, yet sufficient to keep the alcohol off the tongue. A bit present on the nose perhaps, but it ends there."
"D: I'm not sure if this is 9.5 or 8.5 but in either case its a nice drinkable tripple."
"D - Very smooth and easy drinking beer."
"Nice 750mL bottle sat at proper temperature for a couple days, but upon undoing the cork, an effervesence of foam poured upward for nearly a minute. Yummy but unstable...The pour was more stable; fluffy white head settled thickly. As it sat, it lessened & remained with nice white lace through the course. The color was a fine dark golden honey with a sweet honey-flower-malt aroma. The flavor likewise was such, with hints of spice that stuck in the nose, and a lingering alcohol on the sides of the tongue. Soft crisp bubbles maintained troughout and helped bring out a slight rum flavor. Very smooth and drinkable, yet with a sharpness and alcohol that seemed to travel faster into one's head."
"This is very drinkable, but there's just not a lot of character compared to other Belgian-style beers. Worth a try."
"Pours a golden orange with a dense off-white head of short duration. A very thin blanket of lace lingers around the goblet, just above the brew. A good amount of sediment is suspended in the brew as a few bubbles float to the top haphazardly. Big notes of sweet and sour bread, light fruits, yeast and spice drift to the nose. A slight medicinal aspect is also noted. Tastes fruity, sugary, slighty tangy and a bit dry at first. Further exploration reveals a good almost creamy base mixed with more sweet bread, funky yeast, some nutmeg, and some furtive phenols. Carbonation is excellent, keeping the mouth-feel toward the middle of medium. The alcohol is well blended, and almost unnoticeable until the very end. Tripels like these remind me why it's my favorite style."
"D - This is a sipping beer. Drink as though it were a fine wine, a sip at a time. It is best when it is following a forkfull of gravy-draped turkey, the palate cleansing qualities really will shine through."
"First beer from this brewery. Not horrid but there are just so many other good tripels out there I would fly with."
"There isn't a lot of malt character, like say a Tripel Karmeliet, but the mellow fruit esters, spicy phenol, and earthy hops provide more than enough character. The aroma, however, does hint at bready malt. Otherwise, the flavor starts light and mild with white grapes and white pepper. Then after a moment, big citrus rind and grassy hops kick in. Yum. Very tasy and very drinkable. There are more complex tripels, no doubt, but this is still a fine beer."
"The aroma has light fruit, yeast, sugar, and perfume. The appearance is golden with a light haze and a huge head that keeps lasting. The flavor is like the aroma with some bitterness. The palate is thin. I like this one but it definitely isn't great."
"D: Good drinkability."
"Very satisfying overall, and definitely worth another visit."
"Pours a very bubbly, golden yellow clearish color. Big head with fine bubbles. An aroma of dark fruit, plum and citrus. Rich, but not very strong. Bubbly taste, citrus, and some alcohol. Not very complex. Very light tasting but not much flavor."
"the drinkability is good due in part to a silky mouthfeel and a complementary creamy flavor. overall very nice tripel that doesn't pull any punches."
"What an experience. Not the best Tripel I've had but arguably one of the more interesting. If the world of Tripels could be likened to middle-aged men in suites Affligem is wearing tennis shoes."
"Not a bad beer, overall pored a pale yellow, and a small head. Smelled of a yeasty, slightly nutty aroma and of some fruits.Tasted very carbonated, unusually high. Champaign like.HAd a fruit like taste, but a very dry finish.Kinda weird. Anyway, very drinkable, but wasn't my favorite. Drank as I watcch the Cowboy/Eagles game."
"A nice looking beer with a pretty good head. It smells and tastes just great. There's so much going on in the smell and taste in a good tripel like this. I feel rather unqualified to analyze it all. There's a distinct and wonderful yeasty backbone to the beer with a sweet, dry finish. The flavor is also somewhat spicy but I couldn't pinpoint it. The mouthfeel is also quite good. The carbonation is bracing without going overboard. I could drink beer like this all day. It's a bit strong for that, but I'd settle for nursing one after dinner."
"Very good. Tripels are fast becoming one of my favorite styles and this is a great example."
"D= Not the best Belgian tripel, but still a great one. If you can find it on tap, it is even more impressive."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a real nice foamy head. Aroma is citrus fruits, yeasty and a little grainy. This is easy drinking with the flavors I've come to expect from a good Belgian Triple. It's got a nice spicy, yeasty, citrus fruity flavor with a mild sour note and a clean finish. The alcohol content is hardly noticed (until your body tells you) unless you let the beer warm quite a bit. I have to be honest I got sick of it halfway through the bottle (750ml bottle) but maybe that's because I've had too many Triples lately. Even as I did work my way through the bottle that foam remains on top which produces a nice amount of lacing."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable for 8.5% A nice beer thats not too hard to find."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Duvel tulip. Lots of carbonation of the bat, creating a big 3finger head on top of a clear golden brew. Notes of pilsener malts in the nose, slight fruitiness, and slightly sweet. Taste follows suit. A bit of apple cider, some perfumey floral notes, sweet in the middle, and dry on the finish. Lots of carbonation keeps this one crisp from beginning to end. An excellent brew, but tastes for like a golden ale than a tripel to me."
"Nothing wrong, but it is just another triple to tick off as having tried."
"I saw that this was three dollars less than its normal price, so I bought it solely for that reason, will probably go back and get the dubbel soon too, first beer from this brewery and it was not bad, probably will not drink again unless it is this sales price or cheaper, recommended"
"d: a decent triple but a little underwhelming in terms of flavor"
"A lovely tripel. Not the finest the world has to offer, but undoubtedly superior to 90% of the American versions of the style. Lovely, hungry Belgian yeast...worth a try for sure."
"Pours out a nice golden color with a thick, white head that leaves good lace...the head stays intact the whole way down. It has strong sugar and fruit characteristics in the nose along with ample amounts of spices. The taste is very crisp. Sugar, hops, spices and malted barely are the main players in the taste. Good beer...nice example of a tripel."
"While it would seem age has been of detriment to this beer, my opinions of it have not changed. There is no question in my mind the beer is better off fresh, although my enjoyment of it tonight was really no different then the few times I've had it fresh. Affligem is certainly not the best example of Belgium's abbey breweries, and with such a plethora of them, there is no reason you should settle for this particular one. That being said, you wouldn't be so hard done by if you had to..."
"It began gushing out of the bottle moments after I opened it. The beer poured into a pint glass with a thick white head atop a golden body. It's a really nice looking beer. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy with light carbonation, and the smell had a nice musky funk to it. I enjoyed it quite a bit.. more than I expected to really."
"The flavor, like the aroma, also changed fairly dramatically as the beer had time to sit in the chalice. It began quite harsh. Sour fruits meshed with strong alcohol. Apple and peach. Spice profile is very intense. However, as it rested the flavor mellows greatly, giving way to a lessened intensity of all the aforementioned flavors and a robust caramel maltyness. What was initially sharp and eye opening is now the quintessential sipping beer. Not a traditional tripel by any means, as it is much darker and richer. Let this beer sit for 5-10 minutes and enjoy."
"The 8.5% ABV is hidden well with this beer, as the yeast and the spices in there combine for a sharp but smooth passing over the tongue. There is some clove and lemon zest/orange (also tasted apple) in there for that Triple flavoring, along with possibly pepper and clove. A warm, semi-dry finish. I normally don't rate high ABV's with such drinkability, but for the price you can't go wrong buying a bottle of this and just relaxing with this beer. Not the greatest triple but a solid example."
"Poured from a 750 ml cage corked bottle into a pint glass as it was the only thing I could find at the apartment I was staying. Golden color with light foamy head. Left a great deal of lacing. The aroma was sweet and with some fruits. Full flavored, fruits and sugars. When nearing the end more yeast can be noticed. Alcohol is hidden well with a crisp dry finish."
"From a 750 ml bottle that seemed like opening a bottle of wine this poured a cloudy orange with a fat off-white head and copious lacing the smoothly coated the Affligem glass as it settled. Nose of yeast and fruit, and a mouthfeel that is rich and creamy. Flavors of fruits, grass, and spices Dry finish."
"A nice tripel."
"Purchased a 750 ML caged and corked from Bottle King in Livingston... Golden-colored, apple-juice appearance with decent frothy head that soon receded... smell was loaded with sweet candies, fresh fruit, florals, and honey... taste paid homage to the aroma, with citrus, lemon, sugars, candies, honey, and florals... a very sweet, sugar-laden taste that lingers on the tongue and doesn't let go... this beer is extremely rich and thick for a Tripel... very sweet, full of sugar... good thick and full-flavored mouthfeel, but drinkability took a hit due to the slightly cloying, ultra-sweet flavor... Overall, this is a top-notch Belgian Tripel... true to the style, authentic, full-flavored, and satisfying... Definitely recommended..."
"Sweet grapefruit, yeast, and apple dominate the aroma, some in there pepper too. Pours a clearish golden color with a slightly off-white head. Flavor is okay with a sour finish. Mouthfeel was kind of dry with lively carbonation. Very average for a Belgian Tripel."
"This is a decent Tripel but wouldn't be the first one I grabbed for given a choice of several. I'm curious to try some of the other products in the Affliigem line to see if that peculiar taste is present."
"D - I generally prefer my beers to have more flavors and not taste of alcohol."
"Really enjoyed this, a fairly easy-drinking tripel with some really nice fresh flavours."
"D - A nice Tripel that hits all the checkmarks but doesn't thrill you. Worth checking out, especially if its easy to find. Alcohol is well hidden."
"A great beer, and something Ill pick up again. Not one of the top five Tripels, but up there."
"A good strong trippel. Pours clear and carbonation with chunks of yeast rather than cloudiness, so be careful on the pour. Good head and appetizing nose. Lacks the standard belgian trippel creamy spiciness, but is still quite good. very warming and refreshing at the same time with some nut flavors and bright citrus flavors on the finish. Good beer."
"Tastes of spices, yeast, the hops add just the right amount of bitterness and they are balanced by a touch of pale malt."
"D- Not my usual session style, but nice."
"Reviewed 11-14-2007, translated from french 1-12-2008."
"I love Affligem Blonde, and was expecting this to be an improvement on that beer. This is a nice beer but nothing great"
"Overall a good tasting beer, very drinkable."
"D - I would have rated the drinkability higher however I don't believe I could drink too many of these at a time. This is kind of a desert beer, something to be enjoyed after a good dinner. A glass or two would probably be the max I would drink at one time. Even with ABV aside, this is no session beer :)."
"Poured into a snifter from a corked bottle. The beer pours a hazy orange, forming a very thin head of bubbles, without any lacing. The aroma is very much like fruit flavored candy. Sweet and light. The taste is light fruit, apples mostly, a hint of alcohol, and a good balance of hops and malts. The mouthfeel is light and smooth. A very drinkable tripel. Overall, not a bad Belgian tripel. Not as full flavored as some, but still a good brew. Definitely worth a try!"
"D: A very good tripel. Very drinkable."
"Overall: I really like it. It will move into the rotation of my Belgian brews from this day forward. It has such a wonderful feel about it. I love the way that it hangs around my mouth after each gulp. There is a wonderful harmony of sweetness, spice, and citrus. Those monks sure know what they are doing. This one is surely some of gods best work."
"Pretty drinkable. I could easily finish the 750 without sharing. A decent but not great triple."
"Very drinkable. Not quite on a par with St. Feuillien or St. Bernardus."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. The color is a hazy mud puddle brown color with a hint of orange. Big pillow white head that dissipated slowly and left some real nice chunk lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell is of Belgian candi sugar and green apples. The taste is of clove, green apples, a bit medicinal, slightly metallic. The feel is slightly over carbonated, the fizziness kills the taste some. A good tripel worthy of a try, on the sour/tart side for a tripel"
"Cork exploded to ceiling, pours a five+ finger smooth cream head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Flavor sweet and tart, finish is tart. Tastes different from the last time I had this in 12/2001. $6.22 for a 750ml bottle from Smiley's Beverages Dover, NH."
"Poured a darkish gold into an oversized wine glass. Big, fluffy white head almost overflows the glass. Aroma is bread, cloves, pepper, and mild sour fruits. Standard, but good. Flavour is quite sweet, with some fruity sourness in the background. A little bit of coffee or chocolate in there among the spices. Mild pine, as well, which is unusual I think. Good, solid mouthfeel (although nothing special) and a sour aftertaste that I actually liked."
"Drinkability- Not great, but not bad. Not a big fan of Belgians."
"This is a standard, tasty tripel cocktail, with a fun twist of Belgian balls. At the least this beer will bring a grin to one's face. The ABV would explain the happy swimming glow in my head. Still, the bottle drains just fine. No knock on exceptional, but sometimes very good is good enough."
"Cheers!"
"All in all, a decent Triple. Nothing to write home about, but worth a try. There are much better triples out there, but it's worth the $8 or so it costs."
"750 ml. bottle- color of light gold , with a great frothy white color head - nose of yeast , orange , spices , and honey  taste of yeast , orange zest , candied , molasses , mild hops , and a nice sweetness - body of high carbonation , and creamy with a hint of acidity  aftertaste of sweet apples , spices , and orange"
"The usual 750ml bottle. Poured into a small snifter glass. Very even hazy golden yellow color. Looks juicy. BIG fluffy and pillowy head which never disappeared entirely. A somewhat sloppy lacing remained in the glass as I drank this. Aroma starts out nice with some notes of bananas, pear and apples and then finishes off with a bit of alcohol. This beer tastes just like it smells too. Fruity up front and alcohol at the back. There's a nice bit of clove and yeasty character in this as well. Pretty tart and crisp in the end. Nice and refreshing for a tripel. Light carbonation spritzes up the mouthfeel pretty nicely. Not a bad tripel at all."
"A decent Tripel. For the money i would rather save the trip across the atlantic and drink a La Fin Du Monde"
"I cellared this for a year, but I do not know how old the bottle was when I purchased it. I want to try a fresher bottle as I feel this one may been on the decline. Either way, tasty and easy to drink."
"Corked and caged 750 mL bottle. Poured into my Duvel tulip. Wow, crystal clear beer with a huge foaming head that slowly settles not leaving much lacing. Nice column of fizz rising from the center of the bottom just like Duvel. The smell is slightly yeasty and sweet. The taste is of fresh ripe citrus, buttery and peppery. Slightly dry at the end. The alcohol is concealed very well. This is a very good tripel in my opinion."
"Taste starts off very mellow with some banana like phenols complimenting the apple and pear notes that were in evidence in the nose. Very yeasty as well, and the whole thing reminds me of some fresh and delicious baking. The whole thing finishes tart and crisp. Very flavourful, clean, uncomplicated, and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and thick, there's lots of tasty malt in there. Finish is lightly drywith some of the more sour notes playing in the aftertaste. This is an uncomplicated and well balanced brew that would insanely sessionable if not for the 8.5 abv. Certainly the best I've had from this brewery."
"Great beer, but because of the yeast I think a lot of Americans would be terrified to open the bottle."
"Pours out a tangerine cloudy colour. Not much head retention for belgian which surprised me. Some lacing on side of glass. Smell is typical sweet belgian. Taste is sweet and fruity, not too spicy. Fairly middle of the road from a flavour profile. Highly drinkable for the ABV. I think this could be a good gateway beer for folks that think Leffe is the end all and be all of belgian brews. Would drink again, but wouldn't go out of my way. Purchased as part of a gift pack that came with a decent glass."
"Hardly my favorite Tripel. Though it has quite an enjoyable smell, it really falls down where the taste is concerned. Not bad as a beer, but hardly an outstanding Tripel. As with other Affligem beers, it's really only worth getting if you love trying different Belgian beers."
"This is a smooth and creamy beer that goes down real easy for it's high ABV. If I was daring enough, I could drink two bottles of this."
"Best-before number is incomrehensible, but likely a new bottle. Cork pops out explosively, and foam flows up over the top before I can stop it. On pour, it comes out a very cloudy gold with a colossal head of airy foam. Nose is quite fruity, with touch of apricot and honey and a light plum note. Taste is also fruity, but it mixes with an earthy, gritty bitterness and a pungent acidity for a refreshing but complex beer. Alcohol is notable in the finish as well, peppery and warming."
"Bottom line: This is a very tasty and yet smooth drinking Tripel that I'd gladly get again. I recommend it."
"Poured froma 750ml bottle that is labeled differently than the example picture ... a nice lively amber orange color with a relentless bright white head that would not die. High carbonation levels in this beer. Nose is of spices, yeast and candy sugar. Very ""tripel-like."" Palate is extremely spritzy, with finely balanced hop character and sweet sugar. Slightly fruity, and yeasty. Residual spiciness. Mouthfeel is aggressively carbonated ...alomost too much so. Medium/light body and some alcohol warmth in the mouth. Over all, a good tripel. Somehwat unchallenging and maybe a tab too light, due in part to the rabid carbonation, but a very drinkable, enjoyable abbey tripel."
"There's a lot going on, smell and taste are strong and interesting, but not unconditionally enjoyable. Can be a little cloying, and the extra bacteria in here aren't good at making first impressions. The copy on the bottle dubs this a ""Belgian Burgundy," is this a veiled brett warning?"
"Overall, if you want a tripel that is very easy to drink, and still has a decent amount of flavor and a crisp clean taste, this is your beer."
"There are a lot of reviews on this beer already. I'd add to the discourse that this is the driest tripel I've ever had. It's a nice brew and a great drinking beer."
"I really enjoy this tripel...it is the softest, smoothest tripel I have yet experienced. I will have to keep a bottle around to compare with tripels in the future."
"Pretty decent beer, but sharper than I remembered, which seriously influences my rating."
"This pours a cloudy golden amber like color with a huge white head. The smell has a candy sugar, yeast, and ""bisquit"" aroma. The taste is a crisp dry sweet sugar beer with hints of clove, wood, and fruit. The m/f is light and very creamy with a dryness that is very good. This is a very good beer, very sugary sweet, but still a classic Belgium Tripel that you must try."
"I might buy it again for six bucks, but I'd really rather spend $7 for Chimay blue. (Gotta love northern California.)"
"as far as the mouthfeel goes...where did it go?"
"Lastly this bottle is stamped best before 02 28 03. I felt that this was still a good beer maybe the appearance suffered from the time."
"Mouthfeel is of caramel sugar and some spices lingering about. It was ok."
"Orange with a fairly attractive and creamy head of foam that shows an attractive lace. The aroma, though subtle, shows a bit of citrus fruits, dough, orange and lemon. Initially, on the front palate, the flavor is a bit ghastly but things turn in the mid-palate as notes of caramel, sugared fruit and butter toffee begin to develop. A bit sweet, especially on the finish, but overall, this beer is pretty characterful and a stark improvement compared to the brewers Dubbel."
"if you see an 8 year old bottle pick it up ! I'll be damned if 1 foot of snow is stopping me from running out tommorow and grabbing up one more of these to share with friends soon... I have to say I was very surprised by this one, I half expected it to be skunk city..."
"Bottle aged ~2 years or so, pours a very hazy orange/amber, big white head forms, refuses to leave, makes a volcano in the middle of the chalice, super lacing, some of the best I've ever seen when these Affligems are aged a couple years, its ridiculous. Smell is sweet, some spices and honey, little bit of almost skunkiness, yeast. Taste is very rich, honey and spice, yeast, orange peel, sweet spicy finish, little bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, high carbonation but the aging has made it buttery smooth, a real treat, this one ages surprisingly well."
"Drinkability: Not the most flavourful or robust tripel, which may actually add to the drinkability. Alcohol is well hidden, and the muted flavours make it easy to take."
"Hazy and dark gold in colour with strong carbonation. Aromas of citrus fruit, peach, bready malts, and a touch of spicy yeast. Heavier in the mouth and more malt flavors than other tripels that Ive sampled. More of the orange and baked bread in the mouth, along with some sugary sweetness, herbal hops, and some black pepper. Well hidden alcohol presence. Very enjoyable."
"The mouth is just a bit too prickly from the carbonation and tangy flavors, but I like it. In light of its merits this is a very drinkable triple."
"D: Higher alcohol than some tripels, but it's not over-powering. Dangerously drinkable!"
"Hazed gold with a thin white head that leaves behind some nice lacing. Spicy yeast aroma backed up by breadiness and fruit, light on the citrus. Candy sugar sweetness with some fruit and citrus, especially as it warms. Finishes with a peppery spiciness and alcohol warmth that's a bit on the hot side. Very high carbonation, slight stickiness and slickness. Not bad, but doesn't seem very balanced or refined."
"I thought it was a good beer but it was just a tad to sweet and cloying for me to pick it up again over many other belg. trips out there."
"A thicker, sweeter interpretation of the style that I enjoyed."
"Smells extremely sweet- raisins, mostly. Some other dark fruits. Mellows out a bit after it warms up. Taste is one word- SWEET. Raisins raisins raisins. After the first few sips I thought, ho shit I just ate a mouthful of raisins soaked in sugar for 5 days! But it also mellows out after a while. The taste grows on you. Mouthfeel is bubbly, and more refreshing than I thought it would be once I found out how sweet it was. Overall fairly drinkable, better when warmed up, but beware cavities."
"Opinion: This is a good beer. I prefer some other Tripels over this one, but it is definitely one to checkout. The alcohol was a little more noticeable in this one. This trait is normally pretty well masked, though this beer is on the high end of the scale at 8.5%."
"This ale pours a tawny brown color like muddy water. Nice white lacing. Nice aroma of dried fruit. Taste is fruity also, peaches/cherries and bready. Alcohol is noticeable in the finish. A pretty good belgian, but like previous reviewer, I agree that is beer is less complex in flavor profile than some other trippels I've had."
"Very drinkable, not as complex as I had hoped, but I am very pleased with this Belgium beer."
"A fine quality Belgium ale, rather strong alcohol and feels it, for a lunch. Lots of foam, orange colour, some lace. Yeasty. Citrus orange yeasty taste. Not a bad brew from this brewery so far. Sweet and spicy finish, with cardomon, cinammon and clove."
"Pours a hazy, orangish-yellow color and has a fat white head. It's aroma is spicy and fruity and has a definite clove presence along with musty yeast aromas. It's flavor is spicy and fruity also and while it has plenty of alcohol it hides it well. All in all it is a good bier and quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: I think trips are one of the, if not THE, most drinkable styles out there. This one is no exception. Very solid, very ""right," although there's not that special something that makes it stand out. But overall, very good and a bit of a value to boot."
"The mild tones in this one are more to my liking for the triple style and favors a very decorous drinkability from start to finish. Great subtle, milder tones, and flavors to it that really make for a nice treat. Recommended."
"Not a bad beer. Nothing about it stands out to me, but nothing about it seems to be unpleasant."
"The ABV of this brew limits its drinkability for this BA."
"Poured from a brown 330 ml bottle that came along with an Affligem goblet gift pack, best before date on side of label: 21 09 06. A hazy apricot appearance to the body, big foamy white head with pockets of cinnamon here and there. Nice head retention. Peppery spice and candy sugar sweetness on the nose, with some pear and apple to hold it up. The flavour is subdued at first, mild, light spices in the beginning, pepper and clove, while a pear-like sweetness starts to build towards the finish. Tart esters on the finish, with a spicy black pepper aftertaste. Satin mouthfeel, rolls over the palate smoothly with some body to hold it up. Not watery like the dubbel. Not a tripel that I am itching to have again any time soon, from what I've sampled so far Affligem has gotten it right with their blonde, while everything else seems sub-par in comparison. Hopefully this tripel is better in their caged and corked version, I look forward to the opportunity to sample that as well."
"A solid and most enjoyable tripel. Too bad it loses some points due to it being so alcoholic. Still a decent brew though, and One that I'd recommend."
"Pours dull copper with thin white head that rides the beer to the bottom of the glass. Aroma is fruity and sweet, foreshadowing the flavor. Tastes like wine grapes, tart cherries, yeasty with fruity esters and malty sweetness. Alcohol is evident but not overwhelming. Seems to be maybe a little too carbonated. Overall pretty damn good."
"I'll have another, please."
"large bottle, caged and corked, no freshness dating to be found. Pours dull light yellow, cloudy and supporting a white head, that started fluffy and pillowy and then turns to 1/4 inch and regal with fine retentive powers. Tons o' lacing. Nose is bursting with peppery phenolic notes and cloves. Nice soft mouthfeel. Bold Belgian flavorings of yeasy nuttyness, cloves, and pepper. Ths is a full flavor, bold and enjoyable tripel. Amazing how a glass or two can lift the spirits and improve the quality of whatever food you want to pair it with. Readily available tripel, well worth a try."
"Pours a hazy orange colour, with a fluffy white head, gorgeous lacing. Aromas of fruit, yeast, and a little spice. A well made tripel, with fruity notes, deceptive alcohol and a wonderful malty sweetness. Taste was very nice, easy drinking, and the alcohol really kicks in. Finish is dry, and doesn't leave much of an aftertaste."
"Affligem has some nice beers. The one I like most is the tripel. Beautifull pour out wit a huge and lasting head. Colour is light bronze and perfectly clear for a botle fermented beer. Nose is a wonderfull mixture of yeastfruit, hops and malt. Probably litle koreander too. Taste is fresh and sweetmalty in the beginning before it gets into spicy and litle bitter aftertaste. Nice and clean bitterness make it a enjoyable beer I get back to every now and then."
"Comments - This is not the greatest of all tripels, but I strongly feel that it is worth a try."
"Not enough character to this one for my liking. Too much alcohol, too bitter without offering enough of anything else."
"75 cl. bottle opens with a champagne like pop of the cork. Cloudy honey orange hue with a big off white colored head. Has a spicy black pepper and vinous smell. Light to medium bodied with a bubbly mouthfeel. Flavor is of pepper, spices, oak barrel, and slightly yeasty. Finishes bone dry with a bittersweet champagne taste. A pretty good Triple."
"A good beer, though the alcohol is a little too pervasive in my opinion."
"Thick chunks of yeast in the bottle, freely floating, despite this bottle being stored upright for 2 weeks. The Affligem dubbel too had uncharacteristically large pieces of yeast. This should be all the vitamin B I need for today. Nice, rich golden hues, caramel, showing some orange tints near the edges of the glass. The head is a mixture of medium-sized and fine bubbles, and it seemed to recede quicker than Affligem's blond. Slow moving screens of lace, leaving web-like lacing. Nearly bright white foam. The aroma is definitely superior to the dubbel or blond. A strong citrus immediately, more roasted notes, some soap, faint perfume, perhaps the slightest dash of hop, adding a subtle floral quality. Sweet honey, musky grapes, and a definite spiciness that tickles the nose slightly when inhaled deeply. Some pear, banana, even raspberry, and a creamy vanilla smell. Taste is citrus up front, lemon and orange. Alcohol well-masked in the other flavours, though this feels more substantial in the mouth. Sourish malt notes near the middle, and leaving with a decent dryness, metallic, iron-like. No real hop flavour, only dry hop feel on the palate. Mostly the finish is musky, grainy, and yeasty. Great fruit on the long finish as well. Full bodied, and extremely lingering. Phenols make a show after a few sips, albeit slight. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a brisker carbonation than the dubbel or blond; and, for 8.5%, this goes down deceptively freely and quickly. After two bottles, however, I fear the dry dustiness would become a bit much for me. This would pair well with any sharp cheese, or a tomato sauce pasta. This is a respectable tripel, by any Belgian standard."
"Thanks to Mark at 3 Corners for this sample."
"Drinkability: Lower ABV than most Tripels means more control of faculties while ordering this beer again and again..."
"paired well with breaded oysters."
"Finally, the Tripel. Poured less hazy than expected, again no sendiment and a fluffy off-white head that laces well. Less spicy than the blond, but more banana and again a hint of citrus. Taste is smooth with a lot of banana and mild spice, with a very warming finish. I some ways is combines the best point of the Blond and the Dubbel, without the crispness and roasted malts of course. I really like the spicy warming aftertaste. Tonight was a very good night."
"This beautiful triple flowed from the bottle and created a lovely off-white head of 3 fingers over a hazy apricot-colored body. The nose is full of fruit and spice notes. These sensations repeat in the flavors of the brew with spice and bananas predominating. The feel is full with a nice creaminess despite the carbonation which is substantial. Good drinkability given the ABV."
"Poured from the bottle, the hazy orange sunset of a brew capped itself nicely with a fine white head. The aroma of bananas and spices was intriguing. Unfortunately, it seemed, as these notes didn't dominate the flavors. While banana and clove notes were present mixed with a huskiness and sour apple notes that made the brew a little less enjoyable than I had hoped. While a sour beer can be fun, it didn't seem to work well with this triple."
"I was quite impessed with this one, personally. It looked nice, had a pleasant smell, a nice texture and I just overall enjoied it. I saw where a few people had said that given the style, this wasn't really quite what it should have been, or what they thought it would have been, rather. I thought it was fantastic, though. Poured a bronze/orange colour with a monster white fluffy head that stayed around for a while. Nice lacing. Very spicy sweet smell with a good bit of banana. Taste was fairly congruent with smell as far as spice and banana go. Nice mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation, but not enough to ruin the mouthfeel. A nice warming sensation as it goes down, due to the 8.5%abv. Overall, an excellent example of a Belgian Tripel. I seem to think so, anyway."
"Brisk finish zesty still rough."
"A bit charmless."
"A very fine ale, highly recommended."
"Sedimented apricot appearance, glows in the light, head is huge and very soft, like pillow foam. Laces thicky, in lots of hanging strings and sheets. Tons of aroma, plenty of grape, orange, yeast notes and a light sense of blackboard slate. Impressive taste, well-bittered up front, medium carbonation, and an astringent marmalade impression. Dries well, with alcoholic heat and a strident finish and aridity that's almost like an asphalt-like bitterness. Bold stokes here, Westmalle seems safer, but this is about as close to what I expect from a Tripel as I've run across -- would be just about right when I'm in the mood."
"Very drinkable Belgian brew."
"Pours a pale burnt orange that is slightly hazed with a nice dense white head that lasts a while. The smell consists of a sweet musty horse blanket, fruit and light spicing. The taste is a lightly sweet fruit and raisins, with a musty yeast taste trailing into a light alcohol on the tail. This beer is medium bodied and drinks down fairly easy."
"Poured a cloudy golden orange, head quickly settled down to a pinky's width and stuck around for awhile. Great lacing on this, smells of sweet oranges and spice with an added taste of pepper and candy. Slight tingling on the tongue, smooth down the back. This tripel was a great find and one I'll be picking up again and again. If you like La Fin you'll love this."
"Holy smokes look at the psycho motion going on in this coarse, bubbly, dirty white head. Denser on second pour. There is lots and lots of soapy lacing. The beer itself is orangey-gold and slightly hazy. Nose is citrus, sweet and a little woody. Alcohol is there. Spice and pepper in the sweet, fruity front. Thick foaminess in the middle: sweet, buttery, fruity, caramely. The finish tastes just like snow! (plus some fruit and lots of alcohol). This is a nice, pleasant beer, if just a little plain."
"As an interesting afternote, I only drank half of this 750, and then tested a new ""champagne saver"" on the bottle to see how it stands up to time. After 2 days, I noticed a light leak (it was on its side) and I opened it and drank the rest. The head was almost gone- but surprisingly there was still a little left. The flavor had separated into a base of light syrupy sweetness and higher notes of citrus, pepper, tart, and hops. It was actually a little creamier than when first opened too. Really quite a nice surprise- I thought it would be bad. Extra points for this brew!"
"The bottle was dated best before (21 12 02) two years earlier. My first thought is...MMmm well aged. The cork was a pain but then when it did move POW, out it came. The brew was clouded but with a nice honey hue. The nose was candied with a wonderful feel in the mouth. Not overly carbonated but noticeable as a Belgium bier. The taste was exciting the balance outstanding. The hops are not hiding behind the candy and all the flavors co-exist peacefully. This is the best out of date beer Ive ever had, Gotta love those Friars."
"You can't stay in the brewing business for close to 900 years without doing *something* right. This is a nice, very drinkable tripel. Rich bronze in color with a moderately-sized, very lacy head fed by a jet-stream of carbonation. Aroma is orange citrus and spicy clove hops undergirded by bready yeast. Carbonation and a bit of citrus tang strike the tongue first, followed by a fairly sweet (almost caramel-like) maltiness. Nice spicy hop kick toward the finish, with a surprising, slightly sour, aftertaste. Fairly full-bodied in the mouth, but the carbonation and the persistant head keep it from becoming overwhelming. Very nicely done."
"Possess a nice light color and pleasant nose with a touch of alcohol. The brew was tangy yet sweet but nicely balanced between the two. As it went down, it warmed inside to a smile. The carbonation reminded me of a good quality champagne carbonation. Very pleasant."
"This nice golden triple, was a nice dark golden colour with a lovely white cap of foam on its head. Aromas were very sweet and honey-like with some candy sugar and yeast in the mix as well. The taste was very sweet, just like the aroma. I could taste light hops and malts, candy sugar, yeast, various spices, and alcohol on my palate. The mouthfeel was spritzy, highly carbonated, and full of life. The drinkability was damn good."
"Knew I was in for a treat cause the bottle was dated best before 5/03. Poured a nice hazy, golden orange color with a thin white head. Green apples, yeast, malty sweetness and alcohol dominated the nose. Very sweet, effervescent, yeasty and slightly cidery tasting, with a big, dry Granny Smith apple finish. This beer seemed highly attenuated, therefore making it a pleasure to enjoy. I'm stocking up on a few more bottles from this dating."
"Pours to a hazy, golden color with a thick white head. The aroma is spicy and medicinal, with a fresh, fruity aroma. The flavor is spicy, peppery with an herbal/medicinal taste. it has a light mouthfeel, but has an alcoholic warming to it. It finishes dry. Another good Belgian beer."
"Pours a nice slighlty hazy gold color with a thick head. The aroma is pleasant with a mixture of yeast, citrus, hops, and grass. The taste is strong on the tongue - carbonationed seemed a little high but the yeast / malt / bitter ratio was good. Crisp in the mouth, and bitterness and citrus tones lingered on the tongue for a while. The alcohol is quite evident, and when the bottle is empty you can feel it. Very enjoyable and my favorite from Affligem."
"Drinkability: A nice beer, very decent but not my favorite tripel. I only sampled 1 so maybe a few more would give me a better idea of how i feel."
"Huge rocky head with definite belgian lace and a deep gold color. Aroma is subtle and complex with a definite mineral scent and light dry malt. Flavor is nice with spiciness from the yeast alternating with a dry maltiness a bit of hops running around in there as well. Mouthfeel is just perfect for this beer as there is enough of a rough carbonic bite to keep the mouth from getting bored while there is not so much as to overpower the palate. I would try this one again because i think that there is more going on here than what one can experience from one tasting session."
"Worth $6.99  Definitely."
"Blonde gold color. Extremely large white foamy head. Aroma is fruity, yeasty and sweet. A medium bodied tripel. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are spicy. Bright yeasts with touches of candy sugar. A very drinkable beer once the head diminishes. Nicely balanced. Smooth taste. Very slight alcohol bite at 8.5%. Touches of apricots and oranges. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Drinkability  This one was OK, but it lacked the sense of balance and smoothness that Ive come to enjoy in the style."
"Aroma and taste were both extremely mild...you get the typical spiciness and hint of fruit but overall the taste was way too mild...still not bad...just average...I wont buy any more of this..."
"A very ""Belgian"" aroma -- earthy fruits (ripe yellow apples, et cetera). Sweet, fruity, and spicy -- as it should be. The esters and flavors are mopped up quickly by quite the surprisingly crisp finish."
"I almost didn't want any beer tonight, but made the commitment with this 750ml bottle. I won't be getting up early in the morning, but it would have been worth it. A very fine abbey tripel!"
"Pours a cloudy orange with nice tight carbonation. The head actually increased for the first few minutes before settling in at about a quarter inch that lasts till the end. The aroma was of fruit and malt with a lot of yeast and a presence of alcohol. Taste is good with bread and malt, but hurt by a rubbery and sour note. A good beer at a good price."
"Thick, foamy head. It grows slowly for a while after being poured and forms some interesting statue-like creations. About a quarter inch of head remains and plenty of lacing. The beer looks darks and murky... muddy. Smells of pears and spices, and is a little sweet. Tastes slightly of pears as well. Thick and creamy. Interesting spiciness that lingers. Not the best triple that I've had, but it's pretty good."
"One of my first double fermented ales. Not nearly as 'chewey' as I thought it would be. The flavor is excellent - just like the bottle says, intense, robust, nutty. A little too rich to really be called 'drinkable' but excellent nonetheless. I would buy it again."
"Pours golden amber in color with a large stream of bubbles rising from the dead center of the bottom of the glass. The brilliant white head towers out of the glass and very slowly dissipates in chunks leaving a thick rocky head and spider webs of lace across the glass. Nose is sweet and fruity with notes of banana, apricot, fig, clove, and nutmeg. Medium to full in body with a smooth velvety texture. Taste is sweet malts at first followed by notes of fruit and allspice. Some nutty yeasts are then present along with some peppery alcohol and a touch of citrus leading to a dry finish. A very nice triple."
"Drop a coaster under the glass before pouring this one. A huge white head foams up on top of a glass of nice looking beer that's yellow with just a hint of orange. Lace sticks all the way down the glass. The smell is nice and spicy with distinctive notes of yeast. The flavor starts out nice and improves as the beer warms. In addition to spicy flavors, with a nice residual sweetness that's a bit honey-like. It's very drinkable and overall a very nice beer experience."
"This beer poured a clear deep golden color with a little of tight white foam and nice lace. The smell had a fruity and malty aroma. The taste was of a fruity nature and a soft, sweet maltiness. Lively in the mouth and a feel of brut champagne in the finish. Nice balance of sweetness/bitterness on the finish also!"
"Drinkability: Very good. This was quite a tasty tripel, leaving me wanting more!"
"Worthy of a closer look for those who are Tripel enthusiasts."
"It's crisp and well-carbonated, with flavors of apple, ripe pear, strong doughy yeast, and a bit of citrus. The alcohol remains subdued, carrying the flavor nicely though the mouth and nose. It's somewhat spicy in the middle. There's just a little bitterness in the finish. Not quite as complex as some other tripels, but smooth and flavorful nonetheless. Worth a try."
"This beer poured a golden color and formed a huge bubbly white head that left circular lace. A huge amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, citrus and spices such as clove. A flavor of clove, slight bit of grain with a hint of the alcohol. The finish is light and a touch tangy no doubt reflecting the carbonation present."
"The pour somewhat hazy yellowish-orange or light amber if you like. The head is pertinent in size, frothy, the lace in delicate sheets, and both light beige in color. Nose has lots of yeast, a little malt, and some fruit tones also noticed citrus like crispness. Starts malt sweet, the top skinny, finish is intermediately acidic, somewhat sour, so-so in the hops department, a quite quaffable beer, worth a sample at any rate."
"I'm guessing here, but 3 years seems like a logical median to drink this. Fresh it is too raw and hot, and at whatever age this is (5-6 yo), it's gentrified and apathetic. While overall better in it's old age, I feel like I missed it's prime."
"Notes: Not too shabby for a triple, I have had both fresh and aged sample of this brew and have to say that it is more than a decent pick for the style and is unquestionably worth a try."
"I've had this beer before, about a year ago, but this time was a bit different. Still a big creamy head, good lace, nice aroma. This time the taste, or should I say lack of, was a bit off. I can confirm the date on the bottle was 05 of 03, but there was something missing. It wasn't the carbonation, which was very nice. The spicey nose and taste was still there, but the finish lacked a big... shall I say... finish. Everything is there, but for a Belgian, a bigger finish would have made all the difference."
"The impressively thick, persistent, porcelain white head sits atop a slightly hazy dark golden hued brew.  True Belgian lace is left.  Cidery sweetness and yeast mustiness dominate the aroma, but medicinal phenol, peppery ethyl alcohol, and a hint of heaty fusel alcohols are present as well.  Sharp, prickly carbonation hits the palate up front, then yields to honey sweetness and pleasant clovey phenol absent of the medicinal phenol present in the aroma.  Mild mustiness and a trace note of rubbery yeast autolysis prevents this tripel from reaching its intended goal in flavor.  Very well attenuated and quite dry.  Finishes with more mustiness and black licorice notes quickly fading.  Affligem Tripel, although a flavorful brew, was a bit rough around the edges, and lacked the refinement of a good tripel.  A touch disappointing, but it helped alleviate my craving for a Belgian Strong / Tripel.  It's still worth a taste, however."
"300"
"Very nice floral hop aroma, nice soft yeast aroma aswell, very smooth spicy start, slight sweet and then leading to a bitter finish, i think Affligem is a bit underated in my opinion, an excellent brew, nice soft spicy flavour aswell."
"Slight hop flower and alcohol smell to the cork.  Very carbonated on the pour (be careful).  Yeast/hop nose with a hint of sweetness.  Bright gold hazy look.  There is a ton of little bubbles in the center of the goblet.  After the pour you will wait a while for the peaks of slightly off white head to disapate (go take a bathroom break).  Taste is one of malt sweetness and slight metal/mineral tongue followed by a bitter dry (abv) grapefruit finish.  Very interesting brew.  The finish is quite overwhelming which affects drinkability."
"The spiciness of the alcohol and yeast flavors weren't as strong in this beer as some of the other strong belgians I had lately. And despite the huge amount of yeast floating in the glass (I let it sit for days before pouring and the last quarter of the bottle wouldn't fit in the glass) it had an unexpectedly sharp and clean taste with some notes of orange or lemon."
"An interesting brew. Fruity, alcoholic aroma. Champagne like effervescence and taste. Big white, foamy head with no lace on the glass. It mellowed a bit after warming bringing forth the malt, alcohol and fruit character."
