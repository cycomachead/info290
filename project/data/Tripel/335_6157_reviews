"This is surprisingly a good tripel with no aftertaste. If i did a blind taste test, i would have guessed allagash or ommegang. It is very smooth and drinkable. I was sad when the beer was gone."

"This is the perfect tripel. High gravity equates super quality.  Go find it!"

"This is a fairly good beer, perhaps a little bit too sweet for my tastes, but that sweetness is generally part of the Tripel style. This seems to me like a good beer to drink in the winter/holiday months, with it's candy-like sweetness, and high ABV. I'm glad I got a 4-pack of these and will be sure to save at least one or two for the upcoming winter."

"O- Very pleasantly surprised with this one since New Holland is usually nothing to scream about.  This has become one of my favorites of theirs, second only to Dragon's Milk."

"Now THAT's a cold beer. Ha, it has a thickness to the body that maybe is a result of its deep freeze? It loosened up quickly enough. It's got the haziness of a belgian tripel, smells a little like pineapples behind the belgian yeast, and boozy. Really nice."

"Overall: One of the better tripels I've had from an american brewery. New Holland always does a good job of executing their styles. The booze is well integrated and many traditional tones shine through."
""
""

"O - A standard text book tripel, not positive why it's 50% more expensive than other text book American made triples... but I digress."

"Picked this up in Totowa last week, having never had this before. I hadn't had a beer from New Holland in quite some time but all of the ones that I enjoyed previously were well worth the money I spent on them, and this was no exception. The balance was great, the mouthfeel addictive, and the alcohol was well-hidden. The hardest part of reviewing this was pacing myself to ensure that I had some left by the time I finished writing this!"
""
"O: This beer seems to be rather sweet for the style but hides its alcohol a rather well from the taste."
""
"Overall: A nice and citrusy tripel. I would not mind trying this one with a bit of aging. Tasty, but I have had better in the style. Certainly worth a try, but I will reach for other favorites first."
""
"Palate light to medium, watery, lively carbonation."
""
""
"O: An excellent Tripel. I wish this was in my normal distribution."
""
"0 - Really a great beer that exceeded my expectations. A fantastic triple which is closer to a belgian triple than most of the American triples. My only criticism of this beer is that it only does a decent job of hiding the high ABV. I have had beers in the 9 and 10 Percent range that have done a much better job."

"Enjoyed again with Sheeps mile cheese and cheddar, some fruit. Perfect pairing and finale of evening (after Super Moon kayak)."

"This is one of the better Trippels I've tried in recent memory and at 9ABV it can be deceiving."

"Overall: a good American tripel with a true Belgian personality excepting the higher hop load."

"t/m/o - whoa. Too much. Just too sweet. Cannot handle...sorry, not my bag. Although I never had this fresh, I can tell you that 7 yrs is too much. I can only handle small sips of this beer. I will have to try this fresh to give it a fair shake, but please don't age this for 7 yrs unless you want to play a joke on someone."

"This beer is a sugary mess! Not sure why it's classified as a Belgian trippel. Little head that dissipated quickly. The Belgian phenolic funk is subdued on the nose. Sweet... Didn't the yeast convert the sugar??? No attenuation. Will not buy again."

"O-great American take of a Belguim tripel that hides the alcohol"
""
""
"Black Tulip is very flavorful and easy to drink. A good American Tripel, brewed I am proud to say, in Michigan."
"12 ounce bottle into chalice, 2012 vintage. Pours moderately cloudy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apricot, pear, apple, peach, clove, pepper, honey, bread, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of big apricot, pear, apple, peach, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, honey, biscuit, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a nice yeast/malt sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice tripel style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Calling New Holland's Black Tulip a Tripel is approximately as deceiving as the decision to name Marc Forster's recent zombie apocalypse film, ""World War Z"". Both of them deviate so grandly from their original framework/inspiration that the name carryover seems little more than marketing savvy (""Hey, people who liked this thing! You'll like this thing too!""). I mean, Belgian Strong Pale is a good classification, why not take advantage of it?"
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all a good Belgian style beer, but not near the best Tripels I have tried."
""
"In any case, this is probably my favorite offering at New Holland now, and definitely the best American Trippel I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'd drink this again. For my personal preferences, though, I wouldn't go seeking it out. But definitely a good beer brewed the right way."

"O-a solid domestic Tripel, not at the top of the style, but a very tasty beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this one a lot. I'd call it a classic Belgian. Very refreshing and satisfying."
"O - very drinkable, nice, I would certainly have again. My comments seem critical, and maybe I was expecting this to be better, but the reviews are mixed, so maybe this is one of those that everybody has a different opinion over. I'm just doing this to try to improve my tasting abilities, esp with the belgians. I expected to like it better than MM, but I think MM will still be my standby (not saying there aren't better tripels, but easy access to Weyerbacher products here and they're always reliably excellent). But I'm very close between Black Tulip and MM and wouldn't be the least bit disappointed if I went somewhere that only had BT but not MM. Certainly worth trying and seeing who's review you agree with."
""
""
"O- Very full flavored example of the style. The Tulip Time celebration has just come and gone, and it got me wondering whether New Holland was still putting this out. Lucky me found this at the Copper Vine. I'm thinking of hitting up the New Holland tap room this week. Maybe a tap offering is in order?"

"Overall: a solid American trippel but I have had better that were easier to find and less expensive. pretty good but not worth the hefty price that seems common with big new holland beers"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, obliviously the Bros. like this one. There are certain malt profiles that have a glue taste for me. This might be one that is right on for you, try one on."
""
""
""
"O: Not bad. A bit too sweet with the alcohol showing a bit too much, but overall pretty tasty."
""
""
""
""
"O: was hesitant at first to spend $16 on a 4 pack but this beer really came through. Will definitely purchase next time I'm looking for a tripel"
""
"I really enjoyed this one, and probably will pick up some more for experimental cellar aging next time they are available to see if I can pull back that booziness and accentuate the fruitiness a bit. My palate is a bit oversensitive to alcohol hotness, however, so YMMV."
""
""
""
"I feel like this is another one of those 'try-too-hard' ales from New Holland. Not the biggest fan of their High Gravity Series, but Black Tulip is really not that far removed from your average Belgian tripel."
""
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ A moderatly tasty triple with good fruit flavors. One to try if the chance arises but not one to go out of the way."
"Pours a clear gold with a two-finger white head. No sediment in the bottle. The smell immediately reminded me of other American-made tripel. There's a sharp, strong orange spice and then a slightly stringent bitterness in the flavor. It's not subtle enough or complex enough. I'd even say it's too clean. I'd guess the temperature is a little off during fermentation. A lot of the right flavors (or something resembling them) are present, all the ingredient seem right, I'd want to look at the process to improve this beer."
"I want more, fark it, I am getting more."
""
"Good beer. I bought a single bottle. Now I might get a six pack!"
""
"Decent tripel, but too hot. Maybe needs some cellar time."
""
""
""
"Overall not something I would have again (especially at $3.50 a pop) but it was nice to try it in a 12oz version. Not a bad version of the style at all."
""
""
"Pours beautifully clear and golden colored. Aroma of pears, white grapes, slight citrus and spice, a good bit of honey. Taste is very up front with the fruit, and a nice sweetness on the way down. Lots of pears and honey, some citrus, and on the sweet side in the style. A little heavy on the style, light carbonation, but I like this. Smooth and nicely crafted by New Holland."
""
""
"Poured a cloudy golden-orange color with a fluffy, white head that holds great retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. Aromas are very pleasant with banana, Belgian Yeast, fresh flowers. Tastes are well balanced with notes of banana, Belgian yeast, spice, grass, tulips. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth, medium bodied, finishes spicy with a sharp tingle on the tongue. Alcohol is undetectable in taste, but is warming. Aftertaste is somewhat odd, yet pleasant, presumably the tulip flavor lingering. It's not off-putting, just different. Overall, I really enjoyed this unique ale. It's seems light and refreshing, yet it's bold with the high ABV. Flavors meld perfectly. I've had other beers brewed with flowers, and never really liked them much as the flower was overwhelming. This was not. Stellar treat on tap!"
"Clear golden pour, great lacing, strong scent of banana, clove, and sourdough. Taste much the same with a bit of cinammon and malt. Well balanced thick mouthfeel. Not a bad Tripel, though pales in comparison to Final Absolution, another excellent Michigan Tripel."
""

"Good example of a tripel, but at the cost I would be better off buying St. Bernardus or Chimay White."
"O I like this trippel nice body, nice flavored. Drinks a bit like a souped up hefeweizen"
""
"This was an average overall tripel experience for me. Certainly not the best of the style. The price seemed a bit high considering how many good tripels there are on the market. I'd rather have several imports over this and they would cost nearly the same."
""
"I've personally come across more enjoyable American interpretations of the style. I also think $4/12oz bottle is a little steep when I can get a real interpretation of the style from Belgium for the same price. This can be an enjoyable beer, but just don't expect something that rivals overseas. Average says it all."
"Really surprised at how good this is. Almost a cross between a hefe and a tripel. The flavor is outstanding and the price is great too for such a quality brew."
""
"The thing about this beer is that the ""overall"" scores a 5 while the components do not. It adds up to something more complete and fulfilling than its components hint.."
"Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer and I thought that it was a pretty average example of the style, there were some good aspects with this beer but when it came to the taste it started to go down hill. This beer didn't have good drinkability, the sweetness and booze made it not that smooth and the flavors just couldn't hold my attention, one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both very true to style and nicely done. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor, too sweet and a little bland, pretty rough around the edges. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have Arbor's Phat Abbot, it's cheaper and much better tasting. I was a little let down with this beer, I was expecting a nice Tripel, and that's what I got till I got to the taste, then it went down hill. I had their Beer Hive Tripel and didn't care for it, and this one seemed to follow suit but it wasn't nearly as bad as the Beer Hive. In my opinion Phat Abbot is still the best Michigan made Tripel. New Holland can make some pretty good beers, but when it comes to Tripel's they always fall short, maybe this style just isn't for you guys, better luck next time."

"O: This is really an excellent little tripel, and is one of the few American tripels I have encountered that perfectly nails the classic flavor components of the style. I would have no problem recommending this to anyone interested in Belgian ales."
""
"O: The dimensions of this beer combine to make something really special. Goes down o so smooth. I'm not sure that is closely aligns with the Tripel style, but I think New Holland has created something special with Black Tulip. I will look forward to its return."

"O: Nice balance of flavors. Floral and citrus notes are enjoyable, but overall this is not as big/full flavored as most tripels. I would have it again if on tap and was in the mood though."
"D - nice flavor, probably not one i'd go for again. I probably shouldn't have let it sit as long as I did and I would like to compare it to a fresh one."
"Overall, this is a nice rendition of a Tripel. Sweeter than I had expected and the aroma didn't transfer as much to the taste as most beers do. Pretty enjoyable."
"O - This remains one of my favorite beers. I like the Americanized take on the trippel style - definitely beats out even some of the ""true"" trippels for me. The flavor is one of the most unique I've had, combining the style with aspects of a weizen, or even hefeweizen. I'd definitely recommend picking up a bottle, but the truly lucky will find it on tap. Even better."
"From notes. Tasted on draft at The Publican. Pours clear golden with a thick white head. Nose is Belgian yeast, strong honey sweetness, and a nice floral note. Flavor is sweet with clover honey, some orange, a hint of bitterness, and very well balanced. The body is fairly full and coating with average carbonation and a long bitter honey finish."
"D-overall i was hoping for alittle more from this beer. But i was still satisfied. It had good flavor but maybe alittle off in balance. I would def. drink this one again but prob. wouldn't seek it out."
"Overall very well done and a great beer."
"O: I didn't care for this, but as I mentioned above, that could just be due to the age. I hope to retry a fresh one down the line."
"I was delightfully surprised, especially considering this was a New Holland effort ... not that they don't make fabulous beer--because they do--but because this was so much better than many of the so-called ""Belgian-style"" micros out there."
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with lots of bready yeast flavor that adds fullness to the mouthfeel. There's a prominent spice character up front with lots of pepper and coriander dominating the flavor and lingering throughout. Slight hints of esters/light fruit, especially banana, apple and pear. Slightly one dimensional with an overwhelming, abrasive spice flavor and astringent, solvent alcohol in the finish."
"D - Drinkability is good. It goes down pretty easy, and hides its ABV well. I like this beer, and I would definitely buy more."
"*from notes"
"I originally ranked at a 4/5, but had to notch it up a half point after I realized how much I had drank without realizing...Amidst the thickness, this beer is very enjoyable, and very drinkable. Thanks Dan for recommending it to me; I have nothing to challenge your tastes of a new favorite beer."
"Bomber bottle, without freshness/bottling info. Pours hazy straw in color, the off white head is long lasting and leaves nice looking fine light sheeting and stringy lacing. Spiced up nose, with some pepper, and coriander. Love the style,and this version is full of of more pepper, bubble gum and more coriander. Sweet, flowery and tasty in general. Moderate grainy hops late provide some balance. nice, approachable Tripel from New Holland."
"Golden yellow and near perfect transparency with a crisp pure white head. Smells fruity and promising. Lots of sugary smells. A taste that very closely resembles the Belgian masterpiece it is called, very fruity and sugary with a pep of spice included. Feels nice and well. Cheers!"
"Overall, nice brew, but nothing mind boggling. Would recommend drinking this one fresh versus aged."
"FernMaster tells me that Black Tulip is MUCH better on-tap than this bottle was. But I am reviewing the bottled version and the bottled version is solid in many ways with plenty of missed potential."
"D: Damn tasty. The alcohol is fairly well hidden, and the flavors come together very well, into a beer that I fear could be very dangerous."
"Pretty good sipper."
"D- Can't drink it alot, high abv makes a bomber buzz me. Would be better off as a nightcap during the summer."
"An excellent beer!"
"D: Good, but not great. I remember this being better a couple years ago when I tried it. Maybe my tastes have changed. I'd order at a bar, but not a second. I don't think I'll buy a bottle again."
"I just didnt love it, may be the style. Average beer overall. I will not purchase again."
"Through the roof drinkability, this is 9.0% ABV? Good take on the style, man I wish we got more New Holland down in Joplin, MO!"
"drinkability is really the only part that suffers here. black tulip is delicious no doubt, but it's definitely a sipping beer. i think you'd be hard pressed to have more than one or two of these, especially so if you have a bomber."
"D: Ok flavoring, goes down ok, ok representation of style. I would definitely reach for others though."
"D - Well, this isn't a bad beer, but it isn't quite what I was hoping for either. The malt is way too sweet and thick. This hurts the drinkability and also holds down the other flavors of the beer. The yeast and hops are appropriate, but the combination of cloying malt and insufficient carbonation make them seem flat and muddy. A drinkable beer, but any store that carries this almost certainly also carries another, better trippel."
"Notes: Maybe the most unique tripel that I can recall drinking, people who enjoy a nice Belgian barley, yeast and floral taste will enjoy. It is not very sweet as is the case for most tripels."
"Mouthfeel is nice with lots of bubblely carbonation. Overall a very solid beer. Glad I bought a few of em to enjoy later."
"(D)- Pretty good at first, but the sugary sweetness and funky spice overwhelms the nice fruits this beer has to offer. Decent though."
"D - The spiciness is a tad cloying in combination with the sweetness and overpowers most everything else. The more I drink it the less I want to be drinking it. A moderately good triple in the world of triples."
"ps- I HATE when they call a beer ""high gravity"" right on the bottle. It reminds me of beer ignorance."
"22oz Bottle. A cloudy dark golden color body , with a two finger lasting white head , lots of spotty lacing , highly carbonated. Aroma is of lemon zest, banana,spice and dough. Flavor is sweeter than expected ,warming, malty, slight grain taste, rock candy, peppercorns,banana,and light cloves , the high carbonation keeps the sweetness in check , faint hops in the finish , full body , smooth / lively mouthfeel . Very good and drinkable."
"I am really enjoying this, not sure if it is a tripel or more of a Belgian strong ale, but I really do not care"
"This poured a clear dark gold with some white head. It smelled like a typical trippel with dominant sour wild yeast and lemon hops, with light copper and grassy malts. It tasted like sour lemon and metallic copper hops, with surprisingly strong barley and caramel malt and bready yeast. It was moderately thick with some smooth carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this was a nicely enjoyable trippel. It smelled pretty sour, but the taste was much more malty and balanced. That, along with a great silky body and fairly well hidden alcohol, made this very easy to drink. It wasn't very complex or delicate compared to some other pale Belgians, but I really liked it, especially on a summer evening."
"Fruity aroma of pears, apple and a hint of cinnamon. Spicy quaff conters the initial sweetness, leaving the fruit for a hot finish. Actually, the spicy hotness lingers for a short bit, interfering with a clean drinking experience. Not a bad trippel, but not one that I'll be hankering to get again."
"22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter a nice hazy bubbly pale orange with a thin eggshell head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is nice amount of sweet malts and decent spice. The taste is an intriguing blend of sweet malt, rock candy and nice spice with slight sweet fruits. The beer is medium bodied with some alcohol presence, but the 9% well hidden. This is a very respectable American brewed Tripel."
"This one really surprised me. I can't believe I haven't had it before this since I've seen it so many times. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall: This is a beer I will buy again...not quite as funky as a tru Belgian, but damn tasty. Creamy and delicious...can't wait to find this again."
"It is a beautiful pour. Golden hazy with a bright white head that disappears quickly. Small amount of lacing. It smells sweet and fruity. The yeast is very present. You can taste the malt and the fruit. there is a slight spice back note but not much. It has a full mouth fell with a great finish. I hear its not going to be around any more, I could definitely drink another bottle."
"A single 12 ounce bottle picked up at Goldstein's Deli in Kingston for around $3. Poured into a tulip glass, this tripel appears a hazy bright apricot color with about a finger of light orange foam. Nose and flavor are of honey, orange, sweet and fruity, Belgian yeast notes/esters. A slightly syrupy body with ample carbonation for a tripel. Alcohol is nearly invisible making this one quite drinkable, but be careful, it'll sneak up on you without much warning."
"D - I think I would stop with one, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this is very good."
"Definite earthy smell and taste. Surprisingly heavy mouthfeel, very rich, more akin to a dubbel than a trippel at first blush. Extra-long finish, more earthiness and maybe some dark fruit. Dangerously drinkable, especially for 9%. Bartender indicated that he was near the bottom of the keg, and maybe nearing the end of its shelf life- I would love to know what it's like when freshly tapped!"
"D: very drinkable for the style as a result of the high level of carbonation."
"The beer pours the color of honey, looking rich and viscuous. Head retention is no better then fair, but there is considerable sticky lacing. On the nose, I get an aroma of more honey, but it's interlaced with some gingerale, orange and hoppy bitterness. On the palate, this beer is quite rich, sweet and complex. I get honey, butter, orange, maraschino cherry, flowers and some very noticeable hoppy bitterness. The bitterness helps to counter the sweetness in this beer very well, giving some welcome balance to this medium bodied beer. Alcohol is pretty well disguised and drinkability is pretty good (though the somewhat excessive sweetness detracts a bit from this beer's drinkability). There's also something of an odd bitterness in the finish as well and it doesn't seem to be from hops. Nevertheless, this is a solid, interesting to drink beer that I'm glad to have had an opportunity to try."
"D-Good."
"Gold colored ale with a rapidly fading head actually looks like a macro,Smell is dominated by malts.Taste is sugar cane,citrus and a hint of banana.The alcohol is well hidden in the taste and this beer goes down fairly easy.I would recommend and would purchase again!!"
"I say if your a fan of Belgian triples you'll like this one."
"Don't pass this one up."
"exceptional balance makes it very easy to drink."
"D - Delicious, subtle, strong."
"Tall, creamy, off-white head sits atop the hazy golden beer. Smells like spring flowers mixed with faint yeast. Smooth, light mouthfeel that is full enough to carry the rich flavors. Vanilla, orange peel, a bit of yeast spiciness. Something about it reminds me of Popperings Hommel beer, which is a great thing. This is one tasty beer, but watch out for the alcohol!"
"D: Very flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style. Like several of the beers I've been drinking lately, this one got a little buried in my stash and picked up a little bit of age as a result. I've had mixed results in aging Tripels, but I think the age has served this particular beer well."
"It's fun to try and get a handle on this flavor. Big and fruity and sweet without being cloying; sticky and assertive without being rude. Perhaps not the most authentically Belgian-tasting tripel, but I appreciate New Holland's take on it nonetheless."
"D- this comes off to me as an interesting take on the style. certainly one of the better tripels i have tried recently. one bottle is enough, but i think ill revisit this one again. pleasantly surprised with this one. check it out."
"D - Wow. I had no idea going in this was 9% ABV. This could spell trouble if you don't be careful. Dynamite stuff, will definitely drink again."
"Pours a clean golden color with a short-lived white head. Aroma is mostly malty and candy sugar sweet with notes of white nectarine, tangerine and hints of alcohol. Taste is mostly sweet with notes of alcohols, citrus-like fruitiness and and almost lager like. Smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry alcohol like, small fruitiness in the aftertaste. Kind of basic for triple, nice though."
"Picked up at Green's in Greenville, South Carolina, as New Holland is yet to make it down in Georgia. The color of the pour looked good with a pale golden, hazy body, but the carbonation was pathetic for the style, and formed nearly no head at all. The smell was good with a mix of light perfume and booze. The was good to start off as there was hop bitterness, yeasty earthiness, and some funk, but mid sip the honeydew melon like sweetness took over the taste. The finish was spicy-bitter-earthy, but a little too short lived. The body felt right in terms of viscosity, but the relative lack of carbonation made it feel dull and less full of zest. The brewery gave this a decent effort, but came up just a little short."
"D: On the whole, this isn't a bad beer, though it's not the best example of a trippel I've ever had. The taste wasn't as vibrant as I'd hoped for. A drinkable beer, nonetheless."
"The next milestone on our exploration of the Belgian. Begins with an attractively designed bottle directly applied to the glass. Orange-yellow, hazy syrupy product emerges into the glass with a minimal head which tends to dissipate quite rapidly - not one of those frothy affairs. This beer makes its presence felt: very distinctive aroma and flavor profile. Plenty of ester and resin on the nose with some orchard fruit. There is notable sweetness up front, almost sugary, which transitions to a distinct bitterness, ike something of a bitter root, very distinct aromatics. Good if not our favourite."
"D. Dangerously smooth. Quite good. Masks the 9% well."
"D- Definitely not the best tripel in the world, at least in my book, but would I drink it again? Yes."
"Wonderfully drinkable. I could relax and sip on a couple of these."
"as a sidenote,i really enjoy the artwork on the bottle of this beer."
"D= Though this is not exactly like too many Belgian Trippels I have had, it is more Belgian than most American interpretations. The hops are the kicker - sort of makes me think of the Chouffe ""double IPA trippel"" beer (only less hoppy). Completely worthwhile... I'll be drinking more of this one!!!"
"pours a cloudy light orange color with a nice white head, looks really beautiful in color. smell is good too, has a wonderful yeasty presence to it as well. taste is awesome, it dances on the tongue and kicks its butt with an overload of yeast, sugary malt, and a slight hoppy bitterness to it. a wonderful tasting beer."
"A unique take on the style, but falls short of being a truly great triple or funky enough to be a wild ale."
"The mouthfeel suffers from a pungent, faintly sour aftertaste that is off-putting, something that reduces the drinkability of a fairly good beer. It's almost better to characterize the mouthfeel and taste of Black Tulip as a Farmhouse instead of a Tripel. This is on the whole not bad, with some good characteristics, though not the best that New Holland brews. Still, worth trying."
"Appearance a bit lame, no head, no lacing. The beer may have been too cold. Smells of heavy vanilla and butterscotch. A nice golden color, very clean beer. Medium bodied, fairly hoppy for a tripel. Tastes of mega vanilla and toasted almonds. A bit strange twingy aftertaste. A very strong brew and the alcohol is well hidden. Very dryish finish. A nice American version of this belgian beer. I did enjoy it."
"Overall a mediocre Tripel. Just too sweet and heavy."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavors are good and beer goes down smooth, but a bomber is plenty."
"Good beer."
"This could be my go-to Belgian style tripel, a great beer from a great brewery."
"D- Gets better as the glass empties."
"Far better examples of the style out there and far better offerings from this brewery."
"This beer was a hazy, dark gold with a tight, off-white cap of fine bubbles. Good head retention with lots of spotty lacing. The aroma was full of floral and spicy hops, a little lemony too, with bready, sweet malt and mild fruitiness. The flavour was dominated by malty caramel and sugary sweetness. It had a sharp alcohol and bitter flavour that didn't work well. The notes of grainy malt and fruity esters were nice though. Medium bodied with fine carbonation and light warmth. Other than weird things going on in the flavour, this beer is pretty good."
"I think that this is a great New Holland beer and is very drinkable with plenty of taste and slightly dangerous as I could drink more and more of this!"
"Overall, not what I was expecting. Fruity and sweet, but bitter and very American. I like the take on the style."
"Pours a translucent golden color with a short-lived white head. Aroma is mostly malty and candi sugar sweet with notes of white nectarine, tangerine and hints of alcohol. Taste is mostly sweet with notes of fusel alcohols, Froot Loop-like fruitiness and and almost lagerish finish. Rather boring and one-dimensional, lacking any depth or complexity. Mouthfeel is pretty good with a decent carbonation level. Overall, it's not the worst U.S.-brewed tripel, just nothing really noteworthy. Maybe I'd try it again if I found it on-draught, otherwise, I'll pass."
"Bottle courtesy of SS: Poured a clear and bright golden color ale with a big white foamy head with good retention and good lacing as well. Aroma of light peach with some sweet malt and light spice mix in the background. Taste is also a well balance mix between some light peaches, sweet malt and light spices (maybe some pepper) and a yeasty finish. Body is about average for the style with some great carbonation. Texture is not oily nor is sweetness cloying which was well appreciated. I thought this was very well done and probably underrated IMO."
"Black tulip tripel was pretty in two snifters I poured it into: very clear, golden, lager-like coloring with a slight hint of orange / red. Creamy head looked great from the start but faded quickly, maintaining a presence just around the edges of the glass throughout consumption. Black tulip had a clean nose but with some citrus and tangerine plus flowery hop aromas. First sip: very full, sweet body with citrus and tangerine persisting and some pleasant hops to round it out at the end. These characteristics were pretty much consistent for the whole glass, though the hop presence faded a bit. My main complaint would be that it seemed to lack a bit of complexity and didnÂ’t change much as I drank. It did taste good with those buffalo steaks though."
"It poured very clear and I was really suprised by this. It had a great pale golden color and when under the nose had a great sweet charactor to it. It was very easy to drink and felt very smooth in texture. I was most suprised with the clarity of the beer as it was not cloudy in any way. Also it had a great sweet tasting head to it that added abit of flavor of it's own."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale golden color with an orange hue and a thin white head that disappears really quickly. Some lacing shown. The smell is reserved but recognizable; coriander spice, sweet malt and Belgian yeast. The body is a little heavier than I've experienced before with this style. This one is slightly under-carbonated, but the mouth feel is complemented by the complexity achieved with the coriander spice and almost syrupy sweet flavors. Instead of being dry, this one's sweetness lingers some. I like this a lot, but i can say that it's on the edge of style. Hey, drink what's right for you. Mr. Bryson, your point about style guides applies once again. I will definitely buy this again though. Enjoy."
"D: The tripel fails to settle into a groove, remaining incredibly sweet throughout. Drinkable but unspectacular."
"D: Nice example of a triple. High alcohol catches up to you, but it's hidden well by the sweet fruitiness. Overall, very fun to drink. Refreshing, but with some real character and body. Will keep this in mind as a favorite."
"Eric"
"D: Would love to have a few of these on a hot Summer day..."
"Excellent trippel with a light golden color that shimmers in the glass, and a clean white head on top. The head fell after a bit and left a spotty lace around the side. Nice nose with the light hop smell and a bit of yeast. Clean, crisp beer with a lot of peppery notes in the taste, actually stronger than the hop. Easy drinking and a very elegant, well done beer. If you're not into the pepper, I can see how some will not like it as well, but if you do it you're beer."
"Drinkability: I've got to acknowledge that something seems a bit amiss with this one. Maybe that something is me."
"Thanks Viggo!"
"Pours a hazy golden, nice thick white head, very compact, nice lacing up the glass, good retention, nice thick layer of foam. Smell is sweet, grassy, little bit sugary, quite yeast, honey sugary sweetness, bit of skunk, pretty nice smelling, citrusy in the finish. Taste is very sweet and sugary, yeasty, lemony citrus, kind of bready, corriander, bit of fruity alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth going down. A decent and drinkable tripel, a refreshing drink. Thanks Chris!"
"The body is good with a light carbonation that could be improved. A dry finish and as mention very smooth with no solvent or phenolics off setting. This making it very easy to drink. Overall I would say it is not a tripel in taste but still very surprising 9% is a little masking of its character."
"This is my first forray into the trippels since they became available here in SC. Will definitely explore this genre. A great introduction."
"On the darker side of being golden. Nice slight head on top-not the ice cream fluff like a Duvel but still admirable. Leaves some nice sticky lacing. Low aroma-sort of a yeasty and funky banana/clove thing going on. Wonderful flavor-a tad sweeter then I am used to in a trippel. Very, very malty with a thick, candi sugar flavor. Nice low level ester flavor. A bit too sweet keeps me from giving it higher marks. Nice mouthfeel but needs to dry out some more. Very, very drinkable beer overall-extremely tasty. If it lost some of the sweetness it could be top notch."
"its creamy mouthfeel hides the 9% (no heat detectable, actually), thanks to some robust sweetness. sweet and spicy, i would say (with some of the latter coming from hops), with a little to much emphasis on the sweet. hop flavors are significant, actually, with some lemon zing coming from there. they grow with time. the malt does boast a slightly caramelized character, but it's minimal"
"Overall a rock solid trippel, and my favorite offering from New Holland that I have sampled thus far."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich pale malt scent along with a fruity Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is good also. It has a rich and fruity pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with some banana esters and a residual candy sugar aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer with loads of flavor. It's not my favorite trippel, but it's got excellent character and drinkability."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, pale golden color with a white creamy-looking head. Smell is sweet with Belgian sugar but at the same time has a nice hop presence, slightly citrusy/piney. Being a tripel, I expected a bit of alcohol and this was definitely the case. The taste does do a pretty good job of covering the alcohol until the very end. It starts out much like the smell, sweet with Belgian sugar and a bit of spice, transitioning to the hop presence and finishes very dry and with a definite strong alcohol bite. After a few drinks into the beer, the alcohol presence isn't as noticeable. The mouthfeel is fairly light in body but it has a dense carbonation that makes the beer feel heavier. Drinks like a light beer with awesome taste. I have to say I am very impressed with this beer, especially after trying their Blue Goat which I thought wasn't very impressive at all."
"Really nice American take."
"Tripels are not my favorite belgian style, but among tripels this is a very good one that I have to compare face-to-face with the belgian counterparts. The price here is obviously better."
"Overall, not bad but it didn't blow me away either. It left a a lingering taste in my mouth like a cough drop would."
"There are Belgian wanna-be tripels and there are just American Tripels that donÂ’t try to copy the Belgians and just do their own things well. This is the latter. Very tasty with a melange of flavors. A little aging might mellow the hops and mild alcohol burn, but other than that a great beer."
"All in all, a nice beer... glad I had the chance to try it. From what I've had, I'd like to try some more of the stuff from New Holland. This may not be the greatest triple out there, but it is a damn fine American attempt at one."
"I don't know. It's OK, and it is drinkable. I just needed to get over the mix of flavors that, to me, are not in tune with a true Belgian triple. A nice offering from New Holland, but I'd rather a Huyghe."
"Hazy golden. Bubbly, thin off white head. Lace is quite full. Aroma is very sweet. Too sweet. Fruity as well. A little estery. I'm glad the sweetness isn't a problem on the palate. It's sweet, but not overly so. The taste is actually pretty good. Quite estery with bananas and pears the biggies. Candy like sweetness is present. Yeastiness is evident through the esters. Could use a little ""doughiness"" , but nonetheless, this is still decent. Light carbonation and lightly carbonated. Pretty clean finish. For 9.0%, the alcohol is nicely hidden. The more I drink, the more I like."
"A bit suprised by this one. Poured from a 22oz into a pint glass, was expecting it to be a bit darker, pale gold. Nice solid head leaving heavy lacing. The smell is very sweet almost honey, not so much fruity. I was not expecting such a strong hop flavor from this beer. It is not all hop by any strech of the imagination but I think they may be too strong for the style, almost grassy. Very smooth, no alcohol tinge at all. I am really enjoying this beer though. Would buy again."
"Overall, I really like funk, and this beer is the funkiest. Why it's called a Trippel, I don't understand. But, whatever the brewery calls it, I call for more of it. Thanks again to shbobdb for this terrific oddity. I WANT MORE OF THIS!"
"Drinkability/Overall: a nice, middle-of-the-road American tripel. Never oversteps its bounds, but not quite a standout on any front."
"The flavor is citrus and lemony with the black pepper and spice. It is a bit herbal and yeasty too. It is medium in body and smooth drinking for its strength. This one finishes out dry. A nice, enjoyable tripel."
"A nice intro to New Holland. I'll have another please..."
"Drinkability - doesn't have the trippel 'bigness' but is pretty tasty otherwise."
"New Holland is now distributing in Minnesota so I picked up this offering. It's a pretty good beer but nothing outstanding. It's not as hot as Golden Monkey and not as expensive as some of the better Belgians, so I could see getting this again as a change of pace."
"Pours like a big 3 brew with a yellow golden body and a thick foamy off-white head that leaves a little lace on the glass. Nose screams of soured raw wheat and mineral water. Enters the mouth with almost an oily syrup like mouth painting feel. Nice balance of hopes and raw wheat. This is a very complex brew that shines with individuality. Style even yeilds resemblance to a german style. Enjoyable and unique. Mouthfeel thickens on the buds and makes you want more. Very drinkable, but keep it colder."
"Judging from the rating averages, I didn't expect this to be a very good beer. But it is. Of course it is a typical American response to a classic Belgian style, so there is some give. But it did have a handsome straw, heavily carbonated, well-headed appearance. Fruity esters abound in the nose and flavors. Lightly peppery, spicy, and alcoholicly hot, but tempered with pilner malts, fruity sweetness, and a dull hop flavor. Mildly tart and thinning into the finish leaving a dry alcoholic vaporation on the toung. Perhaps a bit grainy and astringent in the end, but a pretty good beer throughout."
"I split the bottle with a buddy. I drank all of mine, thought by the time it got to the end it was warm and almost medicinal - that kind off children's cough syrup flavor. My friend only finished a few sips."
"Aroma - 6/12; App - 1/3; Flavor - 13/20; Mouthfeel - 3/5; Overall - 7/10 (30/50)"
"This is a great beer and I am glad to find another brewery that matches flavor and availability."
"This brew pours a semi cloudy pale orange color with a small white head that recedes quickly into sparce lacing. The aroma has some nice yeasty tones and a lot of oranges (perhaps too much orange). The taste is metallic, and the aftertaste is more so. The mouthfeel seems about right for a tripel, but nothing special. Overall, this beer was a hard one to finish, and at $6.99 a bottle I certainly will not but it again."
"""tis no Drag's Milk. Must make do."
"Drinkability: A rich and enjoyable beer, a surefire sipper. Worth a shot, I would go back to enjoy more of this."
"Underrated Belgian, fresh from my recent trip to Michigan. This 750 went down very well with its malting on a hot day, with good yeastiness and hops showing their bitterness in the finish. Subtle yeast spiciness. Mild citrus. Good medium plus mouthfeel."
"drinkability: pretty strong"
"This is one of my favorites from last fall and it has aged quite well! I could easily end up sleeping on the floor with too many of these!"
"Mouthfeel is chewier than I expected and perhaps a little overly carbonated for my liking. Fortunatley, it's not overly carbonated enough to impact drinkability. It's a good beer, and way underrated!"
"A wickedly easy to drink beer that could certainly get you in trouble with its kick. I only regret that I do not have more of this. A beer that I can recommend wholeheartedly."
"At first, this didn't blow me away - but the more I sit here and sip it, the more I appreciate its excellent subtle touches. Very good."
"D- Damn, it is about time I had an other American brewed Tripel that rivals Belgian brewed Triples. I'll have to save my other bottle and pit this one against Westmalle next time. Very enjoyable to say the least."
"Jen: I may not be wowed by this trippel, but it is what I would expect. It smells of sweet candied malts, and the flavor dictates the same. I get a nice smooth taste of sweet candy followed by bananas and a light clove/peppery mild bite. It ends with a mild citrus hop flavor with a kick of alcohol. Fairly easy to drink, and the flavors are done nicely, not too overwhelming!"
"D - In the vast array of tripels available, this one falls among the mediocre, It's drinkable as in, ""I'm not going to pour it down the drain," but it's unremarkable for the style. Good, but certainly not great."
"While easy to drink as far as mouthfeel and drinkability, was not easy for me to enjoy. With such an awesome scent, I was expecting more on the palate."
"Sweet candi flavors (similar to those produced with wyeast 1388) and a medium body and dextrinous mouthfeel make this a great sipper. A second pint was inorder but I was driving and settled for a couple of bombers of Black Tulip and Dragon's Milk along with a growler of the Poet - oatmeal stout."
"The sugary sweet doughy malt body contrasts with the sharp-edged bitterness. Bitter citrus and a slight metallic bite mingle with a back-of-the-throat astringent yeasty harshness. Gin-like flavors lasts throughout. A taste of over ripe bananas emerges as it warms. Odd brew considering the Trippel style, but interesting non-the-less."
"I'm a bit conflicted over this beer. There was nothing wrong with it, and, actually, it seems quite well made. I should like it, but I don't. It didn't fit the trippel style - too hoppy. I'm okay with hybred Belgian/American experiments, but here it just didn't meld - disjointed somehow with the Belgian yeast and candy sugar flavors battling with the hops."
"Overall Impression: A Pretty Big Beer. Alcohol is Defiantly Present. The Lingering Bitterness Almost Ruins it for me for a Belgian Triple Ale. As the Beer Warmed up the Bitterness Balanced the OverPowering Sweetness Very Well and Finished Pleasantly Dry. This beer is definitely not a session beer."
"Drinkability - this is good beer and goes down easy. High abv limits it to one 22 oz. serving per session - unless you don't have to get up early or drive; then certainly have another one or two!"
"Poured a medium gold with medium head and decent lacing. The aroma was sweet fruits, bananas, bubble gum, sweet fruits, candy sugar. Yeast was all over the place, as was alcohol. Taste was much of the same, with sweet fruits, alcohol, vanilla, malts. The carbonation was really aparent in the feel, to make this a little on the caustic side, but that was balanced decently well with the sweetness up front. Quite drinkable. Overall not a bad American attempt."
"Overall a decent triple. I would gladly drink this one again."
"Overall a complex and unique treat."
"Chalky hazed peach gold with a sticky thin lacing. Nose is grapefruit candy, lemongrass, light German hops, yeasts, and sweet fruits, pineapple? Taste is tropical, lightly tart, and very fruity. Ends bitter and lemony. Medium, nicely bitter/tart mouthfeel. Not terribly drinkable."
"The body is medium to full. Has a bit of a sting from the carbonation. Nice hop bite. Good stuff. I would drink it again if I had the chance."
"Golden color with very small foam. Dynamic nose with abundant yeast (leather, dough), malt (caramel, toffee) and hops (perfume), coming together to create hints of bubble gum, apple, peach and vanilla in the aroma. Aromatic characteristics continue upon tasting, with an added peanut butter element that goes well with the loads of fruits and bubble gum. On the finish, itÂ’s a bit astringent. A pretty classy and well brewed American Tripel that isnÂ’t quite as good as those from the homeland, but what American Tripels are?"
"Poured from a bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. The beer poured a hazy golden color with very active carbonation bubbles running up quickly from the bottom of the glass. There was a minimal white foamy head that disapated rather quickly after pouring. The aroma was a bit malty, with some good yeast notes and touch of fruit. The taste gave me more of the Belgian yeast notes and a nice and lemony taste. Despit being 9% abv, I found this beer to be very drinkable and with a medium body."
"Overall, get your hands on this one. It truly suprised me!"
"Not bad, not the best though."
"Drinkability: The beer could have used slightly more carbonation for my taste. The alcohol was pretty much covered up while the beer was on the cold side. Man does the booze open up at higher temperatures."
"D- Not what I would expect from a beer called ""Black Tulip"". It is a good triple that is hoppier than any triple I have had before. It would be nice to see a bit more depth of flavor. That hop flavor still strikes me as a bit odd and out of place with the smell and taste but it is not overpowering."
"The mouth could use a bit more carbonation, a little citric tartness might help too. Drinkable, but the sweets and abv would build up after a few."
"crisp and light mouthfeel.. just not well-rounded enough for a category that relies on olde standards to measure quality."
"Sweet, big round orange flavour. Deep herbal notes kick in (sage?) and take it to an off dry finish. Medium bodied & very gently carbonated. Interesting, but not great."
"Perhaps in time it will be outstanding."
"I know New Holland has had problems with inconsistency, so I feel pretty lucky that this one was as good as it is based on some of the other reviews that I've read."
"Poured out to a nice golden color with a nice head that stabilized about about 1/4 inch. Medium carbonation. Nice lacing around the glass indicated I was in for a treat. Aromas of fresh bread, yeast and malt were present, as was a vinegar like element. Taste was slightly one sided, but still enjoyable. Flavors of mild spices, mashed bananas, and some bitter citrus. This beer could be so much more if the flavors were upped and the carbonation was doubled. Mellow mouthfeel was slightly creamy and filling. Good drinkability. Overall, i'd have this beer again if offered. Something tells me this brew is a lot better on tap. Nonetheless, a respectible offering from New Holland. Worth a try."
"This beer poured from the bottle into a snifter a hazy dark gold color with a thin white head that receded quickly, but left a light clumpy head on the side. Relatively weak nose that didnÂ’t develop as the beer warmed. It had a mild yeasty character with just a hint of orange and a little pepper spice. The flavor was milder than I expected from the beer too. It had a decent sweetness up front with orange and spice mid drink, and \a bit of bread dough yeast just before the finish where more of the fig malt comes on. The mouth feel is rich and smooth, but the entire package just provides a medium drinakbility."
"Medium light body and little carbonation. Not the best Tripel I've had, but none-the-less an interesting brew."
"It's tough to review a beer that is so far out of style. It's tasty and clean and refreshing, but very different, as tripels go. There are much better tripels out there, but the beer itself isn't bad."
"I drank half of a twelve ounce bottle before giving up and feeding it to my sink."
"Pretty drinkable on tap, bu this particular bottle is sour."
"Caramel pie filling aromas emerge from this dim brassy liquid. The head is short, both in height and duration. A nice cocktail of bread crust bitterness and hard, caramel candy coated tropical fruit is lifted by hazelnut liqueur impressions. A little alcoholic to be drinkable."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head above the bright golden brew. Head fades slowly down to layer of bubbles, with average to good lacing. Aroma is sweetness, tinged with some apricot and light spicing. Taste is dominated by almost cloying sweetness, coupled with the same light spicing that in the nose, and also joined by light fruitiness and a gooly amount of unmasked alcohol flavor, all sort of thrown at the taste buds at once. Mouthfeel is low carbonation over the tongue, not mention leaving a slick almost oily feeling. Drinkability is in the ""why would I revisit this"" category. Move along please, nothing much to see here..."
"This is a very good American trippel. Most American versions are nowhere near the authentic Belgian varities, but this one seems to be close. That aside, it is a very decent flavored beer worth trying no matter what style it is imitating. It is just a good drink! If you see it, GET IT!"
"SlÃ inte!"
"This one pours a clear blonde color with a white head that has little retension. The aroma is of alcohol and belgian candy sugar. It almost smells like bubble gum. The taste is also of alcohol, candy sugar, esters ( apple, orange) also a little coriander. The mouthfeel is good. moderate carbonation, the alcohol lingers a bit and leaves you with that warmth on your palate. It's a pretty drinkable beer. I like it. It's not over the top good but definately an enjoyable brew by New Holland. The bottle I poured had an updated label as oppose to the one in the pic of this beer. It also says that it is 9% ABV. The posting here says it is unknown"
"Notes: Good beer. Not necessarily my favorite trippel, but it's still very drinkable."
"This beer seems to be too one dimensional. Tons of tart fruityness and precious little sweetness to balance it out. I'm a fan of the New Holland High Gravity series but Black Tulip was a huge disappointment."
"a pretty simple, straightforward beer. nothing to dislike but it's not going to be sought after. i like it, i would invest in a 4 pack after trying this single. 8.49 a 4pack is not bad, i don't think, for this brew."
"Mouthfeel is as expected, but I am overcome by an urge to swallow promptly as the spice and sour start to become too unpleasant for me to relish the mouthfeel. Damn. I am going to throw the rest of this four banger in the basement, and wait to see if a miracle transmogrifies it into something a scosh more palatable over time."
"from the bottle at cellar temp. poured a honey color with a white head.and some good lacing. aroma, floral, malts , yeast, hops, bread,some sweetness, alcohol. flavor floral , honey, malts, yeast, hops,a little citrus, with just a hint of alcohol. good beer."
"Nice, slightly cloudy golden appearance. Almost non-existent, bone white head. Candy sugar, tropical esters and mild malt on the nose. Sweet and sour palate. Sweet and sugary up front, with a sourness on the finish. Somewhat sweet throughout for a trippel. Sour, tart citrus(lemons and limes) on the finish. Flavorful, but not overpowering mouthfeel. Slightly bitter. A nice beer for the style. Lower drinkability, thanks to the bitter and sour finish. Worth a try, at least once. Thanks to Realale for this one."
"Interesting, the bottles I got had a completely different label than the one posted. Beer pours a light orange color with a very small head that leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma was spicy and fruity. The flavor was sweet and malty with some fruits and spice. It's nice, but something about this one didn't agree with my taste buds. Finish is very dry and the mouthfeel is moderate. Not highly drinkable in my opinion because of the oddness that I can't point out."
"The beer pours a yellowish orange, without much head. The nose is very sweet...spot on for the style in my opinion. The flavor is really cool. It starts out nice and sweet, goes to a slightly puckering sour on swallowing it, then mellows out on the finish to leave a nice zesty lemony aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little thin for me. Drinkability is just okay. With the tartness, the drinkability suffers. I don't think I would get this again, but its worth a try. An interesting take on the style."
"Very soft fluffy carbonation lets the richness of the malt come across. Deftly balanced, but could use a bit more acidic spine to slim it down. Quite tasty."
"Yes, I'd like another. Not today, but definately soon."
"Taste: big mouthfeel at the fore, quickly spreads all along the palate, but feels ultimately mild. Full-on fruity, with tantalizing spice, as well. Me, I'm liking it. Could be bigger, could be better, but I'm content with it. Still searching for that ""tulip-dusting"" taste in this, though."
"New Holland's Black Tulip delivers a satiating combination of semi-sweet, lightly grainy malt and a mildly tart, yeasty fruitiness. It's hazy yellow gold body displays some very fine bubbles rising steadily towards its short, creamy cap of bright white froth. The nose delivers the sweetish, honey-like malt that the flavor delivers, and it's a bit candyish as well as lightly fruity. It's delicately crisp across the palate with a fine, moderate carbonation and medium-light body. The 9% alcohol is never really apparent; and a limited bitterness balances it quite nicely in the flavor along with it's subtle tartness. It finishes dry and refreshing with some spiciness upfront and lingering notes of candy and fruit left in the back of the mouth. Quite possibly New Holland's best offering to date; this is one to try!"
"pours a slightly hazey yellow witha a average white head. sweet sugary aroma witha zesty citrusy aromas, oranges, lemons and corriander, pepper in there as well. wonderfully texture and body to this beer, slightly thick and chewy at first but the carbonation cuts through it and releases and abundance of citrus flavors and spices as well as some hops mingling with the other flavors. I find it very hard to believe this was 9%, extremely well hidden even if it's not typical for the style. one hell of damn excellent brew. very highly drinkable but looking at the other reviews leaves me wondering if they have some quality control issues."
"This beer is, by far, New Holland's worst offering. I won't recount its failings, but suffice it to say that Black Tulip Trippel Ale isn't worth your time or your money. I can't imagine that I'll drink a worse tripel anytime in the foreseeable future."
"Overall not bad, but not the best example of the style"
"Poured out a true gold color with absolutely no head and very minimal lacing (even after a vigorous pour). Pretty decent aroma with sweet malt, and grassy smells. The taste is pretty citrusy, but very flat. Traces of lemon and honey are followed by a very dry finish. To be honest, this has the makings to be a very impressive beer, but it just doesn't pull together. Pretty unbalanced, but New Holland definately has some potential with this brew in the future."
"Drinkability is quite high for this one. This is complex without being challenging, and substantial without being cumbersome. I could crack another open in a minute!"
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jul 9th, 2004: Pours a rich yellow color with a thin and dense white head that did not last long. Minimal lacing. The aroma consists of tropical fruit and yeast. Light-bodied and on the carbonated side, with a spicy character and flavors of molasses, malt and citrus. The finish is semi-sweet spices with a touch of hops. On the shallow end of the Belgian pool but a decent beer regardless."
"Hazy tan-orange. No head but some lacing. Not much of a smell at all. Taste belgian-ish, but with way too much of a crisp ""tang"" to it. The 9% ABV is warming, hidden and unnecessary. Not a very complex brew here. Kind of a waste of a great name."
"A very nice tripel from Michigan. I've definitely appreciated the other beers that I've had from New Holland, and this was a fine addition. I just hope to see the New Holland products more regularly in the Pittsburgh market."
"This is passable up front, but truly a chore by the 8th ounce. Any more than 12 may have been impossible."
"This is an easy drinking tripel for sure. very nice!"
"The Black Tulip, served from a slightly chilled 12oz bottle, pours into my glass a straw yellow color, very good clarity, and a modest amount of clingy white head. Aroma is quite intense and it takes me a bit to sort out the scents...first thing I notice is some very prevalent funk, makes me think wild yeast, very Belgian. Also loads of malt and a hint of sourness in the aroma. Taste is quite tart at first, without being bitter, then becomes a bewildering blend of spice-definitely cloves, unfermented grain/malt, and potent yeastiness. Finish brings in a little alcohol warmth to dry out the tongue a bit, but you're left with a nice fruitiness anyhow. Body is on the light side for a tripel. Definitely something different, thanks to trbeer for this one."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for the bottles."
"The beer might match up well with pad thai, as the lime flavor dominates and it has some sweet/sour flavors to pick up from the dish."
"Appearance: Semi-cloudy golden sunburst hue big bubbly whitehead forms thick leaving bands of lacing down my glass. Aroma: Herbal grassy hop blend along with a great touch of citrus fruit and honey candy sweet malts pleasant blend of cloves and spiciness. Taste: A tart forefront that rolls a little bumpy down my palate, the spices come about with some hop bitterness playing a role on the flavor with some citrus and tropical fruit notes not bad but definitely not straight Belgian trippel style. Mouthfeel: Medium body slightly syrupy nice brew, carbonation is heavy in comparison to a true tripel. Drinkability: Well, I look at this as a creative representatin of a triple so not dead on for the style but it's flavorful and complex but the tartness would nudge me away from drinking this very often."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a small bubbly white head that left trace lace as is subsided. Very little carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, malt, clove with a hint of grain. A flavor of malt, clove and banana with a touch of grain present. The finish is a touch soft and astrigent. As far as tripels, it's not bad for an American, but the Belgians shouldn't worry."
"ng"
"Quite a surprise for a Trippel: tastes different. Ample head, smells like freshly peeled or sliced sugar cane: that blend of sweetness and vegetal overtone? Not as yeasty nor as full-bodied as most Belgian or American trippels, it has a different flavor profile and progression. Starts out with that blend of crispiness and creaminess you look forward to in a trippel but shades into a smoothness piqued by an orange (?) or tangerine (?) hint. Needs a bit more carbonation. Different enough to warrant attention and satisfaction, but value-wise, there are more traditional tasting trippels in the same price range with more complexity."
"Overall, a very good beer that's a little lighter than most Trippels but is great for a warm summer evening!"
"Pours out to a solid, gold color in the glass with a minimal head and lacing. The aroma is that of fresh bread, butter and yeast. The taste reflects a light Beligian yeast profile. Not as strong taste-wise as other trippels I have tasted. However, this is a good thing as its an easy-to-drink version. There is some caramel taste present and a slight bitterness on the swallow. Reminds me of a lighter version of Unibroue's Maudite, albeit much lighter. ABV well hidden."
"A pretty good beer, I like it, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Drinkability is good. Spiciness is a little bit more subtle than I expect in a Tripple but this is a very nice beer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit low. The carbonation is sharp and is quite abrasive, not a smooth beer by any means, but it makes up for it in taste and smell. Despite the poor feel to this, I could still see having a couple of these in one sitting."
"Deep hazy ruby amber color with a small head of large bubbles that doesn't last, not much lacing, sweet candy and flower aromas. Dry fruity and nutty-vanilla flavors. Medium to full body with a full and creamy mouthfeel, finishes very dry. The alcohol is not really noticeable though I expect to be on the high side."
"This beer poured a cloudy orange color with a smaller sized creamy, white head. Smell is strong in yeast and also had a nutty and spicyness to it. The taste was really nice and complex but not overbearing by any means. Went down too easily. A honey sweetness is prevalent then a fruity flavor comes. The base seems wheaty almost bread like. Spicy herbal hops hit towards to end but are not too strong. Belgian yeast is more noticeable the further I go. Dry finish. Very good!"
"Two samples at Autumn Beer Review from the tap."
"Medium yellow, light carbonation and not much head. Simple but adequate lace. Sweet aromas, a bit of real maple sugar. A little thick to the tongue, mid range sweet in the orange juice realm. A prickly finish helps redeem it as a Trippel, reminds me most strongly of a peppery leaf lettuce. Decent beer, a little more jazzy carbonation and yeasty qualities would have filled out the bill better to me."
"Flavor: It's a little spicy with a some bite, but all in all, for a trippel, it's a bit thin. There are many far better trippels out there in my opinion."
"This brew poured a medium sized head of medium sized bubbles and a transparent light orange body. It had a strong initial IPA type bite that I did not care for. Not one of my favorite flavors. This beer was sampled at the Festival in Frankenmuth Michigan."
"I don't know what the hell dusting with tulip petals is supposed to do to a beer, but I'm going to go out on a limb and assume it isn't there to make it as flat as my 8th grade girlfriend. This one will get a second look to see if I just got a bad example."
"Comparing the new to the old label, this one tends to have a little less bite and is smoother with minimal sourness, which I miss. I haven't tasted an American brewed trippel quite like this before, and I give props to New Holland BC for being experimental. They have brewed a wonderful trippel here. For not much more $ than a 6'er of Bud, you're getting a hell of a lot more beer. I will be drinking many more of these in the future for sure. Highly impressed!"
"Bouquet of pancakes smothered in berry syrup, a spring flower arrangement and a touch of basement. Honeyed golden under a tight lacing head. A deep tart and fruity sweetness blankets the buds while spicy hops try to crawl under and snuggle up but eventually smother and die in bitter spite. Well-carbonated yet still coats the mouth. Not bad, but the aftertaste kills it halfway through."
"Gold to orange in color.  Chill haze present.  Aroma is of pineapple and orange juice.  Little evidence of maltiness or cloves in araoma.  First sip reveals sweetness with some hops bitterness.  I don't pick up much spiciness that would lend to more complexity. Tastes like drinking pineapple juice with some bitterness.  Not very high in carbonation that I believe is desirable in this style.  Candi sugar is evident.  Beer reveals a little more after allowing to warm.   Still the sweetness seems to mask any spiciness."
