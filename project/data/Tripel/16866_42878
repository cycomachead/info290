Different gravity-enhancers for starters, even if it is that darned rice adjunct, along with a neat, new to me (in beer, at least) herbal spiciness, and an elevated ABV, whose manifestation still seems duly stalled.  Maybe it's stuck in its parents' basement, trying in vain to finish off that last level, or something.","biboergosum","Jul 08, 2014"

4.32,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 3/13/2013. Pours slightly hazy bright gold color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange, peach, pear, pineapple, light apricot, black pepper, basil, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity of fruity/earthy yeast with balanced spice and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange, peach, pear, pineapple, light apricot, black pepper, basil, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange, peach, pear, pineapple, light apricot, black pepper, basil, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of fruity yeast flavors with balanced spice and pale malts; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely outstanding tripel! Fantastic fruity/spicy yeast complexity with balanced spice and pale malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 30, 2014"

Where’s the racing black pepper, the spice? From just the first sip, you can tell that’s not what they’re after; in the end, what you get is a refreshing summertime beer that just happens to share a yeast strain with a Belgian that’s historically spicy. And as far as bright and cheery beer goes, these guys nailed it.","BarryMFBurton","Mar 14, 2014"

Being 'Familie Rue' is one of my standout breweries for 2013 (along with Anchorage and Uinta), I didn't find a bottle of Trade Winds until December. Although a little late to the game with this one, I am aware that it was not particularly fresh yet I purchased it anyway...and glad I did. It reinforces my anticipation for purchasing a fresh bottle (or two, or three) when it is released again in 2014.","threeviews","Jan 13, 2014"

4.04,3.1,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"another interesting and delicious offering from the bruery. this one pours a nice light golden color, mostly clear, with a really massive white frothy head with fine retention. the nose is like fresh picked apricots. I know there are none in here, but I don't smell basil or sweet malt at all, not even Belgian yeast really, but fresh apricots, its really tempting and unexpected. the flavor is subtle, not as sweet as most tripels, and yeasty more like a saison. the peppery yeast goes well with the basil, but the basil is way in the back, hardly distinguishable if you didn't know to look for it. the rice seems to add some nice body, as this beer is pretty full for its color. very bright carbonation too. overall a really appealing beer that seems to be just right in early spring. its got the right amount of spice and herbs going on, thus maintaining its drinkability despite its higher abv. as good as expected, the bruery can do no wrong in my book.","StonedTrippin","Mar 29, 2013"

Inviting name doesn´t disappoint at beer appearance. Pours honey yellow in color. Rice provides clarity to such a chill hazy look. White, small bubbled, froth creates a close, creamy & slowly dissipated crown. Strong penetrating basil aroma gets along with sweet malts & subtle spiced touch to the nose. ABV is felt as a fragance far away from cloying sweet & spiced aromas from regular Tripel-style beers. Tastes as expected from aromas smooth but flavorful. Oily –no fat- malty texture lingers into a long subtle fruity finish. Low bitterness. Amazing medium body. Moderate but lively carbonation. Kind warming sensation. Yesterday I said : “Summer Tripel?

Definitely smells like tripel should, but just with a little twist from the fresh basil aroma. Very spicy and peppery with some citrus fruit and hops. Taste is somewhat buttery at first, which immediately changes to spicy and peppery. The basil plays its part in the spiciness. A bit of alcohol flavor, but not overwhelming. Some white grape flavor with just a bit of lemon and orange zest. Tons of Belgian yeast flavor. Slightly tart in the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a crisp, dry finish.

A nice foamy off white color, cream colored half inch of foam does not stick to the glass. Smell is off center for a triple, not your typical Belgian scent. Some spicy scent (thai basil) with big pale malt with some masked aroma hops with grassy appeal. Im not turned off by the flavor, it's just different for me, Im used to the Belgians. First off, I think the spice is a bit to pronounced, it's all I taste, that basil flavor. It sort of over takes the beer leaving no room for interpretation. Under that the light body brings forth alot of pale malt flavor. Some apple comes out in the end but the spice prevails. The body is a bit thin and watery IMO. Between light and medium, just falls short of carrying the beer further. Bright carb with bubbles, no problem there, alive like a good triple should be.

Once it did settle, I was presented with a tulip glass of clear golden yellow liquid, with a delicate white head that almost completely disappeared. (What happened?) Aroma of subdued sweet malts, spicy yeast, funk, basil. Taste...started out okay, much like any typical tripel, with notes of sweet malts, fruity esters, and spicy yeast. Mid-palate brought on a huge wave of stale funk, basil, and overripe tomatoes. A softer pear-like flavor comes in near the end to take the edge off, but I had a whole glass of this stuff to get through, and that was just one sip. Whew.

It tastes of spicy yeast, citrus fruits, sweet bready malts, light peach cobbler. The aftertaste left me thinking of peach shortbread which was quite nice. This beer takes you to different points of the spectrum. It's quite good and very enjoyable and easy to drink. After the previous beer I tried, this is a godsend.

The aroma was of belgian yeast, herbs, spices, faint basil, slight citrus, and clove character. The flavor was pretty similar to the nose which was herbs and spice for sure alongside the belgian yeast strain, very slight citrus, but it also had the clove type notes on the palate as well. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a spice, herby, sweet, and slight grainy finish.

Sure there's a slight hint of basil but it's subtle. What I think their addition to the brewing really achieves is a sort of oppulent and rich mouthfeel not unlike that flavor pop you get from a bite of good pesto.

Lacks sweetness in the nose, in fact, it smells somewhat savory. I'm not a fan of hugely sweet tripels, but this a tad too far in the other direction in the nose. Smells slightly salty and herbal, and almost like a Canadian (unsmoked) bacon. The taste is a little light and also herbal, but finishes with some decent sweetness without pushing the boundaries.

Very soft haze to the zinc orange color, more yellow than copper or red, transparent but not perfectly clear. The nose has a tight core of orange, lemon citrus all spiced up by ginger, coriander scents as well as basil, lemongrass herbs and such, the maltiness shifts around in the shadows but is there to lend smoothness to the texture, some almond sliver like nuttiness, has lift and enough ""off center"" feel to keep you intrigued. Medium-bodied plus, the carbonation soft and fluffy and spreads it all around the mouth, gently works the flavors into your mouth pores. Coriander, ginger root, tumeric and then sweet and sour blood orange, lemon citrus, has more of a grassy streak than garden herbs, albeit the basil easy to discern, Apricot, peach, pear, cantaloupe fruit accessible, ripe without being too juicy.

Tastes like a standard triple, a little bit more hoppy though. The finish is, eh....kinda ricy and not so tasty.

It tastes like herbs/basil, sweet malt, peppery spice and lemon peel. The herbal and spice flavors are stronger in the taste, compared to the aroma which I thought was fruitier. There's also a weird bitter herbal-like finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit dry and also has a lot of carbonation.

3.6,-8.2,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Blondish coloration with crisp, but not rocky head. Subsides soon. Smell is of isoamyl acetate, some alcohol, a peppery (possibly from the basil?) funk. Taste is similar with candi sugar at the end, but doesn't hold up. The mouthfeel is a little thin and as some have mentioned, the carbonation is fairly intense and takes away from the taste unless you make an effort to destroy it. If this were a more concentrated brew, it would be more pleasing to me.","bminor7","Feb 03, 2010"
3.6,-8.2,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a hazy strawberry blonde, with about a finger and a half of luxurious head that settles quickly into the ever-rising field of effervescence from the bottom. The aroma is interesting, with tones of hops, grains, pepper, and even a bit of vanilla at the beck end of the nose. The taste is not as interesting, with the pepper and vanilla completely disappearing beneath a sea of hoppy grains and faint banana tones. Unfortunately, the taste is not able to linger very long on the tongue, instead being forced therefrom by the overactive carbonation and incredibly light body (I blame the rice). All said, this guy would probably seem better if the flavor were allowed to settle longer on the tongue, but he's still not all that bad.","TMoney2591","Jan 29, 2010"

Cant taste the thai basil, but things start going down hill from here. the taste is just 'not right', shall we say, the initial is a bit too boozy, a real strong ethanol like flavour. its also just missing some of the regular sweet and tasty punch that a good trappiste tripel would have. the basil does, however, show up in the finish (an interesting touch). weird aftertaste of booze and baguette crumbs. the feel is a bit too thick, and the over all taste is not something that I would want for a long night drinking session tripel.","erz316","Nov 18, 2009"

The flavor is interesting but honestly a bit on the messy side; too much spicing and too candy-sweet in the finish. The basil seems to add a cool quality but might go a bit to far in the balance.

The rice gives it a very light texture and color for a tripel. However, you don't get that heavy fruit flavor from a traditional tripel, and I have to admit, I kind of missed it. Don't get me wrong, I found Trade Winds to be pretty tasty, especially when it starts to warm up and you get that basil in your mouth and then you start smacking your lips, trying to suck the delicious from the inside of your cheek. Then you go, ""Okay, I see what you did there."" I wasn't impressed, but it was tasty. And the rice brew with that fresh herbal nose is certainly a different side of beer.

The taste confirmed this, with the fruit flavors hitting big at first, and the spices lingering throughout and into the aftertaste. Fairly well-hidden alcohol. Very thin mouthfeel, and not as spritzy as one would come to expect from a tripel, but the cask likely had a lot to do with this.

Taking a few sips allows for a better understanding of Trade Winds. It is a sugary beer with pear and bananas being present from the citrus aspect and a small amount of hops seems to be here as well.

A little sweeter and fuller than a typical tripel, not quite as dry. But the rice and basil really impart an interesting flavor, lightening it up, slightly spicing it.

Taste has a creaminess to it, but still manages to be dry in the finish. Almost vanilla-like in the taste, with a bit of Cool-Whip, bits of grain, and a long, earthy taste. High carbonation and medium body. If not for a little bit of a metallic taste, I'd bump the taste score up another notch. Pretty good Tripel, and nice to have an American one that is nice and relatively dry.","badbeer","Dec 30, 2008"
4.15,5.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy light orange/amber, huge and fluffy white head forms, drops some chunks of lace and settles to a medium sized collar, great retention, head really sticks around. Smell is nice, sweet and sugary, some yeast, honey, alcohol, slightly metallic, spices, caramel, basil, a bit soapy, but real neat. Taste is similar, quite sweet up front, caramel and candi sugar, basil, bitter spiciness, alcohol, wheat, light funky, apricots, great stuff, basil really gives it a neat character. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, very neat character. Great tripel, think I have a bottle in the cellar. Thanks Russ!","Viggo","Dec 19, 2008"

3.95,0.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This one was quite hazy, sort of cloudy and a peach/orange colour. It had a giant, fluffy, eggshell cap that left clumpy lace on the glass. The aroma was quite spicy, floral and lemongrass, ripe fruits, white bread, just a hint of basil too. Mild bitterness with plenty of bread and ripe fruit, citrus, herbal notes with a bit of basil here as well. Medium bodied with medium high, slightly sharp carbonation. Light warmth and off-dry. Solid stuff, quite drinkable.","DrJay","Dec 10, 2008"

4.04,3.1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"drinkability is good. i think the high carbonation detracts a little, but otherwise it is well balanced and very good. i good example of the style with an exciting little complimentary twist from the rice+basil. i think this one was even better when i had it fresh from the brewery, so i don't think i'd bother aging this one and enjoy it fresh.","grub","Nov 23, 2008"
4.17,6.4,4.5,5,4,3,4,"Drinkability is pretty good - the smell is amazing, and the taste is pretty good as well, which off-set the thick mouthfeel. There is a lingering heat from my tongue to my belly which, combined with the heavy body, would have had me guess that it's a good bit stronger then 7.5%, in-spite of the alcohol taste and smell being very clean and well integrated.","ccrida","Nov 15, 2008"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Medium bodied and smooth with plenty of carbonation that works for the beer and the style. Overall, an interesting twist on the tripel. I was expecting a little more ""wow"" factor in the flavor, but other than that it was a solid drink.","orbitalr0x","Nov 14, 2008"
4.03,2.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"On tap at the brewery for the AHA rally. Golden color with a white head. Malty aroma, a little alcohol, and the Thai basil comes through a little. Malty, but not sweet, very clean. The basil makes it interesting compared to traditional Tripels. High carbonation, to style and a dry finish. A very unique twist on a classic.","Brewsmith","Nov 13, 2008"
2,-49,4.5,2,2,1.5,1.5,"Very Belgian appearance with a large head above a bright orange body. Spicing and fruit in the nose, with butter and popcorn as well. Flavor seems very incomplete and very sweet and it's just absolutely loaded with diacetyl. Has some nice elements to it, but sucks overall.","Crosling","Oct 31, 2008"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability is good. I did finish the whole bottle by myself over dinner and did not get that overly buzzed feeling. Nice beer that would be really great on a summer evening.","WeeObese","Oct 14, 2008"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"750ml bottle courtesy of Mauerhan (thanks Topher). Served in my Chimay chalice. Poured a murky orange-gold with a two-inch frothy white head that sizzled and popped as it gradually receded into a solid cap. Some wispy strands of lacing circled the perimeter of the glass. Nose yielded scents of yeast, candi sugar, spice and orange peel. Taste consistent with nose with a little booze and a buttery flavor at the finish. Mouthfeel is light with a lively effervescence consistent throughout and a mild burn and astringent quality present at the finish.","Jwale73","Oct 06, 2008"
4.21,7.4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The initial aroma turned me off a bit, but as it warmed that off-smell went away, and as I got well into my glass I really found this wearing on me. Very complex and tasty. Not as sweet as some tripels, and on the dry side, but a very fine beer. This is a definite winner, and the best of The Bruery beers I've had so far. Pick it up.","number1bum","Beers"
3.73,-4.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The first Bruery beer I've had (Black Orchard and Saison Rue) that I've thought was pretty tasty. A good solid, albeit sweet, brew that's worth trying if you see it","abfraser","0"
3.91,-0.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall this was a very nice, light triple. Not the big heavy, alcohol laden ones you see around at times, this was much more of a session worthy ale. I would have no issue with trying this one again, the price is a little biit high, only because of logistics, but if this were local I would have no issue in endulging.","mikesgroove","Oct 02, 2008"
3.83,-2.3,4.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Pours an orange gold with a big ass two finger white head that remains for quite a while. A thick layer of lacing remains on the sides of the glass with a continuous explosion of bubbles rising to the top. Smell consists of rice, corn, and basil. Some candy sugar, yeast, and clove tickle the nose. A faint peppery aroma in the backbone as well. Taste begins pretty sweet with banana, pear, and apple. Midway the bland rice flavors emerge with a sprinkle of pepper and honey. Aftertaste is pretty warm from the alcohol sting with clove and spice and slightly dry. I'm torn on the mouthfeel of this beer. It's very light and fluffy but the carbonation is a bit much and harsh at times. This is a pretty unique twist on a classic style, and if it wasn't for the aggressive carbonation this would definitely be getting a higher score.","BeerTruth","Sep 08, 2008"
4.12,5.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Interesting assemblage from The Bruery. Doing something like adding Thai Basil and rice to a classic style like this is living on the edge, and most times when I taste experimental stuff like that it's barely palatable. I think the Bruery has pulled this off though, that's craftsmanship on full display. It's not my favorite beer in the world but it is interesting and new and something that will invite repeat tastings rather than a ""Ok, been there done that, next!"" type response.","USCTrojanBrian","Sep 07, 2008"
4.38,11.7,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"It's always a pleasure for me to drink my favorite Belgian style of beer. Even better to have it uniquely flavored with Asian spices unlike other tripels. But best would be parading in the streets of Pattaya with a Thai woman in one hand and a Trade Winds Tripel in the other.","DoubleJ","Sep 06, 2008"
3.38,-13.8,4.5,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,"Bottom line: This is my first sampling from The Bruery and well, I'm not very fond of this Tripel and I'm a big fan of well made Tripels. A step in the right direction would be to cut down on the carbonation. That's the one factor in this brew that really made it tough to drink never mind enjoy.","Bitterbill","Aug 30, 2008"

4.67,19.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at The Bruery. Had a couple tasters, then a full glass. Classic cloudy golden with a big foamy head. The aroma isn't as much the standard huge Belgian earthiness you usually get, though it does have some of that. It's really more fruity, sugary, sweet. The taste is very light, with only mild earthiness but mostly light fruits such as apples, pears etc. Mouthfeel was on the lighter side, but I have no problem with that, it's an easy tripel to drink.","MiScusi","0"
