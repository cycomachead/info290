"Body is really high (impossible to feel the alcohol), I would say this beer deserves a bitter ending.. but it's ok."
"Overall a great example of a Tripel, very well done"

"Overall very smooth drinkable tripel. I wish it had more aroma. I am glad that I have a couple more of these."

"Tons of taste notes, long lingering finish, wheaty and hoppy"

"Nice clean Tripel. Easy to drink."
"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 6/20/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big lemon, orange zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Quite dry on the finish as well for the gravity. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding tripel style. All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Overall : Good beer with a taste too sharp, and missing some texture."
""
"Overall: An excellent beer. No flaws and nothing to argue about and for $9.75 for a 750ml its one of the best priced belgians you can get for the dollar. Stop hunting whales and just drink good beer."

"Overall: Very good, excellent example of the style. Would purchase again."
"Pours a clear gold with huge dense tower of foam, settles slowly to a half inch that stays, with a thick sheet of styrofoamy lace down the glass. Smell: out of the bottle it was a little windex-y but thankfully that faded before the head... slightly boozy, apple cake, apple juice, coriander, thyme-y herbal note. Less sweet than most and a bit aggressive / astringent.  Taste: unripe pear, soft apple, sugared dried apricot, and grape skin. This is nice, but then it's similarly oddly astringent, finishing with pepper and grassy notes. Medium bodied, finishes a bit slimy and sticky. Definitely different. I think I'd rate it higher if it was lower abv and not labeled 'tripel'...it's interesting."

"of all the belgian made authentic triples from the motherland there, this may be my favorite. its so decadent yet drinkable, and really bright in feel, just wonderful. blonde and hazy, radiant though and glowing brightly, huge white head rises well above the rim of my glass. the nose on this is awesome, all yeasty, warm temperature belgian esters of sweet raisin, vanilla, and dried grass, its a neat complexion over the blonde barley base. the flavor is similarly propelled by the yeast, sweet for a minute, but drying out beautifully in the finish. dynamic and layered, so creamy in feel, rich, but i keep drinking it faster than i should for a 9% abv beer, it just goes down too easy. love all the carbonation, and the way it lingers with just a hint of candy sugar in the finish. i don't get a ton of grain nuance in this one, but its simplicity lets the yeast just rock out. distinct and delicious, can't say enough about this one, a perfect classic example of the belgian tripel style."
"Very tasty, but be careful pouring it. And try and keep the yeast dregs out of your glass (blegh!)"

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Nice honey colored liquid with barely any head. Delicate lacing and deceptively sweet for something with an ABV of 9%. Not much on the nose & even less on the back end. Where do they hide the alcohol? Nicely done, but probably good for just the one."

"This is definitely one of the best Tripels I had. Although faithful to style, it has a character of its own and an elegant and complex taste. Thankfully, not a sugar bomb as other Belgian beers. Highly recommendable."
""
""
"This must have been a bad bottle; I can't imagine it was designed to taste this way. A few tastes into it, and it's surely headed for the drain. Infection? Really, really old (no bottle date)? No idea. I'll try to revisit this someday to see if this was an anomalous experience, but I can't imagine someone drinking this on purpose, especially as a Tripel."
""
""
""
"Was hoping to like this better. The tart character is overpowering, rendering the beer fairly one-note."
"Poured in to a tulip, dark yellow and gold wih a frothy white head that stuck around for the whole beer. Smell of banana bread and sweet alcohol. Very fruity on the nose like a Grand Mariner soaked fruit cake. Taste earthy and bready up front, sticks to the mouth with a light alcohol burning, moving to the sweet fruity and banana notes. Smooth, delicious. Very well done."
""
"33cl bottle into a goblet. Slightly hazy golden yellow with a three finger white foam head that slowly came down to half a finger. Lively carbonation and good lacing. Sweet smell of malts and fruits with some yeast and citrus. Crisp malty first taste with some sweetness that's followed by a dryish lemony aftertaste with some hops, pepper and apricots. Became more sweet as it warmed up. Some warmness but no apparent taste of alcohol. Medium body and a high carbonation. Very drinkable."
""
"I great enjoyed the finish- spicy and carbonated."

"This is a very spot-on tripel, and will please any fans of the style. It doesn't do anything special to set itself apart from others in the style, so how much anyone likes it will depend mostly on their particular flavor preferences. Certainly a great tripel to go-to. As traditional Belgian tripels go, this one is in the same neighborhood as Chimay and La Fin Du Monde, for my tastes, just a *touch* behind Westmalle and Karmeliet."
""
""
""
"Overall: Extremely unique, and absolutely worth the try! I generally like a little more malt in my Belgian beers, so this wouldn't become a go-to-brew for me. Still, this is excellent overall, and sure stands out from the rest!"

"Gouden Carolus Tripel is one of those beers that becomes more impressive with each successive sip. Stands among the elites in its style."
""
"O-This is a nice tripel. I like the style to be lighter in color, which this beer certainly is, and although I often go for the sweet bubblegum Belgian sugar bombs, this brew managed to please without going that route. That is not to say that it was dry or hugely hopped. Instead, it is just a nicely balanced, slightly aggressive tripel."

"O - my all time favorite Tripel. Period. I've had a lot of good ones, but nothing puts on an overall display like Het Anker's Gouden Carolus Tripel does each time I enjoy it. It's actually shocking how this brew brings excitement with every experience. It just keeps throwing unprecedented qualities at me each time. This is a Tripel I can have any time of year and know I just bought an enjoyable Belgian ale every time I buy it. This thing is brilliant and hands down one of the best in its style. Highly recommended and something ill always enjoy."
"O: Pretty good tripel. Not an amazing one, because it doesn't hit all my preferred style buttons the right way (I'm not a huge fan of the slight metallic finish, and the booze doesn't quite have that 'just concealed enough' quality of the top-flight tripels). Doubt I'd buy it again, but I'd never refuse a sample."
"A: very citrusy and spicy beer with orange and pepper dominating the flavor and aroma. A nice balance of all the flavors a tripel should have orange, pepper, honey ad alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"A classic tripel - well rounded with notes of candied orange, bubble gum, clove, white pepper, corriander, tropical fruit, tangerine. Very versatile and a compliment to all sorts of dishes - very good stuff."
""
""
"Overall: Quite the scrumptious tripel. If you are looking for something in that style wit a nice, light fruitiness and smooth finish, then I definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- it doesnt get clovey or banana y like a typical belgian the booze is noticable but well played."
""
""
""
"Also, I've had this out of a tulip and the company's chalice; I prefer the company's method of delivery"
""
""
"MF – Bright with a medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Exceptional! This is a well balanced Triple with some great sourness balanced with sweetness."
"O - A tasty tripel, and a tad lighter than I've had lately, which was nice for a change. This one was heavy on the citrus flavour profile, which I really enjoyed. I would certainly buy this one again, unfortunately, as is the case with the LCBO, these offerings don't last long."
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium-high intensity, resulting in a slightly fizzy, prickly feel at first, but quickly becoming very foamy, smooth and creamy, ultimately as soft on the palate as it is in smell and taste."
""
""
""
""
"Quite a nice tripel...thanks to my Belgian buddy B for bringing this to me."
""
"Hazy golden orange with just over a finger of white head, light lace as well here. Smell is fruity with lots of green apple and banana, yeasty with just a bit of spice to it as well, crisp malt with lots of lemony hops in there as well. Taste has spice up front followed by massive fruit largely in the way of green apple, lemony, banana and yeasty, mild lingering bitterness throughout, more fruit in the aftertaste. Medium-high prickly carbonation, medium creamy body. One of the better triplels I have had in a while, something worthy of multiple revisits."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall - I don't think this brewer makes a bad beer. This is another wonderfully balanced yet complex beer. The flavours are great and don't taste artificial and the alcohol is well hidden. A winner."
""

"Light to medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden for 9.00 % abv. Another very nice, and well made beer. Highly recommended."

"Citrus aroma. Flavor is orangy, with hints of honey. Medium bodied beer. Alcohol is present but very well balanced into flavors. Dry aftertaste. Very nice tripel !"
""
""
""
""
"poured a golden semitranslucent liquid, at least 2 fingers white head, medium retention, nice lacing, visible carbonation, nose of honey, cinnamon and colves, estery malts, palate is interesting because its not dark fruits like you would expect, this is more like honey spiced refreshing brew with malt estery character. medium body lots of carbonation, i liked it because its different and liked the honey spiced touch."
""
""
""
"O- The nice dry fruity esters combined with crisp easy drinking beer make this beer go down very fast. The citrus flavors are a nice twist on the classic tripel"
""
"Nothing wrong with it, and overall a very good tripel, though I'd probably not get it again for myself. I would recommend it though, and I'd probably buy a bottle to give as a gift or bring to an occasion."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Particles of sediment are seen suspended in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, fruits, spices, and a mild citrus-like hop aroma. Taste is much the same with a nice crisp fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has a great smell and some nice flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a nice tripel, quite light, but nicely balanced. The big yeastmonsters aren't my favorites, this is a bit more mellow and fresh, not bad at all!"
""
""
""
"O: descent beer, not wild of the peppery aspects, well balance, not very complex"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A classic tripel that stays totally true to the style, and a great one at that. I would ask no more. Very nice balance and drinkability given the 9%ABV"
""
""
""
""
"O: Good Tripel. A bit too biting for my taste. Really warm, which was nice. Looks phenomenal."
""
""
"Tumbs up"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty nice beer but the musty finish really take a lot away in my mind. For me tripels are always pretty hit and miss and this one missed a little for me. While not as bad as some other's I've had it doesn't really shine above."
""
"O: This is an excellent representation of the style that is also quite easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. The head is also very impressive and deserving of having this served in a tulip glass."
""
""
""
"Overall: It may be simply because it's the style of ale I prefer, but the Belgians are far and away the world's best brewmasters. Another choice for me to add to my regular rotation!"
""
""
""
"D - Overall this is a very nice tripel, and a great representation of what one should be. While not the most complex brew in the style, it's flavorful and very drinkable. I'd love to see how some age treats this one."

"O: It's a very yeasty beer overall, and not as dry like other triple. However it's a nice and pleasant beer to go with meal."
""
"Gouden Carolus Tripel, 22 oz bomber: Good one! Hazy golden body topped with a decent head that really lasts a long time and laces well. Not much in the aroma department, but this is made up for in flavor. Fizzy and light, this tripel has lots of apricot notes, and reminds you of good champagne. Highly recommended tripel."
""
""
"A quality tripel. Balanced with real good flavors and aromas. A bit more depth would've been nice, but this was a real good drink"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An American craft brewer would call this an Imperial Blond Ale. Taste like an import -- no mistaking that. Good beer that I would drink again. Not as heavy as a Merry Monks, but more refreshing, IMO. I think this is an ""A" beer."
"O: A well balanced and drinkable tripel. Not as yeasty as some but it is still there of course."
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a pretty decent tripel overall. I would like a bit more depth of flavor with less alcobol presence."
""
""
""
"O - A really good Tripel. The blend of sugar, fruit and peppery yeastiness blends nicely for a solid flavor. One of Brouwerij Het Anker's best."
"this has one distinct taste. gonna buy another couple of these and cellar them, see how they develop."
"Overall another solid offering from Brouwerij Het Anker."
""
"Gouden Carolus Tripel pours a super hazy tangerine. The frothy white head is absolutely massive, approaching four fingers worth of foam. Head retention couldn't possibly be any better, and the lacing left alongside the glass is plentiful. The nose leads more towards pear than anything else on the ester front, though there is a little bit of green apple as well. There are also some light black pepper and alcochol aromas present to keep things interesting. The fruitiness in the flavor leans even more towards pears, to the point where with the one sided esters and somewhat muted phenols, and a bit of alcohol, that the beer approaches what I imagine a pear cider would taste like. This isn't really a good thing, as it leaves the beer one note, and isn't necessarily what I'd look for in a tripel. The mouthfeel is fantastic though, with a nice and dried out body and an expansive, bubbly carbonation. Gouden Carolus Tripel isn't a bad beer, but it's also firmly not in my top tier of tripels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like it a lot. But not to much of it!"
""
""
""
"O) A good tripel. I'd definitely drink another one."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe another outstanding (sibling) beer is in need of review...?"
""
""
"Brouwerij Het Anker brews excellent beer. Gouden Carolus Triple is no exception. This is simply delicious stuff. It might not be the world’s best Tripel, but it’s definitely competitive. The Belgian yeast presence and the banana flavor really make it stand out. They work extremely well together. Irrespective of what you’re into, Gouden Carolus Triple is well worth your money and your attention. Find a bottle…or two."

"Overall pretty good, more like Belgian golden strong ale but tripel suits it well. Nice malt and fruity yeast balance, hint of booze, tasty and drinkable."
"Overall: My best triple yet. A must try"
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a very large head that is thick and fluffy. Very highly carbonated bottle. The scent is rich with yeast and bready hints. Hops and other earthy tones are evident as well. Taste is mild and creamy. Every ingredient mixes quite well for a bready, earthy grain taste. A really great brew from Belgium. This may have been a 9% beer but it certainly didn't taste like it. I almost want to give this a beer some 5's but idk, with all the beer out there is this is 5 worthy."
"A nice tripel."
"O: Good beer. Not perfect but I still really enjoyed it."
"I would really rate this tripel very high - maybe not the best and not in the same boat as the Westmalle, but in a class of its own. A must have."
"Overall – not a bad brew at all, although not terribly interesting. Very good tasting."
"A solid offering for the style. Nothing really stands out but nothing falls short either. Worth trying and cellaring for a while to see what develops."
"Overall-So complex in every respect. What a wonderful beer."
"Sorry not to write this down in my first review!"
"I cannot drink this beer without hearing music. It is an angelic choir, a symphony, an ode to belgian craftmanship."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a red wine glass. No dating apparent on the bottle. Pours a dull, burnt orange with a hazy clarity and a one inch dense, bright white head. Head eventually recedes into a solid 1/8th inch cap. An arc of lacing is formed on the tilt side of the glass with little droplets of foam cascading underneath the curve. Aromas of candied fruits (melon, figs, prunes) dominate the nose as well as a spicy/medicinal quality that follows close behind and a suggestion of caramel. Taste is very much in line with the nose; however, everything comes off a bit more muted. Mouthfeel is medium-light, albeit somewhat lacking in body for the style, with a crisp, almost sharp, carbonation and a semi-dry finish. This tends to be a hit or miss style for me; either I love it or I hate it. That said, this falls somewhere in the middle - pleasant and drinkable with a well-hidden abv; however, I would seek out other offerings if I was craving a tripel."
"Had a hard time finding this one,but definitly worth the effort golden straw color with a beautiful fluffy head that is slow to recede leaving nice sticky lacing. The taste is not off puttingly sweet I think it hits the mark not too floral but some nice blended fruit banana hits me most. would definitly buy this again. Probably my favorite Het Anker brew"
"Overall this isn't just a fabulous tripel. Lemon drop mild sugars and malt and candy yeast, almost like a great cocktail. Pure mastery of drink. This is MAGIC in a bottle, pure friggin magic!!!"
"O: A great Tripel and a very easy drinker."
"O - excellent stuff; a little rustic and better for it; a really good example of the style"
"O: Not a bad Tripel, but not one I could conceive ever seeking out again. Atypical scents, flavors and textures (and none of them necessarily an improvement) make this more of a curiosity than anything else."
"Overall, a good tripel. Not one of the best, but a very enjoyable beer. Would always be happy to have it again."
"Overall: I love this one from tap, from bottle it is less fresh"
"This is a classic, very refined Belgian. No other words are necessary."
"O: Great beer. Interestingly different on-tap. Very sweet-smooth. Recommended, yes, but I think I'll stick to the bottle."
" ~This is a great brew. One that I will certainly seek out again. I definitely recommend you, and every beer fan you know, sample this fine beverage."
"Cheers!"
"Good, but too floral for my tastes and the alcohol is hot and prickly. I prefer a little more sweetness in my Tripels."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw like color with a big three finger head that explodes in the glass. The head is frothy and soapy and recedes to a nice lace on the glass. The aroma is inviting big sweet notes of candy is rounded out by banana and clove aromas. A smell almost like banana runts. The taste follows the nose nicely, big sweet inviting taste. The candied notes are very present and then banana and clove and a hint of spiciness come in. There is also a champagne like after taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and moderately carbonated. Overall a very solid beer nice big smell and taste. The abv is very well hidden making this a smooth easy drink. This is a beer you could easily have a couple of."
"O- Classic triple. Try if you can"
"Interesting and different, in that the alcohol hardly presents itself (rare for a tripel) and the spiciness is more on the milder side and not quite as sharp as in many other tripels. A Big Belgian Blonde Ale, a Saison, an Imperial Golden Ale, or, okay, a Tripel, but probably just better to enjoy it for what it is than trying to pin it down to any single category (despite what the label says it is)."
"O: Agree with previous poster on these fronts: 9% abv sneaks up (wouldn't have thunk it), and may indeed be my new favorite Belgian--tripel or otherwise (title previously held by chimay blue)."
"O: This Tripel sneaks up on you. The flavors are complex, delicious, and perfectly balanced. The alcohol hit me about 3/4 of the way through the bottle. It has a perfect aroma, a great taste and mouthfeel, and is overall wonderful. May be my favorite Belgian beer."
"O: Delicious. A very good tripel -the classic Gouden Carolus is still my favorite, but this is lovely."
"An absolute pleasure to drink, this goes down very easy. I could have several, were it not for the abv and the price."
"D: It's an easy drinking beer, so generally, the tripel will always get some points, but this beer has problems. It's overly strong funk and hops ruin the balance that is so important in a tripel, and the lack of malts in the taste aren't there to mask any faults or give a unity to the beer. It's still good, but I think there are many better options in the style."
"This is a very drinkable treat with a well-hidden a.b.v. I do not drink Tripels all that often, but this is definitely one that I will look for again when I am in the mood for this style."
"from notes, 9-26-10"
"A legitimate Belgian Ale. Complex, balanced, and nuanced. A tasty treat to sip slowly."
"Pooured a columinous head on top of a orange-red body with great carbonation and lace everywhere. A great aroma that is the Belgian standard. Yeast, orange and citric hops, hints of caramel and/or a mellow sugary sweet malt base; slightly acidic and hints of pepper; something like pear or apple as well. Light-bodied, smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel makes this real easy to drink which is dangeours as the high ABV is well-hidden. Some crisp citric flavors as well as some tart apple or pear give it a little bite, but there's also an orange twang and the yeast notes balance it w/ sweetness. Light spicy pepper, some caramel or honey sweetness and a touch of woodiness all lead to a well-balanced beer that alternates between sharp and fruity and sweet and easy-going. A well-made beer that finishes dry and crisp and probably only spot ABV kicks in, this is a great sipper that gives off plenty of flavors and is a must-try."
"D: A good beer, but there are better Belgians out there. I don't particularly care for the honey-sweetness, but I can see how some people would really like it. I would say that it's definitely worth seeking out."
"jd"
"Served: January 18, 2011"
"Outstanding, but too powerful to drink much of, given its ABV and complexity"
"D- Pretty decent, not my favorite tripel by far and not my favorite Gouden Carolus offering. A good beer to experience and definitely worth drinking; however this is a last call tripel in my book."
"The feel is medium with a bit of sweetness in the finish. I really would like a lot more coming out of the yeast here, as this is seems to really be lacking in complexity when compared with better examples of the style, and certainly when compared to quite a few other Het Anker brews."
"Drinkability: This is a world class beer. Those belgians sure know what they are doing. If I could get this beer at the price I can get miller lite, I wouldn't drink anything else for three months."
"drinkability - now it all comes down to taste and there are better tripels out there"
"D: Not bad. Carolus beers are usually very intense in the way that I prefer to appreciate them with moderation"
"D: A clean, well-rounded tripel that lacks the ammunition to really stack up to its better competition. It doesn't have any glaring flaws, but it's a bit timid for normally robust style."
"D: Good.. One of the better Tripels I've had."
"Pours a very bubbly cloudy golden color with a nice frothy white head that hangs around for quite some time. Scent is a bit funky with a strong white/green grape smell. Some scents of pineapple and belgian yeast. Scent is less spicy than most tripels. Taste is where the spice comes in. Wow, this tripel sure is different. Thats what I love about tripels though... they all have distinct tastes. This one seems to have the strongest grape flavor of any tripel I've ever had. Initially I get hit with spiciness that is expected from a Belgian tripel...then I get sweet pineapple flavor followed by the lingering grape flavor. Alcohol is very well hidden throughout. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied with a somewhat crisp finish. Drinkability is very good."
"A very enjoyable, very drinkable Tripel."
"Overall an unusual take on this classic style. I'm not sure if this is normal or just an off batch but I may come back to try it again."
"This is a good blond. You don't notice that this is 9% ABV. It is semi-dry and goes down smooth. This one did foam up as soon as the bottle was opened."
"Overall impression: amazing tripel! smooth, refined and tasty. stock up if you can."
"Pours a hazed golden oranage color, highly active carbonation, fluffy white head with decent retention and lacing. Scent is mild for the style with belgian yeast, clove, touch of straw, grahmn cracker and faint lemon. Taste is more aggressive then scent dictates with the belgian yeasts, clove, hint of pepper, lemon, grahmn cracker all backed by a fres clean straw taste. Lighter side of medium bodied with slightly overdone carbonation. A good, under control tripel."
"A great Tripel. Nice golden cloudy pour, with puffy white head. Aromas of cloves, spices bananas and funk. Nice carbonation makes this a great thirst quencher and very drinkible. Flavors of bananas, spiced fruits and vanilla bubblegum. A great example of the style."
"poured from a 330ml bottle with a huge 2+ finger head that stayed around with nice sticky white lacing and a mostly clear golden yellow color..smell was fruit,clove,banana,pepper,pale mats and sugar..taste is sweet and fruity up front with clove and yeast in the middle followed by pale malts and a hop bitterness..mouthfeel is medium but it offers sweet bitter and some sour..its crisp and very palate pleasing..its highly drinkable nicely balanced with well hidden alcohol a superb tripel"
"Overall - A top notch tripel...."
"It has as sharp entry highly carbonated that fizzles across the tongue. Pleasant aftertaste. Smooth lingering taste. Golden color with light head. Would by again... paid $8 (+/1-0)"
"Three gold coins to the man who makes me some tasty beer! Something like that. (Don't worry about it.) This brew pours a clear golden straw topped by a healthy finger of fizzy white foam. The nose comprises banana, clove, pepper, a hint of bubblegum, a hint of vanilla, and some heavy yeast notes. The taste follows almost exactly, adding only a small touch of citrus hoppiness. The body is a light medium, with an active carbonation and a crisp, drying finish. Overall, a very good tripel, just not something to down on a heavy basis by any stretch."
"A good, rather well balanced tripel."
"D- Very nice triple; really a treat to have on tap."
"This is a good example of the tripel style offering most of the traditional style characteristics. The abv is well hidden and the appearance alone keeps you coming back for more."
"D: A really good tripel that I enjoyed a lot, but I think a little more time with mellow the alcohol edge some and improve this even more."
"Extraordinary Tripel!"
"Drinkability is good. Alcohol is well-concealed. Tasty."
"Very drinkable triple in this state. I'm concluding age has mellowed out some of the rougher edges leaving a more balanced, enjoyable brew."
"A decent beer, which is far from my favourite tripel, and there are considerably better offerings from this great Belgian brewer."
"Beer is pretty carbonated in the mouth. Caramelly and sweet up front, finishes cleanly with a little roast and some dryness in the back. Overall its a good Belgian trip. Not much to say."
"D: This beer is perfectly drinkable, but it will ruin your palate for all other beers. If you switch to another beer after this one, you'll constantly be picking up notes from it. I could drink this until I was comatose."
"Drinkability is off the charts to the moon good. Cant taste ANY booze at all. I recommend this beer to all lovers of all things Belgian, but especially if your a fan of tripels."
"M, D- Lovely, lush feel & drinkability. Palate-coating and full, and not overly dry. Perfect CO2. The ethanol is apparent in the olfactory, but the structure exists to balance it."
"Drinkable to a fault with a light carbonation and an unobtrusive yeast character. Will have to try in the bottle to get a better perspective, as the draft is easy yet unexciting."
"Taste is like liquid bread! Spicy, classic triple flavors with a nice saaz hop flavor. Not a ton of bitterness, but enough to clean up the finish nicely. Highly carbonated, but it seems to be ok for this beer and is helped along by a rich, marshmallow creaminess. ABV is hidden quite well. Very drinkable and enjoyable tripel. I like this much more than I thought I would, it is a nice little surprise. Right up there with the abbey tripels, IMHO."
"Poured hazy orange color with a huge frothy white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Complex spicy fruit and yeasty aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and lively carbonation. Medium to heavy fruity sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate to long duration with a small alcohol bite. This is a good sweet beer."
"I've been meaning to review this one for awhile, but am just now getting around to it. Wow, I wish I hadn't waited so long! This is a great representation of the Tripel Style: cloudy orange with a bulbous head, intricate lacing, and that complex Belgian Tripel aroma. Fresh flowers, sugar, spice, and yeast. Yum! After the first sip, while you're still enjoying the intense flavors, you'll be mellowed by the warmth of the 9% abv. Don't be put off. Continue to enjoy because this one only gets better as it goes along. At only $7.99, this will be a regular purchase from now on. Enjoy!"
"Pours a cloudy, deep yellow with a fine, modest head and lots of lacing. Pleasant nose, primarily of yeast. Pleasant taste as well; flavors of yeast and grass predominate. Alcohol barely noticeable; hard to believe that it's 9% ABV. Perhaps the best thing about this beer is the way it feels in the mouth - very creamy and effervescent. A highly enjoyable tripel that really nails the style."
"picked this up in Yokohama at a great gourmet world market. Pours a very frothy nearly white head. Used a chardonnay stemless wineglass and it gave me a couple of inches of head. It is a cloudy light brown beer, almost apple cider color. It has somewhat of a floral smell to it and does not taste too stron considering the advertised ABV. Mouthfeel is effervescent and light. Drink-ability is pretty good, would probably try again some day."
"330ml bottle at Chaucer's Pub in London, ON. Pours a glowing, cloudy, and golden orange body with a ring of fizzy white head. Smell and taste are mango, peaches, grainy pale malts, candy sugar, yeast, cookie dough, and a juicy, tart finish with a trace of sourness. Fruity esters hit the nose with each sip. Medium mouthfeel is spicy, peppery, sharp carbonation, light side of dry, some sweetness as well. Alcohol doesn't register on the palate, which makes this beer unusually drinkable for 9% ABV. It literally tastes like liquid Fuzzy Peaches. A balanced and flavourful tripel that really nails the style."
"Drinkability: this was one impressive-looking beer, but I sort of got a tiny bit let down by the rest of the experience. I think this is a pretty bland example of the style, though it's not bad. I like tripels in general, so I like this well enough, but there are plenty of other tripels I'd just rather be drinking."
"This is becoming my new favorite Belgian Brewery."
"D: A fantastic Tripel; what really makes it great is the mellowness in both the flavor and aroma."
"Bright golden color with haze, and fairly good rocky white head that recedes to a thin layer. Nose has a pleasant mix of bready aromas and tropical fruits. On the palate there's a striking resemblance to pineapple juice, with plenty of sweet/sour flavors, good carbonation, and maybe some banana as well. Just a kiss of alcohol warmth on the finish (at cellar temperature serving), but overall is fairly drinkable for the ABV."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0912-PatM"
"Overall, a total session despite being 9%."
"Once poured in my goblet ""Gouden Carolus"". Look: Bright golden color, white head of creamy foam with 2 fingers thick, very good lacing, has a sticker that say it was the best beer in the world in 2002, let see if it's true; Smell: Biscuity malts and fruit essences; Taste: Pine and spicy hops, molasses, some biscuity malts, alcohol and sugars at the finish; Mouthfeel: Dry and very bitter, bittersweet and spicy finish, the body is creamy and thick; Drinkability: The first time i try the ""tripel"" style, very spicy."
"good beer, i like the stuff the gouden carolus has."
"*= ideas from fellow taster"
"Tripels usually aren't my style, but this might make it to my top 5 tripels list."
"D: Very well balanced. Alcohol is welcomed and doesn't overwhelm gentle flavor profile."
"Light to medium mouthfeel, but too much carbonation makes it airy on the palate, which in my opinion usually takes away from some of the flavors. Drinkability is pretty good as it goes down easy enough."
"D - Very drinkable and the alcohol does not come across as 9%. Not boozy at all just spicy. Was a nice tough on Christmas Day."
"D- different than most of the belgian tripels out there i have tried so far. something to check out if you havnt already. splitting this bottle with my sister was plenty for me. hard to tell this is a 9% ABV beer."
"Taste is nice, fermented fruit (pears, raisisns), a hint of pisco or something similar - a bit musky, a hint of papaya, light alcohol again resembling pisco, light spiciness, hint of wet grass. It just barely leans to the sweet side before a dryish finish and a more clearly sweet aftertatse. Feel is lively, but slightly oily, and quite firm."
"Mouthfeel is more of a medium but still has a creaminess that makes me want more."
"D: As with most tripels, the abv sort of prohibits sessioning with this style, but it (abv) is very well hidden and can be dangerous. Overall, this is a very good tripel that I would love to try again sometime."
"I must admit I'm a little ashamed it took me so long to get to this beer, It's been on the shelf where I work for a couple months now. I feel a little foolish having such a gem so accessible and never having tried it. don't make the same mistake I did and drink this one today."
"D= Very complimentary with a good meal, or as a sipper at a warmer temp."
"Drinkability: This is a really nice Tripel and one I fully expect to have again. It is a is light, delicate and complex flavored beer that I could keep sipping indefinitely (or until the alcohol caught up with me ☺.) This is also a beer where the flavor experience depends on whether the beer is decanted without adding in the yeast or whether the yeast is added in as well. While there was not a lot of bottle yeast, some of the delicacy of the flavors is lost after swirling the bottle and adding the last bit of yeasty beer. The brewery recommends decanting only and so do I."
"D: I wouldn't buy a full box of these, but a few will do. Again a tripel that I like."
"This poured a hazy straw color with tons of white head (had to be scooped out with a spoon so I could continue pouring). It smelled like sour yeast and fresh wheat and lemon zest, with some salt and vinegar, and a bit of Belgian sugar. It tasted like waxy lemon and sour yeast, with salt and vinegar and a bit of spicy ginger and alcohol. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was not really what I enjoy in Belgian pale ales, but it was acceptable for the style. It had a clean taste and wasn't difficult to drink, and the flavor and body improved as it warmed and opened up. Perhaps age would help further improve this, since the 1.5 year old pale Van De Keizer I had was significantly better than this. This isn't a bad beer, and others might enjoy it, but I wasn't a fan."
"I liked the triple very much because of its characteristic smell and good taste exposure in the mouth."
"Overall - Excellent triple. Very complex and satisfying. The 9% alcohol will sneak up on you if you're not careful"
"D: The strength makes this a good sipping beer. A most excellent example of the style. I'm very happy I grabbed a bottle."
"D - Dangerous. In a good way. I'm guessing that no honey was used but the honey quality is pretty intense at times. I'd drink it again though."
"Hazy golden color with a thick, persistent white foamy head. Sweet, light aroma. Taste is classic Belgian Tripel; sugary sweet, malty with a little spice and peppers. Very little evidence of the alcohol, despite the 9% ABV. Extremely easy drinking, with a sugary aftertaste. Made a great nightcap for my birthday!"
"Overall this is a solid tripel but nothing is outstanding. Still, a very good choice and one that's worth a try."
"This one pours an appetizing golden yellow with a very thick, fine-bubbled, persistent head. Aroma is rather strong, fruity, yeasty and malty. Flavor is rich and mouth-filling, fruity and malty with a yeasty undertone. Texture is delightfully fizzy and tingly, smooth underneath. Worth finding."
"."
"I like this a lot. The price and the ABV might make it a once in awhile brew thoiugh."
"If you can find this beer, drink it up. It is delicious."
"Drikability is dangerous. It's 9% abv, but so smooth and well balanced that it doesn't feel like a kick in the ass. This is one awesome brew."
"Great triple from a great brewery. Very easy drinking."
"Notes: What a treat to sample this one at the Poechenellekelder."
"Verdict: If you can get by the fact that is actually looks like real urine, try it."
"D - Another fine example in the wonderful world of tripels. Though it doesn't stand out as much as Karmeliet or St. Bernardus, I certainly wouldn't pass this one up. Easy drinking (as most tripels are) and recommended for anyone who digs the style."
"An excellent sample of the style and a great offering from one of the best beer makers in the region. Highly recommended to fans of GC and/or Tripels"
"Mouthfeel is chewy, dry, with spicy dryness, after a weird sweetness of peach."
"I first had this beer at the Poechenellekelder in Brussels and scored it very highly. In the two years that have passed my understanding and appreciation for Belgian beer has only increased and so too have my thoughts on this beer. As different as they may be, all of Belgium's great tripels are just that and together, as a group, Gouden Carolus' included, comprise one of the greatest ensemble of beers known to Earth."
"This was in biegaman's cellar for a couple of years, thanks for sharing. Wow! This is one of the finest beers I've had in a good long while, really impressive. Two finger foamy white head atop a honey gold coloured brew featuring large quantities of very tiny bubbles in a Chimay glass. Well carbonated, the bubbles never quit and that regal white head took on a heavenly appearance with spotty clouds superimposed on one another. Excellent sheet lacing and retention. Vanilla wafer nose initially, ginger, spearmint, toffee. Taste was as complex as much as it was delightful with minced tart, christmas cake cherry, spice apple and cinammon with a backdrop of caramel and yeast throughout. Wonderful balance of bitter and sweet with a smooth velvety texture, perfect harmony. The alcohol is well played, this is a superb tripel."
"Pale yellow colored beer witha slowly fading head,it actually looks like a macro.Aroma is sour apple.Taste is apple with hops and malts thrown in.This is a pretty good beer with a little kick to it.I think it should be tried at least once,and as for me I will be trying it again."
"OVERALL: An enjoyable and drinkable brew, one that drinks away well despite the heavy alcohol presence. This one reminds me of the Westmale offering, though I think I enjoy the more mellow interpretations with less of an alcohol punch, such as the Chimay Triple. That said, the label says they hope the brew pleases our palates, and it certainly did mine. Well done."
" Easy to drink, refreshing, and worth the money. Very good beer."
"Notes: This is more of a subtle tripel, in my opinion. There's a nice fruit profile, and tastes quite good. But, it's not that classic marriage of fruit, spice, and alcohol that I look for. It lacks that explosive spiciness that really tickles my fancy when it comes to tripels, and is a little too malty sweet. Having said that, this is still very good beer. Just not within my personal preferences for the style. Still recommended for anyone who loves good beer."
"T: Sprinkling of carbonation up front which gives birth to a very recognizable anise that is oh so slowly carried out on a wonderfully smooth finish. The flavor just doesn't leave your palate, either. Light, but full of long-lasting flavor - a real pleasure to drink!"
"Medium body, but a little watered down. Smooth, rich, creamy and very drinkable. Overall, I really enjoyed the beer and will definitely try again if given the opportunity."
"Poured into a Gouden Carolus glass. Cloudy fainted yellow colour, an abslolutely enormous head that lasts for all its life in the glass. Fresh floral aroma, wet earth, clove, coriander and citrus.Harsh in the palate, with orange, cookies, dust, acidic finish. A very good one."
"Notes: I liked this and I did not want to review it until it warmed a bit because initially the carbonation seemed higher and some flavors seemed mute. As it warmed a lot came out and turned into a fine Tripel experience."
"Pours a very pale golden yellow color. Somewhat cloudy. Big foamy white head, big bubbles, mostly lasting. Floral sweet aroma, light. Light grapes, sugary. Some alcohol,a little hops. Soft floral taste, some rubbing alcohol. Warming up...less alcoholy, a little warming. Very light flavor."
"D. A very nice tripel here, definately in my top 5."
"D - I find one to be highly drinkable. Don't know that I would want more than one in a sitting though."
"A tripel that defines the style, very enjoyable. I can drink this beer 'till I get to heaven (in moderation, of course)."
"Light malt and soured cream flavor up front. The finish continues the sour flavor with what seems to be a very strong wheat component. This has a lower level of carbonation, which makes this a creamier tripel."
"Drinkability is absolutely fantastic, what a wonderful beer drinking experience, I will re-visit this one."
"Pours a cloudy, yellow/golden color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Very fine yeast are noticeable suspended within the brew. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malts, some fruit (banana), and spices (maybe coriander). Fits the style of a Tripel. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly chewy. There is a very high carbonation level. Bitterness levels are noticeable, but not too great. Tastes of sweet malts and strong tart malts up front and then some banana flavors come through strongly. An alcohol flavor comes through in the middle of the brew. A slight hop flavor is present in the finish along with some more of the banana. Overall, this is a great beer and definitely worth a try."
"Overall, a very tasty brew. Recommended for sure."
"D- This is one of the better Tripels that I have tried, fantastic stuff! Recommended!"
"Pours a clear, vibrant golden color with a large, dense head that had good retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Has an aroma of honey and the hops give off a floral, almost perfume like smell when combined with the alcohol that lifts off the beer surface. The taste was a bit of a surprise. It was not as sweet as what I was expecting. Somewhat dry and has a vinous quality about it. Light fruit, honey, and cloves are detected. Finishes with a dry, alcoholic taste. The body is a bit light and the carbonation keeps things lively without being harsh. I enjoyed this Tripel and would definately buy and drink this again."
"On tap at Father's Office in Culver City, CA. Another gem in that fine establishment. I was very surprised to see this not among the top 100. This seemed a little light to me for a tripel, and the smell threw me off, thinking that at best it was going to be ""good."" The tasted, however, was a light but complex wonder - very malty and sweet, but balanced perfectly with modest hops. Sweet fruits and honey, like a Greek dessert. I could sip this again and again and again. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich. Fantastic Stuff. This one should climb the charts."
"For its strength, in true to form flavour, and alcohol, this is actually fairly drinkable. It may be pretty intense at first, but it mellows out quickly when that warm fruitiness settles in. A decent example of the style."
"D - Excellent stuff. Despite the high alcohol content, I could drink several of these no problem. I will definitely be revisiting this wonderful brew."
"M + D: A shimmering carbonation is quite assertive and has some bite on the tongue which calms on the way down. A decent brew all around, and while it was perhaps not the most impressive of tripels I've come across, it's quite tasty and certainly solid. Worth checking out."
"Overall a very good beer. I tend to like their grand cru more, but this is still a very good beer to have."
"Very nice, and as mentioned, easy to drink, but I would prefer a bit more power and depth of flavor. Nonetheless, hard to imagine higher drinkability."
"an interesting tripel, although the strong banana tones seem a bit out of place. feel is also a bit thin and fizzy."
"(rated Apr 17, 2007)"
"Pours a cloudy golden color with thick, foamy white head. Nice fuity aroma of apple, pear and grape. Very pleasantly crisp with hints of lighter fruits such as apple, pear and grape with a nice alcohol balance rendering it not too sweet. I enjoyed this beer very much."
"An above-average tripel for sure, I'll be on the lookout for more."
"Brouwerij Het Anker creates masterful beers. Definitely one of my favorite Belgian brewers."
"Crisp feeling. Very easy drinking for abv. Would be good on a hot summer night."
"Drinkability: Really a fantastic beer.. A nice light and sweet tripel that you couldn't have 2 or three of if you can handle the effects of the ABV."
"Drinkability was good, although the alcohol will kind of sneak up on you. A very nice offering and one I'll be revisiting again at some point."
"Poured into my chalice, and this liquid produced a huge pale white pillow of a head. The smell of fruit and spice are the first introduction of this offering. Taste of some citrus, piney hops, spice components, and some white pepper are the most noticeable from this brew. Lots of carbonation to play on the tongue, finishes with a dry, astringent feel to the palate."
"Overall this is yet another great belgium beer. Would drink this again"
"Prost!"
"Poured into a glass and watched the dense, rocky white head fill the glass, about 2 inches thick. Appearance is a cloudy, hazy light golden color. Smells of pineapple, with light citrus aroma. Very nice aroma profile. Tastes light, but with a complex finish. In the finish I detected the hops and the complex alcohols. It has a slight dry finish, with a bit of zest. Mouthfeel is quite impressive, and I almost forgot its a 9.0% ABV beer. Drinkability is good, but its definitely not a session beer."
"The drink is plenty carbonated and zesty with a darned near quaffable medium body, and is one fine brew to relax with."
"Nose like a fruit basket with floral and alcohol notes. Palate is spritzy and fluffy with some spice and citrus. A standout tripel in my mind."
"having said all of that - it also minimizes the mouthfeel and drinkability."
"This is nothing short of a masterpiece, one of the ten best beers I've ever had and certainly my favorite Tripel, supplanting the wonderful Westmalle Tripel from atop my personal perch. Five stars."
"PROST"
"Overall, a good, balanced triple, but one that is somewhat uninspiring--there's just nothing that screams 'world-class' to me (despite the fact that this one a gold in some World Beer competition in 2002)."
"For this tasting (with many great trips) it doesn't quite get there - but this a fine beer. Traditional style, big alcohol, complex."
"drinkability - mmmm very tasty. Must try, must try on any tripel i guess."
"Drinkability: Light and complex flovors but at the same time overwhelmingly luxorious mouthfeel. Unreal; I'll take this over Duvel any day."
"Overall, a very enjoyable triple that's different than what I expect from them but I'm glad I had it. I would recommend trying this one."
"Great mouthfeel, wonderful finish. Alcohol is hidden delightfully. I remember from my bottle review that I really enjoyed this beer this first time, but why did it take so long to come around to again?! Amazing tripel."
"This is the feel-good beer of the night. Dangerously smooth. Keep 'em coming, but remember to sip and enjoy as 9% is pretty high."
"Lots of different fruits on the palate as well as spices, malts and a warming alcohol (it almost stings your taste buds)."
"D: this is a very drinkable beer, if you like Chimay white, give it a try, this is a 90 (100) compare to Chimay white, really good beer... I should try to use a sniffer glass next time."
"Overall, this is just a pretty good tripel. It's strong and flavorful, but a bit unbalanced. I might buy it again sometime... maybe."
"I tried this beer on April 25, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a solid orangy-gold colour with a very thin white head. The aroma was that of sweet malt and some yeast. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, and highly carbonated. The flavour was candied malt, some hoppy grapefruity hints, and a little more yeast. A very good beer."
"Thick and creamy with perfect carbonation. This is for sure one of the most complex yet well balanced triples around. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Never tried a beer from this brewery before, have been wanting to try the grand cru for quite some time now, simply curious to see what this one was like because I had not heard anything about it, one of my least favorite tripels ever, would not drink again, not recommended"
"Considering the abv this is wonderfully drinkable. Complex, robust in a mellow way. Refreshing. Hits the spot on a warm day, though I could easily appreciate this year-round. For wine-drinkers coming over to beer (graduating?) substitute this for pinot grigio."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Mouthfeel was zesty from carbonation and alcohol. Overall smooth and rich in aroma and flavors."
"Quite an enjoyable Triple. Easy to drink and well-balanced."
"D= Pretty strong. Although very tasty, not sure I could have more than one back to back, but I'd like to try."
"Another fine offering from this brewer. A straight up tripel with a nice balance of sweetness that is not cloying, but nicely balanced by the alcohol and spice notes. Great stuff."
"11.2 oz bottle copped singly from Gary's in Madison... I've probably never seen a more impressive appearance in a beer... the gigantic, foamy and frothy head obliterated my glass, pouring over and spilling out... a huge, enormous appearance... smell was very good... full of sweet citrus, pears, and golden honey... taste was distincly different for a tripel... sweet, candied, with a noticeably different taste from most of the same style that I've encountered... can't notice the 9% ABV behind a rich, thick, and unique conglomeration of floral, citrus-like, candied flavors... one of the best tripels I've encountered... amazing stuff with a simultaneously noticeable apple and grapefruit essence... truly different taste for the style... great thick and tasty mouthfeel with a good drinkability that only took a set-back because of the hefty ABV, otherwise, an outstanding Belgian... one of the best I've recently come across... Definintely recommended..."
"The first sip and impression is that this is ONE STRONG FLAVORED beer. I didn't think I would like this. Very Belgian malt and hops with citrus on the side. The flavors mellowed as I continued. This beer got better as I drank it. The mouthfeel and bite is good. Overall an enjoyable offering. Very true to the Belgian group."
"I was expecting maybe a little more flavor and nose, but nevertheless a 'must have again' ale if there ever was one."
"slightly hazy peachy golden colored with a big white head that holds pretty well and leaves a little lace. nose is spicy with clove and white pepper up front followed by lemon, hop, pale malt (nice and subdued, but plays a full role still), and a hint of pear. tastes like lemon clove bread almost. really wonderful and unique tripel while sticking to the criteria of a real classic at the same time. silky mouthfeel - more silky than most other tripels i've ever had - with a little bit of a dry finish. great. great with food and friends. i'm impressed with this simply complex classy classic beer."
"for me, memorable!"
"I get this brew everytime I do a Triple flight, but until now, I've never taken the time to savor it... Gouden Carolus Triple is simply fantastic.... now the question I am asking, ""Will it cellar?"""
"No vintage or best by markings on this, but it was differently labeled than all the others in the store so suspect it is a year or two old. Pours relatively transparent ( wierd) very straw yellow with orange highlights. The head was good at first but quickly became thinner than nicole richie. The nose is pretty good, floral with hops and a hint of yeast and citrus. At first taste, there is some flavor that i can ony describe as toasted hops. then the light applish fruits come out with a decent hop finish. The mouthfeel is average for a belgian tripel. Drinkability is good. Another fine het anker product, but i do have to say it is my least favorite of their brews, but they make some amazing brews! Dont get me wrong, this is good beer. get one."
"330ml bottle poured into Westmalle glass."
"Review translated from french 5-14-2008."
"D: A drinkable and tasty tripel. Haven't had this one for a while, I'm glad I revisited it, it is a quality beer."
"M/D: Crisp, good amount of carbonation, highly drinkable for 9%,"
"Gouden Carolus Triple pours a real nice burnt orange with an initial one inch head. The smell is faint to moderate, consisting of yeast and a bit of citrus. Its overall taste is sweet, mellow, and well balaced; however, it completely fails to deliver on the hops like the bottle claims. This beer has a pretty smooth feel with a lot of carbonation. One big bottle will be more than enough for me."
"750ml corked and caged bottle with no freshness date. Pours a pale copper with a 1 finger head, OK longevity and lace. Aromas of sweet caramel malt, honey, slight citrus and yeast. Tastes of wheat malt, honey, citrus, biscuity, with a decent hop flavor. Very sweet. Strong alcohol kick. High carbonation. A definate sipper. Not a bad beer but not great either. Very average."
"Pours a hazy yellow/ orange-ish color with an off white head. Aromas of corriander and Belgian yeast, with a small hint of alcohol. In the taste, corriander/ citrusy malt and a small alcohol presence. A malty mouthfeel, with a dry, spicy aftertaste. Balanced, and great for fall."
"On tap at Three Floyds Brewpub, and served in a Gouden Carolus trappist glass. This tripel poured a bright, hazy orange color with a long lasting beige head. The aroma was made up of orange, apple, candy sugar, and some mild yeast esthers. The flavor was the same, but with some excellent spice notes showing up. Also, some lightly warming alcohol made its presence known. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and champagne-like. A truly exceptional beer."
"(The price for this also makes me unsure I'd pick it up for a nights drinking.)"
"One of the better tripels so far expierenced in my drinking days. Good popping fruitiness with an exceptionally spicy and deep alcohol and yeast quality. Wonderful beer."
"Exceptional beer! Light golden color and clear at first till the yeast residue is added later. Very fine carbonation. Huge estery aromas. Good body but not heavy. Some lace. Definitely warming. Mostly sweet but a little bitterness and dryness throughout."
"A medium to full bodied beer. I wanted to drink this a lot quicker than I did because it went down so easily. You could get bent on this brew quick. Recommended."
"D- I don't know if there was something wrong with the batch or if it was meant to taste like this. It looks like a tripel and has the great mouthfeel of a tripel but the taste makes me never want to have this one again."
"Drinkability - I am amazed by the depth of presentations within a given style. I've had tripels before, and each one seems to be almost a ""style"" to it's own. The ""added value"" the each one has leaves me joyously praising brewing diversity. Yes, pass me another. However, to mis-quote St Augustine: ""Give me another Carolus, but not yet...."""
"Everything is in perfect balance for a triple. A lovely pale malt sweetness, with a bit of alcohol and hop character are all harmonious with tons of bright fruity yeast character. Yum yum yum. Poured with mild carbonation, but enough to compliment the flavor perfectly. Way too drinkable for 9%. I would love to get my hands on Het Anker's yeast strain to make some incredible home brew."
"All in all a solid Triple save for the slightly distracting finish. Id definitely go back for more."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy pale orange with a thick head that is mostly lasting and leaves great lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts, spice and yeast. The taste is also a very nicely spiced sweet malt flavor with some very subdued hops. The beer is medium bodied and very crisp with very well hidden alcohol, this is one to be careful with. Overall, this is an extremely enjoyable Tripel."
"Poured into a chalice a deep dark golden color, nice carbonation, huge two finger plus creamy head, tons of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slightly sweet, spicy, bready, and yeasty. The taste is sweet/tangy, spicy, malty, and yeasty. Medium body, a nice complex brew. Very drinkable, a very tasty tripel, highly recommended."
"I didn't realize how much I love Brouwerij Het Anker beer until I glanced at the reviews of the two others that I've had. Classic is an exceptional BSDA and Noel (also a BSDA) is one of the best Christmas beers in the world as far as I'm concerned. Triple is right up there as well. Is there no end to the number of fantastic tripels that one tiny country can produce? This is one for the ages."
"The color of the beer is a hazy orange with a decent head to it. Smell is very complex and sweet. Candy like sweetness with a blend of butterscotch, and yeast. Sweetness in the flavor is tart, peppery, a bit tropical (like pinneapple), and delicate. Alcohol is placed nicely, and remains hidden for the most part. <BURP!> Yum, tropical fruit punch in my burp. Can I have another?"
"This is the first tripel I've had in quite some time, and I enjoyed it. I think it could take me a while to be able to pick out some of the subtleties of this style. Still, I can tell you that this is a good beer, and I certainly recommend it."
"D-possibily too astringent"
"A very drinkable beer, would like to see it on tap on day."
"Drinkability: Goes down quite smooth for a tripel...watch out!"
"This is a remarkable beer - complex, unusual, and wonderful."
"Highly recommended. One of the better tripels out there!"
"The beer poured a deep golden color with a very active body of carbonation and a thick foamy head. The nose was malty and citrus. The taste and nose had some banana notes and the body was full due to the good carbonation still running through. There was also so chocolately notes running through."
"Drinkability: More on the full and rich side than I think I prefer in the style, limiting sessionability."
"All in all, this is a great beer but with the 9% abv it is a little too much for a session."
"By far, the best Tripel I have ever tried. The color was great, the nose was very fruity and extremely pleasant . I poured a little too much head in my glass and my first taste was just the foam but holy cow! The foam was great. Once I got to the beer, I was flattened. It was wonderful! Now I just need to find more of this stuff. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: this is a good beer but it was a touch unbalanced as the sweetness seemed to grow as the glass emptied. Alcohol keeps this down a notch too."
"This is quickly becomming one of my favorite breweries. This Tripel is part of the reason why. Though it is probably my least favorite of the Carolus brews that I've had, it is still very solid. Proof of this begins with a pour that immediately releases bold aromas of fresh, tropical fruit, spicy / tart yeast, earthy hops, and alcoholic strength. The beer has a studry golden, copper color with suspended yeast and an unwaivering head retention. The beer promises bold flavors and a firm texture. The fruit flavors dominate with peaches, pears, apples, pineapples, mangos... All followed by a classic Belgian tartness and a powdery sweet taste (sweetheart candies). Lighty pepery and spicy flavors add to the complexity. The beer feels full, round, and rich from the malts and added sugars; but also thinned by the tartness and rising alcohols. Sweet and spicy right up to the end, where the alcohol and tart dryness kicks in providing a fairly clean, crisp finish. Though the beer is good, I do prefer the Kaiser and Classic over this one."
"The beer poured a giant head with a careful pour it just won't go away. Really thick head with a great lacing. The color is light golden brown with a little haziness. The smell is light and very aromatic, I love it. There are smells of citrus with a small sweetness. The taste is very good and has great light flavors found in the smell. The mouthfeel is good as well, not a single problem. Overall if I could get this I would drink it this fresh all of the time."
"The color was a hazy peach with a one inch head, and a dense creamy tan appearance. The nose had aromas of juniper, fresh flowers and juicy dates. The taste was buttery and yeasty with some nice fruity apricots,fig and a splash of honey. Very good acidity and carbonation made this brew lively. After the alcohol disapates of your tongue a spicy clove flavor and a hint of sweet grass finishes this tasty triple."
"Overall, a treat from my cellar I wish I had kept a bit longer, but this was still a very smooth brew, great way to cap off an evening with friends and fellow BA's. No hint of the alcohol, very good recipe here. I will have to buy another to cellar for a longer period of time."
"."
"Taste was very average for the style. Not bad, just ""par for the course"" concerning the style here. A bit bitter, a bit of a metallic taste, lots of stewed fruit, and a big, alcohol finish. Mouthfeel was slick and smooth, but nothing that really grabbed my attention. Certainly not a bad beer, just a very average Belgian Tripel."
"The taste started with a strong yeasty flavour before turning sugary sweet. It wasn't until the very end that a sharp, drying alcoholic sensation kicked in. The mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy and smooth and overall this beer hides its high alcohol content well. Not a session beer by any means, but a pleasant easy-drinker considering the hefty ABV."
"Oh, did I mention pepper?"
"Served this baby on Turkey Day. Overall thoughts are that it was tasty, but not terribly complex. Taste was fairly sweet up front, belgian candi style sweetness, and finished with a bit of grassy bitterness. It was pleasant, but there are better tripels available. Still not a bad beer for Thanksgiving."
"Drinkability - this is a great ale, but high abv limits sessionability. Enjoy with food."
"936"
"I'll have to re-review it in the bottle or when I have some detailed notes on it. Probably killed my taste buds with the breadsticks I had right before this one."
"An excellent beer overall and style wise which I consider a must try."
"D- It was nice to try, but I won't be getting it again. Maybe some other beers from Het Anker will tickle my fancy (whatever that means)"
"D - I got another right away. It went well with my pizza (arugula, tomato, olives and red onion) This was quite the enjoyable brew. I wouldn't mind having this again. Certainly worth seeking out."
"Poured a dark gold/light amber color with a massive head that stuck around. This beer is quite dark for a Tripel. This was a very lively beer with lots of bubbles. I had to be careful it didn't overflow all over the coffee table. Aroma was full of floral spicy hops along with notes of vanilla, citrus and banana. Taste was quite spicy but also balanced with sweet malts and a little bit of tartness in the finish. Mouthfeel was full bodied with a thick, syrupy feeling in the back of the mouth. Drinkability is good, but sip this one slowly due to the fairly high alcohol content. This is nice Tripel and one that I will drink again."
"Definatly recommend."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is a massive three fingers in height. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is of yeast, lemon, oranges, with some earthy tones as well. The taste is like the aroma, but with a slight alcohol tweak in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium light bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I would certainly buy this beer again, and am looking forward to trying Hey Anker's other beers."
"Notes: To me the earthiness in the wood towards the finish along with some spices really is the nuts and bolts of this offering. The sweet apples up front just melt and lie down in the face of the finishing agents. A winner."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"The flavor was of a very sour nature. It seems that maybe this Triple's was way past it fresh date. The sour taste of hops was all I could muster up as far as flavor. Not a good triple. In fact, of all the triple's I've ever tasted, this has rank as one of the worst. My score of 2.5 was very conservative."
"Poured from the bottle to a cloudy, dark orange color with thick, highly carbonated, off-white head and good lacing. Initial aroma was slightly sour fruit. As beer warmed, the scent of the 9% alcohol became more noticeable, but at no time overpowering. Likewise, the alcohol crept in nicely in the taste to help accent the fruit and hint of spices. Finish was smooth and long. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Very drinkable for the alcohol, but lacks some interest for repeated visits."
"Ive been sitting on this brew for a little while, and finally arrived at the perfect time to enjoy it. From a 12 ounce bottle, this brew pours a hazy golden color thats tinged with a slight peach hue. Quite effervescent, the beer has a consistent and never-ending stream of bubbles rising into the white head. Not a bad looking brew, to be sure. The aroma is muted, with a little fruit and spice. I expected that the smell would jump out of the glass, but you need to go searching for the characteristics. Once you inhale deeply, however, theres some clove, apple, yeast, orange, raisins, and a lot of malt. The taste is nicepeppery and phenolic, with a wonderful sweetness. Theres an almost immediate warming as well. Fairly full bodied, which is offset by the fizzy effervescence. Finish has a spicy alcoholic quality. Solidly good."
"D - It may fatigue the palette after two or three but definitely a drinkable beer. After your first two have an intermezzo and tag on two more and youll be in good shape. A great beer."
"Taste; as with the aroma, the yeasts are right up front in the flavor of this one. The fruits are present with bananas and some citrus, with a little bit of peaches thrown in. Even with those fruits, they don't become overwhelming, which I sometimes have a prolem with. Some candied sugar and bread dough malts come out in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and seems to fit this beer very well, with a very nice drinkability."
"Good...no, VERY good triple."
"Overall, I opened this bottle expecting an average tripel flavor, basically like the rest...spicy, dark fruits, medium alcohol and slightly medium-bodied. Now that I've had it, I must say this is probably one of my very favorite tripels (if not very favorite). The honey/caramel flavor is just fantastically executed and ties the brew together wonderfully. One of the best brews I've had, period. A MUST have!"
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Huge Mountainous head that retained itself forever. It didn't lace so much as leace a frothy cap smack in the middle of the surface. Color was a hazy honey golden yellow. A beauty to look at.. Smell was a mild hop, with some sweet spices, coriander I think. Taste was a very mild and smooth hop base with more herbal spices. More coriander, and a little bit of pepper. Nothing overwhelming, just very colorful. Mouthfeel was full with a pleasant alcohol warmth. For being a bigger beer, this went down very smoothly. Restraint keeps me from drinking more than one in a sitting. A lot of restraint."
"D - It is very drinkable. At 9% ABV you can't have too many, though."
"D - A really good tripel. Alcohol is noticeable although you wouldn't expect it to be as strong as it is. Definitely worth a try."
"Side note: Served at 50 degrees F. and only got better as it warmed, around 56 - 58. Perfect."
"Pours an exceedingly bright, golden amber, with a tenacious head that leaves sticking lacing on the sides of my glass. Brilliant nose, redolent of those chocolate oranges people give away during Christmas time, plus candi sugar. Very zesty. Quite sweet on the palate, but in a light way -- it's nectary as opposed to molasses-y, with peppy carbonation that helps in that regard. Some orange notes come out in the palate, but there's also a very forward burnt sugar flavor, kind of like creme brulee. Quite a good tripel -- it manages that tripel balancing act, being rich, light, fruity and sweet at the same time. Bravo."
"¡Salud!"
"honey hopped greatness. poured a murky brown copper color; creamy, but quick to settle head; solid carbonation; crisp hoppiness traced with syrupy honeyed stuff. it's a nice belgian trip. the alcohol only makes its presence known on the exhaling finish, which is always fun. kinda malty aftertaste. not the best out of belgium, but not too damn bad either. i do recommend this beer and allow yourself the chance to see for yourself."
"Very refreshing and tasty... what more could you ask for?... perhaps a bit less perfume in the taste... but oh well... a fantastic beer nonetheless."
"This was a great and smooth tripel."
"Drank this a bit cold (45 deg) so the aroma was fairly subdued. Faint esters, some citrus. The appearance is a bit mucky, not what I would expect from a tripel. The flavor has a tang, with some alcohol and spice. Balance is toward malt, but hops add a pleasant counterpoint. Mouthfeel is smooth with a bit too much of an alchol bite for my taste at this ABV. Excellent, smooth drinkability. This would rate higher for me if the flavor had more depth."
"Drinkability: Good. Wish it didn't dry out in the finish, but I enjoyed the unusual take on the typical tripel flavor. Worth a try, for sure."
"Taste was hoppy and citric, with a sharp bitterness. Also some herbal notes. Mouthfeel is dry which make me suspect a lot of sugar has been used brewing this. The mouthfeel combined with the bitterness is a good combination and the choice of hops is well choosen. The flavors added by the yeast remind me of Westmalle, although not the same, both have the solvent and herbal notes. So, a pretty good Belgian triple."
"Smooth and creamy, a wee bit bubbly with a medium body, feels good in the mouth and goes down warm to the tummy. Easy to drink, yet fairly strong...another Belgian most worthy of recommendation, try it !"
"A good tripel ( never met one I didn't like )....not outstanding, but will try a bottle if I see one."
"There is a little cardboard here."
"Overall - A top notch tripel.... one of the best. Highly recommended..."
"750 ML Bottle. Pours a hazzy blonde with a frothy head that slowly dissipated as the beer warmed. The flavor is of citrus fruits, pear, apple, grapes. The aroma is full of sweet fruits, very tangy. A very refined Triple, smoother than most Triples I have drank."
"on draft, I found this beer a little better, than in the bottle. pours with a nice thick head that fades rather quickly. clear yellow color. turns out to be slightly richer on draft. flavors remain the same; a little austere and plain, but good with food, especially food prepared in the beer (at the brewery's restaurant). comes out a little thin-bodied in the end though."
"Drinkability: A bit too sweet to consume in any quantity but otherwise excellent"
"Opinion: I am pretty happy with this beer. This particular example has been in my closet for about 6 months now. I don't taste that this beer is aging, but the hops are such a big player in this beer that I would imagine that it is much more spicy when it is fresh...and of course I would like to try in at the brewery. This is a fine beer, and one that I will be trying again."
"Drinkability- All in all a very nice tripel. Certainly up there with the best looking and smelling ones. A bit to much hops for me and a touch to medicinal in taste. Overall though a nice beer that I would buy again."
"Wow, this may be the highest rated beer I've ever given - at least it's much better than some of the higher rated beers I've reviewed in my past. Absolutely wonderful in so many ways. The mouthfeel is just so overpowering, it stings the tongue even after you swallow. Nice head and carbonation, such a complexity of flavors. I'm not sure who brought this to our BA tasting and how long it's around, but I would love to get my hands on this again for a special occassion."
"Body is medium, with a light , fluffy texture and smooth, slick mouthfeel. No trace of the alcohol and dangerous drinkability."
"With its cloudy orange color, Gouden Carolus is definitely on the darker spectrum of Tripel Style Ales. It has a fine head of foam with nice lacing. The aroma is of citrus, spices and even some brown sugar, but it doesn't come out very sharply. The taste is fruity and a bit citrusy to start, but the malt flavor evaporates and quickly turns into a mildly sour and bitter finish that is dominated by a strong alcoholic taste. The mouthfeel is good, with plenty of carbonation and a medium body. I didn't particularly enjoy this one as the malt flavor was not robust enough and the alcohol was not as well hidden as it could have been."
"Pours a semi-clear yellow-golden color with plenty of off-white colored foam that disappears quickly and leaves behind thick lacing. Aromas of white grapes, flowers, alcohol, and taffy seem to come out nicely. The taste is a wonderful blend of earthy sweetness and fruit-derived sourness that gives this beer a strong finish. Hints of grapes and honey also come out as the beer warms. The texture of the beer is viscous and easily coats my tongue, but the alcohol is present in the taste and hence a reduction in the drinkability."
"Medium bodied, smooth, a bit sweet but balanced enough to drink easily."
"D: incredibly satisfying tripel for me. This is my first bottle of this beer since bringing it back from the Het Anker brewery sixteen months ago, and compared with those I had back then in Belgium, this bottle tastes more mellow with very good depth. I truly love this beer."
"It looks and feels like a good tripel, tastes like a slightly off tripel, and smells like bear shit. Not good."
"Although slightly carbonated, there was a soft creamy mouthfeel. Hints of slight citrus, banana, mild hops, yeast and sweet fruits were perfectly balanced. Overall this is what I expect from a great tripel."
"Het Anker has yet to let me down."
"Drinkability: Up there with the best Triples I've had. Lots of character, not a flaw to be found."
"Drinkability: Like I said, it started a bit harsh and unimpressive but it got better as it went down, leaving me wanting another. Not the best tripel Ive ever had by any means, but a good, solid one thats worth a try."
"Drinkability: Like any other gorgeous tripel, why would you want to make any beer such as this a session? Don't get me wrong, I could see maybe attempting it, but that's what my 4 is going on. Too many and you'd be able to probably discern less anyway, which diminishes the point of enjoying such a fine beer."
"Drinkability: I should have known not to begin drinking this one chilled. Flavors and aromas don't fully come forth until it warms considerably. Lots of complexity going on with this one. A solid Belgian Tripel, but I was expecting more."
"Drinkability is in one word heaven. Damn tasty beer here and I am not surprised, this brewery has yet to make a beer I do not adore."
"Worth seeking out."
"The aroma is wonderfully complex and subtle, but the alcohol presence in the taste just took too much away in my opinion. Now, I've always been sensitive to alcohol tastes (so much so that I can not drink any spirits straight.. no mix) and that might hamper me in this case. However, it seems to me that there are some nice nuances throughout this beer, but they just get run over rough-shod by the alcohol which is a shame. This is definitely a sipping beer, but even by those standards, the drinkability suffers. I see this as being neither easy to drink, enticing to drink nor would I want to drink more than one in an evening."
"Good beer. Maybe my new favorite for tripels."
"I thought I had seen it all with Tripel Karmeliet, but this comes pretty damn close. A true marvel! And an underrated one at that."
"Its a very good beer,good taste... i just take some points for those alcoholic sips that occur sometimes."
"Beer is good. Happy tripel beering."
"I'll drink this one anytime."
"A fine example of the style, and one that I enjoyed, yet what stands out for me the most at the end of the glass is the impression the aroma made on me. Quite the burst of summer sunshine in the orchard, that is what will actually draw me back to this stuff overall."
"Overridingly, the booze qualities are a bit ragged and seem to cloak any potential nuance. At best, it's a decent templatic tripel."
"330 ml bottle. Gouden Carolus Triple has a stylish, refined label; simple yet appealing. It poured near-perfectly, and I do mean that. As suggested by the brewery, I poured into a chalice glass in one movement of the bottle and left the sediment in the bottle. A meringue white head, pillowy and almost doughy looking formed a magnificent crown to a honey-brown, tawny beer, not sparkling but a little turbid. Stupendous retention on the head: this is a true beer epiphany; what I imagine when the words ""Belgian tripel"" enter my mind. The head scarcely looked real sometimes as I glanced at it, such was the density of the foam. The lacing, needless to say, was superthick and very viscous, and it leaves glass-covering sheets of the stuff, refusing to move and making the chalice look white from the outside. Magnificent. Delicious citrus immediately in the nose, super fresh and begging for you to try a sip. A little dusty hoppiness in closer, and a honey-smooth maltiness. As it warms I get more lightly toasted malt, lemon and pineapple, a light spicy piquancy, metallic notes, a very fleeting but noticeable tartness in the background, vanilla beans, and some other characteristic which eludes my description right now, but it is akin to extremely fresh cream or perhaps freshly cut wood, pine or balsam. Yes, the hops are here too in the smell, sometimes giving pungent earthy notes or strong dryness. Without question the best aroma of the last few Belgian tripels I have had. I feel a beer before I taste it, and as I expected from the richness of the appearance and the head, Carolus Triple has exceptional mouth-coating fulness. The word creamy does it no justice. Unctuous, palate-covering, almost ""fluffy"" on the tongue. Light and carbonated, yet filling and velvety, like sipping a cloud, or melted ice cream. At first the honey-caramel malts are tasted. The middle is where it is most complex: a little spicy hoppiness, vanilla, mollasses, warming alcohol, port-like, with blackberry wine or even the sweetness of ice-wine, along with all the citrus fruits. The middle also possesses a tastes of white-sugar and cinnamon. The complexity is exceptional, and gives new flavours with each sip. The finish clinches the beer as one of the greats. Masterful balance of the sweetness, a little yeastiness, and dryness. The dryness is wood-like in character. The alcohol is only noticed by the pleasant warming of the stomach, and this is a dangerous beer because it is so drinkable, but I have a feeling you would pay for drinking too many at one sitting. I would not want to drink several of these in a night anyway: it deserves better than that. This is something to sip appreciatively. 2 of these are heading into my cellar for a little ageing. In the meantime, I will be picking up a few more 4-packs of this and sharing them with my compatriots. As a conclusion I have to say that this really surprised and awed me. In the past couple of weeks I have had St Bernardus Abt 12, Corsendonk Pater and Agnus, Watou Tripel and St Bernardus Tripel, and for me personally, Gouden Carolus Triple surpasses them all. This might sound like too gushing of a review, but it really was this tasty: quite possibly the best beer of this year so far for me. This is the underdog of tripels, and I will be recommending it exceedingly."
"This has magical beer juju."
"For a tripel, it's pretty drinkable. But it's hard for me to rate this honestly because I do not like tequila. Still, it's a solid tripel- just not for me."
"Rich foamy head on golden. Strong deep taste, somewhat overpowering for a long lunch, it needed much food. Floral hops and honey yeast and orange aroma. Good smooth triple, pepper and spice and honey in taste. Certainly up to par with the other great beers I have had from this brewery."
"An almost overwhelming array of sensory experiences that create a wonderful whole. Nicely done."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle pours a cloudy yellow orange with a nice off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Fruity yeasty aroma of pears and apples. Sweet and malty fruity pear and tart apple flavors with a slight bubblegum yeasty taste. Medium-full body with a carbonated crisp mouthfeel, alcohol presence come out as it warms, finishes sweet, very nice."
"Overall a nice brew, albeit less suited to many foods than other tripels, because of it's persistant sweetness."
"drinkable! taste is light and body is light enough for a hot day. alcohol is a bit too pronounced and knocks the drinkability down some. still an expertly crafted beast here, and a dangerous one."
"1-inch plume of blistered, pock-marked head. Deeply golden to an orange hue with just a hint of haze and some beautiful cascading motion. Light summer, sweet cilantro and lemon/lime zest gratings on nose, with some spicy alcohol. Subtle, tangy malt with a shot of peach schnapps and some steel cut straw on mouth; frisonne of sunflower seeds and caramelized bananas. Overall, a cortex-crunching libation."
"Ut vivat, crescat, floreat!"
"Needless to say, quite drinkable."
"(11.2 oz / 330 ml)"
"Pours a two-finger white head that vanishes without a trace lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Nose is distinctly raisins, starts sweet and finishes sweet and sour but mellow. No hint of alcohol!! Another excellent triple. 330ml bottle for $3.49 from Hoosick St. Discount Bev, Troy, NY."
"Gouden Carolus Triple pours in with a huge head that stays and leaves nice laces at the glas. Smell is very fruity, orange, koreander and also some hops. Smelling this nice palate you can't wait for the first sip. Its Alcoholic, yeastspicy and freshness of koreander again. The all over dry taste ends nice and bitter. Mouthfeel is good but could be a litle fuller. Finished this botle that was best till 2-4-07 within 15 minutes so must be good too!"
"Taste is much like the smell, spicy and sweet. Light hint of cinnamon apples. Sour and peppery as it finishes. Really smooth and oddly creamy (for a tripel) Really one of the nicest textures I've had in a tripel. This one does not reveal it's strength in the body, though very flavorful. Watch out, it'll sneak up on you."
"Deep golden in color with a creamy off-white head. Swirling carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is yeasty and peppery, with a light touch of fruits. It has a really soft aroma overall. The flavor is spicy, peppery and yeasty. It is also somewhat earthy as well. It is light in body for its strength and very drying in the finish. A very smooth, easy drinking Triple."
"The beer pours a golde color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent that is slightly dry with a fruity yeast finish. It is rich and warm. The taste is good as well. It has a dry, warm, pale malt flavor that is rich and full of alcohol. It goes down slow and finishes slightly fruity and warm. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good tripel. It is a bit warmer than I would prefer, but it is full of flavor; a good drinker."
"You can smell the alcohol coming off this beer. I did a easy pour and ended up with no cloudiness. Nice white head that stuck around for a little while, didnt get much lacing. Alcohol warmed the tongue upon drinking. Good beer. Not fantastic. But then again Tripels aren't my favorite style. Interesting, but I don't think I would buy it again. There are just too many others out there that I like better."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Nice to drink, but not very complex. I hate to be odd man out, but this one just doesn't have the attributes of a great tripel."
"11.2 ouncer. No freshness dating exhibited. Pours a cloudy, hazy muddy shade of light brown, moderate white head and not leaving much lacing. Nose is fruity, musty, nutty, also alcohol present. First sip was kindoff sharp and biting, 9% clearly showing its fangs, as it warmed and mellowed, the flavors started to come out and shine. This flavorful brew, showed notes of nuts,fruits, yeasy phenolics. A Slight astrigent note also came foward. This is a Complex and interesting triple, certainly worth a try and worth trying over and over for lovers of the style."
"Golden Carolus Triple was served from a small bottle into a tulip glass, where it sat as a muddied, orangish golden-yellow nectar that was topped with a fine, blanketing white head that left sheet lacing. The nose offered orange-tinged malts that held interesting earthy-mushroomy notes and well-developed spices...zesty bitter orange peel and coriander. The taste reflected the nose, with tasty orange zest-tinged malts and subtler melded spices such as coriander and anise. The orange then takes on a mandarin flavor in the somehow refreshing, spicy-hop bittered finish with lingering spicy anise and coriander. The alcohol blends in very well with the hoppiness The body was excellently composed. This was one of the most drinkable triples I have ever experienced...skillfully balanced, not too huge, but still satisfying. Recommended for an introduction to the style, or even to Belgian beers as a whole."
"75 cl. bottle pours a light amber fluid with a decent two finger white head. Smells peppery, lemongrass.Medium bodied with a bubbley, lively mouthfeel. Superb lemongrass, black pepper, leather, and woody oak wine barrel taste. Finishes with a slight hop - alcohol tang. Another great Belgium triple."
"Other comments: Definitely a well-made Tripel, but I wouldn't consider it one of the best. Not a lot of complexity, though it is well balanced and the 9% abv is well hidden. May too well hidden!"
"It's better fresh but this is still great. Tropical fruitiness (lemon, pear, pineapple) throughout along with a mild hop bite on the finish. Just a great triple."
"The head is big and bubbly. The smell is sweet, fruity, and fresh. The taste wasn’t what I expected from the smell. The taste is very spicy, not fruity. With a strong burnt hops finish. Alcohol is detectable. Overall if you are looking for a tripple that is light on the fruit and strong on the hops, this is the one for you. Hop heads must try."
"The beer as it sets in the Triple glass is a ambiguous golden orange color, the head is portly in size, the color and off white, and the texture spumous, as the head decays, it leaves behind a fine covering of lace to seal off the glass. The nose is loaded with malt aromas, slightly plummish, crisp and fresh; the start is malt laden and lightly sweet. The top is middling in feel, the acidity biting, and the hops purposeful in their spicy bite, also vinous, tart and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting."
"Bottle: Poured a golden hazy beer with a huge head with perfect retention. Aroma is quite complex with a mix of yeast, hops, malts and something sweet like some orange. Taste is just incredible with a perfect mix between sweetness (this beer gotta have some candi sugar in it) and the hops. Alcohol is not noticeable at all, which is great when you have a 9% ABV beer. Overall, this is just wonderful, probably one the best discovery from my recent trip to Belgium."
"Hazy peach color (murky) with lots of bubbles in the goblet. Bid fluffy airy white head. Slightly sweet lemon rind nose. Juicy fruit flavors of peach and pine apple upfront then smooth onto a corrander and white pepper finish. Nicely balenced between the sweet fruit malt and spicy hop finish. Dry tongued herbal/grassy mouth after you swallow. Before you swallow you have a fuller smooth silky mouth. Avery nice brew... a complex rollercoaster."
"The taste, although showing off considerably the presence of its alcohol, manages to be quite complex ranging through fruityness and the malt down to a slightly bitter finale. The taste was quite similar, as well imo, to a strengthened pale ale such as 'sierra nevada' which made it quite pleasant."
"750 ml bottle corked and caged. No freshness date is listed, but it's a beautiful presentation with a black, gold and white label and a black and gold cage atop the cork. It pours a hazy golden orange with a full head of densely creamy white froth that holds exceptionally well and leaves some thick splashes of lace about the goblet. The lacing could be better, but given the 9% alcohol by volume not much more can be expected. The nose is candy sweet with a malty side to it that's nice; and some fruit (orange, apple, lemon) and peppery spice. It's even woody in a way. It's not real bold as tripels go; but it's clean, fresh, and inviting. The body is medium-light; and across the tongue it's lightly zesty with it's effervescent carbonation lending a tickle that's backed up by some light alcohol ""sting"". The flavor is as the nose suggests, but bolder with much more candy sugar and more apple flavor. It's light on the palate but satisfying, lending to a great deal of drinkability. Only it's alcohol content stands in the way of its being a highly drinkable beer; but that's only due to its intoxicating effect as the alcohol itself never really intrudes in the flavor. It's always present, but never becomes dominant. Quite well done; and certainly not one to be missed by fans of the tripel style."
"Regal gold appearance. Hazed slightly. Thick crop of white foam. Retention is outstanding. And lacing is quite full. Aroma is delicate, but complex. It's earthy, herbal, spicy, hoppy, yeasty and bready. The taste follows suit quite nicely. There's a nice ""farmyard"" presence about this beer. A little peppery addition on the palate. And great yeastiness. Mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated. And the body is light-medium. Kind of an airy mouthfeel. This is one nice Tripel."
"Drinkability: 9.0% be damned! Full speed ahead!"
"Light brown, tea-like murkiness. Pale head, diminishes quickly, very little lace, some small patches. Aroma is good, tropical fruit, esters, some faint vanilla. Low carbonation, medium body. Flavor is interesting, almost coconut-like fluffiness and style with accents of lime and breadfruit. Husky and perhaps a little yeasty. Some alcohol sense at the close, but well-integrated and slowly building. This is a fairly fascinating beer, some components are unlike any I've ever encountered. Distinct, slightly heavier than some, without a Tripel's dryness. But it is a stand out."
"My first try with this one, and now it's a new favorite, that I'll return to again and again...deeelicious!"
"This is a hazy gold-yellow Belgian ale with a large soft head that lasts forever and leaves a nice lace. It is refreshing despite its hefty alcohol content. The beer has a hoppy and fruity aroma that leads to a sweet, crisp taste with the hint of apricot. Corriander is evident and it finishes with a warming punch."
"This beer had a very active pour that produced a big, frothy head that slowly crackled down leaving a nice lace on the walls of the glass. Has a nice caramel color that is a bit cloudy. The aroma is very subtle. The head doeas not retreat all the way but instead blankets the beer that lies beneath it. The first sip seemed a bit weak but it might have been becaus it was overly cooled. It doesn't really have that Belgian Triple punch that I look for.The mouthfeel is a bit creamy & smooth. The taste is a bit sweet and grows less sweet as it warms. The aftertaste builds as it warms as well. This beer is a good long evening beer because at 9% you defineltly shouldn't be opporating any large equipment. Overall...a nice beer. Not the best triple I've had but then again, a triple is like sex. When it's good it's good and when it's not good, it's still pretty good. Cheers!"
"Orange/tan in color-supple lace and head that remain, yet fade to a minimal degree in time. Lots of tasty , yeasty specks noted throughout the journey-never too much albiet. Aromas hint pleasantly of citrus- orange/lemon as well as sweet malt and spice-especially coriander. This is a medium bodied work that finds an outstanding degree of balance in the way of fruity/malty/hoppy interplay. The beer finishes again citrusy, with spice and wild yeast notes chiming in also. A nicely drinkable offering that is quite elegant to boot."
"In 33 oz bottle: This beer poured a light golden color and formed a small bubbly white head that left a circular lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation and a small amount of sediment is present. An aroma of citrus, candy and butter, with an after affect of the alcohol present. A flavor of candy again with an emphasis on caramel with a hint of yeast. The finish is medium light and slightly sprite with some sweetness. A nice tripel, even if the alcohol does mean that it is a definate sipper."
"the drinkability goes like this: when i'm ready for a truly complex beer this is it. i'm really not sure if this can even be reviewed, it seems so special and so good."
"Highly drinkable beer, would love to have another"
"Deep golden color with a frothy white head, active carbonation, and intentionally poured flecks of sediment throughout. Nose is complex and dominant in its coriander, pepper, and peachy fruit with a hint of musty yeast and funky, earthy hops. Aroma of spearmint, as well? Very farmhouse-like in the bouquet. Taste is heavy, once again, on fresh pepper and coriander with additional emphasis on earthy hops, traces of honey and partially hidden citrus and ripe peach notes. Super smooth mouthfeel that possesses a profound creaminess. The abv never seems overwhelming and is well integrated throughout the beer. Though the spiciness and abv keep this beer from scoring perfectly in the drinkability category, it does possess some quenching characteristics and goes down quite easily for its size. A quality Belgian tripel from a notoriously solid brewery."
"Drinkability: A damn fine and well made tripel. I can see why it won the award touted on the label. My memory says the the Westmalle tripel is better, but not by much."
"Beautiful hazy gold-orange color. Beautiful off-white to beige colored head. Sweet candi, coriander deep orange and musty aromas arise from the GC glass. Big malt sweetness and texture mixed with coriander in the middle, finishing musty, sweet and the very faintest tart or dry. Rather bold and regal, if you will. Effervescent, thick and rich on the tongue. Something I will definitely miss on-tap. Drinks better because it has a more refreshing feel, but sweeter, than some other tripels."
"Drinkability: i wasn't overly impressed with this tripel. maybe i'm the crazy one."
"Update - It's not often that I find this beer but came across one in early Jan 2010 (probably a 2009 vintage) so had a chance to re-enjoy. The only thing I would add is that the appearance of the poor was much more pleasing, otherwise everything else is the same as my initial review. The spices are huge, the punch is definitely highly-charged orange, and the mouthfeel is out of this world."
"A simply fantastic tripel, and up there with St. Bernardus as a personal favorite. Definitely one that I would have again."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for splitting a shipment with me."
"On Tap - Poured with a beautiful head however that dissipated quickly and as I drank it left no lacing (all of which could be due to the semi-clean nature of the glassware). The aroma is full of tropical fruits! As I taste this beer I am stunned by the flavor... very fruity but not quite tart. A masterpiece of a belgian ale! A well balance mild sweetness, mixing in a light bittering and wonderful fruit flavors. Amazing! The flavor hints fruit roll-up which I find very odd... but this is just so much better! Wonderfully complex brew with no hint whatsoever of its rather large ABV. Excellent... i will drink this MANY more times!"
"Poured a large, foamy head, which lasted quite a while. Lots of carbonation. Quite a bite. More bitter than a lot of other tripels, with a nice, full mouthfeel. Tart and biting, yet quite flavorful. I really enjoyed the dujour, and this is also an excellent brew (which, by the way, I enjoyed in my new Gouden Carolus glass!). Unique amongst tripels, I will definitely try this again. (Maybe the 750 next time)."
"Pours a substantial, full and frothy head that dissipates rather quickly. A golden orange color with some haze, and an adequate amount of CO2. A resilient clinging lace. Rich fruity smell, with some hints of orange and yeast. The flavor is fruity sweet, almost syrupy, yet tart, with a lasting biting finish. The alcohol is well hidden, yet the warming effects can be felt quickly. The mouth feel was effervescent, lively and also creamy. A good beer with a distinct character, although I do not really care for the contrasting bite."
"Medium body, bitter afterstaste, hops and maybe licorice."
"Drinkability: Quite the drinkable tripel. This is a good example of the style, and one that I will certainly buy again soon."
"This is one of my favorite Belgian breweries, and they do not disappoint with their tripel."
"First let me say this one of the best overall tripels I have come into contact with, the type of beer that won't let you wipe a smile off of your face. Appears as a drop of sunshine in my glass with golden orange slightly hazed tone to it, huge mountainous layers of foaming vibrant white head mixed with yeast, leaves an even trickled lace with great head retention on this beast. I must give credit for my selection of this to Hart from the Sharp Edge, because this has been a beer I have overlooked for way too long. Aroma is heavenly with lucious spices along with waves of crescendoing malt tailed by honey richnss wrapped in deep tones of alcohol. Flavor great sweetness from the malt very rich and smooth and warming I truly love this beer simply amazing tripel. Mouthfeel is silky and buttery with carbonation that tickles the senses. Drinkability I could have more of these, but I would fall over when I tried to get off the bar stool."
"Pours a hazy golden/orange color with a massive off-white head that seems eternal. The blended aromas of fruit, spices, yeast, and light alcohol are near perfection. The taste repeats the smell with a tart yet lightly sweet fruit and faint spicing with the background yeast and a very warming alcohol that is well pronounced but not overwhelming. This beer is medium bodied and finishes with a lightly sweetened end with each swallow. A beautiful Belgian beer in my opinion! Op uw gezonheid!"
"Pours a hazy peach with enthusiastic, tight carbonation (sampling from a small goblet - the second pour was a little vigorous and foamed over). Vague but pleasant sweet aroma. Sharp and tingly on the tongue - very bright with peach and mango flavors. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, but clearly there. Not particulary dry at the finish, but clean nonetheless. A very drinkable tripel."
"Excellent all-round tripel."
"This beer pours a hazy very slightly yellowish orange color with a very large clingy, rocky, slightly creamy dissipating white head. The mouthfeel is full and rounded. The smell is candylike with an odd sort of grill rub(?!?) and bell pepper. The taste is again this odd grilling rub flavor, bell pepper, fruitlike, and warming alcohol. A most unusual flavored beer that I can't quite put my finger on but still pleasant and quite enjoyable."
"Golden orange, slight haze, pillowy white head with steady stream of carbonation that keeps the head replenished. Aroma to die for. Floral, fruity, spicey with a hint of alcoholic vapors. Flavor is akin to chewing on a pack of Juicy Fruit soaked in orange liquor. Initial sweet srypy mouthfeel is cut by a slightly drying, warm finish. This is full-on, no bars held, vwersion of a triple. Extremely enjoyable."
"Certainly, all the qualities are there. Tastes great too -- strong orange flavor mixed with a kind of candi sweet malt flavor. A tasty beer to be sure."

"Golden in hue w/ excellent clarity. Typically attractive, thick, fluffy off white head.  Citrus rind and tart fruity esters upfront in aroma, followed by prominent alcohol spiciness and light phenol riding along with candy sweetness.  Cider sweetness hits the palate initially, and fades into a pleasant melange of honey, raisin bread and lightly bittersweet alcohol.  Fruity sweetness is a constant foundation for the flavor profile.  Moderately bodied, w/ a dangerously smooth mouthfeel. Finishes w/ bittersweet peppery alcohol coating the tongue ensued by mellow alcohol warmth.  A delicious tripel, with excellent balance of fruit and spicy notes.  Cleaner and seemingly fresher than many other examples.  I would drink this all day if my body would allow it."
