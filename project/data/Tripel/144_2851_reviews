"very underrated imo, this one has some rather amazing/complex yeasty grassy/banana esters and not too sweet just slight touch of sweetness etc /accompanying taste/feel associated with that. Very refreshing/surprising xD very very continuously sessionable xD"

"Overall: This is not a special beer by any means, but is a good soft introduction for the tripel style. I would probably not drink this again because I know much better beers are much more available."

"O - Sprecher's Abbey Triple was one of my first adventurous craft beer endeavors years ago and made my top five list when I was featured on the podcast The High Five. Since then I've had it now and again, revisiting bottles from time to time including some more than five years old; my experiences have been this beer does not age gracefully. But this fresh bottle of Abbey Triple wonderfully showcases Belgian yeast and the juxtaposition of both subtle and powerful fruity and spicy components brought about wholly by fermentation. Abbey Triple is a lovely beer that's also dangerously drinkable."
"O: decent, but with a harsh feel."
""

"This beer pours out darker than I expect for a tripel and has almost no lasting head. The smell of the beer is where I would expect a tripel except there is a hint of caramel which I does not belong. It ends up making the beer taste sweet and, I believe, gives it a viscous mouthfeel. An excellent tripel would be drier than this, which registers with me merely as an interesting Belgian style ale that comes up lacking in the deadly deceitful drinkability that a tripel should have."
""
""
""
"O: This beer has enough going on to compare with some of the better trippels out there, but doesn't pull the whole package altogether like St. Bernardus or Tripel Karmeleit. The yeast-forward approach is nice here, and the beer is very attenuated and refreshing. The acidity of the flavor could be toned down some- which is maybe suggestive of hotter fermenation temps."

"This has a nice taste and not a bad interpretation for a German-style brewery!"
""
"My dog growing up's name was Abbey. This DOES NOT taste like dogs. This is clearly beer. It was okay beer. Like other Sprecher ones, it is kind of a pseudo-european style. Perhaps it is okay if I had nothing else. But they seem to not be on the forefront or cutting edge of craft brewing."

"Beer of thr month club beer. Pours goldenish copper with fluffy one finger head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is yeast, pear, banana, honey. Dry smelling with just a hint of funk, but on the sweet side for the style. Sweet flavor with lots of pears and honey, pleasant and easy to drink. Light mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. Not half bad."

"Low C+"

"Mouthfeel has a medium to light body with high carbonation."

"overall: Nice Tripel. Alcohol seems half of what it is. Dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a Belgian. The orange flavor gives it a great all around mouthfeel that isn't overwhelming at all& something I'd like to drink again, no doubt."
""
"This was part of this month's beer of the month club so I'm glad I've got a couple more bottles after this one because this was pretty good. The Belgians won't lose any sleep over this, but it's pretty good for an American rendition."
"Overall - Not my favorite Belgian ale. Taste is complex but I find the aftertaste to be mildly unpleasant; funky is really the only way that I can describe it. Not bad but not a beer I would look for again."
""
""
""
""
"Not a great example, but not a bad example either. A good Am. version that is well priced and acceptable for style."

"Fruity and a bit lighter than I was expecting. Nice pear-ish aromas, solid mouthfeel without being cloying. I enjoyed it enough to buy some at the brewery (which is an awesome place to tour!). A solid representation of the style... Sprecher is almost more European than the Europeans."
""
""
"O - Overall, this was ok. Not sure I would go back to it, but it was a nice offering."
""
""
""
"Sampled as part of a flight at Sprecher's in Wisonsin Dells. Pour was golden without much head or lace. Smell lightly of bananas, malt and sweetness. Tastes has bananas, fruit as well as a layer of spice - cloves. Finish is mildly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium to light, firm and somewhat creamy. Overall has good Belgian elements but is uncomplex in a way that actually makes it quite easy to drink."
""
"Overall: kind of a mediocre tripel, it doesn't excel in any particular category. Not terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have this again."

"16 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 1/28/2011. Pours hazy deep orange amber color with a fairly dense 1 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Decent spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of apple, grape, banana, caramel, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, bread, honey, and spicy yeast esters. Pretty nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity; they were slightly offensive at first but got a lot better as it warmed up. Taste of pear, apple, banana, caramel, candi sugar, honey, herbal, clove, bread, and light spicy yeast. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, candi sugar, honey, herbal, clove, and light yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Pretty good complexity and balance of flavors; with no cloying sweetness at all surprisingly. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Tripel with a pretty unique flavor profile. It could use some more carbonation and spiciness to balance out the malty fruitiness; but overall it is still quite enjoyable and easy to drink."

"The taste overpowers the mouthfeel, but I suppose that it's on par and average."
""
""
""
""
"M. There's a sort of faintly greasy, oily texture going on in here that I really dislike. Other than that, medium-heavy thickness with light carbonation."
""
""
""
"Overall damn this beer was old and yeasty but held true to it's base of a pretty nice Belgium ale. Would like to try it again and probably will. Hopefully fresh this time."

"Good, especially at the 6.79 price I paid for 4 bottles. Will be buying this year after year. It is a nice belgian when you do not want to be knocked over with power and flavor."
""
""

"It wasn't until this year I found out Sprecher makes something besides root beer. This one was a nice treat. a cloudy orange color with low carbonation. It smelled of orange and a bit of yeast. The taste was nice, orange, clove, citrus, blended in a way that had several elements and presented them well, but not in a striking manner. Quite smooth and just a hair on the thin side. It hides the alcohol until the very end of the glass. Would I get again? Yup!"
""
""
"Overall: I was expecting more from this brew. Wasn't impress with the moutfeel. All the fruit and floral hops with the alcohol burn just didn't cut it. Cheers."
"I've had this on brewery tours but finally picked up a single to review. Cardboard in the smell was light, probably shouldn't be there on a 4 month old tripel though. Taste was high gravity malt liquor grape flavors with better quality malt backbone. Not too good."

"O-A very nice triple. Smooth and well balanced blend of yeast, malt and hops. I really like the body of this beer. Nice to get a good triple at this price. Comparable to most good triples I've had and would drink this one again."
"D: Almost too drinkable. Really tasty. Different from real Belgian tripels but a fun drinking experience."
"This was a very meh beer. I know that alcohol is supposed to be present, but not dominant like in this one. Got way way sweet and cloying in the end."
"Little to no head. Smells of yeast with a pronounced banana flavor, taste deviates little from the smell. Mouthfeel and taste are more like a Belgian Strong Ale than a Triple; it feels more fragile and brittle than the fluffy head and body I would have expected. Alcohol comes to the fore upon warming, a little overwhelming. Overall, better than I remember it being. I'm wondering if when they switched from 16 to 12 oz. bottles if they didn't tweek the recipe a bit. Definitely worth a spin for those whose palates have not become too spoiled by the top shelf stuff."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a slight head but diminishes quickly leaving only a little lacing. Scent is very floral and fruity. I'm pickiny out appricots, hibiscus, and banana. All of which is very inviting. Taste is rather interesting with a lot of the same taste as the scents with a yeasty taste. Very smooth and mellow with a great full texture. Leaves a little bit of a biiter/dry after taste. Probably one of the most interesting Sprecher's products I've had."
"O - best bang for the buck considering the higher than average ABV. Would be my beer of choice if it were available in my area."
"I didn't get a whole lot of malty flavor, just a little bit with a nice roasted note in the middle. I keep a 4 pack of growlers around all the time now, love it."
"O: I dug this one... More than the average bear even. This was my first Sprecher beer and it didn't disappoint,"
"O: Overall, a good tripel and very reasonably priced. I could use more fruit aromas and flavors and a lighter body. Still, it's not a bad beer at all."
"O: Over sugar ending and heavy mouth feel really misses the true style of this beer."
"D/O- Nothing sticks out taste-wise, either good or bad. To be blunt, sixteen ounces was tough to finish knowing there are better options in the refrigerator. Still weirded out by the Sprecher twist-off caps."
"O: A good beer overall, but timid and prosaic compared to the best examples of the style. I think my rating compares it more to beer in general than to this Tripel versus all others-- on that scale, it would be rated lower. Nevertheless, enjoyable, dirt cheap, and always available. Perfect for the ""2 days until payday and I don't want to drink BMC if I don't have to"" type of situation."
"Fuller medium body, milder carbonation, sticky and syrupy. This really wasn't my style, too sweet and unbalanced overall."
"This tripel pours out as a bright golden yellow with a thin white head on top that fades by the end of the last sip. The aroma is quite lively here. It's got a lot of strong white grapes on the nose that kind of remind me of Midas Touch. The flavors basically mimicked the Midas Touch as well. Not really my favorite tasting Triple out there. The mouthfeel was a little light which didn't really help this brew in my opinion. I think if it was a little thicker it'd be much better. Overall this beer isn't bad, I'd like to try it aged one day just to see how much it would change."
"D - Alright beer; not bad for a Tripel, makes a better food pairing beer, without to much strength and overpowering aromas; could be OK for the summer"
"Value: AMAZING. The snobs will score this one low. But read their other reviews and take heed- for a snob is always a snob. And if it don't cost 8 bucks a bottle, they don't like it."
"Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit. True, it wasn't exactly a Triple (way too clean & sweet & American-ish pumpkin-pie) but it was quite drinkable although I was happy to cut myself off after just one full serving. A super local, extremely fresh product with a nice taste & high ABV."
"It is a drinkable beer--Sprecher rarely makes a total dud, they're pretty solid--and it's a great deal compared to expensive Belgian tripels--you can buy a whole 4 pk of 16 oz this for less than some single Trappist 11.2 oz...great value, although I probably won't purchase often."
"This beer pours a cloudy dark orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of compost. There are rotten tangerines, lemons, and flowers. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall, this is a bad beer. I will not drink this beer again."
"The finish is only slightly dry, unlike true Belgian Abbey Ales. The flavors hide the alcohol content very well. Easy to drink and quite refreshing."
"Pours golden with a really nice white head and a good dose of lacing. Transparent with some good carbonation and a thick collar. The nose brings pear, banana, spice, and yeast. Quite delicate. The taste is as well with some light pepper and mild fruits. Really smooth with great carbonation levels. Quite drinkable. I liked this a lot more than the Dubbel. Thanks again, Andy!"
"D - Easy drinking for the style and relatively enjoyable beer. It just isnt what I expected from a 9% Tripel."
"An easy drinking beer...just a little uneventful. Not one Id seek out, but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"D: There are better Tripels out there, but this is still a nice beer. Spresher has done an excellent job of masking the beer's strength. I just wish that there was more complexity at work. Overall, this is a very mixed offering. But I'm still glad I picked it up."
"Once again, this isn't bad, but I was pretty eager to finish this and order something else. Luckily, the next beer made up for this."
"Another offering set aside for me by VDubb86 and enjoyed in his basement bar. (Didn't Rush sing of basement bars? Good times.) It pours a hazy pale orange-amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises banana, clove, orange zest, and black pepper. The taste holds the above, as well as ginger, coriander, and a pinch o' nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a solid tripel, but nothing overtly special or impressive. I'd call it a very nice go-to, ""sessionable"" (relatively-speaking, I guess) tripel."
"Definitely a sipping beer due to both its sweetness and high ABV."
"I don't know, it's not too bad, but the alcohol is a bit tiring. Still, I finished this alright. Drinkable for what it is."
"The appearance was spot on with a nice light golden orange color with an extremely thin layer of white foam on the top. The aroma was of bananas, clove and a smidge of orange zest. The taste was of honey and ginger with hints of lemon behind them. the higher alcohol level was a bit apparent in the taste by causing a slight bitterness on the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel was a nice crispness that was accentuated by the higher levels of carbonation in the beer, yet it still remained light on the palate. Overall it was an easy-going tripel style beer but at 16oz a pop, definitely a one per night deal. A recommendation from me, it's one of the better brews that Sprecher puts out."
"D - Average drinkability. ABV might move me off having more then one or two but overall not bad."
"D - This is a decent attempt at a tripel, but it's almost like a really strong weizen beer also, probably because of the banana-yeast character, which is not uncommon to a tripel, but usually not the biggest player. (How's that for a run-on sentence) For a more traditional tripel, it could be a little dried, lighter and spicier. That said - not a bad beer - and it's in my grocery store aisle, so the bar is being raised."
"Drinkability: Very smooth, tasty, and refreshing. A good brew from a great brewery."
"It is a fine regular offering of this excellent brewery. The quality of the beer is on par with others from Sprecher and matches the smokey character you will remember from most of the beers they produce. Still, it is unique enough to have a regular place in the offerings and I was glad to have bought the 4 bottle pack which my wife and I both enjoyed. It was worth the price."
"I thought this was a good example of the style. You can probably get better tripels for cheaper, but I'll enjoy the 4 pack."
"For the price, this and kerberos represent a solid tripel rotation for me."
"D: It was overall just alright for me.. Not something I will really come back to."
" ~ This is a very drinkable brew. Unfortunately I only purchased one of these Tripels a year ago. I wish I had another one."
"A bit more boozy than I look for in a true triple, abv shouldbe hidden a bit more stealthy. Looking for larger head and more lace."
"Not as complex as some triples I have had. But very pleasant and drinkable."
"Appears a clouded golden amber heu with a bright white head, fine speckled lacing coats the glass. Aroma has banana clover and all sorts of Belgian or German inspired tones. Flavor has a very thick sweet banana, and clove explosion going on. Syrup and alcohol notes hit the palate this is not an Abbey triple this is underfermented Wisoconsin triple. Anyways it tastes like a dessert beer, nothing wrong with that just don't call it an Abbey Triple. Carbonation was fine just the body was filled with residual sugars alcohol clearly evident just not the beer I'm lookin for. Drinkability overall was okay not a beer I'd reach for within the style but there's something about Sprecher brews that I do enjoy even though they're not up to style."
"Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy golden orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes, and spiced. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly bitter, yeasty, and spiced. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty brew."
"D- Overall a decent beer. The problem is that the price of a 4 pack would make it difficult to pick this over other Belgians or Belgian-style beers."
"D - This is a pretty good brew from Sprecher. It seemed like an authentic Belgian."
"D-This is a very drinkable beer and I like that in the Sprecher gift shop it has the same price point as the other beers!"
"Purchased from the Sprecher gift shop in Glendale, WI. Pours an orangish golden body with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is fruity esters of apricot and apple. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a spicy carbonation. Good fruity flavors, slight sourness. Good drinkability."
"D: Very. I can't complain when a four pack (4) of 16 oz bottles costs me $7.40. Definitely think Sprecher could do a bit more with this though."
"(D)- A solid to great Triple that was the first one to introduce me to this style. There are better ones out there, but for the price, you really cant go wrong with this one. Simply delicious."
"Nice job at a Belgian triple but still not as good as the real thing."
"D- Some people may be inhibited by the sweetness of this beer but I rather enjoy it and thus makes it more drinkable. The ABV is rather high but I could put a few of these back with ease."
"Overall, not a bad tripel a lot of flavors. A decent rep of the style, but not something I would buy on a regular basis."
"D: I think I could drink for a while, and I think I would get pretty hammered. I did not think this was over eight percent."
"With the medium body and almost flat carbonation, I can't stand to drink too much of this strong concoction."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, Candi like, yeasty, and semi dry."
"The high level of sweetness almost bothers me and I'm usually OK with sweet so it's not bad for drinkability and the alcohol is well covered. While not a bad beer, I don't think it fits the style in enough ways."
"Dark gold to light amber in color. Very active prickle and no head. I can hear the ""sounds"" of the carbonation as I pour it into the glass. Mildly fruity on the nose. Fresh and light attack, but it instantly goes into a heavy and malty presentation. The flavor is heavy and malty and the mouthfeel is consistent with this as well. There is a mild sweetness imparted upon the beer by its heavy malt concentration. The finish leaves the mouth dry with a mild bitterness at the finish. The body does a nice job of hiding the 8.4% abv. A little different from the other Sprecher offerings that I have tried."
"Taste/Mouthfeel: Smooth and has a malty sweetness with a light bit of hoppy citrus. For some reason I think of sweet tarts. I love the feel of the beer: very smooth and silky on the tongue with a delicate sizzle from the carbonation. The alcohol gives is a spiciness."
"Overall, this is a reasonable beer for a local tripel. The flavor could have been packed in a bit more and the balance and mouthfeel oculd have been better. It is a decent beer although not something I will readily search out."
"D-In the end becomes to much for my palate as the sweetness starts to overwhelm as it warms up. A well made brew for sure, just not what I like."
"Overall not a balanced beer, not a good example of a ""Belgian"" which are in my opinion the best in the world, and I found it only moderately enjoyable. I would recommend someone only try a single of this first to see if they like it, and then move onto a 4-pack if they find it good."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a golden color with a clean white head that foams with an aggressive pour. There is nice lacing and the visible carbonation sparkles when held up to the light. The smell is full of fruitiness, orange, lemon, some hints of clove and a mild yeasts. The taste has a strong wheat flavor, a strong bouquet of fruit, a little more than my liking. OK balance in the finish. Could have one or two of these but that is about all."
"This is a great Tripel and well worth seeking out."
"D: I frequent this beer very often and it just keeps me comin' back for more its a great triple and I think anyone can say that if they like a triple they will like sprechers triple. Even as it warms it's tastes and aromas just jump out at you."
"Drinkability: I don't see any reason why this couldn't be the best triple I've ever had. It is complex and powerful. It has the right amount of earthy spice to negate any chance of cloying sweetness which usually occurs in this style. Top notch."
"Note - The bottle label has completely changed..."
"Mouthfeel is watery, despite the appearance of lots of carbonation."
"Chill hazed deep gold with a wisp of whitish foam that disappeared almost immediately, even with a constant stream of bubbles rising to the surface. Fruity banana aroma, cloves, bready, crackery malt, light alcohol. Moderate bitterness, quite sweet, bready yeast, alcohol, fruity, honey. Medium bodied with average carbonation, mild warmth, just a hint of dryness from the alcohol. It's okay as far as beer goes, but it was merely a very average, perhaps subpar, attempt at a tripel."
"Overall - This is a very disappointing example of a Tripel. It is unfitting of the style, it seems to me more like a malt liquor with dates and a watered down taste. I would not recommend it unless you enjoy subpar surprises... reviewed from notes"
"this beer has a fruity wheat beer taste. then there are no hops and it mellows out fast in your mouth. it tastes like no other and if your into lambeic or flemish red this may be in the ballpark for you. my wife did not care much for this beer due to its oddball sour taste. but hay i loved it and would get it again, it makes me proud that this beer is brewed in the us of a!"
"Pours a golden, honey amber with just a little foam after the pour. No foam what-so-ever after a few sis though :(. OK bubbling. Toasted caraml and cracker with some sugared lavender and a little yeasty fruit. Ripe apples, small stawberries, maybe even some red currants start the fruit palate off. But its all too dry and sudden with a somewhat alcoholic finish. This beer lacks balance. An even keel would round ot this beer much better. OK aromas, not-so-hot appearance, and a mediocre taste make for a subpar triple."
"Good golden color with a nice caramel smell. It has good carbonation in the mouth helps set off the flavor. Nice flavor very enjoyable, much better then normal, balanced and smooth. Maybe they should start aging this one before they sell it would be a nice improvement."
"Pours golden with lots of white head, that leaves a spider trail of lace. Sweet yeasty aroma.White pepper, clove, corriander spicey. Average mouthfeel,sweet supported by significant carmel, smooth drinking.Active carbonation. Not very sophisticated, not a bad one."
"D: The sweetness of this offering limits its drinkability."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice and produced a small head with little retention. The smell of sweet malts,bready yeast, and tropical fruit. Taste of banana, pear,apricot, with a buttery sourdough like finish. High carbonation hits the tongue, and continues all the way to the back of the throat. A easy drinker, and at 16oz a bottle a good deal for the price. This may be the first Belgin style Triple I've had that comes with a twist-off cap. I will not hold that against this very enjoyable offering."
"Drinkability is alright, a good beer but way to sweet for me to drink more than once."
"Not a bad beer, just not great for a tripel. Appearance is pretty good. A nice copper color, but little head or lacing. Smell is slightly alcoholy, but some nice dark fruit comes through as well. Taste is more of the same but seems a bit watered down. Mouthfeel is good, medium in body and a little carbonation. Drinkability is average."
"Opinion: Well, it is beer. I would have liked to have tried this beer when there was still some life left in it. This example is getting old, so my review will reflect that. I wouldn't mind trying it again as a fresher example, but I won't be seeking this beer out because I can tell that it was never really a world class Tripel even when it was fresh. I have tasted a lot of old Tripels, and this one is lacking in quite a few respects even though it is old. Try it if it is convenient, and if not, stick to the boys in Belgium."
"Drinkability: Nice; not the best or most interesting tripel, but a good stab at the style even if the alcohol is a bit too prevalent."
"i liked this one a lot"
"D: Decent beer, Worth a try, This is style I am not huge fan of but I enjoyed the one I had."
"This is a loser. Not even remotely close to a good tripel, and pretty bland and bad overall. If it weren't for Merry Monks I would say this is the worst tripel I've ever had - lucky for me (I think? no, nevermind, not lucky at all) I've had Merry Monks. Pass."
"D: a very nice American version of a Belgian Tripel. solid brew and worth a try."
"D: Decently drinkable. Overall Sprecher offers some quality beers...this one is average for them. Have cellared this over 1 year...perhaps too long for this one? Seems a little past peak. Will have to come back to this one again in the future."
"This abbey triple might be the hefeweizen i've been looking for. pours a cloudy golden orange with a nice white head that fades a little too quickly. the smell is very upfront with the fruity esthers, i love what the little yeasties did there... and is there some spice? and the taste is much the same fruit, malt and spice followed up by some pretty heavy carbonation. a tastey beverage, thanks a lot weswes."
"Average drinkability. The 8.4% ABV would put my limit at two."
"Worth trying, but nothing compared to the best of the tripels."
"While this is a really good beer overall, it is certainly nowhere near my favorite Tripel. Still worth a try as it was enjoyable."
"Goes down real easy and at 8.4% is quite refreshing and smooth. Surprisingly tasty!!"
"pours a fairly clear gold tinged w/amber sporting a thin white head which settles into a modest ring of lacing in my snifter ; a strong smell, woody & tequila-like aroma initially, then warming into a weird ""mystery dark fruit", a bit of sweet/spicy, eye-burning alcohol noted as well ; a sweet prune/licorice flavor at first with a blend of nuts and some other darker fruits about midway, a bit tart and metallic in the finish ; a full body on this one, not dry in the least, quite moderately carbonated as well, might be why it feels so thick ; a bit different than most trippels i've had, but not unpleasant..."
"D: An OK tripel, not a beer I'd seek out again, got bored with it at the end."
"D- i really liked it"
"Awesome beer, I would look for this again."
"This beer poured copper with some red highlights and very little head. The smell is mostly fruitiness with some floral hints. The taste starts off with some sweet fruity maltiness that gives way to a fairly dry finish with some detectable alcohol. Very tasty, but a little one-dimensional. The mouthfeel is thick with a middling amount of carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but it might sit a little heavy to have more than one at a time."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a 1/4"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet, pale malt scent along with a very fruity Belgian yeast aroma. I'm not detecting any alcohol scent or earthiness. The taste is decent as well. It is very sweet up front with a dry and slightly earthy finish. It goes down quick for a tripel, yet warms a bit on the way down. The mouthfeel is average. It is a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This isn't an offensive beer, but there are better tripels out there."
"Sprecher's Abbey Triple is definitely decent and drinkable but unspectacular compared to what else the style has to offer. It doesn't really excel in any area, but is overall a decent brew."
"dry. A pretty faithful rendition of the style."
"Drinkability: one is enough for me. Not my favorite, but not too bad."
"Not one of the better tripels I've had, but drinkable and worth a try. At only $5.99 for a 4 pack of 16oz bottles, I can't think of a less expensive tripel I've tried."
"Sprecher Abbey Triple pours an orange color with a white head from a brown bottle. The aroma is mostly caramel malt. The flavor is also strong on caramel malt, with a bit of fruit (apple and pear especially) and some pepper that most likely comes from the alcohol. Worth a try."
"d- could easily have a couple of these, i prefer darker beers but this is a nice difference"
"drinkability is decent. this brew is high on the cirtus scale, without much else to call its own. not a bad brew, but there is much better to seek out in the realm of tripels."
"Pours a slightly fogged amber gold. Slight off white head. Nose is like stale dough. And there is barely anything to that still. A very muted nose overall. Flavor is tangy. Orange citrus, slight yeast. Tangy is the keyword here though. Feel is standard on the liquid and nice on the carbonation. Overall a good drinking experience. Something isn't exactly there for a tripel, but I guess I need to keep in mind that this is a ""new world"" tripel. Is it good? Yes. Should you try it? I say, yes."
"All in all, a fine beverage that would go well with dessert, and is a dessert itself in some ways."
"I found this on sale in the 4 pack. The price was right and, so, I decided to give it a chance. When I poured it into a glass, it looked like a nice Triple...not much head to speak of (but fine). It smelled pleasant, more like a Heffe Weizen though. It tasted like a Heffe Weizen with some spiritedness, stretching for the elite Triple classification (but falling short). I appreciated this one for what it was. In some respects, it exceeded my expectations...mainly, because I'm not much of a fan of Sprecher beer. I would give it high marks for effort and the price point. Once I dispensed with my prejudice about Triples and judged it as a Heffe Weizen, I rather liked it. It's a huge Heffe Weizen... a surprisingly big beer...not to be underestimated. I liked the interplay of sweet, warmth and spice."
"I think this will be getting passed by from now on. There's so many great tripels out there it's hard to justify spending the money on this beer. A little of a disappointment from Sprecher. Stick to the German style brews guys that's where you shine."
"Overall: Not a very good tripel and far from the best Sprecher has to offer. If you want a tripel save your money and pass on this one, there are too many wonderful ones out there."
"This beer pours a very cloudy dark orange color with a very small head and doesn't seem to have much carbonation. The aroma is right on if it were a weizen. Full of bananas and sweetness. The flavor is very sweet and there is a lot of banana flavor. There might be a hint of clove in there as well. No pepper character and the alcohol is slightly apparent. The body is almost thick due to the extreme sweetness. The drinkability is ok, but I probably won't have this one again."
"Really enoyed this beer, Abbey Tripels are not my favorite, but, was talked into trying this. And VERY glad I did. Very surprised also by the lower ratings. Maybe the rougher finish has something to do with it?"
"There are some good fruity flavors, but this seems to be too heavy and sweet compared to others."
"A decent brew but even they do better with other styles."
"16 ounce bottle without any freshness/bottleing info, although some little numbers are etched onto the neck, but I can make no sense if it. Pours cloudy, medium apricot/amber, a forceful pour lifted a nice 2 finger med. tan head, that showed respectable retention and left plenty of long lasting blotchy lacing. Nose is fruity and floral, with a noticable hint of alcohol. Notes of light pepper, tropical fruits, honey, some yeasty, bubblegummyness. Easy drinking, very pleasant, very tasty Belgian style creation ( a tripel?, not sure here) . Well worth gettting a few bottles of this nectar.I'm very suprised by the low review numbers for this one. More highly worthy Belg. style brew from a U.S. brewer."
"Were this classified as an American Strong Ale, some of these ratings might go up. But, for a tripel, it falls far short."
"Way too sweet in my opinion. This made my teeth ache and i had dreams of my teeth falling out aftwerwards."
"If I had my druthers I'd opt for anything else from Sprecher. They haven't let me down until now, and perhaps I've just come across a bad batch. I should be back in Wisconsin within a few weeks and I'll try to seek out another sample. Additionally, I'll let it settle in the fridge for a week or so longer to sediment the yeast."
"Drinkability: I typically enjoy Sprecher brews, and this one was not bad to drink. I just don't think it hit the mark of a Belgian Triple. Not enough fruit and sugar, flavors don't have much depth."
"Last swigs: Tangerine Belgian pale. Seems to miss the true tripel designation without a bready dough or spice and a pronounced fruit prescence. Refreshing and benign. Nothing amazing but tasty with a solid structure of sweer sugar holding throughout."
"16 oz. bottle- color of hazy dark honey , with a tanish medium head - nose of molasses , dried fruit , sour tannic , gram cracker , citrus , tawny port , oats , slight honey , and metallic  taste of port , cinnamon , molasses , malts, and metallic again - body oily , but thick , and low carbonation  aftertaste of honey , brown sugar , and tannic"
"This definitely strikes me as a stereotypical (except that there are many great interpretations done by Americans now a days) American attempt at making a Belgian beer; while technically correct, it lacks the finesse and balance of the real deal."
"I've changed my tune a little over the course of the bottle. This beer may not be anywhere near world-class, but its friendly fruitiness and its well-rounded nature is impressing me more and more as the ounces disappear. Even though it's a bit out of character for this 'German first' brewery, and even though it isn't the most complex tripel on the block, Abbey Triple is still delicious, drinkable beer. In the end, that's all that matters."
"Decent amber orange pour, some light ivory lacing. Not much aroma, unfortunately, and not much Belgium yeast or candy cane in here. In fact, its more on the side of a spicy Oktoberfest than Tripel. Almost a sub-par stab at a Tripel. Time to move on and quit the crying in my beer."
"Bland in flavor, and missing a bunch of flavors typical of a Tripel. A lightweight version that's seriously lacking. One positive is that there's nothing offensive here in flavor."
"A good apetizer if you will. This beer's pretty good, but it leaves a little something to be desired."
"D- This beer doesn't have any fruity notes and more lager notes that tripel qualities."
"A standout at the Beer Advocate American Beer Festival (2006), this beer does not disappoint. Currently only has distribution in the Boston area on the East coast, but I was promised it is coming to New York soon. Can't wait."
"Sort of glad I only have one of these."
"I don't think this bock is all that bad! It poured a clear orange/amber with very little foam that disapated with in seconds. The smell of sweet malts and fruit filled the nose, with just a hint of candy. The taste was just a little to sweet for me, but not all that bad. The taste of roasted malts, sweet candy and caramel was very evident. A little weak at the finish with a semi dry finish at the end. Not bad, but once is enough for me."
"Thanks to the skewed taste, drinkability suffered. This isn't all that good as far as tripels go. Thankfully, my wife liked it so she gets the remaining two bottles. My advice: think twice before picking up the four-pack. If you have to get it, opt for a single."
"OK, let's get this done- mouthfeel and drinkability. It's OK. Not impressed. I have a Westmalle Tripel in the fridge just screaming for me now. Do I even finish this one? Hard call."
"Poors a rusty orange, completely transparent and devoid of yeast, with absolutely no head. Nose is sweet caramel malts, and musty fruit cocktail. Taste is rife with overripe fruits, cloyingly sweet candi sugar and caramel malt. 8.41% is non-existent. Moutfeel is thick and syrupy, lacking in the dry, spicy finish I come to expect in a good tripel. I was really disappointed by this one. I got down to the last few sips and really didn't care to finish it. Stick to the Germans, Sprecher."
"Received a bottle courtesy of Zorro in BCG BIF"
"First sip average body with very fine and prickly carbonation. The beer is less sticky than I thought it would be form the nose. Flavor starts sweet and sugary like the nose, has pear notes as well. I get just a bit of doughy yeast and then the beer finishes very dry. ALmost puckers my lips with its drying out. No hint of alcohol and very easy to drink. This a tasty beer. Is it a tripel? Could be a little stickier and more complex, but a good stab at the style that could be a crossover to belgian style brews."
"Over all a pretty decent beer. I'd recommend trying it, especially since it is only $3.50 on tap at Whistle Binkies."
"This really doesn't seem like a beer to me at all. Pours a burnt orange, with quite a bit of head at first. Oops, it's gone. Smells like overripe citrus and yeast sourness. Fruit again in the taste, no hint of backbone anywhere. Malt profile is thin, which really doesn't pair well with the overall thickness of this brew. I like a little more out of my Tripels, but that's just me. Sprecher seems like an alright brewery, they were just a wee bit off base with this one."
"drinking this thing is a chore. i don't know if i will finish the bottle."
"drinkability: ehh, i'll finish it out of respect for sprecher, but not a very good tripel"
"Kind of bland, sour, and there is something about the balance that I can not figure out."
"Notes: This is not one of the better tripels out there but its decent and if it was a local brew I'd give it more of a chance to grow on me. Decent."
"Drinkability would be good if that one taste defect wasn't there. Possibly I got an off batch? BevMo has a very fast turn over of beers."
"16 ounce bottle. Pours out a clear, golden orange color with almost no head. The aroma is sweet and grainy with tropical fruits. Lots of grain flavor with cloying sweetness and fruits, including apples and peaches. Other than that, I taste harsh alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little buttery. This beer is not totally undrinkable, but it's a mess. It seems to me that American brewers really have trouble with this style. Below average."
"Cheers!"
"Go Milwaukee!!!"
"Skip this one and stick with Sprecher's Black Bavarian."
"16 oz bottle pours a clear copper color with a decent off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Funky vegetable and cereal aromas. Sweet bready, honey and caramel flavors, medium bodied with a lightly carbonated watery mouthfeel, finishes sweet. Not a very good example of the style"
"Pours a brilliant coppery-orange color with a patchy head sitting over top. Good looking beer. Nose is light raisin, like those made from white grapes. I get little bits of banana in there as well. Flavor is banana and raisin. I would like a little lemony flavor in there. Its tasty, but not what I expect a triple to be. Feel is moderate to thick with a light carbonation. I'd like a more spritely carb as well. Overall, its a tasty beer, but I don't think its anything special. I'd like it to have more of a citrus character and even a touch of spiceyness there as well. This seems more like a wheat beer, minus the majority grain being wheat."
"Drinkability is very mediocre on this one, very let down by Sprecher as this was one of their seasonals I was really looking forward to trying."
"I recommend to at least try this one."
"Drinkability is average, low points on stylistic comparison and the aftertaste is really kind of off-putting. It's a well-made beer but the flavors seem out of place for a Tripel. I've come to expect better from Sprecher."
"To say the least, I am very glad that I am within 1 mile of Sprecher. Not everyone can be so close to a brewer of a Tripel. This is one of their seasonals to preceed the their winter brew. I have drank many of these without reviewing but this time I poured it into a Duvel tulip and it really brought out all the angles. The color is deep rudy golden and the aroma is reminder of belgian malt. I must disclaim that most beers shine in the aroma department when drank out of a tulip. Anyways, the taste is a little duller than some tripels but still nice. Sweet burnt sugar and orange peel mix well with the malt. Basically, at a $1.59 for a 16oz bottle, this is one of the best bangs for the buck!"
"Clear, aside from the slew of tiny bubbles dancing in the liquid, Im impressed at the continuous rapid movement. The bubbles *seem* to be working their way to the head, which was off-white in color and about two fingers in height. The beer itself was a lovely tawny-bronze in hue, kind of coppery too. Head retention was fantastic; it was very slow to subside. I like active looking beers. Subsequent lacing was none but the head lasted forever thus keeping the attractive look. The nose is too clean for a Tripel. None of the aromas are loud. I get many suggestions from the bouquet like marshmallows, bubblegum, toasted grain, traces of spice and flowers (from hops?), and even some cereal. Is this really a Tripel? Without context the nose is okay, I wouldnt call it inviting. But for the style the nose is really lacking. Where are the Belgium qualities? Pathetic. The palate is fairly bland; it lacks the desired complexity, as it is far too clean. The taste is not Belgian; the palate offers cereal with grains and then some unpleasant sweetness that tries to mix with some fruity qualities like melon. For a fleeting moment the beverage becomes tasty and then the beer turns average again as some trace spiciness enters along with some flowers. I also get random flavors like bubblegum and marshmallows. There is nothing awful about this beer but really, is this a Tripel? It is insipid with flavors that are not in harmony. Medium-light in body with tight but active carbonation, the mouthfeel is decent but thin, empty. Clean aftertaste. Sure, this is drinkable but it is pointless to quaff. I mean, why bother? This is one of the most boring Tripels Ive had. I purchased a bottle in Milwaukee, WI. Ill skip it in the future."
"Edit - Alcohol came out as beer warmed during the drinking experience. I have adjusted the taste up a tad."
"Pours with a white, two-finger head that goes quickly and leaves some lace. Light to medium carbonation. Clear golden amber color. Nose is sweet and fruity. Light to medium bodied. Starts and finishes smooth, the high ABV (9%) is not noticeable. $1.95 for a 16oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"A slightly chalky mouthfeel brings this triple down a notch."
"If you have never had a triple this might be a good place to start. Very different than most tripels I have had."
"A little too ""off"" bitter for my liking....Decent color with a fruity smell, but the taste was quickly bitter...but not a nice hoppy biiter. Mouthfeel was light, but then the bitterness smacked you. Drinkability likewise was average due to the odd bitterness. I won't try this again, but may try some of their higher rated offerings."
"Drinkable but not more than one at a time. I think Sprecher has tuned it up since the last couple batches because this is pretty decent."
"*original score (as a tripel): 2.5"
"The homebrew club that I'm a member of had our November meeting at Sprecher's Beer Garden. One of the many beers that I had that evening was the Abbey Triple. It had a nice slightly cloudy amber color with a creamy head. The aroma and taste was slightly spicy and flowery. Very nice use of hops. Nice body and mouthfeel. In my opinion a very good beer. I would definitely try it again."
"Had this on the Sprecher tour. Had a hoppy fruity aroma a sweet and zingy honey taste which lingered thick on the tongue. There was an odd aftertaste I couldn't identify, perhaps some hops I had yet to experience. I'm not sure I totaly liked that, but if th bottled brew tastes like this, I'll try it again."
"This is a very odd Belgian Triple... pours a deep copper with a dissapointing head... no lace and little head retention. Aroma of banana and clove... no musty yeast character in the aroma or flavor. Flavor has a dominant caramel tone, with some banana in the background. Medium carbonation and a thin to medium body. Overall, this beer is a great letdown... I would recommend almost any other Triple I've had over this one."
"Abbey Triple pours a clear amber with a fizzy off-white head that disappears fairly fast. Plenty of carbonation visible from the multitide of bubbles in the body. The aroma consists of cloves, peppery yeast, malt, orange or tangerine and a hint of cherry. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. The taste lacks the complexity of a good tripel. Initial fruity flavor and yeast dominate. Finishes with a biscuity malt and alcohol taste. Overall pretty drinkable, but not the best example of a true tripel."
"Pours a deep golden color that's quite beautiful in the glass. The only question I have is, where's the head? For an abbey triple, it's almost nonexistent. Smell is of clove and banana, as would be expected. Taste is similar, with notes of fruit, spices, a touch of alcohol and yeast all making their presence known. Mouthfeel is quite drab for the style. Carbonation, like the head, just isn't there. Fairly easily drinkable, this beer isn't all bad, but it's certainly not up to par in its particular category."
"I'm no expert on this style, but I expected more head and carbonation. It does have a rich, royal gold apperance to it, but the lack of carbonation was interesting. On the nose, I thought this rated pretty well...bananna's and cloves. The taste seemed very sweet at first and then settled down...Tasted like a strong wheat beer actually...pretty smooth and drinkable but I was expecting something a little different from this...Belgian ttriples are not my thing, so I may be off on this, but it didn't seem the same as the few others I've had in this style."
"Pale color.  Fruity nose.  Yeasty, fruity taste.  Very thin body.  Light taste.  Kind of a refreshing beer, although I'm not sure that is the intent of a Belgian Tripel.  Some small hints of alcohol.  I'm not a Belgian Beer expert by any means.  (I've probably had a total of about 20-25 Belgian beers in my life.)  But this seems pretty bland compared to some of the others I've had.  I'm glad I only have one more of these."
