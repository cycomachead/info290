You can feel the oats a big more than in Tripel Karmaliet, and the herbal notes are sharper than most from Belgium and there's certainly more malt character standing up. But I'd say it's an excellent American take on the style, varying only slightly, like Victory's Golden Monkey. Very satisfying, and the strength is well hidden. This is great beer.","tempest","Mar 20, 2015"

Slight alcohol pepper and presence.  Taste is douhgy  and malty.  Tropical pineapple, apple skin.  Pineapple and pepper.  More sweet than tart with a substantial bitter to show off a lemony herbal.Slight warming in the dry finish.    At times it really doesnot drink or taste like a tripel. It's definitely american style.  They rye together with the lemony herbal and hops bitter is too much for the delicate tripel.  It drank heavy, a little syrupy, too much hop bitterness.  Heavy and slow malty finish.","utopiajane","Mar 09, 2015"
4.1,6.2,3.5,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Poured a pretty, cloudy orange body with one finger of thick, fluffy white head that receded with medium speed. A good looking body, but not enough head for the style. Scents of spicy Belgian yeast imparting notes of clove, woody coriander and white pepper. Fruity esters are moderately high with apricot and orange aromas dominating, aided by the aroma of the orange peels added during fermentation. Soft, spicy alcohol is present in the background. Malt character is low, befitting a tripel, with a softly sweet character overall. A light perfume-like aroma, likely from hops, adds depth in the background. Overall this is a nicely true to form tripel. The aroma is fruity and spicy, as befits the style, but also quite deep and complex. A fine example of a basic tripel aroma. Flavor begins lightly sweet, with notes of soft, sweet sugar cookie-like malt and orange flesh fruity esters. This is backed by a light phenolic bitterness imparting flavors of white pepper, clove and coriander. Light soft alcohol flavors are also present. Middle picks up bitterness with further phenolic flavors, becoming more intense, but with the same mixture as above. To this is added a light orange zest character, light spicy hops and a slightly more intense alcohol. Finish is medium-dry with notes of clove, white pepper, coriander at medium-high levels and medium levels of spicy hops, alongside soft, sweet alcohol and orange zest flavors at similar levels. A soft malt sweetness is present in the background. Aftertaste is bitter, with notes of spicy white pepper and clove and bitter spicy hops. Overall impression of flavor is of a rather nice tripel, quite true to style with the mix of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors, backed by a soft, but not overwhelming sweetness. A good example of the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth creamy feel and medium-light carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is fairly on-point for the style, though carbonation is a bit too low. Overall this is a fairly good take on a Belgian Tripel. It is true to style in aroma and flavor, and mostly true in mouthfeel and is quite pleasant to drink. Its lower price relative to imported and high-end domestic tripels make up for its few shortcomings relative to those higher priced examples. A nice beer and a shame it's not year-round.","Auraan","Mar 09, 2015"

This beer has the depth, a few layers on the palate, bright and crisp while rolling smoothly and imparting a softness without giving up firmness.

Big white head forms fine even lacing, aromatics are pleasant with coriander soft not over done, a bit of orange peel brings nice citrus to the mix, with a spicy complex Belgian yeast character. Flavor spices give a nice complement to the citrus and bready yeast notes, nice biscuit malts pleasant even sweetness very balanced Belgian style ale by no means a classic tripel just a nice well made golden ale. Well hidden alcohol it's not even remotely alcoholic and weighs in at 8.3% abv, well played Great Divide this is when of their better Belgian style offerings yet. Mouthfeel, smooth creamy textures lingering spice character with the orange peel bitterness balance it out and dry the finish a good bit, carbonation not as effervescent as I would like but it's solid and carries the texture of the beer quite well.

A airy aroma that is light and mostly citrusy and yeasty, although a touch of spice and sugariness seem to be in there. Beer is light bodied and smooth although it came across as more of a wit than triple at times. I say this because some of my sips were dominated by both a citric profile, bordering on orange with possible lemonzest, and spices like coriander. Couple with a sharp, crisp finish, and at times the beer didn't resemble a triple to me. That being said, there are hints of sweetness and other tropical fruits (pineapple) and it was enjoyable to sip on so I could care less of the designated title for this beer.","clayrock81","Jan 22, 2014"

The taste is a bit odd - I was excited when I saw rye on the label, but the rye here just doesn't work that well with the strong citrus, clashing and making the middle to finish section of the beer rather awkward. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and gently carbonated. The drinkability is alright, all things considered. Overall, Orabelle isn't that good a beer. It has promise, but falls apart pretty quickly.","shand","Apr 05, 2013"

Typical clean-looking Great Divide label on bottle; sillouhette of a girl aiming a bow and arrow, I'm guessing some kind of cupid-theme. Almost no head after pouring into a goblet. Cloudy, warm, butterscotch-yellow color is pleasing. Not sure if it's because I just said ""butterscotch"" but I'm detecting some of that in the nose, candy and alcohol, plus some yeast and maybe some light citrus. The flavor is good, and I get more of the citrus from it, orange for sure, and they do indicate on the side of the bottle it's brewed with orange peel. Alcohol taste is negligible. Mouthfeel is thick, nicely carbonated, and punchy, plus sort of a nice lightly bitter finish to balance - again I'm going to guess orange peels on that one. Overall, love this beer.

Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, spices, and Belgian yeast. Taste is much the same with a slightly tart citrus fruit flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that quite tasty and a solid American take on the style.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 23, 2013"

3.51,-9.1,3,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Slightly foggy golden yellow color covered by a slim layer of milky suds. Spicy, fruity aroma...coriander, orange peel, banana, clove, flowers, and mild dough. Big, fruity esters burst forth in the mouth. Peppery phenols, citrus zest, some tart acidity, coriander spice, and a tangy-ness that I assume comes from the wheat. Only a little grain near the end, but all the bright, yeasty, spicy flavors overwhelm any malt (and I REALLY like to have some noticeable pale malt in my tripels to soften and balance things out). The finish is sweet, but nondescript. Medium bodied and low on carbonation, which hurts the drinkability, though a pleasant dryness helps. Not bad, far from the best.","wedge","Jan 21, 2013"

4.95,28.2,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Finally! A Begian Style Tripel that does not break the bank. I have a bottle of La Trappe in the fridge, one of my favorite Tripels, but that set me back $12 for a bomber which is $6 for a glass of beer. Great for a special event, but where is the common man's Tripel? Dry Dock brews a good one, but it is still $6 for a bomber and not always available. New Belgium comes close with their Trippel, but it has a bit much coriander for my taste. So I jumped at the chance to try the Great Divide Orabelle when I saw the six pack in the beer cooler for $10. The color is a cloudy peach with a thin head and little carbonation. Belgian yeast and bready sweetness come through the aroma. So far so good. The flavor is big on apricot with a touch of honey. Very light pepper touches the finish to make for an outstanding Belgian Style Tripel. Thank you Great Divide! (The Great Divide Colette is worth a try as well....)","iSip","Jan 05, 2013"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"A tripel brewed with barley, wheat, oats, and rye, along with the other accoutrements of the style. Right on. It pours a hazy sunflower topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, orange zest, mango, Belgian yeast, light black pepper, and light cracked wheat. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, Belgian yeast, banana, clove, light black pepper, and light coriander. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda grainy feel. Overall, a very nice tripel, one that showcases a bit more in the way of fruitiness than spiciness and somehow makes it work.","TMoney2591","Dec 31, 2012"
