Alcohol warmth is a little exaggerated and the yeast is complex, but not particularly mind-blowing. It relies on the hoppy spices a little more than the yeast itself. Still a great attempt.","Phocion","Jul 06, 2014"

Head recedes quickly but never disappears completely. Smell is of bananas and alcohol. Taste is more of the same. Bananas and other fruit in the foreground, alcohol is present but still masked well even with a 9.7 ABV. Only a slight spice taste. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth with below average carbonation. Overall this is a pretty good trippel, but not the best I've had. It could've used a bit more spiceyness that you find with other trippels.","MisSigsFan","Mar 18, 2013"

3.97,6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy dull orange with suspended fine sediment, one finger thick white colored foam that settles to a thin ring but leaves a thick sheet of lace for the first couple of inches. Smell: pale malt sweetness, fruity... nectarine, white grape juice, hopping is moderately spicy and lightly herbal and earthy. Taste: upfront it's spicy with the suggestion of lemon peel, then a blast of sugary pale malt, white grape, lots of soft apple. The yeast promotes the fruit flavors, but it's not exactly running wild. The feel is pillowy cut by syrupy...equals chewy. Medium-plus bodied, finishing sweet, sticky, and semi-dry. Enjoyable but I'm not likely to grab one again soon.","babaracas","Nov 28, 2012"

The beer smells of apples, pears, spices, and malt. The taste is that of a classic tripel. The fruit and spice notes go well with the malt backbone. The hops do add some nice balance throughout the beer. The malt becomes more prominent as the beer continues to warm. The alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor, but I do taste some alcohol as the beer warms. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry.

Liquor is medium amber, hazy although not a bottle-conditioned beer, effervescent, perhaps a tad darker than one might see in a typical trippel. Pours a large, loose, white head that remains a foamy presence, leaving light lacing. On the nose is dried apricot, mango, banana, and clove. Lots of fruit in the flavor, with apricot notes being dominant up front and banana toward the end, some spiciness, and a fairly sweet finish. The substantial alcohol is displayed as an underlying counterpoint. This is an above average beer, but sweet for the style, and the haziness is a bit puzzling.","MCDuhamel","May 01, 2012"

Also, the lack of pungent yeastiness is a big disappointment, as that's something I really look for in a good tripel.

With just a slight bitterness to it. Smells wonderful. In the taste I pick up some caramel and honey sweetness. Along with a little bitterness and some sour lemon zest for a little balance. Finish has some Belgium spice to it. Great mouth feel. Medium bodied and very smooth and clean. Carbonation is a little above medium but adds to the drinkability. Overall I dig this beer a lot.

Taste is heavily of spice, clove, orange, malt, with some banana, caramel and a hint of vanilla. Alcohol in the finish, but overall a good taste, lots of malt comes through as it warms.

Some honey and a nice hop spice round out this brew. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, not overcarbonated like some Belgian styles can be. The taste is sweet in the typical tripel sort of way, though it is not very sticky or slick. The alcohol is pretty well hidden for an American made tripel.

Head is creamy off-white, tightly packed and short-lived (half-life of the head was less than 30 seconds). Very little lacing on the glass. Smells of a typical belgian trippel: banana, clove, spice. Lots of fruity esters. Taste is a little dissapointing. Simply average. Nothing more. Banana and clove flavors, and a little spice. Alcohol flavors are disrupting my palate. The ethanol really is noticable in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is also a let-down. Oily and slick, not light and tingly like a typical Belgian trippel. Overall, an average Belgian style trippel, although a good attempt from a decent American microbrewery.

The mouthfeel bothered me- it was not very light at all, and the body was heavier than i like in a tripel- thankfully the full flavors did hide some of the less refined alcohols.

3.6,-3.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Green Flash is now one of my favorite breweries, but this is not one of my favorite offerings. It starts very typical and average of the style, and never does much to improve. The ABV is sizable, but actually well presented. While it's not irretrievable, this one does speak to sticking to what you do best, especially when one's best is as good as theirs.","Foxman","Dec 20, 2006"
3.58,-4.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I got this one on cask at the liars club. this was their only cask offering so i figured i would give it a try. It arrived in a Chimay chalice, a cloudy golden colour with a nice head that was retained throughout. Taste wise it was a little on the flat side for a tripel. i was left wanting more. The mouthfeel was very nice, but on cask not more than expected. If you see this on cask, try some. If not i would raher have a lot of other tripels.","sleazo","Dec 17, 2006"
3.03,-19,3.5,3,3,3,3,"D: The high abv and thin malts don't cut it for me. They focus too much on the alcohol flavors. I find that Green Flash's hop-based ales (Pale and IPA) really work while this one comes up short.","akorsak","Dec 14, 2006"
3.97,6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Hmmmm...I have a mixed take on this offering. On one side I think its one of the better American attempts at a tripel. However, it still falls short of its Belgian counterpart. This is getting better and better though and this is definitely towards the top as far as a yankee offering. Good.","DogFood11","Dec 09, 2006"
3.51,-6.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Mouth is a little too acidic/astringent, but generally pleasant. A good tripel, definitely a good value. You can get better, but you will pay more.","Dukeofearl","Dec 08, 2006"
3.47,-7.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I guess this beer is drinkable for a tripel but Green Flash is better at other beer styles and there is always a Trappist available. I will not buy this one again.","Terp96","Dec 07, 2006"
